            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            IN Acknowledgement of his own true Loue and Respect, DON DIEGO
PVEDE-SER Dedicateth these his INDEAVOVRS.
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               COurteous Reader, to seeke thy approbation of this Booke by any
faire &amp; plausible inductions, were to distrust, if not impaire the worth
of it. 'Tis folly to light a Candle to the Sunne, as likewise to praise that,
which in it selfe is all praise worthy. True Vertue needs no Orator to set her
foorth; her owne natiue beautie is so moouing, that outward trappings can
afoord her small aduantage. If the diuine conceits and meditations of
Antiquitie can worke vpon thy Affections, I make no doubt but here's enough to
win thee. The whole Booke is nothing but a bunch of flowers collected from out
those pleasant Gardens, which were long since planted by the art and industrie
of those reuerend Fathers, whom God raised vp for Guardians to his Church,
during hir nonage and minoritie. If the sent of these shall please thee, the
Translator will hereafter furnish thee with the Labors of the same Author vpon
all the Parables.
            Some peraduenture may dislike it, because it was first composed by
a Spaniard; as if Eliah should haue refused his meat, because it was
brought him by a Rauen; or that in a curious Fountaine, where there are some
spouts formed like the heads of Serpents, others, like those of Doues, the
water that issued out of either were notall one. The antient Gaules had no
sooner tasted the delicious wines of Italy, but a desire tooke them 
 to goe and conquer the Countrey: the like had beene wrought vpon
the Israelites, when some of those, whom Moses by the appointment of
God himselfe,
                  Num. 13.23 had sent to view the
fruitfulnesse of the land of Canaan, brought them of the Grapes, Figs, and
Pomegranats, which the soyle affoorded; if others had not marr'd this reall
demonstration with a vaine suspition of the sons of Anak. But what,
shall not the corne be reaped because there's cockle in the field? Shal not the
rose be pluckt because it grows on a Brier? And yet let me tell thee, to
hearten thy aduenture against all needlesse &amp; imaginarie fears, The captiue
here hath her head shorn, and may well be admitted for a true Israelite. Thou
shalt not cry out, Mors in olla, Death is in the pot; that little
leafe of Coloquintida which was in it, is taken out, and the children
of the Prophets may tast of the broth without danger.
            Others it may be, wil condemne it as defectiue, because such
proofes &amp; passages as are alledged out of the fathers are not quoted in the
margent; &amp; indeed they should not haue bin wanting, but that in the Spanish
copy, they were found vpon good perusall (whether through the negligence of the
Printer, or some other default) to be so mistakē, that to haue set them down,
would haue occasioned trouble rather than content: but if euer the Booke come
to a second impression, all things shal be added, for the satisfying of thy
desires to the full. Meane while accept of this, and let it be thy Christian
ioy, That the lisping Ephramite is heard here to speake as plaine as the
smooth-tongu'd Canaanite; and that there is not so great a distance betwixt
Hierusalem and Samaria, as some imagine. And so I leaue thee to the blessing of
the Highest.
            Farewell.

               THE remembrance of death (saith Climachus) is, amongst
other remembrances,True life is to meditate on death.
as bread amongst other meats; howbeit it is more necessarie for the soule,
than bread for the bodie: For a man may liue many dayes without bread, but the
soule cannot doe so without the remembrance of death. And it is the generall
opinion of all the best and holiest Writers, Perfectissimam vitam esse
continuam mortis meditationem, i. That the most perfect life is a
continuall meditation of death. Chrysostome expounding that place of
Saint Luke, Qui vult venire post me, i. He that will follow
me, saith, That Christ commandeth vs not to beare vpon our backes that
heauie burthen of the woodden Crosse, but that we should alwayes set our death
before our eyes: making that of Saint Paul to be our Imprese,
Quotidiè morior, i. I die dayly.
            
            In the second of the Kings it is recounted, that the holy King
Iosias did clense the people from their Altars, their Groues, and high
places, where innumerable Idolatries dayly increased: and to amend this ill, he
placed there in their stead, bones, skulls, and the ashes of dead men. Whose
iudgement herein was very discreete; For from mans forgetting of his beginning
&amp; his end, arise his Idolatries; and so reuiuing by those bones the
rememberance of what they were hertofore, &amp; what they shal be hereafter, he
did make them amend that mischief.

  himselfe to bee what he is not.Verie many, nay numberlesse are those men
which adore the noblenesse of their Linage; and out of a desire that they haue
to make good their descent and beginning, they multiplie Coats one vpon
another, hang vp Scutchions, blazon forth their Armes, tell you large histories
of their pedigrees and genealogies, and many times most of them meere lies and
fables. Ezechiel did represent these vnto vs in those twentie fiue
yong men which were besotted and rauished in beholding the Sunne; which by way
of exposition signifieth the adoring of the glorie of their birth. But leauing
these as fooles, who glorie in the gold that glisters, the Church teacheth
thee another lesson, and sayes vnto thee, Memento homo▪ Remember man,

            God created Adam of the basest matter, of verie durt: but
this Durt being molded by Gods owne hand, and inspiring it with so much
wisedome, councell, and prudence,

  cap. 9. 
               Tertullian calls it Cura diuini ingenij,
i. The curiousnesse of Gods wit: but man growing proud hereupon, and
hoping to be a God himselfe, God doomed him to death, and wrapped him againe
in his durtie swadling clouts, with this inscription, Puluis es, &amp; in
puluerem reuerteris, i. Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt
returne.
            
            
               Adam did not without some mysterie cloath himselfe with
greene leaues; for (as Saint Ambrose hath noted it) he gaue
therein,In promising himselfe to be what he
  cannot. as it were, a signe and token of his vaine and foolish hopes.
But as the mother, when the
                  •
               ee hath
stung her childs finger, runnes with all hast to get a little durt, and claps
it to her little one, which doth assuage the swelling, and giue it ease; so
those busie Bees of hel dayly stinging vs, &amp; striking into our breasts the
poyson of their pride &amp; arrogancie; the Church with dust and ashes, with a
Cinis es, incinerem reuerteris, i. Dust thou art, and to dust thou
shalt returne, abates this pride, and tells vs of that swelling
arrogancie of ours.
            When God reuealed to Nebucadnezar, how little a while his
Empire was to last, he shewed him a statue of diuers mettalls, the head gold,
the brest siluer, the bellie brasse, the legges yron, the feet clay, and a
little stone which descended from the mountaine, lighting on the feet, dasht
the statue in pieces. But in stead of taking this as a forewarning of his end,
and to haue it still before his eyes, he made another statue of gold from top
to toe, which is held to be a durable and lasting mettal: so that the more God
sought to dis-deceiue him, the more was he deceiued with his vaine hopes. And
this is a resemblance of that which dayly hapneth vnto vs: for God aduising vs,
that our best building is but durt, our idle thoughts &amp; vaine hopes imagine
it to be of gold. And mans life being so short, that, as Nazianzen
said, it is no more than to goe out of one graue to enter into another, out of
the wombe of our particular mother, into that of the common mother of vs all,
which is the Earth; we flatter our selues with the enioying of many long yeres
of life. But the Church being desirous to cut off this error, saith,
Memento homo, i. Remember man.
            
            By Ezechiel God threatned his people with a great
slaughter, &amp; that they only should escape that were marked in the forehead
with the Hebrew letter Tau, which is the last in the alphabet: some
say that it hath the figure of a crosse; and it may be that when
Ezechiel did write this he had that figure before him: and S.
Hierome saith, That in stead of Tau the Samaritanes did vse
the figure of a crosse. The Hebrews by this letter vnderstand the end, as
beeing the last in the ABC. And God was willing that those that bore this marke
in their forehead (that is, should haue their end before their eyes) should
liue; but that those that liued forgetfull of their end, that they should die.
And the Church beeing desirous  that her children should
escape this danger, prints this in their minds, Terra es, Earth thou art,
&amp;c.
            
            It is well weighed by Rupertus, that after God had
condemned Adam to death, he bestowed vpon his wife the name of Life,
Mater cunctarum gentium, i. The mother of al the liuing.
Scarce had God condemned him to punishment, but he by-&amp;-by shews that he
had forgot it. And therfore did God permit the death of innocent
Abel, to the end that in Abel he might see th
                  •
                death of the body, and in
Caine the death of the soule, for to quicken his memorie. From
Adam we inherit this forgetfulnes, not remembring to day what we saw
but yesterday; &amp; the general desire of man striues all it can to perpetuate
our life, which if it were in our hands we would neuer see death. But because
the loue of life should not rob vs of our memorie, and that fearing, as we are
mortall, wee might couet those things that are eternall, seeing that walles,
towers, marble, and brasse molder away to dust, we may euer haue in our
memorie, Memento homo, Remember man, &amp;c.
            
            Many holy Saints haue stiled the memorie, the stomach of the
soule, as Gregorie, Bernard, Theodoret, Austen, Nazianzen, &amp;c.
And God commanding Ezechiel, That he should notifie vnto his people
certaine t
                  ••
               ngs that he had reuealed
vnto him; and charging him that he should remember himselfe well of them, he
said, Comede quaecunque ego do tibi, i. Eat whatsoeuer I giue
thee. And in another placehe commanded him that he should eat a Book,
wherin were written Lamentationes &amp; Vae. &amp;c. Being al
metaphors of the Prophets hauing things in his remembrance. Which is more
cleerely deliuered by Iob,
               
                  Iob. 15.
               Nunquid sapiens replebit arbore stomachū suum? i. Will a wise man
fil his stomach with that heat that shal burne &amp; consume him? Which is
to say, will he charge his memorie with matters of paine &amp; torment? The
proportion then holds thus; as the stomach is the storehouse of our corporall
food, and keeping therein our present meat, the bodie takes from thence it's
sustenance, whereby it maintaines it's beeing and it's life: so the memorie is
the Magazin of the soule, and setteth before our eyes the obligation wherein
wee stand, the good which we lose, and the hurt which wee gaine. And
representing thereunto the species and shapes of things past, they
sometimes worke that effect, as they would haue done had they beene present
themselues; whence is ingendred the loue of God, which is that good bloud
wherewith the soule is nourished. And as from the disorder and disagreement of
the stomach painfull diseases do arise, and diuers infirmities to the body; so
from the forgetfulnesse of our memorie rise those of the soule.

obliuion (saith Saint Basil) our saluation cannot be lost, nor our
soules health indangered. And as when the fuell and fire shall faile mans
stomach, which is the ouen which boyles &amp; seasons our life, we may giue
that of the bodies for lost: so when our memorie shal faile vs, we may giue the
soule for lost. Wherefore it is fit that euery man should take this into

            In Ezechiel the King of Tyre said, Deus ego sum,
i. I am a God:

answered, That he was but a man; that is, base, vile, and miserable. So
Dauid, Vt sciant gentes quoniam homines sunt, Let the Nations know that
they are men, i. base,

Angells there was found rust, and that so fine cloath as that, was not without
it's moaths, and that incorrupted wood without it's worme, What will become of 
 those that are but dust, Qui habitant domos luteas,

            God did not speake vnto Moses till he had drawne his
sheepe aside into the Desart; putting his hand twice in his bosome, the one he
tooke out cleane, the other leprous. We haue two bosomes to take care of in
this life; the one of our owne things, the other of other mens. But the

               Gregorie Nazianzen asketh the question, Why God hauing
created the soule for Heauen, did knit it with so streight a knot, to a bodie
of earth, so fraile and so lumpish? And his answer is, That the Angells being
ouerthrown by their pride, he was willing to repaire and to helpe this
presumption, in man, a creature in his superior part, as it were, Angelical,
but ha
                  •
               ing a heauie &amp; miserable
body, which might serue as a button or stay vnto him, that if the nimblenesse
of his vnderstanding should puffe him vp, yet that earth which clogged his
body should humble him and keepe him downe.
            Amongst other stratagems of warre, to annoy the enemie with dust,
and driue him thereby to yeeld, is not the least. Abacuc reports of a
King of the Caldeans, hathe made a jeast of walls, Towers, and Bulwarks,
because he could reare higher of earth,

               He shal deride euery strong Hold, and shall heap dust

hauing fortified themselues in a caue that was inexpugnable; to the mouth
thereof he laid great heapes of earth, and the wind fauouring him, he raised so
great a dust with his Troups of horse that they presently yeelded. The Church
finding many of their sons so rebellious, that neither misfortunes will reforme
them, nor stripes keepe them in awe, vseth this policie of Dust, comming vpon
them with a Memento homo, Remember man, &amp;c.
            
            In that mountainous Countrey of Biscay, there are some antient
buildings whose ruines declare them to haue beene heretofore great and goodly
things: here is a piece of a Tower standing, here a vast Hall, but gone to
ruine, there thicke great walls, but demolished; What houses are these? they
belong to the Mendoza's, or the Velasco's. And although these
Families haue in other places new Palaces, rich and sumptuous Halls with
guilded roofes, windows, galleries, Courts paued with Iasper, Gardens and
Fountaines faire and beautifull; yet do they make more reckoning of those old
houses, because they conserue their memorie, and shew the antiquitie of their
descent. The honours of the world, the Estates, Lordships, Offices, and
dignities, are things as it were of yesterday; but that antient house which
thou must most reckon of, is that thy ruinous house of dust and clay, which

                the looking vpon
that sad spectacle will not worke him, there is little hope of good to be done
vpon him. Now, the Church seeing that true death kills a man, and that that
which represents it giueth life, like vnto the brazen Serpent, which being
beholden and lookt vpon, gaue life to those which had beene wounded by those
true Serpents: it cannot be too often inculcated, Memento, &amp;c.
            
            Those that entred triumphantly into Rome had a thousand occasions
giuen them to incite them to pride, arrogancie, and vanitie; as their great
number of Captiues, their Troupes of Horse, their Chariots drawne with
Elephants or Lyons, and Ladies looking vpon them from their windowes, and the
like. But the Senat considring the great danger of the Triumpher, ordred one to
sit by his side to whisper this stil in his eare, Hominem memento te,
i. Remember thy self to be a man. The Princes of the earth haue many
motiues to make them forget themselues, not regarding the complaints of the
poore and needie; yet,
                  Sapient. 7. v.
  5. 
               Nullus ex regibus aliud habuit natiuitatis initium, i.
No King had euer any other beginning of birth: They are as other men,
Terrigenae &amp; filij hominum, i. The off-spring of the earth,
and the children of men. And to them also it is said, Terra es, Earth
thou art, &amp;c.
            
            The third attribute giuen to the name of man is Excellencie and
Dignitie, Faciamus hominem ad imaginem &amp; similitudinem nostram,
i. Let vs make man after our owne similitude and likenesse. Vpon this
point see Gregor. Nissenum de Opific. Hom. cap. 16. Tho. 1.
p. q. 97. art. 2. ad. 4. But man did fall from this
heigth of happinesse, and being lost through sinne, God seeks to restore him,
by putting him in mind, Puluis es, Dust thou art, &amp;c.
            
            Lastly, I would haue you to note, that the word Memento
doth implie a continuall remembrance, and a deepe meditation, that it may
stirre vp fire in vs: according to that of Dauid, In meditatione mea
exardescet ignis,
               
                  Psal. 39. v. 3.
  Meditation like gunpouder. i. A fire waxed hot in my heart while I
was musing. Meditation is like gunpouder, which in a mans hand is dust and
earth, but if you put fire thereunto it will ouerthrow Towers, walls, and whole
Cities: a light remembrance, and a short meditation of what thou art, is like
that dust which the wind scattereth away; but a quicke liuely memorie, and
inflamed considerations of our own wretched estates, will blow vp the towers
of our pride, cast downe the walls of our rebellious natures, and ruine these
Cities of clay wherein we dwell. As the Phoenix fannowing a fire with her
wings, is renewed againe by her owne ashes; so shalt thou become a new kind of
man by remembring what thou art. Moses casting ashes into the aire,
made the Inchanrers and their Inchantments vanish: the ashes scattered by
Daniel put the King out of doubt, &amp; made it appeare vnto him, that
that was no God which he adored: Iob came forth from his ashes in
better estate than hee was before▪ and as Ioseph came out of
prison from his ta

                  ••
               'd ragges, &amp; had richer robes put
vpon him; so you from out these your ashes shall be stript of the old man,
&amp; put on the new.
            
               Memento hom
                     •
                  ,
Remember man, &amp;c. Forgetfulnesse of other things may bee good
sometimes, but of thy selfe, and what thou art, neuer: this will require a
continuall Memento.
            
            This Memento is the father of two good effects: first, it
mooueth man to repentance,  by putting him in mind of his
frailtie: for beeing dust and ashes, how dare he contest with his Creator?
                  Esay 45.9. 
               Vae qui contradicit factori suo,
testa, &amp;c. Wo to him that gainsaith this, the pot against the Potter,
&amp;c. Thou glasse of Venice, thou dish of China, why contendest thou
with him, who as hee made thee, can in an instant dash thee in pieces?
            Secondly, it inclines God to mercie, Memento (quaso) quod
sicut lutum feceris me,
               
                  Iob. 10 9.
               Consider (ô Lord) that thou madest me of earth, &amp; as a
cheese that is prest thou didst mold vp in me a masse of bones, sinewes, and
flesh: if thou shalt lay thy heauie hand vpon me, what strength is mine, that
it should be able to indure it? if thou shalt not take pitty of this poore
piece of earth, this crazie vessel of clay, what will become of thy mercie of
old, and of all thy woonted kindnesse? if that steele and stronger mettall of
the Angells was broken by thee, it is no great matter if earth split and breake
in sunder.
            This Memento is so powerfull with God, that it workes two
great effects with him; the one, that it inclines him to clemencie; the other,
that it makes him to bridle his power. First, no father so pitties his
children, when hee sees them miserable. Quomodo miseretur
paterfiliorum, i. As a father pittieth his children, saith
Dauid of an infant that falleth into the dirte, and is bemoyled and
bebloodyed, and all because he is weake and ignorant; the like pittie doth God
take of those that feare him: and presently giues a reason of this his pittie,
Recordatus est, quoniam puluis sumus, i. He remembreth that wee
are but Dust. The like is elsewhere rendred, where it is said, Non
accendit iram suam, recordatus est, quia car
                     •
                   sumus,
               
                  Psal. 78.3
                     •
                  . i. He kindleth not his
wrath, because he calls to mind wee are but flesh. God in Deutr.
speaking of the iudging of his people, fayth, he will take pittie of them in
regard of their miserie and frailtie, Vidit quod infirmata sit manus,
i. Hee saw the weaknesse of their strength, and considered their poore
abilities: and this did often occasion him to alter the purpose of his
vengeance. That the wind should struggle with the Oake, that resists his rage,
and that he should teare his limbes from him, and rent him himselfe vp by the
roots, it is not much that he should take that course with him for his proud
resistance: but with the Reede or the Rush that submits and humbles itselfe,
obeying his Empire, and acknowledging his power, his furie falls not vpon them,
&amp;c.
            Secondly, The acknowledgement of our miserie and weakenesse, it
bridles the omnipotencie of God.
                  Iob. 14 3.
               Iob debating this businesse, cries out, Et dignum due is super
huiusmodi? I am a Flower that is withered within the compasse of a few
houres; I am a shaddow that at euery step changeth it selfe and vanisheth away;
Et dignū ducis super huiusmodi? Canst thou think it an honor vnto
thee to reuenge thy self vpon so sillie &amp; miserable a worme as man?
Contra felium quod vento rapitur, ostendis potentiam tuam; &amp; stipulam
siccam persequeris? I am but as the leafe of a Tree, one while the East
wind of pride tosses me this way; anotherwhile the West wind ofdespaire driues
me that way; one while the South wind of luxury▪ another, the North of
rage &amp; anger: Memorare qua mea substantia, Remember what my substance
is. The Lyon preyes not vpon children and women, nor the Eagle vpon the
lesser birds, nor your Irish Greyhounds vpon shepheards curs nor fo
                  •
               
               sting hounds: he that wrestles, and he
that runnes a race, will not stand in competition with him that is notoriously
inferiour vnto them, because they shal get no glorie by such a victorie. That
Emperor was much condemned that warred with Flies, and tooke great pleasure in
the killing of them. Being then that I am a shaddow, a flower of the field, a
reed, or rather a thing of nothing, What honour canst thou reape by my ruine?
&amp;c.
            
               
               Puluis es, &amp; in Puluerem reuerteris.
               
                  Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt returne. The end
  euer holds a correspondencie with it's beginning, Nudus egressus sum,
  &amp; nudus reuertar illuc, so saith Iob. The riuers come from
  the sea, and thither againe they returne; so doth the Sunne from the East, and
  thither it retyres again. That Image of gold, siluer, brasse, &amp; iron, that
  had it's feet of earth, must in the end turn to dust. Baruc asks,

                  Vbi sunt Principes gentium? His
  answere is, Ad inferos descenderunt; the earth hath swallowed them vp
  all. S. Basil commenting vpon this place, makes the like question, and
  giues the same answer, Nonne omnia puluis? Nonne fabula? Nonne in paucis
  ossibus memoria eorum conseruatur? The greatest and famousest of vs all
  haue been and are but dust; and there is no memorial left of them, but a few
  rotten and stinking bones. Vpon this point see Nazianzen Orat. de Humana
  natura: Epictetus in Sententijs; &amp; in Euchiridion. cap. 22.
  &amp;c.
               
               
                  Dust thou art, &amp;c.
                  The
 meditation of what we are, subdues in vs, From this Principle I will
  inferre three or foure conclusions of great fruit and consequence: The first,
  If thou art ashes, Quid superbis terra &amp; cinis, i. Whereof art
  thou proud ô thou dust and ashes? Of thy beginning? No: Of thy end?
  No: Of what then?Our Pride. August. de Verb. Dom.
 Serm. 10. Pride what manner of sinne. Psal. 19.13. If thou
  shouldest see thy selfe seated betweene the hornes of the Moone, De
  fundamento cogità humilitatis, Thinke on the basenesse of thy
  beginning, and thou shalt then see, that pride was not borne for man, nor anger
  and pettishnesse appointed for womans condition; pride cannot sute with durt,
  nor curstnesse with womans softnesse. Ab occultis meis munda me Domine,
  &amp; ab alienis parce seruo tuo, i. Lord clense me from my secret
  sinnes, and spare thy seruant for those that are strange. By
  alienis S. Hierome vnderstands those of pride, for it is a
  stranger, as it were, &amp; another kind of thing, differing much from mans
  base and vile condition: and the Hebrew letter saith, A superbijs, parce
  seruo tuo. Whereupon Saint Chrysostome noteth,
                     S. Chrysost. Homils▪ in cap. primū Ioannis.
                  
  That there is not any sinne more alien to mans condition, than pride, or that
  carries with it lesse excuse. Those fooles that Genesis painteth
  forth, going about to build a Tower that should ouertoppe the Clouds, did in
  their verie first word, Venite, faciamus lateres, i. Come, let vs
  make vs Brickes, bewray their foolishnesse: What, go about vpon earth to
  reare a foundation that should emulate Heauen? God said vnto Ezechiel,
  Take thou a tyle, &amp; portray vpon it the Citie of Hierusalem, the walls,
  the ditches, the Towers, the Temple,
                  
                     Ezech.
 4.1. 
                  and a great armie of men: Strange, yet true we see it is,
  that the strength of cities, the power of Armies, is contained in a poore
  brittle tile-stone.
                     Esay 16. Pride what kind of
 sinne. 
                  Esay threatned those of Moab with whips &amp; scourges,
  because they insulted and proudly triumphed vpon the walls and towers of his
  Citie; Loquimini plagas ijs, qui latātur super mun
                        •
                     s cocti lateris, i. Speake punishment to those
  that reioyce in walls that are made of brick. What, can earthen walls
  raise vp such pride in men? Samuel beeing to annoint Saul,
  God gaue him for a signe that he would haue him Prince ouer his People, That he
  should find two men as soone as he was gone from him, neere vnto
  Rachels Sepulchre. God might haue giuen him some other signe, but he
  chose rather to giue him this, to quell the pride and haughtinesse of this his
  new honor; as if he should admonish and put thee in mind, That the ashes of so
  faire a creature as Rachel should read a lecture vnto thee, what thou
  must be.
               And this is the reason why the Church, though she might vse
  other metaphors to expresse the misery and shortnesse of mans life, as is often
  mentioned in Scripture as by a leafe, a flower, a shaddow; yet it makes more
  particular choyce of Dust &amp; Ashes: besides, those be metaphoricall, and
  these litterall;Earth the basest element. for
  nothing more properly appertaineth vnto man than Dust, and therefore the
  Scripture  termeth death a mans returning againe to the
  earth, from whence he came. Conuertetur in terram suam, proiectus est in
  terram suam. The flower, the leafe, haue some good in them, though of
  short continuance, as colour, odor, beauty, vertue, and shade; and albeit not
  good in themselues, yet they are the image &amp; representation of good; but
  Dust &amp; Ashes speake no other good. Amongst the elements, the Earth is the
  least noble, and the most weake: the fire, the water, and the ayre haue spirit
  and actitude; but the Earth is as it were a prisoner laden with weightinesse,
  as with gyues. A certaine Poet stiles the Earth Bruta, not onely for
  that it hath an vnpleasant countenance, as Desarts, Quick-sands, Dens, and
  Caues; but also for that it is the Inne of Serpents, Tygres, Panthers, and the
  like. So that it is neither good to the tast nor the smell, nor the feeling,
  nor the hearing, nor the seeing; thou beeing therefore Earth, Quid superbis
  terra &amp; cinis, i. Why art thou proud ô Dust and
  Ashes?
               
               
                  Our Voluptuousnesse.The second
  conclusion is, If thou art Ashes, Quid vtilitatem saginando corpore?
  Why such a deale of care in pampering thy bodie, which the wormes are to
  deuour tomorrow? Looke vpon that flesh which thy fathermade so much of, that
  (now) rotten &amp; stinking carkasse; and this consideration will moderate thy
  desire of being ouer daintie and curious in cherishing thine owne.
  Isaac on the night of his nuptialls, placed his wifes bed in the
  chamber where his mother died: Tobias spent all the night with his
  Spouse in prayer, being mindfull of the harme which the Deuill had done to her
  former husbands; as being aduised from Heauen that he should temper with the
  remembrance of death, the delights &amp; pleasures of this short life of ours.
  The Cammomile, the worse you treat it, and the more you tread on it the better
  it thriues, other Plants require pruning and tending to make them fruitfull:
  but this herbe hath a quite contrarie condition, that with ill vsage it growes
  the better. It is the pamper'd flesh that brings forth thistles and thorns, but
  the flesh that is trodden downe and humbled, that yeelds store of fruit.
               
                  Our Couetousnesse.The third,
  If thou art Dust, and must tomorrow become Dust, Why such a deale of coueting
  of honours and riches? Why such great and stately houses, &amp; so richly
  furnished? Our forefathers liued eight hundred yeares and vpwards, and those
  seeming but few, they past ouer this life in poore Cabbins: now we liue but
  three dayes, (as it were) and we build houses as if we meant to liue for euer,
  they are so strong and durable. Esau sould his birthright for a messe
  of pottage, but he excused his so doing, for that he saw his death was so neere
  at hand, En, morior, quid proderunt mihi primogenita? i. Behold, I
  am readie to die, what will birthright profit me?
                  
                     Aug. q. super Exod. Cap. 5. Saint Austen
  puts a doubt, why the Aegyptians did so freely bestow their jewells, and their
  gold and siluer on the Hebrews? and the resolution is, That seeing their first
  begotten were all dead, they made light reckoning of those things which before
  they so much esteemed. Abulensis moues a doubt, Why the Gyants of the
  promised land did not deuoure the Israelites, being but as grashoppers in
  comparison of their greatnesse? Whereunto is a twofold answer; The first, That
  they came in as strangers, from whom they presumed they could receiue no hurt:
  The second, That God sent a consuming plague amongst them, Terra deuorat
  habitatores suo
                        •
                     , i. The
  Earth deuoureth her Inhabitants. And there is no man of what strength or
  mettall soeuer, that hath not Deaths dart sticking in his sides.
               There is a great deale of difference made of honour and wealth,
  between the liuing and the dying man: the rich Miser, that would not giue
  Lazarus a crum, would vndoubtedly when he was a dying, haue beene
  contented he should haue  had all the meat on his Table. And
  as Death doth mortifie andmake the flesh of Birds and Beasts more tender; so
  doth it soften in men their hard bowells, and causes pittie in their Soules,
  and is the Key that openeth their close-fistednesse. We read of certaine Fooles
  that said, To-morrow we shall die; let vs therefore laugh and be merrie, and
  inioy the pleasures of this world: for these thought there was no other life
  but this. But Paul, who was sorie to see this, made no such
  consequence, but the contrary; Death is neere at hand, let vs vse this world
  therefore as we vs'd it not, &amp;c. Two things, saith Seneca, are the
  summe of our life, Nasci, &amp; Mori, To be borne, and to die. Gregory
  Nissen treating of that place of Salomon, Omnia tempus habent, There
  is a time for all things, notes, That this wise man ioines our
  Nasci with a Mori, as being neere neighbors: and many times
  the time of death preuents that of our birth, &amp;c.
               Age paenetentiam, Repent.
               
               There are two things to be considered in Repentance: 
  
                     1 That it is alwaies good.
                     2 That it must be decent and discreete.
                  
               
               For the first, It subdues the flesh, &amp; makes it willing to
  submit it selfe, &amp; to become obedient to the spirit: Read Leo. Pap.
  Ser. 4, de Ieiun. Vide Cyp. Orat. de Ieiun. &amp; de Tent.
  Christi. and Tho. 2.2. q. 15. Peccasti? (saith
  Saint Chrysostome) poenitere. Millies peccasti? millies
  poenitere, i. Hast thou sinned a thousand times? repent a thousand
  times. Saint Austen saith, That the Deuil being desirous that Man
  should not repent himselfe of his sinnes, is still whispering him in the eare,
  Why doest thou torment and afflict thy selfe?How Repentance
 is to be
                        •
                      formed. It is
  strange that God should take pleasure to see thy destruction. Bread suffers
  martyrdome till it be brought to the boord; Siluer the same, till it be
  wrought into a vessell of Plate; Stone till it be placed in the house for which
  it was hewen; the Sacrifice, till it be laid on the Altar; it is no maruell
  then that Christians should suffer much, who so much desire to bee the Bread,
  the Vessells, the Stones, and the Sacrifice for Gods House and his owne
  Table.
               The second point is, That our Repentance should be decent and
  discreet. This may serue for a few, for there are but few that will
  exceede.
                     Rom. 12.1. To whom wee prescribe
  Saint Pauls rule, Rationabile obsequium vestrum, Your seruice
  must be weighed in the Ballance of reason. A Slaue when he is stubborne and
  rebellious deserueth the whip, but the correction must not bee so cruell as to
  occasion his death. Ecclesiasticus treating, That it is good to
  correct a seruant,
                     Eccl. 33.
                        ••
                     . doth put this in for a counterpoise,
  Verumtamen sine judicio nihil facias graue, i. Doe nothing without
  discretion: Nay, euen towards our Beast, malicious crueltie is condemned:
  Nouit justus jumentorum suorum animas, i. A rightuous man
  regardeth the life of his Beast; He will not lay more vpon them than they
  can beare:
                     Prou. 12.10. 
                  Viscera autem
  impiorum crudelia, i. But the bowells of the wicked are
  cruell.
               
               Two things are to bee considered in our Repentance: the one, The
  grieuousnesse of the fault; for to make light repentance for great sinnes, is
  a great inequalitie, as Saint Ambrose noteth it: And Saint
  Hierome saith, That the Repentance ought to exceede the fault, or at
  least equall it.

                   Not that humane weaknesse can make
  full satisfaction for it's heinous sins; but that it be performed in some
  proportion. The councel of Agatha declareth the custome that was vsed
  in this kind in the Primitiue Church: to wit, That they that were publike &amp;
  scandalous Sinners did present themselues in a kind of soutage or course
  Sacke-cloath before the Bishop, accompanied with all the Clergie, who inioyned
  him pennance  according to his offence, banishing him from
  the Church for some such time as they thought fit. But in a word, As the Flower
  is spoyled for want of water, so is it marr'd by too much. Our life is a tender
  Flower, and stands vpon a feeble stalke, Qui quasi flos egreditur &amp;
  conteritur; and as it is spoyled with the ouermuch verdure of delights
  and humane pleasures; so likewise it is quite marr'd through the sterilitie of
  moderate recreation and honest pastimes,Moderate
 Recreations lawfull. and with the too much drought of torment.
  Columella in his booke of Husbandrie saith, That Hay must not be made
  when the grasse is too green, nor too dry. Our flesh is like grasse, &amp; to
  haue it cut in a good s
                     •
                  ason, it
  must neither haue too much greenenesse of iollitie, nor too much drinesse of
  trouble; for the one doth rot and taint it, and the other doth wast and consume
  it.
               Likewise there must be a care had to the season, for the cure:
  As often therefore as a man shall find himselfe wounded by sinne, so often
  must hee apply the plaister of Repentance. And as to deferre the cure in a
  dangerous sicknes breeds great perill; so stands it with the putting off
  Repentance from day to day.
               There are three differences of Time, Time past, present, and to
  come; that which is past is no more; that which is to come is in Gods hands,
  and that hee should bestow it vpon vs is his liberalitie and goodnesse; the
  present is but short, and for ought I know I may presently die. And herein is
  mans madnesse seene: for there is scarce that man to bee found, that thinkes it
  now to day a good time to repent him of his sinnes, but with the Crow cries
  Cras, Cras. Salomon saith of a bad paymaster, Tempore
  redditionis, postulauit tempus, i. Hee requireth time, when it is time
  to pay. Pharaoh hauing giuen his word to let Gods people go to day, he did
  still put it offtill to-morrow: S. Austen before he was conuerted, to
  those inspirations that daily called vpon him, his answer stil was to-morrow;
  til at last tyred out with so many delays, he cried out, How long shall I say
  to-morrow? God complaineth of his People by Esay, That they did
  deferre from day to day to come vnto him.
               The Church teacheth, that we should not procrastinate our
  Repentance: &amp; the Lord saith vnto vs, Nunc conuertimini ad me, i.
  Now turne you vnto me. Wilt thou know which is the best season? It is
  to day: for although this day may be verified of all the dayes of the yeare,
  and of all the yeares of a mans life, none is comparable to that of to-day, as
  well in respect of God as thy selfe.
               Saint Chrysostome saith, That the Lent is the Spring of
  the Church: wherein are to be found three fitting similitudes.
                     Chrys. Hom. 1. in Genes. Homil. 5. ad
 Popul. Bern. Serm. in Cap. Iei
                           •
                        nij.
                  
               
               The first, As Kings vse in the Spring to raise an Armie against
  their enemies, and to make graue and seuere exhortations vnto them to
  incourage them to victorie; so the Church at this time strikes vp her Drummes,
  spreds her colours, and exhorteth her faithfull souldiers to take Arms against
  the Deuill, the World, and the Flesh.
               The second, As in the Spring those Trees that in the Winter haue
  been as it were dead, putting on greene apparell, giue testimonie of that life
  which was hid and concealed; so a Christian which hath been dead all the yeare
  long; striuing now to cloath himselfe anew with the leafes,
                     Aug. Ser. 55. &amp; 69. de
 Tempore.
                   flowers, and fruits of good workes, discouers that life
  which lay wrapt vp in the roots of Faith.
               The third, (which is Saint Austens) As the Sunne doth
  alwayes communicate his heat and influences (but they are more temperate and
  fruitfull in the Spring) so the Sonne of Righteousnesse, though hee euermore
  communicateth those fauours vnto vs which are necessarie for our saluation; yet
  at his holy time, appointed by the Church for the preparing of our soules
  against the day of  Easter, they may be thought more
  prosperous and more aboundant, &amp;c.
               Lent is likewise called the August and Haruest of a Christian.
  Hee that in August prouides himselfe of Corne, comes not to suffer hunger: but
  hee that ouerpasseth the Haruest, it is no meruaile if he starue for want of
  bread; Transit mess
                        •
                     s
  (saith Ieremie) finita est aestas, &amp; nos saluati non
  sumus, i. The Haruest passeth, the Sommer is at an end, and we are not
  saued.
               
               Necessitie likewise driueth vs thereunto, Hee that is fallen
  striues to rise againe; the sicke to be whole; the blind to see; he that hath
  lost his way to returne into it againe, though it be through bushes and
  briars; hee that suffereth shipwracke to escape, if he can, vpon a planke:
  &amp; last of all, he that loseth a thing of value will endeauour to find it
  out againe, though it cost him a great deale of paine and trouble: yet all
  these losses are farre lesse than those of a sinner. Hee is fallen into the
  mire of sinne, and findes no helpe in the earth to lift him vp; he is sicke,
  but no physicke of Hypocrates nor Galen can recouer him; he
  is blind, but yet cannot get his sight; he hath suffered shipwrack, and can
  take hold of nothing in this sea of the world to saue him; he hath lost a
  jewell of that inestimable value, whose losse is a losse of losses, &amp; the
  sum of all miserie. Now if to day at this time we may repaire these our
  grieuous losses, it is our fault if wee grow carelesse and drowsie therein,
  &amp;c.
            
            
               
                  Cum jeiunatis, nolite fieri, &amp;c. When yee fast,
  bee not, &amp;c.
               Here the Commentators make a stand. The Gospell indeering the
  poornesse of spirit, and other vertues of Fasting, speakes no word thereof,
  though it presuppose it, and prescribeth rules how it ought to be done. And
  the answere is, The greatnesse of the priuiledge of Fasting, whose noblenesse
  is so antient, that Christ supposeth the same, though hee speaketh not thereof.
  There are some Gentlemen in our State, of that antiquitie, that without shewing
  their Titles or their Priuiledges, no man will offer to question them. Others
  there are, howbeit noble, either through emulation, or that they are not so
  antient, are driuen to prooue their Gentilitie. Against some vertues, some
  Emulators haue not stucke to speake; but against Fasting no man euer opened his
  mouth. Mahomet himselfe neuer denied the noblenesse of Fasting, but
  rather so much recommended it, that our fastings should be ashamed to stand in
  competition with theirs.
               And therefore it is said, Cum jeiunatis, When yee fast,
  &amp;c. And anon after, Tu autem cum jeiunas, But thou when thou
  fastest. There are such forcible and precise arguments vpon this point,
  that it were a superfluous labor to aduise whither it be to be done or no, when
  as it is aduised how it ought to be done. Heare S. Paul,
                  1. Cor. 10.31. 
                  Siue comedatis, siue
  bibatis▪ siue quid aliud facitis, omnia in gloriam Dei facite; i.
  Whither yee eat or drinke, or whatsoeuer yee doe, let all be done to the
  glorie of God. He doth not aduise you vnto it, for that were a kind of
  force and constraint; but tells you how it ought to be done. As that it were a
  superfluous thing to aduise a man that is sore sicke, to obserue a dyet; or one
  whose house is on fire, to cast water thereon; or him that payeth money, to
  take an Acquittance; or him that enters the Church, to kneele when he comes in:
  so it were a needelesse thing to command a man to fast, who from the beginning
  of the world tooke a furfet of eating. Niniuie was saued by fasting.
  Ioel proposeth the like meanes, when he crieth vnto the people,
  Conuertimini ad me in ieiunio, Turne vnto me in fasting.
               
               When the Law of Grace was first published through the
  world,The antiquit of Fasting. Fasting was
  proclaimed, Venit Iohannes non manducans nec bibens, i. Iohn came
  neither eating nor drinking. He is said not to come eating, for that he
  did eat but little: as wee say  of him that is sicke, That
  he eats nothing, when he takes no more sustenance than will hold life and soule
  together. And the first step of our Sauiours penance for our sinnes, was
  fasting, in token that our first hurt came by eating. The first Law that God
  gaue man after that he had created him, was, That he should not eat of the Tree
  of knowledge of good and euill: wherein, tended the one, that man in this so
  great a happinesse should not forget that he had a Lord and Master; the other
  had an eye to the repairing of that his future fault, and that man might
  vnderstand, that he should in fasting find a remedie for that hurt which came
  vnto him by eating. And as a wise Phisitian, feeling the sick mans pulse, finds
  out his il disposition, &amp; perceiuing that his sicknes grew from that ill
  ripened fruit, which euen to this day is not yet fully digested; did prescribe
  this Recipe as a medicine to cure this our maladie: to the end, That
  as man did eate to sickenesse, so hee might fast to health; and as Gluttonie
  did banish vs from Paradice, so Fasting might recall vs thither againe.
               
                  Not Fasting the cause of all euill
                        •
                     .Whence this note may bee
  gathered, That all those euils that are now in the world, are in recompence of
  that wrong which was done in Paradice vnto Fasting. So that not onely our
  first Parents smarted for it, but all their posteritie euen to this day; so
  that if any thing helpe this Surfet, it must be Fasting.
               Take off the casement from your Studie window in a windie day,
  and it will hurle all your papers abroad: What's the remedie for this? you must
  set it vp again, &amp; all will be wel. Chrisologus harped vpon this
  conceit in a Sermon of his vpon the prodigall child; where he cries out,
  Fame pereo, I die by hunger: Wherevpon this presently followeth,
  Surgā ibo ad patrem meum, I will rise and goe to my father: So that
  you see that Fasting and Hunger restor'd him presently to his former happie
  estate. So that if our antient lost libertie could possibly be repaired, it
  were no waies better to be recouered than by Fasting. And if by Fasting, the
  ship of this our life takes in no water, and without it is ouerwhelmed and
  drowned; let vs lay the whole lading of all our il or good vpon our
  Fasting.
               
                  
                     Amb. li. de Hel. &amp; de Ieiunio,
 cap. 4.Saint Ambrose prooueth, That while fasting
  continued in the world, God did still better and inrich it with new things: The
  first day he created the Light; the second, Heauen; the third, Earth; the
  fourth, the Sunne, Moone, and Starres; the fifth, the Fishes of the sea, and
  the Fowles of the aire: and though hee gaue them his blessing, hee did not say
  vnto them, That they should eate. The sixth, Beasts of the field and Man: and
  giuing them licence to eat, the workes of God and the perfections of the world,
  were ended. Wherein God gaue man as it were a watch-word, that eating would be
  his vndoing. And (as Saint Chrysostome hath it) if in that so happie
  an estate Fasting was so necessarie, What shall it bee in this miserable
  condition of ours. Saint Iohns Disciples said vnto Christ, Master, why
  doe we and the Pharisees fast, and thy Disciples not? Hee answered, While the
  Bridegroome is present the children are not to weepe, but the time shall come
  wherein they shall not haue him with them, and then they shall fast &amp;
  mourne. The presence of our Sauiour, and the enioying of his most sweet
  companie, did bridle their appetites, and keep their soules in subiection; but
  in his absence he inferreth, that this must be done by Fasting.
               Saint Ciril saith, That Fasting is a greater Sacrifice
  than that of Abraham; for that Sacrifice was to be done vpon anothers
  bodie, this vpon our owne. Tertullian noteth, That God calling to
  Adam, asked him, Vbi es? Where art thou? But to
  Elias,
                  
                     Tertul. Tract. de Ieiunio.
                  
                  Quid agis, Helias? What do'st thou, Elias? And he saith, That
  the one was of anger and threatning, the other of softnesse and mildnesse,
  because he was emptie, and had fasted fortie dayes.
               
                  Saint Ambrose attributeth
  innumerable miraculous effects to Fasting; instancing in Niniuie, in
  Moses, in Elias, in Daniel, in Hester, in
  the mothers of Sampson and Samuel, in Iudith,
  &amp;c. Besides, it giueth great light vnto knowledge and wisedome: for
  Gluttonie is an euill disposition for inquirie of truth; Repleti sunt, qui
  obscurati sunt terrae, saith Dauid, They are full fed, and blind.
  For this cause Ceres the Goddesse of Aboundance, is painted with Poppy
  in her hand, because those that are full fed quickely fall asleepe. Nothing so
  much ouerthroweth Man, as the ouercharging of his stomacke with meat; In
  multis escis erit infirmitas: Distemperature in dyet is that Nurse which
  giues milke vnto the Physition. Dauid with fasting couered the faults
  of his whole life, Operui in jeiunio animam meam: Sola gula (saith
  Saint Bernard) peccauit, sola jeiunet, &amp; sufficet, onely
  Gluttonie offended, let Gluttonie onely fast, and it sufficeth.
               
               Our nature hath a twofold consideration, one corporall, another
  spirituall; Alterum commune cum Dijs, (saith Cicero)
  alterum cum Brutis, One common with the Gods, another with the Beasts.
  There is a twofold thirst, one false, the other true: there is likewise a
  twofold desire, one of wantonnes, another of necessity. Our Sauiour fasted, but
  when he was oppressed with hunger he did eat; the like may euerie good
  Christian doe: and therefore Saint Gregorie saith, That a man may
  denie that to desire, which he may grant to necessitie. I will conclude this
  point with this short saying, Carnis curam ne feceritis in desiderijs, Let
  the cockering of your flesh be no part of your desire.
               
            
            
               Be not like the hypocrites, &amp;c.
               This little short clause doth affoord three or foure seuerall
  kinds of sences:What to bee obserued in Fasting. The
  first, That wee must not onely doe good, but shunne euill; and therefore
  aduiseth those that fast, not to be like vnto those Hypocrites, whom the wind
  of Vaine-glorie rob'd of all the good they did. It seemeth that the Church and
  the Gospell in this agree: The Church telles vs, That we are Dust; the
  Gospell, That wee should beware of wind, that wee bee not carried away
  therewith; withdraw thy selfe out of the Street, and from thy doore, where the
  wind whisketh and blowes hard, and retyre thy selfe into thy house, and Fast in
  thy priuate Chamber; let not thy right hand know what thy left doth: Do not
  like these Hypocrites, publish not thy Fastings, thy Prayers and thy
  Almes-deeds in the Streets and open Market place, lest the wind scatter them
  away, and they bee no more seene or heard of. Saint Gregorie
  saith,
                     Greg. Mor. lib. 19. ca. 13.
  That Hypocrites die by the hands of those vices which they haue ouercome: they
  fast, and fasting kills them; they giue Almes, and their Almes-deeds are their
  destruction. Eleazar a most valiant Souldier slew an Elephant which
  bore vpon his backe a Tower of wood, but the Elephant thus slaine chanced also
  to slay Eleazar: great pittie that so valiant a man should die, but
  more, that hee should die by the hands of the dead. Many Christian Souldiers
  there are, which doe braue and worthie deeds, ouercome great vices, yet die in
  the end by their hands.
               The second, That your Fastings, and your Good-workes are more
  from God than your selues; Non possumus cogitare aliquid ex nobis, Of our
  selues wee cannot so much as thinke. Mans pouertie is so great, that hee
  cannot come to so much as a good thought, and therefore may not make
  merchandise of that wealth which is none of his owne. But God is so free in the
  workes of Vertue, and so bountifull, that being at all the charge himselfe,
  hee giues thee all the gaine; onely hee will that thou giue the glorie vnto
  him, and take the  profit to thy selfe. That Workeman
  should doe ill, who hauing built a house with another mans Purse, should goe
  about to set vp his owne Armes vpon the Frontispeece. Iustinian made a
  Law, That no master-Workeman should set vp his name within the bodie of that
  building which hee made out of anothers cost. Christ sets thee aworke, and
  wills thee to Fast, to Pray, to giue Almes; but, Who is at the cost of this so
  good and great a worke? God; thou hast all thy materials from him, the building
  is his, it is his Purse that payes for all: giue the glo
                     •
                  ie therefore, and the honor thereof vnto him;
  Gloriam meam alteri non dabo, i. I will not giue my glorie to
  another. Content thy selfe with Heauen, which is promised vnto thee if
  thou doost well, which is a sufficient reward for any seruice that thou canst
  doe.
               
                  Hypocrisie in Fasting.The third, That
  Fasting, Praying, giuing of Almes, done onely for Gods sake, is of that great
  price and estimation, that it is ill employed on any other than God. And for
  that God weighes all things in his hand as in a ballance, and knowes the weight
  of euery good worke, and the true value therefore; it grieues him that thou
  shouldst doe these good things for so vile and base a price, and is sorrie to
  see thee so poore and foolish a Merchant, that thou wilt part wirh that which
  is as much worth as Heauen to thee, for that which is lesse than earth; to wit,
  onely that the World may say, Such a one fasteth; Why doost thou thus crucifie
  thy flesh? Why debarre thy bellie of food? Why being readie to die for hunger,
  doost thou not eat? Why lift vp thy eyes to Heauen for so poore a thing as to
  winne applause vpon earth. Sterni lutum quasi aurum, saith
  Iob: those works that are done for God, are gold; done for the world,
  durt.
                     Iob. 41.30. They lay vp this their
  treasure in the tongues and eyes of men, which is a chest that hath neither
  locke nor key vnto it.
               The fourth, That Fasting is a Plaister for our wounds, a
  Medicine for our griefes, a Salue for our sinnes, and a Defence against Gods
  wrath. But thou must take heed that thou doe not make this Plaister poison;
  this Medicine sicknesse; this Salue a sore; and this Defence, our destruction.
  For where God hath a Church, there the Deuill hath a Chappell; and where hee
  throwes in seed, the other will sow tares. Naboth a Subiect of King
  Achab had a Vineyard in Samaria neere vnto the Kings Palace; the King
  had a mind vnto it; Naboth will not part with it: the King growes
  sad, refuses his meat; Iezabel comes to see him, makes a jest of it;
  takes pen in hand, dispatches a Ticket to the Gouernors of that Citie, sealed
  with the Kings Seale, to proclaime a Fast; subornes two witnesses to sweare,
  That they heard Naboth blaspheme God &amp; the King: the innocent
  Naboth is stoned to death, and his goods confiscated. In which action
  there are two things worthie our consideration: The one, That the circumstance
  of blaspheming God and the King vpon a solemne day of Fast, (as it is noted by
  Vatablus) was so grieuous, that of force hee must be condemned to die
  for it, in so great veneration was Fasting in those dayes. The other, That it
  serued as a cloake for the taking away of the Vineyard, for the falsifying of
  witnesses, and injustice in the Iudges. Who should haue then seene the People
  to fast, would haue thought it had beene done out of zeale, Gods honour, and a
  desire to doe him seruice. But it was meerely a tricke of the Deuils, which hee
  had plotted with himselfe. Hee threw poyson vpon vertue, seeking to draw euill
  out of good. Wee must therefore beware, least these our good actions receiue
  hurt, by euill intentions.
            
            
               
               Like Hypocrites.
               Hypocrisie runnes a quite contrarie course to these foure points
  before specified, and crosses the same three or foure manner of waies.
               First, It feigneth the good which it hath not. As the proud Man,
  Humility; the Cholericke, Patience; the Wanton, Honestie; the Miser,
  Liberalitie. This leger-demaine is that which hath more generally spred it
  selfe through mens brests, being desirous that the bodie should serue for the
  soule, as painting for the face, which being blacke, makes it seeme white. The
  painted Image of diuers colours (whereof Wisedome speaketh) stirreth
  vp in Fooles a kind of pleasure and delight. This stampe, though it be there
  set vpon Idolaters, may bee truly set vpon Hypocrites, for the comparison will
  hold well in both. Hee that shall truly and steddily looke vpon the face of an
  Hypocrite, shall in him behold an Image flourished ouer with sundrie colours,
  but counterfeit and feigned; as the white of Chastitie, the watched of Zeale,
  the red of Loue. But this is but a dunghill couered ouer with snow: the
  Hypocrite sheweth teares in his eys, deuotion in his mouth, sorrowfulnesse in
  his countenance, and mortification in his flesh. But he is not the man he
  seemes to be: for the Painter, though he giue the Varnish of the colour, he
  cannot giue heate, nor life; hee may giue the likenesse, but not the truth of a
  thing: he painteth snow which is not cold, fire which doth not burne, birds
  which doe not flie, beasts which doe not goe: hee will paint a S.
  Hierome with a stone, but it shall neuer hit him on the breast; he
  will paint a Saint Francis with a discipline or whip in his hand,
  which shall neuer giue him so much as one stripe or lash on the bodie: like
  vnto that Statue which Michol put into Dauids bed, clad with
  his cloathes, which cosined the King and those that came with him: Or like vnto
  a dead man, which being beheld afarre off, seemeth to be aliue; or vnto
  Ezechiels Temple, which was fairely painted without, but within full
  of abhominations. A Painter, or a Statuarie frameth a verie perfect Image in
  the exterior parts, but the Picture doth not enter into the substance of the
  wood or marble. Nature beginneth with the inner parts,Wherein differing from Faith. it first fashioneth the
  heart, then it organeth &amp; giueth life to the other parts of the bodie.
  Whereas feigned Repentance beginneth in the outward parts of the body; but
  true, in the inward parts of the soule. Our Sauiour in the Garden had first
  great sorrow in his soule, and from thence that sweat of bloud was deriued to
  his bodie. The Hypocrite hath the appearance of a Saint, the apparell of a
  Saint, the place of a Saint, the figure of a Saint, and nothing in him which is
  not Saint-like: but like those Assisters at Christs death, that had put on his
  cloathes: Hee that shall see a common Hangman with Christs seamelesse coate
  vpon his backe, wil take him to be a second Messias. When Iacob saw
  Iosephs coat dipt in bloud, thinking some wild beast had deuoured him,
  he cried out, Tunica filij mei est, fera pessima deuorauit eum, i.
  'Tis the garment of my son, some cruell beasts hath deuoured him.
  Excellent words befitting a Garment like to our Sauiors Robes: it is the Robe
  of a Saint, but there is no more but the Robe, the rest that Beast Hypocrisie
  hath deuoured. Ieremie treating of the Gouernors of his people,
  saith, That they labored to seeme Saints, but their wings were full of the
  bloud of the Poore; In alis suis inuentus est sanguis Pauperum, i.
  The bloud of the Poore was found in his wings.
                  
                     Hier. 2.34. Now he vnderstandeth by those wings,
  the spreading of those venerable vales or cowls which the Pharisees vsed.
  Againe, hee alludes vnto those wings of the Eagle, a Bird of a beautifull wing,
  but when you come neere thereunto, you shall see it bespotted with the bloud of
  those birds which she hath preyed vpon. In 
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                   
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                   
                   an Hypocrite, you
  shall behold a venerable bonnet, a Saint-like looke, a frequenting of Prayer
  and Sermons with a great deale of seeming deuotion; but their bowels are
  mercilesse, festred within them, and besmeered with bloud; Nolumus
  spoliari, sed superuestiri, We wil not be stripped, but ouercloathed.
  Saint Paul there treateth of that vnwillingnes wherwith the soule is
  stript of the bodie. But as to put on a new shirt or doublet you must take off
  the old one; so, to apparel our selues for Heauen, we must put off these our
  earthly robes. We naturally desire to cast vpon our cloathes to our backe a
  cloake of glorie; this is the desire of the Hypocrite, vpon those outward
  raiments of ambition, of couetousnesse, of wantonnesse (which he will not
  strip himselfe of) he would haue the cloake of his loue to God, of hearing
  Sermons, of frequenting the Communion, of contemplation, of Prayer, &amp;
  Mortification. This is to sell a boxe of Ratsbane with a little anisseed
  strow'd on the the top of it. In a word, As the Deuil doth transfigure
  himselfe into an Angell of light, being but darkenesse it selfe; so the
  Hypocrite being vice it selfe, would transforme himselfe into vertue and
  holinesse. But God hath sworne, that hee will plucke their maskes and visards
  from off their faces, and leaue them as naked as the Crow of other birds
  feathers, and that this disguise shall be laid open, and that the beames of
  his Sun of Iustice shal melt away this painting, as waxe melteth before the
  fire, and that euerie one shall appeare at last in his owne likenesse.
               The second, and that which is most hurtfull, Is to make publique
  holinesse the stalking horse to effect the better their secret villanies. This
  Imposture is proper vnto Hereticks, immitating therein the Pharisees,
  professing great zeale, and outward sanctimonie in their words and behauiour,
  that they may the better bring to passe their euill purposes. These men (saith
  Chrysologus) make warre against the Church Mucrone Virtutis, With
  the sword of Vertue: beeing like vnto Pirates, who set vp the Flagges of
  their enemies, that they may the more safely set vpon them, and come aboord
  them vnsuspected.
               The third is, To take away from good workes the good intention
  of them. They giue almes, but not with intent to relieue the Poore; they heare
  diuine Seruice, but not to complie with the Church; they fast, but not to
  mortifie their flesh, &amp;c.
            
            
               Nolite fieri sicut hypocritae tristes. Sad, like Hypocrites,
  &amp;c.
               The Author of the imperfect Worke hath this note vpon this word
  Fieri, That it forbids thee not to be sad, but to make thy selfe so.
  Thomas vpon the word Nolite, that we should not seeme sad.
  The widdow that entreated for Absalons life sought to shed feigned
  teares, and to looke with a sad and heauie countenance: so do your Hypocrites,
  they are like your Stage-players; but as the Scepter and the Crowne is not the
  Actors that represents King Dauid; so that meagrenesse and leanenesse
  appertains not to the Hypocrite that represents the poenitent. Genua mea
  infirmata sunt à jeiunio, His legges grew weake with fasting, not
  with feigning to fast: but the Hypocrite desires to be fat, though he would
  make a shew of fasting.
            
            
               
                  Exterminant enim facies suas. They wryth their
  faces.
               Saint Hierome translates it Demoliuntur; Saint
  Chrysostome, Corrumpunt: and as a woman vseth to martirise &amp; soke
  her face for to seeme faire; so the Hypocrite to seeme poenitent doth lay great
  burthens on his backe, onely for vaine glorie. Saint Bernard calleth

                  Thomas figures forth the Deuill vnto vs by

  neckes.
               The second, The Rod wherewith he scourgeth them.
               The third, That Scepter and command wherewith he encreaseth his
  tributes and intollerable taxes.
               All these our Sauiour Christ ouerthrew by his comming,
  
                     •
                  eauing him more tormented than
  euer heretofore; for to him there is no torment comparable to that, aswhen a
  man is freed from his torment. And therefore when Christ commanded him to goe
  out of a man whom he tormented, he told him, Quid mihi &amp; tibi Iesu
  Nazarene? Venisti ante tempus torquere nos?
                  
                     Mat. 8. v. 29. i.What hast thou to
  doe with vs Iesus of Nazareth? art thou come to torment vs before our
  time. The thrusting of the Deuil out tormented not the man, but him: it is
  Gods prouidence ouer vs, to seeke to draw vs to serue him truly without
  dissimulation; but Hypocrites,Popular applause not to be
 affected. 
                  Exterminant facies suas, vt appareant hominibus
  jeiunantes, i. They put their faces out of fashion, that they may
  appeare vnto men to fast; it is a kind of Inchantment which worketh vpon
  them, to gaine the good opinion of men. Saul made light esteem of it,
  that Samuel should honour him before the People, ballancing this
  against Gods reprobation of him. Honour is a good thing, which though God be
  desirous to haue wholly to himselfe, yet is it not to bee condemned in man, but
  it hath it's restraint and its bridle; the danger is in making the bridle the
  spurre, and so to jerke out beyond our bounds. To vse it moderately and
  modestly, and to Gods glorie, it is good, and much good may it doe thee; but
  that thou shouldest liue vpon the depēdency of man, &amp; become the captiue
  of common opinion, &amp; only to esteem of popular applause, &amp;c. this is
  vtterly vnlawfull, &amp; meerely Pharasaicall. Saint Austen sheweth
  That Hypocrites fish with a golden hooke, where ordinarily the profit doth not
  quit the cost.
            
            
               Verily I say vnto you, they haue receiued their
  reward.
               
                  Petrus Chrisologus noteth, That Christ calles that a
  receiuing of a reward,
                     Chrys. Serm. 7. which
  was the loosing of it. That Fasting which is rented forth to the eyes of man,
  is not to expectany payment from the hands of God. Thou doest either sel or
  hire out thy house, thou settest vp a bill, thou either mak'st sale of it, or
  rent'st it out for a thousand ducats to Iohn, it were madnesse in thee
  to pretend to recouer the same of Peter, who did neither hire nor buy
  it of thee. A woman desires to seeme faire, she seemeth so, and is so
  esteemed; her ambition is to please, she hath her wish: she hath already
  receiued the recompence of her desire, what can she expect more? God calls vpon
  thee to serue him, thou wilt not, but wilt serue the world, What canst thou
  then demand at his hands?

                  Nonne ex denario conuenisti mecum? tolle quod tuum est, i.
  Didst thou not agree with me for a penny? take what is thy owne. You
  know whose saying it was, and vpon what occasion. The pay which the Hypocrite
  requireth, is, the applause of the world, he hath receiued that alreadie, and
  therefore can aske no more. Where by the way I would  haue
  you to note, That if we make God the ayme of all our Workes, we thereby bind
  him so much vnto vs, that euen those which he hath not commanded vs, he will
  receiue in good part and reward them. Mary Magdalen poured forth a
  pretious box of oyntment vpon our Sauiours head. Now, if we should haue ask't
  of our Sauiour, whether he tooke much pleasure in this seruice that she did
  him, he would haue answered, No. But now that she had done it, fauoring her
  good intention, he defended her against those that murmured thereat, and
  commending this piece of seruice, he sayd, Ad sepeliendum me fecit, i.
  She did it to burie me; &amp; caused this her liberalitie to be
  published to the whole World. Dauid had a purpose to haue built a
  temple vnto God, and God accepted of his good will;1.
 King. 8.19. but yet for some reasons, willed him not to doe it,
  Tu non aedificabis mihi domum, i. Thou shalt not build me an
  House, &amp;c.
               
               
                  They haue receiued their Reward, i. Nothing,
  because the World it selfe must also come to nothing. The World is like a
  subtle beast, which makes little reckoning of him that feares him: Or like your
  In-keeper, who is more mindfull of those guests that pay him not, than those
  that haue truely payd him. The World esteemes more of one poore deuout Soule,
  that tramples all the honours thereof vnder his feet,Worldling

  Emperours which did serue and honour it with the vanitie of their
  triumphs.
            
            
               Their Reward.
               Diuers holy Saints, and graue Philosophers, haue vttered such
  Hyperboles of the shortnesse of our life, that without an Hyperbole, That which
  is to come, may in a manner bee counted as past. Seneca calls it a
  Point, and lesse than a Point. And a Point hath scarce any more being or
  duration, than what imagination or a thought will giue it. A smoke, a shadow,
  a vapour, and the like, lasts but a little while; all which, are accommodated
  to our life: But a Point indureth much lesse. And therefore Iob sayth,
  That the ioy of an Hypocrite is but a Point. And if this bee their recompence,
  Receperunt mercedem suam.
               
               Many infirmities in women, seeme greatnesse with childe, and
  promise children, but they prooue to be lyes and falshood; Like that birth of
  the Mountaines which the Poets feigned, were deliuered in the end, of a Mouse.
  He that shall see an Hypocrite clothed with apparences, with outsides of
  holinesse and vertue, will thinke that hee carries Heauen in his brest: But it
  appeareth in the end, that it was not a conception, but an infirmitie.
  Heereunto Iob alludeth, when hee sayth, Congregatio Hypocritae,
  sterilis, The posteritie and succession of an Hypocrite shall be barren;
  It shall conceiue in sorrow and bring foorth wickednesse. And as a woman after
  much paine in her trauaile, brings foorth a Monster; so the Hypocrite, after
  hee hath martyred himselfe, shall find no other birth but Hell.
            
            
               Their Reward.
               
                  The Hypocrite hath no hope of
 Heauen.It is noted, that men much resent the losse of their great and
  tedious labours. As hee, that hauing spent thirtie yeares in the Indies in
  businesses as painefull, as base and vile, and with a great-deale of toile
  hauing heaped together a hundred thousand Ducats, when he is come euen to the
  hauen and readie to land, scapes onely with his life vpon a poore planke; The
  Souldier, which after so many yeares hauing wearied out his shoulders with
  carrying his musket, when hee comes home poore, hungrie, and vnrewarded,
  &amp;c. Whence I doe note that euen these men haue some hope of Heauen; but the
  Hypocrite, who after  threescore yeares of martyrdome hath
  tired himselfe, hath no hope of Heauen, but dyes desperate, breathing
  
                     〈◊〉

               Christ cursed the figge-tree,
  
                     •
                  ecause hee found it without fruit,
  what would he haue done if he had found it without leaues? That diuine
  Historiographer treating of the Locusts of Aegypt, sayth, That they left
  neither fruit nor leaues on the trees, Nihil omnino virens relictū est in
  lignis, &amp; in herbis terrae. Ieremy complaines, that the sinnes of his
  people had made the Earth so barren, that there remained neither grape in
  their vineyards, figge on their fig-trees, nor leaues vpon their other plants;
  it is the badge of a bad Christian when his sins leaue neither fruit, bough,
  nor leafe to show there is hope of life in him. And therefore the Scripture in
  proofe of this point, doth in many places call an Hypocrite a Sinner.
            
            
               Tu vero vnge caput tuum, &amp; faciem tuam laua.
               
                  But doe thou annoint thy head and wash thy face. It was
  the fashion not only with the Hebrewes, but all the easterne people, to annoynt
  themselues on feastiuall dayes, &amp; when any prosperous chaunce befell them:
  But it is both Saint Chrisostomes, and Saint Hieroms note,
  That Christ doth not so much pretend, that we should annoynt the Head, or wash
  the Face, as that we should shun the ostentation of our fasting. This Tu
  vero, But thou, hath an emphasis with it. Thou, that desirest to please
  God with thy fasting; thou, that weighest what thy workes are, being fauoured
  and accepted of God; thou, that doest not esteeme the applause of the World,
  put away that sorrow which fasting bringeth with it with tokens of ioy.
            
            
               Annoynt thy Head.
               There cannot any day bee more feastiuall and ioyfull vnto thee,
  than that wherein thou shalt offer vnto God the sacrifice of thy flesh.
               First, because the weaker and feebler it is, by so much thy
  Spirit is the stronger. According to that of Saint Paul, When I am weake,
  then am I strong.
               
               Secondly, because if at thy repentance, Heauen and the Angels
  reioyce, it is not much that thou also shouldest be glad.
               Thirdly, because thereby thou ouer-comest thy enemy, and
  triumphest ouer him. Et nemo maestus triumphat. i. No man is sad
  when he triumpheth.
               
               Fourthly, because the ioy of the Spirit is great, and maketh vs
  to continue in the seruice of God. For he that once tasteth the sweetnesse of
  louing him, hardly can forget him. Vt in eo crescatis in salutem, si tamen
  gustatis, quoniam suauis est Dominus. i. That yee may grow vp in him
  vnto saluation,
                  
                     Psal. 34.9. 
                  if so
  bee yee tast how sweet the Lord is. And this cheerefulnesse God will not
  haue in the Soule onely, but in the body also; for it is meant of both.

  wrought gold, and her rayment of needle worke. For God hauing created all,
  he will be serued with all. For this God respected Abell and his
  offering, and not Caine. And he was not pleased with him onely, for
  that hee had offered vp the best of his flocke, but for the willingnesse
  wherewith he did it, and cheerefulnesse of heart and countenance. And this put
  Cain quite out of countenance, and made him to hang the head. Who can
  offer the chaffe of his corne to God with a good face.
               
                  
                  Annoint thy head. God wil that we
  shew our selues glad &amp; cheerfull when we serue him.
                     Leuit. 10.19. 
                  Aaron was sad for the death
  of his daughters; &amp; Moses reprehending him because he had not
  eaten that day of the Sacrifice, hee told him, Quomodo potui comedere aut
  placere Deo in Ceremonijs mente lucubri? i. How could I eat or please
  God in the Ceremonies, with a mournefull mind? And the Text saith, That
  Moses rested satisfied.
                     Baruc.
 3.34. 
                  Baruc saith, That the Starres beeing called by their
  Creator, answered, Adsumus, We are here; and they did giue their
  light Cum jucunditate, With delight: God had no need of their light in
  Heauen, Lucerna eius est Agnus, His light is the Lambe; but because
  God commanded them to affoord man light, they did it cheerefully. If they
  without hope of reward serue thee with that alacritie, thou whose hope is from
  God, Vnge caput tuum, Annoint thy head.
               
               
                  Annoint thy head. The Gospell aduertiseth thee to be
  merrie, the Church, to mourne; How are these two to be reconciled? I answer,
  That all thy felicitie consisting in thy sorrow, thou mai'st verie well be
  merrie to see thy self sad. Greene wood being put vpon the fire, weepes and
  burnes; A deepe valley is cleere on the one side, and cloudie on the other.
  Mans brest is sad in one part, and ioyfull in the other: Saint Paul
  specifies two sorts of sorrow, one which growes from God,2.
 Cor. 7. the other from the world; that giues life, this, death.
  Saint Iohn sets down two sorts of death, one verie bad, the other
  verie good: so there are two sorts of sorrow,
                     Baruc.
 2. Leuit. 22. &amp;c. Baruc saith, That the soule that
  sorroweth for his sinnes giues glorie vnto God. Leuiticus commandeth,
  That they should celebrate with great solemnitie the day of expiation; Et
  affligetis animas vestras, And yee shall afflict your soules. It seemes
  not to sound well, That men should make a great Feast with afflicting their
  soules: but for Gods friend no Feast ought to be accounted so great, as to
  offer vnto him a sorrowfull and contrite heart. For as there is nothing more
  sad than sinne, so is there nothing so cheereful as to bewaile it.
               
                  Ne vidiaris hominibus jeiunans, i. That thou seeme
  not to men to fast. For herein is a great deale of danger. A Monke told
  the Abbot Macharius, I fast (quoth he) in the City in that sort, that
  it is not possible for a man to fast more in a Wildernesse: Whereunto he
  replied, For all that, I think there is lesse eaten in the wildernesse, though
  there be no eyes, as baits, to feed this thy vanitie. Our Sauior did marke out
  three sorts of Eunuchs; some by nature, some made so by the world, and some by
  God: so likewise are there three sorts of Fasters, some to preserue their
  Complexion, some for to please the World, others for Gods sake.

  sonne of such a father; Pater tuus qui videt in abscondito: who is of

  are Clay; as they that on their part had much whereof to be ashamed, but

  word Reddet indeareth the worthines of Fasting; Fast for Gods sake,
  and he wil pay thee. What greater worthinesse, than to make God thy debtor?
  Shall he see thee fast for him, and shall not he reward thee? others runne
  ouer their debts as if they did not mind them, and perhaps neuer meane to pay
  them; but God, Reddet. And therefore reade in Esay,

                  True fasting. But he disingaged himselfe of this debt,
  saying, I did not tie my selfe to these Fasts; you continue in your wickednesse
  as before, and doe yee desire then a reward for your fasting? Sanctificate

                   For in vaine (saith Saint
  Gregorie) doth the flesh forsake meat, when the soule doth not forgoe
  sinne. Saint Chrysostome noteth, That Gods pardoning of the Niniuites,
  was not onely for their fasting, but their newnesse of life: and the Text
  prooueth as much, Vidit Dominus opera eorum, quia conuersi sunt à
  vita sua mala, i. The Lord saw their workes, that they turned from
  their euill life. And in another place he saith,

                   That the honour
  of Fasting consisteth more in flying sinne, than food; and that he that fasts,

  Palate had onely sinned,

                   the Palate should haue onely fasted; but being
  that all the Sences sinned, it is reason they should all fast. Saint Basil,
  Hierome, and Ambrose treat at large of this argument.
            
            
               Nolite thesauriz are vobis thesauros in terra.
               
                  Treasure not vp treasures to your selues on earth.
  Because some men may doubt, why men may not treasure vp Treasures vpon earth;
  Saint Hilarie by these treasures vnderstandeth humane glorie, which
  hee stiled before by the name of Reward, Receperunt mercedem suam, they
  receiued their Reward. And it agreeth well with that of Saint
  Chrysostome, who saith, That the desire to treasure vp &amp; grow
  rich, ariseth not so much from the daintinesse, the delight, commoditie, &amp;
  other blessings which treasures represent vnto vs, as vaine-glorie. Why should
  a man make him beds of gold, mightie huge cupboords of massie plate,
  vnnecessarie rich wardropes, and Armies (as it were) of seruants, seeing these
  neither augment his health, nor inlarge his life, nor giue him much the more
  content? It is a fopperie of pompe (saith Seneca) whose ioy onely
  consisteth in shewing it to the world. In a word, this idle foolish pompe,
                     Senec. Ep. 110. is a sinne which leadeth many a
  noble prisoner away with him in triumph; Angells, Men, Kings, Prelates, High,
  and Low: and, as Thomas hath noted it, other vices carry away along
  with them the Deuills seruants; but this, Gods. S. Chrysostome cals
  it, The piracie of noble Persons, &amp; the Mother of Hel, which she peopleth
  and inricheth with her children.
               Likewise, this treasuring vp, may bee vnderstood of all manner
  of humane goods: For all men doe generally agree in a kind of Hypocrisie; to
  wit, to  seeme that which they are not, &amp; to promise
  that which they doe not performe: great Teasure promiseth to our immagination
  great felicitie; but the enioying thereof discouereth more deceites than
  content. And therefore Christ aduiseth,
                     Mat.
 13. That the hypocrisie of Riches should not steale away our hearts: he
  calls it Fallacia, Deceits, because all Riches are but lies and
  cosenage. Thomas expounding that place of
  Ecclesiasticus,
                  
                     Th. 1.2. Art. 1.
 ad 2. 
                  Pecuniae obediunt omnia, All things are obedient to
  Monie; sayes, Omnia corporalia, All corporall things; for
  spirituall goods are not taken with earthly riches. Againe, that it is the
  Idoll of Fooles, who know no other good, nor God.
               
                  Treasure not vp to your selues, &amp;c. In the first
  place, A man is not here forbidden to encrease his wealth by lawfull meanes:
  for besides that this is that generall occupation of the men of this world,
  Christ our Sauiour condemned the slothfull seruant that buried his Talent; and
  albeit all excesse in this kind is condemned, yet an honest meanes is not
  reprehended. Diuitias &amp; paupertatem ne dederis mihi, i. Giue
  me neither Riches nor pouertie, said Salomon; &amp; peraduenture
  the Lord said Thesauros in the plurall number, to intimate, What
  should a man do with such great Treasures for so short a life?
               In the second, He doth not forbid fathers to treasure vp for
  their childeren; for Saint Paul licenceth them so to doe, Filij
  non debent thesaurizare parentibus, sed parentes filijs, i. Children
  are not to lay vp for the parents, but parents for the children. And God
  that ingraued in the brest of married men a desire of their Posteritie,
  ingraued likewise a desire of their thriuing, and augmentation of wealth. For
  it were a wofull case that a man should leaue his children to begge their bread
  at other mens doores: that which is forbidden, is a Thesaurizate
  vobis, a heaping vp of Treasure for thy selfe onely. For that good which
  God so freely communicateth vnto thee,Onely Coue
                     
                        ••
                     usnesse forbidden. he doth not
  bestow it on thee for thy selfe onely: as God creating creatures in the earth,
  did not create them for the earths sake; so he wil not that thou shouldest
  treasure vp for thy selfe. The couetous man would haue all to himselfe, in
  punishment whereof he enioyeth it least; Thesaurisat, &amp; ignorat cui
  congregabit ea, i. He storeth vp, and knowes not for whom hee
  gathereth. The rich man hugg'd himselfe when he said, Habes multa bona
  reposita▪ in annos plurimos, i. Thou hast much goods laid vp for
  many yeares; but hee liued not to eat a bit of that aboundance. Sic
  est qui sibi thesaurisat, &amp; non est diues in Deum, i. So it is
  with him that layeth vp for himselfe, and is not rich in God. Which agrees
  well with that of Seneca,
                  
                     Sen. de
 Remedfort.
                   That a couetous man is not a man, but the chest and bag
  that keeps monie in it for other men.
               
                  Of giuing Almes.
                  But treasure vp to
  your selues treasure in Heauen, Thesaurizate vobis thesaurum in Coelo,
  &amp;c. This language of treasuring in Heauen, though it bee common to all
  the vertues, yet the Scripture doth especially attribute it to Almes. Our
  Sauior said to the young man,
                     Mat. 29. Giue
  all that thou hast to the Poore, and thou shalt find treasure in Heauen. And in
  another place, Facite vobis sacculos, qui non veterascunt, thesaurum non
  deficientem in coelis,
                  
                     Luc. 12.33.
                  Make yee Bagges which waxe not old. And Tobias councelling
  his sonne, That he should giue Almes, either much or little, according to his
  meanes, addeth withall, Praemium enim bonum thesaurizas tibi in die
  necessitatis, He layeth vp a good reward for himselfe against the time of
  neede. And it is noted by Saint Bernard,
                  Faith
 hath two wings, Pra
                        •
                     e

                      vp to Heaue

                     . Tob. 12. That Fasting flies vp to
  Heauen, with the helpe of these two wings, Prayer and Alms; Bona est
  eleemosina cum jeiunio &amp; oratione, i. Almes
  
                        •
                     s good with Fasting and with
  Prayer, saith Tobias. And Saint Gregorie, That it is not
  Fasting, to put that into thy purse which thou sparest, from thy mouth; but
  that, while thou fastest, the Poore may not starue. And this must be done with
  Praier  and thankesgiuing to God.
               
                  Vbi thesaurus, ibi cor, i. Where our Treasure is,
  there is our heart. A wise man not thinking it safe to keepe monie in his
  house, for those many perills it may run, of theeues, fire, borrowing, &amp;
  spending, puts it into some sure Bank: to hazard it by sea or land is as bad,
  if not worse, it is the prey of Pirats, &amp; a dangerous port; Statio
  male fida carinis, No trustie harbor for a ship, said the Poet, A mountain
  of theeus, a Citie without defence. That Farmer is a foole (saith Saint
  Austen) who putteth his corne into moist Granaries, where it may rot,
  or bee deuoured and consumed by the Weesell. That which most importeth thee,
  is, To place thy Treasure vpon the Poore, for they are Christs owne Banke; for
  whatsoeuer they receiue, our Sauiour accepts of it, and he secures it, and
  returnes it with vse. What saies Chrysologus? If thou wert to bee
  Ciuis perdurabilis, A durable Citizen vpon earth, it were wisely done
  in thee ro treasure vp vpon earth; but being that thou art to make a speedie
  journey for Heauen, Why wilt thou haue aboundance of that here, which shall
  occasion thy want there?
            
         
         
            THE SECOND SERMON, ON THE THVRSEDAY AFTER ASHWEDNESDAY.
            
               
                  MAT. 8. LVC. 7. 
                  When he entred into Capernaum. 
                  
                     Cum introisset Capernaum, &amp;c.
                  
               
            
            
               IN Capernaum, the Metropolis of Galilee, a city in buildings
glorious, in prouision aboundant, in reuenues rich, in people populous; in a
word, Capernaum implies all that which may expresse a place of comfort. This
Citie was then in great glorie, but neuer receiued more honour than by the
presence of Christ, &amp; the miracles that he wrought there:
                  Mat. 9. insomuch that Saint Mathew out of
this respect calls it his Citie: and Nazareth (which was the place where our
Sauiour had beene bred vp) tooke it in such dudgeon, that shee sent him that
message related by Saint Luke, Quanta audiuimus facta in Capernaum, fac
&amp; haec in Patria tua, i. The great things which we haue heard thou
hast done in Capernaum,
               
                  Luc. 4. 
               doe
them also in thine owne Countrie. Lord, art thou so liberall towards
strangers, and so short handed towards thine own Countrimen? In Capernaum thou
hast healed Peters mother  in law; many that were
tormented with Deuils, especially one woman of a talking Deuill; him that was
sicke of a dead Palsey, whom they let down through the roofe of the house; the
son of Regulus, &amp; diuers others; Let vs see thee now exercise
these thy fauours in thine own country. Rome had a hundred souldiers there in
garrison, as it had in other places of the Empire; the Captaine whereof in
regard of his office was called Centurion. This Commander had a seruant that
was sicke, whome he loued verie well. Hee sollicited our Sauiour for the curing
of this his seruant, by a third person, yet discouering therein so much
deuotion, and faith, that hee remained a chiefe Master of the faithfull in Gods
Church.
            Saint Chrysostome, &amp; Euthimius seeme to
differ about this miracle: For the one sayth, That the Centurion came and
besought him himselfe. The other, That he onely sent vnto Christ to intreat him
to doe this courtesie for him. But it beeing so difficult to beleeue two
miracles, both in Capernaum, both at one and the same time, in one Master, and
in one Seruant, let vs run along with all the rest of the Doctors, who are of
opinion, It was onely one miracle.

  King. 20.Saint Austen cleareth this controuersie. For
the Scripture (sayth he) is wont to attribute that vnto thee, which thou doost
by a third person. As when King Achab went to take possession of
Naboths Vineyard, Elias meeting with him, told him
Occidisti in super, &amp; possidisti, i. Thou hast killed him, and
art possessed of his Vineyard. The King had not killed him, but the
Queene and the Councell. But because hee was well contented therewith and
consented vnto it, hee sayd vnto him;2. Reg. c.
  8. 
               Occidisti &amp; possidisti. Nathan spake to Dauid
in the same language, Vriam Etheum occidisti gladio filiorum Amon, i.
Thou hast slaine Vrias the Hittit, with the sword of the children
of Ammon. Not that hee himselfe slue him, but because hee willed his
Captaine Ioab to doe it. The Iewes tooke away our Sauiours life by the
hands of the souldiers, and though they would haue washt their hands of it,
with a Nobis non licet interficere quenquam, i. Tis not lawfull
for vs to put any man to death. Yet Saint Peter chargeth them
therewith. Authorem vero vitae interfecistis, i. Yee haue killed
the Lord of Life. And because God was the mediate cause of his death,
Dauid tels him; Tu vero repulisti eum destruxisti &amp;
despexisti, i. Thou hast broken him off, destroid him, &amp;c. In
a word; As hee that is married by a third person, is married by himselfe: And
as hee that speakes by another, speakes by himselfe, as Kings doe by their
Embassadors; and as hee that despiseth an Embassador, despiseth him that sent
him: and as our Sauiour sayth, Qui vos audit, me audit, &amp; qui vos
spernit, me spernit, i. He that heareth you, heareth me, and hee that
despiseth you, despiseth mee. So the Centurion procuring the Antients of
Capernaum to speake to Christ for him; the Euangelist sets it downe, that hee
spake himselfe.
            
               Vice hard to be remoued.
               Accessit
Centurio, i. There came a Centurion. There are some kind of
people, that haue had so antient possession of ill, that they will hardly bee
brought to any good. Tradesmen and Merchants plead prescription for their
buying. How many yeares since (sayth Salomon) hath it beene the
custome, that the seller commends his ware, and the buyer dispraises it,
Bonum est, bonum est, dicit omnis emptor. In Receiuers and Proctors,
it hath beene an antient fashion with them, to pill and to poll; in Seruants,
to flatter; in Souldiers, to boast, robbe, and rauish. Assueti
latrocinijs, as Egesippus sayth of them. And as a Merchant can
scarce liue in the world without lying,

no more can a Souldier without sinning. In matter of gluttony, they are
Bacchusses: Effundunt se in luxum &amp; epulas, saith
Tacitus; In matter of filthy lust Priapusses; In matter of
bragging and swaggering, men  that would make a shew to
outface Hector and Achilles, or Mars himselfe; such
as will breake glasse windowes, and threaten at euerie word to kill their poore
Host; but when the enemie comes vpon them, more feareful than hares, and betake
them to their heeles. The greatest crueltie that euer was committed, was the
scourging and crucifying of Christ, And this the souldiers did; so
saith S. Iohn. In a word, that young man that lists himselfe for a
souldier, shakes hands almost with al kind of vertue. But to leaue this Theme,
that my discourse may not seeme tedious in the enumeration of their vices;
though among souldiers there are a refuse kind of sort, which Quintus
Curtius calles Purgamenta vrbium suarum, The Off-scum of
Commonwealths; yet there are many of them that are valiant, discreet,
Christian, and religious. The Scripture maketh mention of three Centurions; one
Ioseph, Decurion, a noble gentleman, who was captain of a Roman
companie when our Sauiour suffered: who scorning the power and ill will of all
Ierusalem, went boldly to begge his bodie of Pilat,
               
                  Marke 15. for to giue it burial. There was another
Centurion called Cornelius, who not knowing Christ, was so religious,
so full of good workes, so giuen to prayer, and so fearing God, that an Angel
was sent vnto him to illuminate his vnderstanding. Of another, S.
Mathew makes mention; who when the lights of Heauen were darkned, yet
his sight was so cleere, that hee saw Christ our Sauiour was the Sonne of
God,
                  Mat. 26. 
               Vere filius Dei erat
iste: Besides this Centurion we now speake of, whose Faith our Sauiour did
admire. Saint Austen celebrates another Captaine, which in the midst
of Armes tooke wonderfull care to know the things of God. But that we may not
weary our selues with counting the good ones one by one, heauen it selfe
hauing great Squadrons of souldiers; this may suffice to honor this kind of
Calling, not onely for it's Faith, but for it's loue and charitie. Many did
petition our Sauiour for their sicke brethren, children, and friends; but for a
Seruant this Centurion onely maketh suit.
            
               Puer meus jacet in domo Paraliticus.
               
                  [My child, or] my seruant lyeth at home sicke of the
  Palsey. The common saying is, Quot seruos, tot hostes, So many
  seruants, so many enemies. Iob complaineth,Of Seruants.
 Iob. 31. v. 31. That his seruants would haue eaten him
  piecemeale, Who shall giue vs of his flesh, that we may be filled. If
  they then that serue so good a Master be his enemies, who shal be his friend?
  Seneca seemeth to make the word Seruant to signifie Indifferencie,
  and that it is in the Maisters choice to make him either his friend or foe.
               In this matter there are some rules of prudence, nobilitie, and
  Christianitie.
               The first on the Masters part; who are to treat their seruant
  with much loue and kindnesse, like a brother, saith
  Ecclesiasticus:
                  
                     Eccl. 33. Eccl.
 7. and in another place indeering it more, Sit tibi quasi anima tua,
  Let him be vnto thee as thy soule; or as the Greeke hath it, Sicut tu,
  As thy selfe. Horace calls a mans friend, The one halfe of his soule:
  Sicut viscera mea suscipe, Receiue him as my owne bowells, saith Saint
  Paul, recommending his seruant Onesimus to
  Philemon. No man is a seruant by nature, and being that God might haue
  made thee of a master a seruant, how oughtest thou to respect thy seruant being
  a master? This noblenesse of nature shewed it selfe apparently in this our
  Centurion; Puer meus jacet, My child lieth sicke: hee cals his seruant
  Child, a word of loue and of kindnesse, and signifies in the originall, a
  Sonne. And Saint Luke doth expresse it with a great deale of
  tendernesse, Erat illi pretiosus, Hee was deere vnto him. Condemning
  those masters which vse their seruants as they doe their shooes, who when they
  waxe old, and are worne out, cast them out vpon the dunghill. Saint
  Paul calles these,  
                  Sine affectione, Men
  without compassion, who no sooner shall their seruant fal sick, but they
  presently bid away with him to the Hospitall: &amp; if at the day of iudgment
  God will lay to our charge, That wee did not visit the sick in other mens
  houses, What will become of vs in that day, when wee be charged with casting
  them out of our owne.
               The second, That all seruants are not so equall and alike, that
  they should deserue either like loue or vsage. Ecclesiasticus saith,
  That as fodder and the whip belong to the Asse; so doth meat and correction
  vnto a sloathful seruant: But euermore inclining more to lenitie than
  crueltie.
               The third, That a Master bee not sharpe and bitter: for there
  are manie like vnto Spiders, which turne all into poyson, good, and bad
  seruice; foolish, and discreete words, are all alike vnto them. With some
  masters (saith Macrobius) snorting and spitting are accounted
  discourtesies &amp; inciuilitie.

 de decem cord.
                   Saint Austen sayes, That it is a pride
  vnworthie mans heart, to looke to be serued with more respect by thy seruant,
  than thou doost serue thy God. If euerie one of thy fooleries and misdemeanors
  God should punish them with the rod of his wrath,
                     Senec.
 Epist. 47. what would become of thee? Seneca writing to
  Licinius, tells him, That it is a great deale of wisedome and
  discretion in a Master, to vse his seruants well.
                     Alex. 3. Ped. 11. And Clemens
  Alexandrinus, That a Master must not vse his seruants like beasts: &amp;
  that he that doth not now and then conuerse with them, and communicate his mind
  vnto them, doth not deserue to be a master.
               The fourth, That hee bee franke and liberall, and a cheerefull
  rewarder of his seruants labours. For if the light of Nature teacheth vs, That
  wee should bee good vnto our Beasts, a greater Obligation lyes vpon vs towards
  our Seruants. Plutarch taxeth Cato Censorinus (amongst his
  many other vertues) of this one inhumane action, That hee sould away his Slaues
  when they were old and vnable to doe him seruice, as Gentlemen turne those
  Horses that were for their owne Saddle, to a Mill to grind, when they grow old
  and stiffe, and are not able to trauell as they were woont to doe. In a word, a
  Master must consider, That albeit the seruants bee the foot, yet the feet are
  as needfull to goe, as the eyes to see. And the aduantage that the master hath
  of the seruant, is not of Nature, but fortune; not by his birth, for both haue
  Adam for their father on earth, and God in Heauen: Both of them say,
  Pater noster qui es in Coelis; scientes quoniam illorum &amp; vester
  Dominus est in Coelis, i. Our Father which art in heauen; knowing that
  both their and your Lord is in Heauen. Not in his bodie, for the Pope is
  made of no better dust than the poore Sexton; nor the King, than the Hangman.
  Not in regard of the Soule, for the price of their redemption were both alike:
  Not of the vnderstanding, for many slaues haue that better than they; as
  Aesop, Epictetus, and Diogenes: Not of vertue, for many
  seruants therein exceed their masters.
               
                  Duties of Seruants.But let vs descend
  now from the Masters, to the Seruants dutie, and what rules belong to them.
               The first rule is, Faithfulnesse, and Loue. Salomon
  saith, He that keepeth the Fig-tree shall eat the fruit therof;
                     Prou. 27.18. so, he that waiteth vpon his master
  shal come to honour, Instancing rather in the Fig-tree, than any other, for
  it's sweetnesse and great store of fruit; in token, that he that shall sow good
  seruices, shall reap good profit.
               The second, That he do not serue principally for his own proper
  interest; for he that serueth for profit only, and meerly to make gain of his
  master, deserueth neither cherishment nor fauour. A master stands in stead of
  God; now we  must not principally serue God for the good
  which he doth vnto vs, but as he is our God. The Scripture reporteth of
  Ioseph, That his Master hauing trusted him with the gouernment of his
  house, &amp; all his wealth, he did not deceiue him of a farthing. There are
  some seruants like your Iuy, which suckes out the sap, &amp; withereth the
  Tree whereunto it leanes, it selfe remaining fresh and greene. They are those
  Spunges which soake vp their Masters wealth, making their Masters poore, and
  themselues rich.
               The third, That a Seruant be solicitous, carefull, and
  painefull; for the sluggard, Nature abhorreth and condemneth: Vidisti
  hominem velocem? stabit coram Rege, (i.) Seest thou a man diligent in
  his businesse? hee shall stand before Kings.
                  
                     Prou. 22. v. vlt.
                   Diligence is pretious
  in all men, but most in a Seruant; Who can indure a lazie Seruant, or a dull
  Beast? The Ball was antiently the Symbole of a Seruant, according to
  Cartaneus,
                  
                     Cart. lib. de Deorum
 imaginibus.
                   The ball one while goes flying in the ayre ouer our
  heads, another, runnes as low as our feete, but neuer lies still, but is
  continually tossed too and fro. And Aristotle sayes, That a Seruant is
  Instrumentum viuum, A liuing Instrument: and as an Instrument hath not
  his owne will, but is directed by the hand of the Artificer; so a Seruant is
  not to bee at his owne will to doe what himselfe listeth, but as he is
  commanded and employed by his Master.
               If Masters and Seruants would keepe these rules, it would bee a
  happinesse for the Master to haue such a Seruant, and for the Seruant to haue
  such a Master. It hath antiently beene doubted, Why amongst men so equall by
  nature, God hath permitted so great inequalitie as there is betweene him that
  serueth, and him that commandeth? And the reason of this doubt is the more
  indeered, for that seruitude is a thing so distastful, &amp; held so great an
  ill, that many haue preferred death before it. Theodoret answereth
  thereunto,
                     Theod. lib. 2. de Prou.
                  
  That Seruitude was the curse of Sinne, and that the first Seruant in the world
  was Cham, on whom his father threwt his seuere malediction, That he
  should be a Seruant to his bretheren, Because he discouered the nakednesse
  of his father.
                  
                     Aug. lib. 19. de Ciuit.
 cap. 15. S. Austen saith in his Books De Ciuit.
  Dei, That this penaltie began from the malediction of Eue; and
  that those words, Thou shalt be vnder the power of thy Husband,
  implyed subiection and seruitude. Saint Ambrose in an Epistle which
  he writes to Simpliciarius, saith, That Seruing is sometimes taken for
  a blessing: and hee prooues it out of that which Isaac did to his
  elder sonne Esau, He blessed him, that he might serue his brother;
  hauing out of a particular prouidence and loue made Esau seruant to
  his brother, to the end that his harshnesse might bee gouerned by his
  discretion. So that wee see, that although the fortune of a Seruant (speaking
  generally) is verie bad; first, because libertie is a great good: secondly,
  because to serue a Tyrant is a great euil; yet he that hath the good hap to
  serue a good Master, is verie happie; for such a Master serues in stead of a
  Father, a Councellor, a Tutor. And this was this seruants happinesse, to haue
  so good a Master as this Centurion, heere spoken of, who saith, Puer meus
  jacet, &amp;c.

                  Benefit of Affliction. It is a consideration as
  profitable, as often repeated, That troubles and afflictions brings vs home to
  Gods House: They are like those officers that follow a fugitiue sonne or
  seruant, who bring him backe againe to his father or his master. Many meanes
  God vseth for to bring vs home vnto him, but by no meanes more than by
  affliction. Hunger draue the Prodigall home to his Father; Ioa

  the vntamed Heyfer is brought by the Goade to the Yoke. There is no Collirium
  that so opens the eyes of the soule, as miserie and trouble. The gall of the
  Fish recouered Tobias of his eye-sight; the darknesse 
   of the Whales bellie, brought Ionas forth to the
  light; the stroke of an Arrow made Alexander know he was mortall;
  Wormes made great Antiochus confesse he was no God; and the threatning
  of Elias wrought repentance in Achab: In a word,

  those eyes which prosperitie kept shut? O! how often doth the paining of the
  bodie worke the sauing of the soule? O! how often doe misfortunes, like the
  rounds in Iacobs ladder, serue to bring our soules vp to Heauen? God

  that place of Iob to bee vnderstood, Hee woundeth, and hee
  healeth, (i.) hee healeth by wounding; like your cauteries, which

  to that of Ose, Percutiet, &amp; curabit, he strikes the bodie with
  sicknesse, and with that wound he healeth the soule.
               But here by the way it is to be noted, That there is a great
  difference betwixt one sinner and another: for he that is hardned in sinne, is
  made rather worse than better by correction. And this is that which
  Esay bewaileth, where hee crieth out,
                     Esay
 1.4.5. 
                  Woe to the sinnefull Nation, a People laden with Iniquitie;
  Why should yee be stricken any more, yee will reuolt more and more: All
  the fruit that such kind of wilfull sinners reape from their punishment, is, to
  adde sinne vnto sinne; like that Slaue, who being whipt for swearing, falls
  into blaspheming. I haue smitten (saith Ieremie) your childeren in
  vaine,
                     Ierem. 2. Ier. 6. they
  receiued no correction. And in another place he compares them to reprobate
  siluer, which being put into the Crisol of affliction to be refined and
  purified, remaines fouler than before. Others there are that are tender
  hearted, and are as sensible of other mens miseries, as if themselues were in
  the same case; and iust so was it with this discreet Centurion.
               
                  Dignus est, vt illi praestes, (i.) He is worthie,
  for whom thou shouldst doe this. The Elders of the Iewes in Capernaum,
  which were sent by the Centurion vnto Christ, to beseech him to come and heale
  his seruant, acknowledged a power in our Sauior of working miracles, by that
  often experience they had made thereof, but they did not acknowledge his
  Diuinitie. And therefore they here notifie vnto Christ the great merit and
  deseruingnesse of this Centurion; which if it had beene meerely for Gods sake,
  they might the better haue pleaded it. They alledge two reasons to induce him
  thereunto.
               The first, Diligit gentem nostram, He loueth our
  Nation; which hee hath many wayes manifested by those his good deeds and
  actions towards vs; and this his loue and kindnesse bindes vs to solicite his
  cause, which good will of his ought likewise to incline you to fauour this his
  suit.
               The second, Synagogam aedificauit nobis, He hath built vs a
  Synagogue; whereby hee hath not onely shewed his good affection to the
  Iewes, but his religiousnesse also vnto God; Dignus est ergo, vt illi
  praestes, Hee therefore deserues this fauour at thy hands. Their reasons
  are both powerfull as well with man, as with God;
                     Amb.
 lib. 2. de Off

                        .
                   for Loue obligeth much. Saint Ambrose saith,
  That Nature did ingraue nothing so deepely in our hearts, as to loue him that
  loueth vs. Saint Austen saith,
                     Aug. li de Cath.
 rudinus. c. 4. Marsil. in Com. Pl. c. 8. That it is a hard
  heart that repayes not loue with loue: agreeing with that of Marcilius
  Ficinus, That Loue is Tanti pretij, a thing so vnualuable, that
  nothing can recompence it but Loue.
               First, From this ground we may gather the foulnesse of our
  dis-loue towards God: Ipse prior dilexit, saith Saint Iohn, He
  loued vs first, &amp; if he had not vouchsafed  to
  loue vs, mans brest had neuer had a stocke whereon to graft his loue towards
  him. Hauing therefore lou'd vs first, and out of his loue done vs such great
  and speciall fauours, it were extraordinarie basenesse and impietie in vs, not
  to loue him againe, hee beeing so willing to accept of our loue. Many there are
  which stand vpon it, as a point of honour, not to bestow their loue vpon euerie
  one that seekes their loue, but onely vpon those that haue giuen them some
  pledges of their loue. Now if thou doost esteeme thy loue at that rate, that
  thou wilt not conferre it vpon him to whom thou doost not owe it, yet oughtest
  thou haue the honesty to repay thy loue to him to whom thou doost owe it;
  especially being Nature abhorreth, that they that loue should not be beloued.
  Moreouer, many times thou louest those that neuer loued thee, nay, euen those
  that haue hated thee. Is it much then that thou shouldst loue him that hath
  loued thee, neuer will leaue off to loue thee, and cannot but loue, though thou
  shouldst grow cold? S. Bernard saith, That we are wonderfully
  beholding vnto Christ for the treasures of his loue, because thereby he gaue vs
  matter to worke vpon, to repay this incomparable good of Loue, with Loue. No
  other of Gods fauours towards vs can we make repayment of in the same coyne,
  onely his loue is left vnto vs to be repaid with loue.
               2 The second reason is no lesse powerfull, He hath
  built vs a Synagogue. For where some seruice hath preceded, it is as it
  were a pledge with God of fauours to bee receiued. Howbeit, in matter of
  giuing, we can gaine nothing by the hand. For, Quis prior dedid
  illi?

                     . Serm. de Mart. s. Acts,
 3. Saint Chrysostome treating of the miracle which Saint
  Peter and Saint Iohn did at the doore of the Temple called
  Beautifull, vpon that poore Cripple which begged an almes for Gods sake;
  pondereth, how boldly and securely they entered to aske a fauour in Gods House,
  who had first exercised their charity vpon the Poore, strengthning and
  preuenting those prayers of the poore, with those that they were to make
  themselues vnto God. To this end is it still in vse, that the poore lyes at
  the doore of the Temple, as the same Doctor obserueth, that the Faithfull
  entring to aske Mercie of God, for to secure their petition, that they should
  first shew Mercy. Subuenite oppresso (sayth Esay.) Before
  thou enterest into my House,Good seruice neuer vnrewarded
 with God. bestowe thine almes vpon some poore begger or other; For my
  stampe is ingrauen vpon him, hee is mine owne picture, and therefore see you
  releeue him. And then Venite, &amp; arguite me, i. Come, and
  reason with mee: If I shall not then helpe thee, challenge me for it.
  Saint Luke, recounting the resurrection of Dorcas (otherwise
  called Tabitha) sayth, That the poore and the widowes came vnto
  Peter showing him those cloathes and shirts which shee had giuen them.
  Circumdederunt eum viduae flentes, &amp; ostendentes tunicas, i.
  Widowes compassed him about, and showed him their coats, &amp;c. One
  sayd, shee gaue mee this coate, another this smocke; and God hauing receiued so
  many seruices towards the poore, from the hands of this holy Woman, it is fit
  that she should find this fauour, and that you should not sticke much vpon it
  to restore her her life; and the Text sayth, That hee presently raised her vp
  aliue. No lesse to this purpose serues that raising againe to life of the
  Widows son, which nourished the Prophet Elias. Behold, ô
  Lord,
                     Acts. 9. thou hast afflicted a poore
  Widow, that lodged mee and sustained mee for thy sake, and therfore thou art
  bound to repay her this seruice. It is one of the abuses of these times, that
  in the day of prosperity, thou neuer thinkest vpon the poore, bee he thy
  neighbour▪ or a stranger; or if thou dooest, it is but to quarrell with
  him, &amp; to murmure against him: thou neuer giuest him any thing but sharpe
  words, but if thy house shall bee visited with any misfortune of fire or
  otherwise,  or with sickenesse, thou lookest that hee
  should come vpon his knees to thee and offer thee his seruice.
               
                  The surer motiue, his owne Loue.These
  reasons did the Elders of Capernaum alledge to our Sauiour, &amp; might haue
  alledged greater than these, as his Faith, and his Deuotion. But it is noted by
  Saint Chrysostome, That they shewed themselues fooles in alledging the
  dignitie and worth of this Souldier, and forgetting the pitty and humanity of
  the Lord of Hosts. Martha and Mary were much more discreet,
  in pressing him with his Loue. For all other things whatsoeuer that we can
  alledge on our part, are to weake to bind him vnto vs.
               
                  Gods bountie towards his
 Suppliants.
                  Ego veniam &amp; curabo eum, i. I will come and
  cure him. 1. They could not haue desired a sweeter or a speedier answere.
  If a Captaine that hath beene maimed in the warres, come to one of our Princes
  heere of this World, to demand his pay, or some recompence for his seruice; hee
  shall dye a hundred deaths before they will giue him so much as one poore
  six-pence. But the Prince of Heauen, wee haue scarce represented our
  necessities vnto him, but hee presently answereth; Ego veniam &amp; curabo
  eum, i. I will come and cure him. And euen then when hee sayd I
  will goe and heale him, euen then was his health restored vnto him:
                     Cantic. 1.2. so hand in hand goes Gods Power with
  his Will. Meliora sunt vbera tua vino, i. Thy breasts are better
  than wine, sayd the Spouse to her Beloued. Wherein, wee are to weigh the
  facilitie and the easinesse wherewith the brest affoords it milke, and the
  paines and difficultie wherewith the grapes yeeld foorth their wine. For wee
  must first gather them, then tread them, then squiese them in the Presse, then
  poure them from one vessell into another, &amp;c. And therefore is it sayd, Thy
  milke is of more worth, than all the wine in the World; not onely for it's
  pleasantnesse and sweetnesse, but for it's readinesse at hand. Esay
  pointing at this readinesse in God, sayth, Ad vocem clamoris, statim
  respondebit tibi, i. Hee will answere out of hand the voice of thy
  crie. Assure thy selfe hee is so pittifull, that he will not suffer thee
  to weepe and mourne. But thou shalt scarce haue called vnto him, when straight
  thou shalt haue an answere. Whereas, to the Princes of this World, thou shalt
  put vp a thousand memorials, and shalt haue so many more references, order vpon
  order, and yet no order taken for thee. But the Prince of Heauen, Statim
  respondebit tibi, i. Hee will answere out of hand.
               
               
                  I will come and heale him. Hee might haue recommended
  this businesse to Saint Peter, or Saint Iohn: But that which
  a Prince can performe in his own person, hee ought not to remit the same to
  his Ministers, though they should bee as faithfull vnto him as Peter.
  For the seruant many times carries not that soule along with him as his Master
  hath: and in case the seruant should blurre and soile his for his owne priuate
  gaine, this doth not excuse the Master. A Prince may well giue power in
  causa propria, i. in his owne cause, for a thousand things to his
  Minister; but for those particular obligations that concerne his conscience,
  hee cannot, nor ought not. Quodcunque potest facere manus tua instanter
  operari, i. Whatsoeuer thy hand findeth to doe,
                  
                     Eccl. 9.10. 
                  doe it with thy might. The
  word here to be weighed, is manus tua, not another mans, but thine
  owne.
               2 It causeth no small admiration, that a King should call
  twice vpon him for his sonne,The poore more respected of
 God many times than the rich. and yet hee excused himselfe; and that a
  Souldier should no sooner send vnto him to come vnto his seruant, but hee
  straight way answered, Ego veniam &amp; curabo eum, i. I will
  come and heale him. Wee render two reasons of this doubt made vpon this
  place: The one, That with God, sometimes more honourable is the name of the
  poore than of the rich.
                     Psal. 72.14.
                  Honorabile nomen eorum coram illo, i. Their name is pretious in
  his sight. And albeit this honour grew vp from the 
  beginning of the World: yet after that, God made himself poore for to make vs
  rich; pouertie is so exalted by him, and in that high esteeme, that men euer
  since haue lookt vpon it with other eyes than they did heretofore. Before that
  God came into the world and was made flesh, there was not that rich man which
  did not scorne and contemne the poore. Diues did lesse esteeme of
  Lazarus than of his dogges; But God making himselfe poore, and
  wrapping vp in ragges the treasure and richnesse of Heauen, the condition of
  the poore hath euer since beene better with God, than that of the rich; and
  therefore hee rather hasteth to relieue the Poore than the rich.
               And therefore the Physitions of the bodie are much
  condemned,Phisitions taxed, that will not visit the
 poore. who being the Appollo's and Aesculapij of their
  times, disdaine to visit the poore men. And so likewise are the Physitions for
  the soule, who boast themselues to be Confessors to great kings &amp; princes,
  the poore mans soule being no lesse pretious in Gods sight than those of the
  rich. Those Masters are also reproued,Masters likewise, who
 neglect their Seruants, being sicke. who scorne to visit their poore
  seruant in his sickenes, alledging (forsooth) that the chamber or the bed is
  readie to turne their stomacke, and makes them sicke with the loathsomenesse of
  the sent, when they can well enough indure the stinke of a Stable, or the
  nastinesse of a dogge-kennell.
               Secondly, we are to consider, That Humilitie carries with it a
  kind of omnipotencie, because it subdueth the Omnipotent. Of the Sunne of the
  Earth the Poets write, That wrestling with Hercules, still as he
  toucht the ground he recouered fresh strength. The humble minded man, who
  esteemes himselfe to be but the sonne of the Earth, and the off-spring of Dust
  and Ashes, by bowing himselfe in all lowlinesse to this his mother, hee shall
  bee able to wrestle with God himselfe.
               Thirdly, This readinesse of Christs towards the Centurion,
  should stirre vs vp to compassion, and to take pittie of our neighbour.

                   That there is this difference betweene him that
  imployeth his loue vpon his Neighbour, and him that bestowes it on the goods
  of the earth, that This is the poorer, That the richer. Saint
  Chrysostome declaring that place of Saint Paul, Loue seeketh not
  her own things, saith, That the Apostle spake according to the Lawes and
  rules of the world, where euery one holds that particular wealth he possesseth
  to be his owne; but according to the Lawes of God, Loue seekes the things
  that are her own; for shee reckons of that good that befalls another, as
  her owne. Our Sauiour treating of pardoning others, said on the Crosse,
                     Luc. 23. v. 34. Mat. 27. v.

  him; &amp; for this cause cals him for their sakes Father, as if he should haue
  said, O my good God, I desire thou wouldst shew the bowels of a father towards
  them; as for mine owne life, be thou a seuere God vnto me, let me suffer, so as
  they may liue. And this is Spiritus Sanctorum, The Spirit of the
  Saints, the nature of those that are Gods children. Elizeus
  offered to goe to the Pallace, for his Hostesse, Vis vt loquar Regi? Wilt
  thou that I speak to the King? when he would not goe thither for himselfe.
  Thomas, who would not haue Clergie men to ouer-busie themselues in
  the world; yet he aduiseth them to speake vnto Princes and Councellors of
  State, in matters of pittie, when the poore are oppressed, and haue no bodie to
  speake for them, and that they should do it, Not out of coue
                     •
                  ousnesse, but charitie.
            
            
               
               Iesus autem ibat cum illis; &amp; cum jam longe esset
  à domo, misit Centurio amicos, dicens, Noli vexari.
               
               
                  Trouble not thy selfe. Presently after Christ had giuen
  the Elders so faire an answere, hee went along in their companie towards the
  Centurions house; some went before to aduise him of his comming, though the
  Euangelists doe not mention it; who found himselfe so hindered by the Maiestie
  and greatnesse of our Sauiour Christ (whom he beleeued to be God) that hee
  sent some friends of his that were Gentiles, in all hast to our Sauiour, with
  this message, Lord trouble not thy selfe.
               Some man may doubt, Why he should say by these second
  Messengers, Domine noli vexari, hauing entreated by the former to
  come vnto him? I answer, That the same humilitie which the Centurion shewed
  afterwards, hee would haue shewne before that he said vnto him, Lord, trouble
  not thy selfe: For he that would not haue had him take the paines to come,
  would not haue sent vnto him, to will him that he should come; for hee
  beleeuing him to bee God, it had beene an vnciuile Embassage. But the Elders of
  the Iewes setting a good face on the matter, and taking the authoritie vpon
  them, that they were of power to bring our Sauiour to the Captaines house,
  shewed therein more vanitie than faith, for that they did not beleeue that our
  Sauiour could cure the sicke being absent; and so were the authors of this
  discourtesie. Besides, they proceeded f
                     •
                  rther with him in a commanding kind of language; alledging, That
  the Centurion deserued this fauour at his hands, though hee himselfe
  acknowledged his owne vnworthinesse, not onely by these his second messengers,
  but by himselfe: For I assure my selfe, and hold it for certaine, That the
  Centurion in the end spake vnto Christ our Sauiour, repeating that lesson
  himselfe, which he had instructed his Embassadours in, when they said vnto him,
  Domine, noli vexari, i. Lord trouble not thy selfe. Saint
  Ambrose saith, That the name of (Lord) sometimes signifies honour,
  sometimes power; and that in men these two goe diuided, but in God they goe
  ioyntly together. Here we call him a Lord, that is so indeed, for that power
  and command that he hath ouer others; and sometimes we call him Lord that is
  no Lord, but doe it out of courtesie, onely to honour him the more. Nor is this
  in the Scripture any strange kind of language. Rebecka called her
  Seruant, Sir, or Lord; and Marie Magdalen vsed the same stile to our
  Sauiour,
                     Iohn. 20. taking him at that time
  for a Gardner. And although this name bee due vnto our Sauiour both manner of
  wayes, and may well challenge this double title, though some call him onely by
  the first, being desirous to honour and respect him,
                     Iohn. 4. Iohn 5. as Regulus; Lord,
  come downe before my sonne die: and as hee that lay at the Fish-poole, and
  could not help himselfe, Lord I haue no man, &amp;c. Others,
                     Iohn. 10. by both; as Saint Thomas, Domine
  mî, &amp; Deus mî. And the Centurion beleeuing through Faith,
  that he was God and Man, on the one part passible and fatigable, and on the
  other, impassible, and indefatigable: the one way he stiles him Lord; the
  other, he entreats him, That he would spare himselfe that trouble, Noli
  vexari, or as the Greeke hath it, Ne vexeris; which is all one
  with Ne fatigeris, Wearie not thy selfe.

                  I am not worthie, &amp;c. Before he said, Noli
  vexari, and now he giues the reason of it; telling our Sauiour, That his
  house is not worthie the entertaining of so great a Guest. Words of as great
  faith, as humilitie: Of great Faith, by acknowledging this his diuine
  Maiestie, vnder this vaile of his humane nature; Of great Humilitie, by
  confessing himselfe vnworthie to receiue into his house so much Vertue and
  Holinesse.
               But here is to bee noted, That there is a twofold humilitie; one
  of the vnderstanding, another of the will: that of the vnderstanding, whereby
  a man is brought to the true knowledge of his own vnworthines; that of the wil,
  wherevnto wee readily yeeld of our owne accords. To expresse this a little
  more plainely, There are some men that are humble, who are humbled by their own
  will; othersome become humble, beeing humbled by their fortune. That the
  humbled should bee humble it is no great vertue; the greater wonder were, that
  he should grow proud vpon it. But that Honour and Greatnesse should willingly
  humble it selfe, and of it's owne accord, Hoc regium est, This is an
  heroicall vertue, and beseeming Kings. What a glorie was it vnto King
  Dauid, that being so powerfull and so rich a Prince as he was, that he
  should be more meeke and humble than a child? Si non humiliter sentiebam,
  &amp;c. What a commendation in Iohn Baptist, so highly honoured
  both of Heauen and Earth, that hee should confesse himselfe vnworthie to vnlose
  the latchet of our Sauiors shooe? What shall we say of the Sonne of God, who
  being equall with his Father, willingly humbled himselfe to become his Seruant;
  teaching others this lesson, Learne of me, for I am meeke and humble of
  heart. What sayes the Preacher, The greater thou art, the lowlier be
  thy carriage. And for this is our Centurion heere commended, being so
  great a Commander as he was; For I also am a man vnder authoritie, and I
  say to one, Goe, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he commeth. Saint
  Austen saith of him, That by confessing himselfe vnworthie,
                     Aug.
 Ser. 6. de Verb. Dom.
                   he made himselfe more worthie: for
  there is no disposition so fit for the receiuing of God, as that which
  acknowledgeth and confesseth it's owne vnworthinesse.
                     Amb. Ser. 89. And Saint Ambrose beating
  vpon the same point, saith, That those houses which seemed too streight and too
  narrow to receiue our Sauiour Christ, were made large enough by confessing
  their vnworthinesse to receiue him. But here doth that place of Saint
  Paul offer it selfe, He that shall eat of this Bread, and drinke
  this Cup vnworthily, shall bee guiltie of the Bodie and Bloud of
  Christ.
                  1. Cor. 11. Now if hee that
  receiues Christ vnworthily shall be held guiltie of his bodie and bloud; Shall
  not hee much more be condemned, in confessing himselfe vnworthie to receiue
  him? I answer, That in the Communion there are two manner of dignities to be
  considered; one of the person which receiueth Christ our Sauiour; the other of
  the disposition and preparation wherewith hee receiueth him. Touching the 
   first dignitie, No man can receiue Christ worthily; for
  the holiest, bee hee neuer so holy, is but a creature, and there is an
  infinite distance betwixt him and his Creator. But touching that other
  dignitie, of preparation and disposition, a man may receiue him worthily, by
  doing that which God commandeth vs to doe for the better receiuing of him. A
  Husbandman can hardly receiue his King worthily, in respect of his house, and
  his person, by reason of the great disequalitie between them; but in respect of
  his preparation, doing that which he is commanded to doe on his part, as to see
  the house bee cleane, and euerie thing in good order; so may he receiue him
  worthily.
            
            
               Sed tantum dic verbo, &amp; sanabitur Puer meus.
               
                  Onely say the word, and my Seruant shall be whole. Sir,
  trouble not your selfe, in comming to a House vnworthie so great a fauour, But
  halfe a word from your mouth will be sufficient to cure my Seruant. Yet doth
  hee not hereby signifie that his word was necessarie, since that without his
  word, and without his comming, his will was sufficient: and all this did the
  Centurions Faith procure; but he would signifie thereby, that it was in his
  power to doe it, and that very easily; and it is an ordinarie phrase amongst
  vs to say, It is but a word speaking. Saint Chrysostome indeereth the
  modestie, and curteous carriage of this Captaine, that he bearing that great
  loue to his Seruant, that hee was as sencible of this his sickenesse, and the
  danger he was in, as if the case had beene his owne: He did not desire any
  indecent thing of our Sauiour, nor lash out into passion, transported by his
  affection; but proceeded therein with great prudence and sobrietie, not onely
  hauing a care to that which was fitting for his seruant, but with what respect
  also, and reuerence, hee was to carrie himselfe towards our Sauiour Christ.
               
                  The Centurions Faith.
                  Onely say
  the word, &amp;c. From hence Chrysostome proueth, That the
  Centurion did beleeue the Diuinitie of Christ: For if hee had thought him to
  bee but a Saint, and not a God, hee would haue said, I pray Sir speake a good
  word for me; but he vseth not that phrase of speech, but, That himselfe would
  command him to be whole. But it is to bee noted, That though all the antient
  Saints doe grant, That the Centurion beleeued that Christ was both God and man;
  yet Gregorie Nazianzen, Saint Chrysostome, and Saint
  Austen, doe note, That speaking absolutely of doing a miracle, with
  empire and command, is not prenda, that is, a token of God onely; for
  any man may doe the like, to whom God shal giue the power. If thou hadst (saith
  our Sauior) but so much faith as a graine of mustard seed, thou mightst command
  mountaines to remooue, and they shal obey thee: But to worke a miracle,
  commanding the same to be done by his own proper power &amp; vertue, that is a
  token of Gods power onely. And that the Centurion pretended this, it is
  prooued, first, by the great curtesie vsed by him, Lord, I am not worthie
  that thou shouldst come vnder my roofe; which was as manerly as any man
  could speake it. Secondly, because a Saint may verie well do miracles, and by
  commandement too, but so, that hee must haue this power from God: but withall,
  it shall not be lawfull for any man to craue them in that kind; for the power
  of doing miracles is neuer so tied to the will of any Saint, that he may worke
  miracles where and when he will himselfe. Thirdly, the comparison vsed by the
  Centurion, prooueth the supreme power to reside in Christ our Sauiour.
               
                  Nam &amp; ego homo sum, sub potestate constitulus, i.
  For I also am a man put in authoritie, &amp;c. Thou Lord hast
  souldiers, so haue I; thou with absolute power, I  with
  subordinate; these obey me punctually, who am but an Emperors Vicegerent; what
  shall those thee,
                     Hier. Mat. 8. Orig. Hom.
 15. in diuers. Chrys. Hom. 27. who art aboue all the Kings and
  Emperors of the earth? Saint Hierome and Origen vnderstand by
  Gods souldiers, the Angells, (whom the Scripture calls his Ministers) by whom
  he works his miracles. Saint Chrysostome vnderstands by these
  souldiers, death, life, sickenesse, and health. Saint Luke sayes,
  Hee rebuked the Feuer: the words are short, but full; but it is
  cleere, that all the creatures of God whatsoeuer, are Gods Ministers. For as he
  hath command ouer the Angells, death, life, sickenesse, health, the seas, and
  the winds; Quis hic, quia venti &amp; mare obediunt ei? Who is this, that
  the winds and the sea obey him? So he commandeth they should be called his
  soldiers, because they execute his will.
               From these words, Sub potestate constitutus, this
  moralitie may bee drawne,No honor but hath it
 burthen. That euerie subordinate dignitie implyeth subiection and
  heauinesse: I call it subordinate, being compared with a greater Monarch, vnder
  whose command the person subordinate liues; which Doctrine is so plaine, that
  it is prooued dayly by a thousand experiences: and the power of Christ himselfe
  was subordinate to that of his Father; so sayes Esay, Cuius imperium super
  humerum eius,
                  
                     Esay.
                     
                        •
                     . i. Whose gouernment
  is vpon his shoulder: so that there is not any honour which hath not a
  burthen with it, which many times makes the heart of man to ake and groane
  vnder it.
            
            
               Miratus est Iesus Fidem Centurionis.
               
                  Iesus admired the Centurions Faith.
                  
                     Aug. Epis. 101. ad Exod.
                   Admiration (as
  Saint Austen saith) proceedeth either from the ignorance of the cause
  of a thing, or from the singularitie of it. In Christ could there neither be
  the one nor the other; for hee did not onely know the faith of the Centurion,
  but had also beene the author thereof; Quis fecerat ipsam fidem,
  (saith Saint Austen) nisi ipse qui mirabatur? i. Who had
  caused that faith, but he that did admire it? So that it seemeth,
                     Aug. li. 1. de gen. Cont. Manich. c. 8.
  that this admiration is a commendation which our Sauiour gaue of the Cap
                     •
                  aines faith. For to admire a thing
  euen amongst prophane Authors, is an extraordinarie kind of commending it. For
  Christ had seene by a blessed and infused knowledge, that faith which was
  hidden in the heart of the Centurion; but because hee did manifest the same in
  his presence, admiring it, he commended it; and therefore it is said,
  Miratus est, He admired.
               
               Saint Austen on the other side distinguisheth
  Admiration from Commendation. Some things (saith he) are commended, but not
  admired; others are both commended and admired. Christ perceiuing this his
  faith, by admiring it did commend it; not for any interior admiration that was
  in himselfe; but to confirme and establish ours: For all the world might well
  wonder, to see so great faith in a Souldier. Suting with that which Saint
  Austen saith in another place,
                     Aust. li. de gen.
 cont. Manich. cap. 8. That Christ had shewne some motions and
  signes of admiration, without perturbation: being motions and signes of a
  Master, whereby he read a lecture vnto vs, that we should doe the like.
               
                  Thomas puts vpon our Sauiour, Scientiam
  experimentalem,
                  
                     Th. 3. p. q. 1
                        •
                     . an experimentall knowledge,
  and consequently, an experimentall admiration. And albeit by a blessed and
  infused kind of knowledge he did know all things, and that his wisedome could
  not erre; yet it is said of him, That he encreased in knowledge, He went
  onwards in wisedome and in stature. So that his admiring of the Centurions
  faith, was not so much his knowing of any wonderful and singular thing, but an
  experimentall knowledge thereof; as that of the Astrologer, who knowes 
   before hand that there shall bee such an eclipse; yet
  notwithstanding when it comes hee admires it. So that our Sauior hauing this
  experimental knowledge, the admiration could not be so great as otherwise it
  would haue beene, had hee not foreknowne it.
               But some man perhaps will say, I doe not see any such rare
  circumstances in the Faith and words of the Centurion, as should cause in vs
  any great admiration; for I doe not see him shed teares with Marie
  Magdalen, nor adore him with the knee, with Regulus, nor clamour
  him with importunitie, with the Cananite, &amp;c. I answer, Will yee expect
  this courtship from a souldier and a swordman? Let Ieremie and
  Daniel weepe; for a souldier, it sufficeth that he make a discreet,
  short, and full Prayer, stuft with so much loue, hope, and humilitie, as the
  Centurions was. Ioshuah that great Captaine, with a Ne
  mouearis lengthened out the Sunne, with those short words. From a Captaine
  transported with a holy zeale, will you looke for Eloquence? flowers of
  Rhetoricke? Are teares so soone drawne from a souldiers eyes? tendernesse from
  his heart? and bowing from his knees? let not these nicities and ceremonious
  curiosities preiudice our Centurions plaine language, and vnhewne behauiour;
  it was much to be commended in him, that he could so much. In a delicate
  Garden, where Art hath shewed it's vtmost, yee shall meet with Roses,
  Gillyflowers, and Fountaines of Alabaster and Iasper; but thou wilt not so
  much admire this, as if thou shouldst light on these dainties in a Desert, or
  in some craggie Mountain, where the hand of nature shall ouerdoe that of art
  and Industrie.
            
            
               Non inueni tantam fidem in Israel.
               
                  I haue not found so great Faith, no not in Israell.
  Christ turned about to the companie that were desirous to see the miracle, and
  said, I haue not found so great Faith, no not in Israell; not onely
  among the Gentiles, to whom the Captain belonged, but to the Iewes, who
  expected a Messias. This was a great commendation of the Centurion,
                     Aust.
 Ser. 74. de Temp.
                   and a seuere reprehention to the Iewes,
  and no smal exhortation to those that were to succeed them. Tantam fidem,
  So much Faith; Saint Austen renders it, Tam magnam fidem, So
  great Faith.
               
               
                  Faith how said to be great.A mans
  Faith may bee said to bee great, or little; First in regard of beleeued truths,
  and so hee that beleeues the more truths, hath the more Faith. Secondly in
  respect of the difficultie: and so hee that beleeues things of a higher nature,
  and which exceede humane capacitie, ha's the greater Faith. Christ told his
  Disciples, That they were Modicae fidei, Men of little faith, because
  they thought he could better saue them waking,
                     Mat.
 8. than sleeping. And those seruants of the Archisinagogue, beleeuing
  our Sauiour could haue cured the maid while shee was yet aliue, but that he
  could not raise her vp being dead, said, Trouble not thy selfe, the maid is
  dead. Regulus had the like beleefe, Come downe before my sonne be
  dead. Thirdly, in consideration of the arguments and reasons for it: for
  Faith runnes a contrarie course to Knowledge: This is the greater and more
  perfect, the more it is strengthened by force of argument, and the more knowne
  demonstrations are made of it: That, the lesser &amp; weaker they are. And
  therfore Christ taxeth the Iewes, that they would not beleeue without miracles,
  Vnlesse yee see signes and wonders yee will not beleeue. Fourthly,
  because of it's firmenesse, and it's constancie; for that Faith which indureth
  most persecutions, temptations, and contradictions, is so much the greater. To
  the Cananitish woman our Sauiour said, O woman, great is thy Faith:
  for beeing beaten with so many putby's, &amp; disgraces, like a rock she stood
  strongly to it, &amp; could not bee remoued.  But for those
  that beleeue at certaine times, but in time of temptation yeeld and giue off,
  of them our Sauiour saith, That they haue but small store of Faith.
               In euerie one of these kinds so great was the Centurions Faith,
  That our Sauiour said of him, Non inueni tantam fidem, I haue not found so
  much Faith, &amp;c.
               
               First of all, he did beleeue, That he could heale his Seruant,
  who now lay at the point of death. Not like the Father, who hauing his sonne
  possessed with a Deuill, spake doubtingly to our Sauiour Christ, Si quid
  potes, adjuva me,
                  
                     Marke. 9. 
                  If thou
  canst do any thing, helpe me.
               
               Secondly, he did beleeue, That he was able to cure him onely by
  his worde, or to speake better, by his Wil onely. Not like the
  Archisynagoguian, who desired him, That he would lay his hand vpon his
  daughter.
               Thirdly, hee did beleeue, That hee could cure him though hee
  were absent.
                     Math. 9. Not like
  Regulus, who was earnest with him, to make all the hast he could vnto
  his house, before his sonne were dead. Nor like Martha, who said,
  Domine, si fuisses hic frater meus non fuisset mortuus, Lord, if thou hadst
  beene here my brother had not died.
               
               Fourthly, he did beleeue, That our Sauior was God and Man.
                     Iohn. 5. Not like those that said, Homo cum
  sis, facis teipsum Deum, Thou art a man, &amp; makest thy self a God.
               
               Saint Hierome seemes to bee of opinion, That this his
  Faith did not reach so farre as the mysterie of the Trinitie: but it was
  much,
                     Hiero. lib. ad
                        
                           •
                        ers. Lusif.
                   that such a freshwater Souldier should on
  the sudden attaine to the highest of that knowledge.
               Great likewise was his Faith in regard of the difficultie. What
  greater difficultie, than to beleeue, That that man, on the one side so
  passible and subiect to paine, was on the other side so powerfull and
  impassible? This was it that was foolishnesse to the Gentiles, and a scandall
  to the Iewes.
               It was likewise great, in regard of those slender arguments and
  reasons to mooue him thereunto: For he had neither read the Scriptures, nor the
  Prophecies that were of him, nor did know Christ, but by the fame &amp; report
  that went of him, nor had seene many of his miracles, for Christ had not then
  done many. As it is noted by Saint Chrysostome.
                  
                     Chrisost. Hom. 22. Imper
                           •
                        .
                  
               
               It was also great, in regard of it's firmenesse and constancie,
  as Origen hath obserued; for our Sauiour proou'd and try'd him, as hee
  did Abraham, and as he did the woman of Canaan, when he said Ego
  veniam &amp; curabo eum, I will come and heale him. This was a great
  proofe of his Faith, but hee was as firme as the Rocke; so that in euerie one
  of these respects his Faith was great.
               If any man shall aske, How great (I pray) was this Faith of his?
  I answere, Greater than Christ found in the People of Israell, to whom he had
  preached, and for whose sake he had wrought so many miracles.
  Tertullian declareth this greatnesse of Faith in that manner, that the
  comparison cutteth not off the Patriarkes alreadie past, nor the Israelites to
  come; but extendeth it selfe onely to those that were present, whose Faith he
  had made triall of.
               Secondly, for that it ranne greater difficultie than that of his
  Apostles and Disciples; in regard of those lesse forcible arguments and reasons
  to leade him thereunto; as also in respect of that small paines that had beene
  taken with him: For Christ sought after his Apostles and Disciples, and tooke
  them from their Trades and occupations, manifesting his glorie vnto them.
  According to that of Saint Iohn, Manifestauit gloriam suam, &amp;
  crediderunt discipuli eius, He manifested his glorie, and his Disciples
  beleeued. But the Centurion was inuited onely by his Faith, to acknowledge
  Christ, and to beleeue truly in him.
               Lastly, his Faith was greater in it's proportion; As our Sauiour
  said, That the  mustard-plant was greater for it's
  proportion, than all the other trees of the field: so by the way of proportion
  was the Centurions faith, in regard that he was a souldier, an vnletter'd man,
  as also in respect of those few miracles which he had seene, in comparison of
  the Iewes.
            
            
               Amen dieo vobis, quod multi ab Oriente venient.
               
                  The calling of the Gentiles.
                  Verily
  I say vnto you, many shall come from the East. Here he foretelleth the
  conuersion of the Gentiles, and the reprobation of the Iewes; many times
  forespecified by the Prophets, by fitting metaphors; as going out of drie
  Deserts, into Pooles &amp; Riuers of water; from amidst bushes and thornes,
  into green fields &amp; pleasing meadows. When the waters of Iordan were driuen
  back, twelue stones were taken out of the bed of that Riuer, for a memoriall of
  that so famous a miracle; and twelue other put there in their plae: so that the
  wet stones became drie, and the drie wet; which was a type and a figure, that
  many sonnes should be cast downe into the dungeon prepared for slaues, and many
  Slaues should enioy the libertie and freedome of children and sonnes: According
  to that of Deuteronomie, The Stranger shall come to be Lord, and the
  Lord become his seruant,
                     Deut. 28. v.
 43. 
                  Aduena erit sublimior, The Stranger shall be the
  nobler.
               
            
            
               Sicut credidisti fiat tibi, &amp; sanatus est puer ex illa
  hora.
               
                  Be it vnto thee as thou hast beleeued. To him that hath
  but so much Faith as a graine of mustard-seed, our Sauiour hath promised so
  much power, that he shall be able to remooue mountains:
                     Mat. 1
                        •
                     . 
                  Si habueritis tantam fidem sicut granum synapis,
  &amp;c. instancing in mountains, for that to change &amp; remoue them from
  place to place, is amongst the number of those things that are held to be
  impossible; Qui confidunt in Domino, sicut Mons Sion non commouebitur, Hee
  that trusteth in the Lord shall be like Mount Syon, which cannot be
  remooued. When one man will to another represent an impossibilitie, he
  will say, Thou wilt as soone be able to remooue yonder Mountaine. Now then, if
  to so small a Faith such great things are promised, to that the Centurions
  Faith, which was so great, it was not much, that our Sauiour Christ should
  grant him so small a courtesie, as the recouerie of his sicke Seruant.
            
         
         
            
            THE THIRD SERMON, ON THE FRYDAY AFTER ASH WEDNESDAY.
            
               
                  MAT. 5. 
                  
                     Audistis, quia dictum est Antiquis.
                   
                  Yee haue heard, how it was said to them of Old.
               
            
            
               OVr Sauiour Christ treating of the reforming of the Law,Nothing but disorder in this world. spoyled and defaced by
the false Glosses and lying Comments of the Pharisees, for so those words
seeme to infer, Non veni soluere Legem, sed adimplere, (i.) I came
not to dissolue the Law, but to fulfill it: And (as Saint
Chrysostome noteth it) promising greater, and more excellent rewards
in the Law of Grace, than the Written Law; it was fit that those Laws should be
so much the more perfect, to the end that the meanes might be answerable to
the end; and the greater the worke, the greater the reward. In this vast
Commonwealth of the world, all is disorder; the Palme is not giuen to the
actiuest, nor the Victorie to the valiantest, nor Honour to the wisest;
Vidi seruos in equis, I haue seene slaues on horsebacke, &amp;c. but
in Gods Kingdome, he beares away the Garland that fighteth best. But to come a
little neerer to the point, After that he had reformed sixe important points of
the Law, (as it is treated elswhere more at large) he comes to the Loue of our
Enemies, which is such a seeming monster to man, and carries such a firie looke
with it, that it hath much affrighted the world.
            
               
                  Dictum est Antiquis, It was said to them of
  Old.
               The Law was euer to the Delinquent, as painefull as strict; and
  as they that find themselues curbed by some penaltie, seeke by all means either
  to breake it, or 
                     •
                  o comment
  therupon, as may make best for their purpose, (a course too common with
  Hereticks:) So againe is this course of theirs crossed by those names which the
  Scripture giues vnto the Law. Ecclesiasticus cals it Alligaturam
  salutis, The Ribond or bend of Saluation, wherewith the bloud is stanched,
  and the orifice closed and shut vp. But he that is thus let bloud, the more
  foolish he is, is euer the more impatient, complaining, That it wrings him too
  hard, &amp; desires to slacken, if not vndo it. Salomon in his
  Prou. stiles it thus, A chain for thy neck. But the impatient
  man when the coller fits closer to his neck than he would haue it, 
   thrusts in his fingers betweene, to stretch it wider and
  make it more easie; the Felon to get himselfe fre
                     •
                  , fals to the filing off his Irons▪ and the Slaue,
  the ring of Iron that he bears about his neck. Moses cals it
  Testimonium, a Testimonie. Deut. saith, That the Booke of the Law was
  appointed to be put in one of the corners of the Arke of the Testament,
                     Deut. 32. 
                  That it might remaine there as a
  Court
                        •
                     rol or euidence against
  thee, &amp; as a Lieger-booke of Laws and Statutes, whereby to pronounce
  Sentence against thee. And as Moses, for the loue that he bare vnto
  the People brake those tables, as he came downe the Mountaine, wherein was the
  written Law, by the vertue and tenure wherof, there should not a man of them
  haue bin left aliue that had committed Idolatrie. So the antient Doctors,
  streightned by the rigour and strictnesse of the Law, did goe stretching and
  enlarging it at their pleasure. And there fore it is said, They haue
  scattered the Law; or (as another Translation hath it) They haue
  enlarged it.
                  
                     Deut. 33. The Law was of
  fire, In his right hand is a firie Law; and being burnt with the
  flames thereof, they went about to quench it with the water of their Glosses.
  The wine of the Law was strong, and therefore they would mixe it with the
  water of their Comments and their Lies; Thy Wine is mingled with
  water. Saint Paul speaketh a little plainer, and sayes,
  Adulterantes Verbum Dei,
                  
                     Esay 1.
                  Adulterating the Word of God; the Greeke word is Cauponantes,
  Giuing it a dash
                  ▪ a kind of Vintners, who by watring the Wine of Gods
  Word, take away it's strength and life.
               And if Vzza, but for touching the Arke wherein the Law
  was, were suddenly death-strucken, What may they then expect, who deface &amp;
  destroy the Law it self? Christ in defence of his Doctrine, said, I spake
  openly to the World; for the which he was buffetted &amp; smitten on the
  face by a base rascal: our Sauior signifying thereby, That he puts into one
  &amp; the selfe same ballance, the buffetting of his face, and the abusing of
  his Doctrine. Where by the way I would haue you consider, That the worst of
  this fault consists not in the defacing onely of the Law, but in making the
  Glosse the Text; and of meere naughtinesse, a Law.
               God complaines by Ieremie, That they did offer their
  sonnes and daughters to Moloch,
                  
                     Hier.
 7. in imitation of Abrahams Sacrifice; the circumstance of
  committing of so great a crueltie in his House, &amp; in his Temple, made the
  case more foule: for this was to make God the cloake of their abhominations,
  and to baptize their Idolatrie with the name of his seruice.Sinne euer most odious when masked with Religion When
  Pilat was to pronounce Sentence of death against our Sauiour, he said,
  I find nothing in him that deserueth it, &amp;c. But then the Iewes
  cried out, We haue a Law, and according to that Law hee ought to dy;
  though ther could be no law to take away the life of one that was innocent.
  Exceeding great was their wickednes in taking away of his life, but much more
  in making this their wickednesse a Law. It was a great sinne in Saul,
  to preserue out of couetousnesse the Heards and Flocks of Amalec; but
  a greater fault, to make of his couetousnes, Obedience &amp; Sacrifice. The
  Hereticke foundeth his Heresie vpon the Scripture; the Lawyer his vniust
  sentence vpon the Law. And as a greene glasse, the beames of the Sunne passing
  through it, makes all to seem greene; so the Flesh turneth to it's own color
  the Laws of God, &amp; preacheth as a Law from God, That we should hate our
  enemie. Whence Irenaus inferreth, That such Doctors as these are worse
  than the Deuill: for when the Deuill tempted our Sauiour Christ, he
  did not alledge a false Text, but a true, though ill interpreted; but these
  Doctors doe quote lies: Prophetae tui prophetabant mendacium, &amp;
  populus applaudebat manibus, Thy Prophets preached lies, and the people
  applauded them for it.
               
               
                  It was said to them of old. Antiquitie hath beene held
  the Fountaine of all  good things, but more partcularly of
  Wisedome. And therefore God commanded his People to take this for their guide
  and Master, viz. Thou shalt not passe the antient bounds; inquire of the
  dayes of old; Remember the times that were long agone. And the most
  antient were euer held as the treasuries of euidences,
                     Deut. 32.33. and the Rolles of Records. The
  famousest men of the world haue sought out the antientest for their
  Instructors; for, In antiquis est sapientia, &amp; multo tempore,
  prudentia. And for this cause could Salomon say, Doe not yee
  aske, why the former times were better; for this is a foolish question:
  First, because in respect of wisdome,
                     Eccl.
 7. that is not said in our times, which was not said before; Nothing
  can be said, which hath not beene said alreadie. The Comicke could
  say,
                     Eccl. 1. 
                  There is no new thing vnder
  the Sunne: and Salomon, Nor is any man able to say, This is but now
  come forth. Secondly, In regard of all other good things: for it is
  manifest, that the former times were the better; for there is no wise man that
  doth not bewaile the present. Deuteronomie complaineth, That the
  times were ill and peruerse, and the People foolish, and ill giuen. Saint
  Iohn, That wickednesse was grown to it's heigth, In maligno est
  omne, &amp;c. In a word, there is not any Ecclesiasticall Historian, nor
  Ciuile, which doth not lament the wickednesse of his Times.1. Ep. Ioh. ca. 2. 
                  Plautus commending
  Wit, compares it to Wine, which the older it is, the better it is. Many Authors
  are not now reckoned of, which shall grow famous two hundred yeres hence: &amp;
  many Painters get not that commendation they deserue, &amp; only because they
  are modern. Michael Angelo hid an Image in certaine antient
  buildings; for he knew if it were presently discouered, they would haue
  praised it for an excellent old piece of times past, till they had seene his
  name, which he had set thereunto.
               This Doctrine is verie plaine, making the comparison from the
  time of euerie one of those Lawes, Naturall, Written, and that of Grace;
  wherein they were best in their beginnings. But if the comparison be generall
  for all times whatsoeuer; howbeit in the order naturall the former were the
  better, because all things grow old, and waxe worse and worse, as is to be
  seene in Plants, Beasts, &amp; Men: yet in the order supernaturall, those times
  are the better, which Saint Paul calleth the latter: For although God
  did many great fauours in those former Ages, yet all of them put together did
  not come neere to the Incarnation and death of Christ, and those his blessed
  Sacraments. And therefore Esay said, Ne memineritis priorum, &amp;
  antiqua, ne intuamini, (i.) Doe not so much admire those things that
  were done in former times; for they are all as it were clouded and
  obscured by these that we now presently enioy. And this is prooued now at this
  day by the perfection of the Law; for antiquitie did admit the Law of a mans
  righting of himselfe, when he was wronged; of louing his friend, and hating
  his enemie: but this is now controlled and reformed.
            
            
               
                  Diliges amicum tuum. Thou shalt loue thy
  friend.
               This is a part of that commandement, That wee should loue our
  neighbor; and may seeme to be taken out of the nineteenth of
  Leuiticus, where it is said, Thou shalt loue thy friend:
  Whence Lyra presumeth they drew that contrarie argument of hating
  their enemie. This former part seemeth to be superfluous; First, because Nature
  left not any thing so deepely ingrauen in mans heart, as to loue him that
  loueth vs: And therefore a needlesse commandement to impose those things vpon
  vs, whereunto we haue a natural appetite. What need we will a man to loue
  himselfe, or a father to affect his children? And it being a naturall
  inclination in vs, to loue those that loue vs, why should this bee giuen 
   vs in charge? Diliges amicum tuum.
               
               Secondly, euery man naturally loues himselfe. Nemo vnquam
  carnem suam odio habuit. And therefore God doth not command that I should
  loue my selfe. And my friend is my second selfe;
                     Aug.
 Epist. 14.4. Cons. c. 6. or (as Saint Austen hath
  it) Dimidium animae meae, i. The halfe of my Soule. And
  therefor it was no necessary commaund, Diliges amicum tuum.
               
               Thirdly, those things that are most pretious, and most rare,
  which haue most reasons for amabilitie, as Profit, Honour, Delight, and
  Honesty, it is not needfull that we should bee willed to loue them. And as
  Laertius relates it from Socrates, The World hath not any
  thing more pretious and more louely than a Friend. Besides, our Sauiour sayth,
  Where our Treasure is, there is our Heart. And our Friend beeing so rich and
  pretious a Treasure, hee must of force steale away our Heart from vs, and
  therefore superfluous is that speech, Diliges amicum tuum.
               
               Fourthly, the essence of friendship consisteth in reciprocal
  loue, as it is determined by Thomas,
                  
                     Th.
 1.2. q. 6. Art. 5. Dam. li. 2.3. paral. c.
 105. and Damascene. And therefore loue is painted with two
  keys, in token that it did open and shut to two hearts. And therfore
  superfluous, Diliges amicum tuum.
               
               Heereunto I answere, That mans heart beeing left to it's owne
  naturall inclination, it will doubtlesse render loue for loue. But since that
  the Deuill did roote out that good Seed and sowed Tares therein, wee see, that
  in the most naturall and strictest obligations, sometimes there growes
  dis-loue. As in brother against brother, father against sonne, sonne against
  father, and in the wife against her husband, &amp;c. What thing more naturall,
  than to giue our heart vnto God, for those generall benefits of Creator,
  Redeemer, and Conseruer; and for many other particulars, which cannot bee
  summed vp? And yet the Deuill doth blot them out of our hearts, and sowes in
  stead thereof so many ingratitudes, as Heauen stands astonished therat. Though
  therfore it be a naturall thing to loue our friend, Nam &amp; Ethnici hoc
  faciunt, i. For euen the Heathens doe this, Yet the Deuill soweth
  a kind of hatred in our hearts, so abhorrible to nature, that feigned
  friendship, comes to bee doubled malice. And the world is so farre gone in this
  case, that it is now held as strange, as happy, that one friend should truely
  loue another. Hence is it, that the Scripture makes so many inuectiues against
  false friends.
                     Eccl. 6.8. Prou.
 16.29. 
                  Ecclesiasticus saith, There is a friend for his owne
  occasion, &amp; will not abide in the day of thy trouble. Salomon saith,
  Vir iniquus tentat amicum suum, i. A violent man enticeth his
  neighbour. In that chapter of false and true friendship, so many things
  are there spoken touching false friends, as very well prooue, that commandement
  was not superfluous, Diliges amicum tuum. And that which
  Chrysostome sayes, doth much fauour this doctrine; for that one of the
  reasons why God commanded man to loue his enemie, was to affoord matter of loue
  to the Will, for friends are so rare and so few, that it would remaine idle and
  vaine, if wee should not loue our enemies.
            
            
               Odio habebis inimicum tuum.

  this Law was permissiue, like the libell of Diuorce, Ad duritiam cordis
  vestri, i. For the hardnesse of your heart. So that a lesse euill
  is permitted for the auoyding of a greater. And therefore Saint Austen
  sayth, That God neuer permitted that wee should hate our enemie, but his sin;
  As thou doost hate the shadow of a figge-tree, or the wall-nut, and yet
  regardest  an image that is made of the wood thereof:

                        r. 59. de Temp. to. 10. or as thou
  takest the ring of a fire-pan by that part which is cold, and fliest from that
  which is hot and will burne thy hands. In like sort thou must loue thy enemie,
  as hee is the image of God, and hate him as hee is a sinner. And in another
  place the same Doctor sayth, That God put it in the singular number, Odio
  habebis inimicum tuum, i. Thou shalt hate thy enemy; signifying
  thereby, that wee should hate the Deuill, but not our brother. And that wee
  erre in this our hate: for it is no wisedome in vs, to hate our enemy who doth
  vs so much good, but the Deuill who doth vs so much harme.
               First then, I say, That this Law is not of God; for God is
  Loue,1. Iohn· 1. as Saint
  Iohn sayth; and Loue cannot make a Law of dis-Loue.
               Secondly, it is not pleasing vnto God; for the Scripture being
  so full of those good things, that hee did for his enemies, only to stirre vp
  mans heart, to diuine Loue; hee would not command vs to hate them. Saint
  Paul sayth,
                     Heb. 12. That the bloud
  of Christ speakes better things, than that of Abell. For this cryeth
  for vengeance, that for pardon and forgiuenesse. The bloud of a dead man is
  wont to discouer the murderer, his wounds bleeding afresh; one while it
  naturally calleth for reuenge; another, it boyles and breakes forth into flames
  at the very presence of the murderer; another, while the vitall spirits which
  the murderer left in the wounds, returne to their naturall place, and with
  great force gush foorth afresh. But bee it as it may bee, I am sure the bloud
  of Christ speaketh better things than that of Abell; for this
  discouereth the murderer; and that, in the presence of those that crucified
  him, prayed vnto God to forgiue them, as not knowing what they did.
               Thirdly, that it was contrary to Gods intention. In
  Exodus, hee commanded, that he that should meet with an Oxe of his
  enemies that was like to perish, or an Asse that was haltered &amp; intangled,
  he should helpe both the one, &amp; the other. Now hee that wills vs to be thus
  friendly to a beast, what would he wee should doe to the owner thereof?
  Nunquid Deo est cura de bobus, Hath God care of Oxen? In
  Deut. God commanded,
                     Deut. 2.3. Cle.
 Alex. lib. 2. Strom.
                   that they should not hate the Idumean
  nor the Aegiptian; who (according to Clemens Alexandrinus) were their
  notorious enemies. In the Prou. it is said, When thy enemy
  falleth, reioyce not at his ouerthrow: For God may exchange fortunes, and
  his teares may come to thy eyes, and thy ioy to his heart. And Eccl.
  tels vs, Hee that seeketh vengeance shall find vengeance.
                  
                     Prou. 24. Eccl. 28. Psal. 7.
 Tob. 4. And those that haue beene possessed with the Spirit of
  God, haue much indeared this Theame, as Dauid, Iob, Tobias, and
  diuers others.
               Fourthly, it is against the law of Nature: I aske thee, if thine
  enemie should bee appointed to bee thy iudge, thou hauing offended the Law,
  wouldest thou not hold it an vnreasonable thing? and wilt thou then bee iudge
  of thine owne wrongs? God is onely a competent judge In causis
  proprijs, i. In his owne matters. The rest, is force and
  violence.2. Reg. 21.5. The Gibeonites held
  themselues wronged by Saul, complained grieuously thereof vnto
  Dauid: Dauid demanded of them, Quid faciam vobis, i. What
  shall I doe vnto you? They replyed, Non est nobis super argento &amp;
  auro quaestio, i. Our question is not about Siluer and Gold. What
  is it then (sayd hee) that you would haue? Virum qui attriuit nos, &amp;
  oppressit inique, ita deleredebemus, vt neque vnus quidem residuus
  
                        •

  that not one should bee left of his stocke in all the borders of
  Israell.
                  Reuenge beelongs onely to God. That
  there might not so much as a cat or a dogge bee left aliue of the house of
  Saul. But where reuenge is so full of rage, and runs madde as it were,
  it is good to take the sword out of their hand, and  that
  no man may haue authoritie to reuenge his owne wrongs, be the cause neuer so
  iust and holy.3. Reg. 18. 
                  Elias
  slew foure hundred Prophets, it was Gods cause: but God did not giue him leaue
  to kill Iesabel, who had done himselfe such wrong. Saint
  Peter sentenced Ananias and Saphira, but not
  Herod, who imprisoned him, and condemned him to death. Dauid
  did not take vengeance of Shimei, for feare he should haue exceeded
  therein, as also for that it was causa propria, his owne cause. The
  Law of Nature tells vs, Quod tibi nonuis, alteri ne feceris, Doe not that
  to another, which thou wouldst not haue done to thy selfe. Tobias
  notified the same to his sonne, Quod ab alio oderis, fieri tibi vide ne tu
  aliquando facias.

                  Laertius reporteth of Aristotle, That giuing an
  almes to one that had done him many iniuries, told him, Nature, not thy
  naughtinesse, makes me to pittie thee. There was amongst the Romans a
  Marcus Marcellus, that pleaded in the Senate for his Accusers; A
  Tiberius Gracchus, a mortall enemie of the Scipio's, who
  during that their emnitie, defended them in the publique Theatre: A Marcus
  Bibulus, who hauing two of his sonnes slaine by the Gabiani, and
  Cleopatra sending the murtherers vnto him, returned them backe again
  without doing them any harm; In Athens a Plato,

                   whom
  his scholler Xenocrates accusing of diuers scandalous things, said, It
  is not possible, That him whom I loue should not loue mee againe. A
  Phocion, who dying vniustly by poyson, and beeing asked when hee had
  the cup i
                     •
                   his hand, What seruice
  he would command them to his son? answered, That hee should neuer thinke more
  of this cup, but studie to forget it. Many the like are related by
  Plutarch, Seneca, Saint Basil, and Saint
  Chrysostome.
               
               Lastly, This being no Law of God, neither as he is the Author of
  Grace, nor as the Author of Nature, it must needs bee of the Deuill, as
  Origen inferreth. For he seeing that God had engrauen in mans heart
  the law of loue, standing (out of his pride) in competition with God, he
  engraued dis-loue, and left it so imprinted in the hearts of many, that albeit
  for these many Ages, God hath hammered both Angells and Saints vpon this
  Anuile, he could neuer bring them to softnesse.
               The occasion that might mooue those antient Doctors to this Law,
  was, either for that God had commanded Saul, that he should destroy
  Amalec; or the vengeance that he tooke of Pharaoh and his
  People; or that of Leuiticus, Pursue your enemies, and they shall fall
  before you: as if to enter into a iust warre, by order from God, might
  allow a man to doe the like to his brother out of his owne will and pleasure:
  Or, for that it is commanded in Leuiticus, Thou shalt loue thy friend as
  thy selfe: Or, as Nicholaus de Lyra hath notedit, That they draw
  this consequence from Aristotle,
                  
                     Arist. 1.
 Top. cap. 8. 
                  Si amicis bene faciendum est; consequens est,
  vt inimicis sit malefaciendum: If we must doe good to our friends, then
  consequently we must doe ill to our enemies.
               
               
                  Thou shalt hate thy enemie. Whence it is to be noted,
  That that Law which gaue them licence to hate their enemie, does not giue them
  leaue to kill him: though the Deuill many times likes better of a mortall
  hatred, and a desire of reuenge, than the death of a man. For Hatred is that
  Loadstone which drawes other sinnes along with it; but the killing of a man
  doth vsually bring repentance with it, for the many disasters that attend it.
  Iudas till he had driuen his bargaine for the betraying of his
  Master, had deliuered vp his heart to the Deuill; but that was no sooner
  performed, but hee repented himselfe of  what he had done.
  Saint Chrysostome calls hatred Homicidium voluntarium. Some
  seeme to sinne meerely out of nature, (for custome is another nature) and these
  that thus sinne, sinne without a will or desire of sinning; but he that hates,
  must of force sinne with all his heart.
            
            
               Ego autem dico vobís, Diligite inimicos
  vestros.

                     Crys. Serm. 65 
                  Petrus Chrysologus
  treating of the profoundnesse of the Scripture, saith, That though a volume
  should be written vpon euerie word, it were not able to containe all the
  mysteries belonging thereunto. What shall wee say then to this word
  Ego, whose extent and birth is so great, that none can qualifie it but
  God▪ None knows the Father but the Son, nor the Sonne, but the Father; he
  alone can tel what it is. The son for to repaire the affront and infamie of his
  death, said to his Father, Clarifica me Pater, Father glorifie me: And
  Saint Ambrose hath noted it;
                     Ambr. 4.
 de fid. cap. 6. That the originall word there saith,
  Opinion &amp; Credit, rather than Glorie; as if he
  should haue said, I haue gotten thee (ô Father) among men an opinion of
  being the true God, requite me therfore in gracing me to be thy Sonne, for
  onely thou canst doe me this honour. The mouthes of men and Angells shall talke
  of his praise, but are notable to expresse the greatnesse of this attribute,
  Ego. The immensiue greatnesse of the sea is to bee seene in this, that
  so many Riuers and Fountaines issuing out of it, they doe not onely not emptie
  it, and draw it drie, but doe not so much as lessen it or diminish it one jot.
  Ego, euer since the beginning of the world, hath been the Theame of
  the Angels, Prophets, Euangelists, &amp; the Saints, but could neuer come to
  the depth of it. Damasus did shut vp in seuen verses fortie foure
  names belonging to this word, Ego.
               
               From hence we will first of all draw the authoritie of the
  Law-giuer. If the authoritie of Kings and Emperours be so great, that their
  subiects at their command aduenture vpon many foolish and desperate actions;
  How much greater is that of God? Fulgosus in his Booke de Rebus
  memorabilibus, reporteth,
                     Fulg. li. 1.
 cap. 1. That a Prince of Syria indeering to Henrie
  Count of Campania (who was come thither vpon an Embassage) the obedience of
  his souldiers; calling to one who was Sentinel to a Tower, that he should
  speedily come vnto him, presently leapt downe from off the battlements. If a
  Scipio's, Si ego iussero (If I shall command you) could preuaile so
  much with his men, What shall Gods Ego doe? who melteth the Mountaines
  like waxe, (The Mountaines did melt away like waxe,
                  
                     Psal. 58. 
                  before the face of the Lord)
  taketh away the breath of Princes, and commandeth the sea and the winds, and
  they obey: Quis est hic, quia venti &amp; mare obediunt ei? Who is
  ihis,
                  
                     Mat. 8. 
                  that the winds and the
  sea obey him? who with an Ego sum draweth honie out of stones,
  and oyle out of the hard rocke.
               
                  But I say vnto you. I, that am the Master of the world,
  who came to reforme the Law, and to vnfold the darke places of Scripture; I,
  that am Via Veritatis &amp; Vitae, The way of Truth and Life; I, that
  desire more your good than your selues: For I know how much it importeth you to
  loue your enemies; and that he that blotteth this loue out of your hearts,
  robbeth you of a wonderful rich treasure. I am the Lord that teacheth
  profitable things, and gouerns thee in the way:
                  
                     Esay 48. it is I (I say) that say vnto you,
  Loue your enemies.

               Christ our Sauiour doth counterpone his authoritie to that of
  the Law-giuers of this Law, Dictum est antiquis, Is was said to them of
  Old. You haue beleeued  lying Law-giuers, who
  prescribe it vnto you as a Law, Thou shalt hate thy enemie. But giue
  you credit vnto me, for I am a true Law giuer? It is a hard case, that truth
  should be in lesse esteeme than lying▪ Heauen, than Earth; the true God,
  than false Gods. But though they lie neuer so much at thee to hate thyne
  enemie, I shall neuer leaue beating it into your brests, That you loue your
  enemie. Laban when he pursued Iacob came verie eagerly vpon
  him at the first, with a Valet manus mea reddere malum pro malo,

                     eware thou speake not hardly against Iacob; For the God of
  Iacobs father had charged him to the contrarie. Where it is to be
  noted out of the Text, That Laban did not say, My God, but, The God of
  his father. Whence I make this conclusion, That if he that doth not take me for
  his God (for Laban was, you know, an Idolater) shall obey my command,
  and not be his owne caruer in his reuenge, What ought a Christian to do? S,
  Chrysostom seemeth to be much grieued, that in matter of iniuries and
  reuenging of wrongs, the World, the Flesh, and the Deuill should doe more with
  vs than God, to whom onely vengeance belongeth. What will not the Purse doe
  with some? with other-some, the intreatie of a great Person? Dauids
  souldiers fingers itcht, &amp; would faine haue set vpon Saul, when
  they had him cub'd vp in the caue: but Confregit illos sermonibus, He
  detained them, and wan them with good words, to let him alone; which they
  did not so much for Gods sake, as for Dauids.
               
               
                  But I say vnto you. Many presume so much on themselues,
  that they wil not sticke to suffer martyrdome, if occasion should be offered,
  and haue sometime euen sought after it: But that poore little valour which they
  experiment in themselues in matter of suffering and pardoning of iniuries, may
  bewray this their errour vnto them. For, as Saint Gregorie saith, He
  that shall faint in suffering an iniurie, Quid faceret in dolore
  poenarum? What will he doe in the midst of torment? can he suffer the
  straining of the Racke, or the rage of fire, that cannot indure a hard
  word,

 Niceph.
                   or brooke a slight iniurie? Symon Metaphrastes
  reporteth of Sapricius, That he would not pardon Nicephorus
  his enemie, no, though hee had oftentimes askt him forgiuenesse on his knees.
  He was not long after apprehended in Antiochia for a Christian, hee was
  condemned, and carried forth to be martyred; and in the way Nicephorus
  returnes againe to entreat his pardon, but could not obtaine it. Being brought
  to the place of martyrdome, hee fainted and flew backe, causing therewith so
  great a sorrow in Nicephorus, that hee cried out aloud, I am a
  Christian▪ and will die in his place.
               
               
                  But I say vnto you. S. Ambr. expounding that
  place of S. Paul, Datus est mihi &amp;c. A Goad was giuen me in the
  flesh, vnderstandeth by this pricke, the persecutions of his enemies;
  Carnis meae, that is, of mine owne Kindred and Countrie. And
  Caietane addeth, That this pricke was so necessarie for the Apostles
  saluation, that without it he had beene damned. When Saul vnderstood
  that Dauid had giuen him his life, said, I know now assuredly,
  that thou shalt raigne ouer Israel. And verie well doth that man deserue a
  Crowne, not only here on earth, but in heauen, who spareth his enemies
  life.
               
                  But I say vnto you. Antiently Lex Talionis was
  in vse with the Iewes and the Gentiles; Oculum pro oculo, dentem pro dente,
  An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
                  
                     Arist.
 Ethic. Aulus ca. 1. Alex. li. 6. c. 10. And this
  to many seemed a naturall and iust Law; as you may read in Aristotle,
  Aulus Gellius, Alexander, and others. Iulius reporteth, That the
  first of the House of the Cornelij that was burned after his death,
  was Scilla, fearing the punishment of this same Lex Talionis,
  for that hee had before pul'd his enemie  
                  Marius
  out of his graue. But our Sauiour Christ crossing this Law, saith, This was the
  Law of Old, An Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth; but I say vnto you,
  That he that shall strike you on the one cheeke, to him shall you turne the
  other. Saint Austen expounding this place, obserueth these two
  things:
                     Aust. li. de Ser. in mon. ca. 34. the
  one, That we are to answer an iniurie with two suffrings, or a double kind of
  sufferance; and that is, to turne the other cheeke. The other, That to him
  that shall strike vs on the one cheeke, we are to shew him a good countenance,
  not giuing him halfe a face, or ill face; and this is to turne the other
  cheeke. And Nazianzen addeth, That if a man had ten cheekes, he
  should turne them all vnto him.
               
                  But I say vnto you. Nothing doth more greeue a Father,
  than to see discord amongst his children, Inimicitiae fratrum parentibus
  gra
                        •
                     issimae.
                  
                     Plut. de pietat. grat fra.
                   
                  Dauid when
  news was brought him, That Absalon had killed all the Kings sonnes, he
  grieued exceedingly. Now if earthly fathers, who are but fathers in Law, haue
  so great a feeling thereof, What shall God then? Ego autem, I, who
  feele your hurtes; I, who loue euerie one of you, as if you were all but one;
  I, who preferre your wrongs before mine owne, and will sooner reuenge them, if
  you loue me; I say vnto you, D
                        •
                     ligite inimicos vestros, Loue your enemies.
               
               And that this senciblenesse may be the better perceiued, two
  differences are to be noted.
               The one, That earthly fathers doe ordinarily loue their children
  disequally,Reasons why there should be no difference among
 Christians. one better than another, I know not why nor wherefore; but
  God loueth all alike, and maketh as much of one as another. Philon
  asketh the question, Why the precepts of the Decalogue speake to euerie one in
  particular, as if they spake only to him alone Thou shalt not sweare, Thou
  shalt not steale, &amp;c. &amp; his answer is, That euerie particular person by
  himselfe is as deere vnto God, as all mankind put together: And he prooueth it
  by this, That he faith vnto euerie one, I am thy God; being the God of all.
               The second, That earthly fathers loue themselues better than
  their children; but God loues his children better than himself; his punishmēts
  are likewise lesse seuere, as we may see in Adam, and in
  Caine. Againe, in the Law of Matrimonie, to marrie with an vnbeleeuing
  wife doth not dissolue that bond, if shee consent not thereunto; Non
  dimittat illam, Let him not put her away, it is S. Pauls; but if
  she afterwards become an Adulteresse, he might be diuorced from her, and shee
  be condemned to be stoned to death. Item, in that precept, Thou shalt
  not sweare; a lawfull oath is not prohibited, for composing of differences
  betwixt neighbour and neighbour: and if in matter of profit one man shall exact
  vpon another, and will not forgiue a mite, let him assure himselfe that God
  will loose nothing of his right; For three transgressions I will
  turne,
                  
                     Amos 2. v.
                     
                        •
                     . (saith Amos)
  &amp; for foure I will not turne. Those three, were Idolatrie,
  Fornication, and Matrimonie; in degrees forbidden, offences belonging vnto
  God: The fourth were, the wrongs and iniuries done vnto our neighbour; and he
  saith, That he will pardon the one, but not the other. And therefore our
  Sauiour Christ being desirous to cut off all sedition and discord betwixt his
  beloued children, he saith, Ego autem dico vobis, diligite inimicos
  vestros, &amp;c. But I say vnto you, Loue your Enemies.
               
               
                  But I say vnto you. Many light occasions end great
  enmities.
               First, Time, which weares them out, and makes them to be quite
  forgotten.
               Secondly, New aliances, by marrying the one with the other.
               Thirdly, The great hurt that comes thereby. Two enemies at last
  perceiue, that thereby they diminish both their estates and honours; and in the
  end fal into this consideration, That if they bite one another, they shall be
  deuoured one  of another: and as it is in the Prouerbe,
  El vencido, y el vencidor perdido, The conquered i
                        •
                      crusht, and the conquerour vndone. In those
  differences betwixt Esau and Iacob, their mother said,
  Cur vtroque orbab
                        •
                     r filio in

                           •
                        .
 27.
               
               Fourthly the profit that followes thereupon. Plutarch
  hath a whole Tract De vtilitate ab inimicis capienda: and there is not
  any man, from the beginning of the world to this day, that hath receiued any
  hurt from his enemie, but from himselfe, as Saint Chrysostome prooueth
  at large.
               Fifthly, Vmpires, to whom for their honesties and authorities
  such businesses are often referred. And if these humane respects shall sway
  with thee, Why not God much more? whose authoritie, whose power, whose loue,
  whose benefits haue bound thee fast vnto him in so many linkes and chaines of
  dutie.
               And if God be not powerfull with thee, How darest thou presume
  to aske him dayly forgiuenesse of thy sinnes, when thou wilt not pardon thy
  enemie? Say thou wert without sinne, but alas, they are more than the haires of
  thy head; say thou wert exempted from punishment, or from Gods fauour; but in
  the one thou art miserable, and without the other thou canst not breath: And
  therefore seeing of necessitie thou must hourely flie vnto him for succour, and
  for his fauour, How canst thou looke him in the face? how speake thy selfe
  vnto him, or any one for thee?
                     Eccle. 28.
                  Quis exorauit pro delictis eius? Who entreateth for his offences? Thou
  wilt not haue God for thy second, how canst thou then hope to haue a second
  with God? For that seruant which owed his king ten thousand Talents, many of
  his seruants in meere pittie interceded for him at the first; but after the
  debt was forgiuen him, and that hee was readie to teare out his fellowes throat
  for a Piece of three pence, or the like trifling summe; those verie men that
  entreated for him, complained of his cruel dealing, Quis exorauit pro
  delictis eius, Who entreated for his offences? Besides, giue me leaue to
  aske thee this question, For all the il that thou wishest to thine enemie,
  thou neuer praiest vnto God, that hee should wish him ill.
               
                  But I say vnto you. This word Vobis, Vnto you,
  carries also an emphasis with it, opposit to that emphasis of Ego.
  Thou that art nothing, against him that is euerie thing: thou that vanishest
  like a shaddow, against him that is, was, and shall be: thou that art weake,
  against him that is all power and Maiestie: thou that art ignorant, against
  him that is infinitely wise.
            
            
               
                  Diligite inimicos vestros. Loue your enemies.
               
                  To loue our Enemies is against
 natureThis is the greatest temptation, and the strongest incounter that
  our flesh is put vnto. Saint Augustine, making a repetition of all the
  Commandements, none is harder to bee kept, than that of louing our Enemy, and
  brideling in the appetite of reuenge, against him that shall persecute, defame
  vs, and staine our good name, Quis enim cum inuenerit inimicum, dimittet
  eum in via bona, Who, when he findes his Enemie, will let him goe away in
  safetie? So sayd Saul: What a matter will it be then, to loue
  him, to cherish him, and to do him curtesies? Redime me a calumnijs
  hominum, vt custodiam mendata tua, (i.) Keep me from the slanders of
  men that I may keepe thy Commandements. Whereby it seemeth, that
  Dauid hauing set before him all the commandements of God, the slanders
  of his enemies did so cowe his resolution, that hee sayd; O Lord if thou doost
  not redeeme mee from this rod, I shal hardly be able to serue thee as I
  would.
               
                  Iob, being in all his afflictions a rock of constancie
  and patience, when slanders were throwne vpon him, hee was driuen quite beside
  his byas. Quae est fortitud
                        •
                      
                      mea, vt sustineam? Nunquid bonum tibi videtur, si
  calumnieris, &amp; opprimas me,
                  
                     Iob
 6.11. 
                  &amp; concilium impiorum adiuves? What is my strength, that I
  should hope, &amp;c. Ananias was a holy man, and knowne so to be
  throughout all Iudea; yet when Christ our Sauiour willed him to receiue
  Saul into his house, he made a stop,
                     Acts
 9. and blessing himselfe, said, Lord, doost not thou know that he is a
  Deuill, and an enemie to all that call vpon thy name? Hast thou forgot the ill
  he hath done in Hierusalem?
                     Ieremie 6.53.
                  Ieremie saith, That the sword of the enemie striketh a terrour in vs,
  Gladius inimici pauor in circuitu. Wisedome, That the voice of an
  enemie is vnpleasing and harsh,
                     Sap. 18.
                  Inconueniens inimicorum vox. The eyes are light and quicke in their
  looking, but when they come to looke vpon their enemie, euerie lidde weighes an
  hundred weight. And if in Nature we see such great emnitie amongst things of a
  contrarie disposition, as well with, as without life, as in cold and heate,
  moist and drie, heauie and light, white and blacke, the Sheep and the Wolfe,
  the Hare and the Greyhound, the Cocke and the Elephant, and the like; why
  should we make it so strange, that our flesh and bloud should not rise at an
  enemy that hateth vs.
               Saint Basil discouering the reason of this difficultie,
  saith,
                     Basil. Serm. de ira.
                   That there are in
  our Soule two Potentiae, or Faculties.
               The one Concupissibilis, and that desireth all that is
  good.
               The other, Irascibilis, and that seeketh to shunne all
  that is ill.
               This he compareth to a Sheepheards Curre,The
 causes why we cannot loue our enemies. that barketh at those hee
  abhorreth, thinking thereby to fray them away. The said Doctor saith further,
  That it seemeth somewhat hard, that God hauing created man Creaturam
  irascibilem, A Creature subiect to anger, he should enioyne him not to be
  angrie; nay, which is more, to loue him that shall offend him. But as the
  Sheepeheard must keepe in his Dog, that he set not vpon all that he abhorreth;
  so Reason must bridle this irascible part in man, that it breake not out
  against his enemie. But so violent are the motions of the flesh, that the very
  Saints of God, if his hand had not forcibly held them backe, had run in this
  their fury headlong into Hell.
                     Psalme 92.
                  Paulo minus (sayth Dauid, vpon the same occasion)
  habitasset in inferno anima mea, A little more (saith Dauid)
  and my soule had dwelt in hell. Againe, The loue to our enemie must
  encrease by the hate to our selues; and those iniuries that thou receiuest
  from his hand, must be vnto thee motiues to loue him; and from that wound that
  he giues thee, growes thy cure: As Saint Ambrose saith of that of our
  Sauiour Christ,
                     Amb. Ser. 3. in Psal.
 118. 
                  Vulnus inflictum erat, &amp; fluebat vnguentum, A wound was
  giuen, and the oyntment issued out. And this you will thinke a hard
  lesson, That a man must learne to ha
                     •
                  e himselfe: The difficultie is plaine; but as heauie weights
  become light, when they are counterpoysed by greater; so that heauinesse which
  Nature suffereth in louing her enemie, is made light and easie by the
  counterpoyse of Grace.
               First, we are to confesse, That this performance is not to bee
  measured by any naturall force or power of ours; for it were great pride to
  presume, That man could naturally deserue so great a reward as is prepared for
  vs, our righteousnes being no better than a stained cloath, God not crowning
  the merits of our Nature,
                     Exodus 31. but
  those his gifts of Grace that he conferreth vpon vs. Saint Austen
  saith, That God wrote the Law with his owne hand, in token, that our power of
  fulfilling it dependeth in the fauour of his hand. The shaft that flies so
  nimbly through the ayre, it is not it's owne lightnesse that causeth it's
  swiftnesse, but the arme that drawes and deliuers it. If thou shalt alledge,
  That God hath not his fauour so readie at hand, thou doost wrong God, who is
  alwaies so readie at hand, that thou canst blame no bodiebut thy selfe.
               Secondly, It is so easie and so sweete, by those fauours that
  God affoordeth,  that a man may verie well say, Iugum
  meum suaue est, &amp; onus meum leue, My yoke is pleasing, and my burthen
  light. Si dicebam motus est pes meus, (saith Dauid)
  misericordia tua adiuuabat, When I said my foot is moued, thy mercie
  helped me: He had scarce said, Lord fauour me, but his mercie presently
  followed him. Nunquid adhaeret tibi sedes iniquitatis, qui fingis laborem
  in praecepto? Art thou a tyrannicall Prince, that by making hard Lawes
  thou shouldest picke quarrells with thy Subiects, and so oppresse and vndoe
  them? No, Thou art pittyfull, franke, and liberall; for what thou commandest,
  thou accompaniest with a thousand sweete blessings.
               On the other side againe, wee doubt, how the old Law, beeing so
  heauie a burthen, and our Sauiour Christ adding thereunto a new load vpon the
  necke of that load, it may be said Iugum meum suaue est? I answer,
  That there are two kinds of easing of a burden, either by lessening the weight,
  or by adding greater strength: For a poore weake beast, foure Arroba's
  [a certaine measure in Spaine, of some sixe ga
                     •
                  lons] will bee too great a load; but for a stronger, twelue
  Arroba's will bee but a light weight: And that to the poore beast the
  burthen may seeme the lighter, the better way is to make him fat, &amp; to put
  him in heart, than wholly to quit him of his lading. To him that had beene
  eight and thirtie yeres benummed, our Sauiour sayd, Tolle grauatum tuum,
  Take vp thy bed; a sickenesse of so long continuance could not but be a
  great burden vnto him, &amp; that lay heauily vpon him; but God giuing him
  strength to endure it, it seemed light: God euermore measures our burthens by
  his Spirit.
            
            
               
                  Diligite, benefacite, orate, Loue, do good,
  pray.
               Here are three Beneficia set against three
  Damna: To wit, Of our Thoughts, our Words, and our Workes: And in the
  first place Loue is put. Some will not perhappes like so well of it, That he
  must submit himselfe so farre, as to do good vnto his enemie, and to pray for
  him. But it ought not to seeme ouer burthensome to any: for it stands not with
  reason, that Grace should bee lesse powerfull than Sinne, in those, whose
  thoughts, words, and workes tend to what is good. Saint Basil compares
  those that receiue a wrong, to the eccho, which returns you word for word, in
  the verie same Language and tone as you your selfe shall speake vnto it. But
  heerein lies the difference; that in theeccho, though the voyce may goe
  encreasing, yet the wrong doth not: But in those that thinke themselues
  wronged, that still growes more or lesse, as occasion is offered vpon replie
  of wordes. Your Bookes of Duell haue their eccho; the lye must be returned with
  a boxe on the eare; a boxe on the eare will require a bastonadoing; a
  bastonadoing the vnsheathing of the Sword; and the Sword death. God likewise
  hath his eccho; for a cursing, hee returnes a courtesie: Maledicimur,
  &amp; b
                        ••
                     efacimus, (i.) Wee
  are cursed, and yet doe good: for hate, loue; for an ill, a good turne.
  God doth not desire of thee, That thou shouldest doe more for his sake, than
  thou doost for the Deuills: Which mee thinkes is a verie fayre and mannerly
  kinde of proceeding, and such as thou canst not except against. If thou canst
  finde in thy heart to goe see a Comedie, meethinkes thou shouldest not refuse
  to goe heare a Sermon: If thou canst giue Liueries to thy Pages, it were not
  much for thee to cloath him that is naked: If thou giuest twentie Crownes when
  thou hast good lucke at play, to the standers by, it is no great matter for
  thee (God hauing blest thee with wealth) to bestow foure vpon an Hospitall: If
  thou canst be content to spend two or three houres in idle and light
  conuersation, it is a small matter for thee to conuerse  by
  Prayer halfe an houre with God; it is a thing of nothing.
                     Chrys. ser. 12. 
                  Petrus Chrysologus
  pursueth this Conceit a little further, to whom I shall referre you.
            
            
               Benefacite his qui oderunt vos, orate pro persequentibus vos.
  Doe good to them that hate you, Pray for them that hurt you.
               The offended that seekes meanes for his satisfaction, shewes hee
  hath a mind to he made friends; and God being willing to be friends with thee,
  hath inuented the meanes of Fasting, Prayer, &amp; Almes; but more particularly
  recommends here vnto thee a Benefacite, and an Orate, a Good
  turne, and a Prayer. Nature teacheth thee to repell violence with violence,
  power by power, and the sword by the sword, with a Vim vi repellere
  licet: But Grace teacheth vs another Lesson, Benefacite his
  (saith she) qui oderunt vos, orate, &amp;c. Doe good to them that hate you,
  and pray, &amp;c. Ill is hardly ouercome with il; hatred, with malice; or
  bad, with worse dealing; but with goodnesse, and with loue, with a Vince in
  bono malum, Ouercome euill with good. Plutarch reporteth, That the Wind
  and the Sunne did lay a wager, which of the two should first strip a man of his
  cloaths; for this challenge the field was appointed: the Wind stoutly bestirres
  himselfe, and furiously sets vpon his hat, cloake, jerken, and breeches, but he
  wrapping them close about him, with the helpe of his hands and teeth he kept
  himselfe vnstripped by the Wind, who could doe no good vpon him; so he giues
  off. Then comes me forth the Sunne, who came so hot vpon him, that the man
  within a verie litttle while was faine to fling off all, and to strippe
  himselfe naked. The verie selfe same heat and courage did the Sunne of
  Righteousnesse vse, in that last eclipse of his life, when from the Crosse he
  did so heat &amp; inflame the hearts of them that were present, that they did
  teare and rent their cloathes, Et Velum Templum scissum est. And as
  the barrennest ground is made fruitfull by the Husbandmans industrie; so
  goodnesse ouercommeth euill. Fortis vt mors dilectio, i. Loue is
  strong as Death: The stoutest, the valiantest, and the desperatest man
  aliue,
                     Seneca lib. 3. de be
                           •
                        ef.
                   cannot resist Death, no more can he
  Loue. Omnis natura bestiarum, domita est à natura, The nature of
  beasts is tamed by Nature. Against that harme which the Philistines
  receiued by Mice, the Princes made Mice of Gold; let thy enemie bee as
  troublesome to thee as they, mold him into Gold, and hee wil neuer hurt thee
  more. S. Chrysostome considereth the truth of this in
  Saul,
                  
                     C
                           •
                        rys. hom. 3. de Saul &amp; Dauid.
                   who bearing
  a deuelish hatred against Dauid; yet by Dauids twice
  pardoning him his life, made him as tractable as wax; and he captiuated by this
  his kindnesse, brake out into this acknowledgement, Iustior me est, He is
  iuster than I; for I returned thee il for good,A milde
 proceeding preuaileth vpon the fiercest Persons. and thou me good for
  ill. S. Chrysostome concludes this Historie with a strange endeering;
  That Dauids drawing teares out of Sauls hard heart, did cause
  him more to wonder, than did Moses and Aaron, when he strucke
  the Rocke, and the waters gushed forth. We want not examples of this Doctrine,
  euen in those things that are inuisible: The toughest Impostumes are made
  tender by Vnctions. Plinie saith, That the roughest sea is made calme
  with oyle. In the Prouince of Namurca they burne stone in stead of wood, and
  that fire will bee quenched with Oyle. Against the Impostume of hatred, the
  raging sea of an angrie brest, and the flames of a furious enemie, there is no
  better remedie than Mildnesse; Sermo mollis frangit iram, A soft answer
  mitigates wrath.
               
            
            
               Orate pro persequentibus vos.
               
                  Pray for them that persecute you. This Prayer may be
  grounded vpon two reasons
               
                  The one, That the hurt is so great to him
  that doth the wrong, that he that is wronged ought to take pittie and
  compassion of him: and beeing it is Damnum animae, The hurt of the
  soule, which the offended cannot repaire of himselfe, hee must pray vnto
  God for him, That he would be pleased to repaire it. Philon treating
  of the death of Abel saith, that Cain killed himself,
  &amp; non alterum, &amp; not another; and that Abel was not
  dead, but aliue, because he kild but the bodie, which was none of his, and left
  him his soule, which was his. And of Caine, That his bodie remained
  aliue, which was none of his, and his soule slaine, which was his▪ and
  therefore Clamat sanguis Abel, The bloud of Abel cries, &amp;c.
               
               The other, That there are some such desperate enemies, that are
  made rather worse than better by benefits; being like therein vnto Paper, which
  the more you supple it with Oyle, the stiffer it growes; or like vnto sand,
  which the more it is wet, the harder it waxeth; or like vnto an anuile, which
  is not stirred with the stroke of the hammer; or like vnto Iudas, who
  comming from the washing of our Sauiors feet, went forth afterwards with a
  greater desire for to sel and betray him: whereas being in this desperate
  case, hee should rather haue had recourse vnto God. Prayer therefore is
  proposed vnto vs, as the greatest charme and powerfullest exorcisme against the
  obstinacie &amp; rebellion of an enemie. For vpon such occasions as these,
  Prayer is woont to worke miracles. Saint Stephen prayd for those that
  stoned him to death; which wrought so powerfull an effect, that Saint
  Austen saith, That the Church is beholding in some sort, to this his
  Prayer, for the conuersion of Saint Paul. And Saint Luke,
  That the Heauens were opened hereupon vnto him, &amp; he saw Christ standing in
  glorie at the right hand of his Father. And it is worth the noting, That the
  ordinarie Language of the Scripture is, That our Sauiour Christ is said to sit
  at the right hand of God the Father: but now here in this place the word
  Stantem, Standing, is vsed, as if Christ had stood vp of purpose to
  see so rare and strange an accident, and claue the Heauens in sunder, offering
  him all the good they did containe; or that he did seeme to offer him his Seate
  (as it were) as to a child of God; vt sitis filij patris vestri, That yee
  may be the children of your Father. And this grace and fauor which God
  shewes vnto those that pray for their enemies, was peraduenture a motiue to our
  Sauiour Christ, to make that pittifull moane vpon the Crosse, bewayling the
  Iewes cruell p
                     •
                  oceeding against
  him,The example of our sauiour to moue vs vnto it.
  and praying that his death might not be layd to their charge; Pater ignosce
  illis, Father forgiue them. Hee might haue hoped, that these his
  charitable prayers would haue opened the Gates of Heauen, for the Sonne of
  Glorie to enter in: But in stead thereof the Sunne was darkened, and a blacke
  mantle (as it were, in mourning) spred ouer all the earth, whilest he himselfe
  vttered these words of discomfort, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
  me? The doores of Heauen are shut against me, &amp; my God hath forsaken
  me. But the mysterie is, That Heauen was shut against him, that it might be
  opened vnto you; and euen then was it opened to the Theefe, and to many that
  returned from Mount Caluarie, percutientes pectora sua, i. Smiting
  their brests; as also to that Centurion that said, Verè filius
  Dei erat iste, This was truly the Sonne of God.
               
               There may be rendred another reason of this our Sauiours praying
  vpon the Crosse: Which is this, That for to obtaine fauors from Gods hand,
  there is no meanes comparable to that of praying for our enemies. In me
  loquebantur, qui sedebant in Porta,
                  
                     Psal. 69.12
 13. 
                  in me psallebant, qui bibebant vinum: ego autem orationem meam
  ad te Domine tempus beneplaciti Deus. Dauid speaking there as a figure of
  Christ, saith, That his enemies sate like judges in the Gates of the Citie,
  entertaining themselues  with stories of his life, and
  that they went from Tauerne to Tauern, and from one house to another, singing
  Songs in dirision of him, descanting and playing vpon him; but I, turning
  towards God, prayed heartily for them, as knowing there was not any time fitter
  than that, for the obtaining of my request, Tempus beneplaciti, An
  acceptable time, &amp;c. The like he saith in the 180 Psalm, Pro eo,
  vt me diligerent, detrahebant mihi; They repaid my loue with hate, my good
  actions with iniuries: Ego autem orabam; But I quitted their wrongs
  with my prayers. Saint Chrysostome saith,
                     Serm.
 de Proditor. Iuda.
                   That God commanding me to pray for my enemie,
  attends therein more mine, than his good; for the prayer that I make for my
  enemie that hath done me wrongs, heapes coles vpon his head, but is a plenarie
  indulgence for all those that I haue done against my God: nor shall any thing
  at the day of judgement plead harder for vs. Now in another place hee
  saith,
                     Chris. Hom. li. 4. in Gen.
                  
  That the pleasure that God doth take in the good that we do vnto our enemies,
  is not because they deserue it, but because we should not fal into so great a
  sinne as is hatred and malice.
                     Imperf Hom. 4. in
 Mat. Hom. 27. ad populū.
                   Two prayers (saith the same
  Father) wee must neuer be vnprouided of; one for our enemie, another for our
  owne soule: For if thou shalt pray for thy enemie, though thou beggest nothing
  for thy selfe, yet shalt thou obtaine of God what thine owne heart
  desireth▪ Saint Ambrose saith, That Dauid in taking care
  for the sauing of Absalons life,
                     Ambr. in
 Apo
                           •
                        . Dauid.
                  
                  Seruate mihi puerum Absalon, Preserue me the young man Absalon, did
  assure himselfe of the victorie, and that Ioab and his souldiers would
  crie out, Kill the Traitor, runne him through, &amp;c. O what a rich, though
  secret and hidden Mine, is the pardoning of our enemie. And hereupon hang two
  things: The one, how vnpleasing a Petition it would be in Gods eares, and how
  harsh it would sound, that we call vnto him for vengeance vpon our enemie;
  desiring, that Ioabs dart may strike him through the heart. The other
  is Saint Austens, who saith, That he that of God shall entreat euill
  against euill, does himselfe that which is euill: and it comes by this meanes
  to be a double euill; two euills (I say) spring from thence, The one, that he
  does ill; the other, That he prayes ill. So that when hee that is wronged shall
  pray vnto God to destroy this ill man; God may verie well make him this
  answer, Which of the two doost thou meane? for in seeking to kill another,
  thou first killest thy selfe: Quando dicis, Deus, occide malum;
  respondebit, Quem vestrum? When thou shalt say, Lord, kill the wicked one; he
  shall answer, Which of you?
               
            
            
               Vt scitis filij Patris vestri.
               
                  That yee may bee the children of your Father. By
  louing, by doing good, by praying and pardoning thy enemies, yee shal shew
  your selues to be the sons of God. But the reuengefull, the cruell, and the
  mercilesseman, is rather a monster than any child of Gods. God is Loue, and as
  Thomas prooues it out of Dyonisius, it is Gods essentiall
  name. Therefore he that would be the sonne of Loue, and yet is a hater of his
  brother, he is a monster, and no sonne. To those children that are like vnto
  their parents, wee vse to say, Gods blessing be with ye, and make ye like vnto
  your parents in goodnesse, as in fauour. Our Sauiour called the Pharisees
  Filios Diaboli, The childeren of the Deuill, because they followed his
  humours and desire; Ille autem homicida erat ab initio, And he was a
  murtherer from the beginning. If you will therefore be Gods children, yee
  must be like vnto God. Seneca tells, That hee did good to him that did
  him ill; and cries out withall, What shall I doe? What? Why that which God did
  and does for thee, who began to doe good to thee, when thou didst not know what
  good was, nor how to esteeme it; and now thou doost know it, and that he still
  continues good vnto  thee, yet thou continuest vnthankefull
  vnto him by not acknowledging his goodnesse.
               
                  That ye may be the children of your Father. Saint
  Iohn sayth, That God gaue vs power to bee sonnes of God. This
  filiation wee first receiue in Baptisme, and is afterwards confirmed in vs,
  when God shall find this inscription ingrauen in our hearts,To be a child, and to exercise the duties of a child, not all
 one. 
                  Diligite, benefacite, orate, vt sitis filij patris vestri,
  i. Loue, Doe good, and Pray, that ye may be the children of your
  Father. I tell thee it is one thing to bee filius, a
  sonne; another, exercere filiationem, i. to performe the
  office of a sonne. A child hath vnderstanding before hee is ten yeares
  old, but he doth not put it in practise. But by pardoning, thou shalt show by
  thy workes, that thou art of those children of God, whom at thy baptisme hee
  endowed with Grace. All men desire to bee like vnto their King; Diodorus
  Siculus, reporteth of the Aethiopians, that if the King were lame,
                     Diodor. de Fabulis, Antiquis. c. 4. disfigured,
  or blinck-ey'd, they would all striue to bee as like him as they could. Our
  Sauiour Christ prayed for his enemies on the Crosse; why should yee not imitate
  him, Vt sitis filij, i. that yee may bee his children,
  &amp;c. The Crosse (sayth Nazianzene) is that bright pillar of
  fire in the wildernesse, which lights vs along in the night of this life, that
  it may teach vs the way, Pro inuidijs meis orationes fundere, i.
  to poure out a prayer against my owne Enuie.
               
               
                  That ye may bee the children, &amp;c. Saint
  Paul hath it, Quod si filij, &amp; haeredes per Deum, i.
  If children, then also heires. What? heires to so great a blessing,
  and will yee loose it for an enemie? It will ioy him much to see you suffer so
  much harme. There is nothing grieues a man more, than to see his labours lost,
  especially hauing endured great and long toyle. Wee dayly see the truth of
  this in the souldier, on the one side his body broken, and his cloths torne and
  ragged; on the other readie to famish for want of food. In Virgils
  hall, some women are feigned to draw water in siues; a fruitlesse labour. In
  the parable of the Sower our Sauiour was verie sory to see three of the foure
  parts of seed to bee lost and cast away.
                     Ezech.
 24.12. 
                  Ezechiel paints out his people in the embleme of a pot,
  which was so fouly furred within that it was impossible to make it cleane.
  Multo labore sudatum est, &amp; non exibit de ea nimia rubigo, neque per
  ignem, i. Much labour hath beene bestowed, and yet the scum of it is
  not gone out, no, not by the fire. Ieremy pictures Babilon sicke, and that
  many Phisitions going about to cure her, though they did apply vnto her many
  costly medicines, all their labour was in vaine, Curauimus Babilonem,
  &amp; non est sanata. Multiply thy seruices toward God, treasure vp
  spirituall riches, vse all diligence for to keepe a cleane Conscience; apply as
  medicines for to cure thy Soule, Teares, Fastings, Prayers, Almes, yet if thou
  doost not forgiue and pardon thy enemie, thou doost nothing. The Scripture
  speaketh of Esau, that hee could find no place for repentance, no
  though he did seeke it with Teares, (purposely citing Teares, that wee might
  consider how powerfull they are) and the reason was, for that he had a purpose
  to be reuenged on his Brother: Veniet dies luctus patris mei, i.
  My Father will dye ere long, and then I will be reuenged of him.
               
               
                  That ye may bee the children. That ye may show of what
  House you came, and what a noble Father you had.Gods
 omnipotencie seene most in his Mercie. 
                  Qui omnē potentiam suam
  parcendo maxime &amp; miserando manifestat Deus iudex, fortis, &amp;

  and shewing Pitie. Heare what Hugo de santo Victore tels you,

  When he gaue Saul his life,3. Reg.
 24. 
                  Nunc scio verè (sayd hee) quod regnaturus
  sis, i. Now know I truly, that  thou shalt
  reigne. For such a greatnesse of minde could not bee repayed with lesse
  than a Crowne. Scitote quoniam mirificauit Dominus sanctum suum, i.
  Know that the Lord hath magnified his holy one. The Hebrew letter hath
  it, Elegit sibi dominus misericordem, i. The Lord hath chosen to
  himselfe the mercifull man.
                  The practise of Mercie
 brings with it the greatest glorie. No man will offer to take my Crowne
  from mee, because God hath giuen it mee, for shewing mercie to mine Enemies.
  Dauid composed his 56. Psal. vpon that Accident which hapned
  vnto Saul at the mouth of the caue. And the title thereunto is,
  Ne disperdas insignia Dauid; or, aureolam Dauid, Doe not blot out
  the Armes of Dauid, nor take his Crowne from off his head. His
  souldiers importuned him to take away his life from him; telling him, that God
  had deliuered him into his hands. By which noble action of his (sayth Saint
  Chrysostome) hee got himselfe more glorie than when he ouercame the
  Philistine: For there hee got himselfe but the glorie of a valiant and
  venturous souldier; but here, 
                     •
                  f a
  most holy, iust, and mercifull man; there, hee read onely a lecture of
  Fortitude; here, of meekenesse, which of all other is the chiefest vertue;
  there, the dames of Hierusalem did solemnise his victorie; here, the Angells of
  Heauen; there, God shewed him a great fauour in deliuering him from the sword
  of his Enemy; here, hee did God as acceptable a piece of seruice, for that it
  was the rarer of the two. And this was it, that made God say of him; Inueni
  virum secundum cor meum, i. I haue found a man according to my owne
  heart. That great Prince Moses,
                  1.
 Reg. 11. was so hot and chollericke, that in his anger hee
  killed an Aegiptian that misused an Hebrew. Clemens Alexandrinus
  sayth, That hee dispatcht him at one blow. The day following, another Aegiptian
  standing in feare of him, sayd vnto him, Nunc occidere me vis, i.
  Wilt thou now kill me? But beeing afterwards trained vp in the schoole
  of God, neuer any man indured so many wrongs, of his friends, his enemies, and
  his brethren, as hee did. Who hath thus changed thee? Potentissimus faciem
  illius commutauit, i. The most m
                        •
                     ghtie had altered his face. And beeing thus moulded, God sayd
  vnto him, Ego te constituam Deum Pharaonis, i. I will make thee as
  a God to Pharaoh. Against such hardnesse, power, and tyranny, it is fit
  thou shouldest bee a God, and that to represent my person, thou doost put on my
  condition. The Deuill coniectured by many signes and tokens, that Christ at his
  birth was God: As by Angels, Sheapheards, Kings, &amp; Prophesies: But tothis,
  his pouertie, his suffering cold, his shedding of teares, the thatch of the
  house, the cobwebs in the roome where he lay, &amp; the hay in the cratch, left
  him more perplexed than before. Afterwards he was more amased, when he saw him
  fast fortie dayes, whereupon hee set himselfe to tempt him, saying Si
  filius Dei es, i.Christ patiēce more staggered the
 Deuill than all his miracles. 
                  If thou bee the sonne of God,
  &amp;c. Then hee had greater staggerings, when hee saw his so many, so
  strange, and fearefull miracles, euen to the forcing of the Deuill himselfe to
  acknowledge him to be the sonne of God. And this did confound him more than all
  that went before. But when hee saw, hee pardoned so many iniuries that were
  dayly done vnto him, hee then began to shake and tremble, as if hee had beene
  toucht with quicksiluer. Hee beheld Iudas his selling of him, his
  kisse of false peace, his calling of him friend, and vnder that name betraying
  him; hee saw the night of his imprisonment in Cayphas his house, and
  the iniuries that they did him; persuading himselfe that no other but God,
  could pocket vp such wrongs.
               The World cals the reuengfull man valiant; but the bloudy minded
  man, the Scripture stiles weake, effeminate, and womanish. When Ioab
  killed those noble p
                     •
                  ire of
  brothers Abner and Amasa, hauing dyed his belt and shooes
  with the bloud of Abner; Dauid sayd, Non defiiciet de domo Ioab
  fluxum seminis sustinens,
                  2. Reg. 3.29.
                  &amp;  tenens fusum, &amp; cade

                     s gladio, i. Let there not faile from the House
  of Ioab one that hath an issue, or is a Leaper, or that leaneth on a staffe, or
  falleth by the sword. God did punish this weakenesse and cowardly act of
  Ioab, with the weakenesse and cowardise of all his posteritie.
               Lastly, Being the Sonne of God, thou mayst be sure hee will be
  mindfull of thee, take care of thee, and loue thee. Esay brings in the
  Church, complaining, That God had forgotten her, Dominus oblitus est mei,
  The Lord hath forgotten mee. But he answereth, Nunquid obliuisci
  potest mulier▪ infantis operis sui? i. Can a woman forget the
  children of her wombe? But say she should, Ego (saith he) non
  obliuiscar tui, ecce in manibus meis descripsi te, (i.) I will not yet
  forget thee; behold, I haue engrauen thee in my Palmes. God cannot forget
  his children, if they will but acknowledge him to be their father; and they can
  in nothing be more like vnto him, than in being mercifull, as he is
  mercifull.
            
            
               Estote ergo perfecti, sicut Pater vester perfectus est
               
                  Be yee therefore perfect, euen as your Father is
  perfect. He reduceth this perfection to the loue of our enemie; for to a
  mans friend, the verie Heathens do this. Saint Austen and Saint
  Chrysostome say, it is Omnis virtutis Corona &amp; vertex, The
  heigth and glorie of all vertue. Where he denieth not the reward to him
  that shal loue his friend for Gods sake; but to him that shal loue like a
  Gentile, or a Publican, not for Gods loue, but either out of a naturall
  propension in himselfe, or for his owne pleasure, or commoditie and profit; and
  he that doth not loue his enemie, shewes plainly, that he loueth not his friend
  for his loue to God, but for his loue to himselfe: for if he should loue him
  for Gods loue, hee would no lesse loue his enemie, being that he is as wel the
  Image of God, as his friend. So that he that loues his friend, and not his
  enemie, ought not to expect a reward for louing of his friend: but he that
  doth not onely loue his friend, but his enemie also, hee shall be sure of a
  double reward, Introduxit me Rex in cellam vinariam, ordinauit in me
  charitatem, (i.) The King brought me into the Banquetting
  house,
                  
                     Cant. 2. v. 4. 
                  and
  his banner ouer me, was Loue. Origen notes, That that which the Soule
  desires of her Husband, is not to loue, or to hate; for this being a naturall
  perfection, it is not possible it should faile: the will is neither idle, nor
  in vaine, for it must of force wish either well or ill.Our
 loue how it is to be ordred and disposed. All the kindnesse that shee
  desires of her husband, is, his ordering of his loue; for in disorder
  intollerable errours arise. Of all the Predicaments, God is the highest, and
  hee ought to bee the principall marke of our well ordered affection:
  Dilexi, quoniam audiuit Deus vocem orationis meae, (i.) I loued,
  because the Lord heard the voyce of my prayer: Loued? Whom hast thou
  loued? A prudent wil, which placeth it's felicitie in the obseruance of the
  Law; wee must not aske of it, Whom it loueth? This is a question to be asked of
  a Reprobate, or Cast-away. In a word, He that man ought chiefly to loue, is
  God; and next, man, for the loue of God, be he friend, or be he foe. And
  because when it doth not reach &amp; extend it self to our enemie, it cannot be
  said to be perfect loue; it is said, Estote perfecti sicut Pater vester, Be
  ye perfect as your Father. The reason is, Because in the rest of the
  actions of vertue, humane respects may come athwart vs; one may fast, because
  abstinence importeth his health; another giue Almes, because he affecteth
  vaine-glorie; a third, not seeke to be reuenged, for feare of those
  inconueniences that follow after it; a fourth be chast, for the auoyding of
  shame, &amp;c. But to loue a mans enemie, that must onely proceed from our loue
  to God, it must needs be done only for Gods sake, and God onely can requite
  it.
               
                  Secondly, he reduceth this perfection to the
  loue of our enemie, because it is a sure pledge for Heauen. When Elias
  and Baals Priests were both of them to offer Sacrifice in triall of
  the true God, it was conditioned, That that God that should send downe fire
  from Heauen vpon the Alter, should bee held to bee the true God. Baals
  Priests ball'd vpon him, but all would not doe: but Elias, when he had
  set vp his Alter with the wood vpon it, the beasts about it, and had poured
  water thereupon, to the filling vp of the Trench, he had no sooner pour'd forrh
  his Prayer, but such great store of fire descended from Heauen, that it burnt
  the flesh, the wood, the stones, and likewise wasted and consumed the water.
  That it should burne the beasts, the wood, and the stones, it was no such
  wonder; but that it should take hold on it's contrarie, which is water, it was
  a manifest signe, that it was the fire of Heauen. That your loue should cleaue
  to your owne flesh &amp; bloud, it is not much;The
 perfection of our loue how to be discouered. that it should take hold
  of the wood and stone, that likewise is no great wonder; but that it should
  worke on it's contrarie, on one that desires to make an end of thee, &amp; to
  consume thee, this is loue indeed, this is charitie, this is the fire of
  Heauen.
               Thirdly, The loue to our enemie doth more discouer the
  perfection of our loue; because it is without any hope of temporall reward.
  Elisaeus filled the widdows emptie cruses with Oyle; and thou must
  replenish with thy loue and good workes, those emptie brests that haue nothing
  in them to deserue it. For where there is some deseruingnesse, and reason of
  merit, the Gentile &amp; the Publican doe the like.
               Fourthly, It argueth more perfection; for that the loue of our
  enemie is that glosse which sets before our eyes our owne faults and offences.
  When Shimei reproched Dauid to his face, and gaue him such
  opprobrious language, that his Captaines and Commanders that were then about
  him were impatient of it, and would haue killed him; Dauid withstood
  it, and would not suffer them to take away his life; and the reason was,
  because it put him in mind of his own sinnes; and he that lookes well vpon his
  owne, takes no great notice of another mans. And this made him to say,
  Peccatum meum contra me est semper,
                  Our Enemies are
 but Gods Instruments, who by them doth punish vs for our sins. 
                  My
  sinne warres more against me than mine enemie. Againe, though thy enemie
  doe persecute thee without a cause, it is not without cause, that thou doost
  thus suffer; for (as Tertullian hath it) Nullus iniustè
  patitur, No man suffers wrongfully: So that thou must not looke so much
  vpon him that iniures thee, as vpon thine owne sinnes, for the which God
  permits them to iniure thee. It is Ieremies; Who euer said, Let it bee
  done, though the Lord command it not? Let vs search our owne wayes: Take
  but thy life into examination, and thou wilt find, that thy sinnes deserue a
  thousand times more. Dauid would by no means consent, that his People
  should reuenge those disgracefull words which Shimei spake vnto him;
  and What was the reason? Onely for that he was Gods Instrument. S.
  Austen, vpon the 31 Psalme, pondering those words of Iob,
  Dominus dedit, Dominus abstulit, The Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath
  taken; noteth, That he did not say, Dominus dedit, Diabolus abstulit,
  The Lord gaue, and the Deuill tooke away: For those whips and scourges
  which God sendeth, though they be inflicted vpon vs by the hands of the Deuill,
  yet are we to account them to come from God.
               Out of the whole drift of this Chapter, I will inferre one
  cleere and manifest consequence, which is this, If to hate our enemie be so
  much condemned both of Heauen and Earth, those excesses and exorbitances which
  fall out vpon this occasion (be it in respect of the time and place, or of the
  person, or the act it self, or our deepe disaffection) they are all of them
  here condemned.
               
                  Two kind of faults God doth extreamely hate
  and abhorre:
               The one, Of those who haue no measure or moderation in their
  reuenge; saying with the Idumaeans, Exinanite, exinanite vsque ad
  fundamentum in ea, Raze, raze them to the verie foundation: They would not
  haue one stone left vpon another in Hierusalem; wishing that they might say,
  Etiam periere ruinae, The verie ruines are also perished. Wherby it
  seemeth, that mans cruelty would stand in competition with Gods clemencie. And
  that as God is not willing that any man should set a taxe and size vpon his
  mercie; so these men will haue no man to put a rate vpon their reuenge. Saint
  Peter asked our Sauiour Christ, How many times hee should forgiue his
  brother? Will seuen serue? (saith he.) Our Sauiour answered, I say not seuen
  times, but seuentie times seuen times. Whence Tertullian hath noted,
  That hee had an eye therein to mans excesse in reuenge. Lamech slew
  Caine and the yong man that waited vpon him; and the women going
  about to be reuenged of him for the death of the young man, hee sayd vnto them,
  Hearken ô yee wiues of Lamech, Let it not once enter into your
  thoughts to take reuenge on my life: for though the vengeance which God
  appointed for the killing of Caine had a limitation; yet the reuenge
  of my death shall be without taxe, and without measure; Setuplum vltio
  dabitur de Cain, de Lamech autem septuagies septies, Cain shall be reuenged
  seuen times, but Lamech seuentie times seuen times. Wherein he sets downe
  a finite number for an infinite. In a word, Lamech in this word
  Septuagies septies, shewes, That the reuenge that should bee taken
  thereof should be without terme, without limitation; wherein he seemes to make
  mans crueltie to contest with Gods mercie.
               
                  Hatred should not bee immortall.The
  other is, Of those that hate their enemies so to the death, that though they
  themselues die, yet they will not let their hatred die with them, but leaue it
  in their last Will and Testament to their heires, to take reuenge of their
  wrongs, and to prosecute their enemies vnto death: Being herein like vnto
  Dido, who throwing out her curses and maledictions on Aeneas,
  and desiring the Tygres and other wild beasts to reuenge her wrong, breathed
  her last with this inuocation,They that liue in hardnes of
 hart are iustly suffered to dye in it. 
                  Hoc precor, hanc vocem
  extremā cum sanguine fundo, i. This is my prayer, I wish no other
  good, and this I poure forth with my latest bloud.
               
               Whence I would haue you to note, That this hardnesse of mans
  heart at his death, is in punishment of his hardnesse of heart in his life.
  Hac anima aduersione (saith Saint Austen) punitur
  peccator, i. This is a sinners punishment. And in another place,
  Cor durum male habebit in nouissimo, It shall goe ill with a hard heart in
  the latter day. And Ieremie treating of those that persecuted
  him, Reddes eis Domine vicem iusti, &amp; dabis eis scutum cordis, Thou
  shalt pay them in their owne coyne, thou shalt vse them as they vsed their
  enemies; thou shalt giue them a heart like a shield of Brasse, it shall be hard
  in their life time, and hard at their death. No prayers could mollifie
  them, nor shall their entreatie mooue thee: for only the merciful shall only
  find mercie.
               Now for the reforming of both these excesses, Saint
  Paul saith, Sol non occidat super iracundiam vestram,
                  
                     Ephes. 4. 
                  Let not the Sunne goe downe before
  your wrath goe out, Let not the one set before the other be setled. Saint
  Chrysostome renders two reasons of this saying, Sol non occidat,
  &amp;c.
               
               The one, That the Sunne doth fauour and serue you with his
  light, and with his influences, cherishing your health and your life, and does
  not return home at night brawling and complayning, that he hath bestowed this
  his loue &amp; seruice vpon an vngrateful &amp; vnthankful person. There is no
  creature but wil grumble &amp; repine to serue such a one; Ingemescit, It
  sighes and groanes, &amp;c. (saith Saint Paul) but 
   the Sunne does not grudge at his seruing of you.
               The second, That the night is of it selfe sad, melancholly, and
  in a disposition to troublesome thoughts and immaginations. Now then, that your
  fantasie may not present you with an armie of fearefull cogitations, and the
  dismall representations of reuenge, before that the night comes on, quiet that
  raging sea within thy brest, by throwing Oyle vpon it; become soft &amp; gentle
  by clensing thy heart of all rancour and malice. If the beames of the Sunne
  cannot pierce through a thicke cloud, they will hardly make their way through
  the pitchie darkenesse of the night, being that they are naturally then in
  their augmentation. When the cheerefulnesse of the day, employment in
  businesses, and the companie and comfort of our friends cannot remooue the
  clouds of our anger, the night will hardly scatter them, who is the mother of
  painefull thoughts. For, as the infirmities of the bodie encrease by the
  absence of the Sunne; so in like sort doe the diseases of the soule. I know not
  whither Ioshuah were toucht or no with this Spirit, when hee willed
  the Sunne to stand still, when he was in the pursuit of his enemies.
               It seemeth vnto some, That it is a verie hard matter, and more
  than flesh and bloud can beare, to pardon fresh iniuries, the bloud boyling
  then in our brest: But this is answer'd by that example of our Sauior Christ,
  who when his wounds did poure forth bloud on euerie side, yet his tongue cryde
  out, Ignosce illis, quia nesciunt quid faciunt, Forgiue them, for they know
  not what they doe. Where I would haue you to note, that the word
  faciunt is of the present Tense. When they were boring his feet with
  nailes, Saint Austen to this purpose saith, Is petebat
  veniam,
                  
                     Aug. Tractat. 31. in
 Ioan.
                   
                  à quibus adhuc accipiebat iniuriam, He craued
  pardon for those of whom euen then hee suffered wrong: For he did not so
  much weigh, that he died by them, as that he died for them. Cum esset in
  sanguine suo (saith Ezechiel) dixit, Viue, i. When
  he was in his owne bloud, he said, Liue. And Saint Bernard, That
  hee offered vp his life, Non interpellant
                        •
                     bus, sed repellentibus, non inuocantibus, sed prouocantibus, Not
  for those that inuoked him, but prouoked him.
               
               The replies of the Flesh are infinite, and without number. Some
  say,The excuses of the flesh agāst this louing of our
 enemies, and their confutation. Whilest wee liue in the world we must
  follow the fashions of the world, and liue according to it's Lawes: and that
  if a man put vp one iniurie, he shall haue a thousand put vpon him. I answer
  hereunto, That it is a fouler fault to seeke out reasons to defend and
  maintaine sinne, than to commit it. And if thou shalt tell mee, thou desirest
  to be reuenged because thou art weake, and canst not bridle thy anger; I shall
  the rather pittie thee, and shall withall councell and aduise thee to aske
  pardon of God, for this thy weakenesse and infirmitie. But that thou shouldst
  defend thy offence with reasons and force of argument, it is not a thing to
  bee immagined: but more against reason it is, to reason against God. Let vs
  now leaue the Gospell and the sacred Scriptures, and let vs bring this
  businesse within the spheare of reason: I say then, That it is the Language of
  him that knowes not what reason is, as if it were possible there could be any
  reason against God. The Clowne rests so well contented with his poore Cottage,
  that he wil not change it for the Kings Pallace: And the worldly man likes so
  well of the lawes and fashions of the world, that he sticks not to preferre
  them before those of God.
               Others stand vpon their honour, alledging, How can a man liue in
  the world, without the vpholding of his honour and repution? I answere, It is
  not to bee found in the Scripture, That Christ doth councell any man to suffer
  in his honor for him, or to loose his reputation; Marry,
                     Mathew 16. hee hath promised a reward vnto him
  that for his sake should lay downe his life, or leaue his goods, forsaking all 
   to follow him: but to him that should loose his honour, or
  his reputation, hee neuer made the like promise. For, to obey and serue him, is
  all the honour that man ought to stand vpon;
                     Mathew
 19. 
                  Hoc est, omnis, &amp;c. Gods seruice the greatest
  soueraignety. S. Ambrose saith,
                     Amb.
 lib. 2 in Luc.
                   That God would be borne of a married
  Virgine, out of a care that he had to the Virgines credit; yet therfore is it
  not meet, that a man should procure his owne honour by doing dishonour to
  another.
                     Luke 6. 
                  Cum maledixerint vobis
  homines, &amp; dixerint omne malum aduersum vos mentientes propter me, When men
  shall curse you, and speake all euill against you. The World will say,
  Thou art a base fellow if thou put vp a wrong, and doe not reuenge it to the
  full: But the World lies; for a man cannot doe himselfe a greater honour, than
  to pardon an iniurie. The World will say, Thou hast no worth in thee, and that
  thou doost degenerate from thy noble Ancestors. But therein the world likewise
  lies; for there is nothing more noble, than to forgiue and forget a wrong.
               Others wil say, I forgiue my enemie with all my heart, but I
  will neuer speake to him. I answer, This is a metaphisicall case, that thou
  wilt giue him thy heart, and denie him thy tongue. Me-thinkes that Fountaine
  that is faire within, should not be foule without: Shall God giue thee a heart
  to wish well, and wilt not thou find a tongue to speake wel? And words too,
  without a heart, are not worth God-a-mercie: Si salutaueritis fratres
  vestros tantùm, If yee shal onely salute your brethren, it is
  neither any great thing, nor yet thankes-worthie; but to say thou wilt giue him
  thy heart, and not so much as a word, thou doost giue him neither the one nor
  the other.
               
                  To be first in forgiuing is the greatest
 honour.Others say, Let him come and speake to me first; for as I am the
  more wronged, so I take my selfe to be the better man; and therefore I wil not
  offer my selfe vnto him, but let him come to me, if hee will, else I will neuer
  bee friends with him. I answer, That by thy yeelding first vnto him, thou wilt
  winne by the elder hand, and get thy selfe the more credit. Abraham
  (thou knowest) gaue Lot leaue to chuse first, and being his Kinseman
  and his inferiour both in yeares and otherwise, did not reckon of his right,
  nor his reputation, that hee might not make a rent &amp; breach of loue and
  amitie betweene them, Ne quaeso sit jurgium inter me &amp; te, Let there
  be no strife betwixt thee and me, &amp;c.
               
               Others say, Mee-thinkes it is a hard case, that God should wish
  mee to loue and doe well vnto him that loues not me, and would reioyce in any
  il that should happen vnto me. I answer, That I am not bound to desire of God,
  that he would fulfill the desires of my enemie: for if he direct them to my
  hurt, and to my ruine, I am not bound to aske of God any ill to my selfe. When
  a Bell is drawne vp to the top of some Tower, or a Stone to some high Steeple,
  it is the naturall and common course of those that see it carried vp, to desire
  no mischance may befall it: But if any should be so maliciously foolish, as to
  say in his heart, O that I might now see it fall: the Stone might verie well
  replie, Let not thy desires prosper. The like may he say, who goes mounting vp
  to some heigth of goodnesse, to his enuious enemie, Let not thy ill wishes
  thriue against me.
               Last of all, To him that shall thinke that this is too hard a
  Precept, I answer, That there is this difference betweene those that are the
  Saints of God,The true child of God thinks it no hard
 precept to loue hi
                        •
                     
 enemies. &amp; those that are not; that these striue to get Heauen at
  too cheape a rate, and stand a hucking, to see if they can get thither with a
  little cost: But those that are Gods children seeke all occasions for to buy
  it at any price, be it neuer so high, nay, though it should cost them their
  life. Quotidiam morior propter vestram gloriam, I die daily for your
  glorie,
                  1. Cor. 18. saith Saint
  Paul. Whereupon Saint Chrisostome giues this note, That the
  Apostle was euen sorie, that he had no more but one life to lay downe 
   for his God, and for the welfare of his brethren in the
  Lord: And that therefore he had scarce escaped one danger, but that he was
  desirous to enter into another.
            
         
         
            THE FOVRTH SERMON, ON THE SATVRDAY AFTER ASHWEDNESDAY.
            
               
                  MARC. 6. MAT. 14. 
                  
                     Cum sero esset factum, erat Nauis in medio Maris.
                   
                  When it grew late, the Shippe was in the middest of the
  Sea.
               
            
            
               THe Euangelist recounteth heere vnto vs a fearefull Tempest,The disciples weaknes of Faith. which the Disciples endured
one night in the middest of the sea; the winds being stiffe and terrible, the
waues furiously raging, the clouds thicke and darke, the ship small &amp;
shrewdly beaten, and hardly able to withstand the swelling of this proud sea,
this storme continuing in it's strength and vigour till the fourth watch in the
morning. And though these were many and verie forcible reasons to make them to
be affraid; yet vnto these was added a new cause of feare, to wit, That our
Sauiour appearing vnto them walking vpon the waters, they thought it was a
Phantasma, some Spirit in a seeming assumed shape, whither Angell, or Deuill,
they could not deuise with themselues. And the common receiued opinion is,
That the
                  •
               e Visions had their
seuerall apparitions, as it appeareth in Saint Luke, and the Acts
of the Apostles. They pittifully cried out, for feare of beeing drowned in
the Deepe, not considering, that he who had filled their bellies in the
wildernesse, could trample the waues vnder his feet, and preserue their bodies
from sinking. Our Sauiour made shew at the first, of walking a farre off from
them, as he did afterwards with those that he went along with to Emaus; but in
the end he spake vnto them, and made himselfe knowne vnto them. Then
Peter thereupon rushed presently into the Sea, and beginning to sinke,
he stretched out his hand vnto him, and reprehended him for hauing so little
Faith. At last they entred into the ship, and they were no sooner come in, but
the winds went away, the sea grew calme, and the tempest 
ceased. The Mariners, and the rest that were aboord this Barke, acknowledged
our Sauiour to be the Sonne of God. They disembarked in Genezareth, the fame of
whose comming was soon spred abroad; they brought forth their sicke vnto him,
and our Sauiour Christ restored them to their health.
            
               
                  Cùm serò esset factum. When it grew
  late, &amp;c.
               Saint Iohn saith, That the Feast being ended, our
  Sauior went vp to the Mount to pray, Ascendit solus orare, He went vp
  alone. Saint Marke, and Saint Mathew, That he forced his
  Disciples to go on shippe-boord. Nor doth this admit any contradiction; for
  before that he withdrew himselfe to pray, he might verie wel will them to make
  them readie to goe to sea: And happely they might stay waiting for him till it
  were towards the euening, and seeing he did not come, yet (according as he had
  commanded them) embarked themselues.
               Of this his forcing them to goe aboord, the Doctors giue diuers
  reasons.
               The first is taken out of Saint Iohn. Our Sauiour knew
  that the People had a purpose to make him King; which danger hee seeking to
  auoyd, hee withdrew himselfe aside to pray, beeing all alone; notifying to his
  Disciples, That they should in the meane while prouide to goe to sea.
               The second, That our Sauior thereby might take occasion to work
  this wonderfull miracle: for if the Disciples had not embarked themselues,
  neither had our Sauiour walked vpon the sea, nor Peter aduentured
  himselfe vpon the waues, nor his Disciples endured such a terrible storme, nor
  had there been such cleere notice taken of his soueraignepower.
               The third is Saint Chrysostomes; who saith, That when
  they were to go to sea, our Sauiour would that they should carrie along with
  them the remainder of such broken pieces of bread, and of the fishes that were
  left, to the end that they might thinke vpon the forepassed miracle. Wherein
  they were so dull sighted, that Saint Marke saith, Non enim
  intellexerunt de panibus, They vnderstood nothing about the Loaues. And
  therefore those whom Fullnesse and Prosperitie had thus blinded, God through
  troubles and afflictions cleereth their eye-sight.
               
                  The Society of Women, though deuout, is
 dangerous.The fourth is Theophilacts; insinuating this for an
  especiall reason, That our Sauiour Christ seeing his Disciples in conuersation
  with some deuout women which were present at the Feast, hee willed them
  presently to embarke; conceiuing, that they would bee farre more safe in the
  sea amidst the waues, than in the companie of women, though neuer so deuout,
  neuer so holy. And the ground of this truth may be gathered from the Disciples
  vnwillingnesse to put forth to sea: but our Sauiour like a good Horseman, that
  claps his spurres close to the sides of his Ginnet, when he refuses to make his
  carreere, Coegit illos, He compelled them.
               
               The fifth, For that the Shippe is a Type and figure of
  gouernment, of honour, and of dignitie: And God will haue his friends to bee
  forced to ascend to those high places. And therefore it is said, Coegit
  illos vt ascenderent, He compelled them to ascend.
               
               The last is Saint Hieromes; who alledgeth, That the
  content beeing so great which the Disciples tooke in the presence of their
  Master, it was a cleere case, that it would verie much grieue them to depart
  from him, and to bee forced to forgoe his companie. For he that hath once a
  truetast of God, will hardly bee withdrawne from him. A Dogge, be he beaten
  neuer so much, he will not leaue his Masters house, and all for the loue that
  he beareth him, and the pleasure and delight that hee taketh in his presence.
  And this was it that made Iob, when hee  was most
  beaten with his afflictions, to vtter with a great deale of patience this
  humble language, Etiam, si occiderit, in illum sperabo, i. Though
  hee kill mee, yet will I trust in him. What shall they then doe, that haue
  sate at the same boord with their God, and eate of his meate? Shall not they
  the fuller they are fed, be still the more hungrie? yes doubtlesse. For as
  Ecclesiasticus sayth; Qui edunt me,
                  
                     Eccl. 24. 
                  adhuc esurient, i. They
  which eat me, shall yet hunger.
               
            
            
               Et erat nauís in medio Maris.
               
                  And the Ship was in the midst of the Sea. It seemeth
  somewhat strange, that our Sauiour Christ, inforcing his Disciples to enter
  into the Sea, and they hauing punctually obey'd his command, that hee should
  punish them with such a dangerous and fearefull tempest. That Gods justice
  shoul ouertake Ionas in the ship, that the Mariners should bee as it
  were the Sergeants, the Whale the prison, the Sea the executioner, it was not
  much, for that hee sought to flie from Gods obeydience, and showed himselfe
  vnwilling to performe the seruice that was inioyned him: But that the
  Disciples, who left the Land, entred into the Sea, and consecrated their
  desires to their Sauiours Will; that these men should see themselues in danger
  of drowning and ready to perish, is more than much. And this difficultie is
  indeered the more, because it is sayd, That no ill shall happen vnto him, who
  shall keepe his commandements.
                     Eccl. 1.
                  Qui custodit praeceptum, non experietur quidquam mali. But ô
  Lord, if thou afflictest with torments, those that loue and obey thee; What
  wilt thou doe vnto those that are renegates, and blasphemers, &amp;c? This
  doubt requireth those reasons, which our Sauiour had for the miraculous
  allaying of this tempest.
               The first is Saint Chrysostomes, The Disciples (sayth
  hee) might haue dwelt vpon that former miracle of the loaues of bread, and the
  fishes, and on that fulnesse and saturitie wherewith such a multitude of
  guests were satisfied and contented, carrying great store thereof away with
  them in their bosomes, and their pockets. They might likewise haue argued from
  thence, the Omnipotency and Diuinitie of our Sauiour Christ, Et non
  intellexerunt de panibus: But they remained blind: God therefore doth so
  order the businesse, That those eyes, whome Good could not open, Ill should:
  And that the daunger of the tempest should aduise those, whome feasting and
  fulnesse of bread could not persuade.
               The second, Let no man looke in Gods house to eate of his bread
  for nothing. God perhaps will bid thee sit downe and eat, and say vnto thee,
  In die bonorum fruere bonis, i. In the day of wrath, be of good
  comfort: But withall,
                     Eccl. 7.16. thou
  must looke to pay thy shot, For God will presently make triall in the furnace
  of tribulation, whether his bread bee well bestowed or no. There is no Saint in
  Heauen which hath not beene put to this proofe. And Ecclesiasticall persons of
  all other, haue a preciser obligation lying vpon them, who are the honour of
  Gods house, who eat more especially at his Table, who gather vp the remainders
  of the feast, inioying the fruits of the earth in great aboundance, and in
  more plentifull measure than other men. And it is no great maruaile that they
  that possesse much, should be possessed with much feare.
               The third, It is the ordinarie language of the Saints of God, to
  call this world a Sea, and this our life a sailing therein. This
  Origen prooueth, and Hylarius, and Clemens
  Alexandrinus: and the proportions are many. Saint Austen citeth
  two, the one, That as the water of the Sea is generally bitter, and it is a
  wonder if euer it become fresh and sweete: So our life is so full of gall and 
   worme-wood, that there is scarce to bee found in it any
  the least smack of content or sweetnesse: Suting well with that other saying
  of this sacred Doctor, That the greatest ioy which we inioy in this life, is
  not ioy, but a kind of lightning and easing of sorrow. The other (which is
  likewise noted by Saint Basil, and Clemens Alexandrinus) That
  as in the Sea,

  violence; so the powerfull men of this world oppresse the poorer sort, and
  swallow them vp. According to that of Habacuc: Facies homines, sicut pisces
  maris, i. Thou makest men as the fishes of the Sea.
               
               
                  Gregorie Nazianzen putteth two other proportions. The
  one, That as he who saileth in the Sea,

                           〈◊〉

                        at. Sap. 14. leads a life very neere vnto death, hauing
  but a poore plancke betwixt him and it, Exiguo enim ligno, credunt homines
  animas suas, i. For men trust a small piece of wood with their
  liues; So hee that walkes in the dangerous wayes of this world, may say
  with Dauid, Vno tantum gradu ego, &amp; mors diuidimur, i.1. Reg. 20. 
                  Ther's but one degree betwixt me
  and death. The other, that those, who take pleasure in going to Sea, come
  to make the waues thereof their winding sheete: So those, that are wedded to
  the world, receiue their death at the worlds hands. The deceits of the world,
  are like those of the Sea. And for this cause perhaps the Scripture giues the
  S
                     •
                  a the name of Heart;
                     Psal. 46.2. 
                  Transferentur montes in cor
  maris, i. The mountaines shall bee translated into the Heart of the
  Sea: And sometimes,
                     Psal. 104.25. of
  Hands, Mare magnum, &amp; spatiosum manibus, i. The Sea hath wide
  and spacious Hands; Sometimes of Eyes and Feet, Mare vidit &amp;
  fugit, i. the sea saw it and fled;
                     Psal. 114.3. Sometimes of Tongue, Desolabit
  Dominus linguam maris, i. the Lord shall destroy the tongue of the
  sea.
                  
                     Esay. 11..15. Iob. 7.12.
  And last of all, Iob paints it foorth like a most fierce beast shut vp
  in an yron grate, or strong prison; Num quid mare ego sum quia
  circumdedisti me in isto carcere? i. Am I a sea that thou shouldest
  keepe mee continually in hold?
               
               From hence followeth another proportion or conueniencie, which
  is a verie cleare one. For as the way of the Sea is full of dangers, of Pyrats,
  of Shelfes, and of Rockes; and as it is not possible, that mans wisdome and
  experience can preuaile against them; euen so is it with the world. The way by
  Land is of lesse difficultie: Euery man knowes how to make his necessary
  prouision; as a horse, a man, a cloake-bagge, and a good purse. And suppose
  some of these should faile vs, wee may furnish our selues afresh at the first
  good place wee come at. And if wee passe ouer mountaines, where there is
  suspition of theeues, we may perceiue the perill and preuent it; but for those
  that goe by Sea, the like prouision and preuention cannot be made, especially
  if fortune doe not fauour vs. Est via, qui videter homini recta nouissima
  autem eius ducunt ad mortem, i. There is a way which seemeth right to
  a man,
                  
                     Prou. 16. 
                  but the end of it
  leadeth to death. A ship shall goe sayling with the winde in the Poope of
  it, with a great deale of content and delight, and on the suddaine it shall
  bee split in pieces, and no memoriall remayne thereof. The like successe
  befalleth men in this world, euery steppe that they tread. And therefore Saint
  Austen sayth, That it is as great a miracle for a man to walke vpon
  the waues of the World without sinking, as it was for Saint Peter to
  walke vpon the waues of the Sea. Many other conueniencies there are, which I
  omit to mention; this World beeing in conclusion a Sea, our life a sayling
  therein, and euery particular man a ship. Sicut naues poma portantes,

  of the Sea.
               
                  This Shippe was a figure of the Church,
  which God permitteth to be persecuted, 
  
                     For his owne sake;
                     For the Churches; and
                     For those that looke thereupon.
                  
               
               For his owne sake; For should it haue no enemies to persecute
  it, &amp; hotly to assaile her, Gods omnipotencie would not shew it's glorious
  splendor to the world. The force of fire is seene when the water cannot quench
  it; of light, when darkenesse cannot obscure it; of sweete odours, when the
  filthiest sents cannot ouercome their fragrancie; of power, when the whole
  strength of the world, nay the Deuill and Hell it selfe cannot preuaile against
  it. And this succeedeth vnto God in the persecution of his Church: for the
  enemies thereof haue been maimed and put to flight, Gods Arme remaining still
  strong &amp; sound. Pharaoh came brauely on with his Chariots and
  Horsemen; boasting as hee went, Persequor, &amp; comprehendam illos,
  euaginabo gladium meum, interficiet eos manus mea, I will pursue them, and
  ouertake them, I will vnsheath my Sword, and my hand shall slay them: But
  God beckned vpon the waues, and they swallowed vp aliue both him and all his
  Host. And the Text saith, That the Hebrewes saw the powerfull hand of God
  charging vpon them, hauing planted there in that sea the ensigne of his power.
  Tertullian saith of Iob, That God made him a triumphant
  Chariot of the spoyles of Hell, and that he dragged thereat along in the durt,
  his enemies ensignes, to the greater dishonour of the Deuill. The like doth
  God doe in the Church, with Iewes, Moores, and Heretickes, himselfe remaining
  still firme against all their furious violences, like a rock in the midst of
  the sea. Some rocks are to be seene euen where the Seas are deepest; which it
  seemeth God placed there of purpose,The Church why likened
 to a Rocke. in scorne and contempt of that ouerswelling pride and
  furious raging of the sea: For though they haue beene lashed and beaten by them
  from the beginning of the world to this present day, they could neuer mooue,
  much lesse remooue them, because they haue sure rooting in the bottome of the
  Sea. And this is a Type of the Church, which God hath placed in the middest of
  this Sea of the World, for to make a mocke of as many as are her enemies.
               But some one will say, How can the Church be called a Rocke,
  beeing figured here by this little Ship, which the waues thus tosse vp and
  down in the aire? I answer, That Ezechiel in his twentie seuenth
  Chapter, speaketh of Tyrus in the metaphor of an Isle, My beautie is
  perfect, and my abode is in the midst of the Sea. And presently changing
  that metaphor, he termes it a Galley; which is all one, as if he should haue
  said, That with Gods helpe a Galley may be an Isle, and without God an Isle may
  be a Galley. So likewise the Church, albeit it be a Ship in the middest of the
  tempestuous waues of the Sea, yet by the assistance of his holy Spirit it may
  bee a perdurable Rocke. And (as Saint Austen hath noted it) the
  Executioners haue often wanted strength and inuentions to torment, but there
  neuer wanted courage in the Martyrs for to suffer, by the diuine power and
  fauour of God. Howsoeuer therefore the waues shall beate against this Barke,
  they may want force to ouerturne her, but she will neuer want sides to make
  resistance.
               For the Churches sake; because it makes for her good,The
 greatest persecution of the Church, is to want persecution. and for her
  greater encrease. This is expressed in that Parable, Nisi granum frumenti,
  Except a grain of Corne, &amp;c. And in that other, Ego sum vitis
  vera, &amp; vos palmites, I am the true Vine, yee are the Branches. The
  happinesse of Corne consisteth in this, in that it is sowen, and in that it
  dies; That of the Vine, in that it is pruned, and hath it's  boughes and branches cut off: Many wilde Trees of vnsauorie Fruits,
  by the art of graffing are reduced to a pleasant relish. Of Saffron
  Pliny saith, That the more it is trodden on, the better it springeth:
  The graine of Mustard, the more it is bruised and broken, the greater strength
  it discouereth: And the Church, the more it is persecuted, the more it
  prospereth. And as Mariners are woont to say, that at sea the worst storme is a
  calme; so wee may say of the Church, that it's greatest persecution is to haue
  no persecution at all. Esay sets it downe for a threatning, That God
  will leaue off to prune and dresse his Vine any more, Dimittam
  eam,
                  
                     Leo. papa. ser. 1. de pet. &amp; Paul.
 Basil. Esay. 5. Crys. Psal. 71. 
                  &amp; non putabitur,
  nec fodietur. For when a Vine is pruned, for one branch it putteth forth
  ten: And the Church, by one Martyr being cut off, giues a plentifull encrease
  of two hundred conuerted Christians. Pope Leo, Saint Basil,
  and Saint Chrysostome prosecute this Doctrine more at large, in the
  vnfolding of the aforesaid Parables.
               Lastly, for their sakes that looke thereupon, and behold at full
  the persecutions of the Church. For as to the righteous, the prosperitie of
  the sinner is a stumbling blocke of offence; Hic labor est ante me: So
  to the sinner, the persecution of the just causeth great scandall. Both these
  are vndoubted truths, both hard to bee vnderstood, but harder farre to bee
  persuaded. But God afflicteth with persecutions the thing which he most loueth,
  which is his Church; and prospereth those her enemies, which hate her, to the
  end, that men might thereby learne and vnderstand, that neither those euils
  which the Church suffereth, are true euils; nor those blessings which the other
  inioy, true blessings. And this is prooued out of Saint Augustine in
  his Booke De Ciuit. Dei;
                     Aug. lib. 1.
 de Ciuit. cap. 8. Seneca lib. quare bonis viris. cap.
 5. and out of Seneca in that his Booke, Quare bonis
  viris. So that the wicked, though that hee inioy a great deale of
  prosperitie, wee are not to esteeme it as a blessing; nor for that the
  righteous suffer much aduersity, are we to account it a curse vnto them: But
  ought rather to apprehend, that persecution is for their good, in regard that
  our Sauiour Christ giues it vs as a reward for our great seruice. Et omnis
  qui reliquerit patrem, matrem, &amp;c. centuplum accipiet cum
  persecutionibus, i. And euerie one that shall haue left father or
  mother &amp;c. Shall receiue a hundreth fold, with Persecutions. Saint
  Marke, and Saint Cyprian, both affirme, that persecution
  putteth vs in a kind of possession of that glorie which wee hope for hereafter,
  at least it giues vs an assurance thereof. And this is made good by this
  comparison. The Good, the Scripture stileth by the name of Wheat; and the
  Wicked are tearmed Chaffe. Now, it is the Fanne of persecution, that doth seuer
  the Wheat from the Chaffe.

                  Hee saw them toyled in rowing. There are two things
  which steale away Gods eyes,Gods Eyes how to be drawn vnto
 vs. and filch them (if I may vse that phrase) from forth his head. The
  one is, an humble and prompt obedience: The other, the trouble and torment
  which we suffer for his sake. Touching the first, notable is that place of
  Abraham, whose obedience did so draw Gods eyes vnto him, that that
  place where he was resolued to performe the Sacrifice, remained with this
  name, Dominus videbit, The Lord will see. Touching the second, There
  is not any hunger nor humane miserie, whereon Gods mercie hath not his eye
  fixed, nay, I may boldly say, fast nailed thereunto. To Moses God
  spake out of a Bush; O thou great God of heauen and earth, a bush is no
  fitting chaire for thy glorie, or thy Maiestie; Who made thee thus to alter thy
  Throne? Vidi afflictionem Populi mei in Aegypto, I haue seene the
  affliction of my People in Aegypt. Another Translation hath it,
  Videndo  vidi, In se
                        •
                     ing I haue seene; and the repetition goes on in this descant,
  Qui tangit vos, tangit pupillam oculi mei, He toucheth the apple of Gods
  eye, that toucheth the Iust. And in another place, Et clamorem eius
  audiui, And I haue heard his crie: For our miserie toucheth not onely Gods
  eye, but his eare also. Tertullian reporteth in his
  Apologetico, That the Gentiles did murmure against the Christians,
  that they would not recommend the safetie and welfare of their kings to those
  their Gods, Iupiter and Mercurie. But Nazianzen
  answereth thereunto, That they did not allow of this their councell, to
  recommend their safetie vnto Gods whose hands &amp; feet were of Iead; but vnto
  that God who swiftly flies to heale them of their infirmities, and carries
  health in his wings, Et sanitas in pennis eius.
               
               
                  Vidit eos laborantes in remigando, He saw them labouring at
  the Oare. In another Tempest, no lesse fearefull than the former, Saint
  Luke 
                  
                     •
                  aith, That our
  Sauiour Christ fell asleepe, leaning his head on one of the boords of the Ship,
  in stead of a pillow. And here Saint Mathew saith, That hee beheld how
  his Disciples wrestled with the waues, seeking to ouercome their rage and their
  furie. The one Tempest God permitted, the other he sendeth. Of Pharaoh
  it is said by the Prophet, Ego excitaui eum, I raised him vp to be the
  instrument for the afflicting of my People, that I might afterwards grind him
  to pouder. And by Esayas he saith, That with his whistle he called the
  Flies from beyond the Seas. In all sorts of Tempests therefore the Iust may
  thinke themselues safe, because God is continually at hand to helpe them:
  According to that of Dauid, Cum ipso sum in tribulatione, I am with thee
  in tribulation; And of Esay,
                  
                     Esay.

                  When thou passest through the waters I will bee with thee, and

  Ezechiell; Ero sicut Tunica prope corpus ipsorum, i. I will bee as
  a coat about their bodie. Saint Gregorie sayth, That God appeared
  vnto Iob, De turbine, i. Out of the whirlewind. For hauing
  permitted a whirle-winde of troubles to come vpon him, it would not haue suted
  so well that hee should haue spoke vnto him from that throne of Glorie, whence
  he spake vnto him when hee was in his perfect health and prosperitie. The
  three children beeing in the Firie Furnace, the Sonne of God appeared amidst
  those flames, and the tyrant saw one,

  giues.
                     Psal. 28. 
                  Dominus diluuium

  diluuium inhabitans. When God sent the Flood, hee put himselfe also in the
  midst of the waters.1. Reg. 27.
                  Redemisti tibi ex Aegipto gentem, &amp; Deum eius, i. Thou hast
  redeemed a nation to thy selfe, euen out of Aegipt, and withall, their
  God. Vpon which place Vatablus hath noted, That God did redeeme
  himselfe, beeing captiuated as well as his people. And hee could not like of
  his owne libertie, as long as hee saw that they were kept in slauerie. In

                  For the Wind was aganst them. All the misfortunes of
  nauigation, the Euangelist reduceth to the Winde. And following the Metaphore,
  That this World is a Sea, and our life a sayling therein; all that doth hinder
  the prosperitie and happinesse thereof, is Wind. Whilest the vse of reason
  stood faire and  cleere with man, he put the prow of his
  desires into the Hauen of Saluation: for all doe naturally desire an estate
  that is full of happinesse, and free from euill; and that which makes their
  voyage vnhappie &amp; vnfortunate, is Wind. Saint Iohn saith, That all
  things in this world, are either pleasures, couetousnesse, or honours: And if
  we shall summe vp all the pleasures, riches, and honors, that haue beene
  enioyed in the world euen to this verie houre, we shall find that they are all
  but Wind. Salomon made an Annatomie of all humane felicitie, and in
  conclusion shewes it is all but vanitie, Vanitas vanitatum, &amp; omnia
  vanitas. Zacharie saw a figure of foure Empires, the famousest that euer
  were in the world; the Assirians, Persians, Medes, and Graecians; and asking
  of the Angell, Qui sunt isti, Domine mi? He told him, isti sunt
  quatuor Venti, Those are the foure Winds. The most prosperous Scepters,
  and the most dreadfull Crownes are no better than ayre: And it were well if
  they were no worse, and did not crosse that good fortune which we desire in the
  nauigation of this our life; Hoc opus, hic labor.

                  About the fourth watch. What,
  so late? Gods helpe come it when it wil come, comes neuer too late;
  Veniens, veniet, &amp; non tardabit. And God would that this truth
  should remaine so notorious and manifest to the world, that hee doth not onely
  call it a Vision, ex plana visum, which carrieth it's euidence along
  with it; but he commandeth the Prophet to write it downe with strange
  circumstances. The first is verie cleere, and hath not the least shaddow of
  darkenesse in it. The second circumstance, that this saying should bee grauen
  Vpon Boxe, for so the Septuagint read it; which kind of wood
  (according vnto Esay) conserueth what is written therein to the worlds
  end. The third, That it should bee written in capitall letters which may be
  read afarre off. The fourth, The assurance &amp; certaintie thereof, implied
  in the repetition, Veniens, veniet, &amp; non tardabit, Comming, he will
  come,

  tardabit, si moram fecerit? How can he but linger, if he vse delay? I
  answer, Gods helpe may happely come too late, in regard of our desire, but can
  neuer come too late in regard of our necessitie. And this his slownesse in
  succouring vs, may seeme painfull, if wee shall measure it according to the
  impatiencie of our desire; but profitable vnto vs, if wee will but thinke vpon
  the reward which is layd vp for those that suffer hoping.
               
                  
                     Rom. 5.Saint Paul in
  the chaine which he recommendeth to the Romans, whose links are Tribulation,
  Patience, Triall, Hope, Charitie (which Saint Austen doth so much
  celebrate in his booke De Doct. Christiana) saith, Gloriamur in
  tribulationibus, scientes quoniam tribulatio patientiam operatur; patientia,
  probationem; probatio, vero spem, We reioyce in tribulation; knowing that
  tribulation bringeth forth patience; patience, experience; and experience,
  hope. Wee draw glorie out of our tribulations; for he that is in
  tribulation, doth not onely suffer, but in suffering worketh; which working
  causeth in vs an eternall weight of glorie.
                  
                     Cor. 17. The excellencie of Patience From
  Patience ariseth another linke, which is Probation, or Triall; whither it bee
  for that the Patient doth prooue how much he is able to suffer, being fauoured
  by Heauen, and holpen from aboue; or whither it be, that he should bee prooued
  as was Iob, to see whither he would sticke surely to his tackling. For
  Patience is a more assured testimonie of our triall, than Fasting, Prayer,
  Almes, or the like: for these are often subiect vnto falsehood. Againe, from
  this Triall, ariseth Hope; for hee that is wonderfull patient, cannot but haue
  a wonderfull good Hope. This was it that made God say to Abraham, Nunc
  cognoui quod timeas Deum, Now I know that  thou fearest
  God. And S. Paul saith of himselfe, That he did hope beyond hope;
  that is, that he did euen then still hope, when all reason of hope did faile
  him. Besides, God is woont to permit that our tribulation should be great, to
  the end that our Patience might be made great, our Triall great, and our Hope
  great: and then doth he come in and helpe vs, when hee hath made sufficient
  proofe of our faith: to the trial wherof God puts vs a thousand manner of ways.
  The People of Israel passed through the bed of Iordan, those waters sliding
  gently along towards the dead sea, and those other drouen backe, so that they
  passed through it as through the drie land. And yet this might perhaps seeme
  vnto God but a slender triall of their Faith; First, Because a great number
  ioyning in companie together, they take more courage vnto them in the
  vndergoing of any danger; for common calamities are euermore the lesse felt.
  Secondly, In regard of the Arkes being there, whereof those waters might seeme
  to be affraid, and so flie backe for feare, Iordanis conuersus est
  retrorsum. Thirdly, For that there were so many innocent little children
  amongst them, whom God (they might suppose) would not suffer to bee drowned,
  considering they had not yet offended him, as not knowing good from euill. And
  therefore he commanded that twelue of them, vpon whom the lots should fall,
  should goe backe &amp; take out twelue great stones out of the bed of Iordan,
  to make a Pyramis or Alter to remaine as a memoriall of that miracle: whereunto
  they all of them readily offered themselues with a great deale of alacritie;
  and this was a great triall of their Faith: But it would haue beene greater, if
  God had commanded them to set their backes and shoulders against the waues,
  keeping them there, and deferring his succour till the thread of their hope
  were broken in twaine, and they readie to perish.
               This deferring is vsually the vigill of Gods greater
  mercies.

  deferred his helpe to the last push, but the greater the delay was, the greater

                   Saint Chrysostome saith, That Christs so
  long deferring to alay this storme, was to teach vs, that we are not at the
  first flaw of a Tempest, to call for present faire weather; but rather to crie
  out with Dauid, Non me derelinquas vsquequaque, Let not thy not relieuing
  of mee bee eternall, Forsake me not ô Lord for euer; but let thy
  succour come when it shall seeme best vnto thee: not my, but thy will be
  done.
               God likewise refuseth sometimes to affoord his help, 
                     He delights to see his children wrestling with
affliction. 
                     
                        Seneca lib. quare viris cap. 2.
                   out of
  the pleasure that hee taketh to see the Righteous row against the streame, and
  to tugge and wrestle with all the might they can, against the troubles and
  afflictions of this world. Seneca touching (though as a Heathen) vpon
  this straine, saith, That there is not in all the earth a spectacle more
  worthie Gods beholding, than to see a stout man wrestling against aduerse
  fortune. Saint Chrysostome dwelles much vpon the great care which God
  tooke in notifying to the Deuill, that hee should not touch Iob in his
  life; Veruntamen animam illius serua, But yet preserue his life. Not
  that Iob should haue receiued any hurt by the losse of his life, but
  because God would not loose the pleasure of seeing this stout combat fought out
  betwixt him and his enemie. Si de medio tuleris Theatrum non plaudet
  amplius. And as your Heathen Emperours tooke great delight in seeing a
  Christian enter the Listes with a wild Beast; so the King of Heauen takes much
  pleasure in seeing one of his Saints maintaine fight against those fierce
  Beasts of Hell.

                  And they tooke him for an apparition. Here is one feare
  vpon another, &amp; therefore it was not much they should crie out. The wind
  and the waues had sorely affrighted them, and that which was to bee the remedie
  of their danger, made them to apphrehend a new danger, fearing now more their
  succour than their hurt: being herein like vnto many, who feare their good, but
  not their euil; the Glutton doth not feare drunkennesse,Men
 feare not the sinne, but the suffering for sinne. and that fulnesse
  which lessens his health, and puts his life in danger; but feares those syrrops
  and purgations which he is to take for his recouerie. The bad Christian feareth
  not the fault he hath committed, which is the greatest euill; but feareth to
  doe pennance for the same, which is for his greatest good. The Atheist feareth
  not death, nor the graue, but saith, We haue made a couenant with Death and
  Hell; yet he feareth pouerty &amp; hunger, and the enemie that threatens
  him; but not God, who can swallow him vp quicke in the flames of Hell fire: He
  feares an earthly Iudge that may put him to torment; but not that Iudge of
  Heauen, that can condemne to endlesse paines which are neuer to haue end.

               The description of Christs Combat with the
  Deuill.
               THis famous Combat betwixt two of the stoutest and valiantest
Captaines that euer tryde their valour in a single Duel, wil very well deserue
the looking on, and require our diligent attention, taking vp as well our eyes
as our eares. This battell then that is here described by the Euangelist, is
the notablest and the strangest that euer was in former, or euer shall bee
seene in future Ages. The Combattants are two great Princes, whose power all
the world acknowledgeth, and whose wisedome admits no comparison; the one, the
Prince  of Light; the other, the Prince of Darkenesse: The
field wherein they fought, was a Wildernesse, where they had nothing to
sustaine themselues withall but stones: Their Weapons, Wit, and Words; the
faculties of the Vnderstanding, and the vse of the Tongue. The Deuills end
was, to repaire a double losse, or two-fold ouerthrow at our Sauiour Christs
hands: The one, That he could neuer catch him in any the least fault, nor find
him tripping in any one action that euer he did. And this was it that did mad
him to the heart, and mightily incense his rage, that amongst all mankind,
there neuer yet beeing any, though neuer so famous, neuer so iust, that had
escaped his clutches without receiuing some foyle or other; as Adam, Noah,
Abraham, Dauid, &amp; the like good and holy men: that now a man, in the
eye of the World of no better than a meane and ordinarie ranke, (for such a one
was our Sauiour held to bee) should escape his fingers, and should shew
himselfe to bee the onely Phoenix of the world. The other, that he did not yet
perfectly know by that euidence of his humane nature, &amp; by those great
suspitions which he might haue of his diuine essence, by calling to mind those
menaces that were threatned against him in Paradice, I will put enmitie
betwixt the woman and thee, betwixt thy seed and her seed; hee shall bruise thy
head, &amp;c. And he began to thinke with himselfe, What wil become of me
if this be the Bug-beare foretold by the Prophets? Questionlesse if this be the
man, I shall hardly escape a broken pate.
            Our Sauiours end was not any desire of his owne proper worth and
merit, nor any vaine-glorie to shew his valour; for it could bee no great
glorie to boast of,Our Sauiors main end in fighting
  with the Deuil, was to sanctifie our temptations. nor no such
wonderfull conquest, that the Sonne and Heire apparent of Heauen should subdue
the Deuil. But his end was thereby to sanctifie our temptations, as he had done
all the rest of our miseries, by taking them vpon himself, because they should
recouer a new beeing, and a new honour: And that those temptations which
heretofore did serue as steepe Rockes to throw vs downe into Hell, should serue
as Ladders to bring vs to Heauen. Theodores saith, That as Physitions
make Treacle out of Serpents▪ so our Sauiour Christ drew an Antidote and
wholsome Medicine from the Deuil and his deceits and subtleties: so that now,
Temptation hath lost his name and strength, and of Gally-slaues we are made
Freemen by Iesus Christ.
            Secondly, Our Sauiour Christ did pretend by this fight, 
                  To free the world from feare. 
                  A description of the Deuill.
                to rid the world of
that great feare wherin it liued. Wherby we may suppose the feareful power of
the Deuill throughout the face of the whole earth. Iob in his 41.
Chap. maketh a dreadfull description of the Deuill, in the metaphor of a Whale,
or (as some would haue it) of a Sea Dragon; a Fish of that exceeding
greatnesse, that when he discouers himselfe in the waters, he seemeth to be
some little Island, or some pretie big Hill; Corpus eius, scuta
fusilia; his bodie is couered ouer with such strong scales, as if they
were barres of Brasse, and ribbes of Steele, and so close lockt &amp; ioynted
together, that the subtillest aire cannot get in between the knitting of the
ioynts; Stornutatio eius, splendor ignis, The breath of his nostrills
is like vnto lightning; his eyes as flashes of fire; from his mouth come forth
flames, as out of a Furnace; from his nose issueth a thicke smoake; his breath
kindleth coles, and sets them on fire; there are no weapons either offensiue or
defensiue, that can withstand his force; Reputa
                     •
                  it quasi palus, ferrum &amp; as quasi
lignum putridum, Yron to him is as strawes, and swords of steele as rotten
sticks. A man of arms may threaten him with a Mace of Iron; a Gunner shoot his
Bullets at him; an Archer, his Arrowes; a Slinger, his Stones; &amp; the
Pikeman, his Lance; all which hee so little cares for, that hee makes but a
jeast of it. In a  word, when he comes to make an end of
this large description which he makes of the Deuill, he concludes that chapter
with this Epiphonema, Non est potest
                     •
                  s quae comparetur ei, The power of the world is not able to compare
with him. Saint Gregorie vpon the fourth Chapter of Iob
noteth, That the Scripture giues the Deuil three kind of names or attributes;
Behemoth, or Elephant; Leuiathan, which some will haue to bee
the Whale; and Auis Rapinae, a Bird of Rapine, that liues onely vpon
prey; Nunquid illudes ei, quasi aui? In which three names hee did
comprehend the power of all the Beasts of the field, of all the Fishes of the
sea, and of all the Birds of the aire. The power of these three sorts of
creatures extends it selfe to these three elements, the Water, the Earth, and
the Aire: and they beeing all deposited in the Deuill, whose habitation is the
Fire, hee comes to haue dominion ouer all the elements. In other places of the
Scripture hee is called a Dragon, a Leopard, a Beare, a Lyon: but these
comparisons come short of the other. And therefore some Doctours expounding
this word Behemoth, say, That it signifies Multitudinem
Bestiarum, a multitude of Beasts; because it includeth in it the force and
poyson of all other sorts of Beasts whatsoeuer. Saint Paul calls him a
Prince of power, the Ruler and Gouernor of this world: For as the state and
power of a Prince is farre beyond that of his Subiects and Vassals; so is the
Deuil in al other things Aduersus Principes &amp; Potestates, &amp; Mundi
rectores, Against the Princes and Powers, and Gouernors of the earth. The
Greeke word is Cosmocratoras, a word of that fulnesse, that diuers
Fathers haue diuersly interpreted it: Tertullian, The possessions of the
world; Hilarie and Saint Hierome, The Mightie of the world, The Lords
of the world. Esay calls him a Barre or a Bol
                  •
               , because the strength of a Prison consists in good
Barres and Bolts, and strong Lockes: Visitauit Dominus super serpentem
vectem, The Lord will visit that creeping Barre. Theodocion translates it
Robustum, The strong Barre: Simmachus, Vectem concludentem, siue
claudentem, The enclosing Barre, or the Barre that shutteth vp; For he
doth shut vp many in his prison, and keepes them in miserable seruitude. Saint
Iohn in his Apocalyps bewaileth the Earth and the Sea,
because the Deuill comes forth enraged fiercely against them; shewing great
sorrow, that God had giuen them such small meanes to be reuenged of him, beeing
a Beast so powerfull, so cruell, so tyrannous, and so bent against them, that
man was turned coward, and become fearefull. But since our Sauior Christ
ouercame him, &amp; hath bound him fast in fetters and chaines of yron, he bids
vs be of good courage, and that we should stand no more in feare of him;
Feare not (saith our Sauiour) I haue ouercome the World.
            
            Many of Gods People when they entred first into the sea shewed
themselues fearefull &amp; cowardly; but after that the powerfull hand of God
had ouerwhelmed the Egyptians, &amp; had thrown them vp dead on the other side
of the sea, the weakest women among them, and those men that were most faint
hearted, with songs of joy, and with Timbrels, did set forth the glorie of this
victorie, and did make a mocke of the power of Pharaoh; They praised the
hand of the Vanquisher, who opened the mouthes of the dumbe, and made the
tongues of Infants eloquent. So likewise did the world liue cow'd before,
by the power of Satan; but after that the powerfull hand of Christ our Sauiour,
left in the Wildernesse the print of that wound which he had giuen him on the
head, the meanest and most cowardly Christian may now make a jest both of him
and Hell. One of the Sages of Greece said, That better was an Armie of Sheepe
that had a Lyon to their captaine, than an Armie of Lyons that had a Sheepe to
their Commander. And therefore albeit wee are but weake and sillie Sheepe, yet
haue we a Lyon to our  Captaine, who hath ouercome our
enemies, The Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda hath ouercome. When
Ioshua
                     •
                  
                ouercame th
                  •
               se fiue Kings of the Ammorites neere
vnto Gibeon, he would haue the Princes of the People to put their feet vpon
their neckes; that seeming vnto him to be a powerfull meanes to put them in
heart, and to serue to encourage the rest of his soldiers not to feare them,
for that God should bring downe their enemies, and put them vnder their feet.
This valiant Captaine did also subdue Zeba and Salmana, and
commanded his sonne, that hee should vnsheath his sword and runne them
through;The maine thing in a Generall, is to f
                     •
                  ee his soldiers from feare.
which he did of purpose to make him gather courage vnto him, and to cast off
all feare. Nor can there greater worth be desired in a Captaine, than to know
how to free his souldiers from feare. When Dauid had smote off
Goliah his head, those of Israel were as bold as Lyons, and the
Philistines were as fearefull as Hares. In the time

                  •
               f Salomon, the Scripture
saith, That Israell did liue in that peace, and so deuoyd of feare, as no men
more, Euerie one vnder his owne Vine, and vnder his owne Figge
tree;3. Reg. 4. not that all of them
had their Vines and Figge-trees, but because they might sleepe quietly and
securely (as the Poets feigne of Tytirus and Melibaeus) vnder
the shade of the broad spredding Beech, singing this Song of joy, Deus
nobis haec otia fecit. All which was a figure of the peace and

                  •
               ecuritie which the Church was to
enioy by the conquest of this our Captaine: (for by warre wee come to the
enioying of peace) and as by his death he did conquer our death; so likewise
(saith Saint Gregorie) it was fit, that the conquering of his
temptation should be the subduing of ours. The Prophet treating how cowardly
the Deuill would remaine after this victorie, saith, Thou hast made him
food for the People of Aethiopia. The Negro's of Zapa and Mandinga haue
piece-meale deuoured him, and eaten him vp, as it were by morcells. For the
world hath not a more fearefull and cowardly Nation than that of the
Negro's,The Negro's of all nations the most cowardly, &amp;
  why. either by reason of their small store of bloud, or for that, that
little they haue is verie cold, and therefore hath the lesse actiuenesse in it.
The Romans would neuer consent that any Negro should bee listed for a souldier.
The vnknowne Authour vnderstandeth by the Aethyopians, those Crowes, which of
all other Fowles that feed vpon flesh, are the most fearefull: which is to bee
seene in this, that delighting so much as they doe, to picke out the eyes of
other creatures, they dare not aduenture to plucke them out vntill they be
dead. Of a coward the Spanish Prouerbe saith, A Moro muerto gran
Lançada, Giue a dead Moore a great blow with a Lance: Which is
spoken by way of reproch of notorious cowards, when they will offer to run a
man through when hee is dead alreadie. In Rome there was great opposition
betwixt two famous Orators, Tully and Metellus; the one was
stout and full of courage, and the other cowardly and timerous: Now when
Metellus Master dyed, he set ouer his Tombe-stone a Crow; Whereat
Tully jeasting, said, That hee now had paid his Master at his death,
for that which hee had taught him in his life. And therefore the Prophet
saying, That the Deuill should be the food of the Negro's, or of Crowes; was to
signifie thereby, that he was not able to put feare into the fearefullest and
most cowardly persons.
            Thirdly, Our Sauiour Christ did pretend in this action of his, to
giue vs a great testimonie of his loue. All his actions proclaime loue;To exemplifie his own loue. but this of his being
tempted, hath one circumstance of loue, that I know not well what can bee more:
For hauing giuen vs both Heauen and earth, and all that therein is, and which
is more, his onely begotten Sonne, with whom hee gaue vs all that good which we
could wish or haue; Quomodo cum illo omnia non nobis donauit? yet did
he alwayes reserue his honour vnto himselfe; I am the Lord, and I will not
giue my  glorie to another. And as Pharaoh
conferred on Ioseph all his authority and power, but not his Crowne
and Scepter, In this thing onely I will be before thee: So God being
most liberall vnto vs, in bestowing all his riches and graces vpon vs; yet was
he euer couetous of his honour. But by yeelding that the Deuill should tempt
him, it seemeth that he did put it in hazard, at least to it's triall: For, to
be tempted, is to be incited and prouoked to sinne, whose malice and
wickednesse hath that opposition and emnitie with God, which if our Sauiour (as
it was impossible) should haue consented vnto, hee should haue lost the name
of the eternall Son of God, and haue caused him to become his enemie for
euer.
            Besides, there is no stroke that strikes so home to a Noble brest,
as to bee ouercome by his enemie. Saul, that he might not die by the
hands of a Philistine, spake to his Sword-bearer to kill him: And his
Sword-bearer not daring to kill him, he killed himselfe. Cato
Vticensis did the like, that he might not become a Slaue to
Caesar, as Plutarch reporteth it. The like did
Cleopatra, beeing but a woman. What presumption then is it, that a
Creature which had beene cast out of Heauen, for a base, in famous, and
disloyall Traitor, should pretend to conquer the Sonne of Heauen?
            Againe, To the Iust (saith Saint Chrysostome) there is
but one Good, and one Euill necessarie: The Good, is God; the Euill, the
offending of God. Iob did not shew so much sorrow for the losse of his
children, his houses, his flocks, and his substance, as he did when his wife
said vnto him, Curse God and die; but that was as a dagger to his
heart. Shall I be angrie and offended with my God? No, though he should kill
mee, yet will I loue him: For I haue no other Good but my God, he is all my
hope, and all my comfort. What then might our Sauiour thinke of the Deuil? How
much should it grieue him to heare him say, Fal down and worship
me.
            
            Lastly, He was willing to be tempted, for that temptation beeing a
thing that we must all of vs necessarily endure,That we may haue an example to follow. no, none of the
best of vs all can auoyd, we may know how to behaue our selues therein, by
following the example of this our noble Captain; Vt cuius munimur auxilio,
erudiamur exemplo, as Pope Leo hath it. Vt mediator esset,
non solum per auditorium, verum etiam per exemplum, as Saint
Austen hath it. Our life is a dayly warrefare, and a continuall
temptation, (not only profitable, but necessarie:) &amp; to those worldlings
that liue (to their seeming) in peace, Wisedome saith, Not knowing Warre,
they call so many euils, Peace: These are they that suffer a more bloudie
and desperate warre than any other. Iob saith, Mans life is but a
Warrefare vpon earth. Saint Gregorie calls it the Gard of our
vertues; For then are we inwardly best preserued, when outwardly wee are
by Gods dispensation tollerably tempted. And amongst many other reasons
which are brought for the proofe hereof, there is one verie powerful; to wit,
That we shal haue therein the especiall fauour and protection of our good God;
so that hee giuing vs strength to endure, we may account it a great happinesse
vnto vs.
            
               Custodit Domin
                     •
                  
animas Sanctorū suorū, God hath an exceeding great care of the soules of his
Saints;
                  Psal. 96. And hauing God on our
side, who can hurt vs? Nonne tu vallasti eum per circuitum?
               
                  Iob
  1. 
               Et vniuersam substantiam eius? The Deuill said vnto God,
talking with him about Iob, Lord, thou doost not onely gard his soule,
but his life, h
                  ••
                honour, and his
goods, as if thou hadst put him into a strong place of defence, vnder locke and
key.Gods protection a safegard. Saint
Gregorie saith, That God so gardeth the house of the Righteous, that
he will not leaue so much as a chinke open for the Deuill to enter thereinto:
And therefore Salomon stiles it an inexpugnable Tower. When the
Sodomites assaulted Lots house, the Angells were not contented with
shutting  of the doore, but did strike the assailants with
blindnesse. When Noah entred into the Arke, God shut the port, and
carried away the key with him. Clausit eum Dominus de foris. The
seuenty Interpreters make this construction of it, that hee did so, that
neither the waters nor the windes might annoy it. In dilun
                     •
                  o aquarum multarum, ad eum non
approximabunt. For God had kalked vp the ports, and euery little chinck or
creuise belonging thereunto. Saint Bernard, expounding those words of
the ninetie one Psalme (Dicet Domino, susceptor meus es tu, &amp; refugium
meum, Deus meus, sperabo in eum., i. I will say vnto the Lord, Thou
art my &amp;c.) asketh the question, Why God, being the God of all,
Dauid in that place cals him twice his God? I answere, That he is the
God of all, in regard of his Creation and Redemption, and other his generall
benefits towards man;God in a particular maner the God of
  the faithfull. but in Temptation, hee is the God of euery indiuiduall
person, as if hee did not busie himselfe, nor thinke vpon any other thing, than
the fauouring of the Iust, and the assisting of him vpon those occasions. Saint
Gregory, declaring those wordes of Christ, Not a haire of your
head shall perish, sayth, That a haire doth not paine vs when it is cut
away from vs, but the cutting of the flesh doth: If that then shall be kept
from perishing, by Gods protection and prouidence ouer vs, which doth not paine
vs; how much more will he take heed, that that shall not perish, which may put
vs to paine?
            Last of all, There is not any thing so notorious, and so
approoued, as the generall good that is gotten by Temptation. From thence grow
those braue Spirits, those valiant Souldiers, and those couragious Captaines,
which wage warre against the Deuill and Hell, keeping him out at the staffes
end, and putting him to the worst. As on the contrary, from Idlenesse come
Cowards, whiteliuerd Souldiers, Faint-hearted, Soule-lesse, and Lazie people.
As long as there were any frontyre-townes in Spaine, for the enemies to make
their inrodes, it had many braue and famous Souldiers, as the Cides,
and the Bernardos. But now there are none but Carpet-Knights, all men
of bombast,Why God in his prouidēce ordained a continuall
  war betwixt Man and the Deuill. made of nothing but softnesse and
delicacie, their Armour is turned into gay clothes; and their stiffe Launces,
into starcht bottle bands and beards. They all did then smell of Gunpoulder,
but now stincke of Amber, Siuet, and other Indian Gummes. Athanasius
askes the question, Why the prouidence of God did ordaine this continuall warre
betweene the Deuils and Men? And the answere is, That thereby, the valour of
Gods Souldiers might bee knowne. Saint Ambros sayth, That the Deuill
workes his owne destruction by his dayly tempting of Men, for by seeking to
weaken their Bodies, hee strengthneth their Soules. And that Iob, when
hee sate vpon the dung-hil with his pot-sheard in his hand to scrape off his
scabbes, made all Hell affraid, and to stand amased at his patience.
            
               Ductus est Iesus a Spiritu in desertum vt tentaretur.
               
                  Hee was led by the Spirit into the Desart, that hee might
  bee tempted. The holy Ghost was a guide to all our Sauiours Actions: Hee
  was Dux &amp; Comes (as Saint Cyprian saith) or as
  Esay hath it, Spiritus sanctus, ductor eius fuit, i. The
  holy Spirit was his Leader. But in none of our Actions makes the Scripture
  any mention that the holy Ghost leadeth vs vnto, but onely to Temptation. And
  this is expressed with wordes that carry a kind of force with them, though
  voluntary and sweet. Expulit, agebatur, ductus est, Hee drew him not, hee
  was chased, hee was led. And the mysterie thereof is, that no man ought to
  presume, considering his weakenesse, so much vpon his owne securitie and
  confidence, that hee should enter into Temptation, vnlesse the holy Ghost take
  him vp as it were by the haire of the  head, and set him
  into it. And the truth of this doctrine is deliuered vnto vs by Victor
  Antiochenus,
                  Temporall victories gotten by fighting,
 Sprituall by flying. Saint Iohn, Chrisostome, Gregorius Nissenus,
  Euthimius, &amp; many other Saints of God. In corporall warre, it is
  greater courage to fight, than to flie; but in the spirituall warfare, the
  assurance of the Victorie consists in flying. And God would rather haue vs to
  bee cowards through feare, than couragious through presumption; and therefore
  hee first promiseth vs his Protection, that is, his Ayd, and his Fauour.
  Deus refugium &amp; virtus, adiutor in opportunitatibus, &amp; in
  tribulatione, i. God is a helper in due season, &amp; in
  tribulation. Hee first sayes, he will bee our refuge, and afterwards our
  helper. Flye therefore from danger, and haue recourse vnto God, and beeing
  sheltred vnder the shadow of his wings, and vpheld by the strength of his Arme,
  thou needst not feare any harme that Hell can doe vnto thee. So that God is not
  bound to fauour thee in those temptations which thou doost thrust thy selfe
  into, but in those that thou seekest to shun. Saint Austen, aduising I
  know not whom, that they should not talke and conuerse with Women so familiarly
  as they did; they excused themselues vnto him, telling him, that they onely
  did so, that they might meete with some Temptations wherewith to encounter. But
  this glorious Doctor plainely told them; Herein, you seeke nothing but dangers,
  and stumbling blockes to cause you to fall. And as it is fit to take from
  before the eyes of the franticke, all those images and pictures which may moue
  passion in him, for that they wil be an occasion to make him madder than euer
  he was before; so, ought a sinner to auoid all the vanities of this World.
                     Psal. 54. 
                  Ecce elongaui fugiens, &amp; mansi
  in solitudine. Saint Bernard hath well obserued, that for his
  better ease and quiet, this holy King, did not onely leaue his owne Citie, but
  fled farre from it. And hee that shall flie from the occasions of sinning,
  performes no small matter. But hee that shall flie a farre off from them, will
  find it to bee most for his ease. Temptation, as it is the Deuils acte, is ill;
  and God doth not will it positiuely, but permissiuely hee doth; so sayth Saint
  Chrisostome: Aduising vs, that wee should not seeke after them, but if
  they chance to set vpon vs, then are wee to stand to it, and valiantly to fight
  it out. This our Sauiour Christ would insinuate to his Disciples, in the
  garden, when hee sayd vnto them; Watch and pray that yee enter not into
  Temptation.
                  
                     Mat. 28. For a man to
  sleepe, when hee is in daunger, and not to flie vnto God for succour, is to
  seeke after Temptation. Saint Austen, Saint Cyprian, Saint
  Gregorie, and Saint Chrysostome, say, That this is the
  meaning of that prayer which 
                     〈◊〉
                  
  daily make, And lead vs not into Temptation. Which carries with it a
  double sence. The one, Lead vs not (ô Lord) into Temptation, for our
  weakenesse and frailtie is exceeding great. So doth Petrus
  Chrisologus expound it. But because it is not a fitting language for a
  Souldier to desire of his Captaine, that hee should not send him foorth to
  fight; that other sence is more plaine, Suffer vs not (ô Lord) to
  fall into Temptation.
                  Though wee ought to suffer for
 Christs sake, wee should not yet seeke it. But if thou wilt permit that
  wee must bee tempted, yet consent not (ô Lord) that wee bee ouercome.
  And this sence, Saint Austen seemeth to approue in that his sermon,
  de Monte. But in what sence soeuer you take it, it is very true, that
  no man ought rashly to run himselfe into danger; And Saint Cyprian
  sayth, That no man should presume to offer his throat to bee cut by a tyrants
  knife, out of a desire that he hath to suffer for our Sauiours sake, but that
  hee waight his time and tarry till they take him and put him vpon the racke.
  Lactantius Firmianus sayth, That hee that vnnecessarily ventures vpon
  danger, ought not to bee stiled valiant, nor indeed is, but ought rather to bee
  accounted rash and inconsiderate: For hee that is truely valiant, is neither
  rash in daring, nor imprudent in fearing, nor weake in suffering; as Saint
  Austen hath  well noted. When the waues and windes
  of Temptation, blow, and beat hard against mans brest, and seeming to
  ouerwhelme him, hee remaineth firme as a Rocke, this is true fortitude indeed.
  In Dauids Tower (which is a Type of the Church) all the weapons of
  warre were defensiue, as Shields, and Targets, and Morrions; Mille clypei
  pendent ex ea. And it is further added, That these were the Armes and
  weapons of the strong and valiant men.
               Some will say, That there is no worke of vertue which is not
  subiect to temptation. Who did euer begin to walke in the way of perfection,
  who did not meet with a thousand phantasies? Diabolus enim semper per
  primordia boni pulsat, &amp; tentat rudimenta virtutum, saith
  Chrysologus; it beeing therefore needefull that wee should flie from
  temptation, shall it not bee likewise necessarie, that wee flie from
  perfection. Hereunto Thomas answereth, That to follow perfection is a
  worke of the holy Ghost, who is the Author thereof; and hauing him for our
  second, to bring vs into the Field, wee need not to feare. They that in the
  Primitiue Church did people the Deserts and solitarie places, did no doubt
  perceiue that they should be set vpon and tempted: But because their end was
  not to play bo-peepe with the Deuill, and to goe about to mocke him, but to
  serue their God, and to enioy his fauour, they did not care a fig for all his
  temptations. In a word, The temptations that wee are to flie from, are those
  which of their owne nature dispose vs vnto sinne; as vnlawfull games, offensiue
  conuersations, ill companie, dancing, masking, and idle Enterludes: for he
  that toucheth Pitch shall be defiled therewith. Saint Paul writing to
  the Hebrews,
                     Heb. 12. giues vs this good
  aduice, Deponentes omne pondus, &amp; circumstans nos peccatum, Laying
  euery weight aside, and the sinne that stands about vs. Where the word
  Circumstans is much to be weighed: for there are many things, which
  albeit they bee not sin, yet are they verie neere vnto sinne. And (as Saint
  Austen saith) as Gods mercie doth round and gard the gates about the
  house of the Righteous, Circumuolitabat à longè misericordia
  tua: So likewise the malice of the Deuill doth round our soules, and
  spreddeth his nets round about vs to intrap vs: and therfore we must
  continually fixe our eye vpon Christ Iesus our onely Sauiour; Aspicientes
  in authorem fidei: that when the Deuill shall come to tempt vs, he shall
  finde himselfe so stript of all occasions to cause vs to sinne, that hee shall
  bee forced to betake himselfe to stones, as he did against our Sauiour.
            
            
               Vt tentaretur à Diabolo.
               
                  That he might be tempted of the Deuill. It hath beene
  treated of alreadie,Our Sauiour could not be tempted either
 by the World or the Flesh. That the temptation of the World and the
  Flesh could not take hold on Christ, in regard of that inward repugnance, and
  intrinsicall opposition which hee had with weakenesse and ignorance. And
  therefore it is commonly said, that the one is incident to the weake; the other
  proper vnto fooles. Of Thales Milesius they asked many questions, and
  to all he gaue conuenient &amp; fitting answers; as, What is the most antient?
  God: What the fairest thing that he created? The world: What the lightest?
  Thought: What the strongest? Necessitie: What the easiest, and yet the
  hardest? The knowledge of a mans selfe: What the foolishest? The heart of a man
  that is giuen to the world. There being therefore deposited in our Sauiours
  brest all the treasures of Gods wisedome, hee could not bee tempted by the
  World, and lesse by the Flesh. And I verily beleeue, that though it was
  impossible for him to be tempted; yet if it had beene possible, hee would not
  haue consented to these temptations, to the end that he might aduise vs, that
  when the Deuill should set vpon vs with these weapons, we may giue our selues 
   almost for lost. Funiculus triplex difficile rumpitur,
  A threefold cord is not easily broken. That a twine thread, or a single
  slender wand is soone broken; but a threefold cord, or a bundle of stickes,
  had neede of a strong arme to cracke them in twaine. The ordinarie vse of
  fighting is, one against one: And the Prouerbe saith, Neque Hercules contra
  duos, Not Hercules against two. But when this Squadron of the world, the
  flesh, &amp; the Deuil shal come against you, it shal be extream rashnesse to
  stay wiating for him. When Sodome was set on fire, the Angell said to Lot,
  Saue thy selfe in the Mountaine: he replied, Not so my Lord, There is a
  city here neere to flie vnto; Nunquid non modica est? Is it not a little
  one? ô let me escape thither, and my soule shall liue: As if hee
  should haue said, I know that in great Cities there is no hope of life and
  safetie; for if wee could in them be safe, the Scripture would not so often
  inculcate in our eares, Fugite de medio Babilonis.
               
            
            
               Cum jeiunasset quadraginta diebus, &amp; quadraginta
  noctibus, postea esurijt.
               
                  When he had fasted fortie dayes and fortie nights, he was
  afterwards hungrie. Saint Luke saith, That all this while our
  Sauiour had eaten nothing, Et nihil manducauit in diebus illis;
  Cannonizing by this act the sanctitiy of Fasting. S. Austen goes about
  to paralell this our Sauiours fasting with that of Moses,
                  Our Sauiours Fast how differing from that of Moses and
 Elias. who fasted twice fortie dayes; and with that of Elias,
  who fasted once in the same manner; signifying thereby, that the Gospell was
  not contrarie to the Law, nor the Prophecies foretold by those holy Prophets.
  But there was this diffrence betwixt theirs, and that of our Sauiors fasting;
  that Moses and Elias were not a hunger'd neither in, nor
  after their fasting; but Christ postea esurijt, he had no sooner ended
  his fasting, but hunger seised on his bowells: And the reason thereof was (as
  Maximu
                        •
                     
                   renders it) that
  God to shew his greatnesse and his power, did inwardly sustaine and feede them;
  but our Sauiour Christ hauing in him on the one side the power of God, and on
  the other side the nature of man, When he had fasted fortie daies and
  fortie nights, he was afterwards an hungrie.
               
               From those fortie dayes that Desert tooke his name, beeing
  called Quarentana. It is a rough and rugged Mountaine, some foure
  miles from Iordan, where our Sauiour was baptized, and two from Ierico. And
  because it was such a wild and solitarie place, Saint Marke addeth,
  Eratque cum bestijs, in token there was no better companie there. And
  they that make description of the Holy Land, report, That there are bred
  therein many blacke and fearefull Vipers.
               
                  When he had fasted fortie dayes. That voyce from
  Iordan, This is my beloued Son, made the Deuill the eagerer to set
  vpon him,Why our Sauiour would bee hungerie. and to
  challenge him the Field. But Saint Chrysostome saith, that this our
  Sauiours fasting kept him still aloofe off from him, and made him so cowardly,
  that he was affraid to venture vpon him: and therefore did our Sauiour of
  purpose submit himselfe vnto hunger, that the Deuill might thereby be
  encouraged to come on the more boldly. Thomas noteth it, That Fasting
  is such a weapon, that the Deuill dares not to come within the reach of it; for
  it makes Men to be like vnto Angels: And euer since that Lucifer fell
  from Heauen, he hath liued stil in feare of his own shadow. Leo the
  Pope saith, That there are a certaine sort of terrible Deuills, against whom no
  coniurations nor exorcismes can preuaile, or doe any good; onely they cannot
  withstand the force of Fasting. And of these our Sauiour Christ saith,
  This kind of Deuill is not cast out, but by Prayer and Fasting. Saint
  Basil saith, That our Sauiour Christ would not consent, that the Flesh
  which hee had taken of our nature  vpon him, should bee
  tempted, till he had armed it with fasting: Not that hee could incurre any
  daunger, but onely to teach vs how to stand vpon our guard. Athanasius
  sayth, That the Deuill hath suborned many in this life, to make show of beeing
  zealous of your welfare, and that they should goe about to persuade you, that
  you doe your selfe wrong in fasting, and that it makes you looke leane, and
  yellow, and spoyles your complexion. And as in Paradise, hee persuaded our
  Mother, by the Serpents insinuation, to eat of the forbidden Fruit; so now by
  his factors doth he persuade many to feasting, but none to fasting. Notable to
  this purpose, is that Historie of the Prophet whome God sent to Bethel against
  King Ieroboam, giuing him in charge, that hee should neither eate nor
  drinke in that place. He boldly deliuered his message, but durst not receiue of
  the King, that entertainement which he offered him; but as he returned
  homeward, a false Prorphet came foorth, &amp; meeting him on the way, said
  vnto him, I pray ye depart not hence without seeing of your friends, &amp;
  receiuing such poore cheere as wee can make you. He told him that he had order
  from God not to do it. Then sayd the false Prophet, I haue had a reuelation to
  thecontrarie. Inconclusion the true Prophet beeing deceiued by the false
  Prophet, did eate. But in his iourney home a Lyon met him, and killed him. God
  aduising him that had deceiued him, of this sad Accident.
               Whence I inferre, That if it were a fault in the true Prophet to
  eat, by giuing too light credit to the false Prophet; the offence will bee no
  lesse in you,Motiues to induce vs to Fasting. by
  giuing too easie beleefe to Satans Agent, who aduiseth thee, that thou
  shouldst not fast.
               Secondly, if hee that beeing deceiued, did eate, doth deserue
  the punishment of death, what shall hee deserue, that did deceiue him? And
  therefore God did notifie to the false Prophet the death of the true Prophet,
  to the end that the inequalitie of the sin, might persuade him, what kind of
  punishment hee did deserue.
               Thirdly, the true Prophet payd the price of his sinne, with the
  losse of his life; but by repentance he saued his Soule. And one assured token
  thereof was, that the Lyon stood by him and guarded his Body, till they had
  giuen it buriall. But the false Prophet, had much more to answere for, and a
  greater reckoning to make. For if a light sinne, were so seuerely punished; how
  much more a greater? This Doctrine doth much concerne your cheu'rel-conscience
  Phisitions, who vpon euery light occasion giue licences for not fasting; &amp;
  those cockering Mothers, who will not suffer their daughters to fast, fearing
  it would spoyle their colour, and marre their complexion; whereas in verie
  deed, nothing doth make the countenance so freshand so cleare as fasting doth;
  as those Histories of Iudith, and those Babilonian children
  sufficiently proue, whose fasting made their faces as faire, as if they had
  beene so many Angels.
               
                  Fortie dayes and fortie nights. To what end (will some
  say) serueth so much fasting? Wee are not able to imitate this act of our
  Sauiours. I answer, wee are to fast for two respects. The one, That many of our
  Sauiours miracles ought rather to bee admired, than imitated. The other, that
  by this his fasting, he layd thereby a greater obligation vpon vs to serue him;
  and that wee may by those poore fasts that we keepe, show therby, that we much
  both approue and esteeme that long fast of his.
               
                  Hee was afterward hungrie. Theodoret sayth, That when
  the Deuill came to know that Christ began to grow hungrie, he did then
  certainly assure himself of victorie. Philon discoursing on the life
  of Moses, That for a man to suffer hunger  and
  thirst, it is verie great torment, and not to be endured, Graue est Domine,
  sitis &amp; fames. In the Desert God with-held the giuing of Manna for
  some few daies from his People; and the Text saith, That he did it for to proue
  them. And it is a great triall of our vertue, to suffer hunger for Gods cause;
  it is such a storme as is able to put a man besides his wits. When
  Ioseph dreamed of those seuen yeares of dearth, specified by those
  seuen leane Kyne, Theodoret hath noted, That he then foresaw, that the
  hunger of his brethren would force them to fall downe and worship him whom
  before they so much scorned and abhorred. The Deuill now thought himselfe
  cocke-sure, and thought to make his entrie at this little hole, and to get
  within him. Ecclesiasticus saith, That sinne is like the dropping of
  raine, which by little and little sokes through the wall, till at last both it,
  and the house whereon it stands, fall suddenly to the ground. God commanded
  Ezechiel, That he should take a tyle-stone, and paint thereon the holy
  Citie of Ierusalem,
                     Ezech. 4. v. 1.
  drawing round about it a great Armie, Sume tibi laterem, &amp;c. The
  like doth the Deuill; he desires no more of thee but a Tyle-stone, or the like
  toy, and out of that he will make Towers and walles, and bulwarkes, and armies
  of souldiers to besiege thee.
            
            
               
                  Accessit Tentator, The Tempter drew neere.
               This word Tempter (as Rupertus hath noted it)
  containeth in it these two things:
               The one, The Deuills malice.
               The other, His craft and subtletie.
               Touching the first, he hath no other occupation saue doing of
  ill, &amp; working of mischiefe.The Deuills trade onely to
 doe Euill. The vnknowne Author expounding those words of Dauid, They
  meditated deceit all the day long, saith, That these are those Deuils
  which spend all the whole day in plotting of mischiefe, and in working deceit,
  as if this were giuen them to taske, and were hired so to doe. There is no
  day-labourer, bee hee neuer so hard a Workeman, but towards high noone doth
  rest himselfe a little: but the Deuill,His diligence in
 following it. 
                  Dolos, tota die meditabatur. It is said in the
  Reuelation, That certaine Locusts came out of a bottomlesse Pit, and
  that they had a King ouer them, which is the Angell of the bottomlesse Pit,
  whose name in the Hebrew Tongue is Abaddon; in the Greeke,
  Apollyon, and in the Latine, Exterminans. Here is like to
  like, such souldiers, such a Captaine. Your Locusts neuer do good, but hurt,
  and this is the Deuills office; and therfore is he termed Exterminans.
  Dauid calls him by the name of Dragon, who with his verie breath doth
  taint the aire, and kills therewith the Birds that flie to and fro therein:
  Exterminauit eum aper de silua, The Boare of the Mountaine destroyeth the
  Lords Vineyard; he ouerthroweth Monasteries; through sloath and idlenesse
  soliciting Religious men to be negligent in comming to Church, carelesse in
  preaching, and loose in their life. In the marriage bed he soweth tares,
  treacheries, and lightnesse. With wordly men he persuadeth, That he is no bodie
  that is not rich; and therefore, bee it by hooke or by crooke, by right, or by
  wrong, he would haue thee get to be wealthie. In a word, he is generally set
  vpon mischiefe; and therefore hath hee the name of Tempter. But it is to be
  noted, that he doth then most hurt, when hee is most prouoked. Petrus
  Chrysologus saith, Est quidem Diabolus per se nequam, fit tamen
  nequior, prouocatus. Like vnto your Dogge, who barkes out of custome, but
  if you throw stones at him he will barke the more: or like vnto the Bull in the
  Place, who beeing houted at, and galled, growes thereby more mad, and more
  fierce: or like vnto the Boare when he is wounded with the Speare; or the
  Beare, who  enraged, sets more furiously vpon the Hunter
  that pursues him, and throwes his Darts at him. There was a voyce alreadie
  thundred out against him from Heauen, in the riuer of Iordan. Our Sauiours
  fasting was as stones throwne against a barking Curre; his being in the Desert
  was no fit place for him to worke his will, considering those good meditations
  wherein our Sauiour was then occupied: And therefore seeing himselfe thus
  crost, he would labour to make his aduantage, and trie what he could doe by
  the helpe of these other stones, as he had then a purpose to employ them.
               Touching the second, to wit, His craft and his subtletie,
  notable is that place of Saint Paul, We are not to wrestle with flesh and
  bloud, but with the snare of the Deill: The Apostle doth not say, against
  his force and his power,
                     Ephes. 6.12. though
  that bee great; but against his craft &amp; his subtletie, against his trickes
  &amp; deuices, &amp; against his plots and stratagems. Tertullian
  renders it, Machinationes; Saint Hierome, Adinuentiones; and
  the Reuelation, Altitudines Sathanae, The depth and profunditie of
  his policies and deepe reaches. Saint Chrysostome expounding that
  phrase of Principes tenebrarum, The Princes of darkenesse, saith, That
  they are not Noctis tenebrae, sed maliciae; the darkenesse of malice
  being greater than that of the night. Spiritualia nequitiae, cui nomina
  mille, mille nocendi artes, (i.) Spirituall wickednesses,
                  
                     Virgil. E
                           •
                        e.
                   
                  which haue a thousand names, and a thousand
  wayes to hurt, as the Poet hath it. A certaine Monke asked the Deuill,
  How he was called? He told him, Mille modis artifex vocor, I am called a
  cunning Workeman. And therefore the Scripture stiles him Serpent, and a
  winding Snake, that rolls vp himselfe as it were in a circle. Visitabit
  Dominus super Serpentem tortuosum, saith Esay. Eductus est coluber
  tortuosus, (saith Iob:) There is no Labyrinth so intricate, and
  so full of doublings &amp; turnings, as is he. It is much doubt which of the
  two is most requisit in a Captaine, Virtus, an Dolus? Courage, or
  Craft? In the Deuill, if his power be incomparable, his subtletie is much
  more. Some of the antient Saints haue put it to question, Why the Deuill did
  appeare vnto our Mother Eue in the forme of a Serpent? Saint
  Chrysostom saith,Why the Deuill appeared to Eue in
 the forme of a Serpent. That God did giue him the libertie to make free
  choice of any one of the beasts of the Field, which soeuer he had most mind
  vnto; and, that he made choice of the Serpent, as of the wisest and subtillest,
  as the sacred Text deliuereth vnto vs. Saint Augustine, That it was
  not in his election to chuse any other; to the end that the deceit and
  subtletie of the Serpent might stirre vp a kind of jealousie and warinesse in
  our Mother: For craft and cunning haue euer done more hurt than open force. The
  Wolfe is then most to bee feared when he puts himselfe into Sheepes cloathing,
  or a Lyon in a Foxes skin; (which is the condition of your Heretickes.)
  Dauid speaking of those which follow the Deuils partie, saith,
  Partes Vulpium erunt. The Spouse calles them little Foxes, Vulpes
  paruulas, qui demoliuntur Vineas, Alluding in them, to the Deuills.
               Vpon this craft and subtletie of the Deuill, Saint
  Gregorie and S. Ciril ground this conceit, That the Deuill is
  not like your foolish Physitions, who with one receit cure diuers diseases; but
  against euerie vertue, good inclination, and motions of the Spirit, he hath
  such sundrie temptations, and so fit for euery mans humour, that if the tempted
  will but cast his eyes towards them, it is a thousand to one that he is not
  taken with them. God askt of Iob, Answer me, By what way the heat is parted
  vpon earth? Gregorie vnfoldeth this question,
                     Iob 38.24. He hath a Hooke for euery humor. By
  those coles which the Deuill scat
                     •
                  ereth abroad amongst the People of this world; as those of
  couetousnesse, reuenge, and wantonnesse. Euerie one carries a cole in his
  bosome that burnes and consumes him; In via hac qua amb
                        •
                     labam absconderunt laqueum mihi, When I
  thought my selfe safest, walked securely, and followed my pleasures and
  delights  without suspition of danger, then was the net
  laid for me, &amp;c.
               
               But for all the Deuills cunning shifts, and for all his sleights
  and subtleties, he can neuer so wholly disguise himselfe, but that he will
  alwaies leaue one clouen foot vncouered, whereby (which is no small comfort
  vnto vs) we may come to know him. Iob speaking of the Deuill, in that
  metaphore of the Leuiathan; amongst many other properties aboue specified, he
  mentioneth this one, Lucebit post cum semita; He leaues behind him a
  white path in the sea, like vnto that froth which a great Ship causeth, when
  she hath a stiffe gale of wind in the poop of her. Whereby he signifieth vnto
  vs, That the Deuill which way soeuer he goes, leaues some signe behind him. At
  the feet of Saint Michael they paint the Deuill, with the faire bodie
  of an Angell, but with the foule taile of a Dragon. For albeit at the first
  sight he transfigure himselfe into an Angell of Light, yet in the end he will
  discouer himselfe to bee the Prince of Darkenesse. The Deuill hath beene seene
  to preach in the habit of a religious Frier, verie deuoutly, appearing as an
  Angell of Light, persuading the People to repentance, and communicating great
  comfort vnto them; but in the end, all his Sermons haue ended in melancholly
  passions. For the Deuills Reuelations runne a contrarie course to Gods▪
  for these, although they somewhat trouble vs at the beginning, yet they end
  euermore in peace and comfort: but those of the Deuill, though they begin in
  joy, yet they end in sorrow.
            
            
               Si filius Dei es, dic vt lapides isti panes fiant.
               
                  If thou be the Sonne of God, command that these stones be
  made bread. The first passage of this temptation, was the Deuills
  seeming-pittie and compassion of the great hunger that our Sauiour suffered. I
  was present at thy Baptisme, and at that applause which Heauen did then giue
  thee; but now I see how weake and wanne thou art growne through thy too much
  fasting, which makes mee to doubt that thou art not the Sonne of God. The
  Deuill is a great prouoker to Gluttonie;The Deuill a great
 prouoker to Gluttonie, and why. he doth solicite the pampering of the
  flesh, hee proposeth the gripings of the stomacke, and the aking of the head,
  through too much fasting: but all at the soules cost. Inimico non credas in
  aternum, (i.) Beleeue not thy enemie at all: Which phrase of
  speech is principally to be vnderstood of the Deuill; for hee neuer offers thee
  his seruice but to thy hurt. Saint Gregorie makes this note, That the
  Deuill taking from Iob his children, his houses, his heards of
  cattell, and his flockes of Sheepe, and in a word, all the good things that hee
  had; yet hee left him his wife, but onely that she might doe the Deuill
  seruice, Calidè cuncta diripuit,
                  
                     Eccle. 11.33.

                     auit, It was his cunning to take away
  all; but it was a greater p
                        ••
                     ce of
  cunning to leaue him his Helpe. The Deuill did not doe this out of
  forgetfulnesse, nor carelesnesse, nor out of any desire that hee had to leaue
  Iob any comfort at all, for he did not wish him so much good, but that
  hee hoped shee would be a meanes to mooue him to impatiencie, and to driue him
  to despaire. True it is, that all his fauours tend to make the way easie (but
  at your cost) to bring vs to Hell. Hee offered our Sauiour bread of stones; but
  on condition, that he himselfe must take the paines to mold it. Attende
  tibi à pestifero, fabric
                        ••

  God, command as a God. Thy Dicere is Facere; Dic vt sedeant,

  Moses, when hee drew water from out the Rocke, and not 
   his want of Faith, as some other would enforce: For,

                  Command that these stones. Thy Father calls thee Sonne,
  and yet reduceth thee to that miserie, that to keepe thy selfe from staruing,
  hee driues thee to that necessitie, that thou must of force he compelled to
  make these stones bread. This difference is there betwixt the Sinner and the
  Righteous, That the Deuill persuades the Sinner, that hee may make bread of
  stones▪ 
                  
                     •
                  nd Iudas,
  that hee may make money of Christ: But the Righteous will rather die for
  hunger, beeing well assured, that God euen in this his hunger is able to
  sustaine him.
               
                  Command that these stones. The Deuill tempts him with
  stones, with such things wherein are scarce to be found any signe of danger:
  For hee alwaies holdeth the victorie to bee so much the more glorious, by how
  much the lesser is the occasion whereby he winnes it. Lot flies out of
  Sodome in the companie of his daughters, and hauing escaped that fearefull
  fire, the Deuil tempts the father by his daughters; whose raging lust, neither
  the fearefull example of their mother, whom their eyes had so lately seene
  turned into a Piller of Salt, nor the Lawes of Reason, nor of Nature, could
  once bridle or restraine. But you will say they were women; and what will not a
  woman doe to satisfie her longing? but that Lot should consent to so
  vnlawfull an act, beeing a man, nay; and so just a man as the Scripture
  commends him to be, it seemeth somewhat strange. Alas, (good old man) his
  daughters had made him drunke; and being so wearie and heauie hearted as hee
  was, to see the lamentable destruction of Sodome, it was not much that he
  should drinke, being importuned thereunto; &amp; they that could not find any
  water when hee called for it, could make a shift to fetch him wine. In all that
  fortie yeares peregrination of the children of Israell,Why
 God allowed the Israelites no Wine, till they came into the land of
 Promise. we do not read that euer God gaue them wine: Twice did he giue
  them water out of the rocke, and twelue Fountaines in Helim; hee gaue them
  likewise Manna and Quailes: but not a drop of wine that they saw till they came
  to the Land of Promise. And surely this was thus ordered by the Councell of
  Heauen; for if hauing but water they mutined so often, what would they haue
  done, had they had wine? When Abraham did thrust the bondwoman out of
  doores, he furnished her with bread and water: and Procopius saith,
  That he would not giue her any wine; for Agar signifies
  Suen̄a-fiestas, A Feast-dreamer: And this holy Father would not by
  giuing her wine, encrease the occasion, seeing shee dreamed thereon when shee
  dranke but water. But to returne to our purpose; Lots daughters
  tempted their father, there beeing in the caue wherin he was, no other either
  possible or imaginable occasion. To him that is desperatly minded, though ye
  put away from him and remooue out of his reach all manne
                     •
                   of halters and cords, for feare hee should hang
  himselfe therewith; yet if he be set vpon it, he wil make shift with a garter,
  a hat-band, a girdle, or some one thing or other, to worke his owne
  destruction.
               
                  If thou be the Sonne of God. It was a bold dis-respect
  of Satans, and a presumptuous part in him, that hee should make any the least
  doubt, that Christ was the Sonne of God; but farre greater impudencie, that hee
  should dare in tempting him, to tel him, All the world shal be thine, if thou
  wilt but fall down &amp; worship

                   me. King
  Ahabs Captaine came to the foot of the Mountaine where Elias
  then remained, and said vnto him, Come downe thou Seruant of God, for the King
  hath sent me for thee. If I am (said the Prophet) the Seruant of God, let fire
  come down from Heauen, and burne vp thee, and those that are come along with
  thee; for thou oughtst not to speake with that little respect as thou doost, to
  Gods Seruant. What irreuerence is it then in the Deuil, to doubt whither hee
  were the Sonne of God, or no? I answer, That he shewed therein a great deale of
  irreuerence, but verie little feare. The more you sauour of God, the more
  impudently will he presse you: Ecce Sathanas expetiuit vt cribaret vos,
  sicut triticum, Behold, Sathan hath desired to sift you euen as wheat. The
  word Vos, You, carries a great emphasis with it; And he compares them
  to wheat, for the Birds abide in the fields, and the Grapes are out in the
  Vines; but your wheat is housed and laid vp safe vnder locke and key: For you
  are they that I make my treasure, and will as charily looke vnto you. There are
  a great sort of people that walke now at this present houre vp and downe the
  streets, some in one place, and some in another, of whom the Deuill makes no
  reckoning at all, he will deale hereafter with them at better leisure: but for
  one of Gods Saints, that is guarded, protected, and defended by God, and is
  fenced about as a Rose amongst Thornes; for this, he will turne and returne,
  and vse a thousand shifts to get it. Nunquid auis discolor hareditas mea
  mihi? Venite properate omnes bestiae, congregamini ad deuorandum, As
  Birds doe flie about a wall that is painted with diuers colours; so doe the
  Nations in persecuting the People that are consecrated to my seruice, and those
  that I fauour. In conclusion, Saint Hilarie saith, In
  sanctificatis maxime diaboli tentamenta grassantur, (i.) The Deuills
  temptations are euer rifest among the Godly. And therefore Dauid
  said, Custodi me Domine, quia sanctus sum, Keepe me ô Lord, because
  I am holy, &amp;c.
               
               
                  If thou be the Sonne of God. It is no new thing with
  the Deuill, to helpe himselfe by setting your selfe against your selfe; it is
  one of the best weapons, that he hath against you, and your selfe hath no
  greater enemie than your selfe. Keepe me ô Lord (saith
  Dauid) out of the hand of the sinner. Saint Bernard
  giues this glosse vpon it, Lord, I am hee, and therefore custodi me
  à meipso. If in thy Religion thou doe not guard thy selfe from thy
  selfe; if in the Desert thou die by thine owne hands, Ad quid venisti?
  Wherefore didst thou come?
               
               
                  If thou be the Sonne of God, command that these stones.
  If thou beest the Sonne of God, it comes to thee by inheritance to worke
  miracles vpon stones. Iacob had a stone for his pillow, and there thy
  father shewed him Heauen; and set vp a ladder, by which the Angells ascended
  and descended. To the Children of Israell he did by stones a thousand fauours,
  extracting from them Water, Oyle, and Honey, Eduxit mel de petra, olcumque
  desaxo durissimo. And therefore it is not much that thou shouldst of these
  stones make bread. Wherein canst thou more manifest thy selfe to be the Sonne
  of God, than in sauing thine owne life, and in supplying thine owne wants? But
  this is that language which the Iewes vsed to our Sauiour at the foot of the
  Crosse; If he be King of Israell, let him vnloose those nailes that haue
  fastned him to the Crosse, and let him free himselfe from the power of Rome,
  and then the world shall acknowledge him to bee the same himselfe professeth.
  As also of that bad theefe, Saue thy selfe and vs. These thought (it
  should seeme) That to be King of the Iewes, and the Sonne of God, consisted in
  the sauing of himselfe and them.
               
                  Sifilius Dei es. Petrus Chrysologus is of opinion, That
  the Deuill here played the foole egregiously; Cupis, ô Daemon
  tentare, sed nescis, Thou desirest to tempt, but  but
  knowest not how. Foure thousand yeares and vpwards hadst thou exercised
  thy old trade, and yet thou now seemest to know lesse euery day than other. Is
  it possible, that thou shouldst bee such an Asse, as to offer stones to one
  that was now growne weake and readie to faint through too much fasting? Saint
  Ierome harpt vpon this string: Either hee was God, (sayth hee) or he
  was not God. If he were God, it was rashnesse in him to tempt him; if he were
  not God, he could not make bread of stones. But herein the Deuill shewed more
  malice than wit;His malice oftentimes outruns his
 wit. questionlesse he did vpon this occasion, as much as either he
  could, or knew. For others (as Saint Austen hath noted it) hee
  tempteth according to the measure of their strength, because God will not let
  out the rope to giue him any larger scope; but towards our Sauiour Christ, hee
  shewed the vtmost of his power and malice. And though hee did not greatly care,
  whether hee did eate or not eate, but had only a purpose to perplex and trouble
  our Sauiour, and to put him out of his holy Meditations, he did offer only that
  vnto him, which was precisely necessary for the preseruation of mans life; and
  which a wise man ought to accept of, if hee were not madde or foolish. How much
  more should a man that is hunger-staru'd, attempt any thing rather than famish
  for lacke of food. Iudas will rather make money of Christ than starue.
  The mother sell her daughter, the father kill his children, the wife forsake,
  if not dishonour the bed of her husband. And therefore the Deuill was not
  herein so verie a foole as some would make him.
            
            
               Scriptum est, non in solo pane viuit homo.
               
                  T'is written, man liueth not by bread alone. Our
  Sauiour Christ would not doe this miracle at the Deuils intreatie; For his
  miracula, were beneficia, His miracles were benefits, they
  did alwayes tend to good, but this did not. For though he should haue turned
  all the stones in the Wildernesse into Bread, the Deuil would haue beene as
  very a Deuill as hee was before. Saint Austen sayth, That our Sauiour
  made Wine of Water, but not Bread of Stones; because from the former miracle
  followed the Faith of his Disciples, Et crediderunt in eum, Discipuli
  eius: But no good could come of this. Hee restored to Malchus,
  the eare which Saint Peter had cut off; but before Herod,
  would not so much as open his mouth. Saint Paul cured the father of
  Publius of a hot burning Feauer, and many other that were sicke; but
  to his beloued Disciple Timothie, being very ill, he said vnto him,
  Vtere modico vino propter stomachū &amp; frequētes tuas
  infirmitates, i. Vse a little wine for thy stomackes sake, and for
  thy other infirmities. S. Gregorie dwelling on this place sayth,
  O blessed Apostle, thou healest an Infidell with miracles, as a Saint, but
  curest thy disciple with receipts, as a Physitian. But hee answereth this,
  thus, That Timothy had no neede of miracles for the good of his soule.
  When I consider with my selfe, that God doth not now do so many miracles in his
  Church as hee was woont, it maketh me much to reioyce.Miracles why ordained and not now in vse. For miracles
  being ordained for the confirmation of our Faith, since God doth no longer
  worke by them, it seemeth that our Faith hath now taken too deepe rooting to
  bee remooued. And though sinne doe much abound, and men are much subiect vnto
  vice, yet ought it to bee a great comfort to the faithfull, that God doth not
  vse miracles any more for the strengthening of the Gospell.
               
                  Man liueth not by Bread alone. Irenaeus hath noted,
  that the Deuill in stead of sifting into our Sauiour to know truely what hee
  was, remained more blind, and more astonished than before. For hee, demaunding
  of our Sauiour Christ, whether he were God, or no? Our Sauiour acknowledged
  himselfe to be a man,  saying, Non in solo pane, viuit
  homo, Man shall not liue by bread alone.
               
               
                  Gods friendship to be preferred before the
 greatest plenty.
                  Not by Bread alone, &amp;c. S.
  Chrysostom treating touching the care &amp; prouision that ought to
  bee had of things necessarie for this life, sayth, That it is not so
  conuenient a meanes to seeke after the aboundance of things, as to haue God to
  our friend; wherein he recommendeth vnto vs the wonderfull care of Gods diuine
  prouidence for our good, howbeit by the world, ill vnderstood, &amp; worse
  executed. Whereas indeed wee should consider with our selues, That the end of
  our sweates and our labours, being to enioy some sweetnesse and content in this
  life, they inioy it most, and most safely, who inioy least of the pleasures of
  this life. For they that abound in Riches,The more wealth
 the more woe. abound in Cares, and Wealth is the mother of Woe. The
  Princes of this world, and your great powerfull men, haue more gold than
  gylding in their beds, but yet they haue no golden sleepes; their braines haue
  too much Quicke-siluer in them to settle to any rest. They haue their fat
  Capons and their daintie Pheasants set before them in vessels of siluer, but
  they haue leaden stomackes, and haue no appetite to eate. Whereas your
  husbandman sleepes betweene furrow and furrow, and that soundly, hauing a clod
  of earth for his pillow, and fals as hungerly to a Pilchard, and a cloue of
  Garlicke, as if hee had all the choice dishes in the world: For, Non in
  solo pane viuit homo. The Childeren of Israell beeing thirtie yeares in
  the Wildernesse, God drew water for them out of the Rocke, and it seemed
  sweeter vnto them than Honey, that is, De petra melle saturauit eos.
  It is a great comfort to a man, to haue a God that is able to make vs to be
  better contented with hunger, than with all the dainties and curious fare that
  the world or sea can affoord. Esay pondring with himselfe, How richly
  &amp; how happily a man doth liue vnder the shadow of Gods wing, and his diuine
  protection, saith, It is aboue all Glorie. The Prophet there treateth
  of those great fauours which God shewed to his People; As that Piller which
  serued them in the night as a Torch, and was as a Tent pitcht about them in the
  day time; that priuiledge which he gaue them, that neither the grauell nor the
  sand should weare out their shooes, nor time, nor the bushes in the Deserts
  wast their cloathes: making this in the end (as it were) a burthen of his Song,
  Super omnem gloriam protectio. Great were all those glories which that
  People did enioy; but aboue all, was Gods blessed protection towards them. The
  rich and mightie men of this world enioy much in this life; but I had rather
  ô Lord, bee poore Sub tegmine alarum tuarum, Vnder the couering of
  thy wings; For Non in solo pane viuit homo, Man liueth not by,
  &amp;c.
               
            
            
               Sed in omni verbo quod procedit de ore Dei.
               
                  But by euerie word which proceedeth from out the mouth of
  God. Our Sauior Christ tooke this authoritie out of the eigth Chapter of
  Deutronomie. Those dainties wherewith God inriched the aire, the sea,
  and the earth, maintaine and sustaine man, and for this end God hath created
  them; but more especially is hee maintained and sustained by the Word of God;
  Verbo Domini Coeli firmati sunt, &amp; spiritu oris eius omnis virtus
  eorum. From the beginning of the world the Heauens were mooued with a most
  swift motion, &amp; their influences &amp; vertues are so effectuall &amp; so
  fresh, as if they had come but to day (as it were) out of Gods hands: nor is it
  to bee feared, that Heauen shall waxe old, or fall to decay, because Gods word
  doth vphold it. Is it much then, or seemeth it so strange a thing, that the
  same word should sustain man without bread? For to put life into man, no more
  was required than Gods breath, Spirauit in faciem eius spiraculum
  vitae: Therefore this, and lesse than this, will preserue his life. Yet
  doe I not pretend by this, to  persuade any man that wee
  should still haue recourse to miracles; though in cases of necessitie, where
  there is no other helpe or hope to bee looked for, it is lawfull to expect and
  desire them, and a kind of glorifying of God: Demand a signe of the Lord
  thy God, whither in the deepe below, or in the heigth aboue; It was the
  saying of Esay to King Ahab. But in ordinarie necessities we
  are to haue recourse to our labours, and the sweat of our owne browes, not
  expecting Manna to descend from Heauen, and to haue Quailes put into our
  mouthes: The Scripture euerie where condemning the sloathfull man, which folds
  one hand within another; Manus in manu, saith Salomon,
  aduising the Sluggard to goe and learne of the Ant, Vade piger ad
  formicam: setting this Lesson alwaies before our eyes, That God is neuer
  offended with vs for prouiding cloaths to our back, and meat for our
  bellies.
               
                  But by euerie word. With hunger thou maist fill thy
  selfe, with nakednesse thou maist cloath thy selfe, and euen with pouertie thou
  maist grow rich, That is, In omni verbo, By putting thy necessities
  into Gods hands: Lay it to his account, to relieue thee; for by euerie word of
  his mouth thou shalt remaine satisfied, and haue more than enough; howbeit to
  the world and to nature, the meanes seeme disagreeable and contrarie to that
  succour which thou desirest.God makes the Deuils practises
 the preseruatiues of his Seruants. The blind man that was borne blind
  he inlightned by durt, beeing a fitter meanes in mans iudgment, to marre, than
  mend the sight. Those afflictions which the Deuill vsed as meanes for to
  destroy and vndoe Iob, God vsed as meanes to inrich him, &amp; make
  him more happie than before. The selling of Ioseph, the enuie of his
  brethren, were those rounds that made him mount to that heigth whereunto hee
  came, Sicut tenebrae eius, ita &amp; lumen eius: With thee, ô
  Lord, the darkenesse is as noone day; thou canst as well illuminate with
  darkenesse as with light. All the Land of Aegypt was couered ouer with
  darkenesse, as with a mantle, Factae sunt tenebrae horribiles in vniuersa
  terra Aegypti: but where the children of Israell dwelt, there was light,
  not onely because God can free those places where his people were, from that
  thicke darknes that oppressed the Aegyptians; but also for that he can make
  when he listeth, that very darknesse serue as a light vnto them; Forsitan
  tenebrae conculcabunt me, &amp; non illuminatio mea in dilicijs meis, It
  were madnesse in me ô Lord, to thinke that in the following of my
  pleasures I can hide my selfe out of thy sight; for though I should hide my
  selfe in the thickest and most palpable darkenesse that can be immagined, thou
  wilt make of them bright beames of light, which shall discouer me vnto thee;
  Nox illuminatio mea, in dilicijs meis: The Hebrew hath it, Circum
  me; I shall bee seene as easily in the night, as at noone day. In
  Genesis, Iacob saith, Lauabit in vino stolam suam, He shall wash
  my garment in wine: It was his Prophecie on Iudas his fourth
  sonne, who was a Type and figure of our Sauiour Christ. But passing from the
  Type to the truth, hee saith, That comming into the world, he shall wash the
  Church, and those that are the Faithfull, with his bloud, Lauabit in vino
  stolam suam. And if any one shall aske me, How the Stole can remaine
  white, being washed in bloud, or in wine? Diodorus and Genadius,
  in Catena Lypomani, answer, That Gods power can doe this, working
  contrarie effects to common reason: As from death to draw life; from
  tribulation, comfort; and from shame, glorie. In tribulatione dilatasti
  mihi (saith Dauid) &amp; gloriamur in tribulatione: So
  may a garment or linnen robe bee white, that is washed in the wine of his
  bloud. Qui dat niuem, sicu
                        •
                     
  lanam, &amp; nebulam, sicut cinerem spargit; God can warme a man with
  snow, as with wooll, and make cold be vnto vs as a cloathing. From that fire of
  the Babilonian furnace, whereinto Nebucadnezar commanded the three
  children to be cast, Sidrac, Misac, &amp; Abednego, 
                   there issued forth a fresh winde, and a cooling breath,
  Quasi ventum, ror
                        •
                     
  flantem. God (saith Chrysostome) can take from fire it's burning,
  which is his proper effect, and make it to giue light, and to refresh his
  children, as with a dew.
            
            
               Mitte te deorsum, scriptum est enim Angelis suis,
  &amp;c.
               
                  Cast thy selfe downe, For it is written, He will giue his
  Angells charge ouer thee. The Deuill hauing now brought our Sauiour to the
  top of the Pinacle of the Temple, beeing confident to get the conquest of him,
  making vse of that place of Scripture: first, wishing him to throw himselfe
  downe, and to relie vpon Gods preseruing of him; for it is written, Angelis
  suis Deus, &amp;c. Saint Hierome, Saint Ambrose, Saint
  Bernard, and Saint Gregorie say, That the Deuill neuer
  desires to see any man climbe on high, vnlesse it bee for his greater
  destruction: For as he fell down like a thunder-bolt, so doth he desire to haue
  all men else to fall as he did, and that their sinnes may throw them headlong
  downe to Hell. Which is one especiall effect of his pride; according to that of
  Dauid, Dejecisti eos, dum eleuarentur; (or extollerentur, as
  Saint Austen readeth it.) Thou didst cast them downe, while they
  were lifted vp. Est aliquid humilitatis, &amp;c. There is somewhat in
  humilitie, which in a wonderfull manner lifteth vp the heart; and there is
  somewhat in pride, which casteth it downe. It is a miracle, that Pride and
  Humilitie should euer meet. Saint Bernard saith, That at the foot of
  the Crosse the Deuill did repeat the same lesson againe, Si Rex Israel
  est, descendat de Cruce, If thou be King of Israell, come downe from the
  Crosse; As though he had forgot the shame that Christ had put him to
  before.
               
                  Cast thy selfe. Thou canst do nothing without thy
  selfe, against thy selfe: thou must put to thy helping hand; Non s
                        •
                     luabit te, sine te, nec perdet te, sine te. Whence
  it is to bee noted, That hee not onely pretendeth the holiest that is, should
  cast himselfe headlong from the Tower of Good-workes, but he that is seated on
  the Pinacle of the Temple, and in the highest dignitie in the Church. It is a
  lamentable case, that the Prelate, the Priest, and the Preacher, should be put
  to this perill. Quis medebitur Incantatori, à Serpente percusso?
  Who shall heale the Inchanter that is wounded by the Serpent?
               
               
                  He hath giuen his Angels charge ouer thee. The main
  drift of the deuil, is, to flatter and sooth vs vp, that he may facilitate our
  fall; to sing sweetly vnto vs, to inchant vs like the Syren: Ossa eius
  sicut fistula aeris. Iob saith, That his bones (by which he vnderstands
  his strength) are Flutes, not of Reede, like those of Mida's, but of
  Brasse, which sound more sweetly. With these he vpholds his Empire, and sowes
  the World with Heresies, Moorismes, and Paganismes; and Hell, with damned
  Soules. They are Pipes that make strange consonancies with our inclinations,
  and worke more powerfull effects, than those tongues that are tipt with the
  eloquencies of all the Tullies, Demostheneses, and
  Quintilians in the world▪ Which is but an argument of the weaknes
  of their hands, when all their strength lies in their Tongues. Your weakest
  influences (say your Astrologers) insist vpon the Tongue. Woman (who is the
  embleme of weakenesse) hath her greatest force and strength in her tongue:
  Your Ruffians, and such as are swaggering fellows, haue more tongue than hands;
  but they that are truly valiant, haue more hand than tongue, they know not what
  the tongue meanes. The Roman Souldiers drew a Hand for their Deuice. In the
  Scripture the Hand signifieth Fortitude, Manus eius adhuc extenta est,
  so sayes Esay of God. The Deuill therefore beeing all Tongue, it
  followeth, that he must necessarily be a verie weake creature. Saint
  Peter calls him a Lyon, not because he deuoureth, but because he
  roares: So that  all our victorie consists in freeing our
  selues from his tongue.
                     Iob 40. And it may be
  Iob alluded hereunto, when he speaketh of the Deuill in the metaphor
  of a Whale, Wilt thou bind his tongue with a cord? For the Deuill
  hauing all his strength in his tongue, see how that fish when the harping Irons
  hath caught hold on him, struggles on the sand, and beats himselfe vpon the
  beach, but all in vaine, to get loose, and at last swels &amp; bursts with
  anger; so is it with the Deuill, when we haue tied a knot vpon his tongue.
               
                  His Angells. To those whom God loueth, and such as are
  his children, Saint Cyprian saith, That God hath giuen order to his
  Angells, to gard and protect them; if a tyle should fal towards them, to strike
  it aside; if stumble, to take hold on them that they should not fall: How then
  could a person so holy, so beloued of God, be affraid? God did his People a
  great fauour in giuing them an Angel to be their Guide. Precedet te Angelus
  meus, sending an Angell to Daniel to feed him; to
  Tobias, to accompanie him in his journey; to Samaria, when
  Zenacharib so streightly besieged it, one Angell slaying so many
  thousands of braue valiant Souldiers. But greater is that fauour which he
  promiseth here to the Iust, Angelis suis Deus mandauit de te. The
  Lyons garded Daniel in Babylon; the Whale, Ionas; the Arke of
  Bulrushes, Moses: In omnibus vijs tuis, In all thy ways, be it in the
  aire, in the earth, or in the sea, Gods Angels will so gard thee, that thou
  shalt not dash thy foot against a stone. Many Emperours and Kings haue
  scattered Gold on the ground, through which they haue gone; many haue beene
  drawne in their Chariots by Lyons and Elephants; but farre more pretious are
  the hands of Angells; and hee that hath them to helpe him, need not to touch
  theground with his feet.
               
                  Scriptum est enim, Angelis suis.
                  The
 Deuill was euer a false interpreter of the Scripture▪
                   The first
  victorie that the Deuill got in the world, was by interpreting in a sinister
  sence, those words of God which he had deliuered to our first Parents: and this
  course doth hee continue here with our Sauiour; and the same doth his followers
  the Hereticks obserue to this day. Saint Peter calls them, vnlearned,
  and wauering, and saith of them, That they depraue and peruert the Scripture,
  to their owne ruine and destruction. Saint Cyril handleth this point
  verie elegantly, in one of his Epistles: And Origen saith, That as the
  children of Corah did put strange fire vpon the Alter; so your
  Hereticks by altering the Scripture, put strange fire to the Alter of Truth.
  Saint Chrysostome, That they immitate the Deuill, by citing Scripture
  falsely, as the Deuill did in this temptation, seeking (as it were) by a cleere
  and manifest truth, to persuade our Sauiour to entertaine a notorious lie, and
  to admit of a monstrous follie; securing him, that his person should be
  protected by Angells, from any ensuing harme, if hee would but throw himselfe
  downe from the Pinacle of the Temple. I terme it follie; for, as Man, hee had
  no reason to doe any such rash and inconsiderate action; and, as God, hee had
  no neede to play the Tumbler, and to flie in the aire.
            
            
               Haec omnia tibi dabo.
               
                  All these things wil I giue thee. Saint
  Ambrose saith, That in these three temptations the Deuill had laid
  three ginnes, wherewith hee vseth to intrap man in those three Ages of his, to
  wit, his childhood, his manhood, and his elder age. The disorder of children
  consists in eating; they are ordinarily crauing,The Deuill
 hath 3. Ginns to intrap man, sutableto his three Ages. stil crying out
  for more meat, little young Gluttons, and such syllie fooles, as to haue an
  Apple, they will part with a piece of Gold. That of our youthfuller yeres, when
  wee begin to write man, is to runne headlong into all desperate and
  vndiscreete  actions. For the liuelihood of youth, hath
  euer hetherto beene impatient, humerous, and braine-sicke. That of old age, is
  all couetousnesse, storing vp for a deere yeare, and filling his Wallets then
  fullest, when his iourny is shortest; resembling herein those riuers, which the
  neerer they come to the Sea, which is their end, so much the more water they
  sucke and draw vnto them. Some may thinke that the Deuill playd the foole, in
  offering all to him that despised all. For Christ contemned the wealth and
  glorie of this World.Ambition such a temptation as few are
 able to withstand. For to offer bread to the Hungerie, honour to the
  Ambitious, and riches to the Couetous, the Deuil might haue had some good
  ground to worke vpon; But that he should offer al to him that scorned all hee
  could offer, this was great weakenesse in him: yet (deerely beloued) doe not
  you reckon this so slight a temptation, and so poore an onset, as you would
  make it. For all Hell hath not a more powerfull peece of Ordnance to batter our
  brests withall, than this, it is the only murdring peece that hee hath, and
  what man is able to resist it? Quis est hic, &amp; la
                        •
                     danimus eum, Show me the man, that I may commend
  him. Thou shalt not find one amongst the Princes of the people, nor
  amongst the Ministers of Kings, nor amongst the seats of Iustice, nor amidst
  the honestie of Married-folkes, nor the modestie of Maidens, no, nor in the
  Monasteries of your Nunnes, nor the Cells of your Hermits in the Wildernesse.
  In old time, all the States of the the world, were in competition about the
  electing of an Emperor among the Gods. The Priests, chose Appollo for
  his Wisedome; the Souldiers, Mars for his Valour; the Merchants,
  Mercurie, for his negociating; the Phisitions, Aesculapius,
  for the eminencie of his Cures. But when it was brought to that passe that
  they must settle vpon some one to bee Emperour, by a ioynt consent they all
  made choice of Iupiter, because hee was the God that came downe into
  the World in a showre of Gold.
               
                  All these things will I giue thee. The Deuill, doth not
  here offer that which he is able to giue: But is rather so poore, That of all
  those Kingdomes, whereof he makes so large a profer, he hath not so much as one
  poore spike-hole in a wall. The richnesse of a Prince is to be seene in his
  Ward-robe and Richnesse of his prouision: There comes in before him a hundred
  Mules, Sumpter-Clothes on their backes, imbrodered with silke, siluer, and
  gold, with their goriets of massie-plate, &amp;c. Iob painting foorth
  the Deuils Ward-robe, sayth, Ante faciem
  
                        〈◊〉
                      praecedat egestas, (i.)
  Want shall goe before his face. All his Ward-robe, is couered ouer
  with pouertie and want; all his treasures, are dissembled wares, counterfait
  stuffe. Lift vp his Sumpter-clothes, open his Trunckes, and you shall finde
  nothing but stones, and apples, making show of the one to our Sauiour, of the
  other to Eue. So that hee is so poore, that hee hath not so much as
  one farthing of all those immense treasures which hee offers; But he offereth
  that which he would giue, if hee were (as he is not) Lord of all the World.
  Such was the perplexitie and anxietie of minde, that hee had, to know who was
  Christ our Sauiour, that if all the Kingdomes of the earth had beene his, hee
  would giue them all to see him humbled at his feet. Hee offers thee but little,
  because he makes little reckoning of thee; for thou art so base minded, that
  thou wilt sell thy selfe vnto him at an easie rate.
               But how could the Deuil hope, with these onely seeming and
  apparent goods to worke so great a Conquest on so valiant a Brest? I answer,
  That it is the Deuils policie, to bait our Wils and Affections with the
  apprehension of imaginarie goods, rather than with the inioying of true and
  reall goods indeed. Nay, the glories of the World, once inioy'd, causeth a kind
  of surfet and loathing, which  is often an occasion of our
  growing out of loue with them. 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , vanitatum, &amp; omnia vanitas. Where the wise man did not
  tearme all things vaine,Imaginarie things worke more vpon
 man than reall. Why. as that the trees should not yeeld vs their
  fruites, the earth her food and riches, or that the Sunne should not shine. But
  because wee setting our whole delight vpon them, wee make them prooue vaine
  vnto vs. A clock is accounted a vaine thing when it strikes not true, but
  miscounts it's houres. The harmonie of this World is like a clocke, if a man
  imploy it wholly in his pleasures, it makes him become vaine. But
  Salomon spake not a word of these things, till hee had made triall of
  them. When the Prodigall went out of his Fathers house, Paradises of delights
  were presented vnto him, but when he was gone far from him, all was hunger,
  nakednesse, &amp; miserie. This punishment inflicted vpon him, made him open
  his eies and see his errour. Amnon, enamoured of Th
                        •
                     m
                        •
                     r, was readie to dye for her loue, it seeming vnto him, that
  his life did consist in the inioying of her; nay hee counted it his heauen: But
  hee had no sooner had his pleasure of her, but he kicked her out of doores, and
  could not indure the sight of her. The possessing of riches, is not of it selfe
  either good or bad; onely the good vse of them, makes them good, the bad, bad.
  And therefore beeing desired by vs, Saint Paul stileth them,
  temptation, and Sathans snare, Qui volunt diuites fieri, in
                        •
                     idunt in tentationem, &amp; in laqueum
  Diaboli, (i.) They that will bee rich fall into Temptation: and into
  the snare of the Deuill. So that your imaginarie goods, worke more vpon
  vs, and with more aduantage, than those which wee inioy and possesse. And the
  reason is, for that the Deuill doth represent more glorie to the imagination,
  in such an office, such a dignitie, such riches, such beautie, and such
  delights, than is true, Facinatio enim nugacitatis obscurat bona, &amp;
  inconstantia concupiscentiae, transuertit sensum. His cunning witch-craft
  doth peruert the vnderstanding, and makes vs take Ill, for Good. This is that
  which our Sauiour Christ called, Crapulam &amp; ebrietatem saeculi, A
  kind of drunkennes, wherwith the men of this World are ouertaken, Et
  inconstantiam concupiscentiae. And the Greeke text vseth the word
  Funda; For as that goes alwayes round, so doth concupiscence, euerie
  moment altering our desires. There are some kind of pictures, which if you
  looke one way vpon them seeme faire and beautifull, if another way, foule and
  ougly, and full of horror. Such doth the Deuill set before thee; Thou must haue
  therefore an eye to the one as to the other, looke as wel what is to come, as
  what is present before thee, least the Deuill chance to deceiue thee.
            
            
               Si cadens adoraueris me.
               
                  If thou wilt fall downe and worship me. How
  earnest,Two kindes of temptation. and how
  importunate is the Deuill? Saint Gregorie saith, That there are two
  kinds of temptation; one sudden, as that of Lucifer, who as soone as
  he saw the Sun of Grace begin to rise, presently opposed himselfe against him,
  sweeping away with him a third part of the Stars, as you may read in the
  Reuelation. And as that of Dauid in the case of
  Bershabe: and as that of Peter, when he was suddenly set vpon
  by the Maid in Caiphas house. The other taking more leisure, as that
  of Iudas, whom the Deuil went by little and little importuning by his
  suggestions; as an enemie that ouercomes by lengthening out the warre; or as a
  Physition cures a disease, by prescribing a long and tedious dyet; or as a
  Moath imperceptibly mars the cloath;The Deuill alwayes as
 busie as a flie in haruest. and the Worme destroyes the wood. The
  Hebrewes call the Deuill Belzebub, which is as much to say as Deus
  Muscarum, The God of Flies. Now the World hath not a more busie or
  troublesome creature than your Flies and Gnats in Autumne, and in the time of
  Haruest: nor Man a more busie enemie than the Deuill, in the 
   Autumne and Haruest of our Soules, when we should labour
  most for Heauen, and prouide for a deere yeare. Your Flie amongst the
  Aegyptians was a symbole of importuning; and therefore it is said by way of
  a
                     •
                  age, The wickednesse of the
  Flie. There are sinnes, which like the Cow we chew the cud vpon, we
  ruminate vpon them, and our thoughts are neuer off from them. Iob did
  point out vnto vs these two kinds of temptations; the one, in the stone, that
  being rent from the top of an high hill, falls suddenly down, carrying away
  before it all that stands in it's way, it beeing impossible to preuent
  conueniently the danger thereof; Lapis transfertur de loco suo. The
  other, in the water, which beeing so soft as it is, yet by little and little
  hollowes the hardest stone; Homine
                        •
                      ergo similiter perdes, tota die impugnans tribulauit me.
  Onely Importunitie is the shrewdest temptation. Sampson yeelded vnto
  Dalila, tyred out with her re-iterated importunings: And there are a
  thousand Sampsons in these dayes, which doe not yeeld themselues so
  much to sinne by the batterie of temptation, as by importunate treaties.
            
            
               Si cadens adoraueris me.
               
                  If falling downe thou worship me. This was a strange
  kind of impudencie in the Deuill: but he no sooner saw his maske taken away,
  and that our Sauiour had discouered him and his trickes, but he hid his head
  for shame.
            
            
               Vade retro, Sathana.
               
                  Goe behind me, Sathan. Saint Hierome saith,
  That with this verie word, our Sauiour Christ tumbled him headlong downe to
  the bottomlesse pit of Hell; whereinto he entred howling, and making such a
  hideous noyse and lamentable out-crie, that hee strooke a great feare into all
  those infernall Spirits; The strong one was bound, and trodden in pieces
  with the foot of the Lord. Beda hath almost the verie same words. This
  imprisonment of his was enlarged afterwards by Christs death: according to that
  of the Apocalyps, He bound him for a thousand yeares. In a word, He
  was so ashamed, and so out of countenance with this answer of our Sauiours,
  that for many days he did not so much as once offer to peepe out of Hel.
  Where Pride is,
                  
                     Prou. 11. 
                  there
  will bee Reproch, so saith Salomon. That place of
  Deutronomie, whence our Sauior tooke this authoritie, doth not say,
  Adorabis, Thou shalt adore, but Time
                        •
                     is, Thou shalt feare; as if the truest way to
  worship God, were to feare him. The Scripture attributes two names vnto Christ;
  the one of Spouse; the other of Lord:True Loue neuer
 without feare. in the one he shewes his loue; in the other, the feare
  which is due vnto him: in the one, the securitie wherewith wee may come vnto
  him, and offer him our Petitions; in the other, the respect and reuerence which
  we owe to so great a Maiestie. They are things that are so cimented and
  ioynted together, that he affectionatly loues, who humbly fears. But I feare I
  haue bn too long, and therefore I will here make an end.

               I Haue treated of this Theame at large, in fiue seueral Chapters
vpon the Parables:The cōming of Christ to Iudgement.
But the Sea is neuer emptied by those waters which the Riuers take from it; nor
those diuine Mysteries lessened by those many Bookes that are written thereof;
especially by a Sea of judgement, where your shallow wits are vsually
drowned.
            Concerning this Article, which is so notorious, there is not a
Prophet, an Euangelist, a Sybil, nor any of the holy Fathers, which do not make
confession thereof; yea, the verie Angells said vnto the Disciples, This
Iesus who was taken from you, shall So come; where this particle
[Sic] So, doth not so much exprimere modum, as
similitudinem, not the true manner of his comming, but after what
likenesse he shall come. Now doth he sit at the right hand of his Father, and
shall possesse that Throne till that he shall come to iudge the world, and make
his enemies his footstoole. According to that of Dauid, Sit at my right
hand Vntill I make thy enemies thy footstoole; a sentence which was
repeated afterwards by S. Paul, to the Hebrews. Not that the sitting
at the right hand of his father shal euer haue any end, (for as Saint
Chrysostome and Gregorie Nazianzen hath noted it, the word
Vntill doth not point at any set time) but the mutation of the place
which our Sauiour Christ is to make for that terme of time that the Iudgement
shall last, himselfe comming thither in person to set all things in order;
                  Act. 
                  
                     •
                  . 
               Vsque in diem restitutionis omnium, so saith
Saint Luke: And by reason of the notoriousnesse thereof, the
Euangelist doth not say, that hee shall come, but supposeth (as it were) his
present comming, with a Cum venerit, &amp;c.
            
            
               The Sonne of Man. Iudiciarie power, or this Potestas
judiciaria (as the Schoole-men call it) is proper to all the Trinitie, but
is here attributed to the Sonne, as  Wisedome is likewise
attributed vnto him, which is the soule of the Iudge. So that the Sonne (as he
is God) is the eternall Iudge, and the Lord vniuersall, to whom the Father hath
communicated this dominion by an eternall generation. Generando non
largiendo, saith Saint Ambrose. But as he is man, the blessed
Trinitie gaue him this power in tempore, by vniting him to our nature;
Hee gaue him power to doe judgement: And Saint Iohn giues the
reason thereof, Because he is the Sonne of Man; it beeing held fit
that Man should be saued by Man; Gods mercie gaining thereby glorie; and Mans
meannesse, authoritie. And therefore it was thought fit, that Man should be
iudged by Man; Gods justice remaining thereby iustified; and Mans Cause
secured: For, What greater securitie can man haue, than that hee should bee
Mans Iudge, who gaue his life for Man, shedding his bloud on the Crosse for
Mans saluation? So doth Saint Austen expound that place alledged by
Saint Iohn, Dedit ei judicium facere, quia filius hominis est.
            
            On the one side here is matter of hope &amp; comfort; on the
other, of feare and trembling:No smal comfort that Christ
  shal be our Iudge. Who will not hope for pittie from a man, and such a
man that is my brother, my aduocate, my friend, who to make me rich, had made
himselfe poore? &amp;c. But who can hope for any comfort from that man that was
iudged, sentenced, and condemned vniustly by man vnto death? Who can hope for
any good from that man whose loue man repaid with dis-loue, and whose life,
with death? These Yrons are too hard for the stomacke of man to digest, it had
need of some Ostriches helpe. I will not destroy Ephraim, because I am God,
and not Man: God is woont to requite bad with good, discourtesies with
benefits; &amp; his loue commonly encreaseth when mans diminisheth, but mans
brest is somewhat streighter laced.Againe, no small
  terrour. In a word, This his beeing Man is a matter of feare, and by how
much the more was Mans obligation, by so much the more shall the son of mans
vengeance bee: For the pretious bloud of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, and his
cruell, yet blessed wounds, are the Sanctuarie of our hopes, especially to
those that trust in him, and lay hold on him by Faith: but for the vnthankefull
sinner, they shall be matter of cowardise, and of terrour; and to our Sauiour
Christ minister occasion of greater punishment, and a more rigorous reuenge.
Esay introduceth the Angels questioning our Sauior at his entrance
into Heauen, Quare rubrum est vestimentum tuum sicut calcantium in
torculari? Why are thy garments, ô Lord, like vnto those that tread the
Wine-presse? You say wel; for I haue troden, like the grapes, my enemies
vnder foot, and my garments are sprinkled and stained with their bloud. O Lord,
this bloudie spoyle would well haue beseemed thee on earth; But what doost thou
make with it here in Heauen? Dies vltionis in corde meo; The day will
come when I shall bee reuenged at full of those ill requited benefits which I
bestowed on my People; and all that patience which I then s
                  •
               ewed, shall be turned into wrath and
endlesse anger. Saint Chrysostome interpreting that place of Saint
Mathew, Sanguis eius super nos, Let his bloud be vpon vs and our
children; saith thus, The time shall come, that the bloud that might haue
giuen you life, shall occasion your death; it shall be vnto you worse than that
Fire of Babylon, which the King intended for death, though in the end it
turned to life: The bloud of Christ was intended for life, but it shall end in
death. Hosea saith, V
                     •
                  
eis, cum recesser
                     •
                   ab eis:
Another Translation hath it, Caro mea ab eis. When the Sonne of mans
mercie was come to that heigth, as mans thought could not set it higher; to
wit, That God in mans fauour should take mans flesh vpon him; woe vnto those
men who were vnmindfull of so great a blessing: for this extraordinarie
courtesie of his being so vnthankfully entertained, and so ill requited, shall
be their condemnation, for whose saluation it was intended. Cornua eius
sicut Rinocerotis, 
                saith Deutronomie: The
Vnicorne is the mildest &amp; the patientest beast that is, and it is long ere
he will be prouoked to anger; but if he once grow hot and angrie, there is no
creature more fierce and furious than he is: Ex tarditate, ferocior,
as Pierius vseth it, by way of adage.
            Saint Austen collecteth hence another conuenience: Euerie
iudgement (saith he) requireth two especiall and important things:
            The one, That the Iudge feare not the face of the Mightie.
            The other, That he hide not his face from him that is brought
before him.Two properties of a Iudge.
            
            For the first, The Scripture hath it euerie where, Regard not
the countenance of the Mightie. For the second, Iob pondering the
perdition of a certain Prouince, saith, That the Iudges thereof would not
suffer themselues to be seen;
                  Iob. 9. v.
  24. 
               The earth is giuen into the hands of the Wicked; he couereth the
faces of the Iudges. And therefore God will not be seene by the damned;
for by their verie seeing him, they should be freed from their punishment: and
therefore in this respect it was fit that Christ should come to iudge the world
as Man.
            
               In Maiestate sua, In his Maiestie. The Interlinearie hath
it, In Diuinitate; Saint Chrysostome, In Gloria; Saint
Luke, In Maiestate sua, in Patris, &amp; sanctorum Angelorum.
               
                  Luke 9. v. 26. Where it is noted by Saint
Ambrose, That his Maiestie was greater than that of his father;
Quia Patri inferior, videri non poterat: For in what place soeuer the
Father should be, it could not bee presumed that hee should be lesse than his
Son; but of his Son it might perhaps haue bin presumed otherwise: into which
errour Arrius did afterwards fall.
            
               In Maiestate sua, &amp;c. Our words here want weight, and
our weake apprehension, matter and forme worthie so great a Maiestie. In a
Prince, a Lord, and in a Iudge, is necessarily required a kind of presence and
authoritie beyond other ordinarie men. Esay reporteth of his People,
That seeing a man of a goodly presence, and well clad, they said vnto him,
Thou hast rayment, be our Prince. Nor is this onely necessarie, but
that his greatnesse and his Maiestie bee euerie way answerable to the
largenesse of his Commission and Iurisdiction. And therefore our Sauiour Christ
being then to shew himselfe a King of Kings, and a Lord of Lords, and an
vniuersall Iudge ouer all persons, and ouer all causes since the first
beginning of the world, to the end thereof, his Maiestie must needs be
incomparable.
            First, In respect of his person,The maiestie of
  Christ at his comming to iudgemēt. whose splendor and brightnesse shall
eclipse and darken all the lights of the World. At this his comming, his glorie
at the first (I mean of his soule) was reserued and hid, so that therein they
might not see the fearefulnesse of their punishment: but in his comming to
Iudgement the light of his bodie shall be so shining, and so extreamely bright,
that the Sunne in comparison of it shall seeme as a candle. Saint
Ambrose calleth the Sunne, the Grace of Nature, the Ioy of the World,
the Prince of the Planets, the bright Lanterne of the World, the Fountaine of
Life, the Image of God, whom for it's beautie so many Nations adored as a God:
But in that day, the Sunne, and the Moon it's Vicegerent, whom they call the
Queene of Heauen, shall be like vnto those lights of the Sheepheards, which are
hardly to be discerned afarre off. Saint Iohn made in his
Apocalyps a description of this Maiestie and beautie; hee saw the
Heauen opened, and that a Horseman came forth, riding on a white Horse; from
his eyes flamed forth two Torches of fire; from his mouth issued a two edged
Sword; in his hand he had a Rod of Yron; on his head many Crowns; and on his
thigh a Letter, which beeing read spake thus, The King of Kings, and Lord
of Lords: Great Armies of Horsemen did attend him, all on white Horses.
This is a figure and Type of our Sauiour Christs comming to Iudgement. The
white horse  is his most holy and vnspotted Humanitie.
Those flaming Torches of his eyes betoken, That all things both great and small
shal be laid open to his sight, there shall not be any sinne so secret, nor any
fault so buried vnder ground, which shall not appeare at that generall Triall;
that beeing then to be verified of euery Sinner, which God said to
Dauid touching his murder and adulterie; Thou hast done it
secretly, but I will doe it in the sight of the Sunne. The two edged Sword
signifies the finenesse and sharpenesse of the Iudges proceeding, and that he
is able to cut in sunder the marrow and bones of a Sinner; and like a Razor
meet with the least haire of euill that shall shew it selfe. His Rod of Yron
shewes the firmenesse and constancie of his Iudgment, which shall not, like
those white Wands which the Iudges bare before, be wrested this way and that
way at pleasure. Those many Diadems on his head, intimate those Crownes that he
shall clap on the heads of the Righteous, and those that haue done well. That
glorious Letter of Rex Regum, because he shal there shew himselfe to
be King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords, many Kings of the earth shall haue their
knees smitten like Balthazars, and their hearts throb within them,
when they stand before his presence expecting their fearefull doome. Lastly,
hee shall come accompanied with many Horsemen on white Horses, to shew vnto vs,
that hee shall bee waited on by all the Court of Heauen. Salomon
saith, Tria sunt quae bene gradiuntur, quartum quod foelicitèr
incedit; Three creatures haue a goodly kind of gate, the Sheepe, the Lyon, and
the Cocke; but a King, whom none can resist, carries more state with him
than them all. Saint Gregorie typifieth this prouerbe to our Sauiour
Christ, who did gallantly beare himselfe in foure of his most famous
mysteries.
            First, In that of his Redemption, represented in the sheep which
is made readie for the Sacrifice.
            Secondly, In his Resurrection, figured in the Lyon, Vicit Leo
de Tribu Iuda. Whereunto Saint Paul doth attribute our
justification, Resurrexit propter justificationem nostram.
            
            Thirdly, In his preaching of the Gospell, fitly expressed in the
Cocke, who with his crowing and clapping of his wings, awakeneth those that are
asleepe in sinne.
            But his comming to judgement, which is deciphered vnto vs in his
beeing a King, doth farre exceed all the rest: For many were not bettered by
his Death, nor his Resurrection, nor his Doctrine, (though these were most
pretious Treasures proffered to Mankind) because that Age wherein Christ came
was an Age of contradiction; but in this his comming to judgement that
prophecie of Zacharie shall be fulfilled,
                  Zach. 14. 
               And there shall bee one Lord ouer
all the earth, and his name shall be one. Till then, this King shall goe
by little and little, ouercomming and subduing his enemies; but when he shall
come in his glorie, then shall wee see a most stately triumph, and a quiet and
peaceable possession: and that Stone which Daniel saw loosed and
vnfastned from the Mountaine, shall then cease to pound and beat into pouder
all the Empires and Seigniories of the earth; Thou shal
                     •
                   breake them like a Potters
Vessell. In a word, in this world, while wee liue heere, God is not
absolutely ob
                  •
               yed, nor serued by vs
as he should bee, no, not of the Iust themselues, and those that are the Elect
children of God. So doth Saint Austen declare that place of the
Canticles, Exui me tunica mea, quomodo indu
                     •
                   illa? Laui pedes meos, quomodo inquinabo illos? I haue put off my
coat, How shall I put it on? I haue washed my feet, How shall I defile
them? How is this to be borne withall, how is this to be suffered (saith
this sacred Doctor) that the Spouse should vse this libertie with her best
Beloued? Whereunto he answereth, That the Iust do  not
denie vnto God his entrance into the house of their Soules; but the Spouse doth
there discouer the resistance which the Soule makes in the behalfe of the
Sences, at that time when as God calls her vnto him. But in the day of
Iudgement the Soule shall be no more mis-led by the Sences, but shall
perfectly become subiect to the will of God; so that the Sonne of God shall
appeare then in greater power and Maiestie than euer hee did before. But for to
treat of the Maiestie of the Father, the greatest and deepest thoughts of Man
is but as a Thimble, they are not able to conceiue, much lesse to containe the
least part thereof. Daniel saith, seeking to expresse the greatnesse
of his glorie, and the mightinesse of his power, Mille millia ministrabant
ei, &amp; decies centena millium assist
                     ••
                  ant ei; The Pages that attend his person must bee numbred by
thousands, and the Courtiers that assist in his presence, by ten thousands of
thousands: Arithmeticke wants figures to set downe these numberlesse numbers.
Esay saw him in a Throne of Maiestie and of glorie, Plena erat
domus Maiestate eius; but his feet and his head couered with the wings of
Seraphins: Giuing vs thereby to vnderstand, That these our corporall eyes may
haue a glimpse of the Maiestie of his Throne, but not of his person.
            Lastly, That Maiestie of his Court, which consists of so many
Angelicall Hierarchies, What tongue! what tongue can paint out that vnto thee,
which is beyond the proportion of thought? One Angell alone hath strucke with
the feare of death the valiantest &amp; the holiest men that euer were; what
would they then doe when they are a joynt and vnited Bodie? Saint
Chrysostome saith, That greater is the power of one Angell, than of
all the men in the world, if all their force and strength were molten together,
and molded into one entire masse. At Christs birth, certaine Squadrons of
Angells came round about him, saluting him with that heauenly Song of,
Gloria in excelsis: but now they shall come trouping all together,
and some shall more particularly bewaile with great bitternesse, those
miseries that shall befall the World, and those that liued therein; according
to that of Esay, The Angels of Peace shall weepe bitterly.
               
                  Esay 33.
            
            The Euangelist doth not here in this place vnderstand the euill
Angels, though they shall come likewise vpon this Theatre, as well to bee
iudged themselues, [Nescitis quia Angelos judicabimus] as to serue as
Atturneys for to open the Sinners crimes and offences, and as Hangmen, to
execute the Iudges Sentence. In this life God oftentimes makes the good Angels
to bee the Executioners of his wrath, as in Sodome, and in the first borne of
Aegypt, in ouerthrowing the Chariots of Pharaoh, in Zenacharib,
Heliodorus, and Herod; but his ordinarie kind of punishment is by
euill Angells, Immissiones per Angelos malos; by which hee
vnderstandeth those fearefull Plagues of Aegypt, as Flies, Frogges,
Grashoppers, Waspes, Homets, thicke Clouds, Darkenesse that might bee felt,
their Flockes and Heards of Cattell killed with Haile stones, Visions, idle
Dreames, and Phantasies, and the like, [Sad shapes appeared vnto them, and
Monsters did affright them;] whereby they that were liuing lookt as if
they had beene dead, Animae deficiebant traductione; These did the
Deuill carrie away bound hand and foot, to bee cast into vtter darkenesse: And
when God shall set these Catchpoles to arrest the Wicked, What will become of
them? What will they doe?
            With this Maiestie and greatnesse shall that supreame Iudge come,
Vpon the Seat of his Maiestie; whither it be a Throne of Clouds,
                  Eccle. 24. Exod. 1
                     •
                  . Psal. 70. Psal. 98. according
to that of Ecclesiasticus, Thronus eius in columna Nubis; and that of
Exodus, Veniam in caligine Nubis; or whither it be a Throne of
Cherubins, according to that of Dauid, Qui sedes super Cherubim; or
whither of the Iust, (as Origen would haue it;) sure I 
 am, that hee shall come with that graue and austere
countenance, and with that awfull and fearefull looke, that Malachy
might verie well say, Who shall endure to looke vpon him?
            
            
               Congregabuntur ante eum omnes Gentes.
               
                  All Nations shall be gathered before him. It is as
  true, as it is fearefull, That all men shall meet together in one,All shall appeare in iudgement. all that did enioy the
  light of this world; for so many Kindreds, nay, thousands of Ages, whither they
  perished in the element of Fire, and so turned to ashes; or whither they were
  deuoured by the Fowles of the aire, or the Beasts of the field; or whither they
  became the food of fishes in the Sea; or whither that their bodies remaine in
  their graues; or whither like rubbish they lie buried vnder ruinous buildings;
  or howsoeuer they haue passed through diuers and sundrie transmutations; yet
  notwithstanding in the end all shall come and present themselues vpon this
  publique Stage; all those Nations that are so differing in their manners and
  behauiour, in their Idiomes &amp; their Languages, in their Rights and
  Ceremonies, in their Laws and their Customes, whither remaining in the maine
  Continent, or in the Islands enuironed with the Sea: And what wonder can be
  greater, or what sight so strange, as to see all the men in the world to
  appeare body and soule, before his diuine Maiestie, at the voyce of an Angell,
  when he shall trumpet forth this short summons vnto them, Surgite mortui,
  &amp;c. But two other wonders more fearefull than this (I feare me) will
  be seene: The one, That all mens hearts shall be opened, &amp; euerie man both
  inwardly and outwardly shall appeare so plaine and so cleere to our sight, that
  there shall not be any thought, though neuer so closely hid, nor any fault,
  though neuer so deepely buried, that shall not bee made open and manifest:
  According to that of Saint Paul to the Corinthians, Omnes
  manifestari oportet ante Tribunal Christi,
                  2.
 Cor. 5.10. 
                  We must all bee manifested before the Iudgement
  Seat of Christ. Whereupon Saint Theodoret weighing the word
  Manifestari, which in the originall is the same with Perlucidos
  esse, Transparent, and cleere as Chrystall; wherein those blacke spots and
  
                     •
                  oule staines that are in our
  Soules, will appeare the more vgly and loathsome, ô! How strange a
  spectacle will this be? How sole and singular in the world? ô! what a
  great feare will it strike into vs, not onely in regard of the innumerable
  number of such various and vncouth things, things heretofore neuer presumed, or
  once thought vpon; but also in respect of the heart of man, which being so
  inscrutable a thing, and for so many yeares of mans life, past searching out,
  and not to bee discouered and set forth in it's true life and colours; that
  this heart, I say, of Man shall in an instant bee laid so open, that all maskes
  shall be vnpin'd, all disguises taken off, whose hollownesse and hypocrisie
  shall now appeare to God and the World. Immagine that God should shew this
  miracle in open Court, and that the hearts of all should lie open to the eyes
  of all, (as he did discouer to Ezechiel euerie forme of creeping
  things,
                     Ezech.
                     
                        •
                     . and abhominable Beasts,
  and all the Idolls of the House of Israell portrayed vpon the wall of the
  Temple) How ashamed will the verie best of Gods children bee of their actions,
  but much more the wicked, to see their sinnes laid open to others view, and
  their owne confusion? Nor shall these our sinnes bee conspicuous onely to
  others, but euerie offendor shall see and plainely perceiue his owne particular
  sinnes: For there is no man that fully knowes his owne sinnes while hee
  liue
                     •
                   here in this world. And so
  doth Saint Basil interpret that place of the Psalmist, Arguam te,
  &amp; statuam contra te faciem tuam; Euerie man shall then behold
  himselfe as in a glasse. In a word, This day will be the summing vp of all
  those o
                     ••
                   
                  
  former dayes, wherein, as in a beadroll, wee shall read all the loose actions
  of our life, all our idle words, all our euill workes, all our lewd thoughts,
  or whatsoeuer else of ill that our hearts haue conceiued, or our hands
  wrought. So doth a graue Author expound that place of Dauid, Dies
  formabuntur, &amp; nemo in eis, In that day shall all dayes be formed and
  perfected, for then shall they bee cleerely knowne. Et nemo in
  eis; This is a short and cutted kind of speech, (idest) There
  shall not bee any thing in all the world which shall not bee knowne in that
  day.
               The other wonder shall be, That all this businesse shall bee
  dispatcht in a moment; In ictu oculi, saith Saint Paul, In the
  twinckling of an eye. The Greeke Text in stead of a moment, renders it
  Atomo, which is the least thing in nature: Concluding this point with
  that saying of Theophilact, Haec est res omnium mirabilissima, This is the
  greatest wonder of all.
               
            
            
               Statuet Oues à dextris eius, &amp; Haedos à
  sinistris.
               
                  He shall place the Sheepe at his right hand, and the Goats
  at the left. Dayly experience teacheth vs, That what is good for one, is
  naught for another; that which helpeth the Liuer, hurteth the Spleene; one and
  the selfe same Purge recouers one, and casts downe another; the Light
  refresheth the sound Eye, and offendeth the sore; Wisedome saith, That
  those Rods which wrought amendment in the Children of Israell, hardned the
  hearts of the Aegyptians; the one procured life, the other, death; darkenes to
  the one was light, &amp; light to the other, darknesse. When Ioshuah
  pursued the Ammorites, God poured downe Hailestones, Lightning, and Thunder; to
  Gods enemies they were so many Arrowes to kill them; to his friends, so many
  Torches to light them. In the light of thy Arrowes,
                  
                     Abac. 3. saith Abacuc. Death to the
  Wicked is bitter, to the Good, sweete; Iudgement to the Goats is sad &amp;
  heauie, but to the Sheep, glad &amp; ioyfull; to the one a beginning of their
  torment, to the other, of their glorie. And therefore it is here said, He
  shall place the Sheepe at his right hand.
               
               From this beginning, ariseth the Iust's earnest desiring of this
  our Sauiours comming, and the Wicked's seeking to shun it. Which is made good
  by Saint Austen, vpon that place of Haggie, Hee shall come, being
  wished for of all Nations: And his reason is, because our Sauiour Christ
  being desired, it is fit that he should be knowne; and for want of this
  knowledge, it seemeth vnto him, that this place doth not so much suit with his
  first, as his latter comming. Saint Paul writing to his Disciple
  Timothie, sayes, That the Iust doe long for this judgement;2.
 Tim. 4. Rom. 2. 
                  His qui diligunt aduentum
  eius; Agreeing with that of Saint Paul to the Romans, That the
  Iust passe ouer this life in sighs &amp; tribulations, expecting that latter
  day, when their bodies shall bee free from corruption, and from death. Saint
  Iohn introduceth in his Apocalyps the soules of the Iust,
  crying out, Vsque quò Domine, sanctus, &amp; verax? Non judicas,
  &amp; vindicas sanguinem nostrum, de his qui habitant in terra?
                  
                     Apoc.
 6. 
                  How long, Lord, holy and true, &amp;c. Saint Austen
  and Saint Ambrose both say, That they doe not here craue vengeance on
  their enemies, but that by his comming to judgement, the Kingdome of Sinne may
  haue an end. Which is the same with that which we dayly beg in those words of
  our Paternoster, Thy Kingdome come. And Saint Iohn in his
  last Chapter saith, The Spirit and the Spouse, say Come, Come Lord,
  come quickely, make no long tarrying.
               That the Sinner should hate this his comming, is so notorious a
  truth, that many when things goe crosse with them, would violently lay hands on
  themselues, and rid themselues out of this miserable world, if it were not for
  feare of this Iudgement. And this was the reason why Saint Paul in
  saying, It is decreed,  that all men shall die
  once; presently addeth, After death, Iudgement: Other wise there
  would be many, as well discreet, as desperate persons, that would crie out, Let
  vs die, and make an end of our selues at once; for a speedie death is better
  than a long torment. This is that that keepes these fooles in awe, and quells
  the vaine confidence of man in generall.
            
            
               Tunc dicet Rex his, qui à dextris eius erunt, vsque
  esuriui, &amp;c.
               
                  Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, I was
  hungrie, &amp;c. Hee begins with the rewarding of the Good; for euen in
  that day of justice, he will that his mercie goe before, as well for that it is
  Gods own proper worke, as also for that it is the fruit of his bloud and
  death.
               
                  Venite Benedicti Patris mei, [Come yee blessed of my
  Father,] (a most sweet word in so fearefull a season) possidete
  Regnum, Come yee, and take possession of an eternall Kingdome.
               
                  Quia esuriui, I was hungrie, &amp;c. Some man may
  doubt, Why Christ at the day of judgement, being to examine all whatsoeuer
  actions of vertue, doth here onely make mention of mercie? I answer, For that
  Charitie is that Seale and Marke which differenceth the Children of God from
  those of the Deuill, the good Fis
                     •
                  es from the bad, and the Wheat from the Chaffe; Ecce, ego
  judico inter Pecus &amp; Pecus,
                  
                     Ezech. 36.
 Rom. 13. so saith Ezechiel: and in summe, it is the
  summe of the Law, as Saint Paul writeth to the Romans.
               Secondly, He maketh mention onely of the workes of mercie, for
  to expell that errour wherein many liue in this life; to wit, That this
  businesse of Almes-deeds is not giuen vs as a Precept whereby to bind vs, but
  by way of councel and aduice, whereby to admonish vs. And this is a great signe
  &amp; token of this truth, for that there is scarce any man that accuseth
  himselfe for the not giuing of an Almes: But withall, it is a foule shame for
  vs to thinke that God should condemne so many to eternal fire, for their not
  shewing pittie to the Poore, if it were no more but a bare councell and aduice.
  Gregorie Nazianzen, in an Oration which he makes of the care that
  ought to bee had of the Poore; proueth out of this place, That to relieue the
  poore and the needie, is not Negotium voluntarium, sed necessarium,
  not a voluntarie, but a necessarie businesse. And Saint Augustine and
  Thomas are of opinion, That we are bound to relieue the necessities of
  our neighbour, be it with food, or apparell, or councell, or our assistance,
  according to the measure of their necessitie, and our abilitie, gouerning our
  selues therein according to the rules of wisedome.
               Hence it followeth, that the sinne of crueltie carries with it a
  kind of desperation. For (as Saint Augustine saith) he must be
  condemned to eternal fire, who hath not cloathed the naked, who hath not fed
  the hungrie; he that strips another man of his cloathes, and he that
  
                     •
                  natcheth a morcell of meat from
  the mouth of the hungrie: and what shall become of him in the end, Iudicium
  sine misericordi
                        •
                      his, qui non
  faciunt misericordiam, Let not him (saith Saint Iames) looke
  for mercie in the world to come,
                  
                     Iames.
 2. 
                  that shewes not mercie in this life. One of the reasons, why
  Hamon, King Assuerus his great Fauourit, found no pittie in
  Queen Esters, nor the Kings brest, though he besought it on his knees,
  and with teares in his eyes, was, for that he had plotted such a mercilesse
  tyrannie, as to destroy all the Iews both men, women, and children, at one
  blow; and therefore deserued no fauour. Nathan p
                     •
                  opounding to Dauid that Parable of him, That
  hauing many Sheepe of his owne, had robbed his Neighbour of his onely Sheepe,
  hauing no more besides in all the world; was so incensed against this so great
  an iniurie, that he held  him for the present vnworthie of
  pardon; As the Lord liueth, he is the child of death. In a word, the
  Word of God cannot faile. And Amos in his fourth and sixth Chapter,
  threatneth those powerfull cruell ones with most seuere punishments. And
  Salomon saith, That the hard heart shall haue many a shrewd pang when
  he lies on his death bed.
               This Doctrine hath in it's fauour three powerfull reasons.
               The first, In the secular state; for the elder brother is bound
  to maintaine his younger brothers, and vpon this condition is hee made the
  heire of his house; otherwise he should be condemned for vnkind and cruell. God
  (saith Saint Basil) made the rich man the elder brother, that he might
  relieue his younger brother, the Poore. And Malachie saith, That the
  hungrie, the naked, and the maimed man, on whom the rich man bends his brow, is
  his brother; that they haue one and the same God to their Father, &amp; one and
  the same Church to their Mother.
               The second, Our Sauiour Christ is not contented that thou
  shouldst make account that thou giuest thy brother an almes, but thy selfe:
  And he doth reueale this truth, and notifie it vnto thee, to the end that thou
  shouldst not despise the Poore; Haec requies mea, reficite lassum, hoc est
  meum refrigerium. How is it possible (ô Lord) that the succouring
  of the Poore should be thy ease and thy refreshing? Because I (saith our
  Sauiour) am that poore Man; and happie is hee, who vnder the ragges of the
  Poore, diuideth the riches of God.
               The third, That this charitie towards the Poore giues vs an
  assurance of Heauen: Charitie affoords great confidence to all that
  practise it,
                  
                     Tob. 4. 
                  and will not
  suffer their soule to goe into darkenesse. Besides, Dauid calls
  that man happie, whose sinnes are couered; Beatus vir, cuius tecta sunt
  peccata. And Salomon, and Saint Peter affirme, That
  Charitie couers a multitude of sinnes, Vniuersa peccata operit
  Charitas.
               
            
            
               Discedite in ignem eternum.
               
                  Goe into euerlasting fire. This is a most cruell
  punishment,A difference of punishment according to the
 difference of Sinnes. in regard of the despaire of any future comfort.
  Micheas treating of a punishment that God was to inflict vpon his
  People, saith, I will make a wailing like the Dragons, &amp; mourning as the
  daughters of the Owle; Quia desperata est plaga eius, For her wound is
  incurable. O, with what teares, ô, with what hideous shreekes ought
  man to bewaile the desperate torments of Iudgement, and of Hell? This
  punishment all the damned shall equally suffer; nor there is not the
  immagination of any thing that can so much affright and dismay vs. But in those
  other punishments, some shall suffer more than other-some, their shame,
  confusion, and their hellish torments, being answerable to the nature of their
  offences.
               The first sort that shall suffer the seuerest punishment, shall
  be the Iewes; who in crucifying our Sauiour Christ, committed the greatest sin,
  and the heinousest offence that euer was committed in the World▪ Who, when
  at the day of judgement they shall see and perceiue whom they so impudently
  abused, shamefully mocked, cruelly scourged, scornefully crowned, rigorously
  handled, spit vpon, buffeted, and crucified, and all vndeseruedly; beeing one
  that wisht them all good, hugg'd them vnder his wing, as the hen clocketh her
  chickens, wept ouer them, and mourned for them; they shall remaine so
  thunder-strucken, so astonished, so daunted, and so dead with feare, and the
  horror of their punishment, that they shall cry vnto the mountaines, and call
  vnto the hills, with a Cadite super nos, Fall vpon vs. This lamentable
  and wretched condition of theirs,
                     Zachar. 12.
                  Zachary pointeth at, in these words, Et aspicient ad me, quem
  confixerunt, They shall looke vpon mee whome they haue pierced. And Saint
  Iohn; Videbunt, in quem crucifixerunt,  They shall see
  whom they haue crucified. And in the Apocalips, Videbit eum omnis
  oculus, Euery eye shall see him; But especially they, Qui eum pup
                        •
                     gerunt, That goard him. O what a
  cruell taking must they bee in, who are guilty to themselues in that day, how
  cruelly they vsed the Sauiour of the World?
               The second sort, are those cast-awayes, that haue made a
  couenant with Hell, whilest they liued here on Earth: Of whom Esay
  sayth, Percussimus foedus cum morte,
                  
                     Esay.
 28. 
                  &amp; cum inferno fecimus pactum (i.) Those desperate
  theeues that haue made a league with the Gallowes. And those vnworthie
  Communicants, of whome Saint Paul, That they eate and drinke their
  owne condemnation; Iudicium sibi manducat &amp; bibit. Of these, the
  sayd Esay asketh, Which of you can dwell with the deuouring Fire?
  Aut quis habitabit cum ardoribus sempiternis? Are ye of that mettall, that
  yee can suffer eternall fire, who are not able to indure temporall heate? Let
  the most desperat amongst you, he that imagines he is able to indure any
  torment, put but his finger awhile into the flame but of a candle, and hee will
  soone tell mee another tale.
               The third sort, are those that professe a perpetuall and
  euerlasting hatred to Vertue and Goodnesse, follow tyranny with delight, and
  take a pleasure in sinning, thinking there is no life to that which is
  vicious: According to that of Esay, Hee that departeth from euill, maketh
  himselfe a prey; It is death to them, to doe otherwise. And as
  Hosea hath it, Sanguis, sanguinem tetigit, Against these, God
  shall come armed with a corslet of Iustice, and with robes of Vengeance, and
  with a cloake of Zeale, and like a swift torrent, he shall sweepe away these
  reeds and bulrushes, &amp;c.
               The fourth sort, are those who deny God eyes to see the infinite
  summe and masse of those things that passe amongst men. First, because in
  themselues they are materiall; and God is a pure Spirit, and incorporeall, and
  therefore they dreame hee hath no eyes to see our actions. Secondly, because
  humane actions are oftentimes so nastie and so loathsome, that God will not
  vouchsafe to stoope so low,
                     Psal. 93. as to
  looke vpon them. Et dixerunt, non videbit Dominus nec intelligit Deus
  Iacob. Against these men, sayth Dauid, Intelligite insipientes in
  populo. The Hebrew stiles them, Bestiales: Heare ô yee
  brute beasts, harken ô you beasts, and be wise. Et stulti aliquando
  sapite, O yee fooles when will yee vnderstand? Qui plantauit aurem, non
  audiet? aut qui finxit oculum, non considerat? God gaue man eares, eyes,
  vnderstanding, and reason, and shall all these faculties be wanting to him? All
  the perfection of these effects are most eminent in the primary cause. And
  therfore, if God gaue man his hearing, his sight, &amp; his vnderstanding, much
  more must hee inioy them, who was the Author and onely giuer of them. Qui
  corripit gentes, non arguet? Qui docet hominem scientiam, (i.) He
  that correcteth the Nations shall he not reprooue? He that teacheth man
  knowledge, &amp;c.
               
               The fift sort, are those, who acknowledging in God his
  Prouidence, and his Iustice; yet will not bee persuaded, that it can be so
  seuere in that day. So saith the Psalmist; Secundum multitudinem irae suae
  non quaeret: And the cause is presently rendred, Diuisi sunt ab ira,
  vultus eius. Sophonia, painting out certaine men vnto vs drowned in their
  vices, saith, Defixos in faecibus eius, They are drowned in the dregges of
  their sinnes. And by and by giueth a reason for it; Dicunt enim in
  cordibus suis, non faciet Dominus bene, non faciet Dominus male. On the
  one side, they make this reckoning with themselues, That God is good, liberall,
  mercifull, and that hee will not doe vs much harme: and that on the other side,
  as he is just, hee will not doe vs much good. In this sinne liue they, who
  hearing from the Prophets and the Preachers of Gods Word, the horrors and
  terrors of  that day, say in their heart; In multos
  dies, &amp; in longa tempora hic Prophetat; as Ezechiel relates
  it vnto vs; Manda, remanda, expecta, reexpecta, As Esay
  complaines. What need these Prophets beate their brains &amp; keep such a stir
  about the day of Iudgement? &amp;c. And this fault, is by so much the
  greater,
                     Ezech. 12. by how much God doth so
  often inculcate &amp; reiterate in holy Scripture, the terrible
                     •
                  es of that day. For there is not that
  Prophet which doth not multiplie his meditations, &amp; doth not indeere the
  horror of that day; vsing many fearefull comparisons, for to strike a dread
  &amp; terrour vnto vs, in the woful expression of them. All which,
  Esay shuts vp in these few words, In nouissimis diebus,
  intelligetis ea. Peraduenture you that now heare me tell you this, do not
  persuade your selues that this is true, nor beleeue what I speake vnto you; but
  in the end (vnlesse God giue you the grace to be of another mind) yee will too
  late, and yet too soone to your owne griefe, acknowledge and confesse your
  errour.
               The last sort are those, who beeing puffed vp with their
  prosperitie, doe disesteeme and despise those that wrestle with aduersitie,
  and grone vnder the burthen of their miseries; thinking with themselues, That
  those blessings which God hath bestowed vpon them in this world, shall continue
  with them in that other. The Wicked liue, and are comforted with
  Riches, saith Iob; but in Hel (the Poore beeing in Paradise, and
  they in torment) they shal be forced to crie out and say of the Poore and
  Hungrie, and the Naked, These are they whom wee sometimes scorned. To
  whom Salomon makes this replie, Parata sunt derisoribus, judicia
  eius:
                  
                     Prou. 19. They shall be brought
  vpon that perdurable and eternall Stage of laughter and scorne, set vp by the
  Deuills of Hell, neuer to bee pulled downe; who shall represent themselues vnto
  these mocke-games now, that were once mockers and deriders of their poore
  brethren, in that formidable and gastly manner, as shall make their haire stand
  an end, whilest they shall heare (to aggrauate their griefs) that seuere
  Sentence, and that irreuocable Doome, pronounced from the infinite Maiestie of
  an austere and angrie Iudge, Goe yee into euerlasting fire, &amp;c.
  From which the Lord, &amp;c.
            
         
         
            
            THE SEVENTH SERMON, VPON THE TVESDAY AFTER THE FIRST SVNDAY IN
LENT.
            
               
                  MAT. 21. 
                  
                     Cum introisset Iesus Hierosolymam, commota est vniuersa
  Ciuitas.
                   
                  When Iesus entred into Ierusalem, the whole Citie was
  troubled.
               
            
            
               THe Storie of this Gospell is set downe at large in those two
Chapters,Iustification a greater worke than Creation.
               In Tomo miraculorum, which was a fit place to treat thereof. For
Origen saith, That this was a greater miracle than Christs turning of
Water into Wine, at the Wedding in Canaan. And Saint Hierome, That it
was greater than any other of our Sauiours miracles; Inter Signa omnia,
quae fecit, hoc videtur mirabilius: And the reason is, For that in
Lazarus that was dead, and in the Man that was blind, hee met with no
contradiction or repugnancie: but for to mooue so many, nay, so innumerable
wills as those of Ierusalem, and that they should be drawne to receiue him as
their King and Messias, whom the Clergie and Nobilitie did so much hate &amp;
abhorre, carries with it a plaine and manifest resistance. And, as Saint
Augustine saith, That to iustifie a Soule, is more than to create
Heauen and Earth, in regard of the opposition which the will of Man may make
thereunto; so, for our Sauior to mooue those that were aliue in that most
populous Citie, was more than to raise the dead.
            And for confirmation of this Doctrine, let vs suppose that the
earth is of that stabilitie and firmenesse, that to mooue it is a Blazon or
Cognisance only belonging vnto God. Ecclesiasticus saith, Terra
autem in eternum stat. And Athanasi
                     •
                  s giuing the reason thereof, saith, That God did knit and
fasten it in the middest of the world with such strong chains, that it remained
altogether immoouable, as beeing the Center to all the rest which God had
created. Qui fundasti terram super stabilitatem suam: The Greeke reads
it Securitatem, or Infallibilitatem. And  therefore many Phylosophers were of opinion, That all the power of
the Gods were not able to mooue it from it's place. But because nothing is
impossible vnto God and his omnipotent power, the Scripture almost in euerie
place saith, That the Heauen, the earth, and that which is vnder the earth, and
all the firmenesse and strong foundation thereof, are mooued, and shake and
tremble at the twinckling of his eyes. If then to mooue the Earth (which is a
dead thing, and which cannot make resistance, nor contradiction) bee onely the
Blazon and Cognisance of God; What a thing then is it, to mooue this liuing
Earth, which enioyes it's owne libertie, and may out of it's stubbornenesse
say vnto God, I will not. But admit it should say, I will, the miracle is no
lesse, but rather a manifest token of Gods diuine power and omnipotencie.
            It is likewise to be noted, That all the entrances which our
Sauiour Christ made, were with a great deale of noyse and clamour. In that
first which he made in the world, Haggie prophecied,
                  Hag. 1. That he should turne the Heauen and the
Earth topsi-turuie. And God did performe it, vsing as his Instrument therein,
the Emperour Octauianus Augustus. In that which hee made into Aegypt,
he did trouble all that Kingdome, by throwing their Idolls downe to the
ground, as it was prophecied by Esayas, Commouebuntur simulachra
Aegypti: So doth Procopius declare it, Eusebius,
Athanasius, and Saint Austen: But say, That in these his
entrances there was a generall motion, yet was there not a generall obedience.
But here Commota est vniuersa Ciuitas: The Greeke saith, Velut
terrae motu concussa fuit. As if it had suffered an vniuersal earthquake;
there was neither old man, nor woman, nor child, &amp;c.
            This is a great encarecimiento, or endeering of the
matter.
            First, Because our Sauiour preaching about the Cities and Townes
of that Kingdome, the Euangelists deliuer vnto vs, That all the Inhabitants
that were in those parts, left their houses and their villages emptie and
forsaken, and only for to follow him. S. Marke, he saith, Et
conueniebant ad eum vndique, vt iam non posset manifeste introire in Ciuitatem,
sed in Desertis locis esset. And Saint Luke, That they troad one
another vnder foot, and crusht the breath out of their bodies, and only to
presse to heare him; Ita vt se mutuò suffocarent. But it is to
be supposed, that many likewise staid at home; but in this his entrance into
Hierusalem, God would haue this lot to light vpon all, and therefore it is
said, Vniuersa Ciuitas, The whole Citie.
            
            Se
                  •
               ondly, In regard of
the infinite number of Inhabitants that were in that Citie; which (as
Plinie reporteth) was in those dayes the famousest in all the East:
And, in a manner, all those that haue writ thereof make mention of foure
millions of persons. Iosephus relateth, That the President of Syria
beeing desirous to render an account vnto Nero, of the greatnesse of
that Commonwealth, did desire of the high Priests, that they would giue him a
true note of the number of those Lambs which they sacrificed one Sabboth,
which were afterwards eaten by seuerall companies and Housholds, some
consisting of ten, some of 15, and some, 20 soules; and they found,The greatnes of the Iewish Sacrifices. that they did
sacrifice at euerie one of those their solemne Sabboths, two hundred fiftie six
thousand and fiue hundred Lambes; which, according to the rate of fifteene
persons in a companie, amount to foure millions and fiue hundred thousand. But
withall, it is to be noted, that neither the Sicke nor the children were
present thereat. But here, Vniuersa Ciuitas, The whole Citie came,
some out of passion, and some out of affection.
            Thirdly, For that our Sauior Christ was alreadie condemned to
death by the Chapter house of the Clergie, who had called a Conuocation, to
send out  Serjeants and Souldiers for the apprehending of
him, and had published Proclamations of rewards to those that should bring him
bound vnto them: that then, and at such a time the whole Citie should receiue
him with Songs and acclamations of King, Messias, and God (being a proscribed
man, and doomed to death) Haec mutatio dextrae excelsi, This was an
alteration which could not proceed but from the most High.
            
            
               Commota est vniuersa Ciuitas.
               
                  The whole Citie was mooued. Ierusalem had beene long
  settled in it's vices, Visitabo super viros defixos in sordibus suis, Moab
  requieuit in faecibus suis, I will search Ierusalem with candles, and
  punish the men that are settled on their lees, &amp;c. And as the wise
  Phisitions stirre and trouble the humours, cause loathings and gripings in the
  stomacke; so our Sauiour Christ in the breast of euerie one causeth a
  squeamishnesse of the stomacke by moouing and stirring those foule dregges of
  sinne wherewith they were corrupted. Et commota est vniuersa
  Ciuitas.
                  
                     Hierem. 4. Many old diseases
  are woont to be cured with some sudden passion, as of sorrow, or feare, or by
  some great and violent vomit; for euerie one of these accidents make a pause in
  the humours, and detaine the spirits: An Ague hath been seen to be put out of
  his course, and quite taken away by the sudden drawing of a sword vpon the
  Patient: and a Palsey driuen away with the sight of a mans enemie. And
  Horace telleth vs, That a couetous Miser was recouered of a great
  Lethargie, by the Physitions feigning that his heires were carrying away his
  bagges of money, and the Chests wherein his Treasure lay. In like manner, in
  the infirmities of the Soule, one turbation, one disquieting, one breaking vp
  of those Chests wherein our sinnes are massed vp, may bee the recouerie of our
  perdition. This made Dauid to say of his Soule, Sana contritiones
  eius, quia commota est, O Lord, my Soule is troubled within me, when I
  consider the foulenesse of my sinnes; it is sad and melancholy for the verie
  griefe thereof; it is much disquieted: And therefore (ô Lord) Sana
  contritiones eius, affoord me thy helping hand, for it is now high time to
  cure me of my sore.
            
            
               
                  Quis est hic? Who is this?
               
                  Gods maiesty not to bee described.This
  was a question of the enuious and appassionated Pharisees: Howbeit it seemeth
  to Origen, That it should proceed from some good honest people,
  &amp;c. Howsoeuer, it was a question, whereunto no man could fully answer: put
  Theologie, the sacred Scripture, the Doctors, the Saints, the Councells, the
  Arts, the Sciences, and all the Hierarchies of Angells, put them all (I say)
  together, and put this question vnto them, and after that they haue said all
  they can say, all will be too little to satisfie this demand of Quis est
  hic? Who is this? One of Iobs friends treating of the Maiestie
  and greatnesse of God, and how incomprehensible a thing it was, saith,
  Forsitan vestigia Dei comprehendes? Et vsque ad perfectum omnipotentem
  reperies?
                  
                     Iob. 11. 
                  Canst thou by
  searching find out Gods footsteps? Canst thou find out the Almightie vnto
  perfection? By the tracke of his footsteps, he vnderstandeth these
  inferior things that are guided and gouerned by his prouidence; And by
  perfection, which is the head of all, the highnesse of his Wisedome. In a word,
  In all, God is altogether inuestigable; in regard of his heigth, the Heauens
  come short of him, Excelsior Coelo est; see then if thou canst reach
  vnto him. Which consideration made Saint Austen to say, That God is
  not onely present in earth, which is his footstoole, and in Heauen, which is
  his Throne; but in those which are to be immagined elsewhere. How then canst
  thou reach vnto him, beeing  more deepe than Hell, longer
  than the Earth, and broader than the Sea? God tharefore beeing on the one side
  so embowelled in and beneath the Earth; and on the other, so wholely out of the
  same, (as Saint Hilarie prooueth it, Intus &amp; extra super
  omnia, &amp; internus in omnia;) How can hee fully know all, that is in
  Heauen, in Hell, in the bowells of the Earth, or in the bottome of the Sea?
  Many perhaps cannot giue a full answer to this; but the Pharisees, had they not
  beene blinded with enuie, might haue contented themselues with that of
  Moses, For he hath written of me; or of Ezechiel, who did
  prophecie of him, That he was the King and Sheepheard of Israell; or of
  Iohn Baptist, who pointed him out vnto them as it were with the
  finger; or of his Workes and Miracles, For they beare witnesse of me;
  of the Father,
                     Iohn. 5. who proclaimed him in
  Iordan to be his Sonne; of the Deuils of Hell, who with open voyce
  acknowledged him to be the Sonne of God; of the little children, who cried
  out, Hosanna to the Sonne of Dauid, blessed is he that commeth in the name
  of the Lord.
               
               
                  Quis est hic? Who is this?
                  Whether
 better a publick life or a priuate. Diuers and sundrie times Christ had
  entred into Hierusalem, and they had neuer askt this question before: but now
  the triumph and the Maiestie of this King awakens the tongues of these enuious
  People, who now begin to aske, Quis est hic? It hath beene an antient
  question doubted of, of old, Which is the better life, that of a publique, or a
  priuate person▪ 
                  Seneca in an Epistle of his, seemeth to fauour
  the former; Miserable (saith he) is that mans fortune who hath no enemie to
  enuie him. And Persius saith, That it is a great glorie to haue men
  point with the finger, and to say, There goes the Kings Fauourite. But
  Iob, hee seemeth to like better of the latter, O,
                  
                     Iob 10.18.19. 
                  that I had giuen vp the ghost,
  and no eye had seene me: would I had beene as though I had not beene: and that
  I had beene carried from the wombe to the graue. Wishing himselfe to haue
  beene of that short continuance in the world, that no man might haue knowne
  whither he had died or liued. And Horace, Neque vixit malè, qui
  natus moriensque fefellit, His life let none bemone, who liu'd and di'd
  vnknowne. Both liues haue so much to be said on either side, that the
  question remaines yet vnresolued. But admit that a publike life be the more
  desired, yet it is not the safest; for alwayes the more honour, the more
  danger.
               
                  Who is this? Your great Persons, and those that prosper
  in the world, carrie wheresoeuer they goe, such a noyse with them, that they
  giue occasion to the People to aske, Quis est hic? Iohn Baptist when
  hee thundered out in the Desert, (clad in Camells haire) That the Kingdome of
  God was at hand; iudging him to be some coelestiall Monster, they sent out to
  enquire of him, with a Tu quis es? Who art thou? The Angells seeing
  our Sauiour Christ ascend vnto Heauen with such a deale of Maiestie and glorie
  as was neuer seene before; began to aske, Quis es iste qui venit de Edom?
  Who is he that commeth from Edom? And Esay speaking of a great
  Tyrants comming downe to Hell, saith, Hell was troubled at thy
  comming. In a word, it is true in nature, That the loftie Cedars, and the
  highest and tallest Pine Trees make the greatest noyse when they are shaken
  with the wind; and the greatest Riuers the greatest roaring: And therefore it
  is no meruaile they should aske, Who is this? When a Merchant shall
  go apparelled and attended like a Knight, or some great Lord, and his wife and
  daughters like a great Ladie and her children; Who will not aske, Quis est
  hic? I knew his Grandfather, &amp;c. And for that the Pharisees were
  enuious, they did speake reprochfully of our Sauiour, euerie foot vpbraiding
  him, That he was a Carpenter, and the sonne of a Carpenter; and seeing him now
  enter Ierusalem like a King, they demanded in scorne, Quis est
  hic?

               Hic est Iesus Propheta à Nazareth Galileae.
               
                  
                     Deut. 18.
                  This is
  Iesus. By name a Sauiour, and by office a Prophet; Alluding to that
  promise made in Deutronomie, I will raise vp a Prophet of thine owne
  Nation: Beeing a plaine Prophesie of our Sauiour Christ, as appeareth in
  the third of the Acts; His Countrie, Nazareth, where he was bred, they
  not knowing that he was borne in Bethlem. Now these wise men of this World
  asking with this scorne, Who is this? and the foolish ones answering
  with that discretion, This is Iesus, &amp;c. agrees well with those
  thankes which our Sauiour gaue vnto his father, Because thou hast hid these
  things from the Wise, and hast reuealed them to Babes. It is Gods fashion,
  to ouercome a Pharaoh with Flies; and by a sillie woman, to confound
  the Learned, who said, In Belzebub the Prince of Deuills he casts out
  Deuills: by a blind man, the Iudges of Hierusalem; by a low
  Zacheus, a tall Gyant. The order of Grace is different from that of
  Nature: God, as a naturall Author, Media per summa gubernat, Gouernes the
  meane things by the highest, saith Dionysius. First, he
  communicateth his vertue &amp; his power to the supream causes; and by them, to
  the meaner and the lowest. The Sunne shines first vpon the Mountaines, and then
  shewes it selfe in the Vallies, &amp;c. But Grace oftentimes doth first
  illuminate the lowest Bottoms, and shines oftner in them, than on the
  Mountaines: it called the Sheepeheards before it called the Kings; it appeared
  vnto the Ignorant before the Wise; and shewed it selfe to Balaams
  Asse, before his Master tooke notice of it. And therefore
  Ecclesiasticus saith, That the Soule of a Iust man attaineth to more
  truth, than those Watch-Towers that are reared on the highest Walls;
  vnderstanding thereby your greatest Clerkes. A just and vpright man will now
  and then affoord you better councell than many wise men; howbeit in matters of
  difficultie, and deepe points of knowledge, and of Faith, we must alwayes haue
  recourse to the Wise.
            
            
               Caepit eijcere omnes ementes &amp; vendentes.
               
                  He began to cast out all the Buyers and the Sellers.
  Zacharie prophecying of this entrance, saith, Ecce, Rex tuus veniet
  tibi mansuetus, Behold, thy King shall come vnto thee, meeke. How can
  these two suit together, Mansuetus, and Triumphator, gentle,
  and yet a Conqueror? Teares in his eyes, and yet so angrie, that hee neuer
  shewed himself more? I haue giuen some reasons hereof in another place; those
  that now offer themselues are these:
               The first, That Mercie and Iustice are the two Poles of Gods
  gouernment: By those teares in his eyes,Mer
                        ••
                     e and Iustice the two Poles of Gods
 gouernment. and by those words of lamentation from his mouth, and by
  moouing the hearts of that hard hearted Citie, our Sauiour gaue notable proofes
  of his mercie. But finding this insufficient to make himselfe knowne amongst
  them, his Iustice then did display it's power, by whipping those Merchants,
  and in them, the Priests who had a share in their gaines: Giuing vs thereby to
  vnderstand, That hee that will not bee brought to know God by his soft hand,
  and those sweete fauours of his Mercie, shall be made to know him by the whips
  and scourges of his Iustice. God prospers thy house, thou doost not
  acknowledge it for a blessing; hee sends thee to an Hospitall laden with
  diseases, that thy miserie may teach thee to know him: He giues thee health,
  thou art not thankefull vnto him for it; hee casts thee downe on thy bed, and
  then thou giuest him thankes, not ceasing night and day to call vpon him, and
  to praise and blesse his hol
                     •
                  
  name.
                     Ps
                           •
                        al. 32. And therefore it is truly said, The Lord
  shall bee knowne while hee worketh judgement. Our Sauioue (like a good
  Physition) tries vs first by his mild  and gentle
  medicines, but they doe no good; hee therefore turnes ouer a new leafe, and
  applies those vnto vs that are more sharpe and tart, whereby we come to know as
  well his wisedome as his loue.
               The second, He began to cast out the Buyers and the
  Sellers; Because no man should presume, that the glorious acclamations of
  a King, and of a Messias, should endure to permit in his Temple such a foule
  and vnseemely buying and selling: they had no sooner proclaimed him King, but
  he tooke the whip into his hand, to scourge them for their offences. In a
  Prince, in a Iudge, and in a Preacher, flatteries and faire words are woont to
  abate the edge of the Sword of Iustice; wherefore to shew, That true praise
  ought the more to oblige a King to vnsheath his Sword, he betooke him to his
  Whip. That acclamation and applause of the little children, our Sauiour
  accounted it as perfect and good; [Ex ore Infantium &amp; Lactantiū
  perfecisti laudē propter Inimicos tuos.] Yet, for that a Prince, a Iudge,
  or a Preacher, should not bee carried away with the praises of men; our
  Sauiour, though applauded in the highest manner that the thought of man could
  immagine, Coepit eijcere Ementes &amp; vendentes, &amp;c. Reges eos in
  virga ferrea, saith Dauid: In the name of the eternall Father,
  thou shalt (my Sonne) be their Ruler &amp; their Iudge, thou shalt beare in thy
  hand a Rod of yron, which shall not be bowed as are those other limber wands of
  your earthly Iudges: theirs are like fishing rods, which when the fish bite
  not, continue strait &amp; right, but if they nibble neuer so little at the
  bait, presently bow and bend. Esay called the Preachers of his time,
  Dumbe Dogges, not able to barke: And he presently renders the reason of this
  their dumbenesse, They knew no end of their bellie. To ear, and to
  talke, none can doe these two well and handsomely together; and because these
  Dogges haue such an hungrie appetite, that they neuer giue ouer eating, because
  nothing can fill their bellie, they are dumbe, and cannot barke, they know not
  how to open their mouths.
               The third is of Saint Chrysostome and
  Theophilact; who say,Gods punishment different
 from those of Earthly Princes. That it was a kind of prophecie or
  foretelling, that these legall Offerings and Sacrifices were almost now at an
  end. When Kings and Princes expresse their hatred to any great Person in Court,
  it is a prognostication of that mans fall; The wrath of a King is the
  messenger of death. Our Sauiour Christ, the Prince of the Church, had
  twice whipt out those that had prouided Beasts for the Sacrifices of his
  temple; which was an vndoubted token of their short continuance, it beeing a
  great signe of death, that one, and such a one, should come twice in this
  manner to visit them with the Rod. This conceit is much strengthened by the
  words of our Sauiour Christ,
                     Esay 56. (
                     •
                  oretold by the Prophet Esay)
  The time shall come wherein my House shall bee called a House of Prayer, and
  not a Denne of Theeues, nor a common Market of buying and selling. So that hee
  tooke these Whips into his hands as a means to worke amendment in his
  Ministers, and to sweepe and make his House cleane. The Iudges of the earth
  (saith Saint Hierome) doe punish a Delinquent, ad
  ruinampunc; but God, adcust gationem; the one, to his vtter
  vndoing; the other, for his amendment: And therefore he vsed no other weapons
  to chastise them withall, but Rods and Whips, which worke our smart, but not
  our death; they paine vs▪ but they doe not kill vs. Tertullian is
  startled, and standeth much amased at that punishment which Saint
  Peter inflicted vpon Ananias and Saphyra, and saith,
  That to bereaue them so suddenly of their life, &amp; to strike
  
                     •
                  hem in an instant dead at his
  foot, was the punish
                     •
                  ent of a man,
  &amp; of one that had not long exercised, nor did well know what did belong on
  the office of a Bishop. But our Sauiour Christ being come into the world to
  giue men life, it would not  haue suited with his
  goodnesse to giue them death.
               The fourth reason (which all doe touch vpon) was, The disrespect
  and irreuerence which was shewne to this his Temple; a sinne which God doth
  hardly pardon: And therefore it was said vnto Ieremie, Pray not therefore
  for this People. And hee presently giues the reason why, It hath
  committed many outrages in my House. Saint Iames aduiseth, That
  the Sicke should call vnto the Priests, to get them to pray vnto God for him;
  but for him that should commit wickednes in his Temple, God willeth the
  Prophet Ieremie, that hee should not so much as pray for them. And
  Saint Paul saith, That those who shall violate the Temple of God,
  God shall destroy them.
               
               Great is the respect which God requireth to be had to his
  Temple.
               First, In regard of his especiall and particular presence there.
  Saint Austen saith, That Dauid did pray be fore the Arke,
  Quia ibi sacratior &amp; commendatior praesentia Domini erat. For
  euermore God manifests himselfe more in his Temple than any where else; that
  place beeing like Moses his Bush, or Iacobs ladder; being
  therefore so much the more holy, by how much the more he doth there manifest
  himselfe, &amp;c.
               Secondly, He shewes himselfe there more exorable, and more
  propitious to our prayers: According to that request of Salomon in the
  dedication of the temple, That his eares may be there opened. And it
  was fit it should be so, as Saint Basil hath noted it; for that,
  Prayer is a most noble act, and therefore as it requires a most noble place, so
  likewise the greater fauour appertaineth vnto it.
               Thirdly, For that Christ is there present in his blessed
  Sacraments. And therefore (as Saint Chrysostom hath obserued it)
  there must needs be there a great companie of coelestiall Spirits; for where
  the King is, there is the Court.
               Fourthly, For to stirre vp our deuotion, by ioyning with the
  congregation of the Faithfull. And a learned man saith, That the Temples &amp;
  Houses of God did put a new heart and new affections into mens brests. What
  then shall become of those who refuse these publique places of praying and
  praysing of God, and make it a Den of Theeues, working all impietie and
  wickednesse in these sacred Assemblies?
               The last reason of our Sauiours being so angrie, was, To see the
  couetousnesse that was in his Ministers. Nothing mooues Gods patience more than
  the couetousnesse of Priests, especially when they shal make a benefit to
  their purse from the bloud of the Alter. Notable is that place of
  Balaam, when he went to curse the People of Israell, the Asse which
  carried him thither was willing to shew him his errour, God opening his mouth,
  and making his tongue to speake. And Saint Austen strucken into
  amasement at the rarenesse thereof, confesseth, Tha
                     •
                   he knows not what greater wonder than
  this could possibly be immagined, tha
                     •
                   that the Prophet should not bee affrighted, hearing an Asse to
  open his mouth and reprooue him. And he renders two reasons for it: The one,
  That Sorceries and Witcheries were so common in those dayes; for there was not
  any nation that had not it's Magicians and Sorcerers, as Trismegistus
  in Aegypt; Z
                        •
                     r
                        •
                     
                     astes in Persia; Orpheus
  in Greece; besides many Sybels in diuers other countries. The other, That he
  was blinded with that good round summe of money which he was to receiue out of
  hand▪ [Habentes pretium diuinationis in manibus] king
  Balack's Messengers had so greased his fists with good gold, that hee
  minded not that so great a miracle as the talking of his Beast. And this is a
  thing worthy the noting, That Saint Hierome and Saint Austen
  doe not onely make him a Prophet, but a holy Prophet, and that his
  couetousnesse had thus misseled him. And as  Saint
  Peter saith, Through couetousnesse shall they with feigned words make
  merchandise of you, whose iudgement lingreth not, and whose damnation
  slumbreth not; which haue forsaken the right way, and are gone astray,
  following the way of Balaam the sonne of Bozor, who loued the
  wayes of vnrighteousnes, but was rebuked for his iniquitie, the dumbe Asse
  forbidding him his madnesse, by speaking vnto him in a mans voyce.
               
                  He began to cast out all the Buyers. That one man
  should bee able to doe more than a whole Squadron, seemeth somwhat strange: but
  that none of those whom he whipt should dare to giue him so much as a word, is
  much more strange.
               The first reason, saith Saint Hierome, (which is also
  repeated by Thomas) was, That the Maiestie of the Deitie shined in
  his face. Whither or no, that in our Sauiour Christ that Maiestie were
  ordinarie, or whither hee had then put it on, for that it is a common custome
  with God, in those disrespects done to his temple, to discouer his greatnesse
  the more. And so when he punished Heltodorus, who would haue rob'd the
  Treasurie of the Temple, (wherein were deposited those moneys which belonged
  vnto Widdowes and Orphans) the Text saith, Spiritus omnipotentis Dei magnam
  fecit suae ostentionis euidentiam, The Lord of Spirits, and the Prince of
  all power caused a great apparition, so that all that presumed to come in with
  him were astonished at the power of God, and fainted, and were sore affraid. A
  Lyon when hee waxeth angrie sparkeleth fire forth of his eyes, and with his
  roaring makes all the beasts of the Forrest affraid, &amp; to flie from his
  anger. The Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda was angrie, his eys flamed forth fire;
  O culi eius tanquam flamma ignis, saith the Apocalyps. And
  Saint Hierome, That the beames of his wrath brake forth, &amp; that he
  roared out with a loud voyce, What make these Theeues heere in my House,
  &amp;c. Who is able to withstand him? Who can resist his rage? Seneca
  in the Tragedie of Hercules, represents him there in that mad and
  furious manner, that making towards his sonne, the verie sight of him strucke
  him dead. Whereunto suteth that which the Prophet Abacuc saith of
  God, Aspexit &amp; dissoluit Gentes, He beheld and cloue asunder the
  Nations.
                  
                     Abac. 3. Iob. 25. This
  force and power of Gods eye forced Iob to say, Potestas &amp;
  terror apud Deum est, Dominion and feare are with him.
               
               The second is,Vice euer afraid of
 Vertue. That great cowardise which the face of Vertue casts on that of
  Vice; the Armies of Enemies, the sight of Deuills are not more fearefull to
  behold. There shall not in that finall day of Iudgement be any torment equall
  to that which the Damned shall feele when they shall see the face of our
  Sauiour Christ, whom they scorned, scoffed, and reuiled. Iosephs
  brethren were astonished when they heard hi
                     •
                   say, Ego sum Ioseph, I am your brother
  Ioseph,
                  
                     Gen. 45. whome yee
  persecuted and sould into Aegypt, &amp;c. To those eyes which haue alwayes
  liued in darkenesse, the light is most painefull vnto them. And of the damned
  in Hell Iob saith, Si subito aparuerit aurora, arbitrantur vmbram
  mortis,
                  
                     Iob 24. 
                  The morning is to
  them euen as the shadow of death. For this cause some Doctors for their
  greater punishment will haue the Damned that are in Hells Dungeon, lie with
  their faces vpward, looking towards Heauen. And Seneca in the Tragedie
  of Hercules saith, That when he dragg'd Cerberus out of that
  darke place, as soone as he saw the light he drew himselfe backe with that
  force, that hee had almost throwne that Conquerour to the ground. And in that
  rape of Proserpina by Pluto, it is feigned, That when his
  Coach Horses came to see the light, they striued with all their might and maine
  to returne backe againe to Hell. In like manner, those glittering beames of
  light which brake forth from the eyes of our Sauiour Christ, did dazle those of
  these Money-changers, and made them to rest as men amased.
               
                  
                  Iosephus reporteth, That there
  were three Sects amongst the Iewes, the Essei, the Iebusei,
  and the Saducei; and besides these, they had certaine Scribes which
  were their Sages, or the wisest men amongst them: The Greeks called them
  Philosophers; the Chaldaeans, Magi; the Latines, Doctors. And of
  these there were some in euerie Tribe, and in euerie Sect, &amp; in euerie
  State, as it passeth now amongst vs.
               
                  Epiphanius saith, That they had two Offices.
               The one, To expound the Law, and to preach it to the People, who
  came euerie Sabboth to their Synagogues, as appeareth in the Acts. And
  as Iosephus and Philon hath it,
                     Acts. 9. They were called Lectores,
  Readers, because they read vnto them; and Scribes, because they expounded
  the Scriptures. And Esdras termes them Scribes and Readers: And Saint
  Luke relateth, That Paul &amp; Barnabas comming to
  Antiochia, and entring into the Synagogue, a Scribe read the Law, and Saint
  Paul preached vnto the People.
                     Acts
 13.
               
               The second Office was, To be Iudges, He shall be deliuered
  to the Princes, and to the Scribes, and they shall condemne him to death,
  so saith Saint Mathew. And those that presented the Adulteresse to our
  Sauiour Christ, were the antientest of all the rest of the Sects; for it
  appeareth in Leuiticus, That they began with that Law that commanded
  them not to drinke wine, nor any thing that might distemper them; That yee
  may haue knowledge to discerne betwixt that which is holy and prophane, and
  may teach the Children of Israell. They did vse likewise Philacteries, and
  other Hypocrisies:The Austeritie and Hypocrisie of the
 Scribes. And therefore our Sauiour did no lesse reprehend them, than he
  did the Pharisees for their fringes, they would prick themselues with thorns,
  and their feet were commonly besmeered with bloud; they had the Law written in
  their forehead, and in other parts of their apparell: Alluding to that
  commanded by God in Deutronomie,
                  
                     Deut.
 6. 
                  Thou shalt bind my Precept in thy hand. Iosephus
  recounteth, That Alexandra mother to Hircanus the High
  Priest, and to Aristob
                        •
                     
                     lus, did greatly fauour them: &amp; because after his mothers
  death he denied them this fauour, he was hated of the People. In a word, In
  diuine worship, and in publique prayer, they were most respected; not because
  they were more holy, but because they did striue to seeme so: wherewith they
  did cloake their auarice and their crueltie; and ioyning with the Merchants in
  their gaines, they had equal part with them also in their punishment: wherewith
  being offended, they afterwards said, By what power doost thou these
  things? But they may be wel enough answered with that of Saint
  Chrysostome, Yee will not heare; but though yee be silent, the little
  children shall speake forth his praise; and should they hold their peace, the
  verie Stones in the Street should voyce him to be the King, and Messias.
            
         
         
            
            THE EIGHTH SERMON, VPON THE WEDNESDAY AFTER THE FIRST SVNDAY
IN LENT.
            
               
                  MAT. 12.38. 
                  
                     Accesserunt ad Iesum Scribae &amp; Pharisaei, dicentes,
  Magister, volumus a te signum videre.
                   
                  The Scribes and Pharisees came vnto him, saying, Master, wee
  would see a signe from thee.
               
            
            
               A After that famous miracle of him that was possessed with a
Deuill, as also of the Deafe, Blind, and Dumbe,The wicked
  behauiour of the Pharises towards Christ. and that our Sauiour Christ
had with powerfull reasons prooued, That for such a worke as that, was
necessarily required a supernaturall vertue; the Scribes and Pharises came
vnto him, who were the grauest persons of that Commonwealth, saying, Master,
your person with those of our Religion is in great esteeme; and the wonders and
miracles that thou hast wrought amongst vs, hath woon thee a great deale of
credit and reputation: but looking well into them, wee haue found this one
fault in them, that all of them are wrought vpon ordinarie and common things;
as in giuing eyes to the Blind, a tongue to the Dumb, dispossessing a Deuill;
miracles done as well by others as thy selfe, as our owne Prophets beare
witnesse: and seeing thou hast got thee a greater name than they, we would
faine see thee doe greater miracles than they; as to stop the Sun in his
course, like Ioshuah; to raine downe Manna from Heauen, like
Moses; to raise whirle-winds, cloath the aire with clouds, rattle
forth thunder, and dart rayes of lightning, as God did when hee came to giue
the Law: In a word, Master, wee would haue thee to shew vs a miracle from
Heauen. Our Sauiour Christ, who to a syllable knew how to spell this their
damnable and deuilish intention, sayd vnto them, O yee accursed and adulterous
generation, Seeke yee after signes in Heauen for to discredit those that are
done on earth? Account yee these as nothing? Are they illusions and impostures
with yee? I tell you, yee shall haue no signe giuen yee but that of
Ionas; the men of Niniuie shall rise vp in iudgement 
 
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
                
                
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
                
                against yee, and condemne yee for a stiffe necked
generation, because they repented at the preaching of Ionas, &amp;
behold, a greater than Ionas is here, and ye heare him not, nor are
your stonie hearts made malleable with the hammer of his words and workes. The
Queene of the South came from the vttermost parts of the earth to heare the
wisedome of Salomon; and behold, a greater than Salomon is
here, and yee heare him not. Our Sauiour Christ with this answer bung'd vp the
mouthes of the Scribes and Pharisees; whilest one of them that was subtiller
than the rest, seeking to accuse him of arrogancie, pulling him by the sleeue,
told him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speake
with thee▪ As if he would haue said, What a deale of pride is this for a
Carpenter, and the Ki
                  •
               seman of a
companie of poore Fishermen? But our Sauiour Christ proouing, That true Kindred
was contracted rather by the Spirit, than the Flesh, told them, My mother and
my brethren are those that doe the will of my Father.
            
               Generatio praua &amp; adultera signum quaerit, &amp;c.
               
                  A wicked and adulterous Generation seekes a signe.
  Though patience in our Sauiour Christ were a thing so naturall vnto him, yet
  may it well be wondred at, that to so many iniurious both workes and words, hee
  made so mild an answere. That Fire should burne, that Snow should coole, that
  what is heauie should tend downeward, and what is light ascend vpward; that the
  Sunne should giue light, that Heauen should glad the heart of man, that a
  Fountaine should flow, it is not much: But that the Sunne, rising for and to
  all, should denie his light to him that desires it; the Heauen, it's
  cheerefulnesse and influences; the Fountaine, water to the thirstie; and that
  our Sauiour Christ, the chiefest of Hierusalem comming vnto him, and with a
  great deale of respect crauing a signe and miracle of him, that he should make
  fooles of them, and rid them away for such, it is somewhat strange, and will
  require a Quaere, why and wherefore he did it.
               And this difficultie is made the greater, for that it is an
  incomparable piece of seruice, to craue and beg any thing of God. The Scripture
  stileth Prayer, A sweet perfume: And the Church calls it, Scalam
  petitionum, The Ladder whereby our Prayers ascend vnto God: And hee that
  petitions God as he ought, the more hee askes, the more God holds him his
  friend. And King Ahaz, who would not require any miracle, the Prophet
  Esay offering him Heauen, Earth, and Hell, condemned him of ill
  manners, accusing him to haue dealt therein verie discourteously with God. How
  comes it then to passe, that the most religious and grauest kind of People
  that were in Hierusalem, comming to craue a miracle, our Sauiour should giue
  them this strange answer, A wicked and adulterous generation seekes a
  signe, and no signe shall be giuen it, &amp;c.
               
               
                   
                     Reasons why our Sauiour thus answered the Pharises. 
                     The benefits in hauing Christ our maister.
                  The
  first reason is, for that they scornefully called him Master, when as they held
  him to be an Imposter, and one that was possessed with a Deuill. One of the
  greatest fauours that euer God shewed to his Church, was in giuing our Sauiour
  Christ to be it's Master; and the greatnesse of this good, hee particularly

               The one, in dispelling the darkenesse of our ignorance; For as
  the light of this materiall Sunne, doth inrich and beautifie the day,
  bannishing from vs the pitchie darkenesse of the night, to the end, that these
  our corporall eyes may behold the beautie of the World; so the light of that
  spirituall Sunne, doth inrich and beautifie the day of the new Law, driuing
  from vs the darkenesse of  the old Law: And therefore
  those times of the old Testament, were called by the name of Night, Nox
  praecessit, (i.) The Night is p

               The other, for that all Masters whatsoeuer in the World besides,
  doe not effectually persuade and moue the Will of man; But this Master of ours,
  doth penetrate with his words, the very innermost parts of the Soule, and the
  secret corners of the Heart; He mooues it, and persuades it by milde, yet
  powerfull meanes. Esay, making a promise on Gods behalfe to his
  people, this Doctor touched both these effects, Dabit tibi Deus panem a

  admonishing and persuading thee, Haec est via, ambulate in ea, This is the
  way, walke in it. A little water and a little bread, but much light of
  learning; for towards those whom God best loueth, he carries a hard and
  straight hand, in those good things which concerne the bodie, but showes
  himself very franke and liberall in those blessings that belong to the Soule.
  And one dramme of Wisedome, is better than many quintals of Gold. God did
  applaud Salomons petition, because making slight account of riches,
  of lordships, and of reuenging himselfe vpon his enemies, he did begge
  Wisedome at his hands: and therefore possessed with this diuine Spirit, hee
  sayd afterwards;
                     Sap. 8.

                     dome is better than the most precious
  Riches, and whatsoeuer is to bee desired, is not comparable to it. Saint
  Ierome noteth, that the Prophet sayth, Thou shalt see this thy Master
  with thy eyes, in regard of those just and right actions, which hee shall
  alwayes set before thine eyes: And, that thou shalt heare him with thy eares,
  in regard, that as thou art a sinner, hee shall be still calling thee to
  repentance, preaching and crying out vnto thee to returne backe from thy euill
  wayes, shewing thee, that This is the way, walke in it. It is a
  metaphore borrowed from a Trauailour that hath lost his way amongst woods and
  rockes, where hee is ready at euerie step to breake his neck; and therefore
  like a good sheapheard, greeuing to see him thus wilfully to runne on to his
  destruction, hee calleth out aloud vnto him, telling him, This is the
  way. In like manner, the World beeing as it were lost, and blinded in the
  true knowledge of God and his sonne Christ Iesus, setting before vs the way of
  the Gospell, hee cries out vnto vs, that wee might not goe astray; Haec est
  via, This is the way. This was a great, and extraordinarie fauour, and
  the Prophet Ioel giues the paralell thereof to the Church;
                     Ioel 2.

  inestimable a price, that Aristotle asking the reason, why they had no
  set stipend or reward, as many other Offices &amp; States had? answeres it
  thus, Because there could bee no reward answerable to their desert. What then
  might this Master merit of the World, beeing so singular and learned a
  Teacher, in whome were deposited all the treaseres of the Wisedome of God? In
  regard of this happinesse, our Sauiour Christ sayd, Beati oculi qu

                      vident quae vos vide

                     is. The Scribes therfore and the Pharisees, comming vnto him,

                  aile that  the
  mildenesse of this Lambe, should be turned into the furie of a Lyon, and that
  he sayd vnto them, Generatio mala, &amp;c.
               
               Saint Chrysostome sayes, That they went about to
  flatter him, as they had done at other times, when they spake vnto him by the
  same name; As when they said, Magister,
                  
                     Mat. 22. Luke 18. Luke 20.
                  licet censum dare Caesari? Magister, quod est mandatum magnum in Lege?
  Magister, quid faciendo, vitam aeternam possidebo? Master, is it lawfull to
  giue tribute vnto Caesar? Master, which is the great Commandement in the Law?
  Master, What shall I doe to inherit eternall life? And that our Sauiour
  being offended, that they should flatter him with their mouths, whom they
  abhorred in their hearts (beeing like vnto those lewd women, who the lighter
  they are, the fuller of flatterie) he grew somewhat hot and angrie with
  them.
               But I conceiue the fault of these Scribes and Pharisees was more
  foule than so: For flatterie vsually carryeth with it a desire to please, and
  is full of courtesie, which these kind of People neuer expressed towards our
  Sauiour. And this my suspition is the more augmented by that miracle of that
  blind man, whom the Scribes (as supreame Iudges) so strictly examined; asking
  him so often, Who is he that hath healed thee? To whom he answered, My Masters,
  I haue told yee alreadie, Why are yee so importunate with me? Are ye purposed
  peraduenture to bee his Disciples? This made my Gentlemen verie angrie;
  insomuch that they said, Tu Discipulus illius sis, Wee wish thee no
  worse plague, than that thou maist be his Disciple. So that holding this a kind
  of curse and malediction, and yet to stile him with the name of Master, must be
  a stuffe that is made of a courser thred than Flatterie.Scorning, a Vice peculiar to the Iewes. Besides, mocking
  and scorning was a proper and peculiar vice annexed to the Iewes. And Saint
  Chrysostome doth not terme it onely flatterie, but adulation, and
  irrision; Verba (inquit) sunt plena adulatione &amp; irrision
                        •
                     . And that Text of Saint
  Luke fauoureth this opinion, Alij tentantes eum, signum de coelo
  quaerebant, Others tempting him, required a signe from heauen. Where this
  word Tentantes implieth much more. And the Author of the imperfect
  Worke saith, That these Scribes and Pharisees vsed double dealing herein,
  desiring nothing more, than by this their soothing with him, to discredit our
  Sauiour Christ; alledging, That those miracles were not so sure and certaine,
  as to enforce beliefe, or to merit their vndoubted credence: And that they
  being (as it were) the Suns of that Commonwealth, whom the people did credit
  and respect next vnder God, they did labour to winne themselues credit in his
  presence, by disgracing those miracles which our Sauiour had wrought. But our
  Sauiour hauing recourse to the honour of his Father, and his owne reputation,
  could not hold▪ being so iustly incensed against them, but must needs
  breake out into these termes with them, A wicked generation, &amp;c.
  God complained by his Prophets, That the sinnes of his people had quite altered
  his naturall condition, Let Samaria perish (saith Osee)
  because she hath prouoked her God.
                  
                     Ose
 14. And anon after he saith the same, of Ephraim; Gods heart being so
  mild, so gentle, so louing, and so full of compassion,
                     Lament. 3. the sinnes of Samaria and of Ephraim
  had prouoked it to bitternes. Ieremie in his Lamentations
  complaineth, Repleuit me amaritudinibus, &amp; inebriauit me absynthio, He
  hath filled me with bitternesse, he hath made me drunken with Wormwood.
  Ezechiel stiles the people, Domus exasperans, A House which doth
  exasperate Gods nature,
                     Acts 1. being so
  noble, so free, so pittifull. Of Iudas Saint Luke saith,
  Suspensus crepuit medius, He burst asunder in the midst, and all his
  bowells gushed out. And this was not without some great mysterie, That his
  vitall spirit should not goe out at his throat, being streightned with the
  halter, nor through his mouth, for that therewith (though treacherously) he had
  kist his Sauiour; but out of the  verie heart and bowells
  of him, for there it was that his hatred lay. And though in other outward
  things there may be feigning and dissembling; the heart cannot loue and hate
  at once. And therefore beeing so many monstrous mis-shapes in the rest of the
  parts of mans bodie, as two heads, two hands, two feet, and the like; yet did
  Nature neuer consent that there should be two hearts; onely it is vsed as an
  embleme to expresse a traitor, who loues with the one,
                     Eccle. 2. and hates with the other. Woe to
  them that are of a double heart, saith Salomon. Simeon and
  Leui had double hearts when they dealt so deceitfully with the Prince
  of Sichem: And because we might not think that their father had a hand in it,
  and that they did it by his aduice; at the houre of his death he called them
  Instruments of crueltie. Ezechiel calls them Foxes, who deuoure the
  grapes of the Vine, and hide themselues vnder the leaues thereof; [Quafi
  Vulpes in Deserto, Prophetae tui.] Chrysologus, That they wage warre
  against Vertue, with Vertue; against Fasting, with Fasting; against Prayer,
  with Prayer; against Mercie, with Mercie; and against Miracles, by crauing
  other Miracles. And if it were abhominable before God, that a man should put on
  womans apparell, and a woman, mans, (as it is in Deutronomie) much
  worse will it seem in his sight, that the euill man should put on the disguise
  of him that is good, &amp; that Vice should put on Vertue's cloathes. In
  Ecclesiasticus God threatneth the Hypocrites,
                     Eccle. 2. That he wil pull off their maskes and
  disguises in the midst of all the People; Attende ne reuelet Deus absconsa
  tua, &amp; in medio Synagogae elidat te. Our Sauiour had a faire occasion
  offered vnto him for to discredit and disgrace them, and therefore plucking
  their maskes from off their faces, he said, A wicked and adulterous
  Generation seeketh a signe, &amp;c.
               
               
                  We would s
                        •
                     e a
  signe from thee. The second reason is, The insenciblenesse of this people,
  that amongst so many &amp; such strange miracles, they should (as if all the
  rest were worth nothing) require other newer and greater miracles. Potest
  ne quisquam (saith Saint Chrysostome) adeo stolidus
  inueniri?
                  The hardnes of a sinfull Heart. 
                  Can
  any man bee found so foolish? Nor is that particle Tunc (which is
  referred to a summe of miracles, which summe can hardly be reduced to a summe)
  of the least consideration in this place: Tunc, Then, when they should
  haue kneeled downe before him to haue kissed his feet, and acknowledged how
  much they were bound vnto him; Tunc, Then, when they should haue
  seemed to be astonished and wonder-strucken at his miracles; Tunc,
  Then, when they were to haue beene conuinced, and like Paul to
  haue fallen into a trance; Then do they obstinatly perseuer in their
  malice. This holy doctor saith, that Ionas was a type &amp;
  figure of this so profound a sleep. The tempest driues the sea before it,
  seeming for feare to runne away from the furie of those fierce and terrible
  winds; and yet Ionas sleepeth: The waues couer the Clouds, and
  discouer the bottomlesse Gulfes, striking a terrour both in the Mariners and
  the passengers, and yet Ionas sleepeth: the sayles and tackling are
  all to-be rent and torne, the helme broken and lost, and none left to gouerne
  the Ship, and yet Ionas sleepeth; the maine-mast is split in sunder, a
  planke is sprung, the Pylots and the Mariners multiplie their prayers to their
  false Gods, which are painted in the prow of their ship, 
  Viridesque Deos, quibus aequora curae; and yet
  Ionas sleepeth; nay, hee routs and snoarts in securitie, and is not
  sencible of the great danger he is in. The like effect did Christs comming
  worke with his people: There was a generall hurrie both in Heauen and Earth,
  such an Inquietudo and turbation as was prophecied by the Prophet
  Haggie, Behold,
                  
                     Hagi.
                     
                        •
                     . 
                  yet again I will
  mooue the Heauen and the Earth. And this people hauing with teares &amp;
  with sighes desired, that they might be so happie as to see their Sauiour, is
  now fast  asleep. The Dead liue, the Deafe heare, the
  Blind see, the Lame goe, the stones of the Temple are torne in sunder, the
  Graues open, the Sun is eclipsed, and the Moone darkened, and this great Ship
  of the World is tossed to and fro, with the furie of the winds, and yet this
  people sleepeth; and would to God they were but asleepe: for he that sleepeth,
  euerie little noyse will awaken him; but these men hauing the eyes of their
  bodie open, are as blind as any Beetle in those of their soule. They are in
  condition like vnto those Deuills of whom Iob speaketh, Cor eius
  indurabitur quasi lapis, &amp; extinguetur quasi malleatoris incus: He
  compares their heart to a stone, and thinking this too short a comparison,
  (for that the hardest stone is cut and hewne with the Cheesill and Hammer) he
  compares it to a Smiths Anuile, which the more it is beaten vpon, the harder it
  growes. And Saint Gregorie hath obserued, That on the Anuile all other
  mettalls are made soft, are wrought to bee plyable, and are reduced to diuers
  formes and shapes; but the Anuile it selfe continues still harder and harder.
  In the said chapter Iob saith, That the bodie of Leuiathan
  was ioyned and knit together, and that the mettall of his scales was like
  strong Shields, surely fastned together: Alluding (as it should seeme) to that
  which Ieremie speaketh of his Children, Dabis eis scutum cordis,
  &amp;c. Thou shalt giue them, ô Lord, a heart like a shield of Brasse,
  which shall rebound backe vpon thine own bosome, those shafts that thou shalt
  shoot against them: for those fauours and those blessings which thou
  bestowest vpon them, make their hearts the harder; and they are so blinded
  through their sinnes, that their hearts are become as hard as a Target of yron,
  to the end that the inspirations of thy holy Spirit may not pierce them
  through. And if they that are hard deserue to be hardly dealt withall, it is
  not amisse, that our Sauiour should say vnto them, Generatio mala &amp;
  adultera signum quaerit, A wicked and adulterous generation seekes after a
  signe▪ &amp;c.
               
               The third reason discouers it selfe in this word
  Volumus. What, Will they preferre their owne proper will in the
  presence of God; beeing, the summe of his Doctrine is, Qui vult venire post
  me, abneget semetipsum, He that will follow mee, must denie himselfe?
  Saint Augustine treateth at large, in his bookes De Ciuitate
  Dei, That the materialls of Babylon were, their owne proper will. And if
  these men had not beene too much wedded to their owne will, Ierusalem had
  flourished more than al the Cities of the world besides. The greatest affront
  that former or future Ages haue seene, or shall see, was that which the Iewes
  offered to our Sauiour Iesus Christ, judging him more worthie the Gallowes,
  than Barabas: All which, p
                     •
                  oceeded from their owne proper will. Whom will yee that I
  should let loose vnto you? It was Pilats proposition vnto them:
  and when it was left to their owne proper will, (saith Saint Bernard)
  and that it was left to their choyce, and that the power was now in their
  hands, In proprium desaeuit authorem, They rage against him that made
  them. Once when our Sauiour Christ made petition to his Father in the
  name of that inferiour portion, Father, if it be possible, let this Cup
  depart;
                  
                     Mat. 26. (as beeing jealous of
  his owne proper will, he presently had recourse to his Fathers will) Yet
  not as I will,
                  
                     Iohn 6. 
                  but as thou
  wilt. And in another place, I came downe from heauen, not to doe my
  owne will, but the will of him that sent me. O sweet Iesu! Thy will
  conforming it selfe to the will of thy Father, Why shouldest thou bee affraid?
  It was to teach thee, That if our Sauiour Christ stood in feare of his owne
  will,Not more pernicious to himselfe. (it being
  impossible for him to will more than what stood with his Fathers will) thou,
  that doost not conforme thy selfe according to the will of God, it is not much,
  that thou shouldst be affraid thereof. Seneca saith in one of his
  Epistles, That the seuerest Rod that we can desire, is, to desire of God, 
   that he wil fulfil our wil, &amp; our seeking after that
  good, from which we ought to flie. Hence it commeth to passe, That our owne
  will is the Leuen of our owne hurt; as also of Gods wrath and displeasure
  towards vs. And Thomas renders the reason thereof; for, Voluntas
  in homine est Regina potentiarum h
                        •
                     manarum, Mans Will is the Queene of humane faculties: To whose
  charge is committed the treating and obtaining of our desired ends; and is so
  absolute a Soueraigne, that although the Vnderstanding be in it selfe so noble,
  as nothing more; it speaketh vnto it by memorialls, and representing thereunto
  the reason of that which shee propoundeth vnto it, in the end she comes to
  follow her owne liking. And forasmuch as Diuine Will is that vniuersall
  Empresse, against whom none ought to display their Banner; she finds her selfe
  especially offended, and counts it a kind of high treason, that humane Will
  should rebel against her, there being no other Wil neither in heauen, nor in
  earth, more than the Wil of God: And this Lesson we are taught in our Pater
  noster, Thy Kingdome come; thy Will be done in earth, as it is in heauen.
  The earth is thy Kingdome, as well as the heauen; and therefore, thy Will be
  done in earth, as it is in heauen. Now the Scribes and Pharisees growing into
  competition with the Will of God, saying Volumus; it is no meruaile,
  that our Sauiour should say vnto them, Generatio mala &amp; adultera,
  &amp;c. Gregorie Nissen saith, That as we are all wounded in Paradice, by
  our Father Adam
                  ▪ by that sore poyson of Disobedience, and by the
  sword of our owne Selfe-will; so are we all healed by our obedience to the Will
  of God, which is the graue &amp; sepulchre (as Climachus hath it) of
  our proper Will; and this we dayly craue in these words, Thy Will be
  done. And Petrus Chrysologus doth bewaile the wretched estate of
  this World, for it's fulnesse of Selfe-loue.
               
                  We would see a signe from thee. What? Were not those
  miracles sufficient which our Sauiour had done alreadie? They might haue
  satisfied the Vnderstanding, but they could not satisfie the Will. S.
  Iohn was the Light,
                     Iohn 5. and many
  were cheered with it, [Exultauerunt in luce eius;] but the Will stood
  not affected therevnto. And Deutronomie saith,
                     Deut. 21. Nothing more profitable to Man, than the
 obeying of Gods Will. That God wrought great signes and wonders in
  Aegypt, but the Children of Israell had not a heart to vnderstand them, Et
  non dedit vobis cor intelligens. Which is all one with that which
  Dauid deliuereth in somewhat darker words, V
                        •
                     x Domini intercidentis flammam ignis. For God is
  woont in the fire, to diuide the light from the flame, giuing light to the
  Vnderstanding, but not fire to the Will. That therefore now a dayes in the
  Church there should be so many Sermons, so many Preachers, so much Light, and
  so little Fruit thereof; the reason of it is, That the Vnderstanding is
  informed, but the Wil is not conformed; the former being contented, but the
  latter not conuinced. The Deuill did endeauour, that our Sauiour Christ should
  doe a miracle sine fructu, to no good in the World, when he lay at
  him to turne the stones into bread; which might haue amased his Vnderstanding,
  but not haue abated his Will. And the Scribes and Pharisees, like the Sonnes of
  such a Father, taking this their Selfe-will from their Sire, place therein
  their chiefest foelicitie. Gregorie Nissen saith, That when that
  lasciuious Ladie tooke hold of Iosephs cloake, and kept it still in
  her hands, and would not let it goe▪ a man would haue thought, that hee
  might haue escaped from her to his lesse cost: But the Deuill, who had put that
  Will into her, had likewise put to his helping hand, in making her take hold on
  his cloake: And against two Deuills, one incarnate, and another spiritual, What
  can a holy young man doe lesse, than leaue his cloake behind him?
               From whence I inferre a conclusion of no small consequence, That
  one of the greatest things that God had to doe in the World, was to
  affectionate our  Will. All the actions of our Sauiours
  life and death had two intents: The one, To redeeme vs from the seruitude and
  slauerie of the Deuill: The other, To infuse loue into our hearts; I came
  to set fire on the earth, and what remaines but that it burne? With this
  double charge of his, which cost him no lesse than his life, and the shedding
  of his most pretious bloud, he left a free entrance for vs to get into Heauen.
  And if any man shall aske me, Which was the greater cost of the two? I answer,
  That our Sauiour found greater difficultie in affectionating vs for Heauen,
  than in purchasing Heauen for vs, or in conquering the Deuill and Hel: For one
  onely drop of his bloud was sufficient to do this; but for to affectionate our
  will, all his bloud in his bodie would scarce suffice. And therefore Saint
  Cyprian saith, That he was willing to suffer so much, though he might,
  and that in rigour, haue satisfied with so little. For, though a little might
  haue serued the turne, for to worke our redemption; yet a little was not enough
  for to inflame our hearts with the fire of his loue. This sence may suit with
  that saying of Saint Paul, so diuersly commented, Gaudeo in
  passionibus meis, &amp; adimpleo quae desunt passionum Christi in carne
  mea.
                  
                     Coloss. 1. 
                  I reioyce in my
  sufferings for you, and fulfill the rest of the afflictions of Christ, in my
  Flesh. Why should the Apostle say so? For what can be wanting to those
  passions of Christ, which were so aboundant and all sufficient? Marry, That wee
  might make true benefit thereof, and that hee might infuse this affection into
  our hearts, the Apostle saith, I desire to be dissolued, and to be with
  Christ.
               
                  Volumus a te signum videre, (i.) We would haue a
  signe from thee, Saint Luke addeth,Hypocrites
 great fauorers of Miracles. 
                  De coelo, from Heauen; alij tentantes,
  signum de coelo quaerebant. It is the condition and nature of Hypocrites
  to be friends and fauourers of Miracles, which make a great noise in the world,
  but doe little or no good at all. They are Admirationis magis, quam
  pietatis; things rather of admiration than pietie. An Hypocrite, will
  outwardly cloath himselfe with the Camels haire of a Iohn Baptist,
  with the mortification of a Saint Ierome, and with Penitence it selfe;
  but because in the inward man, Charitie is wanting vnto him, his bowels haue
  no compassion▪ but are full of extortion and crueltie. And therefore
  Saint Paul giueth this caueat vnto vs, and it is a good one, Nemo
  vos seducat, volens in humilitate, &amp; religione Angelorum, Let no man
  deceiue you with feigned humilitie, nor a dissembled deuotion, reuealing vnto
  yee, that they haue had the vision of Angels, and that they appeared thus and
  thus vnto them; for, if to remooue mountaines from one place to another without
  Charitie, be but a beating of the Ayre, quasi aerem verberans, or like
  the sound of bels, which suddenly vanisheth; so likewise these their visions
  (without charitie) shall be but vaine and idle. Of Antechrist, the Apocalips
  saith, That hee shall cause fire to come downe from Heauen; and Saint
  Efrem, that hee shall remooue Islands and mountaines, and that hee
  shall walke vpon the waues of the Sea, as on drie Land, and that hee shall flie
  in the Ayre and take no harme; And Rabanus, That hee shall make the
  fields to brin
                     •
                   forth flowers in
  the heart of Winter as if it were in the midst of May; That he shall discouer
  the bottomelesse beds of the Sea; that hee shall raise vp the dead, and put
  Nature quite out of her course. But all these shall bee false and lying
  Prodigies▪ which shall be directed to a kind of vaine and deceitfull
  admiration. In prodigus, &amp; signis mendacibus (as Saint
  Paul hath it.) So in like manner, the Hypocrite lyeth, with his
  countenance, his eyes, his feet, his hands, his mouth, and his apparell.
  Vendi
                        •
                      fumum (sayth
  Chrysologus) &amp; emit applausum, Hee selleth smoake, and bu
                        •
                     es the applause and acclamation of
  men. Our Sauiour Christ was those waters of Shiloa, which did runne
  silently along, and did quench the thirst of  those that
  were ready to die through drought. Which was meant of our Sauiour, as
  Epiphanius hath it in his exposition vpon that place of
  Esay,
                  
                     Esay 8. 
                  Pro eo quod
  abiecit populus iste aquas Siloe, quae currunt cum silentio, Because this
  people hath refused the waters of Shiloh, that runne softly; now therefore,
  &amp;c. He was that tree of Life, whose verie leafes did affoord health to
  all those that were vnder the shaddow thereof. And peraduenture these Pharisees
  did require signes from Heauen, because by that benefit which the people did
  receiue by his miracles here on earth, he carried all the world after him.
               
                  We would haue a signe from heauen. What, after so many
  miracles? These Pharisees are the stampe and figure of certaine Consciences,
  which haue a continual conflict within themselues; or, to speake more properly,
  they are a Chancerie consisting of Iudges, guiltie persons, and Pleaders,
  Inuicem se accusantium, &amp; defendentium, (as Saint Paul
  tels vs) Accusing and excusing one another:
                     Rom. 2 Reason is the Iudge, Selfe-will is the
  guiltie person, and the Pleader is that Worme which accuseth and gnaweth their
  conscience. And when the guiltie person seeth that the Pleader accuseth him,
  and that the Iudge condemnes him, though miracles doe abound, yet hee appealeth
  to some other miracle; like vnto a bad debtour, who when his time of payment is
  come, craues a longer day. One findes himselfe at Death's doore, and sees that
  he is like to die, and that in all likelihood he is to goe to Hell, for that
  his ill gotten wealth condemnes him; hee weeps, cries out, makes grieuous
  lamentation, purposeth, promiseth, and resolueth to amend his life, and to make
  restitution: God heares him, giues him life and health; and when he sees that
  he is sound &amp; well, and that his Pleader presseth him to make restitution,
  he appeales to another miracle. Another findes, that he hath slipt a thousand
  times, vpon this or that occasion; he knowes his owne weakenesse, and that he
  cannot looke, but he must lust; and purposing without any ill intention in the
  world, to entertaine honest conuersation with this and that woman, returnes
  too day like the Swine, againe to his mire; and too morrow appeales to another
  miracle. Saint Austen reports in his Confessions, That hee
  had a great conflict within himselfe; his Will had a purpose to leaue these
  human delights and pastimes; and when the day of his purpose and promise was
  come, this Pleader puts him in mind of it, but he appeales to another day. This
  then was a great part of this peoples fault, that they did complaine, That God
  did not deale so kindly with them as he was woont, We haue not seene our
  signes, there is now no Prophet. The greatest of all the Prophets that
  euer were, or shall bee, came amongst them, and did more miracles than all of
  them put together; and when they should haue confest themselues to haue beene
  conuicted with so many miracles, they appeale to another miracle. The Pharisee
  which inuited our Sauiour, tooke him to be no Prophet, because he did not diue
  into the depth of that loathsome and sinnefull brest of Marie
  Magdalen: If (thought he) hee were a Prophet, hee could not chuse but know
  what kind of woman this was. But finding afterwards, that he knew
  Magdalens heart, and that his own did not beleeue he was a Prophet, he
  appealed to another miracle.
               
                  We would see a signe, &amp;c. To what end serue
  miracles from Heauen, if thou hast not eyes to behold those that are done on
  earth? It were better for thee, to craue eyes of God, than miracles.
  Agar beeing readie to die for thirst in the Desert, shee had water
  iust before her; but she was so blinded with passion, and her stomacke did so
  swell against her mistresse, that shee did not see it: And God opened her
  eyes. Saint Chrysostome compareth the Pharisees to a sandie
  ground, which though it sucke in neuer so much water, yet it still remaines
  hard and drie. And  albeit God had showred downe such
  store of miracles vpon them, yet all was as nothing, because they were not
  disposed to take notice of them, nor to make that good vse of them as they
  ought to haue done. Hee that goes on his way, musing on this or t'other thing;
  though many passe along by him, yet in this his melancholly humour, his
  thoughts being otherwise taken vp, he neither mindes nor sees any thing.
  Philon compares them to Statua's, because they see things as though
  they saw them not.The nature of Christs Miracles. Two
  qualities or especiall properties had those miracles of our Sauiour Christ, by
  which euerie man might haue knowne them. The first, That they all tended to the
  profit and benefit of man; Tunc apperientur oculi caecorum, Then shall the
  eyes of the blind be opened, said Esay. Caeci vident, Claudi ambulant,
  Leprosi mundantur, The Blind see, the Lame walke, and the Lepers are
  clensed, saith Saint Mathew. Virtus de illo exibat, &amp; sanabat
  omnes, Vertue went out of him, and healed all, saith Saint Luke.
  And in our Creed we confesse, Propter nos, &amp; propter nostram salutem,
  descendit de Coelis, For vs, and for our saluation, hee descended from
  Heauen. So that those miracles which hee was to shew heere vpon earth, is
  a condition and qualitie so notorious of those which were prophecied and
  foretold of the Messias, that to haue them to come from Heauen, was a thing
  vnknowne to the learned Doctors of those times. Thou sendest thy seruant on an
  errand, and saist vnto him, In such a walke thou shalt meet with a man clad in
  greene, wearing a hat with a feather in it of such and such colours, &amp;c.
  Now if he should so farre mistake himselfe, as to goe to one that were cloathed
  all in blacke, and deliuer thy message vnto him, wouldst thou not hold him to
  be a foole? Saint Austen in his Exposition vpon those words of the
  seuentieseuenth Psalme,
                  The difference betwixt
 Christs miracles, and the Deuills. 
                  Immissiones per Angelos
  malos, saith, That commonly those signes which direct themselues to ill,
  are of the Deuill, as those which hee did in destroying Iobs
  Substance, [Ignis de Coelo cecidit;] as also those which shall bee
  wrought by Antechrist. But God alwaies directs his miracles to our good.
               
                  Those of Christ aime at our
 Good.But here by the way it is to be noted, That with the Ill, Ill can
  doe much, and Good, little. Theodoret in those his Questions vpon
  Genesis, saith, That when Pharaoh perceiued, that God began
  his Plagues with such poore things as Flies, he lost a great part of that feare
  which he had before: but that if he had begun where he left, (which was the
  death of al the first born) his heart would haue trē
                  bled in his breast. The
  Philistines tooke Armes against the Israelites, thinking with themselues, That
  God had spent the greatest part of his power in Aegypt. In a word, with the
  Ill, ill is most powerfull. And, for all the miracles of our Sauiour Christ
  were directed vnto good,Mans wantounesse in matter of
 Religion. Saint Ambrose saith, Luuriabantur i
                        •
                      Christo; Nothing would please
  their palate, but daintie morcells, like little children who are cockered vp
  vnder their mothers wing: or like Gluttons, who when their bellies are full,
  and cloyed with ordinarie dishes, seeke after nicer and choicer fare, to
  prouoke their appetite. The Scribes and Pharisees in like manner hauing taken a
  surfet of those miracles which our Sauior wrought vpo
                     •
                   earth, would needs out of daintinesse desire miracles
  from Heauen: which, if they would haue beene bettered by them, he would not
  haue stucke with them, to haue let them had them either from Heauen or Hell;
  but hee knew it was to no purpose.
               And therefore God, one while as the Authour of Nature, another
  while as the Authour of Grace, doth euermore abhorre all excesse, except in
  cases of necessitie. And he that created all things, In pondere, numero,
  &amp; mensura, In weigh
                        •
                     , number,
  and measure, cannot but abhorre all superfluous and vnprofitable things.
  And this may serue for an instruction to vs, to part with the superfluities of
  our  House: Quod superest date pauperibus, Giue the
  remainder of that which is left to the poore. King Achaz
                  
                     •
                  id ill, for that he would not aske
  a signe; and the Pharisees did worse, in demanding one from Heauen; the one
  offended in the lesse, the other, in the more; the one was too backeward, the
  other, too forward. For God hauing descended downe from Heauen in his owne
  person, they could not, than this, desire a greater miracle. But they were the
  sonnes of those fathers, who enioying the bread of Angells, were quickely
  wearie of it, and long'd for Quailes; insomuch that God was forced to take away
  their liues from them, because he knew not how to satisfie their longings.
               The second qualitie and propertie of our Sauiours miracles
  was,They are done imparitiuely and with a kind of
 empire and cōmand. That he did them with Empire and command; &amp;
  ioyning this his Empire with his doctrine, they did cleerely prooue, that he
  was God, as it is noted by Thomas. Saint Chrysostome brings
  in here a comparison which makes much to the purpose that wee haue in hand:
  Thou entrest (saith he) into a Pallace, thou knowest not the Prince or Lord
  thereof; thou espiest one, before whom all the rest stand bare, and rising vp
  from their seats, obey whatsoeuer hee commandeth: Now when thou seest this,
  thou canst not be so simple, but thou must needs know that this is their king
  and chiefe commander. In the Iewes it was not much, that they should doubt
  whither our Sauior Christ were Lord of heauen &amp; earth, or no; but when they
  saw that the Winds did obey him, the Waues, the Dead, the Liuing, Heauen, and
  Earth, and that he did command all creatures with that supreame power and
  Empire, they might then verie well haue fallen into this reckoning, as to say,
  This is the Lord of all. The Centurions, though they had no learning, yet did
  they light vpon this truth, Verè Filius Dei erat iste, This was
  truly the Sonne of God. The one of them led thereunto, when he saw in what
  a strange manner the whole world was troubled: The other, when in good manners,
  with a Domine, Noli vexari, Lord, Trouble not thy selfe, he seemed
  loath to giue our Sauiour that trouble; saying vnto him, I am but a poore
  Captaine, an ordinarie Commander, and yet when I lay my commandment vpon my
  seruants, they obey me; much more reason then is it, that sickenesse should be
  subiect to thy Empire, &amp;c. And if the inuisible things of God are
  manifested by the visible, [Sempiterna quoque virtus &amp; diuinitas]
  and that they which may know him by them, will not glorifie him in them, they
  shall remaine inexcusable. This was the Scribes and Pharisees case, who saw so
  many miracles with their owne eyes, &amp;c.
               
                  Volumus à te signum de Coelo videre, Wee woul
                        •
                      see a signe from Heauen.
                  Why miracles should be desired. Here likewise is their
  vaine curiositie to be condemned: Some would haue miracles, vt
  credant; some, vt videant; one, to strengthen his beleefe;
  another, to please his eye. In both Lawes, the Old, and the New, wee find that
  God did euermore with his friends shew those his signes and tokens, In
  rebus naturalibus, In things that were naturall; as in his sending down
  fire from Heauen vpon Abels Sacrifice, shewing thereby how well he
  accepted of it; in his promise to Noah, That there should not be a
  second Floud; Arcum meum ponam in Nubibus, I will put my Bow in the
  Clouds: To Abraham, when he past his word vnto him, That his
  posteritie should possesse the promised Land. In the old Testament we read of
  many signes and tokens: King Ahaz might haue made his choice of
  miracles,More frequent in the time of Grace than vnder the
 Law. Marke 8. either from Heauen, Earth, or Hell. But in the
  Law of Grace they were more in number, and greater in qualitie. But hese
  Pharisees comming vnto him, Saint Marke tells vs, That our Sauiour
  Christ sighed deepely in his Spirit, and said, Why doth this ge
                        •
                     neration seeke a signe &amp;c.
  They do
                     •
                   not deserue it, neither
  shall it be giuen vnto them; for they doe not desire it for any loue to our
  Sauiour, or thereby to bee  brought to serue him, but for
  to entertaine themselues. A royall Merchant wil vnpacke all his wares, &amp;
  open whatsoeuer he hath in his shop, to him that comes to buy; but to him that
  shall come only out of curiositie, he will send him away packing,
                     Luke 23. and not trouble himselfe with him.
  Herod did expect Videre signum aliquod ab eo fieri, To see some
  signe wrought by him. And though our Sauiour might haue freed himselfe by
  any one miracle whatsoeuer, from a thousand calumnies and affronts; yet would
  he not bestow so much as a few words vpon him, for he knew it would haue beene
  but a casting of Pearles amongst Swine.1. Kings
 6. The Philistines did much desire to know, whither or no the God of
  Israell were the Author of their miseries; and by the aduice and councell of
  their Soothsayers, they made a new Cart, and taking two milch Kyne, on whom
  there had neuer come any yoke, tying the Kyne to the Cart, and setting the
  Arke of the Testament thereupon, they said, If they go fore-right, vp by the
  way of it's owne coast, to Bethshemish, it is he that did vs this great euill;
  but if not, and that they shall turne backe their heads at the lowing of their
  Calfes, wee shall know then that it was not his hand that smote vs, but it was
  a chance that hapned vnto vs. The Gouernours of the Philistines followed after
  them, they beheld with their owne eyes all the signes and tokens that they
  could desire; they were astonished thereat, yet for all this did they not
  forsake their Dagon; for they desired those signes more to see, than to
  beleeue. Saint Paul preaching in Athens, of our Sauiors Death and
  Resurrection; those that were the best Disputants in their Schooles, and the
  curiousest Schollers amongst them, came vnto him and told him, Wee much desire
  to heare and know this new Doctrine which thou preachest:
                     Acts 17. And it is noted in the Text, That Ad
  nihil aliud vacabant, nisi aut dicere, aut audire aliquid noui, That they gaue
  themselues to nothing else, but either to tell or to heare some newes;
  desiring (as it should seeme) to heare and know them, but not to beleeue them.
  Of this stampe are those who onely come to Sermons for curiositie;Curious hearers reproued. some gaping for sharpe and
  wittie conceits; others, for elegancie of words; others, for the flower and
  creame (as it were) of the Scripture phrase, and it's prettie allusions and
  allegories; this is that which their eares itch after; nothing will down with
  them but quelques-choses, made dishes, and pleasing sauces for the Palate,
  refusing that wholesome food of Gods Word, and those substantiall morcells of
  sound Doctrine, which should feed their soules to euerlasting life. A
  veritate quidem auditum auertent. Saint Austen makes a comparison
  of a golden Key which opens ill, and of one of wood which opens well: Now to
  him that hath no other pretension but to open, it were meere follie in him, to
  seeke after the golden one, when that of wood will doe it better. And in
  another place, saith this sacred Doctor, That as Pharaoh commanded the
  male children of Gods People to be killed, but spared the females, that he
  might thereby weaken them, and bring them vnder; so those Preachers which
  bestow all their paines in the neat dressing of words,Sermons should be seasoned more with Salt, than Sugar.
  ornaments of wit, and fluentnesse of stile, (not regarding strong arguments,
  and sound reasons) doe weaken the force of the truth, and bring their Doctrine
  at last into contempt. Salt in a Preacher is more necessary than Sugar; that
  which shall season our Soules, rather than that which shal sweeten our
  Palates; that which shall strike home to our hearts, than that which shall
  onely tickle our eares. And in another place, where he that treateth onely
  ofcuriositie in Doctrine, he auowes him to be in danger of loosing the Faith;
  because Curiositie is the Mother of Heresie. And likewise in another place hee
  saith, That that the curious man is like the scripulous man; and that the
  Accessorie is the Principall, and the Principall the Accessorie; Curiosus
  ea requiret, quae nihil  ad se pertinet, They afflict
  themselues with that which importeth them least. And if those that are
  scrupulous &amp; ful of doubts are condemned for fooles, of force it must
  follow, that those that are curious inquirers must weare the same Liuerie.
  Auerte oculos tuos à me, qui ipsi me auolar
                        •
                      fecerunt;

 6. If thou shalt goe about to behold God with a curious eye, God will
  flie away from thee, and thou shalt loose the sight of him. Another Translation
  hath it, Superuire fecerunt. When men stand staring on the Sunne, the
  Sunne then growes proud, and shewes his power, blinding those eyes that presse
  too neere vpon him: And the most of the greatest heresies and errors that haue
  growne and sprung vp in the Church, haue proceeded from mans too subtle search
  into Gods secrets. This prying of ours dazeleth the eyes of our vnderstanding,
  as it had here blinded the judgement of the Scribes and Pharisees.
               
                  Volumus signum de Coelo videre, Wee would see a signe from
  heauen. These Scribes and Pharisees are like vnto those, who condemning
  Gods prouidence, thinke with themselues, That God hath not ordained conuenient
  meanes to bring them to Heauen; and therefore goe about to ordaine new Lawes.
  Iustificata est Sapientia à fi
                        •
                     ijs suis, Wisedome is iusti
                        •
                     ied by her children: Our Sauiour Christ renders it
  Condemnata, Condemned; The ignorance of the childeren condemneth the
  wisedome of the father. There are some people in the world so querulous and
  complaining, that they will not sticke to taxe God, for hauing giuen them such
  an inclination, such an estate, such a wife, such parents; and say in their
  thoughts, o, if God had giuen me another nature, other noblenesse of birth,
  other more prosperous fortune, How sure should I haue made my saluation? O, if
  God would haue beene but pleased to haue shewed me some one miracle, or other;
  This is but a requiring of new signes, and a condemning of those which they
  haue receiued from the wisedome of God. Now the wisedome of God supposeth
  Faith; and Faith, Beleefe; [Oportet discentem credere, He that learneth
  must beleeue.] So that a heauenly wisedome supposeth a Faith from heauen.
  This is that light, wherewith in the beginning of the world God did dispell the
  darkenesse of the Deepe; this is that North-Starre, which discouereth vnto
  those that saile in the sea of this world, the Hauen of their happinesse; this
  is that Pillar, which to the children of Light, appeared light; to those of
  Darknesse, darke: it is that light which must shew you that cleere Sunne, the
  Son of God, which is light it selfe; in comparison of whose glorious light, the
  light of miracles is but like the glimpse of a candle.
               
                  Volumus à te signum videre, Wee would haue a signe
  from thee. This word à te, From thee, doth manifest their
  intention; which was, To reuiue the blasphemie which they had vented before;
  [In Belzebub Principe Daemoniorum,
                  The Nature of
 Enuie. 
                  eijcit Daemonia, In Bulzebub the Prince of Deuils, he casts
  out Deuils.] Wee desire to see a miracle done by thine owne proper power,
  performed without the helpe of another, whereof we haue beene jealous, in those
  thy miracles shewne vpon the Blinde, the Deafe, and the Dumbe. We presume, that
  of thy selfe thou canst do little; but by the Prince of Deuils, much. This was
  a diminishing of our Sauiors power, which is the nature of Enuie, flying, like
  the Eele, from the cleere water, and seeking after that which is troubled, and
  muddie. It was the fault of their forefathers, to lessen Gods power,
  Quoniam percussit petram, &amp; fluxerunt aquae, nunquid poterit Deus
  parare mensam in Deserto? Is it not all one for him, to take water out of
  the Rocke, and to giue vs bread? In this, his power shall be seene. We are like
  Martha's Chickens, we desire meat, &amp; they giue vs water. But
  ô ye fooles, doe not yee know, that the stone beeing strucken, sendeth
  forth fire, and not  water? And he that can giue you water
  out of a stone, is able to affoord you bread out of the Aire: But Enuie will
  draw Branne from the finest Floure. In a word, They were fully resolued not to
  beleeue in Christ, and yet they went seeking occasions to excuse their
  hardnesse of heart. They sought signes from heauen, which (as Saint
  Hierome hath well obserued) were more subiect to calumnie, and easier
  to be cauelled at; and yet on the other side they did seeke to diminish his
  power, and therefore they say, We would haue from thee, &amp;c.
               
               Of all that hath beene formerly said, I shall inferre this
  conclusion, and refer it to your Christian consideration; which is, That you
  would seeke after God with simplicitie and singlenesse of heart; In
  simplicitate cordis quaerite illum, (saith Wisedome) and then
  shalt thou alwaies find him propitious and fauourable vnto thee.

 2. In the Scribes and Pharisees God speakes vnto those sinnefull
  Christians who immitate them in their workes; and as the thunders and
  lightnings of a great Tempest, smiting and wounding the tops of Mountaines, of
  Pallaces, and of the tallest Cedars; Chrysologus saith, That they
  abate and correct the courages of the most desperate and prophanest persons:
  so, when our Sauior Christ did thunder out these his threatnings against the
  Pharisees, he sought thereby to reclaime his owne Flocke, to bring them within
  the Fold, and to saue those Sheepe which are readie to run astray, that they
  may not be vtterly lost.

  Christ neuer shewed himselfe more fierce and angrie, than now; neuer behaued
  himselfe more stoutly, or shewed more courage, than at this present. Presenting
  thereby vnto vs, that vpon iust occasions, the mildenesse of a Prince, and the
  meekenesse of a Prelate, may lawfully let the bed of his Patience (like that of
  the Riuer) rise and swell, euen to the ouerflowing of the bankes. He that
  knowes not sometimes how to reprehend, and that sharpely too, shall not onely
  neglect his owne dutie, but shall wrong others in suffering them to run on in
  their wickednesse without reproofe. That father knowes ill how to gouerne, who,
  when his children shall commit any grosse faults, shall, like old Ely,
  shew himselfe too milde, and out of a foolish pirtie, scarce controll them for
  it. That Preacher, knowes not what belongs to his calling, who when sinne
  growes once to an heigth, and men waxe shamelesse in committing euill, that
  doth not raise his hands and voice as high as Heauen, and lay Gods fearfull
  judgements before them. That Prince, who suffers his subiects to bee ouerbold
  and sawcie with him, giues them a tacite kind of libertie, to loose all respect
  and feare towards him. Quiescite ab homine, cuim Spiritus,
                  
                     Esay 2. 
                  in naribus est, Cease you from the man
  whose breath is in his nosthrils, for wherin is hee to be esteemed? This
  is as it were the Epiphonema of all that Chapter of Esay;
  Where, hauing Prophecied many greatnesses of the Messias, hee aduiseth the
  Iewes, That they deceiue not themselues with the frailtie of his person; for,
  though hee shall come in the forme of a seruant, yet he shall bee the true God.
  And therefore hee concludes that Chapter with this saying: Quiescite ergo
  ab homine, cuius Spiritus in naribus est. Consider therefore (deerely
  beloued) that I admonish you, and require you, that when these prophesies shall
  bee fulfilled, and goe on in their accomplishment, you take heed how you bee
  offended with that man, whose life consisteth in the breath of his nosthrills;
  it beeing in that  respect with our Sauiour, as with all
  other liuing creatures, howbeit in regard of his Diuinitie, He is high and
  mightie. In this sence, wee may also adde, that the nosthrills are the
  symbole of anger. And in the Spanish tongue, it is a vsuall phrase to say,
  Subirse el humo a las narizes, That the smoake went out at his
  nosthrils. And therefore it is sayd, Take heed of that man that hath his
  breath in his nosthrills. Whereby it is signified, That if hee should once
  grow angrie with vs, hee would quickely make an end of vs. There was neuer yet
  any Prophet in the World so holy, nor so soft-spirited, but that somtime or
  other he did breake foorth into anger. Esay, called the Gouernours of
  his people, The Princes of Sodome; Saint Iohn Baptist, stiles them

                  Generatio praua, atque exasperans. Moses, Generatio

                  pater tuus
  Amorrheus, &amp; mater tua Cethea, Thy ofspring is from the land of Canaan,
  thy Father was an Amorite, thy Mother a Hittite. All these places doe
  blazon foorth the ill race of that people. For, albeit the herencie of Vice and
  of Vertue, be not constringitiue, and that there is no such necessitie in
  it,Vertue is not Hereditarie. nor alwayes followes
  the order of Nature; (for wee see a Dwarfe, begot by a Gyant; a Hare of a
  Lyon:) nor likewise in the state of Grace; for of a holy Father, sometimes
  issues an vngracious Son, as Esau, of Isaac; and
  Absalon of Dauid; yet notwithstanding, if a man bee
  discended of a bad race, it is a miracle if hee prooue good. Arbor mala,
  non potest bonos fructus facere, An euill tree cannot bring foorth good
  fruit. The Spanish Prouerbe sayth, Bien aya, quien a los suyos
  parece, Gods blessing be with him, hee is so like his parents; hee suckt
  his goodnesse with his milke, hee inherited his Fathers vertues.
  Transgressorem ex vtero vocaui te, (sayth Esay) Thou hast
  beene a transgressor from the Wombe. Alenhornar, se hazen los panes tuertos,
  The loaues went away from their first setting into the Ouen. All this is
  included in these words, Generatio mala, An euill generation.
               
               
                  Adultera. Hee does not note them in this world for
  children that had beene begotten in adulterie (for this had beene their parents
  fault and not theirs.) And Aristotle sayth, Ab his, quae a natura
  insunt, nec laudamur, nec vituperamur, (i.) Whatsoeuer is naturally
  in vs, redounds neither to our praise nor dispraise. Both the ill, &amp;
  the well born do confesse, Ipse fecit nos, &amp; non ipsi nos, It is God
  that hath made vs, and not we our selues. For if it had beene in our
  choice to chuse our owne fathers,
                     Psal. 99.
  wee would haue beene all gentlemen.
               Two things, did our Sauiour here pretend to notifie vnto vs.
               1 The one, that they had degnerated from the vertue of
  their forefathers; and for this reason, Dauid calls them strange
  chldren;
                     Psal. 49. Psal. 143.
                  Filij alieni menti ti sunt mihi, filij alieni inueter ati sunt. And in
  another place, Libera me de manu filiorum alienorum, Deliuer mee out of the
  hands of strange children.
                  
                     Mat. 3. They
  did boast that they had Abraham to their father, Nos patrem
  habemus Abraham. But Christ giues them the lye, and tells them, Vos ex
  patre Diabolo estis; For the workes, the thoughts, and the desires, are
  not of Abraham, but the Deuill.
               2 The other, because they had married now the second time
  with Vntruth, and made a match with false gods, hauing diuorced from them the
  truth of the  true and euerliuing God. And for the better
  declaration of this Doctrine, it is to be noted,
               First, That the vnderstanding and the truth, haue a kind of
  marriage between them; Quae sibi sponsam mihi assumere sapientiam, I
  desired to marry hir, such loue had I vnto hir beauty. And one that
  Comments vpon these words, sayth, That from the Vnderstanding, and Truth, well
  vnstorstood, there doth grow a greater vnitie, than there doth arise from
  betweene the matter and the forme.
               Secondly, That betweene the Soule, and God, by the meanes of the
  Truth of Faith,
                     Os
                           •
                        . 2. there is another kind of spirituall marriage made,
  whereof Ose sayth, Desponsabo te mihi in fide, I will marrie thee
  vnto mee for euer, yea I wil marry thee vnto me in righteousnesse, and in
  iudgement, and in mercy, and in compassion. I will euen marrie thee (as if
  this were that wedding-ring, that made all sure) vnto mee in
  Faithfulnesse.

                        •
                     7. And this
  knot is knit so fast, that Saint Paul could say, He that cleaueth
  vnto God, is one spirit with him. And for that the people of the Iewes,
  had fallen some while into Heresie, another, into Idolatrie, falsely expounding
  the Law, and forsaking the Fath of God, to follow a Calfe, and Idols: whereof
  God taxes them euery foote in the Scriptures, stiling them adulterers, harlots
  children, workers of fornication; so here hee now sayth, Generatio
  adultera.
               
            
            
               
                  Mala &amp; adultera. Euill and adulterous.
               First, he sayes Mala, and then Adultera,
  Tearming them in the first place Ill, in the second, Adulterous. For the
  ordinarie way to loose faith, is an euill life. But as the vomitting vp of our
  meate, turneth sometime to our good: so is it now and then in the ridding of
  our stomacke of Vertue. And in this sence, Saint Ambrose sayd,
  Profuit mihi Domine quod peccaui, It was well for me ô Lord, that I
  sinned. For repentance may restore Grace, in a higher degree. But if this
  weakenesse, shall take such violent hold vpon vs, that wee shall fall once to
  vomiting of bloud, it will goe hard with vs, if not cost vs our liues. In like
  manner a sinner perseuering in his sinnes, comes at last to loose his Faith.
  And this is one of the seuerest punishments of Gods Iustice; Whereof
  Ieremy sayd, Peruenit gladius vsque ad animam.
                  Sin vndermineth the Soule by degrees. Whence Saint
  Ierome gathereth, that then the sword pierceth to the Soule, when
  there is no signe of life left in it. In your buildings, the first danger doth
  not consist in their sudden falling to ground, but they goe mouldring away by
  little and little, and decay by degrees: So likewise in this our Spiritual
  building, the first danger is not the losse of our Faith; nor our first
  demolishing, our falling into Heresies: but before we come to that, wee goe by
  little and little, first lessening, then loosing our vertues, and heaping sin
  vpon sin, till at last, Mole ruit sua, all comes tumbling down to our
  vtter destruction. Saint Paul doth much commend &amp; earnestly
  recommend vnto vs a good conscience;1. Tim.
 1. 
                  Quam quidem repellentes, naufragauerunt à fide,
  Faith grounded vpon an euill conscience, is like a house that is built vpon the
  sand, which when the waters rise, &amp; the winds blow,
                     Heb. 13. is suddenly throwne downe and carried
  away. Optimum est, gratia stabilire cor, It is an excellent thing, that the
  heart be established with grace; that when ye shall be set vpon with
  diuers and sundrie strange Doctrines, yee may stand immoouable, and not be
  shaken with euerie vaine blast of wind.
            
            
               Signum non dabitur eis, nisi signum Ionae.
               
                  Christs resurrection the greatest
 Miracle.
                  A signe shall not bee giuen them, but that of Ionus.
  Now Ionas his signe was the death and resurrection of our Sauiour:
  which Austen calls, Signum signorum, &amp; miraculum miraculorum,
  The signe of signes, and miracle of miracles. And hee that 
   will not benefit himself by that, What other miracle or
  signe can he expect shall doe him good? It is much greater than any other vpon
  earth, by how much the harder it is for one to come out of the heart of the
  earth, and to bee restored to life after he is once dead; a greater miracle by
  farre, than that of Ionas his being spewed out of the Whales bellie.
  And the said Saint prooueth, that our Sauiour Christ is God and man; man,
  because hee entred dead into the bowells of the earth; and God, because hee
  came forth from thence aliue. So that our Sauiour came to grant them much more
  than they desired: For if they desired miracles from Heauen, at our Sauiours
  death there appeared fearefull ones vnto them. Athanasius saith, That
  the Sunne was darkened, in token that all those great and noble acts which God
  had done, were eclipsed and darkened in this one of our Redemption.
  Theophilact saith, That our Sauiour after his Resurrection wrought no
  more miracles; for that to die and rise againe by his own proper power, was
  the vtmost both of his power and miracles. Iudaei signum petunt,
                  1. Cor. 1. 
                  &amp;c. The Iewes require a
  signe, the Graecians seeke after wisedome; but I preach vnto you the greatest
  Signe, and the greatest Wisedome in the world, to wit, Christ crucified.
  Eusebius Emisenus dwelleth much vpon Iacobs wrestling with
  the Angell, In which conflict Iacob remaining Victor, craueth a
  blessing of the Conquered. And this is mystically meant of our Sauiour, who
  representing himselfe in the shape of an Angell, shewed himselfe vpon the
  Crosse, tortured, torne, and ouercome; yet grew thereby more powerfull and more
  free hearted for to blesse the world.
               
                  No signe shall be giuen them. It is not without a
  mysterie, that our Sauior saith, No signe shall be giuen. For that
  signe of his death and resurrection, hee knew would profit them so little, that
  it was needlesse to giue them any at all. Christ treating of his bloud, saith
  by Saint Luke, Which for you,
                  
                     Luke 22.
 Math. 26. 
                  and for many shall bee poured out. And by
  Saint Mathew, Which shall be poured out for all. But many shall not
  take the benefit of this effusion of his bloud: Some did wash their stoles in
  the bloud of the Lambe: others said, Sanguis eius super nos, (id est)
  Let his bloud be vpon vs; accusing themselues herein, to bee guiltie
  of the shedding of his bloud. And amongst the Faithfull there are many, of whom
  Saint Paul saith, Reus erit corporis &amp; sanguinis Domini;
  who receiuing it vnworthily,1. Cor. 1
                        •
                     . shall remaine guiltie of this
  so pretious a Treasure. And in another place, That they shall incurre great
  punishment, which doe defile this bloud, Et sanguinem testamenti pollutum
  duxerit.
               
               
                  Signum non dabitur ei, nisi signum Ionae, No signe shal be
  giuen them but that of Ionas. For the miracle of Christs death and
  resurrection was not to bee denied to any. Saint Thomas protested,
  That he would not beleeue, vnlesse hee might see the prints of our Sauiours
  wounds; which being so strange a capitulation, and to outward seeming, so
  discourteous a proceeding, our Sauiour Christ yeelded vnto his request, and
  made towards him, and made shewe thereof vnto him; for the signes of our
  Sauiours death and Crosse were neuer yet denied to any.
                     Esay. 13. 
                  Esay saith, And in that
  day, the root of Ishai, which shall stand vp for a signe vnto the People, the
  Nations shall seeke vnto it, and his rest shall be glorious. The
  Septuagint, and Saint Hierome, read, Et qui stat, The root of
  Iesse; that is to say, Ille qui stat in signum populorum, congregabit
  profugos Israel &amp; dispersos Iuda, colligit à quatuor plagi
                        •
                      terra, He shall set vp a signe to the
  Nations, and assemble the dispersed of Israell, and gather the scattered of
  Iuda from all the foure corners of the world. Hee borrowes the metaphore
  from a militarie Ensigne, and saith, That Christ our Sauior that suffered on
  the Crosse, and died for our sinnes, and rose againe for our saluation, 
   shall gather together those that are dispersed through
  the foure corners of the earth. Which is all one with that of Saint
  Iohn, who said, That he was not only to die for his People, Sed
  vt Filios Dei qui dispersi erant, congregaret in vnum, But that he might gather
  together into one, the children of God that were dispersed: Into one, that
  is, into one Church by Faith.
               
                  Signum non dabitur, nisi signum Ionae. God did not
  graunt vnto them that which they desired;God doth not
 alwaies grant our desires, and why. for God will not be propitious in
  yeelding to our desires, when they are to turne to our owne hurt.
  Moses desired, that he might see his face, but God told him,
  Faciem meam, videre non poteris. Hee will not giue, what thou wilt
  demand, one while because it may cost thee thy life; another while, because God
  shall no sooner turne his back, but like the children of Israell, thou wilt
  presently fall adoring the golden Calfe. Saint Paul, did desire
  freedom from his fetters &amp; those torments which hee indured: But he was
  told, Thou knowest not what thou askest; for, Virtus, in infirmitate
  perficitur. In a word, God doth denie vs many things in his Mercie, which
  he will grant vnto vs in his Anger, as the imperfect Author noteth it.
            
            
               In corde terrae, tribus diebus, &amp; tribus noctibus.
               
                  In the Heart of the Earth, three days and three nights.
  Beda, and Euthimius, vnderstand by the Heart of the earth, the
  Sepulchre, or Graue of our Sauiour Christ. And many of our Commentators, make
  this exposition; though others misinterpreting it, inferre from thence, that
  our Sauiour Christ did not descend to the lower-most partes of the earth
  (contrarie to that of Saint Paul) denying that Article of our Faith,
  Descendit ad inferos. Now, in that he ascended, what is it (sayth the
  same Apostle) but that hee had also descended first into the lowest parts of
  the Earth?
                     Ephes. 4.9. yet those two
  interpretations may bee verie well accorded, forasmuch, as that the Bodie
  remained in the graue, and the Soule descended Vsque ad inferos. And
  for the better proofe hereof, it is to bee noted, that it is not spoken of any
  other that dyed, saue onely of our Sauiour, that hee was in the Heart of the
  Earth. Besides, it is an vsuall phrase amongst the Hebrewes, to call the Heart
  the middle part, borowing that metaphore from all other liuing creatures, who
  haue their heart placed in the midst of the bodie.
               
                  Tribus ditbus, &amp; tribus noctibus, Three dayes, and three
  nights. Our Sauiour Christ was buried about the sixth watch, in the
  Euening; and rose againe vpon Sunday morning. According to which account hee
  remaineed onely two nights in the graue. Saint Austen, S. Ierome,
  Beda, and Theophilact, say, That by the figure Sy
                        •
                     ecdoche they are to be taken for
  three nights and three dayes, taking the part for the whole. But peraduenture
  the plainer exposition will be this, that wee should vnderstand by three dayes
  and three nights, three naturall dayes, consisting of twentie fou
                     •
                  e houres apiece: it being an ordinarie
  phrase amongst the Iewes, to confound the day and the night, making them all
  one; as it appeareth in Genesis,
                  
                     Gen. 7.
 Exod. 24. Deut. 9. 1. Reg. 30.
 
                        •
                     . Reg. 19.
                  Exodus, Deutronomie, and in the booke of the Kings. For in
  very deed, our Sauiour Christ did not continue in the graue three nights, but
  abode there some part of three naturall dayes.
            
            
               Viri Niniuitae surgent in Iudicio.
               
                  The Men of Niniuie shall rise vp in judgement. Some
  interpret this threatning to be an effect of justice; others, of mercie: of
  justice, by charging this people with the repentance of Niniuie. No man will
  spare his enemie, if he can catch him vpon the hip: The Groome of the Stable
  that shall play the Rogue and the  Theefe with thee, thou
  wilt call him to a reckoning euen for his Curry-combe and his Apron, and
  afterwards turne him out of doores: But of a good Seruant, and one that hath
  beene faithfull vnto thee, thou wilt take no account at all, his honestie shall
  excuse him. O yee false Hypocrites, yee Scribes and Pharisees, Why would yee
  call vengeance vpon your selues, by saying, Let all the bloud of the
  Righteous come vpon vs; This will make yee pay at last, that which perhaps
  ye did not thinke yee did owe. To a Sinner, Omnia cooperantur in malum, All
  things turne to the worst; And therefore all creatures shall rise vp
  against these wicked and stiffe necked Iewes. The Heauens shall he call
  from aboue, and the earth, to iudge his People. The Scripture it selfe
  shall bring in euidence against them, for their ingratitude. The Oxe
  knoweth his Owner; To him that shall not acknowledge Christ and his
  Church, the Asse shall beare witnesse against him: [Et Asinus pr
                        •
                     sepe domini sui.] To him that
  shall despise the inspirations of Heauen, the Kyte shall accuse him; C
                        •
                     gnouit miluus tempus suum. To him
  that shall be carelesse of his eternall good, he shall be tit in the teeth with
  the Ant, Vade piger ad formicam. To him that is disobedient, the
  Historie of Ionas shall be alledged against him: but as the Whale
  swallowed Ionas, but sent him forth again without any harm done vnto
  him; so our Sauiour Christ was swallowed vp by the Earth, but not to his hurt:
  and both it and all the Elements acknowledged him to be their Lord and Master;
  which was more than the Pharisees would doe.
               To Saint Chrysostome, this threatning seemeth to be an
  effect of mercie. For, by proposing vnto them the example of Niniuie, he
  desires to draw them to repentance. It was another kind of threatning that God
  vsed towards his people, for worshipping the golden Calfe; Let me goe, that
  I may destroy them, and blot out their name. Theodoret is of opinion, That
  this was Gods great mercie towards them: For by that threatning, he set before
  Moses the wickednesse of the people; and did thereby aduise him, that
  he should make intercession for them, that he might not punish them in his
  wrath. After that generall deluge and inundation of waters which drowned the
  whole world, God did set a bow in heauen, and it may be he might haue tooke it
  in his hand, for to threaten the Earth; But Saint Ambrose hath noted,
  That to the end that the World should take it as a token of Gods mercie towards
  them, he made the points or ends of it to touch the earth, that the World might
  thereby be assured,
                     Gen. 9. That Gods Iustice
  would not shoot any more Arrowes downe from heauen. Tertullian
  treating vpon that place of the Apocalips, Repent, or else I wil come
  against thee shortly,
                  
                     Apoc. 2. 
                  and
  wil remooue thy Candlesticke out of his place, except thou amend; he
  saith, That so great is the goodnesse of God, that though hee might with a
  great deale of reason denie vs his mercie, he doth not only not deny it vs, but
  he threatneth vs, and also intreateth for vs, to the end that we may accept of
  this his mercie: for no father can be immagined to be halfe so pittifull as he
  is. Saint Austen crieth out, O Lord, what am I, that thou shouldst
  command me to loue thee? What am I, that thou shouldest be offended with me?
  And, Why doost thou threaten me with great miseries, if I doe not loue thee? I
  am much bound vnto thee for the one, but more for the other: In louing thee, I
  see how much I get by it; in threatning mee, I see how much reckoning thou
  makest of me. S. Ephrem discoursing of those of Niniuie, saith, That
  God had mercie of them, and that he forgaue them their sinnes, Et mendax
  potius haberi, quam crudelis t
                        •
                     dit,
  He would rather be held a lyar, than accounted
  
                        •
                     ruell.
                  How
 the Niniuites shall rise vp in iudgement against vs.
               
               
                  The men of Niniuie shall rise vp in judgement. Some
  Diuines grant, That the Niniuites in that generall judgement shall be Iudges
  ouer many that shall be condemned  by a judgement of
  comparison; so, a Niniuite shall condemne a Pharisee. He did credit a
  stranger, one that was spewed out of a whales mouth; one that had neuer wrought
  any miracles, nor had any prophecies in his fauour: but thou (proud Pharisee)
  didst not beleeue thy naturall Lord, whom his Doctrine, his miracles, heauen,
  and earth, had declared to be thy Messias, and thy God. This Niniuite fasted,
  put on sack cloath and ashes; but thou didst not lay aside thy delicacies and
  thy dainties. He made the Beasts of his house to fast; but thou didst not so
  much as will thy Seruants to abstaine. A Moore shall condemne (in a
  comparatiue kind of judgement) a bad Christian: This Moore entred into his
  Mesquitae with a great deale of respect &amp; reuerence, humbling himselfe on
  his knee to a thing of nothing; but thou prophanest my Temples, and blasphemest
  mee to my face. In a word, If the fruits of repentance weigh downe the ballance
  of eternall punishment, Why should we preferre temporall pleasures before
  eternall happinesse? but because those Iudges are in that day to sit,
  Sedebitis super Sedes duodecim; and the Accusers to stand face to
  face to the Accused, the sence thereof in this place shall not be ill
  vnderstood, if we shall say, That they shall condemne them by accusing them:
  for we likewise commonly say, That the Accuser condemneth him that is guiltie,
  when by his testimonie hee doth conuince him.
               
                  The greatnes of Niniue.
                  Viri
  Niniuitae. This Citie of Niniuie, Eusebius calls it, Eusebim;
  Herodotus, Ninus, for that it was bult by Ninus husband to
  Simiramis, stiled by another name, Assur. It was a Citie, not
  only the greatest in all the Kingdome of the Assyrians, but in the whole
  world. Moses giues it the name of great Citie, De terra inquit
  illa exiuit Assur, &amp; aedificauit Niniuem, haec est Ciuitas magna: It's
  greatnesse appeareth no lesse by that relation which the Prophet maketh of
  it,
                     Gen. 10. 
                  Itinere trium dierum;
  for the circuit of this Citie was a three dayes journey; and that there were in
  it onely of babes and sucklings, aboue a hundred and twenty thousand soules.
  The Histories make mention, That the walls thereof were a hundred foot broad,
  and were fenced with a hundred and twentie strong Towers: Sardanapalus
  was the last, &amp; thirtie eigth King of that Monarchie, it hauing continued
  a thousand three hundred and seuentie seuen yeares.
               
                  Ionas from whence
 descended.
                  Ionas (according to some Hebrewes) was the sonne of
  the woman of Sarepta, whom the Prophet Elias raised vp to life: his
  fathers name was Amithay, of the Tribe of Asser. But more
  probable is that of Saint Hierome and Saint Austen, That he
  was of the Tribe of Zabulon, his Countrie Geth, or Pher, the court of
  one of those Kings whom Ioshuah subdued and slew.
                     Iosh. 11.
               
               God commanded him to goe and preach at Niniuie; for out of his
  especiall prouidence he had alwayes a care to prouide a Light not onely for the
  Iews, but also for the Gentiles. And therefore Athanasius saith, That
  the Law of Moses was a generall Schoole for all the world; and that
  the Prophets wrought their Reuelations for all the Nations vnder the cope of
  Heauen; and that to this end, they went themselues abroad in person, and
  likewise sent their Bookes into diuers Kingdomes and Monarchies, as it
  appeareth by Esay, Ieremie, Ezechiel, Daniel, Amos, Sidrac, Misac,
  and Abednego: out of whose Prophecies, those Phylosophers that were
  Gentiles stole many sentences: namely those complainers on Gods prouidence are
  condemned, who crie out in hell, The Sun of vnderstanding rose not vnto vs.
  Theophilact saith, That God, being the Master of the Gentiles, after that
  he had by the light of the Gospel inlightned the world by his Sonne and his
  Apostles, and Disciples; he prooued thereby, that he was one and the selfe same
  God both of the Old and the New Testament.
            
            
               
               Quia ascendit malitia eius coram me.
               
                  For the malice thereof is come vp before me. That which
  thou art to preach vnto them, is, That their sinnes haue mightily mooued my
  patience. This is the office of a Prophet. To Esay God said,
  Declare vnto my People their iniquities.
                  
                     Esay 1. Hier. 1. To Ieremie, Behold,
  I haue put my words into thy mouth, that thou maist plucke vp, destroy,
  &amp;c. To Ezechiel, They whom I send thee to, are stiffe necked, and
  hard hearted. In a word, God did notifie this Obligation to all the
  Prophets; whereby all they are condemned, who place their end altogether in
  curiosities: This is to go about to seeke out for those that are thirstie,
  pretious waters, &amp; wines cooled with snow, and put into copper
  flaggons; Cold water for a thirstie Soule (as Salomon saith.
                     Prou. 25.) This is, to quench a fire that consumes
  a whole Citie, with bottles of Rosewater; it is a going about to open the
  doore of our breasts with a Key of Gold, when one of Yron (according to that of
  Saint Austen) is more necessarie: It is as if a Souldier should goe
  forth to warre with his head curiously combed and curled, with his Ierken
  perfumed, and other effoeminate gallantries. Like vnto these is that Prophet or
  Preacher, who with glorious words, flaunting phrases, idle curiosities, and
  smooth-filed eloquences, shall goe to fight the Lords quarell, against the
  worlds sinfull Monsters.
               That those of Niniuie were great and mightie sinners, it is
  prooued out of this word Malitia, which doth embrace all kind of
  sinnes; and much more inforced by that word Ascendit; for in the
  Scripture it is still taken for a great excesse. De cadaueribus ascendit
  faetor, The stinke shall come vp out of their bodies,
                  
                     Esay 34. 2. Kings 19. 
                  Esay saith
  it. Superbia tua (saith the booke of Kings) ascendit in
  aures meas, Come vp into my eares. And here he mentioneth all kind of
  wickednesse and abhomination; and this word Coram me, Before me,
  confirmeth as much: For when a sinne doth encrease to that heigth, that it
  ouertops the heauens, and that it comes to the sight of God, it is then so
  intollerable, that it is not to be endured.
            
            
               Surrexit Iomas, vt fugeret.
               
                  Ionas rose vp, that he might flie away. Rabbi Rinchi
  (an Hebrew Doctor) saith, That Fugere doth here inferre, an
  acceleration, or making of hast; intimating, that Ionas made hast in
  going to the Hauen at Tharsis, to take his journie towards Niniuie: as also,
  that the Prophet to whom God speaketh,Reasons mouing Ionas
 to flie. is so great with child, as it were, and so full of that which
  God commaunds him, that if hee should withhold the reuelation which God hath
  put into him, hee would burst with keeping it in. That may be said of him,
  which Iob speaketh of himselfe, My bellie is like the wine which
  worketh and hath no vent; and like the new bottles that burst; Therefore will
  I speake, that I may take breath, &amp;c. Ose complaineth, and did
  sorrow exceedingly, that he had held his peace; Woe is me, that hauing
  seene the King and Lord of Hosts, I should hold my peace, because I was a man
  of polluted lips.
               
               
                  Ionas rose vp that he might flie. More plaine is that
  opinion of Saint Hierome, Nazianzen, Theodoret, Theophilact, and
  Methodius the Martyr, That Ionas was not so hastie as here
  before we haue made him; but that he pretended nothing lesse, but sought by all
  meanes possible, how he might auoyd this journey, and closely conueis his bodie
  (as it were) from this command of God, by shaping his course another way.
  Whither it were of dislike, that God should passe ouer his fauors to the
  Gentiles, and that his owne Countrie should remaine disgraced and ruined; and
  albeit he happely knew this was to come to passe hereafter: yet hee 
   would not willingly haue seene it so to succeed in his
  time: or whither it were in point of honour in his owne person, thinking (if
  not foreknowing) that God being so mercifull, that he would pardon the
  Niniuites vpon their first teares, he should then suffer in his reputation, and
  should be taken for a braine-sicke foole, and that he had exceeded his
  Commission, and so be mocked and laughed at for his labour.
               So that in the end he was fully resolued not to vndergoe the
  Embassage that was enioyned him; and therefore embarking himselfe, hee thought
  hee might then goe whither he wolud through the world. This is Saint
  Hieromes opinion, which the Chaldees Paraphrase doe likewise
  fauour. Surrexit vt fugeret ad Mare, antequam prophetaret in nomine Domini,
  He rose vp that he might flie vnto the sea, before he should prophecie in the
  name of the Lord.
               
               Some man wil doubt and say, How could so grosse an ignorance
  sinke into the Prophets brest, as to think to flie ou
                     •
                   of Gods reach? Confessing with Dauid that
  large extent of his power, Whither shall I goe from thy Spirit? and whither
  shall I flie from thy face? if I climbe vp into Heauen, thou art there; if I
  goe into Hell, thou art likewise there. I answer, That hee had no such
  kind of conceit in the world, nor any so foule a thought once entered into his
  immagination: But that which he presumed vpon, was, That in the land of the
  Gentiles, God would not reueale himselfe, nor communicate the Spirit of
  Prophecie to his Prophets; and therefore hee was minded to alter his former
  condition of life, and turne Merchant: For Tharsis was so famous a Port, in
  regard of the great concourse of Trading that was there, that those your great
  &amp; huge merchants ships, made onely for burden, were called in the
  Scripture, by an Antonomasia, or pronomination,
                     Ier. 10. Ezech. 27.
 
                        •
                     . Kings 11. 2.
 Chron. 9. Esay 50. 
                  The Ships of Tharshish;
  whereof Ieremie maketh mention, Ezechiel, the third third
  booke of the Kings, and the second of Chronicles. The Spirit
  of Prophecie (it seemed) had not then captiuated his wil: The Lord God hath
  opened myne eare, and I was not rebellious, neither turned I backe: But
  might he then if he would? So doth this Ego non contradico seem to
  inferre. Saint Paul saith to those of Corinth, That the Spirit of
  Prophecie is subiect to the Prophets. And as Amasias said to the
  Prophet Amos,
                  
                     Amos 7.12. Get thee to
  the Land of Iuda, ô thou Seer, goe, flie thou thither, and there eat thy
  bread, and prophecie there: but prophecie no more at Betheb, for it is the
  Kings Chappell, and it is the Kings Court. Ionas therefore
  seeing,The Deuills tyranny ouer his followers. that a
  Prophet was not accepted of in his owne Countrie, would needs turne
  Merchant.
               He got him into a Ship of the Phoenicians, to flie into
  Tharshish from the presence of the Lord; Et dedit illis naulum, And he paid
  the fare thereof, and went downe into it. For the Deuill is not contented
  that a sinner should doe him seruice onely, but that he should giue him money
  also into the bargaine; which is a strange kind of tyrannie.
               The Shippe had scarce beene a while vnder saile, when as a
  fearefull Tempest arose, which put those that were in the Shippe into extreame
  perill of their life. And albeit your Pilots, your Mariners, and Shippe-boyes,
  that are beaten and accustomed to these kind of chances, vsually loose all
  feare both of windes and waues, nay also of God himselfe; yet now, such was the
  tempestuousnesse of the weather, &amp; the raging of the Sea, that they called
  vpon those their gods which were painted in their Ship; Timuerunt nautae,
  The Mariners feare encreased, iudging this Storme the strangest as euer
  they saw, accounting it as a miracle.
               First of all, Because there was no preceding signe of it; for
  those that are experienced Seafaring men, are not onely skilled in knowing
  those signes of a  storme that are neere at hand, but
  those that are afarre off; as by the irruptions of the aire, which breaking
  forth from the concauities and hollow vaults of the Deepe, trouble the waters;
  the colluctation and wrestling of the winds, the croking of Rauens, the
  bellowing of Beasts, the playing of Porpeecies, which doe whisper in their
  eares the storme that is to come vpon them. But this Tempest here came so
  violently vpon them on the sudden, that there was no foregoing signe to
  foreshew it.
               Secondly, Because (as Rabbi Salomon hath noted it, an
  Hebrew Doctor, from whom Theodoret and Theophilact had it)
  there were many ships that had gone out of Tharshish, which they might kenne
  not farre from them, that had verie faire and cleere weather, and sailed away
  smoothly, hauing (as they say) a Ladies passage, so calme was the Sea, and so
  gentle and temperate their gale of wind. Whereupon they did discreetly argue
  amongst themselues, that there was some great and notorious sinner in their
  Ship, against whom the windes and the waues (by Gods especiall appointment)
  made such cruell warre. He that goes to sea, goes in danger, Qui nauigant
  mare, &amp;c. Euripides was of opinion, That they could not be truly said
  to bee either dead or aliue; not dead, because they liue; not aliue, because
  there was only a poore planke betwixt their death and their life. And the
  Sinner haleth his halter after him, and if God did not defend him, the Sea
  would not endure him. The Slaue that flies from his Master, all the seruants of
  the house make hue and crie after him; they follow him, crying, Stop him, stop
  him: and if that will not serue the turne, his Master sends Horsemen after him,
  who pursue him, and apprehend him. All the whole house of Heauen make hue and
  crie after Ionas, Angells, Saints, Friends, holy inspirations, make
  pursuit after him, as they vse to doe after other rebellious sinners: But that
  will not serue the turn; whereupon he sends these his Horsmen after him, the
  winds, the waues, the ship-boyes, and mariners; they take him and cast him into
  the dungeon of the Whales bellie.
               
                  Miserunt vasa, They cast forth their Vessels, &amp;c.
  This word Vasa is taken for the wares, the weapons, the Masts, the
  sailes, and other instruments belonging to a Ship; Vasa Domus, Vasa
  Bellica, Vasa Nauis, and the like. In that Tempest which Saint
  Luke mentioneth in the Acts of the Apostles, wherein Saint
  Paul suffered so many dayes, he saith,
                     Acts
 17. That the verie cords and tacklings in the ship were cast ouer boord,
  Armamenta Nauis proiecerunt: So now, whither it were to lighten the
  Ship, or to appease the anger of their Gods, whom they thought were to be
  appeased with gifts, or that they were subiect to these passions of choller and
  couetousnesse, &amp;c. And as now the Faithfull haue recourse in their
  shipwracks to prayers and promises; so was it now with these Infidels, and not
  to this alone, but to the offering vp of Iewells of great price and value.
               
                  Ionas was got him down into the bottome of the Ship;
  whither he had withdrawne himselfe thither out of his sorrow, or to auoid the
  noyse of their shreeks and out-cries, or for feare of the thunder &amp;
  lightning, or not to behold the furie and rage of the waues and the winds, I
  cannot tel you: but because feare and heauinesse commonly causeth sleepe,
  Ionas was fallen now so sound asleepe, that neither his owne proper
  perill, nor the lamentable clamours of others, could
  
                     •
                  wake him.
            
            
               Quid tu sopore deprimeris; Surge &amp; inuoca Deum
  tuum.
               
                  What meanest thou, ô Sleeper, awake and call vpon thy
  God. They that came down 
                     •
                  o
  the Pumpe, lighted vpon Ionas, and awaking him, said vnto him by way
  of  admiration, Is it possible that a man should sleepe in
  the middest of such a terrible Tempest? The cries and lamentations of all
  seeke to appease the furie of the winds, and doost thou sleepe? The Sea-Gods
  are affraid, and the Fishes retyre themselues into their holes in the deepe,
  and doost thou sleep? Arise for shame, and call vpon thy God, since others call
  vpon theirs. Whither it were that they did presume that Ionas was some
  Saint, (which they might gather from his modestie, and his Prophet-like
  attyre) or whither they had heard of the great wonders done by his God; (for
  many were the things that were spoken of him among the Gentiles, which were
  meruailous in their eyes) I leaue it to the construction of the Discreet.
               
                  Mittamu
                        •
                      sortes,
  Let vs cast lots. They whispered amongst themselues, That sure there was
  some notable villaine, some wicked person, among the passengers, for whose sake
  the gods had shewed themselues so angrie against this their ship, and those
  that went in her; for one euil man that is vpheld and maintained in his lewd
  courses, and is fauoured and protected by those with whom hee liues and
  conuerses, is able to destroy a Citie, and to corrupt a whole Commonaltie, if
  he bee not corrected and punished in time.
                     Ezech.
                     
                        •

  Ezechiel, Corrue

                      fulcientes
  Aegyptum, They also that maintaine Aegypt shall fall, and the pride of her
  power shall come downe. Euerie one then said to his companion, Let vs cast
  Lots, Et sciamus quare hoc malum sit nobis, That we may know for whose
  cause this euill is vpon vs; or (as the Hebrew hath it) In cuius nam
  hoc malum nobis, Let vs know who is in the fault why we doe all thus
  suffer. They therefore cast lots, not once alone, but againe and againe; for
  the Lot falling still vpon one, it was an especial effect of Gods prouidence,
  and a great token, that hee would discouer him tha
                     •
                   was faultie.
               It therefore falling still vpon Ionas, the Mariners and
  the rest that were in the ship, laid hands on him, and (as Saint
  Hierome hath noted it) made him this short, but discreet
  interrogation, What is thy occupation, and whence commest tho
                     •
                  
                  ▪ Which is thy Countrie, and of

  Prophet of his owne accord, without beeing

                   to the torment, confessed all
  vnto them: he told them he was an Hebrew, and that he sought to flie from the
  God of Israel, who had made the Sea and the
  
                     〈◊〉
                   Land; and that this was the
  cause of this their furious tempest, and fierce storme. Then said they vnto
  him, What shall we doe vnto thee, that the sea may be calme vnto vs? (for the
  sea wrought, and was troublous.)
               
                  Mittite me in mare, Take me and cast me into the sea, so
  shal the sea be calme vnto you: for I know,
                  Why Ionas
 would be cast into the Sea. 
                  that for my sake this great tempest is
  vpon you. This was no desperation in Ionas, nor any desire to
  hasten his owne death; but that he might not pers

  the more they stroue in rowing and in praying, the waues began to swell the
  more, and the winds grew stiffer and stiffer; Mare intumescebat super eos,
  The sea wrought exceeding high, and was troublous against them. Thereupon,
  they made a deuout prayer vnto God, entreating him that he would not impute
  vnto them the death of that Prophet: O Lord, (sayd they) thou hast made our
  armes the instruments of thy Iustice; and whereas it is thy pleasure, that wee
  should throw him into the Sea, thou mightest, if thou wouldst, haue giuen him
  some other kind of death: This iudgement which we execute vpon him, we haue
  done it out of his owne confession, &amp; by the casting of Lots; but if
  perchance we haue herein erred,In casting a man away, no
 delay too long. by taking away the life of the Innocent, permit not his
  bloud to be vpon our heads, since thou mayst so easily (if thou wilt) manifest
  his innocencie. Well might our Sauiour Christ condemne the Pharisees, by these
  poore Mariners and Ship-boyes, since they did demurre so much, and cast so many
  doubts with themselues, concerning the offence of a Fugitiue, that had alreadie
  confest himselfe faultie: Whereas these Scribes and Pharisees did rashly and
  inconsiderately sentence him to death, whom the Heauen and the Earth had
  pronounced and published to be innocent; crying out with a full mouth,
  Sanguis eius super nos.

  with a great deale of obsequiousnesse and honour, vpon their shoulders,
  because he had made so humble a confession, by acknowlegement of his fault,
  and for that, that he had thus voluntarily offered himselfe vp vnto death: They
  did reuerence him as a Saint, and lifting vp that weight in their armes, which
  the sea could not beare, they had scarce throwne him ouerboord, but the sea
  ceased from her raging, resting satisfied with this Sacrifice, and giuing it as
  a sure signe and token vnto them, that it did not pretend this it's furie, to
  any but Ionas. The Mariners after they had cast him into the Sea,
  sought (as an antient Doctor saith) to take him vp againe, and to saue his
  life; but then the waues began to rise and rage afresh, insomuch that they were
  forced to let him alone: it being a wonder, to see Seafaring men, who are
  generally pittilesse, to take such pittie and compassion of him.

               Gods prouidence had before hand prouided a Whale readie to

  about vnto the soule, the depth closed mee round about, and the weeds were

  sea on the one side with mountaines and valleys, Circumdedit illud
  terminis suis; and on the other side with sand, Posuit arenam
  terminum Maris. And as Ionas was shut vp in the Whales bellie, as
  in a prison; so was the Whale inclosed in that prison of the Sea. Nunquid
  Mare ego sum, aut Caete? Am I a Sea, or a Whale fish, that thou keepest
  mee in ward? Now if God had both before and behind, on this side, and that
  side, pitcht so many nets for Ionas, hee could ver

                  e hardly escape him, his flying could
  not saue him; but in this Whales maw, contrarie to all the lawes of Nature,
  God maintaines and preserues his life. If the stomacke of a Whale will digest
  an anchor of Yron, (as Tertullian tells vs) it must then of force
  consume Ionas; and if instead of aire, he drawes in water, he must
  necessarily be choaked. But he that deliuered Daniel from the hungrie
  mouths of Lyons, and those three children from the flames of the firie Furnace;
  it is not much, that hee should conserue Ionas in the deepest and
  darkest dungeon that euer liuing man was clapt vp in. The wonder was, that
  though himself were prisoner, yet he had left vnto him so free an
  vnderstanding, that hee was able to make so elegant an oration to God, out of
  so foule a Pulpit.
               The Prophet did dwell vpon this great miracle which God had vsed
  towards him, and did recouer so much strength and confidence, that he stucke
  not to say, Rursus videbo templum sanctum tuum, Yet will I looke againe
  toward thy holy temple, I liue in good hope, not onely to see my selfe
  freed out of this loathsome Gaole, but to humble my selfe on my knee in thy
  holy Temple, giuing thee thankes for the great mercie and fauour which thou
  hast shewed towards me: For the present I will make this sluttish corner my
  Oratorie, assuring my selfe, that from thence my prayers shall be acceptable
  vnto thee; who, like some great Prince or Monarch of the world, is respected in
  any place whatsoeuer of thy jurisdiction: so that there is no doubt, that any
  thy poorest vassall whatsoeuer, may bee heard by thee. The Children of Babylon
  were heard from the Furnace; Daniel from the Lyons Den; Iob
  from the Dunghill; Dauid from amiddest the Thornes and Bushes: And so
  I make no question but I shall be, from the bowells of this Beast, In omni
  loco dominationis eius, benedic anima mea Domino, O my soule, blesse the Lord
  in euerie place of his power.
               
               These three dayes Ionas spent in prayer, at the end
  whereof, God commanded the Whale to cast out Ionas vpon the Coast of
  Niniuy.In all aduersities our practice must be
 Prayer. And the Whale obaying his Empire, crost the Seas many Leagues,
  and there threw the Prophet forth vpon drie Land, though full of froathie
  slime, and vnctuous stuffe, free from the horror of that deepe and darkesome
  dungeon. From hence did the Gentiles faigne those their fabulous tales of
  Hercules beeing swallowed vp by another Whale; of Arion,
  playing on his harpe, riding on the backe of a Dolphine. For, (as it is noted
  by Clemens Alexandrinus, and Saint Basil) the Heathen
  Philosophers did steale these truths from vs; founding thereupon their
  falshoods: And giuing credit to their lyes, they did not beleeue our truths.
  Many of the Niniuites, comming downe to the shoare-side, were strucken with
  admiration, to see such a monstrous, strange, prodigious man; and the fame
  thereof flying to the Citie, before they were affrighted with the sad news that
  hee brought, they stood astonished at the strangenesse of the case; which
  questionlesse was a great cause; that they did afterwards harken vnto him, and
  giue creditto what he said. In the end, taking this for his Theame; Adhuc

   the ruine of the Citie, but also of the Towers, Walls,
  Pallaces, Citizens, Children, Women, and Old men, euen to the very beasts of
  the field; so great was the feare that entred into all their breasts, that
  without any further Miracles, laying their beleefe vpon the Prophet, they
  presently gaue beginning to that their great repentance, which was the
  strangest that euer was yet heard of.
               The King layd aside his purple roabes, and his rich and costly
  clothes, the throan of his Greatnesse &amp; Maiestie, and couered himselfe with
  sacke-cloth, and 
                     •
                  ate in ashes,
  causing his clothes of State to bee pulled downe, his walls of his pallace to
  be left naked of their hangings of cloth of Gold, and other peeces of Arras,
  beeing no lesse curious than glorious. For Sardanapalus, was one of
  the loosest, and most licentious men, that hee had not his like in all the
  World. The like did all the great Officers of his Pallace, the Princes, and
  Wealthyest men of his Citie, as also all the faire and beautifull Ladies. And
  there was a Proclamation presently made through all Niniuie, (by the Councell
  of the King, and his Nobles) with expresse charge, That neither man, nor beast,
  bullocke, nor sheep, should tast any thing, neither feed, nor drinke water;
  but that man and beast should put on sack-cloth, and cry mightily vnto God. To
  the end, that the bellowing of their bulls, the bleating of their sheepe &amp;
  goats, the howling of their dogs, the teares of their children, the sighes
  &amp; lamentations of their mothers, might mooue Heauen to take pitie of them.
  And aboue all, they did cry out most grieuously for their sinnes. For albeit,
  they are offences towards God, yet are they miseries vnto man; and as,
  quatenus peccata, so farre foorth as they are sinnes, they prouoke and
  stirre vp Gods Iustice against vs; So, quatenus, they are
  miseriae, as they are miseries vnto vs, they incline and mooue our
  good God to take mercie &amp; compassion of vs. The same reason which wrought
  God to destroy the World, the same likewise mooued him neuer to destroy it
  more. Cogitatio hominis prona est ad malum, Mans thoughts are pro

  considers it, as an offence vnto God; another while, as a miserie incident to
  man. The word Zagar, signifies Vociferatio, A crying out
  aloude,The Niniuites repentance. as when a Citie is
  set on fire, and in danger to be burnt. Some perhaps may conceiue that this
  was too strict a commaund, to inioyne this punishment vpon dumbe beasts, and
  poore little infants, that had not yet offended. But first of all, they did
  therein pretend to incline Gods mercy towards them. Secondly, to mooue the more
  repentance, by a common sorrow. Thirdly, as at the funeralls of Princes, and
  Generals, not onely the principall and meaner persons mourne in blackes, but
  their horses weare the like liuery of sorrow, their drummes beat hoarse,
  couered with blacke Cypres, their auncients are trailed along on the ground,
  their swords and their lances with their points the contrary way;
                     Gen. 6. Gen. 8. in token that both the
  horses, the drums, the auncients, and the armes, haue lost their Master: so
  likewise did the case stand with the Citie of Niniuie, &amp;c.
               
                  Ionas put Niniuie to such a strict penance, and sorrow
  for their sinnes, that it did appease the wrath of God towards them. The
  Prophet presumed it should be destroyed; and therefore Ionas went out
  of the Citie, and sate on the East side thereof, and there made him a booth,
  and sate vnder it in the shadow, till he might see what should bee done in the
  Citie. Thinking perhaps with himselfe, that God would not now make an end of
  the Citie all at once, but that he would destroy a great part thereof; as he
  did in the adoration of the golden Calfe, when as pardoning the people, hee
  slew a great number of them. Now God had prepared a Gourd for Ionas,
  and made it to come vp ouer him, that it might bee a

  head, and deliuer him from his griefe. Other Authors, giue it other names. But
  the strangenesse of it was, that it grew vp all in a day. The Prophet was
  exceeding glad to see himselfe so wel sheltred by this Gourd, from the heat of
  the Sunne, which did shrewdly scortch him; Laborauerat enim, It vexed him
  verie sore: So that before it went verie ill with him; and his ioy was so
  much the more encreased, for that he saw God had such a care to cherish and
  make much of him; Sure (thought he) he makes no small account of me, that vseth
  me thus kindly. But God shortly after prepared a worme, which smote the Gourd
  that it withered; Et percussit Sol super caput Iona, &amp; astuabat, The
  Sunne beat vpon the head of Ionas, and he fainted. Who could haue
  the patience to endure this? Was it the Sun, or was it fire, that should thus
  prouoke him to cry out, Melius est mihi mori, quam viuere, It is better
  for me to die than to liue. But God reprehended Ionas for this
  desperate speech of his; Putas ne bene irasceris Iona? How n
                        •
                     w Ionas, What's the matter
  with thee? Doost thou well to bee angrie for the Gourd? Doost thou find
  thy selfe grieued, that I haue made this Gourd to wither, which came vp in a
  night, and perished in a night; and wilt thou not suffer me to be sencible of
  the destruction of this so great a Citie, wherein there are sixescore thousand
  persons which cannot discerne betwixt the right hand and the left? Doth it
  touch thee, that thou art not esteemed in thine owne Countrie? And wilt thou
  not pittie Niniuie, whom thou hast drawne by thy preaching vnto them, to
  repentance? Niniuie yeelded vnto thee at the first words of thy voyce; but Iuda
  still stands out obstinately in her malice against my calling vpon her. And
  therefore at the day of judgement, the men of Niniuie shall condemne them for a
  stiffe necked generation, and a hard hearted People; seeing they without any
  miracles were conuerted, and turned vnto me at the preaching of one poore

  and vnbeleeuing Nation (which is a great disgrace to a man of honor) that one
  that is so farre inferiour to thee, should come to be so farre preferred
  before thee: As those Cities where most of our Sauiours great workes were
  done, were vpbraided by him, because they repented not; pronouncing a woe to

  it's fellow. For which cause, he sets downe another example of the Queen of the
  South, of whom there is mention made in the third of the Kings, and in
  the second of Chronicles.
                  1. Kings 10. 2.
 Chron. 9. The Queene of the South came from Morol, (an Isl
                     •••
                   of Aethyopia, as Origen,
  Saint Hierome, Saint Austen, Anselmus, and Iosephus,
  saith) and onely to heare the wisedome of Salomon; Et ecce,
  
                        〈◊〉
                      quam Salomon
  hîc, And behold a greater here than Salomon. It was much, that
  the barbarous people of Niniuie should beleeue Ionas, who sought after
  them, and not they after him: But much more is it, that an Aethyopian Queene
  should seeke after 
                     •
                   King, to hir
  so great trouble and cost. Ecce plus quam Salomon hîc. When the
  Preacher is of that great power and authoritie, that he both sayes and does;
  the little  fruit that they reap thereby, is euermore
  attributed to the hardnesse of the hearer. And that he might teach this People
  this lesson, he saith, Ecce, plus quam Salomon hîc, Behold,
  a greater than Salomon is here. He was greater than Ionas; for if
  he were obeyed by the Niniuites, our Sauiour had obeysance done him by all the
  Elements: if Ionas had a grace in his deliuerie, and spake with a
  spirit, it was our Sauiour that gaue it him: if Ionas did inlighten a
  Citie, our Sauiour did illuminate the whole world: if Ionas did
  preach bloud; threatnings, and death, our Sauiour did publish our saluation,
  life, and hope of Heauen. He was better than Salomon; for his wisedome
  was humane and earthly; but that of our Sauiour, diuine and heauenly:
  Salomon neuer wrought any miracles; but those of our Sauiour were
  without number. In a word, betweene the Queene of the South and the Pharisees,
  betweene our Sauiour and Salomon, there is a great antithesis and
  contrarietie: The Queene was a Barbarian, and ignorant; they, Doctours, and
  learned in the Lawes; she, wonderfull desirous to heare a man; they, loath to
  heare a God; she offered to Salomon great gifts; they to our Sauiour
  vinegar and gall; shee did so wonder at Salomons wisedome, that she
  said, Fame had belied him, and that Report came too short of his praise; but
  they made so slight account of our Sauiours words and workes, that they require
  new miracles at his hands: but this their cauelling with him, shal occasion
  their condemnation. To conclude, The principal things that Niniuie shal charge
  them with, are two.
               The first, The speedinesse of their repentance, and the hast
  that they made to turne vnto God: For (as Saint Chrysostome hath noted
  it) in three dayes Ionas effected that in Niniuie,Ionas effected more in three dayes then our Sauiour did in
 thirty yeares. Repentance, not to be deferred. which our Sauiour could
  not bring to passe in thirty yeres and vpward. Saint Ambrose, That
  they who deferre their repentance till the houre of their death, ought not to
  bee denied the Sacraments, if they desire them; but I dare not be so bold
  (saith the said Father) to warrant them their saluation. Rahab had
  scarce put the Spies out of her window, but that she presently hung out that
  coloured string, the token that was giuen her for the safeguard of her life.
  Philon takes into consideration, that exceeding great hast which the
  Aegyptians made to rid their Countrie of the children of Israell; they held it
  no wisedome, to deferre their departure one minute of an houre longer, (if they
  could so soone haue freed themselues from them) considering in what great
  danger they were of loosing their liues. Much lesse discretion is it, to defer
  the repentance of our sinnes from day to day, considering how dayly we are in
  perill of perishing in Hell.
               The second, The greatnesse, sharpenesse, and rigour of their
  Repentance, not onely in the men, but in the women, children, and cattell: They
  thought with themselues, That fortie dayes of sorow were too little, and too
  few for so many yeares of sinning; and therefore they did striue all that they
  could, that the extremitie of their punishment might make amends for that long
  time wherin they had offended. Lanabo per singulas noctes lectum meum,
  i. I will euerie night wash my Couch with my tears. Chrys. saith,
  Culpā fuisse vnius noctis, lachrimas multorum, That it was but one nights
  sinne, but many nights teares. Amplius laua me, O Lord, wash me yet a little
  more, that I may be cleane. Now was he clensed; but ill assured of this
  his cleannesse, &amp;c. For the washing out of the staines and spots of our
  sinnes, one la
                     ••
                  r, one rinsing, one
  bucking is not sufficient, no, though we haue neuer so much sope and ashes to
  scoure them cleane, and bear out our hearts vpon the blocke of our sencelesse
  soules: it must (ô Lord) be the water of that immense and mightie sea of
  thy Mercie; that, and nothing but that, can doe it. And therefore, Haue
  mercie vpon me, ô God, according to thy great mercie.

with a Deuill: And howbeit our Sauiour had taken the paines to come fiue and
twentie leagues for to heale that soule, (as one that well knew the price and
worth thereof) yet he gaue her so many shrewd disgraces and put-by's, that
would haue dismayed the stoutest spirit aliue, and haue cooled the courage of
him that had beene most confident of his strength. But this woman did not flag
a whit for all this, nor would bee so beaten off; but one while making vse of
the intercession of the Apostles; another while confessing herselfe to be no
better than a Dogge, and begging like a Dogge, not the bread it selfe, which
was for the children, but the crummes that fell from the

                  〈◊〉
               , which neuer yet was denied
vnto Dogges: she perseuered in her petition, laying such a strong and forcible
batterie to the pittie and mercie of Christ, that it being in it selfe
inuincible, yet it yeelded to a womans importunitie. Incouraging vs thereby,
and putting vs in good hope, that nothing shall be denied vnto vs,How Christ called, the hope of the Gentiles. if we shall
earnestly call vpon God, &amp; perseuer in the pursuit of our humble
petitions: And there is good cause of comfort for vs, Quoniam confirmata 
 est super nos misericordia eius, His mercie is confirmed
vnto vs, as well as his grace; whose effect is infallible, and most
certaine. And as a continuall feauer that is once confirmed and setled vpon vs,
is an assured messenger of death; so the mercie of God being once confirmed
vnto vs, it is not possible that it should euer faile vs.
            
               Egressus Iesus, secessit.
               Some doe apply this word to the Sonne of Gods comming foorth
  into the World; Some, to the strength and vertue which our humane nature
  recouered by this his comming. Which is all one with that of Saint
  Austen; if God had not beene Man, Man had not beene free. The
  Scripture calleth Christ our Sauiour, The desire &amp; hope of the Gentiles.
  And to him that shall doubt, How the Gentiles, not hauing knowledge of the Son
  of God, nor of his comming,
                     Ob.
                   could bee
  called their hope, and their desire?
               First of all, I answere; That amongst the Gentiles God had some
  friends,
                     Sol.
                   as the Sybils, and many which
  beleeued in him; In the land of Hus, he had Iob. And if it shall be
  obiected, That so small a number of the Gentiles,
                     Ob.
                   were not sufficient to giue a name and beeing
  of this their hope and desire?
               I must answere secondly, That all creatures did naturally
  desire,
                     Sol.
                   and long for him, as the dry
  ground doth gape for water;
                     Psal. 142. or as
  the captiue doth desire his libertie, Sicut terra sine aqua tibi.
               
               Thirdly, Saint Austen answeres, That the desired, ought
  first to bee knowne. But it is the fashion of the Prophets, to take
  Futurū, pro praeterito, The future, for the preterperfect Tence.
               
               And here it is to bee noted, That with Tyrus and Sydon, that
  happened vnto him in particular, which succeeded vnto him in the world in
  generall. He was long before offended with this Country as it appeareth in
  Ioel; Quid mihi,
                  
                     Ioel. 3.

  Sydon. In Ezechiel,

                  Tu ergo fili hominis assume lamentum super Tyrum, Now therefore ô

                     owle ye ships of
  the Sea. How then did God make peace with the World by his Sonne?
  Gratificauit nos in dilecto filio suo. And hee offered the like
  kindnesse vnto Tyrus and Sydon. Memor ero Rahab Babilonis: Ecce alienigeni,
  &amp; Tyrus hic fuerunt illic, &amp;c. I will thinke vpon Rahab, and Babilon,
  the Morians,
                  
                     Psal. 87. 
                  and them of
  Tyre, &amp;c.
               
               
                  Secessit in partes Tyri, &amp; Sydonis, Hee went into the
  Coasts of Tyre and Sydon. He taxes this his people of their vnthankefulnes
  towards him; For he, that doth not only not acknowledge a good turn, but
  requites it with il, shuts the gates of Heauen against his owne Soule. And
  therefore, Signum non dabiter ei
                        •
                     . Rupertus hath obserued, That the first fault that was
  committed in the World, was Ingratitude; For God hauing created Adam
  in a perfect age, and sound in his judgement, hauing, for his recreation giuen
  him Paradise, and for his authoritie, the Seigniorie of the World; yet did hee
  not giue him thankes for these his so great and many fauours towards him;
  whereupon the Deuill, (beeing a slye and subtill Merchant) tooke occasion to
  tempt him, persuading himselfe, That hee who had shewed himselfe ingratefull,
  would with a little labour bee easily brought to be disobedient. This Doctor
  doth soundly &amp; throughly ponder these words, Serpens erat callidior,
  The serpent was more subtill. Like a craftie Huntsman, hee waited but for
  a time, that Adam by his vnthankefulnes should fall into the toile,
  whence afterwards hee should not so easily get out. Saint Ambrose
  sayth, That  
                  Noah, all that while that hee was
  building the Arke, did not any thing, though neuer so little, without some
  especiall order from God; but as soone as hee was gone out of the Arke, without
  further expecting aduise from Heauen, hee did prepare and make readie his
  sacrifice. For, that a Soule should shew it selfe thankefull to it's God, it is
  not necessary, that it should stay waighting &amp; looking for reuelations; but
  rather hasten to expresse it as soone as it can, and to vse all preuention of
  being put in mind of it. And therfore in approbation of Noahs
  forwardnesse, the Text sayth, Odoratus est Dominus odorem suauitatis, The
  Lord smelled a sauour of rest.
                  
                     Gen. 8.
  And shewed himselfe so well pleased and appeased therwith that he sayd in his
  heart, he would thencefoorth curse the ground no more for mans cause.
               There is another circumstance, touching Ingratitude, which is
  very considerable, &amp; deserues our attention, which is this, That albeit
  God is woont sometimes to dissemble other faults, and lets them runne on many
  yeares before he wil punish them, yet the sins of vnthankefulnesse, he will not
  suffer them to scape vnpunished, no no
                     •
                   so much as to graunt them the forbearance of a few houres. God
  sayth in Leuiticus; Qui maledixerit Deo suo, portab
                        •
                     t peccatum suum, Whosoeuer shall curse his
  God,
                  
                     Leuit. 24▪
                   
                  or speake ill
  of him, shall beare his sin; no farther chastisement beeing there set
  downe for him. But hee that shall blaspheme the name of the Lord, Morte
  morietur, shall bee put to death: that is the Law. The second
  (questionlesse) is a lesser sinne than the former; And yet God dissembles the
  former, and will by no meanes indure the second. And the reason thereof
  (rendred by Thomas) is, That those names, and attributes of God, doe
  shut vp as it were, and comprehend in them those benefits which hee so
  liberally bestowes vpon vs; and for that the blasphemer showes himselfe so
  vngratefull vnto God, hee cannot hope for any pardon of his punishment. Our
  Sauiour Christ then seeing, that Iudea did draw poyson out of treacle, and
  vnthankefulnesse and hardnesse of heart, from the many fauours and mercies that
  hee had shewed towards them, Secessit in partes Tyri &amp; Sydonis, Went
  into the Coasts of Tyre and Sydon &amp;c.
               
            
            
               Ecce mulier Chananea.
               
                  The force of Prayer.Many, and great
  matters are spoken of the force and power of Prayer. Greeuous is that saying
  of God vnto Ieromie; Noli orare pro populo isto, neque assumes pro eis
  laudem &amp; orationem,
                  
                     Hier. 7.
                  &amp; non obsistas mihi, Thou shalt not pray for this people, neither lift
  vp cry or prayer for them, neither intreat mee, least I should heare thee, and
  so diuert mine anger. Seest thou not what they doe, &amp;c? Seeke not
  therefore to hinder me in executing my vengeance against them. None (sayth
  Iob) is able to resist the wrath of God. But God aduiseth vs, how
  powerfull a thing Prayer is for the appeasing of it,
                     Io
                           •
                        
                      9.
  by seeking to preuent the Prophet, by putting in this caueat, Non obsistas
  mihi, Resist mee not. Greeuous is that saying of God, vnto Moses,
  Desine, vt irascatur furor meus, Stand not betwixt mee and home, that I
  may destroy this people. O Lord, who can hold thy hand, when thou art willing
  to strike? Who, force thee against thy will, to be quiet? yes, The Prayer of
  such a friend as Moses, Orabat autem Moyses ad Dominum Deum suum.
  Beeing one, whom God so much respected. And as the loue of a friend doth tye
  the hands of some angry Lord, and keep him from striking; so Prayers binds Gods
  hands when hee is angry with vs, not suffering him to draw his sword. This was
  no small comfort to Dauid, which made him to sing the song of
  Thankesgiuing, Benedictus Deus, qui non amouit orationem meam, &amp;
  misericordiam suam à me, Blessed be God, who hath not remooued either my
  prayer, or his owne mercie from mee. Saint 
                  Austen saith, That as long as God shall not take from out our mouthes
  and our hearts our praying vnto him, so long we may be well assured that he
  will not remoue his mercie from vs, for he neuer denieth those that faithfully
  cal vpon him
               But a matter of great consideration is that which we haue here
  in hand, Ecce mulier Cananea, Behold a Canaanitish woman, &amp;c.
  What? a woman that is an Idolatresse, can shee bee of that power that shee
  should ouercome God by prayer? When a weake arme cuts a man off by the wast at
  a blow, or hewes a bar of yron in sunder, this act is not attributed so much to
  the force of his arme, as the goodnesse of his sword; so, this dayes noble act
  is not to bee attributed to a Pagan woman, (who was descended of that accursed
  Cham) but to the power of Prayer. To those three diuine persons,
  Prayers are not permitted: for, as Thomas noteth it, Prayer is to be
  directed to a superiour power: And if the Sonne of God did pray, it was
  according to his humanitie, hauing recourse (as Saint Ambrose saith)
  to those two obligations of Priest and Aduocate: And if (Saint Paul
  saith) that the holy Ghost doth pray, Postulat pro nobis gemitibus in
  enarrabilibus, He maketh request for vs with grones that are
  vnspeakeable: It was, that he might teach vs how to pray, as Saint
  Augustine expoundeth it. The Deuills, and those that are damned, are
  not capable of prayer: Albeit the couetous rich man did desire a drop of water
  of Abraham to coole his tongue, &amp; the Deuills entreated
  Christ,
                     Luke 16. that he would giue them
  leaue to enter into the Swine. For to pray vnto God, is to turne vnto God, and
  with a sorowfull soule, and a contrite heart, humbly and earnestly to call vpon
  him, crauing pardon for our sinnes. Prayer therefore onely belongs vnto men, as
  well the Iust, as the Sinner; and that the Prayer of the Iust should preuaile
  with God, which begges and entreats of his diuine Majestie, That he will beare
  with vs this yeare, and the next, and so from time to time (as is prooued by
  that Parable of the Figge tree, which the Lord of the Soyle caused to be hewne
  downe, because it bare no fruit) it is not much: But that the prayer of a
  Canaanitish woman should make God to yeeld vnto her, is more than much. The
  name of woman, in it's true and naturall element, notifieth a thousand
  imperfections: O pessima, &amp; Mulier, saith Euripides,
  signifying thereby, That there is no mischiefe which she is not a Midwife vnto;
  the verie name of a Canaanitish woman doth blab out sin in hir, hatred towards
  God, and a measure full of miserie. Now if a subiect so weake and so imperfect,
  grew by Prayer to be so powerfull; What will not Prayer be able to do?
  Salomon askes the question, Mulierem fortem quis inueniet? Who
  shall meet with a valiant woman, that is full of mettall and courage? I
  answer, That naturally such a one is Rara auis in terris, a verie
  Phoenix, a white Crow, and a blacke Swan; but by the force of Prayer you shall
  thrice meet with such a one: in Tyrus and Sydon God sayes no; and yet in the
  end, the Canaanitish womans Yea goes further than our Sauiours Nay; making
  God, as it were, to lay downe the Bucklers, and to yeeld vnto her. And to him
  that shall say, That this was a spirituall wrestling, neuer giuing ouer our
  Sauiour, but still pressing and importuning him more and more; and that a woman
  will be sometimes so earnest and so violent, that shee may as well wearie out
  God, as she doth Man, to make him yeeld ere she haue done with him: To this, a
  Doctor of our times verie well answers, by proposing another question; to wit,
  Whither Iacobs wrestling with God were with the force of his arms, or
  with the armes of Prayer? Origen tells vs, That it was a spirituall
  strugling of teares and prayers; and Iacob hauing got the better, God
  said vnto him, Thou shalt no more be called Iacob, but
  Israel, because thou hast had power with God. The like may be said by
  our Sauior to this Canaanitish woman.
               
                  
                  Ecce mulier Cananea, Behold a woman,
  &amp;c. Ecce, in holy Scripture commonly signifieth some great matter of
  admiration. And this case of the Canaanitish woman is admirable, for two rare
  circumstances contained in it.
               The one, For that strange change and alteration in her; in
  regard, that of a Canaanite in Occupatione, she became a Canaanite
  in Oratione, that is, a Negotiator in Heauen: for Cananea
  (according to Saint Hierome) is the same with Negotiatrix.
  Of a good huswife, that girdeth her loyns with strength, and strengthneth her
  armes, Salomon saith, Cingulum tradidit Cananeo; the Vulger
  hath it, Negotiatori,
                  
                     Prou. 31.
 Luke 19. 
                  To the Merchant, or one that negotiates
  businesses; and Heauen is stored with such kind of People: Negociamini dum
  venio, Occupie till I come. And so great was the hast which this Canaanite
  made for the encreasing of her Talent, and in mannaging of her businesse, that
  the Church sets her before vs for an example, and for an excellent and happie
  Negotiant with God himselfe. As Abraham was put for a patterne of
  Faith; Isaac, of Obedience; Ioseph, of Chastitie;
  Iob, of Patience; Marie Magdalen, of Repentance; so this
  Canaanitish woman is proposed vnto vs as an example of well negotiating with
  God, shewing vs the readie way for a quicke dispatch.
               The other, That a woman that was a Gentile should come out of
  Tyrus and Sydon,Vertue neuer more eminent, than when it
 shines among the Vicious. to be a Schoole to the Faithfull; as if a
  Moore should come from his Moorisme, to be a Christian, which is a rare thing,
  and seldome seene: that such a one should haue issued out of Ierusalem, that
  was well grounded in the Scripture and Religion, it was not much; but from
  Tyrus and Sydon it was not a thing to be expected. To be of the houshold of
  Faith among the Gentiles, a Catholick among Hereticks, a Christian among
  Moores, a Saint amongst the Wicked, was eue
                     •
                   yet accounted strange and wonderfull. Saint Gregorie
  obserues this of Iob, liuing in the Land of Hus among the Barbarians;
  Socius fuit Draconum, Frater Stru
                        •
                     hionum, He was a companion of Dragons, and a brother to
  Ostriches, that is, he liued amongst the Vngodly. And Saint
  Peter saith of Lot, That he being righteous,2. Pet. 
                     
                        •
                     . and dwelling among the Sodomites, in seeing the vncleanly
  conuersation of the Wicked, and hearing of their abhominable sinnes, vexed his
  righteous soule from day to day with their vnlawful deeds; which is a great
  crosse and affliction to the Godly. Saint Iohn saith of the Bishop of
  Pergamus, Scio vbi habitas, vbi se
                        •
                     es est Sathanae, &amp; tenes nomen meum, All thy actions are not
  praise-worthie; but this is greatly to be commended in thee, that amongst
  Deuills, where Sathan hath his Throne, thou keepest the faith, and confessest
  my name. Saint Paul, of the Philippians, That In medio
  nationis prauae. The Spouse, of his Beloued, That, Sicut Lilium inter
  spinas, without receiuing any harme. In a word, to enioy perfect health
  in the middest of a great plague, is a great matter; but much greater is it,
  that out of a Pesthouse one should come forth to giue helpe vnto others; that
  from amidst Heretickes a Master should be brought to teach Catholickes; and
  that out of Tyrus and Sydon should step forth a Canaanitish woman to instruct
  the Church. And this is that which this word Ecce aimes at.
            
            
               
                  A finibus illis egressa, Come from out those
  Borders.
               First, Christ; and then she: and though Christ had the longer
  and harder journey of it, and she the shorter and easier; yet you see shee was
  willing to put the best foot forward, and to take some paines her selfe in the
  businesse: she did not as many doe now adayes, sit still and doe nothing,
  laying the whole burthen of the justification vpon our Sauiour Christ.
  Supra dorsum meum (saith he, complaining by the Prophet)
  fabricauerunt peccatores, prolongauerunt iniquitatem sua
                        •
                     , 
                   They threw
  all the whole burthen of their sinnes vpon my shoulders, taking no care
  themselues to worke out their saluation. Beloued, this is not the way; it is
  not enough, that yee haue your calling and vocation from God, but you must make
  sure this your vocation vnto you by good workes, Satagite per bona opera
  certam facere vocationem vestram; It is not enough, that Christ hath
  redeemed you, but you must seeke on your part to secure your redemption. In
  this sence said Paul, Adimpleo quae desunt passionum Christi in carne
  mea: Not that any thing can be wanting to the passion of Christ, on his
  part, but on thine. Faine wouldst thou goe to Heauen, but thou art loath to
  take any paines to get thither; thou wouldst be carried vp in a soft and easie
  chaire, but art loath to stretch thy legs. And for this cause the Scripture
  stiles the life of man, a Warfare, a Wrestling, a Race, a Combat, a Reward, a
  Crowne; things that are not atchieued without labour, trouble, seruice,
  sweats, and some deseruing in our selues. Vbi non sunt Boues, praesepe
  vacuum est, Where there are no Oxen, the Cratch is emptie; where no
  paines, no profit. Herculei auri celebrant labores, saith
  Boëtius, The Chronicles of Hercules were his Labours. And
  Plautus, Pars est fortuna laborum.
               
               
                  Come out of those Borders. We are not onely to leaue
  sinne, but also to remoue from vs all occasion of sinning. God said vnto
  Abraham, Eijce ancillam; Agar
                  
                     〈◊〉

                  ace of his house: God might
  as well haue commanded him to correct and punish her for her insolent
  behauiour; but because he would haue the occasion of any farther falling out
  taken away, he layes this command vpon him, Eijce ancillam, &amp; filium
  eius. Ismael, ô Lord, (might Abraham haue said) is but a
  child,All occasions of sinne must be auoyded. and in
  regard of his tender age disciplinable and corrigible, he can as yet do but
  little harme. But this would not serue his turne, there was no remedie but hee
  must be sent packing too, that all occasion may be taken away of his mothers
  returning backe to see him. Salua te in Monte, ne stes, &amp;c. Get thee

  aduice vnto Lot, lest so circumuicinant and neere neighbouring
  occasion might prooue dangerous vnto him: Quantum distat Ortus ab
  Occidente, longe fecit à nobis iniquitates nostras, Looke how wide the
  East is from the West, so farre hath he set our sinnes from vs.
                  
                     Psal.
 103. In the Captiuitie of Babylon, the Children of Israell hid in a
  verie deepe pit, the holy Fire, as a man would hide Treasure, hoping hereafter
  they might come againe to the fetching of it out: but when this their
  Captiuitie was ended, when they came to seeke for it, they found in stead
  thereof, a coagulated and crudded kind of water, as when it is frozen; but when
  the beames of the Sunne began to touch vpon it, it turned againe to fire. So
  they that couer the fire of their affection with the ashes of absence, with a
  hope to returne to reuiue that heat; howbeit it be more cold and more frozen
  than water, yet with the Sunne of their presence, and the heat of occasion,
  those coles of loue begin to kindle anew, and to breake forth into their
  woonted flames. Saint Augustine reports of Alipius, That
  hauing resolued with himselfe, neuer to looke vpon your Fencers Prizes, vpon a
  time, through the earnest importunitie of his friends hee was drawne along to
  the Theatre where those bloudie sports were performed; protesting that he would
  keepe his eyes all the while shut, and not so much as once open them: yet it so
  fell out, that vpon a sudden great shout of the People, he looked abroad to see
  what the matter was; Whereupon hee became another man, and altered his former
  purpose; so that his hatred to this sport, was turned into a loue and liking of
  it. Ecclesiasticus saith, That as a cleere Fountaine is to the
  thirstie, and as the shade to him that is scortched with heat, such is
  occasion, to a  man that is accustomed to ill. In
  filia non auertente se, firma custodiam, Giue her for lost, if thou quit
  not the occasion.
            
            
               
                  Clamabat, Miserere mei, She cried, Haue mercie vpon
  me.
               Vocall Prayer is sometimes profitable, and sometimes necessarie;
  profitable, because it stirreth vp our inward deuotion, And is (as Saint
  Augustine hath obserued) that blast which bloweth and kindleth the
  fire that is within vs. Those that are more perfect than others, spend much
  time in meditation and contemplation of the Spirit: but those that are lesse
  perfect, because their inward heat quickly failes them, they must haue recourse
  to the breath of vocall Prayer, and call out aloud, with this Canaanitish
  woman; for the Heart and the Lips are an acceptable Sacrifice vnto God. Ex
  voluntate mea confitebor ei; Saint Paul calls it, The fruit of
  the Lips;
                     Heb. 13. Ose. 14.
                  Osee, A Sacrifice, Vituli Labiorum, The calfes of our
  Lips.
               
            
            
               Miserere mei, Fili Dauid.
               
                  Haue mercie vpon me, thou Sonne of Dauid. Saint
  Augustine saith, That whatsoeuer may be lawfully desired,What we are to demand in praier, &amp; how may be lawfully
  required of God: And beeing there be three sorts of things; some so good, that
  it is impossible the vse of them should be bad, as Grace, Vertue, Glorie, and
  the necessarie sustenance of the bodie, which we dayly beg of God: others so
  ill, that they can neuer be good, as Sinne and Wickednesse: and others
  indifferent, which of themselues are neither good nor euill, as Riches, and
  other the like temporall Goods. The first, wee may alwaies, and at all times
  begge of God without any condition or limitation: the second neuer: the third
  must euermore haue this reseruation; If it bee, ô Lord, for thy seruice,
  or thy honour and glorie, &amp;c. Now this Canaanitish woman crauing mercie
  for her selfe and her daughter, it beeing so holy and pious a petition, she
  might absolutely preferre the same to our Sauiour.
               
                  Merits vtterly cryed downe.
                  Haue
  mercie vpon me, thou Sonne of Dauid. Saint Basil pondereth the
  elegancie of this prayer, so wholly stript from any proper presumption in it
  selfe, and so cloathed throughout from top to toe, with the mercie of God.
  There is not any greater pouertie (saith Saint Bernard) than that of
  our owne merits; nor any falser riches than that of our own presumption. And
  he preuailes most with God, who presumes least of himself; for the mercies of
  God are not occasioned from our deseruings, but from his own infinite
  goodnesse, as Leo the Pope sets it down vnto you more at large. Gods
  mercie is so infinite and so immense, that there is no comparison betwixt our
  merits and it; so short is our rightuousnesse of his goodnesse. Saint
  Chrysostome sayes, That mercie must bee like a free Port that opens
  vnto the sea, and affoords franke passage vpon all occasions, or whither
  soeuer we are bound, without paying so much for importation, or so much for
  exportation, &amp;c.
               
                  O Sonne of Dauid. Although our Sauiour were of the Seed
  of Abraham, as well as of the House of Dauid; yet with this
  People, more preuailed this appellatiue of Dauid; for that the
  promise which God had made to this King was fresher in remembrance, more
  especiall, and more honourable, as Saint Chrysostome and
  Euthimius vpon this verie place haue noted it vnto vs: So that both
  the nobler, and the learneder sort among them, besides the People in generall,
  did not onely hold it as an Article of their Faith, but for a great glorie vnto
  them, that their Messias was to descend from the loynes of Dauid,
                  
                     Iohn 7. Mat. 2. 
                  Scriptum est; Quia de
  semine Dauid venit Christus. And our Sauiour asking of the Pharisees,
  Whose  sonne their Messias should bee? they did all agree
  in this, That hee should come from the Stocke of Dauid.
               
               Now whither it were, that this Cananitish woman by giuing him
  this attribute, thought with her selfe, That he had some obligation to fauour
  the Gentiles, (for the first Troupes that Dauid had, were of fugitiue
  Slaues and Forreiners, which came to his ayd, [Et factus est eorum
  Princeps] or whither the power that she saw he had in casting out Deuils,
  wrought thus vpon her; or whither the much honour that hee had alwaies shewne
  to women; or all of these together, were motiues of her pretension, I cannot
  tell you; but sure I am, that shee did beleeue, That our Sauiour Christ came
  into the world for to saue sinners, and for the generall good of all Mankind,
  for the Iew, and for the Gentile, and that the Deuills were subiect vnto him;
  (differing therein from the Pharisees, who made him Belzebubs Factor)
  and that there was no disease so incurable which this heauenly Physition was
  not able to cure; and that he had past his word to the greatest Sinners, That
  if they should call vpon God for mercie, and beleeue in his sonne Christ Iesus,
  whom he had sent into the world, he would free them from forth the depth of
  their miseries.
            
            
               Non respondit ei verbum.
               
                  He answered not a word. Origen, and almost all the rest
  of the Saints,Why God many times shewes himselfe deafe and
 dumbe to our requests. judge this silence of our Sruiour to bee verie
  strange, in regard ofthe strangenesse of the circumstances. First of all,
  Because that Fountaine (saith Origen) which was alwaies woont to
  inuite and call vs to drinke, doth now denie water to the Thirstie; the
  Physition that came to cure the Sicke, refuse to helpe his Patient; that
  Wisedome which cried out in the Market place with a loud voyce, Venite ad
  me, that it should now remaine dumbe, Who may not stand amased at it? O
  Lord, thou doost not onely accept of Prayer, but doost like of the bare desire
  to doe it; not onely of the lips, but of our willingnesse to mooue them. Et
  voluntate labiorum illius, non fraudasti eum, saith Dauid. And
  Wisedome, Optaui, &amp; datus est mihi sensus, When I prayed, vnderstanding
  was giuen me; and when I called,
                     Wisd.
 7. the Spirit of Wisedome came vnto me.
               Secondly, That those prayers &amp; cries which come not from the
  heart, should notbe heard, it is not much. Aufer à me tumultum
  carminum tuorum, saith Amos,
                  
                     Amos.
 5. 
                  Take thou away from me the multitude of thy Songs; for I
  will not heare the melodie of thy Viols; And all because they were not from the
  heart. And in another place, Populus hic labijs me honorat, corde autem
  longe est, They honour me (saith Esay) with their lips, but
  their heart is farre from me. But this Cananitish woman did by her voice
  expresse her hearts griefe: and most true it is, That parents many times louing
  their children better than themselues, are more sencible of their sorows than
  of their owne.
               Thirdly, it being so pious a businesse, as the freeing of her
  daughter from the torment of the Deuill; and being sent besides, of God into
  the world, Vt dissoluat opera Diaboli; the Apostles as well pittying
  the daughters miserie, as the mothers sorow, besought our Sauiour in her
  behalfe, saying, Dimitte illam.
               
               Fourthly, There must be some great matter in it, some
  extraordinarie reason, why Christ should bee now more dumbe, than at other
  times: But of that wee haue spoken elsewhere. Clamaui per diem, &amp; non
  exaudies, &amp; nocte, &amp; non &amp;c. (they are the words of the sonne
  of God to his eternall Father) What, ô Lord, (sayth hee)
  shall I call vpon thee night and day, and wilt thou not heare mee? Thy
  silence can bee no scandall vnto mee, because I know the secrets of thy heart; 
   and thy loue towards mee; Marry vnto others, it may giue
  great offence.
               In the former Chapter of this Storie, wee haue giuen some
  reasons of this silence. Of those which haue since offered themselues, let the
  first bee that of S. Chrisostome: If our Sauiour Christ (sayth he)
  should haue made present answer to the Canaanitish woman, her patience, her
  perseuerance, her prudence, her courage, and her faith, would not haue beene so
  much seene, nor manifested to the World. So that our Sauiour was not dumbe out
  of any scorne or contempt towards her, but because in the crysoll of these his
  put-byes, and disdaines, hee might discouer the treasure of her Vertues. And
  for this cause did Christ heape so many disgraces vpon her, one on the necke of
  another: one while, not seeming to take any notice of her griefs; another while
  stiling the Iews, children, and her selfe a dog. Wherewith this poore woman,
  was so far from being offended or taking any exception at it, that humbly
  casting her self downe at his feet, shee did worship and adore him, allowing
  all that he sayd to be true, &amp; that these disgraces were worthily throwne
  vpon her, confessing her selfe to bee no better than a dog, yet notwithstanding
  shee comes vpon him againe with an Etiam Domine, Yet the crums ô
  Lord, &amp;c. That with kind words and faire promises, and other gratious
  fauours, God should incourage his souldiers, put strength and boldnesse into
  them, and winne their loue and affection, it is not much; but that with
  disdaines and disgraces, they should receiue augmentation, and increase, (like
  Anteus, who the oftner he was by Hercules throwne to the
  ground, the abler and stronger hee grew) it is more than much. Hee that is in
  Loue, hath his affection rather inflamed than abated by disdaines: And this
  Canaanitish woman was falne so farre in loue with our Sauiour, that his
  neglecting of her could not quench the heat of her affection. In a word,
  because to fight against the disfauours of God, is one of the greatest proofes
  that a Soule can make of her prowesse; that this womans valour might bee the
  more seene, Non respondit ei verbum, Hee answered not a word,
  &amp;c.
               
               The second is of Saint Gregorie: Many times (saith he)
  God doth defer this or that fauor which we beg at his hands,
                     Psal. 7. and for no other cause, but that he would
  haue vs to perseuer in Prayer. God is so well pleased, that wee should pray and
  sue vnto him, that with him, hee is Magis importunus, qui importunat minus,
  Most troublesome, that is least troublesome. Saint Austen sayth,
  that out of the pleasure and delight that hee taketh therein, God will haue vs
  to intreat him euen for those things, which are alreadie decreed vpon in his
  diuine Councell. And as his prouidence giues vs the fruits of the Earth, by the
  meanes of trauell and tillage; so he giues vs many good things, &amp; many rich
  blessings, by the means of prayer. Abrahams posteritie rested verie
  secure, in regard of the promise which God had made vnto them;
                     Gen. 22. Gen. 28. And yet for all this,
  would hee haue Isaacs prayers to bee the meanes, that Rebecca
  of barren, should become fruitfull. There was great certaintie,3. Kings 
                     
                        •
                     8. that God would send raine after that great drought, for
  to comfort the children of Israel, yet would hee haue the prayer of
  Elias to bee the meanes to procure it. The health of Tobias
  and Sarah his wife stood vpon sure tearmes of safetie,
                     Tob. 3. yet was hee aduised by Raphaell
  to pray, that the Deuill might not haue the power to take his life from him, as
  hee had done from the rest of her husbands. This made Thomas to bee of
  opinion, that our predestination is propped vp and strengthened with the
  prayers of the Saints. And Saint Chrysostome affirmeth; That as the
  hands of a man are naturally, not onely instruments of all things else, but of
  the verie instruments themselues; so is Praier in that which is spirituall.
  Saint Ierome and Saint Basil, make mention of a certaine 
   Hereticke, who said, Seeing God knowes what I stand in
  need of, why should I seeke to trouble and importune him? Whereunto their
  answer is, That with God we are not to make our selues, Relatores
  necessitatis nostrae, sed reos, Not reporters, but petitioners. And as
  there is a great inequalitie betwixt Relatorem,
                  Importunity in prayer pleasing to God. and Reum;
  so is there likewise in their importunitie. Saint Augustine is of
  opinion, That he who is not importunate, shewes he hath no great mind to that
  thing hee sues for; and that God will not grant him his request, because he
  seemes to set so light by it.
               The third is this, God doth not onely from thy prayers receiue
  pleasure,Difference betwixt the maker of the image &amp; the
 worshipper. but honour. Martial treating of Idolaters, sayth,
  That there is this difference betwixt the Artificer that makes the Idoll, and
  him that prayes vnto it and adores it; that the Artificer onely makes the
  Image; but that he that prayes vnto it, and adores it, makes (as much as in him
  lies) a God of it; for by praying thereto, and adoring it, he doth openly
  protest and manifestly declare it's Diuinitie, and for his part, doth willingly
  acknowledge all reuerence and worship due to the same. 
   
                     Qui fingit sacros, auro, vel marmore vultus, 
                     Non facit ille Deos, qui rogat, ille facit. 
                     To Gold, or Stone, a sacred looke who faines, 
                     Makes them not Gods; who pray's, that praise
obtaines.
                   Which kind of language is likewise vsed in Scripture. The
  Children of Israell cried out, Fac nobis Deos qui nos precedant, Make vs
  Gods to goe before vs
                  ▪ but of Aaron it is said, That he made
  them a Calfe; it was Aaron that made the Calfe,
                     Exod. 32. but they, that made the Calfe a God.
  Thou entrest into a Siluer-Smiths Shop, thou seest him at worke, thou askest
  him, What he is a doing? he tells thee, Hee is making the God Cupid;
  He speakes amisse, and does not say well in it; for it is he that bowes before
  him, prayes vnto him, and adores him, that makes him a God: for thou for thy
  part makest him neither worse nor better than an Idoll; it is he that sues vnto
  him, he that falls downe and worships him, equalling him in his seruice with
  God, that makes him a God. Of such Gods, God saith by Dauid, They that make
  them are like vnto them, and so are all such as put their trust in them.
  So that to beg or aske any thing of God, is to honour and praise him,
                     Psal. 115. making publique protestation, and open
  acknowledgement of his diuine power. Dignus est Agnus accipere dignitat
                        •
                     m,
                  
                     Apoc. 5. 
                  Worthie is the Lambe that was
  killed (Saint Iohn pointing at our Sauiour) to rec
                        •
                     iue power, and riches, and wisedome,
  and strength, and glorie, and praise; To whom all the creatures that are
  in Heauen, and on the Earth, and in the Sea, and all that is in them, shall
  sing praise, and honour, and glorie, and power, to him that sitteth vpon the
  Throne, and vnto the Lambe for euermore. God, (and so our Sauiour Christ)
  wheresoeuer he is, hath still his diuinitie with him: Thou doost not denie it;
  but God is not contented with this, but hee will haue thee on thy part to giue
  it him, by calling vpon him, crauing his helping hand, and by acknowledging him
  to be thy God. According to that prophecie of Esay, Ipsum Gentes
  deprecabunt
                        •
                     r, The Earth shall be
  full of the knowledge of the Lord, and the N
                        ••
                     ions shall seeke vnto him.
                  
                     Esay 11.
 Dan. 
                     
                        •
                     .
                  Daniel chose rather to be cast into the Lyons Denne, than to leaue off
  his praying vnto God. Darius would needes make himselfe a God for
  thirtie dayes, and gaue command, That none should dare to make any supplication
  to any other but himselfe: It was a rash and vnaduised action in him to seeke
  to make himselfe a God; but it was no ill course in him, that he made this
  trouble of hearing their petitions, the meanes to remedy 
  what he found was amisse; for by hearing his Peoples complaints, he knew the
  better how to helpe them. And therefore God complaining of his People, That
  they did not come and sue vnto him, nor make their moane vnto him, hee brands
  them in the forehead to their foule shame, with a Non me inuocasti, Thou
  hast not called vpon me.
               
               The fourth is S. Austens; who saith, That God sometime
  denies, sometimes grants our requests; one while more slow, another, more
  speedie, in yeelding to our petitions. The Deuill craued his leaue to tempt
  Iob, and hee presently gaue way to it. Saint Paul did beg of
  him, that he might be freed from that euil Angell which tormented him, and his
  suit was denied; yet the Deuils dispatch was nothing so good as Saint
  Pauls: to the one it was quicke, but to his farther shame and
  confusion: to the other more slow, but to his greater grace and glorie. The
  Spouse treating of her Beloued, saith, I sought him, but I could not find
  him; I called him,
                  
                     Cant. 5.6. 
                  but he
  answered me not. Richardus de Sancto Victore saith, That God doth not
  presently replie to our Prayers, nor on the sudden grant our requests, to the
  end that he might make vs the better answer, and send vs away with the better
  dispatch. It is a note of Saint Basils, That Salomons
  wisedome stayed so little a while with him, because God had so soone granted
  his request. And therefore it is commonly said, Que prestò se
  alcança se pierde, Soone got, soone lost.
               
               The fift is of Victor Antiochenus. Our Sauiour Christ
  (saith he) threw so manie disgraces vpon this woman of Tyrus and Sydon, and
  yet gaue her strength withall to continue so couragious and constant all the
  while, to the end that if the Iewes should either grow enuious or jealous of
  the fauour that our Sauiour shewed vnto her, by taking exception at his
  Fiat tibi sicut vis, Bee it vnto thee as thou wouldst haue it; and at
  that his extraordinarie commending of her, when he tells her, I haue not
  found such great Faith, no not in Israell: he might verie wel excuse
  himselfe vnto them, by shewing vnto them, that this was violentiae magis,
  quam voluntatis, rather a violent, than a voluntarie action, and that
  whither hee would or no, he was in a manner forced and compelled to doe as he
  did: For it is not vnknowne vnto you, how scornefull I shewed my selfe vnto
  her, how many disgraces I put vpon her; yet all would not doe, but she is more
  importunate vpon me than before, so that her Faith did enforce me to yeeld. He
  that is truly in loue, auoyds the occasions that may bee offensiue to his Loue:
  Nor can that loue be too much indeered, which our Sauiour bare vnto the Iewes,
  which made him so loath to offend them: but neuer was there any woman so
  jealous of her husband, as the Iewes were of the Gentiles, as also of our
  Sauiours conuersing with them.
               The sixt, That one of the noblest and most heroicall acts of our
  Faith, is, That a man should loue his Maker, cal to God for mercie and
  forgiuenesse of his sinnes, desire victorie ouer his temptations, and sue and
  beg, and that earnestly, not a yeare or two, but ten yeares together; and God
  all this while not returning him any answer, that he should for all this still
  perseuer in these his constant courses of Prayer, is a thing, I know not
  whither more to be commended, than admired.
                     Iob.
 30.20. 
                  Clamo, &amp; non exaudis me; sto, &amp; non respicis me,
  saith Iob, I crie vnto thee, and thou do

                     st not heare me, neither regardest me when I stand vp; I crie by
  Prayer, I stand vp by perseuerance. Vatablus translates it, Sto, &amp;
  nihil me curas, I stand vp, and th
                        ••
                     
  takest no notice of it. Moses did desire of God, That he would doe him the
  fauour to let him see his face: that he should talke with God, and God speake
  again to him; this would not content him, he must see him, forsooth, else all
  the rest was as nothing: In what case would hee then haue beene, had hee
  neither seene nor  heard of him? Of Baal the
  diuine Historian deliuereth,3. Kings 18.
                  There was neither voice to be heard, nor one to answer, nor any that
  regarded. He was a false god; but that our God should be deafe at our
  cries, &amp;c.
               The seuenth, That a mother should breed vp her daughter so ill,
  that shee should fall into the Deuills hands, Male à Daemonio
  vexatur [the Greeke, Daemonizatur] it is not much, that Christ
  should not make her any answer; for although no man can liue free from the
  batterie of Hell, yet a mother that shall thrust her daughter into it, must
  hold her selfe an vnfortunate woman: For it is necessarie that scandalls
  should come; yet Christ did mourn for those through whose meanes they were
  occasioned.
               The last, God doth deferre the fauours thou beggest of him, to
  the end thou maist esteeme the better of them when they come; for wee lightly
  esteeme of those things that cost vs but little labour. Elisha could
  haue healed Naaman the King of Syria's Fauourite, either by his word
  onely, or by laying his hands vpon his leprosie, or by willing him to wash
  himselfe but once in Iordan; but hee would haue him to wash himselfe therein
  seuen times, because hee should not disesteeme of it. Speciosa mesericordia
  Dei quasi nubes in tempore siccitatis, O! how faire a thing is mercie in
  the time of anguish and trouble?
                     Eccle. 35.
  It is like a Cloud of raine in the time of a drought. For these, and other the
  aforesaid reasons, our Sauiour Christ would not giue eare to this humble
  petition of this poore Canaanitish woman.
            
            
               Dimitte cam, quia clamat post nos.
               
                  Dispatch her, for she crieth after vs. These were good
  Fauourites,Soft persons the fittest about Princes.
  worthie to be about the person of Christ their King: your Courtyers haue not
  commonly such tender bowells; but these had compassion of other mens miseries
  and necessities, they take part in the petitions of the poore, they plead the
  cause of the afflicted, they solicite their suit, and entreat hard for them.
  The Propitiatorie stood vpon the Arke of the Law, and on either side, it had
  two Cherubimes couering the Mercie seat with their wings, and their faces one
  towards another,

                        •
                     . beholding one another in that
  manner, that their eyes were neuer off each other. Saint Augustine
  will haue it, That God doth hereby aduise the Transgressours of his Law, that
  they should appeale from his rigour to his mercie, which was the neerest cut a
  sinner could make;Mercie, a sure motiue for mercie.

  seat, was, to looke vpon our neighbor, &amp; neuer to haue our eyes from off
  his wants and necessities. The Spouse did boast her selfe of those fauours
  which her Beloued did vnto her, Introduxit me Rex in cellam vinariam,
  &amp;c. Hee brought me into the Wine sellar, and Loue was his banner ouer me;
  his left hand is vnder my head, and his right hand doth embrace me,
  &amp;c. And her companions that kept her companie made answer,

  reioyced, and will be glad, &amp;c. We take much ioy in this thy priuacie
  and inwardnesse with him, because wee know that it will make much for our
  good. Thou alone (saith Saint Bernard) shalt enter into the Wine
  sellar; but thou alone shalt not be rich and happie therein, thou must share
  these thy blessings with thy neighbours, friends, and allyes, and all must tast
  of the milke of thy brests: for the brests were not made so much for those that
  haue them, as for those harmlesse creatures that must sucke and draw from
  them. This loue and charitie shewed the Apostles, when they did solicite this
  womans dispatch, and said to our Sauiour, Dimitte illam, Send her
  away.
               
            
            
               
               Non sum missus nisi ad Oues, quae perierunt domus
  Israel.
               
                  I am not sent but to the lost Sheepe of the House of
  Israell. Principally, personally, and by especiall precept, was our
  Sauiour sent to the People of Israell; which was testified by Saint Paul,
  The Word of God was to be spoken first to you: And this was the reason why
  he called them Children; and the Gentiles, Dogges. But by his Apostles he came
  to preach and do miracles for the whole world: so doth Saint Ambrose, Cyril
  Alexandrinus, Saint Hierome, and learned Bede declare
  it. Saint Augustine saith, That he employed his presence onely vpon
  the Iewes, in regard of Abraham
                        •
                     
                   Faith, and for the promise sake which God had made of the
  Messias; so that though hee came to the borders of Tyrus and Sydon, it was more
  for to hide himselfe out of the way, than any thing else; and that though he
  wrought this miracle there, it was not much materiall, beeing wrested from him
  by importunitie; as one, who to still a bauling Curre, throwes him a morcell
  of bread to stop his mouth; or, to speake it in better termes, as one, from
  whom by chance a crumme had fallen from forth his fingers.
               
                  Non sum missus nisi ad Oues, &amp;c. Amongst many other
  offices which our Sauiour Christ had, one was that of a Sheepheard, who was to
  gather together his scattered Sheepe, and to bring them all into one Fold.
  Et suscitabo super eos Pastorem meum,
                  
                     Ezech. 34. 
                  qui pascat eos, so saith
  Ezechiel, I will set vp a Sheepheard ouer them, and he shall feed
  them.
                  2. Pet.
                   Saint Peter calls
  him Principem pastorum; and he prooues himselfe to be a Sheepheard,
  by his going forth to seeke after this lost Sheepe. And if we mean to haue our
  habitation in Heauen, &amp; to be of the same Fold with the Saints, we must
  first be this Sheepheards Sheepe vpon earth, before wee can come to be his
  Saints in Heauen. For albeit the Iust beare the name of Sheepe, as is noted by
  Saint Hierome, Saint Augustine, Saint Gregorie, and
  Saint Cyprian; yet all that haue this name shall not come to Heauen;
  for many, of Sheepe shall become Wolfes.
               First, The proportion of our Sauior Christs giuing to his, the
  name of Sheep and of Lambes, consists first of all in their innocencie and
  simplicitie; whereof the Sheepe and the Lambe are the true symbole and
  hieroglyphicke; as it is prooued by Saint Gregorie and Saint
  Cyprian in the place before alledged. Quid per Oues nisi
  
                        •
                     nnocentia designatur? What but
  innocencie is pointed at by Sheepe? saith Saint Gregorie. Oues
  nominat, vt innocentia Christiana Ouibus aequetur, He calls the
                        •
                      Sheep, to shew, that Christian
  innocencie should equall that of theirs, saith Saint Cyprian.
  When the Angel with that his naked Sword in his hand went making that
  fearefull slaughter amongst the Israelites, Dauid humbly kneeling on
  his knees makes his mones vnto God, and saith, Isti qui Oues sunt,
  quidfecerunt? What haue these poore Sheepe done,
                  2.
 Kings 24. these innocent Lambes? it is I that haue sinned,
  smite mee, and not them: Let thy hand, I pray, bee against mee and my fathers
  House; but spare these thy Sheepe, who syllie harmelesse Creatures haue no way
  offended thee.
               Secondly, This proportion consists in that wonderfull obedience
  which the Sheepe carrie to the Sheepeheard, who with a word or a whistle
  bridleth their appetites, and keepes them within their bounds, not offering to
  stray into strange Pastures. This is that which Dauid said, His
  eare was obedient to me: And our Sauiour Christ, My Sheepe heare my
  voyce.
               
               Thirdly, In that, those that are lost and gone astray, shew
  their discomfort, by bleating and following from hill to hill, from pasture to
  pasture, path to path, the steps of his Sheepheard, lifting vp his head, and
  bending his eare on the one  side, and listning whither he
  can heare the sound of his voyce, and many times he will leane one eare to the
  ground, the better to helpe his attention. Saint Ambrose saith, That
  one of the greatest pledges that a Sinner can desire of his Predestination,
  is, to be like vnto the lost Sheepe, to shew himselfe sad and heauie, when he
  misseth his Sheepheard that should protect him, and looke well vnto him; to
  make his moane, send out sighes and sobs like so many blea
                     •
                  ings, to follow the tracke of his footsteps, to listen
  to his whistle, to hearken to his voyce, and to giue eare vnto his call: for
  that sinner that shal do so, it is an euident token that he was borne for
  Heauen.
               Fourthly, There is nothing in a Sheepe, whatsoeuer it be, but is
  good &amp; profitable; (as the flesh, the bloud, the milke, the wooll, and the
  fell) but nothing that is hurtfull: besides, it is a most fruitfull creature,
  Oues fatosae abundantes in faetibus suis, Our Sheepe bring forth thousands
  and ten thousands in our streets. The just man is likewise full of
  goodnesse, and full of profit, in his words, and in his workes, in his
  thoughts, in his wealth, in his pouertie, in his health, and in his sickenesse:
  but nothing in him that is hurtf
                     •
                  ll. Saint Paul reckoning the conditions and properties of
  Charitie, repeateth first the good that it doth, Patiens est, benigna est,
  &amp;c. Loue suffereth long, it is bountifull, &amp;c. And anon after, he
  enumerateth the euills which it doth not, Non aemulatur, &amp;c. Loue
  enuieth not,
                  1. Cor. 2
                        •
                     . 
                  Loue doth not boast it selfe, it is not
  puffed vp, it doth no vncomely thing, it seeketh not her owne things, it is not
  prouoked to anger, it thinketh no euill, it reioyceth not in iniquitie,
  &amp;c.
               
               Fiftly, It's patience and gentlenesse when they sheere him and
  robbe him of his Fleece, turning him this way or that way, when they bind his
  legs, or otherwise vse him hardly, and put him to paine, he scarce offereth to
  bleat or open his mouth; he goes as willingly to the Butchers blocke, as to his
  greene pastures; and when the Butcher puts his knife to his throat, hee beholds
  him with a gentle and louely looke. In a word, Esay endeering the
  infinite patience of our Sauiour Christ, could not find any comparison fitter
  for him, than that of the Sheepe and the Lambe, Sicut Ouis ad occisionem
  ductus est, sicut Agnus coram tondente, se obmutuit, He went like a Sheepe to
  the slaughter, and like a Lambe before the shearer, hee opened not his
  mouth. This then is the nature and qualitie of the mysticall Sheep of the
  Church, Caeduntur gladijs, &amp;c. They are smitten with swords, yet
  neither murmure nor complaine.
               
               Sixtly, Saint Basil and Saint Ambrose both
  affirme, That the Sheepe ordinarily do eat and chew the cud, but then most of
  all (by a naturall instinct) when Winter drawes on, and then he feeds a great
  deale faster, and with more eagernesse, as diuining, that through the
  inclemencie of the Heauens, and the bitternesse of the cold, he shall not find
  feeding sufficient for him. And this is a lesson for vs, to teach vs what we
  are to doe: The Sheep of Christs flocke vsually are to seeke for their feeding
  in the pastures of Vertue, either by ruminating, meditating, or contemplating;
  but when they see death approching neere vpon them, they must fall more
  speedily and more earnestly to their meat; for when the Winter of death shall
  come vpon them, they will not find whereon to feed. And therefore worke
  righteousnesse before thou die; like vnto the Ant, who prouides in the Summer
  against the rigour of the Winter: Quoniam non est apud inferos, inuenire
  cibum, In hell there is no meat to be got for any money: and the hunger in
  Hell is so strange, that the Damned feed vpon their owne tongues.
               For these his Sheep God came into the world, Quantum ad
  efficaciam, though he came also for all the whole world in generall:
  Quantum ad sufficientium, effectually for His; but sufficiently
  forall. And it is a fearefull thing to thinke on,  which
  is noted by Saint Bernard; to wit, That he that shal not be a sheepe
  in this life,
                     Psal. 49. shall after death be
  damned to Hell; Sicut Oues in inferno positi sunt, They lie in Hell like
  sheepe, and death gnaweth vpon them. As here we take the fleece from off
  our Sheepe, and leaue them naked and poore; so there the Wolfe shall be
  fleeced of his riches, and of all the pleasures and comforts that hee tooke in
  this world, and be left not only naked, but full likewise of paine and torment;
  Mors depascet eos, Death shall gnaw vpon them, and dying to life, they
  shall liue to death.
            
            
               Venit &amp; adorauit eum; dicens, Domine adiuua me.
               
                  Came and worshipped him; saying, Lord helpe me. As
  there are some kind of fires which recouer more force by throwing water vpon
  them; so the heart of this woman did recouer more courage by this our Sauiors
  disgrace, in not vouchsafing her an answer, thinking thereby to quench the
  heat of her zeale: And falling downe prostrate before him, and adoring him as
  God, said vnto him, Lord, am I thy Sheepe, or not thy Sheepe? camest thou for
  me, or not for me? I dare not be so bold to dispute that with thee; yet giue
  mee leaue, considering the wretchednesse of my case, to call vnto thee for
  helpe, and to beat at the doores of thine eares, with a Domine adjuva
  me; with a Helpe me good Lord. Here are those hot, impatient,
  violent, and firie dispositions condemned, for whom those two louely Twinnes,
  Hope and Patience, were neuer borne: with whom, euerie little delaying of
  their desires, and deferring of their hopes, driues them to the depth of
  desperation, and is as a thousand deaths vnto them. They are like vnto your
  hired Horses, who come so hungrie to their Inne, that they will not stay the
  plucking off of their bridle, though thereby they should the better come at
  their meat. Osee compares them to a young Heyfer that hath been vsed
  to tread out corne, who is no sooner taken from the cart, or the Plough, before
  her yoke is taken off would faine runne to the threshing floore, Ephraim
  vitula est, doctā diligere trituram; So affected to her feeding, that
  she hath not the patience to put a meane betweene her treading and her
  eating.
            
            
               Non est bonum sumere panem Filiorum, &amp; mittere
  Canibus.
               
                  It is not good to take the Childrens Bread, and giue it to
 Doggs.
               
               This was so cruell a blow, that any bodie else would hardly haue
  indured it; But God alwayes proportions his fauours and disfauours, according
  to the measure of our capacitie: To thee, hee giues riches, because he
  distrusts thy weakenesse; to another, pouertie, because hee knowes his
  strength. Fidelis Deus, qui non patietur vos tentare,
                  1. Cor. 11. 
                  vltra id quod potestis. God
  is so good a God, that hee will not suffer yee to bee tempted aboue your power.
  And this reason alone ought to make men rest contented with that state and
  condition of life, whereinto God hath put them. Christ you see, carries
  himselfe scornefully to this woman, yet (poore soule) shee patiently suffers
  and indures all: Whether or no, for that it is an ordinarie thing with God, to
  be then most kind, when he seemes to bee most curst. How did he deale with
  Abraham touching his sonne Isaac? Hee makes him draw his
  sword, set an edge vpon it, and lift vp his arme to strike, but when hee was
  readie to giue the blow, hee holds his hand, and bestowes a blessing vpon him,
  for this his great faith and obedience.
            
            
               Non est bonum, sumere panem filiorum.
               
                  It is not good to take the childrens bread. What? shall
  I giue the childrens bread vnto dogges? It is not fitting. My Miracles and my
  Doctrine were meant to  the children (for so was Israel
  called) Filius meus primogenitus Israel. It was prouided, &amp;
  principally promised vnto them,
                     Exod. 4. vpon
  a pact or couenant which God had made with Abraham. In a well ordered
  house, the dogs are not allowed to eat the childrens bread, worser scraps will
  serue their turne; it is enough that they haue that which is necessarie to
  nourish their bodie. Oculi omnium, in te sperant Domine, The eyes of all
  things wait vpon thee, ô Lord;
                  
                     Psal.
 145. 
                  and thou giuest them their meate in due season, such as is
  fitting for them. But the choyce bread of his Law, and of his presence, this is
  reserued for his owne house and familie, those that are his children, and his
  owne people. Of whom Saint Paul sayth, Credita sunt illis eloquia
  Dei. And Dauid; Non fecit taliter omni nationi;
                  
                     Psal. 147. 
                  Hee hath not dealt so with any
  nation besides. Your Turkes, the Moores, and the Negros, in a scorne and
  contempt of them, wee call them dogges. And wee inherit this name from the
  Moores, who when they were Lords of Spaine, bestowed that nick-name on vs. The
  Scripture giues this name of base minded men.2.
 Kings 3. 2. Kings 16. 
                  Nunquid caput canis ego sum?
  Am I a dogges head? It was Abuers saying to Ishbosheth.
  As if hee should haue sayd, shall I be so base as to pocket such a wrong.
  Againe,4. Kings 8. Shall I take off this
  dogges head that curseth my King? It was Abishays speech of
  Shimei; as making no more reckoning of him than of a dogge. Againe, Is
  thy seruant a dogge, that I should be so deuoyd of all pittie and humanitie? It
  was Hazaells answere to Elisha, when hee told him of the
  euill that he should doe vnto the children of Israell.

  Chrisostome noteth) held herselfe now as good as alreadie dispatcht,
  and that her sute was at an end. Inferring hereupon; ô Lord, I account
  my selfe a most happy woman, that I may be admitted into thy house, though it
  be but in the nature of a dog. First, because that dogs beeing faithfull and
  louing, affectionate thereby their Masters vnto them. And none shall be more
  louing and loyall vnto you than I, who shall still wait vpon you, be neuer from
  your heeles, and follow you vnto death. And secondly; for that to dogs, were
  neuer yet denyed the crums that fell from their Masters table. I would not
  (poore vnworthy creature,Discretion a maine motiue in our
 petitions to God. as Theophilact makes her speake) desire any
  of those thy greater miracles, which thou keepest for thine own children, the
  least that thou hast will content me, be it but as a crum in comparison of the
  whole loafe. O how humbly and discreetly did this Canaanitish woman goe to
  worke. How meane, and yet how great a courtesie did shee beg of our Sauiour?
  For in Gods house, the least crumme of his bread, is sufficient to make vs
  happy for euer, and neuer more to suffer hunger; as the least drop of his
  bloud, is able to cleanse thousands of soules from their sinnes. Elegi

  prince of Aegypt. It is a common prouerbe; Que vale mas migaia de Rey,

  Abraham being but a particular man, God was willing to make him famous
  in the world; and for this end he added to his name but one only letter,
                     Gen. 17. 
                  Non vltra vocaberis Abram, sed
  Abraham, Thy name shall be no more called Abram, but Abraham. This no
  nada, this thing as it were of nothing, which God bestowed vpon him, was
  enough to make him prosper and thriue in the world, &amp; to be the stocke and
  root of such an illustrious Linage, as the world had neuer since the like.

  haue said, Thy humilitie, thy perseuerance, thy wisedome, thy patience, the
  acknowledgement of thine owne miserie, &amp; thy confessing thy selfe to be but
  a Dogge. But I acknowledge thee (saith Saint Augustine) to be so
  worthie a woman, that I much wonder at thy worth; and the more I thinke on it,

                     bit  in ira misericordias suas? He will
  sometimes withhold his mercies, as if he had quite forgotten them: it is an
  effect of his prouidence, now and then to defend them; but this still tendeth
  to our greater good.
               
                  Be it vnto thee as thou wouldst haue it. Our Sauiour
  was somewhat slow in dispatching this woman, but it was to better her dispatch.
  O thou Canaanite, thou maist thinke thy selfe well dispatcht with these
  crummes, now all is remitted to thyne owne good liking; Fiat tibi sicut
  vis, there is thy discharge: And though thou hast staid long for it, yet
  that is not to bee accounted long, which comes at last: he negotiates not ill,
  who endeth his negotiation before he depart from the presence of his King,
  obtaining not onely his suit, but withall, a dispatch.Earthly Princes forward to grant, but slow to giue. The
  Kings and Princes of the earth will giue thee bread when thou hast no teeth to
  eat it; a bed, when thy bones cannot rest in it, they are so bruised and
  broken; and when they haue granted thee thy desire, thou shalt not haue that
  dispatch. Saul made an open Proclamation, That he that should kill
  Goliah, that gyant-l

  Philistine, should marrie his daughter; the right was in Dauid, but
  this fauour was affoorded him out of season, and not in it's due time; for shee
  was married to another that neuer drew his sword in the quarell. Dauid
  finding himselfe herewith agrieued, and complaining, that he was not wel dealt
  withal, he receiued answer, That his reward was sure enough, and therefore he
  needed not to doubt of it; but that his businesse might be dispatcht, he must
  first kill a hundred Philistines: so that his promised reward cost him the
  killing of one, and his dispatch, the killing of a hundred. The world is the
  same now as it was then; the dispatch costs more than the thing wee pretend is
  worth. I see many Images of deuotion in the Court, as our Ladie of Pilgrims,
  our Ladie of Pains, and our Ladie of good Successe; but I know not why, or
  wherefore, there being more need a great deale, to erect and set vp a Ladie of
  good Dispatch.
               
                  Seneca saith, That those that are Pretenders,Delayes much practised by Man. will more patiently endure
  the cutting off of the thread of their pretension, than to haue their hopes
  drawne out from day to day. Saint Ambrose vpon that place of Saint
  Luke, Statim Gallus cantauit, Presently the Cocke crew; noteth three
  Statims, or three Presently's; Presently the Cocke crew; Presently
  Peter wept; and, Presently God forgaue him. But your Ministers of
  Iustice, as also in Court, doe now a days delay a man, as a Physition doth a
  Cure, that he may be honoured the more, and payed the better. Twentie yeares
  did Iacob serue his father in Law Laban, fourteene for his
  wiues, and sixe for their dowrie; and being so due a debt as it was, hee went
  so long deferring the payment thereof, that if God had not taken his part, he
  might haue returned home (for ought I know) with the staffe that he brought
  with him. Mutasti mercedem meam decem vicibu
                        •
                     , Thou hast deceiued me, and changed my wages ten
  times: There is no honestie in such kind of dealing; there are too many of
  these now a dayes; but God amend them: And so I commend you to God.
            
         
         
            
            THE TENTH SERMON, VPON THE FRYDAY AFTER THE FIRST SVNDAY IN
LENT.
            
               
                  IOANNIS. 5.1. 
                  
                     Erat dies Festus Iudaeorum, &amp; erat Hierusalem probatica
  piscina.
                   
                  There was a Feast of the Iewes, and there is at Ierusalem by
  the place of the Sheepe, a Poole.
               
            
            
               God the onely supporter of weaker Man.
  Eccle. 2.
               AMongst those many other Fish-pooles which belonged
to Ierusalem, (besides those which Salomon had made for his own
particular vse and pleasure, Extruxi mihi Piscinas aquarum, I made
Cisternes of water, &amp;c.) this of all the rest was the most famous.
Iosephus calls it, Stagnum Salomonis, because it was built
by this King, neere vnto the Temple, for the seruice of sacred things: it was a
Poole that was walled round about, whereunto your heards and flockes of
cattell could not come; and some say, That this was the place where the Priests
hid the holy Fire which Nehemias afterwards found to bee conuerted
into a thicke water. It was walled round about, and had fiue seuerall open
porches full of diseased people, some of one infirmitie, and some of
another.
            This Hospitall ioyned to the backe of the Temple, to shew, that
the poore haue no other prop in this life to vphold them, saue Gods backe; this
must bee their strength, hereunto must they leane: it is our Sauiours shoulders
that must not onely beare vs vp, but our infirmities, by taking them vpon
himselfe.
            In Saint Chrysostomes time, the Hospitals were set apart
from the Temples, for feare of receiuing infection from those contagious
diseases: For the poore did lie like so many Dogges, at the doores of Gods
house. A Theefe, that he may the better enter that house where there are many
doggs, holds it his best course,  to stop their mouths
with somthing or other: We are all Theeues, and that we may enter peaceably
into Gods House, there is no better meanes, than to giue something to the
poore, which like so many Dogges lie at the gate. Twice in the Old Testament
hath God commanded, That no man should petition him with emptie hands; [Non
apparebis in conspectu meo vacuus.
               
                  Exod. 23,
  &amp; 34] And Saint Chrysostome expounding this
place, saith, He enters emptie handed, who comming to craue something of God,
doth not first bestow an Almes vpon the poore; according to that rule of our
Sauior Christ, What yee shall doe to one of these little ones, &amp;c.
Citing likewise for confirmation of this Doctrine, that place of
Ecclesiasticus, Ante Orationem, prepara animam tuam, Before thou prayest,
prepare thy self, &amp;c.
               
                  Eccle. 18.
When thou hast enough, remember the time of hunger; and when thou art rich,
thinke vpon pouertie and need. To shew pittie to the poore,Almes, the preparation of the soule to Prayer. Gen.
  32. he termes it Animae preparationem, A preparing of the
soule: And it is not much, that God should take pleasure therein, seeing
men are so well pleased therewith. I will appease him with gifts,
saith Iacob, when he went forth to meet his brother Esau. And
Ester comming before Assuerus to beg a boone at his hand, it
is said, That one of her maids of Honour bare vp her arme, and the other, her
traine. This is a Type of Prayer, accompanied with Fasting and Almes-deeds;
which two, are able to negotiate any thing with God: and where there is such
an Ester, there is not any Assuerus (though neuer so great)
who will not bow the Scepter of his mercie towards her.
Ecclesiasticus saith, Giue an almes to the poore, and it shall
entreat for thee, and preuaile.
            
            
               There is in Ierusalem by the place of the Sheepe, a
Poole.
               Publicke temples to be frequented. God
did honour his Temple with this Poole, where there was a perpetuall prouision
for health; and it was a prouidence full of conueniencie, that God should
conferre his fauours where his name is praysed, and that Man should receiue
them there where hee praiseth him. Te decet Hymnus Deus in Syon, tibi
reddetur votum in Hierusalem, In Syon, ô Lord, they sing Hymnes vnto
thee; in Ierusalem they make their vowes; Open in these places the hands of thy
bountie, Et replebimur in bonis domus tuae, And we shall bee filled with the
good things of thy house. Amongst other fauours which God promised to his
house, this was one, In loco isto dabopacem,

                     •
                  n that place I will grant thee
peace. The name of Peace intimateth all manner of good things whatsoeuer;
here art thou to beg, and here to receiue the granting of thy petitions. And
for this cause God calls his house the house of Prayer, which is ordained to
begge those things of God which we stand in need of, and to praise him for what
he giues, and we receiue.
            The Court is the Worlds Epitome, an abreuiation, or short
abridgement of this greater Vniuerse; for that it hath in it whatsoeuer is
dispersed throughout the face of the earth. And this Poole is a figure of the
Court: First of all, in this Poole there are a great many of sicke &amp;
diseased persons, &amp; those of verie foule and filthie diseases, blind,
wasted in their bodies, benumm'd, withered, lame, and maimed. Iacere▪
To lie, in Scripture is spoken of those that are dead, (as it appeareth
in Exodus, in the Booke of Tobias,
               
                  Exod. 12. Tob. 2. and so of those that
lie at the point of death) as likewise of Lazarus, when he lay at
Diues his gate. So saith Saint Iohn in this place,
Multitudo languentium iaceba
                     •
                  , i. There lay a great multitude of sicke men. In the
Court there are a great many that lie sicke of diuers and sundrie diseases of
the Soule; an Apoplexy seiseth vpon all the sences of the bodie; one pretension
or other possesseth the sences of the bodie, and the faculties of the Soule,
and vpon all whatsoeuer belongs vnto man; as his honour, his wealth, his
conscience, and truth, &amp;c. This man came to the Poole benumm'd, and at 
 the end of thirtie eight yeares was more benumm'd than at
first; and if our Sauiour Christ had not helped him, it is probable he would
haue perished. Many come to the Court, to recouer themselues of an infirmitie
that followes them, called Pouertie; and after many yeares trauell, and paines
taking, they prooue poorer than before, and oft die of that disease: whereas if
they had bin contented with their former meane estate, they might perhaps not
haue died so soone. And although they get the Office they pretend, yet doe they
neuer come to be rich, because their profits doe not equall their charges.
Seneca saith, That if these men would haue taken councell of those who
haue tryed this poole some few yeares, they would alter their mind. If he that
applies himselfe to the seruice of Venus in his youth, would but
follow the aduice of him who lies in his bed laden with the Pox, &amp; hath not
a bone in all his bodie that wishes him well, Vota mutasset, Hee would haue
changed his vowes. If hee that desires to become a Courtier, will but
hearken to him, who being chap-fallen and toothlesse, and hauing spent all his
life time in the seruice of the Court, goes away at last vnrewarded, if not
ill requited; Vota mutasset, He would haue altered his course.
Besides, the diseases in Court are so foule and so vncurable, that it is a
miracle, to see one of a thousand of them to be made whole: who, when the wind
of Ambition and Pretension fit faire and prosperous vpon him, will change his
Councellors robe, retyre himselfe from businesses of the world, put on an
Hermits Weed, and in some solitarie Cell betake himselfe wholly to his
deuotion? Who, beeing the Fauourite of a King, will not rather loose his life,
than leaue the Court? Who that is sicke (like him of the Dropsie) of that
insatiable infirmitie of Couetousnesse, will, in his treasuring vp of Riches,
say at length, Now I haue enough▪
            
            Secondly, In this Fish-poole all did liue in hope,
Expectantium aquae motum, Weighting for the moouing of the water; Led
along with this hope, they suffered much miserie, but other good had they none.
By Osee God said to Israell, Dies multos expectabis me, I will
cause thee, vt sperando, desperes, That thy hopes end in despaire. The
greatest torment that the Iewes suffer in this life, is, That al the types and
figures of their hopes being past, (let them looke as long as they will for a
Messias) in reuenge of their vnbeleefe, their vnderstandings are so blinded,
that they still remaine condemned to wait vpon this idle hope.
            By God Esay bewaileth &amp; lamenteth that country which
had placed her hopes in the multitude of her ships that she put forth to
sea,The life of a Courtier, is wholly vpon hopes.
[In vasis papyri super 
                     •
                  quas] persuading themselues, that their oares, their sailes,
and their Vessells (which were no better than boats of paper, in Gods hands,
which sinkes as soone as the water sokes through them) should bring them newes
of comfort. And vttering forth this his sorrow for them, he addeth, Ite
Angeli veloces ad gentem dilacerat
                     ••
                  , He would haue his Angells to betake them to their wings, to
goe comfort this people; he sends them ad Gentem expectantem, a people
that liued all vpon hope. Runne ouer the houses of all your Courtiers, and aske
euerie particular man o
                  •
                them, How
he liues▪ and he will tell you, That he liues vpon hopes. The Pretender
hopes, that he may see the water of the Fish-poole, that thereby some good
fortune may befall him: The Theefe, he likewise would haue the waters mooue,
that he might make a purchase to releeue his pouertie; your young women, some
happie encounter, &amp;c. Those that haue some to helpe them, make

                  •
                quicke dispatch of it; but hee
that hath no bodie to stand his friend, must stay weighting some thirtie eight
yeares, and then too in the end must haue the helpe of some miracle to heale
him of his sickenesse.
            Thirdly, In this Fish-poole they all weighted diligently, and were
wonderfull  carefull and vigilant, when the water should
mooue, and then did they rush in speedily, lest some other should preuent them
and step in before them. In the Court your Pretenders stand attending with a
great deale of care, when Offices are to be bestowed, and other prouisions
granted forth, shouldring and shoouing one another, that others may not get the
start of them, and clap in betwixt them and home. Seneca compares the
Courtiers to Butchers Curres, who in the shambles stand looking with a
watchfull eye for some offalls of the intrailes that shall be throwne downe
amongst them, for the which they fall together by the eares; but one hauing the
mor
                  •
               ell, and the other going
whining away, &amp;c.
            Fourthly, He that was sped first in the Fish-poole, and had his
pretension, left the rest sad and enuying his good fortune. So likewise in
Court, hee that obtaines his pretension, causes such a sadnesse in the rest,
that for many moneths after, all is cries and complaints, lamenting and
finding fault with the inequality of the times, and how strangely things are
carried, Hand (as they say) ouer head. He that pretends a Captains place, the
gouernment of a Garrison Towne, or the keeping of a Fort, frets and fumes, when
he knowes he hath done the State good seruice in the Warres, to see a Carpet
Knight, that can better vse a Violl than a Sword, lead a measure with a Ladie
than a Band of men, be preferred, and himselfe put by. So is it with your good
Schollers, when they see Dunces carrie away their preferments from them: And so
with the like, &amp;c.
            Fiftly, One Angell onely mooued the waters of the Fish-poole; but
those waters of the Court, many Angells, or, to speake more properly, many
Deuils must mooue them; and when one fauours, foure disfauour them: one mooues
here, but many there trouble the waters; &amp; to make so many mens wils to
tremble, is a grieuous torment. Abimileck the bastard sonne of
Gideon,
               
                  Iudges 9. desirous to
tyrannise the gouernment of Israell, alledged this reason to those of Sichem,
Which seemeth better vnto you, That the seuentie sonnes of Gideon
should rule ouer you, or one onely? And, which is the easier of the two, to
submit a mans will to seuentie wils, or to one will only? King Achish
out of this respect thrusts Dauid out of his Court; For myne owne part
(said he) I like thee well enough, Sed Satrapis non placis, (i.)
But thou art not pleasing to the Princes. In Court, a man must crowch
and creepe to many: Happie is that man that negotiates with God, there is but
one care to be taken, one onely good will to bee got. According to that of
Tertullian, Vnum negotium mihi est, neque aliud curo. Gregorie N
                     •
                  zianzen addeth, That God beeing
Vnus &amp; solus, One, and onely one, to shew his sole command ouer
vs; so did he also assume many names to himselfe, to giue vs thereby to
vnderstand, that he was willing to affoord vs many fauours. Whereas the Deuill
takes a contrarie course; for hee inuented many gods to commaund in the world,
but not any to doe them good.
            Sixtly, In the Fish-poole men had their healths giuen them for
nothing, so that it cost not the sicke one farthing: dealing with the Patient,
as Heauen doth with the Penitent; who when he desires to embarke himselfe for
that place, giues him his passage in the Ship of Repentance, free, and gratis,
Gratis venundati estis, &amp; sine argento redimemin
                     •
                  , Yee were sould freely, and yee shall be redeemed
without monie. Hee is a kind Master of a Ship, who shall giue a man his
fare for nothing: Our Sauiour Christ would aske no more of this sicke man, than
his desire and willingnesse to be whole; [Vis sanus

                     •
                  iers?] but in the Court,
before thou commest to the Fiat of thy pretension, thou hast eaten
out thy cloake, and it is wonder, if the courtesie quit the cost.
            Seuenthly, The Angell that came to the Fi
                  •
               h-poole (as all the Commentators 
vpon this place haue it) was one and the same, no accepter of persons, but left
euerie one to his owne diligence and industrie; and hee that could soonest get
into the water, he was the man that was cured. Had he been an Angel of court,
(as he was of Heauen) he must haue beene aduised some houres before his
comming, of the businesse, and peraduenture he would haue taken gifts and
rewards not onely of those that were to haue their estate bettered by him, but
of al other the Pretenders. And it were no ill councell, that there should be
but one onely in Court, that should heale vs in this case, and not to haue them
so often changed; for those which are put out remain fat and full, and those
that newly come in, weake and hunger-staru'd. And as those Flies that are
alreadie full doe lesse afflict the wounds of the Poore; so, &amp;c.
Baruch tells vs, That the Iewes that were in Babylon sent great store
of money to those that were in Ierusalem, that they should pray vnto God for
the life of Nabucadonazzar &amp; Balthazar his son: And
though this may seeme rather a tricke of Court, than otherwise, and to sauour
of flatterie; yet that which makes for our porpose, is, That they did desire
the life of those Tirants, for feare lest God should send them worse in their
stead. The like was spoken by a woman, to Dyonisius the Tyrant, whose
death was generally desired of all.
            
               Angelus autem Domini descendebat de Caelo.
               
                  But the Angell of the Lord came downe from Heauen. The
  Angell did descend at certaine times, and with onely touching the Water, hee
  did inrich it with so powerfull a vertue, that no infirmitie was incurable for
  it. This water doth much expresse that health which the Saints enioy in Heauen:
  that drop of water which the rich man desired, doth much expresse its comfort
  and happinesse, for that the tip of the least finger dipped therein, was
  powerful enough to quench those euerlasting flames. It was much, that the
  water touched by the Angell should free all infirmities, and take away all the
  tormenting paines vpon earth; but how much (I pray) if this Angell were God?
  For the common receiued opinion is, (which is followed by Saint
  Austen) That God representing himselfe in the Old Testament in the
  forme of an Angell, or an Angell appearing in the person of God,
                     Gen. 12. Gen. 15. Gen. 18.
  saith, Ego Deus, nomen meum Iehouah, I am God, my name is Iehouah. And
  he said vnto Iacob, Cur quaeris nomen meum, quod est mirabile? Why
  inquirest thou aft
                        ••
                      my name, which
  is is Wonderfull? And in verie deed, hardly could an Angell by his owne
  proper vertue and power, leaue the waters of the Fish-poole so rich, not being
  able to doe or vndoe any thing in nature, nor suddenly either to take away or
  adde accidents to any thing. And Saint Ambrose saith, That this Angell
  did represent the Holy Ghost, to whom are attributed the effects of
  Sanctification.
               But suppose that it were not God himsel
                     •
                  e, nor any Minister representing his person,Gods respect in comforting the destressed. but one of
  those Angells which serue as Messengers to his Maiestie; this case is worth our
  consideration, if we will but looke vpon that which Go
                     •
                   doth, and the loue which he sheweth to a poore sicke
  man, without helpe, negl
                     •
                  
                  cted, and
  forgotten: he sends a Prince of his Pallace to heale him, and to set hi
                     •
                   free from any disease whatsoeuer. God
  stileth the Angell, his Face, and his Countenance, [Praecedet te facies
  me
                        •
                     , My Face shall goe before
  him;] the rest of the creatures he calleth Vestigi
                        •
                      Pedum suorum, The prints of his
  feet: And amongst these Vestigia, those that are benumm'd in
  their limmes, those that are sicke of the Palsey, and those that are Iame,
  seeme, sitting in their chaires, and vnable to goe, to be the verie dregs and
  off-scumme of the earth; now that God should command his Angells, that they
  should take vpon them the care of the Poore, &amp; such 
  sillie wormes and poore snakes as they bee, is a great indeering of his loue
  towards them: which made Saint Paul to say, Omnes sunt
  administratorij Spiritus, They are all ministring Spirits. To those of the
  Spirit it might verie well be;
                     Heb. 2. but
  that God should minister helpe to filthie, loathsome, and miserable flesh, God
  could not endure to doe such kindnesses, vnlesse hee had an especiall loue vnto
  them. The Scripture scarce any where makes mention of the righteous man that is
  afflicted here vpon earth, but, that an Angel comes from Heauen to comfort
  him: And for this, may suffice that generall Proclamation, Quod vni ex
  minimis meis fecistis, &amp;c. What ye haue done to the least of mine,
  &amp;c. This truth is made good vnto vs by many Histories; as that of
  Agar, Daniel, Tobias, Elias, and Ioseph: Nay, to God
  himselfe an Angell came to comfort him, when he was so ful of sorrow and
  heauinesse in the Garden. And this was it that mooued the Apostle to say,
  Gloriamur in tribulationibus, We glorie in tribulations: For there is
  no Loadstone that drawes the yron more vnto it, than Tribulation doth the
  Regalos and comforts of Heauen: And as the flame
                     •
                  worketh most vpon that wood which is trodden downe with
  the feet; so the glorie of God worketh most vpon that heart which is most
  oppressed, &amp;c.
            
            
               
                  Mouebatur aqua, The water was mooued.
               Saint Ambrose obserueth, That the moouing of the water
  did serue to aduise the comming of the Angell: for little would his comming
  haue imported them, if the noyse thereof had not giuen them notice of it; for
  hidden treasure, and concealed wisedome, are neither vsefull nor profitable.
  And of this miraculous motion there may be rendred some naturall reason; for
  that wee see that your Lakes and your Pooles are more vnquiet, and naturally
  make more noyse, when there is much raine towards. Other literall and moral
  reasons are set down elsewhere vpon this place.

               A Fish-poole, Porches, Angells, Water, Motion; What a do is
  here? Some men may thinke, that this is too large a circuit for so small a
  building. I answer,
                     Ob. Sol.
                   That with God it
  is as hard to heale one, as many; and he that can cure one man,Gods mercie not so plentifull in the time of the Law, as
 since. who is a little world of himselfe, can with as much ease giue
  remedie to the greater. But those were barren yeares, and Gods mercie was yet
  in Heauen; [Misericordia Domini in Coelo, saith Dauid] and as
  before a great rain some few drops begin first to fall; so now at the stooping
  of the Heauens, at the breaking forth and showring vpon the earth the great
  mercies of God, it is no meruaile, that some small drops should precede. In
  barren yeres bread is giuen vs by ounces; but if the haruest be fruitfull,
  whole loaues lie in euerie corner of the house. Before that God had inriched
  the earth with his presence, all those former yeres were barren, Grace and
  Health were giuen vs by drammes; but that yeare came at last which crowned all
  the rest, that blessed yere of his Maiesties diuine bountie, Benedices
  coronae anni benignitatis tuae; then was Grace to the soule, and health to
  the bodie giuen vs, by Arrob's and by Quintalls; Quia virtus de
  illo exibat &amp; sanabat omnes. Whilest the night lasteth, though it be
  cleere, and the Moone shine bright, yet the light is short; but when the day is
  come, and the beames of the Sunne appeare, they beautifie the whole world with
  their light. All that time was night, Nox praecessit, &amp;c.
               
               Secondly, The shadow still comes short of the substance.The Poole a figure of Baptisme. The Fish-poole was a

   healed one, two, nay three thousand sometimes in one day,

               Qui prior descendebat.
               
                  He that first went downe. God would hereby teach vs
  what a thing Diligence was for the obtaining of the gifts of Grace; for albeit
  God doth of his owne goodnesse and free gift conferre his Graces vpon vs,
  without any merits or deseruings of our own (for else were it not Grace) yet
  doth he not bestow his blessings on those who are not willing to embrace them,
  which will not seeke after them, and striue for to winne the Garland, as those
  doe that runne in a race: and as he that makes most speed gaines the Crown; so
  in the Fish-poole, he that made most hast got his health.
               
                  He that first went downe. Vidisti hominem velocem stauit
  coram Reges, Kings neuer reward lazie seruants. The like course God
  taketh; his greatest fauors he throws vpon those his seruants who set not their
  feet on the ground; for those that serue him in Heauen, he will haue them to be
  Spirits, and Flames of

                  He that first went downe, &amp;c. This seemeth an
  vnequall Law, for that the disposition of the Sicke was not equall:God
 dispenceth his fauours as he pleaseth. for how could he that was
  benumm'd and lame of his feet, preuent the diligence of that man that had the
  vse of his leggs? and he that was consumed &amp; wasted with weaknesse, him
  that was sick of a slighter disease? And those thirtie eight yeares of this
  poore sicke man, argue the great oddes that others had of him. Nor doe I know
  how this inequality may bee salued, vnlesse that the diligence of other folkes
  towards those that are thus grieuously afflicted, put to their helping hand,
  and seeke to ballance them (by their diligence) with those that haue lesse
  impediment: and therefore wanting those good meanes, this poore man told our
  Sauiour, Hominem non habeo, I haue not a man.
               
               Some men will say, That God is the giuer of temporall blessings,
  of health, wealth, honour, and what not; and that he doth no wrong in giuing or
  taking them away as he shall thinke fit: Suting with that which he said to the
  Labourer in the Vineyard, Amice, non facio tibi iniuriam; An non licet mihi
  facere quod volo? Friend, I offer thee no wrong; May I not doe with myne owne
  what I will? So that hee might, you see, giue this man a disposition to
  regaine his health, and hee might likewise not giue it him. Saint Paul
  saith, Vnus accipit brauium, One receiued the prize. In those your
  Races which were vsed amongst your Graecians and your Romans, many hoped to
  beare away the Garland; but this hope did belie all of them saue one: But in
  that Race which we runne for Heauen, Omnes qui rectè currunt
  comprehendunt, All that runne well, doe gaine; it is Saint
  Augustines. And Saint Chrysostome declaring that place of
  Esay (Omnes sitientes, venite ad Aquas, All ye
                        •
                      that thirst, come vnto the
  Waters) sayes, That hee animates all the world to come and drinke their
  fill, neuer fearing that that Fountaine of Grace can euer bee drawne drie.
            
            
               Et erat homo triginta &amp; octo annos habens in
  infirmitate.
               
                  The man had beene diseased thirtie eight yeares. Hee
  declares the long continuance of his disease, to make the greatnesse of the
  miracle to appeare the more: as he said of Lazarus,
                  
                     Luke 8. when he had now beene foure dayes dead,
  Iam faetet, Hee doth alreadie stinke: and of the woman that had an
  Issue of bloud twelue yeares long, which had spent all her substance vpon
  Physitions, and could not be healed of  any: and that
  other, which had a Spirit of infirmitie eighteene yeares, and was bowed
  together, and could not lift vp her selfe in any wise:
                     Luke 13. Whom some interpret to be the Deuill, by
  those words of our Sauiour, This daughter of Abraham, whom Sathan hath
  bound.
               
               Eight and thirtie yeares of sickenesse would require eight and
  thirtie yeares of meditation: And first of all, let vs consider, what a sad and
  miserable life this poore man led. Animus gaudens floridam vitam facit,
  spiritus tristis exsiccat ossa, A merrie life makes a cheerefull
  countenance▪ but that which is sad and mournfull withereth the
  flesh; and not onely consumes the outward beautie, but also rotteth the
  bones. Another Letter hath it, Animus gaudens benefacit medicina,
                  
                     Prou. 17. 
                  A ioyfull heart causeth good health;
  but a sorrowfull mind drieth the bones: A joccond mind disposeth the body
  as physicke; nor is there any physicke for man comparable to that of Ioy.
  According to that which the Wise man saith in another place, Nihil aliud
  sub Coelo, quam laetari &amp; benefacere, To make a cheerefull countenance,
  there is nothing vnder Heauen like to a ioyefull heart;
                     Prou. 15. but by the sorrow of the heart the mind
  is heauie, In moerore animi deijcitur spiritus; another Letter giues
  it, Frangitur: a man is broken thereby, and grownd in pieces as corne
  vnder a millstone. Ecclesiasticus renders the reason of it, painting
  forth the condition of a heauy and sorrowfull soule; Sicut in percursura
  tritici permanebit stercus, &amp;c. As when one sifteth, the filthinesse
  remaineth in the sieue; so the filth of a man remaineth in his
  thought:
                  
                     Eccl. 27. For as the woman that
  winnoweth the corne, leaues nothing in the sieue but the chaffe; (which is as
  it were farinae stercus, The dung of the meale) so, if you will but
  sift the thought of a sorrowfull man, (which is as it were the sieue) and
  throughly winnow his good and euill dispositions, the good ones quickly runne
  from him, and the bad remaine behind. But what ioy can a man take that lieth
  bed-ridden eight and thirtie yeares?Sorrow, a sharpe sword.
 3. Kings 19. A great griefe (though but short) will kill the
  strongest man aliue, [Multos enim occidit tristitia, Sorrow hath killed
  many] and though it doth not giue them present death, it giues them a
  heart to desire it. Elias found himselfe so out of heart when he sate
  him downe vnder the Iuniper tree in the Wildernesse, (flying from the furie of
  Iesabel, who sought after his life) that he desired in this his
  melancholly mood, that hee might die. What despaire then may not that sorrow
  driue a wretched poore soule into, whose griefe is as long, as great, and as
  great as it is long? Seneca tells vs, Melius est semel scindi,
  quam semper premi, Better is a short, than a lingering death. Iob passed
  ouer many a sorrowfull day, and many a mournfull night, Dies vacuos, &amp;
  noctes laboriosas, Companilesse, and comfortlesse; and his wife thinking
  it the lesser ill, to die out of hand, than to liue in such perpetuall torment;
  said vnto him, pittying his grieuous paine, Benedic Deo, &amp; morere;
  Play the Renegado once, curse God to his face, that thou maist oblige him
  thereby to take away thy life. But say that Iobs affliction was
  great, it was not of 38 yeares standing, as this poore mans was.
               
                  Eight and thirtie yeares. Here we are to consider, That
  this sicke man was at least fiftie yeares old: and we may make this coniecture,
  That hee lay in a little carre, with his bed vnder him, together with such
  ragges and clouts as were for his necessarie vse. Whence it followeth, that God
  had laid this long sickenesse of thirtie eight yeares vpon him for his sinnes,
  as Saint Chrysostome, Irenaeus, and many other Saints inferre, vpon
  that command which God laid vpon him, Noli amplius peccare, See thou sinne
  no more. It seemeth, that hee had committed these sinnes when he was but
  twelue yeares old; for many times [Praeuenit malicia peccatum] it so
  falls out, that our wickednes outstrips our age, and that wee runne into great
  sinnes, before wee come to great yeares; young Youthes beeing 
   herein like vnto Cakes that are baked vpon coles, which
  are burnt before they come to their baking.
                     Ose.
 7. According to that of Osee, Factus es Ephraim, subcineritius panis
  qui non reuersatur, (i.) Ephraim is as a Cake on the hearth, not
  turned. And this ought to be a warning-piece to those that are old and
  antient sinners, and haue not yet beene questioned for their lewd liues, nor
  neuer felt the lash of Gods wrath. They that keepe Lyons, vse to whip their
  young whelpes, that they may make the greater Lyons to feare, and liue in awe
  of them: Fewer are the faults, but more the stripes which the Poore feele; a
  bad signe for the Rich, that doe runne ryot. Aristotle saith, That
  punishments were inuented for the deterring of men from euill. Saint
  Chrysostome, That the marke which God set vpon Cain, was not
  so much for his particular defence, as for a forewarning to others: and
  therefore God granted him so long a life, that his example might adde terrour
  to posteritie. Some punishments are quickely past ouer, and therefore doe not
  so much good; and others are verie profitable, by reason of their length &amp;
  continuance. Iob saith, That God had as it were nailed his shafts on
  his sides, they stucke so close to his ribs. Esay and
  Malachie take their comparison from the Siluersmith, who sits long at
  his worke, Et sedebit constans, &amp;c. Now God by these his long
  afflictions punisheth him whom he loueth, to the end that the sinner may take
  warning thereby, and learne to feare the Lord; Non videbit interitum,
  cu
                        •
                      viderit Sapientes
  morientes, (i.) He shall not see destruction, when he shall see that
  Wisemen die.
               
               
                  Eight and thirtie yeares. According to the common
  course which God taketh of punishing sinne in this life,Why
 God sometimes prolongs our paines here in this life. this of thirtie
  eight yeares seemeth somewhat too rigorous a correction. Vpon this doubt
  diuers reasons are rendered, and one more principall than the rest, is, That
  this prolongation was not because God wished him ill, or loued him the lesse;
  but because there is not any Medicine that preserues a man more from the
  plague of vice and of sinne, than a long sickenesse. Prisons and Fetters (saith
  Vlpianus) were not so much inuented for the punishing of disorders, as
  the restraining of them: being as a great logge of wood to an vntamed and
  vnruly Hey far, a strap to the fleet Hound, or a bridle to a Horse.
  Iob calleth the Gout, a paire of Stockes, Posuisti in trunco pedem
  meum, Thou puttest my feet in the Stockes, and lookest narrowly to all my
  paths, and makest the print thereof in the heeles of my feet. And he
  stiles his dunghill, his prison, Nunquid Caete ego sum, aut Mare, quia
  circumdedisti me in isto carcere? Am I a Sea, or a Whale-fish, that thou
  keepest me in ward? Our Sauiour Christ healing a woman that bowed her
  bodie so downward to the earth, that shee could not looke vp to heauen; said,
  Hanc filiā Abrahae quam, &amp;c. Ought not this daughter of Abraham whom
  Sathan hath bound eighteene yeares, be loosed from this bond? Salomon
  compares a Physition to a Iaylor; for when God commits a delinquent to his
  couch, causing him there to remaine prisoner, hauing fettered, as it were, his
  feet to his sheets; the Physition lookes vnto him, and hath a care that hee
  stirre not from thence till God releaseth him of his sickenesse. Thus did hee
  deale with this poore man▪ who lay thirtie eight yeres, as it were, by the
  heeles, vnable to wagge either han
                     •
                  
  or foot, so strangely was he benumm'd in all his limmes. Some man will say,

                   haue a shrewd burning Feuer;
  but this is a more common, than proper phrase o
                     •
                   speech. And the Euangelist corrects it thus, Socrus autem
  Petri tenebatur mag
                        ••

                  ▪ With the bridle of
  Sickenesse he will hold thee backe, that thou maist not headlong r
                     •
                  n down the Rocke that leads to vtter
  destruction both of bodie &amp; soule. Homer feignes, That the
  Goddesse Pallas, for the loue which she bare to Achilles, 
                   kept him backe, when he would haue encountred with
  Agamemnon King of the Greekes. Dauid gaue thankes to
  Abigal, because he beeing resolued to destroy Nabal and all
  his house, she had withheld him from it; Qu
                        •
                     a prohibuisti me, &amp;c. So may we likewise giue thankes vnto
  sickenesse, because it detaines vs &amp; turns vs aside from the forbidden
  paths of humane pleasures: so that these thirtie eight yeares are so farre from
  the rigour of Iustice, that it is rather an act of mercie and pittie.
               But if we consider these thirtie eight yeares in reason of
  Iustice, it will not seeme rigorous to any: He is not to be accoun
                     •
                  ed an austere &amp; seuere Iudge, who
  doth keepe a Delinquent long in prison; if when he is in prison hee returne to
  a relapse in his delicts: What hope can a Iudge haue, that such a one should
  proue good being set at liberty? or of a theef that shal fal a stealing while
  he is in prisō? Now this man that had neither hand nor foot to help himselfe,
  lying benum'd in his little cart, bore before him the cause of his griefe, by
  falling into those faults which he had formerly committed. And this is inferred
  out of these our Sauiours words vnto him, Iam noli amplius peccare, Now
  see thou sinne no more.
                  
                     Ob.
                   But if any
  man aske me, How can that man sinne that is bound hand and foot? I answer,
                     Sol.
                   That for all this, his desires and thoughts
  are not fettered. Iniquitatem medi
                     
                        •
                     atus est in cubili suo, astitit omni viae non bonae, Hee that
  applies himselfe to euill thoughts, and hath a desire vnto them, there is not
  that wickednesse whereof he would not reap the fruits thereof. From whence I
  cannot but note out these two things vnto thee:
               The one, That the sinnes of our thoughts and imaginations are of
  all other the easiest to be done. How many Kniues would a Cutler make in a day,
  if he could finish them without a Forge, an Anuile, or a Hammer? Questionlesse,
  
                     •
                  erie many. The like reason is to
  be rendred of the errors of our thoughts.
               The other, That they are the harder to be seene or holpen: To be
  seene, for that they are so secret, Ab occultis meis munda me, Clense me,
  ô Lord, from my secret sinnes. To be holpen; for as he that is still
  kept hungrie and thirstie, hath neither his thirst nor his hunger satisfied,
  but encreaseth more and more vpon him; so
  
                     •
                  e that neuer enioyes those humane
  delights, neuer hath the hunger and thirst of his desires satisfied.
               So that this poore sicke man perseuering in his sinne, it is not
  much that God should perseuer in his punishments: for our shorter sinnes, Gods
  chastisements 
                     •
                  re also short,
  In momento indignationis auerte faciem meam parumper,

                        ••
                     ō the house of him that sweareth
  much: whence it cōmeth to passe, that so many are
  
                     •
                  arr'd, and so few amended: Which
  is all one with that of Ieremie, Dissipati, ne

  Martyrs, who suffer not onely without a reward, (as Saint Paul saith,
  Si peccantes suffertis, quid vobis est gratiae?) but treasure vp new
  torments vnto themselues.
               But some one will aske, How comes it to passe, that this man
  being a sinner,
                     Ob.
                   which waited at the
  Fish-poole, our Sauiour should for his sake leaue other iust
  
                     •
                  nd good men, and make choice to
  come vnto him?
               First, (as I haue told you alreadie) because Sicknesse
  preserueth the soule from

 profitable to our selues.
               
               Secondly, Because this poore wretch did hope to be healed, his
  thoughts and 
                     •
                  is hopes laying hold
  vpon Gods fauour towards him, with a strong and assured
  
                     •••
                  iance: and this was that which
  this sicke man did purposely seeke after.
               
                  
                  Euthimius doth much endeere his
  sufferance and his perseuerance, neuer despairing, but assuring himselfe, that
  Heauen would yet at last bee propitious and fauourable vnto him: and though
  yeare after yeare, nay, for so many yeres together, he found no good, (many
  contradictions offering themselues vnto him) yet his hopes did neuer faile him.
  His sinnes were rather accessorie and accidentall, than of any proposed malice,
  or in despight (as we say) of God; and such kind of faults as these, God sooner
  pardoneth and farre more easily forgiueth. The Scripture sometimes proposeth
  vnto vs Peccadores remitados, Notorious sinners, to whose account you
  cannot adde one sinne more than they haue charged themselues withall: Who
  haue purposely departed from God: Of these Iob saith, Quasi
  de industria recesserunt à me. Esay, Pepigimus faedus cum m

                  2. Kings 6.Others there are
  who sinne by accident. In the Historie of the Kings it is said of
  Dauid, That he arose vp from his chaire, to walke vpon the Tarrasse of
  his Pallace, and that his eye lighted by chance vpon Bersheba, who was
  bathing her selfe in her garden: this was a businesse which fell out casually,
  and (as we say) by hap-hazard, though his plotting how to haue his pleasure of
  her was a thing premeditated; but his seeing and his coueting of her was, as
  it were, accidentally, and by chance. Whereas the desire that Dauid
  had to serue God, was euer purposed and determined by him [Iuraui &amp;
  statui custodire iudicia justiciae tuae.
                  1.
 Kings 14.] So that his offending of his God was not wilful, but
  of weaknes &amp; by meere haphazard. Saul made a Proclamation, That
  no man should eat till hee had gotten the victorie ouer the Philistines; but
  the souldiers were so hungrie with sighting and fasting, that their minds ran
  on nothing else saue the stanching of their hunger; Et comedit populus cum
  sanguine, The people tooke Sheepe, and Oxen, and Calues, and slew them on the
  ground, and did eat them, with the bloud, (which was contrarie to Gods
  commandement) not considering, that this their eating at this time, and vpon
  such an occasion, was peccatum per accidens, an accidentall sinne. In
  a word, one of the surest pledges of our predestination, is, to make our
  seruing of God the Principall, and our offending him, the Accessorie.

 will.
                  When the Lord had seene him. This his seeing of him was
  not by chance, nor is it so to be construed of Christ; but to shew that he was
  man, hee did many things as it were by chance: And therefore when he saw this
  mans miserie, and knew how long he had layne thus, and how he was forsaken of
  all the world, and that there was no bodie to helpe him, then, &amp;c.
               
                  A weeping Eye causeth a bleeding
 heart.It is a great matter (I can assure you) for a man to cast his eyes
  vpon the wretched estate of the Poore; for from the eyes compassion, growes
  the hearts tendernesse; the one is no sooner toucht, but the other melts.
  Noli auertere faciem tuam ab vllo paupere, Turne not away thy face from the
  Poore. Tobias told his sonne, That if he should not turne his eye aside
  from the Poore, God would neuer turn away his face from him. The sores of the
  Poore (saith Saint Chrysostome) being beheld by vs, teach, aduise, and

  him, cried out, Away with him, away with him: whereas if they had
  earnestly beheld him, and viewed him wel from top to toe, their hearts, had
  they beene of stone, (as they were little better) they would 
   haue growne soft and tender with it. The reason why so
  little remedie now a dayes is giuen to humane miserie, is, because the Princes
  and Potentates of the earth doe not see them. Though God had sent downe one of
  his Angells, yet this diseased man continued vncured thirtie eight yeares, and
  if God had not come himselfe to helpe him, he might haue died of that
  sickenesse. When our necessities shew themselues, they speake, though we be
  silent: What need Lazarus to beg, as long as his sores had so many
  tongues and mouths to sue for him? Domine vidisti, ne sileas, responde pro
  me, Why shouldst thou looke, ô Lord, that I should speake vnto thee?
  doost thou not see in what a wofull case I am? In matter of prouisions or
  conferring of pensions, albeit that the persons that pretend say not a word for
  themselues, yet their merits and good deseruings will sufficiently recommend
  their cause, and plead hard for them: which if it were otherwise, it were
  better to bee a cogging lying knaue, than a religious and modest Courtier; for
  he shall speed the better of the two. Two pretend one and the selfe same place;
  the one sues, extolls his seruices, and lyes; the other sayes nothing, but
  lookes that his merits and good seruices should speake for him: In Babylon,
  which is a confusion of Tongues, it shall bee giuen to the loudest talker; but

  Physitions and Surgeons, when they goe about to cure loathsome sores,
  Leaprosies, Scurfes, Cankers, and the like, to put their Patients to a great
  deale of pain: Eusebius and Gregorie Nazianzen affirme, That
  our Sauiour Christ did farre exceed all other Physitions.

  Austen saith, That he had made triall in himselfe of two contrarie
  wills; one which led him on to Vice; another, to Vertue: as one that is forced
  to rise, and yet would faine lie a bed; Vertue crying out to him on the one

  Quis est homo qui vult vitam? Diligit dies habere bonos? Who is he that

  Slaue, after he hath endured many yeares of seruitude, is so farre from
  desiring his liberrie, that he scarce thinkes vpon it; the Oxe vsed to the
  yoke, willingly submits himselfe vnto it; an old Souldier will neuer goe
  without his Armes; and therefore Tullie calls them, Militum
  Membra, A Soldiers Limmes; for through vse, they are no more troublesome

  whither he were willing to be healed, or no? O, what a noble proceeding was
  this in our Sauiour, that hee would first aske our good will! All other humane
  goods God giues and takes away as hee sees fit, without asking our consent; but
  hee is willing to aske here of this sicke man, his good wil, for that there is
  nothing so much ours, as that. Fili praebe mihi cor tuum, My sonne giue me
  thy heart: alwaies considering this with himselfe, that for our
  condemnation, our owne wil is Causa positiua, the positiue cause thereof;
  [Perditio tua ex te Israel] but for our justification, it is causa
  sine qua non, we cannot be saued without it. And to this purpose tend
  those remarkable words of Saint Augustine, Qui creauit te sine te, non
  saluabit te sine te, He that made thee without thee, will not saue thee
  without thee: So that our will, though it be not the principall cause of
  our good, yet is it the chiefest cause of our ill. Two Moores that are Slaues,
  the one desires his libertie, the other, his captiuitie; the will of the latter
  is the positiue cause of his hurt, and the will of the former doth him no good,

  Pharaoh asking Iacob, how old hee was, he told him, That the
  whole time of his pilgrimage was an hundred and thirtie 
  yeares; that few and euill had the dayes of his life beene; and that hee had
  not attained to the yeares of the life of his fathers, in the dayes of their
  pilgrimages. Elias fled from death, when hee saw how neere
  Iezabels hand was to take his life from him, howsoeuer vnder the
  Iuniper tree hee seemed much to desire it. Vpon Paradise God had put a strange
  gard, not onely a blade of a sword, shaken, to keepe the way of the Tree of
  Life; but many Cherubins also, that were like so many flames of fire. What,
  ô Lord, doost thou meane by this so powerful a gard for so cowardly and
  feareful a creature as man? O sir, in Paradise there is a Tree that beares the
  fruit of Life, and out of the desire that man hath to liue, he will presse vpon
  the swords point, and rush through fire and water to get in: And though a lesse
  gard might happely serue turn in regard of man; yet wil it not suffice to keepe
  the Deuill out; and if he should chance to rob this tree of her fruit, he would
  carrie the whole world after him, out of the great loue and affection that they
  haue vnto Life. Saint Augustine greatly endeering this loue, saith,
  That it were a great happinesse for man, if he bore but that loue to life
  eternall, as he doth to this that is temporall; and that he would but labour
  as much to obtaine that, as he seeketh to conserue this. But this poore
  wretched man indeeres it much more, who at the end of thirtie eight yeares,
  hauing led a life that was worse than death, should yet desire to liue
  longer.

  his eye vpon thee, &amp; begins to looke towards thee; for the onely meanes to
  make God to fauor vs, is, when he sees the World hath forgot vs. The cause why
  so many suitors thriue no better, is, because they seeke more after the fauour
  of men, than of God: Where Nature casts vs off, there Grace takes vs vp; when
  the World abandoneth vs, then God embraceth vs. The Rauens young ones are
  forsaken by her, and God feedeth them. In the Indies there are no Physitions,
  yet are there wholsome Hearbes wherewith they cure their diseases. In like
  manner, where the World affoordeth few fauours, there Gods prouidence supplies
  vs with many. Chrysostome saith, Non habes hominem, sed Deum, Thou

  was sicke of a Feuer, and could not follow them; Dauid finding him as
  he followed the chase, tooke him vp and cherished him. Saint Gregorie
  noteth, That it is the fashion of the World, to forsake those that will not
  follow after it: whereas God runnes a contrarie course; for he cherisheth and
  fauoureth those whom the World forsaketh. Saint Austen ponders much
  vpon Iosephs two yeares being in prison, expecting the fauour of
  Pharaohs seruant, to whom he had recommended his suit; so that as
  long as he depended vpon man, he was suspended by God: but when his hopes were
  that way vtterly lost, and was now able to say▪

  (sweet Iesu) hadst not a man to fauour thee, yet thou foundst a man that gaue
  his bloud, and his life for them. Ecce homo; Lo, thou wast the man,
  that show'dst such great kindnesse, to those that vsed thee so vnkindly. Thou
  (poore Soule) hast not an Angell to mooue the Fish-poole for thee; Ecce
  homo, behold the man, who makes more hast to helpe thee than an
  Angell.
               
                  Hominem non habeo. Why doost thou complaine, that thou
  hast not a man to helpe thee? Why doost thou not rather complaine that thou
  doost relye and trust vpon man? He does like himselfe in deceiuing thee; but
  thou doost not like thy selfe in presuming vpon him. Many complaine of the
  world, and the deceits therof; but doe not complaine of the foolish confidence
  which themselues put in this false world. I complaine of Fortune, that she is
  mine enemie, but not of my selfe, who sue to so fickle a Dame, and so earnestly
  importune her. Night, is the embleme of the world, and of a false friend. In
  the day, all communicate and conuerse together, but at night, they take their
  leaue and get them gone. In prosperitie, all the whole world will fawne vpon
  thee, and keepe thee companie; but in aduersitie no man will looke vpon thee,
  but will shunne thee, and turne his face from thee. If thou wilt experiment,
  what power thou hast with the world, and how much thou canst preuaile with it,
  necessitie will instruct thee. That friend which shall alwayes lye vnto thee,
  in whom thou neuer findest truth, it is thine owne folly that deceiues thee, if
  thou trust him, it is not he. And therefore he that now and then treateth
  truth, is the more dangerous of the two. In Deutronomie, God
  commaundeth,
                     Deut. 13. That if there arise
  amongst his people a Prophet, or a Dreamer of dreames, and giue thee a signe or
  wonder, and the signe &amp; the wonder which he hath told thee come to passe,
  that Prophet, or Dreamer of dreames shall bee slaine. But he doth not commaund,
  that hee shall be slaine if it doe not come to passe. For hee that alwaies
  lyes, doth no hurt at all; The world hath beene a notorious lyer these fiue
  thousand yeeres, and more; and therefore I doe not see, what reason thou hast
  to thinke, that it will now keepe it's word better with thee than it hath with
  others heretofore.
               
                  Hominem non habeo, I haue not a man. This is not onely
  a complaint of the poore, but of powerfull persons, and those that are riche,
  who because they haue not the happinesse to haue a man to sticke close vnto
  them, that may direct and counsaile them, passe ouer this their life in
  distraction, and perdition, &amp; in the end loose both life and soule.
  Homo, homini Deus, homo homini lupus, Man is a God to man, Man is a wolfe
  to man. Expressing in the one, a prudent and vertuous man, one that is
  stayd and well settled: In the other, one that is light, inconstant, and
  false-hearted.
               Commonwealths vse likewise to complaine; as also those that are
  iealous of their goods, that they cannot meete with a man whom they may trust.
  Theodoret sayth, That hee offers a great, and a mightie wrong vnto
  Gods prouidence, who complaineth hereof. For that Commonwelth that prouides it
  selfe of feete, should not leaue it selfe without a head: and stooping so low
  as mans brest, for those more painefull and base occupations, as the Scauinger,
  the Cobler, and the hangman; they should likewise haue a care of placing fit
  men in places of a higher na
                     •
                  ure,
  that are to order businesses of State, and to cleanse a Kingdome of those
  filthie dunghils and sinkes of sinne which annoy a Commonwealth.
               This hurt (I meane when base and vnworthie persons gouerne a
  State) ariseth  from those two grounds; The one, The
  making choice of such men who by good and euill meanes (making no great
  difference of either) seeke for preferrement, and out of their ambition, would
  rather die than loose it. And when hee is thus preposterously preferred and put
  in place of authoritie, hee playes Rex, putting in one, and putting
  out another, &amp; so as hee may raise himselfe to honor, cares not whom he
  disgraces and treads vnder foot, though they bee ten times better men, and
  worthier than himselfe. Moses by Gods appointment made choice of
  seuentie Elders of Israell to assist him in the gouernment of the People; and
  they being one day to meet at a certaine houre before the Tabernacle, to the
  end that God in the presence of all the people might put his Spirit of
  prophecie vpon them, there remained two behind among the Host, to wit,
  Eldad and Medad; &amp; because God is not confined to any set
  place, the Spirit likewise rested vpon them, and they prophecied in the Host.
  Ioshuah thought this was a disreputation to Moses, that these
  two should prophecie without especiall order from him, insomuch that he
  persuaded him that hee should forbid them to prophecie any more. This is a
  true picture of the course &amp; fashion of this present World, which will by
  no meanes admit of any Ministers of State, but such as they themselues shall
  nominate, or (as if they were creatures of their making) shall wholly depend
  vpon them. But the Spirit of God made answer vnto Ioshuah by the
  mouth of Moses, Quid aemularis pro me? Enuiest thou for my sake? and
  addeth anon after, Would to God all the Lords people were Prophets, and that
  the Lord would put his Spirit vpon them. So that men are neuer wanting for to
  gouern a Commonwealth, but eys of charitie and discretion, to distinguish of
  those that are fit, and to make a good and iudicious choice.
            
            
               Tolle grabatum tuum &amp; ambula.
               
                  Take vp thy bed and walke. Our Sauiour here commands
  him, That he should shake off his former idlenesse and sloathfulnesse. Hora
  surgendi: My son (saith Ecclesiasticus) hast thou slept long in
  sinne,
                     Eccle. 21. awake and rouse vp thy
  selfe, and doe so no more, but pray for thy foresinnes, that they may be
  forgiuen thee. The second thing to be noted, is, That our Sauiour said vnto
  him, Arise, take vp thy bed and walke: one maine reason whereof was,
  That it might appeare that new strength was put into him, being growne able on
  the sudden to beare his bed vpon his backe. The other, That none might presume
  that it was the Angell that had wrought this cure vpon him. Thirdly, To take
  all cauelling from the enuious, for the disauowing of this miracle; and that
  the World might praise and publish the same: Vt miraculum videretur
  (saith Saint Augustine) &amp; nemo sim
                        •
                     
                     latum opinaretur. For this cause
  he willed those baskets of broken bread &amp; meat to be kept, when hee fed so
  many thousands with so little prouision. And him that he healed of his
  Leaprosie, that hee should go and present himselfe to the Priests: Taking the
  like course with diuers others, holding them as necessarie diligences for the
  auerring of these his miracles, considering what a captio
                     ••
                   and incredulous kind of people he was to deale
  withall.
            
            
               Et statim factus est sanus homo ille.
               
                  And presently the man was made whole. It is an easie
  thing with God, to inrich him that is poore in an instant. Vpon one only
  Dixit in the creation, presently followed a Facta sunt. Creauit
  omnia simul, He created all things at once (saith Wisdome;) so
  in the reparation of this poore man▪ it is said, Statìm sanus
  factus est homo ille, He was presently made whole. He said vnto
  Martha, Resurget frater tuus, Thy  brother shall rise
  againe; Whereunto she answered, I know that he shall rise againe in the
  resurrection at the last day. Christ might take this ill, as a wrong done vnto
  the loue which he bare to Lazarus, That shee should thinke him so
  neglectfull of his friend, as to let his fauor towards him be so long in
  comming. Saint Chrysostome saith, That your bad Physitions are the
  Butchers of a Commonwealth; and your good, the Botchers of mans life, who patch
  and mend it, making this fleshie cloathing of ours, and this our rotten
  carkasse, to hold out as long as it can. But God, who is his Arts-master, and a
  wondrous nimble Workman, made this sicke man so perfectly whole, and so
  instantly strong, that hee was able to take his bed vpon his backe and walke.
  And if by this he shewed, that hee did now fully enioy health of bodie; in his
  going streightway to the Temple, hee made good proofe of his Soules health.
  Which is no more than what S. Austen doth infer vpon those words which
  our Sauiour afterwards said vnto him, Now sinne no more, &amp;c.
               
               Saint Augustine vpon this our Sauiours healing of this
  man alone, saith,
                     Ob.
                   That herein he seemed
  somewhat too sparing and too niggardly to those other that had need of his
  helpe.
               Wherunto I answer first of all, That for those things which our
  Sauior Christ did, or did not, the wit of man cannot be a competent Iudge.
                     Sol.
                  
               
               Secondly, That this was a meere act of his mercie, and not to be
  questioned. Besides, health perhaps to the rest might haue proued hurtful vnto
  them, though not to their bodies, yet to their soules.
               Thirdly, Tertullian saith, That the operation of the
  Fish-poole beeing now to cease and loose i
                     •
                  's vertue, That our Sauiour by curing him who was the
  longest &amp; the most sicke amongst them, gaue thereby an induction &amp;
  entrance to all that were sicke, to come and repaire to him for helpe: As if
  hee should haue sayd, He that desires to be made whole, from hence forward let
  him goe no more to the Fish-poole, nor stay there expecting the Angells
  comming; for when hee comes he heals but one at once; but come you all vnto me,
  &amp; I shal heale you al.
               
                  Tolle grabatum, Take vp thy bed. This would seeme to be
  too heauie a burthen for him: A man would haue thought that it had beene
  enough for him to haue beene punished with thirtie eight yeres keeping of his
  bed, without being put now at last to beare it on his backe. But if God can
  giue such great strength to so weake a man, that the burthen of his bedding
  seemes no weightier than a straw; the heuier it is, the lighter it is,
  especially if God shall put but the least helpe of his little finger thereunto,
  Da quod jubes, &amp; jube quod vis, Giue what thou commandest, and command
  what thou pleasest.
               
               Secondly, Christ here sets before vs a modell and pattern of
  true repentance;A patterne for Repentance. before,
  with a Iacebat, He lay all forlorn; now, with a Surge, he
  walkes sound &amp; vpright: before, he was torpens &amp; stupefactu
                        •
                     , benumm'd and stupefied; now he
  was in his ambulare, walke: before, his bed did beare him; and now hee
  beares his bed, Tolle grabatum tuum. This was to signifie, That he was
  to run a contrary course to that he did before, and to tread out the prints of
  his forepassed sinnefull life: So that (according to Chrysologus) that
  which heretofore was a witnesse of his
  
                     •
                  nfirmitie, shall henceforth be a
  testimonie of his health. Vniuersum eius stratum
  
                        •
                     ersasti in infirmitate eius,
  Thou turnedst his bed topsituruie, first this way, then
  
                     •
                  hat way, till thou hadst made it
  more easie for him. Thou changest (saith Gene
                     
                        •
                     rard) his weakenesse into strength, and his
  sicknesse into health; it was before, a
  
                     •
                  ick bed, now a sound one; before,
  a bed of sorrow, now of joy; before, a bed of sinne, now of teares.
               
                  This Miracle was the Fermentum
  &amp; Leuen of the death of our Sauior Christ; for, picking a quarell with him
  vpon this occasion, they resolued to kill him, and this their intention dayly
  encreased, as oft as they called to mind this action of his. And therefore he
  afterwards said vnto them (as Saint Iohn reports it in his seuenth
  Chapter) Vnum opus feci,
                  
                     Iohn 7.
                  &amp; omnes admiramini sanè, I haue done one worke, and yee all
  meruaile; I heale a poore sicke man on the Sabboth day, and yee all blesse
  your selues, as though I had a Deuill in me. This word Miramini is
  here taken in the worser sence; so Saint Chrysostome noteth it: For
  doing this so good a deed you take me to be a transgressour of the Law; but I
  shall prooue vnto you, that your accusation is vniust: Moyses dedit vobis
  Circumcisionem, non quia ex Moyses, sed ex patribus, &amp;c. Moses gaue you
  Circumcision, not because it is of Moses, but of the Fathers;
                     Iohn 7. and yee on the Sabboth day circumcise a
  man: Moses gaue it yee, but he was not the primarie and principall
  authour thereof; for before the Law of Moses was, was Circumcision.
  The Israelites had it ex patribus, of their forefathers; but because
  it ceased in the Desert, hee did afterwards restore it to it's former vse and
  vertue. The precept of the Sabboth was proper to the Law of Moses, he
  was the first that did institute it, till then it was not so strictly
  obserued. Now you your selues doe circumcise on the Sabboth day, (obseruing
  the precept of your antient Fathers) and yet for all this yee breake not the
  Law of Moses. If then a Ceremonie bee lawfull which is directed to the
  health of the Soule; Why shall not that be lawfull amongst you which cureth
  both soule and bodie? Yee are angrie with me, and seeke to kill me, because I
  haue made a man euerie whit whole vpon the Sabboth day, Quia totum hominem
  feci, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               Qui me sanum fecit.
               
                  He that made me whole, said vnto me, Take vp thy bed and
  walke. The Iewes being mightily incensed against our Sauiour for that
  which he had done, it beeing the Sabboth day, and a great feast with them;
  asked the poore man in an hot and angrie fashion, Who it was that bid him take
  vp his bed and walke? hee told them, Qui me sanum fecit, That it was
  Iesus, that had made him whole: A disease of thirtie eight yeares old, which
  neither Nature, Art, nor my good fortune could rid away from me, did yeeld and
  render vp it selfe in an instant to the empire of him that healed me; That his
  long lost strength and health, after so long an absence, returned presently
  backe againe at the sound of his voice, and comforting those his rotten bones,
  &amp; causing his canker'd and withered flesh to wax young againe, had banished
  all aches and whatsoeuer other diseases from his bodie; shall not I then obey
  him whom Sickenesse and Health doe thus obey? It seemeth this poore man had
  plaid the theefe, and stole this reason from Dauid, Nonnè Deo
  subiecta erit anima mea, quoniam ab ipso salutare meum▪ It is reason good,
  that I should subiect my selfe to God, because from his hand comes my
  saluation. Qui me sanum fecit, He that hath done me such a happinesse and
  such a blessing as none others can doe the like, but God, why should I not obey
  him as God?
            
            
               Eccè, sanus factus es.
               
                  Behold, thou art made whole, &amp;c. This man Christ
  afterwards met withall in the Temple,Things aboue the reach
 of reason ha
                        •
                     d to be
 beleeued. and said vnto him, Ecce, sanus factus es, Behold, thou art
  made whole. This word Ecce includes in it a thousand things: The
  first is, The greatnesse of this his fauour towards him; for there are some
  things so transcendent and beyond the reach of our reason, that they who enioy
  them do scarce beleeue them, they are so astonished and amased at them. When
  the Angell freed Peter out of  
                  Herods
  prison, and had led him along by the hand, till he had brought him out of the
  Citie, the Text saith, Existimabat se visum videre, He thought it had beene
  some dreame, or had seene some vision or strange apparition; and it was a
  great while after ere he was come to himselfe, so wonder-strucken was he with
  this his strange deliuerance. Secondly, This particle Ecce,
  expresseth the greatnesse of this poore mans obligation; as if it should bid
  him looke and behold how much hee was beholding vnto God, who had freed him
  from so desperate a disease. Cum enim augentur dona, rationes etiam
  crescunt donorum, (the saying is Saint Gregories) The greater
  kindnesses, the greater obligations. This therefore being so great a one,
  thou canst not chuse but thinke vpon this benefit, and continually beare it in
  mind. Homo cum in honore esset, non intellexit, Man when he was in honour
  vnderstood it not, [the Hebrew hath it, Non pernoctauit] hee did
  not consider well on the matter, he did not throughly weigh it, by meditating
  night and day on so great a good. Thirdly, This same Ecce serues him
  as a warning-piece, to put him in mind, that he is sound, but not secure; for
  if thou doost not looke well vnto thy selfe, and stand strongly vpon thy guard,
  thou maist fall from that health wherein now thou standest, and be worse than
  thou wert before.
            
            
               Ne deterius tibi contingat.
               
                  Least a worse thing happen vnto thee. What can bee
  worse than thirtie eight yeares of sickenesse? Yes, Hell is worse. S.
  Gregorie saith, That God is woo
                     •
                  t to commense the chastisement of heinous and long continued
  sinnes, in this li
                     ••
                  , and continueth
  them in that other; so that they are, as it were, an entrance into Hell, as it
  hapned to Herod, who slew those innocent Babes; to Antiochus,
  and others: These seeme to lie as yet but in soke, and in a preparation (as I
  may so terme it) to those perpetuall torments. To others, Hell comes de
  golpe, it snatches them away on a sudden ere euer they be aware of it.
  Ducunt in bonis dies suos, &amp; in puncto ad inferos descendunt, They lead
  a merrie life, they passe away their days in pleasure, and in an instant they
  goe downe into Hell. And to these men it is so much the more grieuous and
  painefull, by how much the lesse they haue been acquainted with the miseries of
  a wretched life.
               
                  Least a worse thing, &amp;c. Nor are the euills of this
  life euill,The Euils of this life are but seeming
 euills. nor the good things good. Saint Chrysostome saith, That
  God giues vs the good things of this life, to the end that in them we may see a
  shaddow, as it were of Heauen: The euill, That we may by them see the tracke of
  the cruell rigour of those hellish torments. Saint Paul treating of
  those euills that befall the Righteous, saith, Quasi morientes, quasi
  tristes, quasi, &amp;c. As dying, as chastned, as sorrowing,2. Cor. 6. as poore, as hauing nothing: He there
  reckoneth vp a bead-roll of many seeming ills, but not euills in deed; for
  their dying was to them liuing, their sorrowing, reioycing; their pouertie,
  riches; and their hauing nothing, a possessing of all things, &amp;c. Quasi
  flagellum. It is said of our Sauiour Christ, That he made a kind of whip,
  as it were, of those little cords wherewith the Sellers in the Temple bound vp
  their fardles. For in respect of Hell-whips, the whips of this life are not
  whips, but quasi flagella, as it were whips. The Scripture christneth
  humane troubles with the name of Waters, Emitte manum tuam, &amp; libera
  me de aquis multis: Aquae multae non potuerunt extinguere charitatem. The
  proportions of this word Aqua, are two:
               The one, That the troubles of the Godly doe passe away like
  waters.
               That though the waters be now and then troubled, they afterwards
  grow cleere againe.
               
                  But Hell is stiled with the name of
  Stagnum, a standing Poole, [Missi sunt in Stagnum ignis] because it is
  a punishment that alwaies stands at one stay, and is stil the same, &amp;c. The
  heart of the Godly finds this ease, that it liues in hope of recouerie; and
  the euills of the Righteous are neuer so many, but that they haue some shadow
  of good. Adam did supplie his nakednesse with Figge leaues. Death,
  which is the greatest ill to mans life, dulleth the sence, which is a kind of
  good; but Hell giues no hope of ease, no shew of comfort. From which God of his
  mercie keepe vs, &amp;c.

our next dayes labour. But in that other world (saith Esay) Erit

               From moneth to moneth, and from
Sabboth to Sabboth, shall all Flesh come to worship before me. Amongst
your Iewes, the first day of your moneths and your Sabboths were verie solemne
things. And Esay taking the moneth for the first day, saith, In
that glorie which we looke for, one moneth shall ouertake another, and there
shal be Sabboth vpon Sabboth. He might haue said (without vsing any kind
of figure) a perpetuall Feast, a perpetuall Sabboth, and a perpetuall Rest.

is withered away: But that supreame happinesse shall not onely be eternall and
perdurable, but without any the least prickle of sinne to offend our tender
Soules.
            
               He tooke vnto him Peter, &amp;c. First of all,
Damascene saith, That our Sauiour did not carrie all his Apostles with
him vp to the Mount; for it was not fit that Iudas should enioy so
great a blessing, in whom that prophecie of Esay was fulfilled,
In terra sanctorum iniquè gessit, &amp; non videbit gloriam
Dei. Hee who in so holy a companie committed such a vile treacherous act,
as to betray and sell his Master, for the loue of a little money, did not
deserue to enioy the glory of Tabor. So that to the end Iudas might
not complaine, That Christ had discarded him, and quite shut him out from this
blessing; this holy Saint saith, That those other good &amp; holy men were for
his sake debard of that good: whence we may gather, what hurt many an honest
man receiues by keeping a lewd knaue companie. But because it might haue
seemed a scandalous piece of businesse, to haue left Iudas all alone
by himselfe, the rest remained with him; Iudas his companie being no
lesse dangerous to the Colledge of Iesus his Disciples, than it was tedious
and wearisome to our Sauiour himselfe. Insomuch that when Iudas was
gone out of the house where Christ supt with his Disciples, (which he did
presently vpon the receiuing of the sop) he said, Nunc glorificatus est
Filius hominis, Now is the Sonne of man glorified. When Christ multiplied
his miracles,
                  Iohn 1
                     •
                  . Iohn 7. Saint Iohn saith, Non erat
Spiritꝰ datus, quia Christus nondū erat glorificatus, The holy Ghost was
not yet giuen, because that Iesus was not yet glorified. Why Christ, being
neere vnto his death, should hold himselfe to be glorified, and in the working
of miracles not to be glorified? For the decision of that point, I shal referre
you vnto Saint Augustine. You see here how the wind was come about,
Iudas was no sooner gone out, but he saith, hee is glorified; but
before, knowing who should betray him, hee told Peter, Vos mundi estis, sed
non omnes, (i.) Yee are cleane, but not all. The Cockle was taken
away, and the Wheate now pure and cleane; and our Sauiour tooke it for a great
glorie vnto him, to see himselfe thus wholly rid of his companie.
            Secondly, Gregory Nazianzen sayth, That hee tooke those
three along with him, because he alwayes loued them best. Showing thereby,The publicke to be preferred before the p
                     •
                  iuate. that Princes may lawfully haue their
Priuadoes, and Fauourites, to whome they may giue more grace and countenance,
than to others; but withall, that they ought to bee such, as should bee
disinterressed, and not desire any more for themselues than their Princes
grace, leauing the rest of his fauours to bee communicated to others, as well
as themselues. Saint Iude once askt of our Sauiour Christ, How
comes it to passe, that thou shouldst manifest thy selfe vnto vs, and not vnto
the World? Hee thought, that the Sunne should inlighten all. But because
he did first bestow his light on the mountaine tops, it was fit, that the
grace, which they receiued, they should gratis confer vpon others, Like
good Stewards. The Euangelist cals Saint Peter foole, because hee
would haue all for himselfe, and those that were there with him. And if
Elias, and Moses, were admitted to mount Tabor, it was,
because they were louers of the common good. Moses once disired of
God, that he would let him see his face; but God told him, hee could not see
his face and liue. It seemeth, that here Moses shewed himselfe to bee
but a coward; What, to inioy a poore life for the present, wouldst thou forgoe
so great a happinesse? But it was not the loue of his owne life; but the loue
that he bare to his people, who would haue had a great misse of him. Whereof
there was  afterwards verie good proofe, when God sayd
vnto him, Let me make an end of this people at once, and I will make thee a
mightier and a better Nation. Whereunto hee answered, I am so farre from giuing
way to this, That I shall beseech thee either to pardon them, or to blot me out
of the Booke of life; for I had rather not liue, than liue without them. Doost
thou offer to lay down thy life for thy people? And wilt thou not loose it to
see God face to face? The one, was a particuler, the other a common good.
            Thirdly, Hee tooke onely three along with him; manifesting
thereby, that hee was as sparing of his Glorie in this life, as he was liberall
of his Crosse. Tertullian sayth, That hee tooke those three with him,
not so much to make them partakers of this his Glorie, as to beare witnesse
thereof. And therefore carryed three, because they are a full and sufficient
testimonie. And this was a great comfort to those that were left behind; not
that they did dismerit the like fauor; but that there was a necessitie in it,
that some should abide with Iudas. For, if hee should haue beene left
alone, hee would haue tooke it for a great disgrace. But those other, did not
therefore merit lesse, by beeing left behind; For if the fauour, t
                  •
               wards those that went vp, seemed to bee
the greater, yet the deserts of those that were left, were not inferrior to
those that were admitted. For afterwards some of those suffered for the
Glorie, which they had seene, and most of these for the Glorie they had not
seene.
            To this purpose there are two Stories in the Scripture, one of
Eldad and Medad;
                  Num. 11.
which (according to the Scholasticall Historie) were halfe-brothers to
Moses; and beeing nominated amongst the seuentie for the gouernement
of the people, came not at all to the Tabernacle where God did communicate part
of Moses his spirit to the rest: But though they stayd behind in their
Tents, yet did they not loose this blessing, but did prophecie as well as the
rest. The other is of Dauid, who pursuing those that had burned
Ziklag, two hundred souldiers were left behinde with the baggage; but when they
had got the victorie, the spoiles were equally deuided, as well betweene those
that had ventured their liues in the battaile, as those that guarded the
stuffe. As his part is that goeth down to the battaile,
               1. Kings 30. 
               so shall his part bee that
tarrieth by the stuffe.
            
            Fourthly, Onely three; Because amongst few, all kind of obseruance
and vertue is better conserued. Howbeit the Church doth dayly pray, that the
number of the Iust may be increased. Which the greater it is, the more
gracious it is, and more comely in Gods sight. But as it is commonly taken,
the greater the number, the greater the harme. In the beginning of the world,
when there were few people, the harme was not much. But then the number of men
increasing,Prosperity alwaies enuied. sinne so
increased in the world, that God repented himselfe that he
                  •
                had made it. He was sorrie in his heart, that hee had
made both it, and man. That beeing verified of them,
                  Gen. 6. which Esay sayd vnto God;
Thou hast multiplyed the Nations, but not their Ioy. The Church
beginning to flourish, What followed? there were many Foxes, that did it much
mischiefe. As the wheat increaseth, so increaseth the tares. So, that much
prosperitie (in Senecas opinion) sometimes produceth much pouertie.
Augustine in his booke De Ciuit. Dei, prooueth this truth,
out of the Romane Histories; Romes owne greatnesse, beeing it's owne ruine.
Suis Roma viribus ruit. No sword could cut her throat, but her
owne.
            Lastly, Onely three; A number (Aristotle following the
opinion of Pythagoras) which containeth in it a vniuersitie of
things. And for that it is so full of mysterie, sufficeth, That it is
consecrated to the most sacred and blessed Trinitie.
            
               To him that shal ask me,
                  Ob.
                why Christ caried not his mother with him to
mount Tabor, as well as he did to mount Caluerie? I answere, That all
that,
                  Sol.
                which he suffered in mount
Caluerie, was in respect of his mother, in so much that this her sonne
complained, that God had forsaken him. But that Glorie, which hee inioyed in
mount Tabor, he had that from his father; So that the seeing thereof, did
nothing at all belong to his mother.
            Some man may doubt, why these three descending from the
Mount,
                  Ob.
                should aduise the rest, of the
fauour which they inioyed,
                  Sol.
                beeing they
had an interdiction to the contrary from our Sauiour, Nemini dixeritis
visionem, Tell no man, what you haue seene. I answere, That the
interdiction was not for the disciples, but for the people onely.
            But some one may reply;
                  Ob.
                Why
Enuy did not possesse their hearts that stayd behind; and Pride puffe vp theirs
that went vp to the Mount?Earthly things more enuied than
  Spirituall. Especially such a bloudie quarrell beeing like to haue
growne amongst them, who should be greatest in that their hoped for Kingdome?
They beeing all incensed against Iames and Iohn, for desiring
to be in neerest place to our Sauiour. I answer;
                  Sol.
                That this their striuing who should be
greatest, and this their chaires of Ambition, suppose a most base opinion of
the Kingdome of our Sauiour Christ: for that they imagined it (as before hath
beene prooued) to be terrestriall and temporall. And touching these goods of
the earth, not onely secular Kings and Princes, are readie to goe together by
the eares for them; but also your Ecclesiasticall persons, those that are the
holiest and honestest Church-men, labor to defend them with all their might and
maine. For they fall so short of those other, that are heauenly, that they
beeing deuided amongst so many, they all thinke, they haue too little.
Pallium breue est, vtrumque operire non potest, The cloake is short, and
cannot couer twaine. And for that the glorie of Tabor, was meant of that
other life, and for that it did discouer those that had beene dead for so many
yeares before, and for that it left euerie one so well satisfied, and made them
to acknowledge it as an immense and infinite blessing; it could not bee vnto
them a matter of Pride, or Enuy: Whence it commeth to passe, that in spirituall
goods, these vices are not found. Thou thy selfe obseruest, that such a
neighbour of thyne prayes deuoutly, bestowes his almes liberally, fasts often,
repents heartily, and performes all other Christian duties willingly, and thou
bearest him no enuie at all: but if thou seest he is richer than thy selfe,
thriues better in the world, or is more esteemed amongst men than thy selfe,
his prosperitie is thy torment. Those that were the Spouses companions did
neuer enuie her happinesse, Viderunt eum filiae Syon, &amp;c. The Daughters
of Syon saw her, and proclaimed her blessed. These were goods of the
Soule, wherein if there were any enuie at all, it was in regard of that
estimation which followes the bodie. Thou wilt happely enuie the vertuous, in
seeing him rewarded for his vertue, but not enuie vertue.
            
               Et duxit illos in Montem excelsum.
               
                  And he brought them into a high Mountaine.
                  The dignity of Mount Tabor. Tabor was a verie famous
  Mountaine, as well for those riches which God had placed in it, of sports for
  hunting, Trees, Fountaines, and pleasant Walkes, as also for those rare
  accidents which had beene seene and knowne to haue happened there: There was
  that encounter of Melchisadec with Abraham, when he returned
  so glad and cheereful, vpon that victorie which he had gotten against those
  fiue Kings. And being there was no other way to passe from Galile to Ierusalem,
  but by the skirts of this mountaine, Ieroboam hauing set vp two
  Idolls, one in Dan, and another in Bethel, for  to diuert
  those Tribes from going vp to the Temple to adore God, fearing lest they might
  passe ouer to Rehoboam, he had placed Watch-towers on this
  mountaine.
                     Ose 5. Suting with that of the
  Prophet Osee, O yee Priests, heare this, Iudgement is towards yee, because
  yee haue beene a snare vpon Mizpah, and a net spred vpon Tabor: The
  Priests and Princes catching the poore people in their snares, as the Fowlers
  doe the birds, in these two high Mountaines. In a word, This Mountaine is
  famous for verie many things, but for none more than that it was honoured by
  our Sauiour with his presence, and inriched with his glorie. And for this cause
  Saint Bernard calls it Montem Spei, The Mountaine of our
  hopes: For he that leads a godly life here vpon earth, may well hope to
  receiue a glorified life in Heauen.
            
            
               Et transfiguratus est ante eos.
               
                  And he was transfigured before them. Let vs here
  expound foure truths which are acknowledged by the whole bodie of
  Diuinitie.
               The one, That our Sauiour Christ liung amongst vs, was not onely
  seene of vs, himselfe seeing and knowing all things, but was happinesse it
  selfe.
               The other, That he was so from the verie instant of his
  conception.
               The third, That being happie in Soule, he must likewise be so in
  his body.
               The fourth, That the glorie of his Soule remained after that he
  had left his bodie.
               Touching the proofe of the first Truth, notable is that place of
  Saint Iohn, No man hath seene God at any time;
                  
                     Iohn 1. 
                  that onely begotten Sonne which is in
  the bosome of the Father, he hath declared him: The Glosse hath it, Who is
  neerest to his father, not onely in respect of his loue towards him, but by the
  bond of nature, and for the vnion or one-nesse that is betweene them, whereby
  the Father and the Son are one. God reuealed him and shewed him vnto vs;
  whereas before, hee was vnder the shadowes of the Law, so that the quickenesse
  of the sight of our mind was not able to perceiue him: for whosoeuer seeth him,
  seeth the Father also. The Euangelist pretendeth here to prooue, that onely our
  Sauiour Christ is the author of Grace and of Truth, and that neither
  Moses, nor any of the Patriarks could see God as he was himselfe,
  which is Truth it selfe by essence; but as he is the Sonne: and therefore he
  onely can be the author thereof. Men may see God in his creatures,
                     Iob 36. Romans 1. and know many of his
  perfections: And in this sence Iob said, All men see him and
  behold him afarre off. Saint Gregorie and Saint Paul
  implie as much, For the inuisible things of him, that is, his eternall
  power and Godhead, are seene by the creation of the world, considered in his
  workes. Men may likewise see him in some image or figure, sometimes of a
  man, sometimes of an Angell, sometimes of Fire, representing himselfe in those
  formes; sometimes by the eyes of the Soule, and sometimes those of the Bodie.
  So Esay saw him, I saw the Lord sitting vpon an high Throne.
  And Iacob, I saw the Lord face to face. Thirdly, God may be seene by
  Faith,
                     Esay 6. Gen. 29. 1. Cor.
 13. as the Faithfull now see him, Now, we see through a glasse
  darkely. Fourthly, in his humanitie, Afterward he was seene vpon
  earth, (saith Buruch) and dwelt among men. Fiftly, in himselfe,
  and in his essence, not in his creatures, not in his image, not in his
  humanitie, but in himselfe, Sicuti est, As hee is. This sight is so
  farre aboue all the rest, that it makes men happie, as also the Angels.
  Moreouer,
                     Iohn 3. Saint Iohn saith,
  That with a cleere sight (at least comprehensible) no man euer yet saw God, but
  by the Sonne. And being, that God is our happines, when he is cleerely seene,
  it followeth, that our Sauiour Christ is happie. The selfe same argument our
  Sauiour vsed to Nicodemus, No man ascended to Heauen,  but he which descended from Heauen, the Sonne of Man, who is in
  Heauen. Ye will not giue credit to these earthly things, how will yee
  credit those then that are heauenly: And condemning this their incredulitie, he
  saith, No man ascended vp into Heauen. There is not any man that can
  make true report of the things that are there, because no man hath ascended
  thither to see them: only I, who liued in Heauen, and descended downe from
  Heauen, am able to tell ye the things that are in Heauen. Our being in Heauen
  then being all one with the seeing of God, and the seeing of God beeing our
  happinesse, it followeth that our Sauiour Christ is happie.
               The second Truth, That he was so from that verie time that hee
  first tooke our nature vpon him; Saint Augustine collects it out of
  the sixtie fift Psalm, Blessed is the Man whom thou chusest and receiuest
  vnto thee, he shall dwell in thy Court, and shall be satisfied with the
  pleasure of thy house, &amp;c. The same Eusebius Caesariensis
  inferreth vpon the twentie second Psalme, Thou art hee that tooke me out
  of my mothers wombe; or (as the Chaldee letter hath it) Leuaui me in
  robore tuo, I got vp to bee ioyned equall with God. Which testimonies of
  Scripture are confirmed by all your Scholasticall Doctors.
               The third Truth, That our Sauior Christ must needs be happie
  both in soule and in bodie. Iohannes Damascenus prooues it out of that
  strict vnion of the Diuinitie, which Death it selfe cannot vndoe. Saint
  Augustine affirmes, That the glorie of the soule is naturally conueyed
  to the bodie, as the light of a candle to a paine of glasse.
               The fourth Truth, That our Sauior Christ was transfigured by
  giuing licence to the glorie of his soule, that it should transferre it selfe
  to the bodie: not that glorie which he was able to giue it, but that which his
  Disciples eyes were able to endure; as it is noted by Saint
  Chrysostome treating on this point.
            
            
               Et transfiguratus est.
               
                  And he was transfigured. We haue elsewhere set downe
  the causes of our Sauiours transfiguration; but none so often repeated by the
  Saints and Doctors, as his discouering thereby the hidden treasures of his
  glorie, as the reward that calls vnto vs, and stayes for vs, haling as it were
  our thoughts and hopes after it. Such is the condition of man, that commonly he
  makes interest and priuat gain, the North-starre of his labours and endeauours;
  this he thinkes on, dreames of, and adores. But as to the Worldling the worlds
  wealth is his North-starre; so the North-starre of the Sonne of God, is the
  glorie of God. Now our Sauiour Christ discouereth vnto vs a streake or a line,
  as it were, of that happinesse, which though it doth not fully expresse vnto vs
  what God is, yet it remooueth from vs all those difficulties which might diuert
  vs from his seruice. And therfore Saint Ambrose saith, Ne quis
  frangatur, &amp;c. He allureth our mind with this so soueraign a good,
  that the troubles of this life may not disquiet it, nor driue it to despaire.
  So furious are the tempests of this Sea, so raging the waues and tossings too
  and fro of this life, that if God did not temper the distasts thereof with the
  hope of another life, our life were but a Hell. Saint Bernard saith,
  That the end which our Sauiour had in transfiguring himselfe, was, that we
  might settle our thoughts and our hopes on that glorie whereunto he inuiteth
  vs; for that, mans happinesse wholly consisteth in enioying the presence of
  God. Saint Basil expounding that place of Saint Mathew, Estote
  perfecti, &amp;c. Be yee perfect euen as your Father is perfect; saith,
  That the plainest way to enioy God, is, to thinke so continually on him, that
  our Soules should be translated, as it were, into himselfe; wee playing 
   therein the Painters, who for to take a picture
  perfectly, neuer haue their eye from off the originall. Saint Cyprian
  saith, That there is not any thing that doth so much glad the eyes of God, as
  our thinking on the reward which is set before vs. Many Saints turmoyled with
  a thousand miseries, did euermore liue merily, by being onely cheered vp with
  these good thoughts and hopes. Salomon tells vs, A reward is as a
  stone pleasant in the eyes of them that haue it: Nor is there any pretious
  stone that so gladdeth his possessour,
                     Prou.
 17. as hope cheereth the Righteous. Gregorie Nissen calleth
  Affliction, the Floure of Glorie; Fructuum, qui sperantur flos, As he
  that is to eat of the fruit, takes pleasure in the floure, for that
  neighbouring hope which is neere at hand; so, the Righteous through hope
  reioyce in Affliction. Our Sauiour therefore being desirous that we should liue
  in hope, vnfolded part of that Glorie which he retained in his Soule, that
  placing our eyes and hearts thereupon, all troubles whatsoeuer, though neuer so
  great, might seeme little in regard of our hoped-for reward.
               Hence it followeth, how ill they proceed, and what a desperate
  and indirect course they take, to whom God hauing deputed the Earth for their
  hopes, and Heauen for their blisse, peruert this his order, by making the Earth
  their Heauen. It is an ordinarie phrase of speech in Scripture, to call our
  life, a Warrefare; now souldiers that are wise and valiant, reuerse their
  pleasures till the battell is ended and the victorie obtained. De torrente
  in via bibit, propterea exaltauit caput, He dranke of the torrent by the way,
  therefore hath hee lift vp his head. Saint Chrysostome
  expoundeth this verse of our Sauiour, Qui non acquieuit in diebus carnis
  sua, Who rested not in the dayes of his flesh, vntill he had ouercome
  Death and Hel. Saint Ambrose declaring that place of the Apostle,
  Non est nobis colluctatio, &amp;c. Wee fight (saith he) with the
  Princes of Darkenesse, for coelestiall goods, for they loosing them by our
  occasion, they are vnwilling that wee should enioy them. And because Reward is
  that which giues the Souldier both heart and hands, the last Sonday, we
  proposed the Warre; this; the Reward. The Deuill offered our Sauiour the glorie
  of the World; but our Sauiour offers vs the glorie of God: the hopes of this
  are better than the enioying of that. Saint Bernard saith, That the
  time of this life is the vigil of that feast which we hope for in glory: whence
  he inferreth these two things:
               The one; That it were folly in vs, to make the Vigile, the
  Feast. Which is all one with that of S. Austen; Summa peruersitas est, vti
  fruendis, &amp; frui vtendis. It is no good chop, considering the
  vnequalnesse of the tearmes. God gaue vs the Earth, that we might vse it;
  Heauen, that we might inioy it. And it is a beastly kind of ignorance, to make
  the Earth Heauen.
               The other; That the Feast beeing so great, the fast of the
  Vigile, ought not to seeme so long vnto vs. Saint Paul, making a
  counter position ofthat, which may be suffered heere; and that which may be
  hoped for there: after that hee had sayd, that the one was light and momentary;
  the other weightie, &amp; perdurable, he added, Supra modum in
  sublimitate. It is a highnes aboue all highnesse; the altitude thereof
  alone cannot be taken: Nor can the tongue of man indeare it so much, but it
  must fall short therof. This made Saint Gregorie to say, Qua
  lingua, &amp;c. What tongue, or what vnderstanding is able to vtter the great
  and wonderfull ioyes of that coelestiall Citie?
               
               
                  The pleasures of this life are altogether
 Vanitie.Saint Gregorie, opening that place of Ieremie,
  Patres nostri &amp;c. Our fathers eat
                        •
                      sowre grapes, and our teeth were set on edge; He st
                     •
                  les the pleasures of this life to be
  sowre grapes, and fruits that are not yet come to their true ripenesse, which
  are good for nothing else but to set our teeth on edge. Philon calls
  them, F
                        •
                     ri
                        •
                      
                      Coeli. For pleasures, are
  not for the earth; hee that inioyes them, steales them from Heauen. And as hee
  that steales, inioyes what he hath so got, with a great deale of feare and
  iealousie; so may wee be sayd to inioy these humane feasts and pastimes. That
  sacrifice of Abrahams, was held the most acceptable, that euer any man
  in the old Testament offered vnto God. For, in sacrificing his son
  Isaac, hee did sacrifice all the ioy and content of this his life. For
  Isaac by interpretation signifies laughter. Risum fecit mihi
  Dominus. The like may bee considered in his casting Agar out of
  his house, which signifies a stranger. Resoluing with himselfe (beeing but as a
  stranger in this world) not to ioy in the contents of this life.
  Ieremie, whose ordinarie occupation, was weeping, sayd,
                     Ier. 17. 
                  Diem hominis non desideraui,
  That is, the day of prosperitie, and of pleasure haue I not desired. And Saint
  Bernard hath this note vpon it; That hee might haue sayd, That he did
  neither desire it, nor inioy it. Dauid grew wearie of his passe-times
  and pleasures. Renuit consolari anima mea. If any thing can affoord
  mee comfort, it is the meditation of euerlasting ioy. Base is that minde, that
  liues merrie and contented with the inioying of the goods of this life. Base
  are the thoughts of that Prince, who keeping himselfe close in a Sheapheards
  cottage, shall deeme himselfe happie in that poore estate, not so much as once
  thinking on that crown, which he ought to hope for. Saint Austen
  declaring that place of Saint Iames, Fratres sufferentiam Iob audistis,
  &amp; finem Domini vidistis, Yee haue heard Brethren of Iob's
  suffering, and yee haue seene the end of the Lord. God sets before vs,
  as patternes of patience, the life of Iob, and the death of Christ;
  where it is to be obserued, that he doth not set before vs the end of
  Iob; because God giuing him a larger increase of wealth, of children,
  and other contents in this life, his end was not by him to bee desired. But
  that of our Sauiour was most painefull vnto him. And therefore it is sayd,
  Learne of Iob to suffer in this life, and of our Sauiour in his death.
  Leauing our hopes to relye vpon that other life.
            
            
               Et transfiguratus est.
               
                  And hee was transfigured. It was likewise fit, that our
  Sauiour should be transfigured for the confirmation of our Faith. For, if
  these our humane eyes did see in Christ our Sauiour, onely the course cassocke
  of our basenesse, and the scorne and contempt of his owne person, as
  Esay paints it forth, Who will beleeue the gold of his
  Diuinitie? Saint Augustine in his bookes De Ciuitate
  Deipunc; saith,
                     Esay 53.2. That all the
  transformations of those gods which the Gentiles did celebrate in Birds, Bulls,
  Stones, Trees, Fountaines, Fires, and graines of Gold, were directed to this
  end, that the World should beleeue, that vnder the forme of mortall men, &amp;
  this our own proper matter, lay hid some power supernaturall. Who would beleeue
  that Christ was God, if he had not giuen some glimpse of his Riches? Who would
  haue relied vpon his protection? Without some particular reuelation, who would
  haue dreamt of his omnipotencie? In a subiect so weake, who would surmise it?
  Imagine an Angell in the shape and figure of an Ant; none will beleeue that
  this was an Angell, vnlesse hee should at some time or other discouer some part
  of his brightnesse.
               It was also fitting that Christ should discouer vnto vs some of
  those his hidden treasures, to the end that those that were his, might be
  persuaded that they might safely sleepe vnder the shadow of his wings.
  Moses beeing employed in that businesse of Aegypt, O Lord (saith he)
  whom shall I say hath sent me?
                     Exod. 3.
 Exod. 9. 
                  Ego sum qu
                        •
                      sum, I am that I am: And anon after, Ego sum Deus
  Abraham, &amp; Deus Isaac, &amp; Deus Iacob, I am the God of Abraham, the God
  of Isaac, and the God of Iacob; Tel 
                  Pharaoh, that I am that I am; He that cannot, not be; That I am he
  that haue prospered &amp; protected Abraham, Isaac, &amp;
  Iacob. Which was not only a making of himselfe known what he was, but
  were likewise pledges to his people, that they should lay their confidence,
  libertie, liues, &amp; their persons vpon him: I am that I am by my essence; I
  am he that alwayes was, and euer shall be; it is I that haue power ouer euerie
  thing, and beg nothing of any man. The Princes of the earth, because they are
  to day, tomorrow, and are no more, they cannot giue vs any assurance of our
  hopes; and because they haue no pledges of their own, but what they borrow from
  others, their fauours cannot be secured vnto vs: For (as Saint
  Augustine saith) Remota jactantia, quid sunt homines, nisi
  homines? When Princes will shew themselues in their pompe and state, they
  borrow here, and they borrow there; they are no bodie, vnlesse they bee
  accompanied with the great Lords of the Kingdome, vnlesse they be attended on
  by a Gard of Halberdiers, vnlesse they be rich and gloriously apparelled, and
  brauely mounted. In a word, these are externall transfigurations, and of such
  things as are more others than our owne; but that of our Sauiour Christ was of
  his owne proper goods, without beeing beholding to any.
            
            
               Et resplenduit facies eius sicut Sol.
               
                  A twofold Light, the one temperal, the other
 spirituall.
                  And his face did shine like the Sunne. In the
  beginning of the world God did handsell his Word with the Light; for before,
  darkenesse had ouerspread the face of this confused Chaos, Tenebrae erant
  super faciem, &amp;c. And as hee that diueth into the bottome of the sea
  for Pearle, as he goes spurtling the oyle out of his mouth, goes, as it were,
  thereby ingendering light; so God by venting this word out of his mouth,
  fiat Lux, created the Light, discouering thereby the essence and
  nature of things. Some haue not stickt to say, that the Light gaue the red
  colour to the Rubie, the Greene to the Emerald, and the Skie colour to the
  Iacinth, &amp;c. And though this be not so, yet so it is, that without this
  Light these colours could not haue beene distinguished, nor could we haue
  enioyed that humane beautie and beautifull splendor which now we doe. In the
  Spheare of the Spirit God made another Light, which was Christ our Sauiour,
  [Ego sum Lux mundi] this Light doth as farre exceed the former, as the
  Spirit doth the Body. Dauid makes mention of these two Lights, in that
  Psalme of his, Coeli enarrant, &amp;c. The Heauens declare thy,
  &amp;c. Of that of the Sunne he saith, Tanquam Sponsus procedens de
  thalamo suo, This is the Bridegroome of Nature, and comes forth of his
  Chamber cloathed all in Gold; Bur that Spirituall Light is more fayre, and more
  beautifull by farre: Lex Domini immaculata, id est, immaculatior, &amp;c.
  The Law of the Lord is pure, that is, purer, &amp;c. The beames of the
  Sunne neuer yet had the power to pierce so far as to inlighten the Soule; but
  those of the Sun of Righteousnesse doth both inlighten it &amp; conuert it.
  He that tooke the day from the night, and the light from darkenesse, made
  light to breake forth from out the darkenesse of our hearts, to the end
  that Gods fauourable countenance shining vpon vs through his Sonne, we may come
  to the fuller knowledge of him.
               For this Light did ont only eclipse and darken that of the Sun,
  as that of many Torches doth a poore sorrie Candle; nor onely inrich the aire
  with the beames of his brightnesse, nor onely made a Heauen of this Mountaine,
  by gilding the stemmes, the barke, the boughes, and leaues of the trees, as
  also the stones thereof, with it's glorious rayes; but it did likewise
  illumine the soules of the Disciples, who from that verie instant, by the
  euidence of such diuine demonstrations, remained conuinced, and euer after
  acknowledged him to be both God &amp; Man:  For albeit
  God cannot be seene by the eyes of the Flesh, yet such signes and tokens may be
  seen of God, that we may verie wel say, that God himself is seen.
               Physiognomie is a Science, which by the signes and markes of the
  face, doth prognosticate the inclination and propension of the Soule. One that
  was skilled in that Art, looking steadily on the face of Socrates,
  told his Schollers, That hee had the markes of a man that was ill giuen.
  Whereunto he answered, That hee said true in regard of the Starres; but
  withall, that Sapiens dominabitur Astris. Looke vpon Christ our
  Sauiour, and you shall see first of all, that he hath a great inclination to
  our good, and that hee made especiall manifestation thereof in Mount Tabor; for
  as the angrie looke of a King is the Messenger of Death, so the cheerefulnesse
  of his countenance declareth clemencie and life. The roaring of a Lyon makes
  the Beasts of the Forrest affraid;
                     Prou. 16.
 Prou. 19. and the indignation of a King maketh his Vassalls to
  quake and tremble: but his fauour is like the dew vpon the grasse. Saint
  Ambrose saith, That our Sauiour Christs appearing here like Sunne and
  Snow, were true pledges of the great desire that he hath of our good: for there
  is not any thing that doth make the earth so fruitfull, as the Sun with his
  heat, and the Snow with it's moysture.
               Saint Hierome in that Epistle of his to
  Palmachius, against the errors of Iohannes Hierosolimitanus,
  saith, That not onely his face did shine, but all his whole bodie. Saint
  Austen, Quod caro illuminata, per vestimenta radiabat: For it was not
  fit (as Lyra hath it) that his garment should shine, and not his
  hands.
               
                  His face shined like the Sunne. Who would haue
  thought,The richest minds are vsually where the poorest
 meanes. that behind so poore a vaile there should bee found such great
  treasure? But it passeth so likewise in this world, that he that seemeth most
  poore, is oftentimes most rich; and he that seemeth most rich, is most poore.
  The greatnesse of Rome Saint Iohn painteth forth in the forme of a
  woman clothed in Purple, bedecked with pretious stones, and in her hand a sprig
  of Gold; but that which did not appeare to the eyes, was all abhomination,
  filthinesse, and beastlinesse. The Altars of Aegypt were euery one of them a
  Treasure-house of Pearles, pretious Stones, Gold, Iewells, and Silkes; but in
  euerie one of these their Altars they had a Toad or a Serpent. The Mezquita or
  Turkish Temple that honoureth the bones or Reliques of Mahomet, is
  stored with that infinite riches, that you would take him to be some great God,
  whereas indeed he is but vn çancarron de vn puerco, but the
  withered leg of a Hog, a base borne fellow, and of no worth in the world. The
  Idols of the Gentiles, though neuer so much gilded ouer with Gold, are no
  better than stockes and stones. One said in the Apocalyps, I am rich, and
  stand in need of nothing: But it was answered him from Heauen, Thou
  art poore, and much to be pittied. These are ordinarily the stampes of
  your powerfull persons and great Princes of this world, that seeming to be as
  bright as the Sunne in their bodies, are as blacke as a cole in their soules.
  But those that are the Saints of God, carrying a besmeered countenance, and a
  patcht garment, beare in their soules the Sunne, Sicut Tabernacula Cedar,
  sicut pellis Salomonis, Rich within, though poore without.
            
            
               Et ecce, aparuerunt Moses &amp; Elias.
               
                  And behold, Moses and Elias appeared. On Moses
  his part there is a strong reason. Amongst the Assei, it was a receiued
  opinion, (which those now follow, whom wee call Atheists) That the Soules did
  die together with the bodies: And it seemeth that Cicero did fauour
  the same, when he said in his Amicitia, Sicut in morte nihil est boni, sic
  certè nihil est mali, As there is no good, so there is no hurt in
  death. That couetous rich man in the Gospell was surely of this opinion in
   his life time; but being put out of this his errour, in
  that other life, he presently desired Abraham to send one in all hast
  from the dead, to preach vnto his kindred, that they might forsake this their
  errour: but hee receiued this short answer, Habent Moysen &amp; Prophetas,
  They haue Moses and the Prophets. Where there is Scripture, there is no
  need of miracles: And Saint Peter saith, That Prophecie hath more
  assurance in it than the euidence of miracles. This is a truth hard to be
  vnderstood.
               First, Because a miracle (as Saint Hierome saith) is,
  as it were, the Apostolicall Seale; and the Apostles did confirme their Faith
  by miracles: and those miracles that were prophecied of our Sauiour Christ
  heretofore, did declare him to be the Sonne of God. Saint Augustine
  treating at large vpon this place, saith, That Prophecies and Miracles haue one
  and the selfe same certitude, because they proceed from one and the selfe same
  God: but that Prophecie is the stronger and more forcible of the two; for a
  Miracle may bee found fault withall, as the Pharisees did with that Miracle of
  him that was possessed with a Deuil, telling our Sauiour, In Belzebub the
  Prince of Deuills thou doost cast out Deuills. And that same Pythonisse,
  made the Deuill to appeare in the forme of Samuel: But
  Abraham tells Diues, They haue Moses and the Prophets. And no
  man can taxe the Scripture, or challenge it of any fault.
               Saint Chrysostome askes the question, Why he did not
  fetch some of the Damned out of Hell?
               First of all, he answereth thereunto, That we haue many pictures
  of Hel in this life; but of Heauen, very few: For although that the World be,
  as it were, the Entresuelo, or middle roome of these two extreames,
  Heauen, and Hell; yet more are the fumes &amp; vapours that ascend vp from
  beneath, than those gustos, &amp; contents which descend from aboue.
  There were a sort of Heretickes that denied there was a Hell; it seeming vnto
  them, that the life of a Sinner was a Hell of it selfe, and that it stood not
  with Gods mercie, that there should be two Hels; alledging that of Nahum,
  Godiudgeth not one and the same thing twice.
               
               Secondly, God to many of his friends discouered the torments of
  Hell, and many of his enemies haue beene visibly snatcht away thither. And
  those Aetna's of fire which are in the world, though happely
  engendred by particular causes, are, as it were, symboles, representing vnto
  vs that eternall fire.
               
                  God labors to conceale, both his rewards and
 punishments.Thirdly, It is an vsuall fashion with God, to discouer the
  reward, and to conceale the chastisement, for that man would bee ashamed that
  others should see him punished. God did shut the port of Noahs Arke
  without, and hung the key at his owne girdle, because hee should not haue any
  desire to see that lamentable deluge, and generall destruction of mankind. He
  charged Lots wife, that shee should not so much as looke towards
  Sodome, that she might not behold those flames which did voice out Gods
  vengeance. At the end of the world, at that dreadfull day of judgement, when
  God shall shew himselfe most angrie, the Sun and the Moone shall be darkened,
  because God will haue his chastisements inflicted in the darke.
               
                  Hope more Preuailent with man than
 Feare.Fourthly, Hope doth worke more generous effects in our brests,
  than Feare. It cannot be denied, but that Feare hath verie powerfull effects:
  Herod for feare of loosing his Kingdome, made that butcherly slaughter
  of so many innocent Babes, not sparing his owne children. For feare of loosing
  his Citie, the King of Moab was his owne sonnes hangman, quitting him of his
  life vpon the wall. For feare of dying by the cruell hands of hunger, many
  mothers haue eaten the birth of their owne bowells. For feare least they should
  be made captiues, and  led in triumph by their enemies,
  many valiant men haue made an end of themselues. And for that Feare doth not
  onely extend it selfe to an absent good, as well as Hope, but likewise to a
  present; and for that to loose the present good which a man possesseth, causeth
  a greater sorrow, than to loose the good which we doe but hope for; it seemeth,
  that Feare is more powerfull than Hope.
               Yet notwithstanding all this, Antiquitie hath giuen the Palme to
  Hope; and the reasons on that side are verie cleere.
               The first, If Feare come to effect great things, it is by the
  helpe and fauor of Hope; for there cannot be any feare, without hope of
  escaping the ill or the danger that is feared. Him whom the feare of some
  great hurt apprehendeth, maketh choice to kill himselfe, that he may escape
  that harme.
               The second, Thomas and Aristotle both affirme,
  That Delight is the authour of noble deeds and difficult enterprises. Whence
  the Phylosopher inferreth, That that thing cannot long continue, which wee doe
  not take delight in. Delight then being the child of Hope; and Sorrow, the
  sonne of Feare, Feare is lesse noble than Hope.
               The third, Loue and Hope carrie vs along as Prisoners, in their
  triumph, yet as free, vsing vs like noble persons. And as they lead vs along,
  so are we willing to goe with them: But Feare carrieth vs away Captiues, haling
  vs by the haire of the head, tugging and pulling vs as a Sergeant doth a poore
  Rogue, who goes with an ill will along with him, making all the resistance that
  he can. And for that Heauen consists wholly of noble persons, and that the
  condition of God is so noble, and the reward which he proposeth, so honourable,
  we should do him great wrong, to suffer our selues to be drawne by force to so
  superexcellent a good; howbeit, with those that haue hung backe, our Sauiour
  Christ hath vsed the threatnings and feares of Death, of Iudgement, and of
  Hell: And his Prophets &amp; Preachers are therin to follow his example. Those
  that are his children he still desireth to lead them in the triumph of Hope:
  And for this cause Zacharie cals them the prisoners of Hope,
  Turne yee to the strong Hold, ye prisoners of Hope.
               
               Saint Ambrose saith, That hee made choice of
  Elias and Moses, to shew,
                     Zach.
 9. That in Gods House the Poore is as much respected as the Rich.
  Moses in his yonger yeares was a Prince of Aegypt; afterwards, the
  chiefe Commander and Leader of Gods People: Elias was alwayes poore,
  and halfe hunger-starued, cloathed with Goats haire; yet both these did enioy
  the glorie of Tabor. The like judgement may be made of Elizeus and
  Dauid, of Lazarus, and of Abraham, and of diuers
  others.
               Saint Luke addeth, Visi sunt in Maiestate, They
  were seene in State: For great was the Maiestie wherewith Elias
  and Moses appeared. And Tertullian saith, That they appeared
  glorious [In claritatis praerogati
                        •
                     a;] So that those new Disciples, Peter, Iames, and
  Iohn, might, by seeing these his antient followers so happie, bee
  thereby the better encouraged, and hope to enioy the like happinesse.
  Origen and Epiphanius are of the same opinion.
               Saint Hierome, against Iouinianus; and
  Tertullian, in his booke De Iejunio, say, That Elias
  and Moses did fast fortie dayes, as well as our Sauiour Christ in the
  Wildernesse; and that therefore they seemed as glorious as himselfe. Whence
  they inferre, That hee that will bee transfigured with Christ, must fast with
  Christ.
            
            
               
                  Loquebantur de excessu. They spake of his
  departure.
               Touching that death which our Sauiour Christ was to suffer in
  Hierusalem,  there could not bee any conuersation more
  conformable to that estate and condition of his. For, beeing that our Sauiour
  was to merit the glorie of the body by his death, he could not so much reioyce
  in any thing, as in the brauenesse of that noble and renowned Action, and the
  worthinesse thereof. In Gods house, good seruices are much more esteemed, than
  recompence or reward: And more reckoning is made of deseruing honour, than
  inioying it. When those his Disciples desired such and such seates of honour,
  our Sauiour sayd vnto them; Potestis bibere calicem, &amp;c. In my
  Kingdome, more honourable is the Cuppe that I drinke of, than the chaire that
  ye would sit in. In our Sauiours Ascension, when hee came to Heauen-gates, the
  Angells beganne to wonder at his bloudie garments.
                     Esay 63. 
                  Quis est iste, qui venit de Edom,
  tinctis vestibus de Bosra? In a place so free from sorrow and torment,
  such a deale of bloud, and woundes? But that which made their admiration the
  more, was, that hee should make this his Gala, the only gallant
  clothes, that he could put on. Formosus, in stola sua. And for that
  this his bloud, had beene the meanes of his taking possession of this glorie,
  both for himselfe, and for vs; he could not cloth himselfe richer, nor doe
  himselfe more honour, than to weare this bloudy roabe, that had beene dyed in
  the winepresse of his Passion. Saint Austen sayth, That the Prouidence
  of God had so disposed it, that the markes of the Martyres torments should not
  bee blotted out in Heauen. For albeit that happy estate doth repaire all manner
  of maimes, take away all deformities, and cleare all the spots, and blemishes
  of our body; and though they shall appeare much more glorious than the Sun; yet
  notwithstanding, those stigmata, and markes of their martyrdome, shall adde an
  accidentall glorie vnto them, as those colours that are gained in warre,
  beautifies his Coat who weares them in his scutchion.
               The Greekes read, Loquebantur de gloria, quam completurus
  erat, They spake of the glorie which hee was to fulfill. Our Sauiour
  Christ being vpon the Crosse, the Sunne was darkened (Tenebrae factae sunt
  super vniuersam terram) in token, that when Iesus Christ was crucified for
  our sinnes, there was no need of seeing the Sunne any more, nor any more
  Heauen, or glorie to be desired. In mount Tabor, Christ did not discouer all
  his glorie to the eyes of Faith, and therefore it was necessarie, that the
  Heauens should be opened, that a cloud should come downe, and a voice be heard
  from his Father, saying, Hic est filius meus dilectus, This is my beloued
  sonne. Saint Chrysostome expounding that place of Saint
  Iohn, sayth, Vidimus gloriam eius, quasi vnigeniti à
  patre. Signifying, That this is to bee vnderstood of that glorie, which
  our Sauiour Christ discouered on the Crosse; &amp; that there hee shewed, whose
  sonne he was &amp;c. Saint Paul seemeth somewhat to allude thereunto,
  when hee sayd, God forbid (sayth hee) that I should be so foolish as to glorie
  in any thing, saue the glorie of the Crosse. And the Spouse, His Crosse, and
  his Ensignes, are to me as a bundle of Myrrh, I will beare it betweene my
  brests, as my delight, and my treasure.
               
                  Christ glorrious in his passion three
 mā
                     ner of waies.Three manner of wayes may it bee taken, that this
  Excesse of our Sauiour Christ, is Glorie.
               The first, That his passion, and death, and the rest of those
  Excesses, which he did for our saluation, (for all these may bee termed
  Excesses) Christ did take them to be a glorie vnto him. Adam sinning,
  hee seemed to make little account of God, and his creatures, which in him was a
  great Excesse. But God did remedie this Excesse with other infinite Excesses.
  Saint Bernard obserueth, That our Sauiour Christ would not enioy the
  Balme which the three Maries brought to annoint him after he was dead,
  but did reserue it for his liuing bodie: For in  Christ,
  wee are to consider two bodies: the one Naturall; the other Mystical▪
  which is the Church: And as hee left the first nayled and fastned to the Crosse
  for the second; so he left this Balsamum, for the annointing and curing of it:
  Which was a great Excesse. Dauid called him a Worme, a Scoffe, a
  Taunt, and the Reproch of the People; for that whilest he liued in the world,
  he tooke vpon him all the affronts and contempts that man could cast vpon him.
  And because there is not any loue comparable to that of our Sauiour Christ,
  nor all the loues in the world put together, can make vp such a perfect loue;
  as also for that there was not any affront like vnto his, nor all the affronts
  of the world could equall the affronts that were offered vnto him; that on the
  one side hee should loue so much; on the other, suffer so much, this was a
  great Excesse. Nazianzen seeing vs swallowed vp in this sea of
  miseries, vseth a kind of Alchimie, by ioyning his greatnesse with our
  littlenesse; his powerfulnesse, with our weakenesse; his fairenesse, with our
  foulenesse; his beautie, with our deformitie; his riches, with our pouertie;
  the gold of his Diuinitie, with the durt of our Flesh: And as the greater
  drawes the lesser after it; so our basenesse did ascend to an heigth of honour.
  And this was a great Excesse; but farre greater, to esteeme this Excesse as a
  Glorie: whence the Saints of God haue learned to stile Tribulation, and the
  Crosse, Glorie.
               Secondly, This Excesse may be termed Glorie, because it was the
  most glorious action that God euer did: For what could be greater, than to see
  Death subdued, Life restored, the Empire of sinne ouerthrowne, the Prince
  thereof dispossessed of his Throne, Iustice satisfied, the World redeemed, and
  Darknes made Light?
               Thirdly, It may be said to be Glorie, because that by this his
  death a thousand Glories are to follow thereupon: Propter qoud &amp; Deus
  exaltauit illum, &amp;c.
                  
                     Phil. 2. Christ
                        •
                      passion the fountaine of our
 Glorie. 
                  Wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and giuen him a name
  aboue euerie name; that at the name of Iesus should euerie knee bow, both of
  things in heauen, and things in earth, and things vnder the earth: And
  this was the reward of his obedience and of his death. And the reason thereof
  was, that the World seeing it selfe captiuated by so singular a benefit, men
  should make little reckoning either of their goods or their liues, for this his
  exceeding loue towards them, but desire in all that they can, to shew
  themselues thankefull. And therefore Esay cries out, O,
                  
                     Esay 64. 
                  that thou wouldest breake the Heauens
  and come downe, and that the Mountaines might melt at thy presence,
  &amp;c. What a great change and alteration wouldest thou see in the world?
  thou wouldst see Mountaines (that is, hearts that are puffed vp with pride)
  humbled and laid leuell with the ground: Thou wouldst see Waters, that is,
  brests that are cold and frozen, boyle with the fire of Zeale, and wholly
  employ themselues in thy seruice. And in his sixtieth Chapter,
                     Esay 60. treating of the profits and benefits
  which we shall receiue by Christs comming, he saith, For brasse will I
  bring gold, and for yron will I bring siluer, and for wood, brasse, and for
  stones, yron; I will also make thy gouernment, peace, and thine exactours,
  righteousnesse; Violence shall no more be heard of in thy Land, neither
  desolation nor destruction within thy Borders; but thou shalt call Saluation,
  thy Walls; and praise, thy Gates. The Lord shal bee thine euerlasting Light,
  and thy God, thy Glorie.
               
            
            
               Bonum est nos hic esse, &amp;c.
               
                  It is better being here, than in Ierusalem; let vs therefore
  make here three Tabernacles, &amp;c. Saint Gregorie calls Honour,
  Tempestatem intellectus, (i.) The vnderstandings Storme, or
  Tempest, in regard of the danger it driues man into, and the easinesse 
   wherewith in that course he runnes on to his
  destruction.
                     Gen. 2
                        •
                     . 
                  Si dederit mihi Dominus panem ad vescendum,
  &amp;c. It was Iacobs speech vnto God, after that he had done
  that great fauour of shewing a Ladder vpon earth, whose top reached vp to
  Heauen; you know the Storie: but the vow that hee vowed vnto God was this, If
  God will be with me, and will keepe me in this journey that I goe, and will
  giue me bread to eat, and cloathes to put on, then shall the Lord be my God,
  and I shall neuer forget this his kindnesse towards me. More loue (a man would
  haue thought) he might haue shewn towards God, if he had promised to serue,
  though he had giuen him neither bread to eat, nor cloathes to put on. But Saint
  Chrysostome saith, That he seeing in this vision of his, the
  prosperitie that God was willing to throw vpon him, did acknowledge the
  thankefull remembrance of this his promised &amp; hoped for happines: For
  Prosperitie is euermore the comparison of Obliuion. Saint Bernard
  expounding that place of Dauid, Man being in honour,
                  
                     Psal. 49. 
                  hath no vnderstanding, saith,
  That the prosperitie wherein God placed man, robbed him of his vnderstanding,
  and made him like vnto the Beasts, that perish. And here now doth Saint
  Peter loose his memorie. Nor is this a thing so much to be wondred at;
  for if there be such riches here vpon earth, that they robbe a man of his
  vnderstanding, and alienate him from himselfe; if the sonne that is borne of a
  mother who hath suffered great paines in the bringing of him forth, Iam non
  meminit praessurae, hath forgotten his mothers throwes, and thinkes not on
  the wombe that bore him; if the great loue of this world, and the prosperitie
  thereof, can make vs so farre to forget our selues; it is no strange thing,
  that we should be farre more transported and carried away with heauenly things.
  Dauid following the pursuit of his pleasures, amidst all the delights
  of this life, he cries out, Onely thy glorie can fill me, that only can
  satisfie me. Remigius vnfolds this verse, of the glorie of the
  Transfiguration; and it may be that this Kingly Prophet did see it by the
  light of Prophecie. And if so fortunate a King as he was, did forget all those
  other goods that he enioyed, and saith, That hee desires no other good, nor no
  other fulnesse; What meruaile is it, that a poore Fisherman should bee
  forgetfull of good or ill? And as hee that is full fed likes nothing but what
  is the cause of this his fulnesse, reckoning all other meats soure, though they
  be neuer so sweet; so he that shall once come to tast of that good, will say,
  No ma
                        •
                      bien,
                  
                     Rom. 8. I desire no other good but this. What
  sayth Saint Paul, Sed &amp; no
                        •
                     , &amp;c. But we also which haue the first fruits of the Spirit,
  euen wee doe sigh in our selues, waiting for the adoption, euen the redemption
  of our bodie, &amp;c. Though Paul enioyed the first fruits of the
  Spirit, and extraordinarie regalos and fauours; yet hee groaned and
  trauelled in paine for Heauen. What, saith Saint Chrysostome, Is thy
  soule become a Heauen, and doost thou yet groane for Heauen? Do not thou
  meruaile that I groan,2. Cor. 12. hauing
  seene that in Heauen which I haue seen; Quoniā raptus fui
                        ••
                      Paradisum: I see the good which
  the world wanteth; and the ill which the Prodigall endured; he did groane and
  sigh in the Pigge-stie, when he called to mind his fathers goodly houses. Saint
  Hierome treating of the raptures of his Spirit, saith, That he found
  himselfe many times among Quires of Angells; hee saith, That he liued a whole
  weeke without any sence of bodily necessitie: nor was it much, he enioying the
  conuersation of Angells, and the fellowship of God, Diuinae visionis
  intuitu: but when I came againe to my selfe, I did bewaile the good that I
  had lost. But that Peter may not groane with Saint Paul, nor
  weepe with Saint Hierome; knowing how the world went here beneath,
  said, Let vs not leaue that place which we may haue cause to weepe for, when we
  are once gone from it: For, what good is there vpon earth, be it neuer so good,
  which hath not  some ill with it's good? Obtaine (if thou
  canst) of God, that hee will but once giue thee leaue to tast of the goods of
  Heauen, and thou wilt soone forget whatsoeuer is on earth. The reason why
  these fraile &amp; transitorie goods are so much desired, and sought after with
  so great thirst and couetousnesse, is, because those eternall goods which call
  continually vnto vs, stand in so farre a distance from our hearts and our
  thoughts: for if thou shouldst but taste one drop of the water of that
  coelestiall Fountain, or but one crumme of that diuine Table, thou wouldst say
  with a full and resolute purpose, No mas mundo, Let the world goe, I
  will no more of it. The Hound when he neither sees nor sents his Game, goes
  slow and soft, diuerting himselfe here and there, as if hee had no life in him;
  but he no sooner spies the Hare, but he flies with the wind. Robbed of the
  content of Heauen, I said, All, whatsoeuer is in the earth is a Lye.
                     Psal. 106. 
                  Peter was rob'd of himselfe,
  and therefore he desired to stay still there. The first that tasted Wine,
  though he were so graue a man as Noah, it made him commit a great
  excesse, insomuch that it gaue occasion to his owne sonne to mocke him. And
  how should not the first that tasted of the glorie which our Sauiour Christ had
  manifested in Tabor, (though so graue a one as Peter) be so drunken
  therewith, that he should vtter so great an excesse? But whatsoeuer was taken
  from himselfe, hee did adde it all (whatsoeuer it were, more or lesse) to the
  glorie of Christ.
            
            
               Non enim sciebat, quid diceret.
               
                  For he knew not what he said. Erras Petre, (saith Saint
  Hierome) Peter,
                  Saint Pe
                        •
                     ers error in his admiration of Mount
 Tabor 
                  thou art in a mightie errour: First, In iudging that for
  a happinesse that was so short and transitorie; there being no felicitie but in
  things that are permanent. Immagine all possible happinesse, measure it with
  the duration of Ages, and with that time which in the end must end; and when it
  is ended, thou wilt hold it an vnhappinesse and infelicitie. Peter,
  thou desirest to inioy glorie here in this world, which is to end toomorrow:
  And for that the glorie which thou desirest, is not to last so long as the
  world, nay scarce an houre in this world, thou art in a mightie errour,
  Peter. Saint Luke saith, That to the hungry bellie the
  remembrance of his forepassed fulnesse shal be a torment vnto him; and to the
  sorrowful, his former laughters and contentments shal but the more augment his
  griefe, &amp;c.
               Secondly; Peter did erre, in preferring a particular,
  before a publicke good;Publicke Good, euer to be preferred
 before the priuate. especially, beeing a Prelat and Pastor of the
  Church. The hand and the foot, renouncing their proper right, offer themselues
  to incounter with any danger, for to defend the head, and saue the life.
  Amongst the Elements, the Water, the Earth, and the Ayre, forsake their Center
  for to assist common necessitie. A good Citisen must bee wanting to his owne
  house and person, for to further the common good. Saint Austen sayth,
  That Prelates must make profession of a double obligation: One, of Sheapheards,
  for their sheepe; another, of Christians, for themselues. For the first, they
  must haue recourse to the necessitie of their subiects, with a great deale of
  care and vigilancie. For the second, they are to exercise themselues in all
  kind of vertue, and holinesse. But many of them, practise the contrary. They
  are Christians for others, willing them to exercise themselues in vertue and
  holynesse; and Pastors for themselues, caring too much for their owne
  pleasures, and profit. The King of Sodome sayd vnto Abraham, Giue mee the
  persons, take the goods to thy selfe. Hee regarded more the freedome and
  libertie of his subiects, than the ransoming of his treasures. And howbeit hee
  was a bad man, yet hee shewed himselfe a good sheapheard. Dauid cried
  out vnto God, Lord keepe my soule, and deliuer Israel out of all his
  troubles. 
                   Hee ioyned his owne, and the common
  cau
                     •
                  e together, that God might be
  the better pleased therewith, and the sooner graunt his request.
               Thirdly, Peter erred in his too too cold commendation
  of this Glorie, for the which a greater praise had beene insufficient.To commend coldly that which is excellent, shewes a weake
 iudgment. Thou desirest a Painter to show thee a picture; He takes out
  one; thou desirest a better, hee takes out another, that contents thee not: At
  last he shewes thee the best that he hath; Thou coldly commendst it, and sayst,
  it is a pretie good peece, so, so: He growes wearie of thee, and takes it away
  from thee. God made in the world diuers pictures, euery one of them beeing good
  apart; and all of them put together, exceeding good. Thou sayst, ô Lord,
  these doe not satisfie my desire; I would see the best peece that euer past
  through thy hands. He carryes thee vp to mount Tabor, hee there showes thee his
  master-peece, his Glorie? Peter giues it onely this cold commendation,
  Master it is good. Peter thou errest, sayth the Euangelist; For
  hee knew not what hee sayd.
               
               Fourthly, Peter did erre, in debasing so much that
  glorie, which had no need at all of any Tabernacles, or houses to defend them
  from the Sunne, &amp;c. For, as he did not thinke then vpon eating, so he might
  haue had as little mind of sleeping. Saint Ambrose defines
  Happinesse, to bee, Omnia bona, in omni bono. Hee need not desire a
  Sunne to giue him light, because he inioyeth another Sunne, that neuer setteth;
  and another Moone, which neuer is in it's wane, or increase. Thou shalt
  haue no more Sunne, to shine by day (saith Esay) neither shall the
  lightnesse of the Moone shine vnto thee.
                  
                     Esay
 60. Thy Sunne shall neuer goe downe, neither shall thy Moone be hid. For
  the Lord shall bee thine euerlasting light, and the dayes of thy sorrow shall
  be ended. But here, our felicitie, is in the wane, and our happinesse suffers
  an eclipse. Neither is our light cleare, saith Saint Bernard,
  nor our ref
                        •
                     
                     ction full, nor
  our mansion safe: Cloudes, obscure it's light; hunger, marres it's
  fulnesse; and alterations, it's firmenesse, and security. Gregorie
  Nissen sayth, That, Necessitie brought in Rule and Dominion. For
  that there should bee a Lord and Ruler, there is a necessitie in it; And that
  there should be a greater Lord, there is a greater necessitie in it. For Man,
  had neede of the creatures, and God made him Lord ouer them. If a man could
  runne as fast as a horse, hee were not Lord ouer the horse; if he had the
  clawes, and strength of a lyon, hee were not Lord ouer the lyon; But in Heauen,
  there is not any the least signe of necessitie: for there both the Sunne, the
  Moone, the Creatures, Fountaines, Plants, Fruits, Flowers, and Houses are all
  superfluous. So that Peter when hee talkt of building Tabernacles, he
  knew not what he sayd.
            
            
               Adhuc eo loquente, eccè nubes lucida.
               
                  Blind Clouds were for the Law, bright for the
 Gospel.
                  And as he yet spake, behold a bright Cloud. Scarce had
  Peter ended his speech, when a bright shining cloud, like a glorious
  Curtaine, ouerspred them all. Thomas sayth, That in this cloud the
  holy Ghost descended downe, as hee did in that Baptisme, in the forme of a
  Doue. Theophilact, That in the old Testament God appeared in darke
  clouds, which strooke terrour, and amasement; but now he comes in a bright
  cloud, because he came to teach, and to giue light. The holy Ghost, is the
  Author of the light of our soules. Wisedome cals him, Spiritum
  intelligentiae, The spirit of vnderstanding; And the Church dayly begges
  of him, that hee will lighten our darkenesse, and illuminate our sences.
  Accend
                        •
                      lumen
  sensibus.
               
               From the cloud, there went out a voice, like vnto thunder, which
  sayd, This is my beloued Sonne, heare him. And Saint
  Chrysostome hath noted it, That Moses, 
                  
  and Elias disappeared, and were not to bee seene; to the end that the
  Disciples might vnderstand, that this voice was onely directed to our Sauiour
  Christ. Howbeit, hauing seene beefore in his face that treasure of glorie, and
  Peter hauing acknowledged him to bee the Sonne of the euerliuing God,
  in the name of the whole Colledge and Societie of the Apostles; it could not
  bee presumed otherwise.
               The voice beeing past, the cloud vanished, and the Disciples
  remained as dead men. Our Sauiour Christ quit them of their feare, and comming
  againe to themselues, like those that are awakened from a heauie sleepe, they
  saw none but onely Iesus in the garden. They were falne all asleepe, and they
  slept so soundly, that our Sauiour Christ could hardly wake them. Heere
  likewise they failed; for they awaked with an earnest desire to enioy that
  glorie which they had seene, but they did not see it any more. First, because
  those eyes that shut themselues to labour, do not deserue to see such glorie;
  Secondly, because vpon earth, (though it be from Heauen) no good can continue
  long. Thomas saith, That the body of our Sauiour Christ did inioy this
  glorie, as it were by transition, or a passing by; And that those glories,
  which are enioyed here on earth, are short &amp; momentarie, they are no better
  than grasse and hay, which are soone cut down &amp; withered, they are Winter
  Sun-shinesand Summer-Floods, soone gone. Mans dayes are like the grasse,
  and as the flowre of the field, so shall hee flourish. But that the glorie
  of God should stand vpon these ticklish tearmes, I cannot wel tell what to say
  to it; nor doe I know which is the greater miracle of the two, either that the
  glorie of the Earth should continue, or that of Heauen haue an end. But the
  truth is, those goods do not last long with vs, which Heauen it selfe
  communicateth vnto vs. Saint Bernard sayth, That those pensions which
  God bestows on his friends, are verie good, but verie short. Saint
  Austen; That it is a sweete, but a short good, that God giues vs in
  this World. Hugo de Sancto Victore, That Gods Regalos, or
  Regales delitiae, haue two discountings, or diminutions of debt in
  this life: The one, that they are not full; the other, that they are not long,
  for a cloud presently comes and ouershadowes them. Saint Bernard
  treating of the cherishments and comforts of the Spouse, vnder the name of
  kisses, saith, Heu rara hora, &amp; parua mora; One while he saith,
  that he suffered his thoughts to be carried away with the sweetnes of these
  daintie delights, conceiuing it to bee a great happinesse; but then hee sayth
  againe, O, si durasset. Those that trauell abroad, reserue all their
  content they take therin, for their Countrie; so that their ioy shal not only
  be ful, but permanent, They shal be drunke with the plentifulnes,
  &amp;c. Of Nebridius, a friend of his, Saint Augustine
  saith (And he applieth his mouth to that Fountaine from whence he drew all his
  happinesse;) Pro jucunditate sua sine fine, foelix; Happie, for the
  pleasure of it without end.
               
            
            
               
                  Ipsum audite, Heare him.
               Here the World did receiue so great a good,Christ appointed to be our Teacher but when. that the
  Father did giue vs his Sonne, to be our Master and Law-giuer. So that it lyes
  vpon him to teach vs, and vpon vs to obey him. Tertullian sayth, That
  the presence of Moses and Elias, made much for that present
  purpose, but more now their absence; for that it gaue vs thereby to vnderstand,
  That this supreame Master and Lawgiuer did far outstrip the office of
  Moses, and the zeale which Elias had of the Law [Quasi
  jam off
                        •
                     cio, &amp; honore
  perfunctis.] For in this best beloued sonne of God, Iesus Christ, two
  things are to be seene; the one, as he was a Lawgiuer, the aduantage that he
  had of the Law; the other, That Moses was now put to silence, and that
  we were  onely to hearken to our Sauiour Christ.
               At his Baptisme that verie selfe same voice was heard, This
  is my beloued sonne; but we find not there an Ipsum audite, Heare
  him. Not notifying him then to the World for a Master; so that it seemeth
  that this was reserued for our Sauiour Christ, against he had past ouer the
  rigour of Fasting and Pennance: signifying, That God placeth not him in the
  office of a Preacher, who hath not run through these strict courses.
                     Psal
 91. 
                  Bene patientes erunt, vt annuntient, Christ had no need to
  doe pennance, but thou hast great need to doe so, Locus est
  communis.
               
               
                  Descendentibus illis, &amp;c. And when they came down from
  the Mount, he charged them to say nothing to any man. He inioyned them
  silence: First, (saith Saint Hierome) Ne incredibile
  videretur, lest the greatnesse and strangenesse thereof should make men to
  thinke it to be an old wiues tale. And if Christ said to Nicodemus, If when
  I tell yee earthly things yee beleeue not, how will yee be brought to beleeue
  those high and heauenly mysteries of the Kingdome of God? Here occasion
  may bee taken to taxe those, who comming from beyond the seas, are all in their
  Hyperboles, abusing others eares with their loud lyes, but giuing the lye most
  to their owne soules.
               Secondly, He inioyned them silence, for that the fauours and
  regalos which thou shalt receiue from God in priuate, thou art not to
  bring them vpon the stage in publique, or to proclaime them (as we say) at the
  Crosse. Leaue this care to God, for he will bring them to light in their due
  time, when they shal make for thy honour, and his glorie. Elias was
  verie carefull, that no man should know of his departure; nay, he sought to
  hide it from Elisha, saying vnto him in Gilgall, Sede hic, &amp;c.
  Tarrie here, I pray thee, for the Lord hath sent me to Bethel: But
  Elisha said, As the Lord liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I will
  not leaue thee. And hee was scarce come to Bethell,4.
 Kings 2. but the childeren of the Prophets that were at Bethell
  came out to Elisha, and said vnto him, Knowest thou that the Lord
  will take thy master from thine head this day? Noui, silete, Yea, I know
  it, (said he) hold yee your peace. Elias afterwards departed for
  Ierico, intreating Elisha that hee would tarrie behind, promising him,
  that he would presently returne vnto him, but he could not persuade
  Elisha vnto it. They were scarce come to Ierico, but the sonnes of the
  Prophets acquainted him with the like newes; to whom he answered as before,
  Noui, silete. In the end, going for Iordan, Elisha still
  followed him, and fifty of the sonnes of the Prophets: so that the more
  Elias sought to conceale this businesse, the more God made it knowne,
  by reuealing it (as Tostatus hath obserued) to the sons of the
  Prophets. And Elias desiring that they should not see this his
  Chariot of fire, and his Triumph, one only God made many witnesses of his
  glorie.
            
            
               Neminem viderunt, nisi solum Iesum.
               Onely in Christ Iesus are our hopes secured. Men will accompany
  you whilest the glorie of your prosperitie lasteth; but that beeing ended, you
  shall find no man that will sticke vnto you; Woe vnto him that is alone,
  for if he fall, hee shall haue none to helpe him vp:
                  Prosperitie findes alwaies Freinds, aduersity none. And
  this is truly verified of those who trust on the world, or haue any confidence
  in man. Weigh and consider with thy selfe, what a number of friends Ierusalem
  had in it's prosperitie, how readie to seru
                     •
                   her, and to court her loue; but when Ierusalem began to fall, and
  when she had most need of her friends, Ieremie complaineth, Shee
  had not so much as one friend to be her comforter. The God of all comfort
  vphold vs with his euerlasting loue, that we may not perish in this wrold, nor
  in the world to come.

                  IOHN 8.21. 
                  
                     Ego vado, &amp; quaeretis me.
                   
                  I goe my way, and yee shall seeke me.
               
            
            
               THe Scribes and Pharisees were offended at the fauour which,Without Faith in Christ, no remission of sinne. Iohn
  8.7. in affront of their authoritie, our Sauiour had shewne to the
Adulteresse, saying, Let him that is among you without sinne, cast the
first stone at her. They had made some threatning offers (as men that
thought themselues much wronged by him) to take away his life; but because his
houre was not yet come, no man laid hands on him. Whereupon our Sauiour said
vnto them, Ego vado, Why seeke yee thus after my life, I goe my way, I
am he, whom willingly, and of myne owne accord offer my selfe vnto death; your
armes were not strong enough to hold me, if it were in my desire to make
resistance: but when I am dead yee shall seeke mee. For the Iewes vsed
continually to cal for their Messias, and did earnestly long after him,
expecting then his comming, when as hee was alreadie come: and for that this
hope of theirs was hopelesse, he saies vnto them, Yee shall die in your sinnes,
your death shall differ much from mine, for I shall goe one way, and you
another; Whither I goe, yee cannot come. Your inferiour Ministers did
presume, That our Sauiour out of a desperate humour would needs liue among the
Gentiles, as hee that goes to Morocco to turne Moore; the Pharisees, they
thought that he would goe destroy himselfe; What meaneth this man to say,
Whither I goe, yee cannot come? Will he kill himselfe? Vnto which vnmannerly
speech our Sauiour replied, Yee are from beneath, I am from aboue; yee are of
this world, I am not of this world; I haue told yee alreadie, That except ye
beleeue that I am he, yee shall die in your sinnes, not onely in that of
incredulitie, but in  all those other which ye shall
commit: for without faith in him, who I am, there is no remission of
sinnes▪ &amp;c.
            
               
                  Iohn 16. Mat. 2.
               I
goe my way, and yee shall seeke me. This phrase of speech our Sauior
Christ did often vse, to shew, That hee died meerely out of his owne proper
will and pleasure. O Lord (said Abraham) I shall be verie
willing to die without leauing any children behind me, seeing that thou wilt
haue it so. Eusebius Emisenus to this purpose expoundeth those words which
our Sauior vttered on the Crosse to his father, In manus tuas, Domine,
commendo Spiritum meum, Into thy hands, ô Lord, I commend my Spirit:
Now Commendare is all one with Ponere; I put not, ô
Lord, my soule into the hands of death, nor into those of my enemies; for
neither their whips, nor their thorns, nor their nayl
                  •
               , nor their speare, were able to take my life from me,
if I had not bin willing to surrender it vp into thy hands. Seneca
saith, That a benefit consists not so much in the thing that is giuen, as the
good will wherewith it is giuen. And therfore when the gift is small, the
greatnesse of it must be measured according to the goodnesse of the will. The
death of our Sauiour Christ was the greatest benefit that euer the world
enioyed, but the willingnesse wherewith he laid downe his life for vs was farre
greater, Maiorem Charitatem, &amp;c. Greater loue hath no man, than this,
that a man layes downe his life for his friend.
            
            But heare now the wofullest, the heauiest, and most lamentable
case that can possibly fall within the compasse of thy imagination; to wit,
That the death of his Sonne, which God promised to the world as a Sea of
mercies, as a Heauen of hopes, as a ransome of our slauerie, and as a
reparation of all our miseries, he should now giue it as a threatning to this
wretched and vnfortunate Nation: and how taking his leaue of his Disciples, in
that Sermon of his last Supper, with tender teares trickling down his eyes, and
with a great many other kind demonstrations of his loue, hee should make such
large promises vnto them after his death; one of the chiefest whereof was,
Let not your heart be troubled; for although I go from you,
               Christs
  going from vs, the greatest Curse. 
               yet shall I still remain with
you; Lo, I am with you till the end of the world: yet he should say now to
the Pharisees, Ego vado, &amp; quaeretis me, I depart away from you,
neuer to see you more. O, what a cruell blow was this! O, what a sad departure
is this! how comfortlesse, and how hard to be endured? If from him that is
dangerously sicke the Physition shall goe his way, who is able to cure him; if
from the Thirstie the Fountaine shall flie from his lips, what is able to
quench his thirst; if from the Blind, the light; from the child, his father;
from the wife, her husband; from the souldier, his captaine; and from the
scholler, his master shall be taken away; of whom shall they seeke helpe?
Turne not away thy face,
               
                  Iob 14.13.
               neither decline from thy seruant. Iob held Hell lesse fearefull than
Gods displeasure; O, that thou wouldst hide me (saith he) in the graue, that
thou wouldest keepe me secret vntill thy wrath be past. But Dauid held
it the greater harme of the two, that God should hide his face from him, Though
thou beest angrie with me, yet turne not thy face from me. The same
Iob saith, Why doost thou hide thy face, this is to vse me as
an enemie. Iacob wrestling with God, although hee saw hee was
displeased,
                  Gen. 32. yet hee would not let
him goe till hee had blest him. O Lord, I will endure thine anger, but not
thine absence. By way of Hyperbole S. Paul said to those of Ephesus,
Yee were without Christ, and without God in this world: Weighing
therein verie well with himselfe, what the world is, and what God is.
            What then, shall this his departure be eternall? It goes hard with
vs, when God shal threaten his going away, and we shall not haue the heart to
entreat him to stay. Ieremie lamenting his misfortunes, one while in
the name of his people,  that were carried away captiues
into Babylon; another while in his own proper person, as one that lay fast
fettered in yrons, making a relation of his sorrowes goes adding griefe vnto
griefe; He did put me in a darke Dungeon, he did shut mee vp as in a
graue amongst the Dead, He hath enclosed my wayes with hewen stone;
hee hath shut his windowes against me, hee hath not left mee a loope-hole to
looke out; hee hath clapt gyues and shackles on my feet; I put vp a Petition
vnto him, And he would not hearken vnto my prayer. Yet notwithstanding
all this, doe you but aske the Prophet, Whither God had then a purpose to
destroy him? and he will tell you, That it was the least of his thought: No,
these were the stripes of a father, that loues his child better than he loues
himselfe; who beats him, but with teares in his owne eyes. If God then be so
good and louing a father vnto vs, that he falls a weeping when hee giues vs
but a few jerkes, &amp; those with a gentle hand; How can he desire our
eternall punishment? The Lord will not vtterly cast vs off. That God
should for euer take his leaue of thee, the fault must be in thee, not in God;
Can God take away his kindnesse for euer? How can hee shut the gates
of his house against thee, who is still knocking at the doores of thy house?
Non in perpetuum triturabis triturans, saith Esay, If God doe
thresh thee as with a flaile, it is not because hee takes delight to bruise
thee with his threshing of thee, but that he may seuer the corne from the
chaffe, &amp;c. This our Sauiours threatning is full of mercie, full of loue;
for he would neuer haue said so often to the Iewes, Ego vado, if hee
had not desired that they should haue said againe vnto him, Do not thou go from
vs. If it be our Sauiours delight, to be amongst the children of men, how can
hee take pleasure in departing eternally from vs.
            
               Et quaeretis me, (i.) And yee shall seeke me.
This second threatning is more fearefull than the former; Yee shall seeke mee,
but yee shall not find me. In the pursuit of any kind of good whatsoeuer, hard
is that mans happe, who seeks and finds not; who calls, and receiues no answer;
who sues &amp; obtains not; who liues in hope, but sees no end of his hopes.
Our Sauior Christ lookt for a Figge on the Figge tree, and because he found
none there,
                  Math. 21. his displeasure was
such, that he laid a seuere curse vpon it. Amongst those many feares of the
generall judgement, Saint Iohn in his Apocalyps saith, Man
shall seeke after death,Kindnes neglected, turnes to
  hatred. and shall not find it, though those find it too, that neuer
seeke after it. This is a great vnhappinesse; but when the businesse is betwixt
God and vs, it is a far more miserable misfortune, to seeke him, and not to
find him: not onely because they sometimes find him, who seeke not after him,
[Inuentus sum à non quaerentibus me, I am found of those that seeke
me not;] but also because any other good whatsotuer, a man may hate &amp;
abhor as a thing that is ill; Vae, qui dicitis bonum, m
                     •
                  lum, Wo be to you that call good,
euill; he that despaires of life, desires death, and counts it as a good.
But who can hate God, who doth naturally desire our happinesse? But this
miserie yee draw vpon your selues, who by abhorring me, and persecuting me
(saith Saint Augustine) as an enemie of God, are driuen to seeke vnto
God, calling hourely vpon him for your Messias, with great anguish of heart,
and with teares in your eyes: but because yee haue refused that happinesse
which offered it selfe vnto you, and entred within your gates, but was
reiected; groping the walls like blind men at noone day, yee looke after a new
occasion of happinesse: but by how much the more yee shall desire a new
Messias, by so much the more shall yee persecute me, and those which shall
preach my Name throughout the world. And by how much the more yee shall
persecute me, so much the longer shall your errour remaine with yee, and ye
shall continue in this your wilfull stubbornenesse, till yee die in your
sinnes.
            
               Hence I inferre, how dangerous a thing an
errour is, especially in point of our saluation; how dangerous, an ill
performed Confession, yet by vs reputed for good; how dangerous, a secure, but
vnsound conscience; how dangerous for a man to erre in his account in the
beginning; how dangerous, highly to offend God, and yet thinke that therein wee
doe him good seruice. A Moore killeth a Christian, and hee thinkes that hee
hath pleased God verie well in so doing: A Schismaticke throwes downe Images,
breakes glasse windowes, and defaces all carued faces, and thinkes that he
shewes therein a great deale of zealous respect and reuerence vnto God: The Iew
hates the name of Christ, and persecuteth him that takes it in his mouth;
And he thinks that he doth an acceptable thing in Gods sight. O, what
a fearefull affronting of his errour will it be to the Moore, how shamefully
will hee see himselfe cosined, when he shall behold his Mahomet
burning in Hell flames? To the Iew, to see Christ our Sauiour come with the
Majestie and glorie of God, to iudge the taunts and scoffes, and other
cruelties which they vsed towards him? To the Heretickes, to see the Saints
whom they haue burned, to sit as Assistants at their condemnation? Then will
they cry out when it will be too late, Erau
                     •
                  mus in via veritatis, We haue erred in the way of truth. And
if a man shall then see, that hee hath lost fiftie yeares of good workes, of
Prayers, Almes, Fastings, wherewith he thought to gaine and merit Heauen; O,
how lamentable will that losse appeare, when hee shall find that by them hee
hath treasured vp more wrath against the day of vengeance, more sorrow and more
torment in Hell?
            
               Quaeretis me, Yee shall seeke me. In the former Chapter
hee added, Non inu
                     •
                  
                  nietis, Yee
shall not find me. Ieremie hath the same; and the reasons thereof are
two:
            The first, Because he that seeketh sloathfully &amp; carelessely,
sildome or neuer findeth. From the time that our Sauiour Christ was borne, hee
condemned this their sloathfulnesse. The Kings came from the East to seeke him;
but the Pharisees would not step a foot out of doores to looke after him, not
hauing the light of one single Starre, but of a thousand Prophecies. In
lapide luteo lapidatu
                     •
                   est piger,
stercore bonum lapidatus est piger: The Greeke letter makes the sence more
plaine; for in stead of Lapidatus, it reads Comparatus. A
sloathfull man is compared to a durtie stone, or to the dung of an Oxe;
vnderstanding by these two, any kind of loathsome filthinesse whatsoeuer, which
the hand of man will auoyd to touch, which if it doe touch, it is besmeered and
fouled therewith. The sloathfull man is no lesse odious; for he that shall
giue himselfe ouer vnto sloath, shall be bemired in his wealth or in his
honour, and shal haue cause all the days of his life to weepe and
complaine.
            
               Signes wherby to know whether wee seeke God
  truly. Iames 4.5.Two signes the Scripture sets downe of him
that seekes God truly:
            The one, That hee seekes as earnestly to serue him, as others
desire to offend him. The Spirit that dwelleth in you, lusteth to
enuie. The Spirit is here taken in the better sence, as appeareth by the
Greeke Translation, as also by that which followeth, But he giueth more
grace. He saith then, That the holy Ghost doth put enuie into our brests,
binding euerie Soule to labour for his saluation with enuie. Saint
Paul saith, Spiritus sanctus postulat pro nobis gemitibus
inenarrabilibus; That is, He makes vs to desire it with groanes.A godly kind of Enuie. So likewise, he makes vs to desire
our saluation with enuie; that wee should haue the enuie of the worldly minded
man, and the care of the Theefe, when hee goes about his thefts and his
robberies. The beastly Epicure hotly pursues his filthie pleasures; the
reuengeful man, his reuenge. Demosthenes did enuie a Smith that was
his neighbour, for that he rose vp so early to so base and foule an Occupation.
The Theefe watcheth all night  to take a purse vpon the
highway; the Wanton waits nights and dayes at his mistresses window; the
reuengefull man will not slumber nor sleepe: with the like care art thou to
seeke after God.
            The other signe, If when thou seekest God thou meetest not with
rest &amp; quietnesse, it is a signe that thou hast not yet found him. As the
Needle rests in the North, so our Soule rests in God; Fecisti

                     •
                  os Domine ad te, &amp; inquietum
est cor nostrum, donec veniamus ad

                     •
                  e, We cannot haue our perfect
rest and quiet in this life; but he that doth enioy the same, he hath it from
God, it comes from him. But when our heart is troubled, suffering continuall
perturbations, like the Needle in the Compasse, till it be turned towards the
North; it is no good signe, that wee haue found God as we should.
            The second reason of thy not finding God, is, because thou doost
not seeke him when he is to be found. Esay preaching before
Manasses, said, Seeke yee the Lord while hee may bee found, call
yee vpon him while hee is neere:
                  Esay
  55. but this peruerse King, as the Hebrewes report it, did calumniate
this his doctrine; alledging, That it was a great error in him, to say, that
God could not at any time be found, being that Moses had said,
What Nation is there so great,
               
                  Deut.
  4.7. 
               that hath their Gods so nigh vnto them, as the Lord our God is
in all things that we call vpon him for? But the truth is, That as there
is a time for all things, [Omnia tempus habent] so is there a time
likewise to find God, and a time not to find him: the time that wee liue heere
vpon Earth, is no ill time for to find him. For though in the Ages of man there
is one time better than another, none is so desperate and hopelesse but that he
may bee found therein; and of all the whole life of man it may bee verified,
Omnis qui quaerit, inuenit, Euerie one finds that seekes.
            
            At the point of death it is no good time to seeke him; not that
hee that shall then truly seeke after him shall not find him; but because it is
a hard matter at that verie instant to performe true repentance, as wee haue
elsewhere declared. And therefore the Scripture so often cries out vnto vs,
That yet while it is day we should hearken vnto him, lest the night of death
should suddenly ouertake vs. What saith Eccl. Ante mortem confiteri,
i. Confesse before thou die. S. Austen expounds this place
of confession of our sinnes. And because no man should hope to do it in the
time of his sicknesse, when paines &amp; diuers other accidents diuert the
Soule; Eccles. addeth, Viuus &amp; sanus, &amp;c.
               Confession of sinne when to be made. 
               Confesse thy selfe
whilest thou art healthie and sound, not when thou art halfe dead; and therein
shalt thou doe two notable things:
            
               The one, Thou shalt praise God.
            
            
               The other, Thou shalt glorie in his mercies.
            
            After death, is a desperate time; for then the doore is shut to
Confession, to Repentance, to Intercessions, and to pardon: A mortuo, quasi
nihil perijt confessio, Saint Augustine reads it, Quasi non
sit; the Greeke letter, Tanquam à non existente. When a
mans life ends, there is an end of all remedies: And therefore Salomon
said, That a liuing Dog was better than a dead Lyon: And Ieremie,
               
                  Eccle. 9. Ier. 13. 
               Giue glorie to the
Lord your God, before he cause darkenesse, and before your feet stumble vpon
the darke mountaines; and while yee looke for light, yee turne it into the
shadow of death, and make it grosse darkenesse.
            A third reason why we doe not find God, is, because wee doe not
perseuer in seeking him: And therefore it is said, Yee shall seeke me, and
shall not find me. S Austen sayes, That the Iewes did seeke
after God three manner of wayes:
            One, By hoping after another Messias.
            Another, By persecuting him both in his life and in his death: For
that piercing of his bodie with a Speare, did plainely proue now that he was
dead, what  hatred they bore to him while he was
aliue.
            The third, when they being besieged by Titus and
Vespasian, calling to mind, that he had foretold them, there should
not be one stone left vpon another in Ierusalem, many of them returned to our
Sauiour Christ, and sought after him; but with a very poore &amp; weake
purpose: They did inherit this euil condition of their forefathers, and
grandfathers of old, who did neuer seeke God, but when hee scourged them
soundly for their sins: And when that storme was past, and their peace made,
they fell afresh to their former rebellions. There are few men so past grace,
which doe not sometimes sigh for Heauen. But the mischiefe of it is, that these
our sighes are quickly ouerblowne, they doe not last with vs. In the darkest
night, there are some lightnings which breake through the clouds and cleare the
ayre; but in the end the darkenesse preuaileth. In your duskiest &amp;
cloudiest daies, the Sun is woont to rush through the foggiest &amp; thickest
clouds; but new cloudes arising, the Sunne retires himselfe and pulls in his
head. Saul by spurts did dart foorth many beames of light,
acknowledging that Dauid had done him many reall courtesies, and that
he had repayed him euill for good, and had a purpose with himselfe vpon fits to
fauor him, and to honour him; But the foggy clouds and mystie vapours of Enuy
increasing more and more vpon him, these light flashes were turned into
darkenesse. Balaam, when King Balack sent vnto him to curse
Gods people, had verie good purposes and desires for a while within him; He
consulted with God in that businesse, and knowing that it was his wil, that he
should not go, dispatched those his messengers. And the King sending others
vnto him, he told them, That he would not go to that end, if hee would giue him
his house full of gold. Doubtlesse, these were good intensions, had he
continued still in the same mind. But the clouds of couetousnesse did ouercast
this light of his vnderstanding with so grosse a darkenesse, that neither the
Angel which stood before him with a naked sword in the way, nor his beast which
spake vnto him, and turned aside, could keepe him backe.
            
               In peccato vestro moriemini.
               
                  Yee shall dye in your sinne. There are great indeerings
  in the holy Scripture, of the grieuousnesse of sinne, and the hurt that comes
  thereby. Anselmus sayth, That he had rather fry without sin in the
  flames of Hel, than with sin, inioy Heauen. Hee might well say so, in regard
  of Hel. For although Saint Austen saith, That one drop of the water of
  Paradise shall be sufficient to quench the flames of Hell,The foulnes of Sinne. yet shall it not be able to wash away
  the foulnesse of sinne. Helias desired of God, that he might dye vnder
  the Iuniper tree; and yet he would not be rid of his life by Iezabell,
  in regard of the sinne that tyrannicall Queen should haue committed: so that
  euen in his mortall enemy, so great an ill seemed intollerable vnto him.
               In Scripture, sinne is a cypher of all possible infelicitie and
  misfortune tha
                     •
                   can befall a man.
  Saint Paul sayth, That God made his Sonne sinne. Him who knew no
  sinne, hee made sinne for vs. For discharging vpon him the tempest of his
  wrath, he made him of all other men the most miserable. Nouissimum vir
                        •
                     rum. Iacob would not let
  Beniamin goe downe with his brethren to Aegypt (Ioseph
  desiring to haue it so) though Reuben had offered two of his owne
  sons as pledges for his safe return,
                     Gen. 43.
  &amp; to the end that the good old man should haue the best securitie he could
  giue him; Reuben sayd, If he returne not, Ero peccati reus; I
  will be content to be condemned to all possible miseries whatsoeuer. The like
  Bersabe was willing to say, when she thought the raigne of her sonne
  Salomon should  be troubled. Shall I and my
  sonne Salomon bee counted Offenders? Shall wee bee the out-casts
  of the world, and be layd open to the vtmost of miserie? The reason of all
  this harme, is, For that all possible ill, that can be imagined, is reduced
  vnto sinne, as to it's Center. Make a muster of all the enemies of Man, as
  Death, the Deuill, the World, &amp; the Flesh; &amp; not any one of them, nay
  not all of them together haue any the least power to hurt vs without sinne. And
  therefore in our Lords prayer, silencing all other our enemies, only we beg of
  God, that he would free vs from sinne. But deliuer vs from euill.
  Which, howbeit some doe vnderstand it to be spoken of the Deuill, yet (as
  Saint Austen sayth) he can but barke, he cannot bite. Onely sinne is
  able to doe both.
               To this so great a hurt, may be added another that is farre
  greater.Obstinacie in sin, neuer to be cured. Which
  is obstinacie in sinne. Iob painting out this euill, sayth, That the
  sinner taketh pleasure therein, and that it seemeth sweet vnto him, it is as
  pellets of Sugar to him vnder his tongue; He first delights in the companie of
  sinne, then hee marries himselfe vnto her, and at last, leaues her not till
  death them depart. Parcet illi, &amp; non derelinquet. The seuentie
  read it, Non parcet illi, &amp; non derelinquet, hee will excuse no
  occasion, no diligence, no trouble. His desire thereof is insatiable. There is
  no kind of sinne (be it of Sloath, or Reuenge, or Couetousnesse) that is
  continually beating vpon our actions. But our thoughts are euermore hammering
  of wickednesse, like the Smith, that giues a hundred blowes vpon his Anuill,
  and two vpon his yron; or like the Barbar, that makes more snips in the ayre,
  than on the haire.
               The Pharisees did crucifie our Sauiour Christ but once,Sin, desirous to doe more than it is able. in the verie
  deed and act of his death; but in their desires, &amp; in their thoughts, they
  had crucified him a thousand times.
               But that we may giue the obstinacie of this people, it's full
  qualification, we must make a briefe recapitulation of those meanes, which God
  vsed for to mollifie their hardnesse.
               First of all; he tooke it to his charge to cure it with his
  Doctrine, his Miracles, and the Prophecies of their Prophets. Well, this would
  doe no good with them, and many dyed in this their obstinacie. Next, he comes
  amongst them in his owne person, taking vpon him the name and office of a
  Phisition, Purgationem peccatorum faciens, Making a purge for sinne.
  He was willing to haue ministred Phisicke to the Iewes, and with the sweet and
  comfortable syrrop of his Word, to haue eased them of their griefes, and to
  haue cured all the infirmities of their bodies; as the sicke of the Palsey for
  eight and thirtie yeares together, the Blind that were borne blind, and such as
  were possessed with Deuils, and the like; Being willing also to haue cleansed
  their soules from all kind of vncleannesse: But at last hee was faine to giue
  them ouer, their diseases were growne so desperate, remitting them ad
  hospitalium incurabilium, as men without hope of recouerie. For, as in the
  body, there are some sickenesses so mortall, that though the sicke bee capable
  of health, yet the malignity of the humour, maketh the Phisition to despaire
  therof: So likewise in the soule, there are some diseases so mortall, that
  through the great malignity of them, and the sharpenesse of the humour, the
  heauenly Physition is out of heart of helping them, and quite discouraged from
  doing any good vpon them. And therefore sayth, Yee shall dye in your sinne.
  Ieremie maketh mention, that certaine Angells comming by Gods appointment
  to cure Babylon, after that they had applyed many medicines vnto her, they
  sayd, Wee would haue healed Babylon, but shee is not healed,
                  
                     Esay 51. 
                  let vs therefore forsake her,
  and euery one goe his way from her. Lo, the Lord of 
  Angells himselfe, and of all the Hosts of Heauen, comes vnto them, offers to
  cure them, by applying the Medicines of his Word and his Miracles; but they
  refuse to bee holpen, and so he leaues them amongst the Catalogue of the
  Incurable.
               Secondly, The prayer which Christ made for them vpon the Crosse,
  was a strange meanes; and though he then conuerted a Theefe, yet could he not
  conuert a Pharisee. Saint Stephen made the like prayer, Lay not
  this sinne, ô Lord, vnto their charge, Let not the sinne ofthis
  people be a sinne vnto death. In a word, the bloud of our Sauiour Christ
  softneth the hardnesse of stones, but mollifieth not the hearts of the
  Iewes.
               Thirdly, an occasion once lost, as it is seldome or neuer
  recouered, so is it ordinarily bewailed. Horace saith of Vertue, That
  hee that inioyes it, esteemes it not; but hauing lost it, enuies it. Of
  Herod, Iosephus reporteth, That he caused his wife to be put to death
  vpon a false accusation, and she was scarce cold, but that he pined away for
  her. Alexander killed Clitus, and wept ouer him when he had
  done. Athens exiled Socrates, &amp; afterwards repenting themselues
  thereof, they erected his Statua, and banished his Accusers. Abimelec
  banished Isaac out of his Countrie, and afterwards went to seeke for
  him, &amp;c. Humane and diuine Histories are full of this truth: onely in the
  brests of the Pharisees this remorse and pittie could find no place: but hauing
  lost in Christ our Sauior, the happiest occasion that euer the world inioyed;
  yet such and so great was this their wilfull obstinacie, that they were so
  farre from weeping or bewailing either his or their owne losse, that if they
  could catch him now againe aliue, they would crucifie him anew.
               Great obstinacies, great stiffenesse and stubbornenesse doth the
  Scripture mention;The hardheartednesse of the Iewes
 without a parallell. 3. Kings. 16 as that of the Gyants, which
  built the Tower of Babell; that of Pharaoh, whom so many seuerall
  plagues could not vnharden; that of Saul, Ieroboam, Antiochus, &amp;
  Herod Ascalonita; that of Elah and of Zimri, who
  went into the pallace of the Kings house, and burnt the Kings house ouer him
  with fire, and died. But none was like vnto that of this people, for their
  hardnes of heart hath now continued aboue 1600 yeares.
               Aboue all these harmes, there is one that is yet greater than
  the rest, which is this present threatning, Yee shall die in your
  sinne. Of all disasters that may befall vs, this is not only greater, but
  the summe of all the rest. How many businesses offer themselues vnto men in
  this life, though they bee of Empires and Monarchies, which will be but as it
  were accessorie vnto them, and not much trouble them, whither they succeed well
  or ill? But this is so precise a one, and so necessarie, that he that loseth
  it, loseth all; and not onely all present good, but the future hope of euer
  recouering it againe. Saint Paul writing to those of Corinth, comes
  vpon them with an Obsecro, vt vestrum negotium agatis, i. I
  beseech you mind your owne businesse; your owne businesse, by an
  Antonomasia; for all the rest are aliena, others. Seneca in an Epistle
  that he writeth to Lucilius, saith, That a man spendeth part of his
  life in doing ill, and the greater part in vnprofitable things; and all his
  life, in not looking well what he doth: As, he that prayes without attention;
  he that reads with a diuerted mind: if he would haue spoke like a Christian,
  he might haue put them in mind of many, who spend all their life, or the
  greatest part thereof, by placing their thoughts vpon their end. At this marke
  did Dauid aime in many of his prayers.
                     Psal. 49.5. 
                  Cassiodorus thus expoundeth
  that place of the fortie ninth Psalme, The iniquitie of my heeles shall
  compasse mee about. The head is Principium hominis, the verie
  life and first beginning of man; and the heele  is taken
  for the end and finall dissolution of man: And he saith, That his greatest care
  was the continuall remembrance of his end. He repeateth the like in many other
  of his Psalmes, Exurge Domine, ne repellas in finem, Arise Lord, put vs not
  off to the end. Vsque quo Domine obliuisceris me? How long wilt thou forget me,
  to the end? Lord let me know my end: I euer, ô Lord, had an eye to
  the perill and danger of my end. Take me not away in the middest of my
  dayes; for that is not a fit time for a mans end. In a word, true
  happinesse or vnhappiness consists in it's arriuall at it's Hauen; for it
  little importeth, to haue escaped this or that storme, vnlesse we come to land
  safely. It is not sufficient for a man to haue spent a great deale of money in
  a Law suit, vnlesse hee haue sentence on his side. It is the euening that
  commendeth the day, and our end that crowneth our actions, &amp;c.
            
            
               In peccato vestro moriemini.
               
                  Yee shall die in your sinne. We are not ignorant, that
  God reuealed to many of his Saints their predestination, as to Marie
  Magdalen, and his Apostles; but to none their reprobation, lest the
  infallibilitie ofthis reuelation should thrust them into desperation. And these
  words, Yee shall die in your sinne,
                  
                     Ob.
                   seemeth to bee a plaine prophecie, that this
  people were to die in their sinne. I answer,
                     Sol.
                   That this cannot be a reuelation, for two
  reasons:
               The one, Because the Pharisees did not beleeue; and in not
  giuing credit to our Sauiour Christ in the truth that hee vttered for their
  good, it is likely they would not beleeue those that he deliuered for their
  hurt.
               The other, For that our Sauiour Christ repeating the verie selfe
  same proposition, made it conditionall, Vnlesse yee beleeue, yee shall die
  in your sinne; which was as it were a declaration of the former.
               In a word, Two were those things which our Sauiour Christ
  pretended:
               One, That they might beleeue, and not die in their sinne.
               The other, That they who now treated with him should die in
  their sinne:Gods prescience not the cause of mans
 Reprobation. but so, that Christ our Sauiour should not be the cause of
  their damnation, but their owne incredulitie. For that which is spoken of
  before it come to passe, it is therfore spoken of, because it shal come to
  passe; but it shal not therfore come to passe, because it is spoken of: For the
  Diuine prescience or foreknowledge, though it aduise that which shall come to
  passe, yet it imposeth not any necessitie that it shall come to passe. Saint
  Peter therefore did not denie Christ, because our Sauiour told him,
  that he should denie him. So that diuine knowledge not deceiuing it selfe in
  that which it prophecieth, imposeth no such necessitie that it should succeed,
  nor is it to be said to be the cause thereof.
                     Eccl.
 15.11.12. 
                  Say not thou it is through the Lord that I fell away;
  for thou oughtest not to doe the things that hee hateth. Say not thou, He hath
  caused me to erre; for he hath no need of the sinfull man: so that he there
  prooueth, that God is not the author of our sins, nor are our ignorances to be
  attributed vnto him. The Greeke instead of Abest, there reads
  Defeci; as inferring, That God is not the cause that I haue failed in
  that which I ought to haue done; for God abhorring sinne, I ought not to commit
  it. Saint Augustine reads, Ne dicas propter Deum recessi, &amp;c.
  Say not, I went backe because of the Lord, hee supplanted mee; for God hath no
  need of wicked men. Suting with that of Saint Iames, Let no man when
  hee is tempted, say hee is tempted of God, &amp;c. And yet it is said by
  Ezechiel, Ego decepi Prophetam, I haue deceiued the Prophet. And by
  Saint Paul, Tradidit Deus illos in reprobum sensum,
                  
                     Romans 1. 
                  God hath deliuered them vp to a
  reprobate sence. It is not to be said, That God doth it, but permits it:
  As a captaine, who absenting himselfe from his Armie, depriuing them of his
  fauour, permitteth  them to bee ouercome. Saint
  Augustine telleth vs, That when the Scripture saith, That man is
  deceiued by God, or his heart hardned; God is the cause of the poena,
  but not of the culpa: of the punishment, but not of the sinne. Insipientia
  enim hominis violat vias eius, (i.) The follie of a man is that which
  peruerts his wayes. In one place the Scripture saith, Deus Mortem non
  fecit, God made not Death; In another,
                     Wis.
 1. That Death and Life come from God: implying, That God is not the
  Authour of Death, but that hee permits it in him that deserues it. That Iudge
  that condemnes a theefe vnto death, this death is not to be imputed to the
  judge, but to the thefts of the Theefe. God desires not any mans fall, or his
  death; for as God is happy without the just, so is he also without the wicked.
  The book of Wisedome treating, That God did not make death, nor
  delighteth in the destruction of the liuing; renders two reasons thereof:
               The one, That he hauing created all things that they might haue
  their beeing, he takes no pleasure that they should not be: For what Artificer
  takes pleasure to see the workes of his hands perish?
               The other, Sanabiles fecit Nationes orbis Terrarum; The
  Greeke reads Sal
                        •
                     
                     tares fecit
  Generationes orbis Terrarum, All things that God created, hee created with
  health and soundnesse, and in a good and perfect state. Et non est in illis
  medicamentum exterminij; The Greeke word which answers to
  Medicamentum, may be taken in a good or an euill sence, either for
  Physicke, or for Poyson: And here it is taken in the worser sence, and implyeth
  thus much, That God did not create the Poyson of perdition for the generations
  of Mankind, (inferred in this word Exterminij) nor did God create
  perdition in the rest of the creatures. The Interlinearie here vnderstands
  Sinne, which banisheth and excludeth man from God, wherby he is vndone, and
  reduced to nothing. From which finall destruction God deliuer vs, &amp;c.
            
         
         
            
            THE THIRTEENTH SERMON, VPON THE TVESDAY AFTER THE SECOND SONDAY
IN LENT.
            
               
                  MAT. 23. 
                  
                     Super Cathedram Moysi sederunt Scribae.
                   
                  The Scribes sate vpon Moses Chaire.
               
            
            
               THe chaire of Moses was descredited by the euil life of
the Scribes and Pharisees, who occupied the same.Christs
  Doctrine effectuall, by whomsoeuer it be vttered. Our Sauiour Christ
here treateth of giuing such and so great authoritie to his Doctrine, that
though it should be deliuered by the coldest mouth in the world, yet should not
that hinder it's bringing forth of fruit. And to this purpose he proposes three
opinions, which are no lesse certaine, than important:
            The one, That a Doctor, though vnholy in his owne person, may sit
&amp; beare rule in Cathedra sanctitatis, in Moses chaire,
and seat of holinesse.
            The other, That the vicious life of the Teacher doth not derogate
from the dignitie and authoritie of his Doctrine, nor rob the Hearer of his
profit.
            The third, That though a mans Doctrine be neuer so diuine, yet if
his life be not good, it is the Teacher, and not the Hearer that takes hurt
thereby.
            
               Super Cathedram Moysi sederunt Principes, &amp;c.
               
                  Euthimius saith, That this Cathedra or Chaire,
  was the Pulpit where the Scribes and Pharisees did preach the Law; as it is
  related by Esdras, in his second Booke, and eigth Chapter. Saint
  Hierome and Bede vnderstand thereby the doctrine of
  Moses; for that it was vsuall with him that did teach, to sit in a
  Chaire. And albeit it appeareth both in Saint Luke, and the Acts
  of the Apostles, That they did preach vnto the people standing on their
  feet;
                     Luke 4. Acts. 13. yet in your
  Schools your Doctors doe alwaies read sitting. It is called Moses his
  Chaire, not onely because the Law did discend from the Mount, but because (as
  some Hebrewes haue it) he was the first legall Priest, and exercised that
  office before his brother Aaron. Abenezra stiles him, Sacerdos
  Sacerdotum, a Priest of Priests, for that he consecrated his brother
  Aaron, and receiued the offerings of the twelue Princes in the
  Tabernacle. Dauid likewise giues him the same name; Moses and
  Aaron among his Priests. Philon saith, That he was a King, a
  Lawgiuer, a Prophet, &amp; a Priest. Gregorie Nazianzen, Saint
  Augustine, and Saint Hierome jumpe together in that 
   point. From Moses, God had preserued the
  Catholicke doctrine in the Prophets and other his Saints, til Simeons
  time, in whose days the Synagogue had it's end. The Scribes and Pharisees were
  a kind of people that had the command of that Kingdome. The Scribes did
  flourish in knowledge, so is it reported by Epiphanius. Their
  obligation was two fold:
               The one, To propose the Law vnto the people, and to expound the
  hard places of Scripture; and for this reason they were called Lectores,
  Readers.
               
               The other, To be Iudges and Deciders of causes (as it appeareth
  by the Chronicles) betwixt Citisen and Citisen. The Pharisees did
  flourish in Religion, and were called Pharisees, of Phares, which
  signifies, a separation; for that they liued apart from the ordinarie and
  common course of life, &amp; did seuer themselues from other people, in a more
  especiall kind of obseruance. Saint Hierome doth set downe the first
  rising of these manner of men,Christs doctrine effectuall
 by whomsoeuer it be vttered. in whom the appearances of sanctitie, and
  outward demonstrations of holinesse of life, were verie great and shew-glorious
  aboue the rest, and whose penitences (as Iosephus and
  Epiphanius report them) were verie sharpe, and verie publique; but
  farre greater was their hypocrisie, their ambition, their auarice, and
  vaine-glorie. And therefore our Sauiour Christ doth here deale so curstly with
  them, and vseth them with that sourenesse and bitternesse of words, that all
  this Chapter is nothing else but a seuere reprehension of the Scribes and
  Pharisees. And for that it is an ordinarie thing with the common people, to set
  his doctrine at naught, who leads a naughty life, [Cuius enim vita
  despicitur, necesse est vt predicatio contemnatur, Whose life is despised, his
  preaching must of necessitie be contemned] our Sauiour Christ in defence
  of the Catholicke Doctrine, said, Super, &amp;c. Vpon the Chaire of Moses,
  &amp;c.
               
               It was the errour of some, That a mortall and deadly sinne
  depriueth the Pope of his Popedome: but this was condemned by the Constantine,
  Florentine, and Tridentine Councels; for neither doth the Doctrine thereby
  receiue any harm, nor the See loose it's Iurisdiction and authoritie. Which is
  no more than is deliuered by Saint Augustine, in expounding that
  place of the fortie fourth Psalme, In stead of thy Fathers thou shalt haue
  Children. Beda, and Anacletus the Pope, both say, That to our
  Faith, is not onely hypothecated and ingaged the authoritie of Priest and
  Bishop; but that of our Sauiour Christ, that of the Apostles, and that of the
  seuentie two Disciples. But suppose that all these Ministers should haue
  sinned, yet the authoritie of our Sauiour Christ remains safe and sure.
  What matters it whither the Minister be bad, where the Lord is so
  good? How much more then in the Church ought wee not (as
  Tertullian saith) to qualifie Faith by the persons, but the persons by
  Faith. This Doctrine Iudas made good, by doing miracles, by preaching
  the Gospell, and by condemning him that did not receiue it, as if he had
  reiected Christ himselfe. Cayphas doth likewise proue this point, who,
  as he was High-Priest, did determine that Decree which had already beene
  ordained in Heauen. The like president we haue in the Prophet Balaam,
  who though he went of purpose to curse Gods people, yet was forced whither he
  would or no, to blesse them. And the Scribes &amp; Pharisees being asked,
  Where our Sauiour should be borne; answered, In Bethlem of
  Iudaea. Those Bishops whom Saint Iohn reprehendeth and threatneth
  in the Reuelation,
                  
                     Apoc. 3. yet for
  all this doth he not remooue from them the name of Angells; Dignitas enim
  Officij non amiti
                        •
                     
                     tur per
  indignitatem personae, The office ought not to be thought the worse of,
  for the vnworthinesse of him that supplies that place. Per me Reges
  regnant; They representing Gods person, as their Ministers doe their
  persons.
               There is nothing so surely grounded in holy Scripture, as the
  perpetuitie of  the Church. And this is one reason,
  amongst many other, why the Church is called Heauen. And as no strange
  impressions approch Heauen, and as those waters of the Flood, which did rise
  so many cubits aboue the tops of the highest Mountaines, could neuer come to
  touch Heauen; so,
                     Math. 16. Luke 21.
 Ioh. 14.16, 17. 1. Tim. 3. 1. Iohn 2. neither
  the persecutions of strangers, nor the sinnes of his Ministers, shall euer
  ouerthrow the firme foundation of the Church, or the truth thereof. Si
  dereliquerint filij eius legem meam, If the children of the Church shall
  forsake my Law, my hand shall be heauie vpon them, and I shall bring many
  miseries vpon them: Miserecordiam autem meam non dispergam, But my
  mercie and my truth shall still remaine safe and sound; that shall I establish
  for euer: The Lord hath made a faithfull Oath vnto Dauid,
                  
                     Psal. 132.11. 
                  and he shal not shrinke from
  it.
               
               From whence I inferre two things:
               The one, That Moses his Chaire lost nothing of it's
  respect, through the Scribes and Pharisees vices, as Saint Cyprian
  hath obserued; nor likewise Saint Peters Chaire, by the lesse laudable
  life of those Bishops which succeeded him, (which is the maine drift and
  principall intent of this Gospell:) For (as Saint Augustine hath noted
  it) our Sauiour did not seeme to looke so much towards the Sunne setting, as
  toward the Sun rising; to wit, towards the Cathedra or Chaire of the
  Iewes, as towards the Pontificium of the Christians; wherein there was
  to be Bishops, whose liues, although they should not alwayes happen to be holy,
  nor their workes and actions so good as they ought to be, yet their Doctrine
  and their Preaching should still bee warrantable. Some, seeing some Bishops
  lesse holy than they should be, haue multiplied Inuectiues, Satyres, and
  impudent and vnseemely Pasquills vpon them; not considering, that works that
  want their weight &amp; goodnesse, doe not condemne the Doctrine of Faith, nor
  weigh downe the ballance against the Chaire of the Church. And that our
  Sauiour himselfe did preuent this inconuenience, by saying, Super
  Cathedram Moysi, Vpon the Chaire of Moses. Of such great force and vertue
  is the Doctrine of this Chaire, that it did not much stand vpon setling the
  same vpon base and meane subiects: for the same was placed in the mouthes of
  rude and ignorant Fishermen, to the end that none should attribute the
  victorie to their owne naturall gifts, though neuer so good. So sometimes he
  puts this Chaire into the hands of sinnefull men, because thereby men may see,
  that the vertue is in the Sword, which is the Word of God, and not in the arme,
  that is but flesh.
            
            
               Quaecunque dixerint vobis, facite.
               
                  Whatsoeuer they shall say vnto you, doe. Saint
  Peter treating of the respect and obedience which we owe to our
  Superiours, saith,1. Peter 2. 
                  Seruants
  be subiect to your Masters with all feare, not onely to the good and
  courteous, but also to the froward. If then to such crosse carnall masters
  we doe owe so much respect and obedience, What shall we beare to those that are
  our Spirituall Lords? Saint Paul saith, Let euerie Soule be
  subiect to the higher Powers: For whosoeuer resisteth the Power,
                     Rom. 13. resisteth the Ordinance of God; for there
  is no power but of God: And therefore to contradict our Superiour, is to
  contradict God himselfe. And it was high time for the Apostle to broach this
  opinion; for the world sent forth Nero's, Claudia's, and
  Caligula's, and other Tyrants, which did deserue the name of fierce
  and cruell Beasts: But the wickednesse and perdition of Princes must not make
  those to lose their respect towards them, which are borne to obey; which point
  Saint Cyprian presseth home to the purpose.
               
                  Whatsoeuer they shall say vnto you, doe. Some man may
  doubt, How is it possible  for him that liues ill, to
  doe otherwise than teach ill; nay, rather it may seeme a kind of miracle, that
  his life being bad, his preaching should be good; especially hauing our
  Sauiours warrant for the same,
                     Math. 16.
                  How can yee being euill, speake good things? And this difficultie is
  increased by that which our Sauiour sayd before, Take heed of the leauen
  of the Pharisees: Vnderstanding by the Leauen, the doctrine which they
  taught. Wee find in the Gospell, That they raised vp many false witnesses
  against the Law. Saint Mathew reporteth, That they taught, It was
  lawfull to sweare by the Temple, but not by the Gold of the Temple; and by the
  Alter, but not by the Offering, &amp;c. I answer, That the name of
  Cathedra, or of Moses Chaire, comprehendeth and includeth in
  it two things:
               The one, Iurisdiction, for to command and chastise.
               The other, Authority, for to teach and instruct.
               In a Prelate likewise two other things are to be considered:

                  s Life.
               Secondly, His Doctrine.
               As it was an especiall effect of his diuine prouidence, That the
  vertue of the Sacraments should not be annexed and wedged to the goodnesse of
  the Minister, for that many might thereby lose the fruit of receiuing them
  aright; so likewise the goodnesse of the Doctrine is not tyed to the Prelates
  goodnesse;
                     Esay 59.21. 
                  I wil make this my
  Couenant with them, (saith the Lord) My Spirit that is vpon thee, and
  my words which I haue put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor
  out of the mouth of thy Seed (saith the Lord) from henceforth euen for
  euer. S. Augustine in his book De Doctrina Christiana,
  and in that which hee wrote against Faustum Manicheum, saith,
  Cathedra Moysi, &amp;c. The Chaire of Moses, wherein they sate and bare
  rule, did inforce them to teach well though they liued ill; besides, Moses in
  his Chaire did not allow of any strange Doctrine.
               
               And in case such a one shall read himselfe, and vent in the
  Chaire the froth of his owne wit, God is so farre from commanding this man to
  be obeyed, that he coniureth both the Old and New Testament against him.
                     Ierem. 23.9. 
                  Ieremie speaketh thus to the
  Prophets, Myne heart breaketh within me because of the Prophets,
  (those false Prophets which deceiue the People) all my bones shake; I
  am like a drunken man, and like a man whom Wine hath ouercome, for the presence
  of the Lord, and for his holy words. The Priest and the Prophet shake hands,
  and ioyne both together in the perdition of my sheep, and applaud themselues in
  these their errors; but they shal haue no great cause to brag and boast
  thereof, for I will giue them Hemlocke to eat, and Gall to drinke. The
  Prophets of Ierusalem haue defiled the Land, and haue beene the onely
  Authors of all those mischiefes that are now afoot in the World. The Priest
  and the Prophet are defiled, and haue strengthened the hands of the
  Wicked.
                  
                     Ierem. 13. These Prophets then,
  ô Lord, being that wee may not imitate their workes, Shall we giue
  credit to their words? They doe not teach vs that which God reuealeth vnto
  them, but the inuentions of their owne braine, and the foolish imaginations of
  their owne hearts.
                     Ezech. 13. All the whole
  thirteenth Chapter of Ezechiel is full of these complaints and
  threatnings. And in the twentie third Chapter he repeateth that which was
  spoken by Ieremias, Heare not the words of those that see vanitie, and
  diuine lyes. And in the thirteenth Chapter of De
                        •
                     
                     tronomie,
                  
                     Deut.
 13. 
                  If thyne owne brother shall persuade thee to serue strange gods,
  hearken not vnto him, &amp;c. In the New Testament there are many cleere
  and plaine places to this purpose: As in Math. 7. Rom. 16.
  Tim. 1. &amp; 3. Titus 3. and Thessalonians
  3. And Saint Iohn in his Canonicall Epistle, If any man shall
  declare any other Gospell, 
                        〈◊〉
                      him
  be accursed. In a word, The Doctrine which appertaineth to the Truth, God 
   commands vs to serue &amp; obey the same; &amp; all the
  rest, to shun and auoyd it. Chrysostome expounding those words,
  All things whatsoeuer they shall say vnto you, doe; saith, All those
  things that are not repugnant to the Law of God. And the phrase of Scripture
  is, Children obey your Parents in all things; and Seruants obey your carnal
  Masters in all things: which is to be vnderstood, in all those things
  wherein they ought to obey them.
               There is sometimes in your Prelates a kind of sickenesse like
  vnto that of Iob, who when all the rest of his bodie was full of sores
  and botches, yet his lips remained whole and sound; Onely my lippes are
  left about my teeth.
                  
                     Iob 19. And because
  the lips of the Priest are the depositorie of the wisedome of God, [according
  to that of Malachie, The Priests lips preserue knowledge: and
  Ezechiel,
                  
                     Malach. 2. Ezech.
 44.23. That God hath charged his Priests, That they shall teach his
  people the difference betweene the holy and prophane, and cause them to
  discerne betweene the vncleane and the cleane; and that he wil giue them light
  to decide such controuersies as shal come before them] wee may verie well giue
  credit to that which they shall say. Quaecunque dixerint vobis,
  facite; shunne therefore their workes, but obey their words.
               Saint Augustine drawes in the example of the Vine
  enuironed with Bushes and Thornes; willing thee to gather the Grapes, and let
  the Briars alone. Saint Chrysostome introduceth diuers other
  examples: Out of the Mines take the gold, and throw away the drosse; From your
  Standards, the Roses that smell sweet, and put by the prickles that may offend
  thee; From your soure Hearbes, your sweet Honey; from your durtie Shells, your
  orientall Pearle; and from your fruits take away the huskes and the parings.
  Vpon one &amp; the same Tree there may be two sorts of Fruits; the one
  wholsome, the other mortall; eat the good, &amp; hate the bad. Sampson
  suckt Honey out of the jaw of a Beast, and let the bone alone. Saint
  Chrysostome, Si male vixerint, &amp;c. If they liue ill, that's theirs; if
  they teach wel, that's ours: Take therefore that which is thine, and leaue that
  which is anothers alone to himselfe. In euerie Teacher there is a life,
  and a doctrine; the life is his, the doctrine thyne: chuse thou that which is
  thine, and cease thou to examine what is his. Si separaberis pretiosum
  à vili, quasi Os meum eris, If thou separate the pretious from the vile,
  thou shalt be as my Mouth. Pretious meat in a foule plate, is the
  Doctrine of Heauen in an ill life. Saint Augustine points out vnto vs
  three kind of Ministers Pastor, mercenarius, latro, foue, tolera,
  fuge. The Sheepheard, the Hireling, and the Theefe; all enter into the
  Sheepefold; but the Sheepeheard and the Hireling teach good Doctrine; the
  Theefe, bad: Flie from the Theefe; beare with the Hireling; but loue the true
  Sheepheard.
               
                  Whatsoeuer they shall say vnto you, doe.
                  Three sorts of Ministers. If God command that wee respect
  and obey the Sheepheards for their good words, though their actions bee naught;
  he that shall contemne his Pastor who is holy both in his life and doctrine,
  What fauour can he hope for? One of those fauours which God promised to his
  people, was, To giue them Gouernours that should be Peace it selfe, and
  Iustice itselfe. Ponam visitationem tuam pacem, &amp; pr
                        ••
                     positos tuos justiciam. Hee stiles
  Iudges, Masters, and Gouernors, with the name of Visitation; and saith, That
  they shall be his peace, and his justice; speaking it in abstracto,
  which carrieth more force with it, than if it had beene vttered in
  concreto. For admit that a Prelat be a Lyon, and that (as
  Ecclesiasticus saith) Euertit domesticos eius, and that hee
  begin to rome and rage about the house, there is not any whip comparable to his
  Iustice. For albeit Charitie (saith Saint Gregorie) makes him sweet
  and louely; yet his zeale to justice must make him to bee sharpe and seuere.
  Many of these  Prelats hath the Church formerly enioyed,
  and enioyeth now at this present; as well in supreame Bishops, as inferiour
  Ministers, whereby this prophecie is fulfilled.
            
            
               Secundum opera eorum, nolite facere.
               
                  1. Kings. 2.
                  According to
  their workes doe not. Samuel did obey Ely the Priest, but did not
  imitate his remissenesse and sluggishnesse: Daniel did reuerence
  Nebucadnezar, but adored not his Statua. It is a miserable case, that
  a man should bee able to teach others, and not himselfe. There is not any one
  fault threatned more in Scripture,
                     Rom. 2.
  than this, Qui praedicaris in Lege, &amp;c. And thinkest thou this, ô
  thou man that iudgest them that doe such things, and doost the same, that thou
  shalt escape the iudgment of God? Thou shalt be like the Sieue, which
  giueth Corne to others, and keepes the Chaffe to it's selfe: Like the Candle,
  that lightens others, and is itselfe in darkenesse: And like vnto that
  Carpenter, who making the Arke, saued others, and was himselfe drowned in the
  waters of the Floud. Saint Augustine saith, That the lips and the
  heart of him that liueth ill, and preacheth well, are at great defiance one
  with another; for the heart belyes what the mouth persuades. When the Angell
  threatned Moses with death, and made shew as if hee meant to kill him;
  Rupertus and Lyra are both of opinion, That it was for the
  neglect and carelesnesse which hee had committed in circumcising one of his
  children, in such a season, when as the Law did oblige him thereunto: And the
  fault was much more in Moses, than in any other ordinarie man, for
  that as a Law-giuer, he was to haue published this verie Law. But more to the
  matter is that reason which Saint Augustine rendreth; which is, That
  the Angells threatning of him was, for that he being to persuade the Hebrewes
  to goe out of Aegypt, and to take their wiues and childeren along with them,
  they might haue presumed, that he had one thing in his mouth, and another in
  his heart, and that his workes did not correspond with his words. Experience
  teacheth vs, That many things which humane eloquence cannot persuade, example
  doth effect: for the way by words is about, and verie tedious; but that of
  example, short, and quickely rid. The earth will not follow the motion of the
  heauens, though yee preach vnto it neuer so much; but the Sheepe wil soone
  learne to follow the example of his Sheepheard. The Prophets are full of the
  complaints and threatnings which God poureth forth against the bad example of
  Pastors: As in Osee the fift,
                     Ose. 5. Men
 are sooner led by precedents, than precepts. Esay 56.
 Ezech. 34.1. 
                  O yee Priests, heare this, and hearken yee,
  ô house of Israell, and giue yee eare,
  
                        •
                      house of the King; for judgement
  is toward yee, because yee haue beene a snare on Mizpah, and a net spred vpon
  Taborpunc; And in the ninth Chapter he repeateth the same Lesson againe.
  Esay in his fiftie sixth Chapter, calls them, Blind Sentinells, and
  dumbe Dogs. Ezechiel bewailes them, Vae Pastoribus Israel, &amp;c.
  Woe bee vnto the Sheepeheards of Israell, that feed themselues; Should not the
  Sheepheards feed the flocks? Yee eat the fat, and yee cloath yee with the wool;
  yee kill them that are fed, but yee feed not the Sheep: The weake ye haue not
  strengthened, the sicke haue ye not healed, neither haue yee bound vp the
  broken, &amp;c. The whole Chapter runs along in this straine, wherevnto I
  referre thee. Cannot they be content to drinke of the cleere water of the
  Fountain, but that they must make it vnwholsome for their flock, foyling it
  with their durtie feet: For, What is bad life, and good doctrine, but a foule
  foot in cleere water? Saint Gregorie declareth this place concerning
  such Prelats; Who hauing drunke themselues of the pure and cleere Fountaine of
  Truth, trouble the same by their euill workes and bad example, giuing occasion
  thereby to these their sillie Sheepe, not to follow their doctrine, but to
  imitate their  life. Touching this Theame, there is a
  whole Chapter in the second part of our Booke De Amore.
               
               
                  Doe not as they doe. This, for his Disciples was a most
  necessarie lesson, but for the Pharisees, a most seuere reprehension. And a
  late Doctor hath obserued, That they beeing the most part Leuits and Priests,
  hee silenced the Priesthood, in token of the respect and reuerence that is due
  thereunto. Whereby such are condemned, who too lightly giue credit to the
  faults of the Clergie, and entertaine themselues therewith; beeing that God
  himselfe giues them this caueat, Nolite tangere Christos meos, Touch not
  mine Annoynted. Wherein he doth not lay an Interdiction on their violent
  hands onely, or on their blasphemous tongues, either before their face, or
  behind their backes; but likewise on their jealousies and suspitions, and on
  their rash censures, and on the pleasure which some take in the slips and falls
  of Priests: which is a great signe of Reprobation. According to that of
  Ecclesiasticus, They shall perish by the snare, that reioyce in the fall of
  the Righteous.
               
               
                  Doe not as they doe. The Couetous are here chiefely
  taxed; they will giue you councell, but Mercede Balaam effusi sunt,
  King Balacks Embassadours bringing money in their hands, shall buy
  their prophecies of them. Our Sauiour complained of them, That they deuoured
  widdowes houses. And Saint Paul alluding hereunto, saith, God is
  my witnesse, how I desire you all in the bowels of Christ. He saith not,
  In my bowells, but, In the bowells of Iesus Christ. Quis ibit nobis? Who
  shall goe for vs? It was Gods question, but he could find few that would
  follow him: but if to gainethe world, and to get wealth, hee shall but aske
  the question, Quis ibit? he shall haue infinite numbers to troupe
  after him. But asking, Quis ibit nobis? Who shall goe for vs? he shall
  scarce haue one to goe along with him. Euerie yeare a great number of Preachers
  offer themselues to this enterprise, but they doe not vnderstand whither, or
  to what end they goe: As Saint Augustine signifieth vnto vs in his
  Confessions. Esay complained, That his lips were foule. He might
  better (to my seeming) haue complained of his eyes, than his lips, because he
  had seene God with them: For to murmure, eyes are more necessarie than lips;
  but to preach, lips are more necessarie than eyes. If he that studies would but
  consider with himselfe, why God hath giuen him wit, abilitie, and learning; he
  would then peraduenture acknowledge, how vnworthie he is of so high a Calling,
  as to sit in Moses Chaire, or to goe vp into the Pulpit.
  Cicero saith, That the Orators motiue is, Amoris ardor, A desire
  to be beloued and esteemed. So it goes now, but not so well; for the loue
  which a Preacher is to pretend, and the credit which hee is to hunt after, is
  the loue of God, and the seeking after his glorie. Dicam semper
  magnificetur Dominus, I will alwayes say, The Lord be magnified; That
  shall be my continuall Motto, all the rest is little loialty, and manifest
  treason.
            
            
               Affigant onera grauia, &amp; importabilia.
               
                  They fasten heauie burthens, and impossible to be
  borne. Those Traditions and Glosses which the Scribes and Pharisees
  introduced, Origen and Theophilact are of opinion, that they
  did multiplie them in fauour of their couetousnesse; strengthening the same
  with an opinion of their simulated sanctitie. Saint Chrysostome
  saith, That the Ceremonies and Precepts of the old Law were too heauie a load
  to beare. Agreeing with that of the Acts, Nec patres nostri, nec nos ferre
  potuimus. The Pharisees did notifie them with great indeerings, but did
  not touch them with the finger; being like vnto the Viole, which makes that
  sound  which it selfe is not sencible of. They did beare
  the Precepts of the Law about them in certaine scroles of parchment, fastning
  them to their heads and their armes.
                     Deut. 6.
  Materially vnderstanding that place of Deutronomie, Thou shalt bind them
  for a signe vpon thy hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine
  eyes, [so much signifies the word Philacterie, which is all one
  with Conseruatoria.] In the borders of their garments they had their
  fringes, and vpon the fringes of the borders they did put a ribond of blew
  silke, as may be collected out of the fifteenth Chap. of Numbers,
                  
                     Num. 15.38. as also out of Deut. That
  they might the better remember all the commandements of the Lord, and doe them,
  and be holy vnto their God, not seeking after their owne hearts, nor after
  their owne eyes, after the which they went a whoring. And Saint
  Hierome addeth further, That they did put sharpe thornes to these
  their fringes, that they might pricke them and draw bloud from them, that
  thereby they might expresse their greater penitencie, being in secret
  exceeding vicious and wanton.
               In a word; Princes and Prelats, ought not to lay such burthens
  on their subiects shoulders, as should breake their backes (like those
  Taske-Masters and Ouerseers of the children of Israell in the labour and tale
  of their brickes.) For it is a vice, and grieuous sinne in your Princes, and
  their publike Ministers, not to be compassionate of the poore, nor to pitty
  their paines, thinking all too little they doe, pressing and oppressing them
  dayly more and more, with intollerable Taxes, and insupportable payments. The
  Booke of Iudith, recounting the death of Manasses, husband to
  Iudith, saith, That he died in the Barley haruest; for as hee was
  diligent ouer them that bound sheaues in the field,
                  
                     Iudith. 8.2. 
                  the heat came vpon his head, and
  he fell vpon his bed, and died in the Citie of Bethulia. It is a thing
  worthy the noting, that there is a memorial of such an indisposition as this,
  as if it had bin some great and extraordinarie matter: But I conceiue, that he
  made this so particular mention of it, that he might giue vs therby to
  vnderstand, Que la codiçia rompe el sa
                        •
                     o, That too much cramming of the bag makes it to
  breake; and that if Manasses had taken pittie of his Reapers in a time
  of such extremitie of heat, he had not died. For the carelesnesse of your great
  Princes, in not duly considering, and not measuring according vnto prudence,
  the strength and abilitie of their subiects, is no small occasion of those
  many mischiefes which haue followed therevpon.
                     Gen.
 33.13. 
                  Iacob said to his brother Esau, I will driue softly,
  according to the pace of the Cattell which is before me, and as the children
  bee able to endure; for they are not able to goe such great journies as my
  Lord; who seeth that the childeren are tender, and the
  
                        〈◊〉
                      and kine with young vnder myne
  hand, and if they should ouerdriue them one day, all the Flocke would die.
  Hercules shewed a noble spirit, when seeing Atlas groane vnder
  the heauie weight of Heauen, in pittie of him, put to his owne shoulder to ease
  him of his load. Neuer doe those Princes long enioy their Crowne, who impose
  heauie Taxes on their Subiects; not onely because they make their Vassals to
  pay more than they are able to pay, but for that their Ministers extortions
  and vexations, wring the bloud out of their verie hearts, and the teares out of
  their eyes, which ascending Heauen, turne to lightnings and thunderbolts
  Super deducentem eas, vpon him that causeth them.
               
            
            
               Qui se exaltat, humiliabitur, &amp; qui se humiliat,
  exaltabitur.
               
                  He that exalteth himselfe, shall be humbled, and he that
  humbleth himselfe shall be exalted. Our Sauiour here treateth, how much
  humilitie importeth a Christian▪ and that this is the onely doore whereby
  wee are to enter into Heauen. Saint Augustine tells thee, That thou
  must tread the same tread that our Sauior troad,  and
  that there is no way to walke to Paradise, but that wherein he himselfe
  walked: And the first step that leads to this path, is Humilitie; the second
  stride is likewise Humilitie; and the third and last must also be Humilitie.
  And if thou shalt aske me a thousand times ouer and ouer, Which is the way that
  leadeth to Blisse? my answer must bee, Humilitie. Heare what Pope Leo
  saith, Tota disciplina Christiana, &amp;c. The whole course of Christian
  discipline consisteth in true humilitie, which our Sauiour Iesus Christ made
  choyce of in his mothers wombe, and afterwards taught the same to others: From
  the verie bowells of his mother, of all other vertues he made choice of
  this. And in the discourse of his life, he declared this to be his onely
  daughter and heire. One reason, amongst many other, which hee might haue
  alledged, is, That in this life, where all is storme and tempest, torment,
  warre, and temptation, in a word, where nothing is secure and certaine,
  Humilitie (amongst these so many perills and dangers, which are like so many
  rockes and shelfes) will bring thee safe through the sea of this world, to the
  Hauen of happinesse. In a cruell storme at sea, the lowest place in the ship
  is the safest. Elias, in that furious whirlewind, in that terrible
  earthquake, and that fearefull fire, wrapt himselfe vp like a bottome of yarne,
  and lay close to the earth. Dauid in that his persecution by
  Saul, saith, I was humbled, and he deliuered me. Iob in that
  generall destruction of all his goods, when those bad tidings were brought vnto
  him, hee arose and rent his garments,
                     Iob. 1.
  and shaued his head, and fell downe vpon the ground and worshipped; and said,
  Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked shall I return thither; the
  Lord hath giuen, &amp; the Lord hath taken it away, blessed be the name of the
  Lord. The tempest afterwards encreasing vpon him, as byles, botches,
  leaprosie, wormes, and a wife; he got him to a dunghil, with a piece of a
  potsheard in his hand, making choice of the humblest, but safest place. Giue
  vs grace, ô Lord, to imitate this his humilitie, that thou mayst blesse
  vs in this world, and in the world to come, &amp;c.
            
         
         
            
            THE FOVRTEENTH SERMON, VPON THE WEDNESDAY AFTER THE SECOND
SONDAY IN LENT.
            
               
                  MAT. 20.18. 
                  
                     Ecce, ascendimus Hierusalem.
                   
                  Behold, we goe vp to Ierusalem.
               
            
            
               With what discourses we ought to beguile the
  wearines of our pilgrimage.
               OVr Sauiour Christ walking to Ierusalem,
where hee was to giue vs life, and to lose his owne, hee went discoursing of
his death, of the persons that should occasion it, and of those circumstances
which were to accompanie it. For a traueller doth busie his thoughts in
nothing more, than in that which he is to doe when hee comes to his journeys
end. Pharaoh persecuting the children of Israell, did eagerly pursue
them, and casting with himselfe, what course he should take with them when he
once ouertooke them; I will take away (saith hee) the riches that they haue
rob'd vs of, and diuide the spoyle, so shall my soule bee reuenged of them, and
my anger rest satisfied. Those holy women which went to the Sepulchre to
annoint our Sauiour Christ, said amongst themselues as they walked along,
Who shall rolle vs away the stone from the doore of the Sepulchre.
            
            This is not only a businesse well beseeming vs vpon the way, but
discouereth likewise the pleasure and content that the Traueller takes therein.
Commonly, trauelling is tedious and wearisome vnto vs, which that it may the
better bee passed ouer, he that vndertaketh a journey, imployeth his thoughts
vpon such things as may delight him most, and by that means beguiles the

                saith, That our Sauiours so
much talking of his death, was thereby to engage himselfe therein the more: for
by making all those that were there present with him, witnesses of his words,
That he should now die; it stood vpon his honour, his credit, and his truth;
there was now no stepping backe, but with extream

                losse of his reputation. But he being throughly
resolued to die, makes here vnto vs a more especiall and particular
description of his death, Behold, we goe vp
                     ••
                   Ierusalem; this shall bee the last time that euer I shall goe
vp to Ierusalem: no

                shall deliuer him to the Gentiles, to
mocke, and to scourge him, to beat and buffet him about the cheekes, to reuile
him to his teeth, and to spit in his face, beeing relinquished and forsaken of
all men; For it is written, I will smite their Sheapeheard, and the sheepe
shall be scattered. The persons that shall take my life from mee, shall be
the Princes of the Priests, and the Romane power: the circumstances; scoffes,
scornes, scourges, &amp;c. But after this so foule a storme, I shall recouer a
very cheerefull Hauen, and rest in safety.
                  Marke.
  14.27. 
               The third day will I rise againe.
            
            
               Behold we go vp to Hierusalem. Saint Marke
saith, Iesus went before,
               
                  Marke
  10.32. 
               and they were amased, and as they followed they feared.
Where we are to consider, That hee, that goes to receiue Death, showes great
content, great courage, and great valour. But those, that go to receiue Life,
great cowardize, great sorrow, and great feare. Whence it came to passe, that
our Sauiour Christ went apace before, and that his Disciples followed slowly
after.
            
               He went before them. The pleasures hee tooke therein,
clapt wings to his feet. Some may aske; How can this his ioy,
                  Ob.
                sute with the sorrow which he suffered in the
garden? But this ioy, was verie fitting and conuenient for him; to the
end,
                  Sol.
                that they who hereafter should see
him sad, might thinke, that the winde of this his sorrow, blew it selfe out of
another corner; the contentment of his death continuing still on foot.
Epiphanius sayth, That this our Sauiours sorrow, grew from the desire
that he had to dye. For, if hee should alwayes haue exprest this his
willingnesse that he had to dye; the Deuil, fearefull of his owne hurt, would
haue sought to haue diuerted it. And as Pilats wife was drawne to
solicite his life, so would he likewise haue solicited all Hierusalem to saue
him, had hee so well knowne then as he did afterwards, that Christs death would
haue bin so aduantagious to mankind. He was willing likewise to prouoke
thereby, his and our aduersary, &amp; to put him more eagerly vpon the
businesse: persuading himselfe, that this his sorrow proceeded out of feare.
Most men (sayth Epiphanius) feare to dye; only our Sauiors feare was,
not to dye. Christ, by his feare of life, sought to secure his death. Howbeit,
we must withall acknowledge, that he did truely both greeue, and feare.
            
               And as they followed they feared.
               Naturall in all to seeke life, &amp; shun death. That our
nature should suffer cowardize and feare, seeing death neere at hand, as wee
haue seene the experiment of it in the greatest Saints that are in Heauen, as
in Elias, Iob, and Saint Paul; so not to feare death, is the
priuiledge and fauour of Grace. To feare it, is the condition of nature, which
doth naturally desire the conseruation of it's beeing, and the preseruation of
it's life. Nor is it much, that Nature should discouer in man this weakenesse
and cowardize; when as being vnited to the God-head in our Sauiour Christ, he
did begge and intreat, according to this his inferiour part, to wit
his humanity, If it be possible let this cup passe from me. Whereupon
Leo the Pope sayth, Ipsa vox non exa
                     •
                  diti, magna est expositio sacramenti. The mystery,
that Christ should begge, and not be heard, is, That our Nature would not
willingly purchase any good thing, at so deere a rate, as the price of it's
life and being. Nolumus spoliari, sed superuestiri, We would not be
stripped, but ouer-clothed. And albeit the Disciples had so many lectures
of death read vnto them, yet could they not remooue the feare of death from
them. And if humane nature wrought vpon our Sauiour Christ, according to that
inferiour portion of his, though so well incountered with his content and
readinesse to dye; it is not much, that his Disciples should lagger behind, and

cowardly as they did.
            
               
               Filius hominis tradetur principibus sacerdotum,
  &amp;c.
               
                  The sonne of Man shall be deliuered to the chiefe Priests,
  &amp;c. The reasons, why our Sauiour made such a particular peice, and
  exact draught, of his death, of his torments, and his crucifixion, are very
  many, whereof some haue been formerly related, and those that now offer
  themselues, are as followeth.
               
                  It ought not to bee considered, but
 with al seriousnesse.The first, Our Sauiour proceeded therein very
  leasurely, &amp; with a great deale of deliberation; for this so sad a storie,
  that it may be of profit vnto vs, is not to be posted ouer in hast, nor to bee
  looked on all at once, but by peecemeale, and a leasurely gazing thereupon. For
  there is not a wheale nor a stripe in that diuine Body, but may very well take
  vp our thoughts in the contemplation of them, for many houres together;
  especially in such an age as this, wherein nothing is blotted more out of our
  remembrance, than Christ crucified. The Diuell sought to worke this
  wickednesse in the hearts of the Iewes, Eradamus e
                        •
                     m de terra viuentium, Let vs rase him out of the Land of
  the liuing; Let there be no memoriall of him in the World, let him be
  blotted out of our hearts by our vices. And he hath got so much ground vpon vs,
  that euen wee that are Preachers of his word, dare scarce treat vpon the
  occasions of this his passion; For one foole or other will not sticke in one
  corner or other to murmure out this his malitious censure, That we show more
  passion in our preaching, than in preaching his passion. But the truth is,
  that when in a battaile the Standard goes to the ground, the Souldiers likewise
  fall with it; And that there is no matter, no subiect, so soueraigne, nor so
  diuine, where good wits haue flourished and displayed the Ancient of their
  powerfull Eloquence, than in the passion of our Sauiour. Saint Paul
  neuer tooke any other Theame, than Praed
                        •
                     camus Chrstum crucifixum, Wee preach Christ crucified. But we
  must chew it, and digest▪ it wel, it is not to be swallowed downe whole,
  for then it will doe vs no good. Lactantius Firmianus treating of the
  Lambe which God commanded to be eaten, in Exodus, which was a figure
  of that Lambe which was crucified on the Crosse, sayth, That albeit hee
  commanded, that they should eate it in hast, in regard of the hast which the
  Iewes and the Gentiles should make in his iudgement, and in his death; yet
  notwithstanding, he willed them to haue a care, that they should not breake so
  much as a bone of his bodie; And beeing it was to bee diuided amongst many,
  they must of force be driuen to cut it in peeces, and to eat it very leisurely,
  beholding and charily considering the ioynts and ligaments of the least bones.
  Wee must therefore leisurely and considerately meditate on that History, which
  beeing well and truely weighed, is the generall remedie to all our sores and
  diseases. It is that true Fishpoole which healeth all our infirmities: It
  maketh the Couetous man, liberall, in seeing the God of loue stript naked for
  our sakes, of all that hee hath. The Glutton, Christs gall and vinigar, makes
  temperate, and teaches him to fast. The Chollerick man, our Sauiours patience,
  makes milde and gentle. The Reuengefull man, his sufferings, makes him to pray
  for his enemies. The Pro
                     ••
                   man, his
  humility, makes him to be as lowly as the worme that lyes vnder our feet.
  Humiliauit semetipsum vsque ad mortem crucis, Hee humbled himselfe to
  
                        〈◊〉
                      death of the Crosse. If

  greatest that God euer created, slabbered and bespalled with the loathsome
  spittle and filthy driuell of the Iewes. If the authority of a Iudge, 
   behold the vniuersall Iudge, who in a few houres is
  posted ouer to so many Tribunalls, and without any lawfull trial, and nothing
  iustly to be laid against him, dies notwithstanding by the sentence of
  Pilate. If the praise and applause of men, behold his scornes and his
  reproches, Opprobrium hominum, &amp; abiectio plebis. If disasters,
  infirmities, or any other paine or torment whatsoeuer doe grieue and afflict
  thee; What torment can bee grieuous in comparison of that torment of his?
  Cantabiles mihi erant iustificationes tuae in loco peregrinationis
  meae. Saint Ambrose vnderstands by Iustificationes,
  those torments of our Sauiour Christ, and saith, That when Dauid was
  banished and persecuted, hee sung of them as hee went vp and downe in this his
  exile, to comfort himselfe, and to beare his banishment and persecution the
  better, calling that to mind which he was to suffer for him. Fasciculus
  Myrrhae dilectus meus, inter vbera mea commorabitur, My Beloued is a bundle of
  Myrrhe, hee shall lodge betwixt my brests. That thy bitter Cup (ô
  Lord) which thou didst drinke of, hath driuen out all bitternesse and
  sourenesse from forth my brest: I made mee a bundle of Myrrh of thy torments,
  which serue as a sweet and fragrant Nosegay to refresh and comfort my heart.
  The Passion of Christ (as it is in the Apocalyps) is the booke of
  Life. All the bookes of all the Libraries in the world; all the Schooles and
  Vniuersities put together, neuer taught that which this booke teacheth. Saint
  Augustine saith, Lignum morientis, Cathedra fuit Magistri
  docentis. There was neuer any Schoole in the world like to that of the
  Crosse, nor any Master like vnto Christ, that hung thereupon. Saint
  Paul cries out, O foolish Galathians, who hath bewitched you, that
  yee should not obey the truth, to whom Iesus Christ before was described, in
  your sight,
                  
                     Galat. 3. 
                  and among you
  crucified? He had set before the Galathians Christ vpon the Crosse,
  presenting himselfe vnto them so naturally, and so to the life, as if they had
  seene the verie originall it selfe, as it stood all begoared with bloud in
  Mount Caluarie: And that vnlesse they were mad men, bewitched, or starke
  fooles, they could not but be taken and captiuated therewith, nor for their
  liues refuse to loue him and beleeue in him. If Saint Paul made him
  so rich and so glorious by his eloquence, What a pretious peece must it needs
  be, when Christ himselfe, by suffering in those his delicate limbes, did limne
  it forth vnto vs at his death; his thornes, his nailes, his wan visage, his
  bored hands and feet, and his wounded side, vttering more Rhethoricke in that
  last Act and Scaene of his life, than all the eloquence of Paul, or
  the pennes of the whole World since, were euer able to expresse.
               The second, Saint Chrysostome saith, That our Sauiour
  sought to oblige them vnto him, by giuing them such a particular account, that
  he was to suffer and to die out of his especiall loue towards them, as also all
  Mankind; and that this therefore ought not to giue them occasion to withdraw
  their respect from him, or that he should thereby lose any one jot of his
  reputation among them. Mori, hominis est▪ sed velle mori, Dei, i.
  To die, is of man; but to be willing to die, of God: And because
  herein I pretend your good, I ought to lose nothing with you, by losing my
  life. One of the greatest indeerements of his loue was, That hee did esteem it
  as a reward of all his indured troubles and torments, that he should not lose
  his worth with vs. This made him to say, Happie is that man who shall not
  thinke lesse worthie of me than I deserue. Tertullian controlled an
  Hereticke that denied the diuinitie of our Sauiour Christ; the cobwebs of the
  cratch, the pouertie of his life, and the accursednes of his death, being no
  way able to take hold vpon him. Those verie things (saith he) that blind thee,
  ought to conuince thee, and to affectionate thee vnto him; for none but God
  could doe thus much  for thee. And it is a lamentable
  case, that those good things that hee did for thee, that thou mightest beleeue
  in him and loue him, should be motiues vnto thee for to offend him. God hauing
  commanded that Ierusalem should bee re-edified after their first freedome from
  Babylon, there were some graue men grounded in Iudaisme, who misinterpreting
  (as Saint Hierome hath noted it) the prophecie of
  Ezechiel;
                     Ezech. 11.3. said,
  Haec est lebes, nos autem carnes, This Citie is the caldron, and we be the
  Flesh: For God to command vs to rebuild this Citie, is as if he should
  will vs to make a Caldron wherein to boyle our selues. Of his loue they made a
  loathing, and interpreted his fauour to be an iniurie. God took this their
  vnthankefulnesse so ill, that he quitted them the second time both of their
  countrie and their libertie. It is you that haue made Ierusalem a Caldron of
  the prophets; I will bring you out of the middest thereof, and deliuer you
  into the hands of strangers, yee shall fall by the sword; and this Citie (as
  yee falsly suppose) shall not be your Caldron, neither shall yee be the flesh
  in the midst thereof. The same reason is repeated by the Prophet Ose, I
  gaue yee wine, wheat, oyle, gold, and siluer; but yee spent it in the seruice
  of the Idoll Baal, therefore will I take from yee my wine, my wheat,
  &amp;c.
               
            
            
               
                  Filius hominis tradetur, The Sonne of man shall be
  deliuered.
               The death of our Sauiour Christ may be considered two manner of
  wayes:
               Either as a Historie.
               Or, as it is Gospell.
               As a Historie, it is so sad and so lamentable, as that it cannot
  but cause great pittie and compassion. The relation which Pilate made
  to the Emperor of Rome, is sufficient of it selfe to melt stones into teares;
  which was as followeth:
                
                  In this Kingdome there was a wonderfull strange man, his
 behauiour &amp; beautie beyond all other in the world; his discretion and
 wisedome coelestiall; his grauitie and sobernesse of carriage, beyond all
 comparison; his words mystical, the grace wherewith he deliuered them strooke
 his enemies with astonishment; neuer any man saw him laugh; weepe, they haue;
 his workes sauoured of more than man; he neuer did any man harme, but much good
 hath he done to many▪ he healed by hundreds such as had been sicke of
 incurable diseases; he did cast out Deuills; he raised the Dead; and his
 miracles beeing numberlesse, they were done all for others good; he did not
 worke any miracle wherein was to be seene the least vanitie or boasting in the
 world. The Iewes out of enuie layd hold on him, and with a kind of hypocrisie
 and outward humilitie, rather seeming, than being Saints, trampled him vnder
 foot, and marred his cause. I whipt him for to appease their furie, and the
 people being about to mutine, I condemned him to the death of the Crosse. A
 little before he breathed his last, hee desired of God, that he would forgiue
 those his enemies which had nailed him to the Crosse. At his death there were
 many prodigious signes both in heauen and earth; the Sunne was darkened, and
 the graues were opened, and the Dead arose▪ After he was dead, a foolish
 Iew thrust a Speare into his side, shewing the hatred in his death which the
 Iewes bare vnto him in his life. What Tragedie can bee more mournefull, or
  what imaginarie disaster can appeare more lamentable?
               As it is Gospel, you shall see in this his death innumerabie
  truths: First of all, let not the asperousnesse and hardnesse to the way of
  happinesse discourage any man; for hauing such a good guide as our Sauior Iesus
  Christ, it shall (though 
                     〈◊〉
                   be
  neuer so hard to hit) be made plaine and easie vnto vs: Howbeit it bee
  elsewhere  said, The way to heauen is streight and
  inaccessable,
                  
                     Heb. 12. 
                  because there
  are few that tread in that tracke. Yet now the case is altered, and Saint
  Paul cals thus vnto vs, Accedamus ad eum, qui imitiauit nobis
  viam; It will cost vs some sweat and some labour, yet not so much as may
  dishearten vs, and it shall be a wholesome sweat, and a safe and sure labour.
  Iacob saw God holding the Ladder which reached to Heauen, whereunto
  hee set his helping hand, the better to secure it, to the end that euerie man
  (as Philon hath noted it) might without feare climbe vp to the top of
  it. S. Hierome goes a little further, and says, That hee did not
  thereby onely promise safetie, but helpe; for God did stretch out his hand from
  aboue, and did reach it forth vnto those that were willing to get vp: According
  to that of Dauid, Emitte manum tuam de alto, (i.) Send out thy
  hand from aboue.
                  2. Mac. 11.
                  Lysias when he had gathered about fourescore thousand Foot, with all
  the Horsemen he had, he came against the Iewes, thinking to make Ierusalem an
  habitation of the Gentiles: and because of his great number of Footmen, his
  thousands of Horsemen, and his fourescore Elephants, the Captains and Souldiers
  of Gods people were quite out of heart, making prayers with weeping and teares
  before the Lord, That hee would send a good Angell to deliuer Israell. And as
  they were besides Ierusalem, there appeared before them vpon horsebacke, a man
  in white cloathing, shaking his harnesse of gold. Then they praised the
  mercifull God all together, and tooke heart, insomuch that they were readie not
  onely to fight with men, but with the most cruell beasts, and to breake downe
  walls of yron. Marching then forward in battell array, hauing an helper from
  heauen▪ running vpon their enemies like Lyons, they slew eleuen thousand
  footmen, and sixteene hundred Horsemen, and put all the other to flight.
  Another Horseman was he that Saint Iohn saw vpon a white Horse,
  bearing this for his Motto, Vincens vt vinceret. Which takes from vs
  all feares of atchieuing the victorie for Heauen.
               Secondly, it assureth vs, That he that offereth vs so much, can
  denie vs nothing; he could not well giue vs more, nor would hee giue vs lesse
  than that which he hath alreadie so liberally bestowed vpon vs. Yet this gift
  may receiue increase (as Saint Bernard hath noted it) according to the
  manner of it. For in all things whatsoeuer, are to be considered, the thing
  What, and the thing How, or Why; the Accident, and the Substance; and sometimes
  Gods Attributes doe shine more in the Accident, than in the Substance. Whence I
  inferre, That he that gaue so much with so much loue, and sees that it is all
  cast away, and that his loue is so ill requited, it is not much if he be much
  offended with vs. Ergo in vacuum laborani, &amp;c. In vaine then haue I
  laboured, and to no purpose haue I spent my strength. Whom will it not
  grieue to the heart, when he hath taken a great deale of paines, and been at a
  great deale of charge, to see them both lost? Who euer tooke halfe that paines
  for vs, as did our Sauiour Christ? who was euer at that great cost with vs as
  hee hath beene? Multo sudore sudatum est, &amp; non exiuit de eo
  rubigo.
               
               
                  The sonne of man shall be deliuered. It is a vsuall
  phrase in Scripture, to call Man,Our Sauiour why called the
 sonne of man. the sonne of Man. Adam, was neither the sonne of
  Man nor Woman, yet is he listed in the number of the children of Men.
  Tertullian sayth, That our Sauiour tooke his appellatiue vpon him, to
  show, that hee was now true Man. Saint Austen, That by this name, he
  was willing to distinguish the humane nature, from the diuine; and to reuiue
  the remembrance of that surpassing benefit of his becomming Man.
  Epiphanius and Theodoret, That Daniel, when he
  stiled him the sonne of Man, by this his so calling of him, prooued
  thereby,
                     Dan. 7. that he was the person 
   prophecied of in that prophecie. Gregory
  Nazianzen, That hee was called the sonne of Man, for that hee was
  descended of Adam. And if hee, may bee most of all called sonne, who
  doth most of all honour his Father; none, was more Adams sonne than
  hee. Last of all, our Sauiour treating heere of his torments, and of his
  Crosse, which were to come vpon him, as Man, it well suteth with this his
  present condition to take this name vpon him of the sonne of Man.
               
                  The sonne of Man shall be deliuered. When Christ our
  Sauiour treateth of his torments,
                     Psal.
 22.16. he vseth the third Person; Tradetur, &amp; tradent, He shall
  be deliuered, and they shall deliuer him▪ &amp;c. But when the
  Prophets did prophecie of him, they spake in the first Person:
                     Psal. 73.74. Zac. 13.6. 
                  Foderunt
  manus meas, &amp; pedes meos, They haue digged my hands, and my feet. Fui
  flagellatus tota die, I was scourged all the day long. Faciem meam non auerti
  ab increpantibus &amp; conspuentibus in me, I turned not away my face from
  those that rebuked me, and spat vpon mee. His plagatus sum in dom
                        •
                      eorum, qui diligebant me, With these
  was I wounded in the house of my friends. So that if you shall but aske
  Christ, who it is that suffereth these things? hee will answer, That it is the
  sonne of Man. And if yee aske the Prophets, they will say, That it is the sonne
  of God. And peraduenture this is the mysterie of it, That albeit our Sauiour
  Christ is the party that suffered (as the Prophets prophecie of him;) yet he
  suffered as a Fiador, or Surety. But so great was the loue which hee
  bare to Man, who was the Debtor, that putting these torments, which wee were
  lyable vnto, to his owne account, yet the discharge of this debt goes in the
  name of the Debtor. And as the treasure of his merits, is for the good of Man;
  so his torments, and his sufferings, are to bee attributed wholly to Man, who
  was the person, that by the ordinary course of Law did owe this debt, and was
  in all reason bound to pay it.
               
                  The sonne of Man shall bee deliuered. It is here to bee
  considered how often our Sauiour makes repetition of this word
  Tradetur. Peraduenture, because it was one of his greatest griefes,
  that his friend should betray him; The man of Peace in whome I hoped,
  sayth Dauid. Thomas sayth, That it is one of the noblest actions in
  the world for a man to loue his friend; because to abhorre him, is one of the
  foulest things that man can commit. Magnificauit super me
  supplantationem,
                  
                     Psal. 49.1. 
                  He
  gloried in his supplanting me. What greater griefe can befall a friend,
  than to bee supplanted by a friend? The metaphor is taken from those that run,
  when as the one trips vp the others heeles. Saint Ierome reads it,
  Leuauit contra me caltaneum, Hee lifted vp the heele against me. Our
  Sauiour Christ flying to death with the wings of Loue, Iudas setting
  his legge of Treason before him to throw him downe, his Loue found it selfe
  thereby offended, and beeing thus wronged by a friend, his Loue had no need of
  such spurres to driue him on to his death. But say it should, it was not fit
  for a friend to put them on. He of all other, should not haue led him along
  therunto, falsifying his loue by a feigned kisse, &amp; kindly saluting him,
  with an Aue Rabbi, Haile Master. To whom our Sauiour mildely againe
  replyd, Amice, ad quid venisti? Friend, wherefore camest thou? What
  needst thou to haue taken so much paines, thou mightest haue saued thy selfe
  this labour, being it was myne own desire to make my selfe a prisoner? yet it
  doth much trouble me, that my friend should deale so vnkindly with me.
            
            
               Tradetur principibus sacerdotum.
               
                  Hee shall bee deliuered to the chiefe Priests. A little
  before, the Apostles were at difference amongst themselues who should bee the
  greatest in that their hoped  for Kingdome, there beeing
  two commings of the Messias foretold by the Prophets.
               
                  1 The one, prosperous, full ofMaiestie and
 Greatnesse.
                  2 The other, poore, humble, and despised.
               
               Now, because the Vnderstanding doth commonly follow the
  affection of the Will, they did verily beleeue, that this his comming should
  bee in state and Maiestie, crowning himselfe King in Israell, taking all
  dominion and rule from the Emperour of Rome, from Herod, Pilat, and
  other inferiour Ministers; and the Priesthood from the Pharisees, who held it
  so vnworthily. This conceit and hope of theirs is prooued and confirmed by that
  which the Disciples said on their way to Emaus;
                     Luke
 24. 
                  But we trusted that it had beene hee that should haue deliuered
  Israell: Not vnderstanding as then, what was the deliuerance that Iesus
  Christ had purchased for them, but looking after some worldly prosperitie. But
  much more plainely out of that place of the Acts, Lord, wilt thou at this
  time restore the Kingdome of Israell? In a word, They did fully persuade
  themselues,
                     Act. 1.6. that all the world
  should be subiect to his Crowne; comforting their hopes with that prophecie of
  King Dauids, His Dominion shall bee also from one Sea to the other, and
  from the Floud, vnto the worlds end.
                  
                     Psal.

  turne the wheele of this their vaine hope another way, hee sayth, To the chiefe
  Priests, whose seates you thinke to inioy, shall I be deliuered vp, and beeing
  presently put ouer to the Roman power, I shall by them be whipt, mockt,

                  But they vnderstood none of these things. This seemed
  vnto them to bee so foule a fact, and so heinous a wickednesse, that it could
  not sinke into their thoughts, that to such great Innocencie, such great
  Iniustice &amp; Crueltie should be offered. But malice was growne now to that
  height, that mans imagination must come short of it. Seneca sayth,
  That it is a verie poore excuse, to say, Who would haue thought it? For there
  is not that wickednesse, which is not now in the World. And seeing that the
  malice thereof, hath gone so farre, as to take away the life of the God of
  Heauen, there is not that ill, which wee ought not to feare. Wee are to feare
  the Sea, euen then, when it promiseth fairest weather. This speech of our
  Sauiours might likewise seeme vnto them to be some Parable; for that which the
  Will affecteth not, the Vnderstanding doth not halfe well apprehend it. He sayd
  vnto the Iewes, Oportet exa

  The sonne of man must be lifted vp. And they presently tooke hold of it.
  The Angels told Lot, that Sodome should be consumed with fire and
  brimstone from Heauen; and he aduising his sonnes in law thereof, He
  seemed vnto them as one that mocked. Precept must be vpon precept, line vpon
  line; here a little, and there a little.

  vndaduisedly craues of him, to giue him his fathers Shunamite to wife: This
  seemed to Salomon so foolish and so shamelesse a petition, that he
  caused his life to be taken from him.
            
            
               
                  Accessit mater, The mother came.
               Parents commonly desire to leaue their children more rich and
  wealthy, than holy and religious: A mother would wish her daughter, rather
  beautie than vertue; a good dowrie, than good endowments. Saint
  Augustine saith of himselfe, That he had a father that tooke more care
  to make him a Courtier of the earth, than of Heauen; &amp; desired more, that
  the world should celebrate him for a wise and discreet man, than to be
  accounted one of Christs followers. Saint Chrysostome saith, That of
  our children wee make little reckoning, but of the wealth that we are to leaue
  them, exceeding much: Being like vnto that sicke man, who not thinking of the
  danger wherein he is, cuts him out new cloathes, and entertaineth new
  seruants. A Gentleman will take more care of his Horse, and a great Lord of his
  estate, than of his children: For his Horse, the one will looke out a good
  rider, and such a one as shal see him well fed and drest; The other, a very
  good Steward for his lands: but for their children, which is their best riches,
  and greatest inheritance, they are carelesse in their choice of a good Tutor or
  Gouernor. In his Booke De Vita Monastica, the said Doctour citeth the
  example of Iob, who did not care so much that his children should be
  rich, well esteemed, and respected in the world, as that they should be holy
  and religious; He rose vp early in the morning,
                  
                     Iob 1.5. 
                  and offered burnt Offerings according
  to the number of the
                        •
                      all; For Iob
  thought, It may be my sons haue sinned and blasphemed God in their hearts: Thus
  did Iob euerie day. Saint Augustine reporteth of his mother, That
  she gaue great store of almes, and that she went twice a day to the Church, and
  that kneeling downe vpon her knees, shee poured forth many teares from her
  eyes; not begging gold nor siluer of God, but that he would be pleased to
  conuert her son, and bring him to the true Faith.
               
                  The receit of a curtesie is the ingag

                  The
  mother came. These her sonnes thought themselues now cocke-sure; for they
  knew that our Sauiour Christ had some obligation to their mother, for those
  kindnesses which she had done him, and for those good helpes which hee had
  receiued from her in his wants and necessities; deeming it as a thing of
  nothing, and as a sute already granted, That he would giue them the chiefest
  places of gouerment in that their hoped for Kingdom. Whence I infer, that to a
  gouernor it is a shrewd pledge ofhis saluation, to receiue a curtesie; for
  that he is thereby, as it were, bought and bound to make requitall. And as in
  him that buyes, 
                     〈◊〉
                   is not the

                   most stood vpon: &amp; as in

                  ▪ is a kind of buying to profit, and a greedie
  gaining by play. The King of Sodome said vnto Abraham,
                  
                     Gen. 14.23. 
                  Giue me the persons, and take the

                  Abraham would not take so much as a thred or shooe-latchet of all that
  was his, and that for two verie good reasons:
               The one, That an Infidell might not hereafter boast and make his
  brag, saying▪ I haue made Abraham rich, it was I that made him a
  man.
               The other, That he might not haue a tie vpon him, and so buy out
  his liberty▪ For guifts (as Nazianzen saith) are a kind of
  purchase of a mans freehold.

  And the poorer sort of men being commonly the worthiest, because they haue not

  Theodoret pondereth the reasons why Isaac was inclined to
  conferre the blessing on Esau.
               
               First, Because he was his first borne, to whom of right it
  belonged.
               Secondly, For that he had euer beene louing and obedient vnto
  him.
               Thirdly, Because he was well behaued, and had good naturall
  parts in him.
               Fourthly and lastly hee addeth this, as a more powerfull and
  forcible reason than all the rest; That being (as he was) a great Hunter, he
  brought home so many Regalos and daintie morcells for to please his
  fathers palate, which wrought more vpon aged Isaac, than his being his
  sonne. And if gifts are such strong Gyants, that they captiuate the Saints of
  God, Munera (crede mihi) excacant homines qùe Deosque. What
  are we to expect from sinners? Saint Bernard complaineth, That in his
  time this moth had entred not onely vpon the distribution of secular honours,
  but also vpon Ecclesiasticall preferments. He earnestly exhorteth Pope
  Eugenius, That he place such Bishops in the Church, who out of
  widdowes dowries, &amp; the patrimonie of the crucified God, should not inrich
  their Kindred, who take more pleasure in the pampering of a young Mule, spred
  ouer with a faire foot-cloath, than to clap caparisons on an old Horse, whose
  mouth is presumed to be shut; preferring their loose Kindred, and such as haue
  jadish trickes, before deuout and irreprehensible persons. A Prelat shall

  mother intreats with the loue and affection of a mother, so it seemeth to Saint
  Ambrose and Saint Hilarie; and as it is to be collected out
  of Saint Marke; and from that, You know not what you aske: As
  also by that, Can you drinke of my Cup? Whither they were thrones in
  Heauen, (as Saint Chrysostome would haue it) or on earth, which though
  neuer so prosperous, they could imagine at most to be but temporall; I will not
  stand to dispute it: if of heauen, few vnderstand it; if of earth; they would
  make this their pilgrimage a permanent habitation. And if they held
  Peter to be a foole, because he would haue had Tabernacles built on
  Mount Tabor▪ What shall wee say to these that would haue perpetuall seats
  of honour? All the Courts of the earth are but portches and gatehouses to those
  Pallaces ofheauen, where the lackey and the scullion, as well, &amp;c.

               They did first of all imagine, That from the death of Christ,
  his Crown and Empire was to take it's beginning. Now to desire seats of honour
  of one that was scourged, spit vpon, strip

  Crowne vp-his h
                     •
                  ad. So doth
  Thomas expound that place of Saint Paul, Who for the joy that 
   was set before him, endured the Crosse, and despised the
  shame. When a Kings Crown was proposed vnto him by the World, he made
  choice of the Crosse, holding that affront the lesse of the two. What then
  might he thinke, when treating of his death, they should craue chaires of
  honour, making lesse reckoning of his bloud, than of their owne aduancement?
  For three transgressions of Israell, (sayth Amos) and for
  foure,
                  
                     Amos. 2.6. 
                  I will not turne
  to it, because they sould the Righteous for siluer, and the Poore for
  shooes: That is, made more reckoning of the mucke of the world, than mens
  liues. Galatinus, Adrianus Finus, and Rabbi Samuel,
  transferre this fault vpon those Pharisees which sould our Sauiour, to secure
  their wealth and their honours; The Romans will come and take both our
  Kingdome and our Nation from vs. Wherein these his Disciples seemed to
  suit with them; for the Pharisees treated of our Sauiours death, that they
  might not loose their Chaires; and his Disciples, that they might get
  them.
               
                  Yee know not, &amp;c. Why would they not haue
  Peter share with them in their fauour and their honour? In Mount Tabor
  he was mindfull of Iames and Iohn; but Iames and
  Iohn did not once thinke vpon Peter. The reason whereof is,
  for that the glorie of heauen is easily parted and diuided with others: And
  because God will that all should bee saued, man is likewise willing to yeeld
  thereunto. But for the glorie of the earth, there is scarce that man that will
  admit a copartner. And if Christ our Sauiour had granted them their request,
  they would presently haue contested, which should haue sate on his right hand.
  For in these worldly aduancements and honours, brother will be against brother,
  and seeke to cut each others throat. Iacob and Esau stroue
  who should be borne first, &amp; get away the blessing from the other.

                  Ambition alwaies blind in that which it
 pursueth.Ambition (like the Elephant) out of a desire to command, will
  not sticke to beare Castles &amp; Towers on his backe, till it be readie to
  breake with the weight of it's burthen. Why should Peter couet honour,
  if like a Tower it must lie heauily vpon him? King Antiochus had
  three hundred Elephants in his Army, and euerie one bare a Tower of wood vpon
  his backe, and in them thirtie persons
  
                     •
                   piece. The ambitious man (like
  Atlas) will make no bones to beare vp heauen with his shoulders,
  though it make him to groane neuer so hard, and that in the end he must come
  tumbling downe with it to the ground. Many pretend that which makes much for
  their hurt, presuming that they deserue what they desire. In matter of
  presumption, there is not that man that will know or acknowledge any aduantage.
  Many men complaine of the badnesse of the Times, of the hardnesse of their
  fortune, of the small fauour that they find, as also of their want of health;
  but few or none, of their want of sufficiencie, or their lacke

               Saint Bernard sets downe three sorts of Ambition:
               The one, Modest and bashfull; which vseth it's diligences, but
  withall, such as are lawfull and honest: For it is a lawfull thing to pretend
  honour, though not to pretend it, be the greater vertue.
               The other, Arrogant and insolent, looking for kneeling and
  adoration.
               The third, Mad and furious, that will downe with all that stands
  in it's way; and hale Honour by the lockes, and with his poinyard in his hand
  seeke to force her.
               Saint Cyprian in an Epistle of his, preacheth the selfe
  same doctrine. Of these three sorts of Ambition, the first is the most
  tollerable, and the least scandalous: The third is cruell: The second, which in
  Court is the most common, is most base and vile; howbeit (according to Saint
  Bernard) it is Vicium magnatum, A vice that followes your
  greatest and grauest Councellours, and your principall Prelats, not your meaner
  and ordinarie persons. It is a secret Poyson which pier

  to him from Elia the Prophet] who in his fathers time was taken vp in a
  Chariot of fire; which were left written behind him by a propheticall Spirit,
  before that he departed hence, as Caietan doth enforce it. Howsoeuer,
  I am sure that they did notifie vnto him a most grieuous and seuere
  chastisement. Iason brother to the High-Priest Onias, tooke
  away his Priesthood from him by offering King Antiochus a great summe
  of money. In the ninth Chapter of the first Booke of Macabees, strange
  things are reported of the impostures of Alcimus, till that he died
  suddenly, and was smitten cum tormento magno. The twelfth Chapter
  recounteth the cruelties which Triphon multiplied one in the necke of
  another, to set the Crowne of Asia on his owne head, by killing
  Ionathan and his sons.

                  bility  than abilitie. It is proper to God
  (sayth Aristotle) to doe what hee will; to Man, to doe what he can:
  But now the World is turned topsituruie; God does what hee can; and Man, what
  he will. Saint Bernard in an Epist. of his, complaineth of the
  Ecclesiasticall prouisions which were made in his time; They leapt (satih hee)
  from the Ferula to the Crosyers staffe; being gladder to see themselues freed
  from the Rod, than of the Honours that were throwne vpon them. Seneca
  called that, The golden Age, wherein Dignities were conferred on those that
  deserued them; condemning the Age wherein hee liued, to bee the Yron Age. But I
  say, That this present Age which we now inioy, is the happiest that euer our
  Church had: For, in those former times, those that were the learnedest and the
  holiest men, fled into the Desarts, and hid themselues in Caues, that they
  might not bee persecuted with Honours: For they had no sooner notice of a holy
  man; (albeit he liued coopt vp in a corner) but that they forced him thence,
  clapping a Miter on his head, and other dignities: And there are verie strange
  Histories of this truth. But to all those that liue now in these times, I can
  giue them these glad tydings, That they may inioy their quiet, and sit
  peaceably at home in their priuat lodgings, resting safe and secure, that this
  trouble shall not come to their doores; for now a dayes, onely fauour, or
  other byrespects of the flesh, haue prouided a remedie for this euill.
            
            
               Non est meum dare vobis.
               
                  It lies not in me to giue you. Christ would rather
  seeme to lessen somewhat of his power, than to lessen any thing of his loue.
  And therefore he doth not say, I will not doe it; for that would haue beene too
  foule and churlish a word in the mouth of so mild a Prince▪ and he should
  thereby haue done wrong to his own will, who desires that all might haue such
  seats as they did sue to sit in. Saint Ambrose vnfoldeth our Sauiours
  meaning, Bonus Dominus maluit dissimulare de jure, quam de charitate
  deponere, He had rather they should question his right, than his loue. The
  selfe same Doctor saith, That he made choice rather of Iudas than any
  other, though to man it might seeme, that hee therein wronged his wisedome; for
  the World might from thence take occasion to say, That he did not know how to
  distinguish of men, being that he had made choyce of such an Apostle. But this
  was done out of his especiall prouidence, (saith Saint Ambrose) in
  fauour of his loue: For he being in our opinion, to runne the hazard of his
  wisedome or his loue, he had rather of the two suffer in his wisedome; for no
  man could otherwise presume of him, but that he loued Iudas. The
  History of Ionas proues this point, who refused to go to Niniuie; it
  seeming vnto him, that both God and himselfe should (as Nazianzen
  saith) be discredited in the world. But he willed him the second time, That he
  should go to Niniuie, and that he should preach vnto them, Yet fortie
  dayes, and Niniuie shall be ouerthrowne.

 3.4. At last hee was carried thither perforce, whither hee would or no:
  And the reason why God carried this businesse thus, was, That if afterwards hee
  should not destroy this Citie, he might happely hazard the opinion of his
  power, but not of his loue. The like is repeated by Saint
  Chrysostome.
               
               
                  Ionas did likewise refuse to goe to Niniuie, that he
  might not at last be found a Lyer; esteeming more the opinion of his truth,
  than of his loue. Hence ariseth in the Prelats and the Princes, this word
  Nolumus, Wee will not haue it so; which sauours of too much harshnesse
  and tyrannie. Sic volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas, Their will is
  a Law vnto them. But he that shall make more reckoning of the opinion of
  his willingnesse, and of his loue, than of his power, 
  and his wisedome, will say, Non possum, I cannot, it is not in my
  power to doe it: It grieues mee to the verie heart, and I blush for shame, that
  I am not able to performe your desire. Which is a great comfort for him that is
  a suitor, when hee shall vnderstand, that his Petition is not denied out of
  disaffection, but disabilitie. When Naboth was to bee sentenced to
  death, the Iudges did proclaime a Fast: And Abulensis saith, That it
  was a common custome amongst the Iudges in those dayes, whensoeuer they did
  pronounce the sentence of death against an Offendor; to the end, to giue the
  World to vnderstand, That that mans death did torment and grieue their Soule.
  For, to condemne a man to death with a merrie and cheerefull countenance, is
  more befitting Beasts, than Men. When our Sauiour Christ entred Hierusalem in
  Triumph, the ruine of that famous Citie representing it selfe vnto him, hee
  shed teares of sorrow. Doth it grieue thee, ô Lord, that it must be
  destroyed? Destroy it not then. I cannot doe so; for that will not stand with
  my Iustice. O Lord, doe not weepe then. I cannot choose. And why, good Lord?
  Because it will not stand with my Mercie. And that Iudge, who euer hee be, if
  hee haue any pittie in the world in him, cannot for his heart bloud, when hee
  sentenceth a Malefactor to some grieuous punishment, or terrible torment, but
  haue some meltingnesse in his eyes, and some sorrow in his heart. God so
  pierce our hearts with pittie and compassion towards our poore afflicted
  brethren, that hauing a fellow-feeling of their miseries, wee may finde fauour
  at his hands, who is the Father of Pittie, and onely Fountaine of all
  Mercie.

               AMongst those Parables which our Sauiour preacht,The scope of the Parable. some were full of pittie and
loue; others of feares and terrors: some for noble brests; others for base and
hard hearts: some had set vp for their marke, the encouraging of our hopes;
others, the increasing of our feares: some seruing for comfort to the Godly;
and some for example to the Wicked. That which wee are to treat of to day, hath
all these comforts for the Poore which liue in hunger and in want, pined and
consumed with miserie: And threatnings for the Rich, who say vnto their riches
and their pleasures, I am wholly yours.
            
            
               There was a certaine rich man, &amp;c. The first thing
that he was charged withall,Riches may be possessed, but not
  desired. is, That he was rich: Not because rich men are damned because
they are rich; but because he is damned who placeth his happinesse in them, and
makes them the onely aime of his desires. And hence it commeth to passe, that
desired riches vsually prooue more hurtfull than those that are possessed: for
these sometimes doe not occupie the heart; but those that are desired and
coueted by vs, doe wholly possesse it, and lead it which way they list. And
therefore Dauid aduiseth vs not to set our hearts vpon them. Hee that
longeth and desireth to bee rich, euen to imaginarie riches, resigneth vp his
heart. Saint Paul did not condemne rich men, but those that did
desire to bee rich. The Deuill sets a thousand ginnes and snares about those
that haue set their desires vpon riches. What greater snare than that pit-fall
which was prepared as a punishment for Tantalus, who standing vp to
the chinne in water, could yet neuer come to quench his thirst. Non est

Iob;

peaceable possession of that which he possesseth, and yet cannot enioy it. Hee

at will, what greater snare, than in this his great plentie to be extream
poore? Magnas inter opes in

                  yon: And the reason
of it is cleere. The poore man (saith Salomon) eateth to the
contentation of his mind, and remaineth satisfied therewith; but the bellie of
the Rich is still emptie, and can neuer be filled. What greater snare, than to
denie a morcell of bread to the hungrie, pitty being so proper and naturall to
the brest and bowells of man? But this he too vsually doth, that desires to be
rich; for he that goes alwayes in chase, in propriam satietatem, to glut
his owne bellie, will hardly relieue another mans hunger. What greater
snare, than for a rich man to walke ouerlading and bruising his bodie with the
weight of gold, of all other mettalls the most massie, and to no profit in the
world,
                  Esay. 30.6. vnlesse it be to bring him
the sooner to his graue. Esay saith, That hee saw a Lyon, a Lyonesse,
a Viper, and a firie flying Serpent comming against those that shall beare
their riches vpon the shoulders of the Colts, and their treasures vpon the
bunches of the Cammells, to a strange Countrie, where it shal do them no good.
By the Lyon and Lyonesse, the Viper, and the firie flying Serpent, the Prophet
vnderstandeth those Deuills whom Dauid stiles Aspes and Basiliskes,
Lyons, and Dragons, and by those Colts and Cammells, rich men laden with
treasures, whose Carriers are the Deuills, who driue them along till they bring
them to Hell, with their backes galled, and their bodies bruised, bearing this
Motto in their forehead, Lassati sumus via iniquitatis, Wee are wearied in
the way of Iniquitie. Origen hath obserued, That those rich men whom God
wished well to in the Old Testament, he bestowed liuing riches vpon them, as
flocks of Sheepe, heards of Cattell, Bread, Wine, and Oyle, which are the
principall floures and best fruits of the earth. And the Patriarkes did desire
these prosperities and blessings for their children. Iacob pouring
out his blessings vpon Ioseph, said,
                  Gen.
  49.25. 
               God blesse thee with blessings of the brest and of the
wombe; let thy Ewes eane, and bring forth Lambes by paires, &amp;c. But
gold and siluer, which are dead riches, were not Gods blessing.
            
               
                  Vestiebatur purpura &amp; bysso, He was clothed in
  Purple &amp; fine Linnen.
               Three principles do condemne the excesse of apparell.
               The one, For a man to place too much pleasure and happinesse
  therein; as if he had been borne for no other end, but to weare rich and gay
  cloathes.
               The other, To ordaine them to a bad end. Saint
  Augustine saith, That wee should not so much intend the vse of pompous
  and glorious apparell, as the end for which wee vse them, Non vsus, sed
  libido in culpa est. The loose Wanton adornes himselfe with Silkes, with
  Diamonds, and brooches of gold; the Priest he adornes himselfe with a rich
  Stole, with a Cope curiously embroydred; the one, to enamour poore sillie
  Soules; the other, to offer Sacrifice decently before his God: The one
  offendeth; the other pleaseth; because, Non vsus, sed libido in culpa
  est. He that hath trauelled abroad, and beene long from home in forrain
  Countries, claps good cloathes on his backe, thinking that those will adde more
  credit to his person, than is answerable to his fortunes; Non vsus, sed
  libido i
                        •
                      culpa est, It is not our
  lacke, but our lust which must be blamed. A married wife trickes vp
  herselfe, and dresses her selfe neat, the better to please her husband and her
  familie; for a wife is the beautie, the joy, and life of a house. The Whore
  shee pranks vp her selfe too, but onely to allure loose beholders.
  Salomon commending a manly mettled woman, sayes, That she cloathed
  her selfe with Purple and  with Silke. The
  Apocalyps condemning that Whore of Babylon who held a cup of poyson in
  her hand, saith, That it was couered with gold: In the one was Vertue; in the
  other, Vice; and therefore not our need, but our nicenesse is in fault. Many
  for to complie with the authoritie of their dignities and places of honour,
  haue outwardly worne rich and costly cloaths, but inward next to their skinnes,
  shirts of haire; as Theodosius, Nepotianus, and others. For, as that
  which enters in at the mouth doth not defile the soule; so, outward cloathes do
  not hurt the inward man; Sed libido in causa est.
               
               The third Principle is out of Saint Augustine, Homo
  circumferens mortalitatem, circumfert testimonium peccati sui, Man, that beares
  mortalitie about him, doth likewise beare about him a testimonie of his
  sinne. God cloathing man with the skinnes of dead beasts, gaue vs thereby
  to vnderstand, That these our cloathes serue as so many witnesses of mans sin
  and mortalitie; as the casting of the blacke cloake vpon the shoulders of some
  great Bashaw, shewes, that hee hath offended the grand Seigniour, and that his
  death is at hand. The Spanish Nation heares ill abroad, for the often change of
  fashions in their cloathes, running dayly out of one into another; it is a vice
  that they are much taxed for. And therefore,If the Spanish,
 God helpe the English. one painting forth the particular fashions of
  apparell belonging to all Nations whatsoeuer, when he commeth to portray forth
  a Spaniard, he sets him vpon a shopboord, with a peece of stuffe before him,
  and a paire of sheeres in his hand, to the end that hee might cut out his
  cloathes into what kind of fashion his fancie should best affect: Expressing
  therein, that he was so fantasticall, so various, and so mutable, that euerie
  day he would haue a new inuention. And to this purpose sutes that
  Hierogliphycke of Augustinus Celius; It beeing brought to the gods
  knowledge, That the Moone wandered vp and downe naked ouer hills &amp; dales;
  they sent Mercurie vnto her, to cut her out a garment, and to make it
  vp for her: But he could neuer come to take any true measure of her, by reason
  of her ordinarie creasings and wanings, not knowing what course in the world
  to take, vnlesse he should euerie day make her a new gowne. In a word, this
  rich mans robe was Prides ensigne, Luxuries nest, and Deaths Mantle.
               Heretofore, Purple and fine Linnen, Silkes, and Veluets, were
  onely cloathing for Kings, and such as were eminent persons in Court, and were
  dayly in his Maiesties eye, waiting and attending his person. But now, euerie
  one will in his weare and fashion, seeme to be that which he is not: The Clerke
  will goe as the Squire; the Squire as the Knight; the Knight as the Lord; the
  Lord as a Grande; a Grande as a King; and a King as God. The Prouerb, That
  it is not the Cowle that makes the Monke, is verified of all Estates: But
  as the richnesse of the garnishing addes not any finenesse to the Sword; (the
  comparison is Seneca's) so, a mans cloathes doe not better his being,
  nor adde any worth to him that weares them; but though he be not bettered in
  his being, yet hee is so much bettered in his seeming, that a man had need of
  some particular reuelation, to know which is which, and to whom we owe a
  respect and reuerence. To a Coward (who like Hercules, had lapt
  himselfe in a Lyons skinne) Diogenes said, If thou didst but see how
  ill this weare doth become thee, thou wouldst blush for shame. You shall haue a
  finical Taylor fling away his money (and peraduenture is worth halfe so much
  more) vpon a Silken suit, (as if honour did consist in Silke) and if you find
  fault with him for this his vanitie, his answer will be vnto you, My neighbour
  Fulano goes thus and thus, and I scorne but to goe as well clad as
  hee; my purse and my credit is as good as his; when, God knowes, he comes farre
  short of him in both: and this vanitie hath vndone many a man. Pharaoh
  and his People marched  through the bottom of the sea,
  and the occasion of this his so bold aduenture, was, That he had seene the
  Israelites goe that way before him. O yee foolish Aegyptians, Had yee God for
  your Captaine? Had yee the Rod of Moses to diuide the waters, and to
  make them stand like walls on either side? The like may I say to this Taylor,
  Hast thou as good meanes as thy neighbour? Esa
                        •
                     
                   going forth to meet Iacob,
                  
                     Gen. 33. who came from Mesopotamia, after a few
  brotherly embracements, and other kind complements of their loue each to other;
  Esau entreated his brother, that he would goe along with him and beare
  him companie: But Iacob made this discreet answer vnto him; Sir, I
  beseech you to excuse me, I must needs wait vpon my children and my flocks; and
  if to do you seruice, I should bring them out of the way they are in, they
  would all perish. When the vanitie of one that is more powerfull and wealthier
  than thy selfe, shall inuite thee to follow his humor, and call vnto thee, to
  go side by side with him; thou wilt, if thou beest wise, make vse of
  Iacobs excuse; telling him, If I shall runne this course, I shall
  ruine both my children and my estate. Seneca writing to L
                        •
                     
                     cilius, tells him, If thou conforme thy selfe to
  what Nature will bee well contented withall, thou shalt be rich; but if what
  Vanitie will egge thee vnto, thou shalt be poore. Clemens Alexandrinus
  hath a particular Discourse vpon this Argument, and that so large and so full,
  that it seemeth he had beene in all the houses of the Citie where he dwelt,
  and had diligently obserued what had past in euerie one of them. To what end
  (saith he) serueth a Bed with pillars of siluer, and pommels of gold, if thou
  sleepest as well (if not better) in one of Wood? To what end serue Curtaines of
  silke interwouen with gold, and Quilts curiously embroydered, if those of
  woollen keepe thee warmer? To what end a Cup of Crystall, if one of Glasse will
  as well serue the turne? For to dig into the earth, thou wilt not make thee a
  Spade or Mattocke of siluer, because that were a superfluous and needlesse
  thing: As needlesse and superfluous a thing is it, to haue a Bed of Yuorie,
  Ebonie, &amp;c. But, which is worse than all the rest, Saint
  Chrysostome saith, That for to feed our vanities, wee neuer want
  meanes nor moneys; but to pay our debts, or to bestow an Almes, or to relieue
  a friend in necessitie, there is no money to be found. One of the greatest
  charges, and most without excuse, which God will charge your rich and powerfull
  men withall, is, God hath giuen thee all this thy present prosperitie which
  thou enioyest, thy Lands, thy Rents, thy Lordships, thy Tenants, thy Gold, thy
  Siluer, &amp;c. And that God (who hath thus blest and prospered thee in the
  World) standing poore, naked, and hunger-starued at thy doore, thou hast faire
  Liueries for seruants, rich furniture for thy horses, siluer Garrotes or Wrests
  to packe vp and fasten thy Sumpter vpon thy strong backed Mules, costly
  Banquets for thy friends; but not so much as a rag or a crum to bestow vpon him
  who hath thus inriched thee with all these: Inexcusabilis es, ô
  Homo, Neither thou nor all the World knowes how to make answer to this
  obiection. Saint Hierome makes the like complaint, discoursing of
  those Ladies whose Coaches may rather be said to be of gold, than guilded;
  whose necks are laden with chains of Pearle, &amp; their fingers with Diamonds;
  and that they should liue thus in their jollitie &amp; plentie, and Christ die
  at their doores for hunger, it is such a charge, that when it comes to be laid
  home vnto them, it will admit no excuse.
            
            
               Epulabatur quotidiè splendidè.
               
                  He fared diliciously euerie day. Many of Gods Saints
  haue made Feasts and Banquets for their Kinsfolkes and friends, as Abraham,
  Tobie, Iob, and others;  but these their Feasts were
  modest and moderate, they were great, but not often. And neither can or will
  any man make dayly Feasts, vnlesse it bee such a one as makes his bellie his
  God, and thinkes that he was borne for no other end, but to pamper vp the
  flesh, and to make much of himselfe. Euerie vice whatsoeuer, is as a linke to a
  chaine, which drawes many other after it: but that of Gluttony, of all other is
  the most tyrannous and the most violent.
               First of all, It drawes dishonestie after it, as heretofore hath
  beene prooued. Saint Paul doth so wedge and glew these two vices
  together, as if they were but one and the selfe same thing; Non in
  conuiuijs &amp; impudicit
                        ••
                     s.
  And in another place he saith, That eating prouoketh the bodie, and that the
  bodie desireth and lusteth after eating.
               Secondly, It spoyles and marres the tongue, as Saint
  Gregorie prooueth it. There are two things (saith Salomon)
  that are able to, nay, doe ouerthrow the World; a Slaue sitting in the Kings
  Throne, that is one of them; the other, a Foole, whose bellie is glutted with
  meat, and whose head is full of wine. And if too much eating and drinking make
  the most discreet and best aduised man to lose the reyns of reason; what will
  it worke vpon a foole?
               Thirdly, It doth darken the Vnderstanding, as Saint
  Chrysostome hath noted it, alledging the example of Esau, who
  after he had eaten and drunken his fil, made light reckoning of the selling of
  his birthrigh. The fogges and vapours of the earth, cloud Heauen; those of the
  stomacke, Reason. What greater blindnesse (saith Lucian) than that of
  the Tast, extending it selfe no further than foure fingers bredth in the
  palate; Earth, Sea, and Ayre, are not sufficient to satisfie the same?
  Aristotle reports of Philogonus, That hee desired of the
  gods, That they would giue him such a necke as the Craines haue, that the taste
  and relish of his meat might continue the longer in it's going downe.
               Fourthly, It shortens mans life; Propter
  
                        •
                     rapulam, multi abierunt,
                  
                     Eccles. 37.30. 
                  By surfet haue many perished.
  Et plures gula, quam gladio periere, And more by sawce haue dyed than by the
  sword. This is the maine cause of your Apoplexies, and of your speedie
  and sudden Deaths. Clemens Alexandrinus relateth, That, Purpurea
  mors, was a Prouerbe of sudden death, because those that were cloathed in
  Purple, were commonly Gluttons. But for violent deaths, what experience more
  notorious? Let Ammon, Dauids eldest sonne speake this; and
  Elah King of Israell, slaine by the hands of Zambri; Clytus,
  Alex
                        ••
                     ders chiefest fauourite;
  Menadab, King of Syria; Assuerus; Haman, his Minion; and one
  of the Herods. Saint Basyll sayth, That the vice of eating
  well, is more desperate, than that of liuing ill. Many loose Wantons come to be
  reformed, but Gluttons neuer. Onely Death (sayes hee) ends that disease. This
  rich man, Saint Luke sayth, That hee dyed amidst his continuall
  banquettings; hauing no Medium betweene his eating, and his dying.
               Saint Chrysostome, layes this to this rich mans charge,
  That he did not beleeue the immortalitie of the Soule; nor the eternall
  happinesses, and miseries of that other life. And a great argument for the
  proofe thereof, is, That hee was so hastie with Abraham, That he
  would send one from the dead, to preach this Doctrine to his Kinsfolke, and
  friends. And Abraham answering, That they had Moses, and the
  Prophets; He replyed, Non pater Abraham, Not so father Abraham; I my
  selfe heard the testimonie of Moses, and the Sermons of those other
  Prophets, but for all this I could neuer bee persuaded, that Hell was prouided
  for mee, and Heauen prepared for Lazarus. My Kinsmen, are like to be
  of the same mind, as I was; and the like will succeed vnto them, as hath
  befalne mee, and  therefore I pray thee let one bee sent
  vnto them from the dead, that may put them out of this their errour,
  &amp;c.
            
            
               Erat autem mendicus, nomine Lazarus, vlceribus plenus.
               
                  There was a begger, named Lazarus, who wus full of
  Sores. Hee painteth foorth this poore man, and his wretched and miserable
  condition, counterposing it to those worldly felicities, wherewith this rich
  man did abound. The ones pouertie,Riches vnequally
 dispensed; Why? to the others riches; the ones sickenesse, to the
  others health; the ones hunger, to the others fulnesse; the ones nakednesse, to
  the others costly clothes; the ones leanenesse, to the others fatnesse; the
  ones sorrow, to the others ioy; the ones inioying of no pleasure in this life,
  to the others generall content that he tooke in all the delights and pleasures
  of this World. Transierunt in affectum cordis. Another letter hath
  it, In picturas cordium. Whatsoeuer his heart did desire, it was
  pictured as it were before him. Does a rich man desire a handsome woman? Money
  paints her foorth vnto him; does hee desire reuenge? Money will draw it out
  for him; does hee desire banquets, musicke, and good cloaths? Money does all
  this, and limm's them out vnto him, as in a faire and curious Table.
               Looking vpon the inequality of humane chances, in matter of
  good, and bad fortune; so much happines in some, so ill bestowed vpon them;
  &amp; so much miserie in other some, which they did not so wel deserue; there
  haue bin some fooles which haue not stick't blasphemously to say, Does God know
  well what hee doth? Ecce, ipsi peccatores, in saeculo, obtinuerunt
  diuitias; See, what an vnequall course God runs; The wickedst men, are
  commonly the most wealthie. But the trueth of it is, That this is a mysterie of
  Gods prouidence, though secret, and hid. Hee made the rich men his sonnes and
  heires here vpon Earth, to the end that the younger brethren might haue here
  their secure sustenance: And hee made the poore, heires of Heauen, that the
  rich might haue there, their 
                     •
                  ecure
  happinesse. So that the rich by releeuing the poore, and the poore by praying
  for the rich, they might both, by Gods fauour, haue equall portions in Heauen.
  Saint Paul sayth, That God made some rich, and some poore, that the
  aboundance of the rich, might supply the wants of the poore; and the
  aboundance of the poore, supply the wants of the rich. And so their lot might
  be alike. It succeeding with them, as it did in that miracle of the Manna; Hee
  that gathered much, had no more than he that gathered little; For whatsoeuer he
  gathered ouer and aboue, vnlesse he did repart the same vnto others, it
  stunke, and did rot and putrifie.2. Cor.
 8.14. 
                  Vt vestra abundantia, &amp;c. I will render it you in the
  Apostles owne words, That your aboundance may supply their lacke, and that
  also their aboundance may be for your lacke, that there may be equality. As it
  is written, He that gathereth much, hath nothing ouer, and he that gathereth
  little, had not the lesse. Saint Mathew sayth, That it is
  easier for a Camell to passe through the eye of a needle; than for a rich man
  to enter into the Kingdome of Heauen. Some vnderstand this Camell, to bee
  a Dromedary, some a Cable. But to him that shall aske me; how can a Camell, or
  a Cable, goe through the eye of a needle? I shall answere him thus, That a
  Camell beeing burnt, and beaten to poulder; and a Cable vntwisted and in wound,
  may enter thread after thread, into a needles eye. In like maner▪ a rich
  man, that puts his trust in his ritches, it is hard for him to goe to Heauen,
  or to get into the eye of this needle.
                     Tob.
 4. But he may so lessen himselfe, by giuing of almes to the poore, that
  he may &amp;c. Fiducia magna eleemosina omnibus fatientibus
  
                        〈◊〉
                     . This so Excellent an
  artifice, seemeth to those that apprehend it not, a great disorder. 
   And as hee that turnes often about, thinkes that the
  world goes round with him: so he that hath a giddie head, takes Gods prouidence
  to be disorder. But, if there be any inequalitie, it is on the poore mans part,
  because God hath made them such great Lords in heauen, that the rich had need
  to get themselues out of their hands by Almesdeeds. Daniel, to
  Nebucadnezar, Breake off thy iniquities by giuing Almes: Alluding to
  that of the Prouerbe, The ransome of a mans life are his riches. Saint
  Chrysostome saith,
                     Dan. 4.27.
 Prou. 13.8. That God did not create the Rich for to relieue the
  Poore; but the Poore, that the Rich might not be barren of good workes. And
  Saint Austen, That Mercie stands before Hell gates, seeking to diuert
  condemnation from the Rich.
               
                  Full of Sores.
                  Life without health,
 no life▪
                   In this Counterposition he begins first with the
  sickenesse of the Poore: For as health next to life is the greatest good; so, a
  long, a grieuous, and a painefull sickenesse is the greatest ill.
  Ecclesiasticus saith, That a poore man that is sound and lustie, is
  better than a rich man that is sicke and feeble. Health is of a greater price
  than either gold or siluer, and there is no treasure to be compared to a bodie
  that is strong and healthie. And indeering this truth, hee saith, That death is
  a lesse euill than a bitter life; and the graue, than a long and grieuous
  sickenesse. So that in conclusion, he preferreth health before life. But if to
  these sores of Lazarus, we shall adde hunger, nakednesse, and
  weakenesse, and all these in so high a degree, that he was not able to lift vp
  his Crutches to driue away the Dogges which did licke away, together with the
  matter and filth of his Sores, his verie life from him; a man can hardly
  comprehend a greater miserie.
            
            
               Insuper, &amp; Canes lingebant.
               
                  And the Dogs licked, &amp;c. The greatest miserie that
  Lazarus indured, was the crueltie of this rich man, and of all his
  whole house; for euen the yerie Dogs in the house of a cruell man, are also
  cruel. This doth this word Insuper infer: Here are so many miseries
  heaped one vpon another, that they can hardly be reduced to a summe.
               
                  And the Dogs licked, &amp;c. The verie Dogs did sucke
  &amp; licke out the life of him▪ And this crueltie may be considered two
  manner of wayes:
               The one, That this rich man affronted poore Lazarus,
  speaking vnto his seruants in a commanding manner, What doth this poore Rogue
  make here, send him packing, that I may see him no more; and I charge you, that
  you giue him not so much as a Cup of cold water, lest, like a Fowlers
  Whistle,Riches vsually accompanied with pride &amp;
 crueltie. he may serue as a Call, to inuite all the Beggers in the
  country to come tomorrow to my house, hoping that they shall speed no worse
  than he hath done. They performe their masters command, and when they had so
  done, they come in and tell him, Sir, we haue dismist him, and willed him to be
  gone; but the poore man is very importunate, and loath to stir. Is he so,
  (quoth he) marrie then will I tell you what you shall doe; turne out these Dogs
  vpon him, and they will set him hence with a vengeance. This construction Saint
  Augustine makes in a Sermon of his; and withall, leaues vs this note
  for our better learning; Quod in lingua majorem se
                        •
                     tit ardorem, quia per eam contempsit Pauperem, That he
  felt therefore the greater heat in his tongue, because with it hee had the
  Poore in derision, and made it the Whip to lash them.
               The other, That this rich man made as though he were deafe and
  would not heare on that eare, when the Poore cryed o
                     •
                  t vnto him, though his miserable condition &amp;
  hunger-starued carka
                     •
                  se (though he
  poore soule had held his peace) spake in a loud voice vnto him, to bestow
  something vpon him, Those crummes  (good Master) that are
  come from your table; those scraps (for Gods sake) that are left, &amp;c. Of
  these two interpretations you may take which you please; but I am sure, neither
  of both but is a sinne, and that a great one too. In which sinne of this
  vncharitable Chuffe, wee are to consider three verie wofull circumstances.
               The first, That it is a sinne that is generally hated and
  abhorr'd. For all other sinnes haue some Patrons to protect them, some abettors
  to defend them, or some fauourers to excuse them, if not in heauen, yet at
  least here on earth; but against this vnmercifull and hard hearted sinne, God,
  Heauen, Earth, Angells, and Men, haue so open and wide an eare, and conceiue so
  ill of it, that they thinke none deserues Hell better. And therefore it is
  said, Iudicium sine misericordia, his qui non faciunt misericordiam,
  Iudgement without mercie, to those that shew no mercie. When he
  falls,
                     Iob 20.27. no man will take pittie of
  him: Reuelabunt Coeli iniquitatem ei
                        ••
                     , &amp; Terra consurget aduersius eum, The Heauen shall declare his
  wickednesse, and the Earth shall rise vp against him. All the World will
  crie out against an vnmercifull minded man; as on the contrarie, they will
  praise and applaud him that is of a pittifull and tender disposition:
  Enarrabit Eleemosynas suas omnis Ecclesia Sanctorum, The whole Congregation
  shall talke of his praise, and the Generations that are to come shall
  speake good things of him. Whereas the other, his name shall perish from off
  the earth, but his torments in hell shall endure for euer. Saint
  Austen is of opinion, That there is not any sinne more iniurious to
  Nature, than this. You shall haue a rich man keepe in his house a Lyon, a
  Beare, fiue or sixe cast of Falcons, to all which, he alots dayly a liberal
  allowance: the poore man comes vnto him, makes his moane, and in a pittifull
  and humble fashion sayes vnto him, Sir, I beseech you (for Gods sake) bestow
  one single pennie, or a piece of bread on a poore weake creature, that is not
  able to worke for his liuing: Yet wil not the rich man giue him that which he
  giues vnto his Beasts; ô, what an inhumane thing is this, and how harsh
  to euery good mans nature.
               The second circumstance is this, That God doth with such
  difficultie remit this sinne, that if any be irremissable, it is this: not only
  for it's crueltie, so contrarie to the bowells of Gods compassion; but also,
  for that taxing his prouidence, he makes such light reckoning of the miseries
  of the Poore, that hee weighes them by ounces, and measures them out by ynches:
  nay, hee proceeds further, by adding griefe vnto griefe, and affliction to
  affliction; and iudging those jerks of Gods diuine Iustice to be too gentle, he
  lays a heauier hand &amp; greater load vpon him.
                     Zach. 1.15. This is that, that made
  Zacharie to crie out, Magna ira irascor, &amp;c. I am greatly
  incensed against your richer sort of men; for I was angrie but a little, and
  they helped forward the affliction. I send the Poore a sore for the
  chastisement of his sinnes, that thereby I may bring him to heauen; &amp;
  these would flea him aliue.
                     Amos 4.1. The
  Prophet Amos thunders out a terrible threatning against them, in the
  metaphor of fat Kyne; Audite haec vaccae pingues, qui confringitis, &amp;c.
  Heare this Word yee Kyne of Bashan, that are in the Mountaines of Samaria,
  which oppresse the Poore, and destroy the Needie, thou hast not left one bone
  of them vnbroken; but I sweare by my Holinesse, That I will be reuenged of
  thee. Lo, the dayes shall come vpon you, that I will take you away with
  Thornes, and your Posteritie with Fish-hookes, and y
                        ••
                      shall goe out at the breaches, euerie Cow forward, and
  yee shall cast your selues out of the Pallace. Thus he calleth the Princes
  and Gouernors, which being ouerwhelmed with the great abundance of Gods
  benefits, forgat God &amp; his poore Members; and therefore he calleth them by
  the name of beasts, and not of men. No lesse fearefull is that menacing of
  Micah,
                  
                     Mich. 3.1. 
                  Heare, ô
  yee Heads of Iacob, and yee Princes of  the house of
  Israell, who plucke off the skin of the Poore, and the flesh from off their
  bones; who also eat the flesh of my people, and fley off the skinne from them,
  and breake their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot, and as flesh
  within the Caldron. They shall cry vnto me (saith the Lord) in the time of
  their trouble, but I will not heare them; I will euen hide my face from them at
  that time, because they haue done wickedly in their workes. O, that men
  should be so vnnaturall as to 
                     •
                  lay
  the skinne from the flesh, and then presently to teare the flesh from the
  bone. God puts a poore man into pouertie, but he doth not
  
                     •
                  lay him nor kill him; but the rich
  man▪ does thus, tormenting him anew, whom God hath alreadie punished
  enough; Because they haue smitten those whome I haue smitten, and haue
  added new wounds to those that I haue alreadie inflicted vpon them.
               
               The third circumstance is taken out of Iob; where he
  treateth of another rich man like vnto this of whom we now speake of. Non
  remansit de cibo eius,
                  
                     Iob. 20.
                  propterea nihil permanebit de bonis eius, There shall none of his meat be
  left, and there shall bee no memoriall of his goods. When he shall be
  filled with his aboundance he shal be in paine, and the hand of all the Wicked
  shall assaile him; he shall bee about to fill his bellie, but God shall send
  vpon him his fierce wrath, &amp; shall cause to raine vpon him, euen vpon his
  meat: He shall flie from the Yron Weapons, and the Bow of Steele shall strike
  him through; the Arrow is drawne out, and commeth forth of the bodie, and
  shineth out of his gall, so feare commeth vpon him. All darkenesse shall bee
  hid in his secret places, the fire that is not blowne shall deuoure him, and
  that which remaineth in his Tabernacle shall be destroyed. The Heauen shall
  declare his wickednesse, and the Earth shall rise vp against him; the increase
  of his house shall goe away, it shall flow away in the day of his wrath. This
  is his portion from God, &amp; the heritage that he shall haue of God: For he
  that was so vnmercifull, that he would not affoord the crummes that fell from
  his Table to the Poore, shal be so far from enioying the least good (though it
  be but a drop of water) that God will rather cause him to vomit vp those good
  things which he hath eaten in this life. He hath deuoured
  substance,
                  
                     Iob. 20.1
                        •
                     . 
                  and he shall vomit it; for God shall draw
  it out of his bellie. Hee shall vomit it forth with a great deale of
  paine; if he shall call for drinke, the Deuills shall say vnto him, Spew vp
  that which thou hast drunke; if for meat, Vomit vp that which thou hast eaten:
  He shall sucke the gall of Aspes, and the Vipers tongue shall slay him: He
  shall not see the riuers, nor the Flouds and Streames of Honey and Butter: Hee
  shall restore the labour, and deuoure no more, euen according to his substance
  shall be his exchange, and he shall enioy i
                     •
                   no more: For he hath vndone many, hee hath forsaken the Poore, and
  hath spoyled houses which hee builded not; surely he shall find no quietnes in
  his bodie, neither shal he reserue of that which he desired.
            
            
               Factum est autem vt moreretur mendicus.
               
                  But it came to passe that the Begger died. First,
  Lazarus dies;Why desperat Sinners are often
 suffered▪ to liue long. for God euermore makes more hast to drie
  vp the teares of the Iust, than the plaints of the Sinner: Ad vesperum
  demorabitur flet
                        ••
                     , &amp;c. Their
  teares shall continue to the euening, &amp;c. Amongst many reasons which
  the Saints doe render, Why Gods Iustice comes commonly with a leaden foot; that
  of Saint Gregorie is an excellent one, which is, That so great is the
  wretchednesse which waits vpon a Reprobate, that it is not much, that God
  should permit him to enioy some few yeares more of his miserable and vnhappie
  happinesse. A pittifull Iudge is woont sometime to deferre the Delinquents
  sentence of death; but when carelesse of his doome, 
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                   
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                   
                   he sees him game,
  eat, and sleepe; he sayes, Let him alone, and let him make himselfe as merrie
  as he can, for this world will not last long with him; for his destruction is
  at hand, and the stroke of death hangs ouer his head, and when it comes it will
  come suddenly vpon him. Many great sinners liue to be verie old men before they
  die; and the reason of it is, for that God (who is a God of patience) suffers
  them to liue here the longer, for that after their death a bitter portion
  remaineth for them.
            
            
               
                  Et portaretur ab Angelis, And he was carried of
  Angells.
               Euerie torment is so much the more cruell, by how much the more
  it suffereth in the extreames that are opposite thereunto. Iob
  pondering that of Hell, saith, That those that are there tormented, passe from
  snow to fire, Ab aquis niuium, ad nimium colorem. The like succeedeth
  in content, which is so much the greater, by how much we goe from a greater
  sorrow to a greater joy. Such then was the condition of Lazarus,
  passing from the pawes of Dogs, to the hands of Angells; from the Portch of a
  Tyrant, to the bosome of Abraham; from the greatest miserie, to the
  greatest happinesse that they who were euen the most blessed did then enioy.
  The Dogs (in Scripture) is the symbole or hierogliphick of a most filthie,3. Kings. 8. vile, and base thing. Abner
  sayd vnto Ishbosheth, Am I a Dog, that thou thus despisest mee? The
  Poet giues him this beastly Epithite, Obsaenoque Cane.
                  
                     Math. 7. And Saint Mathew, by way of
  scorne, Non licet sanctum dare Canibus. But the Angells are the
  noblest of all other creatures, and the purest; for God molded them with his
  owne hands. So that Lazarus went from the vilest and the basest, to
  the cleanest and the noblest hands. Saint Chrysostome reports of the
  Roman Triumphants, That some entred Rome in Chariots drawne with pyde Horses;
  others with Elephants; others with Lyons; and others with Swannes: but the
  Chariot of Apollo was drawne by swift and nimble footed Gynnets. There
  was a Tyrant that had his Chariot drawne with those Kings that hee had
  conquered. But Lazarus his Chariot did far exceed all these, for this
  was drawn by the hands of Angells. Sabellicus saith, That when
  Tullyes banishment was reuersed, they bore him throughout all Italy
  vpon their shoulders, Totius Italiae humeris e
                        •
                     ectus est. Dauid saith, That Gods
  Chariot is drawne with Cherubines, [Ascendit super Cherubim, &amp;
  volauit:] God then lending Lazarus this his Chariot, it is no
  meruaile if in a trice hee flew vp into the bosome of Abraham. S
                        •
                     
                     lomon when he was proclaimed
  King, rode on his Fathers Mule; Mordech
                        •
                     i for his more honour was mounted on Assuerus his
  owne Horse: but Lazarus (to surpasse these) went in triumph to heauen
  in Gods owne Chariot. This must needs breed a great confusion and amasement in
  this rich man; that the Angells should carrie him being dead, into heauen; on
  whom he would not vouchsafe to looke, nor bestow a morcell of bread being
  aliue.
               
                  And he was carried of Angels. One Angel was enough to
  ouerthrow a mountaine; one onely sufficeth to mooue these coelestiall Orbes;
  but it is Saint Chrysostomes note, That, Euerie one was glad to
  put a helping hand to so worthie a burthen
  
                        •
                      this; As many earnestly
  thrust themselues forward, to beare a foot, a leg, or an arme of some great
  Monarch.

               Some vnderstand by this his bosome, the neerest place about
  Abraham. As in that of the Euangelist, All the Apostles supt with our
  Sauiour Christ; but Saint Iohn onely, leaned his head in his bosome.
  And in that other, Vnigenitu
                        •

   qui est in sinu patris, &amp;c. The onely begotten, who
  is in the bosome of the Father. As also that, A dextris, At his right
  hand. So likewise, Many shall lie downe with Abraham, Isaac, and
  Iacob. And the Church singeth, Martinus, Abrahae sinu, laetus
  excipitur.

                  But the rich man died, and was buried. The Greeke makes
  there a full point; and then presently goes on, In inferno autem cum
  esse
                        •
                      in tormentis, But when he was
  in hell in torment. But of Lazarus it is not said, That they
  buried him; whither it were for that he had no buriall at all, or for that
  beeing so poore and miserable a creature, Earth made no mention of him, as
  Heauen did not of the rich man; But we read of the rich man, Sepultus est,
  He was buried. Hitherto did reach the jurisdiction of his riches, and the
  peculiar of his prosperitie; great Ceremonies, watchfull attendance about his
  Corps, many Mourners, Doles to the Poore, Tombes of Alabaster, Vaults paued
  with Marble, Lamentations, odoriferous Ointments, pretious Embalmings, Funerall
  Orations, &amp; solemne Banquets: In all this, I confesse, the rich man hath a
  great aduantage of him that is poore. But in this outward pompe lies all the
  rich mans happinesse; and when hee hath entred the doores of darkenesse, and is
  shut vp in his graue, like the Hedge-hogge, hee leaues his Apples behind him,
  and nothing remaines with him but the prickles of a wounded conscience, his
  howlings, his lamentations, weeping, gnashing of teeth, and whatsoeuer other
  torments Hell can affoord. Diuitiarum jactantia, quid contulit nobis? The
  ostentation and glory of riches, what good doth it bring vnto vs? O, would
  to God that I had bin some poore Sheepheard! O, how too late haue I fallen into
  an account of myne owne hurt! O World, would to God I had neuer knowne
  thee.
               
                  He died, and was buried. There is no felicitie so
  great,Nothing permanent in this life. that can
  diuert the euill of Death: let the rich man liue the yeares of Nestor,
  the ages of Methusalem; in the end hee must descend into the graue.
  The cleerest Heauen must haue it's Cloud, and the brightest day must haue it's
  night; the Sunne, though neuer so shining, must haue it's setting; the Sea,
  though neuer so calme, must haue it's storme. If the good things of this life
  were perpetuall, they that are in loue with them might pretend some excuse; but
  beeing that worldly pleasure is a Wheele that is alwayes moouing, a Riuer that
  is alwayes running, a Mill that is alwayes going, and grinding vs to dust; How
  canst thou settle thy selfe sure thereupon? The highest places are the least
  secure; the Moon when she is at the full, foretells a waine; and the Sunne when
  it is at the heigth, admits a declination; the house, the higher it is built,
  the more subiect it is to falling: And the Nest (saith Abdias) that is
  neerest to the Starres, God doth soonest throw it downe.
               
                  The rich man died. He tells not how he liued, but how
  he died; for death is the eccho of mans life, and he hauing led so cruell and
  so mercilesse a life,As a mans life is, so is his
 death. what good could he hope for at his death? Quoniam non est in
  morte, qui memor sit tui, laboraui in gemitu meo, &amp;c. The first part,
  Reason prooueth vnto vs: The second, Weeping &amp; howling. In my life time I
  aske God forgiuenesse for my sinnes: For the man that is vnmindfull of this in
  his life, God doth not thinke on him at his death. Many call vpon God at the
  houre of their death, and it makes a mans haire to stand an end, to see a man
  carelesse in so dangerous a passage, &amp; only because Death is the eccho of
  our life. Others will cal vpon Iesus, but as that crucified Theefe, that dyed
  without deuotion: For that heart which is hard in his 
  life, is likewise hard in his death.
            
            
               
                  Cum esset in tormentis. When he was in torment,
  &amp;c.
               Here is an indefinite tearme, put for a vniuersall. For albeit
  euery one of the damned doe suffer the full measure and weight of his sinnes;
  and (acording to Saint Austen, and Saint Gregory) suffer most
  in that particular, wherein they most offended; And that therefore the rich man
  did suffer more in his tongue, than any other member of his bodie: yet
  notwithstanding, there is not any one that is d
                     •
                  mned, which doth not generally suffer in all his whole bodie, and
  in euery part of his soule. For, as Heauen is a happinesse, that imbraceth all
  happinesse; so Hell, is a misery that includeth all miseries. There was neuer
  yet any tyrant in the world, in whose prisons and dungeons all torments were
  inflicted at once. But in that of Hell, there is not any torment, which is not
  felt at one and the same instant. The body, that shall generally suffer: And
  for this, fire, and cold, will suffice; which are generall torments. The soule
  shall likewise generally suffer sorrow and paine, not only because the fire
  shall burne it, which though corporall, yet shall it's flames haue an
  operatiue vertue and working vpon the soule; but because all hope being lost of
  any kind of joy whatsoeuer, there shall therein be deposited all the reasons
  that may be, of sorrow and of miserie. Likewise there shall be particular
  torments for the sences of the bodie, &amp; for the faculties of the soule; the
  eyes shall enioy so much light as shall serue to see fearefull Visions, (so
  sayes Cirillus Alexandrinus) and on the other side, they shall suffer
  such thicke and palpable darknesse, that they shall imagine them to be the
  ghastly shadowes of death. Saint Chrysostome saith, That they shall
  see the huge and infinite numbers of the Damned, taking notice of all those
  that conuersed with them in their life time, as fathers, grandfathers,
  brothers, and friends. And if the varietie &amp; multitude that are in a deep
  dungeon, if the ratling of their chains, the clattring of their shackles, their
  hunger, their nakednesse, the noyse, coyle, &amp; confusion which they make,
  cause a horrour in as many as both see and heare it; what a terrour then will
  it be, to see the miserable torments, and to heare the fearefull shri
                     •
                  kes and pittifull outcries of those
  that are damned to the bottomlesse pit of hell? The eares will suffer with
  their howlings, their lamentations, their blasphemies, their cursings, their
  ragings, their dispairings; besides the vntunable and harsh musicke of the
  Deuills, roaring and yellowing like so many mad Bulls, that with the dinne and
  hideousnesse of the noyse, Heauen and Earth might haue seemed to come together,
  and the whole frame and machine of the Orbes to haue crackt and fallen in
  sunder. The smell, the taste, the touch, the will, the vnderstanding, and the
  memorie, both irrascible and concupiscible, shall not be employed vpon any
  thing (as Saint Augustine hath noted it) from whence they shall not
  receiue most grieuous paine and torment. But of all other torments, that of
  their desperation will be the greatest, because there will be no wading through
  this Lake that burnes with fire and brimstone, nor no end at all to these their
  endlesse miseries. That ten thousand, nay, a hundred thousand yeares
  continuance in hell shall not suffice to satisfie for their sinnes, that the
  fountaine of mercie should be shut vp for euer, not affoording them so much as
  one drop of cold water to coole the tongue; that God will not admit for the
  offences of three dayes, the satisfaction of seuentie times seuen thousands of
  yeares. This is that Magnum Chaos inter vos &amp; nos; This is that
  great Chaos, that huge Gulfe which is set betweene you and vs; it is Chaos
  impertransibile, that impassable Gulfe, wherein to fall it is easie, but
  to get out impossible.
               
                  Many of the Saints vpon this consideration
  deepely weighing these things with themselues, haue made great exclamations; as
  S. Chrysostome, Petrus Crysologus, and others. If we beleeue (say
  they) that this imprisonment is perdurable, t
                     •
                  is fire is eternall, and that these torments are endlesse; How
  comes it to passe that we eat, liue, and sleepe as we do? O, the madnesse of
  those men who seeke fit and handsome dwellings for three dayes, and omit to
  thinke of those eternall habitations which continue world without end! O, the
  sottishnesse of those which couet such short and transitorie contentments! O,
  the blindnesse of those, who for a moment of pleasure wil aduenture an
  eternitie of pain! Is it much that these holy Saints should exclaime? Is it
  much that they should weepe teares of bloud, who beleeue that this rich man
  doth frie in perpetuall flames, because he was pittiles &amp; voyd of mercy?
  seeing on the one side so many Lazaruses, naked, ful of sores, &amp;
  driuen, if not beaten away from our dores; whose beds are the hard benches and
  open porches of the Rich; whose meat are the scraps and offalls, and oftentimes
  onely the bare crummes of the rich mans boord; whose drinke are the waters of
  those Riuers and Fountaines where the Beasts doe drinke; whose wardrobe are
  rags; whose cattle, vermine; whose store, miserie; whose tables are their
  knees; and whose cups are their hands: And on the other side, so many Gluttons,
  who feeding like beasts, vomit forth that they eat, at their tables where they
  sit; [Mensae repletae sunt vomitu] beeing as emptie of pittie, as they
  are full of wine: [Optimo vino delibuti non compatiebantur super
  contritionem Ioseph] who dying (like Oxen in a stall) fat and ful fed, it
  is no meruaile if (as Esay sayth) they make Hells sides to stretch and
  cracke againe, Propter hoc dilatauit infernus Os suum.
               
               I would faine aske some one of those which heare me this day, My
  friend, tel me, I pray thee, thinkest thou, or hast thou any hope, that thou
  art the only man in this world that shall liue here for euer? Doost thou
  beleeue that Death shall one day come to the threshold of thy doore, and call
  for thee, and that thou must hereafter giue a strict account of thy workes,
  words, and thoughts, before the tribunall seat of God? If thou doost, tell me
  then againe, Whither thou hadst rather desire the felicitie of Lazarus
  in that other life, or the eternall torments of this rich man? Art thou
  persuaded, that thou canst weare out two thousand yeares in a bed of fire? But
  if the verie thought thereof cause feare and horror in thee, and makes euerie
  bone and ioynt in thy bodie to shake and tremble, Why doost thou not seeke to
  flie from so great a danger? Flie (saith Saint Austen) yet now euen to
  day, whilest thou hast time.
            
            
               Pater Abraham, rogo vt mittas Lazarum, aut vnum ex
  mortuis.
               
                  Father Abraham, I pray thee send Lazarus, or one from the
  Dead, &amp;c.
                  Why the rich mans petition was
 repelled. 
                  Origen saith, That this rich man did desire, That
  either Lazarus, or some one from the Dead, might bee sent to preach
  this point: thinking with himselfe, That Abraham might happely send
  him vnto himselfe, as to one that by this time verie wel knew his owne errour;
  and that so by this meanes he might haue some pause or breathing time from
  these his torments. Whither this was so, or no, it may by some be doubted; but
  this is a cleere case, That the maine motiue that mooued him thereunto, was,
  the desire that he had that his brethren and kinsfolke might be drawne vnto
  repentance, and thereby come to be saued, and escape those intollerable
  torments which he indured. Saint Chrysostome saith, That
  Abraham did not yeeld to the rich mans petition, because hee was not
  absolute Lord of that place: But that our Sauiour Christ supplied that defect,
  and carried himselfe  like a most mercifull and kind
  louing Lord, to the end that that stiffe necked Nation might not alledge in
  their excuse, That hee had not sent them a Preacher from that other life, to
  aduise them what passed there. But our Sauiour (for whom this businesse was
  reserued) did not raise vp Lazarus the Poore, but Lazarus the
  Rich, who vpon occasion preacht great &amp; notable things vnto them,
  concerning the life to come. And he likewise raised vp the sonne of the widow
  of Naim, that hee might also doe the like. But those that will not beleeue the
  Prophets (it is our Sauiours owne saying) will lesse beleeue the Dead.
            
            
               
                  Quia crucior in hac flamma, Because I am tormented
  in this flame.
               Gods chastisements are like Lightning, which kill one, but
  fright many; and the vengeance which God taketh of one sinner, is an occasion
  giuen to the Iust, to wash their hands in his bloud. According to that of
  Dauid, Cum viderit vindictam, manus suas lauabit in sanguine
  peccatoris. And Saint Gregorie expoundeth it thus, That the Iust
  doth wash his hands in the bloud of a Sinner, when by another mans punishment
  he learnes to amend his owne life. There is nothing doth more terrifie a
  Theefes heart, than the gallowes and rope wherewith his fellow was hanged:
  Funes peccatorum circumplexi sunt me, &amp; Legem tuam non sum
  oblitus; when I saw another strangled,To what purpose
 they serue those cords which choked him sate likewise close to my necke;
  but giuing thee thankes, ô Lord, that thou hadst kept mee from comming to
  so bad an end, I did resolue with my selfe, that I would not forget thy Law.
  And therefore God would haue vs to lay vp in an euerlasting remembrance, as it
  were, his seuerest and sharpest punishments. Desiderium Impij m
                        •
                     nimentum est pessimorum; so saith
  Salomon. To this end the Scripture recounteth, that the earth
  swallowed vp Korah, Dathan, &amp; Abiram, &amp; the rest of
  those rebellious schismaticks, wrapping them in flames &amp; smoke; &amp; the
  Censers remaining in the midst of the fire, Moses commanded that they
  should be taken out, &amp; broad plates made of them for a couering of the
  Alter, Vt haberent postea filij Israel, quibus commonerentur,
                  
                     Num. 16. 
                  That they might serue as a memoriall
  and warning to the children of Israell: As false weights doe, that are
  nayled vp in the Market place; grounds that are ploughed with salt, and the
  heads of malefactors in the highway. Because the people of God had intangled
  themselues with the Moabites, there perished of them twentie foure thousand;
  but God commanded that the Princes should be hanged against the Sunne. Saint
  Augustine saith, That this was done for an admonishment to the people;
  The Seuentie read, Ostende eos Domine, contra Solem; That God and all
  the world may see them, and that they may remaine as a perpetuall example to
  posteritie. The Historie of the Machabees reports vnto vs,2. Mac. 15.30. That Nicanor vttered a
  most beastly blasphemie, saying, That his power was as great as that of God;
  but the diuine justice punishing this his insolencie, his head was set vp on
  the highest tower in the citie, &amp; his right hand, which he had held vp so
  proudly, they nayled it against the doore of the Temple, and caused his tongue
  to be cut in little pieces, and to be cast vnto the Fowles. Pharaohs
  and his Peoples death,
                     Wis. 19.5. the booke
  of Wisedome saith, That it was conuenient that the people of Israell
  should see it and consider it; Vt ostenderet quemadmodum inimici eorum
  exterminabantur, That the people might trie a meruailous passage, and that
  these might find a strange death. Theodoret brings a comparison of him
  that makes an Anotomie, or dissection vpon a dead bodie, for the instruction of
  those that are liuing. And Zacharie paints out vnto vs a Talent of
  lead: And this was a woman that sate in the midst of the Ephah, whose name or
  title was, Impietie, or Wickednesse; which (hee saith) was
  carried vnto Babylon, Vt poneretur super  vasem suum,
  To be established and set vp there in her owne place; that beeing set vp
  aloft vpon a Piller, shee might continue there for a perdurable example.
  Aulus Gellius in his Noctibus Atticis, saith, That Princes
  haue three ends in their punishments:
               The one, The amendment of the fault: And to this end
  Pilat commaunded our Sauiour Christ to be whipt; Corripiam eum,
  &amp;c.
               
               The other, The authoritie of the offended; for if disrespect
  should not bee punished, it would breed contempt.
               The third, For the terror and example of others; for,
  Iusticia aliena est disciplina propria, Other mens punishment is our
  instruction; And that man is a foole, whom other mens harmes cannot make
  to beware. When the Lyon was sicke, all the beasts of the field went to visit
  him, onely the Foxe stayed behind, and would not goe vnto him: and being askt
  the reason, he answered, I find the tracke of many going in, but of none
  comming out; and I am not so desperate as to cast my selfe wilfully away, when
  as I may sleepe in a whole skinne. The footsteps of the Angells that fell, may
  aduise vs of our pride; the ashes of Sodome tell vs of our filthinesse; the
  Gallowes of Iudas forewarne vs of our auarice; and the hell of this
  rich man restraine vs from our cruelties. When God punished the Iewes, hee
  scattered them farre and neere ouer the face of the whole earth, that they
  might strike a feare into all other Nations. A corporall medicine fits not all
  sores; but corporall punishment meets with all faults.
            
            
               Fili, recordare quia recepisti bona in vita tua.
               
                  Sonne, remember that thou in thy life receiuedst good
  things.
                  There is a viciss
                        •
                     tude and change to be seene in all things. Death called
 a change. This is a dangerous trucke, a fearefull exchange, which makes
  humane happinesse not onely to be suspected, but also abhorred. Iob
  calls Death, a Change; [Expecto donec veniat immutatio mea, I stay waiting
  for my Change.] And as your Sheepe which in Syria breed fine wooll,
  passing along to Seuill, suffer a change, and are apparelled with a rougher and
  courser sort of wooll; so these your pamper'd persons of this world, and those
  that fare daintily and deliciously euerie day, shall change the soft wool of
  tender sheep, into the harsh haires of goats &amp; camels. Nature in all things
  hath ordered a kind of alternatiue change, or interchangeable mutation; as is
  to be seene in nights and in dayes, in Sommer and in Winter. The like doth
  succeed in the order of Grace; there cannot bee two Hells, neither shall there
  be two Glories. A Phylosopher asking one, Which of these two hee had rather be,
  either Craesus, (who was one of the richest, but most vicious men in
  the world) or Socrates? (who was one of the poorest, but most vertuous
  men in the world) His answer was, That in his life he would be a
  Croesus, but in his death, a Socrates. So, if it had beene
  put to this rich mans choice, I doe thinke he could haue wisht in his heart, to
  haue beene in his life Diues, and in his death Lazarus.
  Balaam shewed the like desire, Moriatur anima mea morte Iustorum, Let
  my soule die the death of the Righteous. But they desire an
  impossibilitie; for Death is a kind of trucke or exchange: Fili, recepisti
  bona in vita tua, Lazarus similiter mala; Sonne, remember that thou in thy
  life time receiuedst thy pleasures, and likewise Lazarus paines; now
  therefore is he comforted, and thou art tormented. But I wil no longer torment
  your patieence. God of his infinite goodnes, &amp;c.
            
         
         
            
            THE SIXTEENTH SERMON, VPON THE FRYDAY AFTER THE SECOND SONDAY
IN LENT.
            
               
                  MAT. 21. MARC. 12. LVC. 20. 
                  
                     Homo quidam plantauit Vineam.
                   
                  A certaine man planted a Vineyard.
               
            
            
               THis is a Law Suit or Tryall betweene God and his People;
wherein,The drift of the story. according to the
tenor of the Processe, his people are condemned as vngratefull, cruell,
disrespectiue, forgetfull of their dutie, and thrust out of all that they had,
as vnworthie of that good which they possessed. This Storie much resembles the
Statua of Nebucadnezar,
               
                  Dan. 2.
whose head was of gold, whose brest was of siluer, whose bodie of brasse, whose
legs of yron, and whose feet of clay. For God hauing begun first vnto them with
many great kindnesses, extraordinarie fauours, and vndeserued courtesies, he
goes descending and declining from them, till they fall into the greatest
disgrace &amp; disfauor that any soule can receiue from the hands of God.
            
               Feare, the only thing to keepe safe the
  Vineyard. Esay. 5.4.
               A certaine man planted a Vineyard.
He planted so perfect a Vineyard, that it might truly be said, What could I
haue done more vnto my Vineyard? And this is a strange indeering on Gods
part, That he should make choice of this Vine-stocke from amongst all the rest
of the Countries and Nations of the World. When the most High had diuided
the Nations, and when he had separated the sonnes of Adam. Esay calls
it,
                  Esay. 5.7. Ier. 22. 
               Germen
dilectabile, His pleasant Plant. Ieremie, Vineam electam, his elect and choyce
Vine. Saint Hierome, Vineam Sorec, which is a Vine-plant, whose
grapes (according to some) had no stones in them. And he compassed it with an
hedge: whereby some Commentators vnderstand, the Angels protecting of it;
others, Gods garding of it himselfe; others, the feare of punishment; For,
Feare keepes the Vineyard safe. And this Gods owne Inheritance may runne a
twofolde danger:
            First, In regard of the Deuills malice; and against this, God
opposeth himselfe, by making a hedge about it, and by drawing a line, beyond
which the Deuill cannot passe.
            Secondly, In regard of our libertie; against which hee hath placed
the Feare of the Law, and the seueritie of Gods chastisements: For, it is
Feare that keepe
                     •
                   the Vineyard
safe. If there be any thing that puts a bridle to these our vnlawful 
 longings, it is this Feare; as hath beene alreadie
prooued in that our former discourse, treating of the rich mans being in
Hell.
            God hath so seuerely punished some sinnes, that in mans seeming he
might be thought to haue gone a little too farre, and to haue exceeded therein;
as in that of Ananias and Saphira, and many others, which (as
Tertullian hath verie well obserued) were as so many Proclamations
pasted vp on the principall posts of the Citie, to aduise the people what his
diuine Iustice meant to doe hereafter in the like kind of delicts. And to this
end God would that those his primary executions of his Iustice should remaine
as a perpetuall memoriall to posteritie: As that of the Angells, against our
pride; that of Sodome, against our lawlesse lusts; that of Caine,
against our enuie; that of Zenacharib, against our arrogancie; that
fire of Gods wrath which consumed those that called for Quailes, against our
Gluttonie; that of the Israelites early rising vp to gather Manna, against our
sloathfulnesse; that punishment occasioned by the golden Calfe, against our
Idolatrie: So that It is Feare that keepes the Vineyard safe. This is
that hedge wherewith it is compassed; this, that strong wall of defence; and
this, the surest obseruance of the Law. It is said in Deutronomie, Si
custodieris Praecepta mea, ipsa custodient te, If thou shalt keepe my
Commandements, they shall keepe thee. And in Ecclesiasticus, Si
seruaueris, seruabunt te.
               
                  Iudith 5.21.
               Achior chiefe Captaine to the sonnes of Ammon, notified this
truth to Holofernes; If this people haue kept the Laws &amp;
commandements of their God, let my Lord passe by, lest their Lord defend them,
and their God bee for them, and wee become a reproch to all the World: For
assure your selfe, as long as they shall serue him, he will serue as a Wall
vnto them.
            Where it is to be noted, That as in a Wall there must not be any
breach,God accepteth not a peece-meale obedience.
because thereby Cities commonly come to be lost; so likewise must there not
bee any breach in the obseruance of the Law: for the transgression of one
Commandement will serue to condemne thee, as well as of the whole Decalogue;
and the failing in one vertue is the failing in all.
                  Cant. 7.2. 
               Thy bellie is as an heape of Wheat
compassed about with Lillies: The dangers are numberlesse that threaten
this heape of wheat in the threshing floore; Creditors, Theeues, Beasts, Birds,
and Pismires: But far more in number are those dangers that threaten our
Soule; those vertues which are to stand round about her, must guard and defend
her; Circundate Syon, &amp; complectimini eam.
            
            
               Et Sepe circumdedit eam.
               
                  And he compassed it about with a hedge.
                  The feare of the Lord a strong defence. Hee had no sooner
  planted his Vineyard, but he compassed it about with an Hedge: To shew vnto
  vs, That when a man hath once setled himselfe, his house, his wife, his
  children, and his familie, he ought presently to compasse it in with a Wal;
  which Wal must be, the Feare of God, and the keeping of his Lawes. It must be
  like Salomons bed,
                     Cant. 3.7. which
  had threescore strong men round about it, of the valiant men of Israell, such
  as could handle the Sword, and were expert in warre; euerie one hauing his
  sword vpon his thigh, for the Feare by night, Propter timores
  nocturnos. Admonishing vs to keepe good watch and ward; so many, and so
  secret are those perills that attend vs, that without the protection of God and
  his Angels, we shall hardly be able to defend our selues. Saint Paul
  sayes of himselfe, Gratia Dei, sum id quod sum, By the grace of God I am
  that I am. Whereunto Saint Augustine hath added, Gratia Dei,
  non sum id quod non sum, By the grace of God I am not that which I am not.
  By the grace of God, thy house and thy lands may continue to thee and thy
  posterity  to the worlds end; &amp; by the grace of God,
  thy eyes may abstaine from that which is euill. Totus mundus in maligno
  positus est, All the world is set vpon mischiefe; The world is a
  continuall warre, a long inlarged temptation. And Saint Ambrose calls
  it Piraterium, A Sea fraught with Pirats: For (as Saint
  Augustine saith) therein there is nothing safe. In Paradice, the
  forbidden Fruit, nor the Tree of Life were not secure; and therefore God placed
  a Cherubin before the gate, to gard it the surer. Salomon had not his
  bed-chamber safe, though it were garded with so many strong men: How shall it
  be with that house then that is without walls or any defence at all? Vbi
  non est saepes, diripietur possessio, (saith Ecclesiasticus) A
  Vineyard that is without a Mount, giue it for lost.
            
            
               Edificauit Turrim.
               
                  He built a Tower in it. This Tower Origen and
  Saint Hierome vnderstand to be the Temple of Ierusalem, which was
  built in a high place. Irenaeus would haue it to be the same Citie
  whereof Esay said, Venite, ascendamus ad montem Domini. Saint
  Ambrose and Saint Hilarie, The heigth of the Law. Others,
  that place where the fruits of the Vineyard were to be kept, Abundantia in
  Turribus tuis. Other Schoolemen and Doctors take it to be the Churches
  Beacon or Watch-Tower: Others, to be our Faith, whose sight extends it selfe to
  earth, heauen, and hell. There is nothing that imports the World more, than the
  eyes of this Tower. Some seeking out the principall cause of the Worlds
  perdition, say, Couetousnesse is the root thereof; Radix omnium malorum
  cupiditas. Others, Ignorance; alledging that of the Phylosopher,
  Omnis peccans, est Ignorans. But the truth is, it is the want of
  Faith.
            
            
               Et fodit in ea Torcular.
               
                  What is vnderstood by the
 winepresse
                  He digged a Pit for the Winepresse. By this pit of
  the Winepresse, Origen and Saint Hierome vnderstand, the
  Sacrifice of our Sauiours bodie and bloud: Saint Hilarie, The Crosse
  of Christ: Saint Gregorie, The chastisement of Hierusalem. The Owner
  of this Vineyard had made it so perfect and so absolute, that the Renters
  thereof liued in a manner idle, and had little or nothing more to do, than to
  keepe it cleane from Thornes, and to gather and enioy the Fruits thereof:
  wherin this Master of a family shewed the great care he had of his house,
  treating therein touching mans good, &amp; the slight account that man made of
  this his happinesse and felicitie.The cost which Christ was
 at with his Vineyard. When God created the World, he tooke not vpon him
  the name of an Husbandman; nor did he take any paines in the creating of it,
  for he but sayd the word, and it was done, Ipse dixit, &amp; facta
  sunt. But this Vineyard of the Church, it cost him the paines of planting
  it, of compassing it in with a hedge, of digging a pit for the Winepresse, of
  building a Tower in it, besides the life of many of his seruants, as also of
  him, Quem acquisiuit sanguine suo. This was a new Noah, with
  whom that former old Noah was not to bee compared: For that, giuing
  an end to a yong world, though grown old in sin, destroyed the people, but not
  their wickednesse; but this did vtterly ouerthrow the Kingdome of sinne,
  drowning it in the floud of his bloud, and gaue the first beginning to the
  life of Grace.
               
                  The firmnesse of the ChurchWhence
  followeth the firmenesse and perpetuitie of the Church; for, being founded vpon
  so sure a Foundation, who can ouerthrow it? Supra dorsum meum fabricauerunt
  peccatores, [Another letter hath it, Arauerunt aratores] The
  Ploughers ploughed furrowes on my backe. Alluding to that which was then
  in vse for signing  out the scituation and circuit of
  some Citie. Romulus tooke that course when he founded Rome.
               — Vrbem signauit aratro: — So sayes the
  Poet. Whom Saint Augustine also citeth. But this Citie, which hath on
  the one side Heauen for it's prop, and on the other, the shoulders of our
  Sauiour Christ; What firmenesse and prosperitie must it enioy? And onely
  because Christ doth cherish &amp; water it, not only with his own most pretious
  bloud, but with that of so many Martyrs. Plutarch reporteth, That
  those of Eliopolis dranke no wine, beeing persuaded, that wine was the bloud of
  those Gyants which made warre against Heauen, of whose bodies beeing buried in
  the earth, sprang your Vines. And therefore when Alexander dranke much
  wine, Antocides would say vnto him, I pray Sir consider that yee
  drinke the bloud of the earth. These are all lies, yet may very well suit with
  this our truth; for wee are to vnderstand, That the Vines of the Faithfull
  sprang and grew vp from the bloud of that Gyant, of whom Dauid said,
  Exultauit vt Gygas adcurrendam viam. For that Morall, That the
  sprinkling of the bloud of those two Louers should giue colour &amp; ripenes to
  the Fruit, is a meere fable; but that the bloud of our Sauiour Christ should so
  season these wild Vines, as to make them to bring forth aboundance of fruit, is
  a knowne truth. Whence it is to be noted, that whither it be that these Vines
  do represent the faithful; or whither or no, because the wine thereof is turned
  into the bloud of our Sauiour Christ, the Deuill beares so great a hatred to
  the sprigs and branches of the Vine, that there is not any thing that your
  Witches abhorre &amp; stand more in feare of. As you may read in Petrus
  Gregorius, in his Bookes De Republica. Plutarch saith, That your
  Vinestockes being watred with wine, drie and wither away: But the Vines of the
  Faithfull being besprinkled with the wine of the bloud of Christ, grow vp and
  fructifie the better. Vinum germinans Virgines; it ingendreth noble
  thoughts. The Poet inuites Aeneas, and calls vnto him in this sweet
  kind of language, Sate sanguine Diuum: But more noblenesse doth a
  Christian enioy in that Sate sanguine Christi. Seneca saith, That the
  noblenesse of bloud eleuateth our thoughts. And God saith by the mouth of
  Hose, That if the Israelites shall returne vnto him, that they shall
  flourish as the Vine,
                     Ose 14.8. and the sent
  thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
               With the firmenesse of the Church sutes that fable of
  Atlas, who vpheld heauen with his shoulders; but when
  Hercules saw he began to groane vnder so great a burthen, he came in
  to helpe him: yet for all this was not Heauen safe, vnderpropped by his
  shoulders. But the Edifice of the Church, bore vp by our Sauiour Christ, shall
  continue for euer. Erumpet radix eius, vt Libani stabilietur. An
  Interpreter vpon this place of Osee, saith, It shall stand as firme as
  the Root of Mount Lebanon, which shall take such a deepe rooting, that all the
  Deuils in hel shall not preuaile against it.
            
            
               Locauit Agricolis.
               
                  He let it out to husbandmen. God is the onely true Lord
  of this Vineyard,All that we inioy in this Life is an
 others wealth, and we haue but the vse of it. the rest are but Farmers
  and Renters. Philon prooueth, That all of vs in this life enioy but
  another bodies wealth; and that wee haue the vse thereof, but not the
  proprietie. Saint Chrysostome, That (saith he) is myne, which no man
  can take from me; &amp; in this sence, neither is my life, nor my wealth, nor
  my health, mine owne, &amp;c. Our life (saith Cicero) God hath onely
  lent it vs, without appointing any set place of payment, which he may demaund
  of vs at what time it pleaseth him. And so in the rest, wee dayly find the like
  experience. Your Emperours  (saith Horace) we
  call, Rerum terrenarum Dominos, Lords of the earth. But this is but
  mans flatterie; for they haue not the true dominion of these earthly things,
  but onely the vse of them. And hence was it that our Sauiour Christ did infer,
  Si in alieno infideles fuistis, quod vestrum est, Quis credet vobis?
  If yee were vnfaithfull in that wealth, honour, health, and beautie, which are
  anothers goods, Who will relie vpon the loue of your good will, which is your
  owne? Saint Paul teacheth vs this Lesson, Qui gaudent, tanquam
  non gaudentes; qui flent, tanquam non flentes; Those that reioyce, let them
  reioyce as though they did not reioyce; and those that weepe, let them weepe as
  though they did not weepe. For, on strange occasions, and such as belong
  to other men, we ought not to bee ouertaken with too much either griefe or
  joy. Thou goest to see the Kings or Queenes Almoneda, or either of
  their Iewell-houses: doe not thou joy much therein, for those riches are none
  of thine, and thou must of force presently forgoe them: And therefore
  Philon saith, That the goods of this life are anothers, not ours, and
  that wee doe but onely rent them ad voluntatem Domini, At the will and
  pleasure of the Lord. Touching the disasters of this world,
  Epictetus saith, Doe not say, I haue lost such a thing; for it is an
  improper kind of language; but rather say, I haue returned it backe againe:
  and from this ignorance growes our melanchollie. Seneca tells vs, That
  he that will not be content that God should be sole Lord of all, is vniust. He
  that thinkes himselfe wronged, when a man askes him that which he hath lent
  him, is a couetous wretch. He that esteeming a present good, is forgetful of a
  former receiued curtesie, is an vngrateful wretch. And he that returning backe
  those goods into his masters hands, which he had committed to his keeping, shal
  not think himself rid of a great care, &amp; more secure than before, is a
  foolish wretch. In the creation of all the rest of the things, Genesis
  vseth the name of God alone by it selfe; but when man comes to be made, it puts
  this adiunct of Dominus Deus, the Lord God; because man should not
  imagine that there was any other Lord that should be able to bring them into
  the Land of Promise, saue the Lord God. And therefore God saith, I will goe
  before yee, and I will leade yee the way; That they might not attribute this
  enterprise to their owne valour.
               
                  Locauit Agricolis. God rented out this his Vineyard,
  looking to receiue some fruit thereof. As in Paradice there was not that Tree
  that was barren· [Ex omni ligno quod est in Paradiso
  comede,
                  
                     Gen. 2.16. 
                  Thou shalt freely
  eat of euery tree of the Garden.] So, in the Paradice of the Church no
  Tree ought to be without it's Fruit. Dauid compareth the Iust,
                     Psal. 1. to a Tree that is planted by the Riuer
  side, Quod fructum suum dabit in tempore suo, That will bring forth it's
  fruit in due season; that is, alwaies: Like vnto that of the
  Apocalyps,
                  
                     Apoc. 22. which gaue
  fruit euerie moneth. In Deutronomie God commanded, That they should
  plant no woods nor groues: not that the Spirit of God meant thereby, that all
  Forrests &amp; Parkes should be condemned, wherein Kings and Princes were to
  take their pleasure; but that in the Church there should not be any
  vnprofitable Trees, and without fruit.
               
                  Why God rented
 
                        •
                     ut his Vineyard to the
 vngrateful
                  He let it out to Husbandmen. The Lord knowing that
  these Renters would prooue vnthankfull, why did he let out his Vineyard vnto
  them? Why did hee likewise cast three parts of his seed into those grounds
  which were not to affoord him any Fruit? And why did that Father giue that his
  prodigal Sonne his portion, to spend and consume it in riotousnesse and
  wantonnesse? Why (saith Phylon) should God suffer his raine to fall
  into the sea, for to bring forth Fountaines in those Desarts whereas yet the
  foot of man did neuer tread? Why, co
                     •
                  
                  ferre riches on those who were to maintaine quarrells and brawles
  therewith?  And why let out his Vineyard to him who
  should shut him out of his owne Inheritance, keepe possession against him, and
  take his life from him?
               First of all, Because Seneca saith, That for a Prince
  to conferre a fauour, which to his seeming is well bestowed, and to lose it
  afterwards through the ingratitude of the receiuer, is a token of a generous
  mind: For to this perill are they put, and all whosoeuer runne this hazard, who
  doe any courtesies in this life. For a forgetfull and vnthankfull man doth
  commonly shew himselfe vnmindfull of the good which he receiueth: But for a
  Prince to doe a fauor where he knowes it shall be lost, and that his kindnesse
  is but cast away, this is Kingly magnificence, and a generous kind of
  noblenesse. And of this kind are commonly Gods fauours, who although we shew
  our selues vnthankefull, and do not acknowledge these his fauours, yet he
  dayly throwes them vpon vs, that hee may thereby manifest both his greatnesse
  and his goodnesse.
               Secondly, Phylon saith, That he doth prosper the
  Vnthankefull, to draw them thereby to his seruice.
               First, Because there are no gyues nor fetters that tye a man so
  fast, as benefits, or make him more a prisoner; Qui beneficia inuenit,
  compedes inuenit. This is that which Ose saith, In funiculis
  Adam traham eos: The Hebrew hath it,
                     Ose.
 11.4. 
                  In funiculis hominum, I led them with cords of a man,
  euen with bonds of loue. Bulls are made tame, and yeeld themselues to a fiue
  twisted cord; Horses are made gentle with bridles and with chaines; and mens
  hearts are woon with benefits; Qui coronat te in misericordia, &amp; in
  miserationibus. God hath compassed thee in with so many mercies, and hath
  bound thee so fast vnto him, in the bonds of his louing kindnesse, that thou
  knowest not which way to get from him. Ioseph beeing obliged to his
  master by the many fauors that he had receiued from him, said,
                     Gen. 39.9. 
                  Quomodo possum? How can I then doe
  this great wickednesse? How is it possible that I should shew my selfe
  such a Villaine to him, who knoweth not what hee hath in the house with me, but
  hath committed all that he hath to me; neither hath hee kept any thing from me
  but onely thee, because thou art his wife.
               Secondly, Because there is no other meanes comparable vnto this,
  That a Prince should deliuer vp all the world to such a mans seruice, and that
  he should extend his liberalitie to an vnknowne and vnthankefull people: And to
  this end he affoords his enemies water, and the fruits of the earth, and other
  temporall blessings, that therby they might take occasion to serue him. And if
  he bestow so many fauours vpon an vngratefull people, and if he haue care of
  the beasts of the forrest, what kindnesses will he shew vnto them that shall
  truly serue him.
            
            
               
                  Locauit Agricolis. Hee let it out to
  Husbandmen.
               To husbandmen, that know what belong to this businesse;
  For,Ignorant &amp; sluggish Prelats the destruction of
 Gods Vineyard. of no people in the world, doth Gods vineyard suffer so
  much harme, as of ignorant Prelats, that doe not know how to prune, and to
  dresse it. And sloathfulnesse of all other, is most hurtfull in this kind. For
  thereupon, it growes presently full of Briers, Thistles, and Thornes; and the
  hedges goe to decay, the mounds are broken downe, and the wilde Bores, the
  Foxes, and the Dogges enter into it. carelesnesse likewise is very hurtfull
  thereunto; for by that means, all that go by (as Dauid sayth) plucke
  of her Grapes. Thou broughtest a vine out of Aegypt,
                     Psal. 80. thou didst cast out the Heathen, and
  planted it. Thou madest roome for it; and when it had taken roote, it filled
  the land. The hills were couered with the shadow of it, and the boughes
  thereof were like the goodly Cedar trees. She stretcheth out her branches vnto
  the Sea, &amp; her boughes vnto the Riuer. Why hast  thou
  then broken downe her hedge, that all they which goe by plucke off her
  Grapes?The ignorāce of the Priest, the ruine of the
 People. the wilde Boare out of the wood doth root it vp, and the wilde
  Beasts of the field deuour it. Behold, and visite this vine, ô Lord, and
  the place of the vineyard, that thine owne right hand hath planted; and the
  branches that thou madest strong for thy selfe. It is burnt with fire, and cut
  downe, &amp;c. But these, &amp; such other faults, may be mended; but
  ignorance, can neuer be repaired. If the Renter know not how &amp; when he
  ought to prune the vine, to loosen the earth about the rootes, and to plant
  it, &amp;c. it will quickly go to ruine. It is a great vnhappinesse, that for
  to make thy shooes, thou wilt inquire out the best shooe-maker; And for to
  gouerne a Commonwealth, which is Ars artium, The Art of Arts; thou
  shalt thinke a Cobler fit enough to doe it.Gods Vineyard
 must not be turned into a garden. There are many reasons, why a Prince
  should make Noblemen, and Gentlemen, Presidents, and Prelates. But to weigh
  downe this, there is another great counter-poise. For being bred vp daintily
  from their cradle, some of them make gardens of this Vineyard; others houses of
  pleasure. Naboth made choyce rather to dye, than to part with his
  Vineyard to the King; because he would not see it turned to a garden; for to
  that end onely did he desire it. Shall my inheritance (sayd he) with the fruit
  whereof my house is maintained, bee turned into a garden, for a tyrant to
  sport himselfe therein? God would take it very heauily, to see the Vineyard,
  which hee bought with his bloud, to bee, by some gentleman-like Prelate, turned
  into a greene Court: especially, hauing layd such a greeuous curse on those
  Husbandmen, that shall not looke well vnto it, as Regiones vestras alieni
  deuorant, &amp;c.
               
               
                  Hee let it out to Husbandmen. Locare, is a word of
  Espousall, or Marriage; and it sutes well with that Loue and Zeale, which a
  Prelat ought to haue to the Vine, his Spouse. To this marriage, the interest of
  Wealth, the respect of Honour, nor the pleasures of this Life, must not mooue
  him; but the good only of the Vine, and the desire he hath to take paines
  therein, till, like salt in water himselfe shall wast away and consume. He that
  enters vpon Gods patrimony, must enter thereupon with a far different end to
  that, which he doth, who enters vpon that of the King; for this (commonly)
  makes his owne priuate benefit the marke whereat he aymes: But the Prelat, must
  make another mans profit, the pinne which hee must hit. The Minister of a King,
  takes a lesser charge first vpon him, that it may serue as a step to greater
  preferment: But a Prelat must not marry himselfe to the Church vpon hope to
  meet with a better benefice the next day after. Spospon
                        •
                      enim vos vni viro, Virginem castam
  exhibere Christo. Many Prelats seeme vnto me to be like vnto those seuen
  husbands, which were espoused to one woman, who in that other life was wife to
  none of them all. So (putting the case the other way) let me aske you, (as
  those other did our Sauiour) when seuen Churches shall bee married to one
  Prelat, which of those shall be sayd to bee his wife in that other Life.
               
                  He planted a Vineyard, and let it out to Husbandmen.
  Saint Bernard sayth, Vi
                        ••
                      sapienti,
                  Euery mans soule is a vineyard
 to him selfe, and he must dresse it 
                  sua vita vinea est, &amp; sua
  Conscientia. To a wise man, his own life, and conscience, is a Vineyard.
  So that, not onely the Church is called a Vine, but euerie mans particular
  Soule, may also be immagined to be a stocke of this Vine. And that for three
  principall conueniences.
               
                  The hasard wherunto the Vine-yard of the
 soule is exposed.First, In regard of the great ha
                     •
                  arads which the Vine runneth, as frosts, haile, wormes,
  want of water, carelesnesse of him that keepes the Vineyard, theeues, dogges,
  boares, foxes, and enemies, such as H
                        •
                     lofernes commanded to take away the waters from those of
  Bethulia. But farre greater perils than these doth ma
                     •
                  s Soule passe through; as those frosts, that nip it
  through default of Charitie;  those haile-stones of our
  sinnes, which beat it downe to the Earth, that it can hardly rise againe; those
  Deuils, which like the children of Esau, and gouernours of the people
  of Moab, cry, Exinanite, exinanite, persequimini, &amp; comprehendite
  eam. And the carelesnesse that is had in pruning it. Saint
  Bernard saith, That the naturall Vine will aske but once pruning; but
  the metaphoricall Vine, a thousand prunings; because euerie foot, new buds,
  and new sprigs of vices begin to sprout vp in it; being subiect (as Saint
  Paul saith) periculis in mari, periculis in terra, to perills by
  sea, and perills by land, &amp;c.
               
               Secondly, There is not any Plant, whose Fruit doth more liuely
  represent the essence of our nature. The Flower of the Vine represents vnto vs
  our childhood; the beautie thereof, it's peaceablenesse, it's prettinesse,
  it's wittinesse, it's pleasingnesse, it's innocencie: The sharpenesse and
  sourenesse thereof beeing greene, our youths hardnesse, harshnesse, tartnesse,
  and vnseasonablenesse. The Grape it selfe growne to perfection, the sweet,
  sauourie, discreet, and ripe yeares of our life, whereof that wine is made
  which glads the heart of man, and washes away care. In the Raysons, which by
  the heat of the Sunne proouing both sauorie and wholesome, serue for physicke,
  is our old age represented vnto vs; which ought to be the Antidote of youth. It
  is that discourse which doth aduice vs, that we ought not to despaire of our
  tart and distastefull youthfulnesse; for the greene and soure Grape comes not
  onely to be a ripe one, but turnes also to be a Rayson; and your young wild
  Lads come not onely to be stayd and well gouernd men, but proue likewise graue,
  wise, &amp; antient old Senators in the commonwealth. Themistocles
  was such a young lewd fellow, that his father did disinherite him, and his
  mother for verie griefe hung her selfe; yet it was his fortune afterwards to
  come to be a most valiant Captaine, and to prooue a most prudent Gouernour.
  The like hapned to Alcibiades, and to Apolemon, (so saith
  Valerius Maximus) and to Iulius Caesar (as
  Fulgosius reporteth it vnto vs.) Aristotle (according vnto
  Aelian) in his younger yeares played away all his Patrimonie; he
  followed the warres; he found that that course did not fit well with him, hee
  turnes Apothecarie, frequents the Schooles, and prooues in the end the Prince
  of Phylosophers.
               Thirdly, All sorts of Trees, be they barren or fruitfull,The vine hath no bounds, no more hath the will of man. they
  haue their naturall heigth and bredth, either more or lesse, according to
  their seuerall kindes; your Pines and your Cedars are the tallest of all
  others; your Wallnuts round like a Cup, and more spredding at the top: In a
  word, euerie one hath his conuenient stature and proportion. But the Vine hath
  no determinate either heigth or bredth; if you let it alone, it will traile
  vpon the ground, &amp; so the fruit thereof rot vpon the earth; if you let it
  leane vnto a pole, it will runne vp to the top thereof; if to an Elme, it will
  creepe vp to the highest boughes; if to a wall, it will runne and shoot it
  selfe along, till it hath claspt it in it's armes, and quite ouerspred it. And
  this is the verie Image and true stampe of man; for, all liuing beasts and
  other creatures whatsoeuer, hauing their termes and bounds of augmentation,
  which they may not passe and exceed; Man, through his free wil, fauoured and
  assisted by Grace, doth enioy so great an excellencie, that hee can by the
  helpe thereof leaue behind him the highest Mountaines, reaching by
  participation, to Gods owne Beeing and abiding. And though he cannot shoot vp
  thus high of himselfe, (beeing no better than a sillie Worme of the earth) yet
  being raised vp by Grace, he may climbe vp to this happinesse,The spouse compared to the vine. Cant. 8.5. and
  flourish for euer in that eternall and glorious Paradise of Heauen. The
  Holy-Ghost hath compared the Spouse to a Wall, &amp; her brests, to the
  branches of the Vine, which  goe clasping and compassing
  the same about. And in another place the Angells aske, Who is this that
  commeth vp out of the Wildernesse, leaning vpon her Welbeloued? Yee need
  not wonder so much at it, for it is the Vine, which desereth to be ioyned in
  perpetuall loue with Christ; and hauing so good a prop, it cannot but reach to
  the highest part of Heauen. In a word, Thou maist, ô Lord, mold man like
  a peece of waxe; if thou wilt, thou canst make a Deuill of him, as thou didst
  of Iudas; and if thou wilt, thou canst make an Angell of him, as thou
  didst of Iohn Baptist: Thou canst make a just man mount aboue the
  Clouds, and to sore vp to the highest part of Heauen; And on the contrarie,
  thou canst maxe a sinner to sinke downe as low as the deepest dungeon in
  Hell.
            
            
               Peregrè profectus est.
               
                  Gods absence from vs, is nothing else but
 his conniuing at our sinnes.
                  And he went into a strange
  Countrie. When the Scripture saith, That God sleepeth, or is afarre off,
  it is (according to Saint Basil) a reciprocall kinde of Language. Nor
  are we thereby to vnderstand, that God either sleepeth, or is farre off,
  For he is neuer farre from any of vs; but it is thou that art farre
  off, and it is thou that sleepest, when thou doost depart from such a Citie, or
  when going to sea, thou leauest the land; it being thou that leauest the land,
  and not the land thee; for that remaines still immooueable. Iust so stands the
  case between God and thee; but is befitting his authoritie, to behold things as
  if they were afarre off; for in the notifying of his presence, the World in one
  day would be turned quite topsi-turuie. This made him say vnto Moses,
  It is not fit that I should lead forth this People, and be their Captaine &amp;
  Commander; for their impudencies would oblige me to make an end of them at
  once. For such is the wickednesse of this World, that it is as vnable, as
  vnfitting to abide his presence: And therefore absenting himselfe, he saith,
  Peregrè profectus est. Hee doth beare with our iniquities, he
  doth patiently expect our amendment, hee doth dissemble his displeasure, and
  doth make as if he did not see what we did. From whence grow these two
  inconueniences:
               
                   
                     From Gods conniuence growes our presum
                           •
                        tion, and his seuerity. 
                     Gods wrath the longer deferred, the fiercer.
                  The
  one, Our boldnesse and presumption; It will be long ere my Lord will
  come. And this false presumption makes a naughtie seruant carelesse and
  negligent; Because I held my peace and said nothing, and for that I seemed
  not to see them, the wicked haue forgot that there is a God.
               
               The other, The rigour and seueritie of the punishment wherewith
  God doth recompence this his slackenesse and long tarrying. Saint
  Gregorie compares the wrath of God to a Bow, which the more it is
  bent, the stronger it shoots it's Shaft. He may vnbend it for a time, butthat
  is but to make the draught the stronger, when he takes it againe into his
  hand. Excitatus est tanquam dormiens Dominus, tanquam potens crapulatus
  à Vino, &amp; percussit inimicos in posteriora. Hee compares him
  here to a sleeping man, and one that hath dranke hard; who if hee bee valiant,
  and a stout man in deed, if his enemies make a May-game of him in his sleepe,
  and offer to abuse him, they were as good awake a sleeping Lyon; for he no
  sooner opens his eyes, but he presently takes notice of their ill dealing
  towards him; and when he hath once rowsed vp himselfe, vents his choller, and
  executes his vengeance.
               
                  He went to trauell. Hence grew the mischiefe of these
  Renters; for they thought with themselues, That their Lord being gone into a
  farre Countrie, 
                     •
                   would be long
  before he would return to require these his Fruits. So that al ou
                     •
                   hurt proceeds from our presuming, that
  we shall liue so long, that we may laugh and be merrie as long as our youth
  lasteth, &amp; afterwards haue time enough to repent  at
  leisure. The Sinner he complaines of the shortnesse of his life, Nos nati
  fere statim desiuimus esse, We are no sooner borne, but wee are cut downe and
  gone. The righteous man complaines, That his pilgrimage heere vpon Earth
  is too long; He
                        •
                      mihi, quia
  incolatus meus prolongatus est. But the truth is, That thou makest thy
  life short, by being forgetfull of the end for which it was giuen thee. God
  gaue it thee to gaine Heauen, and thou mispendest it in worldly businesses; so
  that though life be little, the losse is much. If thou beest borne to be rich,
  honourable, and much made of, thou wouldst thinke the yeares of thy life to
  bee but a few, in regard of the great desire that thou hast to enioy those thy
  earthly blessings: But if thou beest borne for Heauen, Who will say that he
  wants time (though he liue but a few yeares) to prepare himselfe for that
  journey. From the Cradle many young innocent Babes haue beene borne vp to
  Heauen, and yet their yeares are neuer a whit the lesse, but the more. And
  some, the more yeres they haue, the more is their hurt: For, that day (saith S.
  Gregory) thou must reckon amongst those of thy life, which thou
  foundest did make for thy Souleshealth.
               
                  He went to trauell. Not to forget his Vine, for that
  was alwayes before his eys;Trust is euer the surest
 tye. but for to shew the great trust &amp; confidence that he had in
  these his Farmers and Renters, and to oblige them thereby the more vnto him:
  For that lord that trusts little, ties a man the lesse. When God had deliuered
  ouer Paradise vnto Adam, and quietly seated him in the peaceable
  possession of it, it is said, That he forthwith vanished and went his way. Hee
  that is Master of an estate, hath not his eye continually vpon his seruants,
  for that would fauour more of a tyrant than a master. That husband that alwayes
  stayes at home, and neuer goes out of his house, is extreame wearisome to his
  wife; but if he begin once to mistrust her, peraduenture she will not sticke to
  giue him iust canse so to doe. That Prelat which is alwayes gagging and
  pricking the sides of his subiects, is an intollerable burthen: And
  Dauid himselfe complaines thereof, saying, Imposuisti hominem
  super Capita nostra.
                  
                     Luke. 19. Math.
                     
                        •
                     5. Saint Luke and
  Saint Mathew cite two Parables, of Masters that did recommend to their
  seruants the charge of their house and of their wealth; and say, That presently
  thereupon they absented themselues, and went into farre and remote
  Countries.
               
                  El que fia mucho, obliga mucho; He that trusteth much,
  obligeth much. Ioseph held himselfe so much bound vnto his master, in
  that he trusted him with all that he had; that he said, being tempted by his
  Mistresse, Quomodo possum peccare contra Dominum meum, How can I prooue
  such a villaine to my Master, as to wrong him in his Loue, who hath loued
  me so well? Saint Paul writes to Timothie,
                  1. Tim. 2.7. That he thought himselfe exceedingly
  bound to the seruice of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, that he had ordained him a
  Preacher, and an Apostle, and a Teacher of the Gentiles, in Faith and veritie;
  and that he had trusted him with the ministrie and defence of his Church,
  being that he had persecuted and blasphemed him heretofore. Young
  Tobias said vnto the Angell Raphael, Albeit I should spend
  all my life in thy seruice, yet should I not satisfie that obligation which I
  haue to serue thee. These are the respects of noble brests; and he that shall
  thinke vpon these things truly, may consider with himselfe, how much greater
  benefits &amp; fauours he hath receiued from Gods hands.
               
                  He went into a farre Countrie. He got him away to
  Heauen, where (for the loue which he beares to his Vine) he thinkes himselfe a
  stranger. The Disciples which went to Emaus said vnto him, Tusolus
  peregrinus in Ierusalem? Art thou only a stranger in Ierusalem? Wherein
  they spake truer than they were aware of▪ calling him by the name of
  Stranger, when as hee was now glorified: For, as  long as
  he liued here vpon earth, he was contented for our sakes to be a stranger in
  heauen. And though hee himselfe were in heauen, yet his Spouse was on earth. O
  Lord, where then art thou? Where I would bee; there where my Spouse is. Vbi
  thesaurus, ibi cor, Where a mans treasure is, there also is his heart.
  Nazianzen cals vs, The Riches of God▪ And this (saith he) we are to
  esteeme as a singular fauour, Quia nos pro diuitijs suis habet, That he
  will vouchsafe vs so much honor as to account vs his Riches. And we are
  not onely his Riches, but his Delight and Recreation: Et delitiae meae esse
  cum filijs hominum, I made it my pleasure, to remaine among the children of
  men: Though my head were rounded with Starres, and circled about with a
  Crowne of infinite Glorie; yet did I humble my thoughts as low as Man. And here
  are we to ponder on the particle Et: And if Kings haue a care of their
  Parkes, and make great reckoning of their Gardens and houses of pleasure, for
  that they are their entertainment and recreation; How much more ought God to
  esteeme of his Vine, holding it to bee his Riches, his Pleasure, and
  Delight?
            
            
               Cum autem tempus Fructum appropinquaret, misit Seruos vt
  acciperent Fructus.
               
                  When the time of the Vintage was at hand, he sent his
  Seruants to the husbandmen, to receiue the fruits thereof. Here you see,
  how he did wait til the season that this his Vineyard was fit to yeeld him
  Fruit, and that the time of the Vintage drew neere: Not before; for it were
  meere tyrannie, to demand that which is not yet due vnto thee. Nor after; for
  so a Lord may runne the hazard of loosing his Fruits, vnlesse his Farmer be the
  honester man. Euery Plant hath it's due time and season to yeeld it's Fruit;
  and albeit our season bee the whole terme of our life, yet there are some
  seasons so precise, that not to giue Fruit therein, is held to be a wonderfull
  bad signe.

                        •
                     . God commanded his People, That when they came to inioy
  the Land of Promise, they should offer vnto him of the first of all the fruit
  of the earth. This was a strict and precise occasion in them, and in vs, as oft
  as we begin to enioy Gods fauours and blessings towards vs. And this conceit is
  comprehended in this verie Parable which is here deliuered vnto vs.
               
                  Euery man may claim the fruit of his owne
 labors.
                  To receiue the Fruits thereof. And here first of all it
  is to bee noted, That in this he did not doe them any wrong in the World. What
  wrong doth that man doe to a Vineyard, that hath planted and pruned it, if he
  at the time of it's Fr
                     ••
                  t require
  Grapes? What wrong doth the Pope to the Cardinall, the Bishop, and the Chanon;
  or the King, to his Minister; or the Generall, to his Frier, to craue of them,
  That they shall complie with their Obligations; especially if the Superiour
  comply as he ought with his? Who planted this Vineyard? Who hedged it about?
  Who made a Winepresse therein? Who built a Tower to it? The husbandmen? No, it
  was God: Is it much then, that hee should looke for the Fruits thereof?
               Secondly, God herein did them a great and singular fauour: For
  Saint Paul saith,God requireth nothing at our
 hands, but what is for our owne good. That these Fruits are Loue, Ioy,
  Peace, Long suffering, Gentlenesse, Goodnesse, Faith, Meekenesse, and
  Temperance. And being these are the Fruits that we should bring forth, yet hee
  is pleased to call them his Fruits; for in all our actions he principally
  desireth our good and our profit: God being equally honoured in punishing the
  Bad,
                     Iob. 35 7. as in rewarding the Good.
  If thou be righteous, what giuest thou vnto him, or what receiueth he
  at thyne hand? What addest thou to his glorie? (saith Iob and
  Thomas) for if he desires our praises, our thanksgiuings, and our
  seruices, he doth not so much pretend therein his owne glorie, as our 
   good; for he is fulnesse of Glorie it selfe. But by
  praising and seruing of him, we acknowledge him to be our God, and therein
  submit our selues to his diuine will, whereby we come to receiue a great
  reward. Saint Augustine saith, That when we make vowes and promises
  vnto God, he commaunds vs strictly to performe them, not because that he hath
  any need that we should fulfill them, but because in f
                     •
                  lfilling of them, we shall reape the fruit of them; and
  the more we giue vnto God, the more still we haue. Benignus exactor est,

  For what we render vnto him, he renders it backe to vs with aduantage.
               
               
                  To receiue the Fruits thereof. The griefe of it was,
  That he sonding his Seruants at the time of it's Fruit, they could scarce
  finde a bunch in all the Vineyard, they were not able to gleane any thing out
  of it. Non est botrus ad commedendum, saith Micheas, My
  Soule desired the first ripe Fruits; but,
                     Micah.
 7.1. 
                  there is no cluster to eat; Perijt sanctus de terra, The good
  man is perished out of the earth, and there is none righteous among men.
  In a place that is generally infected, you shal scarce find a sound man; so
  likewise in this Vine, be it in the Law Naturall, in the Law Written, or in the
  Law of Grace, you shall hardly meet with good Fruit. For to meet with a good
  and righteous man, you must looke and looke againe: first, search this, and
  then that other Stocke; and when you haue done all ye can doe, in stead of
  sweet grapes, you shall gather those that are soure; and in stead of wine, haue
  the gall of Dragons, and the poyson of Aspes.
               But some perhaps will say,
                     Ob.
                  
  That the husbandmen were not able to affoord their Lord any Fruits thereof, for
  that they were rented too high,God is no racking
 Landlord. the ground was out of heart, and that they had beene too much
  grated vpon. Many Princes, I confesse, doe so wring their Subiects with such
  intollerable Taxes &amp; payments, and such strange and vnwoonted Impositions,
  that they destroy and make wast the Lands of their Kingdomes: The like may be
  said of many landlords towards their Tenants. But hereunto I answer,
                     Sol.
                   That God is quite contrarie to these; for
  making ouer the possession of Paradice vnto Adam, so rich and
  plentifull of all sorts of Fruits and Trees, hee reserued no more than one
  onely Tree to himselfe: Hee will giue vnto thee the whole sheafes of Corne,
  contenting himselfe onely with those few Eares which are shattered and left
  behind in the Stubble: He will suffer thee to gather all the grapes, and to
  make a full Vintage, so that thou wilt but let him gleane the refuse bunches,
  which will but spoyle thy Wine. Of him that hath two Coats, the Euangelist
  requires one; but Christ will bee content to take one of ten; [Quod

  that which thou maist verie well spare. In the old Law, for an acknowledgement
  of those his innumerable fauours towards his people, he demanded onely two
  Turtles of the Poore, and one lambe of the Rich. In his house, he will not that
  Incense be offered vnto him for nothing. Amongst other of Gods complaints
  against vs, this is one, if not the greatest, That he contenting himselfe with
  so little, and giuing thee the inioying of so much, thou doost neuer thinke of
  reseruing this little for God. Thou wilt giue large allowance to thy Dogs and
  thy Hawkes, but wilt grutch thy Seruant his meat: Thou wilt pamper thy Horses
  with prouender; but it goes to thy heart to part with a piece of bread to the
  Poore. Out of which hard heartednesse of thine, those sicknesses,
  hunger-staruings, beggeries, and barrennesse which thou sufferest, are
  iustified vpon thee, and deseruedly inflicted.

                  He sent his Seruants. These Seruants were the Prophets,
  who were alwayes busied in requiring this Fruit, and did die in this their
  demaund. In their places succeeded the Apostles: After them, the Prelates and
  Preachers of his Church. And though he had giuen them the name of Huntsmen
  &amp; of Fishers, [Mittam Piscatores multos] here hee calls them
  Secatores, Cutters or Reapers; Misit Seruos suos vt acciperent
  Fructus. By Ezechiel he cals them watchmen or Sentinells,
                     Ezech. 33.6, 7. 
                  Animam de manu speculatoris
  requiram, I haue made thee a Watchman to the House of Israell, therefore
  thou shalt heare the Word from my mouth, and admonish them from me. But if the
  Watchman see the Sword come, and blow not the Trumpet, and the People bee not
  warned; if the Sword come and take any man from among them, he is taken away
  for his iniquitie, but his bloud wil I require at the Watchmans hands. This is
  a hard office; for if thou doost not seeke to saue him, God will require him of
  thee: And if thou doost take pains, and goest about to gather in his rents, the
  Renters will kill thee.
            
            
               Alios ceciderunt, alios lapidauerunt, alios

                  Ministers in this world must expect nothing
 but hard measure.
                  They beat one, stoned another, and killed a
  third. This is the recompence of our Sauiour Christs Ministers; for as his
  Kingdome is not of this world, so neither are his Ministers, nor his rewards.
  He said vnto Pilat, If I were of this world, Ministri mei vtique
  decertarent, My Ministers would contend for me. From the difference of
  this his Kingdome, he inferred that of his Ministers. The Ministers of this
  world may plead an excuse for the non-payment of their Masters Rent; for the
  Vineyard which they inioy is not Christs, neither did he rent it out vnto them,
  nor are the Fruits Christs which they reape thereof: It is a Vineyard that they
  got by their owne proper industrie, so that they fall to eating of it vp, and
  to take away the Fruit of it, without paying any rent or pension out of it. For
  albeit all kind of goods vpon earth belong vnto God, and are due vnto him; yet
  it seemeth vnto them, that they are onely due to their owne diligence; and
  stick not to say in their heart, It is our owne hand

                  Some they beat. By Saint Mathew, Christ
  charged the Pharisees with the bloud of the Righteous; from Abel, to
  Zacharies time, those who were slaine betwixt the Temple and the
  Alter, ioyning their bloud with that of the Prophets: to the end that their
  condemnation should grow vp to it's fulnesse.
               
                  Gods mercy is euer in competition with mans
 malice.He sent againe and againe, the second and the third time; and
  besides, that herein he shewed vs his singular clemencie and goodnesse, he
  aduiseth vs withall, That when one medicine will worke no good vpon the Sicke,
  he will applie many others. Seneca tells vs, That if the earth will
  not yeeld vs any fruit the first yeare, we must fall a ploughing the second and
  the third, and so many yeares together. In one yeare the defaults of many
  yeares are repaired and amended; but here Gods mercie goes a little further, as
  Saint Chrysostome hath noted it; for not hauing any hope to stop their
  malice, yet he stops not his mercie: &amp; being th
                     ••
                   the disease was incurable, yet would
  hee trie and make experiment, whither his Medicine could worke vpon it and
  ouercome it; here ioyned together as it were in competition, Mans malice, with
  Gods meecie. And although great was the obstinacie of their malice, yet in the
  end Mercie was master of the field. Saint Hilarie brings in the
  example of a Father that had a franticke Sonne; who although he would throw
  the Trenchers and Candlestickes at his head, yet for all that did he not leaue
  to doe his best to cure him. Worthie are those words of 
  Saint Augustine, Tibi laus, tibi gloria, Fons misericordiarum; ego fiebam
  miserior, tu propinquior, To thee be praise, to thee be glorie, thou Fountaine
  of Mercies; the worser I was, the neerer wast thou vnto me.
               
            
            
               Nouissimè, misit filium suum.
               
                  Last of all, he sent his sonne. He thought it no
  wisedome in him, to send any more of his Seruants, for that had beene echar
  la soga tras el caldero, to throw the helme after the hatchet. And
  aduising with himselfe what hee were best to doe, after that he had thought
  vpon a Quid faciam? he presently followes with a Nouissimè
  misit filium suum, Last of all he sent his sonne.
               
               First of all, This Quid faciam? What shall I doe?
  argues a kind of perplexitie, like vnto that before the Floud, the World being
  not more wicked, than he was sorrie that he had created it; Being touched
  inwardly with a heartie sorrow, hee sayd, What shall I doe? So now, beeing
  more grieued at the perdition of the husbandmen, than the ill vsage and
  slaughter of his Seruants, hee said, Quid faciam? What course shall I
  take with these men?
               Secondly, He intimates a strange kind of sorrow arising from
  this perplexity, If I am Lord, where is my feare? If I be a father, where
  is my honour? In the end, hee resolued with Gaifas, Let my Sonne
  die. He indeered as much as he could, the force of his loue, sending him to
  saue these Murderers from death; but this could not appease their malice. To
  slay his Prophets, was more than a great malice; but to take away the life of
  his onely Sonne and heire, was excessiue. Saint Hierome saith,
  There was no weight, no number, no measure, in the ones clemencie, nor in
  the others malice. This was a Consummatum est, a fulnesse of his
  me
                     •
                  cie, &amp; a fulnesse of their

                  They will reuerence my Sonne. Saint Luke
  addeth a Fortè thereunto:God in his
 punishing of man, desires more his blushing than his bleeding. And the
  Greeke Originall, a Forsitan: Howbeit it may goe for an Affirmatiue,
  as well as Vtique. Forsitan petisses ab eo, &amp; ipse dedisset tibi aquam,
  &amp;c. And so againe, Si crederitis Moysi, crederetis forsitan &amp;
  mihi, If yee had beleeued Moses, yee would likewise haue beleeued me. And
  so it sorts well with that Text both of Saint Mathew and Saint
  Marke, who absolutely say, Verebuntur filium meum, They will
  reuerence my Sonne. In neither of these is a May bee, or a
  Forsitan; and onely to signifie the great reuerence which was due vnto
  him. Where by the way Saint Chrysostome hath noted this vnto vs, That
  God (for all these their outrages) did desire no furthe

                   satisfaction from them, than to see them abasht and
  ashamed ofthis their ingratitude and crueltie. Benigno Domino sufficiebat

  blushing, not their bleeding, that he desired; hee wisht their shame, and not
  their confusion. Parum supplicij satis est patri, pro

  Saint Bernard saith, That the whole life of our Sauiour Christ, from
  the Cratch to the Crosse, was to keepe vs from sinning, out of meere shame; and
  that his maine drift euer was, to leaue vs confounded and ashamed of our
  selues, that our sinnes and wickednesse should force God against his will to
  punish vs: For he takes no delight in the death of a Sinner.

  lies before the Prince and men of authoritie; of sinne, before the Iudge and
  Ruler; of offence, before the Congreation and People; of 
  vnrighteousnesse, before a companion and friend; and of theft, before the place
  where thou dwellest, &amp; before the truth of God &amp; his Couenant; &amp; to
  lean with thine elbows vpon the bread; or to be reproued for giuing or taking;
  &amp; of silence to them that salute thee; &amp; to look vpon an harlot, &amp;
  to turn away thy face from thy Kinseman; or to take away a portion or gift; or
  to be euill minded towards another mans wife; or to solicite any mans mayd; or
  to stand by her bed; or to reproach thy friends with words; or to vpbraid when
  thou giuest any thing; or to report a matter that thou hast heard; or to
  reueale secret words: Thus mayst thou well be shamefaced, &amp; shalt find
  fauour with all men. This Erubescite must be the burthen of the Song,
  to euerie one of these Versicles. It is a foule and a shamefull thing,
  to doe any of these things in the presence of graue persons, to whom we owe a
  respect. Much more foule in the presence of God, who stands at thy elbow in all
  thy actions. But foulest of all, to commit these things in the presence of the
  Sonne of God, whome his Father sent to bee thy Master, thy Tutor, and nayled
  him to the Crosse for thy sinnes, that thou mightst bee ashamed to commit the
  like againe, considering the great torment that he suffered for thee. Some

  committing some foule offence; What would it worke then with him, had God

                  ideration, That the innumerable summe
  of those infinite fauours which God did to his Vineyard, should end in a
  Peraduenture, and stand vpon hap-hazard. A man may thinke it somewhat strange,
  That God should come to any place vpon vncertainties: but God is so good a God,
  that he doth not so much proportion his blessings by the measure of his
  Wisedome, as his Loue; not that he doth not certainly know what we will be, but
  because he would faine haue vs to be what we should be.Gods
 Loue ceaseth not for mans wickednesse. For if he should reward vs
  according to those our actions, which he in his prescience and eternall essence
  foresees will come to passe; Who of vs should be left aliue, or who of vs
  should bee borne? Onely the Innocent (saith Theodoret) should then be
  fauoured. And therefore rather than it should bee so, he was willing to put it
  vpon the venture, how or what we might prooue heereafter. He knew before hand,
  that Lucifer should fall; that Adam should sin; that
  Saul should turn disobedient; &amp; that Iudas should sel him
  &amp; betray him: yet did he not forbeare for all this to throw his fauours
  vpon them. S. Ambrose asketh the question, Why Christ would make
  choice of Iudas, when as he knew before hand that he would betray him?
  And his answer thereunto is, That it was to justifie his loue, and to shew the
  great desire that he had that all should bee saued, yea, euen Iudas
  himselfe: And therefore (knowing his couetous disposition) hee made him his
  Purse-bearer, that he might shut the doore to his excuses, and that he might
  not haue iust cause to say, That he was in want, &amp; lackt mony, &amp; so was
  forced out of meere necessitie, to betray and sel his Master, which otherwise
  he would neuer haue done: but the deliuering ouer the Purse vnto him, tooke
  away that obiection. Well then, What can this Traitor say for himselfe? That
  Christ did not countenance him as he did the rest, or that hee made light
  reckoning of him? Neither will this hold water; for hee had made him an
  Apostle, hee was listed in the rolle with the rest, hee wrought miracles as
  well as his Fellowes, &amp; receiued many other fauours from his Masters
  hands. The same reason may serue as well for the Iewes, as Iudas: For
  our Sauior knew that they should put him to death; yet for all this would not
  he cease to shew his loue vnto them.

  Fruits they killed his Seruants, and for greedinesse of the Inheritance, they
  killed the Heire. Couetousnesse is the root of all euill; Pride is the
  seed of all sinnes, and Couetousnesse the root which maintaines them: The Seed
  is that beginning which giues them their beeing; the Root, that which sustaines
  and nourishes them in their verdure. From the Tree you may easily lop the
  boughes, but hardly remooue the roots: First, Because they are so deep that we
  cannot well come at them: And secondly, Because they are couered and buried
  vnder ground. When Couetousnesse taketh deepe rooting in the heart of man, it
  is couered ouer with the cloake of Sanctitie and of Vertue, they are hard to
  bee digged out. From this Vice two great huts doe arise:
               The one, That it is the Leauen of all our ill. Salust
  saith,Nothing worse than a couetous man That it
  destroyes the Vertues and the Arts, and in their places brings in Infidelities
  and Treasons, standing at open defiance both with God and Man.
  Ecclesiasticus saith, That there is nothing worse than a couetous man;
  for such a one would euen sell his Soule for loue of money. The Princes of
  Iudah (saith Osee) were like them that remooued the
  bound. Saint Hierome and Lyra note, That the Prophet
  borrowed this Metaphor from the Husbandmen, who inlarge the bounds of their
  Inheritance, growing by little and little on that which is another mans.
                     Ose 5.10. No vice more seuerely punished than
 Couetousnesse. And that the Gouernours of the two Tribes did reioyce in
  the seruitude and captiuitie of the other ten, for to inlarge their owne Lands
  and Territories, and to augment their jurisdiction. To reioyce in the
  inlarging of their owne, was not much amisse; but to take pleasure in another
  mans miserie, is so great a sinne, that God threatens seuerely to punish it.
  I will poure forth (saith he) myne indignation vpon them like
  water. In other his chastisements, he vseth the word stillare:
  now that which is distilled comes away in little drops, and with a great deale
  of leisure; but heere he saith, Effundam iram meam, Like a storme,
  that comes so suddenly vpon him that he cannot escape it. The Prophet
  Amos saith, That amongst many other sinnes which the Sonnes of
  Ammon had committed, one was a verie desperate one,
                     Amos 1.13. 
                  For three transgressions of the
  Children of Ammon, and for foure, I will not turne to it; Because they
  haue ript vp the women with child, of Giliad, that they might inlarge their
  borders. For bordering vpon those of Gilead, they slew their women that were
  great with child, that they might inherit their possessions; ad dilatandum
  terminum suum: As Queene Iesabel caused Naboth to bee
  put to death,3. Reg. 20. that she might haue
  his Vineyard. In a word, In that verie houre when Couetousnesse killed the
  Sonne of God, What punishment, were it neuer so cruell, might not such an
  offence iustly feare?
               The second hurt is, That it is a vice of all other the hardest
  to bee remedied.No vice so hard to be reformed as
 Couetousnesse 
                  Phylon calls it, Wickednesses Fort, where all
  sinnes are protected and defended. Saint Chrysostome saith, That Gold
  turnes men into Beasts, nay, into beastly and abhominable Deuils. Whereby he
  signified, That it was an vnreclaimable sin. Saint Ambrose, That the
  couetous man reioyceth to see the Widow weepe, and the Orphan to crie, which is
  a foule sinne. Saint Bernard paints out the Chariot of Couetousnesse
  to be drawne by cruell, fierce, and desperate both Coachman and Horses.
  Iudas his owne heart opens this truth; in regard that all the
  diligences, all the fauours that our Sauiour Christ did him, (in washing his
  feet with  water, and it may be with the teares that
  trickled from his eyes; his permitting him to dip his finger in the same dish
  with him, and to bestow his best morcells vpon him) were not of power to
  mollifie and soften this stonie heart of his.
               
                  Come, let vs kill him. Verie fitly is Sinne called a
  breake-necke, or a downfall; not onely in regard of that heigth from whence
  the Sinner falls, and the deepenesse of the pit whereinto hee is to descend;
  but because of his retchlesnesse and his carelesnesse, by falling headlong
  from one sinne into another, til he come to the bottome of all villanie and
  wickednesse. And this is the reason why the Scripture makes so much reckoning
  of the first sinne we commit. The first sinne that Saul committed, was
  the pittie that he shewed to Amaleck: And though in it selfe it were
  not so grieuous a sinne, yet hee perseuered afterwards in enuying and
  persecuting Dauid;1. Kings. 22. hee
  committed great cruelties in Nob, as a Moore could not doe more; he slew
  fourescore and fiue Priests that wore a Linnen Ephod: And because his faults
  were so heinous, the Scripture mentioneth not any one saue that of his pittie
  towards Amaleck; because that was the first round in the Ladder,
                     Psal. 1. by which he fell afterwards downe into
  Hell. Beatus vir qui non abijt, Blessed is the man that hath not walked in
  the councell of the Vngodly, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
  stood in the way of Sinners, and hath not sate in the seat of the
  Scornefull.
               
               There are three happinesses that a man is said to enioy:
               The one, Not to fall into the pit of Sinne.
               The other, If he doe fall, not to continue long therein.
               The third, That if he doe perseuer in sinne, that he bee not
  bewitched therewith, nor make it his Seat. For Sinne (according to Saint
  Austen) produceth Custome, and Custome, a necessitie of sinning.
               Thus doth God punish one sinne with another, a lesser sinne with
  a greater; which is the greatest and seuerest rigour which the Tribunall of
  Gods Iustice inflicteth.Gods course in punishing of sinne,
 is to reuenge the lesser with the greater. 
                  Seneca tells vs,
  The prime and principall punishment of a Sinner, is his sinning; for
  then, God falls presently a punishing sinne vpon sinne. The Scripture reckoning
  vp all the sinnes of Herod, as his tyrannies, cruelties, his swinish
  nature, and his incestuous life; it addeth, super haec omnia, (as
  though all the rest in comparison of this were as nothing) That hee had
  beheaded Saint Iohn Baptist, because he preached Truth vnto him. And
  this was the greatest vengeance that God could take of his former sinnes. With
  Vria's murder, God reuenged Dauids adultrie: And
  Nathans reproouing him was the appeasing of Gods wrath against him.
  For if God should not haue vsed this his mercy towards him, what would haue
  become of Dauid? Saint Ambrose expounding those words which
  Christ vttered vnto Peter, Thou shalt denie me thrice; saith, That
  this placing of these three denialls, was not onely a foretelling of them, but
  of setting likewise a bound and limit vnto them, to the end that hee should not
  denie his Master any more than three times. God reuenged his first deniall, by
  his second, being forced to forsweare, That he knew him not; and his second,
  by the third, aggrauating the same with so many protestations and
  Anathema's. But if Christ had not looked backe vpon him, and taken
  pittie of him, what would haue become of poore Peter? But vpon the
  sinnes of the Pharisees our Sauiour did not put any taxe or limitation,
  That all the bloud of the Iust might light vpon their heads; For they
  were a reprobate kind of people. The liues of the Prophets he reuenged by the
  death of his Sonne and heire: He reuenged the euill workes which they had done,
  in that the Light beeing brought into the World, they shut vp themselues in
  Darkenesse. And with this suteth that of Esay, Thou hast made their
  owne iniquities the instruments, and as it were the hands to dash them in
  pieces.  Thou hast made them subiect to their sinnes,
  they can doe no more than what sinne shall command them to doe: If it bid them
  kill, they shall kill▪ if steale▪ they shall steale. In a word, Sinne
  is their Lord, and they are Sinnes 
                     •
                  laues. And therefore the Scripture termeth those that are great
  Sinners, Vendidos, Men that are sould ouer vnto sinne. Esay
  puts this name vpon A
                        •
                     bab, I am
  sould to sinne: and those who denied God, his Law, or their Countrie,
  &amp; did take part with those their enemies that were Infidells;1. Mac. 1. the first booke of the
  Macabees registreth them for Slaues that had sould themselues ouer
  vnto sinne. The like saith Saint Paul of those who remaine
  captiues to the Deuill, and that follow after his will;2.
 Tim. 2. 
                  A quo captiui tenemur ad ipsius voluntatem.
  Out of whose snare wee must come to amendment, and not suffer our selues to be
  taken of him at his will.
               
                  And the Inheritance shall be ours. The Sinner summing
  vp his wickednesse,Sinners are vsually taken in their owne
 Snares. thinkes he hath made a iust and good account: So,
  Pharaoh pursuing Gods People, made this sure reckoning with himselfe;
  Persequar, I will follow them, take them, and spoyle them, and my Soule
  shall haue it's desire vpon them. So did it fare with these Farmers, they
  had cast vp their reckoning, and made full account that the Inheritance should
  be theirs: They had destroyed his People, his Temple, his Vineyard, his Syon,
  his Prophecies, his Miracles, his Priesthood, his Arke, his Authoritie, and his
  Glorie; What could they well doe more, to make themselues Lords of all? But,
  Conuertetur dolor eius in caput eius; They shall bee ouertaken in
  their owne wickednesse, and this mischiefe shall light vpon their owne
  heads.
            
            
               Et ejecerunt eum extra Vineam.
               
                  And they cast him out of the Vineyard.
                  Why the blood of Christ was not shed in the Vineyard.
 Esay 65.5 They cast him out of the Vineyard and slew him. Saint
  Chrysostome saith, That they cast him out of the Vineyard, that his
  bloud might not defile it: Vsing him herein like a Leaper; which was no more
  than was prophecied by Esay, Stand apart, come not neere me, for I am
  holier 
                        •
                     han thou. The Iewes
  were so daintie, that when Iudas repented him of what he had done, and
  returned them their mony againe, they would none of it;
                     Math. 27.6. 
                  It is not lawfull for vs to put
  this money into the Treasurie, because it is the price of bloud. And they
  did not onely expresse their hypocrisie in this particular; but they would not
  likewise enter into the Praetorium, or Common-Councell house, That
  they might not be defiled with his companie. And here in this place,
  They cast him out of the Vineyard; but the Diuine prouidence, which
  did with a more especiall hand guide that action, did so order the businesse,
  that the bloud of our Sauiour Iesus Christ should be shed out of the Vineyard,
  because it should not hinder the destruction and desolation that was to come
  vpon that wretched &amp; accursed City. For, if Ierusalem should haue beene
  besprinkled with the bloud of this Lambe, the Angel would haue past by it, and
  the Roman power should not haue bin able to haue ruined it and laid it leuell
  with the ground.
               They cast him likewise out of the Vineyard, for to inrich the
  Land of the Gentiles; his bloud, which spake better things than that of
  Abel, being shed in their 
                     •
                  auour, and for their good. The glorious Doctor Saint
  Ambrose saith, That the 
                     •
                  ield which Caine drew out Abel into, was bad and
  barren ground; it being Gods pleasure that that place should be vnfruitfull,
  wherein that bloud should be shed 
                     •
                  hat was to crie for vengeance. But for the bloud of our most
  blessed Sauiour 
                     •
                  nd Redeemer, Iesus
  Christ; howbeit it fell among stories, yet because it spake
  
                     •
                  etter words than that of
  Abel, as also for that from the Crosse he poured down
  
                     •
                  is benediction vpon it, they lost
  their barrennesse. Saint Augustine saith, That 
  as in the Garden he sweated bloud, making that ground fruitfull therewith, that
  Martyrs might bud and spring out of it; so in Mount Caluarie hee also shed his
  bloud, to the end that the Land of the Gentiles taking this diuine Balsamum
  into their Soules, and letting it soke into their hearts, they might bring
  forth great and plentifull Fruits, euen Fruits in aboundance.

  her head, &amp;c. &amp; when he had bestowed all these things vpon her, and
  that she was come of age to be his Spouse, (which the King of all other things
  desired most) she left his house, ranne away from him, set vp for her selfe in

  lightnesses, &amp; loosnes of life; purchasing her selfe Louers with her
  Siluer, not remembring the dayes of her youth, when she was naked and bare,
  and forsaken of all the world, saue this good King that tooke compassion on

                  What will the Lord of the Vineyard doe? He did direct
  this question to the repairing of their perdition, for as yet they were in the
  state of saluation: And 
                     〈◊〉
                   they

  Prophet Esay threatning Edom, saith, He will measure it out with a
  Line, that he may bring it to naught.
                  
                     Esay
 34. No man doth measure a Building to destroy it; the Rule and the
  Square were ordained for to build. I answer, Amongst your Artificers here vpon
  earth, it passeth so as thou sayest; but he that was that onely Artizan of
  Heauen, dwelt longer vpon the destroying of Niniuie, than hee would haue done
  in building of it. Cogitauit Dominus dissipare murum filiae Syon, tetendit
  funiculum; The Lord hath determined to destroy the wall of the Daughter of
  Syon, he stretched out a Line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from
  destroying. The Lord had a determination to destroy the citie of Ierusalem; but
  first hee tooke a measure thereof (as wee say) by line and by leisure.
  Rupertus hath noted it, that he was seuentie yeres about taking this
  measure.
               Lastly he askes the question, What shall the Lord of the
  Vineyard doe? because to destroy and to kill, is to bee vsed where no
  other meanes will serue the turne.God omits no meanes to
 bring vs to himselfe. Deut. 20.10. After that they had ill
  intreated his Seruants, stoned some, &amp; slaine other-some, and last of all
  his heire; yet (euen after all this) doth he seeke to make peace with them. In
  the twentieth of Deutronomie God hath commanded, That when thou
  commest neere vnto a citie to fight against it, before thou shalt set vpon the
  same, thou shalt offer it peace. Abishai besieging Abel,2. Kings. 20. a woman cryed out there within,
  Knowst thou not that they spake in the old time, saying, They should first aske
  peace of Abel? and hence it is said, Qui interogant, interogent in
  Abel. Why doost thou not first demand Sheba of vs, &amp; wee shall deliuer
  Sheba vp into thy hands? Quare pracipitas hereditatem Domini? Why wilt thou
  destroy the Lords Inheritance? Chrysostome saith, That Gods sending of
  Ionas to preach, Yet forty days, and Niniuie shall be
  destroyed; was no other but a profering of peace vnto them.
               
                  What shall the Lord of the Vineyard doe? All these, and
  other larger proffers, God vseth to make to Christendome in generall, and to
  euery one of the Faithfull in particular. He hath planted a Church, hee hath
  watred it with his owne bloud, and that of the Apostles and Martyrs; he hath
  ploughed and tilled it, and sowne it with the seed of his Doctrine; he hath
  affoorded thee strange fauours, as riches, discretion, beautie, the dainties of
  the Earth, of the Ayre, and of the Sea; and all these hast thou made as weapons
  to offend him, Quid faciet Dominus Vinia?
               
               It is no meruaile, that many Christians are worse now in
  part,Many Christians now worse enemies to Christ, than were
 the Pharisees. than the Pharisees were then; for in the brests of the
  Pharisees there was no faith nor no knowledge of Christ, which occasioned
  their sinnes against Christ: but the Christians beleeuing in him, and adoring
  him, doe not sticke to offend him. The Pharisees would not receiue Christ our
  Sauior &amp; Redeemer, because then they must haue laid aside their
  couetousnesse, their ambition, their hypocrisie, &amp; dissimulation; but they
  beeing so proud a People, would not admit of so humble a God. A poore King, and
  rich Vassals, doe not sute well together; but to beleeue in him, and yet not to
  regard him, this is a foule fault among Christians. Samaria being subiect to
  the Assyrians, God sent a fearefull scourge amongst them, Lyons, which euerie
  where slew them and tore them in pieces. The King desiring to repaire this
  losse, sent Priests among them, to instruct them in the Law of that Land, and
  to persuade them to the feare of God, and to teach them the manner of the God
  of the Countrie; but the Text saith, They feared the Lord,
                  4. Kings. 17.33 
                  but serued their Idols
  withall; They offered their Vnderstanding to God, but their Will vnto
  Idolls. The like kind of course a great part of Christendome taketh; they
  acknowledge a God, but adore Vice, and their Faith they thinke shall serue them
   for a safe Conduct, that God may not destroy them in his
  wrath. Beeing herein like vnto your Marshalls men, who onely therefore serue
  the Marshall, that they may liue the looser, and sinne with more safetie.
               Two mischiefes seeme to threaten such kind of Christians: 
  
                     The one, That this their Faith may turne to their greater
condemnation.
                     The other, That they may runne the hazard of loosing
it.
                   By Balaams aduice, the King of Moab sent many
  faire and beautifull women to Gods People, to the end to draw on their loue the
  more; but charging them withall, that they should not in any hand yeeld to
  their longings and their lustings, vnlesse they would first worship those
  Idolls which they themselues adored. And it so fell out (Affection ouer-ruling
  Religion) that many of the Faithfull by this meanes fell away, and did linke
  themselues in marriage with them, making little or no scruple of the condition
  whereunto they were tyed. Wee may verie well giue great thankes to our Vices,
  and vnto God, who hath so ordred the businesse for vs, that though our Vices
  bring with them vnlawful pleasures and delights, yet they doe not bring Idols
  with them; which if they did, I feare me that many would echaran la soga,
  tras el Caldero, Hurle the rope after the kettle, or (as we say by way of
  Prouerbe) Fling the helme after the hatchet.

  case, His goods were lost, but his soule was saued. But the perdition of this
  people was generall, both in their goods, their honours, their wiues, their
  children, their Temple, their liues, and their soules. In a word, God would,
  that this people (like Lots wife) should serue for a generall warning
  to the whole World, by notifying their punishment to all nations. Deus

                  Gods punishments of two sorts.
 Psal. 6.1. Ierem. 10.24.
                  He will destroy those
  wicked ones. Dauid craues of God, That hee will not correct him in his
  furie, neither chasten him in his displeasure. Ne in furore Domine.
  God punishes all, but not in his furie. Ieremy craues a
  Corripe, but it is in judicio, non in furore, Correct vs (ô
  Lord) and yet in thy judgement, not in thy fury. This Prophet sets downe
  two sorts of punishments.
               The one, of an Almond tree budding. Quid tu vides
  Ieremiah? What 
                        〈◊〉
                      thou
  Ieremy? Virgam vigilantem ego video, (sayth hee) I see a rod of an
  Almond tree.

               In the rod, he represented vnto vs a light kind of punishment;
  with a rod, we vse to beat out the dust, &amp; if you strike therwith but two
  or three strong blow

  you will presently breake it. And this kind of punishment, is eue
                     •
                   more directed to amendment of life,
  and to serue as a warning vnto vs. Ionath

                   eyes, were opened with that honie which he had on the top of
  his wand.
               But in that of the pot seething, he represents vnto vs a most
  sharpe and seuere punishment.
               
                  
                  He shall destroy those wicked
  ones. Man is so wedded to selfe-loue,Selfe loue the
 ouerthrow of man. that when it shall incounter with the counsell of God,
  it will goe about to condemne it. Of fiue hundred offenders that lye in prison,
  you shall scarce finde one that will not complaine, that he suffers vniustly;
  &amp; that the Iudges sentence proceeded either out of malice or iniustice: And
  for these, there is no better course to be taken with them, than to halter
  them, as they doe Mules, when they begin to play iadish trickes. As well
  conditioned as Dauid was, Nathan the Prophet was faine to
  hamper him in this manner, that he might thereby be taught to know his own
  error. The like order doth our Sauiour Christ take with this froward people;
  And albeit, they were so crafty and so wary, that when he propounded any
  questions vnto them, they were wonderfull carefull what answere to make him,
  suspecting this was but a trap set for them; insomuch, that when our Sauiour
  ask't them, Whether the Baptisme of Iohn Baptist, were from Heauen, or
  from Earth? They answered, We know not. But notwithstanding all this,
                     Prou. 21.30. forasmuch as there is no wisedome, no
  prudence, nor no counsaile against the Lord; and that the wisedome of the
  Earth, is but foolishnesse to that of Heauen: they fell into the snare,
  pronouncing this sentence against themselues, Malos, male perdet, He
  will cruelly destroy those wicked men.
               It was not much, that the children should waxe blind, beeing
  neere the splendour of his diuine Wisedome; when as their father the Deuill,
  who was the fountaine of Malice, was strucken blinde therewith. Iob,
  that patterne of Patience, saith, Hee that made him, will make his owne
  sword to approach vnto him.
                  
                     Iob. 40.

  knife. Hee tooke vp sinne, as a sword, against God, and against Man: but the
  Wisedome of God so guided the blow, that he sheathed his sword in his owne
  bowels. He brought in Death, and Death was his death. Hee bit Eue by
  the heele; but this biting, was the brusing of his head. Of Golias
  sword, Dauid said, Non est similis in terra, There was not the
  like againe to bee had. Not that there was not such another to be found in
  the Philistimes armories, but because it found out the tricke to cut off his
  Masters head. So the Pharisees own sentence was the sword, that cut their
  throates. Nebuchadnezar, asking of his Southsayers the signification
  of his dreame, They told him, None can doe that, but God. Now when
  Daniell shall interpret it, he must (by your owne confession) be
  either a God, or one of Gods inward friends. Malos, male perd

                     t, Hee will destroy those wicked
  ones, your owne mouth condemns you. Saint Chrysostome, and
  Eutimius say, That they were all of this opinion. But anon after
  finding themselues bitten, they foyst in an Absit. But our Sauiour
  citing for his purpose that saying of the Psalmist, Lapidem quem
  reprobauerunt, &amp;c. The stone which they refused, &amp;c.
                  
                     Psal. 118.21. Their mouthes were bungd vp, and
  their Absit would not now serue their turne. And therefore he sayes
  vnto them, Auferetur à vobis Regnum Dei, The Kingdome of God shall
  be taken from you, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               Auferetur à vobis regnum Dei.
               
                  The Kingdome of God shall be taken from you.
                  The
 translatiō of Gods kingdome from the Iewes to the Gentiles. The
  prophecies of the translation from the Iewes, to the Gentiles, as they are
  many, so are they most manifest. As in that of Esay, Quia posuisti
  ciuitatem in tumulum. Where he treateth of this alteration, and of the
  destruction of Ierusalem. Of Osee, The children of Israell shall remaine
  many dayes without a King. Of Ieremy, I haue forsaken my
  house,
                  
                     Esay. 5. Osee, 3.4.
 Ieremy. 12.7. Math. 23.38. 
                  I haue left my
  heritage. Of Malachy, My affection is not towards you. Mathew
  sums vp all these prophecies in one. Your habitation shall be left vnto you
  desolate. Pope  
                  Leo hath obserued, that our
  Sauiour Christ beeing not able to beare the heauie burthen of the Crosse, the
  Iewes fearing he would not dye till they had fastned him thereunto, hired a
  Gentile, called Simon Cirenaeus, to helpe him awhile in the bearing of
  it. Onely thereby to show, that the fruit of the Crosse, was to come vnto the
  Gentiles. Or to explaine it fuller, his submitting himselfe to the Crosse
  amidst these cruell Iewes, was not a thing done by chance, but a kind of
  prophecie, That the Gentiles should take possession of the key of Heauen.
               
                  The Kingdome of God shall be taken from you. Here first
  of all, he aduiseth Kings, Princes, and Rulers, that they looke well vnto their
  wayes, and stand in feare of this change. For God is woont to transferre
  Kingdomes, States, and Seigniories from one nation to another,
                     Eccl. 10. for their sinnes sake. Because of
  vnrighteous dealing, and wrongs, and riches gotten by deceit, the Kingdome is
  translated from one people to another. A King suffers his subiects to be
  ouerladen with Taxes, when they are not able to beare them: Giue that Kingdome
  for lost. The wicked shall be cut-off from the Earth,
                  
                     Prou. 2.22. D
                           ••
                        . 6. 
                  and the transgressors shall bee rooted out of
  it. Daniel pronounceth as much, God changeth times and ages, he
  translateth kingdomes, and establisheth them. The most high beareth rule
  ouer the kingdome of men, and giueth it to whomsoeuer he will. And those that
  walke in pride, hee is able to abase. And in the fourth chapter,
                     Dan. 4. 
                  He setteth vp a meane man in their
  steed. The examples of this in Gods people are more in number than the
  starres of Heauen. We see the house of Ieroboam destroyed and vtterly
  rooted out by the hands of Baasha; That of Baasha, by
  Zambri; and that of Ahab, by Iehu. In the land of
  promise, God tooke away one and thirtie Kingdomes,3.
 Reg. 14.15. 3. King. 16. 4. King. 9. from
  those Kings, and bestowed them on his owne people. Alios laborauerunt,
  &amp; vos in laborem eorum introistis, Others tooke the paines, and yee reap't
  the profit. But he did deferre the possession of these for some few
  yeares, because the sinnes of the Amorites were not yet come vnto their heigth.
  Salmanazer, carried away tenne of the Tribes captiue to the land of
  the Medes; Nebuchadnezzar destroyd the City and Temple of Ierusalem;
  and leading the people away captiue vnto Babilon, he left the land wast and
  desolate: as it appeareth in the Lamentations of Ieremie, Haereditas
  nostra, versa est ad alienos, Our inheritance, is turned ouer vnto
  strangers. The Monarchy of the Assirians and Babilonians, was transferred
  to the Medes and Persians; that of the Persians, to the Grecians and
  Macedonians; and that of the Macedonians, to the Romans; as was prophecied by
  Daniel, in that prodigious Statua which Nebuchadnezzar saw in
  his dreame. The Empire of Constantinople, was translated to the
  Ottoman Family. In a word, numberlesse are those Kingdomes, which haue
  suffered their alterations, and translations. Their sinnes, beeing the onely
  cause of this their change.
               Secondly, He aduiseth those of the middle sort, on whome God
  hath bestowed wealth,God substracts his Blessings, whē we
 proue vngratefull. houses, honours, and health, wherewithall
  conueniently to passe this life of theirs, That they proue not vngratefull vnto
  God: For he knowes as well how to take away from them, as to giue to them, all
  these his good blessings, and to bring them by meanes neuer dreamt of, to the
  Hospitall, and to shamefull pouertie and dishonour. According to that saying
  vttered by God himselfe,1. Reg. 2. 
                  They
  that despise me, shall be despised. As also by the mouth of Osee.
  This People doth not acknowledge that I giue them Wine, Wheate, and Oyle; and
  therefore I shall make them to acknowledge it, by taking these things from
  them, leauing them poore, hungrie, and miserable.
               Thirdly, Hee aduiseth the Faithfull, to procure to preserue the
  goods of Grace, and the right and hope which they haue in the Kingdome of
  Heauen;  lest God should translate the same to a Nation
  that should bring forth better fruit, leauing them in the darkenesse of errours
  &amp; heresies, without Priests, without Sacraments, without Scriptures,
  without God; and passing these his good graces ouer to a People that haue not
  knowne his Law. For though God chops and changes Kingdomes, yet hee neuer takes
  away his Riches and his blessings. Tene quod habes,
  
                        •
                     e alius accipiat Coronam tuam,
  Hold fast that thou hast, lest another come and take thy Crowne from thee;
  It is Saint Iohns, in his Apocalyps. God remooued
  Adam out of Paradice, God will raise seed out of stones, and make
  barren places to bring forth fruit.
            
            
               Et dabitur Genti facienti fructum.
               
                  And it shall be giuen to a Nation that shall bring forth
  fruit. The Princes of the earth takes away the wealth of one of his
  Ministers, &amp; giues it to another; puts away a bad seruant, &amp; takes in a
  worse; remooues a full fed Flie, and claps a leane Carrion in his roome.
  Ioshuah tooke ten stones out of Iordan, and put other ten in the
  places of them: This is a figure of the Worlds Reformation. Offices are euerie
  day chopt and changed; twelue pibble Stones are rowled out of the Court, and
  twelue others are tumbled in, in their stead. But God is of another kind of
  temper, he makes choice of a people that shall bring forth Fruit: Hee takes the
  Kingdome from Saul, &amp; giues it vnto Dauid, I will giue it to
  one that is better than thy selfe. Hee toke away the Priesthood from
  Shebna, (who grew fat therein,
                     Esay.
 22. like a Capon in a Coope) and gaue it to Eliakim, Who was as it
  were a father of the Inhabitants of Ierusalem. The sons of Ely
  died, and Samuel succeeded in the Priesthood. Suscitabo mihi
  Sacerdotem fidelem, I will raise vnto me a faithfull Priest. God raise vs
  vp all to newnesse of life,1. Kings. 2. and
  let not our vnthankfulnesse cause him to thrust vs out of this vineyard which
  he hath planted for vs; but that we may return him some fruits thereof, that he
  may be glorified here by vs on Earth; and we receiue from him a Crowne of
  eternall glory in Heauen.
            
         
         
            
            THE SEVENTEENTH SERMON, VPON THE SATVRDAY AFTER THE SECOND
SONDAY IN LENT.

                  A certaine man had two Sonnes, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               The distrubution of the matter.
               AMongst
the rest of the Parables, this Parable is treated of; and is diuided into foure
parts:
            The first relates the resolution of an idle young fellow desirous
to see the world, and to haue his fathers leaue to trauell.
            The second, His vnaduised actions, lewd courses, lauish expences,
and the miseries that befell him thereupon.
            The third, The consideration of his own wretched estate, his
returning home to his fathers house all totter'd and torne, weake, and
hungerstarued.
            The fourth, His fathers kind reception of him, and the joy that he
took in this his lost sonne.
            This followes verie fitly that former Parable of the Vineyard:
            That being full of feare; this, of hope:
            That, of the rigour of justice; this, of the regalos of
mercie.
            That checkes a sinner in his sinnes; this spurs him on to
repentance.
            And these are those two Poles whereon the whole gouernement of God
dependeth.
            
               This world is nothing but a mixture of good
  &amp; euill
               A certaine man had two sonnes. In these two sons are
represented vnto vs the just, and the sinnefull man. For, this life is a Net
which holds all sorts of fishes; it is an heape of Corne, where the Chaffe is
mixed with the Wheat; it is a flock of Sheep and Goats; a bodie consisting of
contrarie humors; a ground of good seed, and of tares: All are the sonnes of
God by creation, but not by adoption. Fathers may haue sonnes alike in fauour,
but not in conditions: Adam, to his Abel had a Caine;
Noah, to his Shem had a Cham; Abraham, to his
Isaac had an Ismael; Isaac, to his Iacob had an
Esau; Dauid, to his Salomon had an Absalon; and
Salomon himselfe had a Rehoboam: So haue most men that haue
many children; and God himselfe hath some crosse, froward, and peruerse
children.
            
               
               Adolescentior ex illis.
               
                  The younger of them. The Saints and Doctors doe
  multiplie the motiues of this his longing to be gadding abroad. But the malne
  Motiue was, that hee was yong, and desirous of libertie. He that names the
  word, Youth, names ignorance, small experience, infinite longings, a sudden
  quicknesse in entertaining them, and a foolish rashnesse in inioying them.
  Through a foolish longing, Adam and Eue lost the greatest
  Empire that euer was acknowledged by the World, in lesse than six houres; being
  presently turned out of Gods blessing (as they say) into the warme Sunne; and
  out of a Paradise, into a place of miserie. They were yong, and there is not
  that Vice (as Saint Austen saith) which will not seeke to lodge it
  selfe in youths bosome. They were youngmen, which Ezechiell saw with
  their backes turned to the Sancta sanctorum, entertaining themselues
  with the fragrant sweet sent of flowers. They were yongmen, which in the Booke
  of Wisedome, plant in all hast a Vineyard of Vices. Vtamur Creatura,
  tanquam in inuentute, celeritur. They were yongmen, which lost
  Rehoboam his kingdome. He was a yongman (saith Salomo
                        •
                     
                  ) whom the married wife in her
  husbands absence inuited to her house, and to her bed, being led along by
  her,
                     Prou.
                     
                        •
                     . as an Oxe that goeth to
  the slaughter, or as a Foole to the stockes for correction. Hee was a
  youngman, that would take vpon him to guide the horses and chariot of the Sun.
  Yongmen are those, whom misfortunes dayly make an end off in the prime and
  
                     •
                  lower of their youthfull yeares.
  In regard of whose manifold dangers, Dauid did desire of God, That he
  would not take him away in the dayes of his youth. His sonne Salomon,
  was many dayes together much vexed with the rawnesse and ignorance of his
  heire, that was to succeed him; as diuining of the disasters, which were to
  ensue so prosperous a raigne,
                     Eccl. 2 18.
                  I hated all my labour wherein I had trauailed vnder the Sunne, which I
  shall leaue to the man that shall bee after mee; And who knoweth, whether he
  shall be wise or foolish?
               
               The second motiue was,The wicked loue not to
 bee checkt in their proceedings. That he might be farre out of sight
  from his fathers presence, which he thought too great an eye-sore, hauing a
  desire to be free from the respect and reuerence which was due vnto him, from
  his instructions, admonitions, inquiries, and chidings. This was the end, why
  hee was willing to trauell, and the beginning of his ruine. The just man, hath
  euer God before his eyes. As the eyes of a maiden vnto the hands of her
  Mistris,
                  
                     Psal. 123. 
                  euen so our eyes
  waite vpon the Lord our God. The sinner would not, that Gods eyes should
  see him, nor his eyes see God, that he might sinne the more freely: and
  therefore hee saith to himselfe, Tush God hath forgotten; hee hideth away
  his face, and he will neuer see it.
                  
                     Psal.
 10.12. Iob 22.13.14. 
                  How should God know, can he iudge
  through the darkenesse? The Cloudes hide him that
  
                        •
                     e cannot see, and he walketh
  through the circle of Heauen. In a word, this yong man did seeke to shake
  off from his shoulders all those obligations, which the presence of his father
  might lay vpon him. But it seemeth to Saint Austen, that the cause of
  his perdition, was Pride, his not acknowledging of subiection, nor
  superioritie. This was the sinne of Lucifer in Heauen, and of
  Adam in Paradice. Initium superbiae hominis apostatare a Deo.
  This doctrine of Saint Austens, hath a great deale of reason on it's
  side, as is obserued by Thomas: For all other vices make a man goe
  departing from God by degrees, wheeling about as it were, and fetching a
  compasse; but Pride standing out stiffe against God, and seeking as it were to
  out face him, fals presently to an absolute neglect of his diuine Maiestie. But
  it fareth with him as with the Sunne in those parts when it sets, it sinkes on
  the sudden, and it is instantly night: So when the Proude man fals, he fals
  suddenly,  and a present darkenesse ouerspreds his
  soule, beeing throwne headlong downe into the bottomelesse pit of Hell, where
  the blacke mantle of eternall darkenesse shall be cast ouer him.
               The third motiue (according to Petrus Crysologus) was
  couetousnesse of money: This (saith he) draue him out of his fathers doores,
  banished him from his Countrie, blotted his fame, and blemished his honour,
  left him naked &amp; poore, and made him submit himselfe to the basest seruice
  in the world. And this conceit hath in its fauour a verie forcible reason; for
  the libertie of Youth, though it would runne on to it's owne destruction, yet
  without money it is lame, it wants both it's hands and it's feet; and this
  defect doth detaine him, as a woodden clog doth a mad Bullocke. But when Youth
  shall be left to it's own swinge, and bee still supplied and fed with moneys,
  which are the instruments of mischiefe in il gouerned yeres; Who can restrain
  it, or what hand (though neuer so strong) hold it in?
               But to omit these and many other motiues elsewhere deliuered by
  vs; Clemens Alexandrinus saith, That one of the greatest affronts
  that Man can do vnto God, is, for to forgoe the comfort and libertie of his
  owne house, to follow the World, the Flesh, and the Deuill. Saint
  Augustine saith, That it is a woful thing, that all that should seeme
  honie to a man, which is offered him by the Deuil; and all that gall, which is
  profered him by God. It is a more naturall thing in the Creature, to obey their
  Creator, than to follow their owne proper inclination. The natural place of the
  water was to couer the earth, [Et aqua erant super faciem abissi] but
  God commanding them to retyre themselues, they did instantly obey his voyce.
  The libertie which the Angells enioy, is more perfect than that of man; yet
  cannot they diuert their will from the will of God. What saith Salomon? My
  sonne, receiue my councell, and hearken to the instruction that I shall giue
  thee; Put thy feet in Gods Stockes, clap his coller of yron about thy necke,
  let his linkes binde thy legs; for the more he shal lade thee with yrons, with
  gyu
                        •
                     s, and with fetters, the more
  free shalt thou liue, and more at libertie.
               
            
            
               
                  Diuisit illis substantiam, He diuided vnto them his
  substance.
               
                  Too much liberty the bane of
 youth.Here the Doctors and other learned Diuines make a doubt, How so
  wise and discreet a father could bee brought to fauour such an vnaduised
  longing, such a rash and inconsiderate course? A man would haue thought, that
  hee should rather haue crost, controlled, and hindered this his idle and giddie
  resolution. But to impart his substance to a yong man that had no gouernment of
  himselfe, and was so apt to vndoe himselfe, it seemeth somewhat strange.

                   saith, That a yong
  man ought to be harder tyed, and faster bound than a Beast; because for the
  most part he is more wild, more vnruly, and vntamable. And the Lawes, where
  Parents are wanting, tye Tutors and Guardians to haue a great care in
  preuenting those perills that are incident to Youth. A child set at
  libertie maketh his mother ashamed;

  it is Salomons. And Ecclesiasticus saith, Laugh not with
  thy son, le
                        •
                     t thou be sorie with
  him, and lest thou gnash thy teeth in the end. Giue him no libertie in his
  youth, and winke not at his follie: Bow downe his necke while he is young,
  &amp; beat him on the sides whilest he is a child, lest he wax stubborne, and
  be disobedient vnto thee, and so bring sorow to thine heart, &amp;c. Men ought
  to be verie circumspect in giuing too much licence and libertie to young
  Gentlemen whilest they are in the heat and furie of their youth, and that their
  wanton bloud boyleth in their veines. It is no wisdome in parents, to giue away
  their wealth from themselues,
                     Eccl. 33.20.
  and to stand afterwards to their childrens courtesie. Giue not away thy
  substance  to another, lest it repent thee; no, not to
  thine owne children: For better it is that thy children should pray vnto thee,
  than that thou shouldest looke vp to the hands of thy children. To this
  doubt, satisfaction hath formerly beene giuen by vs in a Discourse of ours
  vpon this same Parable: but that which now offers it selfe a fresh vnto vs, is
  That albeit the Father saw, that his libertie, his monys, &amp; his absence,
  would be his Sonnes vndoing; yet hee likewise saw his amendment, his
  repentance, and what a future warning this would be vnto him. And so hee chose
  rather to see him recouered after he was lost, than violently to detaine him,
  and to force him to keepe home against his will; which would bring forth no
  better fruits than lowring and grumbling. Saint Augustine saith, That
  it seemed a lesser euill to God, to redresse some euills, than not to permit
  any euill at all; Melius judicauit de malis benefacere, quam mala nulla
  esse permittere. God would not haue thee to sinne, neither can he be the
  Author of thy sinnes: but if men should not commit sinnes, Gods Attributes
  would lose much of their splendor. Saint Paul speaking of himselfe,
  saith, That God had forgiuen him, though he had beene a persecuter and
  blasphemer of his holy Name, &amp;c. And why did hee doe this? Vt
  ostenderet omnem patientiam &amp; gratiam; My sinnes (saith he) were the
  occasion that God pardoned me, and his pardoning of mee was the cause of the
  Worlds taking notice of his long suffering, and his great goodnesse. This may
  serue for a verie good instruction to those that are great Princes, and
  Gouernours of Commonwealths, and may teach them how to punish, and how to
  beare with their subiects; and it belongeth no lesse to the name of a good
  Gouernour, to tollerate with prudence, than to punish with courage. And
  Salomon giues thee this caueat,
                     Eccl.

                  When he had gathered all together. What a strange
  course was this that this young man ranne?
               First of all, hee leuelled all accounts with his father,
  shutting the doore after him to all hope of receiuing so much as one farthing
  more than his portion: If he had left some stocke behind him, that might haue
  holpe him at a pinch, if he should chance to miscarrie in this his journey,
  (for he was not sure that he should still hold Fortune fast by the wing) he had
  done well and wisely; but he made a cleane riddance of all, as well mooueables,
  as immooueables: Et congregatis omnibus, &amp;c.
               
               Secondly, What a foolish part was it in him, to leaue so good a
  Father, and so sweet and pleasant a Countrie, being both such naturall tyes of
  loue to Mans brest. The loue of a Father is so much indeered in Scripture, that
  great curses and maledictions are thundred out against vnlouing and vnkind
  childeren. And the loue of a mans Countrie is such a thing, (saith Saint
  Augustine) that God made choice to trie of what mettal
  Abraham was made, by such a new &amp; strange kind of torment, as to
  turne him out of his Countrie; Egredere de Terra tua, &amp; de Cognatione
  tua, Goe from thy Land, and from thy Kindred. Saint Chrysostome
  saith, That euen those Monkes which left the world for their loue to God, and
  to doe him seruice, did notwithstanding shew themselues verie sencible of their
  absence from their natiue soyle, and their fathers house. But those sorrowes
  and lamentations which the Children of Israell made when they were on their way
  to Babylon, indeere it beyond measure; If I forget thee, ô
  Ierusalem,
                  
                     Psal. 137. 
                  let my right
  hand forget her cunning; If I doe not remember thee, let my tongue cleaue to
  the roofe of my mouth; yea, if I prefer not Ierusalem in my mirth,
  &amp;c.
               
               
                  But much more fearefull is the resolution
  of this young man, in the thing that is signified thereby: To wit, That a
  Sinner shall so exactly summe vp all his reckonings with God, that he shall
  not haue any hope at all left him, neither in his life nor his death, of one
  onely dramme of mercie. There are some Sinners that giue their wealth to the
  World, but not all; some giue God their lips, but not their hearts; some, their
  memorie, but not their will; some, their will, but not their vnderstanding;
  some are dishonest, and yet Almesgiuers; some couetous, and yet deuout, like
  those Assyrians which liued in Samaria, who acknowledged God &amp; his Law,
  yet worshipped Idolls. But to giue all away, as the Prodigall did, is a
  desperate course.
               Besides, It is a miserable case, that this Prodigall should not
  bee sencible of leauing so good a Father as God, of renouncing so rich an
  Inheritance as Heauen, and of being banished for euer from so sweet and
  pleasant an habitation. But he is so blind, that he loueth darkenesse, and
  abhorres the light; which is a case so lamentable, that it made
  Ieremie to crie out, Obstupescite Coeli, Be amazed
  
                        〈◊〉
                      Heauens.
               
            
            
               Profectus est in Regionem longinquam
               
                  He tooke his journey into a farre Countrie. No man can
  flie from God, per distantiam loci, be the place neuer so farre off;
  no distance can bring vs out of his reach. If I ascend vp vnto Heauen, thou
  art there; if descend into Hell, thou art there also. And certainly if
  there were any one place free from his presence, all the Prodigals of the world
  would make that their Rendezuous, and liue there. Ionas flying from
  God, left the earth, and entred into the sea, where there were so many
  Serjeants waiting to arrest him, who tooke hold of him, and threw him into
  prison, that darke dungeon of the Whales bellie. So that there is not any thing
  (saith Anselmus) in the Concaue of Heauen, which can escape the eye
  of Heauen; no, though a man should flie from East to West, and from the South
  vnto the North. So this Prodigall, flying from his Fathers house, fell vpon a
  poore Farme, &amp; flying from Fulnesse, lighted vpon Hunger; and these were
  Gods executioners appointed to punish his follie.
               
                  To forget God, is to goe into a far
 cuntry.
                  Into a farre Countrie. He came to the Citie of
  Obliuion, whose Inhabitants are without number. Saint Augustine saith,
  Regio longinqua obliuio Dei est, This far Countrie is the forgetting of
  God, and he that in this kind is farre from him, is in no kind at all.
  Fame had presently blowne it ouer all the Countrie, that a young Gallant was
  newly come to towne, liberall, rich, and generous: Presently (as it is the
  custome of those that are in great Cities, as if some wonder had beene to be
  seene) they come as thicke vnto him as Bees come to honey. The third day after
  his comming thither, hee walkes the streetes, attended on by a companie of
  braue Poets, Musitions, Iesters, Gamesters, and Vnthrifts; they carrie him to a
  Dicing house, anon after to a Whore house, (for these two are neuer far
  asunder) where hee enters into conuersation with women, whom the Holy-Ghost
  stiles Multiuolas, for the multitude of their longings, or for their
  many and diuers minds in desiring many things, wishing one while this; another,
  that: Who beeing (as Saint Bernard saith) more insatiable than Hell,
  are euermore a crying, (like the daughters of the Horse-leech)
  Affer,
                  
                     Prou. 3. 
                  affer, Bring,
  bring. He was willing on the one side to shew himselfe franke and free;
  but on the other, the thirst of these Horse-leeches was greater than his Purse
  was able to satisfie. At last his money was all spent and gone, and impawning
  his apparell piece after piece, hee was in the end left bare and naked.
            
            
               
               Eratfames valida in Terra, &amp; ipse caepit egere.
               
                  Now, when he had spent all, there arose a great Dearth
  throughout that La
                        •
                     d, and hee began
  to be in necessitie. It so fell out, that it was a hard yeare, whereupon
  he began to suffer hunger, pouertie, and extreame want. There was no such
  necessity that this should haue prooued so hard a yeare vnto him▪ for, a
  prouident man would haue prouided for a deere yeare; well, for want of that, he
  sees himselfe now in want. Whilest Sampson had his strength about him,
  hee was courted by Dalida, and shee made much loue vnto him; but when
  shee found that his force failed him, she began to vexe him and to mocke at
  him:

                   and when shee had her purpose she cared not a pin for him.
  Whilest Dauid was quiet in his Kingdome, Shimei durst neuer
  reuile him; but he no sooner saw him flie from Ierusalem halfe naked, and with
  one shooe off (as they say) and another on, but that this his rancor brake
  forth, which durst neuer shew it selfe before: And making post hast, he hies
  him out of the Citie after him, and there before all the people, venting the
  gall of his long conceiued malice, hee falls a rayling most bitterly against
  him. I am poore and wretched: (Marke I pray,
                     Psal. 38. what followes) My Louers and my
  Neighbours did stand looking vpon my trouble, and my Kinsemen stood afarre
  off. Many stood looking on him, but none would come in to helpe him. Those
  friends which before made great reckoning of Iob, when they saw him
  sitting on the Dunghil, they began to scorne and despise him. Those Princes
  that were confederate with Ierusalem, forsooke her in her affliction, and left
  her all alone. Philon reporteth, That the Samaritans whilest the
  Iewes were in prosperitie stucke verie close vnto them, and esteemed of them as
  of their friends and Kinsemen. Art thou greater than our Father Iacob?
  said the Samaritane woman; calling Iacob Father, as long as the Iewes
  power and prosperitie lasted; but no sooner downe the wind, but they wind their
  neckes out of the coller, acknowledging neither friendship nor kindred. Of
  those Fishes which they call Vigiliales, your Naturalists doe report,
  That when the Starres are cleere, and shine bright, they come and skip and play
  aboue water, seeming therein to applaud their beautie, and to sooth and flatter
  them; but when they are dimme and darke, they likewise hide their heads and get
  them gone. Of your Batts or Reare-mice (as some cal them) Fables report, That
  when the Birds came to demaund tribute of them, shewing them their brests, they
  sayd they were Beasts; And when the Beasts came to them, &amp; craued the like,
  shewing their wings▪ they pleaded they were Birds. In a word,
  Quicke-siluer, which is such a profest friend vnto Gold, flies from it in the
  Crysole. All flie from the Crysole of pouertie, they will not indure to come to
  the melting pot, that is too hot a triall for them. Martial said of
  Homer, That if he brought nothing along with him but the Muses, hee
  should haue Tom Drummes entertainement, and be shut out of doores.
  Your Whore, if you haue no money in your purse wil bid you be gone; No penie
  (sayth the Prouerbe) no Pater-noster. The Prodigall now sees himselfe naked and
  hungrie, and what shift to make he knowes not; for, after a fulnesse comes a
  Famine, and after brauerie, beggerie, especially when men will wilfully cast
  themselues into it when they need not. For he (God be thanked) was well, had he
  had the grace to know when he was wel. And therefore saith
  Malachie,

  despised and vile before all the people.
               
            
            
               
               Adhaesit vni Ciuium.
               
                  He went and 
                        •
                     laue to a Citisen of that Countrie, &amp;c. He was now driuen
  to seeke out a Master, and forced to serue, out of pure hunger: It was his hap
  to light vpon a cruell Snudge, a hard hearted Tyrant, who sent him to a Farme
  house that he had in the Countrie, to keepe Swine; where hee faine would, but
  could not fill his bellie with that feeding which was flung out to the Pigges.
  This was a verie miserable change: But God many times deales thus with his
  vntoward Children, that they may see the difference that is betwixt Master and
  Master, House and House, Fare and Fare. God did deliuer Rehoboam King
  of Ierusalem, from the hands of Shi
                        •
                     hacke King of Aegypt;3. Reg.
 14. but suffered him to bee his Tributarie, that he might make triall
  of the difference, that was from subiection to subiection. God said to his
  People, I will that ye go downe into Aegypt, that ye may see what it is to
  serue me, &amp; what Pharaoh▪ Petrus Chrys. tels thee, That in
  thy Fathers house thou inioiest a sweet kind of life, a free seruitude, a
  ioyful feare, a rich pouertie, a safe possession, a quiet conscience, and a
  holy fulnesse; As for labour and paines taking (if there bee any) that is put
  to thy Fathers account. But this thy felicitie goes further than so:
  Salomon throughout all the third Chapter of his
  Prouerbs,
                  
                     Prou. 3. goes promising
  blessings to a wise and obedient Sonne; threatning many euills to come vpon
  that child that shall be crosse and vntoward to his Parents. As a long and
  prosperous life hath fauor both with God and Men, health, fulnesse, Barnes
  filled with aboundance, Presses that shal burst with new Wine; summing there vp
  all possible and imaginable felicitie. But otherwise goes it with those that
  are peruerse and disobedient: Chrysologus sets them forth in the
  Prodigall, and reduceth them all to his turning Swineheard.
               Our Sauiour Christ stiles Sinners with the name of Swine: And
  this name doth more particularly appertaine to those that are sensuall persons.
  The proportions are many.
               First of all, Any other Creature whatsoeuer is made tame &amp;
  gentle, but the swine not; in any other there is taken some pleasure or
  affection, but in the Swine not; any other will acknowledge the hand that feeds
  him, but the Swine neuer; it is the stampe of an obstinate, harsh, vnsauorie,
  and desperate sinner.
               Secondly, In touching a Hogs either bristles or skinne, hee
  presently falls a grunting, as Geminianus hath noted it. A Horse will
  suffer you to curry his coat, and to kembe downe his mayn; there are many other
  beasts that will giue a man leaue to handle &amp; stroke them; but the Hog is
  no sooner toucht but he whines, and the reason is, because there is nothing
  either of profit or pleasure in him, saue his flesh: so that when you offer to
  lay hand on him, he presently conceiues that you meane to kill him. This is the
  picture of a Sinner that hath a guiltie conscience, who being scarce toucht,
  not with the whole hand, but the least and lightest finger of Gods justice,
  presently apprehends he is but a dead man.
               Thirdly, Your Swine, especially your wilde Bores, are of that
  strange quicknesse of sent, that if the Huntsman meane to shoot at him, he
  must take the wind of him, or else he will wind him out and be gone. Now on the
  contrarie, they are not sencible of the ill sauour of a Dunghill, nor the
  stench of mud and mire, but rather take delight to lie wallowing therein,
  esteeming it as a great recreation and refreshing vnto them. This is the figure
  of a filthie foule Sinner, who will flie a thousand leagues from the perills
  and dangers of his bodie, but take pleasure and pastime in those muckhills and
  durtie puddles which defile the Soule. And these kind of creatures your
  Worldlings cal their loue, their joy, their comfort  and
  delight. But Gods Dictionary termes them, the loathsome sweetnesses and
  perbreaking pleasures ofSwine.
               Fourthly, In point of stinking nastinesse, and all kind of
  beastly filthinesse, a Swine is such a filthie thing, that a slouenly fellow we
  commonly call him Puerco, a verie Swine.
               
                  He would faine haue filled his bellie with the husks that
  the Swine eat, but no man gaue them him. There are many Pictures and
  Tables in Scripture, in the Saints,
  
                     〈◊〉
                   in the Doctors, of the
  foulenesse and miserie of a Man without God. Saint Gregorie compares
  him to a World without a Sunne, couered with thicke Clouds; to a bodie without
  a soule, which though it be neuer so faire, yet is it fearefull to behold.

  than this slouenly, filthie, loathsome, hunger-starued, weake, tawnie,
  stinking young man, whose bodie was growne ouer with haire, as a tree with
  mosse; whose face was scort

  that he had to his backe, were all totterd and torne with creeping through the
  bushes of the Mountaine, heere hanging one piece, and there another. Himselfe
  beheld himselfe in that puddled water where the Swine dranke, and did not know
  himselfe: And no meruaile, seeing his Father that created him did not know him,
  hee was so changed and altered from that he was. All these are Types and
  shadowes of a man without God: And I call them shadowes, for in truth neither
  these, nor many other the like indeerings can expresse them to the full.
               One of the greatest martyrdomes that a man can suffer in this
  world, is,No miserie so great, but sin will reduce vs vnto
 it. To serue a base Moore, that shall imploy him in beating of hempe, in
  grinding in a Mill, in making Broomes, in rubbing Horses heeles, and digging vp
  roots of Thistles, whereof he must bee content to make his meales. But none of
  these is so base an office as the keeping of a Hog-stie; and God brought this
  Prodigal to this miserie, to the end that the remembran
                     •
                  e of his former happinesse might amase and confound him.
  According to that of Ieremie,

                  All that forsake thee shal be confounded. And of Dauid,
  Qui elongant se à te, peribunt. All such Prodigals as these shall
  remaine confounded and abashed, and shall vtterly perish, continuing in their
  sinnes. Yet there is in sinne (if a man may so terme it) some kind of good, in
  regard that those miseries which it bringeth with it, doth awaken and rouse a
  man from sleepe. And as the Cough of the lungs is eased with a clap on the
  back, so is the sinners heart, when Sinne hammers vpon it.
               
                  He came to himselfe. Saint Ambrose sayth, That
  sinne doth not onely seperate the sinner from God, but also from himselfe.
  Chrysologus, daintily toucheth vpon the same string, Cum recessit
  à patre (saith hee) recessit à se, &amp;c. When he
  departed from his father, he departed from himselfe; Leauing to bee man, he
  came to bee a beast;  And that he might come to his
  father, hee comes first to himselfe. There are some transformations,
                     Psal. 32. that none can make, but Sinne, and
  Grace. Dauid, treating of the pardon of his sinnes, sayth. Blessed
  is he, whose vnrighteousnesse is forgiuen, and whose sinne is couered. Blessed
  is the man, vnto whom the Lord imputeth no sinne. Praising God in that
  Psalme, for hauing restored his vnderstanding vnto him. So S. Ierome
  expounds it. And albeit all sinnes doe robbe a man of his vnderstanding,
  
                     〈◊〉
                   doth alienate and estrange a
  sinner from himselfe; yet dishonesty doth this more than all the rest.
  Salomon, treating of the tyranny of a Whoore, sayth, That shee is like
  a Theefe, which lyes in waite in the way, to set vpon carelesse men, and kill
  them ere they are aware. Et quos incautos viderit, interficit. A
  theefe dares not set vpon him that goes well accompanied, or that hath his
  pistolls at his Saddlebow, and is well prouided for him. The Deuill sets vpon
  vs with the inticements of the flesh; against these allurements, wee must arme
  our selues with prayer, fasting, &amp; mortification. But the carelesse man
  which lyes open, and offers himselfe euery moment to al occasions of sinning,
  that man he either robs, or kils, if not both; and leaues him so wholly besides
  himselfe, that hee shall see the losse of his substance, of his honour, and of
  his health, with loathsome diseases; that he shall see himselfe despised,
  murmured at, pried into, and made the common byword of the Citie wherein he
  dwels, and shall not bee sencible of the harme that hangeth ouer his head. And
  therefore Saint Paul preacheth vnto vs, Mortifie your members
  which are vpon the Earth, fornication, vncleanenesse, &amp;c. For which the
  wrath of God commeth vpon the children of vnbeliefe. Another letter reads
  of Disobedience, For Dishonestie (as Thomas hath obserued) doth in
  such sort harden and obdurate the soule, that it will neither heare
  admonitions, nor obey any counsell. And therefore (sayth Osee)
  They will not giue their mindes to turne vnto their God;
                  
                     Ose. 5.4. 
                  for the spirit of fornication is in
  the midst of them.
               
            
            
               Surgam, &amp; ibo ad Patrem meum.
               
                  I will rise, and goe to my father. He resolued with
  himselfe to rise, For the posture of a sinner,The posture
 of a sinner is to lye groueling. is jacere, To lye downe. The
  iust shall rise, but the sinner shall lye groueling on the ground. Non
  resurgent impij in iudicio, The wicked shall not rise in iudgement. It is
  true that all men shall rise, but the wicked non stabunt in iudicio,
  they shall not be able to stand to it, when they come to their triall, but shal
  hang the head. Petrus Chrysologus, paraphrasing those words of the
  Centurion, Puer meus iacet; sayth that our Sauiour did controlle this
  his speech, and that he sayd not well in saying, Puer meus, My boy lyes
  sicke. Whereunto he shapeth this answer for him, Meus est, quia iacet,
  si tuus esset, non iaceret, Hee is mine, because he lyes; were he thine, he
  should not lye as he doth. There are many places of Scripture that proue
  and make good these two phrases of speech. And this very place confirmeth vnto
  vs, that sinne is called a lying, or a falling; and righteousnesse a rising, or
  a standing.
               
                  I will rise and goe to my Father. Two Motiues, might
  put him vpon this determination.
               The one, His hunger, and the extreame want wherein he was. For
  albeit, it be a common saying, Que la pobreza, no es vileza; That it
  is no shame to be poore. Yet hunger is so sharpe set, and of that strength and
  force, that it will breake through stone-walls; it not onely shakes off
  sloathfulnesse, but aduentures vpon all difficulties, be they neuer so
  desperate. Valerius Maximus sayd, That her Lawes, were cruell Lawes:
  because they prohibit nothing. And if hunger put spurs to her heeles, for to
  commit such great cruelties, as to force Mothers to
  
                     〈◊〉
                   
                   their
  owne children, she will vse sharper rowells to atchiue things that are lawfull
  and honest. As to spurre on this Prodigall, to returne home to his fathers
  house. And necessitie doth not onely open mans eyes, but also mooues Gods
  bowells to compassion of his wretched case. Da nobis auxilium de
  tribulatione, Affoord vs ô Lord, that fauour, which riseth from
  tribulation. And I say, which riseth, because his eye is euer waighting
  on those that are in affliction.
               The other, His calling to mind of his former felicitie.The remembrance of fore-passed felicity, a great means to bring
 vsto Repentance. Saint Austen weigheth with himselfe, how much
  it importeth a man, to haue beene bred vp in Vertue in the tender yeares of his
  youth: for liuing afterwards amidst the thornes and bryers of sinne, it pricks
  him vp to a remembrance of that quietnesse of conscience, which hee inioyed
  before hee became sinn's slaue. And when God preserues a sinner in his sinne,
  and forbeares to punish him according to his ill deseruings, it ought to bee a
  great motiue vnto him, to make him to leaue it. It is a case worthy great
  admiration, that in that so generall a destruction which the Babilonians made
  in Ierusalem, burning their houses, pillaging their goods, and taking their
  liues from them, yet they should leaue those captiuated Cittisens, those
  instruments, wherewith they were woont to serue their God in his Temple. Saint
  Ierome, and Saint Basil are of opinion, That this was an
  especiall prouidence, and dispensation of God, that in this their banishment,
  they should conserue the memorie of their fore-passed mirth and melody; that
  being prouoked therby to greater sorrow, they might bewaile their sins, &amp;
  recouer some hope of their restoration. And the recordation of our lost good,
  is not only a great helpe to make man to returne againe vnto himselfe, but also
  to moue God to take compassion of him. Thou findest thy selfe so ouerburthened
  with the weight of thy sins, that thou art in a manner quite deiected with
  them; but for al this, be not put out of heart, but call to mind, that God was
  thy Father, and the Captaine and Leader of thee foorth in thy youth, and thy
  first Loue and delight. And therefore, Amodo voca me, Hencefoorth call
  vpon him. And no doubt but in doing so, Gods bowels of compassion will
  show themselues tender vnto thee.
               
                  I will goe to my Father, and say, I haue sinned against
  Heauen, &amp;c. Hee resolues to craue helpe of him whome hee had offended;
  like vnto your Magot-a-pyes,Confession in Gods Court, the
 onely way to Absolution. who being pursued by the Hawke, flye for succor
  to the Faukener, seeking shelter from him. So Samuel aduised the
  people, when they had offended God, Vos fecistis malum grande, Ye haue
  committed a great euill, yet neuerthelesse depart not from the Lord. If
  God be angry with thee, make him propitious to thee, not by flying from him,
  but by flying to him.
            
            
               Peccaui in Caelum.
               He sayes, That he had sinned against Heauen. More for
  that it was a witnesse against him, than for any harme that he had receiued
  from thence. For in your earthly Tribunals, with indearing our faults, we
  oftentimes increase our punishments; but in that of heauen, the more the
  delinquent condemnes himselfe, the more he doth lessen his punishment. The
  reason is, for that sinne may be considered two manner of wayes.
               Either, as it is an offence against an infinite Goodnesse.Sinne is an offenceto God &amp; a wound to our owne
 Soules.
               
               Or, as it is a wound, and miserie to our Soule.
               As it is an offence, it calls for justice, and incenseth Gods
  wrath against vs.
               As it is a wound, it mooueth him to mercie and to clemencie. And
  as the greatest misery causeth the greatest compassion; the more a Sinner doth
  aggrauat his sinne, the more he doth extenuate Gods anger, and worketh the more
  pittie in  him.
                     Psal.
 25.10. 
                  Dauid harpt vpon this string; For thy Names sake,
  ô Lord, be mercifull vnto my sin, for it is great; Lord, thy Mercie
  is aboue all thy Works; that the world should know thee by this name, is the
  greatest Attribute that thou takest delight in: for thy Names sake therefore
  let me beseech thee, that thou wilt haue mercie on my miserie, for it is
  exceeding great.
               
                  Make me one of thy hired Seruants. Gilbertus the Abbot
  saith, That these were verie humble and submissiue thoughts, as he was a Sonne,
  but somewhat too affronting for so free and liberal a Father: say his
  deseruings were neuer so poore, neuer so meane, such weake hopes, and such a
  base opinion could not but bee a great iniurie to so good and gratious a
  Father. Gregorie Nazianzen saith of him, Others cannot receiue
  more willingly, than he giues cheerefully. To the Couetous and to the
  Needy, there is not any content comparable to that of receiuing; yet greater
  is the contentment which God taketh in giuing. He reuealed to Abraham
  his purposed punishment vpon Sodome, and onely because he should beg and
  intreat for their pardon: and this Patriarke was sooner wearie in suing, than
  God in granting. And if God did demand his Sonne of him, it was not with an
  intent to haue him sacrifice him, (for hee diuerted that Sacrifice) but to take
  occasion thereby to giue him a type of the offering vp of his owne Sonne:
  giuing a shadow of desert to that which came not within the compasse of
  desert. What says the Abbot Guaricus? He that gaue his sonne for the
  redeeming of Prodigalls, What can he denie vnto them.Gods
 bountie often causeth our neglect. God is so liberall (saith
  Tertullian) that hee loseth thereby much of his credit with vs: for,
  the World gaines a great opinion, when with a great deale of leisure, and a
  great deale of difficultie, it slowly proceeds in doing good; but God, he
  loseth this respect through his too much facilitie and frankenesse in his
  doing of his courtesies. The Gentiles (saith this learned Doctor) judging of
  Faith by outward appearances, could not be persuaded that such facile and mean
  things in outward shew, could inwardly cause such supernaturall effects, and
  such diuine Graces, as in that blessed Sacrament of Baptisme.
               
                  When he was yet a great way off, &amp;c. The Prodigall
  desired that his Father would intertaine him into his seruice as an hired
  seruant; and hee had no sooner sight of him, but he ran with open armes to
  receiue him, and was so ouerioyed to see him, and made him that cheere, that
  the Prodigall knew not how now to vnfold his former conceiued words. Saint
  Iohn in forme of a Citie saw that coelestiall Ierusalem; and saith,
  That it had twelue gates, and in each of them an Angell; which did typifie two
  things vnto vs:
               The one, That the gates were open.
               
                  The Angells reioyce at our comming vnto
 Heauen.The other, That the Angells shewed the content they tooke in
  expecting our comming to Heauen. When thou doost not like of a guest, thou wilt
  get thee from the doore; but if thou loue him, thou wilt hast thither to
  receiue him. But this his father did more; for he no sooner spied his sonne
  afarre off, but he hasted out of his house to imbrace him, &amp; presently puts
  him into a new suit of cloaths, that others might not see how totterd and torne
  he was returned home. But God went a step further than all this, for hee
  repaires to him to the Pigges-stie to put good thoughts into his head. Loue
  vseth to make extraordinarie haste in relieuing the wants of those persons
  whom wee loue. And forasmuch as God loueth more than all the Fathers besides in
  the world, hee made greater hast than any other Father could. Inclinauit
  C
                        •
                     elos &amp; descendit, Hee bowed
  the Heauens and came downe; That he might not detaine himselfe in
  descending, he made the heauens to stoope. Salomon saith of
  Wisedome, That none shall preuent her diligence and 
   care; Though he rise neuer so early to seeke her, a man
  shall alwayes find her sitting at his doore. Assidentem enim illam foribus
  tuis inuenies. So it is with God, he is still readie at hand to helpe vs,
  wee no sooner seeke him, but he is found. Lord, for thy mercie sake, preuent vs
  still with thy louing kindnesse, and by bringing vs to a true acknowledgement
  of our sins, lead vs the way to life euerlasting.
            
         
         
            THE EIGHTEENTH SERMON, VPON THE THIRD SVNDAY IN LENT.
            
               
                  LVC. II. 
                  
                     Erat Iesus eijciens Daemonium.
                   
                  And Iesus was casting out a Deuill, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               IN this Gospell is contained that famous Miracle of one that was
possessed with a Deuill, beeing deafe, blind, and dumbe. As also the applause
of the People, the calumnie and slander of those Pharisees, who did attribute
it to the power of Belzebub. Our Sauiours defending himselfe with
strong &amp; forcible reasons. The good old woman who blessed the wombe that
bore our Sauiour, and the Paps that gaue him sucke. Whose name was
Marcella: With whom the fruit of this Miracle endeth.

                        •
                     e must vntie
 the Deuills knots▪
                   is a worke so sole and proper to Gods
  omnipotencie, that if the Deuills malice had not intangled the World therewith,
  Gods goodnesse had not come to vnknit it. And this I hold to be sound
  Diuinitie.
               First, Because it is the opinion of the most antient and grauest
  Doctors.
               Secondly, For those places of Scripture it hath in it's fauour.
  As that of Esay, Is it a small thing, that thou shouldest be my Seruant to
  raise vp the Tribes of Iacob,
                  
                     Esay 49.
                  and to restore the desolations of Israel? But Saint Iohn doth
  expresse this more plainly; Christ came into the world to this end, that
  he might destroy the workes of the Deuil, 
                   Now
  Dissoluere is properly, to vndo a deceit that is wrought; Dissolue
  colligationes impietatis, Cancell those Obligations, Bonds, Schedules,
  &amp; Acknowledgments, which thou hast vniustly drawne thy Creditours to set
  their hands thereunto. Omnem Cautionem fals
                        •
                     m (saith Symmachus) disrumpe: The Septuagint read it,
  Omnem Scripturam iniquam: Saint Hierome, Chirographa. And to
  the end that the drift of this Language may be the better vnderstood; it is to
  be noted, That a man when he sinnes, sells himselfe to the Deuill; making this
  sale good vnder his owne hand writing. The Deuill, hee buyes; and the Man, he
  sells; and the Damned confesse as much in Hell; Wee haue driuen a bargaine
  with Death, and haue made a couenant with Hell. And if the Deuill had
  proceeded herein fairely &amp; honestly, and according to Law and Iustice,
  this knot would hardly haue beene vnknit: but for that he is a Father of
  falsehood, of deceit, and of cosinage, there are three great annullities to be
  found in this his Contract.
               First, An enormious &amp; excessiue losse; buying that Soule for
  little or nothing, which cost an infintte price; Gratis venundati
  estis.
               
               Secondly, A notorious cosinage; in that he promised that which
  hee was not able to performe; Sicut Dij.
               
               Thirdly, Mans being vnder yeares; it beeing a ruled Case, That
  any such sale, without the consent of the Guardian, is of no validitie in Law:
  And that too, must be for the benefit of the Ward.
               Fourthly, That he that inhabits another mans house, if he vse
  the same amisse, the Law takes order that he bee turned out of it. Now, the
  Deuill inhabiting this house of man, makes a dunghill thereof, and besides,
  payes no rent for it: to the Bodie, Fastings are payable; to the Soule,
  Prayers; to the Goods, Almes: and these debts, are so many darts in the Deuills
  sides.
               It did belong therefore to our Sauiour Christ, as being our
  elder brother, and the Guardian of our Soules, to disanull this sale. Saint
  Paul saith, That whatsoeuer act Adam had done, as the chiefe
  head and principall root of Mankind, our Sauiour Christ had now cancelled the
  same vpon the Crosse,
                     Coloss. 2.14.
                  Putting out the hand writing of Ordinances that was against vs; which was
  contrarie vnto vs, he euen tooke it out of the way, and fastned it vpon the
  Crosse. And for as much as euerie man through his manifold sinnes sells
  himselfe ouer and ouer to the Deuill, not once, but many times; it was fitting
  that our Sauiour Christ should as often blot and cancell this bill, and make it
  to be of none effect. And here saith our Euangelist, Erat Iesus eijciens
  Daemonium, Iesus was casting forth a Deuill. This word Erat
  implying the difficultie of getting him out, as also the long time of his
  continuance there.
            
            
               Erat Iesus eijciens Daemonium.
               
                  Diuersreasons, why Christ paused vpon the
 casting out of this Deuill.Christ did not presently cast out this
  Deuil, but stayed and paused a while vpon the matter; shewing thereby, that it
  was not so easie a thing to bee done as some thought it to be, but rather full
  of difficultie. What, can there bee any difficultie for God to doe? Is it
  possible that any thing should seeme hard vnto him? The Saints of God, and
  learned Doctours of the Church, render some reasons thereof on our part, some
  on the Deuills, and some on our Sauiour Christs.
               On our part, God hauing free and absolute power ouer our Will,
  Who is able to oppugne his omnipotency?On our
 part. When Lucifer, &amp; his followers playd the Rebels in
  Heauen, it seeming to God too base an Office to punish them by his owne person,
  he commanded Saint Michaell the Arch-Angell, that hee should throw 
   them thence like thunderbolts. These Deuills, beeing
  thus tumbled downe headlong from that so high a Tower, they sought out another
  stronger hold wherein to defend themselues, which was Man; and making
  themselues masters of this Fort, they made fast the Windowes, and the Doores,
  shutting close the Eyes, Eares, and Mouth of Man. God himselfe in our person,
  laboured to put them out. But Man, abusing that libertie which God hath left
  vnto him, &amp; resigning it vp into the Deuills hands, is the onely cause
  that they maintaine and defend this Fort against God. Gregorie
  Nazianzen saith, That wee play the Traytors, and conspire against God,
  against his Crosse, and against his Bloud, by selling our selues dayly anew
  vnto the Deuill. Our Sauiour Christ had payd the ransome for all our sinnes
  vpon the Crosse, tearing that our handwriting &amp; obligation in pieces,
  which we had made ouer to the Deuil. But we, as if we repented our selues
  thereof, make him a new bond, and bind our selues anew vnto him; Which is a
  great basenesse in Man. Wilt thou receiue an Apostata, a Traitour, a Fugitiue,
  and one that is condemned for euer to the Gallies? There is no Inne halfe so
  vile, or so bad as thy Soule. For, if this harbour a theefe, or a murderer, or
  a robber on the highway-side, it is vpon hope of profit: But thou doost not
  onely giue him entertainement, but also spendest thy purse vpon him, and doost
  protect and abett him against God. So that God hath a great deale more to doe
  with poore silly Man, being but as a worme of the earth, than with the greatest
  Deuill in Hell.
               There is also another reason on our part; To wit, The so often
  repeating of our sins ouer and ouer, their antient standing, and their
  spreading (like a Cancker) still farther &amp; farther vpon our soules;
  Insomuch, that it will find God worke, &amp; cannot chuse but cost him much
  labor. And the sores of our sins may be in that desperat case, that he is not
  able to cure them by ordinary means, but must vse therin some great and strange
  Miracle. Thou puttest foorth to Sea, thou saylest in the same ship with another
  passenger, thy friend and acquaintance, ye Cabbin togegether, eat together,
  and sleepe together, continuing in this louing league of friendship, some six
  moneths or more. Thou boordest thy selfe with thy neighbour, liuest vnder the
  same roofe with him some thirty yeares and vpwards, and all this while ye
  continue verie good freinds. Sure it must be a very great occasion that must
  part yee twaine, and either coole, or blot out this your so long grounded
  affection. But, if besides this tye of friendship, thou take extraordinary
  contentment in it, there is no gaine-saying of it. Such a one, thou art wont to
  say; she is my Life, my Soule, my deere Heart, deerer vnto mee than mine owne
  eyes. Though thou hast liued thus and thus many yeares, and so much to thy
  content and delight in conuersation and friendship with the Deuil, &amp; though
  I must confesse, it is a hard matter to come off handsomely from him, yet God
  hath wrought thy freedom, but at a great price, and hath brought thee off
  cleere but with much paine. But let me tell thee withall, that when thy
  demoniated soule, shall place all it's whole pleasure and delight in the Deuils
  company, make him her best beloued, &amp; hug him in her armes, and spred out
  the lappet of her garment for him; then shal it be in my Letanie, Lord haue
  mercie vpon thee. For when sinne growes to that height, it is almost out of
  reach, to doe any good vpon it. Pope Clement saith of Simon
  Magus, that he could not be cu
                     •
                  ed, Quia voluntarie agr
                        •
                     tabat, Because he was willing to be sicke. And that his soule
  had made such an inseperable knot with the Deuill, Que quien le apartara,
  le matara, That he that should pull him from him, must pull away life and soule
  together. Saint Marke tels vs, That his Disciples being not able
  to dispossesse a young man of the Deuill,  they brought
  him to our Sauiour Christ. And hee demaunding of them that brought him vnto
  him, how long he had beene tormented with him; They answered, From his
  childhood. Our Sauiour healed him; But I remember the Text sayes, Factus
  est sicut mortuus, ita vt multi dicerent, quia iam mortuus est, Hee was as one
  dead, in so much that many sayd, He is dead. This young man was so wedded
  to the Deuill, that many could not pull him from him; and being taken from the
  Deuill, he was as a dead man. He had kept him companie so long, that the Deuill
  was to him, as his life. And this is the marke of such persons as giue
  themselues ouer to the pleasures of this World: For liuing without them but
  three dayes in the Holy-weeke, they thinke themselues dead.
               
                  Reasons on the Deuils part.On
  the Deuils part, there are likewise many forcible reasons.
               First of all, This foule Fiend leaues a Soule so blind, so
  deafe, and so dumbe, that he doth not feele the hurt of so infamous a dwelling.
  And therefore the Church vseth to pray against the Spirit of Fornication.
  Seneca calls a woman, The Sepulchre of Vice; and there is no dumbe man
  so dumbe, nor no blind man so blind, as hee that lies dead in the Graue; nor no
  lesse blind and dumbe, as hee that is buried in the fond affection of a woman:
  Melior est iniquitas viri, quam benefaciens mulier. Thy enemie will doe
  thee lesse harme than thy Mistresse: The worst that he can doe, is to kill
  thee and take away thy life; but she will take from thee thy goods, thy life,
  and thy soule. Dauid giuing thankes vnto God for freeing him from his
  former troubles,
                     Psal. 126. sayd,
  Dirupisti Domine vincula mea, Thou hast broken, ô Lord, my bonds in
  sunder. What bonds were those? Ecclesiasticus answers,
  Vincula sunt manus illis, The embracements of a woman. And in another
  place hee saith, Eruisti animam meam ex inferno inferiori, Thou hast
  brought my soule out of the lowermost Hell.
                  
                     Psal. 86. It seemeth that he stileth this
  lowermost Hel, his Adulterie: and that this should bee the sence of it, there
  is great reason for it; for that is the lowermost Hell from whence God
  (speaking according to our vnderstanding) can draw a man out with greatest
  difficultie. For though God could with a great deale of ease haue taken
  Iudas out of the Hell of the Damned, yet hee could nor but by some
  extraordinarie meanes, feteh him from the Hell of his treason. Iob
  jumping vpon this conceit, drawes his comparison from the hard labour of a
  woman in trauell; Obstetricante manu eius, eductus est coluber
  tortuosus. Wherein we are to consider the diligences which a Midwife
  vseth, when that which is to be borne, comes athwart, &amp; crosses nature in
  it's common course: but what a doo would there be, if this birth should prooue
  to be a Snake or a Serpent?
               Secondly, The difficultie lies not so much in the Deuills
  strength, as in his subtiltie.
                     Gen. 3.
                  Erat Serpens calidior omnibus animalibus terrae. He doth not say he
  was stronger, but subtiler: For, to hunt in thicke and bushie Mountaines, we
  had need of more trickes and deuices, than if we did hunt in an open and
  champian Countrie: We must haue good store of weapons, ginnes, nets, and
  Ferrets, which may creepe in without any noyse. Ipse liberauit me de laqueo
  venancium. The Apocalyps paints out the Deuill in the forme of a
  Locust,
                     Apoc. 9. but armed, hauing the face
  of a man, the haires of a woman, and the mouth of a Lyon. Hee compares him to a
  Locust, because he deuoures and destroyes all: His meanes, he maketh, Mans
  deceiuing, Womans inticing, and the Lyons crueltie.
               Thirdly, The difficultie likewise consisteth in the Deuills
  pertinacie and obstinacie, who neuer ceaseth to plie and importune thee: And
  if at any time thou make thy peace with God, the Deuill will not suffer it to
  last long; and conuerting it but into a truce for a time, he returnes backe
  againe to this cleane (as thou thinkest) swept house of thine: but the broome,
  through some default or other,  hath not swept away all
  the filth and the durt. The Deuill will leaue thee for a time, but like a fit
  of an Ague he will returne againe vnto thee. That Feauer is not perfectly cured
  that comes againe the third day; nor that house clean, where the durt stickes
  in the floore. He that onely ouercomes, and not kills his enemy, cannot rest
  secure, especially where there is an impossibilitie of peace. The Deuill being
  ouercome, growes more fierce than before; What will hee doe then if he take
  thee vnprouided? That Soldier which whilest the warre lasts leaueth off his
  Armes, and carelessely walkes vp and downe; such occasions may offer themselues
  vnto him, that he may too late repent him of his follie. That valiant Captaine
  Ehud, mentioned in the booke of Iudges, feigned that he had
  something to impart to King Eglon in priuate; and they withdrawing
  themselues into a Sommer Parlor where they sate all alone, (there being warres
  betweene them at that time) putting forth his left hand, and taking a dagger
  from his right thigh, he thrust it into his bellie, and the haft entring in
  after the blade, it was buried in the fat that was about it. Whereas this King,
  had he done well, hee should not (considerng there was warre betweene them)
  haue gone disarmed. What saith Saint Paul vnto thee, Accipite
  Armaturam Fidei. Those weapons of Faith,
                     Ephes.
 6. together with it's Armour, are of more inchantment against Hell,
  than those which the Fables feigne to be wrought by Vulcan. That which
  imports a Christian, is neuer to goe without them, because he is in a
  continuall warfare.
               On Christs part there is also some difficultie,Reasons on Christs part. Iob 40.20. because this
  Victorie must bee performed with triumph. Iob discoursing of the
  Deuill, in that metaphor of the great Leuiathan; God said vnto him,
  Canst thou draw out Leuiathan with a hooke, and with a line which thou
  shalt cast downe vnto his tongue? Canst thou cast a hooke into his nose, canst
  thou pierce his jawes with an Angle? &amp;c. Thou wilt say, thou canst, but I
  hardly beleeue it. To conquer the Deuill thou wilt thinke it no great matter,
  and that the victorie is not so glorious as it makes shew for. Bee it so: but
  to fetter and manacle him in that manner that little children may play with him
  without any danger, this is something to the purpose. Vniuersa arma eius
  aufer in quibus confidebat: This is a taking away of his sword, and
  bea
                     •
                  ing him with the scabberd; than
  the which, nothing can bee a greater scorne vnto him. The Roman Emperours, for
  the better celebration of their victories with Triumphs, did much grieue in the
  deaths of those whome they had conquered. Marcellus sorrowed for the
  death of Archimides; Caesar, for that of Cleopatra, because
  it seemed to be an eclipse to the glorie of their triumphs. But it was fitting
  that our Sauiour Christ should bee partaker of this glorie, and enioy so
  glorious a Triumph; Expolians Principatus &amp; potestates traduxit
  confidenter; Palam triumphans illos in semetipso.
               
            
            
               
                  Et illud erat mutum, And that was dumbe.
               Saint Luke makes him dumbe; Saint Mathew,
  blind:
                     Luc. 11. Mat. 12. And from
  his dumbnesse those that comment thereupon inferre his deafnesse. Saint
  Chrysostome, Tertullian, and Saint Hierome say, That the
  Hebrew word Cophos signifyeth Dumbe and deafe; and our Interpreter
  translates it in the seuenth of Marke, Surdum &amp; mutum. To
  Tytus Bostrensis, Lyra, and Euthimius, it seemeth that hee
  was not deafe, for that his dumbenesse not being naturall, the Deuill might
  make him dumbe, but not deafe, leauing him his hearing for his greater
  torment.
               
                  And that was dumbe. He being both blind, and deafe,
  Saint Luke makes mention, that he was onely dumbe. Which he purposely
  did (as Saint Austen hath obserued) to signe out vnto vs the greatest
  ill that could befall him. For, as long  as a sinner hath
  a tongue, he need not to despaire. Iob beeing become as it were a
  Sieue vpon the dunghill, could yet make this boast, Derelicta sunt
  tantummodo labia circa dentes meos, Onely my lips are left about my teeth.
  This onely was enough to bring the Prodigall againe to prosperitie: When he had
  spent all, yet his tongue was left free vnto him, to say, I will goe vnto
  my Father. And this is sufficient, for to repaire thy losses. Your dumbe
  men being desirous to speake, multiply signes and gestures, esteeming their
  dumbnesse their greatest vnhappinesse. A Christian being askt, Hearest thou
  Sermons, giuest thou almes, loosest thou those that are in bonds, clothest thou
  the naked, &amp;c. He answered, Yes. But doost thou confesse thy sinnes? To
  that he said, No. This, of all other miseries is the greatest. O Lord (saith
  he) it were a great shame vnto me, that I should reueale that to Man, which I
  would (if I could) conceale from God. But Ecclesiastic
                        ••
                     
                   answereth hereunto, That there is a shame, that
  bringeth sinne with it; And there is a shame, which bringeth Grace and Glorie.
  The Theefe, hee confesses his offence, he is ashamed thereat, and curses the
  father that begot him. The repentant sinner, he likewise confesses his faults,
  and is ashamed that hee should so offend his Creator; but withall, remaines
  comforted with the hope of his Grace and of his Glory.Without confession no true comfort. And no doubt, where
  there is a true confession of our sins, experience teacheth vs, that God there
  dwelleth and abideth in vs. For otherwise it were not possible that a sinner
  should bee at quiet in his conscience. And therefore the Counsell of Trent
  saith, that shame of our sinnes were a great confounding vnto vs, if it were
  not quickned and heartned vp with the comfort of Grace. Osee makes a
  comparison of an vntoward daughter, yet somewhat shamefac't withall, who couers
  her being with child, with the name of oppilations and obstructions; but being
  put hard vnto it, and throughly examined by her Mother, shee confesseth the
  truth, that there may bee some course taken to salue her credit; swearing and
  forswearing before, that there was no such matter, and cursing her selfe to the
  pit of Hell: but the day comes at last, wherein the treading of her shooe awry,
  is discouered to those of the house, and without doores,
                     Osee. 13. The Deuils craft is to shut vp our mouths from
 Confession. so her credit is crackt euer after as long as she liues.
  The iniquitie of Ephraim is bound vp, his sinne is hid. The sorrowes of a
  trauelling woman shall come vpon him. What a deale of confusion and shame
  shall he be free from, that shall confesse his fault? Saint
  Chrysostome saith, That God placeth shame, in sinne; and comfort, in
  confession. Whereas the Deuill, in sinne, placeth presumption; and and in
  confession, shame. Plutarch saith, That as a moderate shame, is a
  guard to innocencie, a wall to honestie, and a generall ornament to all the
  Vertues; so too much shame on the other side, is a spoile and ruine to them
  all. Saint Austen saith, That it is a foulenesse and weakenesse of our
  vnderstanding, that thou shouldst be ashamed to confesse that to one particular
  man in priuat, which peraduenture thou hast committed in the companie of many,
  and in the presence of a multitude. Amongst other imprecations which
  Iob hath against himselfe, this is one, Si abscondi peccatum,
  &amp;c. If I haue concealed, or kept secret my sinne. When the Deuill
  opened Adams mouth to eate the Apple, hee did likewise shut it vp from
  the confessing of his fault. Pope Gregorie saith, That when God did
  aske Adam, Vbi es, Where art thou? he then pretended, had hee
  willingly and readily confest his fault, not only to haue pardoned him his
  offence, but to haue restored likewise all that good which he had lost, both to
  himselfe, and his posteritie. Saint Austen is of the same opinion. And
  Saint Bernard saith, That he did not hurt himselfe more by his
  disobedience, than by seeking to excuse his sin. For this his transgression,
  had he dealt fairely and plainely with God, might perhaps haue beene 
   repaired. And Tostatus sticketh not to
  affirme,
                     Gen. 39. That if he had forthwith
  accused himselfe, he had freed all his succession: For albeit he afterwards
  repented him of what he had done,
                     Wis. 10.1.
  and that God had forgiuen him his sinne (Eduxit illum à delicto suo,
  For he brought him out of his offence, as we read in the first of
  Wisedome) yet did hee neither restore vnto him his originall
  innocencie, nor that Paradice wherein he had placed him. Your Schoole Diuines
  bring many strong Arguments against this opinion; but the authoritie of such
  graue and holy fathers as we haue here aledged, may serue to make it
  probable.
               
                  And that was dumbe. God gaue Man a tongue, that
  therewith hee might praise his Creator; Lingua mea meditatur justiciam tota
  die, laudem tuam, My tongue doth meditate on thy righteousnesse and praise all
  the day long. Now the Deuill hee is so great an enemie to those praises
  &amp; thankesgiuings which wee offer vnto God, that he studies to make that
  tongue dumbe which therein shall imploy it selfe. Dauid touching but
  his Harpe, forced that Deuill to take his heeles, that tormented
  Saul. And albeit Caietan saith, That this euill Spirit was
  but an excesse of melancholie, and that Dauids musicke did diminish it
  for the time, and gaue him ease; yet experience teacheth vs, that the
  sweetnesse of musicke doth as well increase sorrow, as stirre vp joy. And
  therefore wee may take this for a most certaine and vndoubted truth, That
  Dauids Harpe did serue as an Instrument wherwith to praise God, by
  singing Hymnes and Psalmes vnto him; Confitebor tibi in cythera Deus, I
  will praise thee vpon the Harpe, ô Lord. This Harpe of
  Dauids is to the Deuill as vnpleasing to his eare, as Christs Crosse
  is to his eye; he cannot indure the sound of the one, nor the sight of the
  other.
               
                  And that was dumbe. Mans Tongue is not onely bound to
  praise God,Dumb ministers the Deuills best agents.
 Ose. 4.8. but likewise to benefit our Neighbour; one while by
  preaching in publique; another while by aduising in secret. In this kind of
  sinne your Confessors are faultie, who (as Osee saith of them) eat vp
  the sinnes of my people, and lift vp their minds in their iniquitie: making
  good those words that immediately follow; Like People, like Priest. So likewise
  are your Preachers who sow Cushions vnder Princes elbowes, and for feare of
  offending, refuse to reprehend sinne: And these Esay calls Dumbe Dogs.
  The Dog barkes at some, bites at other some, and heales others with his tongue,
  being in it selfe verie medicinable. Diogenes reprooued all his
  Citisens, laying before them their particular faults; hee reprehended the
  Poets, for that they railed in their Verses against other mens il manners, and
  yet neuer amended their owne misdemeanors: Musitions, that beeing able to tune
  so well their Instruments, they could neuer as yet tune their Soules aright:
  Iudiciarie Astrologers, that diuining of other mens misfortunes, they could
  neuer diuine of their owne: Lewd liuers, that hauing so many good words in
  their mouthes, they should doe such bad deeds: Couetous Misers, that
  blaspheming money in publique, they adored it in priuate: Gluttons, that
  desiring health of God, they did dayly ouerthrow their bodies by ouer-eating
  and ouerdrinking themselues till they fell a vomiting as they sate at boord: Of
  those that can be content to fare well themselues, and not bring good tydings
  to their brethren: The leaprous men in the fourth of the Kings could
  find fault therwith,4. Kings 7.9. when they
  said one to another, Wee doe not well; this day is a day of good tydings, and
  we hold our peace.
               
                  And that was dumbe. It is strange, That the Deuil
  getting so much as he dayly doth by mans speech, should labour to make him
  dumbe; more harme growing to man by the former than the latter.
               First, It is to bee prooued, That of a hundred that were
  possessed with Deuills,  you shall finde but one onely
  that was dumbe; they are all of them exceeding great talkers, flatterers, and
  lyers: And that they might prate the more, they talke in diuers tongues, not
  onely in that which is their owne naturall Language, but also in Latine, in
  Greeke, &amp;c. Saint Ambrose hath noted it, That the Deuills
  downefall tooke it's beginning from his talking; Dicebat enim in corde suo,
  ascendam in Caelum, For he said in his heart, I will ascend vp into
  Heauen: And our destruction began with the conuersation that hee had with
  Eue. Iulian the Apostata makes a jeast of it, That a Serpent should
  speake: Which Saint Ciril chose rather to proue by the testimonies of
  Phylosophers &amp; Poets, than by Scripture, because this blasphemous wretch
  gaue more credit to them, than to the Word of God. Homer sayth, That
  Vlisses his Horse spake vnto him, forewarning him of his death.
  Porphyrius saith, that Caucasus spake; &amp; that
  Pythagoras passing by, it saluted him with a Salue Pythagora.
  Phylostratus saith, That Apollonius comming to the
  Gymnosophistae, an Elme (vnder whose shade being wearie he sate him
  downe) spake vnto him, and told him, That he was verie welcome. And
  Siginius reporteth of Iupiters Bull, That he spake like a
  man. If the Deuill then can speake by Horses, by Bulls, by Trees, and the like,
  hee may as well speake by a Serpent; And why not by that Serpent more than any
  other, that was to be the instrument to ouerthrow all Mankind?
               Secondly, Out of many places of holy Scripture, obseruations of
  the Saints of God, and out of the opinions of many learned Doctors,
  Phylosophers, and Poets, in fauor of this point, two manifest truths are proued
  to arise from hence, and haue their first beginnings.
               The one, That an euill tongue is the leauen of all our ill.
               The other, That a good tongue is the summe of all our good.
               The first, Experience at euerie turne teacheth it vnto vs. Whose
  are those blasphemies against God and his holy Saints, but of a sacrilegious
  tongue? Whose those inconsiderate iniuries, but of a rash and vnaduised tongue?
  Whose those infamies and detractions, but of a backbiting tongue? Whose, those
  dishonest words and lasciuious Songs, but of a filthie tongue? Whose, those
  sowings of discord amongst brethren, those dissoluings of marriages, those
  blottings of mens good names, those soylings of your Clergies Coat, your
  Priests Surplices, your Bishops Rotchets, your Widowes decent dressing, your
  Maidens modest attyre, but of a durtie slabbering tongue? Saint
  Hierome saith, That the Deuill left Iobs lips vntoucht,
  hoping that with them he would haue cursed God, as he promised to himselfe
  before hand; Stretch out thy hand and touch but his bones and his
  flesh,
                  
                     Iob. 2.5. 
                  and then see if he
  will not blaspheme thee to thy face. Saint Ambrose saith,
  Plagam suam silentio vicit, He subdued his paine by silence. And the
  selfe same father saith, That if Eue had not spoken with the Serpent,
  or if shee had but eaten the Apple, &amp; had said nothing therof to
  Adam
                  ▪ we had not come to that so great miserie and misfortune
  whereinto we fel. The Deuill did not desire to make Eue so much a
  Glutton, as a Pratler: her talking with Adam did vndoe vs all. S.
  Iames qualifies both these tongues.
               The one he termes a fire, that burns and consumes all that comes
  in it's way; and to be the onely maine cause of all mischiefe.
               Of the other he saith, That man is perfect that offends not
  in his tongue. In our Booke De Amore, we haue a whole Chapter
  touching this ill, and this good. But how is it possible, that the Deuill
  should seeke to fauour the ill, and disfauor the good? Saint Augustine
  answeres this in one word; This man hauing beene heretofore a great talker,
  the Deuill made him dumbe, lest by confessing his faults,  he might repaire those losses which hee had runne into by
  ouerlashing with his tongue.
               Dumbe, deafe, blind, and possessed with a Deuill. This massacre
  which the Deuill wrought vpon the bodie of this man, represents that cruell
  massacre which he dayly executes vpon mens soules: For though he takes pleasure
  in the possession of a mans bodie, yet his maine pretence is to preiudice the
  soule, and like a Worme in wood, to eat out the verie heart and pith thereof.
  Imagine a Horse prepared for the Kings owne riding, beautifull, and richly
  betrapt; let thy thought represent such a one vnto thee, and a Rogue that hath
  neuer a shoo to his foot, nor a rag to his tayle, mounted thereupon, and
  proudly bestriding him; Imagine a bed like that of Salomons, or that
  of the Spouse, cleane, neat, and strewed with Flowers, and an Oyle-man, a
  Collyer, or a Scullion put into it; so is it with the Soule possessed by the
  Deuill.
               It is a common doubt, yet fit for this Storie, Why God
  permitteth that the Deuill should doe so much mischiefe to man? We know that
  this the Deuills rage towards man, began euer since that God purposed to make
  his Sonne, man; and holding himselfe affronted, that he was not an Angell, hee
  vowed and swore the death of man. And therefore it is said of him, Hee was
  a Murtherer from the beginning: And this made our Sauiour to say vnto the
  Pharisees, Yee are of your Father the Deuill, for that yee seeke to fulfill
  his will, Who putting Christ to death, did accomplish that which the
  Deuill had sworne. And hence ariseth that hatred and emnitie which he beareth
  to man in generall, and the harme which hee either does or seekes to doe him;
  thinking with himselfe (as Tertullian noteth it) that the greater hurt
  hee doth vnto man, the greater stones hee throwes against God. But suppose,
  That without the will of God he cannot doe vs any harme,Why
 God permits him to be so mischieuous. 2. Mac. 3. Why doth hee permit,
  that this his liuing Temple, consecrated with his holy oyle, being the
  habitation of his delight, should be made a Hogs-stie for Deuils? When
  Heliodorus prophaning the holy Temple of Ierusalem, entred thereinto,
  there met him an armed Knight in harnesse of gold, sitting vpon a fierce Horse
  richly barbed, who smote at Heliodorus with his fore-feet throwing him
  downe to the ground. This was no sooner done, but there presently appeared two
  young men, notable in strength, excellent in beautie, and comely in apparell,
  which stood by him on either side and scourged him continually, and gaue him
  many sore stripes till he was readie to giue vp the ghost: and all the People
  praised the Lord, that he had honoured his owne place with so great and
  strange a miracle. But Heliodorus escaped in the end with life, at the
  intercession of Onias the High-Priest: And the King asking
  Heliodorus afterwards, Who were meet to be sent yet once againe to
  Ierusalem? he said, If thou hast any enemie or traitor, send him thither, and
  thou shalt receiue him well scourged, if he escape with his life: for in that
  place, no doubt there is an especiall power of God. But a more sweet &amp;
  pleasing temple vnto God than Ierusalem, is the bodie &amp; soule of man;
  Templum Dei, &amp;c. The Temple of God is holy, which Temple yee be.
  He made a promise to Ierusalem, that no vncircumcised person should put his
  foot within it, much lesse doe any harme vnto it. How then doth God consent,
  that the deuils should lodge so long in man, and should trample and tread him
  vnder foot, and torment him in that extreame manner as they doe?
               Saint Chrysostome in his bookes De
  Prouidentia, doth multiplie reasons heerevpon: and in his second part he
  setteth downe sixe; the chiefest whereof I take to be, The feare and terrour
  which God pretendeth to put man in with the sight of one possessed with a
  Deuill. There are many men in the world, whom God  must
  bring vnto him by ill; for good will doe no good vpon them. Saint
  Augustine expounding that verse of Dauid, Descendant in infernum
  viuentes, Let them go downe aliue into the Pit; addeth, Ne descendant
  morientes, Let them not goe downe dead. Old wiues say, That wee must goe
  Saint Iames his way, either in our life or our death. But more truly
  may it be said of Hell, That to the end wee may not goe into it at our death,
  we must enter into it in our life: not like Dathan and
  Abiram, who went downe quicke into it, but with the consideration and
  earnest thinking of him that is possessed with a Deuill. For if in this life,
  when as yet the finall sentence is not giuen, the Deuill doth vse a Sinner thus
  hardly; What will he doe vnto him when God shall seale his Warrant for Hell,
  and pronounce condemnation againsthim? Origen noteth it, That there
  was not any kind of paine in the world, wherewith the Deuill did not torment
  Iob; afflicting him with the fires of Saint Anthonie, the
  sores of Lazarus, the Collicke, the Gout, the Canker, &amp;c.
  Effudit viscera eius. Galen saith, It is impossible that many
  Infirmities should meet together in one and the selfe same part of the bodie:
  But in Iob, in euerie part of his bodie the Deuill had put paine vpon
  paine, and sore vpon sore. Now if on him such rigour was shewne, who was
  appointed to bee the patterne of Patience; What cruell torments shall be
  executed on him that is to be made the example of Gods diuine justice.
               The second reason is, That in the infancie of the Church, it was
  fitting that there should be some chastisements that should carrie a sound and
  a noyse with them; to the end that (as Dionysius hath noted it) the
  Wicked might be terrified therewith. In the Old Testament God tooke this
  course, Vae tibi cimbalo alarum. Esay speakes this of Aegypt, hee
  termes it a Bell with wings; for the seuere and many strokes which the bell
  with wings shall beat it withall. It is an excellent Symbole of Fame, because
  as it flyes, it sends foorth a shrill sound. Appian the historian cals
  the Emperor Tiberius, The Cimball of the world, because his fame did
  ring and sound through all the nations of the Earth. After many other plagues,
  God threatned the Aegyptians with a murren or pestilence; and anon after
  renders the reason of it, That his name might be declared throughout all
  the world. And as when the great Bell tolls in Arragon, the whole Kingdome
  is strucken into feare and amasement, (for that clapper neuer wags but vpon
  some strange and extraordinarie occasion) so the whole world was strucken into
  a great feare of those rods and scourges wherewith the Aegyptians were so
  sorely beaten.
                     Iosh. 2.9.11. 
                  Rahab
  said vnto the Spies which entred into Ierico, Our hearts did faint, and
  there remained no more courage in any, because of you; For I know that the Lord
  hath giuen you the Land, and that the feare of you is fallen vpon vs. And
  the Princes of the Philistines could say vnto their People, Be yee not
  rebellious and stiffe necked, lest it happen vnto you as it did vnto Aegypt.
  It remained for a Prouerbe to after Ages, The Plagues of Aegypt light vpon
  thee. To this end God permitted in the primitiue Church many demoniated
  persons; some, for forsaking the Faith; some, for abusing the Sacraments;
  others, for blasphemies, and the like: Himineus and Alexander were
  deliuered ouer vnto Sathan,
                  1. Tim.
 1.20. 
                  that they might learne, not to blaspheme; others, for
  incest; others, for pride: so (according to Epiphan. &amp; S.
  Hier.) Nebucadnezar was by the Deuil turned into a beast:
  others, for their enuie, [Spiritus Domini mali vigebat Saul.] But
  that the Deuill should make a man deafe, blind, and dumbe, this of all other is
  the seuearest punishment: This is, To deliuer men o
                        ••
                     r to a reprobate sence, that they may doe those things
  which are not fitting for them. Thomas saith, That God suffers this (yet
  not beeing the Author of so great an ill) by remoouing for a time his especiall
  fauour, &amp; leauing the Vnderstanding to walke  a while
  in darkenesse. The Sunne is the vniuersall cause of the light; but if a man
  will shut vp his doores and his windowes close, it is his owne fault If hee
  abide in darkenesse. God is the vniuersall cause of the spirituall light of our
  Soules; but if any one shall despise this Light, he vseth to leaue him in the
  darke. And hence was it, that these three inconueniences did befall this man,
  to wit, Deafenesse, Blindnesse, and Dumbnesse, which was one of the greatest
  rigours of his Iustice. Esay saith, I saw the Lord sitting vpon a
  high Throne;
                     Esay 6. like a Iudge that
  sits in state, the house full of smoke, and the Seraphins of fire, publish his
  furie, and the sent of their sinnes which had gone vp into his nosthrils. Those
  two Seraphins that couered Gods face, are a representation of his wrath;
  Though when the time of punishing is come, God vseth to open his eyes: but now
  the Seraphins couer his eyes, in token that he would strike this man with
  blindnesse. And therefore it is said, That the foundation of the Temple did
  shake. Then anon after followed the punishment; Excaeca cor populi huius,
  &amp; aures eius aggraua. Other Interpreters vse the Imperatiue, vttering
  this sentence in a commanding kind of voyce; Excaecetur cor populi huius,
  &amp;c. Let the heart of this people bee made blind, and their eares
  dull.
               
            
            
               Cum ejecisset Daemonium, locutus est mutus.
               
                  When the Deuill was gone out, the Dumbe spake. The
  Deuill was first to be driuen out, before the Dumbe could speake. First, The
  dore or the window is to be opened, that the light may come in: First, you must
  turne the cocke of the Conduit, or plucke out the stopple, before the water
  can gush out. The penitent man must first cast the Deuill out of his bosome,
  before hee can make any good Confession: First, the Preacher must cast him out
  of his heart, before hee can preach any sound Doctrine. What confession can a
  Sinner make, while the Deuill dwells in his soule? What sorrow or feeling can
  hee haue of his former faults? What purpose of amendment for the future? What
  acknowledgement of the heinousnesse of his crimes? What shame, or what feare of
  offending? Antiently men did confesse themselues only vnto God, to whom euery
  secret of the heart was so open, that mans thought and intention was
  sufficient; with the penitent, his condemning himselfe by his own mouth. Yet
  notwithstanding, Ezechias said, I will recount all my yeares in
  the bitternesse of my soule. And Dauid, Anni mei sicut araneae
  meditabuntur; With that care and melancholie wherewith the spiders weaue
  their webs, drawing euery thred out of their owne bowells, so will I meditate
  on the yeares of my life, drawing out threds of sorrow and repentance for
  euerie fault that I shall commit, from the bottome of my heart. If thou canst
  be content to imploy all thy sences for the good of thy bodie, &amp; not do the
  like for thy soule, thou doost therein wrong thy soule, heauen, and God. Thou
  weepest and wailest for the losse of these earthly goods, but shedst not a
  teare for the losse of those rich treasures of heauen. Two things are inioyned
  the penitent:Two things required in euery true
 Penitent. 
                  
                     The one, a full and intire Confession.
                     The other, a strict examination of their owne
conscience.
                  
               
               And that so strict as may befit so great and waighty a businesse
  as is the saluation of the Soule; and then may the Dumbe speake, and the
  Preacher preach. For if the Deuill be still pulling him by the sleeue, what
  good crop can he render vnto God, of his Hearers? What light can hee giue to
  his Auditorie, who is himselfe possessed by the Prince of Darknes▪ Open
  thou my lips, o Lord, &amp; I shal set forth thy praise; do thou pardon me my
  sins, &amp; I shal sincerely preach thy Word. The Scribes &amp; Pharisees, who
  were teachers, but not doers of the Law,  
                  Ieremy
  cals them false Scribes, What they wrought with their pen, they blotted out
  with their works. The like kind of fault that partie committeth, who
  singeth Psalms vnto God in the Quire, and yet hath the Deuill in his brest:
  And then, how different must this mans thoughts be from his words? He can
  hardly say, Confitebor tibi Domine in toto corde meo, I will confesse vnto
  the Lord with my whole heart, as long as he hath giuen himselfe ouer vnto
  Sathan.
               
                  The Dumbe spake. This man prostrating himselfe at our
  Sauiours feet, might verie well say, Blesse the Lord, ô my Soule, and
  all that is in mee praise his holy Name: The Lord looseth them that are bound;
  the Lord inlightneth the Blind: Praise the Lord, ô my Soule, I will
  praise the Lord in my whole life. A Sinner that truly repents
  himselfe,The iustifying of Soules a greater act of mercie,
 than the creating of Angells. and that sees himselfe freed from the
  Deuill, and from Hell, is neuer satisfied with giuing thankes vnto God, and in
  praising his holy Name, as oft as hee considers the great mercie which God hath
  shewed towards him. Saint Augustine saith, That although the creating
  of Angells, and the justifying of Soules, doe equally argue Gods great power;
  yet the second is an act of farre greater mercie.
               
                  He casteth out Deuills through Beelzebub the chiefe of the
  Deuills. Origen, Saint Augustine, and Saint Ambrose say,
  That the Deuills haue their studies and their cares apart: This is their first
  Tenent; Some (say they) treat of Auarice; some, of Luxurie; others, of
  Ambition; others, of Reuenge; some perturbe mens minds, occasioning great
  sorrow; others, excesse of foolish joy and mirth.
               Secondly, They hold, That in euerie one of these seuerall vices
  there is a superiour Deuill, which hath command ouer many that are inferiour
  vnto him; And he that is the Chiefetaine of one of these Legions, is not
  obedient to any Saint whatsoeuer, except him that excells in humilitie, whose
  lowlinesse of mind may be able to incounter with his pride of heart. S.
  Marke relateth, That our Sauiour deliuering one ouer that was
  possessed of a Deuill, to his Disciples, to the end that they should make him
  whole; howbeit they had boasted, That Deuills also were subiect vnto
  them; yet they could not doe it. Afterwards asking Iesus the cause of
  their not curing him, hee answered, Such kind of Deuills as these, are not
  cast out but with Prayer and fasting. This Deuill should seeme to be a
  Prince of some Legion, and none could doe any good vpon him, saue such Saints
  of God as were wonderfull meeke and humble, and with Fastings did beat downe
  the bodie of sinne, and by frequent and feruent prayer, prostrate their
  Soules.
               Thirdly, Many of these deuils do possesse diuers parts of the
  body which correspond with that vice which they are subiect to: And as the
  soldier, who sealing a wall or a fort, stickes his dagger or his Pike in some
  part of the wall where hee meanes to get vp; so the Deuill seekes to pitch his
  standard there where hee may aduance it with most ease, and most to his honour
  and glorie. Alfegor that dishonest Deuill, domineeres most in the
  Loyns, (as it is noted by Saint Gregorie in his Exposition of that
  place vpon Iob,
                  
                     Iob. 3. 
                  Virtus
  eius in lumbis eius, His strength lies in his loynes.) Pluto the
  Prince of Couetousnesse raignes most in the hands: Our Sauiour Christ healed a
  hand that was withered;
                     Luk. 16. signifying
  thereby, That it was a couetous hand, and yeelded not the fruit of good workes.
  Beelzebub, who is the Prince of Pride, rules principally in the head.
  This Beelzebub, by interpretation, is the Prince of Flies; whither it
  were or no, that they gaue him this name in regard of those many Flies which
  his Sacrifices did breed; or whither it were because the Acharonitae
  did presume that he had freed them from certaine filthie and loathsome Flies;
  or for that the Flies are alwayes buzzing about the  head
  and face; or because the Deuill and these Flies are much alike in their euil
  disposition, [According to that of Salomon, Muscu morientes, perdunt
  suauitatem 
                        ••
                     guenti, Dead Flies doe
  marre the sweetnesse of the Oyntment;] or for that the Flie is the Emblem
  of a proud Deuill; Ipse est Rex super omnes filios superbiae. This
  Deuill is a proud daring Deuill: proud in his Motto, Similis ero
  Altissimo, I will bee like to the most High: and proud in that his
  proffer, To haue the King of Kings our Sauiour Christ to doe him homage;
  H
                        •
                     c omnia tibi dabo, si cadens
  adoraueris me, All these things will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and
  worship me. Or whither he were so called for that other attribute of his,
  to wit, his daringnesse and his audaciousnesse; Nihil audacius musca,
  Nothing bolder than a Flie: And for this cause (saith Homer) did
  the Lacedemonians beare Flies for their Deuice in their Shields; which is
  confirmed by Pierius. The Deuill occupieth the North, I will set
  in the sides of the North. From the North commeth all euill;
                     Ierem. 1. Esay 14. Your Flies they doe
  the like. Plinie saith, That your Bees are forced to forsake their
  hiues, and to flie out of your Northerne parts, for the trouble that the Flies
  there giue them. The Deuill is importunate, impudent, neuer ceaseth, neuer
  growes wearie with tempting vs: And no lesse vexatiue and troublesome are your
  Flies. Saint Gregorie calls these our sensuall imaginations, Flies.
  Pierius reporteth, That to the importunate man they gaue the name of
  Flie; And there is no such busie bodie as the Deuill. Lastly, Your Flies doe
  abound most in the Dog dayes; and the greater is the heat of our sensualities,
  the greater store of Deuills it hatcheth. Of Marie Magdalen Saint
  Luke saith, That our Sauiour Christ cast out of her seuen Deuills.
               And howbeit there were other great Gods amongst the Gentiles,
  (according to Vatablus his report) as one Balberid; that is,
  Dominus Fideus, that presideth in al kind of dealing and
  contractations in Innes and Victualling houses; and was so rich an Idoll, by
  reason of the great Almes and deuotions which your Traders and dealers in the
  world did offer vnto him, that by the helpe thereof, Abimelech killing
  seuentie of his brethren, carried away the Kingdome of Israell. There was
  likewise one Belfegor, who did command in Chiefe in Gluttonie; and was
  a verie poore Idoll, in regard that they who were deuoted vnto him, spent all
  that they could rape and wring, in bellie-cheere and gourmandizing.
  Notwithstanding all these, Beelzebub, whom they likewise called the
  God of Acharon, was more famous than all the rest of that rabble. And the
  Prophets for to diuert the People from the adoration of these Idolls, did
  impose infamous names vpon them, as Beelzebub God of the Flies.
               
                  And the People wondred. Acknowledging, That they had
  neuer seen so prodigious a miracle in Israel [Nunquam apparuit sic in
  Israel;] Insomuch that some of them whispered amongst themselues, That he
  was the Sonne of God;
                     Mat. 9. Mat.
 12. 
                  Nunquid 
                        •
                     ic est
  Filius Dei? others did desire signes from Heauen; others said, In
  Beelzebub, &amp;c. Saint Hierome saith, That this was that Deuill
  which deceiued Eue; as also he that tempted our Sauiour Iesus Christ.
  But here is to be seene a greater miracle than this, That Christ giuing sight
  to this one blind man, should leaue so many others more blind than he: Which
  made Esay crie out, Obstupescite,
                  
                     Esay 29. 
                  &amp; admira
                     
                        •
                     ini, Stay your selues, and wonder, they are blind,
  and make you blind. It were able to strike a man into amasement, to see that a
  poore sillie old woman should see the light of Heauen, and the blind likewise
  that is borne blind; and that the Scribes and Pharisees should continue so
  blind as they doe. The heart that is hardned is like vnto the Anuile, which the
  more you beat vpon it, the harder it waxeth: Or like vnto sand, which the more
  the waters wash it, the closer it settles,  and growes
  the tougher.1. Reg. 2.5. Of Nabals
  heart, the Scripture saith, Mortuum est cor eius, &amp; factum est quasi
  lapis, That his heart dyed within him, and that he was like a stone. Saint
  Bernard giues vs fiue markes, by which wee may know the hardnesse of
  a mans heart.
               The first, Neque compunctione scinditur, It is not
  toucht with compunction, It hath no feeling of it's hurt, and perdition. Our
  Sauiour healing one that was possest with a Deuill, Suspiciens Caelum,
  ingemuit, Casting his eyes vp to Heauen, he wep't and lamented; mourning
  for him, that mourned not for himselfe. Alexander would haue killed
  himselfe, for hauing killed his friend Clitus▪ L
                        ••
                     cretia stab'd her selfe, when she saw she had lost
  her honesty. But the sinner, is not sencible of farre greater losses than
  these.
               The second, Nec pietate mollitur. It is not mollified
  with Gods Pitie and Mercie towards it. The clemencie which he showeth towards
  it, ought to reduce it to repentance;
                     Rom. 2.
  But it despiseth (as Saint Paul saith) the riches of his goodnesse,
  and longanimitie. And these are riches, that are treasured vp to their owners
  condemnation. God treasures vp Mercie for thee, and thou treasurest vp Wrath
  against the day of Vengeance. All which shall turne to thine owne hurt.
               The third, Nec mouetur precibus. It is not mooued with
  prayers and intreaties. Tota die (sayth Esay)
  &amp;c.
                  
                     Esay. 65.2. Rom.

                  I haue spred out mine hand all the day long to a rebellious
  people. The selfe same words, are repeated againe by Saint Paul.
  To begge with hands lifted vp, is a ceremony which men vse with God; &amp; God
  sayth, that he vseth the like with men, as if he were Man, and Man God.
               The fourth, Flagellis induratur. Like that of
  Pharaoh; The more hee is punished, the more his heart is hardned.
  According to that of Iob, Cor eius indurabitur quasi lapis, &amp;
  stringetur quasi malleatoris incus. His heart shall be hardned as a stone,
  or as the anuile, that is hammered on by the Smith. Whereunto, suteth that of
  Ieremy, Indurauerunt facies suas super Petram, They haue made their faces
  harder than a stone.
               
               The fifth, Inhumanum, propter res humanas. Inhumane to
  it selfe for humane commodities, Who like Narcissus, being in loue
  with their owne beautie, will rather dye, than forsake so vaine a shadow. Of
  these men, it may bee sayd, Wee haue made a league with Death, and a
  couenant with Hell. The appointed time shall ouertake these men, or some
  disperat sickenesse shall cease vpon them. Thou shalt preach to one of these
  obstinat sinners, That he confesse himselfe, &amp; make his peace with God, by
  acknowledging his sinnes, by being hartily sorry for the same, and by crauing
  pardon and forgiuenesse of God: But his answere will be, What, Shall men thinke
  that I doe it out of feare? No, I am no such coward, &amp;c. All these
  conditions are summed vp in those which our Sauiour vttered of the euill
  judge. Nec Deum timeo, nec homines Vereor, I feare neither God nor
  Man.
               
               
                  Others tempted him, seeking a signe from Heauen. From
  this varietie of opinions, Saint Austen inferreth the little reckoning
  that we are to make as well of mens iudgements,No scourge to
 that of the Tongue. as their iniuries. For mine owne part, leauing Saint
  Austen herein to your good likings, Let not mine owne conscience
  condemne mee before God; all the rest I account as nothing. What sayth
  Esay? Nolite timere opprobrium hominum, Feare not the affronts and
  calumnies of men. And Christ giues you a verie good reason for it; If the
  master of the family were called by the name of Belzeebu
                        •
                     , what name will they giue to
  those of his house? Gregorie Nazianzen, treating of certaine
  Heretickes, who made the diuine persons disequall; sayth, In bona
                        •
                      partem hoc accipe Sancta Trinitas, nec
  tu stultorum linguas prorsus effugisti, O blessed Trinitie, 
   receiue my words with that good intention which I
  deliuer them, thou hast not escaped cleere from the tongues of fooles. It
  ought therefore to bee a great comfort vnto thee, that those fooles should
  mutter against thee, that spake ill of God. The Athenians, sentenced one
  Iupido, a base fellow, to bee put to death in Phocions
  company, who was a famous man: and Iupido, weeping, as he went along
  to execution; Phocion sayd vnto him, Why doost thou weepe? Thinkst
  thou it a small happinesse, that thou must dye in my company? The like words
  doth Nazianzen vse to those that are iniured by the tongues of
  fooles; Thinkest thou it a small happines, that thou shouldst suffer therein
  with God? Saint Chrysostome sayth, That an euill tongue, is worse than
  a dogge: for hee onely teares a mans cloaths and his flesh; but an ill tongue,
  mens honours, liues, and soules. Saint Bernard sayth, That it is worse
  than that piercing of our Sauiours side with the speare, For that speare did
  but wound the dead bodie of our Sauiour Christ; but this sting of the tongue,
  our Sauiour beeing aliue; the one therein, beeing lesse cruell than the other.
  Dauid sayth; That an ill tongue differs but little from Hell. From
  the depth of Hels wombe, and from a foule tongue, good Lord deliuer vs.
  Where you see he makes it a peece of his Letanie. Many doe murmure by
  intimating a secret; This is onely committed to thy brest, whence it neuer
  ought to goe out. They doe not consider who commit a secret to a man, that
  therein they inioyne him, not to keepe it: It is a great foolerie to thinke,
  that another will keepe that secret, which thou thy selfe couldst not conceale.
  And as great a folly is it that thou shouldst hold him vnfaithful, who
  reuealeth thy secret, and take thy selfe to be loyall, when as thou wast
  vnfaithfull to thy selfe. Thou doost not keepe that secret, which God and his
  Law commands thee; and thou holdst him disloyall, that breakes but the Lawes of
  the World. Thou defamest thy neighbour by reuealing his defects to thy friend,
  and yet wouldst faine make show that thou art very tender of his honour.
               
                  But Iesus knew their thoughts, and sayd, Euery Kingdome
  deuided against it selfe, shal be desolate. Mathew, recounting another
  Miracle of a dumbe Deuill;
                     Mat. 9. the
  Scribes &amp; the Pharisees sayd, In principe daemoniorū, &amp;c. Our
  Sauior at that time did dissemble their blasphemie, hoping (as S.
  Chrysostome sayth) that the splendor of that Miracle, should by little
  and little ouercome them. But perceiuing in this Miracle, that they perseuered
  in their malice, and that his silence gaue occasion vnto them, to increase
  their suspition, hee made a short and cutted Sermon vnto them. For, there are
  occasions wherein a man ought to bee silent, and wherein he ought to speake.
  And so those two places in the Prouerbs, which seeme quite contrarie, are well
  reconciled. Answere not a foole, according to his foolishnesse, least thou
  also be like him; And againe,
                     Prou.
 26.4.5. 
                  Answere a foole according to his foolishnesse, least he be
  wise in his owne conceit. To reply sometimes to the fooleries of a foole,
  is to be a foole. And not to reply vnto him, is to giue him occasion to take
  himselfe to be wiser than he is. These two places Saint Cyprian
  quoteth in that his Tract which he made against Demerianus, Who grew
  so shamelesse and so impudent, in commending Paganisme, and condemning
  Christianitie, that after a long silence, he brake out and sayd, Vltra
  tacere non oportet, I may no longer hold my peace. The like course did
  our Sauiour here take with the Scribes and Pharisees. And for the better
  conuincing of them, he made answer to their inward thoughts, which is a
  propertie onely belonging to God. Not, because they did not blaspheme him with
  their mouths; for the word, Dixerunt, proues that sufficiently; but
  because, they did either blaspheme him between their teeth, (as Saint
  Chrysostom will haue it) or because some did vtter this blasphemie 
   with their mouth, and other some with their heart.
               
                  The Deuills though at discord amongst
 themselues do yet vnite their forces against Man.

  diuided in it selfe. Although the Deuils are at a continuall discord
  amongst themselues, yet against Man they euermore ioyne their forces together;
  according to that of Esay, Et discurrent daemonia Onocentaurus, &amp;
  Bilosus, &amp; clamauit alter ad alterum. Make a squadron of Deuills, and
  of your Birds of rapine, and you shall find that they will combine themselues
  together for our hurt. Aristotle hath obserued, that your tamer sorts
  of fowles, as Pigeons, Geese, Cranes, and Thrushes, goe together in flockes,
  and keepe companie and friendship one with another; But your Birds of Rapine,
  as your Eagles, Kytes, Vultures, and the like, go still alone by themselues:
  So the Deuils, neuer keepe companie amongst themselues, but against Man they
  lincke and combine themselues. Iob compares them,
                     Iob. 41. to strong shields that are sure scaled,
  being set so close one to another that no winde can come betweene them, nor any
  the least ayre pierce through them. One is ioyned to another. They sticke so
  together, that they cannot be sundred. This is a stampe of that strict vnion
  which is betwixt the Deuill and his Members. For the reprobate (according to
  Saint Gregorie) set themselues against Man. Saint Luke sayth
  of the Faithfull of the Primitiue Church, They were all of one mind, and of
  one heart: For though euery one in particular was the Sonne of his
  Father, and the sonne of his Mother, yet Charitie made them all sonnes of one
  Soule, and one Heart. And as the children of God linke themselues together in
  loue; so the Deuils, and the wicked ones, ioyne together in malice.
               And here by the way, we may in the Church, take one case into
  our consideration, which is a great dishonour to Christianitie, and a great
  glorie vnto Hell, to wit, That the Deuills beeing such enemies amongst
  themselues, should yet confederate themselues for our hurt; And that
  Christians, tied by so many great and glorious titles to bee louing friends
  each to other, should euerie foot disagree, not onely in point of their owne
  priuat profit, but in causes appertaining to God. That King with King, and
  Prince with Prince, should wage war about the partition of their Kingdomes, it
  is not much; But that Prelate with Prelate, Diuine with Diuine, and Preacher
  with Preacher, should bee at difference, this is somewhat strange. Vnde
  bella, &amp; lites in vobis? (Saith Saint Iames) Form whence
  are warres,
                  
                     Iam. 4 1. 
                  and
  contentions amongst you? is it not onely from your owne lusts, that fight in
  your members? But Sathan that sower of discord, doth also sollicite and
  incite thereunto euen the holiest and best sort of people. Ecce Satanas
  expeti
                        •
                     it vos, vt cribraret sicut
  triticum, Lo Satan seekes to sift ye, as one would sift and winnow Wheat.
  The graines of Wheat continue close together as long as they are in the garner,
  but when they come to be sifted, they are sundred and seperated one from
  another. According to that of Iob, Feruescere faciet quasi ollam profundum
  maris. He will diuide the Sea in sunder with dissentions, with the same
  rage &amp; fury, as oyle boyleth vnder a great fire.
               
                  The word Sathan, what it
 implyeth.
                  If Satan be deuided against himselfe, how shall his
  Kingdome stand? Satan, is a common name, which signifieth many Deuills.
  For, if it were a proper name, as that of Belzeebub, it could not haue
  so conueniently beene said, In se diuisus est. This word implyeth any
  aduersarie whatsoeuer; As it appeareth by many places of Scripture. Non est
  Satan, neque occursus mal
                        •
                     s,
  said Dauid. And our Sauiour Christ, Vade post me Satan, Sathan get
  thee behind mee. But by a kind of excellencie,
                     Mat. 1 
                        •
                     . it is more particularly appropriated vnto the Deuill,
  because he is the greatest aduersarie we haue.
               
                  But if Sathan be diuided in him selfe, how shall his
  Kingdome stand? This seemeth  to be no good
  consequence; being that a superiour Deuill, may cast out an inferiour. I
  answere, That our Sauiour Christ doth not denie this: nay, many of the
  Sinagogue, by coniurations, and vnlawfull exorcismes, beeing the Deuills
  ministers, did cast foorth other Deuills. But if this were euery foote put in
  practise, and that many superiour Deuill, or their ministers, should infest and
  hinder one another; of force there must grow dissention among them, diuision
  must needs follow vpon it; and vpon this diuision, the dissolution of their
  Kingdome, as Athanasius, hath noted it. But our Sauiour Christ did
  cast out innumerable Deuills, to their great griefe and torment, Crying
  and saying, Why art thou come to torment vs before our time? Where Saint
  Luke sayth, In digito Dei eijcio daemonia, In the finger of God I
  cast out Deuils. Saint Austen reads it, Si in Belzeebub,
  &amp;c. If I cast out Deuills by the power of Belzeebub, then is
  his Empire diuided, and cannot stand. But his Kingdome not being to be at an
  end, till that God commeth into the World, as is made apparant by many
  prophecies, Peruenit in vos regnum Dei, The Kingdome of God doth come vnto
  you.
               
               
                  When a strong man armed, keepeth his pallace, the things
  that he possesseth are in peace. Seneca extends this name of Tyrant to a
  King that lawfully possesseth a Kingdome, but is now in his hands, who by
  force, or subtiltie, vsurpeth that which is none of his own; or in his, who
  gouerns that which is his own, but with tyrannie and cruelty. Saint
  Austen looking narrowly into those the primarie beginnings of the
  Kingdomes and Empires of the World, cals them, Magna latrocinia, Great
  and famous robberies. When Rome was Queen of the World, Titus Liuius
  sayth, That all the spoiles of other nations, were there deposited.
  Alexander reprehending a Pyrat, for robbing at Sea with two poore
  ships; Hee told him, Thou robbest the whole world; and doost thou find fault
  with mee for those petty thefts that I commit? And euen thus doe things passe
  at this day, in your great commonwealths. They whip a young theefe for stealing
  but ten Royals, and let a greater scape scot-free. What thinke you (if they
  were well examined) of a Treasurer, of a Iudge, of an Admirall, and the like
  great officers of a State, are not these great Theeues? And yet for greatnesse
  sake, we adore them. Your mice are prettie little Theeues, who in a Larder lye
  nibbling at a Pastie; Thou puttest in a Cat to kill them, or to feare them
  away; the cat falls vpon the Pye, and at times eates it all vp. Which I pray
  you is the greater Theefe of the two?
               The greatest Tyrant and Theefe that euer was in the World, is
  the Deuill.No Theefe nor Tyrant to the Deuill. Not
  onely for hauing made himselfe so much Lord and Master of the World, whereunto
  hee had no right, by stiling himselfe Prince and Lord thereof; but also for his
  exercising therein such strange and tyrannous cruelties, as hee dayly dooth.
  Our Sauiour Christ called him Theefe. He that comes not in at the right
  doore, is a Theefe and a Robber. Esay tearmes him a Tyrant. But I cannot
  let it passe without admiration, that our Sauiour should say, That hee should
  possesse all these things peaceably; being that no Theefe, nor Tyrant, can long
  inioy that which he holdeth by violence.
               First of all, Great is the feare which he must liue in,Tyrants are euer their own torturest. whether it be out of
  his owne guiltie conscience (that continuall tormenter of the Soule) or in
  regard of those perils and dangers wherin his life stands. Helyes in waite
  for other mens liues, &amp; there are thousands that lye in waite to take
  away his. It is an antient Prouerbe amongst vs, Que los tyranos, nunca
  
                        •
                     legauam a viejos, That
  Tyrants neuer liued to be old men. Phalaris was one of the greatest
  that euer the World had, who sayd, That Man would neuer haue beene borne, If he
  had but knowne beforehand  those miseries whereunto hee
  is borne; Nor a Tyrant desire to beare rule, knew hee but the troubles and
  misfortunes, that attend commands; whereof, one is Feare: For, though he bee
  feared of all men, yet greater is his, than their feare. Caine was the
  first Tyrant that euer was in the World, and did liue in that terrible feare,
  that the wagging of a leafe would startle him, and make him turne coward. This
  his feare, made him to say, Whosoeuer findeth me, will slay mee.
  Macrobius, painting forth the pains &amp; torments of Hell, sayth, That
  your Tyrants haue a great rocke hanging ouer their heads, which is euermore
  threatning to fall vpon them. This picture in that other life, dooth well
  answere to that which they suffer in this. Aelian compares them to
  hogs, who are no sooner toucht, but they grunt, fearing their liues shal be
  taken from them. Nor is the deuil himself lesse affraid than they, euer since
  that God sayd, Ipse conteret caput
  
                        ••
                     
                     um, He shall bruise thy
  head. There was neuer yet that man borne into the world, that was a Saint,
  or whom the prophecies did prefigure for a Saint, but that the Deuill was still
  affraid that hee would cracke his skull, or (to vse the Scripture phrase) would
  bruise his head.
               Secondly, For the better auoiding of feare, a Tyrant out of
  feare commits many cruelties. Herod out of this feare, slew so many
  innocent Babes. Pharaoh out of this feare, would haue all the male
  children of the Hebrews put to death. Athalia, out of this feare,
  destroyed all the stocke Royal that she could come by. For all (sayth
  Seneca) that are either powerfull, or popular, or next of bloud to the
  Crowne, whether they be friends or enemies, are alike suspected of him that is
  a Tyrant. And Iob remembers the reason of this iealousie, Hee
  takes away the liues of the valiant because he is affraid they will cut his
  throat. There was neuer yet any Saint of God, to whome the Deuill, out of
  this feare, was not cruell. He incensed Caine
                  ▪ against
  Abell; Ismael, against Isaac; Esau against Iacob;
  and his owne naturall Brethren, against Ioseph. But when our Sauiour
  Christ came into the World, what a roaring, and what a hidious bellowing did
  the Deuill make? And as the Hieronshaw (when the fawlkoner lets his hawke flye
  from fist, which must get vp aboue him and take away his life) fals a
  shrieking, and makes a most pittifull and fearefull noyse; so the Deuill made
  most lamentable mone when our Sauiour Christ appeared to the World, Crying out,
  Why art thou come to trouble vs before the time.
               
               The Deuill then, suffring so many affrights and feares, and
  multiplying so many cruelties as he dayly doth; what peace or quietnesse can
  hee inioy, that our Sauiour should say of him, In pace sunt omnia, quae
  possidet? All that he possessech is in peace. Three reasons may be rendred
  for it.
               
                  Reasons by which the deuill assures himselfe
 of peaceably possessing his spoiles.The one, in regard of his pride;
  who was so presumptuous as to say, I will ascend &amp;c. He that did
  hope to inioy a seat in Heauen; it is not much that hee should looke to inioy
  peace on earth. For though feare disquiet him, yet pride assureth him,
  flattering himselfe, that hee shall ascend the throne of the Highest without
  any disturbance.
               The other, in regard of the miserie of those whom he tyrannizeth
  ouer. Reducing them to that feare, that they dare notonce quack, or offer to
  stir against him, to such a wretched an estate hath he brought them. And
  therefore it is no maruaile that he should make no doubt of keeping sure
  possession of this dumbe, deafe, and blind man.
               The third, in regard that man hath made a base ad dishonourable
  peace with the Deuill, yeelding himselfe to be his slaue, and by resting well
  contented with this his seruitude. Plutarch reporteth of Appius
  Claudius, that Rome being about  to make peace with
  King Pirrhus, causing himselfe to be led to the Senat▪ for that
  he was blind. He no sooner came into the Senat-house, but he said vnto them, My
  Lords, and yee the rest of the noble Senators of Rome, I am informed, that you
  are concluding a peace with Pirrhus, that antient enemy of your bloud,
  and this renowmed commonwealth: I should take it for a great fauour from the
  Gods, that as I am blind, so I were deafe likewise, that my eares might not
  heare so great an infamie and reproach to Rome. The Moores take a cowardly
  Spaniard captiue, they carry him to Te
                     •
                  uan, from thence to Manuecos, from thence to some poore Farme,
  vsing him more like a dogge than a man, he makes peace with his Master, and
  turnes Moore: Iust so doth it succeed betwixt Man and the Deuill; He leads him
  from one sinne into another, from a lesser to a greater miserie; His vsage is
  such, that he makes his peace with him, and in the end turnes Deuill. This is
  the Sheepes making peace with the Wolfe, the Chickins with the Kyte, the Mouse
  with the Cat, and the Hare with the Grey-hound, &amp;c. Not to complaine of
  this so great a misery, is to bee dumbe, and blind. Os habent, &amp;c. A
  mouth they haue and speake not, eyes and see not, neither doe they cry with
  their throat. Caietan renders it, Non mussitabunt, They will not
  so much as mutter at it.
               
                  He that is not with me, is against mee. As if hee
  should say, if I shall free this man out of the Deuils clutches, the Deuill
  will not helpe me in it. For this is one of the greatest iniuries and distasts,
  which the Deuill can receiue, in regard of that great competition which the
  Deuill hath therein with God. And one of the greatest wrongs that God can
  receiue, is, That the Deuill should winne a Soule from his seruice, which he
  hath purchased at so great a price as his most pretious blood. And one of the
  things that the deuil takes most offence at, is, that God should cast him out
  of that soule, which hee hath so long possessed by his subtiltie and his
  tyrannie.
                     Ob.
                   Some Doctors doe doubt why God
  should punish the Serpent, being he was not in the fault. And the answere
  thereunto, is, That he deserued to be punished, for becomming Sathans
  instrument.
                     Sol.
                   Which may serue for a
  fearefull warning vnto Bawds, and the like vnhonest Solicitors, who woo other
  folkes affections to commit vnlawfull Actions, as elsewhere wee haue
  deliuered.
               
                  He that is not with mee, is against me. In such a
  profest warre as this, none may be Neutralls. Many can play with both
  hands;Ill must betide all neutralls betwixt God and
 Sathan. but here no daubing will serue the turne. Alciate
  stileth such Neutralls by the name of Bats, neither good Mice nor good Birds.
  And oftentimes they haue the worst of it: for if the other two make peace, they
  are hated on both sides. In the warres of Italy, those of Sona stood
  à la mira, at the gaze, taking part with neither partie, but
  looking for their aduantage where the blow would light. But they that waged
  warre thus betweene themselues, ioyned afterwards together, that they might
  the better set vpon them, and 
                     •
                  ake
  reuenge of this their Neutralitie and double dealing. Solon made a
  Law, That whosoeuer, when the commonwealth should be at ciuile wars within it
  selfe, should show himselfe a Neutrall, should loose both life &amp; goods. And
  the reason thereof might be grounded vpon this, That one of them must needes be
  the juster side, and then it were a
  
                     •
                  oule fault not to adhere therunto.
  In Kingdomes that are at odds, there are woont to be double spies, and these
  haue their signes and counter-signes, which they often change &amp; alter as
  occasion serueth. But in this difference betweene God and the Deuill, it is
  not possible to doe so. For the Deuill hath for his signe, the Character of
  that beast which is spoken of in the Apocalips; And God
  
                     〈◊〉
                   for his signe, Signum Dei
  
                        〈◊〉
                     ,
                  
                     Apoc. 3. 
                  The  signe of
  the liuing God. But God is not contented onely with this, but that by word
  of mouth thou declare whose thou art. Saint Ambrose expounding that
  place of the Canticles, Pone me vt signaculum supra cor
  
                        •
                     uum, Set me as a seale vpon thy
  heart, saith, That God will haue this signe set vpon thy forehead, vpon
  thyne arme, and vpon thy heart; vpon thy forehead, by confessing him; vpon
  thine arm, by seruing him; &amp; vpon thy heart, by louing him: So that,
  Quinon est mecum, contra me est; hee that gathereth not, scattereth;
  he that buildeth not vp, pulleth downe; and he that planteth not, rooteth vp
  what is planted.
               
                  If I by the finger of God cast out Deuils, doubtlesse the
  Kingdome of God is come vnto you. Saint Mathew hath it, If
  in the Spirit of God I cast out, &amp;c. Making the finger of God to be
  Gods Spirit. In which opinion agreeth S. Hierome, S.
  Chrisostome, S. Ambrose, Gregorie Nazianzen, and
  Athanasius. And if any man shall aske me, What is then to be
  vnderstood by the Spirit of God? S. Gregorie, S. Ambrose, and
  S. Austen answer, The Holy-Ghost. And rendring the reason thereof,
  they say, That the repartition of gifts is by the fingers, &amp; the Holy-Ghost
  is that person in the Trinity, which doth distribute these gifts both to men
  and Angels. Athanasius and S. Hierome giue another reason;
  The Son, in the Scripture is called the Arme of God, as also the Hand of God;
  and as the arme and the hand proceed from the bodie, and the finger from both,
  so the Sonne of God proceedeth from the Father, and the Holy-Ghost from them
  both.
               
                  Euthimius saith, That the finger of God and the spirit
  of God signifie Gods power. The Magi of Pharaoh not beeing able to
  make those Gnats which troubled the Aegyptians, or (as Rabbi Salomon
  and some latter Writers will haue it) those Lice which were sent to plague
  them; said, Digitus Dei est hic, This is the finger of God; that is,
  the vertue and power of God: whereby his power is pointed at as it were with
  the finger. Of this opinion is Tertullian: and further addeth, That
  God calls his finger, his power; for that the least part in God, which is his
  finger, expresseth Gods omnipotencie. And that hee might not wrong this his
  greatnesse, in this action of his, of casting Deuills out of mens bodies, he
  vseth this phrase, If I by the finger of God, &amp;c.
               
               
                  The casting out of Deuills not alwaies a
 signe of the comming of Gods Kingdome. Acts 19.14.Saint
  Chrysostome doubts of this consequence; Si in digito Dei eijcio
  Daemonia, perueniet in vos regnum Dei, If I cast out Deuils by the finger of
  God, the Kingdome of God shall come vnto you. Before that God did
  incarnate his Sonne, there were some Exorcists amongst the Iewes, which in Gods
  name, and by his vertue and power did cast out Deuils. And in the 19 of the
  Acts it is said, That there were certaine sons of Scena a Iew
  (the Priest) which did this. And Iosephus makes mention of one
  Eleazar, who before Vespasian and his whole Army did cast out
  many Deuils. And of Salomon it is said, That he left some exorcismes
  behind him, in which the name of God was called vpon, when as yet the Kingdome
  of God was not come. By which S. Ierome vnderstands the comming of our
  Sauiour Christ, in his Exposition of that place of S. Luke, Regnum Dei
  intra vos est. Herevnto I answer, That one of the tokens of the time of
  our Sauior Christ, was, his casting out of Deuils; as well as those other, That
  the Blind should see, the Deafe heare, the Dead arise, &amp;c.
               But because this Prophecie is not so fully expressed in the
  Scripture as the rest are, it is sufficient, that our Sauiour Christ wrought
  this miracle amongst the rest, in confirmation that he was that promised Christ
  and Messias, as also that he was the Sonne of God. Whence it followeth, The
  Kingdome of God is come vnto you.
               
               
                  When a strong man armed keepeth his Pallace. Saint
  Mathew and Saint 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                   make this sentence somewhat cleerer. How shall any
  one enter into the house of the strong man, vnlesse he first bind the strong
  man? And presently Saint Luke giues the reason of it, When a
  strong man armed keepeth his Pallace, &amp;c. Our Sauiour Christ compares
  this strong man to Beelzebub. And so S. Chaysostome and S.
  Augustine stile him.
               First, because his power is absolutely great; as we say, a great
  Mountaine, or a strong Tower. Iob indeeres this his power in diuers
  and sundrie places.
               Secondly, In regard of our weakenesse the Deuill is said to be
  strong, as wel in his offensiue, as his defensiue armes.
               Humane goods, whereon men commonly place their hearts, Saint
  Ba
                        •
                     il compares them to an
  highway Robber, who hides himselfe in some bush or thicket, that before the
  Traueller be aware of him, he may the better set vpon him. So the Deuill comes
  masked and disguised with an apparance of earthly blessings, and baiting our
  tastes therewith, he playes vpon vs. And therefore it is sayd in
  Wisedome, That God created these goods for a snare to catch
  fooles.
                     Wisd. 14. If the Deuil should tempt
  vs, and go plainly to worke with vs, discouering his foulenesse vnto vs, Who
  would looke after him, or haue any thing to doe with him? But because those
  euills which worke vpon the Soule are not seene, and those of the bodie do much
  afright vs; we stand more in feare of the Deuil, than of sinning, suffering our
  selues basely to bee subdued by our owne proper affections. Saint
  Bernard saith, That three enemies do continually assault vs, but that
  none of them without our consent can doe vs any harme. So that the greatest
  enemie which each man hath, is himselfe; and for to worke his owne ruine, hee
  need no other helpe but himselfe. All hells power were too weake, if thou didst
  not put the weapons of thy consent into his hands; thou thy selfe giuest him
  the cords wherewith to binde thee, and the sword wherewith to cut thyne owne
  throat. His own iniquities shal take the Wicked, &amp; he shal be holden
  with the cords of his own sin.
                  
                     Prou.
 5.22.
               
               Armed with these weapons,Why Sathan is stiled
 the Prince of the world. he becomes Master of the house of our soule (as
  it seemeth to Saint Hierome,) or of the world (as Irenaeus
  expounds it.) And therefore Saint Iohn calls him the Prince of the
  world. So that it was necessarie that our Sauior Christ should come, &amp;
  should manacle him, &amp; take these his weapons from him, wherein he so much
  trusted.
               And that we way the better vnderstand how this imprisonment
  past; First of all, it is to be noted, That God neuer consents to the Deuills
  tempting of a good man, beyond his power of resistance and subduing of him.
  God is faithfull,
                  1. Cor. 10.
                  which will not suffer yee to be tempted aboue that yee be able; for if
  hee should haue libertie without limitation, there should not be that holy man
  whom (like Iob) he would not bring to the dunghill.
               Secondly, By our Sauior Christs comming into the world, the
  power of this tyrant was much lessened; not that his prison is lesse strict and
  hard than before, but because God communicating his grace to the Faithfull,
  makes them more strong and valiant in their resistance.
               Thirdly, Since his tempting of our Sauior, his hands are bound,
  &amp; his force &amp; power hath failed him (as Hilarie &amp;
  Irenaeus hath obserued) for when he saw himself so shamefully
  ouercome, he turned coward, &amp; grew so feareful, as wel by the vertue of his
  diuinitie, as the force of his command, Vade retro Satana; that he
  neuer after durst attempt to tempt our Sauior Christ in any visible forme, nor
  doe either him or those that follow him, that hurt which hee willingly would.
  And as in the Garden, saying but onely Ego sum, I am
  
                        •
                     ee, hee made the Roman
  soldiers so afraid, that they flew back &amp; fel to the ground; so by saying
  Vade retro  Satana, Goe behind me Sathan, hee
  made the Deuills so affraid and put such cowardise into them, that trembling
  and crying out, they made hast to forsake those bodies they possessed. Saint
  Ierome saith, That our Sauiour Christ speaketh here of this
  imprisonment, How can any one enter into the strong mans, &amp;c.
               
               Fourthly, By our Sauiour Christs death, did the Deuill seeke to
  shake off this his feare and cowardise, by mustring vp all the rest of his
  forces; God so permitting it, that the Victorie might bee the more glorious and
  the more famous. This is that which our Sauiour Christ sayd vnto the
  Pharisees, as ministers of Hell, This is your very houre, and the power of
  darkenesse. But after this hee remained in straighter imprisonment than
  before,
                     Luke. 22.53. As you may read in the
  Apocalips. I saw an Angell come downe from Heauen, hauing the key of the
  bottomelesse-pit and a great chaine in his hand;
                  
                     Apoc. 20. 
                  And hee tooke the Dragon, that old
  Serpent, which is the Deuill and Satan, and he bound him a thousand yeares. And
  cast him into the bottomelesse-pit, and sealed the doore vpon him, that he
  should deceiue the people no more, til the thousand yeares were fulfilled, for
  after that he must be loosed for a little season. By these thousand
  yeares, the Saints doe vnderstand that space or terme of time which is to be
  before the comming of Antechrist; and those effects, which did succeed after
  the death of our Sauiour Christ, prooue, that till then his imprisonment was
  to be more straight, and that the Angell did not onely tye a chaine to his
  feete, but also put a barnacle about his rongue, and a ring in his nosthrils,
  that not onely the strongest men should escape his snares, but those that were
  little children, and tender infants.
               
                  
                     Luke. 8.
                  When the vncleane
  spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through drie places, seeking rest, and
  when he findeth none, he sayth, &amp;c. Euthimius hath obserued, That our
  Sauiour Christs casting out of the Deuills, the Euangelists call it, a going
  or comming foorth. Exibant ab eo daemonia, clamantia per loca in aquosa,
  The Deuils went out crying in watrie places. S. Mathew vseth the
  word, Arida, Drie places. The Greeke word, signifies both these.
  Origen by these places, vnderstandeth Hell. But since those Deuills,
  which entred into the swine of Gennezaret, did desire of our Sauiour Christ,
  that he would giue them that mansion, it is not to be beleeued, that when they
  goe out of mens bodies they would for their pleasure make choyce of the
  bottomlesse pit;The Deuill finds no rest but where he may
 doe mischiefe. Saint Ierome declares the same in the word,
  Solitudines. And your Exorcists doe coniure them, to get them to the
  mountaines and the woods; pretending to excuse the hurt which they do,
  remaining among the concourse or presse of people. The Angell which
  accompanied yong Tobias, imprisoned the Deuil called
  Asmodeus, who had killed Saras seuen husbands, in the
  desarts of Aegypt. And further sayth, That the deuill could not there find any
  rest; because he should not there meet with any people to deceiue them. Not
  that the deuill can haue any rest; but in doing mischiefe hee feeles the lesse
  torment. Cheering himself (like the enuious man) with other mens miseries. I
  will returne (sayth hee) vnto mine house whence I came out. Not that he can
  freely returne thither when he listeth, but because he striues and indeuours to
  doe it: And for that his experience teacheth him, that he there suffers least
  paine.
               
                  He taketh to him seuen other spirits, worse than
  himselfe. He lights vpon a house, whence all Vertue is banished; Well
  fitted for such a guest, and seuen more such companions as himselfe.
               There are three sorts of persons possessed with Deuills.
               
                  Three sorts of persons possessed with
 Deuills.One sort of them, are spiritually possessed, by reason of their
  mortal &amp; deadly sinnes; For he that commiteth sinne, makes himselfe the
  seruant of sinne, and willingly puts himselfe into the power of the deuill.
               
                  Others are corporally possessed, as the
  Energumeni, and such as are Lunatick· And Saint Austen
  reporteth, that many young children beeing baptized, suffer this torment. And
  Cassianus sayth, That many Saints of God haue suffered the like, God
  so permitting it, that they might bee refined and purified, as gold in the
  crisole.
               The third, consisteth of both those kinds.
               Now, which of these three doe you take to be the worst? Saint
  Crysostome, and Gregorie Nazianzen doe affirme, That the
  partie that is spiritually possessed, is in the worst and most dangerous
  estate: And the reasons are as strong, as they are cleare. Which indeed are
  most cleere.
               The first is, That the deuill can doe vs little harme, vnlesse
  we fall into sinne. For without the helpe of sin the deuill cannot destroy both
  soule &amp; bodie. For though the deuill doe put it into the fire, it is our
  owne heart that must forge the worke. Saint Paul doth defie all the
  creatures both of Heauen, Earth, and Hell. And why? For I am persuaded
  (saith he) that neither Death, nor Life, nor Angells,
                  
                     Rom. 8.38. 
                  nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor
  things Present, nor things to Come, nor Heigth, nor Depth, nor any other
  creature, shall be able to seperate vs from the Loue of God, which is in Iesus
  Christ, yet he durst not defie sinne. For that alone is more powerfull to
  doe vs hurt than all other creatures put together.No
 creature so hurtfull to man as sinne. Saint Chrysostome askes
  the question, Why the deuill persuaded Iosephs brethren to put him
  first into a pit, and then afterwards to sell him? And he answeres, that it was
  the enuie and hatred which they bare vnto him for his dreames sake. And that
  other weapons, the deuill needed none. And in that Parable of the Tares, where
  the deuill sow'd his Tares amongst the Wheat,A lesser ill to
 be possessed in bodie than in soule. it is said, That although he had
  not sowne them, yet the good seed would haue beene lost through the
  carelesnesse &amp; negligence of the husbandmen, For negligence in things so
  necessarie is a greater deuil, than that of Hell. In this sence Saint
  Gregorie Nazianzen sayd of Arrius, Satius illi esset a daemonio
  vexari, It had bin better for him to haue beene tormented by a Deuill.
               
               The second is, For that the goods of the bodie, are not
  comparable to those of the soule, Tange cuncta quae possidet, Touch all
  that he hath, Sayd the Deuill to God, when he talked with him concerning
  Iob. In a word touching the goods of the soule, the least thereof is
  of more worth than all the world. And the goods not beeing able to bee compared
  one with another, neither can their ill. Nay, rather to loose these goods of
  the bodie, turnes oftentimes to our greater gaine. Perieramus, nisi
  perijssemus, We had perished, if we had not perished, It was the saying of
  a Philosopher in a storme, when the throwing of his goods ouerboord, was the
  sauing of his life. But that Soule that shall cast his sinnes ouerboord, and
  drowne them in the bottome of the Sea, that they may neuer be able to rise vp
  in iudgement against him; is a happinesse beyond all happinesse, and not to bee
  exchanged for the whole Empire of the World. What booteth it a man, to
  gaine all the world, and to loose his owne soule? Therefore it is a lesse
  ill, to be possessed in Bodie than in Soule. For sinne onely is that true
  euill, which depriueth vs of true good.
               Likewise, He that is spiritually possessed, is in worse case
  than he that hath a deuill in soule and body: And of this truth there are two
  euident reasons.
               The one, that to haue a Deuill in the bodie, is no small
  occasion whereby the Soule is saued. Saint Paul said of the incestuous
  person, Let him be deliuered vnto Sathan, for the destruction of the
  Flesh,
                  1. Cor. 5.5. 1. Tim.
                     
                        •
                     .20. 
                  that the Spirit
  may be saued in the day of the Lord Iesus. Whither it were by way of
  excommunication, (as it seemeth good vnto Thomas) the Deuills
  tormenting him, following his excommunication, (as Caietan 
                   will haue it) or whither he did deliuer him ouer to the
  Deuill, as to Gods Executioner, without excommunicating him, (as Saint
  Hierome is of opinion) or whither the Apostles had licence to doe all
  or any of these at their pleasure; sure I am, that Saint Ambrose
  saith, That the deliuering ouer of these Sinners vnto the Deuill, was a putting
  of them into some paine or griefe of body by the hands of the Deuill, as he
  tormented Iob, to the end that they might be drawne to repentance for
  their sinnes. And this agrees with that of Saint Chrysostome, That
  Saint Paul did deliuer the incestuous man ouer to the Deuill,
  tanquam pedagogo aperiens ei poenitentiae ianuam, As to a Schoolemaster,
  opening to him the doore of Repentance. Saint Hierome saith,
  Tanquam Quaestionario, as to an Informer or Baylife: But they differ
  in this, That when the Informers accuse, &amp; the Baylifes attach, it is
  commonly for others good; but when the Deuill accuseth or layes hold of a man,
  it is for hurt. Saint Ambrose saith, That when the Deuill had got
  leaue to tempt Iob, hee got it for to worke his destruction. Wilt
  thou take the Deuill with a hooke like a Fish, or with a string like a
  Bird? Yes, thou shalt lay that poyson for him as a bait, wherewith he
  thought to destroy thee. Wherein is to be seene the wisedome and omnipotencie
  of God, in that hee turnes these trickes and subtilties of the Deuill against
  Man, to Mans benefit; who being willing to swallow him vp at a bit, choakes
  himselfe, and doth rather benefit than hurt him. Wherein is plainely to be
  seene, the good hap which this dumbe man had in suffering in his bodie; for if
  his hurt had layne onely in his soule, they would neuer haue brought him to our
  Sauiour Christ, and it might haue so fallen out, that he might haue remained
  for euer in this his miserie: so that the torment of his bodie, was the
  occasion whereby he remained sound both in bodie and in soule; as commonly
  those did whom our Sauiour cured.
               The second reason is, That there is no Christian can bee
  supposed to bee so wicked, that it being put to his choice to chuse one of
  these two, either to be dumbe, deafe, and blind, or to be one of those
  blasphemous Iewes, who said, In Beelzebub eijcit Daemonia, In Beelzebub he
  casteth out Deuills? would not rather make choyce of this mans misfortune,
  than of the Iewes hardnesse of heart.
               
                  He brings seuen Diuils worse than himselfe. When this
  foule Fiend enters into a man, he makes way for a great many more of his
  fellowes. For the Deuil being rather the Soules Bawd, than it's Bridegroome,
  he beares no loue thereunto; but God, because she is his true Spouse, is
  tender of her, and will not suffer the least wind of sinne to blow vpon her,
  but will looke louingly and carefully vnto her. But of this we haue treated
  heretofore.
               
                  And it came to passe while he spake, a certaine woman amidst
  the multitude, lifting vp her voyce, &amp;c. Our Sauiour Christs Sermon
  did not make the least gap in the hard hearts of the Scribes and Pharisees, but
  it wrought such great admiration in the brest of a certaine woman called
  Marcella, that lifting vp her voyce amidst the Doctours, and praising
  our Sauiour Christ, she cried out aloud, Blessed is the wombe that bare
  thee, and the paps that gaue thee sucke. These Pharisees condemns thee for
  one that hath made a couenant with Beelzebub; but I say, that from the
  verie instant of thy conception thou wast a holy man, and that therefore
  blessed was the wombe that bare thee, &amp;c. and that the leaprosie of
  originall sinne did not worke vpon thee, as it did vpon all the rest of
  Mankind. And that those paps which thou suckedst being likewise blessed, they
  could not giue milke to a Sinner. And because thy conception and thy birth were
  both holy, Gods blessing bee with that mother which conceiued and brought forth
  such a sonne. Saint Augustine saith, That it was not onely
  Marcella that vttered  these praises of our
  Sauiour, but that many others also beeing taken with the strangenesse of this
  miracle, fell into an extraordinarie commendation of him. But if the Gospell
  make mention of one only, it may be vnderstood, that Marcella was the
  first that sung in that tune, and that many others followed on, and bore a part
  therein. And this sutes well with that of Saint Luke, They glorified him,
  saying, A great Prophet is risen vp amongst vs: One while confessing him
  to be God, another while, the Messias.
               
               Of this applause and commendation of our Sauiour, wee haue two
  forcible reasons,
               The one, That generall good which Christ did here vpon earth,
  and more particularly that which he did to this poore miserable man: For, to
  doe good, but especially to the Poore, is a powerful motiue of praise.
  Confitebor Domino nimisin ore meo, in medio multorū laudabo eum, qui
  astitit a dextris pauperis, I wil acknowledge God with a loud voice; in the
  middest of many will I praise him who stood at the right hand of the
  Poore: This doth that phrase (as Saint Augustine hath noted it)
  inferre, of Nimis in ore meo: not betweene the teeth, nor in some
  by-corner, but in medio Multorum, in the middest of the Congregation.
  And therefore saith Eccles. Splendidum in panibus benedicent labia
  multorum: He that succoureth the poore, he that slaketh hunger, all the
  World shall ring of his praise, and thousands of blessings shall be throwne
  vpon him. All Nations of the earth did euermore celebrate and honour those
  that were publike benefactors to the Commonwealth; and the Citisens thereof, by
  erecting Statues vnto them, that there might remain an eternall memorie and
  immortall fame of their noble actions: As Pliny reporteth of Athens;
  Plutarch, of Lacedemonia; and many Historiographers, of Rome.
  Leo the tenth did bring downe the price of salt; for the which Rome
  thought themselues so much bound vnto him, that they did set vp his Statue in
  the Capitoll, with a motto that spake thus, Optimi liberalissimique
  Pontificis memoriae. But your Kings and Princes now a dayes, doe make such
  a common practise of pilling and polling the Commonwealth, that to see any good
  come from them, may be held as great a miracle as that we haue now in hand.
  Ephraim is an Heifar vsed to delight in threshing. Now to
  thresh,
                     Ose. 10 11. To th
                        •
                     esh, in Scripture, is to rule with tyranny.
 Isa. 25.10. is taken oftentimes in Scripture, to rule with
  tyrannie and oppression. Arise, ô thou daughter of Syon, and fall a
  threshing. For in this mountaine shall the hand of the Lord rest, and Moab
  shall be threshed vnder him, euen as straw is threshed in Madmenah. The
  proportion of the comparison holds in this, That as your heifers do tread the
  corne vnderneath their feet, till it be troad all out of the eare; so your
  Princes trample vpon their Subiects, till they haue drawne from them the
  greater part of their goods: and if here and there an eare escape him, and goe
  away whole, hee may crie, Godamercie good lucke; Princeps postulat, &amp;
  Iudex in reddendo est. The Prince, hee will haue some strange taxe or new
  imposition layd vpon the Subiect; your reuerend Iudges they will inuent a way
  to do it, and say, There is good law for it; and euer after it shall be a
  President, or a ruled Case. And whence doth this arise? Marry from this, That
  the one is a thorne in the Subiects sides, and the other are brambles. And for
  this cause, in that Fable of the Trees, none did desire to be King, saue the
  Bramble. And this is the reason why Princes are soothed vp by their
  Flatterers, and Cushion-sowing Courtiers vnder Kings elbows; but these
  Earewigs, howsoeuer their Prince may affect them, I am sure they are neither
  esteemed nor applauded by the People. And if these Flatterers grow fat and
  full, the Commons haue poore commons, and are poore and hungerstarued. But
  because this King of Heauen did good vnto his People, hee was praised and 
   commended by them. So saith Saint Mathew, The
  Multitudes wondred; and seeing the Dumbe to speake, the Blind to see, the Lame
  to walke, they magnified the God of Israell.
               
               The other, The force of our Sauiour Christs words.
  Ecclesiasticus saith, That the words of a wise man are like so many
  nayles that strike the soule through, and wedge it fast. If a wise mans words
  haue that force, what efficacie shall Gods words carrie with them?
               
                  
                     Esay 45.15.
                  A certaine
  woman lifting vp her voice, &amp;c. Esay called our Sauiour Christ, The
  hidden God, Verè tu es Deus absconditus; Hidden in the Heauens.
  And for this cause some do deriue the name of Coelum, à Coelando.
  Iob he saith, Nubes latibulum eius. He was likewise hidden in
  his mothers womb; Quē coeli capere non poterant, tuo gremio
  contulisti. Who would thinke that this immensitie which the Heauens could
  not containe, should bee shut vp in so streight a roome? Hee hid himselfe also
  vnder his humanitie, insomuch that the Deuills eyes, beeing so sharpe sighted,
  and able to discerne things afarre off, could not know him, when his Diuinitie
  was hidden vnder those paines and torments which hee endured. Esay
  saith, Quasi absconditus vultus eius, It was hidden from the Worlds
  knowledge; Quis cognouit sensum Domini? Who knew the meaning of the
  Lord? The greatest Clerkes in Ierusalem said, In Beelzebub eijcit
  Daemonia, Through Belzebub hee casts out Deuills. And if any man shall
  presse mee with that place of Saint Paul, That hee was manifested and
  made knowne to the World; I answer, That he did hide himselfe, but the Father
  did manifest him in the Cratch; hee hid himselfe in the manger, but his
  swathing cloathes driueled on by the Oxe and the Asse, and the reares that
  trickled downe his cheekes, did discouer him to be Man; the Kings sought to
  conceale him, but the Sheepheards did reueale him in the Temple; his mother,
  bearing him as a Sinner in her bellie, who was to redeeme the World, did hide
  and couer him, but Simeon and Anna the Prophetesse did
  proclaime him to the world; his kneeling downe in Iordan before he was
  baptised, did hide his worth; but the opening of Heauen, and the voyce of the
  Father did declare him to be his Sonne; and the Holy-Ghost descending downe
  vpon his head in the forme of a Doue, did manifest his Maiestie. Vpon the
  Crosse, the Nayles, the Gall, the Vinegar, his wounds, his stripes, his shame,
  and his being forsaken of his Father, did hide his glorie; but the Centurion,
  the Theefe, his Executioners, the Sunne, Moone, Stones, and Sepulchres rendring
  vp their Dead, did manifest his power. And here the Scribes and Pharisees
  calling him the Minister of Beelzebub, seeke to hide him; but
  Marcella and her companions with a loud voyce, make him to be knowne
  what he was.
               
                  A certaine woman, &amp;c. In the weakenesse of this
  woman God did discouer the greatnesse of his power.God is
 woont by weake means to confound the Mightie. Of Iudith it is
  said, That a woman of the Iewes did confound the pride of
  Nebucadnezar: And here it is said, That a Iewish woman gaue the lie to
  all the power and wisedome of Ierusalem; striking the Scribes and Pharisees
  dumbe, confounding their vnderstanding, and making them ashamed. For
  Marcella 
                  
                     •
                  eeing them thus
  conuinced by the reasons of our Sauiour Christ, she lifted vp her voyce aloud,
  in token of victorie, and to shew that our Sauiour had the better of them. King
  Balthazar in the middest of all his mirth and jollitie, was with a
  hand that he espied vpon the wall, strucken as dead as a doore nayle.
  Pharaoh with a blast of Gods mouth was drowned in the Deepe;
  Flauit Spiritus eius, &amp;c. These were strange things, but much more
  strange was it, That a poore sillie old woman should with two or three words
  confute the wisedome of Ierusalem, and put them to such a nonplus that they had
  not a  word to say.
               
                  Blessed is the wombe that bare thee. Shee reckons it
  heere as a great blessing to the Virgin Marie, that she was the mother
  of such a Son; which is an epitome of all her praises and excellencies. The
  Euangelist say no more, because all that may be said of her, is contained in
  this one word, Mother. And because some blasphemous persons had taken this name
  from her, in the generall Ephesine Councell, celebrated in the time of Pope
  Celestine and Theodosius the Emperor, whereat were present
  two hundered Bishops; it was concluded, That the most blessed Virgin should be
  called Theotocos, that is, The mother of God; for that our Sauiour was
  both Gods Sonne and hers, hauing his filiation from them both. The same was
  likewise defined in the Calcedonian Councell, vnder Leo the twelfth.
  So that the same Holy-Ghost which assisted these Councells, had prompted also
  this womans tongue. Saint Bernard saith, That this great name
  Theotocos is the greatest this diuine ladie hath, or can haue. And
  because the name of Mother of God, may seem to detract somthing from the sole
  omnipotencie of God, from his goodnesse, from his wisedome, &amp; all other his
  excellent and singular attributes; left men might sinne in ouerpraising her,
  &amp; giuing too much vnto her in that kind, Epiphanius saith, It was
  fit that Heauen should put a taske and a tye vpon this our tongue, least it
  should lash out too farre. And therefore her Sonne when he was vpon the Crosse,
  and tooke his last farewell of his mother, he said vnto her, Woman, behold
  thy sonne, giuing her that name, rather than of Mother, least some
  superstitious people might attribute the Diuine nature vnto her, and so rob
  God of his honour.
               
                  And the brests which thou hast suckt. She praiseth her
  wombe and her brests.Christs conception in the heart, is
 presently discouered. There are two things entertaine a sweet
  correspondencie; a womans conception in her wombe, and the manifestation
  thereof in her brests. Iust so doth it succeed with the Soule, in it's
  conception of God, and the brest of the iust man, who thereupon doth manifest
  the guest that lodgeth there. Betweene the Vine and the Wine there is that good
  correspondencie, that the floures of the Grape participating of it's
  sweetnesse, sends forth a most pleasant odour. So likewise when the floures of
  Christ beginne to bud in the Soule, the brest of Man doth streightway thereupon
  breath forth a most sweet and redolent odour.
            
            
               
                  Beatus venter, Blessed is the wombe.
               This was Mans first Heauen; the first place wherein God bestowed
  this his greatest happinesse and blessing vpon Man. It is a happinesse to Man,
  when his Vnderstanding sees God, and when his Will loues him, taking pleasure
  therein as in his chiefest good. Now, the first eyes that saw God, and the
  first will that loued God, and placed his ioy &amp; delight therein, was that
  of our Sauior Christ; and Maries wombe being the receptacle of this
  happinesse, it came to bee mans first Heauen. The first Adam was earthly,
  because formed of earth; the second, heauenly, because formed of Heauen.
  Before this time he had no set habitation, For hee dwelt not in any house
  from the day that he brought the Children of Israel out of Aegypt, &amp;c.
  His glorie was represented in Tabernacles &amp; Tents, poore Pallaces, ywisse,
  for God: Salomon did better it with his Temple, which Fabrick was the
  worlds wonder; but not so worthie God, that our eyes could see him; well might
  our will be good. But this most blessed Virgin had fitted and prepared so rich
  a temple for him in her womb, that God himself came down to dwel there. Some
  seeme to doubt, or rather wonder, why God should so long deferre his comming
  in the flesh. He stayd so long, that the Holy-Ghost might prepare and 
   dresse vp this Temple of the Virgins Wombe, Vt
  dignum filij tui habitaculum offici mereretur, spiritu sancto cooperante,
  praeparasti, Thou didst trim vp, ô Lord, the bodie and soule of this
  blessed Virgine, and didst furnish her with thy cheese Graces, that shee might
  be made a fit and worthy pallace for thy Sonne.
               
               
                  Blessed is the Wombe. This commending of the Sonne, was
  a great honor to the Mother. The common currant is, That children doe battle
  much vpon their parents worth. And therefore they doe so vsually blazon forth
  the noble actions of their Ancestors. And by how much the more antient they
  are, the more glorious is their coat of Armes. True it is, that fathers doe
  sometimes participate of the glorie of their sonnes; according to that of
  Ecclesiasticus, Hee that teacheth his sonne,
                  
                     Eccle. 30.3. 
                  greeueth the enemy, and before
  his friends he shall reioyce of him. Of meane men, they many times come to
  be famous and renowned throughout the World. Homer relates of
  Hylacius, that the valour of his sonnes did giue him (amongst the
  Cretenses) the name of God. And when the Senate of Rome did crown any of their
  Citisens, their fathers were innobled thereby. And Ioseph, hauing
  incurred the hatred and displeasure of his brethren, because he dreamt that the
  Sunne, the Moone, and the twelue starres did adore him, the sacred Text sayth,
  That the father, Rem tacitus considerabat, did lay it vp in his heart;
  as one that did imagine, that from the prosperitie of the sonne, there might
  some honour redound to the father. Cornelius Tacitus relateth in his
  Annals, that the Emperour Tiberius beeing importuned by many, that
  amongst other his surnames, he would assume some one of his Mothers, for his
  greater honour; made answere, That the Mother was not to honour the Emperour,
  but the Emperour the Mother.
               
                  Christs pedigree the noblest, &amp; of
 longest continuance.But this their glorie is so short, that looking
  backe whence they came, they can make it scarce reach so farre, as their great
  Grandfathers. But the glorie of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, our Redeemer, did
  reach as farre as vnto King Dauid, and could draw his Pedegree from
  the Patriarch Abraham. Whome, that hee might honour them the more, he
  stiles himselfe in the Gospell to be their sonne, Filij Dauid, filij
  Abraham: where it is to be noted, that after so many ages, so many changes
  and alterations both of the times and the people, of Kings, Iudges, and
  Captaines, in the end, there being an interuention of two and fortie
  generations, the glorie of Christ attained to the hundred Grandfather. And by
  calling himselfe the sonne of Dauid and of Abraham, hee
  reuiued their remembrance, and made them thereby more famous. And if in so
  large a distance of time, it wrought so noble an effect, treading so neer vpon
  the tract of these latter times, that there was no wall now betweene the Mother
  and the Sonne, her blessed Wombe, and his most happie Birth; what a glorie must
  it be vnto her, &amp; what a happines vnto vs? Emisenus treating in a
  Sermon of his, touching the assumption of our Lady, and with what honour shee
  was receiued into Heauen, sayth, Those great riuers of glorie which the Sonne
  had gained both in Heauen and in Earth, returned backe againe that day,
  imploying their best &amp; speediest course in the honoring of his Mother.
  Saint Ambrose stiles her the forme of God; Either because shee was the
  forme or mold through which God did thus transforme himselfe, by taking our
  humane shape vpon him; or else, because the graces of God, though not in so
  great a measure, were translated or transferred ouer vnto her. A mould made of
  earth, is not bettered by the mettall which it receiueth, though it be neuer so
  good gold: But by the gold of Christs Diuinitie, the V
                     •
                  
                  gines Wombe was much the better and the purer by it.
  And therefore it is sayd, Beata, quae credidisti, Blessed art thou that
  didst beleeue; For all &amp;c. the types &amp; figures 
   and promises of God, remained more compleat and perfect
  in thee, than in any other creature.
            
            
               Quin imo, beati qui audiunt Verbum Dei, &amp; custodiunt
  illud.
               
                  But hee sayd, yea, rather blessed are they that heare the
  Word of God, and keepe it. These words may carrie with them a threefold
  sence:
               The one, That the word Quin imo may be
  aduersatiua, implying a kind of repugnancie or contradiction; and
  that correcting, as it were, what Marcella sayd, he doth mend and
  better her speech. Doost thou (saith hee) terme my mother blessed? Thou art
  deceiued; for shee is not blessed for that shee bare mee, but because she heard
  my word. And this sence is taken out of two places of Saint
  Augustine.
               
               The one, in his tenth tract vpon Saint Iohn; where he
  saith, Mater quam appellas foelicem, non inde foelix, quia in ea verbum
  caro factum est, sed quia Verba Dei custodit; That mother of myne whom
  thou callest blessed, was not therefore blessed, because in her, the Word was
  made Flesh, but because she layd vp the word of God in her heart.
               The other, in his thirtie eight Epistle, which he writes to a
  Gentleman called Letus; who being newly conuerted, was shrewdly layd
  at by his mother (persuading him all that she possibly could, that he should
  not proceed in this his determination:) And proouing vnto him, That in this
  cause he ought to denie and hate that mother that had brought him forth
  according to the flesh, and to follow the Church, by which he was regenerated
  &amp; borne anew according to the Spirit. Amongst many other weightie reasons
  to mooue him thereunto, hee vrgeth this amongst the rest; Thy King and thy
  Emperour Christ (saith he) had a mother, and such a mother as neuer man had the
  like: and being one day busie in preaching, (which was Heauens businesse) they
  told him, That his mother and his brethren were without at the doore, expecting
  that he should come forth vnto them. But he stretching out his hand to his
  Disciples, said, Quae mater? Et qui fratres mei? Who is my mother, and who
  my bretheren? My mother and my brethren are they who doe the will of my
  Father; as for any other Kindred or bloud I acknowledge none. Summing vp (saith
  Saint Augustine) in this number, etiam ipsam Virginem Mariam,
  euen the Virgin Marie her selfe. For the name of Mother is terrestriall,
  temporall, and transitorie; but that kindred which is contracted by hearing
  Gods Word, is celestiall and euerlasting. If this doubt had had it's occasion
  thus, or that the case stood so, that this good and holy woman
  Marcella had not knowne and acknowledged our Sauiour Iesus Christ to
  be God, nor the blessed Virgin to be his mother, this
  
                     •
                  ence had then beene verie plaine,
  and no scruple to be made of it: for the dignitie of mother should not haue
  come to a lesser degree of grace, than that which the Virgin inioyed.
               The second sence or meaning is, That this particle Quin
  imo is comparatiua,
                  The Virgin not blessed for
 bearing Christ but beleeuing in him. comparatiuely spoken, or by way of
  comparison. Thou callest my mother blessed, for that she is my mother; thou
  sayest well: but more blessed is shee in that she heares my Word. This sence is
  likewise taken out of Saint Augustine, Libro de sancta
  Virginitatepunc; Where he saith, Beatior suit Maria concipiendo
  
                        •
                     ente, quam ventre, Marie was
  happier in the conception of her mind, than of her wombe. And anon after,
  Foelicius gestauit corde, quam car
                        •
                     e, She bore him more happily in the Spirit, than the Flesh.
  This opinion is followed by Saint Cyprian, Iustine Martyr, and
  generally by all the moderne Doctours; and this of all other is the plainest,
  and that which doth best open o
                     •
                  r
  Sauiour Christs intention and purpose.
               
                  First, Because the Greeke word, which
  answereth to Quin imo, is neither a Negatiue, nor an Affirmatiue.
               Secondly, because this happinesse beeing granted vnto those who
  saw and beheld our Sauior Christ with their eyes; it is not to be supposed,
  that it should bee denyed to his Mother that had brought him foorth, and bred
  him vp. Besides, the Virgine said of her selfe, All nations shall call me
  blessed, Not only for that aboundance of grace which God had
  bestowed vpon her, but also for that he had inriched her with so many great
  priuiledges, whereof the dignitie of a Mother was not the least. Saint
  Austen indeering the greatnesse thereof saith, That the heart
  could not conceiue it, nor the tongue expresse it: And Anselmus,
  That next to the greatnesse of the Son, there was not any greatnesse either in
  Heauen or in Earth, which was any way comparable to that of the Mother: And S.
  Bernard, That by how much the more was her vicinitie with the word; by
  so much the more was her excellencie in Heauen. Whence some Schoolemen inferre,
  that this dignitie doth exceed al those other treasures of grace which were to
  be found in the Virgine. Iustine sayth of Olimpia, that
  howbeit she might boast herselfe much of the Kingdome of Troy, from whence she
  was descended, &amp; from other kingdomes which she might claime from her
  father, her brother, and her husband, who was Philip King of Macedon;
  yet could she glorie in no one thing more, than that she was Mother to
  Alexander the Great, who was Emperor of the world. How much more
  strongly doth this reason hold in the most blessed Virgine?
               
                  To bee the wife or daughter of a King a
 greater honour, than to be his Mother.Yet notwithstanding all this,
  nothing comparable is the dignitie of a Mother to that of a daughter or a wife.
  And if it had bin left to this our most blessed Virgins choice, whether she
  had rather haue been the Mother of God, or his Spouse and best Beloued, shee
  would questionlesse haue rather chosen to haue beene his Beloued. And the same
  is implyed by those seueral imployments of Martha and Mary.
  As the Virgin was a Mother, she did Marthas office, affoording her
  bre
                     ••
                  s to our Sauior Christ,
  wrapping him vp in his swadling clouts, breeding him and attending vpon him:
  But as she was a Daughter and a Spouse, she did Maries dutie, hauing
  her eare still eyed to his mouth, and diligently listening to those heauenly
  words that proceeded from thence. And there arising a quarrell betwix
                     •
                   these two sisters, which of them loued
  our Sauior best; our Sauior soon decided the controuersie, when he sayd,
  Mary hath chosen the better part. And this is made cleere in the
  example of the Queene Mother, and the Prince that is heire to his Fathers
  Kingdome. The Queene no doubt hath a great part in the King and Kingdome; But
  the Prince more, who must one day commaund all. King S

  had taken possession of the Kingdome, he offered his seruice vnto her, and that

  word.
               The glorious Doctor Saint Austen say
                     •
                  h▪ That which passeth amongst
  Na
                     ••
                  
                  ons, passeth likewise amongst
  Men. God preferred the Iewes before all other Nations, Non fecit taliter
  
                        ••
                     ni nationi, &amp;c. He had not
  dealt so with any other Nation, &amp;c. Nor had they that oddes and
  aduantage of others, in regard onely of  those great and
  many wonders that he had wrought for them, but because hee had reuealed his
  heart and bosome vnto them. The finenesse of friendship, and the pure alloy
  thereof, doth not consist in this, that my purse is open vnto thee, and that
  thou share with me in my wealth and riches, but that there is not that secret
  in my heart, which I doe not communicate vnto thee. I haue termed yee my
  friends, for whatsouer was deliuered vnto me of my Father, the same haue I made
  known vnto you. The Apostle Saint Paul askes the question, What
  aduantage the Iew had of the Gentiles? And what Circumcision did benefit them
  more than others? And his answer is, A great deale; First, because God hath
  more particularly reuealed himselfe vnto them, &amp;c. Many wore the
  fauours which God had done them; but the greatest that euer he did them, was
  the reuealing of his Word vnto them, the imparting of his secrets vnto them,
  and trusting them therewithall. And so it passeth likewise betwixt man and
  man, where there is true loue and friendship indeed. It is said in the third of
  Saint Iohn, He that hath the Bride,
                  
                     Iohn
 3.29. 
                  is the Bridegroome; but the friend of the Bridegroome

                        •
                     h greatly because of the
  Bridegroomes voyce. The Euangelist here treateth of Saint Iohn
  Baptist, and saith, That to the Husband of the Church, which is our
  Sauiour Iesus Christ, the Spouse meerly belongeth; but for the office of a
  friend, such a one as was Saint Iohn Baptist, it appertained vnto him,
  to assist this louing Couple, and to keepe the Bridegroome and the Bride
  companie, and to hearken vnto them with a great deale of contentment and
  pleasure. Si Verbum Dei, (saith Saint Augustine) &amp;c.
  If the Word of God which is preached in the Church, thou shalt receiue it with
  fulnesse of Faith, and trunesse of deuotion; that Word shall become whatsoeuer
  thou wilt haue it to be: It shall be vnto thee like Manna, which fitted it

                  tes, there
  being not that palate and appetite which it did not please and affect,
  according to it's owne relish.
               The third sence and meaning, which is no lesse literall than the
  former, presupposeth two things:
               The one, That this woman was strucken into a double amazement or
  astonishment.
               First, Of the strangenesse of the miracle.
               Secondly, Of the incredulitie and obstinacie of the
  Pharisees.
               The other, That these words are more directed to the praise and
  commendation of the Sonne, than the Mother. And therefore when as here
  Marcella lifted vp her voyce and said, Blessed was that mother
  that brought thee forth, and the paps that gaue thee sucke; her maine and
  principall intent was, the commendation of her sonne, and inclusiuely an
  honouring likewise of the mother. But our Sauiour Christ was willing thereupon
  to shew and make knowne to the World, how vnequal an estimation this is, which
  we make of these kind of goods; for, to cast out Deuils, and the doing besides
  of strange and wonderfull miracles, worldly men, and those that looke onely on
  the outside of things▪ preferre them vsually before the iustification of
  their soules. And this woman crying out, occasioned by the greatnesse and
  strangenesse of this miracle, Blessed bee the wombe that bare thee, &amp;
  the brests that thou didst sucke: He presently addes thereupon, Nay
  rather blessed are they which heare the Word of God and keepe it. If thou
  doost so much admire and wonder to see Deuills throwne out of mens bodies, thou
  wilt meruaile much more, to see them cast out of their soules. And being that
  my Word is so powerfull, as to free soules from this seruitude and tyrannie;
  more happie ought yee to hold mee, for those famous and renowned miracles which
  by my Word I worke in your soules, than for those which by my workes I 
   doe vpon your bodies. Thou therefore who preseruest both
  bodie and soule, bring vs to euerlasting life.
            
         
         
            THE NINETEENTH SERMON, VPON THE MONDAY AFTER THE THIRD SONDAY
IN LENT.
            
               
                  
                     LVC. 4.23.

               Nothing more fierce, than the fury of the
  people.
               THe Argument of this piece of Scripture, is a Plesto or
Suit in law betweene our Sauiour Christ and the Townesmen of Nazareth, where
our Sauiour Christ had beene bred vp. A wofull case, not onely because it was
with an Incorporation, but with an ignorant companie of Townesmen, that were
enuious, and apt to mutine, A tribus timuit cor meum, (saith
Ecclesiasticus) There bee three things that myne heart feareth;
                  Eccle. 26.5. Treason in a Citie; the Tumultuous
assembly of the People; and False accusation. Homer said of
Pallas the Goddesse of War and Discord, That she delighted much in
three things:
            The Owle.
            The Dragon.
            And, the common People.
            The Owle is the emblem of Ignorance.
            The Dragon, of Enuie.
            The common People, of Furie.
            These three Beasts did conspire against our Sauiour Christ; laying
to his charge, That he contemned his owne Countrie, because hee had not wrought
such miracles there, as he had in Capernaum.
            Entring one day into the Synagogue, and sitting him downe in the
Chaire, he opened the booke of the Prophets, and the Law; where hee lighted
vpon that place of Esay,
               
                  Esay 61.7.
               The Spirit of the Lord God is vpon me, therefore hath the Lord annoynted 
 me. And expounding that place of himselfe, he said,
Vtique dicetis,
               
                  Luke. 4. 
               &amp;c.
Yee will surely say vnto me this Prouerb, Physition,

                     •
                  eale thy selfe: Whatsoeuer we haue
heard done in Capernaum, doe it here likewise in thyne owne Countrie. That
Physition doth amisse, who is forgetfull of his owne house, and does famous
Cures in other mens houses. We haue heard that thou hast done great miracles
and strange wonders in Capernaum; Fac &amp; hic in patria tua, Let vs see
if thou canst do the like in thyne owne. And this is the Charge, the
Complaint, and the Accusation which they make against him.
            
               Quanta audiuimus facta in Capernaum?
               The occasion of this Complaint, were needlesse jealousies.
  Generally, the whole Nation of the Iewes were jealous of their owne profit, and
  enuious of other mens prosperitie. Esay cals them Zelantes
  Populos, A jealous People.
                  
                     Esay 26. And
  the Nazarites did the rather picke this quarrell with our Sauiour, by reason of
  the neighbouring occasion that was giuen them.
               Capernaum was a most faire &amp; beautifull Citie, as well in
  regard of the goods of Fortune, as of the nature of the Seat; it was scituated
  neere vnto the Sea, vpon the riuer of Iordan, in that most fertile and
  pleasant soyle of the Prouince of Galilee; her buildings were stately and
  sumptuous, excellent was the commodiousnesse &amp; conueniencie of it's
  scituation, for Hauens, for Shipping, for Traffique, &amp; for it's number of
  rich and wealthie Citisens: but was made much more glorious by many other
  particulars, some whereof we shall repeat vnto you.
               First, It pleased our Sauiour Christ to make choice of this
  place for his habitation;The glory of Capernaum.
  whence it came to passe, that they called it his Countrie, and his Citie.
               Secondly, Because he there first began to preach the Gospel;
  fulfilling therein (saith Saint Mathew) that Prophecie of
  Esay, The darkenesse shall not be according to the affliction that it
  had when at the first he touched lightly the land of Zebulon, and the
  land of Nepthalie; nor afterwards,
                     Esay 9.12.
  when he was more grieuous by the way of the sea beyond Iordan in Galilee, of
  the Gentiles; The people that walked in darkenesse haue seen a great light;
  they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, vpon them hath the light
  shined.
               Thirdly, For those many miracles which he wrought therein; as
  that of him that was sicke of the Palsey, and let downe from the house top;
  that of the dumbe man that was possessed with a Deuill; that of the Centurions
  Seruant; that of the woman, who touching the hemme of his garment was cured
  of her bloudie Fluxe, which shee had beene sicke of so many yeares before.
  Heere did he raise vp the daughter of the Archisynagoguian; and heere did hee
  giue sight vnto the Blinde; besides many other, vnmentioned by the
  Euangelists.
               Fourthly, After his Resurrection hee threw a thousand fauours
  vpon that Countrie. A few paces from that Citie he appeared to Peter,
  Thomas,
                  
                     Iohn 21. and
  Nathaniel, who had fisht all night and caught nothing; willing them
  to cast the Net out vpon the right side of the Ship. And, as Brocardus
  reporteth it, vpon a stone of that riuer he left the print of the soles of his
  feet three seuerall times. With these his fauours he had stirred vp such enuies
  and jealousies in those of his own Countrie, that they said vnto him,
  Physition, heale thy selfe. But our Sauior Christ directed all these
  to the Nazarites good, to the end that these their jealousies might master
  their incredulitie and rebellion, and put spurres to their desires. A father
  hath two sonnes, one much made of, the other neglected and disgraced; this kind
  vsage makes the better beloued of the two, obstinate, churlish, and 
   vnquiet: And because that jealousies and enuie may
  breake this his hardnesse of nature, and mollifie this his stubborne condition,
  he calls this slouenly, tatter'd, and despised child of his, and sayes vnto
  him, Thou art my sonne and my beloued. This faire kind of course did God first
  take with the Iewes. For his loue to them did he plague Aegypt, diuide the sea,
  drowne Pharaoh, rob the Aegyptians of their Iewells, suffered not
  their garments to grow old, nor their shooes on their feet to weare out, fed
  them with bread from Heauen, gaue them water out of the rocke, a Piller seruing
  them by night for a Torch, by day for a Tent: In conclusion, these his ouer
  great fauours and courtesies toward them, made them so hard hearted and so
  vnthankfull, that they prouoked God by a Calfe, giuing thereunto the glorie of
  their deliuerance out of Aegypt. This their adoring of a Beast was a strange
  kind of beastlinesse. God hereupon called this ragged child vnto him, and
  threw his loue vpon the Gentiles, who liued before in disfauour and disgrace;
  and said vnto the Gentile, Thou art my sonne. You see him now cast off,
                     Deut. 31. that was yesterday a Fauourite, and
  carries that thom in his bosome, which doth continually pricke him: And
  therefore it is sayd, I will giue them a Spirit that shall sting them;
  a worme that shall still lie gnawing at the verie heart of them. Yesterday God
  had his house &amp; his habitation among the Iewes, his name was called vpon by
  them; but now you see them cast off, trodden vnder foot, trampled on, hated,
  abhorred, infamous, without honour, without a Citie, without a Temple, without
  Prophets. The calling of the Gentiles, the miracles that are wrought amongst
  them, the many fauours that are affoorded them, are so many nayls driuen
  through their soules, &amp; with tears guttring downe their cheekes, they now
  crie out with Ieremie, Our Inheritance is turned vnto strangers.
  Saint Ambrose saith, That God did doe this of purpose, that through an
  emulation of zeale, the Iewes might bee conuerted vnto Christ. Which is all one
  with that of Saint Paul,
                  
                     Rom. 11.
                  Through their fall, saluation commeth vnto the Gentiles, to prouoke them to
  follow them. In a word, To be thrust out of fauour, and to haue another
  come in grace in his roome, cannot but be a great torment and affliction to
  the partie disgraced.
            
            
               
                  Quanta audiuimus? What great things haue wee
  heard?
               
                  Tis naturall in all men to loue their
 Country.The reasons which they may alledge for themselues are these:
               First of all, Amongst those good seeds which God hath sowne in
  our brest, one is, The loue of our Countrie: Many haue preferred it before the
  loue of friends, kindred, parents, nay, before themselues, their estates, and
  liues. Thomas saith, That next vnto God we ought not to beare so much
  loue to anything, as to our Countrie: he prooues it to be an heroicall vertue,
  to enioy that name, for the which we respect God, to wit, Pittie. And they that
  denie this loue vnto their Countrie, we hold them to be men deuoyd of pittie,
  barbarous, and cruell. Saint Augustine in his Bookes De Ciuitate
  Dei, Thomas, and Valerius Maximus, quote many examples of men
  most famous in their loue to their Country: As of one Codrus, whose
  enemies hauing receiued answer from the Oracle, That if Codrus should
  be slaine in the battell, they should lose the victorie; entred in disguise, of
  purpose to be killed. Of Curtius, who for Romes safetie desperatly
  leaped into that deepe pit. Of Sylla's Host in Praeneste, who taking
  that city by force of Armes, and making Proclamation, That all the Citisens
  should be put to the sword, saue his host; said, I wil not receiue my life from
  him that is the destroyer of my Countrie. Of one Thrasibulus, whom
  the Athenians went forth to receiue with so many Crownes as they were Citisens.
  Numberlesse are those examples which wee find in prophane stories. And in those
  that are sacred  we meet with that one of
  Dauid, and that other of Iudith, who aduentured their liues
  for their Countrie. In a word, Nature (as Saint Hierome saith)
  planted this loue with that deepe rooting in our brests, that Lucian
  said, That the smoke of our owne Chimnies was farre better than the fire of
  other mens. And Plutarch affirmeth, That euerie man commends the ayre
  of his owne Country. Hierocles stiles this loue, a new God, and our
  first and greatest father. Silius Italicus introduceth a father
  notifying to his sonne, That not any fouler sinne did descend vnto Hell, than a
  mans opposing himselfe against his owne Countrie.
               This loue being so due a debt, and so deseruing our pittie, it
  causeth no small admiration, that Christ our Sauior should grow so cold toward
  his owne Countrie, and multiplie such a companie of miracles vpon other the
  Cities of Iudea and Israell, and performe so few in Nazareth, where he was
  bred.
               Secondly, This difficultie is increased by the Nazarites iust
  request; alledging, That since he had preached in his owne Citie such a new
  and strange kind of Doctrine, there was a great deale of reason that he should
  confirme the same by miracles: For, put case that this had not beene his owne
  natiue Country, yet was it a generall debt, which he had paid to other
  Cities.
               Thirdly, because in expounding that place of Esay,
                  
                     Esay 61.1. 
                  The Spirit of the Lord is vpon me,
  because he hath annointed me, that I should preach the Gospell to the
  poore, he said, That that prophecie was fulfilled in himself, being that
  annointed Messias there spoken of: Which being so, it was fit that hee should
  prooue it by those signes and miracles which were prophecied of the
  Messias.
               Fourthly,
                     Marc. 6.5. This
  difficultie is indeered by that which the Euangelist S. Marke
  reporteth of our Sauiour Christ; to wit, That hee could doe no great workes in
  Nazareth: As if his vertue and power had beene hindered and debarred of doing
  them; insomuch that it made our Sauiour Christ to meruaile much at it.
               Fiftly, If the sinnes of Nazareth did thus bind his hands, more
  were those of Capernaum, which he compared to Sodome;
                     Luc. 10. 
                  For if the miracles had beene done in
  Tyrus and Sydon which haue beene done in you, they had a great while a goe
  repented, sitting in Sackcloth and Ashes. Therefare it shall be easier for
  Tyrus and Sydon at the Iudgement, than for you. Greater were those of
  Bethsaida and Chorazin; Vae tibi Bethsayda, vae tibi Chorazin &amp;c.
  And greater were those of Ierusalem;
                     Math.
 11. whereof Ezechiel said, Samaria dimidium peccatorum
  tuorum non peccauit, vicisti eas sceleribus tuis.
               
               Sixtly, He had done other greater honours to Nazareth; there he
  was incarnated in the wombe of the Virgin Marie, which of all other
  miracles was the greatest. He tooke his name from Nazareth, as it appeareth by
  that his title vpon the Crosse; by that which the Deuills roared forth; and by
  that which our Sauiour himselfe said to Saint Paul, I am Iesus of Nazareth,
  Ego sum Iesus Nazarenus, &amp;c. And therefore hauing giuen the more, it
  was not much hee should giue the lesse.
               Seuenthly, Miracles were that milke which the Iews were bred vp
  with, and had beene antiently accustomed vnto, Iudea signa petunt, &amp;c.
  The Iewes demand a signe. Esay importuned King Achab, That he
  would aske signes from Heauen, Earth, or Hell; Pete tibi signum à
  Domino, &amp;c. Moses and Gideon desired signes, and therefore
  his children should haue beene bettered thereby, and more especially those of
  his owne Countrie. After that Ioseph had furnished Aegypt with corne,
  he set open Granaries to the neighbouring Prouinces.
               Lastly, It was prophecied of the Messias, That hee should bee no
  accepter of persons: He was Lord of al, &amp; to al (in al reason) he should
  shew himselfe equall  and indifferent: so that it seemeth
  to carrie a great shew of sorrow and resentment with it, which those of
  Nazareth obiected vnto him; We haue heard what thou hast done in Capernaum,
  doe it here likewise in thine owne Countrie.
               
               But for the better vnderstanding of that which our Sauior Christ
  did answer to this complaint and accusation of theirs;
               First of all, we must suppose, That our Sauiour Christ shewed
  himselfe with his most blessed Mother, in foure occasions: For albeit it bee a
  holy thing for the children to honour their parents; yet this honour is to be
  done them when Gods cause interposeth not it selfe, who is the vniuersall
  Father of vs all. But when there shall be an incounter of our liking and loue
  towards two seueral fathers, he that created me, and he that begot mee; wee
  are to haue recourse vnto our heauenly Father, in regard of whom, all the other
  fathers in the world are but Stepfathers. In this sence Saint Gregorie
  doth expound that place of Saint Luke,
                  
                     Luke
 14. 
                  He that forsaketh not father and mother to follow me, is not
  worthie of me. Which is to be vnderstood in such things which appertaine
  to our spiritual saluation; as it is noted by the said Doctor, and Clemens
  Alexandrinus.
               
               
                  Christs works of two sorts.Secondly,
  Saint Austen noteth, That in our Sauiour Christ two kind of works may
  be considered:
               The one, Of a pure Man.
               The other, Of a Redeemer and heauenly Master.
               In the first, he was subiect to his mother, and his father
  Ioseph: so saith S. Luke, Et erat subditus illis.
               
               In the second, he was to haue recourse vnto his heauenly Father;
  And therefore he said, Nesciabitis, quod in his quae patris mei sunt,
  oportet me esse? He was at the Wedding by his mothers appointment; but
  when hee came to the working of the miracle, he said, Quid mihi &amp; tibi
  Mulier? Woman, what haue I to doe with thee? And when they aduised him
  whilest he was preaching, That his mother and his Kinsefolkes were waiting
  there for him; hee answered, Quae est M
                        •
                     
                     ter mea, &amp;c.
               
               Thirdly, We haue two Countries:
               Earth the one.
               Heauen the other.
               In that, our Bodies were borne.
               In this, our Soules.
               Now, when the desires of the Earth incounter with those of
  Heauen, our recourse must be to Heauen: following therein the aduice of
  Dauid, Audi Fili
                        •
                     , &amp; vide,
  obliuiscere populum tuum, &amp; domus patris tui, Heare ô Daughter, and
  see, forget thy owne people, and the house of thy father. Our Sauiours
  naturall Countrie was Heauen; but here on earth, Nazareth. Now this Countrie
  did not desire miracles for to increase their beleefe, but for other respects,
  which wee will declare hereafter: And therefore Christ would not worke any
  miracles amongst them.
               
                  Why our Sauiour would worke no miracles in
 Capernaum.And assuming those reasons which Christ might alledge for
  himselfe:
               The first is prooued by that Prouerbe which our Sauiour cited,
  No Prophet is accepted in his owne Countrie. Or as Saint
  Mathew and Saint Marke haue it There is no Prophet that
  is honoured in his owne Countrie, nay rather doth not suffer
  dishonour.
               
               And this is made good both by diuine and humane learning; and
  there are more instances thereof, than there are sands in the sea.
  Moses being but a child, his parents put him into the riuer, leauing
  him to his venture, to sinke or swim.  
                  Exposito autem
  illo; which the Syriacke reads, Cumque fuisset expositus à
  populo suo. When he came to be a man, one of his own Nation put him in
  danger of his life,
                     Act. 7. Exod. 2.
                  Pharaoh sending after him to haue him apprehended. Afterward, being
  Captaine and Commander of the People, they did often mutinie,
                     Num 23. and not onely did murmure in secret
  against him, but with open throat did publiquely blaspheme.
                     Exod. 15. Num. 14. 
                  Aaron and
  Marie that were so neere allyed vnto him, vsed him like a Turke or a
  Moore, because he had married an Aethyopian woman. Dathan and
  Abiram vpbraided him to his face, asking him,
                     Num. 16. Whither hee meant tyrannously to vsurpe
  the Gouernment? Ioseph was so honoured by the Aegyptians, that they
  accounted him as a second King; Vno tantum regni solio te praecedam.
  His brethren put him downe into a pit, and sould him for a Slaue.
  Dauid was beloued and honored of the people, and of all the whole
  land besides; but his father in law,1. Kings
 19. and his owne sonne sought to take away his life and kingdome from
  him.
                     Esay 65. 
                  Esay was spit at by
  the people, and ill intreated by them. Ieremie was mockt, scoffed
  at,
                     Hier. 20. and di
                     •
                  esteemed; and at last they set him in a paire of
  Stockes. Pashur the High-Priest smote Ieremiah the Prophet,
  and put him in the Stockes which were in the high gate of Beniamin,
  that was by the house of the Lord: And (as Tertullian reporteth it)
  was lastly stoned to death. At the Prophet Elisha, the boyes did hoot
  in the streets, crying out Bald-pate, bald pate. Elias,
                  3. Reg. ca. vlt. Micah. 2. was persecuted by King
  Ahab and his Queene. Michah, was continually clapt vp in
  prison, Et alij ludibria &amp; verbera experti, &amp;c.
               
               In humane Stories we read, that Hannibal was banished
  from Carthage after he had triumphed ouer so many Romane Emperours.
  Lycurgus, was pelted out of Lacedemonia with stones, the Oracles
  hauing as it were celebrated him for a god. Solon, was thrust out of
  Athens after he had giuen them such wholsome Lawes. Themistocles,
  after hee had innobled his Commonwealth with sundrie honourable seruices, was
  forced to flye to the Persians, where King Xerxes receiued him with a
  great deale of honour. Bookes are so full of these examples, that it were an
  endlesse labour to relate them. That glorious Doctor Saint Ierome
  giues it as an aduice, That he who desires to bee famous, must forsake his owne
  Countrie. He that goes to Flanders, or to the Indies, after hee comes home is
  the better respected. Clement the Pope reporteth, That in the
  Primitiue Church the people would flock to the Sermon of a stranger. The fourth
  Carthaginian Councell made a Decree, that it the Bishops did passe through any
  Townes that were not within their own Iurisdiction, that the Gouernors of those
  places should inuite them to bestow a Sermon on them. In a word, The first in
  whose nose Lazarus stunke, was Martha. For there is no
  Prophet that is esteemed in his owne Countrey.
               Some man may chance to aske me, vpon what this monstrousnesse in
  nature is grounded? Saint Ambrose, Saint Ierome, and Saint
  Chrysostome are all of opinion,
                     Luke
 4. That Enuie is the leauen of this ill, as it was of all other euills
  in the World. Saint Chrysostome askes the question, what hurt a
  Prophet doth, that Enuie should thus bite him with her venimous teeth? And I
  answer, Because she doth not enuie the bad, but the good. Caine
  (sayth Saint Iude) did therefore kill his brother because his workes
  were good.
               
                  Thomas sayth, That Enuy is a sorrowing or repining at
  another mans good;The nature of
 
                        〈◊〉
                     . for that it is
  presumed, that it doth lessen and diminish their own honor. For the hurt which
  a man may do to himself and others, our wishes against that man proceeds not so
  much of Enuy as of Zeale. And so is it noted by S. Gregorie. A Tyrant
  goes foorth with the Vare of an Alcalde de corte; it greeues
  me, and I am heartily sorry  for the harme that hee doth
  to the Commonwealth, and his owne conscience. Saint Augustine prooues,
  That it is charitie to desire the hurt of a mans bodie, for the good of his
  soule. According to that of Dauid, Imple facies eorum ignominia, &amp;
  confundentur, Fill their faces with shame, and they will bee confounded.
  Neither is that sorrow which I receiue for myne enemies good fortune, to bee
  termed so much enuie, as enmitie. Saint Augustine saith, That euerie
  equal, enuies his equall, because he hath got the start of him, and is crept
  before him. And this is the most vsuall and ordinarie kind of enuie, as it is
  deliuered by Aristotle in his Rhethorickes. The Inferiour
  enuieth the Superior, because he is not equal vnto him; the Superiour, the
  Inferiour, lest he should come to equall him.
               The principall harmes of this vice are three:
               The first, It p
                     •
                  ts
  great incredultie into the brest of him that enuies the fel
                     •
                  citie of the Enuied. And this it
  easily effecteth: for, whatsoeuer is first soured by the Will, is euer ill
  receiued by the Vnderstanding.
               The second, If the prosperitie be verie notorious indeed, it
  torments the verie heart of the Enuious, for that it is an eclipsing and
  obscuring of his reputation and honour.
               The third, When the Enuious can no other way doe him hurt, he
  endeauors to take away the life of him that is enuied; as Caine did
  Abels, and as Saul would haue done the like by
  Dauid. And for that those of Nazareth did behold our Sauiour Christ,
  when at most, to be their equall; and seeing that hee dispeopled Townes, and
  peopled dispeopled Deserts, they did so much enuie this his glorie, that first
  of all they did not beleeue in him: secondly, they sought to discredit him;
  and not being able otherwise to hurt him, they went about to breake his
  necke.
               Some one perhaps will aske me, What aduantage the Naturall hath
  of the Stranger, for to set such an edge on our enuie? I answer, That too
  much familiaritie causeth contempt, and this our Sauiours conuersing with
  them, was the cause of their neglecting of him. To be Towne-borne children, to
  be bred vp from the cradle to the Schoole, and from the Schoole, to boyes
  sports and pastimes, is a great enemie to the future cōceiuing of a worthie
  opinion of that Prophet, Iudge, or Gouernour. And therefore it is well obserued
  by Saint Ierome, They doe not weigh his present worth, but haue an eye to
  his former infancie. They that are neerest Neighbours to a good Corrector
  or Inquisitor, are farthest off from conceiuing a good opinion of him.
  Plutarch saith, That the spots in the Moone arise from the vapours of
  the earth, for that the earth is neerer to this than any other of the Planets.
  And, as it is in the Prouerbes, Laruin vezinzad, siempre mancha; None
  soyle and spot our name worse, than those that are our neerest neighbours,
  especially being ill conditioned.
               
                  Admiration waits not, but on things that are
 rare.Besides, Common things neuer cause admiration: according to that of
  Saint Augustine, touching the iustification of our soules. For though
  this bee a greater miracle than the casting of Deuills out of our bodies, yet
  we make no such wonder of it. And in another place he saith, That the motion of
  the Heauens, the influences of the Planets, the course of the Starres, the
  Waters, Winds, and Tempests, are meruailous miracles; for albeit that they keep
  on in their course by the order of nature, yet, that nature should conserue
  this order for so many Ages, it is a verie great miracle: yet wee make no such
  wonder of it. And because our Countrie, and al that good which it containeth
  (es pan casero de cada dis) is euerie day bred with vs, wee make no
  such wonder of it, it is not dainty vnto vs; and because it is common, we
  account not of it.
               
                  Againe, there is this difference betwixt
  secular and Ecclesiasticall Princes; That in them we loue the succession of
  bloud, &amp; much esteem of this line all discent in nature; and for this
  cause we couet a naturall King, and abhorre the election of a Crowne or
  Scepter. But in these other, we couet strangers, and abhorre our owne bloud,
  it seeming vnto vs, That Wisedome and Prudence is treasured vp in some more
  hidden and secret place: making vse of that saying of Iob, Sapientia de
  occultis.
               
               The second reason why our Sauior did not doe those miracles the
  Nazarites desired, was, To teach both Prince and Prelate not to haue an eye to
  flesh and bloud, but to worth and desert. Iudas his Bishopricke being
  voyd, two worthie persons were in competition for it, Matthias and
  Ioseph, who being our Sauiours Kinseman, had the syrname of
  Iust: but the lot fell vpon Matthias, because no man should
  presume to thinke, that flesh and bloud should strike the stroke with God.
                     Math. 4. The Iewes had the descendencie of
  Abraham for their refuge and defence, but Saint Iohn Baptist
  did aduise them, That the boasting of their pedegree would be no safe
  Sanctuarie for them to flie from Gods anger. For the affection to flesh and
  bloud must not make a Prince to swarue from the way of justice, like those
  Kyne that carried the Arke to Beth shemesh. That there is a
  Melchisedech that neither acknowledgeth father nor mother, nor any
  genealogie, it is a great priuiledge of diuine both fauour and power.
  Ismael pretended the birthright by the flesh; Isaac, by the
  Spirit: but when God came to sentence this businesse, he said, Eijce
  ancillam &amp; filiumeius, Put them both out of house and home, mother and
  sonne. The mother was in no fault; but God would not that the sonne should
  gather heart by his mothers presence. By the same Plea did Abimeleck
  the sonne of Gideon pretend the Kingdome; Os vestrum &amp; caro
  vestra sum,
                  
                     Iud. 9. 
                  I am your bone
  and your flesh. In the Pallaces of your earthly Princes this poynt is much
  stood vpon; but the Prince of Heauen could not be drawne out of this respect to
  doe any miracles in Nazareth.
               The third reason was,To chal

                     enge any thing frō God as due, is the
 way to go without it. because the Nazarites seemed to claime these
  things of our Sauior, as it were by right, and as their due; when as God doth
  confer these his heauenly blessings vpon vs, meerely of grace: we can challenge
  nothing, it is his bountie that we must be beholding vnto. Saint
  Ambrose saith, That our Sauiour Christ cured strangers, and not those
  of Nazareth that were his Countrimen, Because this medicine was of grace,
  not of place; not tyed to their Nation, but his inclination. Diuine
  blessings are conferred by creation, not transferred by propagation: it is like
  vnto your shoures in May, which go scudding and coasting along, leauing (as
  Amos saith) one field wet, and another drie: and this is a kind of
  fortune or lot that falls vpon one that least thinkes of it; and this Language
  of Lot is often vsed in Scripture. Those of Capernaum,
                     Psal. 30. Wisd. 1. Coloss. 1.
 Eph. 1 those of Bethsaida, those of Chorazin, and those of
  Ierusalem, were happely greater sinners than they; but God did not remooue from
  them neither his Miracles nor his Doctrine. But no farther reason hereof is to
  be required, than Gods owne wil, who may doe with his owne what he thinkes
  good.
               The fourth reason for confirmation of what is past, may be the
  Nazarites curiositie; Why more here, than there? Or why more to that man, than
  to mee? And other innumerable demands which the Flesh is woont to propose. It
  is a kind of rashnesse, not to submit our vnderstanding to Gods diuine
  prouidence: this is a smoke that blinds the eyes of Reason, it is a buzzing
  about the coelestiall flame, like the Butter-flie that flutters about the
  light of a candle, who, quaerendo lucem, inuenit lathum, seeking after
  light, scortches her wings, and procures her  death.
  The generall cause (aske thou neuer so many questions) is the will of God; this
  is causa causarum, the cause of causes. Why were more miracles wrought
  in Capernaum, than in Nazareth? Voluntas Dei est, (saith
  Saluianus) Why? God would haue it so. Now, to aske of God a
  reason of his wil, is, as if a slaue should aske the same of his Master, a
  Subiect of his Soueraigne, or the Clay of the Potter;

  actions. Shall the Clay say to the Potter, What doost thou doe? or, Why

  hast thou begotten? or to his mother, What hast thou brought forth? The
  best vnderstanding of man in things appertaining vnto God, is not to
  vnderstand; and the truest knowledge, not to know. Thou condemnest that
  stranger, who makes a foolish judgement of the Lawes of that Countrie which he
  doth not truely vnderstand; and darest thou be so rash, as to censure the
  Decrees of Heauen?

  by searching finde out vestigia Dei, the steps of God? Weigh well, I pray
  ye, the word Vestigia, and if too much curiositie in naturall causes,
  is counted a great fault, and that the soundest Phylosophie is that, which
  inquiring after the first causes, hath recourse vnto God; What are we then to
  do in those things that are supernaturall and diuine? Theodoret
  doubteth, Why Moses saying, That Tygris and Euphrates spring from
  Paradice; so many other Authors should auouch, That their well-head is in the
  mountaines of Armenia▪ Whereunto I answer, That for as much as some Riuers
  are hid vnderneath the earth, and begin to rise and shew themselues some
  leagues farther off; so Tigris and Euphrates, hauing their springing from
  Paradice, are buried in the earth, and afterwards breake out againe into diuers
  parts; God so ordaining it, That he might cut off mans superfluous
  curiositie. For there might haue beene some so curious, that following
  the rising of these Riuers, would haue pretended to haue made a discouerie of
  Paradice. But God did shut vp the passage to this their humane curiositie, lest
  they should haue gone on in the pursuit of this their entent, either through
  want of prouision in those sandie and desert places, or through the
  inaccessablenesse of those mountaines that interposed themselues; or through
  the barbarousnesse and crueltie of the people bordering there abouts.

 Incrudelity, a maine stop to Christs, Miracles.The fift reason is set
  downe by Saint Mathew, and Saint Marke; Hee wrought not many
  miracles there, by reason of their incredulitie: Not that he hated his
  owne Countrie, which he had so much honoured with his Conception, (saith the
  Interlinearie) but for Nazareths incredulitie. And this is made apparent by
  that Fac &amp; hic in Patria tua: In other places they talke much of
  thy many and great miracles, but this Citie will not beleeue there is any such
  thing: and yet thou hast heere the same power thou hadst there; Therefore,
  Fac &amp; hic in patria tu
                        •
                     ,
  Medice, cura teipsum. How can we beleeue, that thou doost such famous
  Cures in other Countries, when as thou sufferest thyne owne Countrimen and
  thyne owne Kinsefolke to be sicke? The like argument was vsed by the Scribes
  and Pharisees at the foot of the Crosse, This man saued others, and cannot
  saue himselfe; How should we beleeue, that by his power he freed so many,
  beeing hee cannot free himselfe? Let him come downe from the Crosse, and saue
  himselfe, &amp; then we will beleeue he is the Sonne of God.
               Our Sauiour Christ prooued this their incredulitie by two
  examples:
               The one, Of Elias, who when the Countrie was much
  oppressed with Famine, God sent him to a woman of Sydonia, to the end that she
  should sustaine  him. And this poore Widdow woman hauing
  in all her house nothing more in the world but a little meale, onely with one
  words speaking of the Prophets mouth, spent a great part thereof in making a
  Cake for him, baking it on the embers; repairing Elias his present
  necessitie with the hazard of her owne life and her sonnes: and hauing so much
  reason as she had on her side, to doubt of the Prophets promise, That she
  should neither want meale nor oyle till it should rain in Israell. For
  Elias not being able to succour himselfe, shee might verie well
  suspect with her selfe, How he should be able to relieue others. This was a
  great and wonderfull excellencie of Faith; it is much celebrated by S.
  Ambrose and Saint Chrysostome; and our Sauiour Christ
  counterponeth it to the incredulitie of Nazareth.
               The second example is of Naaman the Syrian, who
  beleeued that she-slaue of Israel, who told him, There was a Prophet in Samaria
  that could cure him of his Leaprosie: and crauing leaue of the King, because he
  was Captaine generall of all his men of Warre, he came to the Land of Israell
  to seeke out Elisha, bringing great gifts and rich presents along with
  him: and washing himselfe in Iordan seuen times, (though at first he beleeued,
  that with his word onely hee was able to cure him) he left with his disease,
  the errour of his Idolatrie. In a word, hee well deserued that the Prophet
  should heale him; but those Leapers of his owne Countrie did not deserue the
  like fauour, for their incredulitie. And other Cities receiuing the benefit of
  his miracles, these that were his owne Natiues missed of them. The word
  Audiuimus doth condemne them: For this alone was sufficient for their
  Faith, Fides ex auditu, Faith comes by hearing; and the Gentiles had
  no other testimonies.
               Besides, Nazareth was made partaker of many powerful
  testimonies; as that testimonie of S. Iohn, of that voyce from the
  Father; of the comming down of the Holy-Ghost in the likenesse of a Doue; as
  also those Testimonies of the Scripture, which were seene to be fulfilled in
  him; besides the testimonie of his Doctrine, For he taught them as one
  hauing authoritie, and not as the Scribes.
                  
                     Math. 7.29. And the testimonie of his life, that
  was so blamelesse, that (as Thomas saith) it did qualifie his
  Doctrine. So that his life was a greater testimonie than his Doctrine; and his
  Doctrine, than his Miracles: And hee that will not beleeue the more, will
  hardly beleeue the lesse.
               The sixt, In not shewing any miracles amongst them, hee shewed
  therein the more loue to his Countrie:God somtimes neuer
 more our friend, than when he denies vs our requests. For if these his
  miracles would haue done Nazareth any good, this their accusation might haue
  seemed somwhat iust; but being that they would haue turned to their hurt, and
  beeing that this their enuie towards him, would from a great good haue drawne
  greater hurt, and from a great fauour, greater ingratitude, and more
  incredulitie; the lesse he did, the more was his loue. This did our Sauiour
  vtter by Saint Iohn, If I had not done those workes which none after euer
  did, they should haue no sinne.
                  
                     Mat. 26.
  And by Saint Mathew our Sauiour said the like of Iudas, It had
  beene good for him that hee had neuer beene borne. And Saint
  Peter saith of him that was conuerted,
                     
                        •
                     . Pet. 2. That for to
  put his hand to the Plough, and afterwards to looke backe, it had beene better
  for him, that he had neuer begun to walke in the way of godlinesse. S.
  Augustine saith, That God grants vs many things when he is angrie with
  vs, which when he is friends with vs he denies vs. So that he shewed himselfe a
  greater friend to the Nazarites, by denying them those miracles which they
  desired, than if he had granted their request; because they would haue serued
  but for their farther condemnation. The Seruant that knowes his Masters will,
  and doth it not,
                     Luk. 12. shall bee beaten
  with  many stripes; Vap
                        •
                     labit multis, saith S. Luke: but he that
  knows it not, and therefore does it not, Vapulab
                        •
                     t paucis, This mans punishment shall bee small in
  comparison of the others. Saint Chrysostome saith, That a bad
  Christian is like a treacherous Souldier, who being honoured and well payed by
  his King, turnes Traitour, and ioynes with his enemie. And Guaricus
  the Abbot saith, That to carrie a mans selfe in the Church like a Christian,
  and to talke like a Christian, but to liue like a Gentile, is, to march vnder
  Christs banner, and to take part with Antechrist And for these kind of men God
  hath stored vp treasures of his wrath.
               The seuenth reason was, The Nazarits foolishnesse, in desiring
  miracles without any profit vnto them at all.
               Fiue sorts of persons required miracles, but got them not.
               
                  1 The Deuill, in that his temptation, Dic vt lapides
 isti panes fiant.
                  
                  2 The Pharisees, Alij tentantes signum de Coelo
 quaerebant.
                  
                  3 King Herod, Quis est iste de quo ego talia
 audio?
                  
                  4 The rich Miser, Pater Abraham, mitte vnum ex mortuis,
 &amp;c.
                  
                  5 The Nazarites, Fac &amp; hic in patria
 tua.
                  
               
               
                  Miracles neuer wrought, but where Good was
 likely to ensueWhatsoeuer Miracles he had bestowed on these, they had
  been all cast away. In antient times God wrought some miracles, where his
  Omnipotencie seemed most to appeare: As in making the Sunne stand still; and in
  diuiding the Sea in twaine. Others, wherein his Iustice seemed most to appeare;
  as in the Flood, the burning of Sodome, and the swallowing vp of
  Dathan and Abiram, &amp;c. But when he came into the World,
  in all his miracles his Mercie seemed most to appeare. For he wrought not any
  one miracle but was for mans benefit, respecting more others good than his owne
  fame. And in Capernaum, where he wrought so many miracles, Saint Basil
  and Saint Hillarie both affirme, that out of that Citie he chose many
  of his Apostles and Disciples. Beeing no more than what is declared in that
  verse of Dauid, Principes Zabulon, &amp; Principes Nepthtalim; to
  whose Tribes Capernaum did appertaine: as appeareth out of that place of Saint
  Mathew, Leauing Nazareth he went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is neere the
  Sea,
                  
                     M
                           •
                        th. 4. 
                  in the borders of Zabulon and Nephtalim,
  That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esayas the Prophet,
  saying, The land of Zabulon and the land of Nep
                        •
                     htalim, by the way of the Sea beyond Iordan, Galile of the
  Gentiles, &amp;c. Many more besides were conuerted in Capernaum: And he
  that promised Abraham to pardon Sodome, if hee could find but ten iust
  men therein; and he that left the ninetie nine sheep, to follow that one that
  was lost, and when he had found it, tooke it vp and kist it, and layd it on his
  necke; and he that swept his house cleane, to looke his lost groat; and he that
  suffred the tares to grow till reaping time was come, that hee might not hurt
  the wheat; it was not much, that he should doe miracles in Capernaum, where
  the Centurion and his Seruant were conuerted, as also hee that was sicke of the
  Palsey, besides the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue, and his whole house.
               Whence it is to be noted, That what the Deuill could not effect
  with our Sauiour Christ, (to wit, That he should do miracles to a needlesse
  and vnprofitable end) the Nazarites went about to bring to passe, shewing
  themselues therein his true children. So that our Sauiour might verie well say
  that vnto them, which he said to the Pharisees, It is the nature of the Deuills
  sonnes, to fulfill the desires of such a Father. God commanded
  Abraham, That he should sacrifice his sonne; and the Deuill being
  desirous to equall God, commanded the Gentiles to sacrifice their sonnes;
  They did sacrifice their sonnes and daughters to Deuils.
  
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   that wicked King of
  Israel, applying himselfe to the desires of the Deuill, the 
   Scripture giues this touch, That he did sacrifice his
  sonne to Moloch, Insuper &amp; filium suum consecrauit, transferens per
  ignem, secundum Idola gentium.
               
               The eighth reason is, That faintnesse and weakenesse, that
  lukewarmenesse, or rather coldnesse, wherewith the Nazarites did desire these
  miracles from Christ. And these their poore diligences, may sufficiently bee
  prooued by this, That they neuer went out of their own Citie, nor left their
  houses, for to heare our Sauior, or to see his miracles, as those of Iudea and
  Ierusalem did by troups, and others that flockt vnto him from the vtmost
  borders of Tyrus and Sydon. Neither did they send any embassage or message vnto
  him, entreating him to come vnto them; nor so much as bring any sicke bodie
  vnto him to bee cured. Whereas Capernaum did dispeople it selfe, to goe forth
  to heare his Word. The Centurion came forth likewise to seeke him, beseeching
  him humbly on his knee, That he would be pleased to make his Seruant whole.
  Others did vntile their house, to let downe him vnto him that was sicke of the
  Palsey, &amp;c. The comparison of one that followes a suit in Law of his owne,
  which imports him much; and of him that followes another mans cause, which
  concernes him little: the diligences of the one, and the carelesnesse of the
  other, are true emblems of the different conditions of Christians. Some follow
  the businesse of their saluation earnestly and industriously; other-some
  negligently,The seueral conditions of Christians, in seeking
 their Saluation. making a meere jeasting matter of it, and a thing of
  nothing. Herod desired to see our Sauiour Christ, but he would not
  step a foot out of doores to looke after him: Whereas the Queen of Sheba came
  from the vtmost parts of the earth, to seeke after the wisedome of Salomon,
  onely vpon a bare report. But the Nazarits would not wagge a jot, to goe
  see our Sauiour Christ, hauing so short a journey as they had to make: And
  behold, a greater than Salomon heere. Quid, de nocte? (saith the Prophet)
  What, by night? The morning commeth, and the night; if yee seeke,
  seeke. Hee borroweth this Metaphor from one that stands Sentinell, who
  heares the word that is giuen afarre off, Ha de la vella, Que hora es? Ho,
  you of the Watch, What houre is it? And he presently makes answer,
  Quien da vozes sin para que? Who is be that calls without a cause? I
  say, That the morning comes, and the night; or rather, That the night succeeds
  the day, and the day the night. Who knowes not this▪ If thou wilt farther
  informe thy selfe, come where I am. Those that dwelt in the mountaine of Seir,
  beeing persecuted by the Chaldaeans, sent to know of Esay, When that
  persecution should cease? This is that Custos, Quid de nocte? Sentinell,
  What seest thou by night? It vexed the Prophet, and made him grow wearie
  of them, that sitting lazing on their tayles at home in their houses, they
  should send to know his mind. Onus d
                        •
                     ma ad me clamat de Seir, To Hierusalem did the Idumaeans crie
  out vnto me: Si quaeritis, quaerite; Being in that great danger as
  thou art, doost thou stand off, doost thou hang taile, and wilt not make a
  little more hast to come vnto thy Sauiour? If there were nothing more, this
  were enough to condemne Nazareth.
               The ninth; It might happely bee, That Nazareth did desire
  miracles, for the honour and glorie that might thereby redound vnto her; as
  that it might be noysed abroad in the world, That a Citisen of theirs, a
  Towne-borne child of their owne, had done these and these famous miracles, such
  and such singular wonders; and that she was to bee esteemed as Ladie and
  Mistresse of this so rare and rich a Treasure; and that our Sauiour being borne
  there, he was bound (as they thought) to keepe house there, and to make
  Nazareth the onely seat of his ordinarie residence. The loue of honour amongst
  Citisens, is so sauorie and so sweet a thing, that Cicero in many
  places stickes not to say, That there is not any  thing
  that Nature doth more couet: &amp; that men are not so much to esteem the
                     ••
                   liues for the present, as that fame
  which is to liue in their posteritie. Celebremus nomen nostrum, said
  those of the Tower of Babell, That wee may get vs a nam
                        •
                     . And to this end are directed
  your Scutchions, your Armes, your Coats, your Tombes, your Sepulchres, and
  stately monuments. And if such a poore City as Peleas, remained so famous by
  the birth of Alexander; if Ithaca, by Vlysses beeing born
  there; it was not much, That Nazareth should boast her selfe, and think it a
  great glorie and honour vnto her, to haue the Sonne of God to bee he
                     •
                   Citisen.
               The Nazarites likewise might verie well desire miracles for
  temporall ends, as well for the Citie in generall, as themselues in particular.
  As those of I
                     ••
                  escas desire, That
  the Virgin de la Charidad should do famous miracles, to the end that
  some might grow rich by entertaining of guests; others, by selling of fruits;
  others, by their seruice and attendance, &amp;c. And so was it with these of
  Nazareth; but they tooke their mark amisse, in seeking to shut vp such great
  glorie in so narrow and little a corner of the world, as that was, confining
  him to a Fac &amp; hic in patria tua; When Peter would in
  Mount Tabor haue had Christs glorie coopt vp in so streight and small a
  compasse, comming vpon him with a Si vis, faciamus hic tria Tabernacula,
  and If thou wilt, let vs make three Tabernacles. Two Euangelists say,
                     Luke 9. Mark. 9. That he knew not what he
  said. And Origen addeth, That it was impulsu Diaboli, by the
  Deuils persuasion. The like may be said of Nazareths request, Fac
  &amp; hic in patria tua. Christs glorie was to shew it selfe abroad to all
  the whole world, and to shine to al Nations; and wilt thou Nazareth make a
  Monopolie of it, and take it all into thyne owne hands?
               The tenth and last, Because Miracles are neither necessarie, nor
  of themselues alone sufficient for our saluation.
               Not necessarie, because many haue beene, and dayly are conuerted
  without them; as S. Mathew, the good Theefe, and they of Niniuie.
               
                  Miracles not necessarie to Saluation, nor
 sufficient.Not sufficient, considering that so many and such strange
  miracles could not conuert a Pharaoh, a Iudas, or a Symon
  Magus, &amp;c. Many do repeat in the church that Lesson of the Iewes,
  Signa nostra non vidimus. God doth not now work miracles in his owne
  Countrie, nor in our Church, his owne Spouse and best beloued. Those former
  times were much more happie, and farre more inriched, not onely with his
  miracles, but also with those of his Seruants: Peter did heale with
  his shadow; Stephen saw the Heauens opened; Philip in Samaria
  did cure by hundreds. There is no Arithmeticke that can summe vp the full
  number of those wonders that they wrought. And now it seemeth that the
  fountaine of his grace is drawne drie: But the truth is, That forasmuch as the
  Church then was in her infancie, and as it were but new crept out of the shell,
  there was a necessitie of the working of them; but after that the Church was
  well growne vp▪ &amp; began to grow stronger &amp; stronger in the Faith,
  there was no such great need of them. Saint Bernard saith, That the
  widdow of Sarepta had now no such great need to be relieued with Oyle and
  Meale. O (sayth one) if I could but once see a miracle, if an Angell should but
  speake to me, if a dead man should arise and speake vnto me, &amp;c. What
  should I not then doe? But the truth of it is, That he that will not beleeue
  the Scriptures, will not beleeue an Angell that comes from Heauen, nor one that
  shall arise from the dead. Though God neuer yet was, no
                     •
                   euer will be wanting to those that put their trust in
  him, by affoording them sufficient meanes for their saluation.
            
            
               
               Nemo Propheta acceptus in patria sua.
               It is an antient complaint, That Prophets liue vnhonoured in
  their own Countrey. Now (sweet Iesus) because thy Countrey does not honour
  thee, wilt not thou accomplish their desire? In all that whole discourse of thy
  life, thou didst flye from honour; When they sought to make thee King, thou
  didst shunne and auoyd it; From that Inscription on the Crosse, thou didst wry
  the necke and turne thy head aside from that glorious Title of, Iesus of
  Nazareth, King of the Iewes; Thou didst euer declare Humilitie, to be thy
  Daughter and Heire; Discite a me, quia mitis sum, &amp; humilis corde,
  Learne of mee, for I am meeke and humble. Thou wast that Butte, gainst
  which the dishonours of the World did shoote their shaftes. Opprobrium
  hominum, &amp; abiectio plebis, the reproach of men and the outcast of the
  people. Hereunto I answere, That our Sauior Christ did direct all his
  miracles to this end, that thereby they might be brought to beleeue that he was
  the Son of God, and the promised Messias; as it appeareth out of the tenth of
  Saint Iohn, Vt cognoscatis &amp; credatis, quia pater in me est, &amp;c.
  That ye may know and beleeue, that the Father is in me, &amp;c. And in the
  eleuenth, Vt credant, quia tu me misisti, That they may beleeue, because
  thou hast sent me. And being thus receiued by vs,The

                      alwaies to
 condemned. to bee the Sonne of God, it turned to our saluation, and the
  Fathers glorie. And as that famous Phisition who desires to bee knowne, for
  the recouerie of those that are sicke, and for the conseruation of the
  Commonwealth; and as that wise and learned Doctor who desires that his graue
  and good Instructions might be harkned vnto, not for his owne glorie, but for
  the benefit of those that heare him; is not to be held an ambitious or
  vaineglorious fellow, but a verie honest man, and worthy much commendation:
  Euen so stood the Case with our Sauiour Christ. And Saint Gregorie
  doth prooue this Doctrine by Saint Pauls owne act;2. Cor. 11. Who writing to the Corinthians,
  speakes much in his owne commendation, not so much out of an hope-glorious
  humour, to broach his owne praise, but to bring others therereby to beleeue the
  Truth. For it is an ordinarie thing with the World, not to esteeme of the
  Doctrine where the person is disesteemed.
               
                  But I tell yee of a very truth, many widdowes were in
  Israell in the dayes of Elias, &amp;c.
                  God, in the
 dis
                        •
                     ensing of his fauors, respects
 no persons. He alledgeth these two examples, of the Widdow, and of
  Naaman, for to take away all suspition of partialitie. If thou shalt
  obiect that God was partiall towards women; wee answere, That hee did likewise
  fauour Naaman. If towards great and noble persons, he did also
  sustaine the poore widow of Sarepta; If towards the common and baser sort of
  people, Hee likewise cured Naaman that was a great Courtier; If the
  richer, he prouided also for the poore; If towards the poore, hee likewise
  cured Naaman that was rich▪ If towards young folkes, such as was
  Naaman, he had also a care of the widow, who was an old woman; If
  towards old folkes, Naaman was young, &amp;c. In veritate Comperi,
  quia non est acceptor personarum Deus, &amp;c. Of a truth I haue found, that
  God is no accepter of persons, &amp;c.
               
               
                  Then al that were in the Synagogue were filled with
  wrath. Whether it were our Sauiours zeale, in declaring himselfe to be
  the Messias out of the authoritie of the Prophet? Or whether it were for his
  comparing them to those of Tyre and Sydon? Or for that hee had equalled
  himselfe with Elias and Elisha, which were the two bright
  Suns of that commonwealth? Or that by the examples of Naman the
  Syrian, and the widow of Sarepta, hee did signifie vnto them, that the grace of
  the Iews was to be passed ouer to the Gentiles? Or, for that he had taxed them 
   of their incredulitie and vnthankefulnesse? Or whether
  their hearts through Enuie did swell and rise against him? Whether any one, or
  all of these together wrought vpon them? Sure I am, Repleti sunt ira,
  The men of Nazareth are grown wondrous angrie.
               This place pointeth out two things vnto vs.
               The one, The good requitall Truth findes vpon Earth. When they
  should haue held themselues happie in inioying so soueraigne a good, and when
  they should haue beene prowd of hauing so heauenly a Cittisen, and haue humbled
  themselues on their knees before him, &amp; adored him; then, euen then, they
  grew hot and angrie with him: and transported with this rage, they would haue
  broken his necke by throwing him downe from a steepe rocke; fulfilling th
                     ••
                   saying of Salomon,
                  
                     Prou.
 15.12. 
                  A scorner loueth not him that rebuketh him, neither will
  he goe vnto the wise.
                     Amos 5.10. Agreeing
  with that of Amos, They haue hated him that rebuked in the gate, and they
  abhorred him that speaketh vprightly.
               
               Another cause of this their cruell determination, for to throw
  him downe from the rock, was as wel their Enuie as their Anger. Enuie she sayd,
  Do not you see how this Carpenter boasts himselfe? Nonne hic est faber,
  &amp; filius fabri? &amp; sorores eius, apud nos sunt? Anger shee said,
  Cast him downe headlong from the Pulpit, or plucke him out of Moses
  Chaire, for a blaspheamer, by head and eares;Enuie a
 dangerous beast. for that he goes about to make himselfe our Messias,
  and our King. A brace of fierce beasts, I assure you; Enuie first opened the
  doore to all those euils that are in the world: By the Deuils enuie death
  entred into the world; and by death, a troupe of miseries. For although
  the Deuill were the Author thereof, yet did Enuy put spurs to his heeles. The
  Trojan Horse was not that which did so much harme to Troy, as that Graecian who
  inuented this stratagem. Onely this one good, Enuie bringeth with it, That it
  prooues it's owners Hangman. And for this reason Saint Augustine
  compares the Enuious to the Vipers, who gnaw out the bowells of those that bred
  them. And Saint Chrysostome, That it is a lesser euill to haue a
  Serpent in our bosome, than Enuie; for that was a curable hurt, but that of
  Enuie is not so. Ouid in his Metamorphosis paints forth
  Enuies house, and the qualities belonging to her person. Her house is seated in
  a very low bottome, whereunto the beames of the Sunne neuer come, no light, no
  ayre, no wind: for the enuious man hath not any thing on earth, wherein to take
  comfort; being therin like vnto those that are condemned to the pit of hel.
  The qualities appertaining to her person, is sadnes of countenance, heauines
  of the eyes, bitternesse of heart, venimousnesse of tongue, &amp; veines
  without bloud; she loues solitude, shunnes the light, knowes no law, nor does
  no right, shee weepes when others laugh: In a word, she is Pestis mundi,
  porta mortis, the plague of the world, the doore of Death, the murtherer
  of Vertue, the pit of Ignorance, and the hell of the Soule.
               
                  Anger, a sin no lesse hurtfull than
 Enuie.And Anger is no lesse fierce a beast, than Enuie: Of whom
  Ecclesiasticus saith, That as Mildenesse resideth in the bosome of the
  Wise, so Anger abideth in the brest of the Foole. Who but a Foole (saith
  Plutarch) can suffer a cole to lie in his bosome? Let not the
  Sunne goe downe vpon your wrath, neither giue place vnto the Deuill. He
  that goes to bed in anger, inuites the Deuill to be his bedfellow, There is not
  any vice that giues him so free an entrance, nor puts him into a more generall
  possession of our soules: for there is not that mischiefe which is not hammered
  and wrought in the forge of an angrie mans brest.
                     Prou. 17.3. 
                  A stone is heauie, and the sand
  weightie, but a fooles wrath is heauier than them both. Seneca saith, That
  as humane industrie doth tame the fiercest beasts, as the Lyon, the Tygre, 
   and the Elephant, so ought it to tame Anger.
               Now to say, Which of these two furies is the fiercest? is not so
  easie a thing to be decided: For, if Enuie be kindled vpon light occasions, as
  that little short Song which the Dames of Hierusalem sung in Dauids
  commendation; if it be so large sighted, that our neighbours fields of Corne,
  and his flockes of Sheepe seeme better and bigger than our owne;
  Iosephs partie coloured Coate seeming better to his bretheren, than
  those Sheepeheards mantles wherewith themselues were clad: if it be the vice of
  little children, Parvulum occidi inuidia; What shall wee say then to
  the impetuousnesse of Anger, and the violence of Wrath? Or who is able to
  withstand it's rage? Anger is cruell, and wrath is raging,
                     Prou. 27.4. saith Salomon; but he
  concludes with this short come-off, Who can stand before Enuie? Who will oppose
  himselfe to the violent and swift torrent of a Riuer that sweepes all before
  it? Such a thing is Anger, for the time it lasteth: but that will slacke againe
  of it selfe, as your Spring-tydes fall backe againe into their owne beds. But
  Enuie will not so soone shift her foot, she wil abide by it, and neuer giue
  ouer. And Saint Cyprian renders the reason of it, Quia non habet
  terminum; it is not to be limitted, but like a Worme or a Canker, by
  little and little rotteth and consumeth the bones; Salomon calls it,
  Putredo ossium. But Anger is a thunderbolt that strikes a man dead on
  the sudden; so sayth Seneca. And if Saint Augustine terme
  Enuie, a plague; and if another great Phylosopher call it Monstrum
  monstrorum, the Monster of monsters, and the most venimous Vipar vpon
  earth: Saint Chrysostome here on the other side saith, That the Deuill
  being in mans bosome, is lesse hurtfull than Anger. Much hath beene spoken of
  Enuie, and much of Anger; and that ill cannot be said of the one, which may not
  be affirmed of the other. So that this proposed doubt (Which is the worst Beast
  of the two?) may remaine for a probleme; which let others resolue, for I
  cannot. But (which makes fit for our purpose) beeing both such fierce Beasts as
  we haue deliuered vnto you, they did both conspire against our Sauiour Christ,
  leading him here to the edge of a hill whereon their Citie was built, to cast
  him downe headlong: and afterwards neuer leaft persecuting him til they had
  nailed him to the Crosse.
               
                  And they cast him out of the Synagogue. &amp;c.
  Aristotle saith, That Man gouerning himselfe according to the Lawes and
  rules of Reason, is of all other Creatures the most perfect, or to speake more
  properly, the King of all other liuing Creatures: but if he shut his eyes, and
  wil not see reason, he is more fierce and cruell than all of them put together.
  The reason is, because other creatures neuer passe beyond the bounds of their
  fiercenesse and crueltie, receiue they neuer so much wrong; Incursus suos,
  transire non queunt: Which (as Seneca saith) is for want of
  discourse. But man, who hath Vnderstanding for his weapon, is able to inuent
  such strange cruelties that may exceed the fiercenesse of the fiercest beasts.
  Nor is this any great indeering of the busines; for both Bede &amp;
  Ambrose say vpon this place, That the Nazarites were worse than the
  Deuil: the deuill lead our Sauiour Christ vp to the top of the pinacle of the
  Temple; those of Nazareth, to the edge of the hill on the side or skirt whereof
  their city was built. The Deuill did onely persuade him to cast himselfe downe
  from thence; but the Nazarites would haue done this by force. These (saith
  Ambrose) were the Deuills Disciples, but farre worse than their
  Master. Saint Paul saith, That there are some men that inuent new
  mischiefes, Inuentores malorum. And the deuill being the vniuersall
  Inuenter of all our ill, the Sinner that inuents new mischiefes doth outreach
  the Deuill, and goes beyond him. And questionlesse, in 
  not passing the bounds of Gods diuine will and Empire, the Deuill is more
  moderate than Man: For the Deuill askt leaue of God for to tempt Iob;
  but Man will not be so respectfull as to aske his leaue, but will not sticke to
  kill thousands of men without licence.
               
                  The Nazarits base demeanor toward
                        •
                      Christ
                  Bonauenture
  saith, That they thrust him out of the Citie for a blasphemer, for proclaiming
  himselfe to bee the Messias. It is commanded in Leuiticus, That the
  Blasphemer should be carried forth of the Citie, and bee stoned to death. And
  therefore our Sauiour Christ, extra portam passus est, suffred without the
  gate;
                  
                     Ieuit. 4. Act. 7▪
                  
  and Saint Stephen was stoned without the Citie. And our Sauiour had
  no sooner said in the presence of Caiphas, Amodo, &amp;c. Henceforth shall
  yee see the Sonne of Man comming in the clouds of Heauen, but the Iewes
  presently cried out, Blasphemauit, He hath blasphemed. So likewise our
  Sauior expounding that prophecie of Esay, the Nazarites might also
  take occasion to say, Blasphemauit. And this their offering to throw
  him downe from the edge of the hill, doth no way contradict their stoning of
  him; for they might haue done that after they had thrust him downe: dealing by
  him, as Saint Hierome reports Saint Iames (whom they call our
  Sauiours brother) was dealt withall; they first threw him downe from the Rocke,
  and afterwards cut off his head.
               
                  To cast him headlong downe, &amp;c. Methinkes it
  seemeth somewhat strange vnto me, That our Sauiour should come down from Heauen
  to Nazareth, for to giue life vnto men, and that Nazareth should seeke to
  tumble him downe, thereby to worke his death: That with the losse of his owne
  life, and the price of his most pretious bloud, hee should redeeme them from
  death; and that they in this vnthankefull and vnciuile manner should goe about
  to take away his life. O, vngratefull People! God was not willing to bestow
  any miracles on them, who would not entertaine so great a miracle. God vseth to
  requite the thankes of one fauour, with conferring another greater than the
  former. So doth Saint Bernard expound that place of the
  Canticles, He made his left hand my pillow, and I doubt not but he will hug
  and embrace me with his right hand. For I shal shew my selfe so thankefull
  for the one, that my Spouse will vouchsafe to affoord me the other. But those
  courtesies which Nazareth had receiued, they so ill requited, that euen to the
  houre of his death none did our Sauior Christ greater iniurie.Our Sauiour neuer any where so ill treated, as in Nazareth.
  Nay, in some sort this their wrong was greater than that which Hierusalem did
  him; for this Citie treating of the death of our Sauiour, did obserue some
  forme of Iudgement, and onely the Ministers of Iustice had their hands in it:
  but Nazareth in a most furious manner, like the common people when they are in
  a mutinie, hasted vp to the edge of the hill, to throw him downe headlong,
  contrarie to all Law and Iustice. In Hierusalem there were some that did not
  consent vnto his death; but in Nazareth, all of them conspired against him:
  Omnes in Synagoga repleti suntira, All that were in the Synagogue were
  filled with anger; and that on the Sabboth day, when it was not lawfull
  for them to gather stickes and make a fire, &amp;c.
               
                  How Christ is sayd to ha
                        •
                     e passed thorough them.
                  But he passed through
  the middest of them, and went his way. The common receiued opinion is,
  That he made himselfe inuisible to them, and so got from them, leauing their
  will and determination deluded. Saint Ambrose and Be
                        ••
                     
                   say, That he turned their
  hearts▪ 
                  Cor Regis in manu Domini, &amp; quo voluerit, &amp;c. The
  heart of the King is in the hand of the Lord, and hee turneth it, &amp;c.
  Like vnto those Officers of the Scribes and Pharisees who went forth to
  apprehend him, who altering their purpose, returned saying, Nūquid sic
  loquutus, &amp;c. Did euer any man speake thus? He might likewise take
  from them their force &amp; their strength,  that they
  might not bee able to put forth a hand to hurt him; and leauing them like so
  many blockes, might passe through the middest of them, as beeing the Lord both
  of their soules and bodies. And as he once left the Iewes with their stones
  frozen in their hands, so now leauing the Nazarits astonished, Per medium
  illorum ibat.
               
               This Ibat doth inforce a perseuerance and continuation,
  in token that God wil leaue his best beloued countrie, &amp; that citie which
  was most graced and fauored by him, if it be so gracelesse as to prooue
  vngratefull. When God carried Ezechiel in spirit to the Temple,
  discouering great abhominations vnto him, and said vnto him, These things my
  People commit, Vt procul recedam à Sanctuario meo, They giue
  mee occasion thereby to forsake them, and to get mee farre enough from them. So
  hath he departed from Israell, from Asia, Affrica, &amp; many other parts of
  Europ, forsaking so many cities &amp; temples so much heretofore fauored by
  him, and so much made of. Nazareth signifies a Floure, a Crowne, or a Garland;
  and the Nazarites were once the onely Floures in Gods Garden, that is, in his
  Church; they were religious persons that were consecrated to his seruice, and
  therefore Nazareth is by them more particularly called Christs own Countrie,
  for that therein he had beene often spiritually conceiued. But because of the
  Nazarits, Ierem. doth lament, Thatthey being more white than milke,
  were become as blacke as a cole▪ by reason of their vnthankfulnesse.
  Therfore in Colledges and religious places, with whom God communicates his
  fauours in a more large and ample manner, they ought of all other to shew
  themselues most gratefull: for the more a man receiues, and the more he
  professeth, the more he ought to doe. Cum enim crescunt dona, rationes
  etiam crescunt donorum Dei, so saith Saint Gregorie.
               
               
                  But he passed through the middest of them, and went his
  way.
                  We ought to p
                        •
                     ay against sudden death. Sap. 4. Howbeit death to
  the Iust is not sudden, nor can be said to take him hence vnawares [Though
  the Righteous be preuented with death, yet shall hee be in rest,] The
  Church notwithstanding doth not vse this prayer in vaine, A subitanea &amp;
  improuisa morte, libera nos Domine, From sudden death good Lord deliuer
  vs. Saint Augustine in his last sickenesse prayed ouer the
  penitentiall Psalmes, and shedding many teares, sayd, That though a man were
  neuer so iust and righteous, yet was hee not to die without penitence. Saint
  Chrysostome tells vs, That when Feare at the houre of death doth set
  vpon the Soule, burning as it were with fire, all the goods of this life, she
  enforceth her with a deep and profound consideration, to meditate on those of
  that other life which is to come. And although a mans sinnes bee neuer so
  light, yet then they seeme so great and so heauie, that they oppresse the
  heart. And as a piece of timber whilest it is in the water, any the weakest
  arme is able to mooue it, but beeing brought to the shore hath need of greater
  strength; so sin whilest it floateth on the waters of this life, seemeth light
  vnto vs, but being brought to the brinke of death, it is verie weightie, and it
  will require a great deale of leisure, consideration, and grace, to land it
  well and handsomely, and to rid our hands of it. Of this good, sudden death
  depriueth vs: And although it is apparent in Scripture, That God doth sometimes
  permit the Iust to die a sudden death, as Origen, Saint
  Gregorie, and Athanasius Bishop of Nice affirmeth; as in
  Iobs children, on whom the house fell when they were making
  merrie▪ and in those who died with the fall of the Tower of Siloah; who
  according to our Sauiours testimonie, were no such notorious sinners, yet
  commonly this is sent by God as a punishment for their sinnes. Mors
  peccarorum, pessima, (i.) esse debet, An euill death was made for
  an euil man. And Theodoret expounding what Dauid 
                   meant by this word Pessima, saith, That in the
  proprietie of the Greeke tongue, it is a kind of death, like vnto that of
  Zenacheribs Souldiers, who died suddenly. And Iob treating of
  him that tyranniseth ouer the world, saith, Auferetur Spirit
                        ••
                      oris sui. Cajetan renders it,
  Recedet in Spiritu oris sui, He shal die before he be sicke, without
  any paine, in the middest of his mirth, when he is sound and lustie. Their life
  being a continuall pleasure, at their death they scarce feele any paine,
  because it is in puncto, in an instant. Sophonias requireth of them,
  That they will thinke on that day before it come,
                     Esay 30. wherein God will scatter them like the
  dust. Esay threatning his People because they had put their trust in
  the succors of Aegypt, saith, This iniquitie shall be vnto you as a breach that
  salleth, or a swelling in an high wall, whose breaking commeth suddenly in a
  moment; and the breaking thereof shall be like the breaking of a Potters pot,
  and in the breaking thereof there shall not bee found a sheard to take fire out
  of the hearth, or to take water out of the pit. And the word Requisita
  mentioned by the Prophet, intimateth a strong wall that is vndermined, &amp;
  rusheth downe on the sudden. How much their securitie is the more, so much the
  more is their danger, because it takes the soldiers vnawares. But if this so
  strong a wal should chance to fall vpon a Pitche
                     •
                   of earth, it is a cleere case, that it would dash it
  into so many fitters &amp; seuerall little pieces, that there would not a
  sheard therof be left for to take vp so much as an handfull of water, or to
  fetch a little fire from our next Neighbours house. This effect doth sudden
  death worke, it is a desperat destruction to a sinner: And therefore Christ
  (though without sin) seeks to shun it, that he might teach thee that art a
  Sinner, to auoyd it.
               Secondly, our Sauior sought to shun this violent death, because
  his death was reserued for the Crosse, as well because it was a kind of long
  and lingering death, as also for diuers other conueniencies, which wee haue
  deliuered elsewhere.
               
                  God oft defers his punishments, that our
 sins may grow to maturity.
                  Passing through the midst of them, he
  went his way. Our Sauiour Christ might haue strooke them with blindnesse,
  if he would, as the Angell did those of Sodome; or haue throwne them downe
  headlong from the Cliffe: but because they complained, That he wrought no
  miracles among them, as he had in other places, he was willing now at his
  departure from them, to shew them one of his greatest miracles, by taking their
  strength from them, hindring the force of their armes, and leauing them much
  astonished and dismayed. Though now and then God doth deferre his punishments,
  for that the sinnes of the Wicked are not yet come to their full growth; yet we
  see that he spared not his Angels, nor those whom he afterwards drowned in the
  Floud, nor those of Sodome, nor of others lesse sinnefull than they, nor his
  owne children of Israell, of all that huge number (being more in number than
  the sands of the sea) not suffering aboue two to enter into the land of
  Promise; how is it possible that hee should endure the petulancie of this
  peremptorie people, these grumbling Nazarites, who in such a rude and vnciuill
  fashion, in such an imperious and commanding voice, should presume to say vnto
  him, taking the matter in such deepe dudgeon, Fac &amp; hic in Patria
  tua. But as when the Romane Cohorts came to take our Sauiour Christ, they
  fell backward on the ground at his Ego sum, I am hee; which was a
  fearefull Miracle; for no cannon vpon earth, nor any thunderbolt from Heauen,
  could haue wrought so powerfull an effect: so now passing through the midst of
  them with a graue and setled pace, leauing them troubled, angrie, &amp; amased,
  hee prooued thereby vnto them, That he was the Lord and giuer both of life and
  death, &amp;c.

pardon, he instructeth Peter, &amp; in him all the Faithfull, What the
offended and wronged person ought to doe. If thy brother trespasse against
thee, goe and tell him his fault betweene thee and him, &amp;c. and if he
heare thee, thou hast woon a brother: but if he will not vouchsafe to heare
thee, proceed to a second admonition before two or three witnesses: and if he
will not heare them, tell it vnto the Church: and if he shall shew himselfe so
obstinate that he will not obey the Church, let him be vnto thee as a heathen
man and a Publican. So that our Sauiour Christs desire is, That the partie
wronged should pardon the partie wronging, and reprooue him for it: for if it
bee ill not to pardon, it is as ill not to reprooue.
            For to intreat of a matter so darke and intricate,In treating of diuine matters, we ought alwaies to craue the
  assistan
                     •
                  e of God. that the
Vnderstanidng were to take it's birth from the ordinarie execution of the Law,
there were not any thing lesse to be vnderstood: for there is not any Law lesse
practised, nor any Decree in Court lesse obserued. I desire that God would doe
mee that fauour that he did Salomon. God giue me a tongue to speake
according to my mind, the pen of a readie Writer, cleerenesse of the case which
I am to deliuer, true distinction, grace, knowledge, or (as
Bonauenture stiles it) resolutionem in declarando;

  7.15. and to iudge worthily of the things that are giuen me. For, so
many are the difficulties, the questions, and the arguments, as well against
the substance of this Law, as against the manner of complying with it, that
there will be necessarily required great fauour and assistance from Heauen, for
to make any setled and ful resolution amongst so many sundrie and diuers
distractions. But in conclusion,  it is the best and the
safest councell, to adhere to that which is the surest, and not to make any
reckoning of that course which is now a dayes held in the World: not of that
which is in vse, but that which ought to bee vsed; not so much the practise of
the Law, as of Religion. For if the abuses of the world, and traditions of men,
were to tonti

               ue in force by
pleading of custome, &amp; by that means made iustifiable, they would giue the
checkmate, &amp; stand in competitiō with the laws of God.
                  Colloss. 4.6. S. Paul saith, writing to
the Colossians, Let your speech be gratious alwayes, and poudred with salt,
that yee may know how to answer euerie man. And S. Ambrose
expounding this place, saith, That the Apostle begs grace of God, that he might
know how to speake with discretion, when time, place, and occasion shall oblige
him thereunto: As also, when (vpon the same termes) to hold his peace. And this
is that which I now desire of God.
            
               If thy brother shall trespasse against thee. Here sinne
is put downe in the condition of this obligation.Sin a
  monster, and why. For it is a kind of monstrousnesse which wee neuer, or
seldome ought to see. Wee stiling that a monster which comes foorth into the
world against the Lawes of Nature. And in this sence, sinne may be sayd to bee
a monster, because it is against the Lawes of God. Ecclesiasticus
sayth, That God did not wil any man to sinne, nor did allow him any time
wherein to sinne, but alotted him a life, and place wherein to serue him, and a
time to returne vnto him and to repent as oft as hee should offend his diuine
Maiestie; but to sinne, he neuer gaue him the least leaue in the world,
Dedit ei locum poenitentia, He gaue him a place for repentance, sayth
the Apostle Saint Paul; so likewise sayth Iob. And therefore
God hauing made the Heauen &amp; the Earth, and al that therein is, he did not
then presently make Hell; For, if Man had not sinned there had bin no neede of
it. For where no faults are committed, a prison is needlesse. The Prophet
Esay was verie earnest with God,
                  Esay
  64. that hee would come downe vpon Earth, Oh, that thou wouldst
breake the Heauens and come downe, and that the M
                     •••
                  
                  taines might melt at thy presence, &amp;c. Hee
alludeth to that Historie of Mount Sinay, where God descended to giue the Law
vnto his people with thundering, lightening, and fire; wherewith he strucke
such a feare and terrour into them, that the people had great reuerence to the
Law; And therefore this holy Prophet sayth, What would they doe if thou
shouldest once againe come amongst them? A facie tua, montes fluerent;
The proudest of them all would let fall their plumes, and humble themselues at
thy feete, which are here represented in the word Montes, or
mountaines. And those soules which are now frozen and as cold as yce (figured
in the word Aquae, or waters) would gather heat and be set on fire.
With this desire did the sonne of God descend from the bosome of his father;
but he bringing that humilitie with him, that was able to make the highest
mountaines to stoope, and to bring downe the proudest heart; and fire, for to
burne and dry vp many waters; yet mens brests waxed colder and colder, and
their soules were more and more swolne with pride.
            The Glorious Apostle Saint Paul writing to the Romans,
That God made his Sonne our propitiation; Whome God hath set foorth to bee
a reconciliation through faith in his bloud, to declare his righteousnesse by
the forgiuenes of the sinnes that are passed, &amp;c. He did exercise
vpon his sonne the seuerest Iustice that euer was, or shall be seene againe;
for the remission of precedent sinnes. To the end, that Man considering how
deere our former wickednesse and forepassed sinnes cost our Sauiour; Man should
be so affraid of offending, that hee should neuer returne to sinne any
more.
            Some may happily aske me the question, Why the death and passion
of our  Sauiour beeing so powerfull and effectuall a
remedie against all kind of vices whatsoeuer, yet sinne still reigneth so much
in the World, as neuer more. Wherunto I answere, That vpon the Crosse, our
Sauiour Christ gaue sentence against all whatsoeuer, both present, past, and
those that were to come. And depriued the Prince of the World of that
Seigniorie which he possessed, so that all of them were to suffer death and to
haue an end. But they did appeale from this sentence of death, to the Tribunall
of our passions; And for that they are such interressed &amp; such blind
Iudges, they haue set these our Vices againe at libertie, giuing them licence
to worke vs as much, if not more harme than they did before. So that Gods
sending of his sonne into the World, and his suffering death for our sinnes,
did not generally banish all vice, but did serue rather to some for their
greater condemnation.
            
               If thy brother shall trespasse (In te) against thee.
Saint Augustine expoundeth this In te, to be contra
te; and in this sence it ought to be taken: for it is the expresse letter
of the former Texts, as also of those that follow, and generally agreed vpon
by all the Doctors: The Interlinearie hath it, Si te contumelia
affecerit. Saint Peter anon after askes our Sauiour, How oft
shall my brother sinne against mee, and I shall forgiue him? Whereupon
Theophilact taking hold of this word Contra me, notes, That
if his brother should sinne against God, hee could hardly forgiue him. Saint
Luke deliuers the same much more plainly and cleerely, If thy
brother haue trespassed against thee, rebuke him; if hee repent, forgiue him:
If hee offend thee seuen times a day, and seuen times a day shall turne vnto
thee, forgiue him. Hugo Cardinalis hath obserued, That if the word In
te be the ablatiue case, then it is the same with Coram te: but
if it be the accusatiue, then it is all one with Contra te; and the
Greeke doth admit of no Ablatiues. In Leuiticus God had said long
before, Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but reprooue
him. And vpon a second admonition, Take vnto thee two witnesses, and
tell it to the Church. Manle doe concur and runne along with this sence,
no difficultie in the world interposing it selfe.
            The second sence, which Saint Augustine also treateth of
in the same place, is, If he shall trespasse against thee, that is,
before thee. This opinion Thomas followeth, and the greater
and better part of the Schoolemen; howbeit there are great arguments and strong
reasons to the contrarie; and many graue Authours, to whom this sence doth not
seeme so plaine, as to ground thereupon any diuine precept. But leauing this to
the Schooles, the precept of brotherly correction concurreth with any
whatsoeuer heinous 
                  •

            Against thy neighbour; or,
            Against God.
            For to prooue this truth, diuers Authors follow these two
paths:
            The one, That although our Sauior Christ in this his first
instance, speake of that sinne or trespasse which is committed against my
selfe; yet by a necessarie kind of consequence he inferreth likewise any sinne
that is committed against my Neighbour, and against God.
            Against my neighbour, because I ought to loue him as my selfe, and
to bee as sensible of his hurt as of myne owne.
            Against God, Because I am bound to pr

               ferre his glorie before myne owne good: And if I being
wronged, God will 
                  〈◊〉
                I not onely
pardon him, but that I also complie with the precept of brotherly correction;
how much more will he tie me, that I should deale

                  •
               his kind with my brother, hee
hauing  not sinned against me.
            The second part is, That this sinning or trespassing, whither it
be against my Neighbour, or against God, Thomas saith, That I knowing
it, it is done against me; because by scandalizing and proooking of me, it doth
hurt and offend me. And Hadrianus the Lawyer saith, That he that
sinnes against God, sinnes against any whatsoeuer faithfull beleeuer, and
leaues him iniured and offended. For he that wrongs the Father in the Sonnes
presence, wrongeth also the Sonne; and he that wrongeth the Master in the
presence of the Seruant, wrongeth likewise the Seruant: besides, Loue, which
makes things common, makes others iniuries ours. And if God take those
iniuries which are done to thee, to be done to himselfe, (as he said to Saint
Paul, Why doost thou persecute me? And by Zachari
                     •
                  , He that toucheth you, toucheth the
apple of myne eye) it is not much, that thou shouldest reckon those
wrongs that are done to God, to be done vnto thy selfe. The zeale of thy house,
&amp; of thy honor &amp; authoritie, seeing how the enemies of thy word slight
&amp; cōtemne it, consumes my flesh, &amp; drieth my bones. The like loue must
make vs sencible of the sins of our neighbor, for that they are members of this
mysticall bodie of the Church. Who is sicke (saith Saint
Paul) and I am 
                     〈◊〉
                  
grieued? Either forgiue them this offence, or blot me out of the Booke of
Life, said Moses, hauing a fellow feeling of his brethrens
faults as had they beene his owne: and therefore begs of God, that he would
either forgiue them, or blot him our of the booke of Life.

to shut vp the windowes of Heauen, that they may not send downe any raine to
water the drie and thirstie places of the Land: and so Sin being a generall
hurt to all, it is generally done against all.
            
               If thybrother shall trespasse against thee, &amp;c. The
verie name of a brother is a reason for this Precept: for it was condemned in
the Leuite and the Priest, That they passed by, saying their prayers to
themselues, but tooke no pittie of that poore man that lay almost for dead vpon
the way, wounded by Theeues. Contrarie to that lesson of Ecclesiasticus, He
gaue euerie man a commandement concerning his Neighbour;
                  Eccle. 17. and a Turke or a Moore may as well bee
our neighbour as another: And if that housekeeper bee condemned that hath not a
care of the Cat or Dog that liues within his doores, (for al this did S.
Paul vnderstand when he said, He that prouides not for those of
his familie is worse than an Infidell,) How much more then will God that

                     〈◊〉
                  , &amp;c. Edom was the
Metropolis of Idumea, and her sinnes beeing come to the number of seuen, (which
in Scripture expresseth a kind of infidelitie God faith, 
               I will not turne to it. But suppose they were fewer, yet some of them
it should seem were verie foule ones; &amp; amongst the rest, this of their
vnsheathing of their sword against their brother. The Idumaeans were descended
of Esau, as the Iewes were of Iacob. And in the conquest of
the Land of Promise God commanded his People, That they should not doe that
hurt to the Idumaean, as they had done to the rest of the Nations; Quia
Frater tuus est, Hee is thy brother, and thou ougtest to procure his good
as thou wouldst thyne owne. This benefit, by the Idumaeans was repayed to Gods
People with a thousand iniuries, when the Philistines and those of Tyre
ouercame the Israelites; as you may read in the second of the
Chronicles and the second: For the Idumaeans did buy many Iews with
intent to make them their slaues. Likewise when Gods People had necessarie
occasion (asking leaue of the Edomites) to passe through their Countrie in
peace, they withstood them with their swords in their hands. In a word, the
enmitie which Esay bare to Iacob for his messe of pottage,
&amp; the blessing that he had stolne from him, neither hee nor his posteritie
could euer yet digest it; though hee and his House had receiued many, and those
verie good courtesies at the others hands. And therefore it is not much, that
God should condemne an enmitie so antient, and so inueterated a hatred,
especially of one brother against anothe

                  Leuit.
  19.17. And in Leuiticus it is set downe as a Precept belonging
to the Law of Nature, Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but
thou shalt plainly rebuke thy Neighbour, and suffer him not to sinne.
               
                  Eccle. 17. 
               God hath giuen euerie man a charge
concerning h
                     •
                  s Neighbour,
(
                  •
               s we said before.) Saint
Paul drawes his comparison from the members of the bodie, which by the
Law of Nature are bound reciprocally to succour one another in case of
necessitie. And Augustine takes his from the thorne, which paining the
foot, carries after it the eyes, eares, and hands, all the members of the bodie
naturally inclining to the repairing of that hurt.
            Another naturall reason which your holy Fathers, learned Doctors,
and great Phylosophers render, is, That hee that can (if he will) hinder or put
by a hurt that is readie to fall vpon his brother, and doth it not, is
condemned to bee himselfe the hurter and harmer of him. Thy poore neighbor is
readie to starue and perish through hunger, thou beeing able to relieue, doost
not doe it; hee dies, thou art his Deaths-man, thou art the murtherer of this
thy brother. Si non panisti, 
                     •
                  ccidisti, saith Saint Ambrose; Thy brother is sinking
&amp; readie to be drowned; thou mayst saue him by reaching out thy hand vnto
him▪ thou deniest him thy helpe, it is thou that drownest him. Thy
Neighbors house is on fire, it is in thy power to quench it; thou wilt not doe
it, it is thou that hast burnt his house.
            Tell but a Blasphemer, a Drunkard, or any other lewd liuer, of his
faults, though neuer so fairely, neuer so mild and gently, he will begin to
swagger with you, and aske you, Who made you sir a Iustice of Peace? meddle
with that which you haue to doe withall, you take more paines than you haue
thankes for your labour. But hereunto thou or any man else that is thus
charitably minded, may make them  this answer, I haue
complyed with myne obligation; I am a Christian, and am bound i
                     •
                   charitie and brotherhood, to tell you
friendly my mind, and I can bee but sorie, that my councell cannot preuaile
with you: this I am tyed vnto by the Law of God and of Nature. And this
position wants no proofes.
            The necessarie circumstances of this precept are many:
            The first is, That the sinne which is to be corrected and
reprooued by vs, bee certaine, and well knowne vnto vs: and this is prooued out
of this word, Si p
                     ••
                  
                  cauerit, If
he shall trespasse, &amp;c. as it is well obserued by Thomas. Wee
must not find fault vpon a bare suspition or presumption, but must haue a good
ground for our reproofe,He that would reproue an other, must
  first correct himselfe. and go vpon an assured knowledge. To goe about
to pull out a sound tooth, and with a sharpe in
                  •
               trument to open the gummes, it cannot chuse but be a great torment
vnto him that without iust cause is thus cut and lanced. No lesse grieuous and
paineful is it to hunt after wickednesse in the house of the Iust;
                  Prou. 24.28. or (as Salomon saith) to be
a witnesse against thy Neighbor without a cause. Many men are like vnto your
Ferrets or your Bloud-hounds, they go nosing and hunting after faults in other
mens grounds; and as Iob saith in another place, When there is
peace, they are iealous of treason. Of which kind of men Saint
Auste
                     •
                  
                saith, That prying
into other mens faults, they doe not looke into their owne. And therefore thou
oughtest not to be so busie in reprehending what is amisse in thy brother, as
inquisitiue in correcting thyne owne errours. And therefore Saint
Bernard giues vs this Item, Tam diu quisque sua peccata ignorat,
quam diu al

                  na explorat, See how
long a man is searching into other mens sins, so long is he ignorant of his
owne. This is the condition of ill natured men, and such as complaine of
the times, and of Fortune. The lesse fortunate things goe with vs, the more
suspitious wee be, saith Tacitus: And this is a Fate that
followes base and abiect minds; and therefore the Vulgar neuer put a bridle
vpon their jealousies. In a word, this is a hard course that they take,Iealousie a true Symptome of basenesse. and in all sorts
of men blame-worthie, but most in those that haue most power: for albeit by
their place and office they haue freer libertie to inquire; yet when their wits
are thus a wooll-gathering, they shamefully vse to erre, qualifying euill for
good, and good for euill. And if mens iudgements grounded vpon good
probabilities and faire apparances, proue many times false, and therefore haue
this caueat giuen vs by Christ, Nolite s

                  cundum faciem iudicare, Iudge not according to the face;
suspitions will hardly fall out to be true. There are some things so
notoriously bad, that it were foolishnes to think them to be good; othersome,
whom the intention makes to be good or bad, but are not so in themselues. The
Good take these in good part, leauing the true iudgement thereof vnto God, (as
Saint Augustine hath noted) and the Bad, in bad part. Mala mens,
malus animus, A good Soule hath good thoughts; but a bad Soule, bad
imaginations; idle suspitions and needlesse jealousies wait vpon them. Saint
Augustine and Saint Hierome are both of opinion, That he that
suspects ill of others, cannot possibly liue well himselfe. Dauid
desired of God, That he would iudge him, According to the iudgement of
those that loue thy Name, and take all things in good part.

                   art thou that iudgest

the heart, none but God hauing such iurisdiction ouer it. If thy brother fall
(saith he) his sinne is not layd to thy charge; and if hee rise againe, it is
not put to thy reckoning; he that now stands, may fall, and hee that is fallen
may rise againe. That man from whom we expect least, may be a Saint, and that
man from whom we expect most, may be a Sinner; for neither is our loue
certaine, nor our feare secured. In Leuiticus God hath commanded,
That none  should serue in his Sanctuarie, or presse to
offer the bread of his God, hauing either too long or too short a nose, or a
nose that stood awrie. Where that nose is taken to be somewhat of the longest,
which goes nosing and senting after other mens liues and actions: and that of
the shortest, which quickely takes snuffe, and frets and fumes at the wagging
of a Feather: and that to bee crooked; which wrests things indifferent, and to
the worser part. And therefore God sayde by Ezechiel, That he would
cut off the noses and eares of his People,
                  Ezech.
  23. and lay his indignation vpon them, and deale cruelly with them.
            The second circumstance is, That the sinne which wee find fault
withall, bee grieuous: for though light sinnes (as Origen hath noted
it) deserue correction, yet we haue not so precise an obligation for the
reproouing of them, as those that are more heinous. In this circumstance sute
your graue doctors &amp; your summists: and Saint Augustine prooues
the same out of the words of the Text, Lucratus es fratrem tuum, Thou
hast woon thy brother. Now that is not said to be woon againe, which hath not
beene lost before; wee doe not giue a brother for lost for light sinnes, and
such as ordinarily accompanie our humane frailtie; but when his sins are so
notorious, that the Church doth proceed against them with Excommunications and
grieuous censures. And if men will hardly beare with small faults in their
brethren, God forbid but that they should haue an eye to those that are of a
higher nature. Likewise, hee that will correct another man, must be free
himselfe from that sinne which he reprooueth in another.

                     .
  20.9. 
               Who can say (saith Salomon) I haue made my
heart clean, I am free from my sin? Who (saith Saint Augustine)
can so farre forth commend himselfe in this life, which is a continuall
temptation, that he carries a cleane heart? Saint Paul aduiseth
thee,
                  Gal. 6. when thou takest thy brother to
task, &amp; goest about to correct him, That thou consult and consider with thy
selfe, least thou thy selfe stand on the like termes, and art liable to the
same reproofe.
            The third circumstance is,Old sores must not be
  rubbed vp. When wee see our brother doth still perseuer and continue in
this his sinne. For, for a sinne alreadie past, and for the which there hath
beene a precedent sorrow and amendment, correction is no further needefull;
for it being dismist Gods Court, and being blotted out of the book of his
remembrance, man ought not to enter a new Action against it. If hee will not
vouchsafe to heare thee, that is, obey thee, (for Audire and
Obedire is all one; In auditu auris, obediuit mihi) you may
doe as in Christian charitie you see cause, alwayes carrying a discreet hand in
the businesse. But if he shall forthwith hearken vnto thee, and obey thy
instructions, thou must then forbeare to inflict any further punishment or
correction vpon him, than his owne contrition and submissiue obedience. Saint
Augustine tells vs, That the end of correction is, to put a bridle to
our sinnes, [In hamo &amp; fraeno maxillas eorum constringe, Put a bridle
in their mouth, and a hooke in their nosthrils] and as to the Horse that
carrieth himselfe well and handsomely with one bridle, it is needlesse to clap
two; so that Sinner that will be ruled and gouerned with the bridle of the
feare of God, it is superfluous and more than needs, to check him with the curb
of correction.
            The fourth circumstance is, When wee haue some probable hope of
doing good vpon our brother. The Physition is not bound to cure that Patient of
whom there is no hope of recouerie; much lesse if hee feare greater hurt will
follow thereupon. And this feare or jealousie may bee occasioned two manner of
wayes.
            Either in regard of the hardnesse of heart, or obstinate condition
of the partie that is to be corrected:
            
               Or in regard of the foolis
                  •
               nesse of the partie correcting.
            For that it is a businesse that will require a great deale of
discretion: and that amongst all other difficulties belonging to gouernment,
there is not any poyn
                  •
                that is
halfe so hard as this.
            First of all, For a stubborne heart and an obstinate brest,
correction is no conuenient meanes; the meanes must be regular, and make some
good end the aime they shoot at. Now those meanes from which I can hope for
nothing but hurt, ought not to oblige me to vndergoe so thanklesse an office;
Contest not with that man on whom thou shalt but cast away thy labour.

There are some Sinners of that knotty disposition, and so wedded to their owne
will, that if you shall but crosse their humour, you will hardly escape
without a stab. Si contuderis stultum in pila, non a

and one that is sicke, more sencible of another mans sickenesse; yet I am sure,
That the good, bewailes the miserie of the bad, and that the euill man is
alwayes cruell. Correct him in the spirit of meekenesse. With that
tendernesse, as a man would put a tent into a wound, or make cleane a
Venice-glasse; for our nature is more apt for a soft than a rough hand.

                  •
               urie, grew somewhat chollericke
and angrie, that God should suffer his Ministers to be so much wronged: And
God appearing vnto him, though his zeale for the Lord God of Hosts was great,
yet because it had not its drammes of discretion to qualifie the eagrenesse
thereof, a mightie strong winde rent the mountaines and brake the rockes before
the Lord; after the winde came an earth-quake; and after the earth-quake, came
a fire; and after the fire,  came a still and soft voice.
And it is added in the Text, that the Lord was not in the winde, nor in the
earth-quake, nor in the fire, but in that still and soft voice.Reprehension must be guided by discretion. Signifying
thereby, that he had the weapons of the windes, of earth-quakes, and of fire,
for to shake, ouerthrowe, and burne downe to the ground the tallest and
strongest towers and walles of his enemies; but withall, that he was of a sweet
nature, and that his vengeance was milde and gentle. There are some
corrections that teare vp the trees by the rootes, like a whirle-winde; that
shake and terrifie the Conscience, like an earth-quake; and that burne and
consume our honours to dust. But God is not in them. Hee that will correct
another (sayth Saint Paul) must consider what manner of Man himselfe
is. And that, as his brother hath sinned to day, so hee may sinne to morrow. To
day, thou findest thy brother guiltie, and to morrow it may so fall out, that
hee may come to bee thy Iudge. It is fit (sayth Petrus Crysologus)
that there should bee correction, to serue as a bridle to those that are
headstrong; but withall, That as a loose rayne does no good, so too hard a hand
may doe hurt. Lucian sayth, That our hart is a white, or marke whereat
shafts be shot: Whereof some are deliuered with that force and strength of the
arme, that passing quite through, they doe it much hurt; others againe with so
slacke a string, and that weakenesse, that falling short of the marke, they doe
no good at all. Wee must draw them therefore with that cunning, and with so
daintie a deliuerie, that wee may sticke iust in the white, and hit the right
marke. That Arque, obsecra, increpa, of S. Paul, argues a
quicke and nimble deliuerie. And that of Ouid, Precibusque minis regaliter
addit, is somewhat too Lordly and Commaunding a stile. What sayth
Ecclesiasticus? If thou blow the sparke it shall burne, if thou spit vpon
it, it shall bee quenched;
               
                  Eccle. 28.12.
               and both these come out of the mouth. A kind word is as soone giuen as
a curst, and costs vs but one and the same labour, as comming out of one &amp;
the same mouth. But as a hasty brawling kindleth fire, and an hasty fighting
sheddeth bloud▪ so on the other side mildenesse doth quench malice, and
deads those coales of choller which are readie to breake foorth into flames of
furie and madnesse. Sermo mollis (sayth Salomon) frangit iram, A
soft answere putteth away wrath,
               
                  Prou.
  15. 
               but greeuous words stirre vp anger. What sayes
Iob? His friends had giuen him a reprehension as foolish as it was
sharpe and bitter. Whereunto hee answered, How shall the mouth that is
distasted, eate that which is not seasoned with salt? Or what appetite will a
sicke and weake stomach haue to an egge, or a chicken that is not boyled with
salt? Yet farre more vnsauoury than either of these is an indiscreet reproofe,
and words out of season. The Seuentie translate it, Who can eat bread
without salt, or suffer imprudent correction? And as distast in our meats
may arise from too much or too little salt; so correction may haue so little
salt in it, that it may make the Sicke to dislike it, and refuse io eat it; and
on the other side, it may haue so much, that he will not be able to swallow it.
What good can hee doe, who in his correction doth discouer the passion and
hatred of one that is offended, the imperiousnesse of a proud spirit, the
taunting checkes of a rayling tongue, and the intemperate ioy of an enuious
heart? In a word, No creature must be toucht with a gentler hand, than
man, saith Seneca.
            
            The fifth circumstance is, That he that hath a sullyed conscience
of his owne, ought not to be the broome to sweepe another mans, so saith S.
Ambrose, Saint Hierome, Saint Chrysostome, and
Thomas. Therefore, ô man, art thou inexcusable (saith Saint
Paul) for in that thou iudgest another, thou condemnest thy selfe. It
is a wofull case, that thou being a Iudge, shouldest be found guiltie. This the
Deuill doth onely, whom God stileth his brothers Accuser. Thy lips are like

Thou must not looke that he should come vnto thee of his owne accord, for no
man will willingly come to bee corrected; nor must thou send one to call him
vnto thee; for beeing not thy Subiect, thou shouldest shew little ciuilitie in
it: nor would I haue thee to write vnto him; for Paper being but a dead
instrument, it may persuade but little, and perhaps runne the danger of

swallowes an iniurie, pocketting it vp for a time, putting on the face of
dissimulation, till he see his opportunitie, as Absalon did with
Ammon, and as Ioab did with Amasa;

properly with a particular iniurie done to a mans owne person: but as for those
other sinnes that are committed against our Neighbour, or against God, I am no
more bound to seeke out the sin, or him that hath trespassed in that kind, than
I am bound to seeke out a poore begger to giue him an Almes, beeing no Prelat
or Magistrate, on whom this obligation is more strictly laid.
            
               Goe and tell him his fault. This being Preceptum
affirmatiuum, an affirmatiue Precept, it doth not alwayes bind a man to
the performance thereof, but in it's due time and place. The Chyrurgeon doth
not open an impostume till it come to it's ripenesse; nor the Fisher strike at
the Fish, till he hath swallowed the bai
                  •
               , and offers to be gone. God stood waiting our first parents
leisure, till they beheld their owne nakednesse, and saw in what poore case
they were; and afterwards fell to reproouing of them. Saint Augustine
saith, It is charitie in a man to forbeare to reprehend, if he haue not a
fit time to doe it. Euen in your Pulpit-reprehensions, a wise and
discreet Preacher ought to obserue his times &amp; his seasons, that those
pearles may not be lost by being laid out to the furie of beasts. Because I
know your manifold transgressions,

Iust, your taking of bribes, and your oppressing the Poore in the gate, &amp;c.
 Therefore the Prudent shall keepe silence in that time,
for it is an euill time.
               'Tis in vaine to correct a man
  in the heat and heigth of sinne. It was neuer counted wisedome in any
man, to draw his sword against a foole or a mad man, though he come towards him
with a naked weapon in his hand. Saint Gregorie in his
Pastorall doth highly extoll the wisedome and discretion of
Abigal, who forbore, while Nabal had digested his wine:
applying her selfe to that rule of Ecclesiasticus, Controll not thy
neighbour when he is in his cups;1. Kings

water your horse when he is hot, nor offer a Bull meat when he is bitten and

knowne vnto them,
                  Gen. 45. how vnbrotherly
they had dealt with him when they sould him into Aegypt▪ he commanded
euery one to goe forth, insomuch that there was not a man besides themselues,
that tarried in the roome where they were. God corrected Cain when hee
found him alone by himselfe.
                  Gen. 4. Num.
  12. So when hee was angrie with Aaron and Mirian, and
resolued roundly to chide them, hee called them aside, sharpely rebuking
Aaron, and soundly punishing Mirian. Saint
Augustine saith, Tha
                  •
               
open sinne deserues open punishment, and that publique faults must haue
publique correction: but secret sinnes, secret admonition, vnlesse they be
verie hurtfull to Church or Commonwealth, as matters of heresie, or Treason
against the King and State; and then it is fit to acquaint the Clergie with the
one, and the Councell with the othet.
            
               If he will not hearken vnto thee when thou hast him alone,
  tell him therof the second time before one or two.
               This condition taken in the first sence de iniuria
  propria, touching an iniurie done to myne own person, is verie facile
  &amp; easie: for hauing first taken him aside, and priuatly acquainted him with
  the wrong he hath done me; if this faire proceeding will not preuaile with
  him, I may then lawfully tell him his own before one or two witnesses, that
  they may see (as Euthymius saith) that I complie with my dutie, and
  with that which God hath commanded me to doe.
               In the second sence, touching the sinning against our Neighbour
  and against God, this seemeth to some somewhat too hard a course; for the sinne
  beeing secret, the partie reprehended before two witnesses, may replie and say
  vnto me, That I lie, that there is no such matter, that I defame him and call
  his name in question, and complaining of me to the Iustice, he may prooue the
  defamation vpon mee, but I not prooue the delict vpon him. Saint
  Hierome saith, That these two witnesses ought likewise to bee his
  reproouers, and to put to their helping hand to raise him that is fallen: who
  cannot be Correctors of him, the sinne not appearing, in regard it is secret.
  Saint Augustine likewise saith, That he that correcteth a man must
  take one or two witnesses vnto him, that the correction may be the more
  effectuall, and the more substantiall. For, By the mouth of two or three
  euery word is confirmed, (so saith the Law) Id est, in testimonio vel
  sermone, by the testimonie or speech; vsing the figure
  Metonimia, when the cause is put for the effect.
               For this inconuenience sake, some say, That before I correct my
  brother the second time, I should make one or two witnesses acquainted with his
  fault, that they may ioyne with me in the correcting of him, and to the end
  that the correction may be the grauer and the more effectuall. And to him that
  shall replie, How can I reueale that sinne which in it selfe is secret? They
  answer, That it is a lesse ill, that two or three should know of it, and that
  by them he should rather suffer losse in his fame, than in his soule.
               Against these two witnesses we haue the authoritie of Saint
  Augustine, who willeth, That if any religious person shall commit any
  notorious sinne, or other scandalous action to his calling, thou shalt first
  teprooue him for it in secret, and  if then he shall not
  amend his fault, to reueale the same to his Bishop or Superiour. And he sets
  it downe as a ruled Case, That it were rather crueltie than charitie, not to
  open the wound of the Soule. And his reason is, Ne deterius putrescat in
  corde, Lest it grow worse and worse, ranckling and festring in the heart;
  as it is in the hiding of a wound in the bodie from the eye of the Surgeon.
  Nor let them thinke that you doe this out of malice or ill will, for you
  offend more in suffering your brother to perish by your silence, than by
  reuealing his fault for his good. T
                     •
                  is opinion of Saint Augustine made Thomas to
  confesse, That after the first admonition, I may reueale to the Prelat the
  delict of my brother, as to a father: for in verie deed, your Prelates haue in
  this kind farre greater authoritie. So that s
                     •
                  ch or such a sinne being to be reuealed, supposing two preceding
  witnesses, may be reuealed to the Prelat, as to a Iudge; but no witnesses
  preceding, only by admonition, as to a father.
               Against this Truth there is a great argument grounded out of the
  said Saint Augustine, In his rebus, &amp;c. In those things wherein the
  sacred Scripture sets downe no certaintie, the custome of Gods people, or the
  d
                        •
                     crees of our Auncestors are to
  bee held for Law. And the custome and vse of our Ancestors is, That these
  delicts should be reuealed to the Superiors; one while, by denunciation;
  another while, by accusation, without any preceding admonition: so is it
  ordered in their Edicts, without exception of any kind of faul
                     •
                  s whatsoeuer. I answer, Your Edicts are
  so farre forth to bee vnderstood and approoued, as that they shall not any way
  thwart or infringe the Law of the Gospell, in that which appertaineth to
  admonitions &amp; witnesses: &amp; that therfore your superiors haue not put
  these things in their Edicts, for that they are to be presupposed.
               
                  And if he wil not vouchsafe to heare thee, tell it vnto the
  Church; or make it known to his Prelat, for so doth Saint
  Chrysostome and Saint Hierome expound it. Nor doth our
  Sauiour Christ here treat of the secular Iudge, nor secular Lawes, but those
  that are Ecclesiasticall. And therefore he saith, Dic Ecclesiae, Tell it to
  the Church; for the power of Excommunication did belong vnto the
  Synagogues, as appeareth by Saint Marke and Saint Iohn.
                  
                     Mark. 1. For the casting of the blind man out of
  the Synagogue, was the same as Excommunication is now amongst the Christians.
  But first of all, two witnesses are required, to the end that shame may worke
  the Delinquent to amendment of his fault: but if this medicine shal not cure
  this his maladie, then sharper corrasiues are to be applied to this Sore,
  Vt qui non potuit pudore, saluetur opprobrijs, That him whom shame could
  not recal, reproch should; so saith Saint Hierome.
               
               
                  If he heare not the Church, let him be vnto thee as a
  Heathen and a Publican.

                        •
                     ch. Such Soueraigne authoritie
  hath the Church by the presence of Christ, and such is it's firmenesse, that it
  being as an immoouable Piller of Truth, The gates of Hell shall not
  preuaile against it; And of such continuance Christs fauour towards it,
  that he seales this assurance with an E
                        •
                     ce, &amp;c. Behold,
                  
                     Mat. 18.
                  I am with you till the end of the world; And such the especiall
  prouidence of the blessed Spirit towards it, that hee that shall despise it,
  his case is to bee accounted desperate. These two Truths the Church by long and
  many experiences hath made good vnto vs.
               The one, That hee that honours and respects the Church,
  receiueth very great and singular fauours from Heauen; He that shall
  glorifie me, (and in mee my Spouse and Ministers of my Word) I will
  glorifie him. And of these the Histories are full, both Diuine and
  Humane: Of Dauid, of Iosias, of Alexander Magnus,
  Theodosius, and Charlemaigne; who triumphed ouer powerfull
  enemies, for that they had respected the authoritie and dignitie of the Church,
  preferring stil the  same before the honour of their owne
  Crowns.
               The other, That they who haue despised and contemned it, haue
  euer beene held base and vile. They that contemne me, (and in mee my
  Spouse and my Ministers) shall bee esteemed base and ignoble: As
  amongst the Hebrewes it was to bee seene in a Saul, an Ozias,
  &amp; a Manasses: Among the Romans, in a Pompeius Magnus,
  who prophaned the sacred Temple of Hierusalem, yet durst not come to touch it's
  Treasure; so Cicero affirmeth, &amp;c. Thomas hath obserued,
  That God euer shewed himselfe more mercifull in reuenging his owne wrongs, than
  those that were done to the Ministers of his Church. The People of Israell
  worshipped a Calfe, and proceeded so farre in wronging the Maiestie of God,
  that they sticked not to say,
                     Exod. 32. This
  is that God which with a mightie hand &amp; outstretched arme freed vs from
  the Captiuitie of Aegypt. God punished this their iniquitie with the death of
  some of the principall offendors. Dathan and Abiram rebelled
  against Moses,
                  
                     Num. 16. and the
  earth swallowed them vp aliue.
            
            
               Sit tibi tanquam Ethnicus &amp; Publicanus.
               If he shall not be obedient to the Church, but shall despise the
  sentence of his Superiours,When the Salue can doe no good,
 the Saw must. 
                  Let him be vnto thee as a Heathen man and a
  Publican. In Leuiticus God commanded, That they should not offer
  vnto him any Sacrifice of honey; but he required the first fruits thereof: hee
  will at first haue honey, that is, mild admonitions, gentle persuasions, and
  friendly aduice; but if these wil not serue the turne, he vnsheaths his sword,
  and cuts thee off from the Church pronouncing this sentence against thee,
  Let him be to thee as a Heathen and a Publican. Hee doth heere poynt
  out two sorts of People, which Gods people did shun and auoyd.
               The one, Him that was a stranger to his Law.
               The other, Him that was a publique offendor therein: both which
  he wisheth vs to flie from.
               From the one, That they may doe vs no hurt; For, a little
  leauen will soure the whole lumpe.
               
               From the other, That being thereby ashamed of their sinnes, they
  may repent and amend.
               Wherein he seemeth to moderate the rigour of the Old Testament:
  for in Deutronomie he commandeth,
                     Deut. 17.
 The Gospell more milde than the Law. That he that will not heare the
  High-Priest, that man shall die the death; and that sonne that shall not be
  obedient to his father, shall be stoned to death. But God now shewing himselfe
  more mild and gentle, is contented that we should onely shunne the companie of
  such as are disobedient, being no better than canker'd and rotten Members,
  which may chance to infect and putrifie those other sound parts of the bodie.
  And albeit the excommunicating of those that conuerse with them (which course
  the Church now taketh) may seeme somwhat of the seuerest, for that it
  comprehendeth not onely the nocent, but the innocent, as well the not
  offending, as the offending; yet said the Samaritan woman, The Iewes doe
  not vse to keepe companie with Samaritanes: And they accused our Sauiour
  Christ, for that hee did eat with Publicans and Sinners; and because he did but
  talke with a Samaritan, they called him, by way of scorne, a Samaritan.
               These latter conditions of denunciating my brother to the
  Church, and of vsing him like an Hereticke or a Moore, haue seemed to the World
  to be somewhat too hard teaching; and baptizeth the Denunciator by the name of
  Delator, or priuie Accuser, or an Informer or Promoter. And euen in those
  Communities  and Commonwealths which haue renounced the
  Lawes of the world, it hath been held a point of honour and of noblenesse, not
  to enter or stand forth by accusing or denunciating in causis alienis:
  For he that shall doe so, is accounted but a base minded fellow; and one that
  hath no worth or goodnesse in him: and he had need haue an extraordinarie
  assistance of Gods spirit, that shall take this taske vpon him, when Zeale and
  Honour cannot agree vpon the point, one swaying this way, and another that:
  which distraction is made the more, the more great and powerfull the persons be
  that ought to be thus corrected.
               First, I answer, That one and the selfe same thing may be said
  to bee soure and sweet, after a diuers respect. Saint Mathew saith,
  That the way to Hell is broad and large. The Damned, they say it is a hard way,
  Ambulanimus vias difficiles, &amp;c. To correct and to be corrected
  shall be easie to the Spirit, but hard to the Flesh. And put case it be soure,
  yet the ajudas de Costa, those good supplies which the Iust shall
  enioy in this present life, and the hope of reward in the future, wil make it
  sweet.
               Secondly, I answer, That Feare and Cowardise propose sometimes
  difficulties where there are none;All feare and cowardise
 must be laied aside in the correcting of our Brethren. and he that is
  afraid that he sh
                     •
                  l not draw water
  from his brothers brest and eyes, How shall he hope to draw water out of a
  rocke or a stone? There is a great deale of controuersie and much adoo touching
  that sin of Moses, for which God denied him entrance into the holy
  Land: S. Paul saith, That it was incredulitie. The opinion of the
  Hebrewes is, That this his sinne was, his not speaking to the Rocke. God spake
  vnto these two brothers, and said, Loquimini ad Petram; which
  Moses strooke once or twice with his Rod, &amp;c. Now if two words
  would haue beene sufficient for to draw water out of a rocke, Is it much that
  Man should draw it out of the heart (though it were made of stone) and conuey
  it, as by a Conduit, to the eyes? Salomon saith, That many do excuse
  themselues of fulfilling Gods commandements, alledging their want of strength
  and abilitie; That it stands not with their health, to fast on halfe
  holydayes, nor to eat Fish in Lent, or on Frydayes [Vires non
  suppetunt.] Hereunto I make a twofold answer:
               The one, Deus est Inspector cordis, It is God that
  tryeth the heart and reynes, he knowes whither thou haue streng
                     •
                  h or no: thou canst not cozen him with
  a false Dye, thou maist cozen thy Physition with a lye, but thou canst not
  cozen God.
               The other, Ipse intelligit; God knowes well enough,
  That thou canst not doe any good thing without his helpe, for hee must assist
  thee with his grace in this life, and with glorie in the life to come, And
  will reward euerie man according to his workes. Leo the Pope saith, That
  hee that thinkes with himselfe, that it is a hard thing to be corrected▪
  must haue recourse to Gods mercie, &amp; to intreat his fauour that he will
  free him from this his euill custome, and so to humble him, that correction may
  seeme sweet vnto him.
               Lastly, Albeit at first the partie reprooued will shew himselfe
  harsh &amp; soure vnto thee, yet vpon better consideration hee will con thee
  thankes, and like better of thy plaine dealing with him, than if thou hadst
  soothed vp his sinnes; He that reprooues a man shall afterward find more
  grace than hee that deceiues him with a flattring tongue. To S.
  Austen, the corrections &amp; admonitions of his mother were
  vnsauorie; but afterwards he confessed, That he was much more beholding to her
  for hauing reduced him to the right way, than for bringing him forth into the
  world. Who is it that maketh me glad, (saith Saint Paul) but he
  that is made hea
                     
                        •
                     ie by me.
  The Scripture is full of rewards and of threatnings, both in the fauour 
   and disfauour of the Corrector and the Corrected. Of him
  that correcteth Crysostome saith, If thou shouldest giue
  innumerable riches to the Poore, thou shalt not worke that good thereby, as
  thou shalt by sauing a soule; for there is no price comparable with that
  of the Soule: Fructus justi, lignum vitae, By liuing well himselfe,
  and by gaining his brothers Soule. Saint Augustine saith, That euerie
  Christian should desire that all should be saued; and he that contemneth
  correction, doth in part denie this desire. And the Apostle Saint
  Iames, That he that shall conuert his brother, and remooue him from
  his errour, shall saue his soule from death: In which words are
  comprised as well his owne, as anothers soule. Thomas saith,
  Correction is eleemosina spiritualis, a spirituall kind of almes; and
  of so much more price than any other alms, by how much the soule is of more
  price than the bodie, &amp; by how much the goods of Grace are to be preferred
  before those of fortune and of Nature. He that succours the Poore, when hee
  giues most, hee can but lay downe his corporall life for him; but hee that
  raiseth vp him that is fallen, bestowes a spirituall life on him, and
  performes the office of an Apostle. So that to correct and
  
                     •
                  o be corrected, brings with it so
  much interest, and so much gaine, that euery man may account it for a great
  happinesse.
               The incorrigible man is so threatned in the sacred Scripture,
  that the verie feare thereof is able to quell his spirits,
                     Prou. 29. and to make him turne Coward. A man
  that hardneth his necke when he is rebuked, shall suddenly be destroyed,
  so saith Salomon: The Hebrew phrase is, Vir correctionum, he
  that liueth so ill, that a man had need to carrie alwayes in his hand a rod of
  correction for him; and instead of amending his faults, dayly addes sinne vnto
  sinne, whereby hee is ouertaken with sudden death, which in a Sinner is of all
  other euils the greatest. Other lesser threatnings are set downe by
  Salomon, Pouertie and shame shall be to him that forsaketh
  discipline: and now here he saith, Sudden destruction shall come vpon
  him. So long may hee perseuer in the hardnesse of his heart, that Gods
  justice may ouertake him, and shorten his dayes by sudden death. The truth of
  this is apparent in Pharaoh, to whom so many faire warnings and
  admonitions serued but to make the heape of his sinnes the higher, till at
  last, with those heapes of waters hee was ouerwhelmed suddenly in the sea. It
  is written in the Booke of Wisedome, That those cruell and many
  stripes which were bestowed vpon the Aegyptians, could not draw so much as one
  teare from their eyes, nor procure the libertie of Gods People of hard-hearted
  Pharaoh:He that refuse

  saw the death of their firstborn, then they howled &amp; wept, and
  Pharaoh himselfe was mooued and made pittious mone, and gaue present
  order for their departure. But here (I pray you) obserue with mee a fearefull
  kind of obstinacie; for they had scarce dryed their teares, scarce had they
  couered the graues of their Dead, when lo, those that had intreated for their
  departure, as fearing they should all die the death, Omnes mori
                        •

  falling into a rash and vnaduised consideration, followed after them, as if
  they had beene a companie of Fugitiues, forgetting the former torments which
  they had indured. And a wise man rendring the reason of this so foolish a
  resolution, saith, This their hardnesse of heart carried them

  disastro
                        ••
                      an end; to the end
  that those whom the plagues which God had sent among them (as so many
  admonitions &amp; so many warnings) had not made an end of, sudden death might
  destroy, and supplie the defect of that punishment. O, that Sinners would bee
  so wise as to enter into discourse with themselues. The Adulterer, whom God
  hath freed from a thousand notorious dangers of his life and credit; though
  his brethren haue not checkt him, yet hath his owne conscience corrected him
  with greater seueritie, and far more  sharpely; as also
  the sudden death of other his fellow Adulterers. A sudden stab takes him out of
  the world, Vt quae deerant tormentis suppleret punitio, That punishment
  may supplie what is wanting to his torments. Another in some bad fashion
  hazards his honour, God miraculously preserues him more than once or twice,
  that he may take warning thereby, and reclaime him selfe: he mixes a thousand
  bitter galls with his sweet delights, hee affrights him with sudden assaults,
  this doth no good on him: hee strikes him with a Lethargie that depriues him of
  his sences, &amp; thus through his owne wilfulnes &amp; hardheartednes, he is
  haled violently as it were by the haire of the head, to this so miserable an
  end; Vt quae de

               In fauour of the reward which the Corrected shall receiue,A patient eare shall reape great profit. Prou. 15.
                  Salomon proposeth many graue sentences to that purpose; The eare
  that hearkneth to the correction of life, shall lodge among the wise, not
  onely in earth, but in-heauen; for, Quicquiescit arguenti,
  gloriabitur. Amongst other pledges, that a Soule may assure it selfe that
  God wisheth it well, is, the sending of a Legat vnto him to aduise him of his
  faults. Si corripuerit me iustus in miserecordia, hoc ipsum sentiam,
  (it is Saint Bernards) I will receiue him as sent from God. Labia

  before hath beene said) but preserueth from corruption; so are the words of my
  Beloued, they are bitter, but are directed to the sauing of my life, and to
  preserue me from death. Saint Augustine drawes a comparison from him
  that is franticke, and one that is sicke of a Lethargie; the one fals into
  follie, the other into a profound sleepe: he that bindes the one, and wakes the
  other, is troublesome to them both; but beeing both recouered, they both giue
  him thankes.
               
                  Thou hast gained thy brother. This is the end; and (as
  Aristotle saith) Finis est fundamentum omnium actionum nostrarum,
  The end is the foundation of all our actions, and the gaining of a lost
  brother is the end and scope of these our diligences. Where I would haue you to
  note, That hee that doth a wrong, doth euer receiue more hurt than he that hath
  the wrong; Qui alterum ladit, plus sibi nocet, Hee that hurts another, doth
  most hurt to himselfe; for the hurt that the wronged receiueth, is
  outwardly, and in bodie; but the hurt of him that wrongeth is inwardly, and in
  soule. And therefore Saint Paul saith, Yee that sinne against your
  brother, sin against Christ; he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man,
  but God. And our Sauiour Christ, He that shall call his brother Foole,
  is worthie of Hell fire: So that the wronged cannot receiue the third
  part of the harme of the partie wronging. Plato is of opinion, That
  hee that doth an iniurie to another, doth the greatest to himselfe; and cannot
  (if he would) studie to doe himselfe a worse mischiefe. Dauid was much
  wronged by Absolon, (for what greater offence could a sonne commit,
  than to rise vp in rebellion against his owne father?) but hee considering with
  himselfe, That his sonne had done himselfe the greater hurt, called out vnto
  the men of Warre, and said vnto them, Seruate mihi puerum Absalon, Spare my
  son Absalon, and see you doe not slay him. And therefore our Sauiour
  Christ teacheth vs this Lesson, If thy brother receiue the greater hurt of the
  two by the wrong and iniurie that he doth thee, doe not goe about to bee
  reuenged of him, but rather take pittie and compassion of him; as thou wouldst
  be grieued for him, who thinking to giue thee a wound, should put a stoccado
  vpon himself, &amp; die in the place. Reprooue therefore thy brother, and if he
  shal hearken vnto thee, Lucratus es fratrem tuum.
               
               
                  Thou hast gained thy brother. God hath a great desire,
  that thou shouldst win thy brother to thee, &amp; gain his soule. To this
  purpose he put that Parable of the  Sheepeheard that went
  forth to seeke his lost Sheepe; of the woman that swept euerie corner in her
  house ouer and ouer, to looke her lost groat: Which are but expressions of that
  great care which God taketh in seeking after a Sinner, and the desire that he
  hath to reduce him to his obedience. To the like end did he propose that other
  Parable of the prodigall Child; whose argument ends in the great ioy wherewith
  his father welcommed him home, after hee had giuen him for lost. And heere in
  this place hee wi

                  ls euerie one of
  vs by one meanes or other,The best seruice we can doe to
 God, is to reclaime a sinner from his sinne. to win our brother: first,
  to deale with him by faire meanes; if that will not serue the turne, then by
  foule, making his fault knowne to the Prelats of the Church. So that it seemes,
  that God when hee cannot worke vs for Heauen by faire and gentle persuasions,
  by loue and intreaties, then will hee vse blows &amp; stripes, &amp; beats vs
  thither before him, making vs to feele the weight of his heauie hand. Hath not
  God commanded thee, That if thou meet with an Oxe that is fallen, thou shouldst
  not passe forward on thy way till thou hast holpe him vp?1.
 Cor. 9. 
                  And yet (saith Saint Paul) Nun
  est Deo cura de Bobus? What doth God care for Oxen? Yet if he will that
  thou relieue a sillie Oxe, how much more will he, that thou take pittie of a
  Sinner that is fallen? Saint Chrysostome treating at large, How that
  Seruant was condemned by his Master, that kept his Talent wrapt vp in a Napkin,
  not putting it out to some good vse or other; sayth, That there was sufficient
  cause enough to condemne him, that hee would not venture his Talent for his
  Masters profit, and the good of his brethren. God so inrich vs with his grace,
  that we may vse our Talent well, that when our Master Christ Iesus shall come
  and call vs to account, we may not be found vnprofitable seruants; which God
  grant for his mercies sake.
            
         
         
            
            THE XXI. SERMON, VPON THE WEDNESDAY AFTER THE THIRD SONDAY IN
LENT.
            
               
                  MAT. 15. 
                  
                     Tunc accesserunt ad eum ab Hyerosolimis Scribae &amp;
  Pharisaei.
                   
                  Then came vnto him from Hierusalem, the Scribes and
  Pharisees.
               
            
            
               THis Gospell is an Embassage which the Scribes and Pharisees
performed comming from Hierusalem to Gennezaret,Euuie, the
  guide that brought the Pharises to our Sauiour. a Countrie of Galilee
where at that time our Sauiour resided. But so foolish an Embassage, from a
Nation so graue, and from a commonweal
                  •
               h so flourishing as that was (as Saint Hierome hath noted
it) was neuer deliuered by any but themselues. The Carthusian sayes, That
these Pharisees were of Zanedrin, that supreame Councell which succeeded those
seuentie Elders chosen by God, for to assist his Seruant Moses in the
gouernment of his People. And Theophilact saith, That the Pharisees
were despised throughout all the Cities of that Kingdome▪ but that those
of Hierusalem were counted the grauest amongst them, more respected than the
rest, and of all other the proudest and most insolent. Who seeing some of our
Sauiours Disciples, To eat with unwasht hands, they made a journey of
purpose vnto him. The occasion which added wings to their feet, &amp; the
determination which they had in their brests, was not that which they here
published, but the many miracles which our Sauiour wrought in the Land of
Galilee: for there was not that sicke bodie, if he could but come to touch his
garmenr, but that he was presently made whole. And this (as Saint
Chrysostome hath well obserued) was the cause of their comming vnto
him. Tunc accesserunt, Then, and not till then did they stirre: his
fame was now spread abroad, and when it had reacht to Hierusalem, it grew so
great, that it strooke the Scribes and Pharisees into such astonishment, and
stirred vp such enuie in them, that desiring to lessen our Sauiours honour,
cut the wings of his fame a little shorter, and disgrace and discredit him in
his person, they tooke hold of such a foolish and friuolous occasion, as the
like was neuer heard of; As his Disciples washing, or not washing their 
 hands; picking a quarrell with him: and to colour the
matter the better, they pleaded Custome.
            
               They came vnto Iesus.
               It is a verie strange thing in my vnderstanding, That the
  Scribes and Pharisees making so little reckoning of that which did import them
  so much, they should now make such a doo about that which did import them so
  little. The rarest and greatest accident that the World euer saw, was Christs
  comming into the World. The Iewes did earnestly desire it, and beg it so
  instantly at Gods hands, that it was the verie marke and white whereat the
  sighes and prayers of the Saints did aime and shoot at. And when the fame of
  this his comming was blowne abroad, trumpetted farre and neere by the Kings of
  the East, the Sybels, and Prophets, the diligences of Herod, and the
  death of those innocent Babes; the supreame Councell sent some of their Leuites
  to Iohn Baptist, To demand of him, What art thou? For they standing
  much vpon their authoritie and greatnes, they would not stirre one foot out of
  doores themselues: but heere now they come in person from Hierusalem to
  Galilee, vpon so sleight an occasion as the washing or not washing of the
  hands, making much adoo about a matter of nothing. In ordinarie businesses we
  will trust our seruants, sending one this way, and another that way; but in
  things that more neerely concerne vs, we will take the paines to goe about it
  our selues. But Enuie and Loue are woont sometimes to change hands, making
  Mountaines Mole-hils, and Mole-hils Mountaines; little, much, and much
  little.
               In point of Loue, we haue a plaine example thereof in
  Iacob, whom Leahs fruitfulnesse more importing him than
  Rachaels beautie, (for Christ came from Iacob by
  Leah, and not by Rachael) yet Iacob serued fourteene
  yeares for Rachael, an
                     •
                  
  was well contented with it; whereas for Leah he would haue thought
  halfe a yeare too long a time. And such againe might haue beene his loue, that
  Leahs bleerenesse of the eyes, might haue seemed more pleasing vnto
  him than the faire lookes of Rachael: Ojos ay (as it is in the
  Prouerbe) que de lagan̄as se enam
                        •
                     
                     ran, It is as a mans mind or fancie takes him.
               In point of Enuie, many more are the examples, for the Enuious
  taking pleasure in the hurt of the Enuied, that he may doe him a little ill,
  suffers much himselfe, and neglecting his owne proper good, which concernes
  him much, hee desires much another mans hurt, which concernes him little. And
  much to this purpose makes that comparison of the Cow which is bitten by a
  gad-bree or dume-flie, specified by the Prophet Osce, Ephraim is become a
  wanton Heifar: Another Translation hath it, Like a Cow that is
  stung. A Flie makes a Cow to runne vp and downe as if she were mad, and
  makes her either headlong to breake her necke downe the Cliffes, or to bemyre
  her selfe in some Bog where shee is stifled. It is a strange thing, that so
  little a creature should thus trouble and disquiet so great a Beast. But this,
  and more than this doth Enuie worke vpon light occasions. Iosephs
  Dreame and his coloured Coat wrought much vpon his Father and brethren, though
  graue and wise persons. That little short Song, Sa
                        ••
                      hath slaine his thousand, and Dauid his ten
  thousand, did so disquiet Saul, that it thrust a thousand
  jealousies into his head, &amp; much troubled him for a long time after. Saint
  Gregorie saith, That the enuious man doth suffer two Hells; one in
  this life, and another in that other life: and in some sort, this is the
  greater Hell of the two; for good beeing here a torment vnto him, he liues
  lesse tormented in Hell in that other life, where there is nothing but ill.
  Hence Antonio  de Padua drew a discreet conceit,
  That Go
                     •
                  
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   not doe the Enuious a fauour
  in affoording him Heauen; for he receiuing
  
                     •
                  o much torment from so short and
  transitorie goods as those of this life, hee would liue much more tormented in
  Heauen, where there is so much good, without any the least shew or signe of
  ill.
               
                  Why doe thy Disciples not wash their hands? Here we are
  to consider, who it is that makes this criminall Accusation; then, against whom
  it is made: painted, but rotten Sepulchres, whited, but stinking Dunghills;
  against him that was blamelesse in his life, and in his Doctrine diuine and
  heauenly. The Apocalyps paints out a woman rounded and circled in on
  euerie side with Light, the Sunne being her Mantle, the Starres her Crowne, the
  Moon her Chapines; and a Dragon waiting to deuoure the sonne which shee was to
  bring forth. Nor is there any thing (saith Chrysologus) whereon Enuie
  dares not to venture; Coelum tentat, Terras vrit, Reges vrget, Populos
  vastat, It tempts Heauen, torments Earth, presseth Princes, and oppresseth the
  People. In a word, Enuie is growne so bold and so insolent, that it dares
  to set vpon God, not contenting her selfe, that men should bee only Homicides,
  Fratricides, Patricides; but also Deicides, seeking to quit God of his
  life.
               Why doe thy Disciples transgresse the tradition of the Elders,
  That they wash not their hands, when they eate? They sayd before to
  the Disciples, Your Master eates with Publicans and Sinners: And here
  in this place, to their Master, Thy Disciples wash not their hands.
  Such whisperers, and mutterers as these,Informers as great a
 plague in a common weale as the flyes of Aeg
                        •
                     pt. are like vnto those flies which goe buzzing still about
  mens eares, and where they light and rest themselues, they vsually leaue behind
  them wormes and maggots; And therefore, whereas Dauid sayth, Et in
  cathedra pestilentiae non sedit, And hath not set in the chaire of
  Pestilence. The Hebrew hath the word Susurronis, In the Talebearer or
  Informers Chaire. Because your flyes of Aegypt are a kind of plague
  
                     〈◊〉
                   pestilence. If Moses
  had not destroyed them, they had destroyed the Aegyptians. One little sparke
  is ynough to burne a whole house; and one malicious tongue, to vndoe a whole
  Citie. Therefore shal God destroy thee and plucke thee from out thy
  Tabernacle, and thy roote from out the land of the liuing.
                  
                     Psal. 52.5. It is the prophecie of King
  Dauid against Doeg
                  ▪ the Edomite, who did whisper in King
  Sauls eare the releefe which Abimelech the Priest had giuen
  him of the Shewbread, and of his giuing him Goliah his sword;
  wherewith he kindled such coales of wrath in the Kings brest, that he slew
  seuentie Priests of them when they were in their sacred robes, together with
  their wiues and children: He likewise ouerthrew their houses. And therefore the
  Prophet sayth, So shall God destroy thee for euer, he shall take thee and pluck
  thee out of thy Tabernacle, and roote thee out of the land of the Liuing, So
  that there shall not be any relickes of thy linage left aliue. A frogge is the
  Hierogliphick of a whisperer, or flattering sycophant, and of a Court
  tale-carryer; his eyes are readie to start out of his head, to prie into other
  mens faults; he leades his life in mire and mud, and the filthy puddles of
  sinne; hee is tailelesse like an Ape, discouering still his owne shame, and yet
  is still mocking and gybing at other mens defects. The writer of the
  Reuelation, sayth, That hee saw issuing out of the Dragons mouth (by which hee
  meanes Antichrist) eight foule fiends, like vnto frogs.
                     Apoc. 16. This similitude he tooke from the
  effects; for that they are troublesome creatures, importunate, still balling
  and croaking out their malice, and liuing in the mudde, they no sooner stirre
  but they trouble the water that is cleere, still, and quiet. And this is the
  picture or representation of a Whisperer, who is euer troublesome,
  importunate, and a great  babler, and liuing in the
  mudd

                     •
                  his vices, troubles the peace and
  quiet of the Commonwealth. The Naturalists doe much indeere the poyson of a
  certaine Fish called Torpedo, or the Crampe-fish; of whom they report, That
  hee doth benumme the arme of the Fisher, the venome where of passing from the
  Hooke to the Line, and from the Line to the Cane, makes his hand to shake and
  tremble, that he is forced to let fall his Angle-rod. They likewise say of him,
  That he darts his poyson from the sea, on those that walke by the shore side:
  but your Whisperers and Tale-tellers diffuse their poyson a great deale
  further; it is a wofull and wretched case, that any eares should bee found to
  receiue such poyson. Salomon saith, A mouth that speaketh lewd
  things I doe hate; reading therein a Lecture to the Princes of the earth,
  That they should hate and abhorre such Earewigs. Pliny saith, That
  there is so great an antipathie and contrarietie betweene the Ash tree and the
  Serpent, that the Serpent will sooner passe through hot burning coles, than by
  the leafes or boughes of this Tree. And for a token that Princes should abhorre
  these venimous Serpents, these Court-whisperers, they were woont to weare
  Crownes of wreathed Ashe. Dauid puts it amongst those pledges of
  Heauen,
                     Psal. 1
                        •
                     .3 
                  He that doth no euill to his Neighbour,
  nor takes vp a reproch against him.
               
               
                  Why doe not thy Disciples wash their hands, &amp;c.
  Amongst other innumerable differences of the just man and the Sinner, foure fit
  well for our present purpose.
               
                  (1.)The first is, That the just hath
  no eyes saue to looke vpon his owne sinnes; and the Sinner hath not any saue
  onely to prie into other mens faults. The Aegyptians had an eye, and that a
  strict one too, ouer the Children of Israell; but so had not the Israelites
  ouer the Aegyptians: And the Booke of Wisedome rendring the reason
  thereof, saith, Onely vpon them there fell a heauie night, but thy Saints
  had a verie great light. Dauids eye-sight serued him to see the Sheepe
  that 
                     〈◊〉
                   stolne from his subiect,
  but had neuer an eye to look out to behold his owne robbing of another man both
  of his wife and his life. Our Sauiour Christ said of the Pharisees, That they
  could spie a moat in another mans eyes, but not see the beame that was in their
  owne. Dauid, though he were in grace and fauour with God, yet did his
  sins so trouble him, that he thought no man was so great a Sinner as himselfe:
  Which made him to crie out, Peccatum meum contrame est; and anon after
  to come vpon his knees vnto God,
                     Psal.
                     
                        •
                     1.1. with, Haue mercie
  vpon mee, 
                        •
                      God, according to thy
  louing kindnesse, and according to the multitude of thy mercies blot out my
  transgressions. Here he embarkes all the mercies of God, hee makes a stop
  and stay of them, he arrests them, that they may not goe from him, hauing so
  great need of them as he had. So must thou, and I, and all of vs, desire &amp;
  beg the like at Gods hand; and to thinke with our selues, that no mans sinnes
  in the world are more or greater than ours.
               The second is grounded vpon a certaine kind of language &amp;
  phrase of Scripture,The godly looke carefully to their
 wayes. which saith, That he that feareth God will looke wel vnto his
  wayes, haue an eye to his actions, and throughly examine his owne conscience:
  Qui timet Deum, conuertetur ad corsuum; but he that doth not feare
  God, minds none of all these. And of this mind is Petrus Chrysologus,
  treating of the Prodigall, Abij
                        •
                      in Regionem longinquam, He went into a farre Countrie: This
  journey of his (saith he) was farther off in point of his vnderstanding, than
  of place; for there is no Region more remote than that which remooues vs from
  God, and makes a Sinner to goe on in the wickednesse of his wayes. Saint
  Paul doth earnestly aduise vs,What is
 
                        •
                     ent by
 
                        〈◊〉
                      of Time that we should
  redeeme the time, Because the dayes are euill, that is, so short, that
  they vanish in an instant. Iacob stiled a hundred thirtie eight yeares
  of his life,  
                  Malos annos, Euill yeares, for
  that they 
                     〈◊〉
                   full of trouble and
  vexation. A man that is much imployed, and full of businesse, his ordinarie
  phrase is, No tengo bora mia, I am not myne owne man, no not for an
  houre; I am so taken vp with businesse, that I am made as it were a slaue
  and drudge vnto them. Salomon called those, Euill dayes, which were
  spent in searching into other mens liues, in reading Histories, and other
  worldly actions which doe little or nothing at all concerne vs. The Apostle
  would haue vs to redeeme them; Redeeme those thou hast sould and mis-spent;
  for many were with me. Thy Angells did guard me. And amongst those
  many that had not an eye vnto their wayes, I had alwaies a care to looke vnto
  my steps.
               The third is, That the Sinner lookes vpon the just,The godly make vse of the Sinner for their owne good, so
 doth not he of them Prou. 25. as on the Attorney that accuseth
  him, the Executioner that torments him, &amp; the Crosse that grieues &amp;
  afflicts him; The Sinner doth behold the Iust with attention, and seakes
  to take his life from him, because in looking vpon him he beholds his owne
  condemnation. The Elephant troubles that water which represents his owne
  foulenesse vnto him: And the Ape breaks that glasse wherein he sees his own
  ilfauoured face. A righteous man falling downe before the Wicked, is like a
  troubled Well, and a corrupt Spring. But the just man lookes vpon a
  Sinner, as vpon a wand that beats the dust out of him; as Gods Hangman, or the
  Instrument to execute his will. So King Dauid looked vpon
  Shimei when he cursed him; so Gods People vpon Pharaoh and
  Nebucadnezar; so the Prophet, on the Lyon which took his life from
  him on the way. Saint Augustine compares the Sinner to a Milstone and
  a Winepresse; the one clenseth the Oyle, the other purgeth the Wine. But
  it is not so with the Wicked, for they are like dust that are scattered before
  the face of the wind: The Hebrew renders it, Like a Measure that leuels
  out a thing to it's iust bredth and length, &amp; defends it from colds and
  heats. Saint Augustine expounding that place of Genesis, Major
  seruiet Minori, That Esau who was the elder brother, should serue
  Iacob that was the younger; askes the question, Wherein Esau
  did serue him, being that he was alwayes an enemie vnto him? And his answer is,
  That hee did serue him euen in his forsaking of him and his persecuting of
  him.
               The fourth and last difference is,The wicked like the fly will be allwaies sucking as
 
                        •
                     he botch. That there being
  many things worthy commendation, and of much vertue and goodnesse, in the
  Iust; the Sinner will neither haue an eye to see them, nor a tongue to praise
  them; but to find out the least moat or atome of ill, he is Eagle-eyed. And
  like vnto the Vulture, ouerflying the pleasant fields, and passing by the
  sweet smelling pastures, pitches vpon the blade bone of an Asse, or the
  carkasse of some stinking Carrion: or like vnto the Flie, who hauing the whole
  bodie, and that a faire one too, to light vpon, makes choice to fall vpon no
  other place but some tumour, or swelling. Those that did accompanie the Spouse,
  enuying her prosperitie,
                     Cant. 1. did murmure
  and gybe at her, saying, That for a Queene shee was somewhat of the blackest.
  Whereunto she answered, That indeed she was blacke, yet faire withall.
  Aaron and his sister Mirian murmured against Moses,
  Because hee had taken an Aethyopian to wife: Is it not a fine thing, (said
  they) that a Gouernor of so many Soules, a Ruler and Commander ouer Gods
  People, should marrie with a Blackamoore? The Rule which we are to obserue, is
  matter of Vertue; let vs fixe our eys vpon other folkes vertues, and turne
  them aside from those good gifts which are in our selues, Aemulamini
  charissimata meliora; but in matter of vice we must do the contrarie,
  &amp;c.
               
                  Why doe not thy Disciples wash their hands? The seeing
  of one doe amisse, is many times the condemning of all: And this Leaprosie
  cleaues closest to the  Vulgar. Saint Augustine
  saith, Th
                     •
                  t the state
  Ecclesiasticall hath more particularly a great vnhappinesse in this with the
  Common people: for though such a woman bee an Adultresse, yet for all this,
  other husbands doe not thinke a jot the worse of their owne wiues: And though
  such a mans sonne bee a Theefe, they doe not therefore hate their owne
  children. But if a Minister doe amisse, or a Churchman commit such or such a
  sinne, they presently crie out against the whole Bodie of the Clergie; and what
  is but light in others, is heynous in them.
               
                  Why doe yee also transgresse, &amp;c. Sweet Iesu, They
  hauing throwne so many iniuries vpon thee, &amp; those in the highest nature
  [In Beelzebub the Prince of deuils, &amp;c. a Glutton, a Samaritane,
  and the like reproch full tearmes] how comes it to passe, that thou didst then
  answer them so mildely, and now vpon so light an occasion as this, thou
  growest so angrie with them? I answer, The occasions are many.
               
                  Patience once wounded, turns to
 deadly rage.First of all, They had so ouerlayed him with iniuries, and
  so wronged his patience, that it seemeth he desired but some good occasion to
  tel them their own, and what kind of people they were; Quis dabit mihi
  Spinam &amp; veprem exoptanti? O, that I could but alter my nature, or
  change my condition; O, that I could of a Rose become a Thorne. Moses
  his Rod was turned into a Serpent, and such a Serpent, that it deuoured those
  other Serpents of the Inchanters of Aegypt; whereby God did then seeme to say,
  King Pharaoh hath made him a Dragon, thinking to deuoure my People
  aliue; Ad te ô Draco magne, But I will turne my selfe into a
  Dragon, and will swallow downe whole both him and all his People.
               
                  Enuie hath more of the Deuils venom
 in it, than any other vice.Secondly, Howsoeuer light this occasion may
  seeme to bee, there lay a great deale of malice hidden vnder it, and a great
  deale of enuie. Other vices haue much of the Deuils venome in them, but none of
  them so much as Enuie. There was a great deale of enuie couered vnder those
  words, when the little childeren cried to Elisha, Baldpate, bald pate;
  whereupon the Beares came downe amongst them from the mountaines, and tore
  fortie two of them in pieces. This punishment may seeme to exceed their
  offence; but the name of Baldpate did include much malice. For it beeing a
  fashion amongst the Prophets, to weare long haire like Nazari
                     •
                  es, they in dirision call the Prophet,
  Baldpate. And Iustine Martyr farther discouereth this their malice,
  and saith, That some of the Iewes were of opinion, That the Deuill had dasht
  Elias in pieces on the top of some high mountaine; and that these
  childrens meaning was, when they cried, Come vp thou Baldpate, that
  the Deuill would doe the like by him. This their malice was likewise holpen on
  by their Parents, who read this Lecture to their Children. And fit it was that
  Beares should be their Executioners; for a Beare being at his birth an vnshapen
  lumpe of flesh, the Dam thereof by licking of it brings it's eyes, mouth, and
  nose into a forme. In like manner, the parents of these children had shaped
  them according to their owne mind, and informed them what they should say. In a
  word, These Scribes and Pharisees finding fault with the Disciples not washing
  of their hands, taxeth maliciously the vncleannesse of their hearts; and from
  that little sanctitie that they would inforce vpon his Disciples, they would
  faine infer, That their Master had but little holinesse in him; Wherein they
  shewed the great malice they bare vnto him.
               Besides, There are some things which in Noblemen and Gentlemen
  are but toyes and trifles to speake of, which in those that professe a state of
  more perfection, are grieuous crimes. A young Gallant rounds the streets at
  night, courts  his Mistresse at her window, entertaines
  her eares with musicke, and this in him is not held any disgrace at all; but a
  graue Churchman, an old Deane, or a Chanon doth the like, this in him is a
  foule fault, and esteemed to be a heinous sinne. Dauid was a man of
  great strength; Sampson stronger than hee; cut off Dauids
  haire, and you abate not one iot of his strength; but cut off
  Sampsons, &amp; he grows as weake as water, and yee may do what yee
  will with him, because his strength was in his haire.
               Thirdly, Saint Hierome saith in an Epistle of his to
  Demetriades,
                  'Tis base in any, to seeke his
 owne credit, by the discredit of another. That nothing doth more
  discouer the basenesse of mans mind, and the vnworthinesse of his disposition,
  as to seeke to credit himselfe by discrediting of others, and to pretend
  estimation not by the good in himselfe, but the ill in others; and comparing
  themselues with men of meane deserts, seeke to shine through others darknesse.
  Esay likens the heart of an ill natur'd man, to a troublesome and
  tempestuous sea, which seeking to cleanse it selfe,
                     Esay 57. casts all it's filth vpon those shores
  which are next to it. The proud Pharisee kneeling before the Alter, boasted
  himselfe saying, I am not as other men; these men are theeues, I am
  not so; these men are couetous, I am not so, &amp;c. In your ballances, the one
  cannot come vp vnlesse the other come downe; the Moone giues not her light till
  the Sunne hides his head.
                     Luke 18, In a word,
  It is the manner of some men to rise by other mens falling, and to grace
  themselues by disgracing others. Pharaohs Magi could increase euils;
  Moses caused Frogs, and they caused Frogs; Moses, Flies, and
  they Flies: but they could not lessen nor stop euills; bid them take away those
  plagues, they could not doe it. So there are some men, all whose worth and
  power consists in adding euills to euills, but not in taking them away. But God
  runnes a contrarie course, he alwayes doth good, but neuer does that is il:
  Sicut malum inter ligna syluarum,
                  Some delight in
 nothing but doing euill. He is a Pippen among Thorns, he inuites vs with
  his Fruit; they scratch &amp; teare our flesh. And albeit the washing of the
  hands was a verie light fault, yet one little and another little comes in the
  end to make a mickle. His Disciples doe not wash their hands, they doe not fast
  with Iohn Baptist, their master keepes companie with Publicans and
  sinners, he obserues not their Fasts, he hath made a compact with
  Belzeebub, Non est à Deo, He is not of God. See what a
  malicious conclusion they make of these premisses.
               Fourthly, It is a hatefull thing to God, That a man should
  commend Vice, and condemne Vertue; Hee that iustifies the Wicked, and
  condemneth the lust,
                  The wicked are wholy giuen
 to condemne Vertue and commend Vice. Esay 5.20.23. 
                  both
  are an abhomination to the Lord. Esay repeateth the same lesson in the
  fifth Chapter of his Prophecie, Woe vnto them that speake good of euill,
  and euill of good; that iustifie the wicked, and take away the righteousnesse
  of the righteous from him. And for the better qualifying of the greatnesse
  and heinousnesse of this fault, in one place the Scripture cals it abhominable;
  and in another, bewailes it with a Vae, or Wo; which (as Saint
  Gregorie hath noted it) is commonly athreatning of a perdurable
  punishment. And therefore Esay farther addeth, As the flame of
  fire deuoureth the stubble, and as the chaffe is consumed of the flame, so
  their root shall be as rottennesse, and their bud shall rise vp like
  dust.
               
               Fiftly, Our Sauiour returnes the point of this weapon vpon their
  owne bosomes, by comming vpon them with a Quare &amp; vos, conuincing
  (as Saint Hierome saith) this their slander, with a truth.He that would reproue an other, must▪ first
 redresse himselfe. The like befell him in the case of the Adultresse,
  when the Pharisees askt him, If they should stone her or no to death, according
  as the Law commanded: whereunto he answered, Let him that is without sinne
  cast the first stone; it is but a slouer
                     •
                  ly tricke to go about with foule hands to make another bodie
  cleane. Aristotle faith, That the eyes haue no colour, 
   (nature so holding it fit) to the end they might the
  better receiue and discerne all other colours. In like manner, he that will
  reprehend other mens faults must himselfe be blamelesse. Dauids sinne
  was knowne to all the world, yet he made confession thereof onely vnto God,
  Against thee onely haue I sinned, &amp;c. because God onely had the
  power to punish him. For he onely (saith Saint Augustine) doth iustly
  punish, in whome there is not any thing to be found that deserueth
  punishment;The punishment of sinne belongs onely vnto
 God. and that man is fit to reprehend another, in whom nothing is to bee
  found worthie reprehension. Those of Israell sallyed twice out against those of
  Beniamin, desiring justice at Gods hands of that cruell sinne which they had
  committed, but were both times ouercome. Saint Gregorie saith, That
  they went forth against them to reuenge Gods honour, and the wrong that was
  done to their Neighbour; but God did not giue them the victorie, because they
  had an Idoll amongst them which they adored. Now hee that will punish another
  mans sinnes, must first purge himselfe of his owne sinnes.
               The representing of mans owne sinnes to himselfe, is a great
  Tapaboca, or stopgame, to play vpon other mens faults. To that Sinner
  who vseth to cast his sins like a wallet ouer his shoulder, God saith,
  Statuam contra te faciem tuam, I will make thee to see that which thou
  doost not see, and I will bring those sinnes which thou hast throwne behind thy
  backe, before thy face, to the end that being ashamed of thyne owne doings,
  thou maist not find fault with other mens actions.
                     Esay. 6.5. 
                  Woe is me, I am vndone (saith
  Esay) because I am a man of polluted lips. The Prophet had
  seene God in a Throne of great and wonderfull Maiestie, and hee would haue
  published and proclaimed the same to all the World, but hee sayth That he durst
  not presume to do it, because his lips were polluted. The Chaldae word is,
  Grauis ore, My lips are of too heauie a dulnesse for such high
  Misteries. The seuentie Interpreters render it, Vae mihi, doleo
  compunctus, My sinnes stop my mouth, when I consider myne owne life, I
  dare not question another mans. The Pharisee censured Marie Magdalen
  to be a Sinner, and our Sauiour Christ to be no Prophet; but our Sauiour
  set
                     •
                  ing before him a reconuention
  of many grieuous sinnes, he left him amased and ashamed. God tooke away the
  poore innocent babe which Dauid had by Beersheba, pretending
  therein (according to Theodoret) to burie this his sinne vnder ground,
  because he beeing appointed by God to punish Adultrers &amp; Murdrers, they
  might not tit him in the teeth &amp; say vnto him,
                     Rom. 3.5. 
                  And why doe you the like? Saint
  Paul askes the question, Is God then vniust? And he answers
  thereunto, God forbid, else, How shall God iudge the world? If thou
  shouldest aske a Phylosopher, Whither it were possible for God to sinne? He
  would answer, It is not possible, because he is Causa prima, &amp; norma
  vniuersalis, The prime cause, and vniuersall rule. But Saint
  Pauls answer is, That it is not possible that God should sinne,
  because he could not then conueniently gouerne the world. For he can hardly
  reforme sinne in another man, who had need to reforme what is amisse in
  himselfe. Three Kings did conspire against the king of Moab,4. Kings 3. they besieged his Citie, and he seeing
  himselfe in a desperate taking, tooke his eldest sonne that should haue
  raigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering vpon the wall.
  Cajetan saith, That this Sacrifice was not done to the God of Israell, as
  some haue imagined, but to those Idols which that King did worship; and that
  after this so cruell an act, there insued so great a plague in the Israelites
  Campe, that they were forced to raise the siege. Facta est indignatio magna
  in Israel. The Hebrew hath it, Ira magna: The Vulgar renders it,
  Israel was sore grieued, and departed from him, and returned to their
  Countrie; but the wrath of God entred into their Armie, for that they had
  sacrificed their sonnes &amp; daughters  to Deuils,
  according to that of Dauid, Sacrificauerunt filios &amp; filias suas
  daemonio. By whose example the King of Moab learned to offer this kind of
  sacrifice; and God was highly offended with them for it, and therefore would
  not suffer such as had playd the Idolaters in sacrificing their children, to
  take away the Kingdōs of other Idolaters, who perhaps were lesse faulty than
  themselues. Alexander layingit to a Pyrats charge, that with two ships
  he had robbed at sea; hee returned him this answere, Thou rob'st all the World,
  and no man sayes any thing vnto thee; and I, who to picke out a poore liuing,
  put foorth to sea but with two poore little barkes, must haue theft and pyracie
  layd to my charge. The like answere did a Bishop make to Pope Gregorie
  the second, when hee kept his Sea at Auignon, Who giuing him a shrewd checke,
  for that he did not reside in his Bishopricke; he told him, It is now full
  three score and ten yeares that the Popes Sea hath beene kept out of Rome, and
  your Holinesse now reprehends me for liuing but three dayes from my
  Bishopricke. To this purpose sutes that answere which Vriah gaue to
  King Dauid.
                  2. Reg. 11. This valiant
  Captaine tooke vp his lodging, and layd himselfe downe to sleepe in the porch
  of the Kings pallace: And the King asking him, why he did not goe home to inioy
  the ease and pleasure of his owne bed? He made him this answere, The Arke of
  God dwelleth in Tents, and my Lord Ioab Generall of your Army, and the
  seruants of my lord abide in the open fields; shall I then beeing but an
  ordinarie souldier, goe into my house to eate, and drinke, and lye with my
  wife? By thy life, and by the life of thy soule, I will not doe this thing.
  This was a seuere reprehension in Vriah, to his soueraigne. For if a
  subiect shall out of such honest respects refraine from going home to his owne
  house; much more ought the King to haue abstained from lying with another mans
  wife. Nor is that Historie of Iudas much amisse, who being Gouernor of
  the people, and finding Thamar great with child, would needs execute
  that law against her, of adulterous women; But Thamar proued, That he
  that was to iudge others, should not himselfe be a delinquent.
               Now wee come to the last reason of this our Sauiours sharpe and
  quicke answere vnto them. There were two Truths prophecied of our Sauiour
  Christ:
               The one, his Meekenesse and Gentlenesse. And of this,Christ
 as he was meeke in reproouing, so he was stout in reuenging. there are
  many prophecies.
               The other, The stoutnesse and courage wherewith he was to
  reuenge the wrongs and iniuries done to the poore. Saluos faciet filios
  pauperum &amp; humiliabit calumniatorem, He shall saue the children of the
  poore, and shall humble the slanderer. Saint Austen, Iustin
  Martyr, and many others, vnderstand this to be spoken litterally of Christ.
  For Calumniatorem, the Greeke reades Sycophantam. And so doe
  they call your Promooters and Informers. Whether it were, because in Athens
  they had a Law, that none should bring figges to that Citie to sell; Or whether
  it was forbidden in Greece, that any should enter to gather figs in another
  mans orchard; (Whence he that informed thereof, came to bee called a Sycophant)
  Or vpon that wittie conceit of Aesops, who, when a certaine seruant
  had eaten some figges▪ and layd the fault vpon one of his fellowes, gaue
  order, that both of them should drinke luke-warme water, and the eater of them,
  hauing vomited vp the figges▪ they called him Sycophant. Our Sauior then
  shal saue the poore, and humble the slanderer. Hee shall smite the earth
  with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lippes shall he slay the
  wicked.
                  
                     Esay. 11. 
                  Iraeneus
  expoundeth this place to be spoken of Gods protecting and defending of the
  poore. He is their tower of defence in the day of trouble, their hope in
  distresse, and their shield of comfort in their tribulation. And that God doth
  reuenge with greater seueritie, the  wrongs that are done
  to his friends, than those that are offered to himself, is a fauor so vsually
  with him, and so generally known, that I need not to insist therupon. One
  while, because hee thinkes himselfe much beholding vnto them, that they wil
  resigne vp their owne right, and leaue the cause of their wrongs to him; and
  that they will put their hope, and their trust in him. Sub vmbra alarum
  tuarum sperabo, donec transeat iniquitas, i. Calamitas. Defend
  mee ô Lord, whilest this storme passeth ouer my head. Another while, that
  he may shew more loue to his friends than to himselfe. In the old Law, hee gaue
  great proofes of this Truth; and in the new, hee gaue farre greater testimonies
  thereof. Esay drawes a comparison from the Lyon, who hauing his prey
  betweene his clawes, a companie of Sheapeheards come crying after him, making
  a great noyse and clamor, but he makes no great reckoning of it. And is all one
  with that saying of our Sauior, Non rapiet quisquam de manu mea, No man
  shall snatch them out of my hand. Abimelech tooke Abrahams wife
  from him, and God at midnight appearing vnto him, in the midst of his mirth and
  lust, he spake vnto him in a fearefull voice, E
                        •
                      morieris, Thou art but a dead
  king. The like befell Pharaoh. Procopias saith, That God did
  declare as much when he appeared in the firie bush. They did whippe his people
  with the rods of briars, and did burne them vp, by inforcing them to find straw
  for to heat the ouens wherein they were to bake their brickes; and God
  sayth,
                     De
                           •
                        t. 30. It is I that am whipped, it is I that am burned
  in the fire. Moses treating of this protection of God, takes his
  comparison from the Eagle, whose care and vigilancie in breeding vp of his
  young ones,Gods protecting of his children in the old Law,
 differing from that in the new. is exceeding great: but in the end,
  shews himselfe verie cruell to that young of his, whose eyes hee exposeth to
  the beames of the Sunne. All this loue and care, ran along with the written
  Law. But in that of Grace, giuing vs greater pledges of his loue, he drawes his
  comparison from the Hen, whose loue and care exceedes all other indeerings
  whatsoeuer.
                     Mat. 25. Shee scorneth and
  contemneth her owne life for the safegard of her chicken; she fasts, that they
  may feed; she is content to bee leane, that they may be fat; and now and then
  dyes that they may liue. Saint Austen hath obserued, that because the
  Deuill spake vnto Christ, That hee would make those stones bread for to releeue
  his owne hunger; he refused to doe it. But if it had bin to releeue thine, or
  mine, he would haue done it. As he turned the water into wine at the wedding,
  not for himselfe but for others. And at that meale in the mountaine, where he
  multiplied the loaues and the fishes, whereof himselfe did not eat a bit.
               
                  Why do ye also transgresse the Commandement of God. He
  wounds them with their own weapon, &amp; retorts the force of this their
  argument vpon themselues, and sends them away ashamed. He driues them to a
  demur, and puts them to ponder vpon this Vos custodias, Of the Law,

  that  they left not a man liuing, nor a house standing.
  Now his grandfather hauing vsed so great rigour in punishing of such a
  dishonestie, he of all other should not haue committed this sinne. For this
  reason the Angell vsed the like rigor with Moses, whither it were
  because he had not circumcised his children, or whither it were because he
  tooke his wife along with him in that his journy, or whither it were that he
  had manifested the cowardise &amp; feare that he had of Pharaoh; the
  Angell made semblance that hee would kill him: for hee that is a Lawgiuer, a

               And here two considerations offer themselues vnto vs:
               The one, That he that shall doe a wrong, shall bee paid in his
  owne coyne; that verie day that a man shall doe an iniurie by taking away the
  good name of his brother, he puts a taxe vpon his own reputation, seales the
  same, makes it his owne Act, and is bound to make repayment thereof: And this
  is a Quare &amp; vos, Why doe yee also, &amp;c. This is to throw
  stones against Heauen,God payes euery man in his owne

                  pit against
  the wind. Dauid cut off Goliah his head with his owne sword
  after that he had reuiled Gods people; Iacob with Esau's owne
  cloathes, stole away the blessing from him, by putting on his hands and his
  necke the skinne of a Kid: with this deceit he grieued both his father and his
  brother, but he was paid at length in his owne coyne: Iosephs brethren
  sell him, they dip his Coat in the bloud of a Kid; so the same tricke that he
  had put vpon another, was afterwards put vpon himselfe: Vzziah would
  needs play the Priest, and when hee was putting on that sane
  lamina,

  the High-Priests did vse in their pontificiall Ceremonies, behold, he was
  leaprous in his forehead: see how he was payd in his owne coyne, he had no
  sooner put it on his forehead, but he was punished in his forehead. King
  Ahab did bring home the grapes of Naboths Vineyard in
  Baskets; he is payd in his owne coyne, for the heads of his sonnes were
  likewise deliuered vp in baskets. A seruant of Alexander Seuerus

  by Saint Gregorie, That the great rich mans greatest sins lay in his
  tongue, and therfore he suffered more paine and torment in his tongue, than in
  any other part of his bodie. Saint Paul
                  ▪ Before he was conuerted,
  busied himselfe wholly in chaines, gyues, fetters, and imprisonments; hee went
  purposely to Damascus, with a full resolution not to leaue one man aliue; but
  he suffered afterwards in that wherein he had sinned, and was payd home in his
  owne coyne: for, as it appeareth in the Acts of the Apostles, he
  himselfe had beene imprisoned sixteene seuerall times, and as one that had
  beene set vp as a sea marke, to bid others beware of running the same course as
  he had done, he aduiseth, Ne quis circum

                     ait at the doore of my neighbour, Let my wife grind vnto another
  man, and let other men bow downe vpon her. It is miserie enough to be payd
  home in his owne coyne, and men for the most part when they haue returned wrong
  for wrong, rest reasonably well contented therewith; but with God, I must let
  thee know,  that the case is far otherwise; for it is
  vsual with him, to reueng wrongs seuenfold. The Prophet said to
  Dauid,
                  2. Reg. 12. 
                  Because thou
  hast taken the wife of Vriah to be thy wife, I will take thy wiues before thyne
  eyes, and giue them vnto thy Neighbour, and hee shall lie with thy wiues in the
  sight of this Sunne; thou tookest one wife from thy Neighbour, and thy
  Neighbour shall take many from thee. This was that which Dauid charged
  Saul withall, when hee marched ouer the mountaines with his People,
  persecuting him to the death, The King of Israell is come out to seeke a
  flea, as one would hunt a Partridge in the Mountaines:1. Reg 26. Why should the King my Lord be at so
  much paines and cost to take away my life from me, it is as if thou shouldst
  goe about to kil a flea, or take a Partridge. A great Lord goes a hawking with
  twentie Horse, and as many Spaniels, and I know not how many cast of Hawkes,
  hee returnes home at night with one poore partridge in his poutch, which is
  scarce, worth two Royals, the charge thereof comming to two hundred, and the
  tiring out of his bodie, to two thousand. Now if he should imploy all this in
  hunting after a Flea, farre greater were his follie. All the hurt you can doe
  me, is no more than the killing of a Flea; but the harme that you receiue
  thereby is exceeding great, as well in regard of the wasting of your Treasure,
  as in the toiling and trying out of your person.
               
                  Yee also transgresse the Commandements of God by your
  Traditions. The zeale of good is good;True zeale
 carries with it both lightning and thunder. but when men are zealous of
  the lesse, and neglectfull of the more, it is not zeale, but passion. When your
  lightning doth not accompanie your thunder, all is wind: there are some zealous
  Professors that are all thunder and no lightning; they make a great noyse with
  their words, the wind whereof growes high, but the light of their good workes
  doth not shine to the World. The Pharisees were a kind of
  Alharaquientos, men that would make a great deale of doe and pudder
  about nothing; they keepe a strange kind of coyle about the washing and not
  washing of the hands, a thing scarce worth the talking of; despising in the
  meane while the keeping or not keeping of Gods Commandements. A Stacke of
  straw is on fire, and a Princes Pallace full of infinite riches is all on a
  flame; thou runnest to saue the stacke of straw, not caring what becomes of
  the Pallace. Art thou more carefull of straw than of gold? The like (saith
  Saint Gregorie) hapneth in mens vices; Pilate tooke a great
  deale of care that Christs death might not be laid to his charge, and washing
  his hands, as if he had no hand in the businesse, sticks not to say, I am
  innocent, &amp;c. but made no reckoning of deliuering him ouer to the
  will and pleasure of the people. The Iewes held it to be a heinous sinne, to
  enter into the Praetorium or Iudgement Hall, Lest they should be
  defiled; but they accounted it no sinne at all, to nayle our Sauiour
  Christ to the Crosse, when they cryde, Sanguis eius super nos; they
  held it a grieuous sinne, that the bodies of those that were crucified, out of
  the obseruance to their Sabboth, should hang vpon the Crosse; but accounted it
  no sinne at all, to thrust a Speare into our Sauiours side after that he was
  dead, shewing in his death the loue they bare him in his life: they take no
  offence, that Christ calls them Hypocrites, false Prophets, and Transgressors
  of the Commandements of God; but when he tells them,Hypocrisie straines at a gnat, &amp; swallowes a Camell.
                  That which enters in at the mouth, defileth not the Man, this is that
  they are angrie at, and this is Tragarse el Camelo, y desalar el mosquito,
  To swallow a Camel, and straine at a Gnat, to see a moat in another mans
  eye, and not the beame that is in his owne: Like vnto that Whale which
  swallowed vp Ionus at a bit, his bodie and cloathes all at once, and
  deuoures Pilchers one by one; and this was the Pharisees fault. Origen
  obserueth, That the washing of the hands was now turned to superstition, for
  therein they placed a great part of their fouls 
  saluation. Who can chuse but laugh at these mens ignorance and blindnesse, that
  they should swallow and digest many other foule faults, and should here be so
  nice and daintie, as to quarrell with our Sauiour about his Disciples washing
  or not washing of their hands?
               
                  Your Traditions; (saith our Sauiour) because for
  couetousnesse of gaine they had introduced many; and amongst the rest, this of
  the frequent and often washing of the hands, Non manducant panem

  Sauiours owne Table▪ and at other places where now and then they were
  inuited, they euer behaued themselues in▪ a decent &amp; ciuil manner, as
  Petrus Chrysologus notes it vnto you; but they made little reckoning
  of this superstition, and of many others which the Pharasaicall auarice had
  brought in; as to denie sustenance to our Parents to sweare by the Temple, but
  not by the gold of, &amp;c. for, by making the gold more sacred, they presumed
  men would feare to filch any of it away▪ The Priests did purposely
  multiply Laws; for where there are many Laws, there are many transgressions,
  and where there are many transgressions, there are many gainfull commings in.

  people to pieces, and grinde the faces of the Poore. Vatablus renders
  it, Racemando spoliant; for by plucking off now a bunch, and then a
  bunch, they leaue not in all the Vineyard a Grape that is scarce worth the
  gleaning. Nicetas by these Exactors and Extortioners vnderstandeth
  the Priests; and saith, That as your couetous Misers, after they haue cutdowne
  their Corne and made it into great cocks, &amp; carried home their haruest,
  fall a raking &amp; a gleaning ouer and ouer againe, contrarie to the
  Leuiticall Law; so these men hauing deuoured the greater part of the Richer
  sort, they fall a raking of the poore, and take from them that little that they
  haue, by ordaining most vniust Lawes. The Sonnes of Ely the Scripture
  calls, the Sonnes of Belial; and farther sayth, That they did not know
  what did belong to the Priests Office, Nescientes Dominum, neque Officium
  Sacerdotum. Which Vatablus renders thus, Nescientes Domi

                   for they being to receiue the
  Offerings of the flesh sod, to the end that they might not pouder it vp, and
  keepe it to themselues, they brought in a new custome, That they should giue it

  otherwise doe what they list with it.
               The World was alwaies and will bee still the same;Many laws in a Commonwealth bring gaine to some, but losse to
 most. that which wee see the Scribes and Pharisees did then, the like
  course doe they now take (which gouern the Commonwealth) with your Vintners,
  your Victuallers, your Butchers, your Fruiterers, your Hearbe-wiues▪ and a
  world of other Trades, imposing manie Lawes vpon them, not so much for that
  they import the good gouernment of the Commonwealth, as for the priuate benefit
  and maintenance of your Clerkes of the Market, your Alguazils,
  Attornies, Promoters, and all the rest of that rabble, which liue vpon these
  fees of Hell: And the knauerie hereof is to be seene in this, that when these
  Officers meet with false weights, or water mixt with wine, &amp; the like, it
  is a wonder if they prohibit them to come any more to the Market, or to banish
  them the Country; but rather clapping a mulct vpon them, they continue them,
  and keepe them still a foot, as an Inheritance that brings them in profit, or
  as a Farme that affoords a set rent to their purses. You shal haue a Vintner
  brought a dozen times one after another into the court, 
  and as often fined, and yet be suffered still to sell wine;

  saith,Couetousnes the onely God, that cōmands the
 world. That Couetousnesse is the onely God that commands the World; and
  one while it incounters with a brother; another, with a father; and now and
  then with God, and is the onely Tyrant that doth most domineere ouer our
  soules. Saint Paul cured a certaine maid hauing a Spirit of
  Diuination, which gate her masters much vantage by diuining▪
                  
                     Acts 16.16. but now when her Masters saw that the
  hope of their gaine was gone; they caught hold of Paul, and bringing
  him, before the Magistrate they complained of him, That he troubled the Citie.
  For Couetousnesse is such a Deuill, that the Deuill himselfe cannot (though hee
  would) cast it out of doores, where it concernes a mans particular intere

  should cast this Deuill out, the partie possessed would complaine for the losse
  of his companie. In Andaluzia, out of meere couetousnesse they suffer their
  she-slaues euerie yeare to be got with child, that she may bring them a Turke
  or a Moore, (as others keepe Mares for breeders) that when they grow vp, and
  are able to worke for their liuing, they may bring them in dayly gaines, like
  horses that are hired out; albeit they lead therein a course of life contrarie
  to all both humane and diuine Lawes. But they suffer this Deuill to dwell in

  him that established the same. Euerie-foot the Prophets repeat, Haec dicit
  Dominus, Thus saith the Lord
                  ▪ it seeming vnto them, That there can be
  no contradicting of this Proclamation, no reason giuen against it. For, to
  acknowledge God to be infinitely wise, and to alledge reasons withall against
  that which he commandeth, is to make him ignorant. In Leuiticus God
  said,

  Amongst other his Robes and ornaments belonging to his place &amp; Calling,
  the high Priest had his Rationale Iudicij, &amp; his 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      auream; it was rayment of
  silke set with twelue stones, wherein were grauen the names of the twelue
  Tribes; and in the middest thereof certaine letters which spake thus, Vrim
  &amp; Thummim, Illumination and Perfection; which our Interpreter expounds
  to bee, Doctrine and Truth; in token that the Doctrine of the Law, which is the
  perfection of our vnderstanding, ought to bee grauen in the Priests brest, and
  communicated to the People. That same Zona aurea, or golden girdle,
  was that same Lamina or plate of gold, which beeing fastned to his
  Mitre, did serue as a frontlet to the Priests forehead: whereon was written
  Sanctum Domino; signifying therby, That that which the Priest ought
  more especially to haue before his eyes, is the holynesse and purenesse of our
  Lord God▪ To this end was directed that terrible thunder and lightning on
  the Mount, which strooke the people into such a feare, that they cryed out,
  Non loquatur nobis Domin

                     , Let

  and feareful a manner? That they might haue a respect to the Maiestie of God,
  and stand in  feare of his power, that they might the
  better incline their hearts to keepe his Lawes.
               The Sibarites, came to the Oracle of Delphos, to know how long
  their commonwealth should continue. Plato discoursing of a
  Commonwealth in general, in his Bookes de Republica hath put three
  signes or tokens of their duration and continuance.
               The one, That their Princes should not lie.
               The other, That the bad should not be more than the good.
               The third, That the goings out, should not bee more than the
  commings in. For, That the Princes should bee Lyers, the good few, and their
  expences excessiue, are in all Commonweales sad vigiles of their end. But the
  Oracle made answere, That that Commonwealth should so long last and continue,
  whilest Man was not more esteemed amongst them than God. Whereupon they were
  persuaded, that their Commonwealth should indure for euer: It not being able to
  sinke into their heads, that so great a monstrousnesse as this should once
  succeede in their State. But it af
                     •
                  erwards happened, that a delinquent fled for succour to the image
  of Pallas, &amp; the Gouernor willing his guard to lay hold on him,
  and to take him from thence, he shifted himselfe from the Goddesse, and clung
  close to the Statua of the Kings father, so that none of the Officers durst
  offer to touch him; and so that Kingdome was ouerthrowne. So this despising of
  Gods commandements, and the preferring of their owne Traditions, was the
  dissolution of the Iewish Synagogue.
               For, besides Apostolicall and Ecclesiastical Traditions,Traditions, how far forth to be regarded which carrie so
  great authoritie in the Church, treating generally of such Traditions, which
  are certaine antient Customes inherited from our fore-fathers; there are
  certaine other Traditions in the World annexed to particular States, which in
  their owne nature are things indifferent. As your courtesies and complements
  amongst Courtyers; The giuing of the right hand; And your Titles of Worship,
  Lordship, Excellencie, and the like. Such a great Lord cals for drinke, his
  seruant brings it, and deliuers it him vpon his knee. Thou sneezest, hee that
  is next vnto thee puts of his hat, not that that does hinder thy farther
  sneezing, but because it is a Tradition, and a receiued custome so to do.
  Others, are reduced to Sanctitie and Holinesse. A Clergie man goes in a graue
  habit: A Friar, in a patch't frocke; Thou respects him for this and holdest him
  the holier man, not that he is so, but because it is Tradition. The Dominicans,
  reckon lesse of those religious orders, that weare a hood of cloth; the
  Augustines, of those that weare one of Linsey-woolsie: not because it mattereth
  much, but because it is Tradition. But to put as much obseruance in these
  Traditions, as in the Lawes of God, is a despising of God. Irritum fecisti
  mandatum Dei,
                  Varietie of traditions. 
                  Thou
  makest the Commaundement of God of no effect. Of these Saint
  Austen sayth, That euery one should keepe that custome, that he finds
  shall make for the peace and quiet of the Church, as also of those wee conuerse
  withall. As much as in you lyeth, hauing peace with all men. Others
  there are, wherein the opinion of the world can doe more than the faith of God.
  Your great Lords will impawne their estate to maintaine a Tilting or a
  Tournying, or in making a Maske for to doe their Mistresse seruice; They will
  bee liberall and bountifull to a common Buffoon, or Iester, but will scarce
  giue a royall to the poore. And this is Tradition. Iulian the Apostata
  made a Proclamation, that no Christian should inioy your Militarie
  ornaments; and many tooke this for such an affront, that they who before
  would haue fried at the Stake for God, did denie him for worldly respects, and
  for the preseruing of  their honour. Gentlemen, not
  measuring their expences by their meanes, it so fals out, that oftentimes they
  want a royall to buy bread to put in their mouths, yet their vanitie so farre
  ouerswaies them, that they will not be without a coach, a lackey, a page, an
  old beldame, and a squire. They take vp commodities at deere rates, they run in
  debt, neuer thinke of paying it, and in the end are vtterly vndone; this also
  is Tradition. Your Captaines and Souldiers stand much vpon the Lawes of your
  Duell, and highly adore them; which beeing well examined, are the greatest
  &amp; absurdest fooleries man can imagine? The Lye, must haue the bastonadoe;
  the bastonado, drawing of bloud; and drawing of bloud, death, &amp;c. One shall
  strike thee with a cudgell, that shall breake thy shoulder-blade; And the
  Souldier will say, He had good hap that hee did not lame him with a cane. And
  this is Tradition. Your hucking Merchants, your cunning Tradesmen, &amp;
  generally all that buy and sell, vse to cog &amp; lye: It is not good, it
  is not good, sayes euery buyer, And this too is Tradition. Your
  Catch-poles, pole their prisoners;Tradition the Churches
 perdition. your Registers, register falsehoods; And this is Tradition.
  Saint Cyprian sayth, That the Churches perdition hath beene, that
  Christians are not contented with sinning through weakenesse, through
  ignorance, or through malice, but through opinion; whence it commeth to passe,
  that they seeke not excuses for their sinnes, but authoritie to maintaine
  them, thereby the better to perpetuate them. They that are condemned through
  error, are easily cured; but when they haue opinion in their fauour, and a
  generall consent, and are authorised by custome, they are such currant money
  that none refuses it, nor seekes to remedie the same. Insanientium
  multitudo (sayth Seneca) fit sanitatis protectio, The
  madnesse of many, doth priuiledge madnesse. This passeth in these foresayd
  Traditions. And so are they receiued of all, &amp;c. They sayd vnto
  Micheas, All the Prophets with one generall consent▪ prophecie good
  vnto the King. But how doe they deliuer this message well, if God doe
  reueale it to be ill? It is Tradition. But the Law of God, ought to bee the
  rule whereby wee are to leuell our actions, and the court wherein wee are to
  giue account of our doings. Tertullian sayth, That our Sauior
  Christ,Chist not called Custome, but Truth. was not
  called Custome, but Truth. Ego sum via, verit
                        ••
                     , &amp; vita, I am the way, the truth, and the
  life. And Custome must bee qualified by Veritie, and not by
  Antiquitie.
               
                  For God hath commaunded, saying, Honour thy Father and
  Mother, and he that doth the contrarie let him dye; But yee say, Though he
  honour not his Father or his Mother, he shall be free: Thus haue ye made the
  commandements of God of no authoritie by your Traditions. In this honouring of
  our Father and Mother, he likewise includes their maintainance, and that wee
  should not see them want. But ye say, That he that shall take from Father and
  Mother and giue it to the Temple, doth comply with the Law. Munus
  quodcunque ex me obtuler
                        •

                     , tibi proderit; It will profit
  thee, but it is better to giue it vnto God. Origen saith, That this
  errour did arise from another that was more antient. For when men were not
  willing to pay a debt, they did offer it to the Temple, and did notifie the
  same to the Creditor. Corban, id est, donum est, I haue giuen it to
  the Temple, and therefore thou art not to require it at my hands. This was a
  rauening kind of couetousnesse. God would haue bread set vpon his altar, to the
  end that he that was in necessitie might be releeued;Our
 offrings are no honor to God, when they harme another. which was
  Dauids case when he was hungrie and in want, and God tooke it well.
  But how can he take it well at thy hands, that thou shouldst take away the
  bread from thy hunger-starued Father, or from a poore needy soule, to offer it
  on the Altar? Athanasius reporteth another effect of couetousnes far
  more brutish and abhominable, who when hee  fled from
  Alexandria where he was Bishop, for feare of the Manichees and the Arrians,
  they exercised so many cruelties vpon the Catholickes, that treating them in a
  most inhuman and cruell manner, they condemned it to bee a sinne to succour the
  poore, and the streets being full of wretched and miserable people, no man
  durst looke vpon them, nor offer to releeue them, least they should be
  accounted sinners.
               
                  This people doth honour me with their lips, but their heart
  is farre from me. There are a certaine sort of Sinners that are boasting
  Sinners;Two sorts of sinners, the one shamle

                     ly bold. one will boast himselfe
  so farre to be thy friend, that there is not the sinne that hee will not doe to
  doe thee seruice; that he will slash this man, &amp; slay that man, &amp;
  sweare any thing that thou wilt haue him, though neuer so false: finding fault
  with such a one, That he is notworthie to be esteemed a friend, because thou
  canst not trust him with the murdering of such a man, the taking of such a
  purse, the robbing of such a house, nor with thy whoredomes nor adulteries, and
  the like. The Gentiles in the Primitiue Church did murmure against the
  Christians, saying, That they were an vnprofitable, impertinent, miserable, and
  nigardly kind of people; and the reason of it was, for that they would not eat
  with them till they vomited vp their meat as they sate at boord, nor drinke
  with them till they were ouertaken with wine. Tertullian makes an
  Apologie in their defence, and saith, That Christians, should not only be
  Christians but also to seem to be that which they are. S. Augustine
  confesseth in his Confessions, That the World in his time was growne so
  shamelesse and so impudent, that it was held a shame not to be shamelesse. To
  be a Sinner is bad, but to boast of sinne ten times worse.

  conscience was a verie Dung-mixen, they were faire without, but foule within.
  Saint Chrysostome compares them to a Sword that hath a rich scabberd,

                     Luke. 11. Here is a goodly faire shew, a
  beautifull appearance of sanctitie and holynesse; but vnlace these mens brests,
  and looke into their soules and consciences, and then shall you see them in
  their true colours. Your great Merchants haue many suits of goodly hangings,
  rich Cloathes of State, faire Canopies, and costly Bedsteads; but they haue
  their Brokers to sell them: besides, they haue great store of daintie delicate
  housholdstuffe, and other fine curiosities, as Rings, Iewels, and chaines, all
  choice ware; but they are none of their owne, and therefore cannot be said to
  be rich. In like sort, the Pharisees were the Merchants &amp; Brokers of this
  sanctitie and holinesse, they carried it about with them for to sel and to make
  their best profit of it; and for that the people were much affectioned to this
  outward asperousnesse and strict-seeming course of life, they held them for
  Saints descended from Heauen. In Leuiticus God commaunded, That there
  should be no Linseywoolsey, no weauing of Woollen and Linnen together, because
  the one being so course, &amp; the other so fine, it might be so curiously
  intermixt, and so cunningly carried in the workemanship, that it might prooue
  a cosening  and cheating kind of commoditie.

  with another inuention like vnto this; they clad themselues in old cloathes,
  put old clouted shooes vpon their feet, layd old sackes vpon their Asses
  backes, full of drie and moldie bread, brought along with them old Leather
  bottles, with here a patch, and there a patch, as if they had had some great
  long journey of it, and had come from some remote region, they themselues
  reporting that they dwelt a farre off, when as indeed they were neere
  Neighbours; with which sleight of theirs, Ioshuah giuing credit vnto
  them, was cosined. This deceit is to

                   oft (I feare me) put in practise; a bare foot, a patcht frocke, a
  wan cheek, a lowly looke, a wrying of the head, a lifting vp of the eyes and
  hands, a knee-submission, a beating of the brest, and a weake whining voice,
  spinning out a Yes verily, and euerie other word they deliuer, to it's ful
  length; sell vs this simulated sanctitie and counterfeited holynesse, for that
  of Heauen, being meerely an earthly inuention, and an hypocritical tricke,
                     Osee 7. of purpose to deceiue: it is (as
  Osee sayth of Ephraim) as a Cake on the hearth not turned, which is
  scortcht and burnt on the outside, but raw and dough-baked within. It is the
  inner part that God loues, it is the heart and soule of man that he likes best
  of; as for the outward carriage of the bodie, a theefe or a villaine can put
  himselfe into his true postures, and feigne and dissemble the businesse as well
  as the best of them all.
               Yet withall let me tell you, That God doth require of a
  Christian the semblance of a Christian, and that as he is a Christian, so he
  seeme to bee a Christian: for albeit the Root giues life vnto the Tree, yet if
  it haue neither leaues nor boughes, it is but an vnseemely sight. Modestia

  the Vulgar render it) be knowne to all men; for if it bee wholly
  hidden in the soule, it will hardly be perceiued. Saint Augustine
  expounding that place of Saint Mathew, Beware of false Prophets, which
  come vnto you in Sheepes cloathing, but inwardly are rauening Wolues;
  saith, It were fit that because the Wolfe puts on the Sheepes skinne, that the
  Sheepe should lay aside his owne skinne, and clap on that of the Wolfe. There
  were two Alters belonging to the Temple; the one without, which was of stone,
  wheron the beasts were offred; the other within, which was of gold, wheron
  Incense was offered. God was serued in them both; but in conclusion, the inward
  Alter was so farre preferred before the outward, that Philon saith,
  That one poore crumme of Incense offered from a tender heart, and a merciful
  soule, was of more worth than all the sacrifices that were offered without;
  Regard yee me not because I am blacke,

                  for the Sunne
  hath looked vpon me. Saint Bernard saith, That the Spouses
  despising of this outward beautie, did arise from that great esteeme wherein
  she held the inward brightnesse and resplendour of the soule, which is a fire
  which consumeth and burneth vp the beautie of the bodie. Dauid calls
  the Church one while the Kings daughter, another while the Kings Bride; but hee
  paints her richliest forth vnto vs in her soule. The Kings daughter is all
  glorious within: not despising also the beautie of the bodie; Cloathed
  in a Vesture of gold wrought all with needleworke, and set forth with
  diuers and sundrie colours verie beautifull to behold. The Bridegroome aduiseth
  his Spouse, That shee should weare her colours in her heart; and as if that
  were not sufficient enough, he wills her to weare them on her arme. Our Sauior
  Christ in his praying and other occasions,1. Cor.
 14. vsed these exterior acts. Saint Paul saith, I will pray
  with the Spirit, but I will pray with the vnderstanding also: There is
  the vse of your tongue set downe, If I pray with my tongue, the Spirit also
  praieth.
               
               So that God will haue the exercise of soule and bodie both
  together.
               
                  First, Because God being Creator of both,
  it is fit that hee should bee serued by both.
               Secondly, For mans satisfaction▪ For in regard that Man
  cannot see mans Faith, nor that pittie and compassion that he beareth in his
  bowells, it is requisite that he should manifest the same by some outward
  signes; for he can hardly shew himself religious towards God; who is
  irreligeous towards Man. And therfore it is said, With the heart we beleeue
  vnto Righteousnes, but with the mouth we confesse to Saluation.
               
               Occasion is offered to receiue the Sacraments, or a necessitie
  of giuing a testimonie of our Faith; here euery Christian is bound to manifest
  the same by outward signes.
               Thirdly, The sanctitie and holynesse of the Soule doth giue
  force and vertue to that of the bodie, and that of the bodie doth confirme and
  augment that of the Soule; the heart giues vigour and vertue to deuout eyes, to
  hands lifted vp, and to knees humbly kneeling on the ground. And these outward
  ceremonies doe strengthen, increase, and inflame the Spirit and inward
  deuotion. Saint Augustine saith, That God hath no need of these
  ceremonies for the better manifestation of our mind, but that Man hath need
  thereof for to kindle &amp; stir vp more zeale and feruour in himselfe, being
  that by them the hearts affection is the more set on fire. And Saint
  Cyprian, That by humbling our selues vpon our knees in the sight of
  God, we are not to endeauour to please and serue him onely with the thoughts
  and meditation of the soule, but also with the disposition of the bodie, and
  the voyce of the tongue. Dauid drawing neere to his end, a little
  before he died did much indeere this Doctrine to his sonne S

 Kings. 2. 
                  Haue a care that thou keepe the commandements of
  thy Lord thy God, and all the ceremonies belonging thereunto, as it is written
  in the Law of Moses; that thou maist prosper in all that thou doost, and in
  euerie thing whereunto thou turnest thee.
               
               
                  But their heart is farre off from me. The whole man,
  take him all together,Of the whole Man, God most desireth
 the heart, why. may make sweet musicke in Gods eares, (like vnto an
  Organ, which by different Keys makes different sounds) but God delights most in
  the musicke of the heart, for the lips, the feet, and the hands being capable
  of suffering violence, the heart is not subiect thereunto.
               The cleannesse of the heart ought to performe the exercise of
  all the vertues, but Fastings, Prayers, and Almesdeeds comming forth of a soule
  heart, like waters flowing from a foule conduit, corrupt those wholesome
  waters; Abhominatio est mihi, saith God by Esay, This is to
  put new patches into an old garment, and new wine into old stinking Vessells.
  Saint Augustines saith, That that which God principally forbids in the
  Decalogue, are the desires of the heart; whereunto the Schoolemen ad the
  exteriour act, though there is no wickednesse like to the inward wickednes: and
  if the outward be more punished, it is because of it's more hurt through it's
  ill example. The workes of Vertue are not all equall, yet al of them haue one
  ground &amp; foundation, which is the loue &amp; feare of God. Abraham
  was charitable, Dauid humble, Eliah zealous, Moses
  milde, Iob patient, Martha solicitous, &amp; Marie
  deuout; God must be paid in al these seueral coines. Let euerie man looke vnto
  the cleannesse of his owne soule▪ and let him exercise himselfe in that
  which he is able; crying out with the Psalmist, To thee will I confesse in
  the vprightnesse of my heart.
               
               It was a great goodnesse of Gods mercie towards vs, to place our
  felicitie and our good in a thing so proper vnto vs, that no man is able
  therein to hinder vs. If he had inioyned vs Fasting, wee might haue complained
  of our weakenesse;  if Almesdeeds, we might haue
  complained of our pouertie, and so haue excused our selues; but for the keeping
  cleane of our heart, and for to loue and feare our God, as none can
  
                     〈◊〉
                   vs thereof, so none ought to
  outstrip vs therein. For the expences of the Sanctuarie, neither might the Rich
  offer more, nor the Poore lesse; and this was a type and figure of the
  spiritual offering of our 
                     •
                  oules,
  wherein we are all equal &amp; alike: and that not without the great prouidence
  of Heauen, to the end that no man might haue cause to alledge an excuse. Hast
  thou trauelled abroad to plant Gods Religion amongst Infidels? No: Hast thou
  kept thy bodie vnder by disciplining thy selfe? No: Eatest thou flesh in Lent?
  Yes. For th
                     •
                  se things euerie one
  may alledge many excuses, but for the foulenesse of the heart, there is no
  excuse. We read in the Legend, That the Deuil met with Machari
                        •
                     s, and told him, I haue the odds
  of thee in a thousand things; thou fastest, and I neuer eat; thou watchest,
  and I neuer sleepe; thou sometimes takest paines, and I am neuer idle: yet thou
  hast one great aduantage of me, to wit, thou hast a cleane heart, and myne is
  full of rancor and malice, &amp;c.
               
                  To pray with the tongue only, no
                        •
                      pleasing to God.
                  This
  people honours me with their lips, but their heart is farre from me. This
  is an excellent Lesson for those that pray and sing in the Quire; that prayer
  which is onely with the tongue, God makes little reckoning of it. Saint
  Cyprian sayth, That the Church doth admonish the People▪ that at
  the time of diuine Seruice they should haue their hearts in Heauen, Sursum
  corda: And although their answer be, Habemus ad Dominum; yet
  many doe repeat it by rote, like Parats, without any kind of attention at all.
  Thou desirest of God, That hee would heare thee, when thou art so farre off
  from thy selfe, that thou doost not heare thy selfe, and wouldest haue him to
  be mindfull of thee, when (God knowes) thou doost not mind thy selfe. It is a
  wofull thing, that men should say Seruice as if they did not say it, and that
  they should pray as if they did not pray, and that they should sing as if they
  did not sing. The Lateran Councell saith, Studiosecelebrent, &amp; deuote
  quantum Deu
                        •
                      dederit: And they
  willed it so to be done, In virtute sanctae obedientiae. Saint
  Paul, Be fulfilled with the Spirit, speaking vnto your selues in Psalmes
  and Hymnes,
                  
                     Ephes. 5.

  Songs, singing and making melodie to the Lord in your hearts. Whereupon
  Saint Hierome saith, Audiant hi quibus psallen

                     i in ecclesia officium est, Let your
  singing men giue eare to that which they sing in the Church. And
  Gratian puts it in the Decretals: And the Glosse saith, Non
  clemens, sed amans, clamat in a

                     re
  Dei, It is not the loudnesse of the voyce, but the louingnesse of the heart
  that rings in Gods eare. In a word, The power of Prayer must come from the
  Soule. Saint Gregorie saith, That Abels Sacrifice was so well
  accepted of God, because hee had first offered the same in his heart; and that
  it was not so much esteemed for that it was of the best of his flockes, but for
  the deuotion wherewith he offered it vp: And Cains, out of a contrarie
  respect so sleightly regarded.
               
                  But in vaine they worship me, teaching for Doctrine mens
  Precepts. By these Precepts of men, he vnderstandeth those which are
  contrarie to the Lawes of God, as it is well noted by Irenaeus. And in
  those dayes there were verie many among them, as Thomas, Saint
  Hierome, and Epiphanius hath obserued. Saint Paul
  sayth as much, Improoue, rebuke, exhort, for the time will come when they will
  not suffer wholesome Doctrine, but hauing their eares itching, shall after
  their owne lusts get them a heape of Teachers, and shall turne their eares from
  the truth, and shall be giuen vnto Fables. Where Faith is indangered, there
  must wee not vse a soft and smooth hand. Now the Pharisees following Iewish
  Fables, and applying themselues to the precepts of men, did turne away from the
  truth, they  placed their holinesse in outward
  ceremonies, they receiued the offerings of stolne things; God abhorring nothing
  more. The Saduces did denie the immortalitie of the soule, the resurrection of
  the dead, finall judgement, reward, and punishment. The Galileans denied
  obedience to any saue to God. The Herodians did beleeue, that there was no
  other Messias but Herod. The Esseni, that men ought not to sacrifice
  in the Temple, nor sweare vpon necessitie, nor haue proprietie of goods. To all
  these our Sauiour sayth, They worship mee in vaine. They do but loose
  their labor in honoring me and in seruing me.
               
                  That which goeth into the mouth defileth not the man,
  &amp;c.
                  To the cleane all things are cleane.
  There is no meat in it's owne nature, that hurteth the soule. Saint
  Paul saith, To the cleane, all things are cleane; but to the
  vncleane, nothing is cleane. For, the sinne is not in the meat, but in the
  vse thereof, and when we ought to abstaine. God saw all that hee had
  made,

                  Out of the heart come euill thoughts. The heart in
  Scripture,What is vnderstood by the Heart. Rom. 1.
 Mat. 16. Deut. 4. Mat. 22. is sometimes
  taken for the Vnderstanding, Their foolish heart was full of
  darkenesse. Sometimes for the Will, Where is their treasure, there is
  their heart allso. Sometimes for the Memorie, Let not my words depart
  out of thy heart all the dayes of thy life. And sometimes for the soule,
  Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart. From a good
  soule, come good thoughts and good workes; and from an euill soule, euill
  thoughts and euil workes. As this fountaine is, so are the waters that flow
  from thence, either troubled, or cleere. And as to repaire a sicknesse, wee
  must haue recourse to it's cause; so all your Saints adresse themselues to the
  soule. Dauid desired of God, that he would giue him a new heart,
  fearing that the heart that now he had, would neuer leaue it's woonted trickes,
  but runne according to it's old byas. Create in me a cleane heart, ô
  God▪ and renew a right spirit within me.

  Cherubin, is there in the plurall, beeing set there to cowe Man, and to keepe
  him backe. So many Cherubims were not set there for Man onely, but for the
  Deuill, who had taken of the fruit of the tree of Life, and deliuered it vnto
  Man. But the Deuill is farre more greedie of the heart of Man, than of the tree
  of Life. And therefore we are to desire of God, that he will bee pleased to set
  a guard vpon it.
               
                  From the heart, comes Murders, Adulteries, Fornications,
  Thefts, false Testimonies, and Slanders. Here is a powerfull hellish
  squadron which assaults the heart. Saint Paul makes a larger muster of
  all these souldiers, These are the knowne workes of the flesh,
  dishonesties, filthinesse, vncleanenesse, fornications, adulteries,
  witchcrafts,The Heart hath many enem es all within it
 selfe. sorceries, enmities, contentions, emulations, angers, debates,
  dissentions, enuies, drunkennesse, and murder. There are no countries, regions,
  nor cities, (sayth Saint Chrysostome) that containe such a companie of
  enemies, and all of them conspiring against a poore miserable heart. What, so
  many rauening wolfes, against one silly sheepe? so many greyhounds let slip,
  against one cowardly hare? so many kites, against one single chicken? so many
  eagles, against one poore pigeon? so many vultures, so many harpies, so many
  fowles of rapine? and still the more, the more hard the prey is to bee got;
  What then shall that heart doe, which hath not wherewithall to defend it selfe.
  And the greater is our feare  (saith Origen) for
  that all this Armie of our enemies stands armed against vs euen within our owne
  doores. For sinne, is so farre foorth sinne, as it is voluntarie. For if our
  Will would but stand sentinell without, it were impossible for sinne to enter.
  So that the greatest enemie that wee haue, is our owne proper Will. And
  therefore our Sauiour sayth, That From the Heart, come murders,
  &amp;c.
               
               These are those spots wherewith mans soule is sullied; These the
  staines, wherewith he is defiled. For those things which man eateth, Non
  coinquinant hominem, do not defile man. By the Prophet Esay, God
  prophecied of the wretched ruine and miserable desolation of Babilon, and
  paints it forth so to the full, that there shall remaine no more reliques
  thereof than of Hierusalem: It shall be made (saith he) a dwelling for
  Hedge-hoggs, and a standing Poole of filthie stinking waters, and as a Citie
  that is vtterly ouerthrowne and destroyed: all shall be as heapes of earth and
  hollow bankes, wherein shall be bread all kind of creeping wormes, and
  vermine, and venimous creatures; all shall bee pits, wherein shall be puddles
  of water for to make an habitation for Toads, Snakes, Adders, and Serpents.
  This shall bee the wretched condition and miserable estate of this great
  Babylon. He farther addeth, That he will sweepe it with a broome; a
  place so foule and so sluttish, as well in respect of those heapes of earth and
  rubbish, as also those filthie pooles and stinking puddles of water, How is it
  possible that he should come to sweepe it and make it cleane? I will sweepe it
  cleane from it's sinnes. For all other kind of filthinesse whatsoeuer, in
  respect of the foulenesse of sinne,No fowlnes to that of
 sin▪
                   are nothing filthie. The Hedge-hog, the Adder, and the
  Serpent, in the holes of the earth, nor the poysonfull Toads in the puddles of
  water, are not able to debarre vs of entrance into Heauen: but he that is
  sullied in sin, and is not washt cleane with the bloud of our Sauiour Christ,
  let him neuer looke to come there. The Hedge-hog with all his prickles shall
  not hurt thee, nor the Adder wi
                     •
                  h
  his teeth, nor the Serpent with his sting, nor all the venimous Vermine in the
  World: The standing pooles and stinking puddles shall not soile thee; but the
  heaping vp of money, and thy keeping of it close in thy Chest, when the Poore
  are readie to starue for hunger, &amp; haue not a peny to buy them a loafe of
  bread; that is it shall soyle thee, and make thy soule all mud and filth. That
  foulenesse which shuts vs out from Heauen, is that of sinne, and nothing else
  but that. And therefore it is said in the Apocalyps, Nihil coinquinatum
  intrauit in regnum Coelorum, Nothing that is filthie shall enter into the
  Kingdome of Heauen. And therefore Saint Chrysostome aduiseth vs,
  That we should haue an eye vnto that which defileth vs, &amp; seeke to auoyd
  it. Which that we may so do, God giue vs the grace for his mercies sake,

                  When he was come into Symons House, his mother in Law

               OVr Sauiour Christ hauing throwne out that talking Deuill in
Capernaum, and inioyned him silence,Christ refuseth no
  house, where there is a will to entertaine him. Saint Luke
here recounteth his entring into Peters house; not into that which
Peter and Andrew had in Bethsaida, being Naturalls of that
Countrie; for neither that protinùs of the Euangelist, nor the
Sabboth, wherein they were to walke but a mile, will giue way thereunto. And
though Peter had not a house in Capernaum, yet his mother in Law might
haue had one there, or hee might haue bestowed one on her daughter in dower.
And albeit Peter had made a renunciation of the proprietie, yet might
he haue a reseruation of the vse therof, as he had of the Nets &amp; fishing
Rods. S. Marke saith, That he went into the house of Symon and
Andrew; whither it were because it belonged to them both, or whither or
no because it might haue been Peters fathers house, and the fathers
house we vse commonly to call it likewise the sonnes house. And though the
house was poore and meane, yet was it no such great wonder, that he who had
left the Pallaces of Heauen, and made choice to bee borne in so poore a thing
as Bethlem, should for one day make so mean a house his Inne, especially the
wil of the partie that entertained him, being so rich as it was to doe him
seruice.
            
               And Symons wiues mother. Saint Ambrose in his
booke De Viduis, reckons this mother in law of Peters amongst
many other that were most famoused and renowned in the world. And from this
name of Socrus, which signifies our wiues mother, or a mother in Law,
Tertullian and Saint Hierome doth inferre that Peter
was married; for Mother in Law signifieth, an affinitie deriued from marriage.
And howbeit it seemeth vnto Saint Hierome, That the wife of Saint
Peter was alreadie dead, yet Clemens Alexandrinus affirmeth
that she was aliue, and that she afterwards suffered martyrdome for maintaining
the Faith of our Sauiour Christ. But in fine, it is a plaine case that he had a
wife.
            
               Iesus rose vp and came out of the Synagogue, &amp;c. Our
Sauiour Christ diuided his whole life into these two stations:
            From the Synagogue to the Sicke;
            And from the Sicke to the Synagogue.
            Where (as Saint Luke reporteth it) he preached the
Law.
                  Acts 15.

               In Hierusalem (saith Genebrard)
there was a principall Temple, which had in it foure hundred and eighty
Synagogues, some more honourable than the other, and some lesse; and in all the
Cities of that Kingdome there was great store of them, which occasioned our
Sauiour to say, They affect the chiefe places in the Synagogues.
There, with a strange kind of silence did the people hearken vnto them, and it
was counted a great punishment, to depriue any Citisen of this so great a good.
In these Synagogues our Sauiour Christ spent the greatest part of his life, and
when he went out of them it was to cure the Sicke, or to relieue others
necessi
                  •
               ies. And though now a dayes
a Preacher comes sweating out of the Pulpit, and goes to a friends house where
hee hath warme Napkins clapt about his necke, and is much made of; yet our
Sauiour Christ goes here from Maries businesse to that of
Martha's, and from that againe of Martha, to that of
Maries; from the Synagogue to the house of Peter, because
Peters wiues mother was sick. Chrysologus saith, That it was
easie to bee seene, what was the motion that carried him along to
Peters house, Vtique non discumbendi voluptas, sed iacentis
infirmitas, Not so much for his owne ease, as to case the Sicke.
            
            
               He entred into Symons house, and Symons wiues mother,
&amp;c. Our Sauiour Christ had a great desire to cure her, and this good
Widdow had as great a care to welcome him and to serue him; and her Feuer did
more grieue her out of the hinderance of her seruice, than the cause of her
torment: And Christ on the other side, did accept of this inuitation more for
to recouer the Sicke, than to recreate hims
                  •
               lfe. The Sicke did desire more to giue him kind entertainment, for
to manifest her loue, than to receiue health for to mitigate her paine. Both
their desires rested well satisfied; that of Christ, in healing the Sicke; and
that of the Sicke, in seruing of Christ. And though the Angells might enuie
this her care, yet did she seeke to outstrip the Angels in her desire to serue
her Lord. Here may we see the practise of that which Ecclesiasticus
recommendeth vnto vs,
                  Eccl. 14. 
               Let

                   the portion of thy good desires
ouerpasse thee, giue and take, and sanctifie thy soule, &amp;c. Giue away
the goods of the earth, and thou shalt receiue those of Heauen: According to
that of S. Paule,
               2. Cor. 8.14.
               Let your aboundance supply their wants, that their aboundance may supplie
yours; for by this chopping and changing of pouertie for plentie, and of
plentie for pouertie, neither of both haue cause to complaine. That embleme of
Alciat is well knowne vnto you; A lame man and a blind man met bo
                  •
               h by chance at a riuer, the lame man
guided the blind man, and the blind man carried the lame man on his shoulders.
In like manner (saith Chrysostome) wee must succor one another; the
whole must cure the Sicke, and the Sicke must giue the whole louing and
friendly entertainment.

the great content that he takes in hospitalitie, especially towards the poore
&amp; the stranger. That thou shouldst lodge and feast a King, thou countest it
a great fortune and happinesse vnto thee, for honours, fauours, &amp; rewards
follow thereupon; but in entertaining the poore, thou doost him this kindnesse
for no other respect in the world, but because he is the Image of God.

Abraham
               ▪ who thinking he had entertained strangers in his house,
entertained Angels. And S. Austen and S. Gregory, Some men
(say they) thinking that they only feed the Poore, they are mistaken, for
therein they feast our Sauiour  himselfe.
Chrysologus saith, That in the brest of the Blessed it is not possible
there should be any desire or longing; but if it were possible to haue any,
sure it would be that of relieuing the poore. The Sonne of God hath not a
pillow whereon to leane his head. Why did Christ take pleasure in such a
strange kind of pouerty? Because thou shouldest take pleasure in giuing him
entertainment. When Abraham went forth to meet the three men from out
his Tent, bowing himself down to the ground before him who he thought was the
chiefest among them, he said, Lord, if I haue now found fauour in thy
sight, goe not I pray thee from thy seruant;
                  Gen. 18. let a little water I pray you be brought
and wash your feet, and rest your selues vnder the shaddow of this Tree, and I
will bring a morcell of bread that you may comfort your hearts, afterward yee
shal goe your wayes. They accepted of his kindnesse, and thanked the good old
man; but he vsing none of these courtly complements, in his plaine countrie
fashion assured them that they were heartily welcome, and that hee thought
himselfe beholding vnto them, that they would take such as they found.
Abraham he runnes me to the beasts, &amp; takes me a tender and good
Calfe, kills it, giues it to his seruant, who hasted to make it readie; then he
hies him in to Sarah, &amp; wils her presently to make readie at once
three measures of fine meale, to knead it quickely, and make Cakes vpon the
hearth. The cloath is now layd, bread, butter, milke, and the Calfe which hee
had prepared, is set before them; they fall too, &amp; Abraham he in
the mean while stands by, and waits vpon them. When they had eaten, they tooke
their leaue and went on their way, and hee likewise went with them to bring
them on the way. This vertue Lot had learned from him: Saint
Paul commends him highly for it: And Peter stiles him, Iust,
He was righteous both in seeing and hearing. Chrysost.
               2. Peter. 2. saith, That he staid waiting for
these strangers in the street, &amp; at the gates of the Citie, till it was
late in the night, that they might not light into the vncleanly conuersation of
these wicked Citisens. So that it was late ere hee met with these Angels and
adoring them as Abraham had done before, he said vnto them, My
Lords, I pray you turne in now into your seruants house:
                  Gen. 19. And the Angells making shew that they
would abide in the Street all night, hee pressed vpon them earnestly, and in a
manner pulled them in by force; Coegit illos, Hee was wonderfull instant
vpon them. This inforced courtesie of his, they afterwards fully requited,
by notifying vnto him, How that Sodome was to bee destroyed with fire from
Heauen. And although the Angells made hast to be gone, and to haue Lot
to get him packing out of the Citie; yet they deferred the punishment a while,
that he might haue time to warne his sonnes in Law to bee gone. Lot
thereupon went out and spake vnto his sonnes in Law which had married his
daughters, &amp; sayd, Arise, get you out of this place, for the Lord will
destroy the Citie; but he seemed vnto his sonnes in Law as though he had
mocked. Then the Angels hasted Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife and
thy two daughters which are here, left thou be destroyed in the punishment of
the Citie. And as hee prolonged the time, the Angels caught both him and his
wife, and his two daughters, by the hands, and brought him as it were forth by
force, and set him without the Citie; so he was saued, and the rest were
burned. In this vertue of Hospitalitie there are manie famous women much
renowned in the Old Testament; as the Shunamite that entertained
Elisha, and the widdow that harboured Elias; Rahab who
receiued the Spies that were sent to Ierico: All of them being so happie in
this their hospitality, that it seemeth God sent them such good guests, more
for the good of those that gaue them this friendly entertainement, than that of
those who were entertained by them. And if a man shall pay so well for his
Lodging,  how much more will God requite it?
            
               Symons wiues mother was taken with a great Feuer. Many of
the Saints haue beene at a stand, immagining with themselues, That being there
is so great a difference betweene the Old Law and the New, betweene God and
God, a God of Vengeance and a God of Mercie, betweene a Lyon and a Lambe; that
Christs friends should haue had a priuiledge, and that scarce a house of theirs
should haue knowne what sickenesse, danger, or death had meant. In the Floud,
Noahs house was preserued; in the flames of Sodome, that of
Lot; and in that generall massacre of the First-borne of Aegypt, the
houses of the Hebrewes were vntoucht:
                  Ezec
                        •
                     . 9 4. And God sending the
man cloathed with Linnen, which had the writers Inkehorne by his side, to take
notice of the people of Hierusalem, hee commanded them to set a marke vpon the
forehead of his friends, that hee might ouerskip them, and not touch them in
the day of destruction. But here now, a friends house is not priuiledged, no
not the house of Peter. What should be the reason of it? There are
many; but the main reason is this, With God, tribulation was euermore a greater
token of his loue &amp; fauor, than prosperity: what said Iob when he
sate scraping his sores vpon the Dunghill? In my prosperitie I onely heard
thee; but now in my affliction I see thee. S. Chrysostome saith,
That Cain in killing Abel, thought that Heauen would doe him
those fauours which it did his brother; but he was deceiued, for God did better
loue a dead Abel, than a liuing Cain; Non extraxisti, sed
incendisti. Philon saith, That the fire in the bush was so far from
consuming or burning it, that it left it fresher and greener than it was
before. But for all this, our miseries in the Old Law were neuer seene to be so
honourable as afterwards, when God had clapt the thornes (which were the fruit
of our sinnes) vpon his owne head,The thornes of Christ are
  the triumph of our troub
                     ••
                  s
then did they recouer so high a Being, and grew to that worth, that the heauier
God layes his hand vpon vs, the more is his loue toward vs. The marke of our
happinesse is the Sonne of God, not glorified, but scourged, spit vpon,
crowned with thorns, torne with whips, and nailed to the Crosse; and therefore
to bee conformed to the Image of his Sonne, is fitting for vs. In the
Apocalyps,
               
                  Apoc. 1.15. his feet are
put into a hot firie Ouen. This was a ritratto or picture of his many
troubles: and though this Ouen or firie Furnace speake them much; yet sure they
were farre greater, and beyond the tongues expression. The Angells did scatter
the coles of Gods wrath abroad in the World, sometimes lighting in one place,
and sometimes in another; but whose coles could bee hotter than his, whose
feet, like vnto fine Brasse, lay burning as in a Furnace?
            
               She was taken with a great Feuer. The Euangelist heere
amendeth our vsuall manner of speech:Prosperitie the soules
  bane. for with vs it is commonly said, Tengo grandes calenturas, I
haue a great Feuer, whenas indeed the Feuer hath thee. God often afflicts
the soule in the sence, that the soule thereby may be made sencible. God, like
the Bridegroome to the Spouse, speakes a thousand sweet words to the Soule, hee
courts her &amp; wooes her with an Aperi mihi, soror mea, &amp;c. Open to
me, my sister, &amp;c. but this makes her the more to shut the doore
against him. The Soule when it is in prosperitie, growes proud, it is deafe,
and will not heare; she must bee wrought vpon inter angustias, she
must feele the rod before she will haue any feeling. Ionas in the
Whales bellie,God is seldome thought vpon but in our
  miserie. the Prodigall in the pig-stie, the Sicke in his Feuer, thinks
and calls vpon God: we listen vnto the Deuill when wee are in the middest of
our Feasts▪ our Banquets, our Maskings, our sports and pastimes; but onely
hearken vnto God inter angustias, when we are afflicted and in
miserie. God being will
                  •
               ng to
cure those that were stung with the Serpents, made a Serpent of brasse, and
caused it to be set vp, that by looking theron they might be healed.
Gregorie  Nissen askes the question, Whither it
had not beene a shorter cut, and a more speedie and effectuall remedie, to haue
made an end of all these Serpents at once? But he answers thereunto, If he
should haue freed them from those Serpents, Which of them would haue lifted vp
his eyes to Heauen? And therefore let those Serpents continue still, and those
wounds of the bodie, seeing they cure those of the Soule. According to that of
Salomon,
               
                  Prou. 20. 
               The blewnesse
of the wound serueth to purge the euill. Saint Gregorie the Pope
saith, That the wound of the Soule is taken away by making another wound of
repentance and true sorrow. Euthymius citeth to this purpose that
verse of Dauid, Qui dat niuem sicut lanam, Snow to the earth is as
wooll, because it keepes it warme, and giues heat therevnto, for to bring
forth floures and fruits wherwith to glad the Spring and beautifie the Sommer:
An̄o de nieues, an̄o de bienes, (saith the Spanish Prouerbe) A yere of
snow, a yeare of ioy. The snow of sickenesse and of affliction, in stead of
cooling the Soule, it giues it heat and fruitfulnesse, that it may bring forth
floures and fruits of good life.
            
               She was taken with a great Feauer. The Phisitions call a
Calenture or burning Feuer, Calorem extraordinarium, An extraordinarie
heat, or calidam intemperiem, a hot distemperature, which being
kindled in the heart, and taking fire, disperseth it selfe through all the
parts of the bodie, catcheth hold of them, offends them, and discomposeth that
harmonie of the humors, wherein our health consisteth. Saint Isidore
deriues it from Feruor, or that hast and speed wherewith it runneth
and disperseth it selfe through our bodies. Valerius Maximus sayth,
That in antient time they did offer sacrifice thereunto, as to a Goddesse,
because of all other sicknesses, a Feuer is that which commonly comes to make
an end of our liues. For as heat well tempered giues life; so beeing
distempered it brings death. But if we shall goe philosophising from the
infirmities of the bodie, by way of analogie, or proportioning them to the
soule; Loue to the soule, is as Heat to the bodie. And when it doth not exceede
the Laws of God, which is the life of our soule, it inioyes perfect health; but
when it growes once to an excesse, it falls into a Calenture, or burning Feuer.
And this excesse succeedeth two maner of wayes.
            Either by louing that more, which ought to be loued lesse.
            Or by not louing that enough, which ought to be loued most.
            The Spouse sayd of her Bridgroome, Ordinauit in me
charitatem,
               
                  Cant. 2.4. Two things cause a feuer
  in the soule. He showed his Loue vnto mee, He made exceeding much of
mee, He brought me into the wine celler, and Loue was his banner ouer me: He
stayd me with flaggons, and comforted me with apples, when I was sicke of Loue:
His left hand was vnder my head, and his right hand did embrace mee.
Extraordinarie was this Loue of the Bridegroome to his Spouse, preferring her
before all other things whatsoeuer. God likewise beeing the greatest in Nature
and Essence, ought to bee the greatest in our Loue and Affection.How God ought to be loued. Next vnder God enter those goods
of Heauen &amp; of Earth. And Good, being the marke whereat our Loue shoots,
our greatest Loue should direct it selfe to the greatest good. And this is to
obserue an order and good temper in our Loue. Now touching the disorder of our
Loue, our Sauiour sayd, Hee that loues Father or Mother more than mee, is
not worthie of mee.
            
            Againe, In not louing God, to whom wee owe so much loue, this
excesse in the contrarie may turne to immodestie and impudencie; And make vs
breake out with those Cast-awayes in Iob, into these desperate termes,
Get thee farre from v
                     •
                  , we will
haue no knowledge of thy wayes.
            
            
               Besides, In imploying our loue so wholely
vpon the Creatures, we may chance to choake that loue which we owe to the
Creator. Saint Austen expounding that place of Iohn, Loue not the
World, neither the things that are in the world, saith, That our heart is
like vnto a vessell,1. Iohn. 2. which if it
be filled full with the World, it cannot receiue God; beeing like to that peece
of ground, where the Tares did choake the Wheate: So that of force wee must
emptie the vessell, and weede well the ground of our hearts, that the loue of
God may fructifie in vs. This inordinate loue doth set the heart, like a
Calenture, on fire. From the heart come all our euill thoughts,
               
                  Mat. 25. and goe festring through the faculties of
the soule. And 
                     •
                  inne, when it
is finished, bringeth foorth death, saith Saint Iames.
            
            
               She was taken with a great Feuer. As there are diuers
kinds of Feuers, so haue they a correspondencie with the diuers infirmities of
the soule; your young men are soone rid of their Feuers, especially if their
fits bee not violent: but an old woman that is taken with a great Feuer, wil
hardly recouer her health. A prisoner will easily shake off slight and slender
shakles, but those that are double chained and double bolted, he will hardly
free himselfe from them. One single stick is easily broken; but more beeing
bound together, verie hardly. A threefold cord is hardly broken. The
like reason may be giuen of old sinnes, vpon which, custome hath drawne a
necessitie. Saint Austen treating of the State of his owne sinnes,
sayth, That he was fast fettered with three strong chaines:
            The one, of his owne Will.
            The other, of an ill Custome that he had gotten.
            The third, of a kind of necessitie, which did keepe him as it were
by force in this so hard and cruell slauerie, Tenebat me, dura
seruitus.
            
            
               They besought him for her. The motiues of this
intercession, were:
            
               Pittie hath alwaies a prayer in readinesse for
  those that neede it.First, For that this good old woman, was of so sweet
a disposition, and so louing a nature: Which was much in so old a woman; and
no small matter, considering shee was a Mother in Law. It may be, Mothers in
lawe in those dayes, were more louing, and better beloued than they are now.
And one great argument thereof is, That our Sauiour Christ should put the loue
of the Mother in law and Daughter in law, in one and the same degree with that
of the Children &amp; Parents, as it appeareth in that place of S. Mathew.
I came to set a man at variance against his Father,
               
                  Mat. 10. 
               &amp; the Daughter against her
Mother, and the Daughter in law against her Mother in law. Where you see
he links them together all in one chaine. And so it ought to be: For, if the
Husband and the Wife, by Matrimony remaine one flesh; the Daughter in law ought
likwise to be so with the Mother in law, though not in the selfe same degree,
wholly and altogether.
            The second motiue, was the intreatie of the Apostles, who (as
Saint Marke maketh mention) interceded for her. And such pittifull
hearts, and tender bowels as theirs were, beeing sought vnto by so good an
Hostesse, who desired so much as she did, to serue them, could not chuse but
take pittie of her, and speake a good word for her. Besides, the miserable
paine she was in might haue moued the hardest heart to compassion, much more
theirs, whose eyes had seene in what an ill taking she was in. And kind hearts
are soone sencible of those sorrowes which the eyes shall impart vnto them.
            
               Two things required, that our intercession may
  be ef
                  
                     ••
                  ctuall.
               They b
                     •
                  sought him for her. In the
intercession of Holy men, God attends two things;
            The one, That we persuade our selues that they are preuailent with
God, and that they can effect much with his diuine Maiestie.
            The other, That he is well pleased that we should make vse of
them, for the  honour that hee receiues thereby, &amp;
the good that we reape by it. A King is well pleased that men should haue
recourse to his Fauorit, the more to honor him. It was a great honour to Christ
(saith Gregory Nazianzen) that he was the Mediator betwixt God and
Man. Saint Cyril giues the same attribute to the Apostles; and
Deutronomie, to Moses, Medius fui inter Deum &amp; vos,
               
                  Deut. 5. 
               I stood betweene the Lord and
you. But here is the difference, That the Saints haue need that others
should intercede for them, but our Sauiour hath no such need, sed accedit
per teipsum, ad interpellandum pro nobis. Al other Mediators are through
our Sauior Christ; &amp; that prayer which hath not this mediation, Saint
Augustine saith, That in stead of remoouing sinne, it reneweth sinne.
And Saint Ambrose, That Christ ought to be the Mouth by which we are
to speake, the Eyes by which wee are to looke, and the Hands by which wee are
to offer. In a word, The Saints of God are verie powerful with God, through
Christ our Lord. And therefore it is said, Whatsoeuer yee shall aske the
Father in my name shall be granted vnto you.
            
            Some make a doubt, Whither this be to be vnderstood of the Saints
that are liuing, or those that are dead? That it is meant of the liuing, there
are many proofes thereof in Scripture. To Iobs friends God said,
Goe to my seruant Iob,
               
                  Iob 42.
  Gen. 20. 
               and my seruant Iob shall pray for you; for I will
accept him, &amp;c. Abimilecke hauing taken away Sarah, and God
threatning him with death, and the King pleading ignorance in his excuse; God
said vnto him, Giue Abraham his wife againe, and he shall pray for thee,
and thou shalt liue.
               
                  Exod. 32.
               Moses by his intercession procured the pardon of sixe hundred thousand
persons. The People said vnto Samuel,
               1.
  Reg. 7. 
               Doe not thou cease to pray for vs. Saint
Stephen prayed for those that stoned him to death; And by his prayer
(saith Saint Augustine) Paul was reduced to the Church. In
the Ship, the same Apostle by prayer, preserued the liues of two hundred
seuenty six persons. Saint Basil cites that place of
Dauid,
               
                  Psal. 34. 
               The eyes of the
Lord are vpon the Righteous, &amp; his eares are open vnto their crie.
Those two sonnes which Ioseph had in Aegypt, Ephraim and
Manasses, the one signifying forgetfulnesse, the other Prosperitie,
Iacob adopted them for his owne, Sicut Reuben &amp; Simeon
reputabuntur mihi. Rupertus askes the question, Why Iacob hauing
so many sonnes, would adopt these two of Ioseph rather than the rest?
And he answereth it thus, that Iosephs forgetting of his former
troubles, and the prosperitie which he now enioyed, was procured by the prayers
and teares of Iacob.
            
            
               He stood ouer her and rebuked the Feuer. Our Sauiour vsed
this ceremonie,Vaine-glorie euermore to be auoyded.
saith Saint Chrysostome, the better to couer and dissemble the
miracle, to the end that he might not as then make his Diuinitie so manifest
vnto them. And as your Physitians are woont stedily to behold the colour and
complexion of the Sicke, looke on his tongue, and feele his pulse; so in a
manner our Sauiour Christ vsed the like kind of ceremonies, hauing a vigilant
eye ouer those that are soule-sick, and what course is to be taken for the
curing of a penitent Sinner, and to know how to distinguish betwixt leaprosie
and leaprosie. Many of the Saints did, the better to dissemble their miracles,
vse ceremonies, though there was no necessitie of them, nor were essentiall
for that businesse: so the Apostles by laying their hands on the Sicke did
heale them.
            Secondly, Saint Mathew saith, Tetigit manum
eius, The touch of the hand was enough to cure the sick: for the flesh of
our Sauior Christ, for that it was the flesh of God, gaue life and health to
all that toucht it, Virtus de illo exibat &amp; sanabat omnes, A certaine
vertue went out from him and cured all men. Our Flesh will infect other
flesh with it's sickenesse, but health and life was a priuiledge appertaining
onely to our Sauiour Christs flesh, which (as it is noted by Saint
Augustine 
                and Saint Cyril) by the
vnion with the Diuinitie did quicken and giue life. Spiritus est qui
viuificat, caro autem non prodest quidquam, It is the Spirit that
quickneth, as for the Flesh, it profiteth nothing: as an yron being heated doth
burne by it's vnion with the fire; so the Flesh of our Sauiour Christ, &amp;c.
And from this diuine Flesh, the vertue thereof did extend it selfe to his
verie cloathes. Si tetigero tātum fimbriam vestimenti eius,
saluaero, said the woman that was troubled with the bloudie Flux, If I can
but come to touch the hemme of his garment I shall be whole.
                  Malach. 4. 
               Malachie prophecied thereof in
these words, Sanitas in pennis eius, Health shall be vnder his wings;
and as feathers are to birds, so to man are his cloathes.
            Thirdly, When a sicke bodie is growne so weake that he can scarce
put forth his voyce, the Physition leanes downe his head the better to heare
him: and when he is so weake that he cannot rise of himselfe, the Physition
lends him his hand, Apprehensa manu eius (saith Saint Marke)
curauit eam. This burning Feuer had brought this good old woman so
low, that Christ did bow downe his head to hearken vnto her, and tooke her by
the hand to helpe her vp. Nor was it much that our Sauiour Christ should raise
those that were fallen, for that hee came into the world for this end, and had
so great a desire thereunto, that hee was willing to fall himselfe, for the
raising vp of vs. Nay, it was a Precept of old, That if a Beast should take a
fall, a man should not goe on vpon his way till he had holpe him vp. This
desire of his is much indeered by the Prophets; He bowed the Heauens and
came downe, he got vpon the Cherubins and flew, saith Dauid. And
in another place, Stretch forth thine hand from on high, and deliuer me out
of manie waters. The Sinner being almost drowned in the mud of his
sinnes, cries out vnto God to lend him his hand to get him out; but hee weighed
so heauie, that he pulled God after him.
                  Zach.
  9. 
               Zacharie saith, Thou also through the bloud of thy
Couenant hast loosed thy prisoners out of the pit, &amp;c. Where wee are
to weigh this same, Thou also; for though thou wert so great and
powerfull a God, yet it cost thee the best bloud in thy veines, to take those
out of the pit that were fallen thereinto.
            
               Man for disobedience shal be condemned by the
  creatures.
               He rebuked the Feuer and it left her. He spake the
word, and the Feuer obeyed; he commanded it to be gone, and it was gone in an
instant. Origen saith, That one of the foulest and shamefullest things
that the Creatures shall lay to Mans charge at the day of Iudgement, is, That
all other creatures from the creation of the World hauing beene obedient to
Gods Empire, without digressing in the least point or tittle, onely Man hath
beene inobedient, impudent, &amp; shamelesse. This is the generall opinion: but
to reduce this to our present purpose, and to shew how obedient this Feuer was,
we know that God vseth his Creatures as so many whips and scourges.
            One while he makes vse of those that are without life, as of
waters &amp; darkenesse,No creature but is pliable to the
  will of God. in those plagues of Aegypt, &amp;c.
            Another while, of those that haue life, as the Serpents of the
Wildernes, the Lyons which in Samaria slew the Assyrians, the Beares which
killed the little children which mockt Elisha, &amp;c. All do mooue
and obey at the becke of Gods brow, at the cast of his eyes, as the second
causes at the motion of the Primum mobile. The like succeedeth in the
Angells; nor is it much, considering the great good which they enioy. But which
is more, it succeedeth so in the Deuills, who tugge at the Oare in Hells
Galley. Our Sauiour Christ commanded some Deuills, That they should not speake
a word, nor offer so much as to open their lips, when their hearts were readie
to burst because they might not speake  their mind. But
it is a lamentable case, that one man should serue to punish another man, and
be made the instrument of his hurt, or become his Hangman. Pilat
commanded the Roman Souldiers to whip Christ; and they might haue bin excused,
had they not exceeded their Commission. It was decreed in Heauen, &amp;
foretold by the Prophets, That he was to be whipt; but the justice of God
contenting it self with a few stripes, these bloudy villains gaue him 5000.
&amp; but that his houre was not yet come, they would if it had been poss
                  •
               ible haue whipt him to death. A common
Hangman dare not exceed the order of the Iudge; but Man, when God makes him the
Executioner of his wrath, breakes the bounds of his Commission, and runnes
ryot. Man beeing set on by God, is like a Mastiffe that is set on by his
Master, who is easily put on vpon Bull or Beare, but hardly taken off.
Esay saith, That God made Zenacharib the rod of his
wrath,
                  Esay 10. and the staffe of his
indignation; and that he commanded him to take the spoyle, and to take the
prey, and to tread them vnder feet, like the mire in the street; but exceeding
his Commission (Gods purpose being onely to humble his Children, and bring them
to repentance) he afterwards scourged him soundly for it. Iudignatio mea in
manu tua; God had put this chastisement into the hands of a tyrant (as his
instrument) who had not the wit to carrie himselfe accordingly, &amp; therefore
he punished him according to his desarts.
            
               He rebuked the Feuer and it left her. Saint
Augustine deliuereth some mens opinions, who affirme, That things
without life, as Sickenesse, Pestilence, &amp; Famine, were occasioned by
euill Angells, one while for our good, another while for our hurt; but alwayes
for the seruice of God, and to shew themselues obedient to his Empire. And
this is the true sence and meaning of Imperauit febri, He rebuked the
Feuer; and of Vocauit famem, He called a Famine.
               
                  Psal. 10
                     •
                  . Not that a Feuer or Famine haue any eares to heare or
vnderstand any thing, but because the Angell to whom the power is committed,
doth heare and obey his will.
            In this Article there are two manifest truths.
            The one, That the Angells, as well good as bad, are many times
ministers of our punishments, by famine, pestilence, barrennesse, tempests,
sicknesse, &amp; death. And this truth is made good by innumerable stories in
Scripture; as in that of Iob, whose Corne the Deuill destroyed, threw
downe his Houses, carried away his Cattell, and killed his Children; That of
Sarah, who had seuen husbands slaine by Asmodeus the Deuill;
Those plagues of Aegypt, whereof (saith Dauid) the Deuills were the
Instruments; He cast vpon them the fiercenesse of his anger, indignation,
and wrath, and vexation, by the sending out of euill Angells,
               
                  Psal. 78.49. where God makes them his Hangmen or
Executioners. And in another place, Fire and haile, snow and vapours,
stormie winds, which execute his Word, &amp;c.
               
                  Psal. 148. Of good Angels there are likewise many
stories; as that of those that came to Sodom; and that of the Angell that slew
the souldiers of Zenacherib.
            
            The other, That to haue things without life to be obedient to the
Empire of our Sauiour Christ,Euen things without sence are
  obedient vnto God. there is no such necessitie that they should bee
mooued and gouerned by Angels, either good or bad, as Saint Hierome
and Saint Augustine haue both obserued. For albeit towards vs, and in
themselues they are insencible, yet towards God they are not so, He calls
the things that are not, as if they were. Nor is it any thing strange,
that the Heauens or the Earth should haue eares, or that those things should
answer and obey at Gods call, whose end is Gods glorie: the waters at Gods
command gather themselues into heapes, and when he sayes but the word, they
againe withdraw themselues: he prescribes bounds to the Sea, [Hitherto
shalt thou come, and no further:] at his Word againe,
                  Psal. 106. the Sea is  made
drie land: he layes his command vpon the fire to giue light, but not burn,
curbing this his actiue qualitie, as it did in the

                  •
               irie Furnace, when the childeren
came forth vntoucht. At this Word the waters gushed out of the hard Rocke; the
Winds are at his command; death and life, sicknesse and health, and al things
else whatsoeuer, doe truly and punctually obey his will; and so in this place,
he had no sooner said the word, But her Feuer left her.
            
            
               And rising vp, she presently ministred vnto them. In
regard that shee was an old woman she might verie well haue excused her selfe
from doing this seruice, but her health was so perfect, her recouerie so sound,
and her strength so increased, that without further tarriance, She
presently ministred vnto them. Your earthly Physicke is long a working,
and the Cures prooue imperfect, but Gods physick workes contin
                     •
                  ò presently; for, All
Gods workes are perfect. But it is not so in nature. Pierius
makes the Vulture the emblem of nature, Auolatus tarditate, being a
kind of Tortoise in his flying.
            First of all, it is intimated here vnto vs, What hast a Sinner
ought to make to get vp. S. Peter being in prison, the Angell said
vnto him, Surge velociter, Arise quickely;
                  Acts. 12. and without any more adoe, not staying
vpon his gyues, chaines, the gates, or the guards, he presently riseth vp and
gets him gone with all the speed he could. Noah puts the Crow out of
the Arke, Dimisit Corvum, qui egrediebatur, &amp; non reuertebatur:
The Hebrew Text hath it, Exiuit, exeundo, &amp; redeundo; He began to
make wing, but seeing such a vastnesse of waters, fearing to faile in his
flight, he returned backe againe: but being entred, carrying about him the sent
of those dead carcasses which had perished by the Floud, he went to and fro so
long, till at last he went his way and was neuer seene any more. Many there are
that will put one foot forward, and pull two backeward, make you beleeue that
they meane to goe on well in vertue and goodnesse, but beeing discouraged with
the difficultie of getting vp that hill, and hauing a monthes mind to follow
the sent of their former stinking (howsoeuer to them sweet seeming) sinnes, at
last they are vtterly lost and neuer more heard of; so apt is sinfull man to
leaue the best and take the worst.
            
               He that hath receiued a benefit, must
  expresse his thankfullnes.Secondly, By this her seruice this good
deuout old woman made known her bodily health; and by the ioy and comfort shee
tooke therein, shee manifested her soules health. At the verie first voyce of
Ezechiel, the boughes began to mooue, but as yet they had not life in
them, [Ossa arida, audite Verbum Domini] they were afterwards knit and
ioyned together, and set in verie good order: but they had need of another kind
of voice than Ezechiels to giue them spirit &amp; life. Saint
Augustine expounding that place of Saint Iohn, Verba mea,
Spiritus, &amp; vita sunt; saith, That this Spirit and life is in
himselfe, and not in thee. For that Poenitent which doth not giue some signe
or token of life, hath not yet obtained life; and that, He that in his seruice
and attendance doth not make shew that he is free of his former Sickenesse, his
health may iustly be suspected. Saint Paul giues vs this Lesson,
He that steales, let him steale no more, but, &amp;c. Hee must not
onely content himselfe with not stealing, or with working for his liuing, and
that it is enough for him to haue laboured hard; but of that which hee hath got
by the sweat of his browes, hee must giue part thereof to the Poore, if not for
the satisfaction of his former thefts, yet to shew himselfe a good Christian
by obseruing the rules of charitie. Zacheus did performe both these;
the one, in making a fourefold restitution to those whom he had defrauded by
forged cauillation, the other,Ep
                     •
                  . 4. by giuing to the Poore the
one halfe of his goods. Let all bitternesse, and anger, and wrath, crying
and euill speaking (saith the Apostle) bee put away from 
 you, with all maliciousnesse. First of all, there
must not abide in your brests the least smacke of bitternesse, anger, wrath,
euill speaking, nor any other maliciousnesse. But because it is not enough to
shun euill, vnlesse wee doe also: he thing that is good; he addeth in the
second place that which followeth anon after, Be yee courteous one toward
another, and tender hearted. For a good Surgeon ought no
                  •
                only to take away the paine in the
leg, but also to inable it to go.
            Thirdly, She did discouer this beginning of her amendment and
recouerie, by imploying this her health in the seruice of our Sauior Christ;
and by laying it downe at our Sauiours feet, she shewed that she was not ill
bred. If he that is recouered of a sicknesse, when hee is able to set foot on
ground, and to walke vp and downe his chamber, shall haue recourse vnto God,
and giue him thanks for this his restored health, it is a signe that God gaue
it him. Thankes slowly giuen (saith Seneca) lessens the benefit
receiued. Aristotle tells vs, That the Athenians admitted no other
Temple, saue that of Thankefulnesse, to the end that they might not be slacke
and dull in making their acknowledgement. And if he be blamed that is idle and
slow in rendring of thanks, What shall we say to him that neuer comes to offer
his seruice, but is carelesse in committing of sinne, and offends dayly more
and more?The embleme of ingratitude The Moone may
serue for an embleme to these kind of vnthankefull persons; who receiuing all
her light from the Sunne, in requitall of this so great a kindnesse, seekes to
cloud him by her of
                  •
               en eclipses.
Being herein like vnto him who sets himselfe downe vnder the shadow of some
Tree, and afterwards pluckes off the Fruit thereof, and teares downe it's
boughes.
            
               Now when the Sunne was downe, all they that had sicke folke of
diuers diseases, brought them vnto him, and he layd his hand on euery o
                     •
                  e of them and healed them. They
stayed till the Sunne set, for the obseruation of the Sabboth was so strict
with them, that they held it not lawfull on that day to cure the Sicke, much
lesse to bring them abroad in a bed or a chaire: And therefore said the Priests
vnto the People, There are six days in which men ought to work, in them
therfore come and be healed,
               
                  L
                        •
                     c. 13.14. 
               and not on the Sabboth
day.
            
            Amongst those Sicke which receiued health, Saint Mathew
saith,Why the Deuils ro
                     •
                  ed whē our Sauior cast them out. That there were some
possessed with Deuills, and that the Deuills did rore and crie, notifying the
force where with they were driuen forth their bodies, and withall confessing
him to be the Sonne of God: First, That he might let them alone (saith Saint
Augustine;) Secondly out of a pride of heart, to the end that none
might presume, that any man (as being but man) was able to cast them out of
their habitation, and depriue them both of their power and pleasure. But our
Sauiour Christ, He s
                     •
                  ffred

                     •
                  hem not to speake, because they
knew him to be Christ. This proposition may admit a double sence.
            The one, That this particle Quia, Because, is
declaratiue: nor would hee suffer them to speake, Quae? What? T
                  •
               a
                  •
                our Sauiour was the promised Christ.
            The other, That this particle is causall; he would not permit them
to speake, And why? Because they knew he was the promised Christ. And as when
Peter confest him to be Iesus Christ the Sonne of the euer-liuing
God,
                  Mat. 16.20. 
               He charged his
Disciples, that they should tell no man that he was Iesus Christ; so here
he inioyneth the like silence to the Deuills, &amp;c.
            In this second sence, this sequell may be made, That the Deuils
knew Christ; but is not to be gathred from the former: for they might speak
this, either mētiend
                     •
                  ,
or adulando, in a lyin
                  •
               ,
or flattering manner, though they had not any knowledge of him: so that which
of these two is most probable, it is yet depending  to be
prooued, whither they knew him or knew him not?
            In fauour of the former, to wit, that they knew him, we read in
the Gospell, That the Deuils had thrice confessed Christ, To be the holy one of
God, to be the Sonne of God, and the Sonne of the most Highest. In this verie
Chapter one of these foule Fiends said vnto him, What haue we to doe with
thee thou Iesus of Nazareth?
               
                  Luke 4.34.
               Art thou come to destroy vs? I know who thou art, euen the holy One of
God. And now here, The Deuils came out of many, crying and saying,
Thou art the Christ the Sonne of God. In the first Chapter of Saint
Marke many Deuils said the like: And in the eigth Chapter of Saint
Mathew, they called him the Sonne of the Highest.
            Where it is to be noted, That albeit our Sauiour Christ permitted
the Deuils to take the name in their mouthes, of the holy One of God, and of
the Sonne of the Highest; yet did he neuer suffer them to preach, that he was
the Christ. For although the name of Messias and of Christ be all one; yet the
names of Christ and of the Messias, were the most notorious amongst the Iewes.
Both the Wise and the Ignorant did expect him and beleeued in him; but all of
them did not know that he was to be the Sonne of God. And therefore our Sauiour
Christ put this question to the greatest Doctors amongst them, pretending to
proue the diuinitie of the Messias: What thinke yee of Christ? Whose sonne
is he?
            
            
               
                  Math. 22.Againe, The name of
Sonne of God, of Holy, and of Highest, may be attributed to any holy Prophet
whosoeuer, that is the Sonne of God by Grace; but the name of Christ was the
name of their Messias, and of their King whom they looked for, and that he
should come to redeeme Israell. And if the Deuills did publish him, they did
withall put in the hearts of the Iews a great hatred against Christ; as well by
seeing the glorie of their Messias placed vpon so meane and poore a man; as
also by seeing him thus applauded and proclaimed to the World by the Deuills,
presuming thereupon, that hee had made some Couenant and confederation with
them. Before Pilate they layd two things to his charge:
            The one, That he made himselfe the Sonne of God; and of this they
made least reckoning.
            The other, That he proclaimed himselfe King of the Iewes. And this
they held the heynouser crime.Two things Whereof the Iewes
  accused Christ. Luke 23. And Pilat hearing that hee
was the Sonne of God, began to be affraid; And would not take this for a
sufficient cause to put him to death. But when he heard that he tooke vpon him
the title of King of the Iewes, he presently pronounced sentence against him.
And the Romane souldiers, flouting at his Kingdome, put vpon him the ensignes
of a King; a purple roab on his backe, a scepter in his hand, and a crowne on
his head. So that the thing which did most trouble them, was, The name of
Christ. And therefore they sayd vnto him, Si tu es Christus, dic nobis
palam, If thou be Christ, declare it here openly before the people, and
tell vs plainely of it. But because hee would not prouoke them nor giue them
occasion before hand, least they might accuse him in the Tribunal of Rome, he
would not make answer vnto them, nor giue them any farther knowledge that he
was the Christ.
            In fauour of the second, to wit, That they did not know him; wee
haue on our side the temptation of our Sauiour Iesus Christ: for if the Deuils
had known him, they would not haue tempted him.
            Secondly, They knowing him to bee the Christ and the Messias, they
must likewise know him to bee the naturall Sonne of God: for the Deuils could
not be ignorant of that in Hel, which the most learned in Iudaisme had attained
to  here on earth.
            Thirdly, (and it is the reason of that glorious Doctor Saint
Hierome) No man hath known the Father but the Sonne, and he to
whom the Sonne was willing to reueale it. If the Father then did not
reueale his Sonne to the Deuills, nor the Sonne himselfe reueale the same, why
then surely they could not know him. But some one will say, That the Sonne did
reueale himselfe to the Deuils, not by infusing any light of Faith into them,
as hee did into those three Kings that came vnto him from the East, and to the
Prophets that were before them; nor the light of Glorie, as hee hath to the
Blessed▪ but by the light of his miracles and prophecies, and by some
secret and hidden signes of his presence, (for that is S. Austens
opinion) which the Deuils might better attaine vnto than men.
            And this reason sufficiently proueth, That they knew him before
they tempted him; yea, that they knew him euen from his birth; for then did

                  •
               ior and Redeemer, Miracles, Prophecies, and great signes of God.
And albeit the miracles were not then so many as those which he wrought
afterwards, when he had vnfolded and spred abroad the sailes of his
Omnipotencie; yet a few were enough to make the Deuill, who hath so great an
insight into naturall causes, to conceiue and see how farre short Nature came
in this great businesse.
            Fourthly,1. Cor. 1. The
glorious Apostle Saint Paul treating of our Sauiour Christ by the name
of Wisedome, saith, That none of the Princes of this World knew him; for had
they knowne him, they would neuer haue crucified him. And this may likewise be
vnderstood of the Deuill, whom our Sauiour stiles the Prince of the world: but
in case it be vnderstood of men, the Earth not comming to the knowledge
thereof, to whom God might haue reuealed it, hell could hardly know it.
            In this doubt there are (me thinkes) two truths that are most
certaine.
            The one, That the Deuill had not a full and assured knowledge,
that our Sauiour Christ was the naturall Son of God: for his knowledge was not
the knowledge of Faith, nor any cleere vision, but onely opinion. And as a man
of verie great vnderstanding being without the light of Faith, howbeit by the
miracles and prophecies of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, he might happely beleeue
that hee was the Sonne of God; yet some one doubt or other will be stil
remaining, that he may not be that promised Sonne. So the Deuil, euer since our
Sauior Christ was borne, had many, and those strong suspitions, that God was
become Man: These jealousies and suspitions were dayly by so much the more
increased in the Deuill, by how much the more our Sauiour Christ went dayly
discouering the signes and tokens of his Diuinitie; till at last, seeing
himselfe as it were conuinced by the euidence thereof, that he might put
himselfe out of this perplexitie, he first goes about to tempt him, and
afterwards to solicite his death. And this is the opinion of that glorious
Doctor Saint Hierome, vpon the eigth Chapter of Saint
Mathew, where he saith, That all the Deuils did beat vpon this ha
                  •••
               , went nosing and winding of it out,
and were wonderfull both fearefull &amp; iealous of the same, but that none of
them did assuredly know so much. And Saint Augustine in his bookes
De Ciuitate Dei, saith, That our Sauiour and Redeemer Iesus Christ
manifested himselfe so far forth to the deuils, as himself was willing, and he
would no more than what was fitting, &amp; thought that fitting, which was
sufficient to daunt and terrifie them, &amp; to free those that were
predestinated, from his tyrannie. And this was the tracke that they did tre
                  •
               d in, and all that they could gather
out of his miracles and former prophecies. Gregorie Nazia
                     ••••
                  
                
                saith,
That the Deuils had a great deale of knowledge of the paines &amp; torments
which they did feele when our Sauiour Christ did cast them forth of the bodies
which they had possessed. And of this knowledge, that is to bee vnderstood
which is here deliuered by Saint Luke, Because they knew him to be
Christ.
            
            The other, That God did hold this their knowledge in suspence
&amp; in doubt, by taking flesh in the wombe of an espoused Virgine: Which was
purposely done (as Ignatius saith) that hee might bee concealed from
the Deuill; for otherwise, the Deuils could hardly be ignorant that he was the
Sonne of the Virgine Marie, and not the Sonne of Ioseph.

               IN matter of Conuersion, this action
of our Sauiours seemeth of all other the most famous for the manifesting of
Gods mercy.
            In matter of Faith we know verie well, That hee that shall seeke
him as he ought, shall find him: And of this Truth God hath giuen many
testimonies in Scripture, They that seeke me
                     •
                   early shall find me: And in another place, If

Adulteresse passed through a purgatorie of

great deale of faith, loue, patience, and hope: but this woman, I know not what
labour or paines it cost her, more than the letting downe of a Bucket and rope
into the Well to draw a little water. That such a dishonest woman as this was,
whom fiue husbands could  not suffice, and had
entertained a Ruffian or Swash-buckler to be her companion and champion; that
so base and vile a woman as shee was (consider her which way you will) in her
linage, her fortune, her life, her behauiour, her age, o
                  •
                whatsoeuer else that sauours of basenesse; that Christ
should make choice of her to publish his name, to bee as it were one of his
Euangelists and Preachers of his Gospell, cannot but appeare to the World to be
one of the greatest demonstrations of Gods both bountie and goodnesse. This
made Esay to crie out, Good newes, good newes I bring you, I haue
ioyfull tydings to tell you, Fountaines haue gushed forth in the Desart, waters
haue shewne themselues in the Wildernesse, and riuers appeare where there was
nothing before but drie land. Grace doth vsually follow the steps of Nature,
and though ordinarily your Brookes and your Riuers keepe themselues within
their owne bounds and precincts, yet sometimes they leape out of those beds
that were purposely made for them, and ouerflow those brinkes that bind them
in, watering those thirstie places that stood in need of their refreshing. Iust
so stands the case with Grace; for although it commonly keeps it's vsuall and
ordinarie course, yet now and then it swells aboue it's chanels, and riseth out
of it's bed, making the wildernes a poole of waters, the barrainest grounds
most fruitfull, and the greatest Sinners the greatest Saints.
            And heere some one perhaps will say, I will wait for the like
comming of Gods mercie: but let me tell him, whosoeuer he be, That this is not
a going for water to the Fountaine, but that the Fountaine should bee brought
home vnto vs. It is sufficient, that wee haue so franke and free a God that
will now &amp; then conferre these his great fauours vpon vs without our
seeking of them: But what will not he doe for thee, if thou shalt seeke him
with thy whole heart? Such a one, our Sauior compares to that Merchant which
sought after pretious pearles of inestimable value. Wherein he notifieth vnto
vs that extraordinarie diligence wherewith we are to seeke after him; and this
is that Via Regia, or the Kings Highway in which we must walke, if we
mean to find him; and this was the track that was troad in by all the Saints of
Heauen: Hi sunt qui venerunt ex magna tribulatione, &amp;c. These are they
which came out of great tribulation, &amp;c. Others our Sauiour compareth
to hidden Treasure, which is found by chance, and seldome hapneth; and this it
was this womans good lucke to light vpon, which was reuealed to some few, but
from thousands of others hidden and concealed, &amp;c.
            
               He came into a Citie of Samaria called Sycar. The Saints
doe render two reasons of this journey. Saint Cyril saith, That newes
was brought vnto the Pharisees, That Christ had more Disciples than Iohn
Baptist, though Christ himselfe did no
                  •
                baptise; which raised such an inraged enuie in the hearts of them,
that it comming to our Sauiours knowledge, he left Iudea and went for Galilee,
Being inforced to passe through the midst of Samaria. Wherein he gaue
to the Ministers of the Gospell a twofold Lecture.
            The one,A discreet feare is better than a
  forward boldnes. Math. 10. That they ought sometimes to
preferre sufferance before boldnesse; and rather to dissemble some feare, than
to show themselues too forward; and to flye from the sword of anger than to
oppose themselues against the edge thereof. And therefore it is sayd, If ye
bee persecuted in one Citie, flye into another. Many account it a great
point of valour, and that they prooue themselues to bee stout men in standing
stiffely to their Cause, and maintaining it with an vndaunted resolution; but
this is rather Weakenesse than Fortitude, For in some occasions, the greatest
Victorie, is to suffer himselfe to be vanquished.
            The other, (and let this be the second occasion of our Sauiours
iournie)  That the Minister of Gods word, who is to loue
all, to desire all should bee saued, and that all should haue the hearing of
the Gospell, not to sow all the seed of Gods word in populous Cities.
Clemens Alexandrinus compareth our Sauior to the Sunne, which
inlightneth the World, expelleth Darkenesse, augmenteth Plants, fomenteth
Flowers, breeds Gold in the veines of the Earth, Pearles in the shells of the
Sea, inricheth and beautifieth all Creatures, and leaues no corner of the
earth, which hee doth not visite and comfort with the beames of his light and
splendor. The Pharisees murmuring, that our Sauiour Christ cured the sicke on
the Saboth, he said vnto them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I
worke. It is said in Genesis,
                  Iohn. 5.17.
  Gen. 
                  
                     •
                  .2. 
               He
rested from all his worke which he had made. True it is, that God had then
put an end to all the workes of his Power, but not to all the workes of his
Loue. For in doing good deedes, the three diuine persons neuer take any rest.
And as his loue in it selfe is perpetuall, so doth it still continue towards
his Creatures. Dionisius stileth Loue, Mobile, incessabile,

                     •
                  eruens, &amp;
superferuens,
               Gods loue doth neuer rest, but is still
  working. He might likewise haue termed it Vniuersale; for there
is not that worme whereunto it's vertue doth not extend it selfe. In a word, As
that Husbandman in the Gospell, did not leaue out any part of the land, but did
sow the same all ouer; so our Sauior Christ did plough that holy Land, which
had the happines to haue him set his feet thereon, and did sow in it the seed
of his Word; and by his Apostles did afterwards spred the same abroad through
all the World: and here now, fals himselfe a worke at Sichar.
            
               And there was Iacobs well. That the memorie of dead
friends should be so powerfull with God, as to make him affoord fauours to the
liuing, it is much; But that the places where his friends liued, should worke
this effect vpon him, it is more than much. But the Wel of Iacob
teacheth vs this truth, &amp; the good fortune that this woman had to find our
Sauiour sitting there, where Abraham had erected an Altar vnto God;
where he had receiued those great promises for his posteritie; where
Iacob digg'd that Well, which was a great reliefe to that Citie. God
treating of annointing Dauid King, willed it to bee done in Hebron.
And why there more than in any other place, Abulansis renders this
reason, That, that people did not deserue so good a King as
Dauid,
               2. Reg. 2. but a Tyrant like
his predecessors. And because in Hebron, Adam, Abraham, Isaac, and
Iacob were there interred, he would that it should be in Hebron, that
the place might supply that defect which was wanting in the peoples desert. Our
Sauior Christ being born in Bethlem, the Angells came to tell the tidings
thereof to the Sheapheards. And why to the Sheapheards? What aduantage haue
they of Grace, Nature, or Fortune, aboue other men? Saint Ierome
sayth, That the antient Patriarchs had fed their flockes in those fields; and
that in this, as likewise in Rachels beeing buried there, consisted
this their happinesse: So that, not onely the Saints of God, but those places
wherein they liued, or dyed, will be a meanes for thee to meet with God. As in
the place where sinners meet, as in your Conuenticles of Heretickes, and
Witches, the Deuill comes amongst them, offering them imaginarie fountaines of
delights: So, in holy places thou shalt presently meet with God, who will offer
thee fountaines of liuing waters, &amp;c. Tertullian treating of the
Amphitheaters where men went in to kill one another, sayd, Tot daemones,
quot 
                     〈◊〉
                  , That there were as many
Deuils there, as there were Men. And a woman that was a Christian comming
from these sports, the Deuill entred into her. And beeing asked how he durst
doe so to a seruant of our Sauior Christ, made answer, I found her within the
limits of my Iurisdiction.
            
               Wearied in the iourney. It was no wonder that he was
wearie, it beeing a iourney,  of such painefull
circumstances.
            First, In that our Sauiour went foot; a trauaile which in long
iournies is woont to tyre out the strongest and ablest men. Those Posts which
foot it, and those Souldiers that march long and hard marches, remaine
oftentimes surbated and lame of their feet. Dauid pursuing those
theeues that had fired Ziklag, one part of his Souldiers were so tired out with
their trauaile, that they aboad behind, and were not able to goe ouer the
riuer Bezor.1. Reg. 30. And Dauid
afterwards flying from his sonne Absalon, the Storie sayth, That he
and all his people were so wearie, that Achitophell being aduertised
thereof, would haue set vpon him at midnight, presuming that beeing so wearie
as they were, they would not be able to defend themselues. The Prophet
Elias flying from Iezabel,
               2 Reg.
  16. came so bruised and so leg-wearie, to the shade of a Iuniper Tree,
that he desired of God, that he would be pleased to take away his life.
            The second circumstance was, The scortching heat of the Sunne,
which in the Sommer time is so troublesome, that a Sheepeheard or Heardsman can
hardly indure it. The Children of Israell were afflicted in Aegypt with the
tale of their brickes, with the gathering of straw for to make them, with their
skins rent and torne with rods of thornes and briars, and tormented with many
miseries: And God leading them one Sommer through the Desart of Arabia, which
was a hot sandie ground, it seemed vnto him, that it was intollerable trouble
for them to trauell in such heats, and to march on as it were in despight of
the Sun; He spread a cloud ouer them like a curtaine. Which i
                  •
                all one with that of Wisedome,
               
                  Psalm. 78. Sap. 18. 
               Thou madest the
Sunne that it hurted 
                     〈◊〉
                   not in
their honourable Iourney. Ionas beeing parched with the heat of the Sunne
in the Confines of Niniuie, did suffer such great torment, that he held death
the lesser pain of the two. The Sun beat vpon the head of Ionah, that
he fainted &amp; wished in his heart to die; and said,
                  Ionoh. 4.8. It is better for me, Lord, to die,
than to liue. The glorious Doctor S. Austen saith, That the Sunne did
not know our Sauiour Iesus Christ till the houre of his blessed death, and that
his then retyring of himselfe, the hiding of his head, and the withdrawing of
the beames of his light, was not onely in pittie and compassion of his
Creator, but to shew his sorrow and repentance for that small kindnes which he
had vsed towards him when he went his journeys.
            The third circumstance was, The extream heat and drought of the
Countrie of Samaria; the heat of those sandie grounds being (as the Poet saith)
very furious and raging; Furit

                     •
                  stus arenis. This must needs
cause thirst and wearinesse in the hardest constitution whatsoeuer; How much
more must they work their painfull effects vpon so delicate and tender a bodie
and complexion as that of our Sauiour Christ?
            
               Wearied with his journey. The ends which God intended in
wearying out himselfe, were not without some deepe mysterie; Non frustra
fatigatur Iesus, (saith S. Austen) Iesus did not take this
paines in vaine.
            
            First of all, He was willing thereby to honour our sweats and our
labours, and to giue a sauorie relish to our trauells and paines taking.Reasons why Christ would thus weare out himselfe. Psalm.
  69. Those waters which passe through a golden Mine, are verie sweet and
pleasing to the taste; and your 
                  
                     •
                  quae, waters, in Scripture are taken for poenae,
punishments. Saue me, ô God, for the waters are entred euen to my
soule. The many waters of affliction were not able to quench my loue. But these
our paines passing through those veins which are farre better and more pretious
than gold, doe giue a sweet and pleasing sauour to Heauen it selfe. The horne
of the Vnicorne makes those waters wholesome,
                  Psalm.
  29. which before were full of poyson and venome: Ou
                  •
                Sauior, whom Dauid calls a 
 Vnicorne, makes our paines to turne to our good. In
that day shall seuen 
                     〈◊〉
                   take hold
of one man,
               
                  Esay 4. 
               saying, We will
eat our owne bread, onely let vs bee called by thy name, and take away our
reproch. The name of Woman signifieth weakenesse, and the number of seuen,
multitudinem, a great sort: whereas hee saith, That seuen women shall
take hold of one man; the meaning is, That our weakenesses, and our paines and
punishments in this life, shall take hold on that one man our Sauiour Iesus
Christ, and beseech him to take pittie of vs, and that he will do vs but that
grace as to suffer vs to be called by his name, it is all wee will aske of him;
all the World will else shun and abandon vs, as persons affronted and
disgraced: Aufer opprobrium nostrum, O Lord take this reproch from
vs.
            
            Secondly, S. Bernard saith, That God could haue redeemed
Mankind at a lesse rate, but that he was willing by this so painfull a course
to banish sloathfulnesse, lazinesse, and vnthankefulnesse out of mans heart.
For if God journeying in the heats, suffering the scortching of the Sunne, and
neither eating nor drinking, tireth out himselfe thus for thy sake; How canst
thou be so lazie and vngrateful to this his great paines and wearinesse, as to
sit still vpon thy stoole to take thy ease and doe nothing? How carefull were
those two Tobies, in deuising how they might requite Raphael
for the paines which he had taken in his journey? What shall we giue him to
content him? If we should giue him halfe of that we haue, nay (said the young
Tobie) if I should become his slaue,
                  Tob.
  12. I cannot recompence the loue and kindnesse that he hath shewne vnto
mee. Esay treating of our Sauiour Christ, saith, Et factus est
saluator in omni tribulatione eorum, &amp; Angelus faci
                     •
                  i 
                     〈◊〉
                  
saluabit eos: The Seuentie translate it, Neque Angelus, sed ipse
Dominus saluabit eos, He shall be their Sauiour in all their tribulations, not
any Angell, but God himselfe. And here it is not an Angell that takes this
paines, and thus wearies himselfe, but it is God himselfe. Is it much then,
that thou shouldst be carefull and painefull, and toyle and moyle to doe good,
seeing thy Sauiour hath set thee so good an example, and will so well accept
and reward this thy labour and seruice?
            The reason whereof is much strengthened and increased, by
considering what a powerfull God our God is,
                  Esay
  40. and what a poore thing is Man. All nations are as a drop of a
Bucket before him, and are counted as the dust of the ballance, which is
with a verie little, little lesse than nothing. And as it is in the booke of
Wisedome,
               
                  Sap. 11.22. 
               As the
small thing that the ballance weigheth, so is the World before thee, and as a
drop of the morning dew that falleth downe vpon the earth. S.
Ambrose questions God, Why, ô Lord, so much for so little? And
his answer is, That this doth indeere thy ingratitude, and his loue. This is a
thing to stunne a man, and to make him stand astonished; that the Sea should
goe after a drop of water, as if therewith it should augment it's immensitie
and vastnesse; that Totum should seeke after Nihil, he that
is all in all, after a thing of nothing, as if thereby he should better his
Being; that God should seeke after a wench that was a water carrier, and being
so wearie (as he was) he should sit him downe vpon Iacobs Well, and
there entertaine himselfe in talke with her, How can she euer be able to
requite so great and vndeserued a kindnesse?
            This reason is also the more indeered, considering how little it
concernes God, and how much it imports man. What is it to God? Nothing.
What ca
                     •
                  st thou giue vnto
him? If thou shouldst vndoe thy selfe in his seruice, thou shalt not adde
one dramme of glorie vnto him. What is it to Man? The greatest happinesse that
can befall him, in that God should tyre out himselfe for him who is not worthie
the looking after. Much (saith Saint Bernard) ought man to meditate
on this his wearinesse, considering how deere man did cost God. It were 
 meere idlenesse in man, to thinke that God made him for
nothing, or to sit still &amp; be idle. In the sweat of thy browes shalt
thou eat thy bread: This was poena culpae, a punishment appointed
him for the fault he had cōmitted, that euery bit of bread should cost him a
drop of sweat▪ and this lighted vpon our Sauiour himselfe,The great cost &amp; pai
                     •
                  es that Christ was at for our redemtion. as being our
Suretie: the debt was ours; but he standing bound for vs, was forced to pay it,
we failing therein. Meus cibus est, vt faciam voluntatem patris: And
here the meat that he was to feed vpon, was a hard crust to gnaw vpon. The
conuersion of this woman; he was to tug for it and sweat for it,
                  Esay 53. 
               Hee shall see of the trauell of his
soule; and shall be satisfied. His bodie trauelled with wearinesse, his
soule with thoughts and cares; but he shall see that which he desired, and bee
satisfied. Saint Ambrose discoursing of these our Sauiours paines,
saith, That for that he did esteeme so highly of them, they are not to be
considered as pains, but as the price of our Redemption. And if the price of
thy ransome cost God a great deale of labour and sweat, it is not much, that
the price of finding God should be thy labour and thy sweat. Laurentius
Iustinianus saith, That God had contriued it so, that the Nin
                  •
               uites should see Ionas gaping
for breath, &amp; al-to-berayed with the filthie slime and oyle of the Whale;
to the end that this so sad and sorrowful a spectacle, should be of
equiualencie to those miracles which he wrought amongst them, and should
persuade them to Fastings, Sackecloath, and Ashes, &amp;c. Philon
declaring that place of Deutronomie,
               
                  Deut
  20. That hee that had planted a Vineyard, and not eaten of the fruit
thereof; and that he that had built him an house, and not dwelt therein; and
that he that had married a wife, and had not enioyed her companie, should
returne backe from the Warre: this learned Doctor saith, That the reason of
this Proclamation was, for that it was not held fit,Heauen
  is not gotten with a Song. that another should for a song (as they say)
and doing little or nothing for it, come to inioy the fruit of another mans
labours. Will God, That thou shalt not enioy another mans house, or his
Vineyard, for nothing; and shall hee giue thee Heauen for nothing?
Zenon inferreth the selfe same consequence, from that place of
Genesis,
               
                  Gen 3. He will not but thou
shalt get thy bread with the sweat of thy browes; And doest thou thinke thou
shalt purchase Heauen without taking of paines? This is a strange and harsh
kind of doctrine to our daintier sort of people and nice Worldlings, who
cannot be without their coaches, their warming-pannes, their perfumes, their
muffes, their banquets, their musicke, their Comedies, their Gardens of
pleasure, &amp;c. as if this were the way to goe to Heauen. But I would haue
thee to know (saith Greg. Nizen) that Heauen may be here fitted and
prepared for vs, but not enioyed. Doe not thou wearie out thy selfe in seeking
after that which our Sauiour Christ could not find. When I see a man fare
daintily and delicately, choise and nice in his dyet and his cloathes, and as
greedie after his profit as his pleasure; I would faine know of him, being so
great a Louer as he is of a merrie and pleasant kind of life, being wholly
giuen to iollitie, How he dares to goe treading and counting these his steps,
towards Hell? Doth he thinke to lead the same life there?
            
               Iesus then wearied in the iourney, sat downe on the Well.
A Trauailer comes all dust and sweat, and exceeding wearie to a fountaine, hee
washes himselfe, makes himselfe cleane, drinkes, sits downe, and so seekes to
shake off his wearinesse. But our Sauiour comming extreame wearie to this
fountaine, nei
                  •
               her washes himselfe,
makes himselfe cleane, nor drinkes, but onely sate thus, as beeing wearied,
that this woman might take notice of his wearisomenesse, and this his
troublesome iourney; and so Caietane, and the Cardinall of Toledo, doe
expound the word sic; that he sate euen thus vpon the Well.
            
               The ends why God exprest himselfe to be thus
wearie, are no lesse deepe and profound, than the former.
            First, Because out of this his wearinesse, the sinner might
apprehend his loue. Theodoret deriueth the name of God from a Greeke
word, which signifieth, To runne. And they gaue this name vnto God,
who tooke the starres to bee Gods. Damascene, that hee was therefore
called God, because he succours our miseries, and releeues our necessities with
that hast and speede, that thereby we may perceiue how much he loues vs.
Leo the Pope, expounding that place of Saint Luke, My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me, sayth, That these words which our Sauiour vsed
to his father, were not words of complaint; but a Lecture which he read vnto
Man, making vpon the Crosse a muster or beade-rolle of all those troubles, that
he had both in his life and death suffered for him: And therefore cryeth out, I
beseech thee (deere Father) that thou wilt giue Man eyes to see, The end
why thou hast forsaken mee. For that thy naturall sonne, should come to
this so miserable and wretched an estate, it was neither disaster nor disgrace,
nor force, nor any thing else that could cause it, but the great loue which I
bore vnto Man, seeing his disease was so desperate, that it was requisite that
I should tast of this so bitter a potion, and that if I had been so
necessitated and so sick as Man was, I could not haue done more for my
selfe.
            We haue two principall fountaines of Loue to consider in God.
            The one, In his Creating of vs.
            The other, In his Redeeming of vs.
            In creating vs, hee poured forth the rich treasure of his Loue,
Thy hands made mee, and fashioned mee, &amp;c. The Beasts, Birds, and
Fishes could not say so much. All the rest of the creatures had their beeing,
God onely speaking the Word, Ipse dixit, &amp; facta sunt. But when he
came to the creation of Man, he sayd, Faciamus hominem, &amp;c.
Tertullian, and Saint Austen are of opinion, That God tooke the
forme of Man vpon him, because he had created him after his owne image, and
likenesse. Wherein hee manifested most strange pledges of his loue, not only
because he was the workemanship of his owne hands [howbeit Aristotle
saies, that euery man beares a loue and affection to that which his owne hand
hath planted, and for which he hath taken paines. As God sayd vnto
Ionas, Thou weepest and takest on for thy Gourd, for which thou hast
not laboured, neither madest it to grow;] but for the good affection that he
had placed vpon man, and for that he had taken Mans likenesse vpon him.Gods loue to Man in his Creation. The like in his
  Redemption. But much more are wee bound vnto him, that he hath redeemed
vs. He created vs by his power, but he redeemed vs by his loue; so that we owe
more to his loue than his power. His taking of our weakenesse vpon him, was
our strengthening. Thy power did create me, but thy frailtie did refresh
me, said Saint Augustine. He calls our Redemption a second
Creation: And as we vse to sing in the Church, What benefit had our birth
beene vnto vs, if we had not receiued the fruits of Redemption? So
likewise may we say, What good would our creation haue done vs, if wee must
haue perished had we not had the profit of Redemption?
            Secondly, For to put a Sinner in some good hope &amp; assurance;
for why should not I relie vpon Gods loue, being that he hath taken such a
deale of pains forme, and hath wearied out himselfe to giue me ease?
Zacharie represents our Sauiour Christ vnto vs with wounds in his
hands;
                  Zacar. 13. and asking the question,
What are these wounds in thy hands? How camest thou by them? or, Who gaue them
thee? This answer is returned, Thus was I wounded in the house of my friends.
Rupertus &amp; Galatinus are both of opinion, That this is a
metaphor drawne from  a Labrador or Husbandman,
who hath his hands hardned, and a kind of callum or thicke skinne
growne vpon them through too much labour. So that seeing Man was condemned for
his offence, to dig and plough the earth, Christ vndertooke that taske for him,
as one that was willing to suffer for his friends.
                  Za
                        •
                     har. 13.5. 
               I am a
Husbandman; for Man taught me to be a Heardsman from my youth vp: for, to
ease them of this burthen, I was willing to beare their punishment. He then
that shall take such pittie and compassion of me, he that shall vndergoe such a
deale of trouble for my sake, makes me to haue a strong hope and beleefe, that
he will denie mee nothing. Iacob wrestled all night with God, the
Patriarke in that strugling got a lamenesse, and God grew so wearie, that he
cried vnto him, Let me goe.
               
                  Gen.
  32.26. But Iacob answered, I will not let thee goe except
thou blesse mee. Was this a good time, thinke you, to craue a blessing?
Yes marry was it; for I standing in need thereof, and God waxing wearie for my
sake, What shall I aske, that hee will denie mee?
            Thirdly, Christ shews himselfe wearie, to the end that by this his
great pains he might saue the sinner from perdition. Saint Augustine
saith, Fatigatus Iesus, quia fidelem populum inuenire non poterat, That
Iesus was wearie, because he could not find out a faithfull People. The
Sheepeheard that seekes after his lost sheepe, may wearie out himselfe verie
much in seeking of him out; but much more will hee find himselfe so, if he doe
not find him. It is not so much Gods paines that hee takes, but our sinnes, and
our wandring so farre out of the way from him, that makes him so wearie. And if
a Sheepe had but the vnderstanding to know the paines that the Sheepheard
takes, the care and wearinesse that accompanies such a strange kind of
stragling, besides his being indangered of being deuoured by that Wolfe the
Deuill, which lies in wait for his destruction; he would bee better aduised,
and fall a bleating after his Sheepheard Christ Iesus, and hasten into the
Fold.
            Fourthly, The feare of a mans own hurt and condemnation; for
though God now shew himselfe vnto thee wearie, and as it were quite tired out
in seeking after thee, who refusest to be found while it is day; thou shalt
see him hereafter in pompe and maiestie, to thy great feare and terrour. Now,
he calls vnto thee, inuites thee, and intreats thee to come vnto him; now,
thou findest him heere, sitting and staying to see if thou wilt come vnto him,
beeing meruailous willing and readie to doe thee good, and to supplie thy
necessities; hee is now all pittie and mercie, but hereafter he will bee all
rigour and justice. Nothing hath put God to halfe that paines, as hath thy
sinnes; it is they that haue wearied him, they that haue wounded him, and they
that haue crucified him:Our sins the cause of all Christs
  sufferings. and if therefore now thou shalt not take the benefit of
these his paines, wounds, and crucifixion, they shall hereafter condemne thee.
For you was my side opened, and yee would not enter in, saith Saint
Augustine; my armes were spred abroad to embrace yee, but yee would
not come neere me; and therefore these my wounds shall be the Atotrney to
accuse you, and the Witnesse to condemne you: and all those things which
heeretofore did represent vnto you reasons of confidence and assurance, shall
now driue you into the depth of desperation, and make you call vnto the
Mountaines, with a Cadite super nos, Fall vpon vs and couer vs. The
Quaile keepes a mourning and complaining in her kind of language, when shee
sees the Sunne; and the Condemned they will likewise howle &amp; lament, when
they shall see Christ in the Heauens. The Angells did aske, Who is this that
comes from the earth so glorious and so bloudie? I haue fought a bloudie
battell here vpon earth, triumphing like a Conqueror ouer the Deuil &amp;
Death, &amp;c.  But then they replyed and asked him,
What, bloud and wounds in Heauen? to what end, I pray you? They are memorialls
of the wrongs I receiued: And in the day of vengeance I shall say vnto you,
Behold the Man whom yee haue crucified. Ye shall then take notice of
these wounds, &amp; of this Crosse of myne. So that those things that are now
our strong tower, our defence, our protection, our assurance, and our loue,
shall be our feare, our cowardise, and our condemnation. In Exodus God
commanded, That they should not seeth the Kid in the milke of it's Damme.
Lyra and Clemens Alexandrinus make this Glosse thereupon,
That God would not haue that which was the beginning of it's life, to be the
instrument of it's death. And this may be verified of the wearinesse and
wounds of our Sauiour Christ; neither the torments of the Deuill, nor the fire
of Sodom, nor the water of the Floud which drowned all the world, nor hel it
selfe ought so much to feare thee, as to see thy God thus wearied and wounded
for thee.
            
               
                  Sedebat sic, He sate thus.
               Saint Chrysostome, Euthymius, and Theophilact
  say, Sedebat sic, non in cella, aut in loco honoratiori, sed in terra, He
  sat thus, not in a chaire, or some more honorable place, but on the
  ground: Conforming himselfe according to the time and place, he sate him
  downe as well as he could, not being curious of the softnesse, easinesse, or
  conueniencie thereof. Wherein are condemned two sorts of persons.
               The one, They, who for one houres paines, will haue a thousand
  dainties to delight themselues withall, and for one houres labour, a thousand
  refreshings. They indeere this storme and tempest of theirs more than any
  Galley-slaue that tugs at the oare; they extoll their labour so high aboue the
  skies, that there is no earthly reward that can recompence their paines. It is
  such a strange thing for them to put themselues to any trouble, and so vaine is
  their presumption, that the sea and the sands are too little to content them.
  And this is commonly the condition of base people, that are preferred to
  honourable place.
               The other, They who will not be pleased with accommodating
  themselues as well as they can, or content themselues with that which is
  sufficient for them, but are still seeking after more than is enough: And this
  is too common amongst vs.
               
                  Christ the only Well of refreshing
 water.
                  He sate thus vpon the Well. A woman (saith Saint
  Augustine) eame to the well, and found a Fountaine there which she little
  thought of. And he farther sayth, That he sate him downe vpon the Well, to
  the end that we should not seeke to draw water out of this depth, but endeauour
  to draw water out of that Fountaine which is aboue all the waters in the world.
  This Well is the water of life, let vs draw from hence, that we may drinke of
  the cup of Saluation. One of the attributes of Christ, is Oyle or Balsamum
  poured forth and scattered abroad, whose propertie and qualitie is to swimme
  vpon the water. The water drawne from the Well giues a great deale of trouble,
  and little satisfaction; it is a brackish water that quenches not the thirst:
  but this soueraigne Fountaine affoordeth vs that sweet and comfortable water
  which quencheth the flames of the firie lusts and affections of this life, and
  allayeth the thirst of our sinnes. Of that water of the mysticall Rocke which
  in those dayes of old did quench the thirst of sixe hundred thousand persons,
  Thomas and Lyra affirme, That it followed the Campe, and that
  God would not that any other water should giue them reliefe, but the water of
  the Rocke;1. Cor. 10. which was a figure of
  our Sauior Christ: This Water was Christ. This woman came for water to
  Iacobs Well, but this could not quench neither her nor thy thirst, but
  another Fountaine that sate vpon the lid  or couer of
  this Well.
               
                  His Disciples were gone into the Citie to buy meat.
  Saint Chrysostome hath obserued, That our Sauior Christ and his
  Disciples had but little care of their bellie; yet it being now high noone, and
  hauing had so long and painfull a journey, they were inforced to goe buy them
  some victuals.

  Eue, did not allow of the Serpents excuse: Maledictus super omnia

  one as if he should haue said, That others sinnes might receiue excuse, but to
  forsake God for to fill the bellie, is inexcusable.

  they may be sayd to flye, and not to flye? And his answere is, That this was a
  Miracle of Loue, that made them assist for Gods glorie, and yet flye abroad for
  mans good. It is a Type of our Sauiour Christ, who resting his bodie on the
  couer of the Well, set the cogitations of his soule vpon it's wings;
  considering with himselfe, how farre those sheepe were gone astray, which he
  came to bring backe againe vnto the fold, and what a deale of labour and paines
  he was to take, being scattered so farre asunder as they were.
               
                  There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Our
  Sauiour Christ beeing wearie, and this woman beeing likewise wearie, let no
  man in this life, be he righteous, or be he a sinner, looke for any ease or
  rest in this life. If Gods elect children come brused and broken to Heauen,
  passing through fire and water, broyled, roasted, sawne, dragged on the ground,
  whipt, and quartered, Sancti per
  
                        〈◊〉
                      vicerunt regna, &amp;c.
  And if the places of Scripture, which indeere the torment of the just are many,
  many likewise are the indeerements of the torments which sinners suffer. So
  that both of them plie the oare in the Galley of this life. Si impius
  fuero, va mihi; si iustus, non leuabo caput, &amp;c. But the just hath a
  double aduantage.
               
                  The Iust yet haue a double aduantage ouer the
 Wicked.The one, That their paines are sauorie vnto them, because they
  suffer them for Gods sake. Saint Gregorie sayth, That in the midst of
  his greatest miseries, the iust doth inioy a kind of secret glorie. And that
  Iob vpon the dunghill did inioy this comfort, thinking vpon the peece
  of pot-shard which God had put into his hands; weighing &amp; considering with
  himselfe, that as the fire doth harden the clay, and makes it a purer and
  better kind of Earth than before; so he himselfe should be much bettered by
  this fierie triall of his, and bee purified the more by these sores and boyles
  that brake out vpon his bodie. But the sinner doth not inioy this happinesse,
  euen his verie pleasures are painfull vnto him, and his solace turnes into
  sorrow.
               The other aduantage is the end of the Iust. Saint
  Bernard treating of the two Theeues, sayth, That they came both
  wearie, and their bones broken, to that other life, They had the same prison,
  the same shackles, bonds, torments, &amp; crosse. But Quam

  vnder some vnhappie Starre, That hauing buried fiue husbands, she should be so
  poorely left amongst them, that she must be forced to fetch water her selfe at
  the Well, &amp; be driuen to draw it vp. But there are two great miseries that
  accompanie your women  that are wanton and
  lasciuious.
               The one is, That they commonly come to a great deale of neede

  wast and consume their means vpon them, come themselues in the end to dye in an
  Hospitall. She gathered it out of the hyre of a Harlot, and they shall
  returne to the wages of an Harlot. He followes the same metaphor
  still,
                     Micah. 1.7. proouing that the wages
  and riches of Harlots seldome thriue, and as they are wickedly gotten, so are
  they vilely and quickely spent. The price of a Whoore, is scarce worth a
  loafe of bread. So that, though such a one should chance to gaine a
  Million, yet (as Salomon sayes) were it a Kings patrimonie, it would
  be all wasted and consumed: For such a one shall be brought to that low estate,
  that she shall bee readie to starue for lacke of food. And albeit, speaking in
  the generall, our neuer offending of our God, bee a good meanes for the
  purchasing of prosperitie to our selues; yet to grow into wealth by this base
  course, is but Vigilia inferni, Hels Wake-day; a little pleasure, for
  a long torment. For that which generally happeneth to all, and in particular to
  women, is the extremest of pouertie.
               The other is,She lets out her selfe, that she
 may hyre others. Ezech. 16.33. That your H

                     〈◊〉
                  
  to bestow money to maintaine her Louers and to find her friends. So
  Ezechiel complained of his people, They giue gifts to all other
  Whoores, but thou giuest gifts to all thy Louers, and rewardest them, that
  they may come vnto thee on euerie side for thy fornication. There are some
  Whoores that sinne out of Couetousnesse, I will goe after my
  Louers,
                  
                     Hose 2.5. 
                  that giue me my
  bread and my water, my wooll and my flaxe, mine oyle and my drinke.
                  
                     Hose 2.8. And because they doe not acknowledg
  whence this good commeth; For she did not know that I gaue her corne and
  wine &amp;c. they come to suffer great hunger. For God takes away those
  blessings from them, for the which they giue thankes vnto their Louers.
  Therefore will I returne, and take away my corne in the time
  thereof,
                  
                     Hos. 2.9.10.11. and my wine in
  the season thereof, and will recouer my wooll and my flax lent, and discouer
  her lewdnesse in the sight of her Louers; and no man shall deliuer her out of
  my hand; I will cause all her mirth to cease, her feast dayes and all her
  solemne feasts, I will destroy her vines, and her figge-trees, whereof she
  hath said, These are my rewards that my Louers haue giuen me.
               Others sinne out of lasciuiousnesse and wantonnesse, and these
  come to be so vile and so base, that they woo men both with their person and
  their substance, giuing money to boot. And the more that time flyes from them,
  and that their goods forsake them, the more they pursue their pleasures and
  indeauor to inioy them. Let it be in thy Letanie, That God would deliuer thee
  from this euill, That the more thy Vices fly from the, the faster thou shouldst
  follow after them: For when thy youth inuiteth thee therunto, and that thou
  inioyest these humane pleasures and delights, euen then it is bad; but when
  Time goes away from thee, Age comes vpon thee, and that it is high time that
  thy Vices should leaue thee, or thou them▪ that thou shouldst then follow
  after them, that is farre worse, and the very vtmost of Ill.

                  Woman giue me drinke. When our Sauiour craued water of
  her, waterdropped from him, and hee sweat hard for it. And Saint
  Chrysostome sayth,The first step to justification
 is mercy and pittie. That Christ was willing that the Samaritane should
  confesse this Almes vpon him, in token  that the first
  step to our justification, should be mercie and pittie. Petrus Chry
                        •
                     
                     logus saith, That our Sauiour
  Christ did craue this humane mercie of her, that towards her he might exercise
  his diuine pittie. If you withhold the water a while in the Fountaine, and
  keepe it backe from it's course, it gusneth foorth in greater aboundance; so is
  it with the milke in the brest; and so likewise is it with Almesdeeds, which
  still returne a double requitall. Saint Ambrose expounding that place
  of Saint Paul, Pietas ad omnia vtilis, saith, That the man that is
  pittifull, though he suffer weaknesse in respect of the flesh, Vapulabit,
  sed non peribit, He shall be beaten, but shall not perish. For there is
  nothing in a greater disposition to make God to pardon a sinner, than is
  Pittie.
               
                  Giue me drinke. God gaue way to his thirst, that he
  might make way the better to that hunger and thirst which he hath after the
  soule of a Sinner; which is so great, that he onely is able to indeere the
  same; it is meat and drinke vnto him, and so sauorie to his tast, that none is
  able to expresse the true relish thereof, sa
                     •
                  e onely he that knowes it. But here he made choice to manifest this
  his desire rather by his thirst, than by his hunger.
               First, By taking occasion from the water which this Woman drew
  out of the Well.
               
                  Thirst a greater torment than
 hungar.Secondly, Because it is the more vehement passion of the two, and
  doth commonly more afflict and torment vs; yet in the end, he did not drinke,
  drowning that his thirst in that other thirst which he had after this poore
  soule. The enamoured. Spouse did not eat, though shee were hungrie, because
  her Beloued was sicke, and had no stomacke to his meat. Our Sauiour seeing this
  Samaritane had no great mind to drinke of this liuing water, doth not drinke
  himselfe, though he were athirst, and much desired to quench it with this dead
  water. Sampson hauing a Fountaine neere at hand, would not drinke,
  though he were thirstie, til he had got the victorie ouer his enemies. Saint
  Augustine saith of S. Laurence, That he did not feele the
  fire of the Tyrant, so strongly was hee affected with that diuiner fire.While the Heart is aboue the starres, the heele hath no feeling of
 the Stockes. So our Sauiour was not sencible of his owne thirst, nor of
  his wearisomenesse, nor of the Sunnes heat, out of the desire that hee had to
  obtaine his pretended victorie. Saint Ambrose expounding that place
  of Dauid, Cucurri in siti; saith, That it may be read, Cucurrerunt
  in siti: and hee prooueth it out of the Greeke word, as also that which
  followeth, Ore suo benedicebant, &amp; corde suo benedicebant: The
  letter treateth of the Scribes and Pharisees; so that our Sauior Christ had
  thirst, and they had thirst; he thirsted for their life, they thirsted for his
  death. And this was one of the reasons why our Sauiour Christ did sweat bloud
  in the garden; for that the Priests, the Scribes, and the Pharisees had decreed
  his death in that their sacrilegious Councell: for albeit they had alreadie
  treated before of his banishing of him from amongst them; another while, of
  throwing him downe from the side of a steepe hill, and attempted many other
  disgraces and violences vpon his person; yet were they not come til now, nor
  was it euer to be supposed that they would haue beene so cruel, as to desire
  the shedding of his diuine bloud, &amp; to pursue him with that eagrenes as
  they did vnto death. And because no other desire could satisfie that their
  bloud-thirstie desire, than the desires of our Sauiours bloud, to leape out of
  those his sacred veines, for their and our good; therefore, Factus est
  sudor sanguinis, &amp;c. To this end tended that Fac citius of
  Iudas: he had alreadie driuen the bargaine, and the price for which he
  sould him agreed vpon, and his feet did now itch to be gone, that he might
  receiue his money; in token that Christ had a greater desire to be sould, than
  he had to sell him: and therefore hee said vnto him, Quod 
   facis, fac citius, That thou doest, do quickly. The
  like end he had in the institution of his blessed Sacrament; the deliuerie was
  promised, but before Iudas deliuered him vp, he deliuered vp himselfe;
  Praestabilis super malitia, (saith Ioel) not onely because
  Gods mercie ouercomes Mans malice, but because it preuents it.
               
                  How comes it, that thou being a Iew requirest drinke of
  me? When this Samaritane woman did petition our Sauiour Christ, saying,
  Sir, giue me of that water; he might haue made her this answer,
  How is it that thou bee
                        ••
                     g a
  Samaritane, askest drink of me? But she was a woman, and weake, and
  therefore she spake as she did; but our Sauiour would not touch vpon that
  string. For, to take too much libertie to our selues in our owne proper cases,
  and to vse hypocrisies and finesse in those of other men, is the condition of
  naughtie and ill natured people. Saint Chrysostome sayth, That when
  any scruple did arise, our Sauiour tooke vpon him to excuse it, Christum
  cauere oportebat, It concerned Christ to looke about him, Howsoeuer it
  did this Samaritan woman. Absalon beeing vp in rebellion against his
  father, when Hushai the Archite, Dauids friend, was come vnto
  h
                     •
                  m, and sayd vnto
  Absalon, God saue the King, God saue the King: Then Absalon
  said vnto Hushai, Is this thy kindnesse to thy friend?
                  2. Reg. 16. &amp; 16. He made no scruple
  to take his fathers Kingdome from him, and his life; but could find fault with
  Hushai for forsaking his friend Dauid. So blind are men in
  seeing their own faults, &amp; so apt to condemne others of that crime whereof
  themselues are most guiltie.
               Yet notwithstanding, this woman was not quite disheartned
  herewith, shee was not cleane dasht out of countenance; shee had her boughs
  rent and torne, like vnto Daniels tree, yet at the root shee had some
  greenenesse and sappe remaining. Saint Iohn sayd to the Bishop of
  Philadelphia, I know thy workes,
                  Ther's hope of a
 
                        •
                     ree, if it be neuer so little
 greene. Apoc. 3.8. 
                  for thou hast a little strength, and
  hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. But a little strength, yet
  this little strength, this little vertue, may make the tree to waxe greene
  againe. Those trees that haue no shew of verdure, no signe of greenenes, are
  commonly condemned to the fire. Thou sufferest thy selfe to bee subdued by the
  world, the flesh, and the Deuill; thou forgettest, if not forsakest thy God,
  thou runnest on in thy sinnes, and makest no reckoning of them; yet there are
  some pawnes and pledges of Heauens loue, whereon thou mayest ground thy hopes,
  and betake thy selfe one day as seriously to Gods seruice, as thou hast
  earnestly followed thyne owne foolish pleasures.
                     Ezech. 16. 
                  Ezechiell charging his people
  in the metaphore of a little pretie young maiden child, whom God had protected
  from her cradle, reckoneth vp one after another the many courtesies and
  kindnesses that he did her, the rich apparell and iewels that hee bestowed vpon
  her, and all to this end, that when she should forsake his house and run away
  from him, she might carry with her some memorials of his loue; for Gods fauors
  neuer are forgotten, and are neuer vnwelcome, come they neuer so late. Take
  compassion, ô Lord, vpon me, when I cry vnto thee,
                     Ierom. 3. For thou art my father and the guide of
  my youth. And God will then reply vnto thee, Bee thou still of this mind, and
  see thou forget not to consider with thy selfe that I am thy father and thy
  first loue, to whom thou didst make the first tender of thy good will and
  affection; and let this be a Motiue vnto thee to make thee to leaue thy vile
  courses, and to repent thy selfe of the wrongs thou hast done mee, and to
  bewaile thy many slidings from me, that I may run with open armes to receiue
  thee and hugge thee in the bosome of my loue. It was an especiall prouidence of
  God, that the Babilonians burning and destroying all the jewels &amp; spoiles
  of the children of Israell, they suffred them to carry along with them to
  Babilon their instruments of Musicke, which was, to put them in hope that they
  should one day  returne againe to Ierusalem their beloued
  Countrey. For in a strange land they could not play vpon their Harps, nor sing
  the Songs of Syon, Quomodo cantabimus canticum Domini, &amp;c.
               
               Saint Chrysostome sayth, That this woman gaue
  wonderfull great tokens of her Predestination.
               First, in those scruples that she made.
               Secondly, in the desire and willingnesse that shee had to be
  saued. Scio quia Messias ve
                        •
                     it. But Hell is full of good desires. Gilbertus the
  Abbot sayth, That it is an ordinarie thing with sinners to say, O, how I do
  desire to liue a godly and a holy life; and yet complying with all those other
  desires of the bodie, they neuer complie with those of the soule. Saint
  Ambrose treating of the good desires which the Prodigall had when he
  kept hoggs, to forgoe that base kind of life (Surgam &amp; ibo ad patrem
  meum) saith, It little importeth to say, I wil goe, vnlesse I put the same
  in execution. Otherwise, these weake purposes of ours are rather deceits,
  wherewith the Deuill goes entertaining &amp; deluding vs. And as it is a follie
  to put any hope or confidence in weake influences, which neuer take effect; so
  those our idle and dangerous determinations, which possesse and hinder the
  will, and still crie Cras, Cras, are but the cords that draw vs along
  vnto death. Consider with thy selfe the great good which the desire of Heauen
  worketh on the Iust, and that little good which it worketh on thee, and thou
  shalt then plainly perceiue, that it doth thee more hurt than good.
               Againe, Though this Samaritane discouered a great deale of
  ignorance in her discourse with our Sauiour;Christ respects
 not our knowledge, but our Faith. yet Christ offering her the water of
  Life, shee said, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the Well is
  deepe. And this was not much to meruaile at in so meane and sillie a soule
  as shee was: Nicodemus was a Doctor of Law, and yet betraid his great
  ignorance; Art thou a Master in Israell, &amp; knowest not these
  things? It was sufficient, that he shewed his care in matter of Faith.
  Our Fathers did worship in this Mountaine; It was sufficient, that he
  discouered his affection to those things that concerned his soule. Sir,
  giue me of that water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw. Our
  Sauiour hauing vsed this Woman thus kindly, and continued so long in
  conuersation with her, his Disciples at last comming vnto him,The leauing of sinne a sure marke of our Predestination
  thinking it now time to hie her home, leauing her Waterpots behind her, she
  made all the hast that shee could to the Citie, magnifying the person of our
  Sauiour Christ, and abhorring her former lewd life, shee turned ouer a new
  leafe, and made publique profession to all that she met with, for what end they
  were borne. Your Diamond will shine euen in a Dunghill, and your Mariners
  Needle in the darkest nights wil euer looke towards the North. Doe not alledge
  Peter vnto mee, saying, Lord, whither shall we goe? thou hast the
  words of eternall life: nor his confessing of Christ to be the Sonne of
  the liuing God; but when he was charged with the deniall of his Sauiour, with
  maledictions and execrations, then did he shew what he was. Lux in te

  loue which they bare to Ierusalem, [Si non proposuero Ierusalem in

                      meae, &amp;c.] so this woman did
  presently discouer the embers that lay hid in her brest.
               
                  If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith
  vnto thee, &amp;c. Heere begins this womans Catechisme; Christ dealing
  with her as Schoolemasters do with little childeren when they teach them first
  to read; or as Riders with yong  Colts, before they begin
  to breake them, vsing them verie gently, and smoothing and stroking them with
  the hand. Saint Augustine vnderstandeth by this gift, the water of
  Life; and by the water of Life, the holy-Ghost. And he alledgeth in fauour of
  this sence, that place of Saint Iohn, If any man thirsteth, let him come
  vnto me and drinke. He that beleeueth in me, as the Scripture saith, out of his
  bellie shall flow Riuers of liuing Water. And the Euangelist adde
                     •
                  h, That our Sauiour vttered this sentence,
  Concerning the Spirit, which Beleeuers should receiue. S.
  Cyril vnderstandeth thereby, the Grace of the holy-Ghost;
  Theodoret, the Word of God; S. Ambrose, Baptisme. The
  proportion consisteth in three things:
               The first, That as liuing Water doth enioy an inseperable vnion
  with the fountain from whence it flow
                     •
                  th; whence it followeth, that it can neuer be dried▪ vp, nor
  haue any euill sauour, like those dead waters of your Cisternes and your
  standing Pooles, which are dried vp, stinke and putrifie, &amp; breed fil
                     •
                  hie vermine: So in like manner the
  grace of the holy-Ghost, the Word of God, and the blessed Sacraments, inioy
  the selfe same vnion with that first beginning from whence they proceed.
               The second, That as your liuing water doth enioy a kind of life,
  &amp; vncessable motion, (for which cause the Scripture attributeth thereunto
  the actions of life, The Flouds are risen, the Flouds haue lift vp their
  voice, the flouds lift vp their waues,

                      1. 
                  &amp;c.) So the grace of the holy
  Ghost, the Word of God, and the blessed Sacraments, cause in the Soule the
  effects of life.
               The third, That as your liuing Water doth ascend to the height
  of it's birth and Beeing; so the Grace of the holy-Ghost, the Word of God, and
  the blessed Sacraments, ascend vp euen as high as to God himselfe, because
  they had their birth &amp; Being from God, he being the Spring or Wel-head from
  whence they had their rising; Fiet in eo sons aquae salientis in vitam
  eternam.
               
               
                  If thou knewest the gift of God. First, hee setteth
  downe the originall of all our ill; which is, our not knowing, or our want of
  knowledge:Ignorance a maine cause of all our euill.
  According to that of Pope Clement, in an Epistle of his to the
  Councell of Toledo. And it is a most assured truth, That the first step to il,
  is the ignorance of good. Salomon saith, Without knowledge the
  mind is not good.
                  
                     Prou. 19. Hee calls it
  the knowledge of the soule, which is the onely thing that importeth vs for
  Heauen: As for the knowledge of the World, and the wisedome thereof, it is but
  foolishnesse with God.
               Secondly, he doth not say, If thou didst but know who it is that
  talketh with thee, thou wouldst haue giuen him water without asking thee for
  it,All that Man can giue vnto God, is to praise him for what
 he receiueth from him &amp; wouldst haue offered him to drinke, of
  thine owne accord: though comparing Man with God, Man cannot be said to bestow
  any thing on God by way of gift or donation; all that good correspondencie
  which can be held on mans part, is to shew himselfe thankeful for the fauours
  which he receiueth from Gods hand. If God shall giue me wealth, he doth it to
  the end that I should serue him; if he giue me honour, he doth it to the end
  that I should maintain his cause, &amp;c.. Anna, Samuels mother said,
  O Lord, if thou wilt looke on the trouble of thy handmaid,
                  1 Sam. 1. 
                  and remember and not forget thyne
  handmaid, but giue vnto thyne handmaid a man child, then will I giue him vnto
  the Lord all the dayes of his life. Nor doth this earths pouertie owe
  ought more for those fauours which we haue from Heauen. This made Saint
  Augustine to say, Da quod iubes, &amp; iube quod vis. And the
  truth of this is grounded vpon that which is deliuered in the last Chapter of
  the first of the Chronicles, when as Dauid and the Princes of
  the people made a plentifull rich Offering of three thousand talents of gold,
  seuen thousand of siluer, and as many of other

                   mettals,1. Chron. 29. &amp;c. This holy King said, Who
  am I, and what is my people, that wee should be able to offer willingly after
  this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thyne owne hand we haue giuen
  thee. None can offer vnto God, saue what they haue receiued from God;
  Quis prior reddit illi, &amp; retribuitur ei?
               
               Thirdly, Christ did lay a double bait before this woman.
               
                  Two baits at which women vsually
 bite.The one, Curiositie of knowledge.
               The other, Desire of receiuing. Two things wherewith that sex of
  theirs is soonest taken: and as the holy-Ghost hath said, That in another third
  thing womans appetite is insatiable; so likewise is it in these two: and for
  this cause they compare her to a Lampe, which goes still sucking in the oyle
  with which it must continually be maintained.
               
                  No doubt of Gods giuing, if there bee none in
 our asking.Fourthly, Gregorie Nazianzen hath obserued, That our
  Sauiour Christ did put a doubt in the Samaritans desire, forsitan
  petisses, he put a doubt in her asking, but not in his giuing.
               To shew vnto vs, That albeit woman bee couetous in receiuing,
  yet God is more bountifull in giuing.
               To receiue, is proper vnto Creatures that are in need and in
  want: all Creatures haue their mouths stil open, crauing their fulnesse from
  God; and God he is alwayes readie at hand to satisfie their hunger. Open thy
  mouth wide (saith the Psalmist) and I shall fill it. The soule desireth but one
  onely thing, which is thy selfe, ô God, this will suffice her: Nam
  vnum est necessarium, for one thing is necessarie. But the Flesh through
  it's many longings, desireth many things; yet let it desire neuer so many, it
  shall be sooner wearied with asking, than God with giuing, if it bee for it's
  good. Abraham did entreat for Sodome till hee waxed wearie of his
  suit; and had he beene earnest therein, and not haue giuen it ouer, it may be
  God would haue spared that Citie. What shall I returne to the Lord for all
  that he hath rendred vnto me; I will take the Cup of saluation, and will call
  vpon the name of the Lord. Man is disingaged by paying, and is impawned by
  receiuing: but God holds himselfe fully satisfied for those former fauours hee
  hath done thee, to the end that thou maist craue new courtesies from him; hee
  lookes not to haue old scores paid, and desires nothing of thee but a
  thankefull acknowledgement.
               And this is the reason why Christ became a suiter to this woman
  for a little water; he was willing to beg of her a draught of dead water, that
  shee might beg of him a cup of liuing water: dealing with her as a father doth
  with his prettie little sonne, begging an apple of his child, that he may
  thereby take occasion to throw vpon him a thousand fauours.
                     Phi
                           ••
                        p.
 4. The Philippians made much of the Apostle, who thanking them for this
  their kindnesse, saith, I reioyce in your care for me; I speake not
  because of want, for I haue learned in whatsoeuer state I am, therewith to be
  content. Notwithstanding yee haue well done, that yee did commun
                     •
                  cate to my affliction; not that I
  desire a gift, but I desire the fruit that may further your reckoning. The
  rendering of thankes for one courtesie, is a requiring of another; but I doe
  not thanke you to this end, but that yee may reape the fruits of your charitie
  extended toward me.
               But some one will say, If God be so free handed, and so
  bountifull in giuing, knowing our necessities, why doth he driue vs to beg
  these his fauours? Saint Augustine answers it thus, That God will haue
  vs to exercise our selues in the petitioning of our desires; Vt possimus
  capere quae praeparat dare, That wee may bee made capable of those kindnesses
  which God is willing to conferre vpon vs. Thomas hee puts the question
  thus; Either God will giue me this or that, or he will not giue 
   it me: For his will is immutable; and begging, be it in
  what kind so euer, seemeth to be Quiddam accessorium. But his answere
  is, That begging is the meanes which God hath appointed and preordained,
  through which you may receiue that blessing which God before all ages was
  determined to giue vnto you. So that Prayer, is that rope or cord by which we
  draw vp water from that deepe Well of Gods euer flowing bountie.
               Lastly, another doubt is put, whether shee were willing to beg
  this liuing Water or no, at Christs hands? For the sinner will euerie foote
  bee crauing of the goods for the bodie, but for those of the soule he often
  stands vpon a Forsitan, being carelesse whether he haue them or no. It
  is our dayly petition, that God would giue vs the dayly bread of this life, but
  take not so much care for that of the other. The sons of Reuben, &amp;
  of G
                        •
                     d in passing ouer
  Iordan, saw certain fields that were verie fertile and fruitfull, and those
  pastures seeming good vnto them for their flockes, besought Moses and
  the Princes of the people that they might haue the possession of them; loosing
  the desire of their promised Land. In like manner the sinner will be well
  content, to take for his inheritance and possession, the forbidden fields of
  the humane delights of this world, and forgoe the desire of those that are
  heauenly and diuine.
               
                  If thou knewest the gift of God. When the rich denies
  the poore a cup of cold water, a morsell of bread, an old shirt, or the like, a
  man may say vnto him, Si scires donum Dei, If thou didst but know
  what thou deniest, and to whom thou deniest; Now thou doost not know so much,
  neither doost thou thinke so much, but the time will come when God shall say
  vnto thee, Thou sawest mee hungry, and gauest me not to eat; To such as
  were wearie thou hast not giuen water to drinke;
                     Iob. 22. &amp; hast withdrawn bread from the
  hungrie. A Cauallero comes into the Church, kneeling vpon one knee, like a
  fowler when he makes a shoot at a fowle, casting his eye on euery side of the
  Church, rowling them this way and that way; O! if thou didst but know whome
  thou adorest, or if thou couldst but see the reuerence wherwith the Angels
  stand in Gods presence! The Merchant, he wil swear and forsweare for his
  commoditie; The Souldier, hee will turne Turke vpon point either of profit, or
  of honor; The Gamester vpon euery bad cast, or euery little hard carding, will
  curse and blaspheme; O! if thou didst but know whose name thou takest in vaine
  in that foule mouth of thine, or that thou wouldst but consider whom thou
  blasphemest, &amp;c.
               
                  Lord, thou hast not wherewith to draw, and the Well is
  deepe. There is not any Historie that can more indeere the great
  reckoning that God makes of a soule, than to see how our Sauiour Christ doth
  here suffer, and indure the ignorances of this vile foolish woman. Doe but
  weigh &amp; consider the Maiesty which God doth inioy in Heauen, not as he is
  in himselfe, for Mans imagination is but a thimble-ful in comparison of the
  incomprehensiblenesse thereof: but as the Scripture paints him foorth vnto vs.
  Daniell reckons vp his pages by thousands, his seruants by hundreds of
  thousands, the Heauen of Heauens (sayth Salomon) are straight and
  narrow Pallaces for his dwelling, Excelsior Coelo est;3. Reg. 8. The wheeles of his Caroch are the wings
  of the Cherubins. After that Iob had spent many Chapters in
  expressing his power, and relating his famous Acts,2.
 Chron. 2. hee addeth Omnia haec ex parte dicta sint viarum
  eius. We heare little, and wee know lesse; But if God should thunder out
  his greatnesse, who were able to abide it? Quis poterit sustinere? But
  that this God, onely Good, onely Holy, onely Mightie, onely Mercifull, and
  onely Infinite, should entertaine talke so long with a poore silly woman,
  beeing so lewd a creature, and of so euill a life, showes what a wonderfull
  great loue he  beareth to a distressed soule.
               
                  Thou hast not wherewith to draw, and the well is deepe.
  Let vs suppose that the waters, in sacred Scripture (as bef
                     •
                  re hath beene sayd) did signifie
  troubles; And let vs likewise heere deliuer vnto you, that they also signifie
  pastimes and delights: And not onely humane but diuine, so farre as to become
  the Symbolum and signe of happinesse. That they signifie humane happinesse, we
  may ground it vpon this reason, that they are inconstant, fugitiue, transitory,
  and slide away as water, Omnes morimur, &amp; quasi aqua dilabimur,
  sayd the woman of Tekoah to King Dauid. Wee must needs dye, and we are as
  water spilt on the ground. And this Truth may be verified as well in mens
  persons,
                     Ier. 2.13. as their goods. They
  haue forsaken me▪ the fountaine of liuing waters, to digge them pits, euen
  broken pits that can hold no water. Qui bibit, &amp;c. (sayth
  Iob) Which drinketh iniquitie like water. Quasi aquam super aquam
  refectionis educauit me,
                  
                     Iob. 15.16.
                  &amp;c. (saith the Psalmist) He maketh me to rest in green
  pastures,
                  
                     Psal. 23.2. 
                  and leadeth me
  by the still waters. They are likewise the symbole or signe of
  happinesse.
               First, Because Water is the Mother of fulnesse and aboundance.
  For that land that is without Water, voyceth out famine and hunger; Sicut
  terra sine aqua tibi.
               
               Secondly, Because nothing else can satisfie &amp; quench our
  thirst, when we are taken with the Calenture of Gold, of Iewels, and
  Pretious-stones; and then will the soule crye out for Water.
               Thirdly, Because nothing in comparison of Water can sute so wel
  with a thirstie appetite.
               This truth beeing supposed, the Samaritan woman vttered one most
  certaine and approued Experience; And one most grosse and foule Ignorance.
               
                  Worldly contents not
 
                        •
                     ttained without much
 toyle.The Experience is this, That the Water of humane content, must be
  drawne out of so deepe a Well, and with that strength of the arme, that not any
  thing can cost vs more deere in this life. Dalila placed her content
  in knowing where Sampsons strength lay; and the Scripture sayth, that
  she did sweat and toyle, and take no rest,
                     Iud.
 16. till she could come to the bottome of this Well. Ad mortem vsque
  lassata est. It was death vnto her, til she had obtained her desire. Saint
  Ambrose compareth humane pleasures and delights to the Serpent, who
  all his life time goes trailing his bellie vpon the earth, and eateth and
  licketh vp the dust therof. Boaetius compares them to the hony in your
  Bee-hyues, which although it bee sweete, yet it leaues a painefull sting
  sticking in vs. Seneca doth celebrate that saying of Virgil,
  who cals them Mala mentis gaudia. The water that came vp to
  Tantalus his chinne and glided away by him, signifieth as much. And to
  take such a deale of paines in the pursute of these transitorie pleasures and
  delights, as it betraies our Ignorance; so it makes vs to thinke that the sweet
  tast of this liuing water, is tyde to the rope and bucket.
               
                  Whosoeuer drinketh of this water shall thirst againe. But
  whosoeuer drinketh of the water that I shall giue him, shall neuer be more
  athirst. Our Sauiour here sets downe the aduantages, which the liuing
  water hath of the dead; The cheifest wherof is, That he that shall drink of the
  water of this Wel, shal soone after be athirst again. For, Aunque haze
  troguas, no assienta pazes, Though he make a truce for a time, yet doth he not
  conclude a finall peace. Saint Austen vnderstands this difference
  touching the thirst of the body; but diuerse other Doctors, of the the thirst
  of the soule. But the Plainest and the surest is, that it imbraceth both, and
  to cleere this opinion, Let vs first of all suppose, that (laying aside the
  thirst of the body) all do generally suffer the same in the soule. And he that
  from the clouds should behold  this vale of the world,
  shall perceiue it to be like a desart, full of filthy standing pooles of
  stinking water, and that all men goe thirsting after the same. And Saint
  Austen saith, Ipsum desiderium sitis est anim
                        •
                     . For, as a man cannot liue without the desire of
  the soule, so can he not liue without thirst. Inquietum est cor nostrum,
  donec 
                        •
                     eniamus ad te. This
  our saturity and fulnesse is reserued till wee come vnto God, who is our
  Center. Satiabor, cum apparauerit gloria tua, I shall bee satisfied, when
  thy glorie shall appeare. In the interim, we must of force liue tormented
  with hunger, and thirst.
               Secondly, We are to suppose that this liuing Water, whether it
  bee the Holy Ghost, be it Grace, or the Word of God, or Baptisme, doth not in
  this life quench either that thirst of the bodie, or that of the soule.
  Touching that of the bodie, we know that many Saints of God, rauished with some
  deepe contemplation, haue forgotten al hunger and thirst, without any torment
  or trouble, euen to the abhorring of meate. Nor is it much that the holy Ghost
  should worke this effect in man, seeing that the vehement passions of sorrow
  and of ioy, though in a different manner do dayly cause the like. For this our
  not eating nor drinking occasioned by passion, doth debilitate our forces, and
  weakens our strength; but beeing assisted by the helpe of the holy Spirit, it
  doth not onely conserue, but renew our strength, and put as it were new mettle
  into vs; as was to be seene in Elias, who with that water and bread
  which the Angell gaue him, went vp to Mount Horeb, &amp; there fasted 40 days.
  And diuers weake men haue (holpen by Grace) indured such hunger &amp; thirst,
  as hath made the world to stand amased at it. But the holy-Ghost doth not
  alwais worke these effects, saue only when it seemeth good vnto him; nor at all
  times, nor towards all persons, no not to the verie Saints themselues; for
  those that haue beene the greatest Fasters, haue come in the end to suffer
  hunger and thirst.
               And if we shall treat of the thirst of the soule, it is a plaine
  case, that this liuing water doth not quench it, but that the holy-Ghost doth
  to the Righteous adde more thirst after the goods of heauen, and those
  coelestiall ioyes: According to that of Ecclesiasticus, Qui edunt me,
  adhuc esurient; so that till wee come to see God, no man shall see
  himselfe voyd of thirst.
               Thirdly, The thirsting and hungring after these earthly goods
  and humane blessings, many seeke to quench the same by filling themselues full,
  and not denying to their eyes (as Salomon saith) any thing whatsoeuer
  their heart desireth vnderneath the Sunne. But their thirst growes still more
  and more, and their hunger increaseth, like him that hath eaten salt meats, or
  drunke brackish sea water. All that is in the world (saith Saint
  Iohn) is either the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, or
  the pride of life. Imagine three Riuers to thy selfe; one of
  delights,1. Io
                           •
                        n. 2.16. The Riuers of this world are three. a second,
  of riches, and a third of pride and vanitie: this is all the good that the
  world affoordeth, and hee that shall drinke of the water of any of these three
  Riuers shall still be more and more thirstie. And for this cause it is called
  Aqua concupiscentiae, the water of concupiscence; a lusting with
  desire: and as hee that shall drinke and swallow downe these his desires,
  cannot chuse but grow more and more thirstie; so hee that shall drinke of this
  water, shall desire to drinke more: And (as Salomon saith) hee shall
  follow the birds which flie in the aire. The truth whereof is well prooued by
  that rich man in the Gospell; who hauing food sufficient for many yeares, yet
  did toyle and labour (as if he had been in great want) to fill his barnes and
  his Granaries as full as hee could cram them, making more and more store, as if
  he should neuer haue prouision enough, hee thought all the roomes that he had
  were too little, I will pull downe my Barnes and 
  make them bigger.
               
               
                  
                     Ob.
                  And if any man shall aske
  me, If this rich man shall not be able as long as hee liues, though the yeares
  of his life were neuer so many, to eat out that which hee hath stored vp, why
  he should take such a deale of carke and care for his diet and his drinke? I
  answer, That for the feeding of his bodie much lesse might haue sufficed
  him,
                     Sol.
                   a little thing would haue serued
  the turne; but it seemeth in the Storie, that hee sought to satisfie his soule,
  and that hee inuited his soule to feast it selfe, and to make merrie, whose
  thirst is insatiable. Saint Gregory saith, That man, not finding in
  the pleasures and pastimes of this life, any humane delights answerable to
  those which his heart desireth, seeketh after change and varietie of sports;
  Vt quia qualitate rerum non potest, saltem varietate satietur, That if the
  qualitie could not, yet the varietie of them might some way giue content:
  In a word, as well doth the Couetous as the Prodigall die of hunger.
  Salomon after that he had entred into such a full riuer of del
                     •
                  ghts, and enioyed such a plentiful
  haruest of all kind of worldly pleasures, hauing the World at will, comes forth
  with two Horse-leeches of that insatiable appetite, that they still followed
  him, and neuer left crying, Affer, affer: And who could not finde in
  his heart to curse that Creditor almost to the pit of Hell, who shall still
  baule vpon a man, &amp; be as discontented being paid, as if he were
  vnpaid.
               Others there are, which seeke to satisfie this thirst with the
  goods of Heauen, taking onely from the earth as much as is sufficient for
  them; like vnto Gideons souldiers, who passing along by the riuer
  side, tooke vp water in the palmes of their hands. God approouing in the
  warfare of this life, that wee should inioy the goods of this life by
  snatches, and not to lie at racke and manger, Enioying this world as they
  enioyed it not: Whereas those that lay down vpon their brest, and like
  dogs lay lapping vp the water, were reprooued by him.
               Now by this time the aduantage appeareth cleere vnto vs, which
  liuing water hath ouer that which is dead: he that shal drink of this water,
  whither it bee this naturall water, or the symbolicall water of humane
  delights, he wil quickely become thirstie againe. For neither with the one
  water is the thirst of the bodie allayed, nor with the other of humane
  pleasures, that of the Soule: but hee that shall drinke of that liuing water
  that I shall giue them, shall thirst no more, reseruing it's satisfaction and
  fulnesse to that other life. This sence the Cardinall of Toledo followes. Yet
  me thinkes there is a plainer explication of this place, to wit, That he that
  shall drinke of this dead water, be it naturall, or symbolicall, shall haue
  thirst both here and there, in this, and in that other life: in this, because
  the more water he drinketh, the more hee thirsteth: in that other, because Hell
  is a lake where there is no water. The couetous rich man could not there get so
  much as one poore drop of water; the thirst there is too raging and too hot to
  be quenched. So that this verie word Iterum, Againe, doth implie an
  eternitie in their thirst; but hee that shall drinke of the liuing Water, shall

  Heauen.
               
                  Shall thirst no more. In part, it may be verified of
  the fulnesse of this life.
               First, Because albeit the holy-Ghost doth augment the thirst of
  those diuine goods, giuing the Righteous a taste thereof, as he did in Tabor to
  the three Disciples, when he gaue them a relish of his glorie; yet that thirst
  &amp; desire which they had at first to enioy that good, was not wearisome and
  troublesome vnto them, but rather that one little droppe, that one small
  crumme, seemed so 
                     •
                  auorie to
  Peter, that hee could haue rested well contented therewith for 
   many Ages. So that those drops of water which are
  deriued from the fo

                  ain of that
  celestiall Paradice, howbeit they augment our desire, yet they giue vs withall
  such a pleasing taste, that Christ calls those happie that enioy them. And
  Ecclesiasticus saith, That they surpasse in sweetnesse the hony and
  the hony combe; The remembrance of me is sweeter than honey,
                  
                     Eccle. 24.23. 
                  and myne Inheritance sweeter
  than the honey combe. They that eat me shall haue the more hunger, and
  they that drink me shall thirst the more: And Saint Augustine saith,
  That as in Heauen there is fulnesse without fastidiousnesse; so on earth there
  is a desire &amp; a hope, but no grieuous torment. Whereof we haue proofe from
  many places of Scripture, which inuite vs to drinke of these liuing Waters: As
  in Esay, All yee that thirst, &amp;c. Thou sweatest and labourest, and
  all to no purpose, because thou betakest thy selfe to those false brackish
  waters; haue recourse rather to those faithfull Waters, which, as
  Ieremie saith, make that good which is promised in
  Ecclesiasticus;
                  
                     Eccle. 5 23.
                  Draw neere vnto me yee vnlearned, and dwell in the house of Learning;
  Wherfore are yee slow, and what say you of these things, seeing your soules are
  verie thirstie? Your soules perish for verie thirst, and only the water of
  Wisedome is able to quench it. And this is the Argument of the eight chapter of
  Wisedome, which is verie excellent to this purpose.
               Secondly,He that tasteth the well of life
 will no more relish the bucket of Samaria Because this liuing Water
  doth in the Righteous quench the thirst of humane delights: and this woman
  heere had scarce heard the newes of this Water, but she leaues her bucket and
  her rope behind her, as if she cared not now any more for earthly water, or
  worldly pleasures. Melior

  cannot be fully quenched, by reason of those manifold sinnes whereinto out of
  our weakenesse we cannot chuse but fall, and that verie often, while we beare
  these bodies of sinne about vs.

  indeered this water,Men vsually couer, what is specially
 commended. that he set an edge vpon this womans desire, to enioy it. The
  Serpent spake so much of the forbidden Fruit, that Eue, contrarie to
  Gods commaund, did eate thereof. The Queene of Sheba heard so much good spoken
  of Salomons wisedome, that she vndertook a wonderful great journey,
  that she might both see and heare him. Abigal did so highly recommend
  to Dauid the noblenes of pardoning of an offence, that of a fierce
  Lyon, she made him as gentle as a lamb: the woman of Tecoa told Dauid
  so handsome a tale, that he pardoned his sonne Absalon.
               
               
                  Some do seeme to wonder, that the sinne of
  dishonestie beeing so hatefull a thing in Gods sight, that permitting other
  sinnes in his Apostolicall Colledge, as Pride, Couetousnesse, and Treason, he
  did neuer winke at this kind of sinne; and hauing antiently so seuerely
  punished them, that hee should now with this woman deale so mildly and so
  gently. The drowning of the World was for wantonnesse, &amp; such like
  dishonesties; the burning of Sodom, for vnnaturall vncleannes. The punishing

  The Antients did paint forth Interest, in Mercurie the god of
  Wisedome, with a bunch of keyes in his hand; for the couetous man opens another
  mans brest, for to receiue thence, and shuts his owne, that he may not giue:
  and for both these things he is verie prudent and wise. The Pharisees had many
  reasons and places of Scripture, for to persuade themselues that Iohn
  Baptist was not their Messias; to wit, for that hee was of the Tribe of
  Leui, that he wrought no miracles, that hee liued in the wildernesse,
  and remooued from the conuersation of men, contrarie to that prophecie of
  Baruc,

                  Cum hominibus conuersatus est, He dwelt

  man, and a Saint of God: and (as Saint Chrysostome hath noted it) this
  one reason they pretended should preuaile against al the rest, because it was
  in fauour of their owne particular interest. And it is a strange case, that the
  holynesse of Saint Iohn should bee sufficient to make them to conceiue
  that he was the Messias, but not sufficient to make them doe that which he

                  Theophilact gathers this
  note from hence, That Christs willing her to call her husband, was to aduise
  vs, that a wife is not to craue or receiue any thing, no not so much as a pot
  of water, without the leaue of her husband, and by order from him, being so
  made one flesh, and so one spirit by marriage, that they are not to be
  seperated. Malachie treating of a married wife, saith, Nonne
  residuum spiri
                        •••
                      eius est? Is she
  not the remainder of his breath? Whither the allusion bee made to the
  formation of Adam (as Saint Chrysostome hath obserued) for
  that with the  same respiration wherewith God had created
  the soule in Adam, hee likewise created that of Eue; or
  whither it haue relation to the husband, for that the selfe same spirit which
  giues life vnto him, is to giue the same likewise to his wife. Saint
  Augustine in a mysticall kind of meaning vnderstands by the man, the
  vnderstanding; but the plainer &amp; truer meaning is, That our Sauior in
  willing her to call her husband, would therby giue her occasion to confesse her
  fault, &amp; not to dismerit the mercie that was offered vnto her: for, to draw
  from a womans brest such immodest and dishonest weakenesses, will require a
  great deale of dexteritie and cunning. The seruant that ought ten thousand
  talents, presently confessed the debt, and the King forgaue it him;
  Inconfessione debiti solutionem inuenit, His confession was his
  solution, so saith Saint Chrysostome. But he was a man, and his
  fault lesse foule; but for an old woman to lie at rack and manger with her
  Louer in these her elder yeres, will aske much labour, and no lesse skill, to
  bring her to confession. Obstetricante manu eius eductus est coluber
  tortuosus, To take the subtill winding Snake out of mans bosome, we had
  need of Gods helping hand; that's the Midwife that must doe it. For to sinne
  (saith Saint Chrysostome) the Deuill putteth great confidence into the
  brest of a sinner; but to confesse the same, he infuseth far greater shame: so
  that dishonestie doth not onely disjoyne vs from God, but remooues vs, like the
  Prodigall sonne, a great wayes off from him, in regionem longinquam, into a
  farre Countrie. God hath giuen vs so noble and so gentleman-like a nature,
  (saith Saint Hierome) that Sinne doth make vs melancholly and sad; but
  Vertue, cheerefull &amp; merrie. And from hence (saith Saint
  Augustine) arise those remorcements of conscience, those inward stings
  of the soule, which like the flies of Aegypt disquiet a Sinner. Our Sauiour
  Christ therefore did here make mention of her husband, (Como mentado la
  soga, en casa del a horcado: as if one should talk of a halter in the
  house of one that hath bin hang'd) to the end that her sinne might trouble her
  conscience, worke some remorce in her, and make her to confesse the foulenesse
  thereof, to the intent that by this meanes she might come to tast of the liuing
  water.
               
                  Thou hast had fiue husbands, and he whom thou now hast is
  not thy husband.
                  Womens incontinencie. S.
  Chrysostom saith, That not any one of these was her husband; &amp;
  some modern authors follow this his opinion. And this may be grounded vpon that
  which Saint Hierome hath in an Epistle of his to Rusticus, Post
  sex viros inuenit Dominum, After six husbands she found the Lord. Irenaeus
  saith, That all saue the first were Adulterers. But these seuerall sences suit
  not with this Text. Athanasius saith, That they had a Law in Samaria,
  that they might not marrie aboue fiue times; and that the incontinencie of this
  woman was so great, that hauing buried fiue husbands, she tooke a friend into
  her house: to whom Saint Hierome adding those fiue which had beene her
  husbands truly and indeed; said, Post sex viros, After six husbands.
  And though these were not Adulterers, yet is it▪ sufficient proofe, that
  Sensualitie is a brackish kind of water, which causeth more thirst▪ and,
  for that Woman is an impatient creature, and much subiect to long after this
  &amp; that other thing, Ecclesiasticus stiles her Multi
                        ••
                     la. If she be thirstie, and one
  cannot satisfie the same, she will solicite sixe, nay sixtie to allay this her
  thirst. And therefore Saint Hiero
                        •
                     e equalls viduall continencie with virginitie, in regard of
  those her forepassed pleasures: for like the Phoenix she reuiues againe, by
  kindling the fire with the wings of her owne proper thoughts; and therefore in
  that respect preferres chast widdowhood before Virginitie. For in euerie kind
  of vice one sin calls vpon another; but it is most seene in these two, to wit,
  sensualitie, and heresie: And this peraduenture is the reason, why the
  Scripture commonly  calleth Idolatrie, Fornication.

  before shee tasted it, it appeared sweet and pleasant to the palate. Saint

  discouered: And therfore he saith, That that man is happie which hath
  least to doe with them, but most happie that doth neuer see them. S.
  Cyprian saith, That for a man to be inuironed on euerie side with
  flames of fire, and not bee burned; Nazianzen, That Flaxe should bee
  neere the fire, and not take flame; that a young man should bee in familiar
  conuersation with a young handsome maid, and not bee tempted with an euill
  thought, is a miracle. Theophilact deliuers vnto vs, That after that
  miracle of the Loaues and Fishes, the Apostles remained in the companie of
  certaine deuout women which had followed our Sauiour Christ into the Desert,
  and were indeering vnto them the greatnesse of Gods power; and that to diuert
  them from their conuersation, Coegit illos, he inforced them to
  imbarke, and to put forth to sea; and a fearefull tempest followed thereupon:
  in token, that amongst those rough billowes, furious waues, and tempestuous
  winds, they did runne lesse danger, than in the conuersation of those good and
  holy women. One of the names (amongst many other) which the Phylosophers and
  diuers other godly men haue giuen vnto women, was, Tumulus Viuorum, The
  Graue or Sepulchre of the Liuing. And as vpon your Tombes and Sepulchres
  there are Epitaphs written, which speake thus, Hic jacet, &amp;c. Here
  lies such a one; so vpon this liuing Sepulture, innumerable Epitaphs may
  be put: Here lyes the Prophecie of Dauid; here lyes the Wisedome of
  Salomon; Heere lyes the strength of Sampson; Here, the valour
  of Hercules: for woman is that shelfe or quicksand, wherein the
  valiantest, the wisest, and strongest men in the world, haue hasarded both
  their liues and reputation.
            
         
         
            
            THE XXIIII. SERMON, VPON THE SATVRDAY AFTER THE THIRD SVNDAY
IN LENT.
            
               
                  IOHN 8. 
                  
                     Perrexit Iesus in Montem Oliueti.
                   
                  Hee went into the Mount of Oliues, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               OVr Sauiour Christ the euening before, had preached in the Temple
til that the drawing on of the night inforced him to make an end of his Sermon.
Euerie one of his Auditors hied them home to their owne houses to ease and rest
themselues; but our Sauiour Christ, who had neuer a house of his owne to put
his head in, nor was inuited to any of theirs, betooke himselfe to the Mount of
Oliues, as at other times he was woont to doe; which stood in that distance
from Hierusalem, that it was but a walke, as it were, or easie Sabboth dayes
journey: in the middest whereof was that little Brooke beset with Cedars,
bending towards Bethania, where Martha and Marie dwelt. Heere
our Sauiour Christ spent that night in prayer, but early in the morning came
againe into the Temple, and all the People flocking about him to heare him,
this Historie hapned of the woman that was taken in adulterie; whereof we are
now to treat.
            
               What is typified by the Mount of
  Oliues.
               He went into the Mount of Oliues, &amp;c. Saint
Augustine in a Sermon De Verbis Domini, (taken out of that
Tract which he made vpon Iohn) calls the Mount of Oliues, Montem
chrismatis &amp; vnguenti: And Bede addeth, That the top of this
Mount doth typifie the heigth of our Sauiour Christs pittie and mercie. And the
Euangelist here aduiseth vs, That hee came from the Mount of Oliues to the
Temple, where this Storie succeeded; because a worke of so great mercie and
clemencie, could not conueniently come from any other place. Moses
descended downe from Mount Sinay, but with so rigorous a Law, that he brake the
Tables in pieces, that all the People might not thereby indanger their
damnation. Sinay is a Bush, and from Bushes what can be expected but bruises
and brushings, and all sharpenesse of rigour? But from the Mount of Oliues,
nothing could come thence but Oyle, which is that common Hieroglyph of mercie
and compassion.
            First, For it's softnesse and sweetnesse; and therefore did the
Diuine prouidence so order the businesse, that Priests and Kings should bee
annoynted  therewith, signifying thereby, how louing,
milde, and gentle they ought to be.
            Secondly, Because it strengtheneth and inableth those members
which are weake and feeble. Deus ol
                     •
                  um permisit (saith Clemens Alexandrinus) ad
leuandos labores. Your Wrestlers did vse to annoynt themselues with Oyle,
not only that they might slip the easier out of their Aduersaries hands, but
also because it made their joynts and their limbes more strong and nimble.
            Thirdly, For that it is a soueraigne salue for all kind of wounds;
for there is not any thing that doth so comfort, so supple, so assuage and
disperse any malignant humor, and cure any festred sore, sooner than your
pretious Oyles. The Samaritane cured with Oyle the wounds of that Traueller
whom hee found wounded on the way to Ierico. Esay complaineth,
                  Luk. 10. That no man would sucke and draw forth
the bloud from the wounds of his People,
                  Esay
  1.6. nor annoynt them with Oyle; Vulnus &amp; plaga tumens non est
circumligata, nec sota oleo.
            
            Fourthly, For it's stilnesse, softnesse of nature, and little
noyse that it maketh; beat it or batter it neuer so much, poure it out neuer so
violently, it makes no noyse, but shews it selfe still and quiet; whence grew
that adage mentioned by Plautus and Plato, Oleo tranquillior, More
still than Oyle.
            
            Fiftly, For the vertue that is in it for allaying of storms at
Sea, and repressing of the rage of the billowes, for (as Plinie and
Celius affirme) Oleo mare tranquillatur, With Oyle the sea is
calmed.
            
            Sixtly, Because there is not any liquor that doth more spread and
diffuse it selfe; Oleum effusum nomen tuum, Thy Name is as an oyntment
poured out, sayd the Spouse to her Beloued:
                  Cant. 1. And the Saints declare the same of the
person of our Sauiour Christ.
            Seuenthly and lastly, Because amidst all other liquors it is still
vpppermost▪ and is alwayes swimming aloft, and euermore keeping it selfe
aboue the rest; all which are proprieties of pittie and compassion, of mercie
and louing kindnesse, which is soft, supple, and sweet this is that which
giueth ease to our troubles, and remedie to our paines; this is that which
refresheth and strengthneth our weake and feeble Members; this is that which
cures our wounds and assuages the swelling of them; this is that which suffers
and sayth nothing, though neuer so hardly vsed; this is that which composeth
differences, turbulent strifes, &amp; the raging enmities of this Worlds sea;
and this is that which is a generall salue for all sores, a friend at need,
and the greatest representation of Gods glorie: for he is not seene in any
attribute that he hath, so much as in this, Misericordia eius super omnia
opera eius, His mercie is aboue all his workes. And to this purpose
Pieri
                     •
                  s reporteth▪
That it was concluded by a ioynt consent, that the Images of the gods, should
be wrought of no other kind of wood saue that of the Oliue.
            
               He went vnto the Mount of Oliues, and came againe into the
Temple, &amp;c.
               Our Sauiours ordinarie Stations and
  employments. These were our Sauiours stations, from the Mount to the
Temple, and from the Temple to the Mount; in the Mount he prayed, in the
Temple he preached. These are those two imploiments of Martha &amp;
Marie, figured in Lea &amp; Rachael
               ▪ herein is
sum'd vp the perfection of Christian religion. Where it is to be noted, that
Marie was still rauisht as it were, with the loue of our Sauior, and
the swee
                  •
               nesse of his words; and
Martha with the care to doe him seruice. Rachael was verie
faire, but barren; Leah foule &amp; tendereyed, but fruitfull. The
contemplatiue life is wonderfull beautiful, but not fruitfull;Action is to be preferred before contemplation. the actiue
life is foule and bleereeyed (nor is it any wonder, hauing it's hands
continually busied about wounds and fores) but is fruitfull in children and he
that inioyes the beautie of Rachael, 
                and the
fruitfulnesse of Leah, the contemplation of Marie, and the
practise of Martha, hath attained to the heigth of Vertue and
Holinesse. Ecclesiasticus commendeth the sonne of Onias for
these two qualities, As a faire Oliue tree that is fruitfull, and as a
Cypresse tree which groweth vp to the Clouds. The Oliue is the embleme of
fertilenesse, for it's fruit and it's multitude of branches, and sprigges
sprouting forth of it, sicut nouellae Oliuarum. The Cypresse is the
Symbole of beautie; for although it beareth no fruit, yet it shoots vp like a
Pyramis, to an extraordinarie heigth: and both of them make the stampe
of a holy Prelate, whose mercie and compassion is most fruitfull, and whose
prayer is most beautifull and pleasing: for there is not any thing that man
can imagine to bee more faire, than that a creature by this meanes should come
to grow so sweetly familiar with his Creator.
            
               
                  Ob.
               
               And all the People came
vnto him, and he taught them. Some man may doubt, How the effects of Gods
Word beeing so powerfull and so full of life, [Viuus est Sermo Dei, &amp;
efficax poenetrabilior omni gladio] and this People shewing themselues so
deuout in hearing him; it should come to passe, that our Sauiour comming so
early into the Temple, and tarrying there all day long, to teach and instruct
them in the truth, they fell into so many sinnes as they did, and in the end
into the greatest that euer was heard of?
                  Sol.
                But that may be answered of those the
Faithfull that were then, which Saint Bernard speaketh of those that
are now, That many professe themselues to be Christians, and applie themselues
to all those obligations that are befitting Christians, and performe all other
Christian actions, and come (out of custome) to Sermons, to diuine Seruice, to
the celebration of the Sacrament, &amp; adoration in the Temple. And this is
no great matter for them to do, considering they are borne and bred amongst
Christians; in farre stricter duties is the Moore tyed to his Mahomet,
and to the Lawes of his Alcaron; and in a farre more rigorous manner is the
Gentile bound to his false gods, for that they sacrificed their sonnes and
daughters to Idols; Immolauerunt filios suos, &amp; filias suas Daemonijs,
For myne owne part, I confesse (saith this holy Saint) in all
humilitie, That as the young Heifar being accustomed to eat and tread out the
Corne, takes the yoke patiently; so doe I come to these duties of a Christian,
and of a religious man,
               Most Christians are led by
  custome more than by deuotio
                     •
                  . 
               more out of custome, than deuotion. Would to God
that what this Saint said of himselfe in humilitie, might not too truly bee
said of many Christians amongst vs, who submit themselues to the yoke of the
Law, for the feeding of their bellie, and out of long custome.
            
               Adducunt ei mulierem deprehensam in adulterio, &amp;
  statuerunt eam in medio.
               
                  They brought vnto him a woman taken in adulterie, and set
  her in the middest, &amp;c. This woman was peraduenture drawne to commit
  this foule sinne, out of the assurance that she had that this businesse would
  be closely carried, and out of that good loue and affection which shee bare to
  the Adulterer, and hee to her; who happely had sworne vnto her, That for her
  sake hee would bee content (if need were) to lay downe a thousand liues. But
  this loue did end in leauing her vpon the Bulls homes, with danger both of her
  life and honour; and this secret came to light in the sight of all
  Hierusalem.
               There are foure manifest truths in matter of secrecie.
               The first, Not to relie vpon secrecie; because, Nihil
  opertum, quod non re
                        •
                     detur, There
  is nothing so closely carried, which is not at last brought to light: the
  rea
                     •
                  on is, because there is no
  sinne, be it committed in neuer so secret a corner, which  doth not come forth in the end, and vtter it's voyce aloud in the
  gates of the citie. So God said vnto Cain, presuming that that
  fratricide of his, because it was done in secret, should haue beene buried for
  euer, and neuer haue come to light, If thou doe well, thou shalt be
  rewarded for it; if ill, sinne lieth at the doore.
                  
                     Gen 4. And when Cain made himselfe as if
  he had been ignorant what was become of his brother Abel; the Lord
  said vnto him, The voyce of thy brothers bloud crieth vnto mee from the
  earth: And in Scripture it is an ordinarie kind of language to say, That
  our sinnes doe crie out for vengeance. When one of Ioshuahs souldiers
  hid a wedge of gold, Nicholaas de Lyra noteth,Sin,
 if nothing, will be it owne discouerer. Iob. 24.14. That the
  originall word signifieth likewise a Tongue; for though it were hid and buried
  vnder ground, yet did it crie out. Iob painteth forth the warinesse of
  an Adulterer, He waiteth for the twilight, and saith, No eye shal see me;
  and disguiseth his face; Like the Owle, he comes not abroad till it be
  darke night, he pluckes his hat downe in his eyes, he muffles his cloake about
  his face, he first lookes on this side, and then on that, lest any one should
  chance to espie him: In a word, such lewd liuers as these, like vnto your wilde
  beasts, keepe themselues close, watching for the darkenesse of the night:
                     Psalm. 104.20. 
                  In ipsa pertransibuut omnes
  bestiae agri, Thou makest darkenesse, and it is night, wherein all the beasts
  of the Forrest creepe forth; and so it is with these beastly minded men.
  Salomon makes another kind of description thereof; A man breaketh
  Wedlocke, and thinketh thus in his heart, Who seeth me? I am compassed
  about with darkenesse,
                  
                     Eccle. 23.18.
                  the walls ouer mee, no bodie seeth mee, whom need I to feare? But the
  truth is, That Walls haue eyes as well as eares; besides, the eyes of the Lord
  are ten thousand times brighter than the Sunne, beholding all the wayes of men,
  the ground of the deepe, and the most secret parts. And this man that thinks
  himselfe so close and so cunning that no eye can find him out, shall bee
  punished in the streets of the Citie, and shall be chased like a young
  horse-Foale, and when hee thinketh not vpon it, he shall be taken: thus shall
  he be put to shame of euerie man, because hee would not vnderstand the feare
  of the Lord. Saint Augustine saith, That none seeke to carrie these
  kind of businesses more secretly and more cunningly, than your married woman,
  that hath a care of her reputation and honor; but she also, for all her slie
  cariage, shall bee brought out into the Congregation, and examination shall
  bee made of her children; her children shall not take root, and her branches
  shall bring forth no fruit; a shameful report shal she leaue, and her reproch
  shall not bee put out. Salomon after hee had made mention of foure
  things that left no signe behind them, nor were to be traced out, or followed
  by the track; to wit, The way of an Eagle flying through the ayre; of a
  Serpent gliding through the Rock; of a ship sailing through the sea; &amp; of
  the wayes of a young man in his youth; hee further addeth, Talis est via
  mulieris adulterae, The way of an Adulteresse may verie well be likened
  vnto these, for that great artifice and cunning wherewith she dissembleth this
  her treacherie, as being only priuie to this her foule play, and wiping her
  lips, she sits downe full gorged at her husbands boord, and tells him that shee
  will fast, contenting her selfe with bread and water; to the end that by this
  her fasting and leading a godly life, shee may gaine a good report, and be free
  from the razors of malicious tongues: but in the end, (as before we haue said)
  Nihil occultum quod non reueletur, Nothing so secret which shall not be
  reuealed. For Sinne euermore leaues a print behind it, like those
  footsteps of Baals Priests; those steps of our forefather
  Adam; that coare of the cut Apple that choaked all Mankind; and those
  crummes and reliques of their feastings, who said, Nulium sit pratum quod
  non pertranseat l
                        •
                     xuria nostra, Let
  there be no meadows in which our ryot may not reuell. The Deuill, who
  assures vs most  of secrecie, takes off this cloake which
  he casteth ouer vs, and discloseth these our secret sinnes, when he hath a mind
  to open our shame. Dauid beeing a wise and discreet King, tooke
  extraordinarie care for the concealing of his adulterie; Forsitan tenebrae
  conculcabunt me, tu fecisti abscondite: hee carried the businesse so
  closely, that he thought it should not be discouered; but by those Letters that
  he wrote vnto the Generall of his Armie, That he should put Vrias in
  the forefront of the battaile, and where the greatest danger of death was;
  Ioab smelt out Dauids drift, and shewed the Kings Letter to
  some of his Captaines; who did blaspheme God, for that he had set a King ouer
  them, who for to satisfie his lust, set so little by the life of so braue and
  valiant a Souldier, and so seruiceable as Vrias was, and so well
  deseruing of his Maiestie.
               
                  Sin cannot bee concealed frō God.The
  second, That though a sinne be kept secret from the eyes of men, yet is it not
  possible that it should bee hid from the all-seeing eye of God. The Sunne
  hath not so cleere an eye-sight as God hath; The Sunne pierceth into the
  bowells of the earth, it discouereth the bottome of the Deepe: in the one he
  hath certaine Shops or Worke-houses, wherein gold, siluer, and pretious stones
  are wrought; in the other, Pearle, and diuers other rich commodities, as
  Corall, Amber, and the like. But although the Sun reacheth to the vtmost
  corners of the earth, and the most hidden secret places of this Vniuerse, by
  his vertue and heat; yet are there many which he cannot come neere vnto with
  his light and splendor: but from the eyes of God there is not that veine or
  least crannie in the earth, nor that shell, though neuer so small in the sea,
  that can hide it selfe; Sicut tenebra eius, ita &amp; lumen eius, As the
  darkenesse is his, so is the light also. In that beginning when God
  created the World, he diuided the night from the day, and the light from
  darkenesse: but this was done for humane eyes; but to those diuiner eyes there
  is no night at all, and innumerable are those places of Scripture which prooue
  the truth hereof vnto vs.
               The third, That God many times affoords vs a greater fauour in
  publishing a secret sinne, than in letting it lie hid and reserued against the
  day of Wrath, for our eternall and publique confusion.Sin
 while it is hid, more dangerous to the Soule, than when it is
 discouered. The Schoolemen make a question, Which is the more grieuous,
  the publique or the secret sinne? and it is a plain case, that the publique
  carries with it more grieuous circumstances of scandal, harme, and infection;
  and therefore Dauid stiles it a Plague or Pestilence: but the secret
  sin is always more dangerous, because it is in some sort incurable; there is no
  neighbour to admonish thee of it, no witnesse to denunciate against thee, nor
  no judge to punish thee for it, nor no Prelat to reprehend thee therefore; for
  sinne once reprehended in persons that haue any shame in them in the world,
  turnes to amendment. Saint Augustine reports in his
  Confessions, That his mother had two Maid seruants, one a well growne
  wench, the other a little girle; and that when they went for Wine to the
  Tauerne, the bigger would drinke a good heartie draught, the lesser did but sip
  a little; but by sip after sip she grew by degrees to be a good proficient: and
  falling out one day before their mistresse, the bigger complained of the
  lesser, That she did drinke vp the Wine; whereof shee was so ashamed, that she
  would neuer after so much as offer to take it. Publique sins, all labour to
  amend: When a house is on fire, there is not that Tyler or Carpenter, or any
  neere dweller, but will hast in and helpe all they can to quench it. Secret
  sinnes are like a smokie fire, which lies smothering &amp; not flaming forth,
  wasts and consumes inwardly: and this is the cause that it is conserued and
  continued like a secret Impostume, which occasioneth our death because it
  cannot be cured.
                     Iosh 7. Vpon Achans
  sinne they did cast lots by Tribes, by households, and 
  by particular persons; and when the Delinquent was discouered, Ios
                        ••
                     ah sayd, Giue thankes vnto God, that thy sin is
  brought to light and made knowne to the world, and that thou shalt smart for it
  in this life; for had it beene kept secret, thy punishment had beene immortall.
  Dauids Adulterie being brought forth vpon the open stage, [In
  consp
                        ••
                     tu Solis huius] and
  Nathans reproouing him for it, was the future occasion of all his
  good. It could not chuse, to this adulterous woman that was thus taken in the
  manner [Con el hurto en las manos, with the theft, as they say, in her
  hand,] but be a wonderful griefe &amp; vexation, that shee should be carried
  publiquely through the streets, all the boyes of the Citie hooting at her, men
  and women poynting at her with the finger, and crying shame vpon her, and that
  at last she must be brought into the Temple, and there be set in the middest
  of that reuerend Auditorie and Assemblie, as a spectacle of shame and infamie.
  But the opening of this her wound, was the curing of it; this which shee
  thought was her ruine, was her remedie; &amp; this her marring was her making.
  The World held her to be a most vnhappie woman; for there being so many
  Adulteresses in the Citie, Whorings had ouerspread the land, and bloud had
  touched bloud; that this flash of lightning should light vpon her
  alone,
                     Hose. 4. and that this sudden
  thunder-clap should not onely voyce her dishonour, but her death. Whereas the
  Adulterer was by all adiudged to be a happie and a fortunate man, that by good
  hap he had escaped out of the hands of Iustice, either by flight, or greasing
  the Officers in the fist. Others stickt not to say, Siempre quiebra la
  soga, por lomas del gado; the weakest still goes to the wall: howsoeuer,
  the more certaine truth is, That she was happie, and the Adulterer
  vnfortunate.
               The fourth, That euerie sinne is to bee made publique either in
  this present life, or in the life to come; and this sayth the aforesaid Letter,
  Nihil opertum quod non reueletur; and not onely publique notice to be
  taken thereof, but to bee accompanied also with shame and confusion. And this
  the Scripture prooueth vnto vs in many places; and for the amending of these
  two mischiefes there is no meanes so powerfull, as to haue recourse to
  repentance; from whence proceed these two effects:
               The one, That it couers our sinnes, Blessed are they whose
  sinnes are forgiuen, and whose iniquities are couered.
               
               The other, That it doth blot them out of Gods rememberance,
  according to that of Ezechiel, At what houre soeuer a Sinner shall repent
  him, I will no longer be mindfull of his sinne.
               
            
            
               Haec mulier modo deprehensa est in adulterio.
               
                  This woman was taken in adulterie in the verie act,
  &amp;c.
                  Mans disrespect is oft an occasion of the
 womans fall. All these words carrie w
                     •
                  th them a kind of emphasis which indeere the aggrauation of the
  Accusation, Haec mulier: For howbeit the sin of adulterie may be
  greater perhaps in the husband, by giuing by his little respect and his bad
  example, occasion to his wife to play the Whore. [For as Thomas saith,
  He that treateth with another mans wife, se &amp; suam discrimini
  exponi
                        •
                     , exposeth himselfe and
  his own wife to a great deale of hazard▪ because he soweth bitternesse in
  the marriage bed, contrarie to that rule of Saint Paul, Husbands loue your
  wiues, and be not bitter vnto them. For which cause they tooke out the
  gall from that beast which was sacrificed by married men vnto Iuno,
  for that the Head (which is the man) ought to be obliged to more continency, to
  more vertue, to more wisedome, &amp; more fortitude, as Saint
  Augustine tells vs] yet notwithstanding, this fault is held fouler in
  the woman. Eccle

                     he getteth shame to her
  selfe, and her reproch  shall neuer be blotted out.
  I know not whence it comes to passe, that the remembrance thereof is so soone
  blotted out in man, and that it should sticke by a woman all the dayes of her
  life.
               
                  Adultery how punished in former
 times.
                  She was taken now. Now, euen in the nick: it is not a sin
  of any antient standing, it cannot plead prescription, that it was so many
  yeares since, or time as they say out of mind: for time doth either couer or
  lessen the offence; or it may be pleaded, that it was formerly punished. But
  this is not a quarter of an houre old, now, euen now did we take her in the
  manner, In adulterio, in the verie act of adulterie. And here
  notifying the same vnto our Sauiour Christ, they fall a aggrauating the
  heinousnesse of the offence; and this is prooued vnto vs by foure forcible
  arguments.
               The first, That there were punishments ordained against
  Adulterers by all Nations whatsoeuer.
               Some did burne them aliue, if we may beleeue Lucian; so
  the Philistines burned Sampsons Spouse; and so Iudah gaue
  order to haue his daughter in law T
                        •
                     mar burned.
               Some againe did vse to quarter them; and Euclides makes
  mention of a King that executed this law vpon his owne sonne.
               Others pluckt out their eyes, as Valerius reporteth
  it.
               And others did whip them and cut off their noses, as
  Siculus stories it of the Aegyptians.
               Others (saith Caelius) did hang them.
               Others did stone them to death, and that was Moses his
  Law.
               Others did tie them to two trees, which beeing bowed downe by
  violence, letting them suddenly goe, did with a jerke rent one limbe from
  another, &amp;c.
               Hence may bee argued Gods chasticement; Per me Legum
  conditores iusta decernunt.
                  
                     Prou. 6.
                  Salomon saith, That as it is not possible that a man should carrie
  fire in his bosome, and his cloathes not be burnt, or goe vpon coles, and his
  feet not be burnt; no more is it possible, that a man should lie with another
  mans wife, and that the justice of God should not take hold of him. And
  therefore it is sayd, Non erit mundus cum tetigerit
  
                        •
                     am, He that goeth in to his
  Neighbors wife shal not be innocent, whosoeuer toucheth her: The Hebrew letter
  hath it, Innocent, indemnis: The Septuagint render it, Insons,
  impunitus. So that for other our sins, it may be God will let vs escape
  vnpunished; but in matter of adulterie, let no man expect the like fauour. And
  therefore hee commaunded, That in the Sacrifice of the Adulteresse they should
  haue no Oyle; to signifie, that it was a fault that deserued little or no
  mercie.
               
                  The foulnesse of this sin, and how heinously
 the Saints haue thought of it.The second Argument of aggrauation is,
  that many of the Saints haue giuen to Adulterie the name of the greatest and
  foulest offence. Philon sayth of it, Ad
                        ••
                     
                     terium malificiorum maximum, Of all wickednesse
  Adulterie is the worst. Cornelius Tacitus affirmeth the like in his
  Annals. Pope Clement reporteth, That Saint Peter
  was often woont to say, Quid in omnibus peccatis Adulterio grauius?
  That amongst all the sinnes there was not any more heinous than Adulterie.
  Iob by way of hyperbole breatheth out this,
                     Iob. 31. 
                  If I haue sought to betray my friend,
  and haue layd wait at the dore of my neighbor, let my wife grind vnto another
  man, and let other men bow downe vpon her. In the Booke of Iudges
  it is called Magnum nefa

                  A villenie,
  the like was neuer committed in Israell. And a little before, Adulterie is
  sayd to bee Iniquitas maxima. And a great proofe of this truth is, the
  comparing of it with other 
                     •
                  innes,
  and the heynousnesse wherewith they qualifie it aboue the rest. The murdering
  of 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  
  seemed a lesse sinne to Dauid than his adulterie with
  Bersheba. And Saint Chrysostome prooues this out of that act
  of Abrahams, who intreated Saraah to giue out, that she was
  his sister; for if it should be knowne that she was his wife, making lighter
  of murder than adulterie, they would not sticke to kill him.
                     Dan. 13. 
                  Susanna esteemed lesse of
  death, than the dishonour to her selfe and her house. Homer stories
  it of Vlysses, That when he was absent from his wife
  Penelope, hee was solicited and earnestly layd at by Circes
  the Sorceresse, who promised to make him immortall: and howbeit hee did verily
  beleeue that shee was able to make good her word, yet did he lesse reckon of
  immortalitie, than of committing adulterie. Salomon proues, That
  theeuing is a lesse offence; for many men steale meerely out of pure hunger,
  vt esurientem impleant animam, that their hungrie soules may be
  satisfied. But the Adulterer hath no excuse at all; the Theefe may make
  satisfaction, Reddet septuplum, He shall restore seuen fold; the Law
  requires no more of him: but the Adulterer, with all that hee hath, is not able
  to make satisfaction; all the wealth and lands that a man hath, cannot ballance
  (bee they neuer so heauie) the wrong that is done by an Adulterer. In a word,
  The sinne of Adulterie is without all question of all other sinnes the
  greatest. Summus saeculi reatus, Tertullian calls it. Saint
  Cyprian, Summum delictum. And yet the Scripture confounds these two,
  and stiles Idolatrie, Adulterie: As in that of Hosea, Omnes adulterantur,
  quasi clibanus succensus, They ha
                        •
                     e
  all committed adulterie,
                  
                     Osee 7.
                  they haue runne a whoring after strange gods, and are all as hot as an
  ouen. Saint Hierome vnderstanding here vpon this place, The
  Idolaters, &amp;c.
               The third argument is, The harme which insues vpon this sinne:
  Clemens Alexandrinus termes Adulterie, Pestem maximam. Iob,
  a fire that sweeps all away, makes hauocke and ruine both of root and tree, and
  euerie branch thereof, omnia eradicans germina, Rooting out all the
  Plants, euen to the children and nephews.

                        •
                     . Such adulterated Plants
  (saith Wisedome) though they take deepe rooting, and spread abroad
  their branches, yet shall they not inioy any stabilitie or firmnesse. The Roman
  Emperours made good proofe hereof, for such as were giuen to Adulteries, neuer
  saw any succession of their owne. The like did Herod, who robbed his
  brother Abimileck of his wife: and so diuers others. Filij tui

  are neuer ingraffed into any other Tree. And the Church, though she be so
  cockering and indulgent a mother, doth disfauour them and reprooue them.
               The fourth &amp; last is, Natures dislike therof,Adulterie disalowed euen by Nature. which thinks her selfe
  extreamly wronged and iniured thereby; Which seemeth much to aggrauate the
  qualitie of the offence.
               First, In the men; who perhaps though they doe not come thereby
  to bee infamous, yet they are not able with all that they haue, to recompence
  this so foule an affront; so saith Salomon. Alexander writing to his
  mother Olympias,
                  
                     Prou. 6.35. stiles
  himselfe the sonne of Iupiter; but therein he exceedingly wronged his
  mother, in making her an Adulteresse, though it were by the greatest Deitie of
  Heauen.
               Secondly, In the beasts, in whom there is a resentment of
  
                     •
                  his wrong. In which kind,
  Plinie, Aeli
                        ••
                     , and diuers
  other Historians tell strange tales.
               But aboue all, God holds himselfe therein greatly offended;
  especially this sinne being committed by Christians.
               First, Because Matrimonie is a Mysterie, which represents the
  vnion of the marriage of God with his Church. And for this cause God calls them
  both but one flesh; They are
  
                        〈◊〉
                      more twaine, but one flesh,

                     sunder 
   
                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                      
                      
                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                      
                      that which God hath coupled together. Where if you
  note it, hee speakes in the singular; for o
                     •
                  herwise they would not conueniently represent so strict a
  vnion.
               Secondly, Because God is the authour of marriage; God created
  man and woman, and being wedded each to other, he said, For this cause
  shall man lea
                        •
                     e father and mother,
  and cleaue vnto his wife. And for Dauid his adulterie, the Lord
  said vnto him,2. Reg. 2. 
                  The Sword shall
  neuer depart from thy house, because thou hast despised me, and taken the wife
  of Vriah the Hittite to be thy wife; it was not Vriah, but I th
                        ••
                      was despised. Where I would haue
  thee to weigh well the word Me, who in the beginning of the world did
  authorise marriage; Me, who in the Law of Grace was personally present at my
  friends marriage, and there vnfolded the sailes of my Omnipotencie, working
  there and at that wedding my first miracle. S. Paul saith, If the
  husband be of the houshold of the Faithfull, and the wife of the Vnfaithfull,
  non dimittat illam, let him not forsake her: but if she shall be
  vnfaithfull to her husband,1. Cor. 7. he
  may lawfully then leaue her. So that God seemeth to be more offended, that she
  should not keep her faith toher husband, than that she should not professe the
  Faith of Christ.
               
                  But this they said to tempt him. They put on a shew of
  zeale, and feigned a dissembled desire of knowledge, and to be satisfied
  concerning this point: but the truth was, that they went a fishing, to see if
  they could catch our Sauiour in some answer that he should giue them contrarie
  to the Law, to the end that they might accuse him as a Transgressour. The
  Scribes they were jealous of their Law, the Pharisees of their Religion; the
  one sought to picke a hole in his coat vpon some quirke and quiller of the Law;
  the other, for the wronging of their Religion: and therefore they said vnto
  him, Seeing thou art a Master, to whom it belongeth to expound our Lawes, and
  that thou takest vpon thee at euerie bout to vnfold Moses his meaning;
  Moses law commandeth, That such should bee stoned;
                     Leuit. 20. Deut. 22. What sayst thou
  therefore? Euthimius saith, That they tooke our Sauiour Christ to be
  so mercifull a minded man, that they did well hope that hee would wrest and
  wind the Law which way he listed, if not vtterly ouerthrow it. And they did
  ground these their suspitions vpon some Sermons of his which he had preached,
  wherein he had deliuered to the People, That it was lawfull to cure the Sicke
  on the Sabboth day; which was a new kind of doctrine in their Law. Saint
  Gregorie and Saint Ambrose doe both affirme, That they did
  verily persuade themselues, That our Sauiour Christ could not chuse but
  
                     •
                  e caught in the trap, and
  necessarily fall into an errour, one while by pardoning contrarie to the Law;
  another while by condemning, contrarie to Grace.
            
            
               Iesus autem inclinans se deorsum.
               
                  But Iesus stooped downe, inclining his head towards the
  ground. Saint Chrysostome saith, That for the Pharisees it was a
  most seuere act of Iustice; but for the Adultresse, a most noble act of mercie.

  tuum? All my happinesse consists in those thy  eyes,
  and to denie them vnto me, is to vse me like an enemie.
               Towards the Adulteresse our Sauior carried himselfe as became a
  soueraigne Prince; for it is a common thing with Kings and Princes, to turne
  their eyes aside from a woman that is shamelesse and of a lewd and infamous
  life; the sight of a husband is a fearefull thing to a wanton wife, so is the
  eye of a seuere father to a gracelesse sonne, so the austere looke of a King
  to his seruant that hath played the Traitor: how then shall Gods countenance
  skare vs, when hee shall looke askew vpon vs, and knit the brow of his heauie
  displeasure? When the Adultresse did behold her selfe in that Crystall Glasse,
  Christ Iesus, in whome there was no spot nor least specke of blemish in the
  world, and did see what a freckled soule she had of her owne, how foulely
  bespeckled with a loathsome morphew of this ouerspreading sinne; In what a
  confusion must she needs bee, and how dasht out of countenance? Dauid
  was as valiant a King, and as braue a soldier as euer drew sword, &amp; one
  that fought the Lords battels; yet he considering the foulnesse of this his
  adulterous sin, weeping &amp; sorrowing for the same, when he saw Gods eye was
  fixed on his fault, and that hee had withdrawne his woonted fauor from his
  person, he felt such torment in himselfe, that in the bitternesse of his soule
  he was forced to crie out, Turne away thy face, ô Lord, from my
  sinnes. What then should this weake, this poore and wretched woman do in
  this case?
               
                  Iesus stooped downe. Saint Cyril saith, That
  our Sauiour herein did aduise your Iudges, that before they proceed to
  sentence, they should well and truly consider of the cause alone by themselues,
  and proceed with a great deale of leisure &amp; deliberation. Before that God
  did condemne the pride of those that built the Tower of Babell, he said,
  Descendam &amp; videbo, I will goe downe and see what they doe. And
  the crie of the sinnes of Sodome comming to his eares, hee sayd the same
  againe: for there is no wisdome nor discretion in it, as Nicodemus
  said, to condemne a man, Vnlesse he first heare him speake for
  himselfe,
                  
                     Iohn 7.51. 
                  and know what
  hee hath done. This is that which Dauid said, Doe righteous
  iudgement, ô ye sons of men. Suting with that of our Sauior,
  Iudge not according to the face or outward appearance. Daniel
  summarily shuts it vp all in this, The Iudgement was set, and the Bookes
  opened.
                  
                     Dan 7.
               
               
                  He stooped downe. For albeit a Iudge ought to beare
  himselfe vpright,Iudges must incline to mercie. yet
  he ought still to stoope and incline himselfe to mercie. Christ looked downe
  vpon the earth, and considered with himselfe, that he had made this woman of
  earth. If a Iudge may euen in justice saue a Delinquent, if hee shall find a
  way open for mercie; he may comfort himselfe, that it is Gods fashion so to
  doe, and this may be his warrant. Elisha said vnto Elias, by
  way of petition, I pray thee let thy Spirit be doubled vpon me: This
  was a hard suit. Theodoret askes the question,
                     Ob.
                   Wherein the difficultie did consist? And he
  answereth,
                     Sol.
                   That it did not consist in
  miracles, nor in grace, but in that Elias his Spirit was so sharpe and
  so bitter: I destroyed the Israelites with fire from Heauen, and punished that
  people with three yeres famine; if my spirit should be doubled vpon thee, vpon
  the like occasion thou wouldst consume them all, and make an end of them at
  once.
               
                  He lift vp himselfe. When he was to giue sentence he
  stood vp; for albeit a Iudge should in the medijs incline vnto mercie,
  yet in principio, and in fine, hee ought to deale vprightly,
  and exercise integritie. Let a Iudge vse a Delinquent with a great deale of
  courtesie and sweetnesse, let him seeke out all the meanes that he can, to saue
  him and to set him free; but in the apprehending of him, and the sentencing of
  him, let him be vpright and sound in that hee shall resolue vpon; 
   And in point of Iustice, let not the beame of the
  ballance lean aside, nor his fancie ouersway him, nor any feare of great mens
  displeasure terrifie him. Gratious an
                        •
                      righteous is the Lord,
                  
                     Psal.
 25. 
                  therefore will he teach sinners in the way. The Lord as he
  is sweet and gratious, so is he vpright and iust; and therefore it is fit that
  a Iudge should not onely know the Law, but should also sincerely execute the
  Law, not interpreting the same according to his owne pleasure, but according to
  reason and equitie.
               
                  With his finger he wrote on the ground. All that
  comment vpon this place, do agree in this, That he wrote in this manner, and
  why he did it:
               And first of all, Saint Hierome saith, That hee wrote
  on the ground the sins of those that had accused this Adultresse: According to
  that of Ieremie, They that depart from thee shall be written in the
  earth;
                  
                     Ierem. 17.13. their names shall
  not bee registred in the booke of Life: wherewith he left them confounded and
  ashamed, and did prooue thereby vnto them, that they had neither any zeale to
  the Law, nor any desire to obserue the same. This was a blazoning forth of the
  honour and glorie of our Sauiour Christ, beyond that of the Romans; here was a
  parcere subiectis to the purpose; and a debellare superbos
  with a witnesse. And whereas the Scribes and Pharisees set vpon him in this
  their pride and brauerie, when they saw their own sinnes set downe before their
  eyes (which to a Sinner is a terrible and most fearefull sight) they let fall
  their plumes, and hung downe their heads for shame, being so basely deiected,
  as none could be more. I will lay all thy abhominations before thee;
  O, this is a sad and heauie spectacle, What humane eye can indure to behold
  them? especially when God shal raise vp our old sinnes, which we thought had
  beene forgotten and buried in the pit of obliuion. O, how true is that of
  Ieremie, and how pat to our present purpose, The yoke of my
  transgressions is bound vpon his hand, they are wrapped and come vp about my
  necke. My heauie sinnes are continually before his eyes, as he that tieth
  a thing to his hand for a remembrance; the horrour whereof hath made my
  strength to fall. What a dismall thing is it, to see those my wickednesses
  which I thought had beene quite out of his remembrance, and that he had cast
  them behind his backe, to be brought before my face, and he to hold the
  beadroll of them in his hand, written in great capitall letters,
  Circumuoluta sunt in manu eius, like a piece of corke vnder a clew of
  thred. Esay paints forth certaine impudent and shamelesse Sinners, and
  presently anon after saith, Their destruction is written downe, and when I
  see my time I will speake thereof.
                  
                     Iob.
 13. O how doth Iob complaine hereof, Thou writest bitter
  things against me, and makest me to possesse the iniquities of my youth.
  He calls these bitter things, the sinnes of his youth. Saint
  Chrysostome saith, That hee borrowed this metaphor from a Iudge, who
  takes the penne in his hand for to pronounce sentence, setting downe the
  offences of the Delinquent. And therfore Iob saith, I see that thou
  lookest narrowly vnto my paths, as though thou wouldest pronounce sentence
  against mee. And therefore Saint Hierome saith, That Christ wrote on
  the ground. And as a Iudge exposeth a Butcher to publique shame, by hanging his
  false weights about his necke; so thou, ô Lord, hauing readie written in
  thy hand the yoke of my transgressions, thou exposest mee to shame, by wrapping
  them about my necke.
               Saint Ambrose sayth, that our sauiour wrote that which
  Ieremy prophecied of Ieconiah, Terra, terra, s
                        •
                     r be hos viros abdicatos, O Earth,
  earth, write these men destitute,
                  
                     Ierem.
 22. 
                  &amp;c. And in one of his Epistles he sayth, Thou seest a
  moat in thy neighbours eye, but not the beame that is in thine owne. A late
  Commentator hath this note hereupon, That our Sauior wrote downe the sinnes of
  this Adulteresse,  that he might see them satisfied;
  bearing himselfe like a pittifull Iudge, who freeth a poore debtor, but takes a
  note of the debt that is to bee payd; Wholly to forgiue the same, the party not
  beeing satisfied, could not stand well with his Iustice; and to condemne her
  wholly, could not sute well with his Mercie. And therefore he was bound to pay
  the debt for her. Supra dorsum meum fabricauerunt peccatores. Another
  letter sayes, Scripserunt. He entred into bond for vs all. But
  although it be most certain, that he wrote some letters, or some sentence,
  against the sinnes of these her accusers (and therefore the Greeke text sayth,
  Hoc digito scribebat in terra) yet what that was which hee then writ,
  there is no certaintie thereof. And it is a great indicium or token
  that they did not well vnderstand those Characters, because vpon that writing
  they did not depart and goe their way. But vpon those words which our Sauiour
  afterwards said vnto them, Qui sine peccato est, Let him that is without
  sinne, And presently thereupon the Euangelist addeth, Audientes haec
  vnus post alium abijt, That hearing these things, they went their way one after
  the other.
               
               Secondly, Saint Austen saith, That he wrote on the
  ground, for to signifie that the names of the Accusers were not writ in Heauen.
  Alluding vnto that which he said vnto his Disciples; Reioyce, because your
  names are written in heauen. Or, for to show that it was he himselfe,
  which with his own finger had writ the Law in those Tables of stone; and
  withall to intimate, that the new Law was not to bee written in ragged stone,
  but in fruitfull ground; not in the roughnesse of the Law, but in the softnesse
  of Grace. And Saint Ambrose in the Epistle formerly alledged, doth in
  a manner repeat the verie same words. So that by all these circumstances, it
  plainely appeareth that hee noted them out to bee transgressours of the Law,
  and to bee such a kind of people that had not the feare of God before their
  eyes, beeing neither iust in their Iudgements, nor mercifull in their
  Workes.
               
                  Let him that is without sinne, &amp;c. He had recourse
  to the rigour of the Law, by condemning the Adulteresse to be stoned to death,
  which was an infamous kind of death, Achan, Naboth, those false Iudges
  that wronged Susanna, and good Saint Steuen suffered in this
  kind. He had recourse likewise vnto his mercy, by absoluing her of this her
  sinne. For their condemning of her to be stoned, who were faultie in the same
  kind themselues, was a kind of absoluing her. And this limitation (as Saint
  Cyrill hath obserued it) was iuridicall, and according vnto Law. For
  as she was to be stoned by the Law, so she was to be stoned according to the
  Law; But the Lawes doe not permit that the transgression of the Law, should
  bee righted by those that are transgressours of the Law. So that when our
  Sauiour sayd, Let him that is among you without sinne cast the first stone
  at her; hee vnderstood by sinne in that place, the sinne of Adulterie, for
  otherwise it had beene contrariam actionem intentare, and the
  reconuention had not beene so strong and forcible. When the Pharisees found
  fault with Christs Disciples for their not washing of their hands, he retorted
  their owne weapon vpon them with a Quare &amp; vos? And here treating
  with him touching this womans Adulterie, hee giues them this answere, Qui
  sine peccato est, &amp;c. Saint Austen makes a question, whether
  the Adulterer himselfe were there or no? And his resolution is, that the rest
  were there. So that in the Accusers there were two foule faults to be found,
  which are inexcusable.
               The one to let goe a Delinquent for particular interest, and
  priuate gaine, as wee read in the Maccabees, of Ptolomeus his
  freeing of Menelaus from his accusation, notwithstanding he was the
  cause of all the mischiefe wherewith he was  charged, and
  a man that deserued death in the highest degree: the Text there saying, that
  he was Vniuersae malitiae reus.
               
               The other, That they who should haue beene preseruers of the
  Commonwealth, and maintainers of Iustice, should be the Caterpillars of the
  Commonwealth, and the ouerthrowers of Iustice.
               And if any bodie shall aske me, how they being faultie
  themselues, should dare to accuse this woman of the same crime. Saint
  Austen in his Confessions renders this answere, Fortis inscriptio,
  quam nulla deleuit iniquitas. Though God hath pri
                     •
                  ted with such deepe letters in the paper of our
  Consciences, the hatefulnesse of sinne; yet notwithstanding those many sinnes
  of our owne, wee will not forbeare to condemne other mens sinnes, though we be
  faultie of the same our selues. A Merchant apprehends a poore petty Theefe,
  brings him before a Iustice, and causes him to be whipt, not considering that
  himselfe is the greater Theefe of the two. Diogenes told the Iudges
  and other subordinate Ministers of Iustice, That the greater Theeues did hang
  the lesser. Dauids adulterie beeing put in the third person,2. Reg. 12. hee told the Prophet Nathan,
  As the Lord liueth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die,
  Filius mortis est. How doest thou condemne that in another, which thou
  dissemblest and smootherest in thy selfe; Fortis inscriptio, quam nulla
  deleuit iniquitas. Absalon had a great Councellor called Achitophel;
  Dauid had another as wi
                     •
                  e as
  hee, called Cushai: now when Cushai saw that
  Achitophel tooke part with Absalon, he said vnto
  Dauid, I doe not so much feare thy sonne, as this Councellour of his;
  for he hath a shrewd pestilent pate of his owne: wherefore I thinke it verie
  fit, That by your Maiesties leaue I should get me likewise to the Campe, to see
  if I can ouerthrow his councell. Thither he hasted, and kneeling downe before
  Absalon, he said vnto him, I am come vnto thee, because I see that
  God doth fauour thee; and I had rather worship the Sunne rising, than setting.
  Thy father is old, &amp;c. Notwithstanding all this, Absalon titted
  him in the teeth, saying, Is this thy loue to thy friend? Where it is
  to be noted, That though the Sonne had rebelled against his Father, yet it
  seemed ill vnto him, that a Seruant should bee false to his Master; Fortis
  inscritpio, quam nulla deleuit iniquitas.
               
               
                  Satisfaction must goe before
 absolution.
                  Woman, Where are those thine accusers? Hath no man
  condemned thee? Before that he would absolue her, he would infrome
  himselfe, Whither any bodie did accuse her or no? For as long as any partie
  found himselfe agrieued, his absolution was of no force. If the oppressing of
  the Poore crie for vengeance, What shall the dishonouring of a Virgine, and the
  adulterated bed doe? And therefore this Memento is giuen thee before
  thou offer thy Sacrifice, Thou shalt call to mind, whither thy brother haue
  any thing against thee or no: First make attonement with thy brother, and
  then present thy Offering to God. Abimelech crauing pardon for his
  offence,
                     Gen. 20. God said vnto him,
  Deliuer the man his wife againe; This must be done first.
               
                  No man, Lord. And Iesus said, Neither doe I condemne
  thee. It is a great happinesse in a Sinner,Mercie an
 argument of goodnesse, in whomsoeuerit be found. Hosea 11. to
  fall into the hands of God. Man, the wickeder hee is, the crueller he is; and
  the more ill, the lesse pittifull. But God, by how much the more good he is, by
  so much he is the more mild and mercifull; I will not destroy Ephraim in my
  furie, because I am God, and not Man. There was not that man then, that
  would haue borne with Ephraim, nor excused his backeslidings: But I am God, and
  therefore patient, long suffering, and full of goodnesse. Daniel when
  he was put in the Lyons den, the King commanded the doore to be sealed with his
  owne seale, Ne quid fieret contra Danielem, Lest they should change
  their purpose  concerning Daniel, and plot some
  other villanie against him; conceiuing the hands of these men to bee lesse
  secure than the clawes and teeth of those hungrie Lyons.2.
 Reg. 24. And this was the reason why Dauid when hee
  was to take his option of those three Scourges which God had set before him to
  make choice of, vpon that vanitie of his in numbring the People, either Famine,
  War, or Pestilence; flying from the hands of men, hee would by no meanes admit
  of Warre or Famine, but of the Pestilence, that he might wholly put himselfe
  into the hands of God. God of his infinite goodnesse, &amp;c.

               OVr Sauiour Christ, in that matter of multiplying the loaues and
the fishes, prouiding for the necessitie of those people that did follow him,
wrought two miracles as famous as they were cheerefull.
            In the one, he gaue food to foure thousand persons, besides women
and children, with seuen loaues &amp; a few fishes, and they beeing all
satisfied, there were twelue baskets full remaining. This miracle is mentioned
by Saint Mathew and Saint Marke.
            
            In the other, That which the Church doth this day solemnise, which
was the more famous, not onely for that the guests were fiue thousand, besides
women and children, the loaues fiue, the fishes two, and the leauings twelue
baskets full; but for that all the foure Euangelists wrote thereof; and much
the more, for that it was an occasion (as it is obserued by Saint
Chrysostome) because our Sauiour did preach that excellent Sermon of
the Mount, for whose Doctrine that miracle was most important.
            
               
               After these things our Sauiour went,
&amp;c. Saint Augustine and Saint Hierome are of
opinion, That the occasion of our Sauiours withdrawing of himselfe was, the
death of Iohn Baptist; the ioy for whose birth beeing so generall, it
was not much, that the sorrow for his death should be great. And this sutes
well with that Text of Saint Mathew,
               When the Saints
  either dye, or other
                     •
                  wise depart
  from a places it is much weakned. who reports it to be after the death
of Saint Iohn
               ▪ This his departure thence, shewed his sorrow for
his friends death: but that kingdome had greatest cause to lament and bewaile
Saint Iohn Baptists death, and Christs going from them; for what is a
Kingdome without them. The Saints of God are the force and strength of
Kingdomes, the walles and bulwarkes of Cities, the hedges about a Vineyard, the
foundation to a Building, bones to the bodie, life to the soule, and the chiefe
essence and being of a Commonwealth. And whilest they had Christ and Saint
Iohn among them, there was not any Citie in the world so rich as
that; but the one being dead, and the other hauing left them, Ieremie
might verie well take vp his complaint, and bewaile their miserie and
solitude. Esay treating of the misfortunes that should befall
Shebna the High-Priest, sayth, Auferetur paxillus qui fixus fuerat
in loco fideli, &amp; peribit, quod pependerat ex eo, The Naile that is fastned
in the sure place, shall depart, and shall be broken and fall, and the
burthen that was vpon it shall bee cut off. Now paxillus is that which
in poore mens houses is called the Racke whereon they hang spits, or a shelfe
whereon they set their vessels; which in rich mens houses is called
Aparador, a Court-cupboord, whereon is placed their richest pieces of
plate, and such as are most glorious to the eye. And hereof mention is made in
the one and thirtieth Chapter of Exodus, and the third of
Numbers. But your poorer sort of People, that are not scarce worth a
paire of Rackes, strike in certaine pinnes into the wall; and as the shelfe
falling, all falls with it that depends thereupon, so when the High-Priest
(being a good man) dies, all good perisheth with him in the Commonwealth,
because the chiefe good of the State dependeth thereupon. The Homic
                  •
               de had fiue Cities to flie vnto for
shelter, but hee could not returne home to his owne Countrie till the death of
the High-Priest. And Philon rendring the reason of this interdiction,
saith, That the High-Priest is a Pariente or Kinseman of all those
that liue in his Commonwealth; Qui solum habet ius in viuos &amp; in
mortuo
                     •
                  
               : as euerie Citisen
hath his particular Kinsemen, to whom he owes an obligation, to acknowledge the
benefits he receiues from him, and to reuenge the wrongs that are done to him;
In like manner, the High-Priest is the common Kinseman of the Liuing, to whom
hee owes an Obligation to accord their discords, to cut off their suits in Law,
to quit their wrongs, and to desire the peace and prosperitie of them all. In
conclusion, he being as it were a common father to all, in so great a losse,
in so sencible and generall a sorrow, when a common misfortune should compound
particular wrongs, when all mens hearts are so heauie, their eyes so full of
teares, their minds so discomforted, it is a fit season for a Homicide to
returne home to his Countrie. And if the death of a High-Priest, who happely
was no holy man, causeth in a Commonwealth so generall a griefe; the death of
Iohn Baptist, and our Sauiours departure from this People, What effect
of heartie sorrow ought that to worke? God threatned his People by Esay,
The Lord shall giue you the bread of aduersitie, and the water of
affliction.
               
                  Esay. 30.20. When the King
of Israell commanded Micheas to be cast into prison, hee said vnto
him, Su
                     ••
                  enta tecum pa
                     •
                  e tribulationis, &amp; aqua angustiae,
Feed vpon the b
                     ••
                  ad of
affliction,
               3. Reg. 22. 
               and the
water of affliction. In the Hebrew both places beare the same words: but
Esay afterwards saith, That though Gods hand shall be heauie vpon
them, and that he shall afflict them with many miseries, yet he will not take
away  their Doctors and Teachers from amongst them, nor
the light of his Doctrine. I haue threatned you with the famine of my word,
I will send a famine in the land,
               
                  Hose.
  8.11. 
               not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but of hearing
the Word of the Lord. But God recalls this threatning oftentimes, Et
non faciet auolare à te vltra Doctorem tuum, and will not cause thy
Teacher to flie from thee. But Iohn Baptist being dead, and our
Sauiour withdrawne himselfe, that Countrie could not rest in a more wretched
estate.
            Secondly, The death of Iohn Baptist made him leaue the
land, and put forth to sea, making a seperation betweene him and them: for when
God gets him gone from thy house or thy citie, thou art beaten out of doores
(as they say) with a cudgell; euen then doth a man go turning backe his head,
like a Hart that is hunted and pursued by Hounds, neuer letting him to be at
rest, but chasing him with open mouth from place to place. God cannot absent
himselfe from his Creatures, nor can his immensitie giue way to the vtter
abandoning of this goodly Fabricke, and wonderfull Machina of the
World: yet so great is the hatred which he beares to sinne, that he also
commands vs to get vs out of that Citie where Sinne doth raigne; signifying
thereby vnto vs, That if any thing can make him to absent himselfe from vs, it
is our sinnes. God had his house and his residence in Hierusalem; so sayes
Esay:
                  Esay 31.9. God had his house
and his hearth there, as if hee had beene one of their fellow Citisens, and a
Towne dweller amongst them: but their abhominations made him to abandon that
place. Ezechiel saw the glorie of God how it went by degrees out of
the Temple, staying one while here, &amp; another while there, resting it selfe
now against this pillar, now that, till at last, The glorie of God was
cleane gone out of the Temple. Their abhominations did as it were driue
him out by head and shoulders, &amp; shoov'd him forth by little and
little.
                  Esech. 8.6. 
               The great
abhominations that the House of Israell committeth here, causeth me to depart
from my Sanctuarie. Iosephus in his booke of the Warres of the Iewes
saith, That when Titus and Vespasian came and besieged
Hierusalem, the gates of the Temple flew wide open, in token that their sinnes
had thrust God out from thence. And Cornelius Tacitus addeth, That
they made a great noyse at their opening, in token of his loathnesse and
vnwillingnesse to leaue them: howbeit he spake like a Gentile, hauing reference
to the multitude of their owne gods. The Poets likewise haue feigned, That
Troyes vices were Troyes ruine, and had banished the gods from them; for had
they beene present with them, neither the fire that consumed their Citie, nor
all the power of the Gretians had beene able to haue done them the least harme
in the world: So says Saint Augustine in his bookes De Cinitate
Dei. The Syrians tied their gods to the Alters of their Temples, with
fetters and with chaines. And albeit Saint Chrysostome saith, That
they did vse them as they deserued, yet the intention and purpose of that
People was not to detaine them there as prisoners and malefactors, but onely
to haue them in safe keeping, and to make them sure from getting away from
them; thinking themselues vtterly vndone if they should depriue them of their
presence. W
                     •
                  e vnto them, when I
shall goe from them. If God be with vs, no ill but is good; if God be not
with vs, no good but is ill.
                  Deut. 31.
               Because God was not with me these miseries came vpō me. Sampson as
long as he had God with him, neither Hercules, Milo, nor
Theseus, were comparable vnto him; but when God left him, there was
not any man more cowardly;
                  Iud. 16.20. 
               He
thought to haue escaped as at other times, but he knew not that the Lord was
departed from him.
            
            Saint Marke, renders another reason,
                  Marc. 6.
                     ••
                  . 
               Come yee apart into the Wildernesse and rest
awhile. So great was the number of those that followed him, that hee had
not  any fit place for to giue them entertainement, and
to make them to sit downe and eat. And our Sauior well witting that these his
followers were faint and wearie, he was willing to giue them a little ease
&amp; rest. The soule is a strong and able Spirit, immortall, incorruptible,
vnweariable, like vnto that of the Angells; but the bodie is weake, feeble, and
mortall: It had need in the midst of it's labour to rest it selfe, that it may
returne afresh thereunto. Mens bodies beeing like vnto yron tooles, which being
dull'd with working must be ground a new, that they may haue an edge set vpon
them, and performe their worke the better. In the Statua of
Nebuchadnezzar, the Gold, the Siluer, and the Brasse were lasting
mettalls; but the Clay was not so: And though the stone had not broken it, by
little and little it would haue mouldred away of it selfe. Sambucus
made an Embleme of this subiect. The bow cannot alwayes stand bent; nor the
treble string of a Viall stand still strained to it's highth: Birds cannot
alwayes flye, nor fishes swimme, beasts cannot continually labour, nor the eyes
watch, nor the feete walke, nor the earth, nor the plants thereof still affoord
vs fruit. In a word, Quod caret alterna requie, durabile non est.
Aristotle saith in his Problemes, That he that walketh vpon a plaine euen
ground is wearied more through that vniformitie of motion, than if he went vp
hill and downe hill, which doth giue a greater ease vnto the ioynts and
muscles, &amp;c. In like manner, vniformitie of life is commonly wearisome and
tedious vnto vs, and there is no life which is wholly moulded after one
fashion, that is held happy, vnlesse it inioy some variety. Euen those
exercises which are most sauorie vnto vs, are (if wee doe nothing else) most
wearisome vnto vs. Eating, sleeping, hunting, and gaming, if wee continue them
long, how vnsauorie, and how vnpleasing are they vnto vs? And the reason of it
is, that our nature will by no meanes suffer and indure any continued exercise,
whether it be weightie, or light, but holds it a meere tyrannie, and extreame
crueltie. Ieremie doth complaine, for that in Babylon they did not
allow the Captiue Israelites any time of rest: Our neckes are vnder
persecution, we are wearie and haue no rest. Saint Luke saith,
Oportet semper orare; Saint Paul, Sine intermissione
orate.
               
                  Luk. 11. The one bids vs to pray
continually; The other without ceasing or intermission. But that word
Semper, doth not implie a continuation of time, but a complying of our
obligation, and the full performance of our dutie in that kind. Our Sauiour
Christ therefore, seeing his Disciples were wearie, and being sencible of his
owne wearinesse, when he sate downe to rest himselfe by the Well of Sichar, he
was desirous that they should take their ease, and said vnto them, Come
rest yee a while.

  but to enable vs for further paines.Let no man thinke it strange, that
hee that vndergoes so painefull an office as preaching, should vnbend the bow,
and rest himselfe a while; who onely rests himselfe the more that he may take
the more paines. Whence it is to be noted, that God is so franke and so
liberall, that the Rest that is taken to this end, God puts it to the same
account as his paines-taking, and rewards it as any other the best seruice that
he doth him. So doth Saint Basil expound that verse of Dauid, I
will alwayes giue thankes vnto the Lord,
               
                  Psal.
  34. 
               his praise shall bee in my mouth continually. Now
Dauids thankes giuing, and praising of the Lord, was not continuall;
For, he had his houres of sleeping, of eating, of conuersing with his friends
and seruants, and other his houres of recreation; but because those houres of
taking this his ease and rest, were directed to the better inabling him to
serue God, God accounts of them as if they had been continually imployed in his
seruice. True it is, that those houres of our rest and recreations, ought to
bee few, and short, a Requiescite pusillum, Rest a while. A short come
off. Let those that weild the  world, and their ministers
take their rest; but let them rest but a while, for if thou allowest thy selfe
eight houres to sleepe, sixe to play, and foure for to walke, thou robbest thy
obligation of it's true time, and makest those that are suiters, to shed
teares. And this is contrarie to Christs doctrine, and condemnes it in thee,
when he sayth vnto thee, Requiescite pusillum, Rest a while: And here
will I also rest from further prosecuting of this point.
            
               And a great multitude followed him. The Gospel sayth,
That the men that followed him, reckoning those to bee men (which the
Scripture vsually so vnderstandeth) that are from twentie vpward, were to the
number of fiue thousand; S. Vincent Ferrar saith, That with women and
children, they were some fifteene or twentie thousand: neuer any Prince in the
world retyring himselfe into the Desert so well accompanied, and yet so all
alone; so well accompanied, in regard of the multitude of the men; and so all
alone, because all or the most part of this people followed him either out of
necessitie, curiositie, or out of malice. All the Court doth attend and wait
vpon thee, because thou commandest all; but thou art neuer more alone, than
when thou hast most companie: for all those that accompanie thee, are not all
of thy companie; they goe not along with thee, but with themselues, following
thee not so much out of affection, as affectation, more to see thy miracles,
than to receiue thy instructions. The pledges of true friendship indeed, are,
to hazard a mans life for his friend, to condole with him in his miseries, and
to reioyce with him in his happinesse: but since wicked presumption (as
Ecclesiasticus speaketh) hath sprung vp to couer the earth with
deceit,
                  Eccles. 37. and that priuat interest,
like the Iacke-Daw, hath only learned to prattle the language of loue, there is
no trust to be had in these pledges.A true friend hard to
  bee found. There is some friend which is onely a friend in name; and
hast thou not seene, that when heauinesse remaineth vnto death, a companion and
friend hath bin turned to an enemie? There is some companion which in
prosperity reioyceth with his friend, but in the time of trouble is against
him: There is some companion again, that helpeth his friend for the bellies
sake, &amp; taketh vp the buckler against the enemie; There are perhaps
some such, that dare, nay will not sticke to lay downe his life for a good
friend indeed: And there are some likewise, which for their own interest
wil hazard both goods and life, and all that they haue; but if they did thinke
they should faile of their ends, and that it should not turne to their greater
aduantage, they would not venture one farthing, though it were to saue thy
life. When Adoniah vsurped the Kingdome, and proclaimed himselfe
King,3. Reg. cap. 1. the Princes of the
Bloud tooke part with him, Ioab, Dauids Generall, besides diuers other
principall Captaines and Commanders, and most of the valiantest men of Warre,
as also Abiathar the High-Priest: In a word, the Clergie and the
Laitie were both mainly for him; and yet hauing all these on his side, he was
all alone. All the strength of the Armie was not with Adoniah: many
vnderstand this of the Kings Guard; but for our purpose, it may be better
vnderstood of all those who profest themselues to be Adoniahs f
                  •
               iends, but were not true in heart vnto
him, nor did not sticke so close vnto him as they made shew; for they did not
so much respect Adoniah, as their owne ends. The Kings sonnes thought
he would prooue their best brother; the Nobilitie, their best King;
Ioab, that hee would pardon his murdering of Amasa and
Abner, and that hee should hold his place of Generall;
Abiathar, That he would not put him out of the Priesthood, though
there was I know what prophecied to the contrarie. But the proclaiming of
Salomon was no sooner heard, but they left one by one, and went their
wayes, till they had left him like a single proposition to stand alone by
himself, hauing no champion  to make good his Title.
Seneca pressing this Argument, saith, Many Flyes come to the Honie,
many Wolues to the Sheepefold, many Ants to the Wheat; yet the flyes are no
friends to the honie, nor the wolues to the sheepe, nor the ants to the corne:
Nor art thou to esteeme those thy friends that accompanie thee, for they are no
better than flyes, wolues, and ants, which seeke not thee but themselues. And
if thou shouldst but heare, after they haue profest themselues thy friends,
fawn'd vpon thee with flattering tearmes, and vow'd what a deale of loue and
affection they beare vnto thee, what they talke of thee behind thy back, and
what they mutter and whisper of thee in by-corners, thou wouldst then see and
perceiue that all thy prosperitie, is the fable and common by-word of their
wrongs and discontents.
            
               Because they saw his Miracles, which he did on them that were
diseased. All the Miracles of our Sauiour Christ, were directed to the
repayring of our miseries.
            First, for the furthering of our Faith, which depending vpon the
Will, comes by benefits to bee well affectioned thereunto, and to incline to
Knowledge and Vnderstanding.
            The other, To show by sencible signes, the end which caused him to
come into the world, which was to cure our Soules infirmities.
            The third, That it might appeare vnto Man, that the onely motiue
thereunto, was his Mercie.
            Now the Iewes did neither fixe their eyes, nor their thoughts vpon
any one of these; but onely vpon their owne proper ends. Either because hee
should heale them, or fill their bellies. And therefore, albeit some say, that
the Euangelist did set downe this reason, that he might thereby aduise vs,
that our Sauiour was bound as it were to doe that he did, for these people
that followed him, yet I doe rather beleeue, that he set downe this passage, to
giue vs thereby to vnderstand how vnobliged he stood to doe them this so great
a fauour, and how kind hee was of his owne accord, to those that did so ill
deserue any kindnesse at his hands. And therefore hee discouereth their
mindes, layeth open their intentions, and manifesteth their priuate interests.
Because they saw his Miracles, &amp;c.
            
            And therefore Saint Paul saith, He did shut vp all in
vnbeleefe, That is, Hee did permit, that they should all fall into the net
of sinne, that hee remaining wholly disingaged, his obligation should by his
mercie &amp; his pittie of them, be the more esteemed, by how much the more it
was vndeserued.
            
               Quia videbant signa. As if he should haue said, That they
sought rather after meat,A true friend hard to be
  found. than after him that was to giue it them; and therefore hee said
vnto them elsewhere, Yee haue followed me because I haue filled your
bellies, and giuen you fulnesse of bread. For there are some people that
seeke after God for worldly blessings, and neuer thinke vpon him but in time of
want and necessitie, and then if God doe not relieue them, they care not a pin
for him. Elisha was with Ieh
                     •
                  
                  ram,
               3. Reg. 3. and
reprooued him because he neuer sought after him, but in time of hunger and
thirst. Micah went weeping and crying after those that had stolne away
his siluer god, but because hee made vse thereof for his owne priuate interest,
when a greater conueniencie of gaine was offered vnto him,
                  Iud. 18. hee forgot the former, and thought
thereof no more: It is better for thee (sayd they) that thou shouldst bee a
Priest of a whole Tribe, than of one particular House. Philon
commenting vpon Cains answer vnto God, [the Seuentie rendering this
Translation, Si proijcis me à facie tua, à facie tua
abscondar, If thou cast me from off the face of the earth, let me be hid from
thy face] saith, That it was all one as if hee 
should haue said, If thou wilt not bestow vpon mee the blessings of the earth,
keepe those of heauen to thy selfe; if I may not enioy the pleasures &amp;
delights of this world, let vertue and goodnesse for me goe a begging, I care
not for it. Many make vse of God as they doe of a Felt, to defend them from the
Sunne and the raine, which heats and stormes being ouerpast, they hang it vp
against the wall; seruing God as many seruants serue their Masters, not so much
for loue, as gaine. And this ariseth from hence, that they know no other good
saue that which their sences set before them, and this is the marke whereat
they shoot.
            And hence it followeth, that in the predicament of those things
that are good, God of all other is the most disesteemed, and least accounted
of. According to that of Saint Augustine, Omnia diligimus, omnia amamus,
&amp; solus nobis vilis est Deus. For the good of this life, men will doe
much more than they will for God; they will goe I know not how many leagues,
some by sea, others by land, for these temporall respects, but will scarce
stirre a foot out of doores for Gods seruice. If they would but take halfe that
paines for their saluation, as they doe for their damnation, they would all of
them be Sainted in Heauen. Out of the pleasure that some take in hunting, they
care not whither they eat or no for two or three days together; but it goes
against their stomacks to fast but one day for Gods sake. Out of the delight
that some take in play, or in rounding the streets, they will scarce sleepe in
thirtie nights one after another; but will not watch one in humbling themselues
vpon their knees, and praying vnto God: For these worldly vanities they will
not sticke to impawne their whole estate, but it goes against the haire with
them, to spend so much as one poore Royall in Gods seruice. Vpon a Prince, or
the Princes Fauourite, they will make no bones to bestow some great and costly
Present, but grudge to offer vp to God a poore hunger-starued Lambe. Of these
kind of men Malachie much complaineth, Yee offer the lame and the
sicke, and yee snuffe at it when yee haue done,
                  Malach. 1. No labour or cost more tedious to man, than
  that which is bestowed vpon Religion. and thinke yee haue beene at too
great charges with God, as if the worst of your Flocke were not good enough for
him. Caligula gaue to the repairing of the Walls of Rome sixe thousand
Sextercios, which are fifteene thousand Crownes; and vpon one of his
Mistresses hee bestowed as many Sextercios to buy her a Kirtle, making his
Whore equall in cost with the Commonwealth. Tibi soli peccaui, &amp; malum
coram te feci: These words of Dauid are diuersly commented; but
one of the sences vpon that place is this, O Lord I haue onely offended thee,
against thee onely haue I sinned, thee onely haue I despised; I was careful
that the people might not come to the knowledge of this my sinne, and that it
might be hid from Vrias his house; I was more fearefull of mens eyes,
than I was of thine, which are brighter than the Sunne. And hereunto did that
holy King Dauid allude in his 48 Psalme, Wherefore should I feare
in the euill dayes, when Iniquitie shall compasse me about, as at myne
heeles? That sinne which he made least reckoning of, and cast behind him
as it were at his heeles, were those cords that did most wring him. It was an
old Prouerbe, Oculus habet in solea; that which hee should haue made
most reckoning of, he put it vnder the sole of his shooe: but God, whom hee
should haue esteemed aboue all, him hee made least account of.
            
               When Iesus lifted vp his eyes and saw, &amp;c. Saint
Mathew and Saint Marke both say, That he went, together with
his Disciples, into a Barke, and that hee crost ouer to the Desert which was on
the other side of the Riuer, and the people that followed him taking notice of
the voyage that he was to make, whither it were  that
they wanted ship-room, or that the wind was against them, they ran on foot
thither out of all Cities, and came thither before him, waiting for his
comming. Our Sauiour being disimbarkt, went vp to the Mount, saying vnto his
Disciples, Rest a while. He went forth to see the people that followed
him, and when hee saw them, beeing mooued to pittie and compassion of them,
because they were like Sheepe that had no Sheepheard, hee entertained them with
much courtesie and kindnesse, and hauing instructed them in many things
concerning the Kingdome of God, he afterwards cured those that were sicke. And
when the day was now farre spent, his Disciples came vnto him, saying, This is
a desert place, and now the day is farre passed, therefore I pray you dismisse
them and let them depart, that they may goe into the Villages and Townes about,
and buy them bread, for they haue nothing to eat: but he answered and said vnto
them, It is better that yee should giue them to eat.
            
               When Iesus had lift vp his eyes. To behold one earnestly,
is a token of loue and care: and herein our Sauiour not onely shewed a token of
his affection, but also of his prouidence. That it is a signe of Loue,
Esther said vnto King Assuerus, If I haue found fauour in the
sight of the King:
                  Esther. 5. she did
take the eyes to bee the Archiue of fauour; and therefore did petition him,
That he would entertaine her suit with the eyes of grace and fauour. The Prince
of Poets painting forth Iupiters fauouring of the Trojans, being
driuen by tempest on the Affrican Coast; expresseth it thus; — Libiae
defixit lumina regnis: — Inclining Dido's brest to take
pittie and compassion of them, and to supplie their wants, and to feast them in
her famous citie of Carthage.
            That it is a token of Prouidence, Ioues Statue with three
eyes doth exemplifie it vnto vs; beholding things past, things present, and
things to come. This agrees with that other, Firmabo super te oculos meos,
I will fixe my eyes vpon thee. But this looking here, must be a looking
with care and attention: and therefore we haue here a Seeing and a Seeing, it
is ecchoed and redoubled vnto vs, Cum subleuasset oculos, &amp; vidisset,
videns vidit afflictionem suam: Vide Domine, &amp; considera me.
            
            There are some eyes which looke, but doe not see: Of the rich
Foole Iob said,
                  Iob. 27.19. 
               He
opened his eyes and found nothing. Your Hares sleepe with their eyes open;
and Hermolaus reporteth the like of Iupiters Guard. Of your
Images and Idols Dauid said▪ 
               They had eyes, but did not
see. And S. Luke saith of S. Paul, Beeing open eyed he saw
nothing.
            
            Others there are who see, but will not see; these see a poore
Soule, but turne their eye aside from him, because they will not see him:
contrarie to Salomons councell, Turne not away thyne eye from the
Poore. They will not affoord them their eye, lest their heart should
follow after; such men will not take notice of the wretched estate of the
Poore, lest the pittifulnes of so miserable a spectacle might chance to mooue
them to charitie, and draw something out of their purses. Saint
Bernard cites the Spanish Prouerb, Ojos que no veen, cora
çon que no quiebra, What the eye sees not, the heart rues not.
Boaz knew well enough the great want and necessitie wherein
Ruth and Naomi liued; but hee did not relieue this their
pouertie, because he did not see it: but when he saw the one of them gleaning
the skattered eares of corne that were left in the field, his eyes wrought
vpon his heart, and taking compassion of her, hee aduised his Reapers, That
they should purposely leaue some eares for her to picke vp. O Lord
(said Martha to our Sauiour) Hadst thou beene here my brother had
not beene dead; for hadst thou but seene thy sicke friend, and the
affliction of his sorrowfull sisters thy seruants,  thou
couldst not chuse but haue taken pittie of vs. The Chroniclers of those Times
report of Alexander the Great, That he had Cor durum, &amp;
auarum, a hard and couetous heart: but his couetousnesse he ouercame by
his ambition of command and empire; and his hardnesse by his eye-pittie.
Diodorus storieth, That seeing in Greece a great number of poore
soules that were naked and distressed, the teares trickled from his eyes, and
tooke order that they should be furnished fo
                  •
               thwith both with cloaths and money. If then a heart that is
naturally hard, 
                  •
               annot indure to
see men in miserie, and not relieue them; How much more shall God, who is made
all of mercie and compassion, extend his pittie towards vs? The Princes of the
Philistines found this to be true,1. Sam 6.
when making the similitude of their loathsome and painfull disease in gold,
they presented them before the Arke, conceiting with themselues, That God but
looking vpon the meere similitude of their Emerodes, his bowells would bee
mooued with compassion towards them. Pulchriores sunt oculi tui vino;
Wine quickens the spirits, it comforts &amp; cheereth the heart; but the eyes
of God are more louely to looke to, and far better than the best wine.
            
               Cum subleuasset oculos Iesus, &amp; vidisset.
               There was a time when God did put the repairing and remedying of
  our miseries in our eyes; Sicut oculi ancillae in manibus Dominae suae,
  ita oculi nostri ad Deum Dominum nostrum, &amp;c. As the eyes of a louing
  and faithfull handmaid are alwayes attending on her Mistresse, obseruing
  euerie the least cast of her countenance; so our eyes should be still bending,
  &amp; as it were hanging continually ouer that diuine Fountaine, till we draw
  from it the water of Mercie and of Pittie. O Lord, thou art bound to take
  pittie on me,The eye is a preualent orator with God.
  because I haue myne eyes fixed and nayled as it were to thy mercie. This care
  God did represent vnto vs, when he commanded Moses to erect that dead
  brasen Serpent, to the end that those who were stung by those liuing serpents,
  might by looking thereupon bee healed; As many as are bitten, and looke
  vpon it, shall liue.
                  
                     Num. 21. That
  Precept of Leuiticus tended to this purpose, The seuenth yeare
  shall be a Sabboth of rest vnto the land,
                  
                     Leuit. 25. 
                  it shal be the Lord
                        •
                      Sabboth, thou shalt neither sow the
  field, nor cut the Vineyard. This was Natures feast of rest; obliging vs
  to lift vp our eyes to Heauen, and to beg of God our dayly bread. For too much
  plentie &amp; aboundance doth make vs oftentimes to abandon Gods prouidence,
  and to grow forgetfull of the care that he hath of vs. Out of the same reason
  he would not that the promised Land should be Locus rigatus, a watred
  land, like to that of the ouerflowing of Nilus, but that they should expect and
  looke for their water from Heauen: for in Aegypt, the power that they had to
  open at their pleasure the waters of Nilus, and to inrich their grounds
  therewith, was no small meanes to make them forget God.
               But Experience crying out with a loud voyce, That our eyes
  do not endeauour to looke vp so high as they should, and that when they
  ought to lift them vp to heauen, they cast them downe to the ground: The
  remedying of our miseries was made ouer to his eyes; giuing vs thereby such
  good securitie, that to behold his eyes, and to be cured, is all one. The
  Fabricke of the Temple being ended, Salomon made a most deuout prayer
  vnto God; wherein hee did earnestly petition him, That he would be pleased to
  looke downe vpon this his house with a gratious and fauourable eye; for,
  ô Lord, if thou shalt but vouchsafe to grace this Temple by beaming
  forth thereupon the resplendent rayes of those thy eyes, which are the light
  and life of the Church, I shall giue it for granted, that it shall surely stand
  in thy grace &amp; fauour; Let thyne eyes be open to this house night and
  day.
                  3. Reg. 8.29▪
                   There 
   is no gage or pledge so sure, as God setling of his eye
  vpon vs: for mens eyes do commonly follow the desires of their hearts; and
  because our good, and the best estate we haue, cannot rest well assured in the
  hands of our desires, for that for the most part they are our greatest enemies,
  and oftentimes proue our Hangmen and Executioners, God gaue them ouer to
  the lusts of their owne hearts: so that there is no trusting to our owne
  eyes. God left Adam to his owne libertie, and trusted him with the
  Empire and domination of the whole earth, but hee lost it in the turning of a
  hand, to giue content to his longing wife. Ne contristaret del
                        ••
                     ias, saith the glorious Doctor
  Saint Augustine; fearing more her sorrow, if hee should not haue
  satisfied her longing, than the losse of Heauen, Earth, and God. Afterwards,
  God fearing the like frailtie in man, when he had shut vp that small remnant of
  mankind in the Arke, (which he was willing to free from the furie of the Flood)
  he shut it too, tooke away the key, and hung it at his owne girdle; doubting
  with himselfe, That if he had left it in Noahs hands, though hee were
  so good and holy a man as he was, it would not be safe in his keeping.
               Amongst other innumerable reasons, there are two that we may
  specially relie vpon, and confidently build vpon them:
               The one, That the eyes of Gods prouidence are still watching
  ouer vs, and taking care of our good. Saint Cyrill saith, That our
  Sauiour looking vpon this hungrie people, and that had followed him thus afoot,
  did represent Gods beholding from the top of that high hill of his eternitie,
  all those things that either are, were, or shall be. For as Boaetius
  saith, Cunctorum, spectator est Deus, God ouersees all. Of men Saint
  Austen saith, That all that haue beene, or are in the world are poore
  beggars which eat of the crummes which fall from Gods Table; And as your poore
  wandring beggars which are almost hunger-starued, stand at the gates of a rich
  man that is a great almes giuer, with their scrips and pilgrime staues,
  expecting an almes; so all men both great and small, rich and poore, from the
  king to the beggar, stand waighting at this great House-keepers gate, looking
  for some releefe from him. Nor is there any man so rich, or so happy, that is
  not forced to be one of Gods beggars. And that Kingly Prophet Dauid
  saith the like of the beasts of the field in diuers places, The eyes of all
  waite vpon thee ô Lord,
                     Psal. 145. and
  thou giuest them their meat in due season, Thou openest thy hand,
                     Psal. 147. and fillest all things liuing with
  plentiousnesse, Hee giueth fodder vnto the Cattell, and feedeth the young
  Rauens that call vpon him. By Cattell, hee vnderstandeth whatsoeuer beasts of
  the field: And by the Rauen, whatsoeuer fowle of the ayre. And hee did
  purposely and more particularly put here the Rauen, either because those old
  ones doe not acknowledge their young, for that they are white when they are
  hatcht, the damme and her mate beeing of a contrarie colour: Or because it is
  such a rauening bird, that according to Ari
                        ••

                     ie, the old ones doe banish their young ones as soone as they
  are able to flie, and shift for themselues, into some other region further off,
  that they may not rob them of their food and sustenance. In a word, great and
  small, high and low, haue their maintenance from God; Who is it but God,
  that feedeth the yong Rauens when they call vpon him? Of the trees and
  plants that holy King Da

  numbreth his sheepe, and puts a marke vpon euerie one of them; so our Lord God
  doth number the multitude of the Starres, and ca
                        ••
                     eth them by their names. The glorious Saint
  Chrysostome tells vs in a metaphoricall language, That in those
  immense spatious walkes in Heauen, there are other more beautifull fields,
  other  Fountaines, other Floures, other Groues, and that
  God doth sustaine and maintaine them all, All liue vnder his
  protection. Since then that all things liue so secure vnder his diuine
  prouidence, Why should man distrust, especially seeing that he hath an eye and
  a care to his wants and necessities; Who is like vnto the Lord our God, who
  dwelleth in the highest clouds, and yet doth behold from aboue, whatsoeuer is
  in heauen or in earth? The sight is not qualified by seeing great things,
  but by perceiuing the least atomes or motes that are in the Sunne. In an
  Epistle which the glorious Apostle Saint Paul wrote to the Romans, he
  calleth God, the God of Hope; for he looking downe vpon vs doth inrich vs with
  such assured hopes, that we may hold them more firme and sure vnto vs, than any
  present possession of those lands or goods which we enioy.
               The second reason is, That if any thing can grieue Gods heart,
  it is our miserie and necessitie; and therefore he makes such hast to helpe
  vs, as if it were his owne case; My sister, my Spouse, thou hast wounded my
  heart with one of thyne eyes, and with one haire of thy necke.

  the head is full of haire, so is it full of care. The

                  ye of the Huntsman doth more harme
  than the Arrow which hee shoots; for he that doth not throughly eye his game,
  seldome kills: and therefore the Spouses Beloued sayes vnto her, Euerie one of
  thy cares, especially when I see thee looke vpon me, are so many darts sticking
  in my heart. Abbot Guaricus discoursing of the Prodigall, saith, That
  when his father saw him so ill accoutred, compassion did more strongly possesse
  him, than the passion of sorrow for his sins did his sonne. When
  Abraham was swallowed vp as it were with sorrow,
                     Gen. 22 as hee vnsheathed his sword to sacrifice
  his son Isaac; Dominus videbit (saith the Text) id est,
  prouidebit; which was the good old mans answer, when his sonne askt him,
  Vbi est victima, pater mi? My father, where is the Lambe for the burnt
  Offering? The Septuagint read Apparebit; the Tigurine,
  Videbitur. For God seeing vs suffer for his sake, is of it selfe a
  present helpe in our time of need. Many of the Saints do ponder the griefe
  which God did discouer for that dearth which Israel indured,3 Reg. 17. and the care that he tooke in allaying
  the sharpenesse and tartnesse of Elias his austere and sowre
  disposition, who when he had caused the windows of heauen to be shut vp for
  three yeares, yet he appointed him a Rauen to bee his Steward, to bring him in
  prouision, that hee might not suffer in that common cala

                  tie; yet giuing him this checke by the way, It is not

                   the rest of my people
  starue; but since I haue past my word, this Rauen shal take care of thee. Saint
  Chrysostome saith,Gods care to work his children
 to mercy That this was a seuere reprehension of the Prophet
  Elias. That a Bird that hath no pittie of her owne brood, should take
  pittie of thee; that a bird that by nature is cruell, and liues vpon rapines
  and spoyle of others, should be a Minister of mercie vnto thee: and thou that
  shouldest haue been a mediator betwixt God and his people, shouldst be a
  prouoker of him to vengeance; he cries out against him, Absurdum est,
  ô Elias, Thou hast committed a great absurditie, ô Elias.
  Saint Augustine further addeth, That the Rauen which heretofore shewed
  himselfe vnthankefull, in not returning again to Noahs Arke, is now so
  farre altred from that he was, that he brings thee bread and flesh, affoording
  thee thy dayly food; it had not been much for thee to haue expected an
  alteration likewise in the Children of Israell. Procopius tells vs,
  That the Rauen is an vncleane creature by the Law; and beeing that I, who was
  the Law-giuer, did dispense that thou shouldest take thy food from him, Why
  mightst not thou as well haue asked a dispensation of me, for this so long an
  interdiction.
               
                  And he entertained them kindly. The griefe which our
  Sauiour had conceiued  for the death of Iohn
  Baptist, did not cause him to withdraw his sweet and comfortable
  countenance from others. For the mourning for the Iust, is not a hooding of the
  face to conceale our selues and our sorrow from the world; The Saints of God,
  lament the losse which the Earth sustaines by the taking away of the righteous
  from amongst vs, but not their death. For hee beholdeth not his death with the
  eyes of death, but quickely passes it ouer. It is the foole that thinkes all is
  ended with them in death. But it is nothing so.

                  Whence shall wee buy bread, that these may eat. He here
  tooke counsell, what were best to be done in this case? It beeing (as
  Plato sayth) amongst all other things the most Sacred and the most
  Diuine. And Ecclesiasticus telleth vs, that counsel makes things
  stable, durable, &amp; secure. As a frame of wood ioyned together in a
  building cannot bee loosed with shaking; so the heart, that is established by
  aduised counsel, shal feare at no time.
               
               
                  Whence shall wee buy bread. Here our Sauiour consults
  with Philip, how, and which way this may handsomely bee done. This is
  a prudent proposition for a Prince, when occasion is offered of some
  extraordinary expence, to treat with his Counsell, how and which way these
  monies are to be raised and ordered? Hee that goes about to build him a stately
  pallace, will first aske counsel of his purse, how he shall bee able to
  compasse it. A King that breakes his League, and is to enter into a War with
  his neighbour Prince, will first consult with his subiects, how he shall
  vndergoe it. For, to goe out with tenne thousand against an Enemie, that
  brings twentie thousand into the field, is not wisedome. And he must haue an
  eye vnto this V

                     de,
  whence, and which way he shall leuie both men and money? For if it must bee
  from the bloud of the poore, that bloud which is thus wrung from them, is to
  draw the best bloud out of his owne bodie, to the indangering of his life, if
  not of his soule. Those Princes seldome or neuer thriue, who misseled by euill
  counsellors, say with Rehobaam, Whereas my Father did burden you with
  a greeuous yoke,3. Reg. 12. I will yet make
  your yoke heauier; My Father hath chastised you with rods, but I will correct
  you with scourges; And my least part, shall be bigger than my fathers loynes.
  So vnmerciful and intollerable are the greeuances &amp; oppressions which
  Kings Ministers exercise vpon the poore, that the widdow weeps, and the
  orphant sheds teeres, &amp; the teeres thatd,

                  ckle from their cheekes, howsoeuer
  Kings may conceiue they fall to the ground, I must boldly tell them, that they
  ascend vp as high as Heauen, and are there turned into flashes of Lightening,
  and their cries into Thunder, against those Ministers that are the cause
  thereof, and those Princes that suffer the same, and consent thereunto.
               They must consider vpon what ground they goe, For if the cause
  be honest, pious, and necessarie, as to keepe souldiers from staruing, that lye
  in garrison; to bridle the insolencies of the enemies of the Faith; to supplie
  the necessarie prouision of the Kings house, and the like, it is well and good,
  and God forbid but we should think
                     •
                  
  that to be verie well imployed, which is so spent; and it is fit that euery man
  that is of abilitie should contribute to the charge. But to impouerish some to
  inrich others, to pill the Commonwealth to make fat a fauorite, to dispeople
  townes for to make forrests, &amp; to put Naboth out of his lawfull
  possession, nay and his life too, to make thy selfe a house of pleasure, and
  gardens to feast and banquet in, &amp;c. I will leaue this to their owne
  consideration, without pressing this point any further, least contrarie to
  Salomons Counsaile, by wringing the nose too hard, I might happen to
  draw bloud, and so offend the head.
               
                  
                  Whence shall we buy bread? From
  the beginning of the world vntil then,Christ neuer commanded
 vs to sheare the sheepe, but to feede them it was neuer propounded in
  any Princes Councell, how the Hungrie should be fed, or any care taken, how the
  Naked should be cloathed: But how to raise money for the Princes expences, for
  the more magnificent maintenance of his Maiestie, and for the vpholding of his
  Estate, this is euerie dayes example. And if the royal Patrimonie shall be
  impawned, there shall be sitting vpon sitting, proiect vpon proiect, how to
  bring him out of debt, &amp; to fill his Coffers, and all of them will put a
  helping hand to lay more and more burthens on the backes of the Poore; but
  whence the Poore should be fed, how your decayed Townes should bee repaired,
  how your ruined Commonwealths restored to their former honour and greatnes; let
  the great ones aduise vpon that, (if it stand not with the hurt of their
  greatnesse) for I can say little vnto it. Saint Bernard hath obserued,
  That our Sauiour Christ said thrice vnto Peter, Pasce Oues meas, Feed my
  Sheepe: but that hee neuer said vnto him, no not so much as once, That he
  should sheere them. Signifying thereby, That it is the office of a good
  Prelat, to haue an especiall care that his Sheepe be well fed, both with
  spirituall and corporall food, and not to studie the raising of his Rents, the
  racking of his Tenants, nor his owne priuate profit.
               
                  Whence shall we buy bread. Our Sauiour Christ consulted
  with all his Disciples concerning this businesse. And therefore he sayd vnto
  them, Giue yee them to eate. And although the Disciples tooke care for
  the prouision of these things, they did not lift their eyes vp any higher, then
  to the distribution of their almes. But our Sauiour being willing to tax them
  for this their little faith, he would first make a verification of those few
  loafes that they had in their keeping. Quot panes habetis, &amp;c. How
  many loaues haue yee? He began first with Philip, eyther perhaps
  because he was not present at what had passed; or because hee seemed to take
  the greatest care, how these should haue wherewithall to eate; or because he
  was lesse frugall and prouident than the rest (as Saint Chrysostome
  noteth it;) or because he was not so quicke witted, and of that nimble
  apprehension as his fellowes, (as it seemeth to Saint Cyrill.) In
  conclusion, two necessities incountring together; one of the body, another of
  the soule; one of bread, and another of fayth; our Sauiour Christ began first
  with that of the soule, hauing recourse to that his office of a Sauiour, who
  made more reckoning of the more, than of the lesse.
               
                  Two hundred penny worth of bread is not sufficient for
  them. Saint Marke saith in the name of the rest, Let vs goe
  and buy two hundred penny worth of bread. Wherunto Philip
  answered, that two hundred penny worth of bread would not bee sufficient for
  them; nay two hundred royalls would not come to a bit a man.
                     Philip regarded more Christs purse, than his power, and
 so doe many their owne. At which time he had turned his eye aside from
  our Sauiours omnipotency, placing his eyes vpon his purse strings to see how
  strong they were: Whereas the blessed Virgin casting her eyes off from the
  Master of the feast, threw them on her sonnes omnipotencie. So short sighted is
  mans wisedome, that in seeing ordinary meanes faile, he holds the relieuing of
  his wants desperate, not so much as once thinking what a thing it is to put our
  trust in God. And it is a fearefull thing to thinke, that man sinning, hopes
  that God will pardon him; and that suffering hunger and nakednes, God should
  not helpe him. Thou committest a mortall sinne, thou reckonest not much of it,
  hoping that God will be good vnto thee, and forgiue thee thy trespasse; thou
  sufferest hunger and nakednesse, and yet despairest of comfort, fearing more to
  be starued to death, than to be damned to hell. Canst thou hope then for so
  great a fauour as to be saued by his  mercy and pitty
  towards thee, and shalt thou despaire in these lesser things of the infinite
  prouidence of God? It is a great shame for thee so to doe, and such a fowlenes,
  as none in a Christian can be more.
               Hence is it that thou hast recourse to euill meanes, for to free
  thee from hunger. But this is a strange kind of ignorance in thee:
               First, because the diuell hath not the power to do thee good in
  this kind. Pharaohs inchanters did adde plagues to plagues; flyes to
  flyes; frogs to frogs; serpents to serpents; bloud vnto blood; but take them
  away they could not. All the diuells in hell cannot slacke that hunger which
  God sendeth.
               
                  
                     Psal. 65.Secondly; because
  God hath reserued this care to himselfe, Thou preparest them corne, for so
  thou appointest it. The Hebrewes hath it, Because it is thy
  preparation, and thou prouidest it for vs. Thou ô Lord doest
  furnish vs with foode, because it appertaineth to the office of thy
  prouidence.
                     Act. 14.17. 
                  Neuerthelesse hee
  left not himselfe without witnesse, in that he did good, and gaue vs raine from
  heauen, and fruitfull seasons, filling our hearts with foode and
  gladnesse. So that the Euangelist Saint Luke saith, That albeit
  the Creator of heauen and earth, did not suffer himselfe to be seene by humane
  eyes, yet he left testimonies behind him, whereby they might know him; as by
  his preseruation of the world, his cheering of mans heart with food and
  gladnesse: and for this cause hee commands, That wee should beg our dayly bread
  of him. And as he onely can giue vs the Spiritual and Sacramental bread, so he
  onely can giue vs that materiall bread that must sustain our bodies, as that
  other doth our soules.
               
                  There is a little boy here, which hath fiue barley loaues,
  and two fishes, But what are they among so many? Whether this were a boy
  belonging to the Apostolicall Colledge, (as it seemeth to Euthimius)
  or some boy of one of the Towns thereabouts, as Chrysostome and
  Theodoret would inferre, I will not stand to dispute it: but it
  seemeth somewhat strange vnto me, That there was not any one man in all this
  Apostolical Colledge, which did not seek to rid their hands of this people, or
  despaire of their being able to giue them entertainment. Some said,
  Dimitte eos, Send them away, dismisse them, what should they doe
  here? Saint Philip he comes in with Ducentorum denariorum, Two
  hundred penniworth of bread will not serue the turne. Saint Andrew,
  Quid inter tantos, What's a pound of butter amongst a kennell of hounds?
  What's this amongst so many? Onely our Sauiour Christ vseth them with a great
  deale of courtesie and ciuilitie, he onely fauours them, and is willing to bid
  them welcome. Saint Ambrose saith, That if they had bin fiftie
  thousand, as they were but fiue thousand, they should all of them haue gone
  away satisfied and well contented. Iob saith, If I restrained the
  Poore of their desire, &amp;c. The multitude of the Poore did neuer cause
  feare in me, as being wel assured, that God hath enough in store for them. Now
  if man beare so braue a mind, because he is made after the image of God; What a
  noble mind must there be in God? In a couetous mans house there is too much
  penurie for the poore, but too much excesse for vanitie. When Nabal
  denied bread to Dauid and his souldiers, the Scripture saith, That hee
  had prouided a feast for a King. And the rich Glutton in the Gospell hauing his
  table plentifully furnished, denied the crummes to poore Lazarus,
  that fell from his Table. There are three things which my soule hateth; whereof
  one of them is, A rich man a lier. Saint Augustine by this
  rich man, a lier, vnderstandeth the vnmercifull man, who though he abound in
  wealth, still answers the Poore, No ay, I haue not for you; but the
  mercifull minded man still saith, Para todos ay, I haue for you all;
  but the couetous man, No ay para nadie, I haue for none of you.
               
               
                  
                  Here is a boy that hath fiue l
                        •
                     aues. It was great charitie in
  God,Onely our Sauior impouerished himselfe to make others
 rich. to giue away the prouision of his owne Colledge. Seneca
  treating of the liberalitie which one man ought to vse towards another, saith,
  Dabo egenti, sed vt ipse non egeam; succurram perituro, sed vt ipse non
  peream; I will be mindfull of the Poore, but not forgetfull of my selfe; I
  will relieue him that is readie to perish, but will looke to it that I may not
  perish my selfe. For, What rich man did euer make himselfe poore to make a
  poore man rich? Onely our Sauiour Christ did so, When he was rich, hee made
  himselfe poore, that by his pouertie we might be made rich. To giue of our
  superfluities to the Poore, is a vertue; to part with part of that which doth
  not superabound, as the Widdow of Sarepta did, is more than a vertue; but to
  giue all away that is necessarie and needfull for a mans owne life, onely our
  Sauiour Christ did this. By whose example, many Saints afterwards became
  excellent Almoners; who were contented to suffer nakednesse and hunger
  themselues, that they might fill the bellie of the Hungrie, and cloath the
  backe of the Naked. And amongst the rest of these Worthies in their time,
  (whose memorie shall neuer be forgotten) verie memorable was that of
  Paulina Bishop of Nola, who to free another from slauerie, became a
  slaue himselfe.
               
                  Make the People sit downe. Saint Austen saith,
  That the circumstances made this miracle the more remarkable.
               First, it is the fashion of the World, to haue the meat set on
  the boord, before the guests sit downe. At that Feast which the King made at
  his sonnes wedding, Behold, I haue prepared my dinner, myne Oxen,
                     Mat. 22.4. and my Fatlings are killed, and all
  things are readie, &amp;c.
                     Ester 1. King
  Assuerus made a great banquet for the Princes of his Kingdome, in the
  Court of the Garden and the Kings Pallace; but the Vigiles were farre longer
  than the Feast. But Gods Feasts haue no need of preuention or solemne
  preparation. God created the earth rich in hearbes and plants, before it
  inioyed the benefit of either Sun or Water, (as Saint Chrysostome
  hath noted it) and therefore Christ had no need of Sunne or Water, to furnish
  and set forth a full table for man. He tooke all his Disciples opinions, and
  they all agreeing, that there was not bread sufficient for them, nor mony
  wherewithall to buy it; when they held it to be a desperate case, then did our
  Sauiour say vnto them, Cause the People therefore to sit downe. Where
  the word Therefore is to be considered. Saint Chrysostome
  saith, That he went about to prooue by this Therefore, that which he
  afterwards said to the glorious Apostle Saint Paul, He calleth those things
  that are not, as though they were. In like manner, that which is not,
  heareth and obeyeth God, as though it were.
               The second circumstance is, That from so poore a prouision there
  should be so rich an ouerplus. In the feasts of this world, there is much
  remaining, because there is much prouided, which doth commonly extend it selfe
  more to vanitie and ostentation, than necessitie. And that of much, much should
  be left, it is not much: But of a little, to make a great deale; God can onely
  doe it. Of much to make a little, is euery dayes practise; for your Cookes and
  Manciples know how to licke their owne fingers, and for the most part are all
  of them theeues, and vnfaithfull Ministers. But of a little to make much, is a
  Blazon that onely belongs vnto God: For (as Saint Augustine saith) he
  did feast this people, Non solum pro bonitate, sed pro potestate; Not onely
  out of his goodnesse, but also out of his power: For God was not here
  willing to expresse himselfe onely to be good, mercifull, and pittifull, but
  likewise to shew himselfe powerfull and liberall. Iosephs brethren
  seeing their sacks full of corne that before were emptie, and finding their
  moneyes in the mouthes of their sacks, they sayd one to 
  another; What Miracle is this that God hath wrought amongst vs? Ioseph
  was the man that did it, but they could not beleeue that such an extraordinary
  kindnesse could come from man, but from God. Men, when they fill their sackes
  with come, they empty their purses; But to fill the sacke and the purse too,
  that is onely proper vnto God.
               The third circumstance, is the order therein obserued: Per
  quinquagenos, &amp; centenos. They sate downe by rowes (saith S.
  Marke) by hundreds and by fifties. Whereas in your great
  feasts now adayes, all is disorder and confusion. Homer saith, That
  when the guests be many, nothing can be fauourie, for commonly all is noyse and
  disorder for want of good gouernment. Plutarch reporteth, that the
  Emperour Paulus Aemilius was wont to say, That no lesse prudence was
  required for the well ordering of a feast,The Church why
 stiled a well ordered Armie. where there are store of guests, than for
  to marshall a great Armie. The Holy Ghost stiles the Church, a well ordered
  Armie.
               The one in regard of it's beauty; for which it deserueth to be
  beloued.
               The other for it's order; for which it ought to be esteemed.
               In this feast there was good order taken for their sitting
  downe, as also for the equalitie in distribution of their fare. And where this
  decorum is kept, a little will suffice many, and where it is not, much
  will not suffice a few. Those houses where this order is obserued, liue
  alwayes in plenty; where that is lacking, there is pouerty and want.

                     pertate
  mea (saith he of himselfe) According to my pouertie, I haue laid
  vp such and such talents for the building of a Temple to the Lord: But because
  Dauid was a good husband, and liued in an orderly fashion, neuer any
  King bestowed so many and so rich rewards vpon his Subjects as he did, nor was
  at greater charge when occasion required it. For the materialls of the Temple
  he had disbursed a hundred thousand Talents of gold, and a million of Talents
  of siluer. He made shields of gold, he had gathered together a great masse of
  yron, and other mettalls, besides a world of wood; and yet when he died, left
  the patrimonie royall disimpawned, hauing in his Treasurie three thousand
  Talents of gold, and seuen thousand of siluer, which being reduced to our
  moneyes, would hardly come to be summed. Salomon was so rich a
  Prince, that all the garnish and seruice of his Pallace, and other his houses
  of pleasure, were of the finest and purest gold. And siluer, the Scripture
  saith,Want oforder brings in all confusion. was in no
  price or estimation in his time, being as common as the stones in the streetes.
  And yet, he hauing no warres, nor any forcible occasions of other
  extraordinary expences, layd taxe vpon taxe, and tribute vpon tribute vpon his
  subiects, and dying in the end very poore, he left the reuenewes of his Crowne
  so deepely indebted, that his sonne Rehoboam was inforced to impose
  new tributes and taxations, by which he came to loose ten parts of his
  Kingdome. The holy Prophet Ieremy noted this disorder in
  Eliakim King of Iuda, the sonne of Iosias, Thou
  alleadgest (saith hee) that the Maiestie Royall doth suffer want and
  necessitie; and that for this cause, thou oppressest the poore, the
  fatherlesse, and the widow. Thy father, was not he King as well as thou? Did
  not he maintaine the state and greatnesse of a King? Did he not affoord many
  fauours for the ease of his subiects? yet we doe not heare any complaint of
  his grinding of the faces of the poore, nor of his wringing and racking of his
  vassals.
               
                  Partiality in all things to be
 auoided.The fourth circumstance, is the equalitie and fidelitie of his
  Ministers, for although they were but poore, yet did they not regard their
  priuate interest. For although many of the guestes were knowne vnto them, and
  that they had beene  particularly beholding vnto some of
  them, yet did they carry an euen hand towards them all. The Ministers of
  Princes should be like vnto the stomacke, which doth equally and faithfully
  repart that which it receiueth, through all the parts of the bodie.
  Dauid, that regall Prophet, prints out the stampe of a perfect King;
  and one of the conditions is, That he should fix his eyes vpon Ministers that
  are faithfull, euen-handed, full of integritie, disinteressed and true both in
  their words and deeds. The gouernment of Traian was famoused
  throughout the world, for that he neuer suffered to be about him a lying
  Minister, a couetous thiefe, nor any that dealt vnfaithfully; for from the
  Ministers vnfaithfulnesse, of force an ill name must fall vpon the King. And
  put case, that we must of force indure one of these two mischiefes, eyther a
  bad King, or bad Ministers, it were the lesse hurt, that the King should be
  bad. For the Ministers being the Kings hands to dispatch all businesses, they
  would amend what is amisse in his decrees and proclamations, and the like.
               The faults which in Ministers ought most to be shunned,Ministers of State seldome good, if needy; if couetous,
 neuer. and for which they ought most to be reprooued, is, to be poore
  and couetous. For all that is poore, and hath no good estate of his owne to
  trust to, will take away that which is another mans, vnlesse the King shall
  giue him sufficient allowance for to maintaine him. And hence it is, that we
  see many Ministers, who entring into their office with fiue bare barly loaues,
  it seemeth vnto them that our Sauiour Christ hath made them dispencers of his
  bread, and that it is multiplyed by their hands, since that in so short a time
  they haue so many baskets ouer and aboue full of bread. When Ioshua
  made a partition of the land of promise, and euery man was to haue his portion
  proportioned forth vnto him, he layd out nothing for himselfe, expecting that
  the people should allot him out some conuenient share. For as
  Theoderet hath noted vpon that place, Magistrates are not to treate
  of their owne particular profits, but of the common good. The like noblenesse
  and faithfulnesse Philon hath noted in Ioseph, who being able
  (if he would) to haue interessed himselfe in that immense masse of wealth,
  which by his industry did accrew to the patrimony royall, did not acquire to
  himselfe one single peny more than his stipē
                  dary allowance from the King.
  There are some who are like vnto Bells Priests, who deuouring the
  Kings treasure, and feeding themselues fat with his wealth, make him beleeue,
  that the God Bell did eate vp all that which was brought in vnto them.
  The Spleene or Milt in mans body, is the stampe or Hieroglyph of these kind of
  people, which the fatter it growes, and the more it swels, the feebler and
  weaker are the rest of the members of the body.
               Lesse conuenient is that Minister which is couetous,Couetousnesse neuer satisfied for though he haue neuer so
  much, yet is he neuer satisfied. Valerius Maximus reporteth, That it
  was propounded in the Senat of Rome, That two persons should be nominated to
  goe for Spaine against Viriatus, and the worthiest of the two to be
  made choice of; the one was Seruius Sulpitius; the other, the Consull
  Aurelius; and the Senators referring the choice to Aemilianus
  Scipio, to elect him whom hee thought fittest for that imployment; his
  answer vnto them was, I like of neither of them; for, Alter nihil habet,
  alteri nihil sat est, The one of them hath nothing, and to the other nothing is
  enough: not approouing the one, because hee was too poore; nor the other,
  because he was too couetous. Your full fed Flies are woont to bee lesse
  painefull to the wounds of the Poore, because their fulnesse hath it's bounds
  and termination. But this example is nothing to the purpose for your richer
  sort of Ministers; for your Flies, and so all other birds and beasts, haue
  their limits and bounds in their fulnesse, whereupon they rest and dwell, as
  the sea doth in the  sand: but your couetous men, the
  richer they are, the greedier they grow, and more hurtfull to the Commonwealth;
  for a poore Minister will content himselfe with smal matters, but the rich
  Miser is insatiable. The Prodigall keeping hogs at a Farmhouse in the Country,
  suffered a strange &amp; raging kind of hunger, but when he could get no better
  food to satisfie the same, he was well content to take part with the Swine. The
  rich man in the Gospel had the world at wil, wanted nothing, neither for his
  backe nor his bellie; Thou hast much goods (said hee of himselfe)
  laid vp for many yeares: but all this would not satisfie his
  insatiable desire; The Barnes are not big enough, &amp; my Granaries too
  little for my hunger, I will plucke them downe and make them bigger.
               
                  Iesus tooke the Loaues, and when he had giuen thankes, he,
  &amp;c. It is first of all to be noted, That our Sauiour tooke the Loaues
  and the Fishes first into his owne sacred hands, that he might thereby shew
  himselfe to be the author of this miraculous multiplication.
               Secondly, He did lift vp his eys vnto Heauen, in token that he
  had this power from Heauen.
               Thirdly, He gaue thankes vnto the father, as he was Man, because
  he was pleased to worke so great a miracle, for the spirituall and corporall
  good of man, which he accounted as a kindnesse done vnto himselfe.
               Fourthly, He did blesse the loaues and the fishes, giuing them
  the vertue and power of multiplication.
               Fiftly, The partition and diuision of them, he did put them into
  the hands of his Disciples, that they might diuide them amongst them, and
  minister them vnto them. And all this was a type of the blessed Sacrament.
               He could haue as well created loaues and fishes anew, but then
  peraduenture the people would haue thought that God had sent them down from
  Heauen, as he did raine at the prayer of Elias, or Quailes in the
  Desert, or as Manna; and so they would haue diuerted their eyes &amp; their
  thoughts from the vertue of those diuine hands. And therefore it was fit &amp;
  conuenient, that he should adde an augmentation vnto them, but not create
  them: as at the wedding he turned the water into wine, which he could (if he
  would) haue created anew. Saint Augustine saith, That this
  multiplication began in the hands of our Sauiour Christ; Saint
  Chrysostome, That it inlarged it selfe in the hands of the Apostles;
  Saint Hilarie, That it indured till it came to the hands of the
  Guests: The vertue was all one, but it extended it selfe to all, that the
  seruice might be the better performed, and the miracle made the more notorious
  and manifest.
               Our Sauiour Christ was willing that this multiplication should
  bee by the hands of his Apostles, for to fasten vpon all Clergiemen this
  liberalitie &amp; bountie,Clergie men ought to be
 liberall. in distributing of bread, and doing almesdeeds. A Bishop puts
  on his Pontificiall robes in the Church, and in the Church hee puts them off
  againe; and when he comes forth, his office is to inrich the widdow with his
  purse, and to spend his portion vpon Orphans and fatherlesse children.
  Iudas returned the money for which he sould his Sauiour, to the
  Temple, and the Priests entring into councell, What they should doe with it?
  they decreed, That it should bee spent vpon the Poore, because it was the price
  of the bloud of the High-Priest, who was the Father of the Poore. Saint
  Bernard saith, That the Priest that hath his part here vpon earth,
  must not looke for a part in Heauen; Si quid habuerit prater
  Deum,
                  Then God haue mercie vpon many. 
                  pars
  eius, non erit Deus. Saint Cyril, That when Bishops seruants
  passe vp and downe the Streets, and enter into vnknowne houses, he that lookes
  vpon them ought to presume, That they go in there to seeke after the Poore to
  relieue  them. And Saint Iohn saith, That the
  Disciples presumed this of Iudas,
                  
                     Iob.
 13. when our Sauiour said vnto him, Quod facis, fac
  citò. Many sticke not to say; I shall dye ere long, and then I will
  giue all vnto God. What an ill account do these men make (saith Saint
  Cirill?) All Clergie men haue to their heires those that are their
  enemies, who euery moment desire their death. And because their enemie shall
  not haue it, they say; Let vs giue it vnto Christ. Nihil inuenerunt viri
  diuitiarum in manibus suis, The rich found nothing in their hands. Saint
  Augustine giues the reason, Quia nihil posuerunt in manibus
  Christi: Because they deposited nothing in the hands of Christ.
               
               
                  They did all eate, and were satisfied. Eusebius
  Emisenus saith, That there was a very sauorie contention betweene fiue
  loaues and fiue thousand men, besides women and children; And that euery one
  did resolue to make an end of their peece of loafe and their fish, as well for
  to satisfie their hunger as for that it was so sauourie to the taste. And in
  that bread which they thought would haue beene but two bits a man, they had
  thirty, and the same imperceptibly and insensibly increasing, those fiue
  loaues were too hard for those fiue thousand persons and their hunger.
               Our Sauiour Christ was herein desirous principally to prooue,
  That in his house, there are all sorts of dainties and fulnesse. The world
  seekes to disgrace Gods hospitalitie, and good house-keeping; alledging, that
  to be his friend, and to dye of hunger, is all one: And, that God is good for
  heauen, but not for earth: Because he doth interdict their pleasures and
  delights. This vniust censure of theirs, is repeated by many of the Prophets
  in the name of the cast-aways of this world. As Malachy for one; It is
  in vaine to serue God, and what profit is there in keeping his commandements?
  This is the scoffing and flouting of fooles, at those who serue God.
  Saturati sumus panibus (saith Ier.) &amp; benè
  nobis erat, &amp; malum non vidimus. The Hebrew hath it; Eramus boni,
  id est, foelices. The Prophet doth reprehend his people, That through
  their Idolatries they were come to those miseries of their captiuitie, and that
  if they did not labour to amend, he would lash them with sharper whips. And
  this stubborne people replyeth; Nay rather, since we haue forsaken God, the
  world goes well with vs; for we eate and drinke, we are merry, sound and lusty,
  and happier than before. But since we left of sacrificing to the Moone, our
  life hath beene a continuall misery, and a perpetuall pouerty. Peccaui; quid
  mihi accidit trifte?
               
               Secondly, God was willing to doe this for his owne honours sake,
  and for the good of those whom the world had deliuered vp into his hands
  hungrie, surbated, and sicke. All these he heales, all these he fils, and all
  these hee comforts, to the end that it may remain as a registred and notorious
  truth, That God is a good God, both in heauen and on earth. When God did
  descend from the Mount to giue the Law, Exodus saith, The children of
  Israel saw God, and did eate and drinke: so that their seeing of God did not
  put them beside their eating and their drinking. And our Sauiour Christ said,
  That which enters in at the mouth, defiles not a man, And by Esay, My
  seruants shall eate and drinke, and be merry, and ye shall perish. Abbot
  Gilbertus saith, That the Prodigall forsaking his fathers house,
  entred into a stricter kind of order, where he had fasting enough, whereas in
  his fathers house, the very hindes, and meanest of his seruants had their
  bellies full of meate.
               The world is a Cosiner and a Cheater, it promiseth mountaines of
  gold,The worlds entertainment meane and vncertaine.

  and on the other very poore and miserable. She will giue you bread, but it shal

               Besides, her prouision is so poore, that if she should giue all
  to one, she would leaue him stil as hungry as if she had giuen him nothing at
  all. So that he remains hungry, to whom shee giues little, &amp; he also to
  whom she giues much. She gaue the Prodigal very little, &amp; he remained
  hungry. She gaue Salomon very much, &amp; it seemed vnto him, that all
  was but ayre that he had eaten, Vanitas vanitatum, &amp; omnia
  vanitas. S. Ambrose citeth to this purpose the fable of
  Midas, who was all his life time hungring after gold, and besought the
  gods, that whatsoeuer hee toucht might be turned into gold; and they granting
  his petition, hee perished through hunger, For his meate and his drinke turning
  it selfe into gold, his hunger increased ypon him, till it had wrought his
  death. Saint Iohn saith, in his Apocalips, That hee saw a blacke
  horse, Et qui sedebat super eum, habebat stateram in manu sua. By the
  blacke horse, Beda vnderstands sinne; by him that sate thereupon, the
  Deuill. The ballance which he held in his hand, was not that of Iustice, but
  of scaricitie and miserie, for to weigh the bread which hee giues in allowance
  to his seruants,
                     Apoc. 6. which he deliuers
  out vnto them by ounces, and by drams. And anon after he says, that he saw
  another vpon a pale horse, and his name was Death. Who had power to aflict with
  hunger the foure quarters of the world. These were the horsemen on the one
  side; but there was heard from the other side, a loud voice, which sayd; A
  measure of Wheat for a pennie, and three measures of Barley for a penny. But
  yee that take part with the blacke horse, must not touch neither on the wine
  nor the oyle there mentioned, it is not for your mowing; signifying thereby,
  that when the vassall of the Deuill, of the World, and of the Flesh, perisheth
  of hunger, the Iust shal haue their food good cheape.
               
                  They eat and were satisfied. There is no mention made
  in this feast of drinke; because meat doth increase thirst, and drinke doth
  quench it. And of Gods good blessings wee remaine alwayes more and more
  thirstie. Dionisius the Carthusian sayth, That he gaue vnto the loaues
  and the fishes the vertue and power of quenching their thirst.

                  wed great care for the sauing and
  gathering vp of that which was left.
               First, for to discouer the vertue of Almes deedes, as Saint
  Cyrill obserueth it. Saint 
                     
                        ••
                     sten sayth, That the field of the poore is the fertilest, For

  Merchant that hath so quicke a returne of gaine, and so plentifull, as that
  husbandman that sowes his seed in such a peec

                   of ground. And he that gets least, is hee that ventures least. But
  some one will say, How can I want, or bee in need, if I keepe my fruits safe
  vnder locke and key? &amp;c. I answere, that because thou keepest them so
  close,  thou maist want them; but if thou shouldst
  scatter thē abroad, thou shouldst haue Gods plentie. He that sowes not, reapes
  not; Date, &amp; dabitur vobis, Giue,

                  and it shall be giuen vnto you; and if your store shall not
  increase, Come and blame mee; Haue I peraduenture beene to my People like a
  Wildernesse without fruit?
                  
                     Ier. 2. The
  like conceit doth S. Chrysostome touch vpon, expounding,
  Communicating to the necessities of the Saints. Saint
  Gregorie treats the verie selfe same Doctrine, vpon that place of
  Iob, If I despised him that passed by because hee was not cloathed.
  And Saint Ambrose in a Sermon which he makes of Fasting, puts this
  difference betwixt paying that which thou owest, and giuing of almes to the
  Poore, to whom thou art not indebted; that the one is in profit of him that
  receiues it; the other in profit of him that giues. And therefore in Scripture
  Almes is called Benedictio, A Blessing, which is that which augments
  our wealth.
               Secondly, Our Sauiour was willing that they should gather vp the
  fragments, to the end that the greatnesse of the miracle should be the more
  notorious, and that they should see of fiue loues twelue baskets full of what
  remained, besides that which they carried away in their bosomes, their sleeues,
  and their pockets, especially your women and your children. And howbeit some of
  them might keepe them as reliques of this so rare and strange a wonder, yet the
  diligence therein vsed might bee verie wise and deuout. Saint
  Chrysostome giues vs this note, That albeit this miracle ought to haue
  left a firme and assured confidence in euerie one of them, yet they were so
  wholly forgetfull thereof, that our Sauiour was driuen afterward to put them
  in mind thereof,
                     Mat. 16. Marc. 8.
  and taxe them of this their obliuion. There are other morall reasons giuen for
  it, writ by diuers vpon this place, which I purposely omit.
               
                  When the men had seene the miracle that Iesus did, said,
  This is of a truth the Prophet that should come into the world. They
  considering the greatnesse of the miracle, but not so much potentiam,
  as qualitatem &amp; nouitatem, the power, as the quatie and noueltie
  thereof; they cried out, This is the Prophet whom the World expecteth. Saint
  Augustine saith, That greater is that miracle which God worketh vpon
  the multiplication of their wheat haruest; but because it is so common, they
  make no great wonder of it. It is natural vnto vs more to admire new, than
  great things. Seneca treating in his Naturall Questions, of our
  extraordinarie comets, which do so much amase the world, saith, That the
  Heauens, the Stars, the Planets, strike no admiration into vs, though it bee a
  meruailous and strange worke, because wee see it is so ordinarie with vs. The
  Sunne is the fairest Creature that euer God dispatched out of his hands
  [Vas admirabile, opus excelsi;] yet the beautie of it's beames doth
  not draw on any admiration; but it's Eclipses, because they are rare and
  seldome. So likewise in the harmonie and concord of the Heauens, their
  influences, and their Starres, together with their disposition, and the
  beautie of the Orbs; Knowest thou the course of Heauen? &amp;c. The
  Greekes expound this place, of the Clouds;
                     Iob.
 38. Who can declare the nature of the Clouds? Who, it's musicke and
  harmonie? Who can make the musicke of the Thunder to cease, or stop the course
  of the Lightning? &amp;c. And all these, though they be such strange wonders,
  do not mooue vs to admire them; but vpon any change or alteration, wee stand
  astonished at the noueltie thereof.
               
                  When Iesus therefore perceiued that they would come and take
  him to make him a King, &amp;c.
                  Courteous behauiour is
 the greatest gaine. Our Sauiour Christ had gained so much good loue and
  opinion amongst them by this his kindnesse that he had shewed toward them, that
  after the people were dismissed (as Euthimius hath obserued it) they
  determined to  make him their King, not onely offering
  him the Crowne, but seeking perforce to set the same on his head. And if the
  consideration of his miracles had beene the occasion thereof, they could not
  haue taken a more discreet resolution; and not onely they, but all the world
  had a great deale of reason to put their helping hand thereunto.
               For first of all, he is painted forth to be so wise, that all
  Ierusalem was strucken dumbe at the wisedome of his words.Fit qualities for a King.
               
               Secondly, Hee was as faire and beautifull to see to, as the
  Sunne in all his glorie.
               Thirdly, He was of that force and power, that he did driue out
  of his temple with whips and scourges, the greatest power of the world.
               Fourthly, He was so open handed, so liberall, and so bountifull,
  that with fiue Loaues and two Fishes, hee did fill the bellies of fifteene or
  twentie thousand persons.
               Fiftly, He loued man so well, that for his sake hee willingly
  layd downe his life, and offered vp his most pretious bodie and bloud vpon the
  Crosse. So that there beeing so many strong and forcible reasons to draw vs to
  loue him, Who would not willingly make choice of him to be their King? But let
  vs that are Christians, acknowledge him to be our King, and shew our selues so
  louing and obedient vnto him, that we seruing him in holinesse and truenesse of
  life, and wholly relying vpon his loue and fauour towards vs, may come at the
  last to be heires of that his heauenly Kingdome. Which God grant for his
  mercies sake.
            
         
         
            
            THE XXVI. SERMON, VPON THE MONDAY AFTER THE FOVRTH SVNDAY IN
LENT.
            
               
                  IOHN 2. MAT. 21. MARC. 11. LVC. 10. 
                  He found sitting in the Temple, sellers of Sheepe, Oxen, and
  Doues, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               OVr Sauiour went vp to Ierusalem to the Passeouer,The greatest miracle that ou
                     •
                   Sauiour euer wrought, was this. &amp; entring into the
temple where the law was read, where the Laitie did pray, he met with a most
base &amp; vile market, where they sould Sheepe, Oxen, Kids, and Doues,
Money-changers, and Vsurers, hauing their bankes. Wherewith inraged, like a
Lyon he sets vpon the owners of them, vpon the beasts, birds, and tables; and
making him a whip of the cords that bound their fardles, or those halters
wherewith they tied their beasts, there was neuer any Roman Cohort that did
that as hee did; hee ouerthrew their tables, scattered their moneys downe on
the ground, and falling to whipping and scourging of them, he chased them out
of his fathers House. Saint Hierome and Saint Chrysostome
reckon this of all other to be the greatest miracle that euer our Sauiour
wrought, preferring it before the giuing of sight to the Blind, of hands and
fee
                  •
                to the Lame, of life to the
Dead, &amp;c. And without doubt it is a thing much to be wondred at, that one
single man, and such a one as amongst the Iews (especially those of the Temple)
was held in such base esteeme, should venture to trample them vnder his feet,
and to whip both great and smal, and that not any one of them should dare to
open his mouth against him. Which was such a disco
                  •
               ering of his Omnipotencie and Godhead,
that wee must imagine it to bee a most foule fault in them, either not to
acknowledge him to be their Messias, or not to lay hold on him and bind him in
bonds, for a mad man; as they afterwards said, Sure he is mad.
            
            
               He found them in the Temple selling Sheepe and Oxen,

gentle, louely, and peaceable;

Hee that hath ears let him heare, &amp;c. yet he neuer took a whip in
his hand, as he did now, to punish either them or their faults; which is a
manifest signe and token, that as his diuine furie did exceed it's bounds, so
did the occasions by them giuen.
            First of all then let me giue you to vnderstand, That Gods brest
can by no meanes brooke the auarice and couetousnesse of the Priests. Saint
Cyril, Saint Chrysostome, and Saint Augustine say,
That those lashes were not onely laid on the flockes of Sheepe, and droues of
Oxen, but also on the Merchants and Priests. And Pope Anacletus, and
Iulius the first, affirme, (which is no more than the Text saith)
Eiecit omnes de Templo, He draue them all out of the Temple, as many
as there bought and sould: where the Pr
                  •
               ests (as it is noted by Beda) reseruing those beasts
aliue, which were offered vp in the Temple, they made sale of them for money;
some of which beasts did passe from one master to another,

                  •
               ix or seuen times, like a jewell
that is brought into an Almoneda or publique out-crie, to be

                  Deut. 14. In Deutronomie God
commanded, That those that liued farre off from the Temple, might make sale of
th
                  •
               ir first fruits and tenths at
home, turning it into money; and when they had so done, to take that mony along
with them, and comming to the Temple, to bestow the same either in Oxen, or
Sheepe, or Wine, or whatsoeuer else he had most mind too: but these Priests for
their own greater gaine, had their Cattell and their moneys there in a
readinesse, for to trucke to their aduantage, and make profit by putting it
forth to vse. Now our Sauior Christ not permit
                  •
               ing the Merchants to make his Temple a house of contractation,
would much lesse giue way that the Ministers of his house should be
Merchant-men, and such as should trade and deale in the world. Saint
Gregorie writing to Nepotianus, saith, Clericum
negotiatorem, ex paupere diuitem, v
                     •
                  pestem fuge, A Clergie man that shall driue a trade in the world,

                     •
                   bee a great Negotiant, whereby
of a poore Minister he becomes a rich Merchant, flie from him as thou wouldest
from the plague. Saint Crysostome is of opinion, That a Merchant
seldome or neuer can please God. And in another place he saith, That few of
them are saued. And Saint Augustine renders the reason of it, That out
of their greedinesse of gaine they liue in an euerlasting kind of lying,
blaspheming at their losses, and forswearing for their profit. And

                  •

Augustine renders in another letter to be Negotiationem tuam,
introibo in potentias Domini, Because I neuer traded nor contracted in this
dealing and winding of commodities too and fro in the world, I hope through
Gods mercie, to see my selfe with him in his glorie. And if in a Lay man
trading and negotiation bee so dangerous; What shall it bee in a Clergie man,

               The honor of Priesthood.The Priesthood
is so soueraigne and so diuine a calling, that in it's purenes, it admits of no
Medium in it's sliding or slipping, but fals from one extreame to another. And
therefore God walkes alwayes with a wand of iustice in his hand, to beate out
the dust of their imperfections. This made him say vnto Moses,
Sanctificab
                     •
                  r ab ijs, qui
appropinquant m
                     •
                  hi. Origen
discoursing, That God is a fire speaketh in his name,
                  Exod. 28. 
               Qui iuxtà me est,
iuxtà ignem est, He that is neere vnto me, is neere vnto the fire.
Now then, if a Priest being partly apparrelled in linnen, and partly annoynted
with oyle, shall draw neere vnto this fire, he had need be very 
 circumspect and carefull, that not so much as the least
sparke thereof light vpon him. Paulus Scaliger saith; That the
Antients painting forth a Priest, place in one of his hands, a diall or
marriners compasse, and in the other the sunne. The compasse, to shew, that he
should be the loadstone of the Common wealth. The sunne, that he might giue
such cleere light, that no tongue might be able to taxe him: That they might
make good that saying of Pythagoras; Aduersus solem ne loquaris. And
because the clouds of the earth should not darken the purenesse of their light,
God did ordaine, that in the land of Promise, those of the tribe of
Leui, to whom the Priesthood did appertaine, should haue no
inheritance allotted vnto them. Who then (will you say) shall find them foode
and rayment? It is answered, The Lord himselfe is the
                     •
                  r inheritance.

  18. They had the Lords portion amongst them, and did inioy the fruits
of the earth without any labour. Alij laborauerunt▪ &amp; vos in
laborem illorum introistis. The Priesthood serued them (as
Pelusiota saith) as a Mediatour betwixt God and man, being bound to
serue and honour the one, and to correct, and instruct the other. And therefore
this Doctor saith, That the Priest ought to be all eyes, and onely blind to
Couetousnesse. But many haue turned their eyes into nayles, to scratch and
scrape together a great deale of wealth. Iudas out of couetousnesse
sold the Sauiour of the world. And would to God he had stayed there. But when
he returned the money to the Temple, he recommended couetousnesse to the
Priests, and making them heires of all that he had, he left nothing for
himselfe, (as the Bishop of Hostia hath obserued) but a halter to hang
himselfe.
            Hence it commeth to passe, that the first step of a Priest, is
Couetousnesse, and euen the first desire, wherewith he entreth into those
sacred Orders. And when he gets in by this dore, you may giue him for lost, and
count him the child o
                  •
                perdition.
Ezechiel painting forth the abhominations of the Temple, places at the
entrance of the gate, the Idoll of Zeale. The Seuenty interpret it, Statuam
possidebitis, To wit, the Idoll of Auarice. And if the roote of all euill
be placed thus at the entrance, it is not much that the Temple should be full
of abhominations within.
            The second occasion, was the Priests cloaking of this their
Auarice,Couetousnes worst, when cloked wit
                     •
                   a shew of Holinesse. with the
colour of Holinesse, and seruice of God. And to make of scandalls, seruices;
Gods breast could not brooke it. It is the common fashion of the world to
disguise a lye, with an apparence of truth, and to dawbe vice with the colour
of vertue; These are the ordinary impostures of Hypocrisie. But some hold them
to be so hurtfull, that if they should be suffered and borne withall any long
time, the world would be vtterly vndone by it. That a woman should dissemble
her euill feature, and the fowlenes of her skin, with rich and well made
clothes, and with borrowed colours, and that her beauty being not her owne, but
a falshood and lye from the head to the foot; she should make it to appeare as
a truth: That a Merchant should carry the name of a very rich and wealthy man,
though he owe a great deale more than he is worth: That a Huckster should sell
Barajas Oliues for those of Seuill, &amp;c. Let it passe, Mundus in maligno
positus est: It is a naughty world. But that an Apothecary should put vpon
a boxe of poyson, a Rotulo, or written Scroll of wholesome physick, and say
rats bane is sugar, it is not a thing to be indured. Lesse are we to suffer
deceits in the medicins and confections for the soule. He that should haue
seen the beasts, the birds, the boords, &amp; the store of money that was
there, and the great noyse of the sacrifices that were there to be made, would
haue thought it had beene the Priests zeale, diuine worship, a relieuing of the
poore, and an easing of those that came a farre off to 
the Temple▪ that they might with the lesse trouble performe their
deuotions, but all this was nothing but couetousnesse, and their greedy desire
of greater gaines. And perhaps for this reason, Saint Iohn called it
the Passeouer of the Iewes. Erat proximum, Pascha Iudaeorum, The Iewes
Passeouer was at hand. Not my Passeouer, but yours; where you doe not
treate of my honour, but of your owne profit, Vias vestras, &amp; sabbatha
vestra, odiuit anima mea, (saith the Prophet Esay.) And the
Prophet Malachie calls these their solemne feasts, dung;
Behold,
               
                  Malac. 2.3. 
               I will cast
dung vpon your faces, euen the dung of your solemne feastes. Not because
they were so in themselues, but because theirayme was their owne priuate
Interest, which is no better than a dunghill in the sight of God.
            The third occasion, was their disrespect to the Temple; where God
euer pretended, that his Maiestie should be more especially respected.
Regna
                     •
                  it deus super omnes
gentes, sedet super sedem sanctam suam. The Maiestie regall vpon earth is
respected throughout the whole iurisdiction of his Crowne, but much more where
he hath his throane and chaire of Estate. God, as he is King of Kings, and Lord
of Lords ouer all the nations of the earth, ought much to be respected; but
more especially, where he hath his throane in euery one of his Kingdomes. In
heauen, at the right hand of his father, which is the supreame throane of his
greatnesse and Maiestie. In the Synagogue he had the Propitiatorie; and in the
Temples,
                  Iosh. 5. the Sacrarium.
When the Angell appeared vnto Ioshua with a drawne sword, and
commanded him to put his shooes from off his feet, diuerse graue Doctors doe
concurre in this, that this Angell was the Sonne of God, as hee had before
appeared vnto Moses in the bush, commanding him the like. Wherein he
notified two things vnto them:
            The one; the reuerence that they ought to beare to that place,
where he did so especially manifest himselfe; For the ground wherein thou
standest is holy ground. By our feete, are meant our affections; by our
shooes, our cares. And many nations tooke from thence the putting off of their
shooes, when they entred into the Temple.
            The other; That against those, who should loose this respect to
that place, the sword was drawne to slay them, and fire prepared to burne and
consume them. Ezechiel painting out the abhominations of the Temple,
saith; Behold there came sixe from the way of the vpper gate, which looketh
towards the North, and euerie one of them had, Vasa interfectionis, the vessels
of slaughter in his hand. The 70 translate it, Septem secures, Seuen
hatchets. It is Theodorets obseruation, that against all
Zenacharibs Armie, God sent forth but one Angell onely; but against
the prophaners of his Temple, six, according to the number of the dayes of the
Week: because there should not that day passe ouer their head, wherin some new
Executioner or other, should not but rise vp to torment them. In
multitudine misericordiae tuae introibo in domum tuam, adorabo ad Templum
sanctum tuum in timore tuo. Caietan reades it, In multitudine gratiae
tuae. He that is predestinated to saluation, hath that respect to Gods
house, that if hee did not persuade himselfe that he stood in his grace and
fauour, he would not dare to presume to put his foot within the doores thereof:
and should he presume so to do, he would leane himselfe against the corner of
the first pillar he came at, not daring (like the Publican) to lift vp his
eyes. But your Pharasaicall Hypocrite makes as bold with gods house as with his
owne: He lies here and lies there; sweares here and swears there; murmures here
and murmures there; he liues there as if there were no God; and liues here as
if God did not see him. And that which causeth the more feare and horror is,
That many times they meet at the Church for to  treat and
talke of their greatest villanies. Saint Ierome against
Vigilancius saith, Confiteor timorem meum, I confesse my
feare. When entring into the Temple of the Martyrs, I conceiue any anger
or euill thought in my mind; or when sleeping I haue had any euill dreame, it
makes my body and soule to tremble: Now then, when entring into Gods house, I
quake and tremble when I am to receiue, what can I doe withall? By
Ezechiell, God complaines of those rich men that built their houses
neere vnto his, Qui fabricati sunt limen suum iuxta limen meum.
Ioyning wall to wall to my house, they haue prophaned my name with their
abhominations, And I consumed them in my wrath. Being then, that God
cannot indure such bad neighbourhood, Wil he beare with those impudencies that
as it were in despight, ye doe before his face? Saint Ierome hath
noted vpon Esay, that amongst other things that Salomon
offended God in, one was, That hee had built vp such a high Turret in his
pallace, that it ouertopt the Temple, and did ouerlooke it. For Gods house
ought not to be inferiour to mans; What shal we say then to those that make it
a den of theeues?
            It hath beene obserued, That all those great and powerfull Princes
which haue presumed to presse into Gods Temples, haue come to an euill end.
Sabellicus reports of Pompey, that hauing bin formerly verie
fortunat, after thathe had presumed to prophane the Temple, by entring into the
Sancta sanctorum, nothing afterwards prospered with him.
            The fourth occasion was, Christs great zeale to his House,The nature of 
                     ••
                  ue
  zeale. 
               Zelus domus tuae come
                     •
                  it me, The zeale of thy House hath deuoured me, or eaten me
vp. Where it is to be noted, That it is one thing to eat and feed vpon the
zeale of Gods House, and his seruice; and another thing, to be eaten of it: one
while there is an Ecclesiasticall; another while a secular Iudge, which is
verie diligent in his office, out of the hatred that he hath to Delinquents,
and hee is held to bee a verie zealous man. But hee eats, growes fat, and
waxeth rich with this his zeale; and such a one eats of the zeale of the house
of God, but is not eaten of it. But there are others that are dried vp and
consumed of the zeale which they beare to the Seruice of God; [Tabescere
me fecit zelus meus] who wasting their wealth, their health, and their
liues in this their zeale, doe more resent the wrongs that are done to God,
than those that are offered to themselues. Saint Paul saith, Quis
scandalizatur, &amp; ego non vror? Which made Saint Chrysostome
to say, That of six hundred thousand miracles, one cannot bee found that may
bee compared with this his zeale: his owne tribulations and torments, he calls
them Glorie; and the offences done vnto God, he calls Fire, which burnes him.
Lo here a miracle, a strange kind of zeale.
            Zeale is the Child of Loue; but it is somewhat more inflamed, and
more pure than Loue. To Loue we attribute two powerfull effects:
            The one,Loue and zeale wherein
  different. That it is the authour of the greatest acts and noblest
exployts that man can performe. Esay in his ninth Chapter maketh an
enumeration of Gods greatest acts, To vs a Child is borne, to vs a sonne is
giuen, the gouernment is vpon his shoulder▪ &amp;c. And for an vpshot
of these his glorious acts, he addeth this, Zelus Domini exercituum faciet
hoc, The zeale of the Lord of Hosts shall doe this. Amongst Gods
attributes, we consider a celestiall competencie in the greatest mysteries of
his life, and of his death; but in the end, Loue gets the victorie and glory of
the day.
            The second effect of Loue is, To conuert it selfe wholly to the
seruice of the thing beloued. He that is enamoured of God, will willingly
pardon the iniuries that are done to himselfe; but those that are offered to
God, hee will neuer forgiue. And Ecclesiasticus renders the reason of
it; Cognoui quod in multa scientia,  multa sit
indignatio, He that hath little knowledge of God, finds himselfe but
little offended, when the Maiestie of God is wronged and abused; but hee that
knowes much, is much offended, when offence is offered to the partie he loues.
A little child is neuer offended at vice or vicious men: Cum essem
parvulus, sapiebam vt parvulus; but a well growne man, will like
Mathias, kill an Idolator, or like Phineas, slay a
fornicator, and set vpon a blasphemer, &amp;c. or vpon a whole citie, like
Simeon and Leui.
            
            
               Et cumfecisset quasi flagellum.
               
                  Gods chastiseme
                        •
                     ts here, more in shew than substance
                  He made
  as it were a whip. For the chasticements of God in this life, seeme to be
  whips and scourges, but they are not; Quasi morientes, &amp; ecce
  viuimus. No like, is the same; &amp; that which is as it were such a
  thing, is not the thing it selfe. Our life seemeth to be death, but it is not
  death; our portion pouertie, but it is not so; Sicut egentes, multos autem
  locupletantes. There are three reasons of this Truth:
               The one, That these whips come short of those scourges at the
  day of Iudgement, which will be most fearefull and most terrible. Saint
  Mathew cals them but the beginning of sorrowes, Ha
                        •
                      autem initia sunt dolorum. Those
  are not sorrowes,
                     Mat. 24. which are so soone
  ended. Of Antiochus his cruelties, whose souldiers slew in three
  dayes fourescore thousand persons, captiuated fortie thousand, and sould as
  many more for slaues, not pardoning either old men, women, or children; the
  Text saith, Propter peccata, &amp;c. For the sinnes of those that inhabited
  the Citie, God was a little angrie. Of those cruell torments which the
  Martyrs endured, being fried, roasted, broyled, dragged, quartered, and sawne
  in sunder; Wisedome saith,
                     Wisd 3.5.
                  They are punished in few things, but in many things shall they be wel
  rewarded.
               
               Another reason, Because these whips are not directed to our hurt
  and perdition, but for our amendment; as Iudith said in the siege of
  Bethulia, Haec ipsa supplicia, non ad perditionem, sed ad emendationem
  euenisse credamus. They are the whips of a father, that will not kill his
  sonne, but correct and amend him. And therefore Dauid calls this
  whip, Virgam Directionis, The rod of Direction.
               
               The third and last, Because whips and scourges are perforce;
  for, to giue one a stripe or a lash, you must perforce hold the whip in your
  hand, and straine your selfe thereunto. And therefore it is said, Cum
  fecisset quasi flagellum. Christ had neuer a whip about him, the Merchants
  themselues put it into his hands. Seneca saith, That the nature of the
  gods are so farre from anger either towards others, or in themselues; and of
  that goodnesse, clemencie, louingnesse, and peaceablenesse, that if they
  stretch out their arme, or lift vp their hand to punish you, you your selues
  must force and driue them thereunto by your sinnes and offences. And therefore
  Esay saith, Indignatio non est mihi, Quis mihi dabit Spinam &amp;
  Veprem? Saint Hierome, My People will not beleeue that I can be
  angrie, they take me to be so good &amp; so louing, that they cannot presume
  that any anger can proceed from my brest; Who will furnish me with a Thorne or
  a Bramble, that I may make my People to feare me? Iob treating of the
  Deuill, said, Ipse est principium viarum Dei,
                  
                     Iob 40. 
                  He is the chiefe of the wayes of
  God. Saint Thomas saith vpon this place, That God hath two
  wayes:
               The one of mercie.
               
                  God hath two wayes, one of iustice, another
 of mercy. The other of justice.
               The former is mentioned by Dauid, Vniuersae viae Domini,
  misericordia, &amp; veritas; All the wayes of God, are Mercy and Truth.
  God was Author of the first, by  creating man in
  Paradise, for to translate him from thence to heauen. But the diuell running a
  contrary course, gaue the first beginning to the way of Iustice. For if there
  had beene no fault, there had beene no punishment. Two things Eliphaz
  told Iob, when he came to comfort him:
               The one; That God was neuer Authour of the death of the
  righteous.
               The other; That many sinners perished at the breath of his
  nostrills.
               
                  Quin potius inueni multos, flante deo perijsse. Where,
  by the way, Saint Gregorie hath noted, That for to breath, outward
  ayre is necessarie; the ayre must bee without; so that thou art he, that makest
  thine owne rod, and that prouidest materialls for God. According to that of
  Solomon,
                  
                     Prou. 5. 
                  His owne
  iniquities shall take the wicked himselfe, and he shall be holden with the
  cords of his owne sinne. The gluttonie made the whip for thy gout; thy
  vncleannesse, for thy pocks; thy sweates and colds, for thy sciatica; thy
  paintings, for thy Megrims in the head, thy wrincles in thy forehead, and the
  stinkingnesse of thy breath; thy Couetousnesse, for thy insatiable and
  vnquenchable thirst; and thy ambition, for thy continuall torment. The King of
  Tyrus said; Deus ego sum; I am a God, But God hereunto made answer;
  Producam ergo ignem in medio tui,
                  
                     Ezech
 28.1
                        •
                     . 
                  I will produce a
  fire in the midst of thee. Whereupon Theodoret saith; Thy pride
  and ambition shall be the twigs that shall make a rod to lash thee.
               And from hence we may collect these two things.
               The one, That for God to make an end of a sinner, neither
  thunders,God needs no weapons to destroy the wicked.
  nor lightnings, nor earth-quakes are necessarie; but that the breath of his
  mouth, or the twinckling of his eye, is sufficient. In thered sea he did turne
  but his eye vpon Pharaoh, and presently ouerturned all his Charriots.
  That which is to be feared, is that hand wherein the whip is: A hempen cord is
  more to bee feared in the hand of a valiant man, than a dagger in the hand of a
  child. Miseremini mei, miseremini mei, sal
                        •
                     ēvos amici mei, quia monaus Domini tetigit me. Iob called all
  his stripes, The touch of Gods hand; and this is that which ought to be
  feared.
               The other, is the whip of Hell, those here are but gentle
  stripes, and short; but those in Hell full of torment, and more heauie.
               First, for that the latter are eternal, A fire is kindled in
  my rage, and it shall burne, euen to the lowest hell. So that a worse
  miserie cannot be imagined. Our Sauiour Christ said to Magdalen; Optimam
  partem elegit sibi Maria, Mary hath chosen the better part; And the reason
  was, Non auferetur ab ea in aternum, It shall continue with her for
  euer. But of the damned we may say, Pessimam partem elegit,
                  All paines but pastimes to those of hell. 
                  Hee hath
  chosen the worser part, for that his torment shall indure for euer.
               Secondly; for that the former are more gentle. For there is no
  paine in this life, which hath not some declination: And therefore your
  sorrowes vpon earth are compared to riuers that ebbe and flowe. But Hell is
  like a standing poole, that is alwaies at one and the same stay. And therefore
  it is said in the Apocalips, Death and Hell were cast into the lake of
  fire.
               
               
                  Take these things hence, make not my fathers house, a house
  of merchandize, &amp;c. Twice (as it is obserued by Saint
  Augustine) did our Sauiour Christ worke this myracle.
               The first; when he first began to preach.
               The second; towards the time of his passion.
               Of the first; Saint Iohn onely makes mention.
               Of the second; the rest of the Euangelists.
               And albeit the circumstances of the doing therof were not one
  and the same, yet the occasions were both alike. So that if we shall summe them
  vp both together  wee shall see in our Sauiour Christ
  the print or stampe of a most perfect Prince, who proceeded with exceeding
  great equallitie, without accepting of persons, or any other partialitie in the
  world. Not permitting that either hatred, loue, feare, or his owne priuate
  interest (which, according to Isidore) are those foure enemies to
  Iustice) should make the beame of the ballance to sway awrie.
               There is not any businesse of greater difficultie in the world,
  than to gouerne, it is the Art of Arts; and the Science of Sciences; not onely,
  because to hit the vaine aright of such v
                     •
                  rious dispositions, is a thing as it were impossible, so
  inscrutable a thing is the heart of man: but also, for that man amongst all
  other creatures is the most vngratefull, and forgetfull. In that pretension of
  the Priesthood, there was great debate and contention amongst Gods people; for
  the better according whereof, and to appease this tumult, God commanded, that
  euery one should put a rod or wand into the Tabernacle, and that which they
  should find to be budded forth the next morning, he whose it was, should enioy
  that dignitie. And in the end, there was but one onely rod that was budded.
  Gregory N
                        •
                     ssen askes the
  question, Why in the passage of Iordan, God commanded, That euery Tribe should
  put a stone into the bed of the riuer; and would here haue but one onely rod to
  bud? whereunto he makes answer; That it is not much, that the remembrance and
  acknowledgement of a common benefit should be common: but to gouern with
  perfection, &amp; for the budding forth of such faire flowers, it is enough, if
  amongst many there be but one to be found. For this is a white crow, a blacke
  swan, &amp;c. And it was fit that the person of our Sauiour Christ should be a
  patterne and example which they should looke vpon and imitate, who gouerne the
  world; to the end, that though they do not attaine to the perfection of
  gouernment, nor reach to the true height thereof; yet at least, they may loue
  it and desire the same; according to that of Wisd. Loue iustice, ye that
  iudge the earth.
               
               Many things may he that gouernes, draw from this patterne.
               
                  Magistrates must be bold in reforming publike
 abuses.The first is; Courage and Valour. There was not that man, though
  neuer so valiant in Ierusalem, no nor in the whole world, whom the authoritie
  of the Priests would not make to turne cow. And here our Sauiour Christ with a
  whip of cords chases them all away, leauing them amazed, ashamed, and
  confounded. The Scripture blazons out the noble deeds of Dauid, and
  the valiant Acts of his Captaines. Ecclesiasticus saith; That
  Dauid playd with Lyons as with Kids, and with Beares as with
  Lambes.
                     Eccles. 47. 2. Reg. 23. 1.
 Chron.
                   And that Adino of Ezni, one of his mightie men,
  slew eight hundred at one time. That Abishai the brother of
  Ioab, lifted vp his speare against three hundred and slew them. That
  Benaiah slew two mightie Gyants of Moab, and slew a Lyon in the midst
  of a pit in the time of Snow; and another Aegyptian man of great stature; he
  hauing a speare in his hand, and the other but a staffe, Virum dignum
  spectaculo: Who had a lance like a Weauers beame. All these were famous
  acts; but none of them came neere to that of Sampson, who with the
  iawe-bone of an asse, did set vpon three thousand armed Philistims which came
  to take him, &amp; slew a thousand of them. God had famous Captains amongst his
  people, who with celestiall fury did set vpon his enemies, killed men of
  moustrous might and stature, and valiant huge Gyants. But that one with a whip
  onely should cast out such a rabble of Iewes, force out so many merchants, and
  driue so many Priests out of the Temple, none but our Sauiour could doe this.
  If (saith Saint Ierome) with a bare whip in his hand, such a fearefull
  number fled from his presence, What terrour shall he cause in the day 
   of iudgement, when with a naked sword in his mouth, he
  shall pronounce the sentence of eternall death? He that shall not assume valour
  and courage vnto him, and shall not put on a stout resolution in reforming
  publike abuses, let him not gouerne at all, Noli quaerere fieri judex, nisi
  virtute valeas irrumpere iniquitatem. If thou doest not finde in thy selfe
  spirit and mettall, to cast downe to the ground (laying aside all humane
  respects) those grosse abuses that are not to be borne withall, though the
  multitude should neuer so much oppose thee, seeke not for the Vara or
  Rod of a Iudge. Iob. Si expaui ad multitudinem nimiam, &amp; despectio
  propinquorum terruit me, Let this and that plague light vpon mee, &amp;c.
  But if neither the peoples multitude, nor my friends and kins folkes
  importunitie, could preuaile with mee to make mee peruert Iustice, and to
  faile in the execution of good gouernement, why then ô Lord, &amp;c.
  A
                        •
                     hish King of the
  Philistimes, banished Dauid out of his Kingdome, though hee knew how
  much his person did import him, for feare of his Princes displeasure. Viuit
  dominus, quia rectus es, sed satrapis non places. Here was a cowardly
  King.
               The second thing, that he that gouernes may draw from this
  paterne, is;Magistrates must heede morethe conuersion of
 the offendor than the correction of his offence. A true weight and
  measure in punishing. To those that sold the Doues, hee sayd, Auferte ista
  hinc, For this was not in it selfe an vnlawfull kind of trading, had it
  not beene in regard of the place. Besides, they were poore people, and if there
  were any indulgence or fauour to be showne in those scourges of our Sauiour, it
  should haue beene vsed towards them. But some Iudges, Dan palos de
  ciego; bestow their blowes like blind men; so as they hit some bodie, they
  care not whome. The Fruiterer sels fruits that are not ripe; Goe thou and root
  vp all the trees that are in his garden. There are many, in drinking wine, that
  take a cup too much, go thou presently, &amp; pluck vp the Vines.
  Plutarch in his booke of morall Vertues, reports, That
  Lycurgus commanded the same to be done in Thrace. A mad-headed Colt,
  that is wilde and kickish, it is not good counsaile to kill him, but to breake
  him of his knauish qualities and to make him tame and gentle. Nor is it good
  aduice to destroy the Vines, but that men should be brought to drinke
  moderately, and to temper their wine with water. In a word, The delinquent
  ought not alwayes to be cut off and destroyed, but to be brought to amendment.
  And it is verie fit and conuenient, that a Iudge should now and then dissemble,
  and make as though he did not see. Nonne dissimulaui, nonne silui, nonne
  quieui, saith Iob. Saul in the beginning of his raigne was a
  verie good King, Puer vnius anni erat Saul, cum regnare caepisset.
  Saul was a child of a yeare old, when hee began to raigne, so humble and
  meeke minded was he then, and though hee were wronged verie much, and much
  euill spoken of him behind his backe, Dissimulabat non audire, He would
  take no notice of it,
                  1. Reg. 10. but
  made as if he knew of no such matter. The booke of Wisedome saith,
  That God doth dissemble our sinnes,
                     Sap.
                     
                        •
                     1.20. and maketh as though
  he saw not the sinnes of men, because they should amend. And the Apostle Saint
  Paul saith (taxing the Athenians of that idolatrous Alter of theirs,
  whereon was written, Vnto the vnknowne God;) That the time of this
  their ignorance God regarded not,
                     Act. 17.30.
  but now hee admonisheth all men euerie where to repent. But when a Iudge is
  forced and driuen to punish, the best course is (if he can) to worke the
  offendors amendment.Mercy to be preferred before
 justice. If our Sauiour Christ should haue whipt the Doues, they would
  haue flowne vp and downe the Temple, and that was no good meanes for to driue
  them foorth. And if a Gouernor shall at any time exceed, the excesse of pittie
  is the lesse euill. Saint Gregorie saith, That false Iustice, is all
  indignation; and that true Iustice, is full of compassion. The glorious Doctor
  Saint Ambrose calleth Mercie, The better part of Iustice; and that 
   out of the bowells of Iustice, Mercie is begot. Saint
  Gregorie, That the one without the other, is lame and imperfect. In
  the Arke of the Testament, Aarons rod and the pot of Manna were placed
  together, Seueritie and Softnesse, Iustice and Mercie; which ought to be the
  Iudges Compasse whereby he is to shape his course. One of the seuerest
  punishments which is in the holy Scripture, is that which Zacharie
  painteth forth touching impietie,
                     Zac. 4. in
  the Ephah, which was a kind of pot or measure containing some ten pottles,
  being stopped close with abal of lead of the weight of a Talent, and a woman
  sitting in the midst thereof, whose name was Wickednesse. And lo there
  came out two women, and tooke vp this pot by the two ears from the ground, and
  carried it to the land of Shinar. Great were the Idolatries of this his People,
  and it was fit that they should be seuerely punished; yet notwithstanding,
  these two women that carried this pot into a strange Countrie, had wings like a
  Kyte, quasi alas Milui; which make many planes, and a smooth flight:
  but the word in the originall deriue these wings from another Bird, which
  signifieth Pittie. And therefore Montanus renders it thus,
  Ala
                        •
                      Ciconiae, They had wings
  like the wings of a Storke; Which is held to be a Foule full of pittie. Of
  some rigorous Iudges the Delinquents may verie wel say, Would to God that my
  punishments and my faul
                     •
                  s were
  weighed together in a ballance, then would plainly appeare to the eye of the
  World, with what inequalitie the Iudge hath proceeded against me.
               The third thing for our learning, which we may draw from hence,
  is, That our Sauiour proceeded more seuerely and more rigorously against your
  Vsurers and Money-changers, breaking and throwing downe their tables, and
  scattering abroad their money.
               First, Because in it selfe, and it's owne nature, it was an
  vnlawfull kind of trading, and therefore fit that the occasion thereof should
  bee taken away, and haue no longer footing, especially in the Temple.
               Secondly, Because money is a thing that clingeth close to the
  heart of man. The glorious Doctor Saint Chrysostome did weigh this
  well, in that case of his, who stole the wedge of gold in the spoyles of
  Iericho. Ioshuah turning himselfe towards the Sunne and the Moone, he
  said vnto them, Sol contra Gabaon ne mouearis, &amp; Luna, contra vallem
  Ayalon. Hee made likewise a Proclamation, That none should priuily conuey
  away any gold, siluer, or other prisall. Achan lighted on a wedge of
  gold, tooke it vp, and hid it. Where he obserueth, That the Sunne and Moone
  obeying the order and command of this valiant Captain, one of his owne
  souldiers refused to obey him, and only because the wedge of gold was wedged
  too close to his heart. He likewise threw their money about, and scattered it
  all abroad, in token, That when the couetous man least thinkes on it,
  Diuitias quas deuorauerat, euomet, &amp; de ventre eius extrahet illas
  Deus, Hee shal vomit vp the riches which he hath swallowed, and God shall
  plucke them out of his bellie. In antient time they did stampe or ingraue
  vpon their coyne an Oxe, a creature that in his feeding goes still backeward:
  which is the hieroglyphicke or embleme of a couetous man,
                     Prou. 23. who the more he eats, the more backeward
  he goes; Set not thy eyes nor thy thoughts vpon riches; for when thou least
  thinkest of it, they shall betake them to their wings like an Eagle, and shall
  flie vp to heauen. Riches that are ill gotten, flie vp to Gods tribunall
  seat, and there like so many fiscalls or busie Attornies, accuse thee for an
  vniust possessor of them, and crie out as loud against thee, as the bloud of
  Abel against his brother Cain.
               
               
                  Old sores requi
                        •
                     e much scraping.The fourth thing that wee may
  draw from this patterne, is, That a Prince ought more sharpely to correct those
  abuses and vices which are growne old  through custome;
  especially those of your great and powerfull Ministers, who commit them without
  controlement by publike authoritie. God deliuer vs from those Ministers who
  sell that for their priuate profit, which they are bound to doe gratis
  out of their Office; and from that Priest which makes sale of the
  administration of the Sacraments; from that Confessor that will be soundly payd
  for his Absolution; From that Iudge that will be bribed before hee will doe
  iustice; and from that Secretary that makes sutors come off roundly for their
  quicker dispatch. These be things that send many of them quicke to hell. The
  Pharisees should haue kept their Temple cleane from all couetousnesse, haue
  banished your Merchants bankes, and haue fauoured and graced those their
  Sacrifices; in stead whereof they sold those beasts that were to be offered,
  made money of them, and put the same forth to vse and profit, as others
  did.
                     Ezech. 22.26. 
                  Sacerdotes eius,
  contempserunt legē meam, &amp; à sabbatis mois ouerterunt oculos suos,
  &amp; coinquinabar in medio eorum, The Priests of my Temple haue broken my
  Law, and haue defiled my holy things; They haue put no difference betweene the
  holy and prophane, neyther d
                        •
                     scerned betweene the vncleane and the cleane; and haue hid their
  eyes from my Sabboths, and I am prophaned amongst them. Where I would haue
  you by the way to waigh that same word, coinquinabar. For the
  Ministers of a State being theeues, they make their Lord &amp; Master likewise
  a theef, thou hast made my house a den of theeues, by being thy selfe a
  companion of theeues: According to that of Esay, Socij furum. And
  therefore Christ lasheth them with whips; a sitting punishment for theeues.
  Saint Ierome saith, That he is a theefe, and makes the Church a den of
  theeues, Qui lucrum de religione reportat, Who out of the duty of his
  Ecclesiasticall dignity, makes priuat gaine and profit to himselfe. Saint
  Gregory is of the same minde. And as Theodosius the Emperour
  said: Quid poterit esse securum, si sanctitas as incorrupta, corrumpatur?
  What can be secure, if incorrupted Sanctity shall be corrupted? Which is
  all one with that of Iob; That a Gouernour should rob widowes, and
  deuoure their houses, being bound to defend and protect them;
                     Iob. 24. that he should strip that poore man naked
  whom he ought to cloath; this is a great crueltie. There is a curse that lyes
  vpon them that shall lead away the Asse of the fatherlesse, and take the
  widowes Oxe to pledge, that shall rise early for a prey, cause the naked to
  lodge without garment, and without couering in the cold, and to plucke the
  fatherlesse from the breast, &amp;c. It is so due a debt which Princes owe, to
  fauour, succour, and defend the right of the poore, of the fatherlesse, and of
  the widow, that Cassiodorus in his thirty nine epistle, saith, That it
  is as needlesse and superfluous a businesse to aske it at his hands, as to sue
  to that which is heauy to descend downeward, or to that which is light to
  ascend vpward. But Saluianus lamenting the miseries of his times,
  complaineth, That your great and powerfull Ministers, in stead of complying
  with their obliga
                     •
                  ion, and in stead
  of fauouring and defending their poore Vassalls, sell them Iustice at a deare
  rate: Verifying that lamentation of Ieremy, Aquam nostram pecunia bibimus,
  &amp; ligna nostra praetio comparauimus, Selling vnto them the water of their
  wells, and a sticke of fire from their hearthes. And would to God they
  would but sell their water and their wood, as others vse to doe at common and
  ordinary rates; for then there would something remaine to the buyer: but there
  is a new kind of tyranny now adayes,Sale of offices, the
 ruine of a Kingdome. he that sells, wraps and wrings all he can vnto
  him, but returnes nothing; takes all, but giues not a dodkin to the poore:
  whereas he that buyes, giues all that hee hath, and receiueth nothing. And
  therefore in that Countrey or Kingdome where the Great ones are all so
  generally bad, it is no great wonder, that Religion, Iustice, and whatsoeuer
  else belonging to gouernment, should be sold and  set
  forth to sale. Ieroboam made of the lowest of the people, Priests of
  the high places. Who would giue most money might consecrate himselfe, and bee
  of the Priests of the high places which; thing (as the Text sayth) turned vnto
  sinne to the house of Ieroboam, euen to root it out and destroy it
  from the face of the Earth. Simon Magus sought to buy the grace of the
  holy Ghost: What his gracelesse pretension came to I neede not tell you,
                     Act. 3. you knowing already how deare it cost him.
  The Emperour Iustinian sayd, That the selling of Iustice in a
  Commonwealth was the vtter vndoing of it: for why should not that Iudge or
  Officer robbe and steale, who payd so great a summe of money for his
  Commission? What would a Theefe, an Adulterer, or a Murderer care, if hee knew
  he might redeeme his offence with money? He that buyes, must of force sell; So
  sayd Alexander Seu
                        •
                     rus:
  And therefore he would neuer consent (as Lampridius reporteth it)
  that any office, at least of Iurisdiction, should bee sold in the Empire. The
  Priests therefore of the Temple selling the sayd oblations, it is not much that
  our Sauiour should whip them, and that hee should call them Theeues.
               The last thing that a gouernor may draw from this patterne, is
  perseuerance. There are many which are (as the Glosse hath vpon the decretals)
  Primo fer
                        •
                     ens, &amp; postea
  deficiunt, Hot at first, and afterwards grow cold. When they are a little
  warme in their place, they flagge and fall off, punishing one, and freeing
  another, and both vniustly: They wincke at theeues and robbers on the high way,
  they cancell Deedes, falsifie Records, conceale Writings, alter Euidences,
  foist in false indictments, set delinquents at libertie, facilitate causes, and
  a thousand the like disorders, to the great detriment and disauthoritie of
  Iustice. And therefore they make the Crane, the Hieroglyph of a good Iudge,
  which neuer changes his plumes, but is all of one and the same colour, both in
  his youth, and in his age.
               Out of this Historie, I shall inferre three or foure
  conclusions.
               The first, if the selling of birds, and beasts in the Temple,
  bee so offensiue in the sight of our Lord God: What shall the selling in the
  Church bee, of benefices and Ecclesiasticall dignities? Who although they make
  no publike sale of them, or open profession of it; yet do these men sell Doues
  in the Temple, Qui de impositione manus pretium accipiunt, Hinc enim est,
  quod sacri Canones symo
                        •
                     iacam
  haeresim damnant.
               
               The second, If God so punish this slight respect which is showne
  to his Temple, where there was neither the Arke of the Testament,
  Aarons rod, the pot of Manna, nor the booke of the Law; How will he
  punish the prophaning of that Temple, where himselfe is consecrated in the
  Sacraments of his blessed body and bloud, and where his holy word is
  preached?
               The third, If he be so highly offended with the prophaning of a
  dead Temple; what will he say to the prophaning of that liuing Temple of thy
  soule, which he made choice of for his delight &amp; recreation? Delitia
  meae, esse cum filijs hominū. Origen expounding that place of Exod.
  Dominus Zelotes nomen ei
                        ••
                     ,
  saith, That there is not any thing that puts more iealousie into Gods bosome,
  than that soule which after it hath receiued Baptisme, confessed the Faith, and
  made a marriage with God by receiuing his blessed Sacraments, should afterwards
  become a whoore to the Deuill, the World, and the Flesh.
               The last, If hee did driue out of this earthly Temple, the
  Merchants and Priests, in this sharpe and seuere manner and with such a deale
  of disgrace;
                     Apoc. 22. What will hee doe when
  hee shall come to cast them out of that glorious Temple of 
   Heauen, Foris, canes impudici, Out with these
  dogges. And till they come thither,
                     Apoc.
 22. the good and bad fishes shall bee both together; the chaffe and the
  corne, the tares and the wheate; the ministers of Christ, and the priests of
  Beliall. But then, that powerfull voyce of the Iudge, pronouncing this heauie
  sentence, Ite maledicti in ignem aeternum, shall seperate the one from
  the other with an eternall banishment.
               
                  Destroy this Temple, and in three dayes, I will build it vp
  againe. The turbation of this scourging being ouerpast, the Iewes came
  vnto our Sauiour and asked him, Quod signum ostendis nobi
                        •
                     
                     ▪ quod haec facis? What signe
  showest thou vnto vs, that thou doost these things? The rest of the
  Euangelists renders it thus, In qua potestate, haec faci
                        •
                     , By what power or authoritie, doost
  thou doe these things? Seeming tacitely to grant, that it was ill done,
  and worse permitted, that any market should bee kept there. But because it did
  not appertaine vnto al to amend those things that are amisse, but to him that
  hath power &amp; authoritie so to do, they said to him; Wherby wilt thou make
  it appeare vnto vs, that thou doost not vsurpe another mans office, and meddle
  with that which belongs not vnto thee? Whereunto our Sauiour answered,
  Soluite Templum hoc, &amp; in tribus diebus excitabo illud. In which
  words he did prefigure forth vnto them, his Death, and Resurrection. Which were
  two such Mysteries, as did most discouer all Gods Attributes. Touching his
  death our Sauiour had said already, Si exaltaueritis filium Hominis,
  cognoscetis quia ego sum. But they were like blind men, groping against a
  wall, in this knowledge of his person. And therefore hee said vnto them; When
  yee shall haue lifted mee vp vpon the Crosse, ye shall then know, Quis ego
  sum, Who I am. Which ego sum, is a blazon, onely belonging vnto
  God: and this the Crosse did discouer. Zacheus clambered vp vpon a
  tree, that he might see our Sauior Christ, as well in regard that hee could not
  come neere vnto him for the prease of the people, the throng was so great; as
  also by reason that hee was but a little man, and of a low stature. Whereupon
  Origen giues this note, That there are not any Gyants in the world, no
  not the tallest of them all, but are Pigmies and dwarfes when they come to
  looke God in the face; and must bee faine to clamber vp to those faire goodly
  trees of the vertues, &amp; to the top bough of perfection; which will cost vs
  a great deale of trouble and labor, before we can get vp so high. And therefore
  our Sauiour Christ to saue vs so much paines, and that wee maywith greater ease
  come vnto him, he saith, Exaltate, &amp;c. Put me vp vpon the Crosse,
  and not onely you, that boast your selues of Learning, and Religion, but the
  ruder rable, those souldiers that whipt mee, and those that did execution vpon
  my bodie shall come to know me. And this shall be your Cognoscetis quia ego
  sum.
               
               These wordes, Vidimus gloriam eius, gloriam quasi vnigeniti
  à patre, We haue seene his glorie as the glorie of the onely begotten of
  the Father. Saint Chrysostome declares them of his death; for
  then he shewed himselfe of what house hee came, and whose son he was. Saint
  Paul saith, If they had knowne what they had done, they would
  neuer haue crucified the Lord of Glorie. Where Chrysostome
  obserueth, That in a gallant season they called him the Lord of Glorie, hauing
  neuer before shewed himselfe such a glorious Lord, as then: His armes stretched
  out vpon the Crosse, were those two spreading wings wherewith hee flew vp to
  Heauen; and vnder which he did clocke and defend vs here vpon Earth from the
  rapine of the Deuill, as the Hen doth her Chickins from the Kyte. S.
  Ierome, and Hugo Cardinalis, alledge vpon this occasion that
  verse of Dauid, Et sub pennis eius sperabis. As also that place of
  Malachie, Orietur vobis sol Iustitiae, &amp; sanitas in pennis eius.
  And the Sunne pulled in his head as well for shame as sorrow, when hee saw
  another  Sunne to appeare, that was greater than
  himselfe, whose beames spred abroad saluation to the whole World. The Title of
  the fourth Psalme is, Pro sanguinolento, For the bloudie man. Another
  letter hath it, Danti aternitatem, To the gi
                        •
                     er of eternitie; The one agreeing well with the
  other, for that Sanguinolentus, to wit, our Sauiour that suffered for
  vs vpon the Crosse, and there shed his bloud for the Remission of our sinnes,
  was that which did dare nobis aeter
                        •
                     itatem, gi
                        •
                     e vs
  eternitie.
               
               His Resurrection, Saint Chrysostome declares in these
  words, Qui praedestinatus est filius Dei, ex resurrectione mortuorum,
  Another letter hath it, Qui declaratus est: this following afterwards
  vpon the necke of it, Soluite templum hoc, &amp;c. Where it is noted
  by Saint Cyril, That our Sauiour did not commaund them to destroy his
  bodie, but did thereby aduise them, what they would doe vnto him; Ye shall
  destroy the Temple of my bodie, and I will build it vp againe the third day,
  and this shall be a manifest, a certaine, and a sure signe vnto you. Other his
  Miracles, though they were signes sufficient enough, yet were they not so
  effectuall, because by those other, the conuerted were but few; but in the
  Resurrection, they were without number,
                     Act.
 2.3.4.5. as it appeareth out of the Acts.
               
               Our Sauior Christs answer was somewhat of the darkest to their
  clouded vnderstanding. And albeit they drew from thence a different sense and
  contrarie meaning, yet might it serue as a signe vnto them, that hee was able
  to doe that which he did. And they that would deny, that he could destroy the
  Temple, and build it vp againe in three dayes, which was but a materiall
  Temple; would more stifly denie, that he could dye, and rise againe the third
  day, by his owne vertue and power. Saint Matthew accuseth these men to
  be false witnesses. Hic dixit, (which was the Iewes accusation)
  Possum destruere Templum Dei.
               
               First; because they did wrest the sence and true meaning of our
  Sauiour.
               Secondly; because they did alter and change the words.
               Thirdly; because their proceeding against him was malicious.
               Whence I may reade this lesson to your Lawyers, your Registers,
  and your Scriueners, That one Tilde, or Tittle, may condemne them of
  falshood. When our Sauiour Christ said of Saint Iohn, Si cum volo manere
  donec veniam, quid hoc ad te?
                  
                     Iohn. 21.
                  If I will that he tarry till I come, (when Peter was so
  inquisitiue of him, what should become of the Disciple whom he loued, and
  leaned in his bosome) what is it to thee? Doe thou follow mee. Then
  went this word streight amongst the brethren, That this Disciple should not
  dye. But the Euangelist did correct this their mistake, For Iesus said not
  to him, He shall not dye; But if I will that he tarry till I come,
                  
                     Iob. 6. Iob. 11▪
                   
                  what is that to
  thee? Iob said, Ye shall not find iniquitie in my tongue. But
  Zophar, one of his friends laid it to his charge; Dixisti enim,
  Purus est sermo m
                        •••
                     , &amp; mundus
  sum in conspectu tuo, For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am cleane
  in thine eyes. And albeit it may seeme, that he charged him herewith vpon
  his owne confession, yet Saint Gregory giues it for a calumnie and
  slander, because Zophar had altered and changed his words. God make vs
  so pure both in Doctrine and life, that when this Temple of our bodies shall
  be destroyed, it may by the mercie of our Sauior Iesus Christ be raised
  againe.
            
         
         
            
            THE XXVII. SERMON, VPON THE TVESDAY AFTER THE FOVRTH SVNDAY IN
LENT.
            
               
                  IOHN 7.14. 
                  
                     Iam die festo mediante, &amp;c.
                   
                  Now when the Feast was halfe done, Iesus went vp into the Temple
  and taught, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               SEuen continued dayes one after another, the Feast of the
Tabernacles was celebrated in the chiefe citie Ierusalem, which was one of the
three principall Passeouers of the Iewes: solemnising the same in remembrance
of that benefit which God did to that People, in leading them fortie yeares
through the Desart,
                  Leuit. 25. not hauing any
house wherein to dwell, and yet not wanting tents or booths wherein to lodge
themselues. To this Feast came all of all sorts, from all parts of the land of
Promise, building themselues Cabbins in the fields. Iosephus saith,
That they vsed Tents, from whence they went to the Temple, and performed their
Offerings for their families, according to their abilitie. Christ came on the
Tuesday to this Solemnitie: of this opinion is Saint Augustine; though
some others are of the mind, that he came thither at the verie beginning of the
Feast, though he did not make himselfe knowne till he saw a more conuenient
time. He preached to the People; and so deepe was his Doctrine, that the Iewes
wondring thereat, said one to another, Quomodo hic literas scit, cum non
ded scerit? How knoweth this man the Scriptures, seeing that he neuer
learned? And howbeit this their voyce of admiration was secret, and
whispered in the eare from one to another, yet Christ made answer thereunto in
publique, shewing therein the pledges and tokens of his Diuinitie; saying
openly vnto them, My Doctrine is not myne, but his that sent me: He
that shall truly endeauour to doe his will, shall know it is his; but hee that
preacheth his owne proper doctrine, seeks after his owne honour and
commendation; but he that preacheth Gods Doctrine, can neither lie nor offend
therein. The Iewes did lay a double slander vpon him:
            The one, Seducit turbas, He seduceth the People.
            
            The other, Sabbathum non custodit, He keepes not the
Sabboth.
            
            But this his answer giues a blur to them both: Moses
(saith hee) gaue you a Law, and yet none of you keepeth the Law, Why go yee
then about to kill  me? For euer since that hee cured him
that lay so long at the Fish-poole, they sought after his life. In a word, this
muttering and whispering of theirs tended onely to the apprehending of him; but
not any one of them dur
                  ••
               
               
                  •
               y hands vpon him, because his
houre was not yet come, and many of the People beeing woon by his miracles and
his doctrine, beleeued in him.
            
               Iesus went vp into the Temple, and taught, &amp;c. One of
the greatest benefits which the world receiued by our Sauiours comming, was,
That hee reading in Heauens Chaire, to so wise and discreet a companie, who by
onely reading in the booke of his Essence, were instructed in all kind of
truth; did not for all this disdaine to become a Schoolemaster to little
children here vpon earth, accommodating the profoundnesse of his deep
learning, to our rude and weake capacity; accomplishing that of Saint Iohn,
Erunt omnes docibiles Dei, They shall be all taught of God.
               
                  Ioh. 6.40. And this may be verified of those
Angells and blessed Saints that are in Heauen, and of those faithfull ones that
are vpon earth: for the verie selfe same truths he taught them in the Temple of
his glorie, which he did these other in his Church; only differenced in this,
That they see them, and we beleeue them. Many Doctors haue sate and read in
their Chaire here vpon earth, but because they dranke not of the water of his
Doctrine in this Schoole, but in the du
                  •
               tie puddles of lies and falshoods,
                  Iob
  13. they were, as Iob saith, The farmers of lies, and the
followers of peruerse opinions. And as there are Artisans for Idols, which
carue them, guild them, and adore them; so are there Artisans of lies and false
opinions, which frame them, set them forth with painted eloquence, and adore
them, as if they should guide them to the end of their happinesse.
            
               He taught. The Euangelist doth not here set downe the
Theame of his Sermon:
                  Wisd. cap. 8. but in
the Chapter of Wisedome Salomon saith, Shee teacheth sobernesse
and prudence, righteousnes &amp; strength, which are the most profitable things
that men can haue in this life.
               Christs doctrine
  pleasing and profitable Two things the Scripture doth euery foot repeat
of this celestiall Doctor:
            The one, The profitablenesse of his Doctrine, Ego Dominus
doce
                     •
                  s vtilia, so saith
Esay, I am the Lord thy God, which teach thee to profit, and lead thee by
the way that thou shouldst goe.
               
                  Esay 48.17.
  Iob. 8. And Saint Iohn saith, Verba quae loquor,
spiritus &amp; vita sunt, The words which I speake are spirit and
life.
            
            The other, The elegancie and sweetnesse of his deliuerie,
Diffusa est gratia in labijs tuis; such heauenly dew did drop from his
lips, and diffuse it selfe in that aboundant and plentifull manner. Which
graces of his poured forth thus gracefully,
                  Cant.
  5.13. the Spouse toucheth vpon in the Canticles, His lips are like
Lillies dropping downe pure myrrhe. In the Lillies is painted forth our
Sauiours beautie; in the Myrrhe, the profit we reap from him, which is very
great; Myrrhe being a principall preseruatiue against corruption.
            
               Mirabuntur omnes.
               
                  Wisedome despised of none but
 fooles.
                  They all meruailed, &amp;c. S. Chrysostome and
  Saint Cyril are of the mind, That this admiration was amongst those
  that were the most incredulous of all that companie. It is an ordinarie thing
  in your hearers, when they heare a famous Preacher, to admire him,
  acknowledging his Doctrine to bee so deepe, that it exceedeth mans capacitie:
  for Wisedome is so superexcellent and so diuine a thing, that in whomsoeuer it
  is found, it causeth great admiration; Things high and eminent shall not be
  so much as mentioned in comparison of her,
                  
                     Iob
 28. Prou. 3. so saith Iob. And Salomon, It is to
  be preferred before all riches. Euerie man doth prise and esteeme it saue
  the Foole: he that is most wise, doth most honour the Wise; but hee that 
   is a Foole, makes little reckoning of those that are
  wise. Fooles hate knowledge.
                     Prou. 1.
                  Homer stiles wise Apollo, a god multarum manuum, of many
  hands, because he hath a hand in euerie thing; a hand for to lighten the
  blind vnderstanding, a hand for to guide the soule in the way of vertue; a hand
  for to gouerne the Commonwealth, and to appease the tumults and rebellions
  rising therein; a hand to conserue the same in peace. In a word, as
  Apollo, who is the Sunne, by expatiating and spreading abroad his
  beames through diuers parts both of sea &amp; land, giues a beeing and a life
  to all things; to mettalls in the veines of the earth, to pearles in the shels
  of the sea, to trees, plants, birds, beasts, men, &amp;c. so a wiseman is
  Vita generalis reipublicae, The generall life and liuelihood of a
  Commonwealth. Themistius calls him Deum, a God. Horace, Rex Regum, a
  King of Kings, &amp;c. And if any man shall say with Saint Paul,
  Scientia inflat,
                  1. Cor. 8. 
                  That
  Knowledge and Wisedome puffeth vp, and affoords matter vnto man of pride and
  arrogancie; Clemens Alexandrinus answers thereunto, That the word
  Inflat doth likewise inforce, that it doth breath and inspire into vs
  noble and generous thoughts. Filijs suis vitam inspirat, saith
  Ecclesiasticus: The Greeke Text renders it, Exaltat,
  Euebit.
                  
                     Eccl. 4. Wisedome exalteth her
  children, it giues them a new kind of Beeing, new hearts, new resolutions, to
  vndergoe glorious enterprises: In a word, Qui illam diligit, diligit
  vitam, He that loues her, loues his l
                        •
                     fe. So that if it be an occasion of arrogancie, it is not so
  in it selfe, but by accident, when it lights on an insolent brest, which
  conuerts good into euill. Your Kings and Princes haue in all ages honoured
  wise men with great titles &amp; preferments; and not only your wise &amp;
  prudent Princes, but those of meaner parts and abilities, and euen your worser
  sort of Kings. Dionisius the Tyrant sent to Plato (that he
  might come to see him) one of his fairest Gallies, with store of daintie
  prouision, and well accompanied; and at the Hauen where he was to land, had
  prouided a Coach with foure horses to be readie to receiue him, that he might
  come in the greater pompe to his Pallace: and all this honour he was willing to
  doe him, for that he was a wise man. And if such men as he should cause such
  admiration in the world, What admiration must he raise in mens minds, in whom
  all the treasures of Gods wisedome were deposited? Whence we may consider,
  that if a few drops of that soueraigne fountaine did strike the People into
  such admiration; when in Heauen we shall see the fulnesse of that riuer, or
  rather immensitie of that great sea, What admiration must it needs mooue? Yet
  notwithstanding Saint Augustine saith, Mirabantur omnes, sed non
  omnes conuertebantur, They were wonder-strucken, but not spirit-strucken;
  many did admire, but few were conuerted. The like successe for the most part
  haue the Sermons of your famous Preachers: Ezechiel reporteth, That it
  fell out so with himselfe; That morning (saith he) that he was to preach, the
  citisens would call to one another saying, Let vs goe and heare the Prophet,
  let vs see what new thing will now come from him: they enter in thronging, sit
  them downe, beare themselues verie grauely, and hearken diligently to my words,
  but are farre off from putting them in execution, being onely vnto them like a
  smooth verse, or a musicall Song, with a sweet and pleasing eire; nor was there
  any, of that harsh eare, who wil not one while commend the voice, another while
  the tone; this man, the dittie; that, it's ayre; but goe not a step further,
  setting vp their rest there. Musicke passes along by the doore at mid-night, it
  wakens thee, thou 
                     •
                  isest out of
  thy bed, thou gettest to the window, thou hearest it, thou takest delight in
  it; but when it is gone out of thy hearing, thou returnest backe againe to bed,
  layest thee downe, and fall'st againe asleepe, as if thou hadst heard no such
  thing at all. Leuani oculos meos (saith Zachary) I turned
  me,
                  
                     Zachar. 5. 
                  and lifted vp mine 
   eyes, and looked; and behold a flying booke. Then said
  he vnto me: This is the curse that goeth forth ouer the whole earth.

                  nt Gregorie saith, That
  this booke is the sacred Scripture, wherein (as Lyra notes it) are
  written the curses and chastisements against the
  
                     •
                  infull men of this world. A
  flying booke. When there doth appeare in the ayre any new strange sight,
  the Vulgar, he wonders at it; the wise man, he is afraid of it; because it is a
  vsuall prognostication of miseries and disasters. As those fearefull fightings
  that were seene in the ayre in the time of the Maccabees, your
  Comets, your Crucifixes of fire, and your showers of blood. The like effect
  doth Gods word worke, Some stand wondring at it, and some grow sad vpon it. The
  Seuentie translates it: Vidi falcem volantem, I sawe a flying sickle;
  Which (as Pierius noteth) signifieth the time of Haruest. Mitte
  jam falces, qu
                        ••
                     iam maturae sunt
  messes, Thrust in your sickles, for the haruest is ripe. In token, that
  when the word of God, and the malediction in holy Scripture comes to be little
  or nothing at all regarded, and when the earth in stead of corne, brings forth
  nothing but thistles and thornes,
                     Iames 1. it
  is high time to cut it downe. Saint Iames compares the word of the
  Lord to a looking-glasse. And Saint Bernard calls it the
  Looking-glasse of Truth, which nor flatters, nor deceiueth any man: But hee
  that shall looke therein, shall finde himselfe to be the same he seemes. Saint
  A
                        •
                     
                     gustine hath in a
  manner the very same. In a looking glasse, one beholds the gray hayres on his
  head, and the wrinckles that are in his face, and when he hath turned his eye
  off from thence, the figure thereof is blotted out of his remembrance.
  Another, he lookes (especially if he haue not seene himselfe a long time in a
  glasse) and wonders at himselfe, he knits the browes and cryes out, I am growne
  old and weake, and drawing neere to my graue, Quod senescit, propè
  interitum est; He that is old, hath one foote in the graue. And therefore
  he had need make good prouision, being so soone to goe his iourney. But he
  that shall set before him (as a glasse) the Law of perfect libertie, as
  one, who with a great deale of heede viewes a deepe pit, or some remote place,
  This man shall be happie in so doing.
               
               How knoweth this man the Scriptures, seeing that he neuer
  learned?
               
                  Learning is not gotten without labo
                        •
                     
                  The admiration of the people was
  increased, by their considering with themselues, That our Sauiour Christ had
  neuer beene brought vp in any Vniuersitie, nor had crackt so much as an
  argument in the Schooles, especially in matter of learning. And as it is in the
  Prouerb, Nunca mucho, costo poco, Much is neuer got with a
  little;
                  
                     Eccl. 1. That is to say, Qui
  addit scientiam, addit laborem, All things are full of labour. In the
  multitude of wisedome, is much griefe; and he that increaseth knowledge,
  increaseth sorrow. That is; it cannot bee come by without great paine of body
  and minde. Or, as Aquila translates it; Addit tormentum. Holy
  Iob askes the question, Vbi inuenitur sapientia? Where is wisedome
  to be found? And the first conclusion is, Non inuenitur in terra
  suauiter viuentium, It is neuer to be found amongst those that are enemies to
  labour. Salomon saith in his Prouerbs, That it must be got as we get
  treasure, digge and delue for it. There was neuer in this world any famous man
  in learning,
                     Prou. 2. who had not studyed
  very hard, and taken a great deale of paines. Vt thesaurus, effoderis

  together, and follow his study. All your great Philosophers did breake their
  braines, and dyed in trauelling after the search of knowledge. The solitudes of
  a Saint Ierome, the caues of other Saints and Doctors make this truth
  cleere. Antiquitie celebrating Saturne for an inuenter of 
   learning, put in his hands (as Tertullia

  the beating of our braines. Of the Lacedemonians Valerius reporteth,
  That they had a Statue of Apollo that had foure eares, and foure
  hands; signifying thereby, That wisedome is got by much hearing, and much
  labour. They looking therefore on the learning of our Sauior Iesus Christ, so
  diuine on the one side, and so without any labour or paines on the other, it
  was not much, that they should thus admire him.
               Againe: A strange effect, when the cause is secret and hid, it
  euermore causeth admiration. If the Sunne should shew his face on the
  sudden,Admiration vsually the child of ignorance.
  and his beames breake out in the midst of a darke night, it would cause great
  feare. The Sunne doth still inioy an equall light, though to the ignorant it
  seeme, that it shines brightest at mid-day. The light and splendour of Iesus
  Christ our Lord and Sauiour that Sun of righteousnesse, was alwayes one and
  the same; but because hee was a free Sunne, and not tyde, as that other, to a
  set course, discouering his beames when he thought best, with a Lux in
  tenebris lucet, he strooke all the standers by with amazement and
  confusion, wondring who this should be, and saying one to another; V

  How knowes this man the Scriptures, seeing he neuer learned?
               
               And this admiration is the more augmented by that which the
  glorious Euangelists Saint Mathew and Saint Marke mention,
  Scandalizabantur in 
                        •
                     o, They
  were offended thereat. Their indignation being greater than their
  admiration, enuie working more vpon them, than the grace that was offered
  them; remaining onely thereat astonished, as men that are surprized with some
  sodaine or vnexpected accident: Suting well with that which Saint
  Chrysostome and Saint Cyril sayes of them; to wit,
                     Mat.
 13. Mark 9▪
                   That these were those incredulous and
  vnbeleeuing people. Whence hath he all these things? Is he not the Sonne of
  a Carpenter? and is not his mother called Mary, &amp;c. Whence it
  followeth in all probabilitie, that they had ript vp his course of life, and
  made a strict examination of him from his childhood, his youth, and better
  growne yeares; concluding all of them in the end, That he had spent his time in
  helping Ioseph in his trade,2. Tem. 2.
 Deut. 29. and not in applying himselfe to learning; stiling
  Learning the wisedome of diuine mysteries. The holy Apostle Saint Paul
  saith to his Disciple Timothie, Quia ab infantia sacras literas
  nosti. And in the 29. chapter of Deut. it appeareth, That amongst
  the Hebrewes, there were some that profest the teaching of this kind of
  learning, which was the Grammaticall and Historicall sence of the sacred
  bookes, which did dispose them to other things of greater moment, and to
  mysteries of a higher and deeper nature. Epiphanius saith, That they
  were expounders of the Grammar, and were therefore called Grammatis S
                        •
                     ribae. Being therefore grounded
  and confirmed in this their opinion, That he had not learned their first
  rudiments and principles; they said, (wondring with themselues) Vnde hic
  literas scit? Whence hath this man his learning?
               
               But all this made the worse for them, and their proceeding
  appeares still fouler and fouler.
               First of all in this: O ye Iewes (saith Chrysologus) ye
  doe not wonder, that a Virgin sho
                     •
                  ld bring forth, that God apparelled in humane flesh, should treat
  and conuerse with you, (as it is prophesied by Bar
                        •
                     ch) nor, that the blind should 
   see, the deafe heare, the dumbe speake, the lame walke,
  the dead rise, the Diuels tremble: And do you wonder that he should shew
  himselfe thus learned, hauing not learned? you admire that which ought least to
  be wondred at, &amp; are vndmindfull of that which ought most to be meruailed
  at.
               Secondly, It was a foule fault in them, to see such singular
  learning, accompanied with so vnblameable a life; and such strange miracles,
  and that they should not once thinke that this was from Heauen. Especially they
  knowing, that Adam, and Salomon, did enioy this blessing. Of
  Salomons wisedome, and whence he had it,3
 Reg. 5. 2. Chron. 2. the Historie of the
  Kings, and that of the Chronicles, deliuereth the same vnto
  vs: and of Adam the Schoolemen do affirme, That he could hardly haue
  giuen all things their proper names, (as Saint Chrysostome hath
  obserued it) if God had not infused that knowledge into him, to call them after
  that fitting and conuenient manner. And this knowledge was communicated to
  Christ euen from the verie instant of his conception; by meanes whereof hee saw
  all things in their proper species, besides that blessed knowledge
  whereby he saw them in God, as in a glasse.
                     Iohn
 3.34. Of this infused knowledge Saint Iohn saith, God gaue
  not the spirit by measure vnto him; but it was without limitation: for hee
  that is sonne and heire to his father, is not to be stinted as those that are
  seruants. And therefore it is said, The Spirit of the Lord shall rest vpon
  him; the spirit of wisedome and vnderstanding, the spirit of councell and
  might, the spirit of knowledge, &amp;c. This infused knowledge was setled in
  others by fits, not in all times &amp; all places, nor so generally in all
  things, as in our Sauiour Christ, from whom it sprouted as water from a
  Fountaine. That fountaine of the Rocke, strucke by the Rod of Moses,
  it had beene a foule sinne in the Israelites to haue searched into the veins of
  Nature, whence these waters gushed out, and not to thinke on Gods grace, from
  whence this fauour flowed: And no lesse absurde was it in the Iewes, to seeke
  in the Schooles and Vniuersities, after those veines of liuing water, of that
  diuine learning of our Sauiour Christ, which was that true rocke; and not to
  direct their eyes towards God, who is the true giuer of knowledge.
               Lastly, It was a foule fault in them, to thinke that God is tied
  to humane meanes,1. Reg.
                     
                        •
                     . knowing quod Deus
  scientiarum Dominus est, That God is the Lord of sciences, and that it was
  the Holy-Ghost that taught and instruucted those the Prophets, taking one from
  following the heards of Kyne &amp; Oxen▪ and another from keeping of
  Sheepe.
                     Amos 1. 
                  Non sum Phopheta,
  (saith Amos of himselfe) I am not a Prophet, nor the sonne of a
  Prophet, but a Heardsman of Tekoah. And of Dauid it is said, That
  he tooke him from the Sheepefold, following the Ewes with young. He indewed
  Daniel being a child, with wisedome: and Ioseph with
  vnderstanding to declare King Pharaohs dreame. Nor was it needfull for
  him to draw these men out of the Schooles of Athens, nor to take them from
  forth the Vniuersities of Greece, &amp;c. As soone as euer our Lord God had
  discouered to the glorious Apostle Saint Paul the beames of his light,
  he presently departed to Arabia and to Damascus to preach the Gospell: hee
  might haue gone first to Hierusalem to take acquaintance of those other
  Apostles of more antient standing, and to conferre with them what he should
  preach: but this did not seeme vnto him a conuenient meanes to credit his
  Doctrine. Nec veni Hierosolimam ad Antecessores meos; to the end that
  the Gentiles might not presume, that this his Doctrine was of the earth,
                     Gal. 1. and not of Heauen, as afterwards he told
  the Galathians; The Gospell which was preached by me, is not afterman, neither
  did I receiue it of man, neither was I taught it but by the reuelation of Iesus
  Christ. And the Ephesians, What I receiued from the Lord, I deliuered vnto
  you. But because the Iews did  surpasse all the
  world in passion and malice, they did attribute all to the Deuill, whom the
  Gentiles had made their god.
               
                  My Doctrine is not myne, &amp;c. The Commentators make
  three expositions vpon this place, My Doctrine is not myne, but I haue
  receiued it from my father. The Doctrine of the Father and of the Sonne,
  as he is God, is one and the same, as is their essence; nor is there any other
  difference more, than that he hath receiued it from the Father: but as he is
  man, it is in it selfe diuers, as is their nature; because it is an accident
  and an infused habit, though the truth thereof in both, is one and the same.
  Saint Ambrose and Saint Augustine expound this saying of our
  Sauior, as he is man; and that this Doctrine of his, was not his, but of his
  father that sent him abroad to preach and publish it to the World. And the
  same Saint Augustine in some other places deliuereth it of Christ, as
  he was God; but affirmeth in the end, That it may be interpreted either way.
  Saint Cyril &amp; Saint Chrysostome declare this of Christ,
  as he is God: but which way soeuer you take, either sence doth signifie, That
  Christ is the Sonne of God.
               The second Exposition is, My Doctrine is not myne, that is, It
  is not onely myne, but his that sent me. And this sence and meaning is
  founded vpon many places of Scripture; wherein this Negatiue Non, is
  the same with Non solum, Not onely. As for example, It is not yee
  that speake,
                  
                     Mat. 10.20. 
                  but the
  spirit of the father which speaketh in you, (i.) Not you alone, but the
  spirit of the Father. Againe,
                     Iohn 5.45.
                  Doe not thinke that I alone will accuse you to the Father, there is another
  also that accuseth you, euen Moses, in whom yee trust, because yee beleeue not
  that which he wrote of mee: that is, Hee doth not only beleeue in me.
  Thirdly, He that beleeueth in me, doth not beleeue in me,
                  
                     Iohn. 12. Marc 9.37. 1. Cor.
 15.10. 
                  but in him that sent me. In the fourth place,
  Whosoeuer shall receiue me, receiueth not me, but him that sent me;
  That is, Not onely me. Lastly, I laboured more aboundantly than them all,
  yet not I, but the grace of Godwhich was with me.
               
               The third, It is not myne, nor did I inuent it, nor is it the
  Doctrine of men, but of God. Many Philosophers haue out of an ouerweening
  conceit, gon a wandring, and inuented new sects and strange Doctrines, that
  they might haue the honour to be accounted authours of nouelties; answerable to
  that which God said of certaine false Prophets, They speake a vision of
  their owne heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord: Woe vnto the foolish
  Prophets, that follow their own spirit,
                  
                     Ier.
 23.15. Ezech. 13.3. 
                  and haue seene nothing. And it is
  Antichrist that shall be called, Pater errorum, The father of
  errors.
               
               Our Sauiour Christ teacheth vs here two things:
               The one, That God is the Fountaine of Wisedome; and that as the
  Earth cannot yeeld it's fruit without water from Heauen, so the heart of man
  cannot affoord any fruit without the Doctrine of God. Concrescat vt plunia
  doctrina mea, fl
                        •
                     at vt ros eloquium
  meum. The Husband in the Canticles was willing to insinuate as
  much, when he compared the brests of his Spouse to two little Kids,
                     Cant. 4. 
                  Duo vbera tua sicut duo hinnuli
  Caprae, Thy two brests are like two young Kids that are twins, which feed among
  the Lillies, pouring forth in due season their milke vnto vs in a plentifull
  manner. Some Commentators vnderstand by these two brests, the two
  Testaments, which like two brests spring aboundantly, communicating vnto vs
  the milke of their Doctrine.
               The other, That euerie one ought to acknowledge and confesse,
  That whatsoeuer good he enioyeth, is of God▪ 
                  The Riuers returne
  againe vnto the place from whence they come. The riuers of our good doe
  flow from that immense Sea, by loue, and are to returne by thankes; Vt
  iterum fluant, That they may flow againe, and neuer grow drie. And this
  may prooue as a generall rule, and approoued  truth, in
  all those blessings that befall vs. But more particularly ought we to
  acknowledge the same, that are Preachers of Gods word; for he that praiseth
  himselfe, and priseth his owne worth, (this is my opinion) cannot hope for any
  fruit of his labours;1. Co
                           •
                        .

                     .7. 
                  Neither is he that planteth, any thing; neither hee
  that watreth; but God, that giueth the increase. That Gardner is a foole
  or a mad man, that doth attribute to his dib, to the water of his Well, to the
  labour of his hands, and the sweat of his browes, the floures and fruits of his
  garden; it is not thou, nor thy paines, but Heauen that giues thee all that
  thou hast. What hast thou that thou didst not receiue?
                  1. Cor. 4.7. 1. Cor. 8.2. And in the
  eighth Chapter he saith, Qui puta
                        •
                      se aliquid scire, nond
                        •
                     m cognouit quemadmodum oporteat scire, If any man thinke that he
  knoweth any thing, he knoweth no
                        •
                     hing yet as hee ought to know. Aristotle first putteth downe
  Mod
                        •
                     m, and then
  Scientiam; the meanes first, and the knowledge afterwards. And the
  Apostle saith, That he that presumes that he knows, is not yet come to the
  means of knowing; Thinking themselues wise, they are become fooles.
  The wisest men haue euermore beene the meekest and the humblest; in Saint
  Augustine, humilitie and wisedome suted so well together, that no man
  was able to iudge which was the greater. Salomon said of himselfe,
  Surely I am more brutish than any man, and haue not the vnderstanding of a
  man:
                  
                     Prou.
                     
                        •
                     0.2. and the reason of this
  acknowledgment is, for that if a man looke well into himselfe, the wisest that
  is will hold himselfe a foole. We are not sufficient of our selues to
  thinke so m
                        •
                     ch as a good
  thought; but if a man looke once into God, he will acknowledge all to be
  from God. Saint Augustine com

                  ares him that preacheth, to the Sowers seed-leape; and as the

                  d vp
  in the barne; no more hath the Preacher for carrying Gods Word in his mouth.
  Quis credet (saith Esay) auditui nostro? Saint
  Chrysostome saith, That he confessed, that what he preached was not of
  himselfe, but of God; Oliuam vberem, pul
                        •
                     hram, speciosam, fructiferam, vocauit Dominus nomen tuum, ad vocem
  loquelae grandis exarsit ignis in ea, &amp; combusta sunt fruteta eius.
  Saint Gregorie saith, That this fat, faire, &amp; fruitfull Oliue, is
  a faire &amp; fruitfull Preacher; fruitfull, for the fruit of his works; and
  faire, for the elegancie &amp; force of his words; but feeble &amp; weake in
  regard of his flatteries, which are that great voycewhich setteth on fire,
  burneth, and destroyeth the fruit. We will magnifie and ex
                        •
                     oll our owne tongues.
                  A Preacher should neuer boast of his parts. There are some
  kind of Preachers who thanke their tongue for their preferment; God-a-mercie
  tongue, it is that that hath got me this my honour; it is that that hath
  raised me to such high place; nor am I to serue or magnifie any other Lord or
  Master, than this. Nolite loqui sublimia gloriantes. Saint
  Chrysostome saith, That Vaine-glorie is that moath that fretteth and
  consumeth the sublimest and highest things: And therefore, Nolite loqui
  sublimia gloriantes. Saint Augustine saith, That he that
  preacheth in a high straine, and flies through the thickest clouds, and highest
  mysteries of Diuinitie, had need of the jesses of Humilitie, lest through
  vaine-glorie soaring too high, he scortch his wings, and like Phaeton
  come tumbling downe. The eyes of the Spouse, her Beloued compares to the eyes
  of a Doue: For amongst all other Birds, the Doue lifts vp her eyes vnto Heauen
  when she feeds,The Doue of all Fowles the most
 thankful as if she did giue God thanks for the good she receiueth: and
  euer since that she returned with a greene Oliue branch in her mouth, to
  Noahs Arke, she hath been taken for a thankefull Bird; as on the
  contrarie, the Crow is held to be an vnthankefull Carrion. Of this
  thankefulnesse or grateful acknowledgement, there are many symboles or emblems
  in humane Authors; as in the Sunne-Dyall, with all the houres specified therein
  by distinct figures, with a hand poynting out this Letter vnto vs, In vmbra
  desino; that is  to say, To the Sunne doe I owe my
  motion and beeing. As likewise in the Shell full of pearle, lying open to the
  Sunne and the dew of Heauen, with this word or motto, Rore Diuino,
  that is, By the helpe and fauour of the Sunne of Righteousnesse; for without
  this diuine dew, there is no vertue in our selues. As also that of the Oliue
  amidst the craggie cliffes, without rooting or moysture, with this wreath
  comming out of it, A Coelo, My happinesse is from Heauen.
  Seneca saith, That he that acknowledgeth a debt by words, which he
  cannot satisfie by deeds, hath paid what he owes: And Cicero renders
  the reason thereof, It is not all one (saith hee) to pay the debt of a benefit
  receiued, as that of money; for this is not paid till the money be restored:
  but hee that doth acknowledge a benefit, and confesseth a kindnesse, being not
  otherwise able to make satisfaction, hath alreadie made repayment. Of this kind
  are the fauours conferred by Kings, which we can no otherwise requite, than by
  our seruing &amp; magnifying of them. And therefore much more those that come
  from God, from whose free hand we receiue whatsoeuer good we enioy; nor are we
  able to repay it in the same money, but by our seruing him, and magnifying his
  holy Name: According to that of Dauid, Sacrificium laudis, &amp;c. I will
  offer to thee the sacrifice of thankesgi
                        •
                     ing, and will call vpon the name of the Lord; and will pay my vowes
  vnto him in the presence of all his People; in the Courts of the Lords House,
  and in the midst of thee, ô Ierusalem, will I praise the Lord.
               
               
                  If any man shall doe his will, he shall know of the
  Doctrine, &amp;c. Your damnable Will is the occasion of your miserable
  blindnesse; if yee would but doe the will of my Father, you would then know
  that my Doctrine is his. In humane speculatiue sciences, the Vnderstanding
  goes before the Will; but in that knowledge which the Diuines call Mysticall,
  which is the wisedome of Heauen, the Will is first: And therefore Saint
  Augustine saith, That the knowing of a Doctrine, is the reward as it
  were of beleeuing it; Vnderstanding is the reward of Faith, if thou
  vnderstandest not, beleeue. And Esay, Vnlesse yee beleeue, yee shall
  not vnderstand. It is the priuiledge of the deepest mysteries of our
  Faith, to beleeue them before we know them: He that loueth truth
  (saith Saint Iohn) commeth to the light. Our Sauiour Christ
  did not so much endeauour to haue vs to vnderstand, as to beleeue.
                     Iohn. 3. 
                  This is the worke of God, that yee
  beleeue on him whom he hath sent.
                  
                     Iohn.
 6. In Heauen our happinesse consists in seeing; but on earth, in
  beleeuing. Tast and see how gratious the Lord is, Earthly food is
  first seene; after the sight, followes the taste: The woman saw that the
  fruit was pleasant to the eye; whereupon she tooke of the Fruit, and did
  eat. Here the sight did precede the taste, but in Heauen we first taste, and
  afterwards see; there the taste precedes the sight: and in my opinion, Saint
  Chrysostome and Saint Cyril doe not differ much from this
  sence, being that they make bonam voluntatem, dispositionem
  intellectus, the goodnesse of the Will, to bee the disposition to the
  vnderstanding: but a depraued Will is like vnto an infirm eye, which through
  it's indisposition doth not see the light. The places of Scripture which
  confirme this Doctrine, are without number. Ecclesiasticus saith, More
  truths will one holy soule sometimes declare, than many vnholy Doctours and
  Phylosophers, which wander out of the way, and weare out their eye-brows in
  search thereof. Intellectus onus omnibus facientibus eum, Vnderstanding is
  a burthen to all that d
                        •
                     e it.
  Gregorie Nazianzen hath noted, That the Prophet did not say,Gods word the truest wisedome. 
                  Praedicantibus eum, To
  them that preach it; but Facientibus, To them that doe it: I
  vnderstood thy commandement, and therefore hated the way of Iniquitie.
  The second part is a cause of the first; because I did abhorre all the wayes of
  wickednesse, I attained to so much knowledge of thy Law: I am wiser than
  the Aged,
                  
                     Psal. 119. 
                  because 
   I haue sought thy Commandements. Salomon saith,
  My sonne seeke after wisedome, obserue righteousnesse, and the Lord will
  shew it vnto thee. Iob. Behold, the feare of the Lord is
  wisedome,
                  
                     Hos
                           •
                        a 10. 
                  and to turne backe from euill is
  vnderstanding. Osee. Sow to your selues in righteousnesse,
  &amp;c. according to the translation of the Seuentie. Saint Iohn
  saith,
                     Iohn 8. 
                  If yee shall abide in my
  Word, yee shall know my will. Esay. To whome shall God teach his
  wisedome? To whom shall his Doctrine be reuealed? Shall it happily bee to those
  that are weaned from his milke? To those that haue Aloes on their nipples?
  or to those that when the Prophet shall command them something on his part,
  shal answer, Manda, remanda, expecta, re-expecta; What doth the
  Preacher meane to grind vs in this manner, and to repeat so often vnto vs,
  Haec mandat Dominus? &amp;c. All these places prooue that conclusion
  of the first chapter of Wisedome, In maleuolam anim
                        •
                     m, non introiuit sapientia. Saint
  Augustine saith, That the two sisters Leah and
  Rachael, represented this order. First, fruitfull Leah was
  married, representing the fruit of good workes; next, beautifull
  Rachael, representing the fairenesse of wisedome and knowledge. In
  the right erudition of man, the labour of operating those things that are
  right, are preferred before the will of vnderstanding those that are true.
  And Saint Bernard persuading a friend of his to this truth, speaketh
  thus vnto him, Experto crede citiùs illum sequendo, quàm
  legendo consequipossis, &amp; aliquia magis inuenies in syluis, quam in libris;
  Beleeue me who am experienced herein, that thou shalt sooner come vnto him by
  following, than by reading him; and shalt meet with something more amidst the
  Woods, than thy bookes. The shadie trees, and the solitarie Rockes will
  throughly instruct thee in that, which many learned tutors are not able to
  teach thee.
               
                  Then sayd some of them of Hierusalem, Is not this hee whom
  they goe about to kill? And behold, he speaketh openly, &amp;c. This place
  expresseth the Empire, the securitie, and libertie of Gods word. And this is
  specified in that commission which God gaue vnto Ieremie,
                  
                     Ierem 1.10. when hee nominated him to bee his
  Preacher, Behold, I haue set thee ouer the nations, and ouer the kingdomes,
  to pluck vp, and to root out, and to d
                        •
                     stroy, and throw downe, to build, and to plant. This generall
  power was graunted vnto him, with a non obstante, no man could put him
  by it. Notable to this purpose, is that Historie of Moses with
  Pharaoh; On the one side, wee are to consider the great interest
  wherewith he went vnto the King, about the libertie of the Hebrew people, being
  so much inslaued, inthralled, and so sorely taxed beyond all right and reason:
  On the other side, so many scourges, so many plagues, so much feare, and so
  much death; and yet notwithstanding hee durst not cause him to be apprehended,
  nor to be put to death, nor had not the power to touch vpon that thought. And
  questionlesse the reason thereof was, that he acknowledged a superior power
  proceeding from Gods Word, which Moses did euer and anon repeat vnto
  him,
                     Cant. 1.8. 
                  Haec dicit Dominus, Thus
  sayth the Lord: I haue compared thee ô my Loue, to the troupes of horses
  in the Chariots of Pharaoh. Rupertus saith, That all Gods Cauallerie
  against the power of Pharaoh, was onely Moses Rod; this made
  that great King turne coward; this strucke a terrour into him, made his heart
  to tremble within him, and maugre his greatnesse to acknowledge God. The
  Beloued sayes then to his loue, As that Rod was Gods Armie, wherewith like a
  Potters Vessell, he brake that King and all his Host in pieces; so thy Armie,
  ô my Church, shall be my Word, which shall be as it were another
  Moses Rod, against those that shall withstand it. Virgam
  vigilantem ego video, I see a waking Rod, saith Ieremie: And God
  answers thereunto, Benè vidisti, quia ego vigilabo super verbum
  meum, Thou hast well seene, for I will watch ouer my Word. Saint
  Paul puts it to the question, What will yee? Shall I come vnto you
  with a rod, or in loue, and  in the spirit of
  meekenesse? And no lesse worthie the obseruation is that History of
  Amos, There was a false Prophet called Amaziah, an Idoll
  Priest, whom Ier
                        •
                     boam had
  placed in Bethell, who could by no meanes indure Amos;
                     Amos. 7. whether it were because he swayed much
  among the people, or for that by his Sermons (as Saint Hierome hath
  noted it) he had withdrawne the People from those sacrifices wherein
  Amaziah was interessed; he laboured with him, both by cruell
  threatnings and gentle persuasions, that he would get him gone into the Land
  of Iudah, Get thee into the land of Iudah, and there eat thy bread, and
  prophecie there. But when he was most threatned, then did he preach most
  against Ieroboam, not sticking to say, Ieroboam shall die by the
  sword; his wife shall be a Harlot in the Citie, and thy sonnes and thy
  daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy hand shall bee deuided by line, and
  thou shalt die in a polluted land, &amp;c. For the Word of God, the more it is
  threatned, the freer it is; and like the Cammomile, Dum premitur, surgit
  vberior, The more you seeke to suppresse it, the more it shewes it selfe.
  Certain Pharisees aduising our Sauior Christ, to get him gone out of
  Herods Dominions, and to flie the Kingdom; returned them this answer,
  Tell King Herod, for all this his heat and spleene against me, that I
  will cure the sicke, and cast out deuils, to day and to morrow, Et tertia
  die consumer. Signifying thereby, that hee would liue for all him, as long
  as he listed, &amp; dye when he listed. S. Ambrose when the emperor
  Theodosius was so mightily incensed against him for his boldnes in
  preaching, said vnto him, May it please your Imperiall Maiestie, it becomes
  not an Emperour, nor is it in his power to impose silence vpon the Preacher of
  Gods word: Nor does it befit a Preacher to hold his peace where there is iust
  reason to reprehend. The one is an affront offered vnto God, whose Legat hee is
  that preacheth; the other, cowardise in Gods Minister, who carrying with him
  the warrant of Gods word, ought not to be afraid of any thing. Many doe excuse
  themselues of vsing reprehensions, for that they suppose they will be Sin
  prouecho, without profit, and worke little good vpon their Auditorie. And
  yet our Sauiour Christ did seuerly reprooue the Pharisees, though they were
  neuer awhit the better for it, that others might reape fruit thereby, and be
  admonished by other mens harmes.
               
                  Iudgen 
                        •
                     t
  according to the appearance, but judge righteous iudgement. Our Sauiour
  Christ said formerly vnto the Pharisees, Why doe yee seeke to kill
  mee? For euer since the time of the forementioned Miracle, they sought to
  slay him, the common people charging him with a Daemonium habes,
  &amp;c. But Christ making no replie to the vulgar, passing that ouer,
  went about to prooue the small reason that they had to plot his death, because
  he had done this good deed vpon the Sabboth day, Vnum opus feci, &amp;
  omnes admiramini. Saint Chrisostome expoundeth this
  admiramini, to be a condemning of him to bee a transgressour of the
  Law. On the Sabboth (saith our Sauior) yee Circumcise; and
  Circumcision is no breach of the Sabboth, much lesse the healing of him that is
  lame. Circumcision healeth the soule, but woundeth the bodie: But I in lesse
  time cure both body and soule. Circumcision is of the antient Fathers, the
  Sabboth of Moses: you suffer the Circumcision, and so did
  Moses. If of this worke there followeth no transgression, neither
  ought there of mine. The Iewes hereunto might answer, Circumcision is of the
  antient Fathers, and confirmed by Moses; but thy worke is of a base,
  vulgar, and ordinarie person. Whereunto our Sauiour answereth, Nolite
  iudicare secundum, &amp;c. Iudgement ought to be made onely of mens
  actions, without acception of persons. Ye magnifie Moses (as Saint
  Austen saith) and Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob; and yee
  despise mee, my workes beeing more strange  and
  wonderfull: Without doubt ye are accepters of persons. The Pharisees might
  replie, Circumcision is a diuine precept, but thy worke is not so. This
  argument is of no force; for the obseruation of the Sabboth, was likewise a
  diuine precept; but because that of the Circumcision was the more antient of
  the two, they did prefer this before that: And therefore Christs worke, being
  greater than the Circumcision, wee are to suppose that it was diuine, and by
  consequence to be preferred before it. To conclude, it seeming to the
  Pharisees an vnworthie thing, that the authoritie of a common man should be
  parallel'd with that of the antient Patriarches, they condemned him for a
  transgressour. Wherupon our Sauiour sayes vnto them, Nolite iudicare
  secundum faciem.
               
               First of all, he here condemneth in Iudges the accepting of
  persons, contrarie to so many places of Scripture, which condemne this
  inequalitie. Ecclesiasticus saith, Fortissimus non habebit in
  illis patientiam. And though God be so merciful a God, &amp; of such
  great sufferance, yet here by an Hyperbole, he will not haue patience with
  those Iudges, which for hatred, loue, or profit, shall bee mooued to pronounce
  an vniust sentence; nor with those princes and potentates of the World, which
  in matters of Iustice, shall carrie an vneuen hand. And hee commandeth those
  Kings that were to raigne ouer his people, that they should beare the booke of
  the Law about them, and should read therein all the dayes of their life,
                     Deut. 17. 
                  That they may learne to feare the
  Lord thir God. For, If the feare of God doth not bridle them, they are
  head-strong and cannot be ruled. Iudges, haue for their bridle, God, and the
  King; Kings, onely God. And against those that shal loose their respect towards
  him, he saith, Heare therefore ô ye Kings, and vnderstand,
                     Wisd. 6. learne ye that be Iudges of the ends of
  the Earth; Giue eare ye that rule the multitudes, and glorie in the multitude
  of people: For the rule is giuen you of the Lord, and power by the most high,
  which will trie your workes, &amp; search out your imaginations. Because that
  ye beeing officers of his Kingdome, haue not iudged aright, nor kept the Law,
  nor walked after the will of God; horribly and suddenly will he appeare vnto
  you; for an hard iudgement shall they haue that beare rule. And the mightie
  shall be mightily tormented. To many great sinners, God giues a long life,
  hauing an eye to the ill that waytes for them; but bad Gouernours and Iudges,
  hee cuts short, and permits them not to liue out their dayes.
                     Deut. 1. And therefore, Nolite iudicare
  secundum faciem, ita parvum a
                        •
                     
                     dietis, vt magnum.
               
               And because, sticking many times vpon Gods recommending vnto
  them the cause of the poore, and the fauour that should bee showen them as well
  in their person, as matter of Iustice; and considering on the other side, their
  miserie and want, some pittifull Iudge, contrary to Iustice, many incline to
  fauour his cause; our Sauiour addeth, Rectum iudicium iudicate, Let
  not your eyes, nor your hearts, be carried away with the miserie of the poore,
  nor the prosperitie of the rich. And as God hath commanded, Regard not the
  Person of the mightie, So likewise he saith, Regard not the Person of
  the Poore, but judge rightly. And this sence is that which is pretended in
  the Text.
               Secondly, he condemneth all kind of rash iudgements, &amp; all
  doubtfull things where there are not manifest proofes, or some
  indicia, or signes of euil, there to leane to the better part. And so
  Thomas teacheth them. To iudge solely vpon suspition, is meer
  rashnesse, which commonly ariseth from these three grounds.
               
                  Rash iudgement altogether to bee
 audedThe one, That the Iudge is vicious himselfe; Stultus, omnes
  stultos aestimat, so sayth Ecclesiasticus: The theife thinkes all
  to be like himselfe, &amp;c.
               The other, proceeds from passion, which commonly iudgeth ill
  vpon light occasions,  of him whom he either hateth or
  enuieth.
               The third, from long experience of things past: And therefore
  Aristotle saith, That old men are verie iealous and suspicious. And
  this is the least blameable; for suspition is apt to entertaine a sinister
  opinion, but experience will goe vpon certainties. There is great difference
  betwixt doubt, suspition, and judgement. There are indicia, or signes,
  that are sufficient for doubting, which are not sufficient for suspecting; and
  for suspecting, which are not sufficient for iudging: and all of them recouer
  more or lesse force from the qualitie of the persons whom they concerne; for
  there are many indicia or tokens which are sufficient to condemne
  vicious and lewd persons, which are not sufficient against persons of honester
  note, and of good report.
               
                  Then they sought to take him, but no man laid hands on
  him. The end of their conference was to apprehend him, but not a man of
  them that durst aduenture to do it; for when as they sought to stone him, their
  stones were frozen to their fingers ends; so now they had the crampe in their
  armes, their hands were benummed, and their strength failed them; discouering
  therein the greatnesse of his power. At his wisedome they remained astonished,
  and at his power they were forced to yeeld. And these are the two attributes of
  a powerfull and absolute Prince: Power without Wisedome, is an vnruly beast,
  that runs on to his owne destruction; and Wisedome without Power, is too weake
  for atchieuement; nor is there that rash action, which a powerfull foole will
  not put himselfe into. Dionysius the Tyrant was woont to say, That
  then he did enioy the sweetnesse of his Empire, when he did execute his desires
  in an instant.Power and Wisedome, are not to be seuered in a
 prince. Power is a headstrong horse▪ and Wisedome serues as a
  bridle to curbe and restraine it's furie. The Wiseman alluded hereunto, when he
  said, That God had giuen him wisedome like the sand that lies on the sea shore,
  which repells the waues, though neuer so great, and bounds them in.
  Plutarch saith, That to a bare absolute power, not bounded in with
  this sand, malice and mischiefe was neuer wanting. The Emperour
  Iustinian in the entrance to his Institutions, saith, That in
  the Maiestie royall, the beautie of armes is not onely necessarie, but the
  force also of learning. He attributs Force to Learning, because that bridles
  the strongest thing that is, which is Armes. Our Sauiour Christ then, beeing
  the true patterne of so great and glorious a Prince, as none greater; Power and
  Wisedome could not chuse but concurre &amp; meet equally in him; To whom, with
  the Father, and the Holy-Ghost, be ascribed all Power, Honour, and Glorie,
  &amp;c.
            
         
         
            
            THE XXVIII. SERMON, VPON THE WEDNESDAY AFTER THE FOVRTH SVNDAY
IN LENT.
            
               
                  IOHN 9.1. 
                  
                     Praeteriens, Iesus vidit Caecum.
                   
                  And as Iesus passed by, he saw a man that was blind,
  &amp;c.
               
            
            
               OVr Sauiour Christ going out of the Temple, seeking to shun those
stones which they pretended to throw at him,The eye of
  diuine pitty euer fixed vpon pouertie. he cast his eye vpon a poore
blind man that was borne blind: for it is the priuiledge of pouertie and humane
miserie, to haue the eye of diuine pittie to looke downe vpon it, and to
fauour the same; so that he healed him at once both in bodie and in soule: the
Historie whereof is no lesse large than it is pleasing.
            Christ had said, For iudgement I am come into this world, that
they which see not, may see,
               
                  Iohn 9.39.
               and that they which see might be made blind. Now here he began to
fulfull this prophecie, by reuealing to the Pharisees, Antequam Abraham
fieret, ego sum. He left them so blind, that they tooke vp stones to stone
him to death; &amp; in that verie instant, meeting with this blind man, hee
made his eyes so cleere and so perfect, that those did not know him, who held
conuersation with him. And thus did the case now stand betwixt the Gentile and
the Iew; the one was stark blind, and the other did see perfectly; the Iew
enioyed none, the Gentile much light, The people that walked in darkenesse
haue seene a great light;
                  Esay 9.2. and
they vpon whome the light shined, dwell in the land of the shaddow of death.
And in another place, We waited for light, but behold obscuritie; for
brightnesse, but we walke in darknesse;
               
                  Esay
  59.9. 
               we grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we
had no eyes; we stumble at noone day as in the night, we are in desolate
places as dead men. The Spouse speaking of her Beloued, saith, En ipse stat
post parietem nostrum, Behind the wall of our humane nature: and our
Pharisees groping and stumbling in the darke, brake their heads against the
wall. That place likewise of the 29 Chapter may be hereunto accommodated,
                  Esay 29.14. 
               Behold, I will proceed to doe a
meruailous worke among this People, euen a meruailous worke, and a wonder,
by giuing sight to one that was borne blind: For the wisedome of wise men
shall perish, and the vnderstanding of their prudent men shall be hid. The
Scribes and Pharisees had the light of the Scripture,
                  Esay 6
                     •
                  .1. and did looke for the Messias; For Syons sake will I
not hold my peace, and for  Ierusalems sake I will not
rest, vntill the righteousnesse thereof goe forth as brightnesse, and the
saluation thereof as a lampe that burneth. But they were vnthankeful for
this light, that curse of Iob lighting vpon them, Let them looke
for light, but haue none,
               
                  Iob. 3 9.
               neither let them see the dawning of the day. They were so blind, that
this blind man taught them the light, and told them who was the Messias whom
they so long expected.
            
               As Iesus passing by, &amp;c. This businesse seemeth to be
a thing done as it were by chance; but there is not any thing that God doth
commit more to memory, than the relieuing of our miseries. The Bush wherein God
appeared vnto Moses, which did burne, and yet was not burned, did
represent the stubble which his people did gather to bake their bricke, and
those firie tribulations which did burne, but not consume them. And if any man
shall aske me, How this Bush could be on fire, and not be burnt? I answer, That
God had such present vse of the fire, that it seemed to ouerslip the bush. The
Prophet Abacucke went to carrie food to the sheepheards that were in
the field, but the angel taking him vp by the haire of the head, carried him
away into Chaldea, &amp; landed him in the Lyons Den in Babylon; for
Daniels hunger required that hast, that the reapers in the field were
forgotten; which was an extraordinarie care and especiall prouidence of God.
But why doth the Euangelist say, Praeteriens, passing by as it were by
chance? And Ezechiel vnder the similitude of an Infant, deliuering
vnto vs, That as soone as she was borne, she was cast out into the open field,
to the loathing of her person in that day she was borne; When I passed by
thee,
               
                  Ezech. 16. 
               I saw thee polluted
in thyne owne bloud. Hereunto I answer, That God doth dissemble his care,
because thou being not able to pay the principall, nor any desire to satisfie
this his great care and loue towards thee, he would draw thee (if it were
possible) to the acknowledgement of that debt which is due vnto him: for it is
a common custome amongst men, not to make requitall of that care and loue
which hath bin shewn vnto them. A Goldsmith makes a cup for you, you pay him
for the weight of his plate according to it's ounces, and for the fashion
according to it's workemanship; but you doe not pay him for his loue vnto you,
for Loue is so noble a thing, that it cannot be repayd but with Loue. And if
mans loue cannot be repayd, much lesse Gods: but if it dasheth thee out of
countenance,Loue cannot be repaied but with loue. to
see what a deale of loue God expresses towards thee, &amp; that he makes thee
the mark wherat he aimes al his care; yet at least shew thy selfe so thankful
as to satisfie him for thy workemanship, as thou wouldest the Goldsmith for the
fashioning of a peece of plate, whither he had by chance, or purposely made it
for thee. God demanded of Iob, Where wast thou when I laid the foundations
of the earth? As if he should haue said, Because thou camest not then into
the world, thou maist haply thinke that I made this so faire a fabrick either
by chance, or for my own pleasure, [Ludens in orbe terrarum] and not
purposely for thee; but I would haue thee to know▪ that I made this so
princely a pallace for thee, furnishing it with all things fitting for thee,
and that if I had not foreknowne that thou shouldst enioy the same, I would not
haue made it. But if thou shalt not repay mee for my care and my loue, that I
made thee for the end of this so great a worke; yet thankefully accept of the
worke i
                  •
                selfe, because thou art
hee that receiuest benefit thereby.
            Our Sauior as he passed thus along, was verie angrie, and much
offended; but he had no sooner met with this blind man, but his anger was
alayed,Christ euen in his sufferings mindfull of our
  solace. and grew more calme and milde. In Caiphas Court, a sea
of iniuries &amp; affronts came tumbling in vpon him; and euen then in this
great inundation that brake thus violently  in vpon him;
he no sooner turned his eye aside vpon Peter, and beheld those two
Fountaines of teares that flowed from his eyes, but that he presently seemed
wonderfull well contented. The booke of Canticles introduceth the
Beloued speaking to his Spouse,
                  Cant. 5.
               I haue mixed my myrrh with my spice: ô friends, drink of my wine,
yea, drinke aboundantly, ô Beloued; for the end of his bitter
draughts prooued to be a most pleasant wine for our palats. In any other brest
than that of our Sauiour, the stones of the Pharisees would haue made a great
noyse: but malice is a verie shallow water, but goodnesse a verie deepe Sea. A
stone in a shallow Well wil make a great noyse, &amp; will dash the water
about thyne eares; but in a deepe Well you shall scarce heare the sound
thereof. But this comparison is somewhat of the shortest; for it is one thing
to suffer, and another in suffering, to take compassion. But the goodnesse of
our Sauiour Christ did patiendo compati: non solum erat patiens, sed
compatiens. Saint Bernard saith, That he did not only suffer ill,
but did requite ill with good, Retribuebant mala pro bonis, &amp; odium pro
dilectione mea, They returned euil for good, and hatred for my loue; But
to return good for euill, is the highest round of Vertues ladder.
Salomon saith, That wisdome is fairer to behold, and more beautifull
than the Sunne, Speciocior est Sole: For the Sunne is eclipsed by the
darkenesse of night; but the wisedome of the Father, neither malice, nor
iniurie, nor any other affront can cloud or darken it, but serueth oftentimes
as an occasion to beame forth greater fauours vpon vs. Saint Bernard
compares our Sauiour Christ to the Bee, which alwayes labours and takes pains
for other folkes profit: a swarme of Bees lights in thy garden, leaues thee
honie-combes and waxe, all this not costing thee so much as one crum of bread.
But this comparison likewise comes a little too short; for the Bee being
offended, stings thee; But our Sauiour Christ inriching our house with worldly
goods and heauenly blessings, doth not hurt vs, though we prouoke him neuer so
much to anger; he brings vs in Honie, but leaues no sting behind him. Better
and more proper is that comparison of the Vine, whereunto our Sauiour compares
himselfe, Ego sum vitis v
                     •
                  ra, I
am the true Vine, which if you cut and prune, it yeelds you a hundred for
one.
            
               As Iesus passed by, he saw, &amp;c. Here pittie ouercame
passion, and clapt a bridle on the hastinesse of his anger;Pitty euer profitable to them that vse it. 1. Kings
  30. for pittie neuer blots out those businesses that require hast.
Dauid marched in great hast with his souldiers after certaine
theeuish Amalekites, that had burnt and spoyled Zicklag; in which hot pursuit
hee found an Aegyptian in the field, who was readie to giue vp the Ghost, for
he had eaten no bread, nor dranke any water in three dayes and three nights.
Whereupon Dauid made a stand, relieued him, and restored him againe
to life; for the which he well repayd this his kindnesse; for he brought him to
the place where these theeues were eating, drinking, and dancing for ioy of the
spoyle they had taken; from whom Dauid recouered all that the
Amalekites had taken away. Some spitefull man will not sticke to say, We are
now as pittifull: not considering in the meane while with himselfe, that he
would neuer forgoe a Play, to go heare a Sermon, neuer omit other his worldly
businesse, to goe visit an hospitall, or to giue an almes to the Poore.
Iob complaineth, That when he sate scraping his sores vpon the
dunghill, his brethren past along by him, not so much as once vouchsafing to
looke vpon him,
                  Iob. 6. but hasted speedily
by him, like the downfall of a water from a rocke, which swiftly glideth downe
to the bottome of some low valley: Praeterierunt me sicut torrens in
conuallibus. The seuentie Interpreters render it, Non respexerunt,
They did no whit respect him, nor so much as offer to looke after him.
Imagine (saith Thomas) that foure goe hand in hand together 
 all one way, and that one of them fals into a pit,
whilest the rest passe on and let him alone: In like maner might Iob
say, that his brethren dealt so with him; being that neither nature, neerenesse
of bloud, old acquaintance, nor long bred friendship, could moue their hearts
to pittie, or their eyes to teares.
            
               Iesus saw a man that was blind from his birth. And his
Disciples asked him saying, Master, Who did sinne, This man, or his parents?
that he was borne blind, &amp;c. This is an old fe
                  •
               tered wound, that we tooke in the fall of our first
parents, to be too curious in other mens faults, and too forgetfull of our
owne. Saint Chrysostome saith, That there is scarce one to be found,
euen amongst those that are most perfect, which are not infected with this
vice. If a man walke abroad in a morning into the fieldes, his neighbors
inheritance is more in his eye than his owne; and when he comes home at night,
he presently askes what newes there is stirring? And is well pleased with any
tidings that are told him, especially of other mens misfortunes.
Plutarch makes this simile; That as in Cities there vse to be some
vnlucky gates, wherat nothing enters, or goes out that is good, saue dunghils
that lye in the streete, and persons that are condemned to death; so likewise
into the eares of the Curious, nothing enters that is good. It was the saying
of a certaine Philosopher, that of all kind of winds, those were most
troublesome, which did whirle our clokes from off our shoulders: In like
manner, of all sortes of men, the Curious are most to be abhorred, which vnwrap
the clokes of our shame, blow open our disgrace, and rip vp the graues of the
dead: and as Xenocrates said of them, They enter not into other mens
houses with their feet, but their eyes.
            
               He saw, &amp;c. This might very well assure them, that he
lookt vpon him with the eye of Loue.
            First, because it is Gods nature and condition, when he doth one
fauour, to ingage himselfe for many other courtesies. And therefore,Whom God once fauours, he still followes. hauing done him
the fauour to looke vpon him, he was now obliged to giue him his sight.
Cicero saith, That it is the property of a noble brest, to him that
owes much, to desire to make that man more his debtor. Est animi ingenui,
cui multum debeas, eidem &amp; plurimum velle debere. The bestowing of one
fauour vpon mee (saith Ecclesiastic
                     ••
                  
               ) makes me the bolder to beg another; And since thou hast
stuck vnto me in my life, ô Lord, doe the like in my death. God did
reueale vnto Dauid by the Prophet Nathan, perpetuitie of his
Kingdome; and after this so great a fauour, he further addeth, Therefore is
thy seruants heart readie to pray vnto thee. Ezechias had receiued
extraordinarie kindnesses from Gods hand, and these were motiues to make him
intercede for farther fauours. In a word, one courtesie conferred vpon vs,
incourageth vs to craue a second. But that the conferring of one fauor

                  •
               hould lay an obligation, or make
one desirous to doe another on the necke of that, this onely holds in God, as a
peculiar noblenesse belonging vnto him. And for to secure vs of all those
fauours, which wee can expect from his greatnesse, the Church saith of our
Sauiour Christ, that was offered vp for vs, Nobis pignus datur, A pledge is
giuen vs. Now a pledge is alwayes pawned for lesse than it is worth.
Hauing therefore thus impawned the infinit treasure of his person, what will he
not bestow vpon vs? If he haue giuen thee eyes, will hee not giue thee hands?
And if he haue giuen thee hands, will he not giue thee a heart? So that Gods
doing of one fauour, is the assuring of many. In the Wildernesse when all
Agars bread and water was spent, and seeing her sonne ready to dye for
thirst, she lifted vp her eyes to Heauen calling vpon God, Et exa
                     •
                  diuit dominus vocem

                     ••
                  eri, And the Lord heard the voyce
of the child. His giuing eare vnto her, was a signe 
that he would giue her water, &amp; suddenly a Well was discouered vnto her,
&amp;c. Here were two fauours done her alreadie; First, His hearing her.
Secondly, His granting her her request. But God did not stop here, In
gentem magnam faciam cum,
               
                  Gen. 21.
               I will make him a great Nation.
            
            Secondly, Because mans wants and necessities being looked on by
the eye of Gods loue and pittie, his goodnes neuer leaues him till his remedie
be wrought. And therfore it is said by the Psalmist,
                  Psal. 142. 
               I poured out my complaint before
him, I shewed before him my trouble: so that when I present my griefes
&amp; tribulations before him, if he once but looke vpon them, I am sure he wil
help me. This kind of cunning Martha &amp; Mary vsed with
him, Behold, he is sick whom thou louest. Ezechias opening
Zenacharibs letter in the Temple, fraught with such a deale of pride
&amp; arrogancie,4. Reg. 19. exercised the
same trick, Lord open thyne eyes and see, &amp; bow downe thyne eare, and
heare the words of Zenacharib, &amp;c. And as our sinnes doe crie vnto God
for vengeance, so our miseries doe crie vnto him for mercie. God plagued the
Princes of the Philistines with that foule and grieuous disease of the
Emmerods; but vpon their presenting the Images of them before the Arke, he
freed them of that euill. Thou knowest my shame and my reproch,
&amp;c. And if my prayers doe not sometimes pierce Heauen, it is because
my persecutions and afflictions haue ascended thither, and notified my
miserie: and when man is ashamed to speake, yet that will speake for him.
            
               Who did sinne, this man, or his parents? Saint
Cyril saith, That the Disciples hauing whispered amongst themselues
touching this mans misfortune,Sin the occasion of all
  euill. they askt our Sauiour, Quis peccauit? &amp;c. Wherein
they went wisely to worke, in attributing punishment in the generall, to
sinne; for by attributing them many times to naturall causes, as to the Sunne,
aire, water, and other distemperatures, the fruit of Gods chastisements is
lost. Petrus Crysologus treating of those teares which our Sauiour
shed at Lazarus death, saith, That he did not bewaile his buriall,
for he knew how happie he was in being out of the world; but the occasion. He
thought vpon Adams apple, that had beene the cause of so much hurt,
and this was it that made him to weepe. And this his weeping was, as if hee
should haue said, What a deale of sorrow hath this one act of disobedience in
him, brought vpon all mankind, and consequently vpon me, who must beare the
burthen of his and their offence? O Sinne, How deere will it cost both Man and
me? In a word, There is not any one thing so often repeated in Scripture, as,
That Sin is the cause of our miseries, De humo non egreditur dolor.
And in this respect, verie iust and lawfull was this their demand, touching,
Quis peccauit? Who sinned?
            
            First, Because they did desire to see it verified, whether this
fauour which they muttered amongst themselues, were well employed or no: for it
is a common custome in Court, when the King shall cast a fauourable eye vpon
any one, and gratiously looke vpon him; not onely to examine his life, and to
question what hee is, but to rip vp that of his fathers and predecessours, to
flea those that are aliue, and to disinterre those that are dead. And howbeit
for prouisions of offices, and for the conferring of Court dignities, and
other publique preferments in the Commonwealth, it is fitting for Kings and
Princes to take a strict view and examination concerning the honestie and
abilitie of those they aduance; yet in the relieuing of wants &amp;
necessities, al such diligences are vnnecessarie and vniust: For a Prince, or
any other rich and powerfull person, (sayth Saint Chrysostome) ought
to be like a good port or hauen, which should receiue into her protection all
sort of passengers whatsoeuer, but to those that haue suffered 
 shipwracke, and are without present reliefe and helpe,
vpon casting away, should more especially stretch out her armes, and take them
in before they sinke.
            Secondly, For that they attributed the blindnesse of
Celidonius to the sinnes of his parents: for albeit God doth punish
the sinnes of the fathers in the children, euen to the fourth generation; yet
this punishment is neuer in the soule, but in the bodie, for the soules are not
by race and descent; neither hath the soule of the sonne any kindred or
alliance with that of the father, as the bodie hath; onely the sinne of
Adam hath somewhat thereof, as being the head and root from whom we
all come.
            Thirdly, They would haue reduced this punishment to his owne
proper sins, for that he was borne blind; for though God doth vse anticipation
in doing fauours for some seruices that are to be done, yet doth he neuer
punish sinnes not yet committed: but it is rather the blazon of his justice, to
punish with a slow hand; as it is of his mercie, to pardon speedily.
            Fourthly, to attribute punishments to faults committed, is a good
iudgement, and an approoued censure, for our owne sinnes, but not for other
mens. When our Sauiour Christ said to his Apostles, One of you shall betray
me; euery one lookt first into himselfe, demanding of him, Rabbi,
Master, Am I the man or no? And though he shewed them a faire
euidence, Hee that dips his hand with mee in the dish, &amp;c. yet
none of them fixt their eyes vpon Iudas, nor tooke notice of the signe
then giuen them. The Pharisee is not so much condemned for his own proper
sinnes, as for the scorne and pride wherewith he despiseth others, I thanke
thee, ô God, that I am not like other men. Emisenus saith, That
there can be no greater misfortune, than to make those sinnes myne, which
another man doth commit for his pleasure or his profit, both which I make to be
myne, by iudging rashly of them.
            
               Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents,
               Man
  the Epitome of the World; the Eye, of Man. 
               but that the workes of
God should bee made manifest in him. Some man may aske me the question,
Why God should make choice of these his eyes, to make them to be an instrument
of manifesting his workes, rather than the hands of the benummed, the feet of
the lame, the tongue of the dumbe, the raising of the dead, or the torment of
those that are possessed with Deuills? I answer hereunto, That all these
miracles might serue verie well for Gods glorie. And of Lazarus his
death our Sauiour said, That it was pro gloria Dei, for Gods
glorie.
               The Eye is the Hearts market place. But
in the Eyes there is a more especial conueniencie (as S. Chrysostome
hath noted it) than in other the parts of the bodie: For as man is the summe
and Epilogue of all the naturalities of the World, for which reason they call
him, Microcosmos, A little World; so the eyes are the summe and
Epilogue of man. And as Aristotle saith, That the Soule is all things,

                  〈◊〉
                a certaine kind of manner,
because all things are come vnder the compasse of i
                  •
               's apprehension and vnderstanding; so
the eyes in a manner are all things, because they comprehend all things in
them, the heauens, the planets, the starres, the elements, birds, fishes,
beasts, plants, and stones; nor doe they onely see in the eyes, corporall
creatures, and visible substances, but likewise the inuisible passions of our
soule; as loue, hate, pride, humilitie, &amp; the like, so saith
Plinie. And therefore Saint Augustine stiles the eyes, the
heralds of the heart. Saint Peter tells vs, That there are eyes full
of adulteries: In a word,2. Pet. 2. The eyes

                  •
               as Salomon saith) are the
open market place of our bosome. And in another place, All the wayes of man
are in his eyes: And Ecclesiasticus, Ex visu cognoscitur vir. Our
Sauiour Christ did restore this man to his sight, and made his eyes become 
 cleere, to the end that in them might bee cleerely
manifested the most famous workes of God. Irenaeus, Saint
Chrysostome, and Saint Ambrose say, That he made him without
eyes, that by bestowing them afterwards vpon him, he might manifest to the
world, That God his Redeemer had created him anew. Saint Austine harpt
vpon the same string, treating of Malchus his eare.
            Saint Augustine saith, That God making these eyes of so
base a matter as c
                  •
               ay or durt,
intermingled with spettle, representeth the mysterie of the Incarnation,
wherein God did raise and lift vp our nature to the admirable vnion of his
heauenly condition, from whence the Word became flesh, which gaue light to
this blind man, and those that sate in the shadow of death, hauing the eyes of
their soules darkened with sinne.
            Saint Ambrose affirmeth, That Christ taught vs by this
myracle, that for to recouer our soules sight, we must put durt vpon our eyes,
that is, we must thinke vpon our owne basenesse and frailtie: For the
principium or beginning of Christian perfection, is, for a man to
know himselfe. Nor were his workes onely manifested in these his eyes, but all
his other perfections and attributes; as his omnipotencie, in restoring his
eye-sight, or rather making him new eyes, molded out of durt; his justice, in
letting the Pharisees liue in their blindnesse; and his goodnesse and bountie,
in giuing light to this blind man.
            
               Neither hee nor his parents, &amp;c. Saint
Chrysostome askes the question, Why God would manifest his workes in
this blind man so much to his cost, being that he might haue taken for this
purpose, means of good, and not of hurt? Saint Ambrose saith, That
our Sauiour Christ was willing to take our sinnes as a pledge or gage of his
glorie, that he might make it thereby the surer: For those that impose
Tributes, or settle their Rents, are alwayes careful to haue good securitie;
and of all other assurances,Sin the only Security that God
  could haue of man, for his Glory. the best is, that the State thus
ingaged or impawned, be properly belonging to the debtor. And if God should
ground his glorie on our goodnesse, we cannot giue him any good securitie for
it, because this is others goods, and not our owne: but our sinnes are our
owne, and whatsoeuer is ill in vs, properly belongeth to vs, and are so
perpetuated to our persons, that they can neuer faile vs. Christ did redeeme vs
from the captiuitie of our crimes, but in this his redeeming and ransomming vs
from sinne, this holy Saint sayth, That he had a kind of interest of his
owne:Reasons why God suffereth many corporall defects, and
  weaknesses in man. for although God did not remaine thereby more
powerfull, more mercifull, more iust, &amp;c. Habuit tamen quod ad cultum
suae Maiestatis adiungeret, He had something by the bargaine, that gaue an
addition to the worship of his diuine Maiestie. And as it is in another
place, by giuing vs libertie, Sibi etiam aliquid acquisiuit, He got
somewhat also to himselfe. What did he get by it? He got in a manner all
his glorie by it; he got to be reuerenced, serued, praised, acknowledged, and
adored, to bee as well a Sauiour as a God: so that in some sort God may be said
to be indebted to the ill that is in vs. Tertullian saith, That God
then loueth this our flesh, when it is fullest of miseries, for by giuing
remedie thereunto▪ his attributes are knowne and acknowledged in the
World: and I dare be bold to say it, That if it were not for the infirmities of
our flesh, and the in-bred ill that is in vs, those good things would not bee
knowne and acknowledged, which come from God. In the 113 Psalme, Dauid
makes an enumeration of those meruailes and prodigious wonders which God
multiplied in the behalfe of his People, at their departure out of Aegypt: And
after that he had related many of them, he endeth with this, Goe on as thou
ha
                     ••
                   begun, ô Lord, with these
Nations. For although the profit will be ours, the honour will be thine:
and whereas these Nations doe point out their gods with their 
 fingers, it is fit we should also know that wee haue a
God amongst vs, and not a god of wood, as they haue.
            The second reason is Saint Bernards: Amongst all his
other attributes,2. Reason. none in our opinion, none
(considering his naturall condition) is to be compared with that of his being
misericors, a mercifull God: He is called Pater
misericordiae, The Father of mercie; which presupposeth our miserie: and
to multiplie his blessings and his goodnesse vpon vs, we hauing no sinne nor
euill in vs, hee could hardly doe it. If hee should haue dealt thus with
Adam before his fall, and with the Angells in their blessed estate, it
might haue been an effect of his bountie, but not of his mercie, which is
aboue all his workes.
            But some man perhaps will say, O Lord, to throw euills vpon vs,
that thou maist afterwards remooue them from vs, is no such great fauour. Yes
marry is it, and that an extraordinarie fauour; for we doe not know health, but
by sickenesse; the seising of that soundly vpon vs, shewes what a blessing a
sound bodie is: Speciosa misericordia Dei, quasi nubes pluuiae in tempore
siccitatus, As raine is welcome in a drought, so is Gods mercie to the
Afflicted: and so to this blind man was his sight.
            The third is Saint Chrysostomes: God sometimes takes from
vs what is good,3. Reason. God neuer takes any thing
  
                     •
                  rom vs, but
  
                     〈◊〉
                   return a better. that
he may giue vs that which is better; whatsoeuer God doth repaire by myracle,
is better than that which is possessed by nature, as it succeeded in the wine
at the Wedding. Saint Bernard treating of the conuersion of Saint
Paul, saith, That it was a great happinesse that he was strucken
blind, for by this his blindnesse he was taken vp into the third Heauen, &amp;
there saw such things as man may not vtter; and when he came to receiue againe
the eys of this his bodie, he possessed withall the eye-sight of his soule:
and so did it likewise fare with this blind man.
            The fourth reason is, God inflicting the euill of punishment vpon
man,4. Reason. Nothing which God inflicts vpon vs can sauour
  of injustice. God therein doth not doe man iniustice; for (as Saint
Chrysostome saith) there is in this life no more than one good, and
one ill; the good consists in seruing God; the ill, in offending him. Let no
man therefore complaine of his misfortunes, for there cannot be any disaster so
great, that can hurt thee in the least haire of thy head, Capillus de
capite vestro non peribit. And if a man doe not runne hazard in the losse
so much as of one haire, there will be much more care had, that the better and
more materiall parts shall not perish. Many in Ierusalem hauing eyes, remained
blind; and this blind man hauing no eyes, came thereby to enioy his sight both
in bodie and in soule. Seneca saith, That the want of eyes caused in
many the want of sinning, &amp; was a great occasion of their innocencie of
life, and inculpabi
                  •
               itie.
            The fifth reason is, That it is no iniustice in God,5. Reason. No man but d
                     •
                  serueth more than God doth lay vpon him. to inflict
punishment vpon vs; for albeit there be no proper precedent sinne, neither in
our selues nor our Parents, yet the original sinne that we are liable vnto, may
draw, and that iustly, most grieuous punishments vpon vs; as Saint
Augustine hath learnedly noted concerning little infants which suffer
sickenesse and death. So that Gods freeing of man from punishment, is mercie;
his not freeing him, no iniustice. Thou hast many debtors, thou forgiuest one,
and suest another; it is a kindnesse to the one, but no iniurie to the other.
One owes thee a great summe, thou art contented to

                  •
               ake a little; for this, thy debtor
owes thee a great deale of thankes. God tooke away this mans eyes from him, he
might likewise haue bereaued him of his feet and his hands, he is bound to
thanke him that he spared him the vse of those. Besides, this cannot be said
to be so much a taking away of that which is due, as  not
a giuing of that vnto him, which he might, if he would. The good things which
we enioy, are from God, and hee may distribute them as it best pleaseth him.
Againe, the arme is to defend the head, though it runne the hasard of being
lost; a Citisen for the safeguard of his Commonwealth, a Subiect to saue his
Soueraignes life, a Christian for the glorie of Christ, a Creature for the
honour of his Creator, and Martyrs for the maintenance of their Religion, haue
not refused to lay downe their liues: it is not much then, that this man should
be contented with the losse of his eyes, that the Workes of God might be made
manifest.
            
               6 Reason.The sixt reason is, That
because the heart doth commonly follow after the eyes, it is better to want
eyes than to haue them. It is the common opinion not only of the Phylosophers,
but of Gods Saints, That the eyes are principium

                     •
                  alorum nostrorum, The induction
to all our ill. Lucian calls them, Prima amoris vi
                     •
                  , The onely doore that opens vnto
loue. Plato, Principium amoris nostri, The entrance to loue.
Dionysius, Adalides, or Duces amoris, The guides or ringleaders to
loue. Seneca, Animae finestrae, The window to the soule.
Saluianus, The casements to mans brest. Clemens Alexandrinus,
That the first encounters and skirmishes sallie from forth the eyes.
Nazianzen stiles them, The prime instruments of our bewitching. In a
word, The eyes were the ruine of Lots wife; the eyes, The bewitching
of the children of Israell, Videntes filij Dei, filias hominum,
&amp;c. The eyes, ouerthrew Eue in Paradice; the Iudges that
would haue wronged Susanna in Babylon, Dauid, Sampson, and
Salomon, might all of them verie well say, Vt vidi &amp; perij, My
sight vndid me. Ieremie complaineth, That all the Daughters of his Citie
were vtterly vndone by their eyes, Depredatus est oculus meus animam meam
in cunctis filiabus vrbis. Saint Peter, That many Cast-awayes
haue their eyes full of Adulteries. Plutarch reporteth, That a
certaine Conquerour entring the Citie in triumph, casting his eye aside vpon a
handsome young woman, had his heart taken prisoner by her; and sending his
lookes still after her, he gaue occasion to Diogenes to breake this
jeast vpon him, That this faire mayden had like a Chicken wrung his necke thus
aside, looking still backward as his Chariot went forward.
            
               7 Reason. It is God aloue must fashion vs
  anewThe seuenth is of Irenaeus, Saint Ambrose, and
Saint Chrysostome; It being manifested in this blind man, That God is
our sole Creator, and that no hands but his onely, can mold and fashion vs
anew. Man considering the Worlds great beautie, was desirous to search out the
author thereof; and the Deuill boasting forth and assuming to himselfe the
glorie of this admirable piece of worke, blazoned it forth vnto them, I am the
Lord of all this Vniuerse, I made the wor
                  •
               d, and I possesse it. Whereupon, Man gaue vnto him the honour of
God, the greater part of the world adoring him in his Idolls. God finding
himselfe thus wronged, did permit in man these maimes and defects in the eyes,
hands, and feet, and other the like monstrous mis-shapednesse. Now if the
Deuill had the power to repaire these imperfections, he might then enioy this
glorie: But if all the Idols (as Baruc saith) being put together,
cannot giue sight to the Blind, how can they then be God?
                  Baruc 6. The wonderfullest worke that God euer
made, was Man; and in Man, the greatest artifice and workemanship, are his
eyes. Our Sauior therfore had so ordred it, that this man should be born blind,
that his eys being fashioned &amp; giuen him by his hand, the world might
acknowledge him to be their God and their Redeemer.
            
               When hee had thus spoken, hee spat on the ground, and made
clay of the spittle, &amp;c. Saint Ambrose dwels much vpon these
ceremonies. And much adoe is made about the cost and cure of this poore mans
eyes. O Lord, thou hast restored other  men by a bare
word onely, so didst thou reuiue the widowes sonne lying on the beere; and so
didst thou raise vp Lazarus from the graue, thy voice alone was
sufficient. In the creation of man, thou didst onely vse the dust of the earth,
and therefore man is said to be made de limo terrae. And albeit some
doe affirme, that man was made de luto, of the durt, or mould of the
earth, yet the Hebrew word, expresses it to no other fulnesse, than that man
was made of dust. And our vulgar translation saith, Puluis est. But
how is it that these eyes must cost a little more labour than all the other
eyes besides, and all those other liues tha
                  •
                God hath giuen man? There are

                  •
               hree reasons rendred.
            The first of Saint Cyprian, who saith,1. Reason. That this blind man had not onely laesa
                     •
                   potentiam, the facultie
disinabled where the sight did reside, as many blind men, who hauing the organs
of their eyes whole, and the apples cleare, see nothing at all; But this man
had otherwise the organs of his eyes wanting vnto him, the hollow places
thereunto belonging, beeing like shop windowes close shut vp, and skinned ouer
as the rest of the face, and that our Sauiour did fill vp those emptie holes
with durt which he had moulded and knedded together into a masse or lumps of
clay, with the helpe of his spittle. And this was the reason, why they
afterwards said vnto him, How were thine eyes opened? But to giue a
man an arme, a hand, or a foote, it may sooner be imagined, than made by any
but by our Sauior Christ, who was God. Whence I infer, That because God had
breathed the spirit of Life into Man, there were certain Hereticks that stickt
not to say, that the Soule of Adam was of the substance of God; they
might better haue sayd that it was made of the substance of the eyes of this
blind man.
            The second,2. Reason. For that the
Pharisees did attribute these our Sauiours Miracles to the Deuill, he did proue
in this blind man, that onely the vertue of God was powerfull to worke this
wonder.
            First, Because no naturall vertue can giue sight to the blind. And
therefore by consequence the Deuill could not doe it, whose miracles are
wrought by applying the naturall vertue of the Creatures, as Saint
Austen teacheth.
            Secondly, He made good this his miracle, by curing him with this
clay, or dust, which was verie good meanes rather to put out, than doe any good
to the eyes. Whereas if the Deuill should haue cured him, hee must haue done
it, by applying some helpfull vertue that had beene accommodated and fitted for
the sight. Onely it is God that can worke these strange effects by contrarie
causes.
            The third, is of Saint Ambrose. Our Sauior Christ was
willing to aduantage this mans sight both in bodie and in soule:3. Reason. And therefore it is a farre greater miracle to
create the eys, than to raise vp the dead to life. This blind man was to be the
battalion that was to withstand many great incounters, and contradictions; As
the strict examination of his blindnesse, what were his parents, what his
birth, what his breeding: And therefore it was requisit that he should be armed
with a great deale of light, with a great deale of courage, constancie, and
resolution, not onely to answere the arguments, which the passion and
hard-heartednes of the Iudges were to presse him withall, but to suffer
banishment, &amp; extrusion from their Synagogue, which sentence of
excommunication they were to pronounce against him.
            
               I must worke the workes of him that sent mee, while it is day,
&amp;c. I must not let slip the short time of my life, death drawes neere,
and it behooues mee to make hast.Wee must make hay while the
  Sun shines. The Husbandman when hee sees the ground is throughly soked
with raine, he hastens to the sowing. Saint Austen cals good Workes,
the Seedes of blessednesse,  which we must sow in our
life time, that we may reap the fruit of them hereafter, They went foorth
weeping, sowing in teares, but they shall returne with ioy, bearing sheaues in
their bosome.
            
            
               I must worke, &amp;c. Good God, What doth this import
thee? It importeth Man to looke vnto it. In that correspondence which God holds
with Man, hee will that they bee partners and share gaines alike: and therefore
hee calls our good, his; and his glorie, ours. Our Sauior Christ suffers death;
&amp; his death, is our redemption. And therefore it is said, It was meet
that Christ should dye. Saint Paul preacheth this Doctrine, and
giuing the World to vnderstand thereof, hee discouereth Christs glorie,
vttering thereupon, I shall shew vnto you, how fit it was that he should
suffer for my sake.
            
            
               The night commeth, when no man can worke, &amp;c. Euerie
one hath his day, which is the period of his sowing season, and of his labour;
which done, he may haue the happinesse to take his quiet rest in the night. He
that shall goe about to make of night, day, shall find hee is much deceiued;
for, The night commeth when no man can worke. That which importeth is,
That while wee haue time, we doe good: for to this end Time is giuen
vnto vs. And if the figge tree, because it did not bring foorth fruit in it's
due time, was cursed by our Sauiour: what shall become of the sinner that at no
time brings foorth any fruit? Saint Bernard much condemneth those
men, which seekes after occasions for to passe away the time, as to game, chat,
read idle poems, and tell tales and lyes, to weare away the time, least
otherwise it should seeme tedious vnto them. The time which God giues thee for
Repentance, to craue pardon for thy sinnes, to sue for grace, and for to
purchase glorie, thou letst it runne on without any fruit: farre better it were
for thee to redeeme this thy ill spent time; for hee that redeemeth his time by
Repentance, redeemeth all sortes of time whatsoeuer, Euen the time that is
past. For albeit, ad praeteritum non est potentia, the time that is past
can not be recalled, yet it is not to be vnderstood touching the time of
Repentance; according to that saying of Saint Paul, Redimentes

                     •
                  empus, &amp;c. Redeeming the time,
&amp;c. The present with good workes, the past with repentance, the future
with perseuerance, and a full purpose of amendment of life. In a word,
Repentance doth not loose one houre, no not one minute of time. The good
Theefe, in the very last houre, did repaire all the lost yeares of his
life.
            
               Humilitie a great helpe to the curing of a
  sicke soule.
               Goe to the poole of Siloam, &amp;c. First this
blindman did herein shew a great deale of humilitie, in that he was not
scrupulous what they should say of him that should see him passe through the
citie with his eyes full of durt. For points of honour are oftentimes scandalls
to the Soule, and make the infirmitie of the disease incurable. Naaman
the Syrian stood vpon point of honour, that Elisha should come vnto
him,4. Reg. 5. and lay his hands vpon his
leaprosie; As also that hee should bid him to wash himself in Iordan; wherat he
was very wroth, &amp; refused to come at him, saying in anger to
Elisha's messenger; If we shall compare water with water, Are not
Abana, and Pharphar, riuers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israell?
May I not wash in them and be cleane? Which said, hee turned and went away in
a rage. Saint Chrysostome saith, That the Pharisees did not beleeue in
Christ. What, said they with themselues, shall we bee so respectlesse of our
honour, as to subiect our selues with the vulgar to so base a man as hee?
Saul made lesse reckoning of loosing God, than the worlds honour,
Honora me coram populo: So as Samuel would but honour him
before the people, come what would of the rest,The like are
  Obedience &amp; Faith he did not greatly care.
            Secondly, He shewed a great deale of Obedience and Faith. The
waters of  Siloam were not able of themselues to giue
sight to this blind man; but I beleeue (said the blind man) that they will
worke this good effect vpon me: Hee might haue willed me to doe that which
might haue carryed with it a greater reason of hope; But the sheepe (saith
Chrysologus) must goe to his feeding, and his folding, whether it
shall please the sheepheard to lead him forth. The scholler must learne that
which his master teacheth him. The sicke patient must bee ruled by his
Physitian. He hath libertie (saith Saint Chrysostome) to speake vnto
his Physitian, that he will doe his best to cure him, but not to prescribe him
the Physicke that he shall minister vnto him. The like course wee are to take
with the heauenly Physitian of our soules:Sicke patients may
  pray, but not prescribe. For it were a strange kind of vnmannerlinesse
in vs, besides our diffidence to relye vpon an earthly Physitian that can only
cure our bodies, and not put our trust in God, who can cure both body and
soule. The Chirurgian comes to thee with Cauteries, and layes corrosiues to thy
sores, thou patiently indurest it, and not once openest thy mouth, and shalt
thou not as well beare, &amp;c.
            Thirdly, he exprest a great deale of thankfulnesse. Saint
Bernard applies this vertue to those words of Ecclesiastes, The
riuers come out of the Sea, and returne much bettered backe againe to the
Sea; as giuing thankes for the water which they receiued: for the
acknowledging of one kindnes, is the drawing on of another. And if those riuers
should haue rested themselues contented with the waters they had receiued, and
not haue paid the Sea his due Tribute, that bounty would not haue beene
bestowed vpon them. In like manner those good things which wee enioy, flow from
God, that immense Sea of goodnesse, and they are againe to be returned vnto God
through our thankfulnesse; and when that ebbeth in vs, the other neuer floweth
from him, Cessat gratiarum decursus, vbi non est recursus. The raine
from heauen ariseth from the vapours of the earth: And when there are no
vapours, there is no raine. Saint Augustine desired of God, That he
would bee pleased to reueale the secrets of Scripture vnto him, promising in
requitall of so great a fauour, a perpetuall acknowledgement thereof.
Confiteor tibi quicquid invenero in libris tuis. Ecclesiasticus
commending the noble Acts of Dauid, as his wrestling with beares,
tearing the iawes of Lyons, killing of Gyants, and ouercomming the Philistims,
he concludeth, That all these things succeeded luckily with him, because he
was thankefull to the Lord,
                  Eccl. 47. and
directed his heart vnto him, and established the worship of God.
            Fourthly, before our Sauiour Christ had giuen this blind man the
eyes of his soule, he proceeded fairely, maintained Christs honour against the
Pharises that opposed it. And this, as I may so tearme it, his honourable
carriage prepared the way for him to attaine to the heigth of vertue. The
Romans had two Temples adioyning each to other, (as S. Augustin
reports it) the one of Honour, the other of Vertue: But no man could come vnto
that of Vertue, vnlesse he first passed through that of honour.
            And Valerius Maximus relates vnto vs, That M.
Marcellus a Roman Senator, being desirous to build one sole Temple to
Honour and Vertue, the Priests would not permit him to doe it; Alleaging, That
it was not fit, for if by chance any miracle should happen in that Temple, they
were not able to auow, to which of the two it ought to be attributed.
Ioseph fled from the inticements of his wanton and lasciuious
Mistresse, for that it was an offence both to God, and his owne honour,
Quomodo possum hoc malum facere? My Lord hath trusted me with all his
whole house, if I should be false vnto him, I should hazard my happines in
heauen, and my honour on earth. In a word, the Actes of Honour are sometimes 
 so heroicall, that they seeme to be miracles of
Vertue.
            
               He went his wayes therefore and washed, and came
  seeing.
               First, He returned such a strange altred man from that hee was
  before, from the Poole of Siloam, that his neerest neighbours and oldest
  acquaintance did not know him: some said, It is the same man; others, It is
  not, but doth somewhat resemble him. But he that shall turne ouer a new leafe,
  and truly change the forme and course of his life, must not seeme to be the
  same man that he was before. It is Philons note, That it must fare
  with him as it did with Enoch, of whom the Scripture saith,
  Transtulit eum Dominus; from this earthly life, he must passe to a
  heauenly life. Esay did prophecie, That vpon our Sauiour Christs
  comming, the dens of Theeues should be turned into Gardens, and that the Lyons
  should become as mild and gentle as Lambes;
                     Esay

  Pots of Aegypt, yet through repentance you shall be as the wings of a Doue
  couered with siluer, &amp; her feathers with yellow gold. Vpon Saint
  Pauls conuersion the People did not know him, Nonne hic est
  (said they) qui expugnabat Hierusalem?
                  
                     Act.
 9. 
                  Is not this he that hath done much euill to thy Saints at
  Ierusalem? So likewise they said of this blind man, Nonne hic est qui
  sedebat mendicans? Is not this he that sate and begged? Of a poore begger,
  he came to be a learned Doctor, and did confute many of the best and learnedst
  Students of Ierusalem.
               Secondly, He was an Instrument of Gods omnipotencie and power,
  whose blazon is, to ouercome swelling pride and puffing arrogancie, with the
  lowest basenesse, and the weakest frailtie. Plinie reporteth, That
  Rats did dispeople one citie, and Conies another; but much more was it, to

  middest of the firie Furnace, but the flames that came out from thence, did
  burne many of those Ministers and Officers that were appointed to throw Faggots

  The Hebrew translation renders it, Scintillae, The poore little sparks
  that flew from out the flame; &amp;c. Thou, ô Lord, that canst of a
  sparke make a flame, increase our Faith, and inflame our loue towards thee,
  that we may with this blind man stedfastly beleeue, and so come to see thy
  Glorie, &amp;c.

IN LENT.
            
               
                  LVC. 7.11. 
                  
                     Ibat Iesus in Ciuitatem Nain.
                   
                  And Iesus went into a Citie called Nain, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               A Most famous encounter the Euangelist doth here recite vnto vs,
which hapned at the gates of the Citie Nain; hee tells vs of a Lyon that was
deuouring &amp; swallowing down a Sheepe, and of a Dauid that ranne in
and tooke it out of his throat; of a Theefe that had stolne a most pretious
jewell, and of a Iudge that taking him in the manner, with the theft in his
hand, tooke it away from him, leauing him confounded and ashamed: Of two
Fountaines, the one of bitter waters, the other so sweet and sauorie, that it
tooke from those bitter Fountaines all it's gall and bitternesse: Of Death and
of Life, Death turning coward vpon this encounter, and flying (according to
that prophecie of Abacus) from before the face of our Sauiour Christ:
And of a young man that was carried out of the Citie vpon a beere to be buried,
whom his mother went to accompanie to the graue with teares in her eyes, and
many more besides. Vpon which occasion, our Sauior shewed himselfe Lord of
Death and Life.
            
               Iesus went into a Citie called Nain, &amp;c. The
Euangelist had formerly mentioned that myracle of Peters mother in
Law, that of the Leaper, &amp; of the Centurions seruant; and continuing the
same straine, he here goes on with a factum est deinceps, And it came to
passe, that the day after, hee went vnto a Citie called Nain, where in the
verie gate of the Citie he met with a sad companie, that were going to a
solemne Funerall, full of teares and sorrow. And albeit this may seeme to be a
casuall thing, and that hapned (as wee say) by hap-hazard; yet was it the maine
and chiefe care of our Sauiour Christ, to prie into euerie corner of that holy
land, and not to skip ouer any one place therein, which hee did not measure
forth with his feet; so that he did not omit that miserie whereunto hee did not
giu
                  •
                a remedie: Suting with that
saying, Et sanabat omnes, And he cured them all; shewing therein, what
a good account he made of his office of a Sauiour, since his first comming into
the world. There are two things which make a man very eminent in his
office.
            The one, His inclination and good intentions, which are the feet
of our soule.
            
               The other, His paines taking, and continuall
occupation in all kind of Arts, as well Mechanicall, as Liberall. And in verie
truth, in all both good and euill exercises, so powerfull is mans naturall
inclination, That although a man may smother it for a time, yet like fire
vnder ashes, it will at last breake forth into a flame, and discouer his true
disposition. A theefe will neuer leaue his inclination to theeuing,Naturall inclinations hardly admit a chāge though he hath
often escapt the gallowes: Nor a Cheater to his cogging; nor a Merchant to his
trading; nor the Marriner to his nauigation; nor the Huntsman to his hunting;
nor the souldiour his disposition to warre, though he haue discontinued it
neuer so long. Dauid was growne old, and well stroken in yeares, when
his sonne Absalon rose vp in rebellion against him, and yet they could
not perswade him from going into the field, though the whole Army were against
it, and cryed out, Thou shalt not goe forth. And they gaue him a very
good reason for it in the words following: For, if we flye (said they) they
will not care for vs, neither if halfe of vs dye, will they care for vs; but
thou art worth tenne thousand, &amp;c. And this is a kind of voluntary
violence, which with a sweet kind of pleasingnesse hales the heart of man
along. And the like reason may be rendered of continuall occupation and
imployment, it is death to such a one to be idle; and he is no longer well,
then while he is in action. Saint Gregory hath well obserued, That
Iob vpon euery the least occasion of happines that befell him, it was
his fashion of phrase, and a vsuall custome with him to say, The Lords name
be praysed. So that afterwards, hauing formerly vsed himselfe thereunto
in the tempest of his disasters, and those bitter stormes of his aduerser
fortunes, it was neuer out of his mouth. These two things were subsis
                  •••
               g in our Sauiour Christ in a
superlatiue degree.
            First, so great was his inclination and desire to saue, that for
others welfare, he was carelesse of his owne,
            Secondly, he was so solicitous of this his busines, and so wholly
taken therewith, that he cared not for any thing else, And this is expressed
in the word Ibat, He went. Which argues a continuation in his going
on.
            Some man may make a doubt, and say (though vnaduisedly) Had it not
beene better for our Sauiour to haue beene in the mount of Oliues, or in the
garden of Gethseman, or on the hills of Ephrem, than to goe thus from house to
house, from Castle to Castle, and from Citie to Citie? Whereunto I first of all
answer; That it is enough that he did not so, because it was not the better
course. Secondly, because he was the same that was personally promised to that
blessed Land, and that there was not a corner in all that Countrie to be left
out, which should not finde the fauour of his diuine influences. Thirdly, the
exercises of the life actiue,Contemplation and action must
  neuer be seuered. and contemplatiue, are those two wings, whereby the
soule sores vp to heauen. And because one wing will not serue the turne to
reach to so high a pitch, we must not onely serue God in our prayers and
meditations, but also in the releeuing and succouring of our neighbour: And
therefore our Sauiour Christ spent the nights in prayer; Per noctabat in
oratione: and the dayes, in healing bodies, and curing of soules.
Petrus Damianus, vpon the life of Elias and Elisha,
saith, That there is no remote solitary mountaine, which doth not ground it's
retyrednesse vpon some one example or other of the Saints. One, is a friend to
the world, and a louer thereof; and this man alleages, That Elias
spent many dayes in the widow of Sareptaes house; And that
Elisha soiourned with the Shunamite, that was a great and principall
woman in her country: And that both of them did treat with great Princes and
Potentates. Another is a friend and a louer of delicacies, and alleageth, That
Elisha and Elias did accept of them. But these 
 men doe not consider, That if these Prophets did forgoe
their solitude, it was more for the good of others that liued abroad in the
world, than themselues, as also for the raising vp of the dead: And if they did
receiue good intertainment, it was no more than was necessary for the
sustenance of their bodies. Elisha would none of Naamans
gold; Nor Elias be feasted by King Ahab, and
Iezabell his wife. It is a thing worthy the consideration, That our
Sauiour Christ hauing not so much as one pennie of money wherewith to pay
Caesar his Tribute, willed Saint Peter to open the fish that
he had taken with his angling rod. Our Sauiour permitted Peter that he
should catch such a multitude of fishes, that the nets did breake with the
fulnesse of them: But now hee would not haue him catch, but one onely fish. For
a Church-man ought to fish for all the fishes that he can possibly take; and
the more he takes, he doth God the more seruice: but for those money-fishes,
that haue pence in their bellies, he must take but one onely, and that too for
to pay Tribute, not for himselfe, nor to satisfie his owne couetous desires, or
his idle pleasures.

  insinuating a great deale of attention. But to come here with an
  Eccè, it being so common a thing in the world (as nothing more)
  to see the dead dayly carryed forth to their buriall, it seemeth a superfluous
  labour, and a needlesse kind of diligence; especially, being that this our
  life is no other thing but a continued Procession of the quicke and the dead.
  When Adam saw Abel was slaine, and lay dead on the ground,
  being the first man of whom death had taken possession, he was so
  heart-strucken, and so amased thereat, so fearefull, so sorrowfull, and so sad,
  that for many yeares after hee was not freed from this feare and horrour, nor
  were the teares dryed vp from his eyes. For albeit that God had notified vnto
  him, That he was to dye the death, yet did he not as yet know by experience
  what kind of thing death was. But after that death had flesht himselfe in mans
  blood, cutting downe more liues than a Sythe doth grasse in your faire and
  goodly medowes; this his feare and horrour began by degrees to slack and fall
  off. An Eclypse of the sunne doth strangely intertaine the sences attention,
  not onely for to see so faire a Planet lapt vp in mourning weedes, but also for
  that it so seldome hapneth: But the Eclypses of mens liues, though they be the
  fairest sunnes vpon earth, they so hourely, nay so momentarily succeede with
  vs, that we can scarse (which way soeuer we looke) turne our eyes aside from
  them.No obiects more vsuall than those of our
 mortalitie. And not to speake of those lingring deaths, wherein through
  sicknes we lye languishing a long time, besides those occasioned by famine,
  pestilence, and warre: yet those other sudden and vnexpected deaths which daily
  succeed, may euery houre find our eyes occupied. For wee see them euer and anon
  written on the wall, as was that of Balthasar; hanging on the oake, as
  that of Absalon; dipt in a dish of milke, as that of
  Sisara
                  ▪ represented in a dreame, as that of Holophernes;
  appearing at a feast, as that of Iobs children; put in the porridge
  pot, as that of Elishaes Disciples, Mors in olla; in the
  bed, as that of Adulterers; and in the Apoplexie, as that of your
  Gluttons.
               Yet notwithstanding all this, and that it is euery dayes
  example,None lesse regarded, or remembred. yet such
  and so great is the solicitude and care which the diuell takes to blot the
  remembrance of the dead from out the hearts and heads of the liuing, That at
  euery step we see the dead carried forth to their graues, and are so farre from
  ingrauing  the thought thereof in our breasts, that at
  euery step we forget it. There is not that man aliue, which doth not feele and
  experiment death in himselfe, complying with that sentence of God, Morte
  morieris, Thou shalt dye the death. Man is no sooner borne into the world,
  but deaths processe is out against him, which is not long in executing. As the
  weeke wasteth the candle, the worme the wood, and the moath the cloath,2. Reg. 14. so (as the discreete woman of Tekoa
  said to Dauid) Wee must needs die, and are as water spilt on the
  ground which cannot be gathered vp againe. The riuers haue recourse to the
  Sea, and are swallowed vp in the deepe, an
                     •
                   this is the end of them; so is it with our liues, they
  bend from their very birth to the bed of death, we leape from our swathling
  cloathes into our winding shee

                  e.
  This is the end of all flesh. Seneca compares this our life to an
  houre glasse, and as the sand runnes out, so runnes away the houre; so as time
  runnes on, our life runs away; and as it was dust, so to dust it returnes. When
  two Ships sayle each by other, it seemeth to them, That the one flyes like an
  arrow out of a bow, and cuts the waues with a swift wing, and that the other is
  a slugge, and sayles very slowly. And therefore of the way of a Ship in the
  sea, and of a young man running on in a wanton course;
                     Prou. 30. whereunto may be added the vncertaintie
  of the day of our death; Salomon saith, That they were things too
  wonderfull for him, and past his finding out.
            
            
               
                  Efferebatur. He was carryed out.
               The word Efferebatur is worthy our consideration, it
  being a plot and deuise of the diuell to carry the dead out of their Cities to
  bee buried,The remembrāce of death affoords two
 benefits. for to blot the memory of the dead out of the minds of the
  liuing. In the remembrance of death, the Saints of God found these two great
  benefits.
               The one, Amendment of life.
               The other, Happinesse in death.
               Touching the former, it is by one common consent agreed vpon by
  the Fathers, That the perfection of our life doth consist in the continuall
  meditation of death. Plato called Philosophie, Mortis
  meditationem, A meditation of death; affirming, That the whole lesson of
  our life, was to learne to dye. The like saith Gregory Nazianzene,
  Many Saints and Doctors haue demurr'd vpon this point, In that God should
  deferre till the day of iudgement the reward of the body, this may seeme an
  inequalitie to some, but there is none at all in it. For the dust and ashes of
  the body, doe perswade and preach vnto vs the contempt of the world.

  Captaine, this that vndoubted Souldier. There is nothing that doth so quel the
  courage of Man, and daunt his spirits, as death: it is natures terrour. Those
  Spies that were sent out to discouer the Land of Promise, were strucken into a
  great feare and amasement at the sight of those huge and monstrous Gyants,
  In comparison of whom (said they) we seemed as Grashoppers:
  Dreading, that they were able to deuoure them aliue, and to swallow them downe
  whole; And therefore made this false relation at their return,

                  The land through which we haue gone to search it, is a land that
  eateth vp the Inhabitants thereof; but the people that raised this euill
  reporr, died by a Plague. More truly may it be said of Death, That hee
  deuoureth the Inhabitants of the earth, this is he that tameth the fiercest
  Gyants.
               That dreame of Nabucadonezars, which might haue beene
  powerfull (receiuing it by reuelation) to make him abate his pride, and lay
  aside his arrogancie; the Deuill presently blotted these good thoughts out of
  his remembrance. The  like course doth the Deuil now take
  with vs. He doth not go about to persuade vs (as he did our father
  Adam) that we are immortall: But in two things he goes beyond vs, and
  is too cunning for vs.
               The one, That our death shall be delayed: God saith, Mors
  non tardat, Death lingers not. The Deuill sayes, Tardat, It lingers.
  Moram faciet, It loyters. My Lord will delay his comming, (said the
  seruant in the Gospell) But this feined supposition was his certaine
  perdition. Ezechiel did prophecie the ruine of Ierusalem, and the
  death and destruction of her Citisens, telling them their desolation was neere
  at hand, There shall none of my wordes be prolonged,
                  
                     Ezech. 12. but the word which I haue spoken shall
  be done, saith the Lord God. But the Deuill did otherwise persuade with them,
  making them to say, The vision that hee seeth is for many dayes to
  come, And hee prophecieth of the times that are farre off. The wanton
  woman in the Prouerbes, which inuited the yong man to her bed and boord,
  sought to intice him by this meanes, The good man is not at home, hee is
  gone a long journey;
                     Prou. 7. Therefore
  let vs take our fill of loue, &amp;c.
               From this vaine hope of life, ariseth, that our greedinesse and
  couetousnesse to inioy and possesse the goods of this life. And a little,
  beeing more than enough for him, yet it seemeth vnto man, much cannot suffice
  him. And it is an euill thought in man, and much to be pittied, that a man
  should afflict himselfe for that which neither hee himselfe nor all his
  posteritie shall liue to enioy. O foolish man, doost thou thinke thou shalt
  returne to liue againe in those goodly houses that thou hast built, and to
  reinioy those pleasant gardens, and orchards that thou hast planted? No, But
  mayst rather say to thy selfe, These my eyes shall neuer see them more. Why
  then so much carke and care, for three dayes, or thereabouts? The Romans would
  not build a temple to Death, nor to Pouertie, nor Hunger; judging them to bee
  inexorable gods; But more inexorable is Death, for man neuer returnes againe
  from Death to Life. And therefore the Antients painted Death with the Tallons
  of a Griffine. Saint Luke painting foorth the vigiles of the day of
  Iudgement, and the anguish and agonie of the World, he saith, That many shall
  waxe fearefull, and trouble their heads to see and thinke on those things,
  Which shall befall the whole World. Pondering in that place, that they
  shall not bee sensible of their owne proper danger, nor the aduenture wherin
  they stand of their saluation, or condemnation; &amp; yet cease not to afflict
  themselues with the losse of the World, and that the world shall be consumed
  and be no more. But ô thou foolish man, if thou must dye &amp; return
  thither no more, what is the world to thee? when thou art at an end, the World
  is ended with thee. And if thou beest not to inioy it any more, what is it to
  thee, if God doe vtterly destroy it?
               And all these euils arise from the forgetfulnesse of Death.We should set it alwaies before our eyes. Luk. 9.
  Hee liues secure from Danger, that thinkes vpon the preuenting of Danger. Saint
  Chrysostome expounding that place of Saint Luke, He that will
  follow me must take vp his Crosse dayly, and so come after mee; Signifying
  that what our Sauiour pretended, was, That we should alwayes haue our death
  before our eyes.1. Cor. 1

  Iulian the Emperour dying of a mortall wound, gaue thankes vnto the

  prolix and tedious sickenesse, but by a hastie and speedie death. And for that
  they doe not beleeue the immortalitie of the soule, they hold a sudden death a
  kind of happinesse: but a Christian, who confesseth that there is a iudgement
  after death, desireth a more lingring and leisurely kind of dying, for to

                  The onely sonne of his mother. In the order of
  conueniencie, it seemeth fitter that the old mother should haue died, than the
  young sonne. But as there is nothing more certaine than death, so is there
  nothing more vncertaine than the time of our death; the young Bird as soone
  falls into the snare as the old one; and your greater Fish as soone taken with
  the hooke as your lesser Frie.

  prepare for him the instruments of death, and ordaine his Arrowes against them.

                  The onely sonne of his mother. Not that he
  was her onely sonne, but her best beloued sonne. Salomon stiles
  himselfe, Vnigenitum matris suae, His mothers onely begotten sonne;
  not that he was the onely sonne of Bershabe, as it appeareth in the
  first of Chronicles; but because he was so deerely beloued of his
  mother, as if he had beene her only sonne: he was his mothers darling, her best
  beloued, the light of her eyes, and her hearts comfort, she cherished him, made
  much of him, would not let him want any thing; yet all this care and prouidence
  of hers could not shield him from death. There is a man in the Citie that is of
  a strong and able bodie, and abounding in all worldly happinesse; There is
  another (saith Iob) that is weake, hungerstarued, and his wealth
  wasted and consumed; both these death sets vpon, and layes them in the graue.
  He exemplifies in the King and the Gyant; for the rest, he makes no more
  reckoning of them than of so manie little Birds, whom the least fillip
  striketh dead: but he sets vpon a King like a Lyon; a poore man hath many
  meanes to hasten his death, but Kings seldome die of hunger, of penurie, of
  heats, or of colds, &amp;c. And a Gyant seemes to be a perdurable and immortall
  Tower of flesh; but in the end, both Kings and Gyants fall by the hand of
  Death. And since that Death did dare to set vpon the Sonne of God, and his
  blessed mother, let neither High nor Low, Rich nor Poore, hope to find any
  fauour at Deaths hands. Ioshuah did stop the Sunne in his course,
  Moses the waters of the red Sea, Ioseph did prophecie of
  things to come, and many of Gods Saints wrought great Myracles: but there is no
  myracle to be wrought against Death.

  That man was neuer yet borne, nor shall be hereafter, that shal not see death,
  or escape this heauie iudgement. Salomon commanded the child to be
  diuided in the middle, about whom the two mothers did contend; and that
  sentence which he did not then execute, shall bee executed vpon all liuing
  flesh: for all men beeing in regard of the bodie sonnes of the Earth, and in
  regard of the soule the children of Heauen, euerie one receiues this sentence
  from the Iudge at his death, Let the earth returne to the earth from whence
  it came, and the Spirit to God who gaue it life.
               
               
                  She was a Widow woman. The word Erat, She was,
  carrieth with it a kind of emphasis; she was a sorrowfull and forelorne Widow.
  A Widow ought to bee a rule and patterne of perfection to all other women, shee
  should bee the glasse wherein they should see their faults, and what is amisse
  in them: In a word, shee was a woman irreprehensible, and without blame. Nor
  (according to Saint Paul) hath the Virgin or the Wife that tie and
  obligation vpon them as shee hath: The one, because her small experience in the
  deceits and vanities of the world, may excuse her in many things; the other the
  charge and care that necessarily attends Wedlocke. When Absalon
  entred into the wiues and Concubines of his father, the King gaue command they
  should bee shut vp like so many Recluses, because they had opened the doore
  vnto him, as if the King had beene dead. And Widowes are to liue so seperated
  and seuered from the world, as if they liued not in it. Isiodore
  expoundeth the Spanish word Viuda, which signifies a Widow, to be
  qua

  her husband as the Vine from the Elme, which was it's prop and stay, which
  being taken away, the Vine lieth leuell with the ground, and without any
  comfort. The Hebrew deriueth the name of Widow from a certain word which
  signifieth both bound &amp; dumbe; now to be bound and dumbe, are the
  conditions and properties of him that is dead, who is neither able to mooue nor
  speake: So that the vulgar Translation calls a Widow Sterilem, barren
  and vnfruitfull, as it is in Iob and in Esay. Another letter
  stiles her Eradicatam,

  waxe greene againe. The smell of thy garments is like the smell of
  Frankincense; They must not smell of Amber, nor of Ciuet, but of
  Frankinsense, which they offer vp in Incense: for a widdow ought to lead the
  remnant of her dayes so neere vnto her husbands Tombe, that her garments should
  sauour of that incensorie perfume. Of such Widowes as these God hath that
  especiall care, that none shall doe them any wrong; for the teares that drop
  downe from their cheekes ascend as high as Heauen. And as the vapours that are
  exhaled from the earth, come downe againe in lightning and thunder and terrible
  tempests; so prooue the Widowes teares to those that shall vniustly cause them
  to weep, and draw those watred drops from their eyes. Heliodorus
  pretended to rob the Temple of Ierusalem, and to take away the portions that
  were deposited for the maintenance of Widowes, who wept most bitterly: this
  generall lamentation made way to Gods Tribunall; hee sent downe one on a goodly
  faire horse armed at all points, who ouerthrew Heliodorus vpon the
  pauement, and presently two young men fell vpon him, and whipt him with
  scourges till they left him as it were for dead. For this cause did God comfort
  this Widow at the gates of the Citie, where the Iudges had their Tribunalls,
  notifying vnto them, that they should take Widowes into their tutelage &amp;
  protection; and the rather, for that a supremer Iudge, the Iudge both of
  Heauen and Earth, was willing to take so much the more care of them, by how the
  more was their solitude and priuate course of life. Saint Hierome
  writing to Furia 
                   and Eustochius,
  vttereth excellent things of those that are true Widows indeed, and of those
  that are Widowes but in jeast and sport. Of the former, Iudith and
  Anna, Samuels mother, were notable examples: And amongst the Gentiles,
  Artemisia Queene of Caria, who not desirous to bu
                     •
                  ie her husband in Vrnes of siluer or
  gold, buried him in her owne bowells by drinking downe his ashes: in
  contemplation whereof, there is a verie medicinable herbe called after her
  name, Artemisia; which all Widowes in stead of other hearbes or flowers, ought
  to haue lying by them vpon their Estrado's, their beds, and their
  chamber windowes. Of those other fabulous widowes, Alcione may serue
  as an example, who tooke on so extreamely for the death of her husband, that
  the gods were faine to comfort her; and when they had giuen her comfort, she
  was metamorphised at last into a Bird bearing the same name: of which Saint
  Ambrose sayth, That it liues about riuers of waters, the feathers
  thereof being greene, and the beake red, in token that those Widowes that so
  quickely receiue comfort, their life is commonly greene and youthfull, and
  their words red and full of amorous passions, lanching themselues forth like
  Ships, into a sea of vices and voluptuous pleasures, turning their vails to
  sailes, which faile with euerie wind.
               
                  Christ taking pittie of her, &amp;c. It is not here
  said, That he pittied the son, but the mother; for they that die are not so
  much to be pittied as they that liue: for if he that dies goe to Hell, we wrong
  Gods justice if we take any commiseration of them; and if they goe to Heauen,
  their happinesse doth not require it, hauing more reason to enuie than pittie
  them. Lots wife was turned into a piller of salt, because she sorrowed
  for the burning of Sodome: and in Heauen, as there can be no miserie, so is it
  impossible that there should be any commiseration; so that pittie is onely to
  bee reduced to those that liue. The Scripture calleth death, Rest and Sleepe.

  Mans life is a warfare vpon earth, and his dayes like the dayes of an

  man for death, Gaudent vehementer cum inuenerint mortem. Great was
  mans misfortune, that he was to enter into a sea so full of miseries. But (as

  wayes; which is all one as if he should haue said vnto him, It is I that
  am thus scortched and scourged, and therefore Vade, hast thee to
  Pharaoh. But some will obiect, If God be so hastie to helpe his
  People, why did he suffer  them to be imbroiled 40 yeres
  before they could cast out the Ammorits &amp; the Iebusites, especially it
  beeing the Land which hee had promised vnto them? Whereunto himselfe giues this
  resolution, Their sinnes were not yet growne vp to their heigth. So
  that his leading them all this while through the Wildernesse, was a lesse
  miserie than their remaining in Aegypt; and therefore he dismisseth
  Moses with a Vade, giuing him full power and Commission to
  free his People; willing him to hasten away, that they might be eased of their
  torment, as if himselfe had felt the smart thereof more than they. Hee could
  not indure that his friends should suffer affliction; and because he had said,
  Cum ipso sum in tribulatione, he would not be taxed of the breach of
  his word. So that when God is with thee in thy tribulation, he will giue an
  issue to thine afflictions, because hee suffers in them as well as thy selfe;
  and if he doe not come in to helpe thee, it is because thy sinnes haue made him
  vnsencible thereof. But doe thou mouere à peccato, and thou
  shalt find him (as it is here in my Text) miseri

                  He said vnto her, Weepe not. It caused much admiration,
  &amp; seemed somwhat strange to those that were there present, that our Sauiour
  seeing the teares and anguish of this sorrowfull and wretched widow, should
  vpon so sad an occasion say vnto her, Noli flere, Weepe not.
               
               We know that there are diuers and sundrie sorts of teares.
               Some are occasioned by the excessiue sorrow and griefe of our
  owne sinnes; of this nature were those teares of Marie Magdalen, of
  Dauid, and of Peter.
               
               Others are drawne from vs vpon a fellow-feeling and
  sorrowfulnesse for other mens faults: of this kind were those of Saint
  Paul,
                  2. Cor. 2. 
                  Out of much
  affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote vnto you with many teares, so
  much was he grieued with the newes he receiued from them of that incestuous
  person, and the punishment of Excommunication inflicted vpon him. And to the
  Philippians,
                     Philip.
                     
                        •
                     . 
                  I haue told you
  often, and now tell you euen weeping, that they are the enemies of the Crosse
  of Christ. And those teares likewise which those men shed who did bewaile
  the miseries of Ierusalem,
                     Ezech. 9. whose
  foreheads God commanded to be marked with the letter Tau.
               
               Others are shed by vs meerely out of compassion for other folks
  misfortunes; and such as these were the teares of our Sauiour Christ, He
  beheld the Citie, and wept ouer it. So likewise at Lazarus death,
  Iesus wept;
                  
                     Iohn 11.35. 
                  Did not
  I weepe for him that was in trouble? Was not my soule grieued for the
  Poore? And Ieremie did neuer make an end of weeping for the miseries
  of his people.
               Others, the deuout meditation of Christs bitter torments extort
  from vs, According as it was prophecied by Zach. They shall looke on me
  whom they haue pierced,
                  
                     Zach. 1

                  and they shall mourne
  for him as one mourneth for his onely sonne, and shall be in bitternesse for
  him, as one that is in bitternesse for his first borne.
               
               Others gutter downe from vs out of a vehement and earnest desire
  wee haue to our celestiall Countrie, and to the enioying of that our heauenly
  habitation. Of this qualitie were those of Dauid, Woe is mee, that the time
  of my pilgrimage is prolonged. And in another place, My teares were my
  bread euen day and night.
               
               And all these seuerall sorts of teares spring from the Fountaine
  of Grace, and are comprehended vnder the stile of blessednesse, Beati qui
  lugent, Blessed are they that weepe, &amp;c.
               
               There is another sort of teares which flow from naturall pittie
  and conceiued griefe, for the death of our parents, children, kinsfolkes, and
  friends; as also for losse of wealth, honour, health, and the like; and when
  the Scripture mentions them, it doth not reprehend them. The Shunamite bewailed
  her dead sonne; Marie Magdalen, the losse of her brother
  Lazarus; and humane Histories recommend  these
  teares of pitty vnto vs: Alexander wept when he met with a troup of
  poore miserable Greekes that were all totterd and torne; and they who vpon such
  sad and miserable spectacles are not tender eyed, and hearted, are cruel
  creatures. Viscera

               Now these teares may offend two manner of wayes:
               First, In their excesse; for God will not haue vs to bewaile
  that thing much, which in it selfe is little. Saint Augustine hath
  obserued, That after Iacob began to mourne for the losse of
  Ioseph, and the bereauing him of Beniamin, which mourning of
  his continued almost the space of twentie yeares; God withdrew those
  Regalos and fauours from him which hee was wont to conferre vpon him:
  before, the Angells ascended and descended the ladder; before, the Angell gaue
  him strength to wrestle all night long, &amp;c. before, he inioyed prosperitie,
  wiues, children, and victorie against Esau: but afterwards, the more
  teares, the more sorrow fell vpon him; for God neuer grants to the teares of
  the earth, the comforts of Heauen. And although he permit a mannerly and
  moderate kind of naturall pittie,
                     Eccl. 22.
 Eccl. 38. according to that of Ecclesiasticus, Super
  mortuum modicum pl
                        •
                     ra: And in
  another place, Quasi dira passus, incipe plorare, My sonne, let teares
  fall downe ouer the Dead, and begin to lament, as if thou hadst suffered great
  harme thy selfe. Such few drops he fauoureth and cherisheth, but if they be
  excessiue, or ouermuch, he condemneth them as vnlawfull, and as a wrong done
  vnto God. For the losing of God, or the losse of his loue, thou mayst well
  weepe World without end, because it is an incomparable losse; but for the
  outward losses of this World; Incipe plorare, Begin thou to weepe, but
  quickly make an end.
               The second offence is, That a man hauing cause enough to bewaile
  his owne sinnes, the losse of his Soule, and of God; doth notwithstanding
  lament these earthly &amp; transitorie losses, neglecting the former. This
  disorder Christ sought to rectifie and amend in those tender-hearted women of
  Ierusalem, who wept so bitterly to see how ill hee was vsed by the Iews, and
  how heauie the burthen of his Crosse lay vpon him. Daughters of Ierusalem,
  weepe not for mee, but weepe for your selues, &amp;c.
               
               
                  He went and touched the coffin. The first place is
  taken vp here by his mercie, which is the wel-head of al those blessings which
  we receiue from his bountiful hand.Gods mercie the Spring
 from whence all his blessings flow. His Prouidence doth conserue vs;
  his wisedom protect vs &amp; gouern vs; his Goodnesse, sustaines vs; his
  Liberalitie, inricheth vs; his Grace, healeth vs: And all this flowe
                     •
                  h from the fountaine of his Mercie. The
  antients stiled Iupiter, Optimus maximus; Because (as Cicero
  notes it) the attribute of Beneficence is more gratefull and acceptable in God,
  than his Greatnesse and Power.
               In the second place, came in his words of comfort, Noli

               In the third, his hands, Tetigit loculum. Heere hee
  exerciseth his hands, his tongue, and his heart. If we cannot imitate the hands
  of our Sauiour Christ in doing good; yet at least imitate his heart, and his
  tongue. For Pittie and words cost nothing, and are wanting to few.

  graue, are first of all a stampe or token of the goods of this life, which
  carrie vs step by step from our honors, riches, delights, and pastimes, to the
  house of eternall lamentation and mourning.
               Secondly, they are a stamp or token of il &amp; lewd companie,
  which say to an vnexperienced  &amp; ignorant yongman,
  Come along with vs, and let vs lay wait for blood. They are like those
  highway robbers which persuade men to rob, &amp; kill, saying, We wil make our
  selues rich, &amp;c. Or like those carnall men which crie vnto vs, Come,
  let vs take our pleasure. Of this People the Prophet Esay
  complained, saying, This is a People robbed &amp; spoyled, they are all of them
  snared in holes, they are hid in prison houses, they are for a prey, &amp; none
  deliuereth, for a spoyle, &amp; none saith, Restore. The Deuill and his
  Ministers lead your wilfull young men away captiue, clap them into Hels
  Dungeon, and there is none that deliuereth them, or to say so much as, Alas
  poore man, whither wilt thou run on to thy destruction?
               
                  Young man, I say vnto thee, Arise. He called him by the
  name of his age or youth, because that had brought him to his graue; for it is
  sinne that sises out our lif
                     •
                  , and
  cuts it short. Youth is a kind of broken Ship which leaks &amp; draws in water
  at a thousand places, so that of force it must quickely sinke. El

                        •
                     ius, &amp; vita inter

  Tempest at sea, and Youth, that is tossed too &amp; fro with it's vnruly
  appetites, is al one. Et vita inter Effoeminatos: Another Letter hath
  it, Scortatores. The connexion is good, for Youth runnes it selfe
  quickely vpon the Rockes of death,
                     Prou 31.
  through it's sensualities and lewdnesse of life. There are two daughters of
  the Horseleech, which still crie, Giue, giue: And the Wiseman pointing
  them forth vnto vs, saith, The one is, Infernus; The other, Os
  Vuluae: The Graue the one; and Lust the other. And the Wiseman did linke
  these two together with a great deale of conueniencie and fittingnesse; for if
  Lust bee neuer satisfied, the Graue lesse.
               This truth is likewise made good, forasmuch as the Scripture
  stileth Sinne,Sin is death it selfe. Death, If I
  doe this I must die the death; So said Susanna to the Iudges that
  made vnlawfull and dishonest loue vnto her. And Cain seeing himselfe
  charged with fratricide, at that verie instant he gaue himselfe for a dead man,
  Whosoeuer shall meet me, will kill me. Youth then beeing a house
  whereinto the raine doth drip so fast, and at so many places, it is no
  meruaile, that life should cease and soone decay. It is prouerbially said,
  Loue is as strong as Death:The character of a yong
 man And as Loue doth vsually set vpon Youngmen, so doth Death; and where
  Loue striketh Youth, Death may spare his Dart. The Antients painted a Youngman

  behind him, and his left, left at libertie, and Time followi

  little secrecie hee had vsed his delights and pleasures; with his right hand
  bound behind him, to expresse that he did not doe any thing aright; his left
  free and at libertie, signifying that he did all things aukwardly and
  vntowardly; he was portrayed blind, because he doth not see his owne follies;
  but Time goes opening his eyes by little and little, &amp; day by day brings
  him to the true knowledge of his errors.
               
                  And he that was dead sate vp and began to speake. The
  Dead presently obeyed the voyce of the Liuing. And hee sate vp. God
  cryeth out aloud to those that are dead in their Soules, yet doe they not obey
  his voyce; Arise thou that sleepest, &amp;c. Hee began to giue thankes
  vnto him that had done him this so great a fauour; Thou hast deliuered mee,

  Chrysostomes note, That the word Doores is put here in the plurall
  number, because many are the dangers  out of which God
  deliuereth a sinner, That all may speake of thy praise, and talke of thy
  wondrous workes.
               
               
                  And there came a feare vpon all. It may seeme to some,
  That the word Loue would better haue become this place, and beene fitter for
  this present purpose and occasion: All (a man would thinke) should rather haue
  expressed their loues vnto him, sung forth his prayses, and offered their
  seruice vnto him. In those former punishments of a World drowned and
  ouerwhelmed with Water, of a Sodome burned and consumed with Fire, it was verie
  fit and meet that it should strike feare and amasement into all: But in such a
  case as this, What should cause them to feare? Hereunto I answer, That nothing
  doth strike such a feare and terrour into man, as the great and wonderfull
  mercies of God. A Roman Souldier told Iulius Caesar, It much troubles
  me, nor can I be heart-merrie, as oft as I thinke on the many fauours that I
  haue receiued from thy liberall hand; but doe rather hold them as so many
  wrongs and iniuries done vnto me; for they are so beyond all requitall, that I
  must of force proue vngratefull, which makes me to feare, that thou wilt
  proceed against me for a heinous offendor in this kind. In like manner, so many
  are the mercies of God towards man, and so infinite, that they may be held as
  Vigiles of his future seuerer Iustice. Iacob did in a manner vtter
  the same sentence against himselfe, Minor sum cunctis miserationibus
  tuis, The least of thy mercies is greater than all my merits; nor can the
  best seruices that I can doe thee, make satisfaction for the least of those
  fauours which I haue receiued from thy bounteous liberalitie. Grant, ô
  Lord, that what is wanting in our owne worthinesse, may bee made vp in the
  mercies and merits of our Sauiour Iesus Christ; To whom, with the Father,

myracles, which of all other did most predicate and blazon forth Christs
glorie. Saint Hierome preferres it before all the rest that he wrought
here vpon earth. By this prenda or pledge of his Diuinitie, Death
remained confounded, the Deuills affrighted, and the lockes and barres of Hell
broken. Genebrard, That it is the voice of a Crier which goes before a
Triumpher, who makes Death the triumphant Chariot of his Maiestie and glorie.
That a valiant Warriour should make a braue and gallant shew on horsebacke,
hauing his Courser adorned and set forth with curious and costly Caparisons, it
is not much; but to seeme handsome and comely in Deaths palenesse, weakenesse,
and foulenesse, beeing so ghastly a thing to looke on, God onely can doe this.

               Death is swallowed vp in victorie. He
that drinketh takes the cup in his hand, and doth therewith what it pleaseth
him: so did our Sauiour deale with Death, &amp; therfore he called it a cup,
drinking the same vp at one draught;Death is a large
  draught, but Christ swallowed it downe. wherein he dranke a health to
all Beleeuers. Saint Bernard vpon this occasion saith of him,
Mirabilis potator es tu, Thou art a strange kind of drinker: O Lord,
before thou tastedst of this cup, thou saidst, Transeat, Let it passe;
and after thou hadst dranke thereof, thou saidst, Sitio, I thirst. The
Flesh was afraid, but the Spirit got the victorie ouer Death, with that ease,
as a good Drinker doth of a good cup of drinke when he is verie thirstie. In a
word, Not onely because this was a myracle wrought vpon a dead person that had
lien foure dayes buried in his graue, but because the sacrilegious councell of
the Scribes and Pharisees had layd their heads together, and 
 plotted the death of our Sauiour Christ; as also in
regard of those other circumstances, That the deceased partie was nobly borne,
and that many of good Q
                  •
               alitie
came to visit him in his sickenesse, and did weepe and bewaile his death, did
our Sauiour performe this myracle. Amongst all those myracles which our Saour
Christ wrought, Saint Augustine giues to this the first and prime
place: and indeed it seemes to be an epitome and short summe of all those other
myracles that he wrought in the whole course of his life; for in the
resurrection of one that is dead, there is giuen sight to the Blind, eares to
the Deafe, a tongue to the Dumbe, feet to the Lame, motion to the Paraliticke,
&amp;c. And therefore Saint Iohn with this myracle doth (as it were)
shut vp and giue a close to the proouing of his Diuinitie.
            
               A certaine man was sicke named Lazarus, &amp;c. Therefore his
Sisters sent vnto him. Here we may consider the good aduisement and
discretion of this noble paire of Sisters. When Marie Magdalen treated
of the reparation of her own soule, she went her selfe in person, passing
through a world of inconueniences; but for the restoration of her brother to
his bodily health, she thought it would be sufficient and serue the turne well
enough, to send her Seruant with a letter to our Sauiour. The Worldling for the
health of his bodie will round the world; but will not stirre a foot for his
soules health: For to esteeme of things as they are, and to giue them their
true weight, and to put euerie thing in it's proper place, is not onely the
marke of a prudent, but of a predestinated person. Aegypt taxed Moses
of ingratitude (as Phylon hath noted) in his life, for that hee did
forgoe Pharaohs Pallace, refused to be called the sonne of
Pharaohs daughter, and chose rather to suffer aduersitie with the
People of God, those poore Israelites, than to weare the Crowne of Aegypt, and
to enioy the pleasures of the Court; esteeming (as Saint Paul saith)
the rebuke of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Aegypt. But first of
all, he was not vngratefull; for concerning those good blessings which he
enioyed, he was more bound to God for them, than to the King. Secondly, he
shewed he was no foole in doing as he did; for better is one crumme of bread in
the Lords house, than all the prosperitie of the world without it; Than to
enioy (to vse Saint Pauls words) the pleasures of sinne for a
season. I had rather be a Doore-keeper (saith Dauid) in the
house of the Lord, than to dwell in Tabernacles of sinners. Nazianzen
reporteth, That the Emperour Valens offering Saint Basil his

That he should highly esteem of the Emperours fauour and friendship, but hee
was to esteeme more of Gods. Saint Augustine saith, That Adam
did eat of the Apple, Ne contristaret delitias, &amp;c. least he
should grieue his Loue; not led along with carnall concupiscence, but with a
friendly affection. Suting with that of Saint Paul, That Adam
was not deceiued, but the woman was deceiued: but it had beene better for
Adam to haue displeas

               for he is a god that either talketh, or
pursueth his enemies, or is in his journey, or it may be that he sleepeth, and
must be awaked, &amp;c. Our Sauior Christ aduising vs how we ought to
pray, saith, When yee pray, vse no vaine repetitions as the
Heathen;
               
                  Mat. 6.7. God regards not the length
  of our praiers, but their strength. 
               for they thinke to bee heard for
their much babling. It is now the fashion of the World, to amplifie
reasons, and to inlarge it's discourses with the ornaments of Eloquence, the
floures of Rhetoricke, choice Phrases, and a great deale of artifice and
cunning; but that of Heauen consists of few words, but is full of spirit and
deuotion: one single Pa

                  er
noster vttred with feruour, is of more force, than many vosario's
without it. When a Vessell sounds, it is a signe it is emptie. Moses
treating with God, sayd, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither at any time
haue beene,
               
                  Exod. 4. 
               &amp;c. but I
am slow of speech, and slow of tongue. Moses was herin mistaken; for I
would haue thee to know, that a talking tongue and a dumbe heart doe not sute
wel together. Diuine Bernard askes the question, Why God in the Lords
Prayer did put this word Qui est in Coelis, Which art in Heauen, being
that he is present euerie where, and in all places? And his answer is, That his
desire was, that our prayers should proceed with that feruencie and forcible
ejaculations, as if God could not heare vs vnlesse by our prayers we pierced
Heauen. As for our harpes,
               
                  Psal.
  137. 
               we hanged them vp vpon the Willoughes. Ruffinus saith,
That your Willoughes are but barren Trees, and without fruit; and when Prayer
proceeds from a drie heart, and a barren and vnfruitfull soule, it is like the
Harpe there spoken of, that hangs vpon the Willoughes by the waters of
Babylon. In a word, your Laconicall kind of Language, that which is short
&amp; full, Nazianzen saith, That it is The vttering of much
matter in a few words; and the fewer the words are, the greater are the
voyces of our desires. When the Deuill left Iobs lips onely free from
byles and sores, he did not doe it out of any pittie towards him, but out of a
desire that hee had to draw some word of impatience or blasphemie from them:
but he was both deceiued and ashamed, when he saw that he imployed them in
these only foure praise-worthie words, Sit nomen Domini benedictum, Blessed
be the name of the Lord. And say the Deuill should haue bereaued him of
the vse of his lips, and that he should not haue beene able to haue vttered a
word, yet his desires would haue spoken their mind in a loud voyce. Cum
inuocarem, exa
                     •
                  diuit me Deus
justiciae mea: He calls him, Deum justiciae meae, The God of my
righteousnesse, not, The God of my Prayer: And why so? The reason is,Workes out-speake Words Because Workes out-speake Words.
Saint Iohn saith, That hee saw vnder the Alter the soules of the
Martyrs, Crying with a loud voyce, How long Lord? &amp;c. But if
these soules were seuered from their bodies, how could they crie? Saint
Gregorie resolues it thus, That their desires did crie out aloud.
Moses did not vnfold his lips, nor once open his mouth, and yet God
said vnto him, Why doost thou

                     〈◊〉
                   vnto me? onely because
his desires did set out a throat. So Abels bloud was said to crie out
against Cain. So that with God a few words will suffice. Besides, your
better sort of women ought to be verie sparing of their words, Auaritia in

bloud, prosperitie, and other good gifts; but wisedome and silence God giues:

lauish of her tongue, but of few words, and those too vpon fit occasion.
            The second consideration in this their discretion, was, That they
called him Lord, Domine, &amp;c. Your greatest Kings and most
powerfull Princes vpon earth, haue no dominion or empire ouer the soule,
neither are they able to adde or take away one dramme of the spirit.3
  Reg. 1

                  . But thou,
ô Lord, Thou art the vniuersall Lord both of Heauen and Earth, and we are
thy handmaides and seruants; and therefore thou canst not denie vs thy fauour.
Saint Ambrose, expounding those wordes of Dauid, Seruus tuus sum
ego, I am thy seruant, saith, That they who haue many Lords and Masters
here vpon earth, cannot cleaue vnto God; Seru

ego, serui dominati sunt nostri: Those creatures which God hath giuen vs
to be our slaues, flesh, the dainties, the delicacies, the delights, &amp;
pleasant pastimes of this world, shall haue dominion ouer them.
            The third, Quem amas, He whom thou louest. Amatus, or
beloued, is a more honourable name than that of Angell,Beloued, a name of great preheminence. Apostle, Martyr,
Confessor, or Virgine: Lucifer, was an Angell; Iudas, an
Apostle: The Heretick will not sticke to say, that hee dyes for Christs cause,
and that he is a Martyr and a Confessor: your Vestalles, stiled themselues
Virgines; yet all these names, haue beene lyable to sinne, to misfortune, and
Hell. But the name of Beloued, is not compatibl
                  •
                in that kind, And Christ hath got the start of Man in his loue,
For hee loued vs first, And where he once loues he neuer leaues
off.
            Besides, Two things I would haue you to note, which are vsuall
with the Saints and children of God.
            The one, to set before their eyes the fauours they haue receiued,
to alledge them, to shew themselues thankefull for them, and to praise and
commend them.
            
               Gods fauours seldome come single.The
other, Not to shew themselues forgetful of their seruices towards God; Knowing
that it is Gods condition and qualitie, when he bestoweth one fauour, to ingage
himselfe for a greater. Ezechias alledged vnto God his holinesse and
goodnesse of life:4. Reg. 20.3. O Lord,
remember now how I haue walked before theein truth and with a perfect heart,
and haue done that which is good 
                     •
                  n
thy sight. Saint Gregorie presseth hereupon; Were it not better
to alledge thy miserie, than to represent those many good things which thou
hast done, all which thou hast receiued from his hand? But with God, to alledge
them, and to shew our selues thankefull for former receiued fauors, is a
powerfull meanes for the receiuing of far greater benefits and blessings from
him. After that Dauid had made a large muster of his tribulations, He
sayth, Conuersus, viuificasti me, &amp; de abissis terrae, iterum reduxisti
me, Thou hast quickned mee, and hast brought mee againe from out the deepes of
the Earth. Where I would haue you to ponder the word iterum; For
God neuer does one single fauour.
            
               The
  
                     •
                  ighteous euer mind full of Gods
  seruice, forgetful of their Mat. 25.Secondly, the righteous
are forgetfull of their owne seruices, for that they hold them so meane and so
vile, that they iudge them vnworthy Gods sight. And when in that generall
iudgement God shall say, I was naked and yee couered me, &amp;c. The
Saints shall answere, Lord when did we see thee naked, &amp;c. And it
is noted by Theodoret, that these are not words of courtesie, or out
of mannerlines, but of meere forgetfulnesse. For it is their fashion, so to
despise their owne seruices and deseruings, that they doe wholy forget
them.
            The fourth consideration of their discretion was, That so
especiall is the fauor  which God showes vnto his
friends; and the griefe which he conceiueth of any that shall befall them, that
they held it a greater point of Wisedome to alledge that hee was his friend,
than their brother. Saint Bernard sayth, That albeit the defect of my
seruices doe dishearten mee, yet Gods great mercies, and his many fauours doe
incourage mee: For it is not Gods fashion to forsake his friends.
            And therfore saith Saint Austen, Non enim amas &amp;
deseris. The Princes of the Earth are now and then well content, their
friends should suffer, because in them, Power and Loue is not equall: But those
in whom these attributes goe hand in hand, ought not to suffer their friends to
miscarrie. They would seeme here to put this vpon Christ, and to make this
cause his owne. O Lord, That wee should loose our brother, it is no great
losse, because in thee wee haue a brother: But thou (ô Lord) amongst so
many thy professed enemies, hast lost a great friend. It is the condition of
Gods Saints to greeue for the death of the Iust,Iniuries
  done to God, more greeuous to the righteous, than if done to themselues.
because God receiues a losse in them; and to resent their own proper iniuries,
not for that these iniuries are done to themselues, but for that they are
iniuries done vnto God. Tabescere me fecit zelus meus, quia obliti sunt
verba tua, inimici mei: Vpon which place, Genebrard giues this
exposition, That mine owne iniuries, doe not so much offend mee for that they
are mine, but because they are offences done vnto thee. And Dauid in
his thirtith Psalme treateth of some crosses and affliction, that God by
sickenesse had layd vpon him, after he had built his pallaces, Thou didst
hide thy face and I was troubled. I was loath to dye,
                  Psal. 39. not for mine owne sake, for it were
happinesse to me if I should dye to day or to morrow, but not for thee,
What profit is there in my bloud, when I go downe to the pit? What
seruice can Dauid do thee, when he is layd in his sepulchre? But
ô Lord, in his life, in his honor, in his crowne, and in his kingdome, he
may do thee good seruice: This, ô Lord, concernes thee, and must runne to
thy account. The like bold insinuation did Moses vse, when he said, O
Lord, pardon this people; lest the Aegyptians should say, Thou hadst plotted
this of purpose to lead them out into the Desert, and there to make an end of
them, hauing no bodie to helpe them. Tibi soli peccaui, &amp; malum coram
te feci, vt iustificeris in sermonibus tuis, &amp; vincas cum iudicaris;
Saint Augustine giues it this interpretation, Tibi soli peccaui,
viz. Tibi solum sum relictus. O Lord, this wound was only made for thee,
that thou alone mightst heale it; all other Physitions haue quite giuen me
ouer, there is not any one vpon earth that knowes how to cure mee, and
therefore I lay the same open onely to thee, Vt iustificeris. Thou
hast ordained a Law, That at what time soeuer a Sinner shall repent him of his
sinne, and turne vnto thee, thou wilt blot out his offences: O Lord, I am
sorrie I haue offended thee, I confesse my fault, and acknowledge my sinne
before thee, and therefore it must be put to thy account, to pardon me;
otherwise it wil be said of thee, That thou doost not comply with thy
promise.
            Secondly, These two sisters did pretend to strengthen this our
Sauiours loue to their brother.No loue where no
  releefe. For it doth not stand with the rules of friendship that a man
should loue, and not releeue the necessities of him he loueth. One telling
Theophrastus, That two such were very great friends, &amp; that the
one was very rich, and the other very poore; He returned him this answere, It
cannot bee, beeing they be friends. This very argument did these sisters vrge
our Sauiour Christ withall: Lazarus beeing thy friend, and thou being
life it selfe, why hast thou suffered Death to lay hold vpon him? Againe,
There is no force that is able to resist Death, but Loue, Loue is as strong
as Death. Death hath been so audacious as to  enter
within our doores; let Loue reuenge vs of this his presumption. The Athenians
placed Loues Statua betwixt Mercurie and Hercules, the one
the god of Eloquence, the other of Fortitude. To shew that Loue doth not
consist so much in wordes, as in workes. Thou hast vouchsafed, ô Lord, to
honour our brother with the name of friend, now manifest the same by thy strong
arme, and thy powerfull hand.
            The fifth, was their hauing recourse vnto him, that had caused
this wound and was onely able to cure it. First, for that God is highly
offended that we should haue recourse to any but himselfe. Secondly, Because no
Phisition, nor earthly phisick can minister health without the will and
pleasure of our heauenly Phisition, He woundeth, and he maketh whole.
The former is notified vnto vs in Ah
                     •
                  ziah, who finding himselfe sore sicke of a fall through the
Lattice window of his vpper chamber: sent (fearing he should die of that
bruise) to consult with Baalzebub the god of Ekron. Which Messengers
Elias meeting withall, said vnto them; What is there no God in
Israel that yee goe to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Eckron?
               4. Reg. 1. deliuer therfore this message from God
vnto your king, Thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art
gone vp,
               
                  Osee 4.12. 
               but shalt die
the death. Hosea doth likewise complaine, That his People had recourse in
their doubts vnto Idolls, My People aske councell at their stockes.
Lyrae renders it, In simulachro ligni. This my People is so
foolish, that they goe to aske councell of a piece of wood. The seuentie
Interpreters turne it thus, In virgis suis: Whereupon
Rupertus hath obserued, That this was a kind of superstition which
cloue vnto them from the Chaldeans, from whom they had receiued this infection;
for it was a fashion amongst them, when they would know what should befall
them, to throw vp a couple of stickes as high as they could fling them; or two
arrows tied together, and marking the one for good lucke, and the other for
bad, they mumbled I know not what words, and that which in the falling fell
vppermost, did prognosticate the successe.
                  Ezech.
  21.21. 
               Ezechiel reporteth, That the King of Babylon comming
with a great armie, doubting with himselfe, whither he should goe against Rahab
or Ierusalem, comming where there were two wayes to take, vsed this
superstition of the two Arrowes, Quaerens diuinationem. The King of
Babell stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two wayes,
consulting by diuination, and made his Arrowes bright, &amp;c. and the lot
lighted against Ierusalem. This difference there is betwixt him that is a Saint
of God, and him that is not; that he in his griefes hath recourse first vnto
God, and next to humane remedies; wheras the other hath first recourse vnto
Physitions: &amp; when they notifie to the former, the danger wherein he is, he
falls to a confession of his sins, a heartie repentance, and to the receiuing
of the blessed Sacrament. The Antients did picture Health in the forme of a
handsome faire Damosell sitting in a Royall Throne; for without health there is
no pleasure in royall Thrones, in Scepters, nor in Crownes: for the better
conseruation whereof, we are to vse temperance in our dyet. The Serpent is the
Symbole of Prudence, without which it is impossible to preserue our health.
The foolish and vndiscreet man, that makes no reckoning of the falling of your
Sereno's, or euening dewes, oftentimes blasting those that are in
them; as in Spaine, and the like hot Countries; of your Sunnes heats, and your
Snowes colds, your foule and pockie Whores, loose oftentimes their healths, if
not their liues. But aboue all, we must haue recourse vnto God, for God is all
in all; and without God, little importeth temperance, prudence, Physitions, or
Physicke.
            The sixt consideration of their discretion, was, That they did
propose their  miserie, but not prescribe the remedie;
for it is sufficient, that we propound our necessitie vnto God. Saint
Augustine saith▪ 
               Amanti, sat est nunciasse, It is enough
for him that loues, to intimate his mind. And Saint Bernard, Sic melius
tanquam non orantes, oramus; tanquam diffidentes; confidimus, &amp;c. A
modest kind of demanding, and a diffident seeming confidence, doth oftentimes
further a suit, and promote the thing we pretend. Ezechias being
threatned by Zenacharib,
               4. Reg. 19.
did before God vnfold his menacing letter; O Lord, (sayd hee) thou maist read
in these lines the pride and arrogancie of this blaspheming King. Saint
Peter when his soule melted into teares, did not tell God what he
pretended by them; Which caused Saint Bernard to say, Lachrimas
Petri video, precem non audio, I see Peters teares, but heare not his
prayer. The blessed Virgin sayd no more than this, Vinum non habent,
They haue no wine. And therefore,
                  Psal.
  37.5. 
               Commit thy way vnto the Lord, and trust in him, and he shall
bring it to passe, &amp;c. The Sisters good will was well knowne to our
Sauiour, but they did not publish the same: for the Iust neuer ties himselfe
to his owne will, Not my will, but thy will,

                     •
                   Lord, be done;His will must be ours. It was our Sauiours saying to his
Father, when praying in the Garden, he besought him, Let this Cup passe
from me. And in another place, I descended downe from heauen not to
doe myne owne will, but the will of my Father that sent me. Anselmus
saith, That a soueraigne will in man, and which doth not submit it selfe vnto
Gods will, is the will of Worldlings, and sauouring too much of the earth; and
this superioritie would (if it knew how) rob God of his priuiledges, as proud
Lucifer endeauoured to doe. And in another place, he tearmes a mans
owne proper will, Pestem &amp; lepram mundi, The plague and leaprosie of
the world; and that God doth punish nothing more vpon earth; and that
there had neuer beene any Hell,The peruersenesse of mans
  will. had it not beene propter propriam voluntatem, for this
selfe-will of ours. Saint Bernard saith, That it conuerteth good
into ill, and that it loseth the reward of Fasting, whereby Heauen might be
gained: Alledging that of Esay, Behold,
               
                  Esay 58.3. 
               in the day of your fast you will
seeke your will. Cassianus reporteth of a holy Hermit, That a friend of
his at the houre of his death asking his aduise, How he might be saued?
Answered, That he was neuer wedded to his owne proper will. Taulerius
reporteth of a certaine Diuine, That he did oftentimes desire of God, That he
would direct him to a Master that might teach him the way of his saluation; and
that at last he met with a poore man that was all ragged and torne: God giue
you the good day, said he vnto him: To whom the other replied, I neuer had bad
one yet: What meanest thou by that, quoth he? He told him, I did euer place my
happinesse and content in submitting my wil to Gods wil; and because his will
diuides it selfe into good and euill, contenting my selfe with his good will
and pleasure, I haue alwayes led a contented life. But what (said he) wouldest
thou doe, if God should cast thee into Hell? He answered, My Soule hath two
armes; the one of Humilitie, the other of Charitie: with the one I would obey;
with the other I would take hold on God himselfe, and would force him to
descend downe with me into Hell; and hauing him along with me, I should enioy
all happinesse and content. Leo the Pope saith, That the dispossession
of our owne proper will, Omnes fid
                     •
                  les instruxit, omnes Confessores incendit, omnes Martyres
coronauit; Instructed all the Faithfull, inflamed all the Confessors, and
crowned all the Martyrs.
            
            
               Ecce, quem amas infirmatur.
               
                  Behold, He whom thou louest is sicke. This
  Ecce implies matter of admiration; Behold, one that is beloued of God,
  and that is sicke. The Angell said vnto Gideon,  The
  Lord is with thee thou valiant man. But hee answered with a kind of
  admiration and wondring, Ah my Lord, If the Lord be with vs, why then is
  all this euill come vpon vs? This is a secret hidden from the eyes of the
  flesh; wherein we are to acknowledge these two truths:
               The one, That Tribulation conserueth Vertue.
               The other, That God giues tribulation to his best friends, as a
  reward of their great and good seruices.
               Touching the former, In that earthly Paradise, Vertue was
  conserued in it's perfect rest and quiet, because the goods of the bodie did
  concurre with the goods of the soule. But this concord was broken through
  sinne; and then vertue, amidst it's ease and pleasure, liued in greater
  danger; but in it's tribulation, in greater securitie. Caietan saith,
  That the certainest and most assured signe that Vertues are such strangers
  here vpon earth, is, for that they haue need of so many materialls of
  persecutions for their preseruation. Fire being in it's own sphere, is solely
  by it selfe conserued without any fuell to maintaine it, or breath of aire to
  blow it: the like succeedeth with Vertue.
               Touching the second, Saint Ambrose saith of
  Iob, That before the stormes of affliction fell vpon him, he was a
  holy man; yet for all that had he not the reward of holy,The
 best reward that God can giue his followers 
                  Virtutis praemium non
  habebat, God had not rewarded him for this his vertue: He had shewed
  himselfe a valiant souldier in peace, but not a Conquerour in warre; and that
  his troubles and afflictions bestowed vpon him the Palme of this his victorie.
  He saith likewise of Ioseph, That the temptation of his Mistresse
  clapt the Crowne of Chastitie vpon his head; and the wrong he receiued by
  imprisonment, was the Touch-stone of his valour. Your earthly Crownes are made
  of gold, but your heauenly Diadems, of the thornes of tribulation; Necesse
  fuit, vt tentatio probaret te, It was needfull that thou shouldst be tried by
  temptation. But this is a Theame which hath beene beaten vpon heretofore,
  and in many places much insisted vpon, and therefore I will passe it ouer.
               
                  Mans miserie the blason of Gods
 Maiesty.
                  This sickenesse is not vnto death, but for the glorie of
  God, &amp;c. That great &amp; dangerous diseases honour the Physition
  that doth cure them; that great and terrible tempests recommend the Pilots
  skill that can preserue the Ship amidst those cruell flawes and raging seas;
  that great victories innoble the Captaines that obtaine them, is a manifest and
  knowne truth: but that those stormes which pricke and paine my feet, should
  serue for flowers in Gods hands; that those stones whereat I stumble, should
  serue as Diamonds for his Crowne; this is a hidden treasure, and a secret
  mysterie of heauenly Phylosophie; but so certain, that in case God had not
  created the world for any other end than to throw tribulations vpon his
  friends, it had beene a famous piece of worke, and a most glorious Fabricke:
  for so great is the glorie which a Saint drawes from his sufferings, that he
  makes no reckoning of the paine that he indures. And it is fitly tearmed
  glorie, for that all our felicitie consisteth in the seeing of God,
  Tribulation openeth the eyes of the Soule, whereby wee come to see him the
  better, Vexatio dat intellectum, It is a kind of glorie to suffer
  affliction. Heretofore (sayd Iob) Auditu auris audiuite, nunc
  autem oculus meus videt te, In my prosperitie, ô Lord, I had some
  knowledge of thee; but now in my miserie sitting on the dunghill, I haue seene
  thee with myne eyes; I find a great difference between that which I heard,
  and that which I now see. Not that he saw God, (saith Saint
  Chrysostome) but because his knowledge was by his miserie made more
  cleere. After that man had fallen by sinne, God gaue that to him for a
  punishment, which before he had bestowed vpon him for entertainement: He had
  placed him in Paradise, to dresse &amp; keepe  it;
  afterwards he allotted it him as a chastisement, In the sweat of thy
  browes, &amp;c· and the mysterie is, That Gods disfauour is Hell,
  his fauour, Heauen: but trouble and affliction sent vs by God, is like vnto
  Moses his Bush, which the more it flamed, the fresher it seemed; for
  (as it is obserued by Saint Gregorie) the fire did serue there in
  stead of water: Suting with that of Saint Paul, Licet is qui foris est,
  noster homo corrumpatur; for by how much the more the bodie is dried vp
  and withered away, by so much the more doth the soule grow greene and flourish;
  and by how much the more the outward man waxeth weake, by so much the more the
  inward man waxeth strong.
               
                  For the glorie of God, &amp;c. Before your great
  battells are fought, they first begin with skirmishes; in your Tilts and
  Tournaments they begin with proffers and flourishes; betweene Loue and Death,
  after eithers brauado's, the warre is now ended: Loue skirmisheth with Death,
  and hath gotten himselfe such great glorie in this conflict, that with a
  generall shouting all crie out aloud, That Loue will win the field. There are
  many, who not truly looking into the cause of their punishment, crie out with
  Iob, O, that my griefe were well weighed,
                  
                     Iob. 6.2.3. 
                  and my miseries were layd
  together in the ballance, for it would be now heauier than the sand of the
  sea. And in another place, He hath multiplied my wounds without a
  cause. And Dauid complaineth, I did not enter into the cause
  of those many stripes which God had laid vpon me. But to al this it may be
  answered, That the cause thereof is the glorie of God. The stench vapours it
  selfe from forth the earth, it inuirons the circumuicining aire; the Wormes
  are knawing on Lazarus carkasse: all this loathsomenesse, this
  stench, and these Wormes, turne to the glorie of God.
               
                  That Mary which annoynted the Lord with oyntment,
  &amp;c. The titles whereby the Spirit of God makes these Sisters, and
  their brother knowne, are those their seruices expressed to our Sauiour Christ.
  Mary, who annoynted his feet, Martha who feasted him; and
  Lazarus, his beloued friend. For the greatest noblenesse that a soule
  can inioy, is, To serue and loue God; Feare God and keepe his
  Commandements, &amp;c. This is the onely true valour in man.
  Philon expounding that place vpon Genesis, These are the
  generations of Noah, &amp;c. He saith, That God willed Moses to
  make a Pedegree or Genealogie of Noah, but hee did not make it by
  fetching it from his famous ancestors, as your Noblemen and Gentlemen doe now a
  dayes, but from his Vertues. Those forefathers, and great grandfathers, which
  made Noah so renowned, were his obedience, his constancie, his
  fortitude, and his pietie. This is the true nobilitie of Gods Saints. The
  diuine Histories that blazons foorth Iob, describes him thus,
                     Iob. 1. 
                  Hee was an vpright and iust man, one
  that feared God, and eschued euill, &amp;c. But why did hee not make
  mention of his Fathers and his Kindred and Alliance? Because Gods Saints,
  boast not their parentage, but their vertue. Saint Chrysostome
  prooueth at large, that a man ought not to be commended for any thing, but his
  vertue. And hee rendereth three very good reasons for it.
               The first is, That all other our goods end with our liues;Nothing more properly ours, than Vertue. but vertue
  indureth for euer. The rest are bona aliena, they are not ours, but
  of others. But vertue, is bonum proprium, It is our owne proper good.
  And Saint Chrisostome treating of Nabuchadnezzars Statua,
  much condemneth the meanes that was vsed for the increasing of his honour, and
  authoritie: For he dishonoured himselfe by hauing that to be honoured; shewing
  thereby, that he relied more vpon a Statue of mouldring mettalls, than his owne
  bodie and soule: representing those therein, that are honoured more in the
  world for those outward goods of the body, than those inward goods of the
  soule; confessing as it were, that because they haue  not
  any thing in them that deserueth honour, they erect them Statues to bee
  adored.
               The second, None of all these exteriour goods doth satisfie the
  soule, but Vertue fills the Vessell of mans heart. Saint Ambrose
  interpreting that verse of Dauid, Accedite ad Deum, &amp;
  illuminamini, (id est) illuminabimini; addeth therevnto,
  Accedite, &amp; satiamini; accedite, &amp; liberamini; accedite, &amp;
  dimittemini: Come vnto God, and yee shall be illightned, for he is the Light;
  come vnto him, and yee shall be satisfied, for he is the Bread of life; come
  vnto him yee that are thirstie, for he is the Fountaine of liuing waters; come
  vnto him and be freed, for he is freedome it selfe; come vnto him yee that
  desire pardon, for he is the Remission of sinnes.
               
               
                  In all humane goods the cretures haue the
 start of man.The third, These humane goods are so base and so vile, that
  none can truly commend them. Art thou bold? A Lyon is more bold than thou. Art
  thou strong? A Beare is farre stronger: Art thou beautiful? a Peacocke goes
  beyond thee: Art thou braue and gallant? A Horse in his rich Caparisons is a
  more glorious sight: Liuest thou in great Pallaces? a Iackedaw, nay a Spider
  liues in greater and farre more sumptuous: Art thou a curious Workeman? The Bee
  is a better: Art thou nimble of bodie? The Hart is more: Hast thou a good eye?
  The Eagle hath a quicker: Hast thou a quicke sent, euerie Dog will out-nose
  thee: Art thou a good husband? The Ant is a better. It is a shame therefore
  that thou shouldst boast thy selfe of those things wherein the bruit beasts do
  surpasse thee. In a word, it did stead Lazarus more to be our Sauiour
  Christs friend, than nobly borne, or antiently descended.
               
                  The goodnes of Gods condition toward
 Penitents, expressed two manner of wayes. First, he neuer remembers their
 sinnes. Esay 38.17.
                  Which annointed his feet with
  oyntment. Here are two truths touching the goodnesse of Gods condition,
  pointed forth vnto vs:
               The first, That during all the time of Marie Magdalens
  perdition and profanenesse, there is not the least print or shew in Gods booke
  concerning any such matter, nor any memorie thereof remaining vpon Record;
  Marrie the World calls her Maria la Peccadora, Marie the Sinner, and
  represents nothing else vnto vs but her sinnes: but God doth not so, nay he
  doth not so much as thinke vpon them, or once offer to call them to mind.
  Projecisti post tergum tuum, (It was the saying of good King
  Ezechias) omnia peccata mea, Thou hast cast all my sinnes behind thy
  backe. It is a Spanish phrase, Echar al trançado, of that
  which is no more to be seene. Saint Augustine expounding that place of
  Ieremie, Ecce, ego obducam ei cicatricem; saith, That the Chyrurgeon
  cureth the wound, but doth not take away the skarre, but there is some marke
  thereof still remaining; but God not onely cures the wound, but therewithall
  quite quits the signe, as if there had neuer beene any such thing at all. Saint
  Chrysostome addeth hereunto, Cum sanitate reliquit
  pulchritudinem: Nor shall it bee an excesse of speech, to affirme, That
  Marie Magdalens repentance made her appeare more faire and beautifull
  than Saint Agnes the Martyr, S. Agatha, or S.
  Cicile.
               
               
                  Secondly, hee neuer forgets our seruices.
 Mat. 26.The second is, That God neuer blotteth out of his
  remembrance those seruices that he receiueth from vs, nor will suffer his
  friends to bee forgotten: And therefore our Sauiour saith touching this sinfull
  woman, Verily I say vnto you, wheresoeuer this Gospell shall be preached
  throughout the whole world, there shall also this that she hath done, be spoken
  of for a memorial of her; yee may chance to forget it, but God will not.
  Your Kings nominate Chroniclers to write downe the seruices of their Vassalls,
  and the famous acts of the valiant and stout men of war; Iosaphat the
  sonne of Eliud (as we may read in the booke of the Kings)
  erat à Commentarijs,
                  2. Reg.
 8.16. 
                  was the Chronicler. But Kings either not read them, or
  soone forget them: In Assuerus his Annals is set downe the good
  seruice which Mardochee 
                   had done him, by
  freeing his life from a treason that was plotted against him; but
  Assuerus had quite forgot it. But God is so farre from forgetting such
  seruices, that he vseth to assume vnto himselfe a name from the seruice that
  they doe him: he said vnto Iacob,
                  
                     Gen.
 31.13. Malach. 3.16. 
                  I am the God of Bethel where thou
  annointedst the Piller, where thou vowedst a Vow vnto me. Corresponding
  with that of Malachie, Scriptus est liber monumenti coram eo, And a booke
  of remembrance was written. Anonother letter hath it
  Recordationis, agreeing with the common Translation.
               
                  Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, &amp;c. What a strange
  kind of thing is this, that Lazarus being dead should find friends?
  For it is the course of the world, to hold him our friend that liues in
  plentie, prosperitie, and enioyes his health; but not that a sicke man, nay a
  dead man, should find a friend, &amp;c. Iob made it his complaint,
  My friends and familiar acquaintance forsooke me, and would not looke vpon
  me in my miserie: And he drawes his comparison of their sudden departure,
  from those downefalls of water in the Winter, which glide away with all the
  speed that may be. Salomon compares them to a rotten tooth, and a
  wearie foot. The Harlot is likewise the hierogliphycke of false friends; whose
  embraces and kisses are like those of Iudas, for money: your
  Quicke-siluer is likewise a simbole of the same, which forsaketh the gold in
  the Chrisoll; these are all of them things that faile in the time of need. The
  World hath not any one thing wherof it is more vnmindfull, than the Dead;
  Obliuioni datus sum, tanquam mortuus à corde, O, that the Dead
  should be forgotten by that heart which gaue it life! and that he should be
  forgotten by his friend, who placed him in honour and in riches. In a word, by
  how much the more miserie increaseth in the world, by so much the more
  friendship decreaseth. Saint Chrysostome saith, That the best friend
  that euer was, ascended vp vnto Heauen. Saint Augustine, That a friend
  is like a Physition that loues the Patient, and hates his disease; but if Death
  come betwixt him and home, his skill is at an end; for he that can recouer
  health, cannot recouer life: this is onely reserued for our Sauiour Christ,
  who is Medicamentum vitae, &amp; immortalitatis gratia. This
  Physition stiles Lazarus, his friend, in health, in sickenesse, and in
  death. Manus eius tornatiles. That Artificer which leuels his worke by
  his eye, commonly goes crookedly to worke, and commits many disproportions; but
  he that workes in a wheele as Turners doe, or in a Presse as your Printers,
  keepes a continuall euenesse and equalitie, in sickenesse and in health, in
  prosperitie and aduersitie, in Winter and in Sommer; and such an Artisan was
  our Sauiour Christ in all his actions.
               
                  Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, &amp;c. It is an ordinarie
  Language in Scripture,Death, whither temporall or
 spirituall, called a Sleep, &amp; that fitly. to call Death, Sleepe;
  whither it be the death of the soule, or the bodie. To him that was dead in the
  soule, Saint Paul saith, Arise thou that sleepest, &amp;c.
  Some sinners are so sound asleepe, that neither lights, loud calling, nor
  shogging of them can awaken them; Percussi eos, &amp; non doluerunt, I
  smote them, and they grieued not. Saint Augustine confesseth of
  himselfe, That he lay long in this Lethargy; and descending to vices in
  particuler, he saith, That God calling vpon your Theeues, for to haue them to
  make restitution; vpon your reuengefull natures, that they should not seeke
  reuenge; and vpon your Sensualists, that they should leaue off this their
  beastly course of life: some of them answer, That they cannot; others, That
  they dare not. Other Sinners there are that heare God in their sleepe, taking
  their dreames to be reuelations; considering with themselues, That God is woont
  to speake in dreames and in visions;
                     Iob. 33.
                  For God speaketh once or twice in dreames and visions of the night, when
  sleepe falleth vpon men, and they sleepe vpon their beds, then he openeth
  the eares of men by the corrections which  he had sealed,
  that he might cause man to turne away from his wickednesse, that he might hide
  the pride of man, and that his life should not passe by the Sword.
               The death likewise of the bodie, is, and that verie fittingly,
  termed sleepe.
               First, For the rest that they take: The Phylosophers called it
  Tempestatis p
                        •
                     rtum, the
  Hauen to our weather-beaten liues; Perigrinationis finem, the end of
  our pilgrimage here vpon earth; Omnium malorum medicamentum, A remedie
  against all diseases.
               
               
                  
                     Iud. 3.Secondly, For the
  danger wherein it leaueth sinners: Holofernes layd him downe to
  sleepe, fully persuading himselfe, that he should haue enioyed Iudith
  in his armes when he awaked; but alas poore soule, before euer hee was aware of
  it,
                     Gen. 20. he found himselfe in Hell.
  Abimilecke got him to bed, with hope to haue his pleasure of
  Saraah, but in the dead time of the night he found himselfe in the
  hands of an angrie God. To the rich man that inuited his soule to take his
  fill,
                     Luk. 12. for there was store enough for
  many yeares, Hac nocte, &amp;c. This night shall thy soule be taken from
  thee. Saul slept verie soundly and carelessely in his Tent, when
  Dauid might haue giuen him his passeport for another life.1. Reg. 2.6. And therefore no man ought to lay him
  downe to sleepe with lesse heedfulnesse, than if hee were now lying on his
  death bed. Your wretchlesse sinners feele a harder passage of it, and farre
  greater torment than the Iust. Death vseth to bring great torments with it:
  First, In seperating the soule from the bodie. Secondly, In forgoing those
  things it loueth, as gold, siluer, lands, houses, wife and children, which are
  all of them strings whereunto the heart is tied; besides the venture of our
  condemnation for euer, and the agonie of so many feares that will in this
  dissolution seise vpon vs. From all which the Righteous, though they threaten
  him neuer so much, remaineth free and vntoucht.
               
                  Christs passions differing from
 ours.
                  He groaned in the spirit, &amp;c. The Greeke word
  signifieth to roare, to crie out aloud, to waile, to lament, and to be much
  mooued: According to that of Theophilact, Et turbauit semetipsum, And was
  troubled in himselfe: It did awaken in the sensitiue part of him, those
  affections or passions, which (as Aristotle saith) are like vnto dogs,
  who in hearing any noyse, fall presently a barking till that their Master do
  still them &amp; make them hold their peace. In vs it is a kind of
  imperfection, because these affections or passions fall a balling without any
  reason in the world, and no iust occasion being giuen. But in our Sauior
  Christ, these passions were not without cause, as Saint Augustine hath
  noted it, Saint Gregorie, and Saint Hierome; neither can they
  presse him further than hee is pleased to command them. If here our anger take
  hold vpon vs, it is like a fierce mastiffe, which being set on by his Master,
  takes hold on the Bul, and will not let him go, though he be rated off againe
  and againe. In conclusion, two things doth here recommend themselues vnto
  vs.
               The one, That our Sauiour Christ was angrie.
               The other, That he was mooued to much compassion.
               His anger was occasioned through the Iewes incredulitie, (as it
  is noted by Cardinall Tolet and Caietane) whose hardnesse and
  vnbeleefe was such, that hee was forced to take Lazarus his life from
  him, to disconsolate those two kind Sisters, to draw teares from their eyes,
  and sobs from their brest, and afterwards to returne himagaine vnto the world,
  and onely that some might be drawne to bele
                     •
                  ue. Saint Cyril saith, That this his anger was against
  Death and the Deuill, as if he had threatned their ouerthrow, and vowed their
  destruction; as it is prophecied by Osee, O mors, ero mors tua, O death, I
  will be thy death. &amp;c.
               
               
                  
                  Vbi posuistis eum? Where haue yee laid
  him? &amp;c. O Lord, Why shouldst thou aske this question?
               I answer, That he did it for two reasons.
               The one, The countenance of a Sinner is so strangely changed,
  and is so strangely altered from what he was before he fell sicke of sinne,
  that it is a phrase of Scripture to say, God doth not know him. Thou lendest
  thy friend thy Horse or thy Cloake, the one is returned to thee so lame and so
  leane, the other so ill vsed and so vtterly spoyled, that not knowing thyne
  owne, thou sayest, This is not that which I lent. Of an vntowardly and
  vngratious sonne the father will vsually say, He is none of my sonne; so said
  God to the foolish Virgins, and to those that had wrought myracles in his name,
  Nescio vos, I know yee not. Your Robbers on the Highway disfigure the
  faces of those whom they rob and murder, to the end they may not be knowne. And
  there is nothing that makes the Soule fouler, than Sin, Denigrata est
  facies eorum super carbones: and it beeing so faire &amp; beautifull
  before, it is no great meruaile that God should not know it. So that now our
  Sauiour seemes not to know the place, there being so great a difference
  betweene the one place and the other [that of the life of Grace, and that of
  the death of Sinne] that he here askes, Vbi posuistis eum? Where haue yee
  layd him? Saint Chrysostome alledgeth, That hee vsed the like
  question when hee called vnto Adam, saying, Adam, Adam, vbi es?
  Adam, where are thou? I find thee in a different place from that wherein I
  put thee; I placed thee in prosperity and content, and I find thee now in
  wretchednesse and in miserie: Who caused this so great an alteration in thee?
  Saint Cyprian saith, That this question was made more to the Sinne
  than to the Sisters; and that Lazarus representing Mankind, he said,
  (speaking of our sinnes) Vbi posuistis eum? Where haue yee layd him? I
  placed him in Paradice, and yee haue put him in the graue. The like is
  reported by Petrus Crysologus; and he calleth the Graue, the Caue
  wherein the Deuill hides his thefts: and because the beginning of all this
  harme proceeded from woman, he asketh the Sisters, Vbi posuistis eum? Where
  haue yee layd him? For there are many women (God hauing placed man in
  honour, happinesse, and health) which bring man to his graue.
               The other, A Sinner through sinne is remooued so farre from
  God,Sin discoasts a man frō God. (in Regionem
  longinq
                        •
                     am) that God askes,
  where he is? For if it were possible for man to hide himselfe from the
  all-seeing eye of God, doubtlesse he would hide himselfe in the land of
  Darkenesse, that is, of Sinne. And therefore it is said,
                     Psal. 1.6. 
                  The Lord knoweth the way of the
  Righteous, and the way of the Wicked shall perish.
               
               
                  And Iesus wept.
                  Reasons why Christ
 wept. Of this sheding of teares wee haue rendred many reasons elsewhere:
  Those which now offer themselues are these:
               The first is of Saint Ambrose and Saint
  Chrysostome, who say, That Christ was mooued to weepe, by seeing
  Marie and Martha weepe. Christ seeing the Widow of Naim
  weepe, said vnto her, Noli flere, Weepe not; and in the house of the
  chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue, he sought to diuert their teares; and yet heere
  these of Marie seeme to extort by force the falling of these teares
  from his tender eyes. Marie had accustomed her selfe to talke with our
  Sauior in this 
                     •
                  ind of Language, it
  being a Cypher which onely our Sauiour vnderstood; and because she talked to
  him in teares, he answers her in teares. The exhalations of Maries
  heart ascend vp to the heauen of Christs eyes; and these humane teares draw
  downe diuine teares, obtaining that by grace which was impossible for nature
  to compasse.
               The second is of Saint Hilarie and Epiphanius,
  who affirme, That he thinking  on the obstinacie of the
  Iewes, and their finall perdition, brake forth thus into teares. For no man can
  comprehend what an offence to God is, saue God himselfe; and therefore none,
  ô Lord, can so truly bewaile sinne, as thy selfe. And it seeming to our
  Sauiour Christ, that two eyes were too little to lament their miserie, he added
  fiue wounds, which serued as so many weeping eyes, not shedding water, but
  bloud. Saint Bernard saith, That in the Garden our Sauior did sweat
  bloud, that he might weepe with all his whole bodie; treating therin touching
  the remedie of the mysticall bodie of the Church. Eusebius Emis
                        •
                     nus saith, That he did groane and
  weepe, in token that wee ought grieuously to lament and bewaile our
  sinnes.
                     Ier. 9.17.18. And to this purpose
  saith Ieremie, Call for the mourning women, that they may come, let them
  make hast, and let them take vp a lamentation for vs, that our eyes may cast
  out teares, and our eye lids gush out of water. And why, I pray you, so
  much weeping and lamentation, Quia ascendit mors per fenestras,
                  
                     Ibid. 21. (as it followeth anon after) Because
  death is come vp into our windowes, and is entred into our Pallaces, to
  destroy the children without, and the young men in the streets. The Soule is
  gone forth, and Death hath entred in, weepe therefore,The
 death of the soule is a true death; that of the bodie but a shadow.
  &amp;c. The death of the bodie is a type of that of the soule: And therefore
  Saint Gregorie saith, If I shall walke in the midst of the shadow
  of death. He saith, That the departing of the bodie from the soule is but
  a shadow, but the departing of the soule from God is a truth; and as a shadow
  is a refreshing in Sommer, so is death to the Righteous. The Wicked sticke not
  to say, There is no comfort in the end of man: But Gods Saints say,
  Thou hast couered vs with the shadow of death; When the fire of Hell
  did threaten vs, Death did shelter vs with it's shade. Cada vno habla de la
  Feria, como le va en ella, Euerie one speaketh of the Market as hee makes
  his pennie-worths. The Iust hath no cause to weepe, because hee that enioyeth
  God, enioyeth all the happinesse that can be spoken or imagined; but the Sinner
  may crie out, Ego plorans, &amp; oculus meus deducens aquas, quia
  longè factu
                        •
                      est à me
  consolator. It being the soule of my soule, and now seuered so far from
  me: thou hast cause to bewaile a bodie without a soule. It is a lamentable
  thing, (saith Saint Augustine) that we should bewaile other losses,
  and not that of our soule:Men carelesse of nothing more,
 than of their soules. 
                  Quid tam malè de nobis meruit anima
  nostra? How hath our soule so ill deserued of vs? He there considers the
  great care we haue of a new suit of cloathes, that neither the dust, the moath,
  nor the least wrinckle should hurt it, but are verie curious in folding of it
  vp. He that buyes, hath an especiall eye to two things:
               The one, to looke verie well to that he buyes, be it pearles,
  apparell, or horses, and will first make proofe and diligent enquirie of their
  goodnesse, &amp;c.
               The other, To cast about with himselfe, how he shall be able to
  pay, and to driue the price as well as he can. Doe thou likewise endeauour to
  vse the like diligences concerning thy soule; consider first, what kind of
  stuffe it is, and what it is worth, and then beat the price, and see for what
  thou canst buy it: Which course if thou shalt but take, thou wilt looke to it
  the better, and esteeme it the more and not set so slight by it as many
  doe.
               
                  Dead Lazarus the embleme of a
 Sinner.
                  Take yee away the stone: He stinketh alreadie, for he hath
  beene dead foure dayes. Lazarus being now foure dayes dead, lying
  stinking in his graue, and with a tombe-stone vpon him, doth represent a
  Sinner, that through long custome is growne old in his sinnes; That which
  might well haue beene cured, hauing gotten strength by time, is become
  incurable: not that it is impossible to be healed, but because it is a
  strange kind of cure, and healed with a great deale of difficultie. And
  therefore the Wiseman saith, That a Young man enured to ill, Age will not
  make him giue it ouer. Chrysostome calls Custome, Febrim
  furiosam, a hot burning Feuer; whose  raging flame
  taking hold on our appetites, there is no water that can quench it.
  Phylon calls it Regem animae, The King of our soule: agreeing
  with that language of Saint Paul, Let not sinne raigne in your mortall
  bodies. Plato reprehending a certaine Scholler of his, of some
  
                     •
                  ight faults; which he confessing,
  but making light of them, his Master told him, Custome is no such light thing
  as you make it. It is Saint Hieromes obseruation, That
  Ieremie said, O Lord, I know not how to speake, because I am but a
  child. And Esay, Woe vnto me that I haue held my peace, for I am a man
  of polluted lips. The one, God cured by onely touching his mouth with his
  finger: the other, he was faine to cauterise with a hot burning cole.Old sins, like old sores, hardly cured. Now the infirmitie
  being all one, why should the remedies bee so disequall? I answere, That the
  sinne of Ieremie was but a child as it were, verie young and tender,
  and therefore any the least remedie would serue his turne: but Esay
  was an old grown Courtier, &amp;c. Saint Augustine dwells much vpon
  this word Quatriduanus, his foure dayes lying in the graue. The
  Euangelists make mention of three dead persons which our Sauiour raised vp to
  life: not that he had not raised vp more, but because these doe represent the
  deaths of our soules. The daughter of the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue which
  went not out of her house,A threefold death of the
 Soule. represent those our secret sinnes which passe in our withdrawne
  roomes, and the closest by-corners about the house: The young man of Naim,
  those publique sinnes which proclaime themselues in the Market place, and
  comming out of doores, offer themselues to euerie mans view, your widows sonnes
  being generally lewd and ill giuen: Lazarus, those that stinke and
  grow vnsauorie through their too long custome of sinning, hauing lien long in
  this graue of death. Saint Augustine saith, That the name of three, in
  Scripture, betokeneth many sinnes; but that of foure, more than many. And this
  phrase of speech is vsed by Amos,
                  
                     Amos
 11. 
                  For three transgressions of Moah, and for foure I will not
  turne to it; signifying thereby, many, &amp; more than many. O terque
  quaterque beati, implies a world of happinesse: to the like sence sounds
  this word Quatriduanus, Foure dayes since.
               
               Whence it is to be noted,Gods loue seene by
 the delayes he vseth in his punishing. That sins when they begin like
  the waters to swell so high, they leaue their bed and run ouer the bankes,
  causing a miserable inundation. Gods anger growing wearie in the expectation
  of our amendment, draws his sword at last to cut vs off. The sinnes of Sodome
  cried out so loud, that the clamor thereof came to Gods eare; so shril was the
  noyse, that it brake through those other inferiour heauens, and ascended vp to
  the Throne of Thrones, where he sate in his Imperiall Maiestie. God was
  wondrous angrie at it, yet had hee this patience with himselfe, that before he
  would execute his wrath vpon them, he said, Vadam &amp; videbo, I will goe
  downe and see whither they haue done altogether according to that crie which
  is come vnto me, &amp;c. What greater euidence, ô Lord,
                     Genes. 1
                        •
                     . of thy loue, than these thy delayes? God did beare with
  them yet a little while longer, and hee did looke and stand waiting to see
  whether Sodome would amend the foulenesse of her sinne: so that when hee came
  downe to see how things passed, had he found them sorrowfull for what they had
  done amisse, and repenting themselues of their former euill life, hee would
  haue sheathed his sword, and withdrawne his displeasure. The same conceit
  passeth in that Parable of the Tares; the Tares grew vp amongst the Wheat, and
  the seruants asking their Master, Wilt thou that we goe and plucke vp the
  tares? He said vnto them, No, let them grow vp both together. And
  why so, ô Lord? It may be they wil die and wither away of themselues; if
  not, the haruest will come ere long, and they shall be cut downe, bound vp, and
  cast into the ouen. So that Gods patience, you see, is great; but when we
  perseuer in ill, Gods anger comes like an inundation 
  vpon vs. But I will conclude this point with Saint Austens owne
  conclusion, Sub tali resuscitatore, de nullo iacente desperandum est, Let
  no man despaire of rising, be he neuer so much cast downe, hauing such a one
  to raise him vp from Death to Life, as our Sauiour Christ Iesus, who is
  all Loue, and Mercie, and Goodnesse, and the Resurrection of all those that
  rely vpon him by Faith.
               
                  He stinketh alreadie. Martha here showed herselfe of
  somewhat a queasie stomach, and too daintie a nose, but so did not our Sauiour
  Christ. Giuing vs thereby to vnderstand, That a sinner sauours ill to all the
  world, but not to Gods nosthrils. When God shewed vnto Peter the
  sheet full of snakes, and lizards, and willed him to eate, it caused a verie
  great horrour in him: But vnderstanding afterwards, that the mysterie was in
  that which was signified thereby, and not in the doing of it, hee did
  acknowledge that there was not that sinner vpon earth, that was cast out from
  Gods bosome. You may come to be loathsome vnto your selfe,
                     Iob. 7. but not vnto God, I am a burthen vnto
  my selfe. Iob said this of himselfe, euen then when Gods eyes were
  gratious vnto him, and looked fauourably vpon him. My flesh is clothed with
  wormes and filthinesse of the dust, my skinne is rent and become horrible; I
  cannot indure the ill sauour that I beare about me; I haue not eyes to behold
  mine owne wretchednesse. But God hath an eye to looke vpon thee, and a heart to
  indure thee, and loues thee more than thou louest thy selfe. Those fiue and
  twentie young men which Ezechiel painteth forth clapping nosegaies to
  their noses, some say that it was to defend them from the euill sauour, as if
  they should haue giuen Iob a pomander to drowne the stench of his
  sores, beeing on the one side nothing but plaisters, and noisome vnctions, and
  onthe other amber, and muske. But Isidorus Cladius reads,
  Applicant odorem malum ad nares meos. They turne their eyes towards
  the Sunne, and putting their faces from mee, they seeke to auoid the euill
  sauour that comes from mee. The translation of Ionathas doth fauour
  this conceit, Obuertebant podicum faciebus eorum. In the honour of
  their Idols, and in their scorne of mee, they did vse the greatest inciuilitie
  could be offered vnto any. They are a stampe and embleme of those sinners
  before whom Vertue, and Holinesse of life sauoureth ill; but the myre of Vice
  and Sinne smelleth sweet. We know that the sauour of God is a sweet smelling
  sauour: Christi bonus odor sumus, We are a sweet smelling sauour vnto
  Christ. His name is a precious balme; His garments smell of sweetnesse.
  But as vnto weake eyes the Sunne is hatefull; so to a depraued sent, this
  sweete odour is vnsauourie. Yet God will not take a loathing at sinners, though
  like Lazarus, they lye stinking in their graues. For, albeit their
  sinnes doe offend his nosthrils, yet will hee not turne away his eye from a
  sinner, nor pull backe his hand from the dressing and curing of him. And as the
  father is not squemish and queasie stomacht, to helpe his child that is falne
  into the myre, and is nothing all ouer but filth and dyrt, but doth take him
  vp and comfort him, and wash him, and cloths him cleanlier and neater than he
  was before; so doth God with Sinners, when they haue falne ouer head and eares
  into most foule and loathsome sinnes, &amp;c.
               
                  Hee cryed with a loud voice, Lazarus, come foorth. Hee
  cryed out aloud; for many, following the errour of Pythagoras, did
  verily beleeue that the soules of the dead did remaine in the graue with their
  bodies.Why the heathen erected Pyramides ouer their
 deceased. To this purpose were erected those famous Pyramides of
  Memphis, and of other parts of the World, I say these their Pyramides were
  directed to this end; for they persuading themselues that the soule was a
  fierie substance, they imagined it to be in forme like a Py
                     •
                  amis. Saint Austen saith, That
  at the sound of this voice, Death was strucke  with
  astonishment. Dauid in a Psalme of his, setteth forth the obedience
  which all creatures beare to the voyce of God, as well lightning, raine, &amp;
  thunder, as the rest; The voyce of the Lord breaketh the Cedars,
                  
                     Psal. 29. 
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      the Cedars of Libanon: There is not the tallest Cedar in
  Libanon, which a flash of lightning, or a cracke of thunder will not rent and
  teare vp by the rootes, and consume it to ashes. The voyce of the Lord maketh
  the Wildernesse to tremble, it diuideth the flames of fire; it maketh the
  Hindes to calue, and discouereth the Forrests; there is not that least of
  liuing creatures, the poorest or the smallest Worme, that hides it selfe in
  holes and in the Rockes, which is not brought to light, and shewes himselfe
  when God calls vnto him. Phylon prosecuting this argument, weighes
  with himselfe the forcible violence of the Winds, in that they turn vp the
  sturdiest okes, making the roots euen with the tops; in that they ouerwhelme
  the tallest ships, and that they leuell with the ground the goodliest and the
  greatest buildings. Yet all these are nothing, compared with the powerfulnesse
  of this our Sauiour Christs voyce, which made Hell gates to shake, strooke
  Death dead, and made the Deuills roare for feare, &amp;c.
               
                  Then he that was dead came forth,
  
                        •

                        •
                     nd hand &amp; foot with hands, &amp;c.
                  The
 difference betwixt Lazarus rising out of the graue, &amp; our Sauiour.
  This dead man came forth, his feet and his hands being bound; which caused
  Saint Ba
                        •
                     il to crie out,
  Miraculum in miraculo, Here's one myracle vpon another: To raise vp
  one that was dead, was a strange and a ghastly kind of myracle; but that beeing
  now aliue, he should goe, being bound hand and foot, was another as strange
  &amp; great a myracle. Lazarus (had God beene so pleased) might haue
  left his winding sheet in the graue, his Kerchiefe, and the napkin that couered
  his face and eyes, as our Sauiour Christ did in his Sepulchre; but
  Lazarus here brings them out with him, in token that he did rise to
  die againe; but our Sauiour Christ rose neuer to die any more, though
  Lazarus died some thirtie yeares after this his resurrection, as it
  is left vs vpon Reco
                     •
                  d by
  Epiphanius: And this was the reason, why the Sepulchre of our Sauiour
  remained shut, and that of Lazarus left open.
               
                  Loose him and let him goe.
                  Occasions
 to sin must bee auoyded. Here Christ wills to be taken from him all
  those occasions that might cause him to stumble. If therefore thou wilt not
  fall, shun the occasions of falling, flie as farre from them as thou canst.
  Saint Bernard finds fault with Eue, and reprehends her
  seuerely for it, That shee would presume to looke vpon the tree of Life, that
  tree of good and euill, which she was so strictly enioyned to abstaine from;
  where the Text saith, The woman saw that it was good, and the eye no
  sooner saw, but the heart consented. But if any man shall replie and say, That
  the eyes or the hands doe onely incline a man to this or that, let him take
  this also from me, That the eyes are an Indicium and manifest signe of
  a sinne committed, at least a great occasion of that which may bee committed.
  Saint Cyril saith, That God appearing vnto Moses, and those
  twentie Elders or Antients of the People, in a throne of Saphyres of the colour
  of Heauen, was done onely to take away all occasion from that People, of
  Idolatrie. The Aegyptians did adore the Creatures, and did pull other things,
  though neuer so great, vnder their feet, in token that onely that Maiestie
  ought to bee worshipped and adored. Athanasius saith, That Gods
  appearing vnto Moses in the Bush,Why God appeared
 to Moses in a Bush. and not in any other tree that was either bigger or
  better, was, because that the Iewes being inclined to Idolatrie, would haue
  made them gods of Cedar, Pine, or Oke, to the diminution and lessening of the
  authoritie of the true and liuing God. And therefore to remooue this occasion
  from them, hee appeared in the firie Bush, whereof they could not so well make
  any Image or figure. God of his infinite goodnesse loosen vs with
  Lazarus, from the bonds of our sins, &amp;c.
            
         
         
            
            THE XXXI. SERMON, VPON THE SATVRDAY AFTER THE FOVRTH SVNDAY IN
LENT.
            
               
                  IOHN. 8. 
                  
                     Ego sum lux Mundi.
                   
                  I am the Light of the World, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               OVr Sauior Christ preaching to the People, had inuited those that
were thirstie, to drinke, If any be athirst, let him come to me and
drinke. There was a great stirre amongst them; some said, That he was a
Prophet; others, That he was Christ: but the Pharisees perseuering in their
hardnesse, said, It is not possible that so much good should come out of
Galilee. But this dust was layd with that plea of the Adulteresse, putting the
matter into their owne hands, leauing it to themselues, to iudge her whom they
had so maliciously accused. This businesse beeing ended, Christ went on with
his Sermon, and spake againe vnto them saying, Ego sum lux Mundi, &amp;c.
I am the light of the world. Theophilact noteth, That hee went about to
ouerthrow that which the Scribes and Pharisees had alledged, Out of Galilee
ariseth no Prophet. Yee hold me base and meane, for that I am of Galilee;
I am so farre from taking any lustre or brightnesse from thence, that I giue
light vnto all the World. He would likewise prooue that he was the Light, by
that act of his, touching the Adultresse. If he could discouer such secret and
hidden sinnes from the eye of the world; if he could banish and driue away
before him such thicke and darke clouds, he might verie well say, Ego sum
Lux mundi, I am the Light of the world; and whosoeuer shall follow me,
shall not walke in darkenesse, but shall haue the light of life. But the
Pharisees looking for another, would not giue credit thereunto, but in a
rebuking kind of fashion said vnto him, Thou bearest record of thy selfe, and
therefore thy Record is not true; thou maist boast thy selfe to be this and
this, but we shall hardly beleeue thee. Whereunto Iesus answered and said,
Though I beare record of my selfe, yet my record is true, for I know whence I
came, and whither I go; for I came into the world to lighten those that sit in
darknesse; and therefore I say vnto you, that I am the Light; but you doe not
know neither my beginning nor my end.Gods iudgement euerie
  way compleat And it is a needlesse scrupulositie in you, to doubt of
this myne owne testimonie; First, In regard of it's truth, being so true, as
nothing more. Secondly, In regard of it's qualitie, being so faith-worthie. Now
that this our Sauiours testimonie is firme &amp; secure, 
               quoad veritatem, he prooues it vnto vs, in that he saith, If I iudge,
my iudgement is true, for I am not alone, but I and the father, &amp;c. That it
is likewise good, quoad qualitatem, it cannot otherwise chuse, in
regard that he is the sonne of God, who is worthie of all faith and credit. But
if the Scribes and Pharisees wil needs find fault, let them find fault with
their owne ignorance, because they iudge according to the outward sence, not
according as things are, but as they seeme: Secundum carnem iudicatis, Yee
iudge according to the flesh, and therefore your iudgment is verie
vncertaine. I see not as man seeth;
               1. Reg.
  16. 
               for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord
beholdeth the heart: According to that of Esay, Non secundum v
                     •
                  sionem oculorum iudicauit. What,
doe yee thinke that I onely giue yee this testimonie, and that I goe about to
deceiue you? No, you are in an errour; For I am not alone, but I and the
father that sent me; and your owne Law alloweth the testimonie of two to
be true and authenticall. But then did they say vnto him, Where is thy father?
Iesus answered, Yee neither know me nor my father; for if you know not me, who
teach dayly in your Temple, how can you know my Father? &amp;c. His pretension
was to proue, That his light was powerful to scatter those clouds of darkenesse
that had shadowed the eyes of their vnderstanding, if the thicke dust of their
sinnes had not hindred their sight.
            
               I am the Light of the world, &amp;c. Amongst other
innumerable names which the Diuine Maiestie doth enioy, (as Eusebius
Caesariensis reporteth) one is,Christ why called the
  Light of the world. 1. Io
                        •
                     n 1.5. The Light; This is the message which we haue
heard of him, and declare vnto you, That God is Light. Of this Light, the
Scripture telleth strange things.
            The first, That it is inaccessible; according to that of Saint
Paul, Hee dwelleth in the light that none can attaine vnto. Aristotle
saith,1. Tim. 6.16. That the cleerest eyes
are in order and disposition to this Light; as the eyes of the Owle in respect
of the Sun: the chiefest and the highest of Angells, hath need of more abilitie
for the light of this glorie, that his eyes may not be dazeled with the beams
of this Light.
            The second, That whatsoeuer light or beautie is to bee found in
the World, is wholly deriued from this Light; the Moone, the Starres, the
Planets, and the coelestiall Orbes. Dionysius saith, That they receiue
their light and splendour from the Sunne; and that the Sunne, and all that is
aboue the Sunne, Angells, Arch-Angells, Thrones, Powers, Principalities,
Dominations, &amp;c. And whatsoeuer is contained in Heauen and Earth, receiue
their motion and light from this Light.
            The third, That if the Light should faile, the World were nothing
worth; for then the life and being of the World could not subsist; the
creatures, the fruits, the Elements, the actions of men, the birds and beasts,
without this light were not able to last and continue.
            Whence I inferre, That the world remaining in such palpable da
                  •
               kenesse, better newes could not betide
vs, than this glad tydings of our Sauiour, Ego sum Lux, I am the
Light. A man looseth himselfe in a stormie and tempestuous night,The benefit of this Light he findeth hims
                  •
               lfe in a darke and mountainous
Wildernesse, compassed about with pitchie Tents of darkenesse, with horrours,
feares, lightning, thunder, with the howling of Wolues, the shreeking of Owles,
the rushing of Riuers, the roaring of torrents, the blustring of winds, the
croaking of Frogs and Toads, the scratching of bushes and bryars, with
wearinesse, cold, raine, snow, and all this in an Aegyptian Darkenesse, able to
quell the stoutest heart, and make Courage turne coward: what a world of sighes
would he send forth, if those were able to disperse the Clouds and cleere the
Skie, that he might haue light? he is in as pittifull case, if not worse, as he
that is tormented with a sha
                  •
               pe 
 burning Feuer, or with a furious Apoplexie, in a long
and tedious winter night: for he may better passe it ouer with the conueniencie
of a good bed and Chamber, cleane linnen, and a little sleepe; comforting
himselfe, that the day will at last appeare, and that he shall see the light.
And if in a daintie fine Aprill morning, it giues a man such great content, to
see the Trees apparelled in greene, the lights and the shadowes which the Sunne
beames paint them forth withall, the drooping and wither-starued hearbes
raising vp their hanging heads, holpen by the dew of Heauen; the Flowers and
the Roses discouering the beautie of their faces; the singing of the Birds,
which with their musicke entertaine the light; the bleating of the Kids and
Lambekins, the Heardsman going forth with his Cattell, the Faulkener with his
Hawkes, and the Huntsman with his Hounds; What discomfort on the contrarie must
he take, that hath lost himselfe in avast Wildernesse in the manner afore
mentioned; or keepes his bed, tired out with a long and tedious sickenesse?
&amp;c.
            
               Ego sum Lux Mundi, I am the Light of the world, &amp;c.
Out of the desire that man had to enioy more light than God had giuen him,
bayted with the Deuills promise, he bit; Eritis (said the Deuill)
sicut Dij, scientes bonum &amp; malum,
               
                  Gen.

               Yee shall be as gods, knowing good and euill. By which
offence he was clouded with the darkenesse of sinne: verifying therein that
which was afterwards verified by Esay, We looked for light, and behold
darkenesse. In the beginning of the World, when all things remained in
that darke Chaos, euerie thing was so poore and miserable, as nothing more: by
Light, God drew light out of darkenesse, he therewith did beautifie and inrich
his Creatures, hee did cheare and cleere the Elements, he did banish
darkenesse, he gaue those goodly and liuely colours to the whole Vniuerse, and
all of them ioyntly remained so jocond, so merrie, and so well pleased, that in
their dumbe kind of Language they gaue great thankes to that Light. Man
remained in a Chaos no lesse darke, through sinne; and those that had the best
sight, did confesse, Wee groaped, like blind men, against a wall at noone
day. God did prepare great Lights for to rid away this grosse Darkenesse,
as Patriarkes, Prophets, Kings, and famous Captaines: but as in the darkenesse
of Aegypt, That bright flame of the Starres could not illighten that
horrible darke night; So likewise in that night of the old Law, those
(though most excellent) cleere Lights could not expell that darkenesse. God for
to repayre his Peoples discomfort, did promise to giue them a great Light;
The People that sate in darkenesse saw a great Light, That is, The
people shall see it, so saith one of the Prophets; for, for the more
assurance of the Prophecie, they vse to put the preterperfect for the future.
Orietur vobis Sol Iusticiae, saith another Prophet, A S
                     •
                  n of Righteousnesse shall rise vnto
you. The People cried vnto God, That he would fulfill his word; they did
weepe, lament, sigh, and mourne; all the Creatures at last, remained so
perfect, so prosperous, and so rich, and held themselues so happie, that
cloathing themselues with new ioy, they gaue the good day to this Light. The
Histories are full of those prodigies and wonders which hapned at our Sauiours
birth. Baruc; The Starres shine in their watch, and reioyce; When he
calleth them,
               
                  Baruc 3.34. 
               they say,
Here we be; and so with cheerefulnesse they shew light vnto him that made
them. And though those three Suns had giuen aduice thereof, (which
Plinie speaketh of) and those nine Sunnes whereof Bartolomeo
Risana maketh mention; besides those Kings, Sheepheards, Sybils,
Symeon, Anna, and the Prophecies; yet this Light had not displayed his
beames, but now cleering the earth with his wonderful Myracles, he saith,
Ego sum lux mūdi, I am the Light, &amp;c.
            
            Two occasions offered themselues for this Reuelation.
            
               The one, The libertie and life of the
Adultresse; for the freeing of whome, he discouered the secret sinnes of her
accusers, leauing them not onely amased and ashamed, but agrieued and offended:
and it seemeth that he answers to this their complaint, Ego sum Lux
mundi. Of force the Light must driue away Da
                  •
               knesse, and discouer those secrets which are hidden
vnder the cloake of the night: This is the argument of that Parable, No man
lighteth a candle, and putteth it vnder a bushell, but sets it on a
candlesticke, that it may giue light to all that are in the house. My
Father did not send this Torch into the world to put it vnder a bushell, and
therefore you need not to be so angrie, or thinke you are wronged. One of the
fearefullest accidents that euer was or shall be seene, was, That the Light
comming into the world, and all other creatures remaining so rap't with sudden
joy at this so rich a treasure, Man only should shut his eyes against his own
good, giuing Ieremie iust cause to crie out, Stand astonished,
ô yee Heauens, at this, That the Thirstie should despise the
Fountaines of the waters of Life, and that the Blind should mislike the Light.
Whosoeuer (saith Saint Bernard) had but seene our Sauiours teares,
sighs, and sufferings, and all for our sinnes, and to redeeme vs from
damnation, would haue sworne, no newes could bee so welcome as the comming of
this Sunne of Righteousnesse, to illuminate the world, and to lighten those
that sate in darkenesse. But as your Quaile rages when the Sunne riseth; and,
as Plinie saith of the Athlantes, That they curse it with a thousand
curses, because it parcheth and burnes vp their grasse; and as those (saith
Iob) tha
                  •
               
               
                  ••
               sh for Whales, doe curse the day;
and as hee that is asleepe is offended when the light awakes him, and as weake
&amp; infirme eyes cannot indure the beames of the Sunne; so these Pharisees
were offended and grew verie hot and angrie, that the glorious Light of our
Sauiour Christ should discouer their sinnes.
            Some man perhaps may aske, whence this hatred growes? Saint
Iohn resolues it thus, As in the naturall World,The
  reason why some hate and shunne it. amongst birdes and beasts there are
many that cannot indure the light of the day, &amp; comming in the night out of
their caues &amp; holes, seeke their food in darkenes, according to the
Prophet, They seeke it from God; But when the Sun begins to peep
forth, he shuts them vp in their dennes, and makes them affraid to show their
heads: so in the Morall World, there are children of darkenes and of the
night, which cannot abide the light of the day, That their Actions may not
be called into question. The night is the sinners cloake; The Light, the
Herald that proclaimes all humane Actions; &amp; such are those of these men,
that they haue not the face to come abroad, or to stand in the light. And
therefore whilest our Sauior Christ was writing on the ground with his finger
the sins of those that accused the Adulteresse, they sneaked thence, and
shrunke away one by one, Vnus post vnum.
            
            It seemeth a thing impossible, that the Light beeing so louely and
so amiable, so faire and so beautifull, that any man should hate and abhorre
it, and curse and damne it to the pit of Hell. But it should seeme (me thinkes)
much more impossible, that this Light beeing God himselfe, that mans eye should
find any thing in it, that may draw on a dislike and hatred thereunto. But
Saint Iohn pondering the distasted palat of a sinner, saith, They
loued Darkenesse more than Light.
               
                  Iohn
  6. And the booke of Wisedome renders the reason thereof, Doe not you
maruaile that we should abhorre it, seeing that the Light doth discouer vnto
vs the foulenesse of our liues, the treasons and trecheries of our hearts and
bosomes, which wee seeking to couer with the nights mantle, it proposeth vs to
the open view of the world, and to the shame of the day,
                  Iob. 29. 
               Oculus adulteri (saith
Iob) obseruat caliginem, The eye of the adulterer waiteth for the
twilight. They digge through  houses in the darke; but
the morning is euen to them as the shadow of Death. Many are the deceits
and errours of the night. He that trauailes in a darke night, takes Rockes, to
be Castles; Trees, to be Houses, Bushes, to be Men; Stubble fields, to be
standing Pooles; high bankes, to bee euen ground; and that which is far off, to
be neere at hand. In the Citie, a man is taken for a woman, a woman for a man,
a widow for a maid, a maid for a married wife, the mistresse for the maid, the
knight for his foot-man, and the church-man for a whoores champion. All is
maskes and vizards, and disguises; and it is onely the Light that doth banish
these deceits and false dealing.
            
               I am the Light of the World, &amp;c. The other occasion
that offered it selfe for this Reuelation, was the great noise and clamor of
the people: Some crying out that he was a Prophet, others that he was the
Christ; but the Pharisees, that hee was a Galilean,
                  Iob. 7. 
               Out of Galilee ariseth no
Prophet. In conclusion, There was dissension amongst the people for
him. They could not see the light, without the beames of the Light. And
therefore he saith vnto them, Ego sum lux mundi. And condemning those
that were most passionately bent against him, calling him in disgrace Galilean,
and that so bad a Countrey could not afford a prophet; while they were
vpbraiding this vnto him, he tels them, Ego sum lux mundi. Galilee
could not giue any lustre to him that was the light of the World. The countrey
doth not giue an honor to the Man that was borne there, but the Man to the
countrey. Your most populous Cities, haue your most heynous Delinquents.
Amaziah King of Iuda, sent a proud message to Ioash King of

answere, The thistle that is in Lebanon, sent to the Cedar, &amp;c. As if he
should haue giuen him this short come-off, To boast to bee borne in Lebanon,
and to be but a poore thistle, is an infamie and reproach vnto thee; But to bee
borne in a barren Desart, and become a Cedar, is a great honour and
reputation. What bootes it thee to bee a King lineally descended from
Dauid, and that thou wast borne in Ierusalem, if the coursenesse of
thy actions bewray thee to bee a thistle? There are many that are an honour to
their house, and many againe that are a disgrace vnto it. Many innoble their
countrey, and many make it to bee accounted base and had in contempt. Some are
made to honour it, some to dishonour it. Eue was made of better earth
than Adam, yet wee see in her actions shee was lesse noble,

               In mans life the
                     •
                  e are two wayes, and he had need of a
  Guide.
               He that followeth mee, shall not walke in darkenesse,
&amp;c. That a man may not erre in his way, hee hath not onely need of a
light, but a guide also. Thou trauailest in the night, thou comest to two
seuerall wayes, and thou meetest with no man; the day appeares, the light
ouercomes the darkenesse, but not thy doubting of the way, and therefore thou
hadst need to haue a guide. In this iourney of mans life, there are two wayes;
The one the narrow way, that leads vnto Heauen, the other the broad way that
leades vnto Hell; the one to good, the other to ill. The light that dispelleth
the darkenesse, will not serue the turne, but wee must likewise haue a guide to
direct vs and to tell vs, This is the way, and those are the towers of the
Citie. Salomon saith, That there are wayes which seeme vnto man to
secure life, but lead vnto death. Cogitationes mortalium timidae &amp;
incertae prouidentiae nostrae, There is no humane thought certaine, no
prouidence secure, And therefore wee had need of a guide. Saint
Austen craueth of God in his Confessions, Heale mee ô Lord of my
painefull greefe, and ease me of my heauy load; for whatsoeuer I say or doe, is
for me a doubtfull question, Et ipse est languor meus. As necessitie
doth alledge for her part, that it is necessarie  to
eat, for to liue; for if our naturall heat did not find something whereupon to
work and spend it's force, our life would quickely be at an end. But as the
hauing recourse to this necessitie, is sweet to the sence of our Tast; it
alledgeth, that this maintenance is the medicine of hunger, and that to the
Sicke we are not to giue physicke by ounces, who hath a good stomacke, and is
continually hungry: and for that what we eat must necessarily passe through the
Tast, our delight presseth it selfe forward, importuning for the Tasts sake,
that something more be done, than that which is due to necessitie: and because
necessitie will be satisfied with a little, and much will not suffice our Tast,
Factus sum quaestio. The like plea passeth with the eyes; I place them
vpon colours, vpon the beautie of Floures and Roses, vpon the curious Pieces of
the famousest Painters, and vpon those more liuely Pictures which God hath
painted; presently there growes in me a contention, betwixt Curiositie and
Temperance: for Curiositie doth so flatter &amp; sooth vp the eyes, that it
makes them oft-times to slip awrie, Periculosa, &amp; illecebrosa
dulcedine; This befalling me many times before euer I doe so much as once
dreame or thinke vpon it; hapning as it were vnawares, which is one of the
greatest miseries, and the most to be pittied either in myne owne, or any other
mans life: For I know not how farre my passions may trespasse vpon me, they
hauing taken possession of my heart, and liuing (like Inne-mates) within the
doores of myne owne house. Nay rather euen then when I thinke my selfe to be
freest from them, and most secure, as if they had roused themselues from some
heauie sleepe, they rise vp with greater force, and eagerly set vpon me, so
that I am at perpetual question, and at continuall oddes with my selfe from top
to toe, from the crowne of my head to the sole of my foot. And therefore in so
dangerous a doubting, it is fit (ô Lord) that thy Light should bee a
guide vnto my feet, that I may know what, and how much I ought to minister to
my necessities, and to my sences. Plutarch reporteth of the Whale,
That hee hath a verie little Fish that serues as his Gentleman-Vsher, and as a
guide to lead him through the perills and dangers of the Deepe; and he sheweth
himselfe so thankefull, that when this little Fish enters with others into his
maw, hee acknowledgeth his kindnesse, and becomes his Guard or Sentinell
whilest he sleepes. The Wiseman sends the Sluggard to learn of the Pissemire;
so may we send the blind man to learne of the Whale: for, farre greater are the
dangers of the sea of this life; the way is more darke, and therfore walke not
without a Guide, &amp;c.
            
               But shall haue the light of life. The fauourable
influence of Light,The glorie of the Sunne. is a
prosperous Prognostication of life. When Alexander was borne, the
Historians report, That he had the Sunne for his Ascendent. Pierius
sets downe for a symbole of Life, a Sunne with a Starre in the midst of it,
which ariseth from out the sayd Sunne. Ezechias made choice of the
Sunne for a pledge and token of his life: and as the benigne aspect of the
Sunne doth fauour and further our life, so the rigorous aspect thereof doth
threaten death and destruction. Cyrus did dreame, That he had the
Sunne betweene his hands; Whence the Astrologers did diuine, That he should be
short liued. Sambucus did put for an Embleme of the Pestilence, many
dead persons, and ouer them a Sun which did burne and consume them. But more
fauourable is the influence of the Sunne of Righteousnesse, who is the Light
of life. Saint Iohn painting forth in his Apocalyps that
superexcellent Citie of the celestiall Ierusalem, saith, That there is no need
of Sun nor Moone, Quia lucerna eius est Agnus, The light which illuminateth
it, is the Lambe, that Light of Life. The candle when it burnes, we say it
is Vela viu
                     •
                  
               ; but this is
an improprietie, for the flame is not it's Soule. Your Glow-wormes may bee 
 termed in some sort Luzes viuas, liuing Lights;
because (as Plinie reporteth) they shine in our mouthes, our hands,
and our cloathes: but these are but short Lights, the Carbuncle out-shineth all
these, yet all is too little for the immensitie and vastnesse of Heauen, nay
for the least corner therein, the Sunne in it's greatest glorie shall seeme
there but as a Candle.
            
               But shall haue the light of Life, &amp;c. By this Light,
the Saints and Doctors vnderstand Faith; for in regard that it is
Principium Iustificationis, The first beginning of our Iustification,
Life is attributed thereunto. It hath beene a thing often repeated by our
Sauiour,
                  Mat. 5. Rom. 8. Luc.
  17. 
               Thy Faith hath made thee whole. And Saint Paul, The

                     ••
                  st liues by Faith: He begins
with Faith; for, He that will approch neere vnto God, must first
beleeue. It was the Apostles suit to our Sauiour, O Lord increase our
Faith, and so we shall goe on from Faith to Faith, and from Vertue to
Vertue.
            
               Christ testified by many, yet not embraced of
  the Pharisees.
               If thou bearest Record of thy selfe, thy Record is
not true. Saint Augustine saith, That there preceded so many
testimonies of our Sauiour Christ, as the Patriarkes, Prophets, Prophesies,
Sybils, Kings, Sheepheards, Simeon, Anna the Prophetesse, and lastly
Iohn Baptist, whom they held to be some Diuine power sent downe from
Heauen; that our Sauiour asking them, Whether the Baptisme of Iohn
were from Men, or from God? They durst not denie that it was from God, least
the People should stone them. And adding to these testimonies, the workes that
himselfe wrought, If yee will not beleeue me, yet beleeue my workes; for if
I had not done those things which no man else hath done, they had not sinned,
but now they haue no excuse for their sinne. And for the testimonie of his
Doctrine, Nunquam sic locutus est homo, Neuer man spake as he spake:
God may speake so, but Man cannot. What shall we say to that testimonie of his
father in Iordan, This is my beloued Sonne in whom I am wel pleased?
And that of the Holy-Ghost in the forme of a Doue, which (as it is obserued by
Saint Hierome) sate vpon our Sauiours head, because none should
presume that the voyce proceeded from Saint Iohn? And that of the
Sonne of God himselfe, Though I beare Record of my selfe, yet my Record is
true? Complying with that which was spoken by the Euangelist, There
are three which beare Record in heauē, the Father, the Word, &amp; the
Holy-ghost: any one of these Testimonies might haue giuen satisfaction to
a heart free from passion; but all of them put together, were not able to mooue
such rebellious brests and such obstinate hearts as theirs were. Great was the
hardnesse of Pharaohs heart, since after so many strange prodigies, he
sayd, I know not the Lord. Moses did not see our Sauiour Christ, nor
had any more witnesses than his Rod: neither were his wonders so great as those
myracles which our Sauiour wrought: so that the Pharisees being more hard than
Pharaoh, sayd, If thou beare Record of thy selfe, &amp;c.
            
            
               Three conditions required in euery
  Testimonie.
               If I beare Record of my selfe, yet my Record is true,
for I know whence I came, and whether I goe, but you cannot tell, &amp;c.
The circumstances of my Testimonie admit no exception, and those that are
required, are commonly three, Natura, Conditio, Via.
            
            Nature, Whether it be a man or a woman.
            It's Qualitie and Condition, Whether he be a Freeman or a Slaue,
an old man or a young, a Clergie man or a Lay man.
            The Way, whether it be of Vertue or of Vice. Our Sauiour Christ
doth not alledge any one of these circumstances, but onely tells them, My
testimonie is true, for I know whence I come, and whether I goe. Which was
as much in plaine language, as to tell them that he was God, I am God, and
the Sonne of God, in whom there cannot be the least signe or shew of a
lie; and his proofe is, I know whence I come, and 
 whither I goe. Man is not able to know from whence
he came, nor whether he is to goe; for this is a priuiledge proper onely vnto
God. Saint Augustine interprets this of our Sauiour Christ, The
Sunne knowes his setting; for the materiall Sunne knowes it not; and none
amongst men doe know their setting and their end. Your Astrologers do erect
Figures, prognosticating other mens successes, and casting their natiuities,
but neither truly know their owne, nor other mens fortunes; for it is a thing
reserued onely for God: The Wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou
knowest not whence it commeth, nor whither it goeth. No man can attaine
vnto the inspirations of the Holy-Ghost, nor to the designes of his actions.
Of all those secret sinnes whatsoeuer, which man committeth alone by himselfe,
as Sorcerie, Periurie, Murder, &amp; the like, no one man in all the world can
giue testimonie thereof, but God can, for he is present at all; Thou
knowest my lying downe, and my rising vp, thou seest my wayes, and
vnderstandest my paths afa
                     •
                  re; if I
ascend vp into Heauen, thou art there; if I goe downe into Hell, thou art also
there. From Salomon was hid the path of a Ship in the Sea, of an
Eagle through the aire, of a Snake through the Rocke, and of a young man in the
floure of his youth; but from Gods eye nothing can be hid.
            The knowing of this truth will draw on the confessing of another;
to wit, That of the things appertaining to God, none can giue testimonie but
God. No man euer saw God, so saith Saint Iohn; Who then shall
giue vs testimonie of God? The onely begotten Sonne, which was in the
bosome of his Father, he shall doe it
               ▪ Of the Father, the Sonne shall
giue Record; and of the Sonne, the Father; &amp; of both, the Holy-Ghost: In a
word, euerie one of these Diuine Persons, of himselfe; but Man cannot doe it
but by reuelation.
            
               Thy Record is not true. Yes, it is; for I am the Light of
the World, and of the Light none can giue Record but the Light. If any man
should say vnto the Sunne, Prooue it vnto me that thou art the Sunne, it were a
meere follie, if not madnesse, for his beames doe prooue it and proclaime it to
the World: In like manner, that the Pharisees should say vnto our Sauiour
Christ, Prooue vnto vs, that thou art the Light, was a meere blindnesse in
them; for, No Man could doe that which he did, vnlesse God had beene with
him. Vpon a Glasse the Sunne is vsually so translated, that it were a
foolishnesse to aske a testimonie, Whether it bee the Sunne or no? And vpon the
humanitie of our Sauiour Christ, the beames of his Diuinitie were in that sort
transferred, that it was hardnesse of heart, and obstinate wilfulnesse, to
desire further testimonie from God. Saint Paul saith, He that drew
light out of darkenesse, he did inlighten our soules, that they might see the
beames of the light of God, in the face of his Sonne Iesus Christ. And for
this the naturall light was sufficient: but in the Pharisees this was so
blinded through the dust of their sinnes, that they could not see this Sunne.
The Seale that is imprinted in Wax, shewes it selfe as cleere as if it were
grauen in Brasse or Steele; but with time or with dust it comes to be blotted
out, in that manner, that the stampe and letters are not knowne. So doth it
succeed with a Sinner, with this naturall light, when it is once darkned
through sinne; whence it commeth to passe that he falleth into those foule and
grosse ignorances which the brute beasts would not fall into.
            
               Yee iudge after the flesh. He prooues by another
reason,Christ the
  
                     ••
                  
                  ly true Sunne that seeth all
  things. that his Record is true: Yee iudge according to the Flesh, by
that which is not, but by that which seemeth so to be; but I iudge according to
the heart, I search and trie the verie reynes. Saint Ambrose called
the Sunne, Oculum Mundi, The Worlds eye; not onely because it affoords
vs that light whereby our eyes haue power to see,  but
because it sees all things: and in case that it being in the other Hemispheare,
it doth not see that which passeth in this; yet Gods eyes see all that is both
in this, and in that other world. Orpheus called the Sunne, Oculum
Iustitiae, The eye of Iustice; whose office it is, to discouer whatsoeuer
is darke and secret. Antiquitie painted him sitting in a Ship, gouerning the
same as a Pilot; for beholding the Starres and the Mariners Compasse, he doth
not onely discerne the dangers that are aboue the water, but those hidden
Deepes which are vnder the waters. But neither the Sunne of Heauen, nor those
Sunnes of the earth can reach into the withdrawing roomes of mans bosome; onely
the eyes of Christ can looke into them, which are farre brighter than the
Sunne, His eyes are brighter than the Sunne,
               
                  Eccl. 23. Hier. 17. Apoc. 3.
               I am the Lord that searcheth the heart, and trieth the reynes, so
saith Ieremie and Saint Iohn. The beames of the Sunne
discouer the atomes and motes in the ayre, but not the thoughts and secrets of
the heart. But the beames of the Sun of righteousnesse, discouer our smallest
thoughts. It was the foole that said in his heart, There is no God.
And though this saying came not out of his mouth, yet hee found it published in
the market place; because God diueth into the heart. The Spouse compares him to
that Goate, which the Greekes call Dorcas, for it's quicknes of sight,
as Saint Gregory Nyssene hath noted it: If a man hide himselfe in
darkenesse, shal not I see him? The Kings of the Gentiles, pretending to haue
the world to take them for gods, they gaue them to vnderstand, that they did
know the thoughts of men. To this alludeth that, which Ioseph said to
his brethren, An ignoratis, quod non similis in augurandi scientia?
Cicero saith, That among the Persians, no man could be King, who was not
skilled in the Art of Diuination. And for this cause, innumerable Witcheries,
and Sorceries were multiplyed and increased amongst them. But it is a foolerie
to imagine, That any man can enter into them but God. To which God be ascribed
all honour, power, and glory, now and for euermore. Amen.
         
         
            THE XXXII. SERMON, VPON PASSION SVNDAY.
            
               
                  IOHN. 8. 
                  
                     Quis ex vobis arguet me de peccato?
                   
                  Which of you will reprooue me of sinne?
               
            
            
               Inconueniences which would haue followed the
  peccabilitie of Christ.
               OVr Sauiour Christs innocencie, by many forcible
reasons and strong arguments, we haue elsewhere sufficiently prooued: Now
shall I proue vnto you the inconuenien
                  •
               es which would haue followed his peccabilitie.
            First of all, The bloud of our Sauiour Christ was that wherein the
Church washed her selfe, These are they that washed their Stoles in the
bloud of the Lambe: And hee could not make them white,
                  Apoc. 7. had he not bin whitenes himselfe. The
bloud of her Beloued  puts colour and beauty into her
cheekes. Sanguis eius ornauit gen
                     •
                   me
                     •
                  s. Shee
speakes of the beautie of the soule; and he could not make her faire, had he
himselfe beene foule. And therefore saith Saint Paul, It was fit he should
be so, that he might be a high Priest, holy and vndefiled, &amp;c.
            
            The second inconuenience that would follow thereupon would bee
this, That our Sauiour Christ could not be a competent Iudge, had he beene a
sinner, as he was not. He that iudgeth another, himselfe being faulty,
condemneth himselfe. And for this reason, a Iudge that is notoriously knowne to
be a corrupt and naughty man, may iustly be refused. Iudas
acknowledging himselfe to be a delinquent in the Incest of his daughter in law,
Tamar
               ▪ was so farre from proceeding in iudgement against her,
that he said, Iustior me est,
               2. Reg.
  11. 
               She is more righteous than I. When Ioab aduised
Dauid of the siege of Rabbah, and what a number of men he had
lost in that seruice, the King might haue iustly cut off his head for his rash
and vnaduised approach to the wall; But Dauid durst not condemne him,
and put him to death, because he was an Accessorie, or rather the principall in
the busines: and therefore Ioab charged the messenger that carried the
newes, saying, If the Kings anger arise, so that he say vnto you, Why went you
nigh the wall, &amp;c. (the storie is worth your reading) then say thou, Thy
seruant Vriah the Hittite is also dead. This point did that kingly
Prophet touch vpon in those words so diuersly commented on, Tibi soli
peccaui. O Lord my sinne was against Vrias, against those
souldiers that died for his occasion, against those which did blaspheame thy
name, and against the people, whom the robbing of another man of his wife, and
the killing of her husband, hath scandalized, and beene an occasion of great
offence vnto them. But that which doth most aff
                  •
               ict and torment me, is, That I haue committed this against thee,
and that I haue thus sinned against thee; For in any other person whatsoeuer in
my kingdome, the rigour of Iustice might haue restrained him from so foule a
sinne, but this did not once enter into my thought. And therefore he comes with
a Tibi soli peccaui; iumping with that saying of Saint Paul, Qui
iudicat me, Dominus est, He that iudgeth me, is the Lord.
            
            The world hath not that man in it, whom his Propria
culpa,
               Sinne maketh the most valiant man a
  Coward. 
               The sinnes which himselfe hath committed, doe not mooue
or daunt him, and make him turne Coward, sauing Christ, who was made perfect by
nature, Nemo mundus à sorde, neque

                     •
                  nfans vnius diei. How can he
be cleane that is borne of a woman? Iohn Baptist was sanctified in
the wombe of his mother,
                  Iob 25. and was bred
vp from a child in the wildernesse. Saint Peter was he that loued
most,No man free from sinne. Saint Iohn that
was most beloued, Saint Paul past through the third heauen, and did
afterwards defie all the world: Who shall separate me from the loue of
Christ? And Iob was so bold to say, Would my sinnes were
weighed in a ballance▪ &amp;c. And in another place, Shew mee my
sinnes and my iniquities what they be. Also Dauid, I haue run without
iniquitie. Iudith passing through the midst of an Armie of Barbarians,
breakes out into these words, The Lord liueth that would not suffer his
handmaid to be defiled; There was not that rough-hewne souldier, that did
so much as offer to touch her. Let vs set side by side with these Saints, the
vnspottednesse of those Virgins, the constancie of those Martyrs, and the
courage of those Confessors that suffered for Christs sake. In a word, all the
worthy squadrons of those blessed Saints that are now in heauen will say thus
(as Saint August. hath noted) of themselues, which Saint Iohn
did confesse, If we say we haue no sinne, we deceiue our selues, and the
truth is not in vs. As also Iob, If I wash my selfe with snow water,
and purge my hands most cleane, yet shalt thou plunge me in the pit, and mine
owne cloathes shall make me filthie.
               
                  Iob
  9.30. 
                For, to be without sinne, is the blazon or
cognisance of God alone.
            Many did liue very well assured of their innocencie in particular
cases; as Iacob, That the Idols of his father in Law Laban,
were not receiued by the seruants of his house. As Beniamin and his
brethren, that Iosephs cup was not in their sacks. Saint
Peter, that he should not deny his Sauiour Christ, had a thousand more
importunate women set vpon him. The Pharisee, he thought with himselfe, I
am not as other men, &amp;c. yet all of them may say with Saint Paul,
I am conscious of nothing to my selfe, yet am I not hereby iustified; for
Gods eyes see that which mans eyes see not. In a word, the noble Acts of the
greatnesse and power of God, as his creating of the world, his conseruing it,
his redeeming of mankinde, his iustifying of soules, his seeing the thoughts of
the heart, his calling things that are not, as if they were, his commanding
the waters, the windes, death and life, and all those other wonderfull things
which Iob specifieth of God, (to whose 38 chapter I referre you) may
make him confidently to say, Quis ex vobis,
               
                  Iob 38. 
               arguet me de peccato, Which of you can
rebuke me of sinne.
            
            
               Which of you can, &amp;c. Saint Chrysostome
saith, That the greatest testimonie of our innocencie, is that of our enemies.
Non est Deus noster, sicut Deus eorum, i
                     •
                  imici nostri sint Iudices; Our God is not as their God, let euen
our enemies bee Iudges; And fit it was, that this testimonie should
precede and goe before, as well in regard of our Sauiours life as his
death.
            
               Two things required in men of eminencie and
  place, conscience, and fameIn regard of his life; for publike persons
that are placed in authoritie, seated in high and eminent throanes, that haue
great gouernments, offices and dignities committed vnto them, are not onely
bound to be vertuous and holy, but also to be so esteemed, which they must
mainely striue and indeauour. So that in a Prince, be he Ecclesiasticall or
Secular, two obligations ought to concur in him.
            One of Conscience.
            The other of Fame.
            
               Publike persons must looke to their fame as
  well as to their conscience.A particular Christian, which doth not giue
occasion whereby to bee condemned of his neighbour, may liue satisfied and
well contented with the testimony of his owne conscience; but not a Prince, or
a Prelate; For if he suffer in his good name, or in his fame, and be ill
reported of, it is the destructionoftheir Subiects. Saint Augustine
saith, That he that relyeth on his conscience, and is carelesse of his good
name, is cruell towards himselfe. We must not doe good onely in Gods sight,
b
                     •
                  t also before men. For fame
(though false) doth fall heauy vpon publike persons. In the Temple, there was a
vessell of brasse, a very faire one, out of which there ran a conduit pipe of
water, and was without adorned with those Looking glasses, which women that
repented them of their sinnes, had offered,Looking-glasses
  why placed about the Lauer of the Temple. who forsaking the world had
consecrated themselues to God, to the end that the Priests which did enter to
offer sacrifice, should wash themselues in that water and behold themselues in
those glasses; and it was Gods intent and purpose (according to
Philon) That they should place no lesse care in the cleanenesse of
their life, for to offer sacrifice, than those women did, in appearing good to
the world: beholding in those glasses the least marke or spot in the face. And
in the 28 chapter of Exodus, God commanded, That when the Priest
should enter or goe foorth in the Sanctuary, he should beare bells about the
border of his garment,The vse of Bel
                     •
                   in the border of the Priests garment. to the
end that the noyse and sound thereof, might make his going in, and his comming
forth knowne. And the Text addeth. Ne moriatur, Least hee dye the
death. And the glorious Saint Gregorie saith, That the vestures
of the Priests, are their good workes: Sacerdotes tui, induantur iustitiam,
Let thy Priests be  cloathed with Righteousnesse:
And these are to sound aloud, being not holy onely in their tongue, but also in
their actions. There must be a bell, and there must be a clapper, preaching and
doing must goe together; one will not doe well without the other. Our Sauiour
Christ aduiseth vs, That we should hide our works, and not make them knowne,
Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth: Least the wind of
vaine-glory chance to blow away the fruit thereof.Priuat
  persons must conceale their workes, but men of publike ranke must shew them
                     •
                  elues examples. Gen.
  39.3. But in a Prince and a Prelat, God would haue their workes to be
more publike, that they should not onely be holy, but also seeme so, for the
good example of the people. God placed Ioseph in the gouernment of
Egypt, because his life was so notoriously good, that his master saw that the
Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his
hand. It is a thing worthy the consideration, That a Slaue in the house of an
Infidell, should professe so much vertue, so much truth, so much faithfulnesse,
so much courtesie, and so much modestie, that he should make him ruler of his
house, and put all that he had in his hand. Oh how well beseeming are these and
the like good things, for the gouernment of a kingdome.
            In regard of his death; and that likewise for many good and great
reasons.
            First, it was fitting,Our Sauiours innocencie
  exemplified by his death. That the testimonie of our Sauiours
innocencie should precede, to the end that it might appeare to the world, that
the Diuell by this his death was robbed and spoiled of his Empire, through his
righteousnes. Saint Augustine deliuereth three things vpon this
point.
            The one, That God did iustly deliuer man ouer to the Empire of the
diuell; for that he suffered himselfe to be ouercome by his subtletie and
cunning.
            The other, That so great is the signiorie and dominion, that the
diuell hath ouer him, that he neither can with all the strength that he hath,
ouercome his temptations, nor auoid death, which he incurred through sinne. Not
that the diuell had any more right or power ouer him, than a hangman hath for
the tormenting of a delinquent, who receiues his command from the Iudge.
            The third and last, which is likewise of Leo, and Saint
Gregory the Pope, That God might very well free man from the slauery
and bondage of the diuell by his vertue and power, without doing the diuell any
wrong. Euen as a Iudge who hath deliuered ouer an offender to the hangman to
torment him, may change his mind and set him free; yet notwithstanding was
willing to treat this busines by way of Iustice, as if the diuell had proper
right thereunto.
            First, for that it had beene but small glorie to Gods greatnes,
that the Creator should 
                  •
               on
                  •
               est with his creature, and an infinite
power with a limited.
            Secondly, That he might not make his iustice suspected.Christs
  equal proceeding against the diuell, a patterne for all Magistrates.
For he that hath the least Iustice on his side, doth now and then flye to his
force and power. The diuell was to be ouercome (saith Saint
Augustine,) by iustice, and not by might. Miro aequitatis iure
certatum est (said Leo the Pope.) Whence the Princes of the earth
may learne this lesson, That sithence the Prince of heauen proceeded so fairely
and so iustly with so base and bad a creature, hauing no tye or obligation
thereunto; let not any Prince of the earth presume to say, Sic volo, sic
iubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas; But rather hearken to that of Iob, If
I refused to be iudged with my seruant, &amp;c.
            
            Besides, it is to be noted, That the diuell did exceede his
Commission; and that God hauing giuen him power for to torment sinners, he fell
a tormenting of our Sauiour Christ, who was most innocent; he pursued him to
the death, till he had placed him vpon the Crosse. The cause was propounded in
the Tribunall of the most blessed Trinitie, the diuell was condemned and
depriued of that  power which was giuen him. And so is
that place of Saint Paul to be vnderstood, De peccato damnauit
peccatum:
                  Ioh. 11. And that of Saint
Iohn, Now is the iudgement of this world; now shall the Prince of it be
cast out. That hapned to the diuell, which bef
                  •
               ll Adam, God gaue him free
leaue and full liberty to inioy all the trees in Paradise, saue one onely and
no more; and he onely pitcht his palat vpon that, and tasted but of that one,
and no more. God gaue the diuell leaue to tempt all, onely interdicting him,
That he should not touch vpon our Sauiour Christ, and yet he pusht most at him.
And to the end that this fault and punishment of the diuell should remaine
notorious to the world,The Crosse and death of Chri
                     •
                  ttormented the diuell more than himselfe. it was fit that
the testimony of his innocencie should goe before, and that he should say,
Quis ex vobis, &amp;c. Which of you, &amp;c. Guaricus saith, That the
death &amp; Crosse of our Sauiour Christ, was more the diuells death and crosse
than his. For our Sauiour Christ rose again the third day, but the diuell neuer
since was able to lift vp his head. And as two going forth vpon a challenge
into the field, are vsually both run through and slaine; so our Sauiour Christ
and the diuel were both nayled to the Crosse: Christ to his greater glory, the
diuell to his vtter destruction.
            
               If I say the truth, why doe ye not beleeue me? The truth
is the Blanke and Marke of our vnderstanding; and being that man ought
naturally to loue it, it is a metaphisicall case that he should come to
abhorre it. In satisfaction of which difficulty, we haue already rendered
three reasons: Whereunto we may here adde that other which our Sauiour Christ
gaue vnto the Pharisees by Saint Iohn,
               
                  Ioh.
  8. 
               Yee seeke to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.
There are some stomackes so ouerladen with euill humours, That they no sooner
receiue good meate, but they vomit it vp againe, and by a depraued disposition,
turne that which is sweet into sowernes: In like sort, there are some soules so
full of hatred, enuy, couetousnesse, and vncleanenesse, that they rise at Gods
truths, and are ready to spue them vp, though they be sweeter then the hony
or hony-combe. To him that is sicke of a Quartane, the brawne of a Capon
is vnsauourie; but a pickled pilchard, a strong onyon, and a piece of powdered
beefe, haue an excellent rellish with him. To a brest surcharged with the
things of this world, of force the doctrine of heauen must be vnsauoury. Eyes
that are couered with clouds as with a curtaine, hate the light, and cannot
endure the splendour of the Sun, Bonitatem, &amp; disciplinam, &amp;

                  ares of men than flatteries and
  lies.And from hence ariseth one of the greatest abuses in all the world,
to wit, That we are readier to beleeue an enemie that lyes vnto vs, than a
friend that tells vs the truth. In all Arts, either Li
                  ••

               redit to them that are therein
most eminent; As to the best Diuine, the best Physitian, the best Lawyer, and
to him that is our best friend, because we are fully persuaded that he will not
deale doubly with vs, but deliuer vs the very truth, and represent things as
they are. In the saluation of the soule, we will not beleeue our Sauiour, who
is the best Artist, and our best friend; but the diuell, the world and the
flesh, which are our three mortall enemies. The first, being the father of
lyes, the first cause and first inuenter of them, that is to say, Ex
proprijs loquitur, out of his owne Mynt he coynes them; the other two haue
inherited and professed lying time out of mind, fiue thousand yeares agoe, and
vpward. If it be not as I tell you▪ tell me I pray, when did the world
treat truth? Salomon stiles it Diuitem mendacem,
               The World, the Flesh, 
                     •
                  nd the Diuell, all lyars. 
               A rich lyar. As for the
flesh, when did that euer leaue off to lye? it was one of Sampsons
fooleries, That he knowing the intention of his false hearted Dalila,
and that her purpose was, to deliuer him vp into the hands of the Philistims,
and hauing thrice caught her with the theft (as we say) in her hand, 
 yet for all this faire warning, would not take better
heede, but melting with two drops, two poore teares that trickled downe her
cheekes, stickt not to reueale vnto her the secret of his strength, and where
it lay. And Dalila complaining, Thou hast thrice beguiled me,
and told me lyes, yet this good honest man neuer titted her in the teeth with
her lightnes, and her treason. It is a strange kind of blindnes, That thy flesh
should commit so many treasons, and poppe thee in the mouth with so many lies,
and yet thou shouldest still beleeue her. But the Moores beleeue
Mahomet who lyes vnto them; The Gentiles, those Idols that deceiue
them; and onely Christ comes to be the descreydo, a man of no credit
among vs, and to whom we will not giue beleefe. S. Bernard talking in
his name with a Christian, askes him the question, Why doest thou more affect
my enemie, and thine, than me? I did create thee, I did redeeme thee with my
blood, I did beare thee vp in the palmes of my hands; Sure it is, because thy
soule is full of euill humours. A foole receiues not the words of Wisedome,
vnlesse thou tell him that which is in his owne heart. It is Salomons,
As is an house that is destroyed,
               
                  Prou.
  18. 
               so is wisedome vnto a foole.
               
                  Eccl. 21. There is nothing more pleasing and
peaceable than a well built house, and nothing more vnpleasing and vnpeaceable,
than an old ruinous house that is ready to fall. And so is wisedome to a
foole.
            
               If I say the truth, &amp;c. One of the most lamentable
miseries of this age is, That truth doth not carry that credit and estimation
as a lye doth. As the true sores of a poore wretched creature doth not mooue
mans heart to that pittie, as your false ones doe: so truth doe not generally
goe so farre as doth a lye. For a lye is no sooner sowne, but it presently
growes vp, and spreads it selfe amaine. ô good God, how easily is it
beleeued, how willingly entertained! Our Sauiour Christ being risen, the High
Priests, and other the Prelates of those times, persuaded the souldiers, that
were set to gard the graue, that they should giue it out, that his Disciples
had stolne him away. But how my Masters (replyde the souldiers) can we doe this
without danger to our selues, or be able to answer the matter? For if the
President should call vs to account, and examine vs about it, eyther we must
answer that we were asleepe, and testigos dormidos (you know) no
hazen 
                     •
                  e, Sleeping witnesses
will not be admitted for proofe, nor stand good in Law: Or that his Disciples
did set vpon vs, and tooke him thence by force, which likewise will hardly be
beleeued, and will not sound halfe handsomely. First, that silly fishermen
should set vpon souldiers; Secondly, the stone not being taken away, we cannot
well auouch that they stole him away; yet notwithstanding the Clergie were
instant vpon them, and told them, doe you but say as we bid you, and it is
enough: for, If it come to the Presidents eare, we will worke with him well
enough. Whereupon hauing withall well greased their fists, they published
the theft. And the glorious Euangelist Saint Matthew tells vs,
                  Mat 28. 
               This saying is noysed amongst the
Iewes vnto this day. The like passeth in point of Heresie: What hath
ruined so many Kingdomes, destroyed so many Churches,What
  mischiefes haue proceeded from lying. and tormented so many Saints,
but the lyes of your Arch-Heretikes, who will not pardon God himselfe? In a
word, God was to come into the world, for to giue testimony of the truth:
Whereas for the receiuing of a lye, one wicked mans asseueration is
sufficient. Osee saith, That there is no truth in the earth, no mercy,
no knowledge of God, but that all is lies, thefts, murders, and adulteries.
Mendacium, furtum, homicidium inundauerunt. Where the word

within it's bounds, the wayes are free and open to all; But when it leapes out
of his bed, and ouerflowes the fields, and the high wayes, you know not in 
 the world how to finde sure footing, nor where you or
your horse may safely tread. There were euermore lyes in the world, but now
they haue broken their bounds in that strange manner, and leapt so farre from
forth their bed, that no man well knowes which way to take. What a world of
Euidences did Dauid shew vnto Saul of his loue vnto him? What
notable seruices did he doe him, in that hi
                  •
                single combat against Goliah? In getting so many
victories against the Philistims? In playing vnto him vpon the harpe when the
diuell tormented him? Afterward Saul pursuing him in the mountaines,
hunting after his death, as if he had beene a beare, or wild bore, once
Dauid tooke away his speare, and the pot of water that stood at his
beds head; another time he cut off the lappet of his garment. This

               ted. And S. Iohn doth diuide
al the whole world into two sorts of persons, Qui ex deo est, non peccat,
qui peccat ex diabolo est. The children of God, and the children of the
diuell; The one heares Gods Word, the other heares it not. And though this be
not a sence so sutable to the Text, because Christ doth there point out the
immediat cause of that their incredulitie, and that this was not so much a
predestination or reprobation, as that their present hardnesse of heart, and
vnbeleefe; yet notwithstanding I must giue you to vnderstand, That to heare the
word of God, is a great Prenda and pledge of our predestination;
especially, being accompanyed with these foure concurring circumstances.
            The first is, Audire, To

                     •
                  eare the word· Blessed are
they that heare the word of God.
               Foure circumstances
  requi
                     •
                  red to the hearing of Gods
  Word. This is the first step. And he that doth not put forward a foot to
this, is not to be accounted a child of God. The husbandman in the Gospell
sow'd his seed in foure seuerall parts of the ground; and if in any one of them
hee forbare to sow, it was because he did not take it to be his. Many birds are
taken and delighted with the light, as your partridges and your pigeons: But
your wolfes, beares, bores, and other wild beasts flye from it all that they
can. It is Chrysostomes note, That when God went about to catch
Paul, the light went afore the voyce. For the voyce will affright the
blind; but the light will make him in loue therewith. Saint Paul
preaching to the Iewes, said, The light of the Gospell was principally
ordained for you, But seeing ye put it from yee, ye iudge your selues
vnworthy of euerlasting life.
               
                  Act. 13.
And treating of the Gentiles, he saith, That they did glorifie the Word of God,
and that they did beleeue it and giue credit thereunto. And when the Gentiles
heard it, they were glad (saith the Apostle) and glorified the word of the
Lord; and as many as were ordained vnto eternall life, beleeued, I am the
way, the truth and the life. And he that looseth this way, looseth the
truth, and looseth life euerlasting.
            The second is, A
                     •
                  dire cum frequentia, To heare the word frequently and very
often. The earth that is extraordinary dry and scorched with heat, the
drops of water which it receiueth, it turneth into toades. And hee that seldome
frequents sermons, it is to be feared they worke little good vpon him, if not
turne to his hurt. Many will come to heare Sermons, but with a preiudicate
opinion, and are more carefull to picke a quarrell against the Preacher, than
profit themselues. The franticke patient that throwes stones at the Physitian
that cures him, puts himselfe  in great p
                  •
               rill. In a word, The Word of God is the
Soules sustenance, and being ministred slowly, it is no meruaile if it fall
into a Consumption.
            The third is, Audire cum attentione, To heare diligently,
and with attention, freeing the soule from all worldly cares and incumbrances:
for as the eyes cannot ioyntly and at once, behold both Heauen and Earth; so
the Soule cannot attentiuely at one and the same time, behold the things of
the World, and of God, If any man loue the world, the loue of the Father
abideth not in him. When a great and principall Riuer is diuided into many
Riuolets or little streames, so much the lesse water will euerie one of them
haue. The like succeedeth with that heart which is diuided into many cares and
desires, Foolish and noysome lusts drowne men in perdition and
destruction. And Salomon saith,1.
  Tim. 6. 
               When thou sittest with a Prince, obserue what is
before thee, and put thy knife vnto thy throat, if thou bee a man giuen to thy
appetite. A Christians sitting at the King of Heauens Table, is the
hearing of his Doctrine; this is that Boord whereunto Wisedome
inuiteth vs. Where the Bread of wholesome Doctrine is set before thee,
                  Prou. 23. which strengthneth the heart of man, and
the Wine of Grace, which cheereth and comforteth the heart: At which Table
whosoeuer shall come to sit, must consider with attention that which is set
before him, casting out of his mind all other worldly things. Those Ministers
that were imployed for the apprehending of our Sauiour Christ, finding him
preaching to the People, they hearkened vnto him with that earnest and diligent
attention, that they had quite forgot to put that in execution which was giuen
them in charge by the Pharisees: and being demanded by them, Why did yee
not bring him along with you? They returned this answer, Neuer any
man spake as he spake. The glorious Doctor Saint Augustine,
before that he had vnwinded himselfe out of the errour of the Mani
                  •
               hees, hee went of purpose to heare
Saint Ambrose, but not with intention to giue any credit to his
Doctrine, but to delight himselfe with the elegancie of his phrase, and being
rauished with the sweetnesse of his words, had his heart taken, as well as his
e
                  •
               re; his attention supplied the
fault of his intention; this was that putting of the knife to the throat. The
glorious Apostle Saint Paul goes a little further, and calls Gods
Word, not only Cultrum, but Gladium, not a Knife, but a
Sword, Take vnto thee the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of
God: What then? Marrie he giues thee a caueat in these insuing words,
Si tamen habes in potestate anima
                     ••
                   tuam, That thy soule be not distracted with the troublesome
businesses of this world. Saint Chrysostome compares the soule of the
Iust, to a Poole of Water which stands all alone in some low Valley, where
there is all stilnesse,The soule of the just, &amp; that of
  a sinner, wherein differing. reposednesse, freshnesse, cleerenesse,
and the Sunne-beames purest brightnesse. Salomon likeneth the Soule of
a sinner, to a troubled and tempestuous Sea, The heart of the Wicked is as
a raging sea.
            
            The fourth is, Audire cum conseruatione, To heare with a
retention, and to lay vp the Word of God in our hearts, Blessed are
they that heare the Word of God, and keepe it; Not they who heare the Word
of God, and forget it, taking it in at one eare, and letting it out at another;
but they which heare it and keepe it. It is Saint Gregories
obseruation, That the Physition doth despaire of that Patients stomacke, that
cannot keepe it's meat, but throwes it vp as soone as it receiueth it. Saint
Chrysostome aduiseth, That he that heareth a Sermon should doe as he
doth that comes out of a Bath, presently to retyre himselfe, get him to his
Chamber, there keep
                  •
                himselfe
warme, wrap good store of cloathes about him, that the ill humors may the
better be exhaled and drawne from him. Plutarch telleth vs, That many
take no pleasure in Flowers, or care any further for them, than to 
 looke vpon them, smell to them, and haue them in their
hands; bu
                  •
                the Bee drawes from them
both honie and wax, and the Apothecarie makes many medicines of them against
diuers and sundrie diseases. Many heare Sermons onely for their pleasure, for
the elegancie of the stile, delicacie of words, grauity of sentences, and the
gracefulnesse in their deliuerie: but this is but to make a nosegay to smell
to for a while, and cast it anon after into a corner.
            
               Men are neuer worse, than when they thinke all
  is well.
               Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritane, and hast a
Deuill? One of the greatest miseries than can befall a Soule, is, To
become so appassionated to it's own disagreeable disposition, it's disjoynted
iudgement, and erronious opinion, that it persuadeth it selfe, that it
proceedeth prudently and wisely in all that it doth, not sticking to say in
it's heart, I thanke God I haue my wits about me, I am in the right way, I doe
well in this and in that, in persecuting this man, and bringing that other to
the stake; flattering and soothing vp themselues with a N
                     •
                  me benedicimus? Do we not do wel
in so doing? The phrantick man vseth to cal the Physition that cures him,
Foole; the Blockhead, him that is discreet, Cockescombe; the Ruffian, him that
is religious, Distracted; and heere the Pharisees accuse our Sauiour Christ, to
haue a Deuill, and to be a breaker of the Law: And it were well if they would
stay here, but they make the matter farre worse by saying, Say we not
well? To sinne, is not so great an ill, as to ground our sinne vpon
reason; not so great a fault to commit it, as it is to maintaine it; it is an
euil thing, to worke reuenge, but farre worse to seeke to defend thy reuenge by
reason, for that is but to wage an argument against God and his Law; to denie
vnto him Prouidence and Wisedome, and to firme and set as it were vnder thine
own hand, That God did not see so much reason as thou didst, to reuenge thy
selfe, alledging in fauour thereof, some particular exception (more than God
did euer wot of) against this his generall rule. Passion (saith
Aristotle) blinding Reason, as smoke doth the eyes, maketh white
seeme blacke. Enuie so blinded Iosephs brethren, that the Scripture
saith, That they could not affoord him a g

                     •
                  rd, nor
speake vnto him in a mild and ciuile manner; but in this their malicious
humour were fully persuaded that they did him no wrong at all, first in
throwing him into the pit, and afterwards in selling him. Zoylus the
Rhethorician, sy
                  •
               amed the Dog, for
his foule mouth and euill language, would raile against Plato,
Socrates, and other graue Phylosophers; and being asked the reason, Why
hee should wrong these good men?Passion alters all
  properties to it selfe. answered, For myne owne part, I could haue beene
content to haue spared such good people, but Passion would not giue way
thereunto. O this Passion, What an euill propertie it hath; it makes
Innocencie Sinne; Christ, a Witch; God, a Deuill. Clemens
Alexandrinus reporteth of Antisthenes, That he had rather be a
mad, than a passionate man; for the passionate man will seeke a knot in a
bulrush,Better to be mad, than passionate. so will
not the mad man. In conclusion, when a man shall secure himselfe in his sinne,
and the Soule goe confidently on to it's owne perdition, yet persuades it selfe
that it is in the right, and runnes on fairely towards the goale; that man,
and his Soule, should be thus blinded, Saint Cyprian saith, That it
is a great and strong euidence of Gods anger; for such not acknowledging their
errour, will hardly craue pardon: besides, the passionate man liues so secure,
and yet so deceiued, that those of Hell do not make a more rash censure of the
Iust: Nos insensati, vitam illorum estimabamus insa
                     •
                  iam.
            
            
               Say we not well, &amp;c. God doth not say so, nor the
Angells, nor He
                  •
               uen, nor Earth; but
we 
                  •
               ay so, we that are Pharisees
say so, and thinke we say well in so saying. There are a certaine kind of men
that would seeme to know more than God himselfe: When some man of power, or
some great rich person shall say,  I know it is so; it is
receiued as Gods Oracle, though God oftentimes betrayes their ignorance to the
world, to shew them their errour. It is a great hau
                  •
               ines and pride of heart in any man, to
stand so much vpon the authoritie of his person, as to say, Basta,
qúe yo lo diga, It is enough, that I haue sayd it. Pilat saw no
cause why he should crucifie our Sauior Christ; but the Pharisees roundly told
him, it is enough, that we haue deliuered him vp into thy hands, without thy
further enquiring into the cause. The Deuill when he cannot persuade a sinne
by reason, he alledgeth the authoritie of some noted person or other, and by
how many great and graue men it is approoued, &amp;c. Suting with that of
Seneca, Insanientium multitudo, est sanitatis protectio.
            
            
               I haue not a Deuill, &amp;c. Other whiles our Sauiour
nipt the Pharisees, tooke them vp short, and vsed sharpe reprehensions to them;
as, You are of your father the Deuill, a wicked and adulterous Generation,
&amp;c. But here he is as mild with them as a Lambe, and makes them this
soft and gentle answer, I haue not a Deuil. Which temperate behauiour
of his was grounded vpon three reasons:
            First of all, because he that vpon the vying of an iniurie will
not (though he haue the better cards in his hand, and that it bee in his power
to put the other to the worst) reuie vpon him, but let it passe, manifests to
the world a more noble and more glorious testimonie of his mildnesse and
patience, than he that suffereth and endureth when he cannot otherwise chuse,
wanting not so much will as power to reuenge a receiued wrong.Patience when most to be applauded. That is a generous
patience, when a man hath a smooth and easie way to worke reuenge, and yet
rather chuseth to pocket than to presse an iniurie. On the Vigiles of our
Sauiours beeing apprehended, our Sauiour Christ sayd vnto his Apostles,
                  Luc. 22. 
               Hee that hath none, let him sell his
coat and by a sword. Whereupon sayth Saint Ambrose, Sweet Iesus,
Why Swords, beeing thou wilt not giue thy Apostles leaue to draw them? and wert
angrie with Peter, and didst reprooue him for drawing his sword in thy
defence? Whereunto this glorious Doctour maketh vs this answere, That their
patience might appeare more noble, by hauing Swords by their sides, and yet not
offering to draw them. Let a Christian therefore weare a Sword, but let him not
vnsheath his sword, to the end that all men may see, that if he doe not reuenge
an iniurie, it is not for want of a weapon to right himselfe, but out of a
superaboundance of sufferance and patience. Isiodorus Pelusiota
disputing the reason why Christ cursed the Fig-tree, leauing it fruitlesse for
euer, Neuer man eat fruit of thee hereafter while the world standeth,
saith,
                  Marc. 11.1. That the Iewes considering
those innumerable myracles which our Sauiour wrought, and more particularly for
the good and benefit of that people, might happely presume, That Christ had
power to doe good, but not to doe hurt: and therefore that it might appeare
vnto them, that hee had power of and ouer all, howbeit he did not in many of
them punish their wickednesse and ingratitude, yet did he punish it in the
Fig-tree, which was their true type and figure.
            Secondly, Christ would teach vs this lesson,To
  suffer iniuries a great noblenesse. That the best meanes to breake
anger in an enemie, and to assuage his choller, are either soft words, or
silence. Saint Chrysostome saith, That to giue a faire and gentle
answere to an angrie man, is more than to prophesie of that which is to come;
for the gift of Prophecying God giues it Grati
                     •
                  , and it costs the Receiuer nothing; but to suffer
an Enemie, costeth much. Gregorie Nazianzen expounding that place of
Saint Luke, Vnto him that smiteth thee on the one cheeke, offer also
the other; addeth further, If thou hadst three cheekes, thou oughtst to offer
them all for to keepe him quiet. But some man will say, When that Varlet, that
base  Slaue smote Christ in 
                  
                     •
                  aiphas his house, he did not offer him his other
cheeke, but told him as one th

was sencible of the wrong he had done him, If I

                     •
                  aue euill spoken,
               
                  Iob. 18. 
               beare witnesse of the euill; but if I
haue well spoken, why smitest thou me? Saint Augustine answereth
hereunto, that to turne the other cheeke to an angrie man, is not so much to be
vnderstood de parte operis, as de preparatione animi, No
                     •
                   in regard of the worke, by offering
the cheeke, as of the preparation of our mind; for that were but to put a
sword into a mad mans hand. And in another place he saith, That it is an
hyperbolicall kind of speech, for that Christ did pretend, That hee that is
offended should be so farre from reuenging a receiued iniurie, that hee should
rather willingly receiue a new, than reuenge an old wrong: And therfore if our
Sauiour Christ returned this answer to that rude and rough-handed Souldier,
(
                  
                     •
                  ur me caedis? Why smitest
thou me?) it was either because this his flattery, which he was willing to
expresse to the High Priest by this his crueltie, should not thereby be
authorised, or because it might not be presumed, that Christ had lost the
respect due to the Priest; or because that no man should suspect, that there
remained any rancor in his brest, or desire of reuenge, (which they that heard
him say, That the Sonne of Man should come with power and Maiestie, and that he
had another Kingdome, where legions of Angels should shew themselues for to
doe him honour, might well suspect;) or peraduenture he returned him that
answer for to pacifie him, itbeing so mild

                  •
               nd gentle. In a word, The Rocke in
the Sea,A patient man whereunto resembled. the
Anuile in the Forge, the Iust in the earth, continue stil quiet; the one
enduring the waues, and suffering the surges of the seas; the other the strokes
of the hammers, and the third, the iniuries of his enemies. My enemies haue
compassed me about like so many Bees, so many Buls, and so many Dogs, grinning
their teeth at me, but it neither troubles me nor grieues me, for I am
sufficiently reuenged of them. Saint Augustine doth here aske
the question, How (ô thou Kingly Prophet) art thou reuenged of them?
Marrie, by instructing them in the truth, and by dissuading them from their
errours. Iob hauing receiued great iniuries from his friends, as
taunting words, and false testimonies, the reuenge that he tooke of them, was,
To pray vnto God for them, and to giue them good and wholesome councell,
                  Iob 
                  
                     •
                  .
as Saint Gregorie hath noted it, Flie therefore from the face of
the sword.
            
            Thirdly, he read a Lecture vnto Princes and Prelates, of that
mildnesse and gentlenesse; which they ought to professe towards their Subiects.
Saint Bernard saith, That if Christ did condemne Peter for
drawing his sword, when they came to lay hands on his Master, and for cutting
off of Malchus his eare, it was, That Choller did not well become him,
who was afterwards to be a Gouernor of the Church, where he should meete with
many a Malchus. There is not any thing that doth more conserue
Scepters and Crownes, than clemencie and truth. Alexander Seuerus was
so soft and mild an Emperour,Clemencie, a profitable
  vertue. that some did murmure thereat, saying, he would draw his Empire
into contempt, and be lesse esteemed of his Subiects. Whereunto he answered,
Though it should be of lesse esteeme, I am sure it will be more secure and
durable.
            Saint Augustine, Saint Gregorie, and Saint
Ierome, make this doubt, Why our Sauiour did not as well reply to
their calling of him Samaritane, as for tel
                  ••
               ng him that he had a diuell: And they resolue it thus, That
concerning these two iniuries, the one was an affront done to his person, the
other to his Doctrine: for the wrong that was done to his doctrine, because it
touched the honour of his father hee was bound to answer thereunto. For a
seruant must not bee silent, much lesse a sonne, in the agrauios, and
iniuries that are done  vnto God. God promised
Moses to make him a Captaine and Gouernour of another more noble and
more honourable Nation, desiring that he might cut off and make an end at once
of that rebellious people. But Moses besought him, saying, My good
Lord, this were a great honour for me, but I am content to forgoe it, because
thou shalt suffer in thine honour if thou destroy this people,
                  Exod. 32. 
               Least the Egyptians speake, and say,
he hath brought them out malitiously for to slay them in the mountaines,
and to consume them from off the earth. This were but to run the censure of
euill tongues, and the hazard of thine honour. Our Sauiour Christ did not
resent any thing so much as affronts and dishonours; this made him to breake
forth into this passionat speech, Ye went out with swords and

                     ••
                  aues to take me, as if I had beene

               o fully as thou. To these shall we
adde that other, Saturabitur opprobrijs; all his other torments made
him still more and more hungrie, and abated not the edge of his stomacke; but
he was glutted with his reproches, and the affronts that were offered him, he
had his bellie too full of them, more than hee was well able to beare.Gods honour must euer be preferred before our own. Amongst
other causes of that his mysterious swea

               ing of bloud in the Garden, the Saints set downe this as the most
principall, That the dishonour did there represent it selfe vnto him, of seeing

faithful friend, hauing recourse to the bashful modestie of the whole bodie, as
it is woont vpon some occasions to haue recourse vnto the heart. In a word, hee
did euermore giue approued pledges &amp; tokens of the great reckoning that he
made of his honour: but when his Fathers lay at stake, he was forgetfull of his
owne; And therefore not answering to that of Samaritanus es tu, Thou art a
Samaritan; he mildly replied, Ego Daemonium non habeo, I haue not a
Deuill, but I honour my Father, &amp;c.
            
            
               I seeke not mine owne praise, but there is one that seeketh
it, and iudgeth.
               Truth can neuer be altogether
  supprest. Ye seeke to blot my name out of the worlds memory, and to
burie my honor and authority with the infamie of a Witch, a Sorcerer, a
Diuell, and a Glutton. And though I doe not seeke to repaire this wrong,
There is one that seeketh after it and iudgeth. There is not any thing
so hid and buried, that, though it lie couered for a time, is not in the end
discouered. Of Fire and of Loue, Vlisses sa

them? but the same may be better verified of the Truth. Well may falshood and
passion, assisted by tyranny and power, hide and bury it selfe, but in the end,
There is nothing so secret but shall be reuealed:
                  Mat. 10. For time is a great discouerer of truths.
Plutarch reporteth in his Apothegmes, That at the sacrifices of
Saturne (whom they adored for the god of Time) the Priests had their
heads couered till the Sacrifice was fully ended; a ceremonie which was not
suffered by any other of the gods: And the mystery thereof was, That Time doth
couer things now and then for a while, but discouers them at last. And
therefore Pindarus said, That the latter dayes were the faithfullest
witnesses. Time sometime sleepeth, but it awakes againe. But in case it fall
asleep, and neuer wake any more, Est qui quaerat, &amp; iudicet, God
is still ready at hand, who searching out the truth, will iudge his owne
cause.

            The one, the bottom of the Sea.
            The other, the bowels of the Earth.
            Into the Sea, many Tyrants haue throwne the bodies and ashes of
the Saints, to the end, that being deuoured by fishes, or drowned in the deepe,
they might  not be adored on earth, as we may reade in
the History of Saint Cl

            In the earth men burie the Dead; Highway Robbers, their spoyls;
Theeues, their thefts; they that are either subdued by conquest, or banished
their country, their treasure; as Cacus did those cowes he had stolne
in his caue. But God causeth those things that are the heauiest and the
weightiest, and cast into the bottome of the Sea, to swim like corke aboue
water; and maketh the earth to vomit forth her most secret and hidden
treasures. For, Nihil occultum, &amp;c. There is nothing so secret which
shall not be reuealed.
            
            
               There is one that seeketh it and iudgeth it. O Lord, Thou
remittest this cause to thy father,Iudges ought to be free
  from passion. and thy father remits all vnto thee. I answer, when I
tooke the rod to reuenge the wrongs and iniuries of the world, I was not to be
like vnto sparks that are quickly kindled, nor subiect to any the least passion
of anger; for a Iudge that is so affected, cannot be a competent Iudge in his
owne cause. And therfore, Est, qui quaerat, &amp; iudicet. My Father
is to redresse this wrong, he is to looke vnto it. Whence I inferre, That if
our Sauiour Christ, in whom there could n
                  •
               t be any kind of passion, did remit to his Father the iudging of
his cause; hardly can a Iudge of flesh sentence his owne cause. King
Dauid being at the point of death, willed his sonne Salomon
that he▪ should take away the liues of Ioab and Shimei:
He thereupon caused Ioab to be slaine; but onely confined
Shimei. The reason that induced him to mittigate Shimei his
sentence, and not that of Io
                     •
                  b, was, because the offences which Ioab had
committed, were not done directly against his father Dauid, but
against Abner and Amasa, whom he had ill killed; Whereas
Shimeis fault was, in affronting the Kings person: and because it
might happily be thought that he might be carried away with too much passion or
affection in this his fathers cause, hee deferred his death, till hee should
fall through his owne default, which he afterwards did; and then
Salomon reckoned with him for the old and the new.2. R

  14. The woman of Tekoah receiuing her instructions from Ioab,
entred the Palace, and hauing put on mourning apparell, as a woman that had now
long time mourned for the dead, and falling downe on her face to the ground,
and doing her obeysance, she spake thus vnto him; I am a poore widow, my
husband is dead, and thine handmaid had two sonnes, and they two stroue
together in the field, and there was none to part them, so the one smot the
other and slew him: And behold, the whole family is risen against thine
handmaid, crying out, Deliuer him that smot his brother that we may kill him
for the soule of his brother whom he slew, that we may destroy the heyre also;
So shall they quench my sparkle that is left, and shall not leaue to mine
husband neither name nor posteritie vpon the earth; and I my selfe shall
remaine a miserable mother, not hauing any child left me to be a stay and
comfort vnto me in my old dayes, Woe is me that I must be depriued of both
my sons in one day. The King pittying her wretched condition, said vnto
her: I will take order for the freeing of thy sonne. And to send her away well
satisfied, vowed vnto her, by that his vsuall asseueration (as the Lord liueth)
there shall not one haire of thy sonne fall to the earth. Whereupon she taking
her leaue, said vnto him, Let my Lord the King shew himselfe as free from
passion in his owne proper cause, as he hath in another mans: Wilt thou free my
sonne that hath slaine his brother, and wilt thou not free Absalon
that slew Ammon? Rupertus saith, That E

                  es hurt consisted in the misprision of the fruit,
and the ill iudgement that shee made in the choice of the apple: For being too
much wedded to her owne appearing good opinion, the eyes of the body persuaded
those of the soule, that  in so faire a fruit, it was
impossible to find death.
            
               Then tooke they vp sto
                     •
                  es to cast at him. Tyranny and persecution, euermore attended
the Saints of God: But there was this difference betwixt them and our Sauiour
Christ, That your Tyrants did seeke to reduce these other to the adoring of
their gods, one while with promises, another while by threatnings; now with
curtesies and kindnesses, and by and by againe with sundry sor
                  •
               s of torments. There was scarce any
famous Martyr which did not tread in his martyrdome in this path; nor any
Tyrant which did not take this course with them. And perhaps they followed
herein the steps of Nebuchadnezzar, who, (as the glorious Doctor Saint
Chrysostome hath obserued) for those who would not adore his Statue,
had a hot fierie furnace, whose flames ascended forty nine cubits in heigth;
and for those that did adore it, he had all sorts of exquisite musicke and
choice instruments: warring against vertue with pleasure,
                  Daniel 3. and with paine. But our Sauiour Christ
was alwayes ill intreated by the world. In the desart, the diuell once offered
him stones; The Pharisees many times. When he was borne in Bethlem, he had not
wherewithall to defend him from the cold, but was forced to be laid in the
cratch among the beasts. Whilest he liued here in the world, he had not any to
relieue his hunger. The day that hee entred in Triumph into Ierusalem, he went
forth into the field to seeke after figs. Dying, he had not any one that would
giue him so much as a iarre of water, when he cryed out Sitio, I
thirst, they gaue him vinegre and gall to drinke. Pope Leo saith of
him, The dayes that were appointed for him, he began them in persecution,
and ended them in persecution. In his infancie, he began with the Crosse,
and at his end he dyed on the Crosse. Which was (as Gregorie Nazi
                     •
                  nzen saith) a Prognostication,
That that Disciple that will seeke to follow his master, shall neuer want a
crosse to carry, nor matter wherein to suffer.
            
               But Iesus hid himselfe, and went out of the Temple.
               Why Christ withdrew himselfe from the Pharisees. Vpon this
place we haue formerly rendered foure reasons, why our Sauiour Christ auoyded
these 
                  •
               tones by flight; and now
adding others anew thereunto, Orig
                     •
                  n saith, That hee withdrew himselfe, out of compassion,
considering that his counsells made the Pharisees more rebellious and more
hard than before. Rebellem non vult perdere, Hee shund the occasion,
that they might not be vtterly lost, accommodating himselfe to that of Saint
Paul, D

                     •
                  cum ira, Giue way to anger. One of
Gods great mercies is to flye from a sinner, that hee may not bee bound
sodainly to destroy him. In Exodus, he gaue his people an Angell to
be their guide; saying, I will neyther be your Captaine, nor your Guide,
for through your stiffe-neckednesse and rebellion, ye will runne great hazard
vnder my command. In some Parables, the holy Euangelists put the word,
Peregrè profectus est, He is gone afarre off. For albeit God be
alwayes present, yet it is his exceeding great mercy now and then not to bee
present. For there is no compatibilitie with his diuine presence, and our
shamelesnes and loosenes of life. And so putting on as it were a kind of
dissimulation, he makes as if he went away from vs, and did not see what we
doe.
            
               Euthymius saith, That our Sauiour Christ would rather
exercise his patience in flying, than his power in punishing, Fugiendo
magis, quam puniendo. For although he should haue destroyed thē, yet
would they neuer the sooner haue repented; Complying with that of the Prophet
Esay, Dissipati neque cōpuncti. In the garden he made those that came
to take him to 
                  •
               eele and fall on
their backs, with an Ego sum, I am he. But they not acknowledging this
his diuine power, proceeded on in their apprehending of him.A hard heart can neuer be mollified. God deliuer vs from
the resolution of a Reprobate, for there is not that miracle either in heauen
or on earth, that will  bridle and restraine him. Of
those which began to build the Towet of Babel, the Scripture saith, Nor
will they yet leaue off. But such is the goodnes of Gods nature, and is so
kind and louing vnto vs, That hee doth to the ill good, though they turne this
good to 
                  〈◊〉
               . But he does not doe
any ill vnto them; for his patience is such, That he doth not thinke it much,
that euen those that were most ill, should inioy some good. Hugo de sancto
victore, declareth that place of the Prouerbs,
                  Prou. 26.

               ll amend by reprehension, giue it him:
but if there be no hope of amendment, giue it him not. God doth commonly treat
of the most good, and the least ill; but the wicked man, of the least good, and
the most ill. Wherein, he prooues worse than Pilat; For he laboured to
set our Sauiour Christ at liberty, vsing the meanes for the effecting of it, to
haue him well whipt,

               I will

               ented with that, but went on in
accomplishing the greatest sinne that was euer committed in the world.
            Pope Gregory saith, That our Sauiour Christ hid
himselfe and went out of the Temple, flying from the stones which they
were about to fling at him, for to shew, That the world was all this while in
an errour, in holding it a point of honour,Reuenge in man a
  s
                     •
                  mptome of Cowardize. and
a braue and manly action to answer affronts with affronts, iniuries with
iniuries, and to reuenge them to the full, holding it basenes and cowardize
either to suffer a wrong, or shunne the occasion thereof: Wherein he hath
shewed his great loue vnto vs. For hee applying himselfe to the estimation
which man maketh of his honour, permitteth vs to defend our reputation, though
it be with the hurt of the Aggressor or Assaylant, and that we should not flye
that we might not loose it. So that Christ flying from the Pharisees, and
hiding himself, casting their sinnes behind his backe, whilest he shewed them
his backe; and seeking to hide their faults, by hiding himselfe from them, he
did more for them, than they did for themselues. It is likewise a point of
Honour, That a husband,

                     erem. 3. should not receiue the wife which hath bin
false and treacherous vnto him.
            But God saith, As a woman rebelleth against her husband, so haue
ye rebelled against me; Thou hast played the harlot with many louers, yet
turne againe to me saith the Lord, and I will heale your rebellions. Then
shalt thou call me, saying, my Father, and shalt not turne from mee. To whom
with the Sonne and the Holy Ghost, be all honour, power, &amp;c.

conuinced by those myracles, which were so great both in quality &amp; number,
that they could not be wrought by any but the Messias, whom they had so long
looked for) fearing some alteration both in their State and Religion, and
deuising with themselues, how they might cut off this Good, as if it had beene
some Canker or Plague of the Commonwealth, They sent Officers to take
him. In which Discourse is discouered the force and efficacie of Gods
Word, and how little the industrie and policie of man is able to preuaile
against this Diuine Wisedome.
            
               The High-Priests sent to take him. The motiue hereunto
was their enuie,Enuie of all vices the most vnfortunate to
  it selfe, &amp; fortunate to others. a vice so vnfortunate and so
vnluckie, that accounting for it's felicitie, and for it's good, anothers ill,
commonly the ill raineth downe vpon the head of the Enuious, and the good,
vpon that of the Enuied. Iosephs brethren threw him into a pit, and
then sould him, and all but out of enuie; and this their selling of him, was
the meanes of his excelling of them; and their casting of him downe, the
raising of him vp: thus purposed aduersitie turned to future prosperitie.
Haman that was King Assuerus his Fauorite, had listed Gods
people in seuerall rolles, with a ful resolution to haue them massacred all in
one day; he had set vp a high gallowes whereon to hang Mordochey: this
his enuie was the meanes that Gods people found fauour, Mordochey was
aduanced, and Haman hung on the Gallous which he had made for
another. The like successe had Saul with Dauid; and
Nebucadnezars Princes, with poore Daniel; and the Iewes, with
our Sauiour  Christ: which is no more than was reuealed
in that parable of that Stone, which being reiected by that People, fell vpon
them, and made morter of them; that Stone being afterwards made the head Stone
of the Corner. Of the Lynx the Naturalists doe report, That hee couereth his

               The High-Priests sent, &amp;c. By Saint Mathew
our Sauiour did poynt forth to the Pharisees a truth,
                  Mat. 23. which doth suit well with this present
purpose, W

Scribes and Pharisees, because yee shut vp the Kingdome of Heauen; for yee your
selues goe not in, nor suffer them that would enter, to come in. That
Gardiners Dog that would neither eat Coleworts himselfe, nor suffer others to
eat them, is of the Deuils condition, that will neither do good to himselfe,
nor let others enioy it: And in some respect the Pharisees were far worse; for
the people had not the Deuil for their North-Starre, nor their Guide, neither
did they trust him with the zeale and care of their good: but the Scribes and
Pharisees were the Lights of Israell, the Guides and North-Starres of the
People, who with the clouds of their passions did darken the verie beames of
the Sunne it selfe. Saint Luke crieth out,
                  Luk. 11. 
               Woe be vnto yee Scribes and
Pharisees, yee that are Interpreters of the Law, for yee haue taken away the
Key of knowledge, and of the Scriptures; yee entred not in your selues, and
them that came in, yee forbad; yee will not that any shal controll that
which yee teach. What, doth any one of the Chiefe-Priests and Pharisees
beleeue in him? In the High-Priests and the Pharisees all the wisedome is
deposited, as for the Common people, they are ignorant and vnlettered; if
therefore none of these principall men beleeue in him, let him that beleeueth
in him, goe for a condemned man. From the head comes all the ill to the bodie
Naturall; and mystically the same may be sayd of these and the like Heads.

linked themselues with the daughters of men, with those that were the basest

corrupted the whole land. Phylon reporteth, That Goliah the

Lords, the Law of God commands it: Saint Paul saith, Seruants obey
your Lords according to the flesh, as ye would obey Christ. And Saint

this, he goes a little further and addeth, Tanquam Christo. For, as

            First, because to serue a Lord against a mans King, is Crimen
lesae maiestatis, Treason against a humane Maiestie, so, to serue a king
against God, is treason in the highest degree against a Diuine maiestie.
            Secondly, because your instruments, although they be inanimate and
without a soule, yet God is wont to punish them with a seuere and heauy hand:
As he did the Serpent, Vpon thy belly shalt thou goe,
               
                  Gen. 3. 
               and dust shalt thou eate all the dayes
of thy life. And if vpon the Serpent which sinned not, God doth lay so
heauy a hand; what shall become of that instrument that is a partner and
shar
                  •
               r in the sin? Our Sauiour
Christ cursed the figge-tree: and Athanasius saith, That at that very
time that he curst it,It is bad seruice to share in other
  mens sinnes. it came into his mind that it had couered those with it's
leaues, that had so highly offended him in Paradise. A heauy iudgment for those
that will serue to be cloakes and bawdes to those sinnes which are committed
against God and his holy Lawes.

               Thirdly, God doth permit, that for honest
seruants, and knauish seruants, there should be masters accordingly; masters
that should vse them well, and masters that should vse them ill. And though
for a while till their turnes be serued, they vse them well, inriching them,
and raising them to honour, yet afterwards they come to vse them so ill, that
they eate them out of all that they haue giuen them, calling in that which
they but lent them, and ingaging the
                  •
                for more than they are worth; and at last a fire comes downe from
heauen, and consumes all the wealth that they haue thus vngodly gotten, as it
did vpon those Captaines wh

were imployed by their bad King, against good Eliah.
            
            The Cuttle-fishe is a stampe, or Embleme of your Princes, that
haue a great traine of seruants attending their persons, as this fish hath of
finnes: but deuoures them, as this fish doth his tayle and finnes when he is
hungry.
            
               Our longest life but little.
               Yet am I
a little while with you. He calls little, that little which was now left
him of his life: For he was to suffer about the feasts following, which was now
neere at hand. The longest life, the Scripture stiles little: and the greatest
troubles that we passe therein, likewise little. Antiochus his
Ministers, persuading one of those valiant Machabees, That he would free his
body from those cruell torments which he was to endure,2.
  Mac. 7.36. if that he would obey the king; answered, My
brethren that haue suffered a little paine, are now vnder the diuine Couenant
of euerlasting life. Eleazar rendred the like reason to those his friends
which importuned him, That albeit he would not eat Swines flesh, yet he should
make shew that he did it: Whereunto he replyed, That such dissimulation did not
befit his age and authority,2. Mac. 6.
               Least the younger soule through mine hypocrisie (for a little time of a
transitorie life) might be deceiued by me; I should receiue malediction
and reproch to my gray haires. Saint Peter hath it Modicum passus,
&amp;c. And there are two reasons of this shortnes of life.
            The one, That life in it selfe is short, Ecce mensurabiles
posuisti dies meos, Behold thou hast measured out my dayes. The Greeke
word which answers to mensurabiles, signifieth a measure of foure
fingers.
            
               
                  Iob 9.The other, because it
flyes away swifter than the wind, My dayes haue beene more swift than a
Poste, and haue seene no good thing. They are passed with the most swift sh

                  ps, and as the Eagle that flyeth to the
prey. Va
                     •
                  ablus hath it, As a
Ship that goes as swift as thought, or as the Marriners and Passengers could
wish it; Pagninus, Like a Pyrats man of Warre, which because it goes
light laden, seemes rather to flye than sayle: Or, Like an Eagle that
flyeth to the prey. The Eagle when she is sharpe set, and pursueth her
prey, cuts the ayre with her wings swifter than the wind, so that that which
our Sauiours sayes, is this, Tell the high Priests that sent ye vnto me, that
I haue but a little while to liue, and that when my houre shall come, I my
selfe will put my selfe into their hands; and if that they are so willing to
haue me dye, tell them that I desire it much more.
            
               Christ must be sought while he may be
  found.
               Ye shall seeke me and shall not find me. I came to seeke
you, ye shut the doore vpon me; ye therefore shall seeke me, but ye shall not
find me. Euthymius expoundeth that prophecye of Dauid, of
the Iewes, Conuertentur ad vesperam, &amp; famem patientur vt canes, &amp;
cireuibunt ciuitatem; It shall be so late ere they bee conuerted, that the
world shall be at an end, and in the interim, they shall suffer hunger
like dogges, which among all other beasts suffereth the most hunger: Hambre
canina, a dogs hunger, is spoken by way of Prouerb in the Spanish tongue.
They shall runne rounding the world after their Messias, but he hauing retyred
himselfe to heauen, neuer to be seene by them any more here on earth, this
miserable people shall hardly be able to find him. Nichola
                     ••
                   de Lyra saith, That 
 that they sought him in that siege which Titus
and Vespasian laid to Ierusalem, when they saw themselues swallowed vp
in so many miserable misfortunes, yet could they not find him: for albeit Gods
bowe
                  •
               ls are neuer shut vp for the
pardoning of sinne, yet are they shut vp for the punishment thereof; and euen
then did they looke to find him, when his sword was alreadie drawne. So that
that Language of Amos, For three transgressions, and for foure,
&amp;c.
               
                  Amos 2. The number of three
expresseth many sinnes, but the number of foure, more than manie: And therefore
when the Sinner shall come to this number, God will not pardon him,
Quatenus ad poenam, As touching the punishment of sinne, though he
forgiue him the guilt thereof. Saint Chrysostome saith, That in the
siege of Hierusalem many were conuerted to our Sauiour Christ, repenting
themselues of that which they had alledged against him to Pilat, If wee
let goe this man, the Roman
                     •
                   will
come and take our Kingdome and our Nation from vs, &amp;c. Saint
Augustine saith, That this prophecie (You shall seeke
mee,
               
                  Act. 2. 
               and shall not finde
me) was fulfilled in that Sermon which S. Peter made, whereof S.
Luke makes mention in the Acts; where many of them did
repent, and were conuerted to Christ, to the number of three thousand persons;
but that others did despaire of pardon, considering the greatnesse of their
offence.
            But letting passe the people of the Iewes, this sentence doth
aduise all sorts of persons, That they doe not let slip the time of their good,
whether it bee in regard of the person, or of the time which is offered vnto
them; for afterwards, they shall seeke and shall not find. In regard of the
persons,Good neuer truly liked, till lost. Good was
neuer truly knowne till such time as it is lost; The couetous Rich-man did
acknowledge in Hell, the Riches that were hid vnder Lazarus his
Ragges; The Damned confesse amidst their slames, the wisedome of the Righteous,
whom before they held to be Fooles or mad men: The Prodigall in the Pig-stie
knew the aduantage that his fathers houshold seruants had of him: The Hebrewes
in their life time offered Moses a thousand Agrauio's and
iniuries; when hee slew the Aegyptian, he was forced through them to flie the
Countrie; when he was their Captaine and Commander, they multiplied mutinies
vpon him, murmurings, disgraces, and were so mad at him, that they would haue
stoned him to death; and yet after he was dead, if they had knowne where his
bodie had bin buried, they would haue worshipped and adored him. King
Ahab called Eliah while he liued here, The Troubler of
Israell; and Queen Iezabel she would haue his life taken from him; the
People too, they complained of his too much rigour and seueri
                  •
               ie, and that he had petitioned God,
That they should haue no raine for so many yeares, and that he tooke no pittie
of those poore soules that were readie to starue for hunger in the streets: but
when hee was taken vp into Heauen in a fierie Chariot, Elisha then
cried out, My father, my father, the Chariot of Israel, and the Horsemen
thereof; That is to say, Now Israell shall know, that thou wert more their
Protectour and Defender, than their armed Chariots: Or as Saint
Ambrose hath it, Now Israel shall know, that thou wert hee that did
gouerne them, and that did represse their violent passions, and bridle their
wilfull and headstrong affections, which were more hot and furious than those
of Beasts. In humane Histories there are infinite examples that auouch the
truth hereof, but none can alledge for the present, nor the world neuer yet

 there was no man that deserued more to bee beloued.
            
               Time a pretious Iewell.In regard of the
time, for the World hath not any one thing of so great price, as is Time,
Fili, conserua Tempus, My sonne preserue Time; so saith
Ecclesiasticus. Pretious things ought charily to bee kept and
conserued, whereof none is more pretious than Time. Seneca writing to
Lucilius, sayth, Who can too highly esteeme of Time? Who can giue it
the price that is due vnto it? All things else are Aliena, They are
not ours; onely Time is ours: it is a Treasure that properly belongeth vnto vs,
which wee may bestow as wee will our selues.
            
               Now in the last and great day of the Feast, &amp;c. This
was one of the famousest Feasts that the Iewes had; they solemnised the same
on the fifteenth of September, and it did last seuen dayes. Of the Ceremonies
and Sacrifices of this Feast,
                  Leuit▪
                   23.
  Num. 29. 
               Leuiticus, Numbers, and Iosephus in
his Booke of Antiquities maketh mention. All these seuen dayes the
Hebrewes liued in the field, and in Cabbins couered with boughes, in
remembrance of that time that God led them through the Desert in Tents and
Tabernacles: and therefore it was called the Feast of Tabernacles, That
your posteritie may know,
               Why instituted.
  Leuit. 23.43. 
               that I haue made the Children of Israel to
dwel in Booths when I brought them out of the land of Aegypt; God
pretending therein, That when the children of Israell should see themselues
seated in so populous a citie as Ierusalem, strengthned with such strong walls,
and such proud and stately Towers, that they did strike a feare and terrour
into Damascus, and all the heathen round about them; fortified with so many
seuerall sorts of Armes, illustrated with the Temple, which was one of the
myracles of the world; the memory of their forepassed miserie might melt the
vaine-glorie of their present prosperitie. For the forgetting of our first
rising, causeth commonly pride and arrogancie: your wiser sort of men, when
they see themselues raised to the highest round of Fortunes wheele, they
alwayes set before their eyes their base beginning. Amongst those other
Vessells of gold and siluer on his Court-Cupboord, the Emperour intermixed some
of earth, in memoriall that he was raised from beeing a Potter, to the honour
of being an Emperour. Amos did neuer forget that he had bin a
heardsman, though God had exalted him to be a Prophet; Armentarius ego
sum.
               Pride incident to Man. 
               Dauid neuer
denied that he had bin a Sheepheard. Sinners when they come to be Saints, they
are neuer vnmindful of the miserable estate of their sinnes; Quorum primus
ego sum, Whereof I am the chiefest, saith Saint Paul. For a man
to be puffed with the state of a new fortune, and to forget his former base and
meane estate, is a thing proper to base, ingratefull, and foolish persons: and
this forgetfulnesse causeth him to fall into discurtesies, inciuilitie, pride,
and bad behauiour.
            
               Good men are verie rare.
               If any man
thirst, let him come vnto me. Some say, That he calleth vnto all that are
thirstie, as elsewhere he called to all that were wearie and heauie laden with
the burthen of their sinnes. Others, That he calleth vnto those that thirst
after Heauen; and so putteth it downe conditionally: For albeit all doe thirst
after happinesse in the generall, yet those that attaine to this true
happinesse by a liuely Faith, are few. Things are by so much the more rare, by
how much they are the more pretious; as wee see in Gold, Pearles, and Pretious
Stones, in Cloathes of Tissue, Lawne, Silke, Scarlet, and delicacie of Dyet.
Amongst this number, wee List Good men, which are verie rare, and verie
pretious: Iuvenal termes them, The Monsters of the World, and he
drawes his comparison from a Mule great with Fole. Cicero saith, That
it is a rarer thing: for, to see a Mule bring forth a Foale, is verie 
 frequent, but we seldome see a perfect wise man.
Dauid sayd of himselfe,

               I am become as it were a
Monster vnto many: A King so prosperous, so much fauoured of God, and so
good; a Monster? a King so powerfull, such a pardoner of his enemies, and so
liberall towards them; and he a Monster? a King which watred his couch with
teares, and did mingle them with the water that hee dranke, and did couer his
flesh with Sack-cloath; and he a Monster! Caietan translates it,
Tanquam Miraculum. It is the definition of the Iust, That a man, the
World walking that broad way which leadeth to destruction, that he should take
pleasure to goe the streight and narrow way, it is Miraculum, A meere
myracle: That a man, when all men besides shall say, Let vs eat and
drinke, for tomorrow wee shall die; that he should say, Let vs fast and
pray, let vs repent vs of our sinnes, that we may not die tomorrow, it is
Miraculum, A meere myracle: That a man, others beleeuing and louing
those things which they see and enioy; that hee should loue that which he
enioyeth not, and beleeue that which hee seeth not, but hopeth for, it is
Miraculum, A meere myracle: That a man should desp

world, than of the durt that he treads vnder his feet, (these being the Idolls
that mans heart doth vsually most adore) it is Miraculum, A meere
myracle.
               
                  Eccl. 49. 
               Zacharie and
Ecclesiasticus call Iesus the Priest the sonne of
Iosedec, and those his friends that were in his companie, Viros
portentosos, Prodigious men: By whom some vnderstand, Sidrac,
Misach, and Abeanego, those three Children which returned with
Zorobabel to Palestine. But Saint Iohn doth indeere this in
his Apocalyps,
               
                  Apoc. 12. where
making a description of the Iust, he saith, A great signe or wonder
appeared in Heauen. And that this conceit may extend it selfe a little
further, there are two things to be supposed.
            The one, That God painting forth by Esay the greatnesse
of the world, compares it to a drop of water, Quasi stilla situlae, As the
drop of a Bucket: Who hath measured the waters in his fist, and counted
Heauen with the spanne, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure,
and weighed the mountaines in a weight, and the hills in a ballance: All
Nations before him are as nothing; all the world and it's greatnes is as a
drop of water, it is a dust, and counted by him lesse than nothing. But of the
Iust we may say, Signum magnum apparuit in Coelo, It is a great myracle in
Heauen.
            
            The other, That beholding from Heauen the bredth of the earth, it
seemeth but a poore Cottage; the least of the Starres is greater than the
earth, and being beheld from thence, it seemeth to be the palme of a mans hand;
and the Sunne, which is a hundred and seuentie times bigger, seemeth in
comparison about the bignesse of a Buckler. And that a man should be iust, it
is Grande miraculum; and that he should thirst after Heauen, it is
Signum magnum; and therefore it is here said, If any man thirst,
&amp;c.
            
            
               If any man thirst. He inuiteth him that is thirstie, to
desire it:
            First, Because Heauen is to be gained, Labore &amp; sudore, By
labour and by sweat;Heauen not gotten without
  paines. and for this cause it is called in Scripture, a Crowne, a
Reward, a dayes Wages: now for to clamber ouer so many walls, We had need
be verie thirstie, and haue a good desire vnto it.
            Secondly, Because such pretious water is not fitting to be giuen
vnto him that hath no great mind vnto it. If in those lesser things here on
earth, he that giues makes such reckning of the esteem that the pretender holds
of that he sueth for; What shall it bee in that good, which beeing enioyed, the
soule is not able to comprehend it? for, in the matter of giuing and receiuing,
so necessarie is the

               gusto
and contentment that a man takes therein, that he that giues with disgust▪
giues not, and he that receiues with disgust, receiueth not what is giuen: And
therefore Seneca in his booke De Beneficijs, setteth downe
the decorum that is to be held therein. Ecclesiasticus saith,
There is a gift which is not profitable, and there is a gift whose
retribution is manifold. In receiuing, this reason carrieth the more force
with it; for who is he that will giue to him that hath no desire to receiue?
And with God it is more forcible; for he will haue all his gifts to bee our
rewards, and therefore he calls those, our gifts, which in all strictnesse are
his. The Lord respected Abel &amp; his gifts. The Lambs that
were offered were Gods, Al the best of the Woods are myne, &amp;c. yet
out of his goodnesse he calls them Abels. All that we offer is his
(Quae de manu tua accepimus, reddimus tibi) yet he stiles it ours: so
that the loathing and distaste of receiuing, takes away the desire of giuing.
When the People of Israel began to say, Our stomacke is wearie of that
light meat, presently Gods prouidence iudged them vnworthie of that
fauour.
            Whence it is to be noted, That this vnwillingnesse doth not onely
rise from a little liking which man hath of Heauen, but of the great liking
that hee hath to these earthly goods. And this is a two fold fault:
            The one, That we should despise the fountaine of liuing Water.
            
               No appetite so fierce as that of a
  sinner.The other, That we should thirst after the water of loathsome and
durtie puddles. Who will forgoe cleere and sweet waters for those bloudie
pooles of Aegypt? Exodus sayth, Quicquid habueris de pluuia,
conuertetur in sanguinem; Who will leaue the sweet waters of Siloah,
                  Ier. 
                  
                     •
                  .
  Exod. 4. Dan. 7. which silently glide along, for to
drinke of that fierie lake wherof Daniel speaketh: wherein (as he
said) one sorrow is, That they should despise the sweeter Waters; another, That
they should thirst after the muddie Waters of the earth? There is no
impetuousnesse of the fiercest Bull, nor of the furiousest Horse, comparable to
that of a Sinner which thirsteth after his vaine appetites and idle desires.
Saint Hierome and Theodoret both say, That in this Si
quis he neither dismisseth nor inforceth, but that hee publisheth the
generall desire which he hath to communicate his spirituall Graces.
            
               What ment by the water of life.
               He
that beleeueth in me (saith the Scripture) out of his bellie shall
flow riuers of Water of Life. To the Thirstie that shall drinke of this
water of Life, that shall not succeed to them as befalleth those that drinke of
dead standing Pooles, who within a little while after haue greater thirst than
they had before; for they shall haue within their brests a liuing Fountaine,
whence great riuers of water shall flow; they shall enioy such a fulnesse of
all good, that they shall haue enough to communicate vnto others. Saint
Gregorie &amp; Saint Chrysostome vnderstand by this
Fountaine, the Holy-Ghost, from whome euerie good thing doth proceed.

               As saith
the Scripture. Albeit there be many places in the sacred Scripture, which
prophecie the aboundant plentie of spirituall Waters, there is none that can
say, That this is alledged in particular. Origen is of opinion, That
that of the Prouerbs hath the most apparance, Bibe aquam ex
cisterna tua, &amp; fluenta putei tui:

               This spake he of the Spirit which they that beleeued in him
should receiue. And this blessed Spirit is fitly compared to water,The Holy Ghost Why compared to water. in regard of it's
effects.
            The first effect of water is, To clense: Ezechiel, I w
                     •
                  ll poure vpon you cleane water, and
yee shall be cleane. But all the water in the world cannot wash a
Blacke-a-moore white; indeed there is no water that can make that which is
blacke, white; but the Holy-Ghost can doe this, it can adde a new cleannesse
and a new beautie thereunto;2. Cor. 4.
               Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow; it shall not 
 onely lose that whitenesse which it had before, but
shall surpasse the snow in whitenesse. In like manner, a Sinner may be so
washed and so clensed, that hee may remaine more pure and more faire than the
Innocent. Againe, water clenseth, but as it washeth, so it wasteth and weareth
out that which it washeth, as it is to be seene in your Linnen: but the
Holy-Ghost reneweth the Soule, giuing new force and new strength, Thy youth
shall be renewed like the Eagles; and though our outward man be corrupted, our
inward man is reuiued yet day by day.
            
            The second effect is, To fertilise and fructifie the earth: The
holy Spirit worketh this with great aduantage; My soule without thee is
barren, but by thy fauourable influence it bringeth forth the faire
fruits of Charitie, Ioy, Patience, Long-suffering, Goodnesse, Gentlenesse,
&amp;c. All these things worketh one and the same Spirit; and
therefore it is called Viuificator, A Quickning Spirit.
            
            The third effect is, To quench thirst: Onely the Holy-Ghost can
quench the thirst of the Soule; all other humane goods increase our thirst, as
it is proued in many places. And therefore Dauid did desire of God,
that he would quench this his thirst; My Soule thirsteth after God, the
Fountain of liuing water, and wo is me, &amp;c. He doth sigh and grone for
his God and his glorie, becau
                  •
               e
onely that is able to quench his thirst.
            
               Neuer man spake as this man. The High-Priests and the
Pharisees asked the Officers that were sent to apprehend our Sauiour, Why they
had not brought him with them? and the Officers answered, Neuer any man
spake like this man.
            
            Wherein two things are to be considered:
            First, The force of Gods Word.
            Secondly, The little feare &amp; great securitie which he inioyeth
that preacheth, as also he that heareth, and obeyeth.
            Many excellent Diuines haue harpt vpon this string, and great
endeerings haue beene deliuered by Ecclesiasticall and Secular Historians.
Saul sent to take Dauid, the Officers found him playing vpon
his Harpe, and were so rauished with the sweetnesse of his Musicke, that they
forgat themselues and what the King had giuen them in charge: He sent others
more stout and resolute,The power of Gods word. and
the like hapned to them. The King beeing inraged with anger, and waxing
wondrous cholericke, went himselfe in person to apprehend him, vsing high
language, and throwing out great menaces &amp; threatnings against him; but he
was scarce come thither, when he fell a prophecying; who (according as some
will haue it) catching hold of a Harp, began to play vpon it, and to sing;
like vnto some Serjeant, who finding him whom he goes to apprehend, dancing at
some Wedding in a Countrie Village, layeth aside his Mace, and falls a dancing
with the company. The Fables report, That Orpheus with his musicke
made the torments of Hell to cease, leauing those Tormentors in astonishment
and amasement. And great, questionlesse, is the suspension which Musicke
causeth in our minds.
            Touching Eloquence, rare is that endeering of
Cicero,
               The force of Eloquence. whose
Oratorie a Poet called, Flexamina, &amp; omnium rerum Regina. That of
Marcus Antonius, that famous Roman Orator, was so singular in this
kind, that the Senat sending a Band of souldiers to cut off his head, he did
earnestly intreat them, that they would but giue him the hearing of three or
foure words: they did so; but those his words were so powerful, that forsaking
their former fierce resolution, they sheathed vp their swords, and gaue him
his life; and which was much more, they so melted into teares, That hanging
their heads in their bosome, and casting their eyes to the ground, they all
fell a weeping. Plutarch telleth vs, how that Palemon, a
handsome young man of Athens, but of a most loose and dishonest life, came in
one  day to heare Xenocrates in that kind of
wanton fashion and habit, that any Who
                  •
               e or Curtezan could not tricke and set forth her selfe in a more
lasciuious manner: on which occasion the Phlosopher taking hold, did plead in
fauor of Honestie, with such strength of words, such excellent language, and
such extraordinarie eloquence, that in the presence of the Auditors
Palemon stript himselfe out of all his gay cloathes, pluckt the Rings
out of his eares, and off his fingers, continuing from that time forward, a
verie honest man, and a good patterne to others. No lesse wonderfull was that
which befell Phyletus a Disciple of Hermogenes the Inchanter,
who came to dispute and maintaine argument with Saint Iames the
elder, relying much vpon his Sophistrie; but the Apostle preached with that
powerfulnesse, that Phyletus returning backe againe to his Master,
told him, Magus abieram, Christianus reaco, I went forth a Magician, but I
am returned a Christian. To this purpose the Fables report of
Hercules, That with chaines of gold which came forth of his mouth, he
haled after him all the World. But neither the truths of humane Histories, nor
the lies of artificiall Fables, can attaine vnto the force and power of Diuine
Eloquence. Esay foretold vs as much; All Nations shall flow vnto
him; borrowing his Metaphore in this word Flow, from some great
and principall Riuer, which without any violence, runs along with that strange
force and swiftnesse, that nothing can resist it, but sweepes all away that
stands in it's way. Being one and the same comparison with that of Saint
Iohn, Out of his bellie shall flow Riuers of water of Life.
            
            From hence (and that verie fitly) we may draw a second
consideration; which is this, If from euerie one that enioyeth this Spirit,
there flow forth great riuers of liuing water, well may those good men liue
without feare, and secure from all harmes, wrongs, affronts, and tyrannies.
Consider with thy selfe in a Riuer, the force of the water, the impetuousnesse
and furie of a swift Torrent, the violence of a great streame, wherewith a
hundred Mills are driuen; Who will dare to keepe it backe? Who will offer to
stand in it's way? Who can resist it? Of the comming of our Sauiour Christ it
was prophecied, That hee should banish all feare and cowardise from out the
hearts and brests of his friends. Dauid compares the iust man, to the
Moone when she is at the full, He shall be established for euer as the
Moone, and as a faithfull witnesse in the Heauen. Alcyat sayth in one of
his Emblemes, That a Dog then barketh most, when the Moone is at the
fullest; whether it be by some speciall influence that it then worketh in the
Dog; or whither it be occasioned by the macula's or spots in the
Moone, representing vnto him the forme and shape of another Dog: but though the
Dog barke neuer so much, yet doth the Moone walke her Station securely through
Heauen; and though Tyrannie barke neuer so much at the Iust, yet shall hee
walke in safetie. The Spouse in the Canticles complaineth, That
Tyrants had taken her cloake from her: The Church calleth this her Cloake, the
Martyrs; wee see some of them roasted, some fryed on the Gridyron, some sawne,
some dragged at the 
                  •
               ailes of
horses, some with their skinnes pluckt ouer their eares, and some tormented
with sundrie other torments, the Deuill blowing the coles of crueltie in the
mouthes and hearts of the Executioners. But in the end, those cuts and slashes
passe no further than the cloake, they wound the bodie, but not the soule.
            God of his mercie giue vs the grace to endure this our fireie
triall, when persecution shall set vpon vs, that being purified in the Furnace
of Tribulation, we may be like Gold that is refined, and shine with glorie in
the sight of God, To whom, &amp;c.
         
         
            
            THE XXXIIII. SERMON, VPON THE TUESDAY AFTER PASSION
SVNDAY.
            
               
                  
                     IOHN. 7.
                   
                  Ambulabat Iesus in Galileam, non enim volebat in Iudaeam
  ambulare, quia quaerebant Iudaei interficere.
               
            
            
               
                  AFter these things, Iesus walked in Galilee, and would not
walke in Iudaea, for the Iewes sought to kill him. After these things,
that is, after those great myracles which he had wrought in Capernaum; and
after that most deepe and learned Sermon of his bodie and bloud, Saint
Iohn saith, That our Sauiour Christ retyring himselfe from Iudaea,
went and wrought myracles in the Cities of Galilee, because the Iews sought to
kill him. And because the enuious Murmurer may chance to say, That hee withdrew
himselfe from Iudaea, lest the Scribes and Pharisees should discouer his
trickes, and find out his false play; the Euangelist addeth, That there was no
such matter to be feared, but that waiting for the houre of his death, alreadie
determined in Heauen, he was desirous in the interim to slinke out of the way,
to free and deliuer his bodie from that malice and danger which he saw it was
like to be subiect vnto in Iudaea. The Greeke Texts read, In Iudaea &amp;
Galilaea; but Saint Augustine, Saint Cyril, and Saint
Chrysostome read it in the Acusatiue, In Iudaeam &amp;
Galileam, (id est) Per Galileam. Saint Chrysostome
saith, Non poterat ambulare in Iudaeam; which is all one with
Nolebat, He could not; that is, He would not: which is an vsuall
phrase of speech.
            
               Iesus walked in Galilee, &amp;c. It is made a generall
doubt amongst all the Commentators,Gods power neuer more
  seene than in his Passion. Why our Sauiour Christ, being able to triumph
so easily ouer the power and malice of his enemies, should withdraw himselfe
from their presence, whom he might (if he would) haue trampled vnder his feet?
To proo
                  •
               e which point were a
needlesse labour, there beeing so many Prophecies and so many places of the one
and the other Testament, which say as much; and those loud shrieking cries
which the Deuills roared forth, affrighted, and turning cowards in his
presence, are sufficient proofes thereof; likewise Deaths cowardlinesse
confirmes the same, Egredietur Diabolus, ante faciem eius ibit Mors;
the ouerthrowing of the Roman Cohorts with one onely word; his causing the 
 stones to freeze to their fingers that had so often
sought to stone him to death; his leauing them lying on the ground in a swoune
that came to apprehend him, are testimonies without exception. Why then at
euery step doth Christ retyre himselfe, and seeke to get from them? Saint
Augustine makes this difficulty seeme greater in his bookes de
Ciuit. Dei; For, reprehending Cato Vticensis, who that he might
not fall into Caesars hands, killed himselfe, he saith, That for a man
to flye from tribulation and danger, is a kind of Cowardize. And Saint
Paul saith,
                  Acts 20. 
               I know that
bonds and afflictions abide for me at Ierusalem, but I passe not at all,
neither is my life deare vnto me, &amp;c. Esay going about to
relate in his 52 chapter that which our Sauiour was to suffer, doth first set
downe by way of interrogation, Who will beleeue that which Gods arme is to
suffer? He calls his diuine power his Arme, because God shewed his power
in nothing more than in his passiō. Tertullian in his book de
Patientia saith, That God did not expresse his power so much in
parcendo, as in patiendo; in pardoning, as in suffering. That
saying of the Church is worthy the weighing, Qui omnipotentiam tuam
parcendo maxime &amp; miserando manifestus, Who shewest thy omnipotency in
nothing more, than in pittying and pardoning offenders. But what hath the
strength of suffering to doe, with the weaknesse of flying? Petrus
Chrisologus in a Sermon of his, De fuga Domini, taxeth the
Euangelists for relating our Sauiour Christs flying; For a souldier (saith he)
should publish his constancie, his valour, the strength of his arme, and
aduance the noble Acts, and conquests of his Captaine, but not his weakenesses
and his feares.
            Behold againe the difficultie, in regard of that our Sauiours
great anguish, both in body and soule,Why Christ desiring to
  die, did fl
                     •
                  e to auoide
  death. before he was to dye. None in the world did euer more desire to
dye than he did, as hath already been proooued vnto you. If then (sweet Iesus)
thou doest so much desire death, and that the Iewes hunt after thee for no
other end, Why doest thou flye?
            Before that I resolue this doubt, we are to confesse and
acknowledge with all possible humilitie, that mans vnderstanding comes farre
short of Gods thoughts. Esay saith, see how much distance there is
betweene heauen and earth; so much is there betweene the imaginations of God
and man: And therefore the Spouse said,Gods Counsells
  vnsearchable. That they were high and black; high like the Palme tree,
and blacke as the Rauens quill. Who (saith Ecclesiasticus) can count
the sands of the sea, the drops of the deaw, or the dayes of the world? Now if
humane wisedome cannot attaine vnto those things, which she hath as it were
betweene her hands, she will lesse be able to search into the secret counsells
of God. And therefore the Wise man doth aduise thee, Seeke not into those
things that are too high for thee. This way being thus made, let vs now
proceed to the reasons of the Saints.
            The first is of Saint Augustine and Saint
Chrysostome. Our Sauiour Christ was God, according to his Diuine
nature; and man, according to his humane nature: and the confession of the one,
being as necessary as the other, he had in all his actions a great respect vnto
them both. All his words and deeds still tended to this, that he might be
beleeued to be both God and man. Saint Augustine saith, That his
withdrawing himselfe aside as a man, did not withdraw from his power as hee
was God; and his throwing downe of his enemie flat on the ground, as he was
God, did not take from him his weaknesse, as he was man. If Christ should not
haue showen in the flesh, the condition of flesh, in vaine had he taken flesh
vpon him: and if he should alwayes haue done the workes and actions of a God,
and giuen perpetuall pledges of his Diuine nature, to what vse would haue
serued his cloathing himselfe with humane flesh? If Christ should haue beene a
continuall  Miracle, what roome would there haue been
left for faith, or what reward could that haue receiued?
            The second is of Chrysologus, which is this: That there
is not that man be he neuer so powerfull, neuer so valiant, but doth sometimes
shew the weaknes of a man, in hiding and withdrawing himselfe. But here he
saith, Artis est, non timoris, Sacramenti est, &amp; non Pauoris. It
was not out of any feare, or cowardize that our Sauiour fled. It is a kind of
daringnesse, boldnesse of spirit, and great courage to draw our enemie but
into the field, or to toll him along into the marketplace, and there to
vanquish him in publike, and obtaine an open victorie.
                  Mat. 6. 
               Epiphanius saith, That Christ
vsed this boldnesse in the garden, as well in his sweating of blood, as in
those his prayers that he made vnto his Father, so full of agonie and anguish,
to the end that by shewing himselfe thus weake, death might the more boldly set
vpon him. Ioshua vsed the like slight with those of the City of Ay;
We flying, they will follow vs, then ye shall rise vp from lying in wait,
and destroy the City. Agesilaus, one of the Lacedemonian Captaines,
                  Iosh 8. tooke the same course when he besieged the
Phocenses; Alcybiades, with the Vizancini:Aduantage
  against an enemy, no Cowardize. And the world neuer had any famous
Captaine which did not doe the like vpon occasion: Iulius Frontinus in
his booke of Stratagemes quotes you a world of examples. Be ye wise as
Serpents, said our Sauiour; the Serpent aduantageth himselfe more by his
craft and subtletie, than by his strength and force; the experience whereof
was to our griefe to be seene in Paradise. And therefore it is obserued by
Gods Saints, That he was more subtill than all the rest of the beasts of the
field, therein aduising vs, That with the diuell, the world, and the flesh, it
is now and then the wiser and safer course of the two, to retyre our selues and
to flye from him, than either to wait for him, or to resist him.
Philip king of Macedon turned his backe and fled before the
Athenians, leauing his Shield behind him, wherein these letters were ingrauen,
Bona fortuna: And some souldiers vpbraiding him with this his flight,
he told them, He that flyes, may returne againe to the battell, but not he that
dyes. There was a Captaine belonging to the Emperour Charles the
fifth, who made so famous and honourable a retreat out of France, that it was
called, La bella retyrada, The faire retreat.
               Men
  flye sometimes to come on the fiercer. Christ said vnto his Disciples,
If they persecute you in one citie, flye vnto another. Rem
                     •
                  gius saith, That this was a
precept; Thomas, That it was onely a licence and permission: For when
a Christian man flyeth without wrong to the faith hee professeth, and without
detracting from the good opinion and credit of Christian Religion, it is
wholesome counsell. And this did the Patriarches of old follow, Iacob
fled from Esau, Moses from Pharaoh, Elias from
Iezabel;To flye in time of persecution, how farre
  lawfull. and those Prophets which hid themselues in the house of
Abdias; and many Saints in the Primitiue Church fl
                  •
               d from the cruelty of the Tyrants of
those times. Tertullian saith, That vpon no occasion it is fit for a
Christian to flye. But Saint Ierome auoucheth, That this opinion is
contrary to the doctrine both of Christ and of his Church. Athanasius
defending his flight, made a booke concerning this subiect, wherein hee
prooueth, That any man may flye in time

                  〈◊〉
                persecution, so that he doe
not indanger his conscience: but when it comes vpon those tearmes, we must
rather hazard the body, than perill the soule; and with Sampson,
rather incounter with a Lyon, than to come to the vineyards at Timnath.
            
               Aristotle saith, That Fortitude is placed in the midst
between Daring and Dreading. Daring without Dreading, is Timeritie; and
Dreading without Daring, is Pusillani
                  •
               itie. Saint Ambrose ponders this in his Exameron, That
that very Elephant which valiantly breakes through a whole Armie, is mightily
afraid  
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉

                of a mouse. The great Machabean who with his valiant
Acts did innoble fame;1. Mac.
                  
                     •
                  .9.9. and who, for not to
spot his honour, did at last most gloriously loose his life, did sometimes giue
ground and make a retreat from his enemies. Saint Paul escaped being
let downe in a basket by the wals of Damascus: And Saint Augustine
saith, That it had beene a tempting of God, and so a sinne in him, if he had
not done it. Yet afterwards, being prisoner in Macedonia, and that all the rest
of the prisoners saued themselues by flight, he would not then flye, though hee
were thereunto intreated by the Gaoler. Dauid was of that true mettall
and courage,In some cases it is fortitude to flye.
that he fought with Lyons and Beares, making no more reckoning of them than of
so many lambes; and without once breaking of his Speare, he slew 800
Philistims, besides that stout Gyant which outbraued Israel, and strooke a
terrour into them. And yet did it not seeme cowardize in him to flye from
Saul, nor from his sonne Absalon. Vpon this occasion he made
that his 18 Psalme, wherein he giues thankes vnto God, not onely for giuing him
armes of brasse for to fight, and euen to breake a bowe of Steele asunder, but
that he had giuen him likewise the feet of a Hart to flye. Wherein hee alluded
(according to Thomas) to that Historie which he recounteth in the
second of the Kings,2. Reg. 4. when he fled
from Saul through briars and bushes, rocks and mountaines. In a word,
the world stiles rashnesse, daringnesse; and feare, cowardlinesse: but God
bewaileth this with a Woe be vnto ye that call good euill, and euill
good.
            
            The third reason is, That Christ withdrew himselfe out of Iudea to
giue way to his enemies rage and anger. For a cholericke man is so furious,
that if hee haue a present occasion offered him, that there is not any poulder
will sooner take fire than he; and therfore it is Christian wisedome to flye
from him. The Scripture compares him to a beare, Like a Beare robbed of
her Whelps: of whom your Naturalists report, That for very rage shee will
eate and deuoure her owne pawes.
                  Iob 40. And
Iob, Tygris perijt, eo quod non habuit praedam. And another letter
hath it, Vrsus perijt, eo quod non est consequutus praedam. Saul being
inraged that hee had not ouercome his enemies, slew himselfe. Such a one is
like a swelling riuer that ouerflowes it's bankes. It is a hot fierie furnace,
whence issueth out a thicke smoake, and after the smoake a flame.
Ecclesiasticus saith, As the vapour and smoake of the chimney goeth
before the fire,
                  Eccles. 22. so euill words,
rebukes and threatnings, goe before blood-shedding. The smoake is not that
which burnes, though it blinds and causeth the eyes to water; but who will
abide the flame thereof? Who will tarry the comming of a Beare that hunteth
after her prey? Who the falling of a swift Torrent? The soundest counsell is,
to flye. And in the dangers of the soule, this doctrine importeth vs much more.
As the Hart that is wounded with an arrow that is poysoned, flyes to the riuers
of water, so the heart that is touched with the venome of the Diuell, of the
world, or the flesh, must flye vnto that fountaine, which is God, My soule
thirsteth after God, who is the fountaine of life.
            
            The fourth, That though he were able to haue trod downe all his
enemies vnder his feet,Why Christ desiring to die would
  flye to auoid death. yet he flyeth from them
                  •
                For a man will not alwayes shew all
that he knowes; nor doe all that he can. Your foolish Princes make ostentation
of their power; but wise Princes, of their Iustice. The one make their power,
their reason; the other make their reason, their power, Sit pro ratione
voluntas. Pilat pressed our Sauiour Christ with his power, Knowest
thou not that I haue power to set thee free?
               Power
  should neuer bee showne but in extremity. but because he was a Tyrant,
he forgot his iustice. But our Sauiour Christ he forgot his power, and reades
vnto vs a Lecture of Prudence; Teaching vs, that we must reserue our power, and
our wisedome, for some good occasion.
            
               The fifth and last, That albeit our Sauiour
Christ felt the anguish and agonies of death, yet were they nothing like vnto
those his enemies felt for to worke his death. For his death was not to be at
their appointment, nor how and when they would haue it. The Pharisees sought to
make him away secretly in a corner, but he would dye in the face and sight of
all the world,The greater Chris
                     ••
                   shame, the greater our redemption. For the
greater his shame was, the greater was our redemption. The Pharisees would not
haue it on a festiuall day; Our Sauiour Christ, that it should be vpon a
festiuall day: for it was to be the greatest feast that was euer made for man.
The Pharisees would haue had him rid out of the way presently; Christ that it
should not be till his houre was come, and that he had finished all things that
his Father had giuen him in charge. And for this cause, when they sought after
him, hee fled from them; and when they did not seeke after him, he came
himselfe into the Shambles. Elias fled from Iezabel, that he
might not dye by her hand, and yet afterwards sitting vnder the Iuniper tree,
he desired death. The Iuniper tree was a Type and figure of the Crosse, for
which was reserued not onely a willingnes,3. Reg.
  15. but also a sit season to die.
            
               His brethren therefore said vnto him, Depart hence and goe
into Iud
                     •
                  a.
               Vaine-glory not to be affected. These great and wondrous
workes of thine (said his brethren) are not fit for these Galileans, being
that they are but a rude &amp; ignorāt people; Get thee to Iudea, for there
are the High Priests, and the Doctors of the Law, for whom the examination and
iudgement of these wonders is reserued. Euthymius saith, That our
Sauiours brethren went hypocritically to worke, and that making honour the
bayt, they would with that haue drawne him along to Iudaea. Saint
Chrysostome, That they did herein taxe Christ of a kind of
Dastardlinesse and fearefulnesse; as if they should haue said, Lord, thou doest
on the one side pretend honour; an don the other side thou art afraid that thy
Miracles should be examined, and come to the touch: and this makes thee flye
from Iudaea. So that it seemeth to this sacred Doctour, That Christs kinsmen
were doubtfull of the truth of his workes. Whence it followeth, That those whom
the Euangelist here calleth Christs brethren, were not of the Twelue: because
he sayth of them, His brethren beleeued not in him. But others, We know and
beleeue that thou art the Sonne of God. But that place of Saint
Matthew doth prooue it more plainely, where when Christ preached, one
came vnto him and told him, Thy mother and thy brethren stay without to speake
with thee: But hee stretching out his hand to his Disciples, said, These are my
mother and my brethren. In the first chapter of the Acts, naming the
Apostles, and amongst them. Iacobus Alphei, Simon, and
Iudas, he presently sayes, These did perseuere in prayer with the
women, with the mother of our Lord, and with his brethren. Now his brethren
were not of the number of the Apostles. And of this opinion is Saint
Augustine, and Saint Chrysostome.
            
            Saint Augustine saith, That the end of this their
counsell, was Ambition; and that it seeming vnto them, that they should haue
some share thereby in Christs glory, said vnto him, Transi hinc. And
to him that shall obiect that of S. Iohn, His brethren beleeued not in
him; I answer thereunto, That they did not beleeue that he was the
promised Messias: But withall, That they did not doubt of the truth of his
workes; but did onely desire to see them qualified and approued by the Scribes
and Pharisees, who were well skild in all the prophesies.
            
               My time is not yet come. Two things make this opinion of
Saint Augustines very probable.Men couet honor,
  though with the hazard of others.
            
            The one, That it is very common and vsuall with men to seeke to
get honor  
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉

                and profit from the prosperitie and glory of a kinseman.
And albeit it is very likely that they did know, that in Iudaea they would
seeke to take away his life from him, yet the thirst of their ambition was so
great, that they affected honour, though it were to bee effected at the cost
of their kinsmans life; as the sonnes of Zebedee did their seates. And
he might as well haue sayd vnto them, Ye know not what ye aske:God vseth no partialitie in the dispensation of his
  fauours. for it is not Gods fashion to conferre fauours for respect of
country, or kindred. The Princes of the earth oftentimes take this course,
making a coward, a Captaine, and putting a Hare into a Lyons place: But God
doth not hold him worthy of reward, or of the least praise, who is not
priuiledged as well for it by his owne proper vertue, as by blood and alliance.
The Iewes accounted it a great honour vnto them, that they were the sonnes of
Abraham, but because there was no shew of worth in themselues, our
Sauiour takes them vp very short,We must not relye on others
  Vertue, but our owne. telling them; Ye are of your father the
diuell: And therefore there is no honour due vnto you. And it is
Aristotles saying in his Ethnickes, Ab hu quae à natura
insunt, nec laudamur, nec vituperamur. Many Pagan Princes did follow this
tracke. Plutarch reporteth of King Antigonus, That a young
Souldier preferring a suit vnto him, he returned him this answer: I euermore
bestow my fauours on those that deserue the same in themselues, and not in
others. Pirrhus King of the Epyrots, his sonnes vrging him to tell
them, which of them should be his heire, and succeed him in his Kingdome?
answered, He whose sword hath the sharpest edge.
            The other, Is our Sauiours Christ own answer, My time is not
yet come. Which (according to Saint Augustine) was, as if he
should haue said, ye would haue glory, and take no paines for it. And
therefore he saith vnto them, Your time is alwayes readie, but with
me, my Crosse must goe before my glory, I must mount by humilitie.
            
            Now from these two considerations I will draw this one profitable
p
                  •
               int, That when a fauour is
throwne vpon a man,Honor where no merit is, ads to our
  shame, not to our shining. vpon any other Title or Claime, saue his owne
proper vertue and merit, it is rather an affront than an honor. They giue thee
an office, or some dignitie, because thou hast presented them with some
foolish bable or other, or hast carryed a shooe-clout in thy pocket to wipe
such a Noble mans shooe; it is an infamous Title, both in the giuer and the
receiuer. They doe thee some fauour for kindreds sake, and because thou art of
their blood; it is a Title of little honour to him that receiues it, and of
lesse Christianitie in him that giues it. They preferre thee to be the Princes
seruant, what good does that doe thee? It is so base a Title, That no Noble
Spirit will desire it. Thou gettest thy pretension by offering thy loue and
seruice to this or that Court Lady; it is a dangerous pretension. Thou art
raised by such a Lord, because thou hast serued him in his vnlawfull
pleasures; this is a damnable Title. God conferres his fauours vpon no other
Title than a mans owne proper vertue. Vpon Noah: But why? Because
thou wast vpright before me in thy generation. And in the day of
iudgement, who are they that shall be rewarded? and why shall they be rewarded?
Come ye blessed of my Father receiue a Kingdome, For I was hungry,
&amp;c. Vpon this Title is grounded the reward of a good death,
Blessed are they that dye in the Lord, for their workes follow them.
Not because he was an Apostle, a Prophet, a Doctor,Worship
  should not wait but vpon worth. a Confessor, a Prince, a Prelat, can he
pretend a reward; but because he was a good Christian and did all the duties
belonging thereunto. Their works follow them as a handmaid doth her
Mistres, or a Page his Master. If thou wilt haue honour, striue to win it. Your
Antients set two vessells before Iupiter, The one of exceeding sweet
liquor, the other exceeding sower; and no man could come to 
 taste of the hony, vnlesse he did first trie the gall.
The Romans had two Temples adioyning each to other; one of Honour, the other of
Vertue: but there was no comming to that of Honour, but by that of Vertue.
            
               My time is not yet come, but yours is alwayes ready. I
expect eternall and perdurable glory, but yee short and momentary in regard of
mine. Christ must suffer, and so enter into glory. But this time is
not yet come for you, Your time is alwayes ready. That season sutes
best with you that is seasoned with honours and pleasures: This is the
North-starre of the world, All sayle by it. S. Augustine in his bookes
de Ciuit. Dei, prooueth with great elegancie, That the Romans had not
any God which they so much adored, as that of Honour: and for the Author of
this truth, he alledgeth Salust, Ista ergo landis auiditas, &amp; cupido
gloriae, omnia illa miranda fecit laudabilia scilicet atque gloriosa, secundum
existimationem ho

greedines of humane glory, triumphed ouer all the rest of the things in Rome;
and not onely in Rome, but in Greece. And in most of your other Nations, there
was not a Captaine or Philosopher which did not eclipse all the other vertues
that he inioyed, with the shadow of this desire of Honour. This did Seneca,
Plutarch, Aristotle, and Plato pretend. And Socrates
himselfe, who did so much blaz

               n
his pouertie, and seem'd to take a pride in it, came to be an Idolater of Honor
and Fame. This pill they swallowed downe, and conceiuing a kind of immortality
to be lapt therein, cram'd their conceits therewith, making the discommodity of
life, dangers, sweats, troubles, &amp;c. seeme sauoury vnto them:Honour a bait which all men bite at. Which is a kind of
birdlime which clingeth so close to our hearts, that Gods greatest Saints do
complaine and bewaile the great difficulty in being loosed and freed therefro.
Saint August. did intreat of God with teares and sighes, that he would
free him from this plague, Domine sine secatione tentamur, tu nosti de hac
re ad te gemitum cordis mei, &amp; flumina oculorum meorum. And if a Saint
so humbly minded, as none more, doth thus weepe, sigh and groane, what shall
become of him that is as arrogant as hee is ignorant? And in another place,
this Sacred Doctor saith, The purer thou art from this vncleannesse, the
liker shalt thou be vnto God. And in an Epistle of his, hee saith, That by
how much the Moone is more full and faire in our eyes, it participateth so
much the lesse of the same; which is all one with that of
Ecclesiast.
               
                  Eccl. 43. 
               The light
thereof diminisheth vnto the end, and groweth wondrously in her changing.
These words seeme to carry a contrarietie, but it is not so: for the Moone doth
decrease to our seeming towards the end of it's waning; and yet euen at that
very time it increaseth wonderfully, receiuing from the Sun by the contrary
part a far greater light. It seemed then to these kins folke of Iesus Christ
our Redeemer, That the Feast of Ierusalem was a fit time for to gaine much
honour, and therefore said vnto him, Depart hence, and manifest thy selfe
to the world. Whereunto hee answered, ye desire to see me in great honour
and estimation with the world, expecting out of my reputation and credit, to
reape vnto your selues a temporall reward; but I doe rather desire to see my
selfe dis-esteemed of the world, because thereupon dependeth your spirituall
promotion.
            Saint Bernard discoursing how the blessed Virgin
Mary,
               Kindred the ouerthrow of many Prelats.
and the glorious Saint Ioseph went to seeke Iesus when he was lost
(when he was 12 yeare old) amongst his kindred and acquaintance;
saith, That many miscarry by their kinsfolks means. And I my selfe haue known
many Prelats of very good parts, and extraordinarie gifts, of whom I haue beene
afraid, that their kinsfolke haue beene the cause of their condemnation, and
casting downe into hell. For it is a wofull case, That for 200 Ducats pension,
which a Prelat bestowes on a Student, hee should oblige him to run ouer all the
Diuine Seruice, and not to leaue out so much as any one 
prayer, and that he should confer on a kinseman thirty thousand Ducats pension,
without obliging him to pray a Pater-noster, or say an
Aue-Mary.
            
            Two bloody mischiefes come vnto vs by our brethren and
kindred.
            The one in point of precedencie, Enuie working most vpon those
that are brethren; especially, if one get the start of the other, or chance to
be preferred before him. As the History of Iosephs brethren proueth
it vnto vs; who (for those his dreames of his future prosperity) put him down
into a pit, and sold him away. So stood the case in Abimilecks
busines, who for Superiorities sake, and that hee might raigne, slew at once 70
of his brethren. Holy king Dauid could not escape this mischiefe: His
brethren could haue eaten him (as we say) with salt, to see that he should pop
forth, and enter into the field with that mettall and courage against that
great Gyant Goliah, himselfe being the least amongst his brethren. And
was it not so I pray,Enuy neuer greater than amongst
  brethren. with Abel and Cain? For a brother of all
other can least endure that a brother should outstrip him, though it be Gods
owne handy-work to aduance and prefer him. And the sonnes of Thamar
are a type and figure thereof, who stroue and strugled in their mothers
wombe.
            The other in regard of the desire that they haue to see a brother
or a kinsman prosper, onely that they may sucke from him, and wholly disfruit
him, as if hee were a tree of their owne orchard, which, of these two
mischiefes, is the greater.
            For in the first, the enuious brother looses, and the enuyed
gaines.
            In the second, all rob that tree which affoords them fruit, and
that brother or kinsman that is owner of it.
            I remember a memorable saying that was vttered by a holy Prelat,
relieuing (being importuned therunto) two of his brethren with 200 Crownes, for
to buy them Oxen to till their ground. I shall (said he) desire of God, That
this poore pittance which I now giue you, doe not consume the rest of that
which ye now enioy. My brethren, to facilitate their request, told me that I
was a single man, had no body to care for,Kindred will
  cleaue to a man in his prosperity, but neuer look on him in aduersitie.
that I was a Guarda de Vinas, a Vine-keeper, a Church-man, and an
ouerseer of soules, Sed vineam meā non custodiui, But I did not keep
this my Vinyard so wel as I should haue done: for I could not defend it from my
brethrē and my kinsfolk, one plucking this from me, and another that, til they
had left me nothing to pleasure either my selfe or the poore, whom I ought most
to haue respected. If thou be rich, all thy kindred will bee like so many
horse-leeches to draw thy blood from thee; but if thou be poore, not a kinsman
that will looke vpon thee. That mirrour of patience, that holy man Iob
saith in his 31 chapter, Despectio propinquorum terruit me, There was
not that kinsman that would looke vpon me in my misery, but beheld me with
disdaine and scorne, and would not affoord me any the least comfort. Vaine is
the confidence in friends and kinsfolks; vaine is the confidence in Princes.
And therefore ô Lord let vs relye vpon thee, who neuer faylest those
that put their trust in thee. To God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the
Holy Ghost, &amp;c.

                  The Feast of the Dedication was celebrated at Ierusalem.
               
            
            
               THe Feast de las Enzenias, or of the Dedication, was
celebrated in Ierusalem: The Greeke word signifieth, Renouation.
               Three Feasts of dedication among the Iewes. 3. Reg.
  8. The Iews had three Feasts of this name:
            The first, in remembrance of the great solemnitie made by
Salomon when he had finished the Fabrick of the Temple, which was one
of the Myracles of the world.
            The second, in memoriall of the re-edification thereof,
                  Esdr.
                  
                     •
                  . done by
Zorobabel and the Princes of Iuda, hauing Cyrus his Warrant
for it, who restored the gold and siluer which Nebuchadnezzar robbed
the Temple of.
            The third, in remembrance of that Altar which Iudas
Machabeus built anew, which Antiochus had prophaned by placing
thereon the Statue of Iupiter Olympus,
               1
  Mach. 1. and offering thereon costly and sumptuous Sacrifices.
And this is that Feast whereof the Gospell makes mention; it was celebrated on
the twentie fifth of Nouember, which in the Iewish account was the ninth
moneth, about the beginning of Winter; and therefore it is sayd, It was
Winter. Now our Sauiour Christ passing along through the porch of the
Temple, the Iewes flocked about him, both Nobles and Plebeians, and sayd vnto
him, How long doost thou make vs doubt? How long wilt thou hold vs in suspence?
if thou be the Christ, tell vs so plainly without any more adoo. But Iesus gaue
them so vnsauorie an answer to this their vnmannerly demand, that they tooke vp
stones to stone him.
            
               The feast of the Dedication was at Ierusalem. It is the
language of the Scripture,Mans Heart, Gods Temple.
and especially of the Apostle Saint Paul, to call our Brest, Heart, or
Bosome, Gods Temple; as in that to the Corinthians, Yee are the Temples of
the liuing God: And he citeth that place of Leuiticus, As God hath
said, I will dwell among them,
               2. Cor. 6.
  Leuit 26. 
               and walke there. And Saint Ambrose
further addeth, That as in a materiall temple made with hands, there are
Porches, Floores, and Altars, &amp;c. so within vs  we
haue all these things. Phylon saith, That an honest, a holy, and
deuout Soule, is the Altar whereon God is adored.
            But here we are to consider, That our heart, or the soule of a
Christian man, is a higher rooft Temple, and farre more spacious. After that
Salomon had made an end of building his Temple, he sayd, O Lord, I
haue built thee an House to dwell in, but it is too little for thy greatnesse;
for if the Heauens, and the Heauens of Heauens are not able to containe thee,
how much more vnable is this House that I haue built, it being but a Thimble as
it were, in comparison of thee, for that thou art higher than the highest
Heauens, and deeper than the profoundest Depth. What House is that
(saith Esay, in a sleighting kind of manner) which yee haue built
for me, and what is that place of my rest? Were not all things made by my
hand? If then a Temple made by such powerfull hands, be so small a House
for God to dwell in, (for which cause Saint Paul sayd, He dwelleth
not in Temples made with hands) How great a one will that be, which man
shall make for him? So that t
                  •
               e
least vnworthie, and the least narrow house, is our brest; Greater yet is
God than our heart, and yet God saith, If any shall open, I w
                     •
                  ll come in vnto him, and wil sup with
him.
            
            This is that Temple which God desires should bee renewed. After
that the Temple was prophaned by Ant
                     •
                  ochus, the Text saith, They did wisely consider with
themselues, That that Altar should be destroyed, and a new one built: for
they thought it not fit to offer Sacrifice vnto God vpon that Altar, where
                  •
               n Antiochus (whom the
Scripture stileth, The Root of all wickednesse) had performed so many
abhominations. They therefore built a new Altar, and did insti
                  •
               ute a Feast in memoriall of it's
re-edification; wherein they gaue thankes vnto God, That he had giuen them a
time wherein they might truly serue him, as they had done heretofore.
            Now as the councell was good in the Machabees, To build a
new Alter (for had they made the old one neuer so cleane,Mans Soule must bee renewed, to make it a fit habitation for
  God. yet the forepassed abhominations would haue caused a continuall
horrour) so will it be verie good councell, vtterly to destroy a foule Soule,
which hath been an Inne for Vice, and an habitation for Deuils, and to create
it anew, that there might not remaine any relish of it's former ill: And
Dauid seemeth to desire as much of God in those words of his,
Create in me,
               
                  Psal. 51.

               ees and Sopes, yet haue I no hope
to make it as cleane as it was before: and therefore, ô Lord, I beseech
thee, that thou wilt create a new heart in me, wherewith I may loue thee for
euer. But if this cannot be, because the soule is immortall, perdurable, and
incorruptible, Renew a right spirit within me, that there may not
remaine any sent or sauour of my former foulnes; establish such a spirit in me,
that I may neuer fal from thy seruice; a spirit that may repaire those wrongs I
did before: and if that were an occasion that many did blaspheme thy Name, let
this be such a one, that it may conuert many vnto thee, and that they may truly
serue thee. The glorious Doctor Saint Ambrose touched vpon this
string, Dauid (saith he) did desire of God, That he would create him a
new heart, not that he should create it anew, but that he should so renew it,
that it might seeme to be created anew; for to clense it, was all one as to
create it.

                  on of
  Christian building.It is the resolution of a man that is truly penitent,
to desire to leaue a lewd life, and to auoyd all occasions thereof.
Anselme saith, That the first renouation  which
God effecteth in our soules, is in Babtisme: This is the foundation of our
Christian building, so saith the glorious Apostle Saint Paul.
Afterwards the eyes of our Reason being cleered, one layeth his foundation on
Gold, another on Siluer, a third on pretious Stones, a fourth on Wood, a fift
on Hay, a sixt on Straw: and though Hay and Straw be sometimes taken for Gold,
the fire will trie the finenesse of it, and purifie all.
            The second renouation is by Repentance: When thou hast an old
beastly tatterd garment, thou makest thee a new one; thy soule is all to be
rent &amp; torne, exceeding foule and filthie, cloath it anew. The first
regalo or kindnesse which the father shewed to the prodigall child,
was, his new apparelling of him, A
                     •
                  
                  ferte stolam primam. This is the greatest kindnesse thou
canst doe to thy soule; and that thou maist not doe as little children vse to
doe, which are well clad to day, and a few dayes after are nothing but ragges
and totters; doe not yee make your garments of paper, which the least blast of
aire rents asunder, but put on Iesus Christ our Sauiour and Redeemer, which is
a Rayment that will last for euer.
            
               And it was Winter. Saint Gregorie saith, That
the Scripture sometimes setteth downe the circumstances of time and place, to
signifie by them,Circumstances of Time and Place in Holy
  Writ, of great significancie. that which is not expressed by word of
mouth. And that this circumstance of Hyems erat, It was Winter, though
it may be referred to our Sauiour Christs walking from place to place, yet doth
it declare the frostinesse and ycie coldnesse of the Iews hearts. By coldnesse,
the Scripture vnderstandeth the malice of sinne; whence it is to bee noted,
That the Historie of the Machabees calleth this Solemnitie,
                  Ierem.
  6. 2. Mac. 1.18. The Feast of Fire; Whereas we are now purposed
to keepe the Purification of the Temple vpon the twentie fifth day of the
moneth Chasleu, wee thought it necessarie to certifie you thereof,The feast of Fire. that yee also might keepe the Feast of
the Tabernacles and of the Fire, which was giuen vs when Nehemias
offered Sacrifice, after that he had built the Temple and the Altar, &amp;c. It
appeareth by the sixth Chapter of Leuiticus, That God did conserue a
perpetuall fire in his presence, The Fire shall euermore burne vpon the
Altar, and neuer goe out.
               
                  Leuit. 6.13.
At their departure into Babylon, they hid their fire in a deepe pit, and at
their returne they found it turned into a thick water like a gellie;
Nehemias he takes it forth and setteth it in the Sunne, and presently
it became fire: the drops that remained, they did sprinckle or bedew the Altar
therewith, and they forthwith tooke fire; so that it was fitly called the Feast
of Fire. But that they who solemnise this Feast should bee all Frost and Ice,
is a thing verie worthie our consideration.
            This is our ruine and perdition, That the verie same day that wee
treat of renewing our soules, which is the feast of the Fire of our Spirit,
there should bee such a great coldnesse in vs, &amp;c. Take heed your
flight be not in the Winter, nor vpon the Sabboth: Our Sauior hauing
reuealed vnto his Disciples, whether it were the euils that should befall
Ierusalem, or the insuing miseries of this world, or those that should threaten
the Soule at each particular mans death, or all of them iointly together; and
supposing that none would be able to abide them, but that they would be forced
to flie from the euill to come; hee giues them this auiso, Take heed your
flight, &amp;c. Our Sauiour would not haue them to betake themselues to
flight, neither on the Sabboth day, nor in the Winter.
            Not on the Sabboth day, because their Law did not giue them leaue
to go any more than a thousand paces, a matter of a mile. But say some one
should haue ventured to breake this Law, and to haue gone further, he could not
haue lighted on an Inne-keeper to bid him welcome, got no meat, no fire to
dresse it, nor  haue met with any companie on the way,
but haue trauelled all alone in a fearefull kind of solitude.
            Not in the Winter, in regard of innumerable inconueniences, as
raine, durt, boggs, yce, frost, snow, rising of riuers, and dayes short and
darke. Saint Gregorie expoundeth this place of those euills which
threaten vs at our death; but be it in our death or in our life, the world hath
not any creature that is more threatned and terrified than a Sinner. Who can
looke Sinne in the face? our best course is to flie from it, and to haue
recourse to the Sanctuarie of Repentance; but we must take heed that we doe not
flie on the Sabboth, or in Winter. In die illa (saith
Zacharie) non erit lux,

               sed frigus &amp; gelu, In that day there shall bee no cleere
light, but darke. Saint Hierome saith, That the Prophet speaketh
of the destruction of Ierusalem by Titus and Vespasian: and
because the miserie and calamitie thereof would fall out to be so terrible and
so fearefull, that no man durst abide it, they treated of their flying from it.
But that time shall prooue vnto them to be extreame cold, and exceeding darke;
as if he should haue sayd, If they should haue fled for Gods seruice,God wil helpe those that flie for him, but not from him.
the Pillar of fire should haue gone before them and directed them in their way;
but when they shall flie to his disgrace and dishonour, the dayes shall be
cold, and the wayes darke, &amp;c.
            Here are condemned your cold and frozen Confessions, your slacke
&amp; slow restitutions,Penitēce compared to a Storme.
  Prou. 30. your luke-warme intentions; being like vnto those of
the Sluggard, of whom Salomon saith, Vult &amp; non vult, He will
and he will not: and these are verie hurtfull to the soule, for they
cause more securitie than saluation; These being a generation that are pure
in their owne conceits, and yet are not washed from their filthinesse.
Caesarius Arelatensis compareth Penitence to a Storme or Tempest, where
the winds, thunders, and lightnings play their parts: the wind at sea rents
sailes, splits Masts, crackes Cables, teareth vp Anchors, and breaketh the
Oares in pieces: Penitence must rent the sailes wherewith thou sailest in this
world with the wind in the poupe, it must cracke asunder the strong Cables of
thy wilfull affections, it must teare vp the Anchors of thy ill fastned hopes,
and breake those Oares of false and deceitfull Court-fauours, which thou falsly
supposest shall row thee ashore to some safe Harbour. On land, the wind turneth
vp the tallest Cedars and hugest Okes, though they haue taken neuer such deepe
rooting. There are men in the World that haue taken deeper rooting in worldly
riches, in their honours and their pleasures, than either the tall Cedar, or
the sturdie Oke; and there is nothing that can rent them vp by the roots, and
make them stoupe, but the stiffe wind of Penitence. These men must haue the
Waters of Grace to quench the flames of their couetous desires, and of the
fierie lusts of the flesh; Euerie night (saith Dauid) I will wash
my bed. The fire of Concupiscence which is kindled in this bed, must be
quenched with the watrie teares of the eys; and in stead of that fire, take
vnto thee the fire of Zeale, of Charitie, and of Loue, that may inflame the
Soule, kindle the Will, and inlighten the Vnderstanding; Ignem veni
mittere in terram, &amp;c. Thou must likewise haue the thunder of Gods
iudgements in thyne eares, to strike a terrour into thee of Gods Maiestie, to
make thee fearefull to offend, and keep thee in a continuall aw of keeping his
commandements, &amp;c.
            
               And Iesus walked in the porch of Salomon. There is no
Falcon that flieth so high, giues so many wrenches to the Herne, or makes more
stoopings with desire to seise on his prey; no enamoured Gallant, that halfe
so much rounds the dores of her he adoreth; no Sheepheard so trudgeth through
the Mountaines, seeking after his lost Sheepe; no poore Soule more seekes after
the house of  some rich and well deuoted Almes-giuer; nor
doth the Sunne fetch so many turnes through the world, as the Sonne of
righteousnesse doth to recouer a lost soule. Saint Augustine before he
had got out of his errour, said, Circumuolitabat â longe
misericordia tua, Thy mercy did flye about afarre off. Sinne doth separate
vs from God, and remooues vs farre from him. Longè à
peccatoribus Salus, Saluation is farre from the wicked. But his mercy
though it stood aloofe off, yet his eye did still watch ouer me, which is a
great argument of Gods loue towards mee. And from hence it ariseth, That there
is great feasts and ioy made in heauen for one soule that is conuerted; like
vnto those congratulations, and fellow-feelings which the Shepheard desireth
others should entertaine him withall, when hee hath found his lost sheepe.
Great is the Shepheards ioy when he findes his lost sheepe. But this is more
especially verified in God, it being his Delitiae, esse cum filijs
hominum. Then dost thou walk with great delight and contentment through
thy soules Temple, when thou doest contemplate the high mysteries thereof; Then
doest thou walke through thy vnderstanding, when thou art zealous in the loue
thereof; Then doest thou walke through thy will, when thou doest call to mind
the great blessings from Gods bountifull hand, with a desire to be thankefull
and seruiceable vnto him; Then doest thou walke through thy memorie, when thou
doest occupie thy selfe in holy thinges; Then doest thou walke through thy
eyes, when thou doest exercise thy selfe in workes of pittie; Then doest thou
walke through thy hands, when thou doest make a bed for the poore, and bind vp
the wounds of the wounded; Then doest thou walke through thy tongue, when thou
giuest wholesome counsell to thy brother. In a word, then doth thy soule take
her ease &amp; rest, sitting as it were on a Throne, and on a liuing Altar,
farre better than that which is made of stone; for one single sigh offered vp
vpon this Altar, is able to preuaile more than many on any other Altar.
            
               Iesus walked.
               Christ omits no meanes
  euen to reclaim the Reprobat
                     •
                   if
  it might be, Exod. 3. That our Sauiour Christ should vse so
many diligences for a soule that is predestinated for heauen, it is well and
good; but for such a reprobate people as this, that he should take such
paines, it is but lost labour. God called vnto Moses, saying, Goe
and speake vnto Pharaoh, that he let my people goe; But I know that hee will
not let them goe. What sayes Clemens Alexandrinus? O Lord, if
thou knowest so much, Why doest thou put thy selfe to so vnnecessary a trouble?
Why doest thou loose so much time? Wherunto there is giuen a twofold
answer.
            First, That he that is of a pittifull nature and kind condition,
doth not content himselfe with the iustifying of his cause, but vseth all
possible meanes to remedy what is amisse, and to set all things right. S.
Bernard did labour as it were with might and maine, as no Gally-slaue
could tugge more at an Oare, to reduce a Monke that had violated his Orders and
gone astray; and when a friend of his told him, What meane you to meddle in so
thanklesse and hopelesse an Office, and a case so desperate, where there is no
good to bee done? This man is flowne out so farre to checke, that he will neuer
be reclaimed. To whom Saint Bernard mildly answered, Non recipio
consolationem, vbi fratris video desolationem, I take no consolation, where I
see my brothers desolation. A tender hearted mother takes care of her
sonne in a desperate disease, vsing all kind of diligences, though they prooue
vnprofitable.
            Secondly, Saint Barnard saith, That God doth not oblige
Prelats, that they cure sinners, but that they procure to cure them. He doth
not reward a Preacher according to the good that he hath done, but according to
the paines that hee hath taken; and he cites that place of Saint Paul, I
haue laboured more than ye all.
               1. Cor.
  15. 
                He doth not say, I haue done more good
than any of you all; for the reward is not giuen according to the measure
of the profit, but the paines; not for the sauing of Soules, but for his
sweating to saue them. And for the better instructing vs in this truth, our
Sauiour Christ after so many myracles done, so many Sermons preached, and all
to no end, doth not for all this forsake this people, and giue them ouer, but
comes here vnto this great Feast, to direct them in the right way, Et
deambulabat, &amp;c.
            
            
               Then came the Iewes round about him. The Woolfes heere
come about the Lambe, as your Dogs about a poore Beggar, as your bigger Vessels
about a smal Fisher boat, or as your Sodomites about Lots house, or
Sauls soldiers about Dauid; In modum coronae, They had shut him
in on all sides, as a band of souldiers beset a Castle, or as the Wicked,
the Iust; which is as much to say, In circuitu Impij ambulabant, The Wicked
walked in a Circle: And they learned this of the Deuill; of whom Saint
Peter saith, He goes about seeking whom hee may deuoure. They came
about him: Vpon so good a day, a day of good workes, and on the day of the
renouation of the Temple, when they were to treat of the renouation of their
soules; Circumdederunt, They came athwart two walls, which would haue
made euen the Deuills of Hell to haue turned cowards.
            The one was, The respect to this so solemne a Feast.
            The other, To the Temple, and the sacred Pledges thereunto
belonging.
            None but Reprobates will store vp iniuries, reuenge, treasons,
gaming, banqueting, whoring, and the like villanous actions, for the Sabboth
day. Nazianzen saith, That the principall end of this or the like
Feast, is a remembring of God, and a gratefull acknowledgement of those many
fauours wee haue receiued from him: but that which was then, and is now a
dayes most practised, is, a forgetfulnesse of God, and an vnthankefulnesse for
benefits receiued. Where I would haue you to obserue,God did
  his greatest works always on the Sunday. (nor is it vnworthy your
noting) that God did on the Sabboth day do the greatest works that euer hee
did; he rewarded the Angels, crowning them with glorie, he threw the Dragon
&amp; his followers down from Heauen, hee freed his people from Aegypts
captiuitie, hee was borne into the world, after so many sighes hee rose againe,
he sent his holy Spirit, he ouercame the vnbeleefe of Thomas; &amp; on
the Sabboth day he shall iudge the Quicke &amp; the Dead. In a word, all your
festiuall dayes whatsoeuer, were instituted in memoriall of extraordinarie
fauours conferred vpon vs: and all these, the Ingratefull repay with new
offences.
            
               God will haue his Temples
  honoured.Touching the Temple or Church, wherein God is to bee honoured,
Nilus saith, That a Christian should beare no lesse respect to this
his holy place, than if he were in Heauen. Ieremie maketh a fearefull
threatning against Babylon, applying it against her, and against her King and
the Medes, Acuite sagittas, implete pharetras, arma, arma: And why so?
Vltio Domini, &amp; vltio Templi. He weigheth there the wrongs which
Nebuchadnezzar had done to Ierusalem, by dishonoring Matrons,
deflouring Virgins, killing little children, tormenting old folkes, burning
houses, their robberies and their spoyles; and yet all these he passeth ouer in
silence; the Prophet (as one that found himselfe thereat much agrieued)
pressing onely the prophanation of the Temple, and that he had made it a
stable for his Horses.
            
               They came about him. Amongst many other things that they
layd to our Sauiour Christs charge, one was, I can destroy the
Temple; wherein they did not only accuse him of blasphemie, for making
himselfe of the same omnipotencie with God; but for his irreuerence also, and
disrespect to the Temple. Saint  
               Augustine in
his booke de Ciuit. Dei, reporteth, That the Goths hauing sackt Rome,
as many as betooke themselues to the Churches of Saint Peter and Saint
Paul, remained free; so much could the respect of sacred places
preuaile with these cruell Barbarians: but it would not serue our Sauiour
Christs turne with the Iewes, though he had made a Law touching the immunitie
of the Temple.
            
               They came about him. Here was that prophecie of
Dauid fulfilled,Lost is that Common-wealth, in
  which Magistrates and their Ministers are both faulty 
               Many calues
encompassed me about, and the fat Buls besieged me. Euthymius saith, That
by your Calues he meanes the common people; and by your Buls, the Noble
men.
            And he saith, That they all came about him, and compassed him
round in forme of a ring; and that they roared like Lyons, and snarled at him
like so many dogges: when in a Common-wealth the bulls are confederat with the
dogs, when the Lyons take part with the wolfes; When your Patritij
ioyne with your Pleybeians, your Nobilitie with the Communaltie, and all to doe
mischiefe, giue that Common-wealth for lost and vndone; when your
Gouernador and his Alguazil; when your Alcalde, and
his Procurador; when your Oydor, and his Escriuano;
when your Secritario and his Oficial, do goe hand in hand
together, it is all one. Chrysostome expounding those words of Saint
Luke, Dimitte nobis Barrabam,
               
                  Luk.
  23. 
               Loose Barrabas, He saith, That they that were theeues, did
desire a theeues libertie. And if they sought so earnestly to saue a theefe,
it was not much that they should condemne the innocent. Esay bewayling
Ierusalems ill hap, who hauing heretofore beene holy, had now turned whore,
entertaining all sorts of men, one while theeues, another while murderers,
&amp;c. Rendring anon after the reason; Principies infideles, socij
furum. It is no maruaile that Princes should strike hands with theeues,
being that they are willing to share with them in their thefts. Heretofore
Princes were wont to fauour the good, and punish the bad. Dauid saith
of himselfe, That when he did bethinke himselfe a mornings, hee propounded to
himselfe not to pardon any notorious offender, nor to spare the life of the
wicked, nor those that were ill members of the Common-wealth. In matutino
interficiebam omnes operantes iniquitatem, Oh what a happy estate of a
Common-wealth was here for a Prince? hating the wicked so much, he could not
chuse but fauour the good. But now the world was growen to that passe, That
your Herods, your Pilats, your High-Priests, and your
Pharisees, in stead of doing of this, when they bethinke themselues in the
morning, they call their Page vnto them, and say, Goe to such a one, remember
my seruice vnto him, and know how he hath slept to night, &amp;c. Now adayes
your Gouernors are adored in their Ministers: because they serue them with the
hands of Iudas, and bring bribes vnto them, strangling Iustice with
this close couetousnesse.
            
               They came about me. They did fill and shut vp the doore
through which hee was to passe, thinking there to make an end of him: but when
either God,God will not suffer his children to fall into
  the hands of the vngodly. or a man whom God fauours, is thus inclosed on
euery side, this hedging of him in will not serue their turne; for he hath
wings to flye from them. To this purpose Dauid being persecuted by
Saul, composed some of his Psalmes. The Kings Souldiers had once
compassed him in round, In modum Coronae, Vowing, that he should not
escape their fingers, vnlesse hee had the wings of a bird to flye from them.
In the Lord put I my trust, Why say you then vnto my soule that she should
flye like a Sparrow to the Mountaines, &amp;c. But hauing God for my
shield and my defence, I may safely lay me downe to sleepe and take my rest. O
Lord, a great squadron may affright a very good man, when he shall see they
haue beset him: But why should I feare as long as thou doest gard and protect
me? Thou art my refuge in tribulation, &amp;c. Saul sent some to
apprehend Dauid; Michal saued his life by letting 
 him out a window, Why did they not follow in pursuit of
him, being so much offended as they were at this tricke, which Mich
                     •
                  l had put vpon them? Some Hebrewes
make answer hereunto, That God had damd vp the window, or cast a myst before
their eyess that they could not perceiue the manner of his escape.
                  Eccl. 21.9. 
               Ecclesiasticus saith, The
congregation of the wicked, is like tow wrapped together: Their end is a flame
of fire to destroy them. An Armie of Reprobates can no more stand against
the godly, than bundles of Towe or Flaxe before a flaming fire.
            
               How long, &amp;c. The Iewes comming round about our
Sauiour, they said vnto him, Quousque, &amp;c. How long doest thou make vs
doubt? As Loue transformeth a man, so doth Hate, Vulnerasti cor meum
soror mea, said the Bridegroome to his Spouse. Another letter hath it,
Excordasti: Which alludeth vnto that which the Spouse answered,
Ego Dormio, &amp; cor meum vigilat. But how can the Spouse sleepe, and
her heart wake? yes, her husband had stolne away her heart, and that waked with
him when she was asleepe. Now Hate, no lesse transformeth than Loue.
Saul did not liue in himselfe, but in Dauid; Haman not in
himselfe, but in Mardochee; the Pharisees not in themselues, but in
Christ. And therfore they say, Thou causest our soules to doubt, Thou
hast robd vs of our soules, we are not our selues, but as bodies without a
soule.
            
               Entry of all sin the worst, and hardest to be
  cared.And in token that the cause of this their suspension, was Enuie,
they confesse these their so many distractions, vexations, and torments of the
mind. All other kind of sinnes bring paine and torment with them, but it is
after they haue tasted of their sinnes; but Enuie torments before hand. The
Pharisees had scarce seen Christs Miracles, and the applause which his doctrine
had in the world, when they began to suffer, and to be grieued. And this is the
reason why this Vice is harder to be cured than any other. Good doth ordinarily
quench ill, as water quencheth fire. But Enuie, because it makes another mans
good his ill, that which to other vices is death, is to Enuy, life. It is the
fire of brimstone, which the more water you throw on it, the more it burneth.
They came about mee like so many Bees who are exasperated and grow
angry with those that doe them no harme but good. They waxed hot like fire
among thornes, which no water can quench.
            
               Animam nostram tollis. Where I would haue thee to weigh
the word Tollis, Thou takest away our soule,Men are
  euer ready to vnburthen themselues of their miseries. Esay
  63. thou makest vs to doubt, &amp;c. Thou art in fault, that we liue in
this paine and passion. It is the common course of your greatest sinners to lay
the blame of their sinne vpon God, O Lord, Why hast thou made vs to erre
from thy wayes (saith Esay) and hardned our heart from thy feare?
It is a sin inherited from Adam, who laid the fault of eating the
apple vpon God, The woman which thou gauest me to be with me,
               
                  Gen. 3. 
               &amp;c. She that thou gauest me
to be my companion, to be my cherisher, and my comforter, Who would haue
thought, that she would haue intreated any thing at my hands, that should not
haue beene very lawfull and honest? The sicke man is wont to lay the fault on
the Clymat wherein hee liueth, and on those meates wherewith hee is nourished.
Seneca tells a tale of a certaine Shee-slaue, who one morning when she
awaked, finding her selfe blind, laid the fault that she could not see, vpon
the house, desiring that she might be remooued to another. The cause of your
Eclypses is the earth, which interposes it selfe betweene the Sunne and the
Moone: Whereas hee that shall impute the fault to the Sun, shall but betray his
ignorance. Of the Eclipses of these Iewes, the cause thereof was their
passions, their couetousnesse, and their enuie. If our Sauiour Christ preached
vnto them, they desired Miracles; if he wrought Miracles, 
 they desired Doctrine; from his workes they appealed to
his words, and from his words to his workes; and laying the fault on the Sun,
they said, Animam nostram tollis, Thou makest vs to doubt.
            
            
               If thou be the Christ, tell vs plainly. In three words
they vttered three notorious lies:The subteltie of the
  Iewes in circumuenting our Sauiour.
            
            The first, Dic nobis palam, Tell vs plainly; for all that
thou hast hitherto sayd vnto vs, is as nothing.
            The second, Dic nobis palam, and we will beleeue
thee.
            The third, Dic nobis palam; for that is the reason why
wee haue not hitherto beleeued thee. Saint Augustine and Saint
Chrysostome haue both obserued, that in these their lies there was a
great deale of craft &amp; subtletie; which was this, That the Iewes did still
presume, that our Sauiour Christ would boast himselfe to bee King of the Iewes,
and that he was temporally to sit in Dauids Throne; &amp; they went
about to draw this from him, that they might haue some ground of accusation
against him; and therefore they thus cried out vnto him, Dic nobis palam,
Tel vs plainly: for in all the rest that they desired of him, our Sauiour
Christ had giuen them full satisfaction. For if Palam be to publish a
thing openly, and not to doe it in hugger-mugger, or in some by-corner or
other, I haue alwayes preached publiquely in your Synagogues, and in the
middest of your Market-places, And I sayd nothing in secret. If
Palam shall carrie with it a kind of boldnesse and libertie, yee may
call to mind my whipping of you out of the Temple, the seueritie of my
reprehensions, and that I called yee the children of the Deuill, that I might
publish your euill thoughts to the world, &amp;c. If Palam shall
signifie, Cleerely or Manifestly, what more cleere or manifest truth could ye
heare, than that which I haue preached vnto you? Wil you that I shal tel you in
a word, who I am, I and the father am one. Of the materiall Sunne a
man may complaine, That an earnest eying of it, and a steadie fixed looking
thereupon, may make vs blind; but on the Sunne of Righteousnesse no man can lay
this fault, for hee himselfe giues that light whereby our eyes are inabled to
see;
                  Psal. 19. 
               The commandement of the
Lord is pure, and giueth light vnto the eyes. And therefore Saint
Paul calls the old Law, Night; and the Law of Grace, Day: In that Law
the Sunne had not shewed it selfe, all was clouds and darkenesse; and albeit
they did inioy some light, it was but a glimpse, or as the light of a candle
through some little chinke; but when the Sonne of God appeared in the flesh,
that darkenesse of the night was driuen away, and the day appeared, &amp;c.
            
               I told yee and yee beleeue not; the workes that I doe in my
fathers name, they beare witnesse of me.
               The Iewes
  wanted nothing to make them beleeue, but a willingnes to beleeue. Our
Sauiour Christ had prooued himselfe to be both God and Man, by such conuenient
meanes, that it had beene follie, if not meere madnesse, to haue desired better
proofs thereof: strong were his reasons, strange his myracles, profound his
discourse. In a word, his words &amp; workes were such, that they made
Admiration stand amased, and Wonder it selfe, to wonder. Your not beleeuing me
(saith our Sauiour) cannot arise from my not speaking vnto you, but from your
wilfulnesse; but if yee will not beleeue in my words, giue credit to my
workes.
            Where by the way it is to be noted, That our Sauiour Christ hauing
innumerable testimonies to alledge in his behalfe, those shall first be
represented vnto you, which are set downe by Saint Iohn, Tres. sunt qui
testimonium dant in Coelo, &amp;c. There are three which beare Record in
Heauen, the Father, the Word,
               1. Iohn
  5.7. 
               and the Holy-Ghost: and there are three which beare record in
the earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the Bloud. Which we haue treated of
at large elsewhere.
            
               
               
                  Io
                        •
                     .
                  
                     •
                  .39. Act.
  10.43.The second is, That of the Prophets and Prophecies, Search the
Scriptures; and they (saith our Sauiour Christ) are they that testifie of
mee. And Saint Peter hee auerreth as much, Omnes Prophetae
testimonium perhibent, To him also giue all the Prophets witnesse,
&amp;c.
            
            And here we may more especially consider with our selues, one
great and singular wonder, That these the Prophets liuing in diuers times and
places, &amp; prophecying different things that should befal our Sauior
Christ; as one, his stripes; another, his buffetings; a third, his patience; a
fourth, his silence, &amp;c. All of them did compose an excellent peece, &amp;
did set forth a most absolute and perfect picture of the Messias, for it was
the hand of the Holy-Ghost that directed the pensill: and, that the seuentie
Interpreters without seeing one another, without conuersing or communicating
their minds, should all of them jumpe and agree so well together, and extract
one and the same originall, was a great wonder. That the Statuaries of Greece,
liuing asunder in different Cities, should frame a figure in seuerall pieces,
one making the leg, another the arme, a third the head, and all of them meet in
handsomenesse, shape, feature, and proportion, as heart could wish; this
likewise (if it be true) was a great wonder. But in the Prophets the
circumstances were farre greater; as that of time, for that they were in
different ages, and of different estates, conditions, and qualities,
&amp;c.
            The third is, The testimonie of his owne myracles; for (as
Athanasius and Iustine Martyr haue noted) by an especiall
Diuine prouidence it was so ordered, that none of the Saints that were either
before or after, could doe any of those same myracles which were prophecyed of
our Sauiour Christ. And this did he himselfe deliuer to the Disciples of
Iohn Baptist, Tell him (saith he) from me, The Blind receiue
sight,
               
                  Mat. 11. 
               the Hault goe, the
Leapers are clensed, the Deafe heare, and the Dead are raised vp,
&amp;c.
            
            The Common people also did testifie of him, Testimonium
perhibebat turba. In conclusion, hauing so many and sundrie testimonies,
he would not here make vse of any other, than the testimonie of his workes.
            
               Why our Sauiour would prooue his Diuinitie by
  no other testimonie than his works.First, because such of vs as remaine
here as his Agents vpon earth, may by this testimonie prooue his Diuinitie.
            Secondly, To the end that no man should pretend to hold himselfe
to bee the Sonne of God by Grace, vnlesse hee giue testimonie thereof by his
workes. There is no great heed to be giuen to words, Quid verba audiam, cum
facta non videam? Our Sauiour Christ would take no notice of those
Virgins who in good words proffered their seruice to the Spouse, but performed
nothing lesse in their deeds, because they had not their Lampes lighted and
readie at hand; Shew me thy faith by thy workes. Clemens Alexandrinus
expounding that place of Saint Mathew,
               
                  Mat.
                  
                     •
                  1. 
               Regnum Coelorum vim
patitur, The Kingdome of Heauen suffers violence; saith, That this force
or violence is not to be done, Contentiosis orationibus, sed rectae vitae
assiduitate.
            
            
               A true Christian glorieth in nothing more,
  than in his sufferings for Christ.And hence was it that many of Gods
Saints did not rest contented with the doing onely of good workes, but by
shewing also some open euidence of them. Nemo mihi molestus

                     •
                  it, (saith Saint
Paul) ego enim stigmata Domini Iesu in corpore meo porto;
Let no man trouble himselfe in enquiring after me, or to aske, Who I am? the
print of the yrons wherewith I am branded in the face, doth plainly speake my
name, and publish to the world my profession and condition. Hee borrowed this
metaphore from your branded slaues, or as Anselmus will haue it, from
some deuice born by the soldiers of the Roman Empire. Saint
Chrysostome ponders the word Porto; a Slaue may beare a marke
in his face, but  makes no great braggs of it, nor indeed
hath any great reason so to do: but Saint Paul he boasts thereof, as
an Ensigne doth of the Colours which hee carries; suting with that of the
Bridegroome, Weare me in thy heart, as a Spouse doth her ring on her
finger, or as a Louer doth his Mistresse fauour on his arme.
            
            
               But yee beleeue not, for yee are not of my Sheepe. Saint
Augustine vnderstands by these Sheepe, the Preachers of Gods Word,
because they heare the voyce of their Sheepheard; but this his opinion may not
stand as a generall sentence.
            First of all, Because many not predestinated, doe beleeue, heare,
and obey, as Iudas, and others that were not of Christs Sheepe.
            And many againe of the Predestinated, did not as then beleeue, (as
S. August. hath noted it) which afterwards came to beleeue. Now the
Sheepe is a fitting figure or symbole of him that is predestinated to
saluation; and touching those in particular to whom our Sauiour sayd, That they
were not of his Sheep, who notwithstanding had enioyed such powerfull and
plentifull meanes to beleeue, if they had beene in the number of Christs
Sheepe, doubtlesse they would haue beleeued: and therefore we are diligently to
weigh these words, Yee beleeue not, &amp;c.
            
            Next, we are to consider the conueniences which are betwixt the
Sheep and the Predestinated.
            The first is, They heare my voyce. There is no liuing
creature more obedient to what he heares, or more apt to heare; the least
whistle of the Sheepheard is the Sheepes North Starre. When God reprehended
Elias at the mouth of the Caue, there came first a great wind, And
God was not in the wind: then anon after came an earthquake, And God
was not in the earthquake: after that, a flaming fire, And God was not
in the fire: at last there came a soft whistling sound, and then God
passed by. But why should he make his appearance in a whistle, or a soft
noyse?Hot fierie Spirits vnfit for the Ministery.
Marrie therein he plainly told the Prophet, You, out of the aboundance of your
zeale and hot fierie spirit, would haue all to be winds, earthquakes, and
lightnings, thundering out nothing but damnation and vengeance; and howbeit I
hold this to be a fitting course to be taken with an idolatrous People, and
such as are Rebells to my House, yet for those that are my Sheep, a whistle or
a milde word is enough.
            The second is, The meekenesse, softnesse, and euennesse of their
nature and condition: Beati mites, B
                     •
                  essed are the Meeke in spirit; your Reprobates are soure,
vnsauorie, and vnquiet: In a word, they are like Goats, you shall scarce meet
with a Reprobate but leads a troubled life, like a Theefe that lookes euery
houre when he shall be hanged,
                  Gen. 4.
  Deut. 28.65, 66, 67. or in such a distraction or deiection as
Cain liued in; Cur concidit facies tua? Why is thy countenance
falne downe? And as it is in Deutronomie, The Lord shall giue thee a
trembling heart, and a sorrowfull mind, and thy life shall hang before thee,
and thou shalt feare both day and night,
               No torture to a
  guilty conscience. 
               and shalt haue none assurance of thy life: in
the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were euening; and at euening thou
shalt say, Would God it were morning; for the feare of thyne heart which thou
shalt feare, and for the sight of thyne eyes which thou shalt see. The
heart of the Wicked is fearefull, and euerie bush represents a Dog vnto him
that bites him. In the middest of all his pleasures Hell represents it selfe to
the Reprobate, his soule is consumed with sorrow, &amp; quasi pendens ante
se, He lookes like one that is condemned to be hanged. But the Iust doth
enioy an inward comfort, a heauenly ioy, singing cherefully with Dauid
that sweet Anthem,
                  Psal. 85. 
               Inhabitat
gloria in terra nostra, &amp;c. Surely his saluation is neere to them that
feare him, that Glorie may dwell in our Land.
            
               The third is, the point of profit. For in
the Sheepe (which signifies the Elect) there is wooll, milke, butter, cheese,
and flesh: But it is not so in the Goat, (whereby are noted the Reprobate) as
hath beene obserued by Saint Hilary and Saint
Chrysostome.
            
            The fourth is, The sheepe walkes in wayes that are plaine, quiet,
and secure: But the goat goes clambring on the tops of dangerous rocks,
browzing amongst bushes and thornes; and at last waxing weary, falls down
headlong to hell. Ambulauimus vias difficiles, lassati sumus via
iniquitatis, Wee haue walked through craggie paths, and haue tyred our selues
in the way of iniquitie.
            
            
               The vngratefulnesse of mans
  nature.
               Many good workes haue I shewed yee: for which of these workes
doe yee stone mee? They tooke vp stones for to stone him, and wh
                  •
               n they had them in their hands ready to
fling at him, he forced their attention, and made them whether they would or no
to hearken vnto him. Many good workes haue I shewed you; for which of these
workes doe ye stone me? It is an easier thing for a man to grow vnthankfull and
forgetfull of a great number of benefits, than one single good turne. One or
two courtesies, men vsually rest thankfull for them, and beare them still in
memorie; But (as the Spaniard sayes) Los muchos, se vienen por muchos,
à oluidar, Many, for that they are many, are forgotten by many.
Their muchnesse,Foure faire mothers that euer bring forth
  foule children. Psal. 106. lessens their remembrance. There are
foure faire mothers that bring forth very foule children: As Truth, enimies;
Familiaritie, contempt; Hope, despaire; and Muchnesse of benefits, muchnesse
of obliuion; Incontinently they forgat his workes. Dauid doth there
treat of the adoration of the golden calfe, and his meditation thereupon is,
That the many fauours that that people had receiued from Gods hands, being so
fresh as they were in their memories, as the flyes, (which for their sakes he
sent to afflict the Aegyptians) frogges, gnats, water turned into blood,
darknesse, the death of their first-borne, the Israelites passing safe through
the red sea, the drowning of Pharaoh and all his charriots and
horsemen, and the Law giuen them on the Mountaine: yet notwithstanding these
great and singular fauours, these wondrous signes and tokens, as the like were
neuer done, that yet for all this, they should like a broken bow so sodainely
start aside, and fall so quickly into so foule a sinne, as none could be more
derogatory from Gods honour, They sodainely forgot his workes. The
greater were Gods benefits, the more was their obliuion. And the reason of it
is, That laying more vpon a mans shoulders than he is well able to beare, it is
a thousand to one that his load and he doe not fall both to the ground. The
lesse the benefits are, the more cheerefully a man receiues them. And why so?
Marry I shall tell you why: Because then there is some hope that a man may liue
to requite them, and to discharge that debt, for the which (in thankfulnesse)
he stands bound. But when they are so great, that we are not able to make
satisfaction, such extraordinarie curtesies, are repayd oftentimes with
vnkindnes, if not with hatred. Thou owest thy neighbour a summe of money, be
it more or lesse, nor does it grieue and afflict thee to see this thy Crediter,
or to looke him in the face, but rather takest pleasure and comfort in his
companie; yet if all that thou art worth, shouldst thou sell thy selfe to thy
very shirt, be not able to discharge that debt, thou hadst as liefe see the
diuell, as him. Quintus Curtius reporteth, that Alexander
grew to hate Antipater, and for no other reason in the world, but that
he had obtained so many victories, and reduced so many nations to his
obedience, that hee did tacitely demand that requitall of him, which he was
not able to make him: and conferring many fauours on those souldiers which had
done him but little seruice, he neglected Antipater that had done him
most. The same reason is to bee  rendred of
Hannibal and Carthage▪ of Lycurgus and Lacedemonia, and
of Saul and Dauid: but there is no example to that of a woman
in this kind; serue her neuer so faithfully, entertaine her neuer so royally,
court her day and night, feede her humorous disposition, wast both thy purse
and thy bodie, and consume all that thou hast to giue her content, yet in the
end will she grow to hate thee; and that which thou thinkest should be the
meanes of winning her, will be the cause of losing her: she will like a
Lymbeck, draw whatsoeuer is good from thee, first by drops, then by drams,
afterwards by ounces, &amp; lastly by pounds, till she haue suckt thee drie,
&amp; that thou hast wholly spent &amp; vndone thy selfe in her seruice. In a
word, (that I may grow to an end) the Iews in those former times were euermore
wonderfully beholding vnto God for those many benefits &amp; fauors which he
had throwne vpon them; but now his grace and mercie (like a Riuer rising from
forth it's bed) extending it selfe so farre, that he came himselfe in person to
visit them, and in such an especiall manner, as none could bee more, saying
particularly vnto them, Non sum missus nisi ad Oues Israel, I am not sent
but to the Sheepe of Israel; Why this was so great a fauour, that it
ouercommeth mans imagination, the weight whereof prest both it and them to the
ground. But God so support vs with his grace, that we may thankefully beare in
our hearts the remembrance of his manifold benefits. To whom, with the Father,
the Sonne, &amp;c.
         
         
            THE XXXVI. SERMON, VPON THE THVRSEDAY AFTER PASSION
SVNDAY.
            
               
                  LVC. 7. 
                  
                     Rogabat Iesum quidam Pharisaeus, vt manducaret cum illo,
  &amp;c.
                   
                  A certaine Pharisee requested Iesus, That he would eat with him,
  &amp;c.
               
            
            
               
                  ROgabat Iesum, &amp;c. And one of the Pharisees desired
Iesus, that he would eat with him.The Circumstances of
  Maries perdition. The whole Historie of Marie Magdalen is
reduced to these three estates:
            Of a Sinner; Of a Penitent; Of a Saint.
            For all which she was most famous.
            In that her first estate of her

                  •
               ewd course of life, she obtained a
plenarie pardon, and full remission of her sinnes. Were she either Widow (as 
 Saint Hierome would haue it) or one that was
neuer married, (as common opinion cries it) Petrus Chrysologus saith,
That she had made the Citie so infamous, that she might more fitly be called,
Peccatum Hierosolimae, quam Peccatrix, The Sinne of Ierusalem, than a
Sinner; because by reason of the bad fame and euill report that went of
her, the whole Citie did suffer therein, and was in a manner spoyled and
vndone; some being taken with her beautie, others with her gracefull
behauiour, not a few with the pleasantnesse of her wit and liberall language;
but most with her ill example, occasioning murmuration in some, &amp;
obduration in othersome, causing them not onely to speake ill, but also to doe
ill: In a word, shee was Pestis generalis, A generall plague, and
Commune scandalum, A common scandall to all.
            
            The circumstances of her perdition were strange:
            
               The sin of dishonest
                     •
                  e hath two p
                     •
                  opertiesFirst, In that her sinne was a sinne of dishonestie;
wherein wee vsually see these two effects:
            
               It sticks of all others the closest
  to the Soule.The one, That it clings like bird-lime to our soules.
Thomas saith, That it is Peccatum maximae inhaerentiae, That
it is a sinne of all other that cleaueth closest vnto vs, and stickes longest
by vs. Saint Hierome, That it much resembleth the Bird called the
Phoenix, which doth reuiue and renew her selfe with the fire which she kindleth
with the motion of her wings. Thou mournest, thou bewailest and repentest thee
of the dishonest sinne which thou hast committed, and desirest to giue it
ouer, &amp; that it may dy in thee; but with the wings of thy thoughts thou
blowest those coles afresh, and makest them flame more than before, so that
thinking to kill the lusts of the flesh, thou doost quicken them &amp; giue
them new life; so that what thou bewailedst before for dead, thou now embracest
as liuing, and huggest it in thy bosome, as a man claspes his deerest friend in
his armes, that after some long swoune recouers againe. A holy Hermit that led
a deuour and solitarie life, talking one day with the Deuill, demanded of him,
Which amongst the Sinnes, was the greatest? He told him, Dishonestie. And he
replying, What, are not Blasphemie, Murther, and Swearing, far greater sinnes?
Whereun
                  •
               o he answered, In point of
Diuinitie these are the greatest; but the Rents and In-comes of the sinnes of
the flesh are farre greater: and this is the reason why I doe not tempt any
with blasphemie or murther, but some one desperate person or other; but with
dishonestie, all sorts of men; the Merchant imployes his Stocke in that kind
of trading which shall turne most to his commoditie, the Vsurer puts forth his
moneys where he may haue most profit, and best securitie. There is not any
other sinne that like a plague hath spred it selfe so generally ouer the
world,
                  Gen. 6. as that of the Flesh; and this
was the cause that God repented himself that he had made man: and if at any
time in the world there hath been any one that hath shewed himselfe so valiant
as to resist the assaults of hell, yet in the end the verie same partie hath
beene shrewdly encountred with the concupiscence of the flesh, as Saint
Gregorie hath noted it of Salomon, Et non custodiuit quae
mandauit ei Dominus,
               3. Reg. 11. It made
him breake Gods command.
            
               It bli
                     ••
                  s the Vnderstāding.The other effect is, that it blinds the
Vnderstanding, as wee shall shew you hereaf
                  •
               er.
            The second circumstance is, That it is an impudent and shamelesse
sinne; Marie Magdalen by this meanes losing all feare of God, and
shame of the world. When a Riuer runnes betweene two banks well planted with
trees which serue as wals to hedge it in, the waters thereof doe no harme; but
if these Riuers breake their bankes, and make their way ouer those walls, they
ouerflow and spoyle all that is in their way. Whilest our life shall bee
bounded in betwixt shame and feare,  no great harme can
come of i
                  •
               
               ▪ but when a Soule
shall liue deuoyd of shame or feare, Lord haue mercie vpon it. Our Sauiour
Christ, taking it to be the extremitie and vtmost of all euill, said of a
Iudge, I neither feare God nor Man: He that shall cast vp his accounts
with Heauen aboue, and with his Honour here beneath, and when he hath made this
reckoning, shall thinke with himselfe, that hee hath nothing to lose, What
bridle can rest
                  •
               aine him? One of
the reasons why God commanded, That a man should not defame his neighbour, was,
That he should not make his sinne perdurable. Saint Hierome saith,
That we should rather priuatly admonish, than publiquely punish, Lest if
such a one should once lose shame, he should dwell in his sinne for euer.
Amongst noble Natures, Honour is the bridle of Vice; and in case they should
not professe Vertue, yet will they haue a care to vphold their credit. Saint
Augustine saith, That God did not augment the Monarchie of the Romans
for their vertue, because whilest they adored false gods they could hardly
professe it; but because hauing set Honour before their eyes, it was a great
bridle to curbe in their vices.
            The third circumstance is, That she should purchase her selfe the
name of a Sinneresse in so populous a Citie. This was it that made the
Euangelist say, Behold, a woman in the Citie which was a Sinner,
(this of Saint Luke was a great endeering of the offence) De qua
septem Daemonia eiecerat, Out of whom hee had cast seuen Deuils. Now by
these seuen Deuils is to bee vnderstood the manifoldnesse of her sinnes; this
is Saint Gregories opinion: but Saint Ambrose will haue
thereby to be vnderstood seuen reall Deuils indeed, He dried vp the issue
of bloud in Martha, and droue out the Deuils in Marie; and it is no small
proofe thereof, that two Euangelists should expresse the same in plain and ful
words: for when one Euangelist sets downe a thing in darke and obscure termes,
another vsually explaines the same; but Saint Marke and Saint
Luke both, herein agree and say, Out of whom he had cast seuen
Deuils; and Saint Hierome in the life of H
                     •
                  lar
                     •
                  on and Prosper likewise affirmeth, That this was a
chastisement which God did often vse in great sinnes.
            The fourth circumstance is, The great hurt which she occasioned to
the souls and bodies of men, a great cause whereof was her extreame
beautie.
            
               Sambucus,
               The force of Beautie.
amongst some of his Emblemes which hee hath made of humane beautie, he paints
forth in one of them, a Lyon, a Hare, a Fowle, and a Fish; for there is not any
creature more couragious than a Lyon, nor any more cowardly than a Hare; nor
any creature higher than the Fowle, nor lower in his mansion than the Fish; all
which, render and yeeld themselues prisoners to beautie. Balac liued
in great feare of Gods People, and when he could not get Balaam to
curse them, aduising with his Councell, (Balaam being the first
proiector) he sent (as Lyra noteth it) a squadron of the fairest women
that his Countrie could affoord, amongst the Israelites, who did beare in their
Banner for their Deuice the Image of Belphegor; and they who before
did seeme to that King to be inuincible, rendred themselues captiues to the
beautie of those Moabitish women; Et initiati sunt Belphegor, &amp;
comederunt sacrificia mortuorum, They married them, and adored their
Idoll; and (as Iosephus sets it downe) it was not onely the common
people, but many of the chiefest amongst them, that offended in this kind. For
the flesh being not onely baited, but blinded with this outward beautie, it
hath no eyes to behold the light of the Sunne, Supercecidit ignis,
(that is) The fire of Concupiscence fell downe, and they saw not the
Sunne: The light of myne eyes is not with me; thus Dauid
discoursed with himselfe, treating of his adulterie.
                  
                     
                        •
                     osea 7. 
               Osee
compareth Adulterie, to a heated Ouen, whence comes forth the flame which
burnes, and  the smoke which blindes. Seest thou a man
besotted with the loue of this or that woman,Adultry
  compared to a heated Ouen. and of that doting affection towards her,
that hauing 
                  •
               uffered for her sake,
in his honor, his estate, and his health; if he do not take vp himselfe in
time, and looke out some remedy for this sore, you may boldly say he is blind.
Saint Iohn painting foorth the fall of Lucifer, saith, That
the bottom lesse pit was opened with a key; (for Lucifer, according
to Rupertus, had the first handsell of hell) and from forth that
infernall pit, there went out such a thicke smoke, that it darkened the Sun and
the Starres. And this is the stampe and figure of him that shall throw himselfe
downe headlong into the bottomlesse pit of dishonestie, whence commeth forth so
much smoke, that it blindeth the Sun of the vnderstanding, and darkneth those
starres of the faculties of the soule.
            From these circumstances do I draw the difficulty of Mary
Magdalens Conuersion; grounding my supposition vpon these three
truths.
            
               Gods glorie greater in our conuersion than
  creation.The first, That for God to iustifie a soule, is a farre greater
matter than to create heauen and earth, and all that therein is. This hath
beene prooued elsewhere. And Iob exprest as much, when he said, The
creating of me was the least of thy mercies towards me, Exaltare
(saith Dauid) Exalt thy selfe ô God aboue the
heauens,
               
                  Psal. 108. 
               and let thy
glory be vpon all the earth, that thy beloued may bee deliuered. So that
if we should put into the one hand of God, the world created; and into the
other, a soule conuerted; the glory of this hand is the greater. And there are
two very good reasons for it:
            The one, For that in the creating of the world, God had no
repugnancie or resistance;To conuert a sinner, is a worke
  of wondrous difficultie in regard of mans peruersnesse. but in the
conuerting of a soule, he may meet with opposition, by reason of mans peruerse
will, Et qui creauit te sine te, non saluabit te sine te, For though bee
created thee without thy will, he will not saue thee w
                     •
                  thout thy will. God takes more pleasure in
conuerting a soule, than in all the rest of those wonders which he wrought with
his hands, Auerte oculos tuos à me, quia ipsi me auolare fecerunt,
Turne away thine eyes from me; for euen they haue made me flye away.
Auolare is the same in that place, as Superbire, inflare. Rabby
Salomon renders it, Insolentior factus sum animo. To see thy eyes
heretofore so withdrawne from me, and now so busie in beholding

                  •
               e. So great is the contention,
which is betwixt the loue of God, and the loue of the world, betweene the
desires of the flesh, and of the Spirit, That the one doth striue to take the
sword out of the others hand: 
 
                  —Alterius vires, subtrahit alter amor.
               
            
            
               Plotinus calls Loue a Painter: Diuine Loue, that paints;
and humane Loue, that paints: This painteth forth our felicitie in riches,
beauty, and feasting; That, in pouerty, teares, and fasting. For, to ingraue
such an image as this in our hearts, to paint such a picture, we must blot out
all those colours, which any other loue hath drawne there.
            The other, For that in creating the world, God did not shew
himselfe to bee weary, but made it as it were a kind of entertainment, and
passe-time, Ludens in orbe terrarum: But in redeeming mankind, he was
wearied out, euen to the shedding of his blood, and the loosing of his
life.
            The second truth is, That it is the easiest thing in the world
with God, to inrich a sinner with his grace. God sent Ieremy to the
Potters house, who beginning to worke vpon a peece of clay, it not fadging to
his mind, he tore it in sunder, and molding it anew, fashioned it afterwards
to his owne good liking and content. Cānot I deale by you as the potter doth
with his clay? Is my power lesse than his? Noah kept a Lyon in the
Arke, but he continued still a Lyon. But our Sauiour Christ in his Church
turnes the Lyon into a Lambe, The pots in the Lords 
house shall be like the bolls before the Altar. Saint Ierome
saith,
                  Zachar. 14. That he did prophetically
decypher the time of the new Law, wherein the black-souted Caldrons, should bee
so bright and beautifull,The iustification of a sinner,
  set out by diuers apt similitudes. that they should serue for flagons
full of flowres, and bolls of sweet and pretious odours. Esay treating
of the facilitie wherewith God doth worke this change and alteration, draweth
his comparison from a little cloud, which a contrary wind taketh, and makes it
disappeare in a moment, I shall put away thy transgressions like a cloud,
and thy sinnes as a myst.
               
                  Esay 44.
               Ecclesiasticus compares it vnto yce, which the Sunne no sooner shines
vpon, but it is melted, Thy sinnes shall melt away as the yce in the faire
weather.
               
                  Eccles. 3.16. 
               Dauid
borroweth his comparison from a frozen Torrent, set vpon by a furious
South-west wind, and letting loose those waters, causeth them to leape out of
their beds. For your frost and yce are the waters fetters which keepe them
close prisoners, Hibernis vinculis soluta, saith Nazianzene.
And Niuale compede vinctum, saith Horace of the riuer Iberus.
But all these comparisons are too large and spatious in respect of Gods least
breath, which in an instant doth banish sinne from our breasts, and inricheth
it with grace.
            The third, That in regard of Man, it is a thing of great
difficulty; especially, if the foule fiend hath got the masterie and
possession of our will. When a man hath hyred a house for terme of life, with
the liking and consent of it's owner, for to put such a one out, we must
necessarily haue the absolute Posse and power of the king, we must
haue his authority to turne him out. The diuell hauing taken a long lease of
the house of thy soule, with thy good liking and consent, thou must haue Gods
absolute power to eiect him, and thrust him out: Not that the diuell is so
powerfull as some make him, howbeit the Scripture tearmeth him, Vectem
concludentem, a strong bolt which goes athwart a doore;
                  Prou. 30. and Serpentem tortuosum, a
winding serpent which clewes himselfe vp close, and vpon the least aduantage
takes hold (like the Cuttle-fish) with his clawes; but because God, howbeit he
can doe whatsoeuer he will, is now and then content to giue him leaue to worke
vpon our will.
            This difficultie is somewhat the more increased,Woman the hieroglyphike of weaknes. Prou. 30. in
regard that Mary Magdalen was a woman, which is the Hyerogliph of
weakenes, There be three things (saith Salomon) hidden
from me, yea foure that I know not. The Hebrew letter saith, Three or
foure things are too hard for me. The Hebrew renders the word,
Admirabiles. The Seuentie, Impossibiles, Impossible for him
to know. On the one side, because they are wreathing and winding too and fro;
on the other, because they leaue no signe or print behind thē: the one is of
an Eagle in the aire; the other of a Serpent vpon a stone; the third, of a ship
in the midst of the sea, and the fourth, of a young man in his youth (being so
mutable a creature, and so full of foolish longings.) Euen such is the way of
an adulterous woman, Which eateth and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I haue
not done ill. When a woman is greedy in deuouring good morsells in secret
behind the doore, and wiping her lips, tells the world she hath fasted and
eaten nothing all that day; when shee commits folly in a corner, and boasts her
selfe in publike to be honest, saying, There is not that woman liuing that
liues more honestly than I doe; the diuell hauing taken such possession of her
soule, it is a desperate peece of businesse.
            All these circumstances of difficultie, and many more which wee
omit to set downe, are to be found in this storie. But in those things that to
vs seeme impossible, God is wont to shew his wisedome and his power, Great
is the Lord, and great is his power. And as a Physition (saith Saint
Augustine) doth take pleasure sometimes to light vpon an incurable
infirmitie, not so much for his gaine as his  fame;Maries conuersion affordeth hope to the most desperate
  sinners▪
                
               Non quaerens mercedem, sed commendans artem; So
was Christ well contented with this occasion, Ad informationem eorum, qui
credituri sunt, For the better informing of those that were to beleeue.
To giue knowledge (saith the Apostle) to all sinners, That there is in God a
power, a wisedome, and a will, for to heale them of their infirmities, be they
neuer so foule and enormious. So that this conuersion is the bayte of humane
hopes, and the reparation of our desperation. Had we none other to cast our
eyes vpon in the Church, but the Virgin Mary, and Iohn
Baptist; where were our hopes? The Church therefore doth set two
Maries before vs. The one free from sinne, the other full of sinne.
The one takes away Vaine-glory from all the righteous, and the other banisheth
Cowardise and despaire from all sorts of sinners. At the presence of the
Sunne, all the lights of heauen withdraw themselues, and hide their heads in a
cowardly kind of fashion; but when the Moone once begins to shine, they recouer
their former boldnes and libertie. The Sunne presideth ouer the sonnes of the
day; the Moone ouer the children of the night. Hee that cannot come to be a
Sunne, let him liue in hope to be a Moone,
                  Osee
  2. or a Starre. What sayes Hosee? I will giue her the valley of
Achor, for the doore of Hope. The Prophet there touching vpon the Historie
of Achan, who in the spoyles of Ierico hid the golden wedge, contrary
to Ioshuas proclamation, wherewithall God was so offended, That the
Army marching to a City called Ay, was ouerthrowne, and the Israelites turning
their backs like so many hares, it seemed the doore of Hope was shut against
them for entring into the Land of Promise. But the delinquent being conuinced,
and stoned to death in the valley of Achor, and all his familie, God
foorthwith gaue them victorie ouer their enemies. And therefore he saith,
I will giue them the Valley of Achor for a doore of Hope. Saint
Ierome renders it in another letter, I will giue to my Church the
valley of peruersenesse, or of the peruerse, for to raise vp the hopes of
deiected hearts, as a Paul, a Mary Magdalen, &amp;c. All this
concerneth that her condition and state of sinne wherein she stood; which Saint
Luke painteth forth in those his first words, Behold a woman in
the City which was a sinner.
            
            
               Of Maries repentance.That we may the
better treat of the second State, touching her Repentance, it is to be
supposed, that Mary Magdalen had heard some sermons of our Sauio
                  •
               r Christ (as heretofore hath beene
prooued) and that our Lord did direct his discourse to a soule that had
sustained so many losses, one while proposing the shortnesse of this our life;
another while, the fearefull horrours of death, together with the bitternesse
of sinne, the terrour of iudgement, the torments of hell, &amp;c. Why shouldst
thou so highly prize thy beauty, that thou shouldst adore it? Why, being the
Image of God in thy soule and thy body, shouldst thou be so much affected to
the foulenesse of sinne? What was it that made the Angels so foule? &amp;c.
smelling so sweet of Amber, Muske, and Ciuet, how canst thou endure the euill
sauour of hell? Pro sua in odore, foetor, Thy soft bed is wearisome
vnto thee, and being not able to abide in it all night long, thou shiftest thy
bed, and canst thou then endure the bed of eternall flames, moth-eaten
mattresses, sheetes of snakes, and bolster and pillowes of wormes gnawing
continually on thy conscience? Thou changest thy gownes and thy dressings twice
or thrice a day, and canst thou suffer the euerlasting rayment of hell fire?
The daintiest dishes are set before thee to feed on; and canst thou endure
that hunger, where tongues are bitten off and fed on? Fame pascentur, vt
canes manducauerunt linguas suas prae dolore. Thou canst not abide in thy
house, no not one houre; and canst thou liue clapt vp in the dungeon of
eternall death and damnation? O how  many lye there in
endlesse paines and torments, neuer to be released, for far lesser sinnes than
thine! What canst thou hope for, what canst thou expect? Is it that the earth
should swallow thee vp aliue, as it did Dathan and Abiram? Or
that fire should come downe from heauen and consume thee, as it did
Sodom? or that God should showre downe lightning and thunder vpon
thee, as he did vpon Sisera? what can such a mad foolish woman thinke
will become of her, when she growes thus bold and presumptuous? Oh, if thou
wouldest but weigh with thy selfe what thou loosest, and that which thou
mightest gaine! as also the hurt that thou doest vnto thy selfe! Oh, if thou
didst but see the miseries whereunto thy sinnes haue brought thee! Thou hast
beene so haled and pulled by that infernall Wolfe, that thou hast scarce an
eare left to heare thy Shepheards whistle. And yet for all this I come through
the bushes and bryars, and those steepe and dangerous rocks of thy sins, to
look thee out, and like a sheep that hath been long lost and found againe, I
desire to bring thee backe againe to the fold vpon my shoulders. Oh, if thou
didst but see the inward loue of my bowels; or if thou didst but know the great
danger thou art in; or if thou couldest but loath this thy lewd and euill life!
&amp;c.
            With this threatning sermon, expressing so many and such terrible
hellish horrours, Mary Magdalen was mightily mooued, her heart melted
within her, and Gods Iustice did beat so strongly at the doore of her brest,
that at last she let him in. For in a word, his words are that fire which
warmeth soules, that hammer which breakes the hardnesse of our hearts, that
shaft which pierceth the bones and marrow, that sword which diuideth the reynes
in sunder, and that induction which gaue an accomplishment and final
conclusion to the rarest Repentance that euer was seene.
            
               And when she knew, &amp;c. God gaue her knowledge.
            First, of her sinne.
            Secondly, of the danger of her soule.
            Thirdly, of the misery of her estate.
            The Law entred in by giuing her this knowledge, Wee had not
knowne sinne, but by the Law. And Saint Paul saith, Death
raigned from Adam to Moses, it ended in Moses. For the written
Law gaue vs some light; but that of Grace, much more.
            Now besides this generall help, God did inlighten Mary
Magdalen, by discouering the foulenesse of those vices which she loued,
and the fairenesse of that vertue which she hated.
            Touching their foulenesse, notable is that place of
Dauid,
               The foulenes of sinne. 
               Illuminans
mirabiliter à montibus aeternis, turbati sunt omnes insipientes
corde, God doth inlighten the sinner, that he may see the face of his
sinnes, from the which hee will flye the more, if he shall but behold those
foule fiends of hell. This is a remedy wherewith God cureth the greatest
infirmities. Where by the way it is to bee noted, that the rule for the griefes
of the body, is farre different from those of the soule: In those, the sicke
patient hath a breathing time of ease, and by degrees growes better till the
danger be past; but in these he growes worse and worse. The husband is sicke;
his wife sayes vnto him, Por mi vida, que no es nada, My life for
yours,
               We may dally with the sicknes of the bodi
                     •
                  , not of the soule. 
               it is a

Ladies fit, a gentle visitation. The Physitians they withdraw themselues out
of the roome, and consult in secret, that they may not dishearten their
patient. And that this should be so, it importeth much for the body: 
 but for the soule, that which is fittest for it, is to
notifie vnto it, that it is either at Heauens doore, or Hells gate. Saint
Augustine confesseth, that his conuersion was by these steps, Tu
autem retorquebas me ad meipsum, vt viderem quam vlcerosus essem, Thou
hast notified vnto me (ô Lord) my danger, by making mee to turne mine
eyes vpon my selfe, that I might see my sores: aduising me of that which
Ieremy vttereth, Thy wound is incurable.
            
            God likewise did Mary Magdalen a great fauour, in
discouering vnto her the faire and beautiful face of Vertue,The fairenes of vertue. kindling in her brest those hot
coles of Loue. A sinner in his vices and vaine pleasures, is like vnto a horse,
of whom Iob saith, That in hearing the noyse of the trumpet sounding
to warre, hee enters into the battaile with great courage, scorning all kind of
feare whatsoeuer. Vertue (me thinks) should not be of worse condition. And the
iust knowing his own strength, and how faire and beautifull he is in Gods
sight, it is not much that hee should couragiously enter the listes, laying
aside all feare.
            Secondly, she knew the season of this her happinesse, That
Iesus sat at Table in the house of Simon the Leper, and shee would not
loose so faire an opportunitie; which being once lost is hardly recouered. The
vocations and inspirations of God,
                  Psal. 78.
are euery dayes example, The waters saw thee and were afraid, the depths
trembled, the cloudes powred out water, the heauens gaue a sound, thy arrowes
went abroad, the voyce of thy thunder was round about, the lightnings lightned
the world, &amp;c. Saint Augustine saith, That the Prophet here
treateth of the effect of Gods word, and compares it to those things which
passe and quickly disappeare, as the noyse of a rushing of waters, or of some
greatwhirle-wind, or arrowes shot with a strong arme, or of thunder and
lightning. These are things whilest they last, which doe much amase, mooue, and
disquiet vs, The earth saw it and was mooued at it. But these things
doe not long continue, but quickly passe away. And therefore our good
consisting in it's good effect, it were a great lasinesse and foule
slothfulnesse in vs not to take occasion by the foretop. What sayes Lucan?
Semper nocuit differre paratis?
               Good occasions must be
  embraced with speed. 
               Sophonias? Coruus super liminari, Cras,
cras. Saint Ierome hath obserued that the Hebrew letter
signifies a knife; In token that the deferring of a good occasion, is the knife
that cuts our soules, and the sword that kills them. The damned doe eternally
bewaile their lost occasion, Desideria occidunt pigrum, For the
sluggard desires, and desires, and holds one hand vpon another, but neuer sets
his hand to any thing; but Mary Magdalen, vt cognouit, As soone as shee
knew that Iesus was in Simons house, &amp;c. The Euangelist saith not,
That she stayed to take her Mantle with her, nor that she opened any coffer, or
tooke any Balsamum out of such or such a boxe, but, vt cognouit,
as soone as she knew where he was, she bestirred her stumpes, and made
all the hast she could. And when she knew that hee sat at Table in the
house of Simon the Leaper, it was a watchword vnto her, that this was
now a fit time for her to come vnto him. For hee that would not loath the
company of a Leper, and pardon those faults which that Table might afford,
would not be queasie stomackt towards a sinner,
                  Cant. 5.4. &amp;c. My welbeloued put in his hand
by the hole of the doore, and mine heart was affectioned towards him. My
welbeloued his putting in of his hand, is my calling of me. And therefore our
Sauiour Christ when he saw Mary Magdalens modestie, and that out of
bashfulnesse she forbore to presse too neere vpon him, he made signes vnto
her, imboldning her thereb
                  •
                to
come vnto him.
            
               She brought a boxe of oyntment, &amp;c. This was a
certaine signe and assured token of her generall change and alteration. In the
old Law, those women that did wholy giue ouer the world, and did consecrate
themselues to the Temple, did  offer vp those glasses,
wherein they before beheld themselues, being a iewell of great esteeme amongst
women, as being a meanes to preserue their beauties, and repaire those wrongs
that any spot of foulenesse should doe the face: And Moses made a
Lauatorie of Copper, for the Priests to wash themselues in, adorning the same
with these kind of glasses. For she that shall forgo the world, and strip her
selfe of all euen to her very glasse, wherein she was wont to looke, the
holiest Priests may looke that woman in the face without sinning.
            There are certaine sinners which will not let slip any occasion
that offers it selfe vnto them. Petrus Chrysologus likens these vnto
diuells. Amongst the Gergesenes, our Sauiour Christ commanding the diuells
that they should come out of those men that liued in the fields in the
Sepulchres and graues of the dead, as if they were houses of peace and
pleasure, they besought him that he would suffer them to goe into the heard of
Swine, to wit, out of one filthy place into another; and so in like manner
from sinne to sinne. Others there are, that all their life long, haue tyde
themselues fast to Occasions girdle, &amp; haue as it were sworn and made a
vow, neuer to forsake her: These two sorts of sinners Ieremie pointed
at; If the Blackemore can change his skinne, or the Leopard his spots;
Now, which will first change his skinne and condition, either the tanned
Negro,
                  Ier. 3. or the spotted Tygar? The
sinner which lyes at racke and manger,Relapses into sin are
  dangerous. and is chained fast to the ring of the cratch, or he that
accustomes and vses himselfe to change and alter euery houre; and like the
Cameleon, puts on as many colours as come neere him; Which of these two Estates
I say is the more dangerous? I answer, That amongst Reprobat people there is
not a pin to chuse: But amongst those sinners that hope for heauen, That of the
Cameleon seemeth to bee the more dangerous; because it may be presumed from
his ordinary reincidencie, that in the confession of his sinnes, he neuer
truely repents himselfe of them; whence great Sacriledges are wont to succeede.
But for the other, it may so fall out, That hee may be as constant in good, as
he hath beene before in ill.
            
               And she stood at his feet behind him. Retrò, at his
backe; Whence we may consider a wonderfull and strange kind of
change▪
               God will neuer e
                     •
                  e our sins, if we wil eye them our selues. When
Mary Magdalen did cast her sinnes behind her backe, God did set them
before his eyes: but when Mary Magdalen did set them before her eyes,
and grew fearefull and timerous to looke him in the face, and had not the heart
to presse into his presence that was to be her soules best Physician, God did
cast her sinnes behind his backe. Saint Augustine touches vpon this
string, vpon those words of Dauid; Auerte faciem tuam à peccatis
meis, Turne aside thy eyes ô Lord from my sinnes. Oh thou sinner
(saith the same Father) I shall giue thee a good remedy for this, Tu inde
non auertas, Doe not thou turne thine eyes from off thy sinnes, and God
will turne away his: but if thou shalt cast them behind thy backe, Gods eye
will be still vpon them, and punish them seuerely in thee.
            
               Standing behind. In that looking-glasse of Christ, she
saw the foulenesse of her soule, and she startled at it, Statuam contra te
faciem tuam. In a glasse that which is faire, seemeth more faire; and that
which is foule, more foule. There are some glasses which makes all those
appeare faire which fall within the view of them. A glasse standing in a
window, makes the opposite wall glitter and shine the more. The Raine-bow
leaues that fairest, which leaneth neerest to it. The Sunne setting vpon a
darke cloud, makes him become as bright as gold. In like manner our Sauiour
Christ layd open to Mary Magdalen the foulenesse of her sinnes, that
he might leaue her more faire and more beautifull than shee was before.
            
               
               Standing behind. Petrus Chrysologus
cryes out, Mary Magdalen what meanest thou by this? Commest thou as
one that is sicke to seeke a Physition, and when thou shouldst come to him,
doest thou flye from him? Whereunto he answers, That as one vnworthy to looke
him in the face, she made choise to stand behind him; and if it possibly could
haue beene, she would not that he should haue seen her; though such was her
wretched case, That she was driuen to desire his fauour and best furtherance.
The sick Patient cannot flye from the Physition which is willing to cure him.
In this perplexitie and anguish of her soule, shee resolued with her selfe to
shunne the sight of our Sauiour Christ, though not vtterly put her selfe out
from his presence. Dauid did desire of God, that he would not forsake
him in his anger, nor go away from him in his displeasure: Which seemeth
cōtrary to that rule of S. Paul, Giue place to wrath; and contrary to
Iobs desire, Quis mihi det, vt in Inferno protegas me, &amp;
abscondas me, donec transeat furor tuus, &amp;c. Saint Augustine
saith,The way to flie from God, is to flie vnto him.
That if it were possible for a sinner to flye from God, it were not the worst
remedie to hide himselfe whilest his furie be ouerpast and his anger quite
gone. But it being of necessitie, that he must fall into Gods hands, and that a
sinner can no where hide himselfe from his all-seeing eye, the best counsell
were to aduise him, That to escape Gods hands, hee should put himselfe into
Gods hands, and prostrate himselfe at his feet. Ionas flying from God,
told the Marriners, I feare the Lord God of heauen, which made the sea, and
the dry land. If God then be the God both of sea and land, Why didst thou
seeke to flye from him by going to sea?
            
               By or neere vnto his feet. When a Huntsman woundeth a
Deere with a forked arrow that is sent from a strong bow, though the Deere may
bound and stand vp for a while, yet at last he sinkes and falls downe at the
Keepers foot. Our Sauiour Christ had wounded Mary Magdalen with the
arrow of his word, he strooke her to the very heart, the barbes thereof
sticking in the sides of her soule, Sagittae potentis acutae cum carbonibus
dissolatorijs. This Deere of his was so sorely wounded, That she was
forced to fall downe at his feet in the house of Simon the Leaper. One
of the greatest glories that was prophesied of our Sauiour Christ, was, That he
should make his enemies his foot-stoole. And in another place, His enemies
shall bow themselues downe before him, and licke the earth. And this is
one of the greatest happinesses that can befall Gods enemie.
            
               And she fell a weeping. Pliny saith, That one of the
Offices which Nature bestowed on the eyes,The office of the
  Eye. was, That they might serue as a Limbeck or Stillatorie to the
heart; from whence it might distill it's sadnesse and sorrow, and easing it
selfe of so heauy a load, it might thereby inioy some comfort. Saint
Gregory expounding that place of the Lamentations, Mine eye
casteth out water, because the comforter that should refresh my soule, is
farre from me, saith, That as the Gardiner doth deriue the water from the
Estanque or poole where it is kept, and conueyes it to the borders in
the garden, or the plants in the orchard: so a true Penitent ought to direct
the teares of his eyes to euery one of those sinnes which he hath committed.
And because Mary Magdalens teares were many, the Euangelist saith,
That she did Rigare lachrymis, Showre downe teares. Saint
Bernard saith, That teares worke two effects:
            
               Tea
                     •
                  es worke two effe
                     ••
                  s.The one, To water the heart.
            The other, To wash it.
            And therefore he that doth not gutter downe teares, hath commonly
a hard and a foule heart. Hard, because teares are they that soften and
mollifie the  heart, as Water doth the earth: And as in a
ground that is destitute of water, howbeit Fruit may grow therein, yet doth it
neuer come to it's perfect ripenesse, It withered as soone as it came vp,
because it wanted moysture. In like sort, the Soule which is not made
tender with teares, although it may bud forth some flowers and leaues of good
intentions, yet it neuer comes to beare fruit. Foule, because there is not that
Collyrium or medicine which can so clense and cleere the eyes of the Soule, as
Teares, though the eyes of the bodie should waxe blind with weeping.
            
               She began to fall a weeping. We know the beginning of
these teares, but not the end; for that fountaine of teares which had it's
Well-head and spring at the feet of our Sauiour Christ, did neuer grow emptie
or drie in the eyes of Marie Magdalen. Saint Basil askes the
question, How it comes to passe that teares sometimes should come vpon vs
without desiring them, and at other times, though we desire them neuer so much,
we are not able to shed a teare? And his reason is, That we haue them now &amp;
then, God being willing to giue vs a taste of them; for the Soule that once
tasteth of the sweetnesse of teares, will not leaue them for a world: for, as
those vapors that are exhaled from those salt and bitter waters of the sea,
being conuerted into clouds, are afterwards resolued into a sweet and sauorie
water; so those sighes and sobbs arising from a sad and sorrowfull Soule for
hauing offended the Maiestie of God, beeing conuerted into Clouds of feare,
resolue themselues at last into most sweet &amp; most sauorie teares.Teares sometimes denied vs for our punishment.
Otherwhiles God denies them vnto vs, though we seeke after them neuer so much,
in punishment of our forepassed negligence: for it is no reason that hee should
on the sudden inioy so great a good, who by long exercise hath not deserued
them.
            Saint Augustine after that he was conuerted, saith, That
his eyes were two Fountaines, and that he was verie well pleased they should
bee so; Fluebant lachrymae, &amp; bene mihi erat cum illis. Dauid
after that he had sayd, That euery night he washed his couch with teares; that
is, Per singulas noctes, Night after night;Teares
  for sin must neuer haue an end. (according to Saint
Chrysostome) he addeth, Amplius laua me, he calleth for more
and more teares still: for weeping must haue a beginning, but neuer haue an
ending. In Heauen God onely dries vp our teares once and no more. God
shall wipe away euerie teare from their eyes. But Marie Magdalens
teares,Teares the delight of a Penitent. many a
time and oft did hee wipe; for enioying through her teares so great a good,
shee then tooke most pleasure when she wept most. Iacob had put on a
purpose, neuer to leaue off weeping as long as he liued; Surely I will goe
downe vnto the Graue to my sonne mourning, I shall neuer haue drie eyes till I
see my sonne Ioseph. If he did desire to shed such eternall teares of
sorow, it is not much, that Mary Magdalen should desire to shed
eternall teares of joy.
            
               She fell a weeping. Chrysologus cites to this purpose
that verse of Dauid, Praise yee the Lord yee Waters that be aboue the
Heauens.
               
                  Psal. 14
                     •
                  . Some vnderstand by these waters that are aboue
the Heauens, the Angells; some, the Crystalline Heauen; others,What is meant by waters aboue the heauens. the waters of
the Clouds which are aboue the aire, which the Scripture calleth Heauen: But I
(saith Chrysologus) considering these teares that were poured forth
vpon our Sauiours feet, cannot but confesse, That these are those Waters that
be aboue the Heauens. The Historie of the Kings maketh mention of the
gifts which the Queene of Sheba brought to King Salomon, and that none
in all the world had at any time brought such rich Presents,3. Reg. 10. nor so pretious in their qualitie, nor
so many in their quantitie: The like may be sayd of Marie Magdalens
teares, neuer was there that woman in the world that shed so many, and such
rich and pretious teares, as she, nor that presentedthe like from her eyes, to
the  true Salomon. Zachary sets forth
Dauid for an example of the penitent, Et erit, qui offenderit ex
eis in illa die, sicut Dauid. In the new Law it is said, That sinners
shall rise vp with that zeale and earnest feruour from their sinues, as did
Dauid: But the Prophet had not then the example of Mary
Magdalen; if he had, hee would haue preferd her before him in that deluge
of teares. God treating of clensing the world of it's sins, he rayned down more
&amp; more water; but that was not a sufficient or effectuall remedy: on Sodom
he rayned down more &amp; more fire; but that likewise would doe no good.
Sithence that neither water of it selfe, nor fire of it selfe, wil do the deed,
let a Lee be made of fire and water together, for there is not that spot or
staine, which that will not take out. This Lee, is the teares which come from
the vapours of the braine, and the fire of the heart. Saint Augustine
weighing how mute Mary Magdalen stood, sayes vnto her, Quid
quaeris? Quid dicis Maria? What wouldst thou haue? What doest thou seeke
after? What, nothing but weepe? Why doest thou not speake? She had found too
much sorrow to find a tongue.Deepe sorrow wants a
  tongue. They grieue but little that can expresse their griefe: No
maruell then if she were dumbe-strucken, that was so heart-strucken. The sweet
songs of the Syrens haue been turned into sorrowfull sighes; the pleasing and
delight fullest voyce, being altered by the heat of the blood, hath admitted of
a change, and beene turned into sad howlings and dolefull notes. And as at the
death of some great Captaine, the drums beat harsh and dead, and render a
dolefull sound; and in stead of shrill and cheerefull flourishes, the trumpets
sound hoarse; so now in this our Mary Magdalens death (who was the
chiefe Captaine and Ring-leader of the vices of that Citie) a hollow sound of
sighes was heard, and a grieuous noyse of confused grones and broken throbs,
breathing out these wofull words: ô my good Lord, I haue beene like vnto
the Serpent, for on the one side I sustained my selfe by the earth, without
once offering to lift mine eyes from the earth; on the other side, I did
prostrate my selfe, laying traps and snares for thy feet, soliciting the men of
this City to tread thy Lawes vnder their feet. Oh Lord, since I haue thus playd
the Serpent, tread thou vpon mee, crush me in the head, and bruise out all the
venome that is in me. O sweet Iesus, the Serpent vseth to enter in betweene the
rocks, and rub off her old skinne, and leauing it there behind her, to renew
her selfe againe: I much desire to cast off my old skinne, and to leaue it in
the wounds of these thy feet, and on my strong rocke Christ Iesus. I wot well
ô Lord, that so vile and lewd a woman as I am, is to be made no more
reckoning of, than the durt that is trod vnder foot in the streetes, Mulier
fornicaria, quasi stercus in via conculcabitur. But many times the dung of
the earth doth serue for the rootes of trees and other plants: and because
thou art that Diuine plant, whose branches reach vp as high as heauen, permit
ô Lord, that I though but durt and dung, may lye at thy feet. The
Cananitish woman did shew a great deale of humility, when she tearmed her selfe
a dogge: but Mary Magdalen much more,Why Christ
  should not suffer his Apostles to wash his feet, when he had washed
  theirs. 
               
                  •
               earming her selfe
dung.
            
               And she wiped his feet with the haires of her head. S.
Ambrose asketh the question, Why some of his Apostles did not wash our
Sauiours feet, either before or after that he had washt all theirs? He renders
two reasons:
            The one, for that Mary Magdalen had washt them, and hee
would not that this lustre which those her tears had giuen them, should be lost
by washing them with ordinarie and common water. And the comparison is good,
For he that is washed with the water of Angels, will refuse to be washed with
any other water.
            The other (saith Saint Ambrose) for that we should wash
those his diuine feet, with the teares of our eyes. That mysticall lauing of
the Apostles feet, which  was directed to the cleansing
of their soules, could not fit with our Sauiour Christ, who was free from the
least filth of sinne: If any Lauatorie likes him, it is that of our teares,
because in them the heart is softned Besides, Those eyes and hayres which were
so well imployed, did expresse her good desire and thoughts. And there is not
any Sacrifice so acceptable vnto God, as to see the desires and thoughts of our
hearts to be offered vp at his feet. Chrysologus saith, That after God
had seene the resolution and courage of Abraham in the sacrificing of
his sonne, he cared not a rush for all the rest; and therefore cryed vnto him,
Lay not thine hand vpon the child, neyther doe any thing vnto
him;
               
                  Gen. 22. 
               for now I know thou
fearest God, &amp;c. For I take no pleasure in the death of the Innocent,
nor in the shedding of blood, my delight is, to see thy will submit it selfe at
my feet,
                  Cont. 9.4. 
               My sister, my spouse,
thou hast wounded mine heart: Thou hast wounded my heart with one of thine
eyes, and with a hayre of thy necke. Following the selfe-same Metaphor, to
wit, That the hayres are the thoughts, and the eyes, the desires. As if her
beloued should haue said vnto her, One desire, one thought my spouse, one
resolute determination, one firme purpose, hath quite robd me of my heart. And
he that shall indeere the delight that he takes in one single hayre, will take
much more pleasure in that whole skayne of gold. Bonauenture sayes,
That shee did behold our Sauiour by stealth, and peeping through the lattice of
her hayres, did euer and anon snatch a sight of him; But after that she had
once inioyed the brightnes of his face, and the sweetnes of his eyes, whence he
shot forth such sweet shafts of loue, and that did light so right vpon her,
that her heart was taken therewith; It seeming vnto her, That the skie was now
cleere, and the weather very faire and prosperous, she did vnruffle the sides
of her haires, and spred them abroad to the wind, finding so good a gale. And
as he that hath escaped many dangerous fits of death at sea, is neuer
satisfied with kissing the earth when hee comes ashoare: so Mary
Magdalen thought shee could neuer haue her fill of kissing the blessed
earth, of those her Sauiours most holy feet. And as the Traueller that hath
passed through the deserts of Arabia, his mouth being as dry as those sandie
grounds, or as tinder that is ready to take fire, being driuen to drinke of
foule and vnsauourie puddles, no sooner comes to a cleere fountaine, but hee
rushes hastily to the water, and neuer makes an end of drinking; so did it fare
with Mary Magdalen, &amp;c.
            
            
               With her hayres. Absalons hayre was Absalons
halter;The Haire hurtfull vnto many.
               Sampsons lockes serued as bands to bind him fast; the Philistims by
those hayres haling him to prison. My hayres haue been no lesse cruell to me,
than theirs were to them. God, he is said to haue a head of gold, but hayres as
blacke as the Rauen. But I, being a Rauen in my soule for blacknesse, had my
hayres of gold, &amp;c.
            
               And annoynted them with oyntment. Saint Gregorie
saith,Maries entertainement of our Sauiour, expressed in
  two things. That Mary Magdalen entertained our Sauiour Christ
at this feast, with two great regalos, or dainties.
            The one, That it was she that made him the feast. For albeit the
Pharisee had inuited him, he had not set before him one sauourie morsell: For
what could sauour well in the house of a proud scorner that is giuen to mocke
and scoffe? And howbeit for the body, the cheere was good enough, yet if it had
not beene for Mary Magdalen, the soule might haue fasted. But she did
supply that defect, by affording matter to our Sauiour, to taxe the Pharisee of
discourtesie, &amp;c. Seest thou this woman? I entred into thy house, and
thou gauest me no water to my feete: but she hath washed my feet with teares.
Thou gauest me no kisse: But shee since the time that I came in, hath not
ceased to kisse my feet. Mine head with oyle thou didst not annoynt, 
 but she hath annoynted my feet with oyntment,
&amp;c.
            The other, That at the feet of our Sauiour she made a generall
sacrifice of all those things, wherewith she had before offended him; as of her
eyes, mouth, hayres, hands, heart, and soule, not leauing out so much as that
her oyntment, which is that which women are loathest to leaue, and doe latest
and hardliest part withall. Saint Bernard saith▪ That Mary
Magdalen did climbe vp to heauen by the same rounds, by which she went
downe to hell. Wee make a rope of our vices, and a ladder of our sinnes, by
which we descend to hell. In some, their eyes are the instruments of their
destruction, in others their hayres, in others their dainties and delicacies
in; Mary Magdalen, all whatsoeuer she possessed: Shee was the net that
swept all the vices vnto her; and all those good blessings which God had
bestowed vpon her, she had made them weapons wherewith to offend him. And as
the souldier that yeelds himselfe, holding his weapon by the point, offers it
to the Conqueror; so did Mary Magdalen, ô Lord (said she) with
these weapons haue I offended thee, but now I here lay them downe at thy
feet.
            
               If this man were a Prophet, he would surely haue known who,
&amp;c. God doth so kindly and so louingly entertaine all those that are
penitent sinners, that it would make a man thinke that he had not knowne them.
He that hath kild thy brother, if thou know him not, thou welcommest him to thy
house, and settest him at thy table: behold heere the immensiue Loue of God,
for that which thou doest out of meere ignorance, God doth here doe it out of
cleere knowledge. If thou shalt bewayle thy sinnes and offences, thou shalt
finde God after that manner, as if either he had not knowne thy faults at all,
or if hee did know them, that hee had quite forgot them. In a word, here the
boord of a sinner is made the chaire of holinesse, and of vertue.
            
               If this man were a Prophet. Your Hypocrites which desire
no more but the bare name of Prophets,The nature of a
  Prophet should be rather sweet than sharp
                     •
                  
                  ▪
                and to be onely esteemed for such, are
commonly seuere and sharpe: but those which professe to be so indeed, will
rather offend through mildnesse and softnesse, than roughnesse and austeritie.
Saint Chrisostome sayth, Melius est Deo, de misericordia rationem
reddere, quam de austeritate. It better agrees with God to render an
account of his mercy, than of his seueritie. If God bee naturally kind, Why
should a Prophet be cruell? One of the reasons, Why the day of iudgement ought
to be desired, is, That wee may see the faces of those who being very well
satisfied of their owne sanctitie, are out of a loathing of other folkes
sinnes, ready forsooth to turne vp the stomacke. Your Vultures are all femalls,
(according to the opinion of your Naturalists) and conceiuing by the Aire, they
are the stampe and Embleme of your Murmurers, which teare and rend the flesh
aliue, as your Vultures doe dead carcasses: and if thou wouldest know whereupon
they ground this, thou shalt find it is in the ayre.
            
               True zeale neuer disheartneth, but
  encourageth the weake.
               If he but knew who, and what manner of woman
this were which toucheth him. The iudgements that are most preiudiciall to
a Common-wealth, and most contrarie to Gods nature and condition, are the
discrediting and disgracing of present vertues, with the reprochfull
remembrance of forepassed vices: some doe this out of zeale forsooth; but true
zeale neuer disheartneth or discourageth those that are weake. How can that be
zeale which persuades it selfe, Que el sap
                     •
                  , siempre es sapo, That once a toad and euer a toad. This kind
of zeale I should hardly giue credit vnto, though it should descend downe from
heauen; especially when I consider with my selfe,God in a
  moment can make of a sinner a Saint. 
               Que del sapo, puede hazer
dios Perdiz, That God of a toad can make a Partridge. What saith
Ieremy? Orietur sicut mane Iustitia, Consider the thicke duskinesse of
darknesse, and then againe the glorious brightnesse of the light, being 
 on the one side such neere neighbours, and trenching one
vpon the other; on the other so contrary, and so farre asunder, that there is
nothing more differing, than light from darknesse, nothing in that extreame
distance. A bird passes in an instant ouer fields, mountaines, valleys, riuers,
and seas, and flyes from extreame to extreame, Quis mihi dabit pennas
sicut columbae, &amp;c. Who will giue mee the wings of a Doue? What wonder
is it then that God should passe from the foulenesse of sinne, to the
fairenesse of grace. The hardest thing in the world, is to vnteach a man that
which he hath learned: and therefore the Philosopher did demand a double
Salarie for teaching those schollers that had beene read too before by some
other Philosopher. But this shewes the force and power of Gods Spirit, for that
which humane industrie cannot end in many dayes, grace will end in an instant.
Your aqua fortis will eat out any written character, and cleanse those
blots and blurs of inke, which the dashing of the pen or any the like accident
hath occasioned, but you shall neuer be able to write any letter well againe in
the said paper. But your eye-water, that of teares, is far more forcible and
strong than your aqua fortis, for it doth not onely cleanse the soule
of it's former blots and blurs, but there may be written therein anew very
faire letters,The efficacie of penitentiall teares.
and handsome Characters. Aristotle saith, That your Plants are watered
with the water of the earth, and with the water of heauen; but affirmeth with
all, That that of heauen worketh the more wonderfull effects:2. Reg. 19. So likewise are there teares of the
earth, and teares of heauen; but these worke heauenly effects. The Historie of
Elias in that contention and opposition which he had with the false
Prophets, 
                  •
               alls out very pat for
this purpose: Hee powred water on the Sacrifice, and fild the trenches full
therewith, fire descended downe from heauen, and lickt vp the water, till
there was not one drop left. The comparison is not much amisse of him, Who
after that he had fed vpon many dishes, fals roundly to that which was serued
in last, because he findes it more sauourie and pleasing to his palat, than
any of the former. As this fire that came downe from heauen, consumed the
beasts that were sacrificed; with them the wood, the stones, and at last the
very water: so was it with this Sacrifice which Mary Magdalen offered
to our Sauiour Christ;To Christ they are more sauourie than
  wine. He fed vpon all those dainties shee had set before him, her boxe
of Alablaster filled with costly oyntment, her disheuelled hayres, her pretty
mouth, her faire hands, her sweet kisses, her modest lookes, her blushings and
her bashfulnesse; but most of all on her teares, Lambebat, hee did
licke them vp, they were so sweet and sauourie to his taste, and left so
pleasant a rellish behind them.
            
               Iesus answered and said vnto him, Seest thou this woman?
Petrus Chrisologus saith,The reason of the
  demand. That our Sauiour in this his answer shewes vnto vs, that he was
first of all desirous to cure him who had least feeling of his griefe, not
thinking that hee was sicke, because he felt no paine. And that these open and
publike teares of Marie Magdalen, should discouer the secret &amp;
hidden sores of the Pharisee, making the same serue as a medicine for his
maladie, and a meanes to open his eyes, who as yet had them blinded with
selfe-loue. Vides hanc mulierem? Seeest thou this Woman? No,
Simon thou doest not see her; For thou doest imagine her to be a
sinner, whereas indeed she is a Saint, Many sinnes are forgiuen
her.
               Christ euer ready to forgiue sinners. That
the sinnes of Mary Magdalen were many, the reasons before alledged,
the seuen diuels driuen out of her, (deliuered by Saint Marke and
Saint Luke) and the name of Sinneresse in so populous a City, are
sufficient testimonies of this truth. But a stronger proofe thereof are those
words vttered by our Sauior Christ, Many sinnes are forgiuen her.
Wherein we are to consider his franknesse and freenesse 
in forgiuing: Shewing his power and omnipotencie in nothing more, than in
pittying our infirmities, and pardoning our offences. For, that so great a
forgiuer of sinnes should say, Many sinnes are forgiuen thee, doth
argue, that her sinnes were many. And would to God, That those many
deuotos
               ▪ or seruants, that are deuoted to Mary
Magdalen, be not more for those many sinnes which she had before she was
conuerted, than those many deseruings which she afterwards had. For we haue
reason to be iealous of our selues, that we are more affected to sins than
teares, to carelesnesse than repentance. For we daily see in our liues and
conuersations many sinnes like vnto hers, but little or no repentance like
hers. Many comfort themselues with the teares of this holy woman, this blessed
Saint of God; it seeming vnto them, that they haue a kind of confidence in
their brests, that they likewise shall bewaile their sins as she did. It is no
wonder to see them sinne at euery step, but it were a wonder to find them euery
foot weeping. They will follow her in her faults, but not in her amendment; in
her sins, but not in her teares. Nazianzen saith of himselfe,
Diutius viuendo, nihil aliud assequor, quam vt maiorem vitiorum aceruum
colligam, By liuing long, I get no other good, than make the heape of my sinnes
the bigger. The child of God weepes, and it grieues him to the heart that
he cannot amend as he would; and that the longer his life lasteth, the more
sinne he treasureth vp: but the sinner doth treasure vp vengeance for the day
of vengeance, but neuer sheds a teare to wash away his sins, and to quench
those flames of hell, which without them, his soule may eternally suffer. O
Lord graunt vs the grace, that as we haue sinned with Mary Magdalen,
so with her we may returne againe vnto thee; and that hauing t
                  •
               e like repentance, we may find the like
forgiuenesse of our sinnes. Grant this (sweet Iesus) for thy mercies sake,
&amp;c.

                  Then gathered the high Priests and Pharisees a Councel.
               
            
            
               THe high Priests and the Pharisees called a Councell, to sit vpon
the weightiest cause that was euer consulted of vpon earth: wherein foure
things did concurre.
            First of all, A Councell for to deliberate what course were best
to be taken; for amongst many, the truth would be the better debated; and in
graue businesses, it is fit that persons should be called thereunto, that are
men of Authoritie and Learning.
            
               Secondly, therefore the high Priests are
called to this Councell.
            Thirdly, the Pharisees, who sat as Iudges vpon all matters
touching doubts of Faith, and causes of Religion.
            Fourthly and lastly, The cause of this Councell or Consultation;
which was, our Sauiours raising vp of Lazarus. For they saw that this
Myracle had conuerted many, Collegerunt ergo Concilium, They called
therefore a Councell.
            
            Hitherto all goes well, a faire course was taken; but in the end
they mar'd all by plotting mischiefe against our Sauiour Christ. It had beene
better for them to haue receiued him, to haue approoued those prophesies which
were foretold of him, and to haue inlightned the people by instructing them in
this his doctrin: but they met together for no other end, but to eclipse and
darken the sunne, then when the beames thereof did most shine.
            
               Then gathered the high Priests and the Pharisees a
Councell. After that the diuell had tempted our Sauiour, finding him
somewhat sharpe and sower towards him, Saint Luke saith, Reliquit
eum diabolus ad tempus, The diuell gaue him ouer for that bout, and would
haue no more to doe with him for the present: but left him then of purpose,
waiting for a better season and opportunitie, Vsque ad tempus, For a time.
Euthymius askes, for how long? And his answer is, Till that the Priests
and the Pharisees had called a Councell. This was the diuells plot, though they
did not then thinke so when they met in Councell. And yet they were no sooner
sat, but that Sacrilegious decree went foorth from amongst them, To put him to
death.
            Some man perhaps will aske me, How the diuell could hope to get
the greater victorie of our Sauiour Christ by this meanes, working the same
more by the high Priests and the Pharisees, than by himselfe?
            First of all I answer thereunto, One that serues on horsebacke is
imagined to be of greater force and power than he that serues on foot. And as a
certain glosse hath it, which Thomas alleageth, The wicked are the
diuells horses; and being horsed vpon the high Priests and the Pharisees, it is
not much, that hee should presume to take away our Sauiours life. If the high
Priests and the Pharisees had been horsed vpon the diuells backe, the danger
had not beene so great: But when the diuell shall ride vpon high Priests and
Iudges, &amp;c. it is a fearfull thing.
            Secondly, Saint Ambrose saith, That albeit the diuell be
the Author of all mischiefe, yet hath he sent forth many learned and nimble
witted schollers which haue wonderfully aduanced his cause; suting with that of
the Apostle, who calls the wicked, Inuentores malorum, Inuenters of
euill. The diuell was the first Inuenter therof, but afterwards there were
some men that discouered much more malice. Magellanes was the first
that passed the Streights, but afterwards others went so farre beyond him, that
he is cast behind.
            Thirdly, the diuell by himselfe alone, can commonly doe little,
vnlesse wee serue and supply him with materials.Sathan can
  do little without vs. 
               Comestor reports it to be a tradition
amongst the Rabbines, that in the making of the golden Calfe, the diuell
performed two Offices; the one of a Smith, the other of a Mettall-founder: but,
that the Hebrewes furnished him with Materialls, they found the stuffe, for
the women (who commonly are most superstitious, and by consequence fittest to
be the diuells instruments) furnished him with their eare-rings, bracelets,
&amp; iewels of gold. Here now in like maner the diuel did imploy his best
industry and diligence; he was the cause ofthis Consultation, and the plotter
of this Councell: but the high Priests and the Pharisees were they that
ministred the materials, helping him with their voices.
            
               
               They called a Councell. Peace is
the fruit of Grace. The fruits of the Spirit, are Loue,
               
                  Gal. 5. 
               Ioy, and Peace. And for that
sinners liue aloofe off from Loue and Ioy, they must likewise of force liue
farre from Peace. How can a troubled sea enioy a Calme? But the wicked are
a troubled Sea. In a word, There is no peace to the
vngodly.
               
                  Esay 67. But how comes it now
to passe, That they are at that peace and vnitie, that they ioyne together and
gather a Councell against our Sauiour Christ, with so vnanimous a consent, that
there is not a voyce wanting, but run all ioyntly for his death?
            First of all I answer thereunto, That the wicked vsually enioy a
kind of league and alliance, and confederat with a ioynt consent for their owne
priuat profit, and anothers hurt. But they neuer inioy any peace, So saith
Saint Augustine, Eos copulat non amor, sed malitia, It is not loue, but
malice that thus linkes them together. They confederat themselues, not
that they loue, but that they hate that which they ought to loue; wanting not
so much vnderstanding, as will. Philon compares them to Reapers, who
fall a singing but haue no other agreement in their musicke, but that they
disagree alike. He compares them likewise to the colds and heats of a quartane
Ague, which being a perpetuall distemper, yet both iumpe and meete at such an
instant, and such an houre. Viam pacis non cognouerunt (saith
Dauid,) They haue not knowne the way of Peace; But to shed
innocent blood, their feet are very swift. Iob thus painteth forth the
mysticall body of the diuell, The Maiestie of his Scales,
                  Iob 41. is like strong shields, and are sure
sealed; one is so set to another that no wind can come between them: one is so
ioyned to another that they sticke together and cannot be sundred. The wicked
(saith Lyra) are the flesh of this body, and are like shields, and as
armes made in the manner of scales, Se praementibus,
               The wicked haue a league, no loue. 
               One pressing vpon
another: A shield vpon a shield, and a scale vpon a scale, so close knit
and ioyned together, that the ayre cannot get in betweene them, Considering on
the one side their ill neighbourhood, and on the other, their strict league and
amitie. Dauid askes the question, Why doe the Heathen rage, the
Kings of the earth band themselues, and the Princes assemble together against
the Lord, and against his Christ? Is there any man that knowes the cause
of this discording concord, of this accursed combination? That Esau
should rise vp against Iacob, Ismael against Isaac, Cain
against Abel, the brethren against Ioseph, Iezabel against
Naboth, the two old Leachers of Babylon against Susanna; it
is not much to suffer one enimie that persecutes me, hauing many friends to
protect mee. But that the Gentile, the Iew, the King, the Vassall, the Clergie,
and the Laytie, should all cry out against our Sauiour Christ, this requires a
Quare? Why they should doe it? The reason is, because euery one of the
Saints in particular, and all in generall, were persecuted for his sake, and
Christ for his owne, Vnum contra vnum,
               The world
  consisteth of nothing but opposition. is the worlds Motto. God (saith
Salomon) created all things in an opposition, Omnia secundum
litem fiunt (saith Heraclytus.) And that great Orator and Poet
Laureat, Petrarke, telleth vs, Sine lite, atque offensione, nil
genuit natura parens, That Nature, who is the mother of all things, and common
parent of this great vniuerse, brought forth nothing into the world without
strife and contention. This is it that makes the holy man to set himselfe
against the prophane; and the prophane against the holy. And so in the rest.
And because euery one of Gods Saints, though they were seasoned with all the
other vertues, yet were they more particularly pointed at for some one
especiall vertue. And to this purpose is that vsuall song in the Church;
Non est inuentus similis illi, There is none like vnto him. But our
Sauiour Christ was that vniuersall glasse, where in all the vertues were to be
seene in their most perfect and supremest degree. For this cause, the enuie of
Cain wageth  war against those fauours God did
to Abel; the little honestie of Iosephs brethren, and his
masters wife, against his great both honestie and goodnesse; the proud and
harsh nature of Esau against the meeke and sweet disposition of
Iacob: But against our Sauiour Christ, all the wicked in generall haue
combined themselues; Come let vs oppose our selues against the iust,
because he crosseth our actions, and liketh not of that we doe.
            
            
               They called a Councell. There is not any one thing more
precious, or more necessary than a Councell. There is not that man (saith Saint
Chrysostom) be he the wisest man in the world, but in fine is a man,
and hath need of Counsell: only it may be said of God, Who was euer his
Counseller, or was able to aduise him? What saith Saint Augustine? Ego
senex &amp; Episcopus, paratus sum à puero doceri, I, though an old
man, and a Bishop, doe not scorne to learne of a child.
               
                  Exod. 18. 
               Moses did not scorne the
Counsell of his father in Law Iethro, though a Priest of Midian; not
so much regarding his calling, as his Counsell; his person, as the proiect. The
Counsell which Ioseph gaue to Pharaoh, imported him more than
if hee had inricht him with much treasure: For treasure decreaseth through
wast; but Counsell increaseth through vse. Treasure diuided amongst many,
comes in the end to a little; and he oftentimes wants, that supplyes others
wants: But Counsell, the more it is imparted, the more it profiteth,Good
  counsell a pretious Gen

                  me.
  Gal. 2. returning backe againe to the fountaine from whence it
came. The Apostle Saint Paul, after that hee had beene rapt vp to the
third heauen, and hauing beene now some fourteene yeares an Apostle, he saith,
That he went vp to Ierusalem, and communicated with them of the Gospell which
he had preached among the Gentiles: and presently rendreth a reason thereof in
the words following, Least by any meanes I should runne, or had runne in
vaine. No maruaile then, if he that is not such an Eagle as he was, nor
hath beene rapt vp into heauen with him, should be so foolishly wilfull, as not
to aduise with his Counsell, but suffer himselfe to be carryed away with his
owne passion, and proper 
                  •
               pinion.
            Counsell therefore ought to be pure and sincere, free from malice,
passion, and ignorance. Saint Ambrose tells vs by way of demand;Ill counsell produceth ill effects. Who amidst durt and
mudde, will seeke for a cleere fountaine? Who will take water out of a foule
poole? How then can he giue me Counsell that knowes not how to follow it
himselfe? Neuer yet was a blind man fit to be a blind mans guide, Hee that
is a foole walkes in darknesse.
               
                  Eccl. 2.
Throughout the Scripture we doe not finde the Counsell of the wicked to thriue
with them. The Historie of the Macchabees reports vnto vs certaine wicked
persons that resolued to make a league or couenant with the Nations; from
whence sprung the ruine of all Religion. The rash counsell of a company of
young heads, was the losse of tenne parts of Rehoboams kingdome. For
such counsells haue two great enemies (Anger, and Hast.) That Counsell of
Ieroboam for the erecting of two calues, for to detaine those that
went to offer sacrifice at Ierusalem, blotted his house from off the face of
the earth. That of Pharaoh against the children of Israel,
                  Exod. 1.8. 
               Behold the people of the children
of Israel are greater &amp; mightier than we, come let vs work wisely with
them, &amp;c. was the original of their vtter perdition. But no Councell
was comparable in mischiefe to this Councell.
            
               They called a Councell against Iesus. These words,
Against Iesus, are not of the Euangelist, though they be to bee found
in many Missals: and they carrie with them a great Emphasis, Against
Iesus, that is, Against their Sauiour. That of Saint
Ambrose, treating of Christs agonie in the garden, of his mysticall
sweat, and his prayer to his Father, is worthy your consideration, Father
if it be thy will,  let this cup passe from me;
Where he saith, That the
                  •
               e were
there and then represented vnto him the paines and torments which this people
were to suffer for his death, and being desirous that they should not be vndone
by their owne wilfulnesse, he said, Let it passe. So that it was not
the feare of death, that thus wrought with him, but the desire that he had to
diuert his people from so great an ill. Against Iesus: What endeering
can the conceit of man imagine to be greater, than that God should sweat bloud
for their good, that went about to do him all the mischiefe they could.2▪ 
                  Mac. 4. The Booke of Machabees
indeering the malice of one Symon of the Tribe of Beniamin, reporteth,
that he spake much euill of an holy man called Onias; as that he was a
Traitor to the Temple and to the Citie, and that hee held intelligence with
Heliodorus, aduising him to take thence the Orphans and the Widowes
goods, that were there deposited. Howbeit Onias was a Father to his
Countrie, a Protector of the people, a Mediator betwixt God and them, and a
well wisher to the generall good: and yet this wretched Villaine, that was
himselfe a Traitor to his Countrie, called him a betrayer of the Commonwealth.
This was great malice, but nothing to this Counsel here assembled against
Iesus. And as Rupertus hath obserued it, whilest they were treating
of this businesse against Iesus, they kept out all that which might any way
make for Iesus: Neither Law nor Prophet entred into this Councell, the
Counsellors were Anger, Hatred, Couetousnesse, and their own priuat interest.
Marke with whom, and without whom they enter into this Councell.
            
               Against Iesus. No man that desires a good end in his
businesses, would willingly giue them a bad beginning. Doost thou take the
burthen of gouerning a Kingdome vpon thy shoulders?
                  Psal 2. Take this Lesson then along with thee,
Bee wise now therefore yee Kings, be learned yee Iudges of the earth,
&amp;c. Moses nominating Ioshuah to be his successor, gaue him
in charge, That he should euermore haue the Law before his eyes; Sic

                  Exod 17. yet this Idolatrie continued till

                  •
               riue a Counsell, but
God was not in the plot; they spunne a thred, but the Spirit had no finger in
it: &amp; being that it was not called in Gods name, nor by the Spirit of God,
it must of force be done in the Deuils name, and by his suggestion; and 
 all this Aduersus Iesum, Against the best
friend they had.
            
               What shall we do? for this man doth many myracles.
               As the iust hunger and thirst after right, so doe the wicked after
  bloud. The verie first word they spake, discouered their euill intention
towards him: This their What shal we do, is not a consulting with God,
or hauing recourse to the Scripture, where God hath reuealed vnto vs, what
course we are to take in such cases; but a condemning of their dulnesse and
slownesse, that they had not made an end of him no sooner. There are many
sinners, who no longer than they are plotting villany, or committing one sinne
or other, thinke themselues idle fellowes, and loytering companions: as the
Iust, who are alwayes hungring &amp; thirsting after righteousnesse, so the
Wicked thirst after bloud.
                  Sap. 3. In the
time of their vision they shall shine and runne through as the sparkles amongst
the stubble, with that hast and speed as the sparkes leape from one side to
another, in a field where the stubble is verie drie; so doe the Iust hasten and
runne on from vertue to vertue. In like sort there are sinners that are swift
in sinning, and thinke themselues idle when they are not ill occupied. Foure or
fiue deuout persons come from a Sermon, and say one to another as they walke
homeward, Trust mee (my Masters) it is high time that we should begin to amend
our liues, and that so many truths that the Preacher hath deliuered vnto vs,
should bring forth some good fruit in vs. Another as hungrie after sinne, as
these after goodnesse, comes to his fellow, puls him by the cloake, drawes him
out of the Church, &amp; sayes vnto him, What a Deuil makest thou at a sermon?
come let vs goe to such an Ordinarie, there we shall be sure to haue the doore
open, and some good fellowes or other to game withall and spend the time. Your
Curtezans they steale out by couples, saying to each other, What should we do
here? we mispend our time, for my part I shal lose by the bargaine; no longer
sinne, no longer gaine, let vs hie vs home therefore, one customer or other
will come vnto vs. Good is that comparison of the Physition and the
Apothecarie, when a Commonwealth stands sound and in health, and the one saith
to the other, Que se haze compadre? How goes the world Gossip? No nada por
nuestros peccados, Not verie well I assure you, thankes to our sins, which haue
drawne this punishment vpon vs: And the reason of it grows from this, that
no longer than they are ministring of purges and syrrops, they thinke their
time lost. So is it with a sinner that hungers after sin; there are some men
which euerie night get them to bed without any more adoo, laden with mortall
sins by the dozens, and yet think themselues to be Saints: But being thus
heauily laden, darest thou presume to lay thee down to sleep? take heed lest
they presse thee too hard, &amp; that thou accompaniest thy sleep with death. O
good ghostly father (say these men) I know not what this heauinesse of sins
meane, that you talk of, I find no such matter, I thanke God I sleepe soundly,
I am not troubled with dreames, but take my rest as quietly as any man in the
world. Say you so my masters, you shal giue me leaue not to beleeue you; for
albeit by long custome of sinning, you do not feele the weight of this tower,
nor the heigth of this mountain that you beare vpon your backs, notwithstanding
all this, you shall dream (as the Prophet saith) fearefull dreames: and howbeit
wee are not to giue credit to euerie idle dreame, yet may yee take these for
reuelations, and aduertisements and intimations from Heauen.
                  Ieremie.
                And if thou wilt see and behold whether
the sinnes of thy life weigh heauie or no, take out thy heart and lay it on thy
shoulders, and then thou shalt see whether the weight of thy sinnes bee heauie
or no. Hee alludeth to an ordinarie rule in phylosophie, That nothing seemeth
heauie in it's owne Element. When a Worme diues into the bottome of the sea,
and lieth there, he feeleth not the weight of innumerable Quintalls of Waters
which  he hath vpon his backe; but if vpon drie land he
hath but a Cuba de agua, as much water as a Hoggs bladder will hold,
it troubles and torments him much. And therefore, ô thou sinner, if thy
sinnes weigh not heauie, it is because thou hast made thy heart their naturall
center: so draw it out of the element of Sinne, into that of Grace, and thou
shalt then perceiue, that thy shoulders will not bee able to beare them, and
that the burthen of them will be too intollerable for thee: Pondus eius
ferre non potui (said Iob) My sinnes were more than I was able to
beare.
            
            
               What shall we doe, &amp;c. Thou workest myracles, assure
thy selfe there will be many that will say with these High-priests and
Pharisees, What shall wee doe? Thou art a noted man for thy vertue and
holynesse of life, thou excellest the rest in the Citie wherein thou liuest,
prouide thy selfe therefore against the combats of Enuie, for thou wilt be
encountred therewith. Scarce hath the souldier entred into the field,
glittering in his golden Armour and his plume of feathers dancing on his
crest, when lo, a thousand bullets fall as thick as haile about his eares. When
Dauid had killed Goliah, and the Damosells of Ierusalem sang,
Saul hath slaine his thousand, and Dauid his ten thousand, Enuie
presently followed him at the heeles. The low shrub or little tender sapling
that hath his dwelling in the vale, shrowding himselfe in some humble bottome,
is not beaten by the winds; but if it grow vp like the Palme or the Cedar, or
be seated on the top of some high hill, it is shaken with euerie blast.

               What shall we doe? for this man, &amp;c. Before, they
sayd he was indaemoniated, a Sorcerer, a bibber of wine, and a friend of
sinners; but now, This man doth manie myracles: before, they were so
harsh and so sowre in their reproofes and reprehensions, that they brake
foorth into wrongs and reproches; but now in a more ciuile kind of deportment,
they say, This man doth many myracles. It is a great comfort to those
Preachers, who out of their zeale to God, plainely and nakedly reprehend the
sinnes and vices of the times; for albeit some of their Auditors doe for the
present speake euill of them, when they shall afterwards call themselues to
account, they will then speake well of them. Some there are that paint Vice
cloathed; others, starke naked; but amongst Painters the latter is held the
more excellent peece.Sharpe reproofes work sweet
  effects. 
               Alexander did laugh at one of Apelles his
Apprentises, for painting Hellen rich in her cloaths, but foule in
her face. Your fierie cauteries make the pained Patient to blaspheme God, &amp;
raile against his surgeon, swearing by no small oaths, That a Turk is not halfe
so cruell and so hard hearted as he is; but when he sees the Cancer stayd by
this cauterising, and that hee now waxeth well and sound, he can then say,
Gran oficial es fulano, Such a one is an excellent Surgeon. It is a
great comfort for vs that are Preachers, when our Hearers soules shal so smart
with our sharp reprehensions, that they shal exclaime and crie out against vs,
That wee deale too roughly with them, and that we lack a Ladies hand in the
searching and dressing of their wounds and sores. But when these men shall be
freed of this their passion, and shall find what good effect our Cauteries haue
wrought vpon their cancer'd consciences, though now they curse and reuile vs,
they will then thanke vs and pray to God to blesse vs.
            
               For this Man doth many myracles. All the words that were
vttered in this Councel were meere fopperies and fooleries;Wickednes is meere folishnesse. and it seems verie strange
&amp; much to be wondred at, that the sin of malice being pecado tan
pensado, so premeditated a sin, that they could not pick any other hole in
our Sauiors coat, or pitch on some  other more foule and
heynous offence, whose circumstances might haue carryed more colour for
Christs death. They did foulely ouershoote themselues herein saith
Osee, It would make a man stand amazed as oft as hee but thinkes with
himselfe, That proceeding in that malicious manner, as they did against him,
they should so much betray their ignorance: But questionlesse, it ariseth from
that of the Philosopher, Omnis peccans est ignorans. Euen in the
sinnes of malice, ignorance hath a great stroke: for a sinner knowes not well
how to leaue, or chuse. Chrysologus saith, That the diuell in tempting
our Sauiour, went foolishly to worke; and that he had forgot the office of a
Tempter. Many Saints stile malice blind: For there is not any sinne that treads
surely, but still goes hood-winkt. The old Iudges in Susanna's
businesse behaued themselues so simply, That a little child tooke them in a
lye, and bewrayed their folly. Iosephs brethren brought the
childlesse coate home to their father without anie hole or rent, dipt in blood,
and told him, A wicked beast hath deuoured him.

did multiplie an innumerarable companie of fooleries; whereof Saint
Augustine conuinceth them. In a word, in the Sacred Scripture, the
sinner in euerie place beares the name of a foole: but not anie one follie can
compare it selfe with this; Let vs kill this man, for he doth manie Miracles.

the Pope saith, That by this labour is vnderstood all that good which God did
for that people, by taking flesh vpon him, by being borne, by liuing, and by
dying. All this was a labour vnto him, and this labour serued the people in
stead of a Shield against God himselfe: For, they did not onely make of his
Miracles and benefits, Shields for to defend themselues from God, but swords,
nayles, whips, and thornes, for to quit God of his life. Saint Paul
did bewayle those Heretickes, which did denie the Crosse of our Sauior Christ,
(being the efficacie of our remedie and redemption) and cals them enemies of
the Crosse. No better doth it fare with those, being they make poyson of
Treacle, and matter of infirmitie the meanes of their saluation. Saint
Chrysostome saith,
                  Philip. 3. That
they are worse than Diuels: for one Diuell doth not persecute another, but
these did persecute their best friend and benefactor. The Diuels held their
peace and did obey, and at the most, They went out crying and saying, Thou
art the Sonne of God. God commanded in Exodus, That they should
not boyle the Kid in the milk of the Dam; and Philon expounding that
place, saith, That he held it a thing vnmeet and vniust, that that should be
the instrument of it's death which had been the beginning of it's life. And it
sutes well with that of Gregorie Nissen, who saith, That the Miracles
which God doth, are mans milke, dealing with him as with a little child.

               The Romans will come, and take away both our place and
nation. Here is another blind consequence; if we let him liue, the Romans
will come and take away our place and nation. Whereas, they might rather haue
inferred this conclusion; The Romans will come, and they likewise will beleeue
in him. For it is not much, That he that could conuert a Iew, should conuert a
Roman; considering that the Romans amongstall their gods had not one that could
worke a Miracle to win them. But suppose that the Romans should not haue
beleeued, and should haue treated to destroy them; he that raysed vp the dead,
was not he of power to resist the power of the Romans? One Iudith
triumphed ouer Nebuchadnezzar. One Elisha blinded those of
Syria, and led them into Samaria. One Elias consumed with fire,
Ahabs Quinquagenarian Captaines, and their souldiers. And none of all
these had the like power to that of our Sauiour Christ.
            Besides these vaine discourses, they had another no lesse blind
and impious; If we kill him, the Romans will not come. It being rather an
assured truth, that they would come onely vpon this,
                  Dan. 9. as it was foretold by Daniel, The
Messias shall bee slain, and the people of the Prince that shal come, shall
destroy the City and the Sanctuary. Had they not put our Sauiour Christ to
death, Ierusalem had stood and continued, but hauing put him to death, there
shall not be one stone left vpon another. Simeon and

Into their secrets let not my soule come, for in their wrath they slew a man,
and in their selfe-will they digged downe a wall. It was Iacobs
prophesie against his two sonnes, Simeon and Leui, of whom
these Pharisees did descend, as it is noted by Nicholas de Lyra. Let
not my soule enter into their Councell, for in their wrath they kill'd a man,
and digg'd downe a wall. All which was but a signification of their killing of
our Sauiour Christ, and throwing the walls of Ierusalem downe to the ground.
Murus ante murale, Christ was the bulwarke to this wall: So
Esay stiles him. This Councell made their Country desolate, For
Titus and Vespasian had not otherwise beene of power to
destroy it: but the Priests and the Pharisees fearfull of their euill,
destroyed the fountaine of all goodnesse.

suffereth, being placed betwixt two extreames, Susanna, betwixt the
feare of God, and the feare of the Iudges of Babylon; a damsell betwixt
pouertie, and the pursuit of a rich wanton: If I consent, I loose God; if not,

Charibdis; So in this case (say the Pharisees) If we let this man
alone, it is ill with vs; if wee take away his life, worse.
            But he that shall finde himselfe perplexed, suffering out of his
fearfulnesse betwixt two euils, let him not once thinke of thwarting God; for
then, both those euills will fall vpon him; as it is well obserued by Saint
Augustine, Saint Gregorie, and Saint Basil. So
stood the case now with these men, eyther they did beleeue that Christ was the
Messias, or they did not beleeue it; if beleeue it, it was a notorious
wickednesse in them, to preferre a Temporall kingdome before the open
profession of their faith. And if they did not beleeue it, they had no cause
giuen them to feare any temporall harme from the Romans, but the Spirituall
dammage of Religion. The Prince that sayes, Cut off this Heresie for the
conseruation of my Crowne, doth not make any great reckoning of his faith.
What saith Saint Augustine? Quia temporale regnum spirituali praetulerunt,
vtrumque amiserunt, Because they preferred a temporall kingdome before a
spirituall, they lost both. Experience teacheth vs, That Faith and
Religion conserue Kingdomes. Which Saint Chrysostome prooueth vnto vs

            And here we may take vp a iust complaint against your counterfeit
Christians, your dissembling Polititians, and their damnable Positions, who
loosing in part the name of Christians and of Catholikes, beare themselues high
vpon the name of Polititians and Statesmen, liuing wondrous well contented
therewith; who are a kind of cattle, that doe so highly prize their Courtly
carriage, their curteous behauiour and faire demeanor, that they seeke to
reduce the cause of Religion, and Faith, to ciuilitie and curtesie; iudging
all the rest meere rusticitie and clownishnesse: alledging in their defence,
That many things must yeeld and giue way to the times; as also to dissemble
with the times. And that for the publike peace, which ought aboue all things
to be esteemed, they affirme, That war ought not to bee waged for matter of
difference in Religion, as well because it cannot be rooted out ofmens brests;
as also, because the obligation of Religion is not so precise a thing, that we
should for the same aduenture and hazard eyther our goods, our persons, or the
peace of a State. They say, That that which doth most of all concerne a
Statesman, is aboue all things to haue an eye to the good of his Country, and
the profit and benefit of the people therein; but by no meanes to enter into a
Warre, nor to draw too much enuie vpon them for cause of Religion, leauing that
care to Clergie-men, or to Preachers, or to God himselfe, Who, if the Church
shall receiue any iniurie by the new broached opinions, is able of himselfe to
reuenge his owne qua
                  •
               rell. In a
word, There is not that meere Polititian or Statesman, that is not desirous to
sleepe in a whole skin, and to looke well enough to himselfe for one, without
thrusting himselfe into quarrels and contentions for points of Religion. Whence
it comes to passe, that they forsake the Patrocinium and protection of
the Church, and vpon foule termes put the Catholike faith into their enemies
fingers.
            He that doth not preferre the cause of Religion before all things
else whatsoeuer, doth not deserue the name of a Christian; for Faith, Diuine
Worship, and Religion, difference a Christian from a Gentile: Hee then that
shall sleight the same, and make light account of it, how shall he enioy this
name? If vnto great sinners, our Sauiour saith, Nescio vos, I know yee
not; though they confesse and esteeme of faith, What will he say vnto
Polititians and Statesmen? The generall  voice of this
Sect, is, Let vs first regard our temporall meanes, be it priuat or publike;
for religion and truth, so no hurt thereby come vnto vs, let it shift for it
selfe, what is it to vs what hazzard it runnes? Summa peruersio (saith
Saint Augustine) frui vtendis, &amp; vti fruendis. Your
Polititians set vp their rest and delight in enioying temporall goods, and in
making vse of spirituall goods. Pilat was a Polititian, for the Iewes
alledging vnto him, If thou let this man loose, thou art not Caesars
friend; he condemned our Sauiour Christ to death, preferring
Caesars friendship before Christs life. Ieroboam was a
Polititian, who made two cal

those his bookes de Ciuit. Dei, alledging, That they had many bad
yeares, misfortunes, and disasters for professing the Law of Christ. Those were
Polititians, That k

would not confesse him openly before men, Least they should be thrust out
of the Synagogue. Ioseph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus, were
Polititians, for that they sought after our Sauiour Christ by night, for feare
of the Iewes. Polititians are those, of whom Ieremias said, Since

beginning from Cain: God had reuealed vnto father Adam the
comming of Christ; Adam vnto his sonnes; and Cain supposing
that he should lineally descend from Abel, and that hee should be
thrust out and disgraced, resolued to remooue that blocke that stood in his
way, preferring the temporall good of the bodie, before the spirituall good of
the soule.
            
               The Romans will come. The harme was not hatched in Rome,
but in the enuie of your brests;Priuat interest must giue
  way to the generall good. the generall losse did not so neerely touch
you, as your own priuat interest. There are some Gouernors in a Commonwealth,
which applie themselues wholly to their priuat profit. King Don Alonso
of Arragon was woont to say, That if he had beene Emperour when Rome
flourished, he would haue built a Temple before the Capitoll, where the
Senators should haue layd downe their owne particular benefit. A conceit
worthie such a King, who knew verie well, what Interest will worke in a
Gouernor. Moses did desire to see Gods face,
                  Exod. 33. 
               Shew me thy face: But Gods
answer to him was, Thou canst not see my face, for there shall no man see
me and liue. The Prophet hereupon strooke saile, and let his desire fall.
What Moses, art thou now turned coward? What had it been to thee to
haue lost thy life, for to behold God face to face? We find afterwards, that
desiring pardon for his People, he said vnto God, O Lord pardon this People,
though thou blot my name out of the booke of Life. Wouldest thou not forgoe
thy life to see Gods face, and wilt thou part with this and that other life for
thy people? That was a particular good, this a common; and a Gouernor ought
mainly and especially to haue an eye vnto that. Those Cowes which carried the
Arke to Bethshemish, neuer turned their heads at the lowing of their Calfes,
because being guided &amp; led along with the loue &amp; zeale of the common

                  eed of them: And for
Nicodemus and Gamaliel, it is verie probable, that they had no finger
in the businesse: but as it is in the prouerbe, The head draweth the rest
of the bodie after it, as the Primum mobile doth the rest of the
Heauens; and therefore he sayd, Yee know nothing: for that when in a
Commonwealth a Citisen differs in his opinion from a companie of impudent and
wicked persons, and liues therein with God and a good conscience, presently
they say, Que sabe poco, That he is a man of no vnderstanding, and
knoweth not what hee speakes. The reason that Caiphas renders is this,
It is expedient for vs, that one man die for the people, rather than that
the whole Nation should perish. At that verie instant when the High-Priest
was to pronounce this decree, the Holy-Ghost and the Deuil mooued him therunto
both at once; the one directed his heart, the other his tongue: but in
Caiphas his purpose and intention, it was the wickedest Decree, and
the most sacrilegious determination that was euer deliuered in the World. God
could not bee well pleased with Caiphas for desiring the death of the
Innocent; nor yet displeased with his death, for that it was decreed in the
sacred Councel of the blessed Trinitie, That one should die for the sinnes of
the people. But in God and Caiphas the ends were diuerse; this out of
malice to our Sauiour; that out of loue to Mankind. Nor is it inconuenient,
that one and the selfesame proposition should haue a different sence and
meaning. Destroy this Temple, and I will build it vp againe in three
dayes: The Pharisees vnderstood this of the materiall Temple, but our
Sauiour Christ, of the Temple of his bodie. That which thou doost, due
quickely: Our Sauiour Christ spake this of Iudas his treating to
sell him, but his Disciples vnderstood him as concerning the preparation of the
Passeouer. And so in this place, It is fit that this man should die,
(saith Caiphas) that we may not become captiues to Rome: and
Heauen saith, It is fit that hee should die, because the whole World should not
perish. The persecution and death of a Martyr turnes to the Martyrs good, but
to the Tyrants hurt.

the death of Christ, for our good; but the world could not light on a worse

               Origen hath obserued, That Caiphas prophesied,
but that he was no Prophet.
            First, Because one action of a Prophet doth not make the habit or
denomination of a Prophet.
            Secondly, because he did not attaine vnto the sence and meaning of
the Holy-Ghost, the knowledge whereof in point of prophesie is necessarie.
            S. Ambrose saith, That Caiphas pretended one
thing, &amp; vttered another, &amp; therefore that he sin'd in the sentence
which he pronounced, because hisintent was bad &amp; vniust; as it was with
Balaam, who as he was a Prophet could not curse the people of
Israell, but as they were particular persons, they did sinne and erre: so that
the Holy-Ghost seruing himselfe with the tongue of Caiphas, as the
instrument, the High-Priest did but determine that which the Holy-Ghost had
before decreed.
            
               The same words out of diuers mouths may be
  diuersly relished. Rom. 8.Whence we may take occasion to weigh
and consider the good and the ill of an intention, since that one and the selfe
same words are so good and so ill. Saint Augustine pondereth vpon
those words of Saint Paul, Qui filio proprio suo non pepercit, sed pro
nobis omnibus tradidit illum, Who spared not his owne sonne, but gaue him for
vs all to death. This word Tradidit, is verified both of the
Father, and of the Sonne, Tradidit semetipsum pro me, He deliuered vp
himselfe for me. As also of Iudas, Qui autem tradidit cum, dedit
&amp; signum, He gaue them a signe that was to betray him. And of
Pilat, Tradidit voluntati eorum, He deliuered him vp to their will.
The deliuering of him vp, was all one and the same: but the Father and the
Sonne did this out of their mercy and loue to the world; but Iudas and
Pilat, out of hatred, treason,
                  Mat.
  26. and iniustice. Saint Ambrose saith, That that murmuring
about the oyntment [Vt quid perditio ista vnguenti facta est? What needed
this waste?] was vttered by Iudas, and the Disciples, in one and
the same words: But in them they proceeded out of a good mind; but in
Iudas, out of auarice: for the Disciples had therein a respect to the
poore; For this oyntment (muttered they) might haue beene sold for much, and
beene giuen to the poore. But Iudas out of the profit that he might
haue made thereby vnto himselfe, by filching some of it away, if he had come to
the fingring of it. Saint Hilary expounding that saying of our Sauiour
Christ, Pater maior me est, My Father is greater than I, saith, That
it being heard from Arrius his mouth,
                  Act.
  19. it sauoured like gall; but from our Sauiours mouth, like hony. In
Corinth, certaine Exorcists, sonnes of the Prince of the Priests, would take
vpon them to cast out an euill spirit, Pessimum, the Text stiles him.
Who did demand of them, Who gaue you licence to execute this Office? Vos
autem qui estis? What are ye? Iesus I acknowledge, and Paul I
know, but who are ye? And the man in whom the euill spirit was, ranne on them,
and preuailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and
wounded. Saint Paul did cast out diuels in the name of the Lord Iesus
Christ, and these men likewise did vse the name of the Lord Iesus Christ: How
comes it then to passe, that the successe was so contrary? I answer, The
intention was different. Their words were the same, but not their intent.
            
               It is expedient for vs that one man dye. The naturall
consideration of this place, is the conueniencie of Christs death: It was
expedient for heauen, earth, angels, men, as wel the liuing as the dead.
Wherof I haue treated at large elswhere.
            
               This spake he not of himselfe. Saint Augustine, Hoc
in eo egit propheticum Chrisma, &amp;c. The gift of prophesie, made him to
prophesie his owne euill life, and that hee did prophesie ignorantly and
foolishly. Saint Chrysostome, Vide, quanta si
                     •
                   &amp;c. The grace of prophesie, toucht the high Priests
mouth, but not his heart. Whence Saint Chrysostome 
                doth inferre, how impertinently the Heretikes doe
impugne the liues of the Priests, with an intent and purpose to ouerthrow the
force and power of Ecclesiasticall dignities, and their sacred command and
authoritie. Moses his doubting, did not hinder the gushing of the
water out of the rocke; nor the malice of Caiphas, Gods good purpose.
Of Treacle, the Physitians say, That it hath a little touch of poyson in it,
and it being it's naturall condition and propertie to flye to the heart, though
it be hurtfull one way, yet it carryes it's remedy with it. So in like maner,
the holy Ghost made vse of Caiphas his tongue, as the instrument of
letting forth that diuine blood, whose shedding was our saluation. Of a leaud
wicked fellow Plutarch reporteth, That he vttered a very graue
sentence, and that Lacedamonia gaue order, that it should be ascribed
to another, Answering to our à semetipso non dixit. This was
not a bird of his hatching. Iob seemeth to bee somewhat mooued and
offended, That God should ayde the wicked in their distresse, Thinkest
thou it good to oppresse me, and to cast off the labour of thine
hands,
               
                  Iob 10. 
               and to fauour the
Councell of the wicked? But the diuine prouidence is wont to make vse of
the Councels of Tyrants, and such as are enemies thereunto, but does neuer
assist and helpe them forward. Saint Paul telleth vs, That some did
preach our Sauiour Christ through enuie, others for opposition sake, and by way
of contention; and saith withall, In hoc gaudeo, &amp; gaudebo, In this I
doe and shall reioyce. And Christs Disciples aduising him, that some did
cast forth diuells in his name, made them this answer, Nolite prohibere,
Forbid them not, For the indignitie and vnworthinesse in the person of the
Minister, doth not destroy the grace of his function and dignitie.
            
               This spake he not of himselfe. From so bad a man could
not come so deepe a Mysterie, onely God could put this so rare a conceit into
his head, as the deliuering vp of a Sonne, for the redeeming of a Slaue.
            
               Iesus therefore walked no more openly among the Iewes.
Seeing death now neere at hand, he withdrew himselfe; reading a Lecture therein
vnto vs, That when we are about to die, and drawing on to our last home, we
should abandon the world, and retyre our selues, Remitte mihi (saith
Dauid) vt refrigerer priusquam abeam, &amp; amplius non ero,
Giue me leaue (ô Lord) to dispose of my selfe, and to render thee an
account of my life, before I goe hence and be seen no more. For to propound
your cause before a Iudge, you prepare and addresse your selfe vnto him before
hand; and shall you be negligent and carelesse when you are to appeare before
God? Amongst the Iudges of the earth you haue a Vista and a
Reuista,
               Preparation against death
  necessarie. Hearing vpon hearing: a primera, &amp; segunda
instancia; a first and a second instance. But with God you cannot enioy
the like benefit, his Court allowes no such course. The Motto that is written
there ouer his Tribunall, is, an Amplius non ero, I shall bee no more.
We may not die twice, for to amend in our second death, the errors of our
former life. There is no reuersing of iudgement, no appealing from this Iudge
to that, or from one Court to another. That which wil concerne and import thee
most, is, That thou condemne thy selfe, before God condemne thee; and that thou
kill sinne in thee, before God kill thee in thy sin. This is the onely way to
secure danger, and to kill death. Many sit vp so long at play, that at last
they are faine to goe to bed darkling. This our liuing in the world, is a kind
of playing or gaming, whose bed is Aeternitie: Walke while ye haue light,

               He went thence into a country neere vnto the wildernesse,
&amp;c. If it goe ill with  thee, and that thou
canst not liue well and quietly amongst some men, flye from the societie of
them. Our Sauiour Christ hyes him to the wildernes amongst the beasts, and
carries his Disciples thither with him, holding their fellowship to be lesse
hurtfull and dangerous,
                  Iob 30. 
               Frater
fui Draconum, saith Iob, I am a brother to the Dragons, and a
companion to the Ostriches. Inter Scorpiones habitaui (saith
Ezechiel) I dwelt among Scorpions. Albeit by their habit and
shape they seeme to be men, they are indeed no better than Dragons and
Scorpions: and therefore of the two, it is the lesser euill to liue amongst
these known wild beasts, than such beastly minded men. Your Wolfes that are
clad in sheepes cloathing, our Sauiour markes out to be the vtmost of euill. S.
Ambrose treating of the sorrow which the stones shewed at our Sauiours
death, and that they were so sensible thereof that they did split in sunder,
saith, That our Sauiour found more pitty in those stones, than in his peoples
brests.
            Whence by the way it is to be noted, That when those that gouerne
and sit at the helme are generally naught and wicked, it is needfull then for
vs to flye vnto the wildernesse: for it is better to liue with Dragons and
Scorpions than with them. When there is an earthquake in the Citie, all hast
out of it and get them into the fields. All the foundations of the earth
shall be shaken; What doe ye stay for then, Why do ye stand looking and
gazing one on another as if you had nothing to doe, when destruction is so
neere at hand? In a word, Daniel is cast into the Lyons Den, and the
same is sealed with the Kings owne Signet, not for any hurt that he had done
the Lyons, nor for any harme that hee had done his companions and
play-fellowes, but throwne in thither by the malice of the Princes of the
people, and the Iudges of the land. O Lord deliuer vs from the oppression of
powerfull Princes, and the vnconscionable dealing of corrupt Iudges.
            That there should be but one bad Gouernour, or but one bad Iudge,
it is ill: because such a one is the fountaine whereof all doe drinke. Si
autem nequam fuerit totum corpus tuum, tenebrosum erit: But that there
should be two such bad members in a Common-wealth, is a great deale worse. Of
those two naughty Iudges that wronged Susanna, God said, Et
egressa est iniquitas à Babylone: Your briberies, your thefts, and
your adulteries tooke life from them, in whom they should haue dyed. But when
the whole Bench of Iudges shall be bad, get thee gone into the desart, flye to
the wildernes: for it is too great a boldnes then, not to be as others are. He
that hath a mangie hand, couers it with a cloth, binds it vp close, and
dissembles the matter as much as he can; but if he see other men in the same
case as himselfe is in, he looseth all shame. The first day that a man enters
into the Pallace, or some place of gouernment, &amp;c. He saith, Dominus

                  THe High Priests consulted, that they might put Lazarus to
death also. This Gospell containeth diuerse and sundry mysteries: but the
first and chiefest is, a resolution taken by the Priests to put
Lazarus to death. As if God could not raise him from a violent death,
who had raised him from a naturall death. They thought with themselues, that
Lazarus holding his life by miracle, it would be an addition of credit
and reputation to our Sauiour. And, as to take away his life, they had no
other reason but his many Miracles, so did they likewise seeke to cut off
Lazarus, thinking it very vnfit, that he should be a witnesse to make
good the greatest Miracle that euer our Saiuour wrought, and that by his life
and words, he should notifie Christs Diuinitie to the Iewes and Gentiles that
came to visit him.
            
               The High Priests consulted.
               God the
  onely Lord of all. That the Diuell hath the disposing of the
gouernments and dignities of the world, is a notorious lye; though when he
tempteth any, he would seeme to make it haue some appearance of truth. Hee said
vnto our Sauiour Christ, All this will I giue thee, Representing vnto
him a briefe Cosmographie of all the whole world; Insinuating, That hee was
Lord of all, and had the bestowing of all. The like speech he vsed, when being
askt of God, from whence he came, he answered, I am come from compassing
the earth, I haue rounded my Heritage. And doubtlesse, Hee that shall
narrowly looke into those who command and rule the greater part of the world,
will (I feare me) beleeue, that the diuell did put the same into their hands:
but the truth is, That God is the sole Lord of all. S. Iohn stiles him
in his Apocalyps, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and paints him
foorth with many Crownes vpon his head, And on his head were many
Crownes,
               
                  Apoc. 19. in token that hee
hath the donation of Scepters and Crownes. Artaxerxes stiled himselfe
the great King, and had appertaining to his Empire 127 Prouinces.
Nebuchadnezzar was a mighty Prince: but these and all that euer were,
or shall be, are but Pigmies to God, It is God that giues and takes away
Kingdomes. Per me Reges regnant, By me Kings raigne. And when he diuided
it amongst the sonnes of Adam, he did limit them their bounds, beyond 
 which they were not to passe. When the most high God
deuided to the nations their inheritance,
               
                  Deut.
  32. 
               when he separated the sonnes of Adam, he appointed the borders
of the people, according to the number of the children of Israel. The
Statue of Nebuchadnezzar, which signified the Empires of the earth,
was but a Statue in a dreame, and so vanished like a dreame. The Kings and
Emperors of the earth, some dye, others are borne, are heere to day and gone to
morrow, Hodie est rex, &amp; cras morietur. But Gods Empire endureth
for euer. Pliny saith, That the election of Traiane may be a
sufficient argument to prooue, That God setteth vp Kings, not onely among
Christians, but the Gentiles; Suting with that of Homer, Ex Ioue,
Reges.
            
            This truth being supposed, some man may aske me, How comes it then
to passe, that God places in that Citie where his name is called vpon, where he
hath his house and his Altar, these high Priests, who after they had decreed
the death of Christ, did treat of killing Lazarus?
            
            Which difficultie is the more augmented, because for the most
part, the gouernours of this world are naughtie men; as was to be seene in the
Roman Empire. Thales Milesius, the prime wise man of Greece, being
demanded, what hee had ob
                  •
               erued in
the world to be of most difficultie? Answered, Tyrannum senem, To see
a Tyrant come to be an old man. Irenaeus saith, That God setteth vp
some, because they are worthy to beare rule, others, because they are vnworthy.
But where there is a good Gouernour, that Common-wealth he fauoureth.
Phocas was a most cruell Emperour of Constantinople; whereupon a holy
Monke in a corner of his Cell, thus complaineth vnto God, Cur fecisti eum
Imperatorem? Why didst thou make him Emperour? Who had no sooner made his
mone, but he heard a voyce from heauen, saying, Non inueni peiorem, I could
not finde a worse. In Thebes, there was a great Hypocrite, which was euen
ready to die out of the great desire he had to be a Bishop; who had scarce
obtained that dignitie, but that he fell a spoyling the Common-wealth: but an
Angell told him, That hee was not made Bishop because he deserued to be a
Bishop, but because that Common-wealth deserued not a better Bishop.Ill Rulers sent by God to pun
                     •
                  sh the people. According to that of Iob, Hee causeth
the Hypocrite to reigne for the sinnes of the land. Being all one with
that which Ieremy said of his people, Dabo eos inferuorem
vniuersis regnis terrae propter Manassem, filium Ezechiae. Anastasius
reades it, Per Manassem. For, as a good King is a great cause, why God
with a gracious eye doth looke vpon his people; so a bad king is the meanes
that he vseth for the punishing of them. Saint Gregorie, the
Archbishopricke of Milan being void, wrot to the Clergie, that they would
obliege God by prayer and by fasting, to giue them a good Pastor. For, as God
is pleased with his people, so he giues them Prelats accordingly. The Queen of
Sheba considering the wisedome of Salomon,
               3.
  Reg. 10. said, That nothing did more manifest Gods loue towards
his people of Israel, and the desire of their perpetuitie, than in hauing
giuen them so wise a Gouernour. And Iosephus reporteth, That he being
but twelue yeares of age when he first began to gouerne, the people listening
to that sentence which he gaue at his first sitting in iudgement, touching the
two women that contested about their child, Let the infant be cut in
twaine; Many laughed at it, deeming it to be a childish sentence; but
afterwards wisely weighing the discreet course that hee had taken in
iustifying the truth, without any further proofes or testimonies, they then
cryed out, De coelo elapsus, This King is sent vs downe from heauen.
And albeit the heauens, planets, and starres, are to mans seeming farre off;
yet in regard of those influences which they cause in inferiour bodies, they
are neere at hand. And albeit they are incorruptible, yet doe they affoord
great fauours to corruptible things. If heauen behold vs with a propitious 
 eye, and the planets with prosperous aspects, the earth
doth enioy much fruitfulnesse and abundance. But contrariwise, our soules are
not subiect to those materiall heauens; but to those heauens of our Prelats,
and Gouernours. Behold, I create a new heauen, and a new earth. This
may bee vnderstood of the Ecclesiasticall Estate, and the Secular; of
Superiours and Inferiours. When these heauens affoord a prosperous light, the
earth is beautifull, pleasant, plentifull, and fertile. And so on the contrary,
Ieremie saith, I beheld the earth, and loe it was emptie, I
beheld the heauens, and could see no light in them. What light then could
there bee in Ierusalem, when as Annas and Cayphas were the
high Priests?
            
               The high Priests consulted, that they might put Lazarus to
death. Saint Augustine saith, That this deuise and drift of
theirs was deriued from the diuell, and from hell. There are some thoughts that
are ingendred and bred in our flesh, as the rust in the yron, the rottennes in
the wood, the moth in the cloth, and the worme and mytes in butter and in
cheese. Our flesh is a durtie puddle, which sends forth such foule and thicke
vapors from it, that if you doe not make great hast to expell and driue them
thence, they will quickly cloud and darken the light of the vnderstanding. It
is sicke of the kitchin, the gutter, whitherall the dust and sluttishnesse of
the sences, gathers and meetes together to make such a stinke and stoppage,
that the water of Gods grace can hardly get through, and cleanse the same; it
is a most grieuous and heauie burthen, not onely because it is so painefull and
intollerable, but also because it is ineuitable. All the plagues of Aegypt were
remooued by Moses his prayer, saue onely the flyes: And these are
those our thoughts and cogitations, being inexcusable, as importunate and
troublesome, which are ingendred in this our body of flesh. Euery one beares
about him his particular affection, and the Idol which his heart adoreth; This
man his pleasures, that man his profit; one, his honour, another his grace and
fauour with his king; some, their great and strong Alliance; others, their
daintie and delicious fare. And euerie one of these, is like vnto the beast
that is tyed to his racke and manger, whereon his thoughts doe continually
feede. This is that same, Trahit sua quemque voluptas, Euery man is wedded
to some one kinde of pleasure, or other.
            
            The Schoolemen set downe two sorts of thoughts.
            The one, which flesh and blood produceth.
            The other, which are sowne in vs.
            
               Cogitatio innata, And,
            
               Cogitatio, ab alio lata.
            
            
               That which is bred in vs. And that which is otherwise brought
vnto vs. Some hearbes grow vp in the earth ofthemselues; others are sown:
So some thoughts haue their breeding in mans brest, others are sowne there; and
it must of force follow, that they are sowne eyther by the diuell, or by God.
Of those of the diuell, Saint Paul saith, Let no temptation take
hold on you, but that which is humane. That the verie thought of some
extraordinarie beautie should trouble and disquiet thee, the thought of thy
Princes fauour, of Signiorie, or any other temporall good, this is a humane
temptation; but the killing of Lazarus, and the selling and betraying
of our Sauiour Christ, is a diuellish temptation. And therefore Saint
Iohn saith, That the diuell had put it into Iudas his heart,
that it was hee that had sowne this bad seed there, and thrust this thought
into him. But whether or no, this thought be of the flesh or of the diuell;
sure I am, that it is the generall doctrine of the Saints, That we should not
nourish any euil thought, nor let it like a bottome of yarne, waxe warme in our
hand. Esay complaineth of  his people, That they
conceiued mischiefe, and brought foorth iniquitie; that they hatched cockatrice
egges, and woue the spiders web; that he that eateth of their egges dyeth, and
all that which is trod vpon, breaketh out into a serpent. As out of an Aspick's
egge (saith Aristotle) being kept warme and cherished, is hatcht the
Basiliske; so from our thoughts, taking warmth from the heat of consent, is
bred the Basiliske of sin. This is for the sheepe to breed vp the wolfe, or to
giue sucke to that toad which shall venome thy brest and work thy death. The
Greeke Text saith, Consultauerunt consilio, They did lay their heads
together, they sat in Councell, they did not onely thinke vpon, but consent to
the greatest malice and wickednesse, which euer the diuell or hell could
imagine, Vt Lazarum interficerent, To kill Lazarus. This is the end of
our thoughts, when they are not cut off in time; Sinne is so great an Vsurer,
that it goes dayly gayning more and more ground vpon mans brest, till it hath
brought it to a desperate estate. They were growne to that desperation,
that they said vnto filthinesse, I am thy seruant. Saint Ierome
saith, That as the couetous thirst after money; so doe these after
dishonestie. They are like those that goe downe into a deepe well; they knit
rope to rope, and one sinne to another. Why dyed I not in the birth? Or why
dyed I not when I came out of the wombe? Why did the knees preuent me? And why
did I sucke the brests? Wherein the Prophet painteth foorth vnto vs the
foure estates of a child.
            The first in the wombe.
            The second, when it is borne.
            
               Four estates of a child, and whereunto
  alluding.The third, when it is swadled vp.
            The fourth, when they giue it the teat.
            S. Gregorie doth applie these foure, to the foure estates
of sinne.
            The first, in the thought which conceiues it.
            The second, in the ill which bringeth it forth.
            The third, when we put it on like a garment.
            The fourth, when we nourish and maintaine it.
            Saint Augustine painteth foorth these foure estates, in
these foure dead folkes:
            In the daughter of the Archisinagoguian, who stirred not from
home.
            In the sonne of the widow of Naim. who was accompanied to his
graue.
            In Lazarus, who lay foure dayes dead.
            And in him, whom our Sauiour Christ did not raise vp at al;
saying, Let the dead bury the dead.
            
            
               The Iewes were murderers of all Gods
  Saints.
               They consulted to put Lazarus to death. Our Sauiours
death was already concluded on, and now this cruel people treated of making
away Lazarus. Of whom our Sauiour Christ said, Vt descendat super
vos omnis sanguis iustus à sanguine Abel, ad sanguinem Zachariae,
&amp;c. It is no maruell that they sought to kill Lazarus: for in
him was sum'd vp all the blood of the iust that had beene shed in the world.
And the reason that makes this to seeme so, is, because all the iust that dyed
in the world since Abel, were a Type and figure of Christ: And if they
did die, it was to giue testimonie of his death; and had it not beene for our
Sauiour Christs death, his had not preceedd. And for that the life of the iust
was a shadow of that of our Sauiour Christ; in taking away his life, in whom
all the liues of the world were contained, they were guiltie of all the rest,
and as much as lay in them, were the Homicides of the whole world. And if he
that carryes but one mans death about him, findes no place of safetie vpon
earth, What rest shall he find, that hath so many deaths crying vpon his
conscience?
            
               Saint Chrysostome treating of the
sinne of Cain, saith, That it was greater than that of Adam.
For, besides his loosing in the turning of a hand, the greatest Empire that
euer the world had; we cannot imagine any sinne to be greater than the barring
of all mankind from heauen, the depriuing him of grace, and of the friendship
of God: yet notwithstanding, this seemeth to be the greater, and hee proueth it
by the sentence that was giuen vpon the one sin &amp; the other. God
sentencing Adam, said, Cursed is the earth for thy sake,
&amp;c. The blow of the curse was to fall vpon Adam; and as the
father which makes shew to throw the candlestick at his sons head, but flings
it against the next wall; so God sayes, Cursed is the earth for thy
sake. But with the Serpent, and with Cain, he proceeded
otherwise. To the Serpent he said, Thou art cursed aboue all cattle, and
aboue euery beast of the field, vpon thy belly shalt thou goe, and dust shalt
thou eate all the dayes of thy life. To Cain, Thou art cursed from the
earth, which hath opened her mouth, to receiue thy brothers blood from thine
hand, it shall not henceforth yeeld vnto thee her strength, &amp;c. He did
not forbid him to tread vpon the earth, but he forbad him to enioy the fruits
thereof, &amp;c.
            Secondly, The voyce of thy brothers blood cryeth vnto me from
the earth. Saint Ambrose saith, That he heard the voyce of
Abel; for with God, the dead speake as well as the liuing. The Hebrew
hath it, The voyce of bloods; putting it in the plurall number (as
Lyra hath noted it:) For hee had shed so many bloods as Abel
might haue had children. For, albeit they had neither being nor life in
themselues, yet they might in their cause and beginning: It cryes to mee
from the earth. Not from his body, for though thy brother should haue
forgiuen thee, yet the earth would not pardon thee, to see it selfe violated by
a Traytor. And if God would haue but giuen way thereunto, a thousand mouths
would haue opened to swallow thee vp aliue; but being he would not consent
thereunto, it goes choking those seedes which might haue serued thee for thy
sustenance and delight; and shaking thee off from thence like a banished man,
this Writ is gone out against thee, A vagabond and runnagate shalt thou be
vpon the earth.
            
            Thirdly, All the superiour and inferiour creatures were to be his
persecutors and his tormentors; the heauens with thunder and lightning; the
Angels with fearfull apparitions; the beasts of the woods, and men, shunning
his company; and God himselfe chastising him with a continuall trembling. But
some wil say, How could God persecute him, since he published a Proclamation,
That whosoeuer should kill Cain, should be punished seuen-fold,
Sextuplum punietur: The Seuentie Interpreters render it, Septem
vindictas exoluet, Seuen seuerall reuenges shall bee taken of him.
Procopius answers hereunto, That this Proclamation was made against
Cain; For, a man cursed by God, persecuted by heauen, by earth, by
Angells, by men, by beasts, and by himselfe, would haue held it a happinesse to
dye; but God would not that he should inioy so great a blessing: But that he
should liue seuen generations, and that in euery one of them, God would take
seuere vengeance of him, Septem vindictas exoluet; till that
Lamech should come, who gaue him a sodaine and violent death. And this
is a notable place against all kind of murderers, and man slayers.
Dauid would not drinke of the water, though he were thirsty, which his
souldiers brought him, because it had cost them the hazard of their liues; and
therfore offered it vp in sacrifice to God. They did poure forth innocent
blood like water in the siege of Ierusalem. Dauid did shed the water,
because it seemed to him to be blood; and others shed blood as if it were but
water: some take blood for water, and others, water for blood.
            
               
               Cogitauerunt, vt Lazarum interficerent.
               
                  
                     Esay 59.
                  They consulted to
  put Lazarus to death. This their rage and furie can not bee sufficiently
  indeered. Esay saith, Wee roare all like beares, and mourne like
  doues. These are both extreames. The Beare is a very furious beast, the
  Doue very mild and gentle; the one doth shake the mountaines with his roarings,
  the other scarce throbs forth her mournings from her brest; the one, if you
  rob her of her young ones, is all rage and fiercenesse it selfe, Like a
  Beare robbed of her Whelpes; the other is softnesse and gentlenesse it
  selfe, who if you take away her young, vseth no other resistance but mourning,
  and a soft murmuring; and therefore Osee saith, that she hath no
  heart. It was noted of this people, That they were like doues that mourned with
  their friends, but like furious beares towards their enemies. What greater
  furie than to seeke to kill Lazarus? What madnesse more notorious?
  Marsilius Ficinus saith, That there is a twofold madnesse.
               One, of the braine.
               
                  A twofold madnesse.The other of the
  heart. The one long, the other short. The one makes men madd, the other angry.
  Aulus Gellius reporteth of the Sclauonians, That when they are angrie,
  they kill (like the Basiliske) with their verie lookes.
  Ecclesiasticus saith,
                     Eccl. 30.
  That Enuie and Wrath shorten the life, and bring age before the time.
  Salomon saith, That three things mooue the earth, and that the fourth
  is not to be endured; pointing out the fourth to bee a Slaue, that is made his
  Masters heyre: for a Slaue being seated in honour, growes to be so insolent,
  that it is a thing insufferable. Better may this bee verified of the appetite,
  which being a Slaue, if it once through wrath rebell against reason, it treads
  it vnder foot, captiuates it, and ill intreates it.
               
                  Because that for his sake, many of the Iewes went away and
  beleeued in Iesus. One of the greatest miseries that can befall a
  soule,To take occasion from good to do ill, is hellish
 malice. is, To make good, the occasion of ill. As one of the greatest
  pledges of Gods loue, is, to take occasion from ill, to doe good; so one of the
  greatest pledges of malice, is, to take occasion from good, to doe ill. God
  gaue vnto the children of Israel the gold and siluer of the Egyptians (whether
  it were in requitall and payment of their troubles, or that he was Lord of all,
  and so might dispose thereof as hee listed;) and of this gold and siluer they
  afterwards made a calfe, giuing thereunto that glorie and worship which was due
  onely vnto God. Osee saith, they did the like with Baal, I
  multiplyed their siluer and gold,
                  
                     Osee
 2. 
                  which they bestowed vpon Baall. God gaue them a brazen
  Serpent, to the end that by looking thereon, they might be healed of the
  bitings of the Serpents: From this fauour, they tooke occasion to commit
  Idolatrie,4. Reg. 18. offering incense
  thereunto, as vnto God, till such time as Ezechias brake it in peeces.
  God doth proceede by contrary courses: From Adams sinne he tooke
  occasion to redeeme the world; and (as it seemeth to Saint Augustine)
  if Adam had not sinned, God had not come in person to redeeme him. And
  Saint Gregory calls it Foelix peccatum, A happy sinne;
  because it brought with it so soueraigne a Redeemer. And in many other
  occasions, we may say that of a sinner, which Esay saith, Recepit
  de manu domini duplicia pro omnibus peccatis suis. And that which
  Dauid saith ofan vngratefull people, Pro iniquitate, vide
  tentoria Aethiopiae. Hee there summes vp the many and great fauours which
  he had receiued; and in euery one of them we shall find, pro
  iniquitate.
               
               
                  They consulted to put Lazarus to death. The blanke and
  marke whereat they shot, was to darken and eclypse the name of our Sauiour
  Christ, and to cast a  cloud ouer that glory which could
  not possibly but shew it selfe, in seeing Lazarus to be raised vp from
  death vnto life. This dammage the Lord did repaire with two great honours.
               The first, That most solemne triumph wherewith they receiued
  him, wherof we shall treat hereafter.
               The second, of certaine Gentiles which came according to the
  custome to the feast. Leo the Pope saith, That the Romans made a
  religion of it to adore the seuerall gods of all Nations; and therefore they
  intreated Saint Philip, that he would be a meanes that they might haue
  a sight of our Sauiour Christ, and that they might bee admitted to speake with
  him: Saint Philip communicated this matter with Saint Andrew,
  and they both acquainted our Sauiour therewith. And Iesus answered, The
  houre is now come, that the Sonne of man shall bee made manifest. The
  Apostles did not vnderstand the mysterie thereof: but our Sauiour Christ tooke
  that his comming to be the despertador de su muerte, the awaker and
  reuiuer of his death: For although he imployed both his life and his person in
  Israel, yet his death was to draw the Gentiles to his knowledg and obedience.
  And these Gentiles being so desirous to see him, and to talke with him; taking
  this to be the Vigile of his death, and vocation of the Gentiles; Hee told
  them, Now is the houre come, wherein the Son of man is to be
  glorified, not onely amongst the Iewes, but the Gentiles also.
               Hee calls his death his glorification. For, albeit to dye, be
  weakenesse, yet to dye as Christ dyed, was vnspeakeable valour, and
  vertue.Christs death his glorification. Hee neuer
  shewed himselfe more strong, than when hee was most weake; and neuer lookt
  sweeter than when death was in his face. Hee had hornes comming out of his
  hands, And there was the hiding of his power.
                     Abacuc. 3. Those hands which were nayled to those
  armes of the Crosse, were those hornes wherewith hee ouerthrew the power of
  the world, and of hell. Iacob said of Simeon and
  Leui at the houre of his death, In their selfe-will they digged
  downe a wall, which the Seuentie translate thus, Eneruauerunt taurum,
  They weakened a Bull: By this bull,Christ why called a
 Bull. vnderstanding our Sauiour Christ.
               First, for it's beautie, Quasi primogeniti tauri pulchritudo
  eius,
                  
                     Deut 33. 
                  His beauty shall be
  like his first borne bullocke.
               
               Secondly, For that as the bulls strength lyes in his hornes, so
  did Christ discouer his strength vpon the Crosse, Ibi abscondita est
  fortitudo eius.
               
               Thirdly, because (according vnto Pliny) the Bull
  looseth his fiercenesse, when hee but sees the shadow of the Figge-tree: And
  our Sauiour Christ shewed himselfe most weake, when hee saw the shadow of the
  Crosse, desiring pardon then of his Father for his enemies, who like dogges
  against a Bull, had with open mouth set themselues against him, Many dogs
  are come about mee.
                  
                     Psal. 32. But hee
  repayd (though not allayd) their rage with this so louing and so sweet a
  prayer, Father forgiue them, &amp;c.
               
               The Pharisees seeing themselues thus mockt and deluded, and that
  their plots and intentions tooke not effect, they brake foorth and sayd,
  Perceiue yee not, how we preuaile nothing? and how that the world goeth
  after him? And albeit Saint Chrysostome saith, That these
  speeches were vttered by his friends, thereby to persuade the Pharisees that
  they should not tyre out themselues any longer in persecuting of him, seeing
  it was to no end, but all went crosse with them; Saint August. yet
  saith, That they were the speeches of his enemies, which bemoned their owne
  disgrace and misfortune.
               There could not bee any blindnesse more foule and beastly, than
  that of the  high Priests and Pharisees; who hauing had
  so many tryalls, how little their power and their trickes could preuaile
  against our Sauiour Christ, that all this while they could not perceiue that
  this was Gods businesse, against which, nor counsell, nor wisedome can
  preuaile. Saint Peter preaching Christs resurrection, the high
  Priests and Pharisees called him before them, notifying vnto him, That he
  should not any more touch vpon that point: but hee told them, That he was bound
  rather to obey God than man. And perceiuing his resolution, Dissecabantur
  cordibus suis, They burst for anger when they heard it, and consulted to
  slay both him and his companions. But Gamaliel a Doctour of the Law,
  being there present, and one that was honoured of all the people, aduised those
  that sat there in Councel,
                     Act. 5.to put the
  Apostles forth for a little space out of the Councell house: which done, he
  then said vnto them, Men of Israel bee well aduised what ye doe concerning
  these men: Time will prooue whether this be a Truth or a Lye that these men
  vtter. It is not long since that one The
                        •
                     des boasted himselfe to be a Prophet, who was followed by
  some foure hundred Disciples, but in the end he was condemned to death, and
  they al which obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought. After this man,
  rose vp Iudas of Galilee, and drew away much people after him, but he
  in the end also perished and all his followers. And therefore I now say vnto
  ye, forbeare a while, and refraine your selues from these men, and let them
  alone: For if this their doctrine be of men, it will come to nought; but if it
  be of God ye cannot destroy it. In a word, Time will bring this to light: but
  to go about to take away their liues now from them, were to set your selues to
  fight against God. The like did the Prince of the Ammonits deliuer to
  Nebuchadnezzars Lieutenant Generall, at the Siege of Bethulia; If God
  fauour and protect this people, all Nebuchadnezzars forces are not
  able to subdue them. And this was that which made Iob so confident, Be
  thou on my side, and let all the world be against me, I care not. Saul
  did vse all his best endeauours, and employed all the force and strength he
  had, to worke Dauids death, one while in his owne person, seeking to
  nayle him with his Speare to the wall; another while by setting vpon him with
  his souldiers; but neuer yet could the power of a King preuaile without Gods
  permission, against a silly flye. Gods protection is aboue all his
  workes: so the Princes of the earth, the high Priests, the Pharisees, the
  Clergie, and the Laytie, did cry out against Christ, but were forced to say in
  the end, We preuayle nothing at all. They were strangely blinded, that
  they could not perceiue Gods power herein. Lord so open our eyes that we may
  see the light of thy glorious Gospell. To whom, &amp;c.
            
         
         
            
            THE XXXIX. SERMON.
            
               
                  MAT. 26. MARC. 14. LVC. 22. IOH. 18. 
                  
                     Of St. Peters Deniall, and Teares.
                  
               
            
            
               OF Peters deniall, there are two opinions, as opposite,
as false.Two opinions concern
                     •
                  ng Peters deniall. The one, That Peter
had lost his Faith. Grounding the same vpon the testimonie of Saint
Ambrose, Postquam Petrus fidem se perdidisse defluit, maiorem gratiam
reperit, quam ami
                     •
                  it, After that
Peter had bewailed his lost faith, the grace he found was more than that he
lost. And in that our Sauiours reprehension to his Disciples at his
departure to heauen, Hee reprooued their vnbeleefe and hardnesse of
heart, Where he excepted not Peter.
               
                  Mar. 16. This opinion is primarily contrary to
those words of our Sauiour Christ, I haue prayed for thee (Peter) that thy
faith might not faile thee.
               
                  Luk. 22.
            
            Secondly, it is contrary to naturall reason. For, to passe
sodainly from one extreame to another, though God doth it by extraordinary
wayes, yet neyther Nature, nor Art, nor the Diuell doth it, be it either from
ill to good, or from good to ill. Nemo repentè turpissimus,
said the Poet. The sanctitie of Peter sure was one of the greatest;
and to passe sodainely from a Saint, to an Infidell, (which is numbred amongst
those sins that are the most hainous) it cannot sinke into my head.
            Besides, Faith is like vnto your Ermine, who had rather mori,
quam foedari; rather dye, than durtie it selfe. And therefore Faith is
cloathed in white; a colour wherein the least spot or soyle shewes foulest.
Corresponding with that of Saint Paul, Hauing the mysterie of faith in a
pure conscience. The conscience wherein Faith is to reside, must be pure
and cleane: and as it goes soyling, so it goes lessening and losing it selfe.
And as is the blood of the soule, and the last humour which is vomited forth,
as it is to be seene in those that are sea-sicke; so is it in the vertues of
Faith, Peruenit gladius (saith Ieremie) vsque ad animam,
The sword hath entred euen vnto my soule. Saint Ierome, That the
sword is come vnto the soule, Quando nihil in anima vitale reseruatur, When
there is not any vitall thing that is reserued in the soule, when all
goodnesse is gone out of it.How Peter may be said to haue
  lost his faith. But Saint Peter was not come to that desperate
passe, his case was farre otherwise. And if Saint Ambrose say, That he
lost his Faith, he vnderstood thereby, that loyaltie and fidelitie which
Peter ought better to haue kept, or that confession of his faith,
which vpon that occasion he was bound to haue made; according to that of Saint
Paul, With the heart we beleeue vnto righteousnesse, but with the mouth wee
confesse vnto saluation. 
                And for that reprehension
which our Sauiour Christ bestowed vpon his Disciples at his departure for
heauen,Of Peters Fall. it is a cleere case, that it
was not directed to Peter, as appeareth by the words following, where
it is said, That the rest, when they were told by the women that he was risen
from the dead, it seemed vnto them as a feigned thing, neither beleeued they
them: But Peter was one of the first that ranne vnto our Sauiours
Sepulchre, and reuealed to the rest the glorious resurrection of his Lord and
Sauiour.
            Other Doctours excusing Peter, say, That in this Deniall,
he spake Amphibologically, his words carrying a doubtfull or double meaning,
and yet might admit a good construction; and this opinion S. Ambrose,
S. Hilary, and S. Cyril toucht vpon: but the truth is, that
S. Peter did grieuously sinne therein, and that he had lost his loue,
but not his faith.
            
               The occasions of it.Some treating of the
occasions that made God to turne his eye from Peter, some (they say)
were on Peters part, others on our Sauiours.
            And the first and chiefest occasion was Saint Peters
confidence and presumption. Saint Ambrose professeth, Quod non
erat humanae infirmitatis, sed diuina potestatis, That it was not so much out
of humane fra
                     •
                  ltie as diuine
power; Such a thing, that all the strength and force of humane weakenesse
could not performe. Leo the Pope, Haesi
                     •
                  are permissus est, vt nemo auderet de sua virtute
confidere, He suffered him to stagger, that no man might dare to relye vpon his
owne strength; Vsing it as a cooling-card for confident Presumists. Saint
Augustine expounding that place of the Prouerbs, Neque declines ad
dextram, neque ad sinistram, Doe not decline neither to the right hand, nor
the left, doth put the difficultie in declining to the right hand. We doe
acknowledge two wayes in this our earthly pilgrimage.
            One of life.
            The other of death.
            That it is a dangerous peece of businesse to decline to the way of
death, it is a cleere case; but to the way of life, very darke and intricate.
S. Ierome saith, That the iust man should haue a care not to decline
to the right hand, because he may chance to offend God out of his double
diligence, as Vzza did, in staying the Arke, least it might fall to
the ground. Saint Augustine saith, That our best seruice may be
vnacceptable, if not sinfull, through our owne presumption. And so did
Peter sinne, presuming on his owne proper valour, and setled
resolution: which made our Sauiour Christ say vnto him, Thou shalt deny me
thrice; and hee replyed thrice, Rather than I will deny thee, I will dye a
thousand deaths. O Lord, either thou tellest me thus out of the feare of my
weaknesse, or to try me what I will doe, I haue but one life to loose, If
need were I would dye with thee, &amp;c. He promised that which was not in
the power of his strength to performe. Man promiseth he knowes not what,
because he knowes not himselfe. The Angell knew not what would follow: for had
he had this knowledge at the first, that alone would haue lessened his
contempt. Adam knew by reuelation, That his marriage did represent
that of our Sauiour Christ with his Church; but he knew not the Media,
or meanes that led thereunto. Saint Peter would neuer haue presumed
so much on himselfe, had he knowne what would haue followed thereupon: So that
he promised that which he was not possibly able to performe. But if presuming
on our Sauiour Christs fauour, he had told the wench that stood at the doore, I
am one of Christs Disciples, and I will lay downe my life for the testimonie
of his truth, and mine owne faith; he had secured his life: For it was not
possible that our Sauiour Christ should be false of his word, If ye seeke
me, suffer these first to goe their way. But euermore those men that most
presume, are most  deceiued. Pharaoh pursued the
children of Israel, boasting as he went, I will not leaue a man of them aliue,
I will at once make an end of these Slaues: But this presumption of his
succeeded so ill with him, that he and all his were made food for fishes,
They su
                     •
                  ke like lead to the
bottome of the sea. And anon after it is said, Thy wrath did deuoure
thē, as the fire consumeth the straw. They perished first like lead,
because they descended euen to the bottome of the sea: and they perished like
straw, because they afterwards floated aboue water; to the end that the
children of Israel might behold in their drowned bodies, the powerfull hand of
God. That proud Philistim Goliah, vaunted himselfe, and cryed out vnto
Dauid, Come to me, and I will giue thy flesh vnto the fowles of the
heauen, and to the beasts of the field. He was an able and a valiant man,
but his valour was nothing answerable to his arrogancie and presumption, so
that for all his great brags, himselfe was made a prey for the Vultures.
            God would haue his friends to be valiant, yet cowards; weake, yet
strong; fearefull, and yet confident: and, that the one should grow from the
consideration of their owne weaknesse; and the other, from their affiance in
God. Moses fled (being afraid) from the Serpent; but being animated by
God, hee was so bold, as to take him by the tayle. Tobias out of
feare, fled from the fish, but incouraged by the Angell, he set vpon him, and
was strong enough to teare his iawes in sunder. And therefore Saint
Paul saith, All things are possible vnto me, in him that is my
strength and my comforter. And he might as well haue said, Without God I
can doe nothing, In deo meo (saith Dauid) transgrediar
murum, In my God, I will leape ouer a wall; Whereas without him, he is not
able to crawle ouer a Threshold. The Scribes and Pharisees did presume that
they should enioy those former good times and golden ages of their great
grandfathers and forefathers; but they were not confederat with them in
shedding the blood of the Prophets, and therefore our Sauiour made them this
answer, Behold,
               
                  Ma
                        •
                     . 23. 
               I send vnto you Prophets and wise
men, and Scribes, and of them yee shall kill and crucifie. And of them
shall yee scourge in the Synagogues, and persecute from Citie to Citie; that
vpon you may come all the righteous blood that was shed vpon earth, from the
blood of Abel the righteous, vnto the blood of Zacharias the
sonne of Barachias, whom ye slew betweene the Temple and the Altar.
And yet ye are not ashamed to say, That if ye had beene in the dayes of your
fathers, ye would not haue beene partners with them in the blood of the
Prophets. Benadab king of Syria bosting much of his power, he of
Israel answered him, Let not him that girdeth his harnesse,
               3.
  Reg. 20. 
               boast himselfe as he that putteth it off; He that
fights for the victory, let him not glory as hee that hath got the
victorie: for the successe of warre is doubtfull. The like iudgement
ought euery one to make of the victorie and the warre that is waged with the
soule; which whilest it liueth in this mortall body, cannot assure it selfe; so
various and doubtfull are the successes of this warre. When Iacob had
some difference with his father in Law about the Idols which Rachel
had stolne,
                  Gen. 31. hee told him, Except
the God of my father Abraham, &amp; the feare of Isaac, had been with me,
&amp;c. The Commentators here question it, why Iacob did not as
well say, the God of Isaac, as of Abraham? And Paulus
Burgensis answers thereunto out of the opinion of the Hebrewes, That God
was neuer called the God of any man,God not called the God
  of any man, while he liueth. whilest that man was liuing: because he
doth not then inioy a sure estate. And therefore in regard that
Abraham was dead, and Isaac liuing, he said, the God of
Abraham, and the feare of Isaac. After that braue resolution
which Abraham had to sacrifice his sonne, God sayd vnto him, Now
I know that thou fearest God. But here another doubt now offers it selfe,
That Abraham hauing shewne such a great and 
extraordinarie token of his loue, why God did not say vnto him, I now know
that thou louest God. The reason is, That when a iust man comes to the top
and heigth of his loue, he may presume of himselfe, that he hath then begun to
loue. And, for that feare is the first step to loue, he sayd, Nunc cognoui
quod timeas, &amp;c. By the whole drift of this discourse, that conclusion
of Ecclesiasticus remaineth cleere, Lift not thy selfe vp in the
thought of thy soule, like the Bull. Let not thy thoughts and hopes make
thee doe the things that are vaine and foolish. Hee instances in the bull, an
vntamed beast, which doth not acknowledge heauen. Why wilt thou leaue thy
leafes and thy fruit, and remaine like a dotard in the desart? Iob
saith,
                  Iob 4. 
               If he layd folly on his
Angels, how much more on them that liue in houses of clay? If in the
purest steele, he found rust, and in the finest cloth the Moth, &amp;c. S.
Augustine saith, Nullum peccatum facit homo, quod non possit
facere alter homo, si desit rector, per quem factus est homo, Man doth not
commit that sinne, which another may not

                     •
                  oe, if that Ruler doe not direct
man, by whom man is made.
            
            
               Truths seldome heard in Princes
  Courts.The second occasion on Peters part, was the Pallace of
Caiphas. Saint Ambrose saith, That Peter comming to
warme himselfe at the Pallace, came to denie the truth. For where Truth it
selfe was taken prisoner, he had need of a great deale of courage, that should
not incline to a lye. Aeneas Syluius reporteth, That
Fredericke Archduke of Austria, would goe a nights disguised through
the Tauerns and Victualing houses belonging to the Court, only to heare what
they sayd of himselfe, and his Ministers; &amp; being demanded, why he did
expose his person to that perill? his answer was, Because in Court they neuer
tell truth. Plutarch recounteth of King Antiochus, That
hauing lost himselfe a hunting, hee lighted vpon a Cottage where were a
companie of shepheards, and asking them being at supper, What the world said of
the King and his Ministers? The King (said they) hath the report of a good
honest gentleman, but that the State was neuer worse gouerned than now, for it
is serued by the greediest and the gripingest Ministers that were in the
world: and when he came backe againe to Court, he told those that were about
him; Since I first tooke possession of this my Kingdome, I neuer heard the
truth of things till yesterday. Amongst foure hundred Prophets, which
Ahab consulted,3. Reg. 22. onely
hee met with one that would not lye vnto him, and the King hated him for
telling him the truth. Saint Ambrose calls the Pallace,
Basilica, deriuing it from the Basiliske, which kills with it's looke.
Of this creature Aelian saith, That he vomiteth forth his poyson vpon
a stone: And it fits well for Peter, whom our Sauiour Christ termed
Petram; vpon whom the diuell (whom the Scripture stiles a Basiliske)
vomited foorth his poyson. Our Sauiour Christ receiued much kindnesse and
courtesie in the house of Martha, of Zacheus, and the
Pharisee; but in Herods Pallace they made a foole of him; In that of
Pilat, they whipt him, and crowned him with thornes; and in that of
Caiphas he receiued so many affronts, that God onely knowes what they
were: according to that which Dauid said in his name, Tu scis
impropirum meum, &amp; confusionem meam.
            
            The third occasion was, That hee would enter into the Pallace, by
being brought in by the hands of a woman.S. Peters sinne
  like that of Adam. Saint Bernard saith, Si infidelitas
intrat, quid mirum, si infideliter agat? Maximus Tirronensis saith, That
Peters sinne was much like vnto that of Adam: there being
imployed in both of them, a man, a woman, and a diuell. Adam had a
warning not to eate, Peter not to denie: Eue was the
occasion that Adam did eate; and Cayphas maid-seruant, that
Peter did denie. In a word, a woman was the instrument of all our
deaths, and threw downe to the ground those two Columbs and pillars of the
world: but Peters fall was the fouler,  for
Eue proceeded with inticements and flatteries, and Adam
suffered himselfe to be ouercome, Ne contristaret delitias, Lest he should
grieue his Loue. But this woman (saith Saint Augustine) proceeded
with threatnings; now a woman is very powerfull in matter of allurements,
inticings, dalliance, and deceiuing, through profession of loue: but in matter
of feare (as Saint Gregorie hath obserued) shee is very weake. A woman
triumphed ouer Sampson, Dauid, Salomon, Sisera, and
Holophernes, by making loue, and vsing deceit: but here a maid, with
only a bunch of keyes hanging at her girdle, triumphed ouer Peter, by
feare.
            The fourth occasion was, Saint Peters offering to thrust
into the Pallace. Ioseph could not auoid the occasion, because his
Mistresse called him vnto her; Dauid did cast his eye aside by chance:
but Peter did seeke occasion, And he that loues anger shall perish
by it. He doth not say, He that loues warre or victorie, but he that loues
danger. Many of the children of Israel did cut off the thumbs from their
fingers, because they would excuse themselues from prophanation, by singing the
songs of Sion; and being importuned thereunto, Sing vnto vs one of the
songs of Sion; They answered, How shall we sing one of the Lords songs
in a strange land, &amp;c. Osee saith, Non vocabis me vltra Baalim,
sed vocabis me vir meus. Baalim is the same, as Vir meus, But
because there was an Idol that was called Baalim, God said, Doe not
call me Baalim; to the end that no man may presume that thou yet
bearest Baalim still in thy mind, or for to take all occasion from
thee, of thinking thereof any more.
            On Gods part there are likewise very good reasons.Man bya sight of his owne weaknesse is taught to pity an
  others.
            
            The first shall be of Saint Gregorie. Saint
Peter being to bee a Pastor, it was fit that he should fall into so
foule a fault, least that afterwards he should be scandalized by other mens
offences, and carry too sharpe and hard a hand towards sinners. Saint
Augustine touches vpon the same reason, in his bookes de Ciuitate
Dei, persuading the Bishops of Galilea,Reasons why
  Christ suffered Peter to deny him. That Clemencie should sway more with
them, than seueritie; loue, than power; softnesse, than sharpnesse; for, there
is no man that liues without sinne. And if our Sauiour Christ should haue
censured Peter after his first deniall, he would not haue reapt from
thence so much fruit, as now he did.
            The second shall be of Saint August. who sayes, That it
is a wholesom
                  •
                medicine for a
proud man, to suffer him to fall into some grieuous and manifest sinne; to the
end, that the foulenesse of that fault may abate his pride. Saint
Peter was so peremptorie and so presumptuous, that he did presse this
point with such a deale of confidence and boldnesse, that he told his Master,
Though that all men shall be offended by thee, yet will I neuer bee
offended.
               M
                     •
                  t. 26. And Christ then telling him that hee should denie him
thrice, he presently reply'd thereupon; Though I should dye with thee, yet will
I not denie thee: but you see how this his courage was afterwards cooled.
Which presumption of his, when he saw his great weaknesse, he humbly bewailed
with many a bitter teare, which turned to his exceeding great good. And this
reason is confirmed by Saint Chrysostome, who saith, That God
permitted Peter to denie his Master, that he might thereby learne to
relie more vpon God, than himselfe. Saint Peter gaue lesse credit to
Christs words, than his owne resolution: but the successe thereof did put him
out of his errour. Leo the Pope saith, That God did suffer
Peter thus to fall, that the holiest might take heed not to trust too
much to their owne strength. Euthimius further addeth, that this
negation of his, was as it were a Fiador, or suretie, against anie
bosting or glorying in those so many miracles, which were afterwards to bee
wrought by Peter. Saint Paul saith of himselfe, That the
pricks that he had in his flesh, did serue  as so many
Piguelas or lines to your hawkes iesses, that hee might not sore too
high, being puffed vp with these his many reuelations, Ne magnitudo
reuelationum extollat me.
            
            The third shall be of Leo the Pope, who saith, That God
did permit in Peter so great a sin, Vt in Ecclesia remedium
poenitentiae conderetur, For the better founding and establishing in the
Church, the authoritie and efficacie of repentance. The like reason is rendred
by Saint Ierome, By Peters fall (saith he) was manifested the
vertue of repentance, against the poyson of sinne: which is all one with that
of Saint Paul; I was a blasphemer, a persecuter, &amp;c. And God was
content to giue way thereunto, for the better instruction of those that
were to beleeue hereafter. He that makes treacle, tryes it first vpon his
owne child, &amp;c. God sent Ieremie to the Potters shop, that he
might see how the broken vessell was to be new molded againe, and come out
better than before. And shall not I be able to do as much with you, as the
Potter with his clay? Where it is to be noted, That as the clay
oftentimes receiues a better forme and fashion than at first, and for more
honourable vse: So (saith Saint Chrysostome and Euthymius)
Peter was made much the better by this.
            First, because it was a very good warning vnto him, not to presume
any more on himselfe. And therefore Christ asking him whether he loued him? He
durst neither say I nor no.
            Secondly, because God pardoning this his disloyaltie, it was but a
further inflaming of his loue, and setting his heart more on fire in the zeale
of his seruice; according to that saying of our Sauiour Christ, He little
loues to whom little is forgiuen. In a word, it was a fulfilling of
Abacucs prophesie, If thou didst heretofore tread one step in the way
of death, thou shalt now tread ten for it in the way of life.
            
               Peter more iniurious to Christ, than all his
  enemies Psal. 142. 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   
                  
                     •
                  .12
               Then he began to curse himselfe, and to sweare,
&amp;c, This his negation or deniall, was foretold by Dauid, I looked
on my right hand, and beheld, but there was none that would know me. As
also by Ieremie, They haue denyed the Lord, and said it is not he. S.
Peter had learned in the schoole of Christ, Let your Communication be
yea, yea, and nay, nay. The maid asked him if he were not one of Christs
Disciples, He answered, I am not. But she reply'd vnto him, Thou art;
For thy speech doth bewray thee. But he, that he might auoid all
spies, or any further inquirie, Began to fall a cursing, &amp;c. How
now Peter? Art thou well in thy wits? knowest thou what thou doest?
Thou that sawst thy Sauiour so glorious in Tabor, Thou that confessedst him to
be the Sonne of the liuing God, Thou, whom hee called, together with thy
brother Andrew, to be fishers of men; Thou, to whom he stretcht foorth
his hand in the sea, to saue thee from drowning; doest thou not know him? I
know him not. O Peter lament thy ignorance, for thou hast beene more
cruell to thy Master than all they that conspired against him, and laid their
heads together to torment him: for as for them, some bound his hands, others
his necke, others spat in his face, these buffeted him, those platted thornes
on his head, others pulled him by the beard, and tugged him by the haire, one
pierced his side; but thou didst runne him through the heart. O Peter
(saith Saint Augustine) What is become of your courage now? What, of
your great brags? What of this your protestation and strong resolution, I
will lay downe my life for thee? And of that your, Why should I not follow
thee, and die with thee? There was no torment that troubled Iob so
much, as that his friends should forsake him, My friends and familiar
acquaintance stood afarre off from me. Dauid was not so sensible of any of
all his persecutions, as that of his sonne Absalon; And Iulius
Caesar tooke it not halfe  so tenderly at any of the
other Traytors hands, as of his sonne Brutus, and therfore said vnto
him when he stabd him, Et tu quoque Brute? Ha Brutus art thou in this
Conspiracie? Gentiles and Iewes, Ecclesiasticks and Seculars, Patritians
and Plebeyans, did all conspire against Christ; but none of those iniuries that
they offered him, toucht his heart so neere as Peters Deniall of him.
That Iudas should sell him, betray him, and deliuer him vp into his
enemies hands; that the high Priests, Herod and Pilat should
desire his death, and consent thereunto, it was nothing, because they hated
him and were his professed enemies: But that Peter should denie him,
to whom he had made such glorious promises, and hauing so often made offer vnto
him of his life, that he should play the Renegado, and deale thus and
thus, &amp;c.
            
               Then the Lord turned backe, and looked vpon Peter, and Peter
went out and wept bitterly. Saint Luke like a good Painter
drawes me Peter first with a cole, but now he giues him his more
liuely colours. The first variegation and garnishment that he giues this peece,
was, our Sauiour Christs looking back vpon Peter: How he looked on
him, we haue handled elsewhere. The effect, which this his looking on him
wrought, was the making of his heart to melt like waxe; and the turning of
Christs eye, the turning of Peters eyes into two fountaines. The
Astrologers say, That he that is borne in the aspect of Mars, is
sterne and cruell; in that of Iupiter, mercifull and courteous; in
that of Mercurie, industrous and eloquent. The beams of the sun
inlighten the ayre, dispellclouds, fertilize the fields, breeds pearles in the
shels of the riuers, corall in the bottome of the sea, gold, siluer, and other
mettalls in the veynes of the earth, and like a well ordred clocke, gouernes
all the world. What shall the Son of righteousnesse doe then with the beames of
his Eyes? Sidonius Apolinaris reports of those of Thracia,The power of Christs eyes. That for to signifie the vertue
and power of the eyes of our Sauiour Christ, they did paint a sunne, whence
three Raies, or bright-shining beames brake forth: the one, raising vp one
that was dead; the other did breake a stonie heart; and the third did melt a
snowie mountaine; and the Motto was this, Oculi Dei, ad nos. The
beames of Christs eyes raise vp the dead, breake rocks, and melt snow, A
facie tua (saith Esay) montes defluent. The fire which
they hid in the transmigration of Babylon, the children of Israel found at
their returne, turned into water; but exposing it to the beames of the sunne,
it grew againe to be fire, to the great admiration of the beholders: which is a
figure of Saint Peter, who through his coldnes became water, but the
beames of the Sonne of righteousnesse, raised a great fire out of this water.
Pliny reports of certaine stones in Phrygia, that being beaten vpon by
the beames of the sunne, send forth drops of water: But the beames of the Sonne
of righteousnesse did not onely from this Petra, or stone Saint
Peter, draw teares, but whole riuers of water. According to that of
Dauid,
               
                  Psal. 114. 
               Which turneth
the rocke into water-pooles, and the flint into a fountaine of water.
            
            Saint Ambrose seemeth to stand somewhat vpon it, why
Peter did not aske forgiuenes of his sins at Gods hands?
Inuenio (saith he) quod fleuerit, nō inuenio quid dixerit;
lachrymas lego, satisfactionem non lego; I find that he wept, but do not find
what he said; I read his teares, but read not his satisfaction. The
reasons of this his silence, and that he did not craue pardon of God by word of
mouth, are these:
            First, because he had runne himselfe into discredit by his rash
offers, and afterwards by his stiffe deniall; and therefore thought with
himselfe, That it was not possible for him to expresse more affection with his
mouth, than he had vttered heretofore, Etiam si oportuerit me mori tecum,
non te negabo, &amp;c. And that tongue which had deny'd him, to whom it
had giuen so good an assurance, could neuer  (as he
thought) deserue to be beleeued. And therefore our Sauiour questioning him
afterwards concerning his loue, he durst not answer more than this, Thou
knowest, ô Lord, whether I loue thee or no.
            
            Secondly, he askes not pardon by words, because the pledges of the
heart are so sure, that they admit no deceit. And for that, Lachryma sunt
cordis sanguis, Tears are the hearts blood; S. Ambrose therfore
saith, Lachrymarū preces, vtiliores sunt, quā sermonū; quia sermo in
precando fortè fallit, lachryma omnino non fallit: The prayers of teares
are more profitable, than of words; for words in praying, may now and then
deceiue vs, but teares neuer. S. Chrysostome saith, That our
sinnes are set downe in the Table-booke of Gods memorie; but that teares are
the sponge which blotteth them out. And indeering the force of teares, he
saith, That in Christs souldier, the noblest Act that he can do, is to shed his
blood in his seruice, Maiorem charitatem nemo habet, &amp;c. For what
our blood shed for Christ, effecteth; that doth our teares for our sinnes.
Mary Magdalen did not shed her blood, but she shed her teares: And
Saint Peter did not now shed blood, but hee shed teares; which were so
powerfull, that after that hee had wept, hee was trusted with a part of the
gouernment of the Church; who before hee had wept, had not gouernment of
himselfe:The efficacie of Teares. for teares cure our
wounds, cheere our soules, ease the conscience, and please God, O lachryma
humilis (saith Saint Ierome) tuum est regnum, &amp;c. O
humble Teare, thine is the kingdome, thine is the power, thou fearest not the
Iudges Tribunall, thou inioynest silence to thine accusers: if thou enter
emptie, thou doest not goe out emptie; thou subduest the inuincible, and
bindest the omnipotent.
            
            Hence it is that the diuell beareth such enuie to our Teares. When
Holofernes had dryed vp the fountaines of Bethulia, hee held the Citie
his: and the Diuell when he shall come to dry vp the teares in our eyes, when
he hath stopt vp those waters that should flow from the soule of a sinner, hee
hopes he is his. Elian of Tryphon, the Tyrant, reports of this one
vnheard-of crueltie: Fearing his Subiects would conspire against him, he made
a publike Edict, that they should not talke one with another; and being thus
debarr'd of talking one with another, they did looke very pittifully one vpon
another, communicating their minds by their eyes. And being forbid by a second
Edict, that they should not so much as looke one vpon another, when they saw
they were restrained of that libertie likewise, wheresoeuer they met one
another, they fell a weeping. This seemed to the Tyrant the damnablest and
most dangerous conspiracie of all the rest, and resolued to put them to death.
The diuell is afraid of our words, afraid of our affections, but much more
afraid of our teares. O Lord so mollifie our sinfull hearts, that whensoeuer we
offend thee, our words, our affections, and our teares, may in all deuotion and
humilitie present themselues before thee, crauing pardon for our sinnes. Which
we beseech thee to grant vs for thy deare Sonne Christ Iesus sake. To whom with
the holy Spirit, be all prayse, honour, and glorie, &amp;c.
         
         
            
            THE XL. SERMON. The Conuersion of the good Theefe.
            
               
                  MAT. 27. 
                  
                     Cum eo crucifixi sunt duo Latrones, vnus a dextris, &amp;
  alter a sinistris.
                   
                  There were crucified with him two theeues, one at his right
  hand, an other on his left.
               
            
            
               THere are three most notable Conuersions, which the Church doth
celebrate.
            That of Saint Paul.
            
            That of Mary Magdalen.
            
            That of the good Theefe.
            The one, liuing here vpon earth.
            The other, now raigning in heauen.
            The third, dying vpon the Crosse.
            Of all the rest, this seemeth to be the most prodigious and most
strange.
            First, because Mary Magdalen saw many of our Sauiour
Christs myracles, heard many of his Sermons; and besides, her sisters good
example might worke much good vpon her.
            Secondly, Saint Paul saw Christ rounded about with
glorie, more resplendent than the Sunne; had heard that powerfull voyce which
threw him downe from his horse, and put him in the hands of that dust whereof
hee was created.
            But the Theefe neither saw Miracle, nor Sermon, nor example, nor
glorie, nor light, nor voyce, saue onely Christ rent and torne vpon the Crosse,
as if hee had beene as notorious a theefe as those that suffered on either side
of him.
            Againe, How much the quicker is the motion, and the extreames more
distant, repugnant, and contrarie, by so much the more strange and wonderfull
is this change and alteration. This theef was a huge way off from either
beleeuing, or louing our Sauiour Christ: and that hee should now on the sodaine
and in so short a space, passe from a theefe to a Martyr, from the gallowes to
Paradise, must needs be an admirable change. Mira mutatio (saith S.
Leo) vt insidiator viarum, vsque ad Crucem reus, sit Christi
repente Confessor, This is a wonderfull  change, that a
high-way robber, condemned here to the Crosse, should in the turning of a hand
come to confesse Christ. In this one action did all the attributes of God
shine and shew themselues in a most glorious manner; and especially his
wisedome, in making these extreames to meet and ioyne together so on the
sodaine, and as it were in an instant.
                  Eccl.
  3. 
               Ecclesiastes saith, That there is a time to bee borne, and a
time to dye; a time to plant, and a time to plucke vp that which is planted; a
time to slay, and a time to heale; a time to breake downe, and a time to build;
a time to weepe, and a time to laugh: All these extreames did his wisedome knit
and linke together. In this action meete those two extreames of being borne,
and of dying; for as much as wee see this theefe dye to the world, and to bee
borne anew to Christ. (And the death of the righteous, the Church stiles it a
birth.) Those of planting, and plucking vp that which is planted; because grace
is here planted in the soule of the theefe, and sinne pluckt vp. Those of
slaying, and healing; for that our Sauiour Christ receiues these mortall wounds
in his owne bodie, and healeth those of the theefe. Those of building, and
breaking downe that is built; In regard that the body of sinne is destroyed,
and the building of grace is set vp in him. Those of weeping and laughing; in
that the theefe doth now bewaile his sinnes, and laughes for ioy to heare the
gladsome newes of heauen. In a word, the more incurable that the diseases are
which a Physitian cureth, the more (saith Saint Augustine) is his
skill and cunning to be commended.
            Gods omnipotencie, was likewise seene herein: Saint
Chrysostome saith, That it was so great a Miracle, that the Sunne
should be darkened, that the earth should tremble and shake, that the stones
should dash their heads one against another, or that the vayle of the Temple
should bee rent in twaine; as was the inlightning of a blind vnderstanding,
the mollifying of a hard and stonie heart, and the remoouing from the soule,
the vayle of it's ignorance. And the truth of this may very well bee prooued by
Moses his rod, to whose Empire, though the earth, the sea, the
elements, light, darkenesse, and all creatures whatsoeuer were obedient, yet
could it not mooue hard-hearted Pharaohs brest.
            He likewise discouered his omnipotencie, in making the Theefe an
instrument to reuenge himselfe of the Diuell, of the Pharisees, of Pilat, and
of the people.
            Of the diuell, who (as Saint Ambrose saith) had blasoned
it abroad to the world, and triumphed greatly therin, That our Sauiour Christ
hauing but twelue Apostles, he had woon one of them from him; persuading him,
that it were the better life of the two to be a theefe, than an Apostle: but
for a Iudas, a poore base theefe, which stole but blankes and
farthings, from the pouertie of that sacred Colledge, Christ won a theefe from
him, which had spent his whole life in the diuels seruice and had committed
many famous robberies and notorious thefts. Theeues are the diuells weapons:
but our Sauiour Christ being the stronger of the two, tooke from him the
greatest theefe in the world, leauing him with his owne sword confounded and
ashamed,
                  Cant 1. 
               I haue compared thee
ô my Loue to the troupes of horses in Pharaohs charriots. Salomon
had great store of horses of the Aegyptian race for to furnish his charriots,
and to feare his enemies (as the French vse to wage warre against Spaine with
Spanish Gennets,) He then saith, that as Salomon made war against the
Aegyptians, with the horses of Aegypt: so the Church confoundeth the diuell
with his owne Armes, which are theeues and robbers. Confounding and making
ashamed Pilat, the high Priests, the Pharisees, and the people, with
the tongue of a theefe. There is not any thing in the world more 
 infamous than a theefe. Of all basenesse it was the
greatest, that our Sauiour should die as a theefe. It was much that hee should
become man, Exinaniuit semetipsum; more that hee should take vpon him
the forme of a seruant; Formam serui accipiens; and more then that,
That he should be no more esteemed of than a worme of the earth; and more yet
then this, That he should take vpon him in his Circumcision the image of a
sinner; but most of all, that hee should die as a notable theefe, betwixt two
theeues. In the garden he said, Ye come forth to apprehend me as if I had
beene a Theefe. There he was taken like a theefe, here condemned to death
as a theefe, that no man might take pittie of him. There is no man that dies by
the hand of Iustice but is pittied of the people, saue only the theefe; not one
that takes compassion of him. He that seeth a theefe hung vp in the highway,
vseth as he passeth by, to say, Benedictum lignum, per quod fit Iustitia,
Blessed be that gallowes, on which such good Iustice is done. The Church
receiueth the Iewes, the Moore, and the Gentile, but will not entertaine a
theefe. In Leuiticus, God did forbid the Weasil, and the Mouse, and
the frog, also the Rat, and the Lyzard, and the Cameleon, and the Crocodile,
and the Mole, as vncleane and vnfit to be eaten: and if you will but reade in
the naturall Histories the conditions and properties of these creatures, you
shall see that they are all theeues. It made many men maruell, That the
Crocodile being so great a creature, the diuine Historian should reckon him vp
amongst these other contemptible &amp; small creatures. And Rodolphus
Flauiacensis renders the reason of it to be this, That they haue all of
them theeuish qualities. The Crocodile more particularly swims in the sea,
runnes on the land, one while by day, another while by night; she layes a verie
little egge, which afterward growes to be a great beast, and goes still
increasing as long as shee liueth; and is not onely the stampe and figure of a
Sea-pyrat, but of a Land-robber, which night and day seekes all occasions to
rob and steale. Like vnto that theefe which in some poore country village,
begins first to fall a pilfring of some sixe royalls, and from this so small a
beginning, raiseth his stock to fiftie thousand Ducats, and comes at last to be
a Regidor, a Cauallero, and a Titulado. And by this
so vile and errant a theefe, as is here now treated of, our Sauiour Christ did
confound all Ierusalem. He might haue made vse of the tongue of a Prophet, or
an Euangelist; but as Sampson shewed his valour in conquering a
thousand armed men with the iawe-bone of an Asse, which had not approued it
selfe to be so great, had he made vse of Golias his sword, or
Hercules club, or of Theseus his mace, so our Sauiour Christ,
&amp;c.
            Gods mercie in this case, did also shew it selfe exceedingly.
Saint Augustine saith, That this Conuersion was an especiall Myracle
of Christs affronts and wounds. He deliuered vp himselfe to the shame and
reproch of the Crosse, that he might glorifie this theefe. That he might saue a
theefe, was the intent of his dying betweene two theeues. And in another place,
he saith, That he was nayled on the Crosse, and suffered his blood to be shed,
that he might cleanse a will that was growne so aged and foule with sinne.
Thomas saith, That it is Gods great mercie, that those that are growne
old in their sinnes, should be saued: For, hauing by ill and long custome
their taste so quite marred and spoyled, they abhor that which should giue them
health, and dye in the end by the hands of their owne foolish longings. On
their graues that died by the fire of Gods wrath, whilest the flesh of their
quayles was yet betweene their teeth, this Epitaph was put; Sepulchra
concupiscentiae. For commonly, these their masters and their delights are
both buryed together. And therefore S. Paul saith,1. Cor. 10. 
               Now these are ensamples to vs, to
the intent that we should not lust after euill things, as they also
lusted. The truth  is alwayes answerable to the
figure: and if you prolong your longings as they did in your life time, your
death like theirs will be likewise bad. Saint Bernard treating vpon
that place of Saint Matthew,
               
                  Mat. 3.
               The axe is now put to the root of the tree, saith, That the tree doth
for the most part fall to that side, whereunto the weight of it's boughs
causeth it to incline; and that our lustfull longings and desires are the
boughs of this tree, inclining the contrary way. And therefore if a mans whole
life shall leane wholly vnto sinne, and incline it selfe to wickednesse, it
must be Gods exceeding great mercie, if it fall at last vnto Grace.
            Gods mercy was also the more, in regard of this theeues
blaspheming of him, The theeues likewise reuiled him. Saint
Augustine, Epiphanius, Anselme, Saint Ierome, Saint
Ambrose, and Beda saith, That the plurall number is put here
for the singular; and that onely one thiefe did blaspheme,by the figure
Synedoche, or Analogia, as it seemeth to Saint
Augustine; which (according to Saint Ierome) is a figure
frequently vsed in Scripture. Saint Luke saith, That the souldiers
gaue our Sauiour vinegre to drinke, whereas the rest of the Euangelists speake
onely of one.
                  Exod. 32. Dan. 1
                     •
                  . Act 4. Psal. 2.
  Heb.
                Of the calfe, Exodus saith, These, ô
Israel, are thy Gods. Nebuchadnezzar said to the three children,
Sydrach, Misech, and Abednego, speaking of the Statue of
gold, Ye will not worship our Gods. Dauid treating of Herod
and Pilat, as appeareth by that of the Acts, saith, The
Kings of the earth band themselues, and the Princes are assembled together
against the Lord, and against his Christ. Saint Paul in his
Catalogue which he makes of the Saints, saith, They stopped the mouths of
Lyons; Daniel being the onely man that did it: so, Secti sunt,
When it was onely Esayas that was sawne asunder. Againe,
Circuierunt me loris, which had onely reference to Elias. And
it is a very vsuall phrase both in the Latine and the Spanish tongue, to say,
Alexandros, Annibales, Scipiones, &amp;c. And a maine argument hereof,
is that sharpe and seuere reprehension wherewith hee rebuked his companion,
that blasphemed Christ; saying vnto him, Fearest thou not God, seeing thou
art in the same condemnation? Who if he had blasphemed our Sauiour, would
neuer haue so roundly reprooued him.
            Of a contrary opinion to this is Saint Ierome, Saint
Chrysostome, Cyril, Hilary, Thomas, Origen, Theophilact, Euthimius,
Saint Ambrose, and Saint Marke, and Saint Matthew
seeme to expresse as much in plaine termes: but be it in that sence that they
would haue it, it is but so much the more indeering of Gods mercie, who also
hath compassion euen of the beasts of the field. According to that which
Esay prophesied,
                  Esay 43. Iob
  58. 
               The wild beasts shall honour me, the Dragons and the
Ostriches, because I gaue water in the desert, and flouds in the
wildernesse to giue drinke to my people, euen to mine elect: as if he should
haue said, It is not much that the starres of heauen should praise me, or the
Quire of Angels, or the children of God, which are captiuated by their
knowledge of me, &amp; the benefits that I haue heaped vpon them. But that a
theefe, a villaine, one that was bred vp in bushes, and lay lurking to doe
mischiefe in the thickest of the woods, and in mountainous places, that such a
one should praise and magnifie my name, it must haue an Epithite beyond more
than much.
            Lastly, The diuine prouidenc
                  •
                shew'd it selfe, in hauing hid and laid vp such it's treasures in
a theefe, Hast thou entred into the treasure of the snow? or hast thou
seene the treasures of the hayle,
               
                  Iob
  38.22. 
               which I haue hid against the time of trouble? &amp;c. In
the frozen brest of a sinner, and in those stormes of our sinnes, as thicke and
as hard as hayle, God hath hidden and stored vp (as Saint Gregorie
saith) against the day of trouble, the great and rich treasures of his
grace.
            
               There were two theeues crucified with him, one on the right
hand, and the other on the  left. The doubt which in
this storie doth most grauell mens thought, is, That of two theeues which were
crucified on either side of our Sauior, the one should be saued, and the other
damned. S. Aug. renders two reasons thereof. And first of all we are
to suppose, that there it not any cause of predestination: Before that they
had done either good or euill, I loued Iacob, and hated Esau; So saith
Saint Paul. And in another place, Hath not the Potter power out of
the same masse or lumpe, to make one vessell for honour, and another for
dishonor? Some for to serue in the kitchin, and some to set vpon the
table. The iudgements of God are secret, which wee must rather reuerence than
inquire into, crying out with the same Apostle, O altitudo aiuitiarum,
&amp;c.
            
            Secondly, it is to be supposed, that of our vocation to faith,
there is likewise no cause giuen. And therefore in this point, we must take
Saint Augustine along with vs, who saith, Quare hunc trahat, hunc
non trahat? id est; Ad fidem, noli iudicare, si non vis errare. Iudge not, why
he drawes this man to Faith and not that.
            
            And here Saint Augustine brings in the example of
Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar, whom God sought to draw vnto him
with one and the selfe-same kind of force and violence: But the one did follow
him that lent him his hand to direct him, and the other refused to be guided
by him. They were both men according to nature; both Kings, according to their
dignitie; both had sinned alike, Quoad culpam, for they had made Gods
people slaues, and vsed them very ill and hardly; and quoad poenam,
they were both of them punished with stripes from heauen. The warning was alike
to both: but how then comes it to passe, That the meanes being in both alike,
the ends should be so diuers and different? That the one should acknowledge
Gods power, and repenting his wickednesse, sorrowed with teares, and said,
I Nebuchadnezzar praise and glorifie the King of Heauen; But the
other persisting in his obstinacie, said, I know not the Lord, Who is the
Lord? &amp;c. In this account may come in those two seruants of
Pharaoh, which were fellow-prisoners with Ioseph, whereof the
one was saued, and the other hanged. We may likewise put into the reckoning
those two, of whom Saint Matthew saith, that grinding in one mill,
The one shall be receiued, and the other refused.
               
                  Mat. 24. And those two, who standing by
Aaron, when he was offering incense, the one was strucken dead, and
the other remained aliue. And as in the Tribunall of iudgement, God shall put
the sheepe on the right hand, and the goates on the left, and shall separate
the good fishes from the bad, and chaffe from the corne, and the tares from the
wheat; so in the Tribunall of the Crosse, Leo the Pope saith, he
condemned the blasphemous theefe, and saued the good theefe.
            The second morall reason, was to teach vs in those two
theeues,The nature of Hope and Fea
                     •
                  e. the easiest and the safest way to heauen: To
wit, That a soule should liue betweene hope and feare. Feare is the bridle
which holds in Hope; Hope is the anchor which secureth Feare. Feare makes thee
a coward, considering what thou art, &amp; the smal worth that is in thee: But
Hope makes thee confident, considering what God is, and his infinite clemencie.
Vpon these two vertues, God imployeth all his fauours, Gods eyes are vpon
those that feare him, and those that trust in his mercie: For he hath his
eyes nayled vnto those which feare him,
                  Gen.
  49. and place their hopes on his goodnesse. Iacob prophesied of
Isachar, That he should be a strong Asse, cowching downe betweene two
burthens. It is a common saying, That those are not to be trusted that liue
between two Kingdomes: because borderers (for the most part) are a bold and
vnruly people. But here it is quite otherwise, The best people for heauen, are
those that liue between the Feare of hell, and the Hope of heauen. Saint
Augustine declares the extraordinarie happinesse of this vertue of 
 Feare, Beatipauperes Spiritu, Blessed are the poore
in Spirit, For they that haue much to loose, liue still in feare. A stout
Roman being threatned by Caesar, told him, Mihi senectus metum
ademit, Old age hath made mee fearelesse: Hee had but a few yeares to
liue, which made him esteeeme the lesse of the losse of his life. But the
righteous considereth with himselfe, that he hath eternall yeares to loose,
I had those yeares still in my mind;
               
                  Iude.
                
               w
                     •
                  e therefore vnto them that haue followed the wayes of Cain, and are
cast away by the deceit of Baalams wages. There are some which build too
much vpon their owne confidence, like vnto Balaam, who hauing been
both disobedient and couetous, would yet notwithstanding dye the death of the
righteous.
                  Num. 33. Without Hope, what good
can man inioy? The diuell vsed all the tricks and deuices that his wit was able
to inuent, to put Iob out of hope: For which end he made vse of two
meanes.
            
               Sathans practise to depriue Iob of
  Hope.The one he took from the earth, by procuring that those his
friends, on whom he most trusted, and hoped for greatest comfort from them,
should cast him downe, and driue him into despaire, by their bitter words and
sharpe censures.
            The other from heauen, by getting fire to descend from thence;
speaking in these two thus vnto him, What shouldst thou now doe but despaire
and die, seeing thou hast nothing to hope for either from heauen aboue, or
earth beneath. He hath not onely robbed mee of my leaues and my boughs, tearing
downe my branches, but hath rent vp my hopes by the rootes. And yet for all
this, saith patient Iob, Though he kill me, yet will I trust in him.
Saint Ambrose saith, That God doth most of all resent the sinne of
desperation; Not because of all other sinnes it is the greatest, but because it
is most preiudiciall to man: for it shuts vp the passage to blessednesse, and
barres the doore of heauen against vs; God being more sensible of the hurt we
doe our selues, than of the wrong wee doe him. And therefore Iudas his
despaire did much more trouble him, than did his selling of him: for in selling
him, he did but shew what little reckoning he made of his Humanitie; but in his
despairing, the base opinion that he had of his Diuinitie. Vae illis
(as before) qui in viam Cain abierunt,
               
                  Gen.
  4. 
               Woe vnto them that haue followed the wayes of Cain. Now the
worst of those wayes that Cain tooke, was his despaire, Maior est
iniquitas mea, quam vt veniam merear; as if he should haue said, God
either cannot or will not pardon so grieuous and hainous a sinne as this is.
Yet we see, that God did permit, that he might lay some good ground for our
Feare, that one of the theeues should be damned: and that it is neither our
dying side by side with Christ, nor his bedashing vs with his diuine blood,
neither the prayer which he made to his Father with teares in his eyes, nor the
hauing of the image of a Crucifixe, or of the Virgin Mary hanging at
our beds head [but the wearing of Christ in our hearts by Faith] could do this
theefe any good, or keep him from leaping at once from the Crosse vnto hell:
and yet he would that the other should be saued, not onely as he was a theefe,
and to finde pardon of that particular offence; as to lay a foundation for the
Hope of forgiuenesse, for all other sinnes whatsoeuer committed by vs in this
world, and to the end, that his absolution (as Saint Augustine saith)
and his indulgence might serue as a comfort to all Christians, For, as in
Adam we lost Paradise; so in the theefe we got it againe. Certaine
desperate fellowes vttered by Ezechiel, Our bones are dryed vp, and our
hope is perished: But God in answer sayes vnto them, I will open your
Sepulchres, and put life into those your drie bones; doe ye not therefore
despaire. And for the better ingrafting of this truth in his peoples hearts, he
raised vp a whole field that was full of these bones, &amp;c. Arnoldus
the Abbot saith, Non habet metas diuina clementia: Sit, qui inuocet; erit,
qui exaudict: Sit, qui poeniteat; non de
                     •
                  rit  qui indulgeat: Gods mercie knowes no
bounds, nor limits. Let man call, and God will heare: let man repent, and God
will forgiue.
            
            
               We indeed receiue things worthy of that we haue done, but this
man hath done nothing amisse. This whole Historie doth depend vpon these
foure points.
            The first point, are those motiues, which moued this Theefe to be
conuerted.
            The second, The great good hap that he had.
            The third, The diligence that he vsed on his part, that God might
pardon and fauour him.
            The fourth and last, The fauour that he did him, and the great
reward hee bestowed vpon him.
            Amongst other Motiues, the first shall be the Title of the Crosse,
Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum, Iesus of Nazareth King of the Iewes.
It was prophesied, That his Kingdome should take it's beginning from the
Crosse,Motiues iuducing the theefe to his
  conuersion. 
               Dominus regnabit à ligno. The Iewes did
secretly honour the word à ligno; The Saints did openly
reuerence it. Christ had giuen great pledges in his birth, that hee was
à King, by Angels, Shepheards, and Kings; In his life, by the obedience
of all sorts of creatures, Who is this whom the winds and seas obey?
By the voices of the Diuells themselues, by the whips of the Temple, and by his
last Supper. Here bee some standing here which shall not taste of death
vntill, &amp;c. In his passion. My kingdome is not of this world; and
ye shall see the Son of man comming in power. But in his death hee gaue
farre greater pledges. All the creatures gaue testimonie of their Creator; The
diuels cried out (so sayes Eusebius Caesariensis) Pan magnus
interijt. And howbeit, on Pilats and the peoples part, the Title
of the Crosse was placed there in scoffe and scorne of him; yet the diuine
prouidence made vse of these liuing instruments. And as in the creation he
walked on the waters, so in the reparation of mankind, he passed through
punishments and paines; of our Sauiour Christ, making their iests turne to
earnest: The same consideration being likewise to be had, concerning the
Crowne, the Scepter, and the Robe of purple, which in derision they put vpon
him, &amp;c.
            
               Hilarie and Bonauenture both say, That our
Sauiour Christs Patience, was one great Motiue; In heauen, the Father, the
Sonne, and the Holy Ghost beare witnesse;
               
                  Io
                        •
                     . 5. 
               In earth, the Holy
Ghost, Water, and Blood: All these testimonies proue the Diuinitie of
Christ. But to let passe those of heauen; The Holy Ghost doth prooue that hee
was a Diuine person, whose voyce was so powerfull when the Spirit tooke his
leaue of his body, that it forced the Centurion to say, Vere filius Dei
erat iste,
               
                  Mar. 15. 
               Truely this man
was the Son of God. The Water (which was miraculous) prooues, that he was
a Diuine person; for it is not possible, that water should naturally flowe from
a dead body. The Blood, that prooues it, not onely in regard of it's muchnesse,
but that it was shed with so much patience. For though his wounds were many,
and his torments great, yet like a sheepe before the Shearer, he neuer once
opened his mouth, or shew'd the least resistance. And Euthymius, and
Theophylact adde, That the prayer which he heard him make to his
Father, Father forgiue them; (which was the first that he vttered on
the Crosse) did worke that amasement in this theefe, That he said with
himselfe, Sure this is no man: And thereupon began to haue an assured hope of
the forgiuenesse of his sinnes. For (thought he) he that is so desirous to
pardon those that had vsed him so cruelly, not onely tormenting him in his
body, but also scoffing and flouting at him, to vexe (if it were possible) his
soule, will surely farre more willingly pardon me, who being heartily sorry for
my sinnes, desire to become his seruant. I haue heard that the Kings of
Israel are mercifull: but none of them all had so generous 
 and free a heart, as our Sauiour Christ.
Tertullian saith, That hee came into the world, for to shew himselfe a
God in his suffering; making Patience the badge and marke of his
Diuinitie.Patience the badge of Christs Diuinitie.
And that the power which he shewed in pardoning, being so great; much greater
was that which hee shewed in suffering. It was much that he should suffer for
man, much more in that he suffered for man, when as man would not suffer him to
be God. To admit a Traytour to his boord, to bid him welcome, to feast him, and
make much of him, that finding himselfe so kindly vsed, he may make him
surcease from his plotted treasons, winning him vnto him by these and the like
courtesies, well may a man doe this; but that God should admit a Iudas
to his table, that he should eate with God, God witting, That he would goe
from the table to execute his treason, to sell God, and to deliuer him vp into
the hands of his enemies, onely God and his patience could suffer so great an
iniurie: which made Saint Augustine to say, A potentia discimus
patientiam.
            
            S. Chrysostome, Origen, and S. Ierome, are or
opinion, That the alteration of the sunne and the elements, wrought the same
effect vpon the theefe, as it did vpon Dyonisius in Athens, when he
cryed out, Either the world is at an end, or this man is God. Vincent
Ferrariensis saith, That the shadow of our Sauiour Christ did inlighten
this Theefe. And that the shadow of Saint Peter healing bodies, it was
not much, that the shadow of Christ should heale soules. Whereunto may be
applyed that of Dauid, Thou hast shadowed my head in the day of
battaile.
            
            
               Petrus Damianus saith, That the blessed Virgin might bee
a meanes of this Theeues Conuersion, by intreating her sonne, that he would be
pleased to open the eyes of his soule: Whether she were mooued thereunto,
because the good theefe did not reuile Christ, or whether (which Saint
Augustine reports, though some attribute the same to
Anselmus) That in her iourney to Aegypt, hee being Captaine of the
Theeues, did the blessed Virgin many good seruices, being much taken with the
prettinesse of the child, and the sober and modest countenance of the mother;
sure I am, that it was a happines so sole in the world, &amp; consisting of
such strange circumstances, That no man did, or euer shall enioy the like good
lucke. And as we cannot expect a second death of our Sauiour Christ; so such a
second happy incounter as this was, cannot bee hoped for. This Theefe came in
that good time, when as heauen did shoure downe mercies; when there was a
plenary Indulgence and Iubilee granted; when God did poure forth the balme of
his Blood for to ransome man; when the doores of heauen, and the wounds of
Christ were equally open; when the fountaine of liuing water, did cry out in
the middest of the world, If any man thirst, let him come vnto mee and
drinke; when our Sauiour had such a longing desire to see the fruit of his
labors and sweats; when he had put that petition to his Father, which began
with Ignosce illis, Forgiue them: And it seeming vnto him, That his
Father was too slow in granting his request, he did thus pittifully complaine
vnto him, O my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why came I into
the world? Why was I borne in pouertie, liued in labour, and dyed in sorrow?
What? Haue I laboured then in vaine?
            
            Secondly, it was his happinesse, (as Saint Gregory Nissen
hath obserued) That he inioyed our Sauiour Christs side, and his shadow; that
he was so close vnder his wing. He that sayles in a little Barke with a
powerfull Prince, as it succeeded vnto Iulius Caesar, Caesarem vehis, &amp;
fortunam eius, It is not much that he should be fauoured. Saint
Ambrose saith, That as long as Peter stucke close to Christs
side, he did set vpon a whole squadron at once; but when he was gone but a
little further  off from vnder his wing, a silly maid
did out-face him, and made him turne coward. And when hee began to sinke in the
sea, because he was neere Christ, Christ stretcht out his hand vnto him to saue
him, whereas if he had beene but two strides further from him, he might haue
beene in danger of perishing. Saint Cyprian stiles him, Collega
Christi, Christs Colleague, His fellow and companion. When one goes forth
into the field vpon a challenge, one girts his sword vnto him, another buckles
his armour, and others accompany him into the field; and if he get the
victorie, all doe share in the glory of the Conquerour. In that his combat in
the desart, the Angels did wait vpon him: In that combat of his death, an
Angell comforted him. The Theefe, he goes along with him for companie, and all
doe partake of his glory.
            Thirdly, Saint Chrysostome saith, That he met with
another happinesse, to wit, That he dyed as Christ did, vpon the Crosse: God
hauing proposed heauen vnto vs in Conquest; onely he shall inioy it, that can
get it by force of Armes. But the Crosse doth excuse them this labour; For, it
being heauens key,The Crosse is heauens Key.
whosoeuer shall come therewith, may enter without any violence; but others
must be forced to knocke, and that hard, at the gates, and it is well if with a
great deale of labour he can get in at last. Saint Bernard saith, That
the leagues which are betweene earth and heauen, are without number; but he
that hath a familiar, let him bestride but a sticke, and with that woodden
horse he will trauell in two houres from Madrid to Rome: This vertue the Crosse
inioyes, with much more aduantage; doe but fasten your selfe to that, and in
an instant you shall be conueyed to heauen. And expounding that word, Dum
veneris in regnum tuum, this Saint saith, Et tum vidit, Then, euen
then did he see him taking his iourney for heauen, and said vnto him,
Lord remember me when thou commest into thy Kingdome.
            
            Fourthly, it was his good hap to stand mainely then for Christs
honor, when in a manner all the world had forsaken him, Quando Petrus
(saith S. Chrysost.) negabat in terrae, Latro confitebatur in
Cruce, When Peter denyed him on earth, the Theefe acknowledged him on the
Crosse. When Iudas (saith S. Ambrose) sold him as a
Slaue, then did the Theefe acknowledge him for his Lord. O my good Theefe
(saith S. Aug.) What couldst thou see in a man that was blood-lesse,
blasphemed, abhorred, and despised? What Scepter? what Crowne couldst thou hope
for from him, whose Scepter was a reede, whose Crowne thornes? &amp;c.
Dauid commanded his son Salomon,
               3.
  Reg. 2. that he should shew kindnesse to the sonnes of
Barzillai the Gileadite, and cause them to sit downe and eat with him
at his owne table, because they stucke close vnto him in his tribulation.
            Fiftly, That he had the good happe to bee there iust in the nicke
when Christ was crowned with a Crowne of glorie, and had made this his wedding
day, and all things were ended according to his owne hearts desire: and
therefore so noble a bridegroome could not but conferre answerable fauours;
and so great and generous a King, do no lesse than bestow a Crown vpon him
Shi
                     •
                  ei railed against
Dauid, when flying from Absalon, he went halfe naked and
vnshod, by the skirt of a mountaine; but when the war was ended, he prostrated
himselfe at the Kings feet, and said, Let not my Lord impute wickednesse vnto
me, nor remember the thing that thy seruant did wickedly, when my Lord the King
departed out of Ierusalem, that the King should take it to his heart: for thy
seruant doth know that I haue done amisse. But Abishay the sonne of
Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei die for this?
because he cursed the Lords annoynted? Shall foure words of submission saue the
life of this blasphemous dog? But Dauid said, Shall there any man die
this day in Israel? Dost thou not know, that I am this day King ouer
Israel? 
                Make account that they now crowne me anew,
and that it is fit that I should shew my selfe franke and generous, not
conferring fauours according to the merit of him that askes them, but according
to the liberall disposition of him that doth them.
            This good fortune no man may expect, much lesse depend vpon: and
therfore Eusebius Emisenus saith,Repentance must
  not be delayed. 
               Periculosum est in vltimum diem promissa
securitas; And that the example of the Theefe, doth not fauour deferred
amendment till a mans death: And though we are not to streighten Gods
franke-heartednes; and howbeit it may be presumed, that in that houre many
theeues are in Gods secret will saued; yet did he onely leaue this one publike
example vnto vs, Onely this one, (saith S. Bernard) that thou mayest
not presume; and only this one, that thou maiest not despaire. And weighing
those words, Verely, I say vnto thee, to day shalt thou be with me in
Paradise; he saith, That he did bind it with an oath, as he vsed to doe in
matters of greatest moment and difficultie: To thee onely, not to any other,
shall befall the like extraordinarie good hap; for thee onely, was this
Hodiè ordained. Here then mayest thou see the rarest accident
that euer hapned, earth and heauen reconciled, whilest riuers of Diuine blood,
run streaming from our Sauiours side for our saluation.
            But some one will aske me, How comes it to passe, that this Theefe
in so short a space knew the set time and season of this his happy chance, when
as Ierusalem in so many yeares could not light vpon the like encounter? S.
Augustine, S. Chrysostome, and Leo, answer
hereunto; That he had Christ for his Master, who reuealed the same vnto him,
complying with that deliuered by Ieremie, De coelo misit ignem, &amp; eru
diuit me. Gregorie Nissen saith, Repleuit eum eruditione Spiritus
Sancti. Cromatius; In ipso crucis candelabro sol resplenduit, The Sun did shine
vnto him vpon the candlesticke of the Crosse. Theophilact doth here apply
that parable of Saint Mat. No man doth light a candle, and set it vnder a
bushell. In a word, this light was so powerfull, that it awakened this
drowsie and sleepie theefe, snorting in the security of sin, leauing him so
well instructed, that S. Augustine saith, He remained as a Master in
the Church.
            First of all, he vsed extraordinarie diligence in taking hold of
this treasure, leauing all, that he might not loose this, He gaue God all
that was in his free power to giue him. He had his hands and his feet
nayled vnto the Crosse; onely hee had left free vnto him his tongue, and his
heart: imploying in Christs seruice, whatsoeuer was in his freedome to
performe; as his tongue in defending him, and his heart in louing him.
            Secondly, He did not stand waiting for the last plucks of Hope.
Emisenus saith, That it was not his last houre, but the first, wherein
hee knew his Sauiour Christ to be God. It is now sixtie yeares since (dearely
beloued) that some of you haue knowne him, and yet yee deferre your repentance
till the houre of your death.
            Thirdly, he confessed his sinnes, and how deseruedly he did
suffer, Wee indeed receiue things worthy of that we haue done. For he
that will goe about to craue pardon for his sinnes, the first step to
forgiuenesse, is to accuse himselfe of them. Dauid entred in this way,
and the Prodigall, when they cryed Peccaui; so did the Publican,
Propitius esto mihi Peccatori. And the Wise man teacheth vs to get in
this way, Dic tu prius iniquitates tuas, vt iustificeris. Iustus in
principio sermonis accusator est sui. Saint Bernard addeth,
Sui non alterius, He is his owne accuser, not another mans. Saint
Chrysostome, That if the Theefe had not confest the faults of his
life, he would neuer haue presumed to desire Christ to remember him in his 
 death. Saint Augustine, That if Adam
had not sought to excuse himselfe, God would neuer haue thrust him out of
Paradise. Saint Chrysostome doth much lament it, that our Sauiour
saying; One of you shall betray me; and prophesieng the bad end that he should
make, Iudas should not confesse his fault, but should so boldly vtter
as he did, Is it I Master? Hee should haue left out then Nunquid,
Is it I? and said, Ego sum, I am the man; then had hee not lost
heauen by a word. Saint Gregorie, That the Theefe neuer shewed
himselfe so subtill and so craftie in the office of theeuing, as now; for with
this his last theft, he repaired all the thefts of his forepassed life,
Alij latrones, latrocinio vitam perdunt, hic autem latrocinio vitam f
                     •
                  rator sempiternam, Other theeues by
theeuing loose their life; but this theefe by theeuing, handsomely robs heauen,
and goes cleane away with an euerlasting life.
            
            
               Lord remember me when thou commest into thy kingdome,
&amp;c. As this petition was a very humble one, and a modest one; so was
it a most discreet one.
            First of all, all mans happinesse doth consist in Gods hauing vs
in his remembrance. Those that are predestinated,Man is
  nothing but as God remembers him. haue their names writ downe in the
book of Life; of the Reprobat there is no mention made in that book.
Dauid askes the question, What is man that thou art so mindfull of
him? Saint Augustine saith, That the second part of this verse is
an answer to the former. Qu
                     •
                  a
est homo? What? Quod memor es eius. For man is neither more nor
more worth, than as farre foorth as hee is in Gods good remembrance. Naturall
Philosophie doth multiplie the definitions of man; but in Christian
Philosophie, there are onely two.Two definiti
                     •
                  ons of man.
            
            The one, Deum time, &amp; mandata eius ser
                     •
                  a. Hoc est omnis homo. All mans
being doth consist in fearing God, and keeping his commandements.
            The other, Quod memor es eius, His good continuance in
Gods memorie; and this is implyed in, Memento mei, Remember me. I do
not desire that thou shouldst make me a free Denizen of thy Kingdome; nor that
thou shouldst honour me, as thou doest those that haue truly serued thee; but
only that thou wilt be pleased to remember, That though I do not dye here for
thee, yet I dye with thee: And that it grieues me to the very soule that I had
not known thee, that I might haue suffered the torment of this Crosse in thy
seruice, and for thy sake, and that I might haue laid down my life, nay a
thousand liues, if I had had so many, for thy loue. O Lord haue therefore
mercie vpon me, and suffer me to suffer not onely so long as my life, but as
the world lasts, so that at last thou wilt but thinke vpon me.
Considerabat (saith S. Augustine) facinora sua, &amp;
pro magno habebat, si ei, in fine mundi parceretur, He did throughly weigh his
owne wickednesse, and would take it for an exceeding great fauour, that when
the world should haue an end, he might haue his sinnes forgiuen him. He
had happely heard that which our Sauiour Christ said, Videbitis filium
hominis, venientem in potestate, &amp;c.
            
            Saint Gregorie doth discourse very wittily of the
Theologicall and Morall vertues of this Theefe. And beginning first with his
faith, he compares it with that of Abraham, of Esay, of
Moses, of the three Disciples, of Nicodemus, and
Nathaniel, with that of Saint Paul, and that of the
Canaanitish woman; and hee seemes to preferre it before all theirs: For, if
Abraham beleeued,
                  Gen. 15. hee spake
with God in person, hee had many present fauours done him, and faire and ample
promises, of f
                  •
               r greater future
blessings. If Esay beleeued, it was because hee saw him sitting in his
throne in great State and Maiestie,
                  Isay 6.
garded round about with Seraphins, which cryed, Holy, holy, holy is the
Lord of Hosts, the whole world is full of his glorie. If Moses
beleeued, it was because he beheld him in a flame of fire,
                  Exod. 5. out of  the midst
of a bush, seeing the bush burne with fire, and yet the bush not
consumed.
                  Mat. 17. If the three Disciples
beleeued, it was because they saw him transfigured in Mount Tabor, in that
glorious manner, That his face did shine as the Sunne, and his clothes were as
white as the light; whilest a bright cloud shadowing them, they might heare a
voyce from heauen, saying, This is that my beloued Son in whom I am well
pleased; not betweene two theeues, but betweene two Prophets. If Saint
Paul beleeued, it was because he had been rapt vp to the third heauen,
and had seene strange sights, &amp;c. If Nicodemus and
Nathaniel beleeued, if the woman of Canaan, and many others, they were
mooued thereunto by the Scriptures, and by our Sauiour Christs myracles. But
this Theefe neither saw him in his offered fauours, nor in his Throne of
Maiestie, nor in the firie bush, nor transfigured in the Mount, nor knew any
thing of the Scriptures, nor of his myracles; onely he knew that
Iudas had sold him, that his Disciples had forsaken him, and that he
was reuiled and hated of the people, &amp;c. Et tanquam in gloria adorat,
And yet hee adores him (saith Chrysostome) as if hee were
alreadie in glorie. Videt (saith S. Augustine) in cruce,
&amp; rogat quasi sedentem in coelis, Hee sees him hanging vpon the Crosse,
yet sues vnto him as if he were sitting in

                     •
                  eauen. Huic fidei, quid addi
possit, ignoro. What more may be added to this Faith, I know not. Those
were wauering in their faith, which saw him raise vp the dead; and yet this
Theefe firmely beleeues, who saw him hang vpon the Crosse. Leo and
Eusebius Emissenus, indeere this his beleefe. He did verily beleeue,
That our Sauiour Christ should rise againe; for hee would neuer haue made a
sute vnto him, whom he saw was a dying man, if he had thought there had been an
end of him. He assuredly did beleeue the immortalitie of the soule, and looked
after another life; being more carefull thereof, than his fellow-theefe, who
desired only this temporal life; saying vnto Christ, Salua temetipsum
&amp; nos, If thou be that Christ, saue thy selfe and vs. This our good
Theefe beleeued that which Christ spake before Pilat, My Kingdome is not of
this world: Quite contrarie to those Apostles of his, who stroue for
chaires of preheminence, one desiring to sit at his right hand, the other at
his left, supposing his Kingdome to bee a temporall Kingdome.
            
               No more was his Hope.Againe, His Hope
was no lesse great than his Faith, Quis credet ei, qui non habet nidum,
&amp;c. Who will ground the hopes of his happinesse vpon that man, that
hath not a house to put his head in, nor a bed to sleepe in? yet this Theefe
had set vp his rest vpon him that had no resting place. Great was the hope that
Daniel had in the Lyons Den, but he there saw that the Lions did lick
the shooes on his feet, like louing Curs. Great was Aminadabs
confidence, who was the first that aduentured to set vpon the sea, and to enter
the deepe; but he had seen great prodigies in Aegypt. Great was that assurance
of Dauids, when being beset round on al sides by Saul, his
souldiers said vnto him, Transmigra in montem, sicut passer. But he
answered, Ego dormiui &amp; somnū coepi, surrexi quia Dominus suscepit
me, they would haue had him flye like a bird vnto the hill; But hee told
them, That hee would lay him down,
                  Psal. 4.
and sleep in peace, for the Lord was his keeper, and would make him dwell in
safetie. He had such confidence in his God, that hee tooke no great care
concerning his enemies.
            Lastly, His Loue was no lesse great than his Hope, Loue
(saith Salomon) is as strong as death. But here Loue was much
more strong than death, for death was now scorned by Loue. They hung not him vp
vpon the Crosse for any loue that he bare to our Sauiour Christ; yet before he
dyed, he would haue giuen a thousand liues to haue purchased his loue, and it
was a greater griefe &amp; torment vnto  him, that he saw
he was not crucified for Christ, than the Crosse it selfe was vnto him. So that
beginning to suffer like a Theefe, hee became to dye like a Martyr.
            
               Hodie mecum eris in Paradiso.
               
                  To day shalt thou be with me in Paradise. Neuer did any
  former ages see a fauor comparable vnto this.
               First, in regard of that which heauen is in it selfe; being that
  next vnto the hypostaticall vnion, it is the greatest good that the
  omnipotencie of God can giue vs. All other good leaueth vs still hungry; this
  onely affoordeth fulnesse, I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall
  appeare. All doe seeke after heauen, and doe appetere Deum, as
  their vltimum bonum, Desire the fruition of God, as their chiefest
  felicitie. But because they neither know what God nor heauen is, they
  haue scarce peept in with their heads within the doores of that Supreame
  Princely Pallace, but that they are rauished with that strange and vnspeakeable
  admiration, that blessing themselues, they breake out in this manner; This
  surely is God.The glorie of the heauenly Paradise.
  Their weake apprehension not being able to conceiue the least glorie of that
  great Deitie, so that Esay might very well say, I am found of
  those that seeke not after me. The capacitie of our conceit, and the
  modell of our imagination, is but a thimblefull, in respect of that immense
  Ocean of Gods greatnesse. And therefore true is that saying, That the Iust doth
  finde that which hee doth not seeke for. And if the crummes which fall from
  that diuine Table, doe robbe a man of his vnderstanding, banish all other
  thoughts from him, and doe as it were alienate him from himselfe, how will he
  be transported, when he shall drinke at the fountaine of that riuer of
  delights, and when God shall say vnto him; Open thy mouth wide, and I w
                        •
                     ll fill it. So incomparable is the
  greatnes of this good, That God suffers himselfe to be rob'd by the labours
  and sweats of man. When we buy a thing dog-cheape, we vse to say it is stolne.
  Put in one scale, fastings, almes-deedes, sacke-cloth, and ashes, the torments
  of Martyrs, the troubles of Confessours; and in another scale, one houre, nay
  one minute of heauen, and in reason of buying and selling, heauen is robbed by
  vs. And hereunto doth allude that phrase in Scripture, Et violenti rapinus
  illud; And the violent take it by force. Now then, that after so many
  thefts, robberies, deaths, our Sauiour Christ should grant so great a good to
  this Theefe, a greater fauour cannot be imagined.
               Secondly, in regard of the aduantage he had of others. We know,
  that in glory, some shall enioy more, some lesse, As one starre d
                        •
                     ffers from another in brightnesse. All shall inioy
  eternal glorie, but not all the same degrees in glorie. But consider I pray
  you the great aduantage that this Theefe made; for he held it to bee a great
  happinesse vnto him, if God would be but pleased to afford him any the least
  corner of heauen. Abbot Arnaldo, a graue and antient,
  Authorhathaduentured to say, That God had giuen him the chaire wherein
  Lucifer sate. S. Cyprian saith, Quid tu Domine amplius
  Stephano contulisti? &amp;c. Oh Lord, what could that Protomartyr Saint
  Stephen inioy more, or that thy beloued Disciple which did leane his
  head in thy bosome? And (as Cirillus Ierosolimitanus saith) What could
  the long seruices of those that endured the heate of the day, obtaine more at
  Gods hands? But God makes thē this answer, I do not thee no wrong, didst
  thou agree with me for a pennie? Some labourers were working hard at the
  Vineyardfrom the first houre; others from the third houre; others began at the
  ninth houre; others whē the sunne was vpon setting. First came Adam,
  then Noah, after him Abraham, and the rest of the holy
  Prophets: but the Theefe came iust at the Sunne-setting.
               
                  Saint Chrysostome saith, That the
  same day that Adam was cast out of Paradise of the earth, the same day
  did this Theefe enter into the Paradise of heauen. The word Amen, or verely,
  doth imply as much. Aniently the Tribes were diuided &amp; set apart vpon two
  hils; the one breathing forth curses, Cursed is he that honoureth not his
  Father, Cursed is he that leadeth the blind out of the way: the other
  blessing; Blessed be thou in the Citie, blessed in the field, &amp;c.
  Onely the difference was in this, That to these their maledictions and
  cursings, they did euer say Amen. For (as it is in the Prouerbe) Para el
  mal sobraua pann̄, For ill, there was neuer yet cloth wanting; there was
  stuffe still enough ready at hand. But to their blessings, they answered with
  silence, reseruing their Amen, or, So be it, for the comming of our Sauiour
  Christ, from whom all our good was to come. And Theodoret giues vs
  this note withall, That those that silenced their Amen, were those that were to
  be fathers vnto Christ, according to the flesh.
               Fourthly, in regard that this fauour is made the greater by it's
  quick dispatch, Hodie mecum eris in Paradiso, To day shalt thou be with me
  in Paradise. Theophylact and Tigurino, read, Amen, dico tibi
  hodie, Making there the point. But this ought not to be receiued, as
  Cassianus prooueth it, but that this Hodie must goe hand in
  hand roundly along with Mecumeris. And Iustin Martyr saith,
  Iuxta fluenta plenissima, gratiam simul accepit &amp; gloriam, Grace and
  glorie with a full tyde, came flowing in both at once vpon him. S.
  Ambrose saith, That our Sauiour Christ made this exceeding great
  haste, Ne dilatione gratia minueretur, Lest the fauour he intended to do
  him, should be lessened by delay. This fauour farre exceeding all the rest
  in the world besides; As that of Alexander towards Perillus,
  demanding a dourie of him for his daughter; and that of the Gardiner, who had
  the Kingdome of Sidonia giuen him; or than that which Herod offered to
  his daughter Herodias, or Assuerus to Queene
  Hester,
                  
                     Mar 9. Ester
                     
                        •
                     . 
                  Si petieris dimidiam
  partem Regni mei, &amp;c. If thou shalt aske the one halfe of my Kingdome,
  &amp;c. And because Bis dat, qui citò dat, He doth a double
  curtesie that doth it quickly. Least delay might lessen the Doners
  bountie, Hee therefore saith, Hodie mecum eris, This very day shalt thou be
  with me, &amp;c. S. Ambrose saith, Quod magis ve
                        •
                     ox erat premium quam petitio, That the
  reward was quicker than the request. Seneca sayes, That hee that giues,
  must not giue slowly: for the willing mind wherewith it is done (being therein
  the most to be esteemed) it looseth much of it's estimation by it's slow
  proceeding. Leo the Pope saith, That it was a great fauour from
  Christ, to put this so humble and so discreet a petition into the Theeues
  heart; but a farre greater fauour to giue him such a good, and quicke dispatch.
  Ioseph foretelling Pharaohs seruant of his libertie, being
  then his fellow-prisoner, said vnto him, Memento mei, Haue me in
  remembrance with thee, when thou art in good case: But for all the others
  faire promises, he continued two yeares after in prison. But the Theefe had no
  sooner said Memento mei, but his Sauiour saw him dispatcht. O happy
  theefe, thou didst negotiate well, and with a good Iudge, that could dispatch
  thy businesse so quickly, and so well.
               Lastly, in regard of it's bountie and freenesse, the reward
  outvying the request; hauing more fauour done him than he desired.His reward exceeds our requests. 
                  Vberior (saith S.
  Ambrose) est gratia quam precatio. God hath vsed (and still
  doth) the like liberalitie towards many. Abraham desired a sonne to
  inherit his estate, and a sonne was giuen him, from whom God was to descend.
  Iacob beg'd Beniamin, and god gaue him both
  Beniamin and Ioseph. Tobias desired that he might see his
  son in safetie, God returneth him home vnto him sound, rich, and wel marryed.
  Iudith craued Bethulia's libertie, God gaue her that, and
  Holofernes head into the bargaine, and victory against
  Nebuchadnezzar. Anna prayed for a sonne, God gaue her one, that was a
  Saint, a  Prophet, &amp; Gods fauourite. Salomon
  desired wisedome to gouerne his kingdome the better, he had that and much more,
  besides infinite store of wealth bestowed vpon him. Ezechias sued vnto
  God for life, and whereas he would haue bin contented with two years holding
  of it, God granted him a lease of fifteen yeares to come. The seruant that owed
  10000 Talents, desired to be but forborn for a time, and the whole debt was
  forgiuen him. But God neuer dealt so franke and freely with any man, as with
  this theefe, for he but only intreating him to be mindful of him, he gaue him
  heauen, Qui merita supplicum excedis &amp; vota, sings the Church.
               
                  Theophylact saith, That your Kings, Princes, and great
  Captains, when they obtaine any notable victorie, they reserue the principal
  captiues for their Triumph: So Saul spared King Agag, and the
  best things: so the Emperors of Rome, Zenobia and others:
  Titus and Vespasian, most of the young men of Iudaea. But
  that our Sauiour Christ should enter in triumph into heauen with a theefe, it
  seemeth a thing of small glory to the Triumpher, and little honor for heauen.
  But Abbot Guericus answers hereunto, That it was a new and most noble
  kind of victorie, Nouum &amp; pulcherrimum genus victoriae. The kings
  of the earth get victories ouer their enemies, by treading them vnder, by
  kicking and spurning of them, by contemning and tormenting them, as appeareth
  by Histories both humane and diuine: This is a tyrannous kind of reuenge, and
  reuengefull cruelty. But that of the King of heauen is a noble reuenge, and a
  sweet victorie. The enemies of a king of this world will kisse the earth for
  feare; but those of the King of heauen, for loue. And therfore it is said,
  Inimici eius, terram lingent.
               
               Againe, S. August. saith, That Christ did inrich and
  illustrate heauen with the person of this theefe; so far was he from doing him
  any the least dishonor. For it is a great honour to heauen to haue such a Lord
  and Master, as shall make of great Theeues, great Saints. S. Chrysost.
  hath the same, and further addeth, That by seeing one raigne in heauen, who
  wanted earth to liue on; euery man may liue in hope to inioy the like
  happinesse: For it is not likely that he will be miserable to any, that was so
  liberall to a theefe.
               The Doctors do doubt whether this Theefe were a Martyr or no?
  For he that is a Martyr, it is not the greatnesse of the paine, but the
  goodnesse of the cause that makes him a Martyr. Achan was stoned to
  death, and Saint Stephen was stoned to death: But Achan was
  no Martyr, because he dyed deseruedly for his sins. The like reason you will
  say may be rendred of the theefe. But S. Ierome, Eusebius Nissenus,
  and S. Cyprian stile him Martyr; not because he suffered for Christ,
  though he suffered not without Christ; but because suffering with Christ, so
  great was the sorrow which he conceiued for his sinnes, that Christ taking this
  his torment to his account, as if he had suffered for his loue, made of the
  Crosse a Martyrdome. S. August. saith, That on the Crosse he
  acknowledged Christ, as if he had beene crucified for Christ. Eusebius
  Nissenus, That albeit he began with the punishment of a Delinquent, yet
  he ended with the glory of a Martyr. And S. Cyprian, That Christ did
  conuert the blood which he shed vpon the Crosse, into the water of baptisme,
  and that presently he placed him in Paradise.
               
                  Iustin Martyr and Irenaeus vnderstand here by
  Paradise, some other place of ioy; but rather earthly than heauenly.
  Irenaeus prooues it by the Priests of Asia. But it is most certain,
  That by Paradise is to be vnderstood, the blessed presence of our Sauiour Iesus
  Christ. And that he went from the Superficies of the earth, vp to that heauenly
  Pallace, &amp;c. To which God of his great goodnesse bring vs all, Amen.

                     IOH. 13.
                   
                  Sciens Iesus, quia venit hora eius.
               
            
            
               
                  OVr Sauiour Christ knowing that the houre was now come;
For which were reserued Gods greatest Grandezas, or Greatnesses. The
blessed Virgin called for wine at the wedding, but our Sauiour Christ answered,
My houre is not yet come. They carry him vp to the top of a mountaine,
thinking to throw him downe headlong from thence: but he told them, My
houre is not yet come. They goe forth to apprehend him, and yet, his
houre was not come. But now, Sciens, quia venit hora eius, When he
knew that his houre was come.
            
            There was not any thing in the world which he called his, but this
houre; and this he calleth his, because it was the houre of our good and
happinesse. The houres of his honor,Christ neuer counted any
  thing his, but our happines. when the Magi bowing to the
ground, did adore him; when he entred in Triumph into Ierusalem, drawing all
the Citie after him; when he shewed himselfe so glorious in Mount Tabor; when
the temptation in the desart being ended, the Angels came to serue him; when
all the creatures were obedient to his Empire: All these houres were as
strangers vnto him, he did not reckon them as his; but that houre wherein he
was betrayed, tormented, and crucified for mankind, This houre (he saith) is my
houre. Exinaniuit semetipsum, formam serui accipiens. Thomas saith,
That all the seruant get's, is his Lords, as the fruits of the garden, and of
the trees, &amp;c. And he made himselfe a seruant, that he might make vs
Lords.
                  Esay 55. 
               Ho, euery one that
thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and ye that haue no siluer, come buy and
eate: Come 
                     •
                  say, buy wine and milke
without siluer, and without money. Saint Bernard askes the
question, How a man can buy without a price, or sell without money? And his
answer is, That in buying and selling betwixt man and man, there must of force
some bargaine be driuen, some price proposed; but with God it is not so, for,
all that which we can buy, is from God. In the world, he that buyes, remaines
with that which he buyes, and hee that sells, with the price thereof. God sells
heauen vnto vs for our fastings, our prayers, and our teares; and heauen, and
the price thereof, remaines at home within our selues, and in our owne keeping.
And this is, Hora eius, His houre.
            
            In the Creation, God had his owne houres, and our houres; Houres
for himselfe,  and houres for vs: But the world being
created and fully finished, he gaue vs all the houres appertaining to Time,
Et requieuit ab vniuerso opere, quod patraret,
               
                  Gen. 2. 
               He rested from all his worke which he
had made. Rupertus saith, That when the Scripture maketh mention, That
God walked vp and downe in Paradise; it speakes of God after the manner of man,
who when he hath ended all his businesses, sits him downe to eate, takes his
rest, and gets him afterwards out to walke in his garden, there to take his
pleasures as one that hath now nothing else to do. So that when God was al
alone, he had some houres of his own; but after that he had once made himselfe
man, all those houres, were made ours. In token that he who beareth on his
shoulders the burthen of a Common-wealth, ought not to account so much as an
houre to be his, but that they are al allotted for other men. Those that now
adayes gouerne the world, make many houres their owne; They must haue their
houre to eate, their houre to sleepe, their houre to talke, their houre to
play, their houre to walke, making their gouernment a matter of recreation,
casting all care behind their backe, and neuer so much as once thinking of
their obligation. And whereas they should be in continuall occupation, vsing
their recreations sparingly; they change lots, as if gouernment were conferred
vpon them, to sit still and doe nothing, at least to follow their pleasures and
delights, whence great hurt doth accrue to themselues and others.
            To themselues, because God will not call them to account for those
houres, wherein they did not game, walke, &amp;c. but for those, wherein they
did not dispatch businesses.
            To others, because thou art not thine owne man, but art to spend
thy time for the good of those that God hath committed to thy care, to receiue
their informations, to peruse their petitions, and to giue a speedie dispatch
to their iust pretensions. For what hurt they receiue through thy default, it
is put to thy account.
            Saint Bernard saith, That such Offices and places as
these, are not for weake men, effeminate persons, and such as are giuen to
sports and pasttimes; the weight of this charge is great, and therefore had
need of a strong backe, or the shoulders of an Atlas. It being so, How
comes it then to passe, that so many doe desire and hunt so earnestly after
these great places? My answer is, because they looke not vpon the weight and
perill thereof, but the pompe and estimation that waits vpon them. Saint
Augustine saith, That if worldly honours bee taken for ease, there is
nothing more sweet, nothing more pleasing, But with God, nothing more
miserable, more wretched, or more damnable.
            
            
               Now when Iesus knew that his houre was come that he should
depart out of this world, vnto the father, for as much as he loued his owne
that were in the world,
               No loue like to that of our
  Sauiour towards vs. 
               [vnto the end he loued them.] So farre was
Christ from repenting himselfe of his loue towards his, that he gaue them all
possible pledges of this his loue. Great is the loue and affection that a
Theefe hath to theeuing, insomuch, that though he know he shall be hanged the
next morning, yet he takes pleasure in robbing. A fine delicate louer is he,
who knowing that to morrow he shall loose his life for his loue, lasheth out
into greater extreames of loue than before. Many at their first entrance into
loue, promise many sweet contentments to themselues, who if they had but
thought what sower sauce they should haue to this their sweet meat, they would
neuer haue made loue. But our Sauiour Christ saw his death before his eyes, and
yet that he might perfect his loue when his houre was come, he shewed more and
more loue still. Saint Augustine saith, That hee tooke flesh in the
Virgins wombe, that he might receiue limbs and members from thence, to deliuer
 them vp to the crueltie of the Crosse: As a head, to
haue it crowned with thornes, a face to be spit vpon and buffeted, a mouth to
be distasted with vinegre and gall, hands and feet to be bored and nayled, a
side to bee pierced. And though hee knew that this his loue to mankind, was to
bring all this torment and miserie vpon his sacred person, In finem dilexit
eos, Vnto the end hee loued them.
            
            The neerer his death grew, the greater grew his loue. That
comparison of the riuer is not much amisse, which takes it's head or beginning
from a small fountaine, and by little and little goes increasing, till in the
end it seemes to be a Sea. We cannot say that there was any thing little or
small in our Sauiour Christ: but in some sort, taking from his infancie, it may
comparitiuely bee thus vnderstood, His loue was little at the first, it began
to purle forth in those his teares in the cratch; it went on, drawing more
water in his Circumcision; in his exile into Aegypt, in his fastings, prayers,
penitences, sermons, myracles, and when hee came to wash his Disciples feet,
and to giue vnto them his body and blood, then was it full sea with him. The
Iewes did put this question, How can this man giue vs his flesh to be
eaten? Saint Augustine tells vs, I will tell you how; In the
beginning was Loue, &amp; that Loue was with God, &amp; God was that Loue; and
this may serue as an answer to all questions that may be demanded in this kind.
And as in all other things from his childhood, he went (to our seeming) growing
vp still more and more; so did his loue likewise goe dayly increasing, euen to
the houre of his death, shewing that he loued vs vnto the end. When a mountaine
takes fire, at first the fire is but small, but by degrees growes greater and
greater, till it comes at last like another Aetna to be a mountaine of fire.
Ieremy saith, That he saw a seething pot, The pot by little and little
comes to take heat, till at last it falls a boyling, but the fire vnder it may
be so great, that it may bubble and runne ouer, throwing out all that is within
it. In our Sauiour Christs breast, the fire of his loue did alwayes seeth and
boyle apace, but in the end this fire grew to so great a flame, that it threw
out that his flesh, and made that his blood to ouerflow which was knit to his
soule, and Diuinitie. That man which Ezechiel saw in the first chapter
of his Prophesie, one with his feet standing vpon a Saphyre, who was all fire;
but from the head to the girdle, the fire was secret and hidden; but from the
girdle downward, euen to the very feet, all was on a bright flame. His feet
stood vpon a Saphyre, which is the colour of heauen, to shew vnto vs the
blessednesse which he did inioy from the very instant of his conception, as
also to signifie vnto vs, that all the life of our Sauiour Christ, was a
flaming fire of Loue. But in those his younger yeares, it was for a while as it
were smothered and repressed, but afterwards brake forth into those flames,
that when his houre was come, and that he was to dye, Those whom he loued,
he loued vnto the end. Some haue sayled ouer the whole Mediterranean, haue
toucht vpon the coasts thereof, and entred vp into it's riuers; Others haue
past the Streight, and arriued at the Cape de buena Esperance, of good
Hope. There was a man that rounded all the world, as if he had stood in
competition with the Sunne; but for all this, his Nauagation was not at an
end. Euery day more countries are discouered: but in the sea of Loue there is
not that place, which the Ship of the Crosse hath not sayled into, Omnis
consumptionis vidit finem, &amp; in finem dilexit eos, He saw the end of all
consumption, and loued them vnto the end.
            
            
               Three kinds of
  friendship.
               Aristotle sets downe in his Ethicks three kinds of
friendships.
            
               Honestum, Vtile, Iucundum. That is, grounded on Honestie,
Profit, and Pleasure.
            That which is grounded vpon profit, will cease, when that ceaseth:
Thou hast a  friend, that furnisheth thee with moneyes;
no longer furnish thee, no longer a friend: So sayes Seneca in an
epistle of his to Lucilius.
            
            That which is founded vpon pleasure and delight, liues or dyes, as
those delights liue or dye in vs.
            But that which makes Honestie it's ayme, that endureth for
euer.
            My friend (saith Seneca) I ought to loue him so well, as
to follow him in his banishment, to releeue him in his necessities, and if need
were to dye for him. Saint Augustine saith, that Seneca liued
in the time of the Apostles, and that it is very probable, that he had some
communication with Saint Paul, and that the Apostle related vnto him
what our Sauiour Christ did for his, That he accompanied them in their
banishment, inricht them with the riches of heauen, and in the end layd downe
his life for them. This is that, In finem dilexit eos, He loued them to the
end.
            
            A great loue can neuer indure a long absence. Theodoret
saith, That Saint Peter hauing heard from Christs owne mouth, a
Ter me negabis, Thou shalt denie mee thrice, He would faine haue fled
many Leagues from that occasion; but that his loue was so great, that he held
it a lesse ill to denie him, by following him, than to confesse him by flying
from him. He tooke so much pleasure in his presence, that he chose rather to
hazard the losse of his soule, than of his beloued sight: Holding it a lesse
vnhappinesse to denie, than not to be in the eye of him, whom he loued so
dearely. Saint Bernard treating of that petition which Moses
made vnto God, Either blot me out of the booke of life, or spare this
people, giues vs this note out of that place; That so great was the loue
which the Prophet bare to that people, that albeit God did offer him to be
chiefe Gouernour ouer a farre better and greater people, yet could he not
endure to be diuorced from them, nor to absent himselfe from their companie,
and therefore made choise rather of this so sad and grieuous a resolution,
Aut dele me de libro vitae, &amp;c. ô Lord either pardon them,
or condemne me: My loue towards them can better abide death, and hel, than
their absence. Plut. saith, That Loue is like Iuie, which if it cleaue
but to a stone, or an old wall, will rather dye than forsake it. Christ said
vnto his Disciples, Vnlesse I goe hence, the comforter will not come vnto
you: All their felicitie consisting in the comming of the Holy Ghost; But
I goe to prouide a place for you. Nobody but I, can open the gates of
heauen vnto you. Our Sauiour said, Lift vp your gates ô ye Princes,
&amp;c. Where S. Chrysostome obserueth, That it had beene
sufficient, had he but onely said, Open the gates. But he did not say,
Open, but, take the gates away, heaue them off the hookes. For heauen,
that is neuer shut against any, hath no need of gates. His Disciples might haue
said vnto him; Lord, since we shall receiue so great a good by thy departure;
Fuge, assimulare Caprae, hinnuloque ceruorum. Yet so great was their
loue vnto him, that with teares in their eyes, they desired rather their owne
hinderance, than his absence. Many nations of the world made their gods
prisoners, chaining them fast with strong yrons; For, in seeing themselues to
bee forsaken by them, they presently accounted themselues but dead men.
Pausanias reporteth, that the Lacedaemonians had tyed fast the Statue
of Mars with cords of silke. And Alexander ab Alexandro
saith, That Hercules was bound fast with fetters of gold. And
Plutarch in his Problemes, recounteth the like of Apollos
Image. And the sacred Scripture deliuers vnto vs, That Micas the
Idolater followed with teares in his eyes, those theeues which had stolne away
the Idols belonging to his house, or his houshold gods. And Laban vpon
the like occasion, pursued Iacob. For it is impossible, that any bodie
should suffer or endure the absence of his God. Two powerfull Loues therefore 
 wrestling and strugling in the breast of our Sauiour
Christ: The one, to returne to his father from whence he came; The other, not
to depart from his Spouse here on earth; his Loue did lay a plot how he might
goe away, and yet stay. And this was the vpshot of his Loue.
            
               When the diuell had now put in the heart of Iudas,
&amp;c. It is noted by Saint Iohn, That at the same time as our
Sauiour Christ was busied about the performing a point of that so meeke and
lowly a humilitie, as his washing of his Disciples feet, and communicating vnto
them his body and blood; the very same time did the diuell enter into
Iudas his breast. Saint Chrysostome addeth, Admirans,
dixit; That the Euangelist spake this, as it were in the way of admiration; Cum
diabolus misisset in cor, When the diuell had put it in his heart,
&amp;c. Our thoughts are like grauell stones got into the shoo, which
Satan puts into mans heart, and made such hast to thrust them into
Iudas his heart, that he was much perplexed and troubled therewith
some few dayes: but the batterie continuing, he fell at last to a finall
resolution, and when he was resolued what he would doe, himselfe made the
offers of selling our Sauiour Christ. Quid vultis mihi dare? What will you
giue me? In which sale of his, two notable follies are to be noted.
            The one, His selling of his Sauiour vpon trust. S. Marke
and S. Luke say, They promised to giue him money.
            
            The other, His selling of him at so low a rate, standing to their
curtesie what they would giue him. The diuell offered our Sauior Christ all the
whole world. But Iudas was so base, That he went away well contented
with three Blanks, being willing to play at small game rather than to sit out.
For he that is a couetous wretch, euen with the diuell himselfe looseth his
credit. And therefore the Church stiles him a very Pedlar, the basest and worst
of merchants. Iudas mercator pessimus. Saint Gregorie saith,
That Iudas did banish from the world three things of great price and
value.
            The one, True Loue: For euer since that false and treacherous
kisse of Iudas, mens affections haue likewise growne to be false,Iudas banished out of the world all Vert
                     ••
                  , Loue, and Feare. and loue to be counterfeit and
feigned, vsing strange disguises. Many imbracing those in their armes, whose
throats they cut in their hearts.
            The other, Vertue: For hypocrisie puts on a shew of Sanctitie,
maskes her selfe with Holinesse, and dissembles good desires.
            The third, Feare: For he that is nor afraid to betray God, What
will he stand in feare of?
            
               Gregorie Nazianzen saith, That in selling our Sauiour
Christ, hee lost all the right and claime that he had to his blood: for no man
can challenge any right to that which he sells; so that he did vtterly renounce
all kind of remedie, or anie soule comfort whatsoeuer.
            Saint Bernard saith, That by committing treason against
the Lord both of heauen and earth, he had so highly offended therein, that
neither of them, would giue him any reception or entertainement at his death;
onely, hauing hanged himselfe, the Element of the Ayre kept him tottering
there to his further disgrace.
            
               When the diuell had put it in his heart. There are some
sinnes so foule, and so enormious, that for to cease vpon them, a man had need
to haue Iudas his heart, and the diuells hands. He that is weake and
fraile, may sinne out of a naturall inclination, or some long continued
custome, and euery occasion will be sufficient to make him flye after his game,
as the Hawke doth after hir prey, &amp;c. But to doe ill to him that doth vs
good, we had need of the helpe of a Iudas, or a diuell. 
 
               Ioseph being woed by his wanton Mistrisse told
her, Quo modo potero. Being bound vnto my Master with so many chaines
of his loue and kindnesses towards mee, How can I doe him so great a wrong?
Saul was much more beholding to Dauid, than Ioseph
to Pataphar, yet the diuell tooke strong hold of him, Spiritus
Domini malus vrgebat Saul. But let no temptation take hold on you, but
that which is humane.
            
               He layeth aside his vpper garments. S. Ierom in
his Epistle to Celancia, saith, Nihil est imperiosius amore,
There is nothing of more power and command, than loue.Loue
  triumphed euen ouer God himselfe. Gen. 41.44.
               Pharaoh leauing ouer the gouernment of Aegypt vnto Ioseph,
said vnto him, Without thee shall no man lift vp his hand, or his foot in
all the land of Aegypt. It may seem that God said the like to Loue, who
drew God downe from heauen to liue here vpon earth? It was Loue, who led him
along through the streetes to Mount Caluarie, triumphing there ouer his power:
It was Loue, and onely loue. O Loue, if thou be so imperious, as to triumph
ouer God himselfe, Who shall bee able to resist thee? Absque tuo imperio,
&amp;c. Without this Loue, we can neither stirre hand nor foot, no not
breath, or liue one houre.
            
               He layeth aside his garment. Well did he repay that kind
loue of theirs, in casting their clokes before his feet, when he road in
Triumph through Ierusalem, carrying palmes in their hands. And he in stead of
washing the palmes of their hands, disdained not to stoope so low as to wash
their feet. Saint Bernard saith, That the Spouse did complaine, that
the Gards of the Citie had taken her cloake away, Tollerunt pallium
meum: Do not ye therefore complaine if ye bee stripped starke naked for
Gods sake, since he was pleased to lay aside his garments to doe you
seruice.
            
               He began to wash the Disciples feet. He had said
before,No humilitie like our Sauiours. 
               Knowing
that the Father had giuen all things into his hands. And Hilarie
addeth, Etiam proditorem. So that God hauing put Christ into
Iudas hands, Christ puts himselfe vnder Iudas his feet. O
Iudas (saith he) though thou hast giuen thy heart vnto the diuell, yet
I pray thee giue me thy feet, that I may bath them with the tears of mine eyes,
Thou hast put all things vnder his feet, The birds of the ayre, the
beasts of the field, and the fishes of the sea. This is much: But if God should
haue reuealed vnto thee, that thou shouldst see his sonne washing
Iudas his feet, &amp;c. And there appeared a great wonder in
heauen, a woman cloathed with the Sunne, and the Moone was vnder her feet.
Heauen being to cloth her, what could it cloth her better withall, than with
the Sun and the Moone? But a greater wonder is it, to see the Son of heauen
vnder Iudas his feet. O heauens, are ye not ashamed to see those
hands which created you, which did border you about with light, as with a rich
imbroyderie, to be soiled with the foulenesse of such feet? For to looke her
lost groat, the good wife swept her house ouer and ouer, turning and sifting
this and that other heape of dust, leauing no corner vnsearcht, till she had
found it. God hath two houses:God hath two
  houses.
            
            The Church Triumphant,
            The Church Militant.
            He did turne the first vpside downe, when he kneeled on his knees
to wash Iudas feet. Saint Ierome saith, Quantumcunque te
humilies, humilior Christo non eris, Be thou neuer so humble, Christ will be
more humble then thou canst be. For hee will put himselfe vnder thy feet,
As he did here stoupe to Iudas.
            
            O Lord, for so forlorne a soule, which must be lost at last, so
much paines for so little profit, so much lost labour for one that is lost.
            First of all, a Fathers care ouer his sicke sonne, to whom hee
beareth loue, is farre different from that which the Physition takes, who onely
cures him  for his owne priuat profit and particular
interest.
            Secondly, Because Loue can neuer bee subdued; where it findes one
lost, it thinkes all lost. At the Wedding there was but one found vnfitted for
his garment, Yet this inference was made vpon it, Many are called, but few
are chosen. Saint Augustine saith, That one is a great losse,
where there is great Loue: and with the losse of Iudas, Loue was so
much agrieued, that Saint Ambrose saith, That the freeing of the
Theefe out of the Deuills hands, was done in reuenge of the losse of
Iudas. The Deuill was much ioyed that he had robbed our Sauiour of
such a friend, as one of the Twelue; but he had beene as good let him alone,
for he lost a Theefe when he was vpon the Gallowes, and thought he was sure
then his owne. Plus amisisti, quam rapuisti, Thou lost more than thou
gotst; thou robst God of a Theefe, that had beene thine but a few days;
and he robbed thee of another theefe, which had beene thine for many
yeares.
            
               He began to wash, &amp;c. Being to bestow vpon them his
bodie and bloud, hee thought fit first of all to begin with the making cleane
of their feet, by which the Scripture vnderstands, our defects and foulenesse
of our affections, in token of that disposition and preparation wherewith we
are to come to the receiuing of so diuine a Sacrament. All the whole life of
our Sauiour Christ was a patterne of pouertie, and that in the highest degree.
The portall wherein hee was borne, was hung with Cobwebs in stead of Tapistrie;
the Cratch and a locke of Hay, were the sheet and pillow to his cradle; al the
whole space of his life, he had not a place where to leane and rest his head:
his death was vpon Mount Caluarie, a place full of dead mens sculls and bones,
whose bodies had suffered by the sword of Iustice. But for the institution of
this diuine Sacrament, he had made choice of a goodly large Hall, well
furnished, and handsomely set forth; and for the consecration of the Wine, a
Cup made (as some thinke) of a costly Agat, which is offered to be seene in the
Asseo of Valencia.
            First, to signifie vnto vs, That gold, siluer, and pretious
stones, are on nothing so well bestowed as on the seruice of God.
            Secondly, That he that sits downe at this sacred Table, must come
accompanied with great riches of vertue,The holy Sacrament
  not to be receiued, but with a great deale of preparation. and great
purenesse of conscience. To your great and solemne banquets, those that are
inuited come thither in a sumptuous and gallant kind of manner, your Romans did
cloath themselues all in white, for they held such an inuitation

                  •
               o sacred a thing, that it was held
a great shame and infamie to any that should fully the same with any kind of
deceit or treason. The Gospell condemned him that came vnto the marriage
without his wedding garment. Saint Cyprian saith, That we ought to
please those Diuine eyes, euen with our outward habit. Saint Hierome
tells vs, That when he had dreamed in the night any dishonest dream, he did
tremble &amp; quake for feare when he entred into Gods House.
Abulensis reporteth, That the cause of Oza's death was, for
that hauing laien that night with his wife, he presumed to touch the Arke. The
Libertine Councell doth admonish vs, That they who are to communicate, ought
to abstaine eight dayes from conuersation with women. The same aduice is giuen
vs by Saint Augustine and Saint Hierome: and it is a strange
Doctrine to my seeming,No preparation sufficient for the
  Holy Supper. That he that is to say Masse euerie morning, should spend
the nights with his she-friend, Let euerie man first trie and examine
himselfe, and then let him so eat of this bread, and drinke of this Cup,
&amp;c. so that a man either must examine himselfe, or must not; If he
must let him weigh his worthines and vnworthines; if he shall find himselfe
vnworthie, he must rather excommunicate &amp; remoue himselfe from the
Altar. Saint Augustine saith, That one of the mainest reasons why
our Sauiour  Christ at his last supper, possessed with
such perturbation the brests of his Disciples, telling them, That he that dipt
his finger with him in the dish should sell the Sonne of Man and betray him,
was, That euery one might be affraid of himselfe, and might say not without
some suspition and iealousie, What Master is it I? For there is no man
so Holy, no man so Pure and free from sinne, but it will well beseeme him to
come wi
                  •
               h a great deale of respect
and reuerence, and a due examination of himselfe to this coelestiall Table.
Iob when he sat downe at the table vsed to fetch a sigh, Antequam
comedam suspiro. Dauid did moysten with his teares the bread which he did
eat. Did these good men hold themselues vnworthy of that materiall bread; What
ought we to doe, when wee come to the receiuing of this diuine Bread?
Dionisius, de Ecclesiastica Hierarchia; Clemens Romanus in his
Apostolicall Constitutions; Hilary, Theodoret, Datianus Alexandrinus,
hold (contrary to the opinion of the Saints) that Iudas did not then
and there communicate with the rest.
            
               He came then to Simon Peter.
               Saint Austen sayth, That Saint Peter first
  brake the yce, saying, Washest thou my feet? O Lord, in thy
  transfiguration,Christs Humilitie, the character of his
 Loue. the resplendor of thy Glory did throw mee downe at thy feet, and
  shall I then suffer thee to throw thy selfe downe at my feet? Heauen did
  reueale vnto mee that noble confession which I made, Thou art the Christ,
  the Sonne of the liuing God: Sithence then, that I haue confessed and
  acknowledged thee to bee the Sonne of God, shall I permit to see my Sauiour
  humble himselfe at my feet? Clemens Romanus a Disciple of Saint
  Peter, reporteth in his Apostolicall Constitutions, That as often as
  Saint Peter did call this action of his to mind, so often did he shed
  teares, to see Christ at his feet: whence wee are to weigh and consider the
  great modestie of Saint Peter, who was not so much astonished to see
  Iesus Christ at the feet of Iudas, as to see him at his own feet. All
  the complements which Peter vsed with our Sauiour Christ, are worthy
  commendation, full of discretion, reuerence, and loue: Onely his default was,
  That hee would striue and contest with our Sauiour Christ, for want of true
  knowledge of those ends, whereunto Christs actions were directed. So that if
  mannerlinesse may bee a fault in any man▪ it was now in Peter,
  for refusing to haue his feet washt; the mysterie whereof had he but knowne, he
  would not haue made so nice a matter of it.
               Saint Cyrill treating of the ends of this act of our
  Sauiors, saith, That he desired by all means possible to ingraft Loue in Mans
  brest; &amp; to giue vs to vnderstand, That without great humilitie, there can
  be no great Loue. Guarricus saith, That our Sauior Christ did loue man
  so wel, yea, &amp; in such a maner of fashion, that he resolued with himself to
  iumpe &amp; agree with him, &amp; to shape himself according to his humour, and
  to doe any thing whatsoeuer, though neuer so meane, so as it might make for his
  good. And when he saw that Man was so proud, that he would not submit himselfe
  to serue him, he sayd, Well, seeing Man will not be brought to serue mee, I
  will submit my selfe to serue him, &amp; stoupe to so low and so base a
  seruice, as to wash his feet. This made him dye betweene two Theeues▪
                  Our Sauiours art in gaining of wretched Man. He was wel
  content at his death, to want al other comforts the world could affoord him,
  only he could not be drawne from mans side; that would haue gone to the very
  heart of him. Thou art faire (my beloued) and comely. S. Bernard
  sayth, That this repetition doth point out a two-fold beautie vnto vs.
               The one of his Diuinitie, wherewith he doth beautifie &amp;
  deifie the Angels, and the Saints.
               
                  The other of his Loue, which made him
  debase himselfe so much, as to wash his Disciples feet.
               The first, is of greater admiration.
               The second, of much more consolation.
               
                  Ibi pietas magis emicuit, vbi charitas magis refulsit, There
  Pietie did glitter most, where Charitie shined most.
               
               Some man may aske me the question, Why the rest did not seeke to
  excuse themselues.
               I answer, That this courtesie being complemented and pleaded by
  Peter, and consented vnto by Peter, the rest had nothing more
  to doe, or say therein.
               
                  If I shall not wash thee, &amp;c. Laurentius
  Iustinianus saith, That the good old man was somewhat daunted with this
  threatning, and now yeelded and submitted himselfe in such sort, that whereas
  before he had, being intreated, denyed to haue his feet washt; being thus
  threatned by our Sauiour, he now offers to haue both his feet and his head
  washt. O Lord wash the whole man in vs with thy blood, that we may appeare
  cleere in thy sight, &amp;c.
            
         
         
            THE XLII. SERMON. Of our Sauiour Christs death.
            
               
                  IOH. 19. 
                  
                     Baiulans sibi Crucem, &amp;c.
                   
                  Bearing his Crosse, &amp;c.
               
            
            
               Affliction alters the verie forme of
  Man.
               WHat with the spittle, stripes, blowes, buffets, mockes, scornes,
scourges, thornes, his beard and haires clotted with blood; our Sauiour Christ
was so much altered from that man which the Spouse paints him foorth to be
[Candidus, rubicundus,
               
                  Cant. 5.
               electus ex millibus, My wellbeloued is white, and ruddy, the chiefest of
ten thousand] that Ieremie could say,
                  Hier. 29. 
               He is a man, yet who can know
him.
               
                  Esay. 43. And Esay, He had
neither shape nor comelinesse. Or as another letter hath it, He had
not the forme of a man. And he himselfe did not thinke himselfe to be a
man,
                  Psal. 21. saying; I am a worme and
no man. And it seeming vnto Pilat to be the lesser reuenge of
the two, to see him dead, than to bee thus wounded and torne by them; and that
there could be no emnitie, no malice,  so raging and so cruell,
which with so sad a spectacle, and so woful a sight, would not loose somewhat
of i'ts fiercenesse and violence; leaning himselfe against the window, and
looking wistly vpon him, he breathed forth these two words; Ecce homo.
Behold here a Man (sayth S. Austen) fitter for the graue than a
throne; yee did heretofore enuie him for the great applause which the world
gaue vnto his Miracles, but now his Miserie may blot that out of your
brests.
            First, I would haue yeto consider, what manner of thing Man was
when hee was moulded by the hands of God in the Creation; how rich, how wise,
and how perfect a creature he was. In his Incarnation, in what a prosperous
estate did he liue, how mightily enuied by Hell? In the Resurrection, how
glorious, and how immortall? And how God againe by the hands of Man, is mocked,
scourged, spit vpon, and contemned.
            Secondly, if a Pilat taking pittie of our Sauiour Christ,
could say vnto the people, Ecce homo, Behold the Man! for to mooue
them vnto p
                  •
               ttie: it is not much
that a Preacher of the Gospell, whose dutie it is to preach Christ crucified,
should say vnto Christian people, Ecce homo, Behold the Man. No man
will trust the pittie and compassion of an enemy. Saul remained much
amazed and confounded, when Dauid stole from his beds-head his speare
and his pitcher; and when in the caue he had cut off the lappet of his garment;
and with tear did propound and promise to himselfe to loue him and fauour him
all his life long: yet Dauid would not beleeue him, because no man
that is w
                  •
               se will trust an enemie.
Ionas who was a figure of our Sauiour Christ, beeing ouerwhelmed in
the Sea, the waues thereof did assuage their rage &amp; waxed calme: But our
Sauior Christ, being ouerwhelmed in the Sea oft hese his torments, hee couldnot
allay the furie of those billowes which grew stil rougher and rougher in the
turbulent breasts of his people; for there was but little good to be expected
from so professed an enemie: yet hee that is a Christian hath our Sauiour
Christ to bee his Friend, his Lord, his Father, and his God. And representing
himselfe vnto vs in this pitifull and lamentable manner, what heart is there so
hard, which will not bee mooued to commiserate so wretched a case? Saint
Paul had made vnto those of Galilee a discription of our Sauiour
Christ vpon the Crosse; and it seeming vnto him, that they were not mooued
thereat, but that their hearts were hardned, he cry'd out aloud vnto them,
O yee foolish and senselesse Galathians, who hath bewiched you? Is it
possible that Christ crucified should not make your hearts to melt within yee?
This is a meere stupidnesse and insensibilitie.
            
               Behold the Man.
               If it will not moue vs to behold him thus tormented as a
  Man,Ch

                     ation. let it greeue vs at least
  to see God suffer so much miserie for Man. Vidimus eum (sayth
  Esay) quasi percussum à Deo (quasi percussum Deum) For
  so Saint Chrysostome renders it. Beatus, qui intelligit super
  egenum &amp; pauperem. Happie is hee who vnder the humanitie of man, will
  find out the humanity of God. Lindanus commenting vpon this verse,
  saith, That the word Super in the Hebrew, with it's points or prickes,
  signifieth God: So that in the first sence, it may be sayd, Beatus qui
  intelligit Deum, egenum &amp; pauperem. Blessed be those eyes, that vnder
  so many miseries, behold Gods greatnesse. Zacharias doth paint out
  Iesus the Priest with loathsome and vnseemely garments, and that a stone with
  seuen eyes stood looking vpon him. Can the stones find eyes to see God whipt,
  spit vpon, &amp; crowned with thornes? And shall man bee so blind as not to
  behold him? Saint Luke titles Christ, 
                  mortem, &amp; spectaculum. Men see many things with admiration, but
  they see not the Angells: and many see the Angels, but they see not God. But
  our Sauiour Christ torne and tormented on the Crosse; Men, Angells, and God,
  may behold this with admiration (if it were possible that God could be subiect
  to admiration) but men are apt to be taken therewith. The Angells also did
  admire the ensignes of the Crosse. And to God, the Sonne said; My God, my
  God, looke vpon me. In a word, if there be any thing that may cause a
  generall astonishment, and admiration in all creatures whatsoeuer, it is our
  Sauiour Christ crucified. The flood was a cause of great amasement, beholding
  the waters, the heauens, and the dead bodies. The burning of Sodom, and the
  swallowing vp of Dathan, were things to be admired: but to see Christ
  so cruelly tormented as he was, and Pilat in pittie of him, leaning
  himselfe in the window, and saying, Ecce homo, doth drowne all other
  kinds of astonishment and admiration.
            
            
               Et baiulans fibi crucem.
               
                  And taking vp his Crosse. When Pilat did looke
  that the Iewes would haue rested satisfied and well contented, then did they
  cry out louder than before, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him,
  crucifie him. And being ouercome by the confused noyse of that rascall
  
                     •
                  abble, going from the window vp
  vnto his Throne, which the Euangelist cals Lithostratos, a place paued
  with square stones, pronouncing sentence against him, hee condemned him to the
  death of the Crosse. Saint Chrysostome saith, Senten
                        •
                     iam non tulit, sed tradendo eum,
  permisit illos sua vti tyrannide, That he did not pronounce sentence against
  him, but by deliuering him vp into their hands, he permitted them to vse their
  owne Tyrannie, Hee deliuered him vnto them to doe what they would with
  him. But the more probabilitie is, that he pronounced sentence against him.
               
                  
                     Iob. 1
                        •
                     .First, because Saint Iohn saith, He
  sat downe in the iudgement seat: There being no need of his sitting downe,
  had he not beene to pronounce sentence. G
                        •
                     llius, Vlpianus, and Plinie report, That with the
  Roman Iudges, it was so inuiolable a custome to sit downe when they pronounced
  sentence, that they accounted that for no sentence, which was pronounced
  standing: In token, that any sentence either ciuill or criminall, ought to
  proceede from a well setled mind, and a stayed iudgment.
               Secondly, Saint Luke saith, Pilat gaue sentence,
  That it should be as they required. Where we are to weigh the word,
                     Luke 23. 
                  Adiudicauit, Gaue sentence.
               
               Thirdly, The Iewes had alledged for themselues, It is not
  lawfull for vs to put any man to death.
                  Pilat
 pronounced the sentence of death against Christ. Which is to bee
  vnderstood (as the Cardinall of Toledo prooues it) Vnlesse the sentence of
  the Iudge doe precede, and goe before; and then they may.
               The Tenor or substance of that which Pilat pronounced,
  your graue Doctors deliuer the same in different words, but the summe of it is
  this. 
  We Pontius Pilat by the will of the immortall gods,
 and by the authoritie of Roman Princes, being President of this sacred Empire,
 condemne vnto death, Iesus of Nazareth, for hauing made himselfe King of the
 Iewes, as appeareth by the testimonie of the High Priests of Ierusalem.
 Wherefore we will and command, that he be carryed from this place, forth of
 the Citie, to the place of Execution, commonly called Golgotha, and there to be
 crucified betweene two theeues, Dismas and Gismas, here
 conuicted and condemned for their thefts and robberies, to the end that this
 his death may make for the good and safetie of this people, and for the
 peaceablenesse of this Common wealth. Dated in Ierusalem, in Lithostratos,
 vulgarly  cald the Pauement, Pasquo parasceuae,
 or Preparation of the Passeouer, about the sixt houre.
               
               No age, euer knew a more cowardly Iudge, or a more vniust
  sentence.Pilat a cowardly Iudge.
               
               First, because hauing said in publike, Ego nullam in eo
  inuenio causam, I find no cause of death in him: and thereupon, washing
  his hands before the multitude, he made protestation, That he was innocent of
  the blood of this iust man: God not suffering him to haue a mouth to say the
  contrarie.
               Secondly, because the innocencie of our Sauiour Christ, was
  notorious; not onely because all the Prophets had giuen sufficient testimonie
  thereof, Huic omnes prophetae testimonium perhibent; but the people,
  Bene omnia fecit. Pilats wife, Iudas, the Diuels, and the
  President himselfe, who (as Sixtus Senensis reports) writing to
  Tiberius Casar, confessed, That the High Priests had accused him out
  of enuie; and that by the common voyce and consent of the people, he had
  deliuered him vp to their will, against the testimonie of his owne
  conscience.
               Thirdly, Because both the Iudge, and the Accusers, did proceed
  against him contrary to all Law and Iustice.
               First, by receiuing those as sufficient witnesses against him,
  which in all right and equitie, ought not to be admitted, Sciebat, quod per
  inuidiam tradidissent eum.
                  
                     Cap. Testes, q. 3.
 Leg. Vaius. §. de quaest. Testium vltro accusandi, non est
 credendum.
                   And which was more, offering themselues to bee
  witnesses, contrary to the Law, Vnius.
               
               Secondly, because no Iudge can condemne any, vnlesse he himselfe
  confesse, or be conuicted of the fact that is laid against him; whereas our
  Sauiour Christ was not onely innocent of any crime, but in right of law
  likewise, because no man could conuince him of sinne; for although he was
  falsely accused, yet was he not conuicted. And when the Iudge knowes, that the
  accused is innocent, he ought strictly to examine the witnesses, seeking
  occasion to free him; as Daniel did in the case of Susanna:
  but Pilat was willing to winke at the matter, albeit he saw well
  enough, that the testimonies were not conuenient and fitting. And therfore
  Saint Ambrose saith of him, That he washed his hands, but not his
  heart. He did likewise swallow downe one circumstance of great consequence; to
  wit, a new Edict of Tiberius Caesars, wherein expresse commandement
  was giuen (as Suetonius sets it downe) That the chastisements of death
  should not be put in execution, till tenne dayes full and compleat after
  publication of sentence: But Pilat made a short come-off with our
  Sauior, and gaue him a quicke dispatch. This sentence did surpasse all the
  vniust sentences that euer were pronounced. That of Iezabel against
  Naboth; That of the Iudges of Babylon against Susanna: For
  these had some forme of a Legall proceeding. But of this Esay saith,
  De medio iudicij sublatus est, generationem illius, quis enarrabit?
  Another letter hath it, Seculum illius. It is a bad world, when an
  innocent person shall bee put to the punishment of the Crosse, without
  sufficient witnesses to condemne him, or without lawfull hearing, in
  discharging himselfe of such things wherewithall he is charged. But as Saint
  Gregorie saith, Si ipse indebitam mortem non suscepisset, nunquam
  nos a debita morte liberasset, Had not he vndergone an vndeserued death, hee
  could neuer haue freed vs from a deserued death.
               
               Christ being thus deliuered vp to the damnable will of those,
  who desired to put him to death, and the cruellest death that Tyrannie could
  inuent, they threw a halter about his necke, and laid a most heauy Crosse vpon
  his tender shoulders, and being garded along the street by the Roman
  Cohorts,Feare and Iealousie, spurred vp the Iewes to
 crucifie Christ. they carry him away to Mount Caluarie. Their Feare and
  Iealousie, prompting them to take this course with him.
               
                  First, That he might not as heretofore
  escape their hands.
               Secondly, That in case he should escape their hands, the Temple
  should not serue his turne. For, as Gellius doth affirme in his
  Noctibus Atticis, Those that were condemned to carry their Crosse, had
  not the benefit of taking Sanctuarie.
               Thirdly, Because the death of the Crosse was so infamous a
  death, that none but theeues and traytors to the Common wealth, could bee
  condemned to this shamefull kind of death. And this (as S. Chrysostome
  hath noted it) was confirmed by the authoritie of Rome.
               Fourthly, Because they would euen then presently put him to
  begin his suffering. For, it was a common ceremonie amongst them, that they
  who were condemned to death, should haue a napkin fastned before their eyes,
  least by seeing the Executioner, and the instruments of death prepared for
  them, they might chance to fall into a swound, or faint in the way. But they
  would that Christ, to grieue him the more, should haue his punishment set
  before his eyes.
               Fiftly, The diuine prouidence (saith Saint Augustine)
  had so ordered it; for it was very fit and conuenient, that the Crosse which
  Kings vse to weare on the tops of their Crownes and Scepters, and Knights of
  diuers noble Orders on their breasts, That the Prince of heauen should first
  beare the same vpon his shoulders, conuerting thereby the greatest infamie into
  the greatest glorie that euer was in this world: so that that which on the one
  side was a sad and heauie sepctacle, on the other is a great and glorious
  mysterie.
               The people making a confused noyse, the Trumpets send forth a
  hoarse voice, the drums a dead sound, the theeues go cheeke by iole close to
  our Sauiors side, the cryers lift vp their voyces, and ball out aloud; 
  This is the Iustice, which the Emperour of Rome, and
 Pontius Pilat in his name, with the consent and approbation of the
 Princes of Ierusalem, hath commanded to be done vpon this man, as a seditious
 person, a blasphemer, an impostor, a broacher of new erronious doctrine,
 stil
                        •
                     ng himselfe the Messias and
 Sauiour of the world, the King of Israel, and the Sonne of God.
               
               He had to Mount Caluarie (according to the testimonie of some
  graue Authours,Mount Caluarie why so called. which
  haue measured out that space of ground) 1021 paces, which amount to somewhat
  more than 3000 feet. And it was called Caluarie, either from the sculls of
  those that had beene there put to death, (as Saint Ierom would haue
  it) or from the scull of Adam, who was buryed there; of which opinion
  is the glorious Athanasius, Basill, Origen, Tertullian, and Saint
  Augustine: To the end that it might be there more especially verified,
  Sicut in Adam, omnes mori
                        •
                     ntur,
  ita in Christo omnes viuificabuntur, As in Adam all men were dead, so in Christ
  all men shal be quickned and restored to life.
               
               The Diuine Prouidence had likewise so ordered the businesse,
  that the place where our Sauiour Christ was to die,Christ
 suffered in the midst of the world. should be in the midst of the world.
  And howbeit some Doctors doe not admit, that it is in rigour and strictnesse
  iust in the middle, according to a Geometricall proportion or Mathematicall
  account, yet most doe agree in this, that it was in the midst of the land of
  Palestine, (as it seemeth to Iosephus in his third booke, De bello
  Iudaico, as also to Aristeus) Or it may be said to be in the
  midst of the world, Per Priuilegium, By way of Priuiledge, Because
  that was the place where God had shewed his greatest miracles. And of this
  mind, is venerable Bede: yet notwithstanding of great force is that
  place of Dauid,
                  
                     Psal. 74.12.
                  Operatus est salutem in medio terrae, He hath wrought saluation in the
  midst of the earth.
                  
                     Ezech 5. And that of
  Ezechiel, Ista est Hierusalem, in medio gentium posui  eam, &amp; in circuitu eius terras, This is Ierusalem, I haue set it
  in the midst of the nations and countries that are roundabout her. As also
  the authoritie of Saint Ierome, who expounding this place, tearmes it,
  Meditullium terrae, &amp; vmbilicum; The very nauill or middle part of
  the earth. Which opinion is strengthened by S. August. discoursing on
  the 75 Psalme.
               Of the manner of their crucifying of our Sauiour Christ, there
  is this and that doubt made, and one more probable than another. The common
  receiued opinion of the Saints, is, That the Crosse being fixed in Mount
  Caluarie, they hailed him vp first with cords, and afterwards nayled him
  therunto. And so seemeth it good to that sacred Doctour Saint
  Gregorie, Saint Bernard, Saint Cyprian, and the
  reuelation of Saint Bridget confirmes the same. But Saint Ierome,
  Anselme, Antoninus, and Laurentius Iustinianus say, That the
  Crosse being laid all along on the ground, they first nayled him vnto it, and
  afterwards reared it vp. And this part is much fauoured for two reasons.
               The one, Because it was a more fitting and facile way to be
  done.
               The other, Because in the Holy Land there is an especiall place
  to bee seene, where they nayled our Sauiour Christ, which is a little wayes off
  from the place where the Crosse was set vp. But take which opinion you will,
  the plaine truth is, That it was one of the cruellest torments which our
  Sauiour Christ suffered; for they hauing first nayled his right hand, they did
  so stretch and straine the sinewes, that they were forced with cords to draw
  out his left hand at full length, to make it meet right with that hole which
  was bored in the Crosse for that purpose. And because they might stretch it
  out so far, that the nayle that fastned the right hand, might breake the flesh,
  and teare the sinewes, they were faine likewise to bind his right arme with
  cords to the Crosse. And with this so violent a force and extreame reaching of
  his armes, the bones of our Sauiour Christs bodie were so dislocated, and
  disjoynted, that you might plainely tell them; that prophesie of that Kingly
  Prophet Dauid, being then verified, Dinumerauerunt omnia ossa mea,
  They numbred all my bones, &amp;c.
               
               
                  Hilarie saith,Christs nayling, the
 cruellest part of his Passion. That our Sauiour Christ gaue here
  greater signes of his sorrow and griefe, than in all the rest of those bitter
  passages of his passion. And Rodulph, and Saint Bridget
  affirme, That of all other his torments, this was the greatest. And it is a
  thing worthy our consideration, That our Sauiour Christ should bee more
  sensible of this nayling of his hands, than of that Crowne of thornes which
  they platted on his head, those cruell stripes wherewith they scourged him, and
  that vinegre and gall which they gaue him to drinke. Wherof there are two
  reasons rendred.
               The one naturall, which Thomas toucheth vpon.
  Deliuering vnto vs,Two reasons proouing him more sensible of
 this torment than any other. that so intollerable is the paine and
  anguish of the sinewes, that many that were crucified, through the extreamitie
  of the paine, did swound and were depriued of their senses. And therefore our
  Sauiours torment must needes be so much the more, by how much his wounds were
  greater than theirs. Foderunt manus meas, &amp; pedes meos. Hugo
  Cardinalis doth ponder the Metaphor of foderunt, Hee doth not
  say, Clauarunt, but effoderunt: Like one that digges a pit in
  the earth.
               The other, morall, because he held vs in his hands: And
  therefore it is said, Omnia tradidit Pater in manus suas, &amp; non rapiet
  eas quisquam de manu sua, The Father hath deliuered all things into his hands,
  and no man shall snatch any thing out of his hand. And in token that he
  was more sensible of our torments than his own, the greatest paine he felt, was
  in the nayling of his hands. Leo the Pope saith, That to those that
  were crucified, they did vse to put a vayle or bend before their eyes, 
   when their hands were nayled, and that they tooke the
  like course with our Sauiour Christ, but his Loue had so ordered the
  businesse, that he had eyes to see his owne hurts, but not ours. The Prophet
  Zacharie askes the question, Quae sunt plagae istae, in medio
  manuum tuarum? What are those wounds in the midst of thy hands? The like
  question he might as well haue made of the wounds in our Sauiors side, and his
  sacred feet, but that Man was abiding in those the wounds of his hands, In
  manibus meis scripsi te, I haue written thee in my hands: And therefore
  made more reckoning of them. And at the day of iudgement he saith by the mouth
  of Zacharie, Aspicient ad me, quem crucifix
                        •
                     runt, They shall looke vpon mee whom they haue pierced.
                  
                     Zachar. 12. The sinner shall open his eyes, whose
  name being written (like a posie) in those hands, and himselfe worne by them,
  as a ring of remembrance, shall see his saluation nayled to those hands, which
  his sinnes had nayled so fast to the Crosse. In a word, as in the garden,
  hauing more care of his, than himselfe, he said in an imperious kind of manner,
  Sinite hos abire, Suffer these to depart. And on the Crosse he said
  vnto his Father, In manus tuas Domine, commendo Spiritum meum. Vpon
  which place Saint Augustine saith, That he there called the
  faithfull, his Spirit and his Soule; taking no care of his owne spirit or
  soule; for that was vnited to the Diuinitie. So that in this regard, for that
  he held vs in his hands, he felt more the torment of his hands, than of any
  other part.
               Neuer did humane Nature receiue so great an iniurie as the death
  of the Crosse. Tostatus expounding that place of Deut. Maledictus
  a Deo, qui pependit in ligno, Cursed is he that hangs vpon the tree,
  saith, That it was an iniurie done to God himselfe, that a creature created
  after Gods owne image, should dye on the Crosse, Nefas est (saith
  Cicero) vincire ciues Romanos, scelus, verberare, prope
  parricidium necare: Quid dicam in cruce agere? It is a hainous act to bind a
  Citizen of Rome, a villanie to scourge him, and in a maner paricide to kill
  him: What shall it be then to put him on the Crosse? Pliny saith, That the
  Romans did set vp certain Crosses, wheron they hung those dogges, which did
  not giue warning by barking; when the Gaulus did scale the Capitol; which
  surprisal was preuented by the gaggling of the geese. Suidas saith,
  That when any one did die a bad and vnfortunate death, they did put a Crosse
  vpon his graue. Scaliger reporteth, That vpon a time, there was a
  strange kind of headach in Rome, which had spread it selfe ouer all the Citie,
  which was so extreame painefull vnto them, that many of them did hang
  themselues in their owne garters, chusing rather to die, than to endure the
  paine thereof; and some did hang themselues for feare of that sicknesse, before
  euer it had seised vpon them: Whereupon the Senat being desirous to preuent so
  great a mischiefe, published a Proclamation, punishing therein these desperate
  offenders with the infamie of the Crosse, that dishonour might cut off that
  inconuenience, which life could not persuade. Now so great then was the loue
  which our Sauiour Christ bare vnto vs, that he deposited in the infamie and
  reproch of the Crosse, all that honour which hee had gotten himselfe by his
  myracles, his doctrine, and vnblameable life, leauing them all hanging on the
  Crosse, as a Trophie of his loue. Hercules erected pillars, where hee
  thought the world had ended and extended it's vtmost bounds, as a Trophie of
  his prowesse and valour; bearing this letter or inscription, Non plus
  vltra. Our Sauiour Christ shewed his Loue vnto vs to the end, in that his
  Trophie of the Crosse, with this letter or inscription, No Loue can goe
  beyond this Loue: And therefore the Crosse is the North-starre of our
  comfort and hope. For what can hee denie vs, or what will not he grant vnto vs,
  who on the Crosse shewed such exceeding great loue vnto vs? But some man
  perhaps will aske me, How can so bad a thing be able to afford 
   comfort? Saint Basil cleeres it with this
  answer, That the death of our Sauiour Christ did alter the nature and qualitie
  of things; turning ioy into sorrow, and sorrow into ioy. And therefore it is
  said, Vae vobis qui ridetis, Woe be vnto yee that laugh. And as we see
  sometimes that the fire doth not burne, that the water doth not drowne, and
  that wild beasts doe not bite; because the diuine Omnipotence doth truck and
  exchange the actiuenesse of those Elements, and beasts; so Christ tooke away
  the sorrow &amp; paine of the Crosse, and placed thereon Ioy, Comfort, and
  Hope. The daughters of Ierusalem went forth to see King Salomon with
  that Crowne wherewith his mother had crowned him on his wedding day, and the
  day of the ioy of his heart. But Theodoret demandeth, How can a crowne
  of thornes become a crowne of ioy? I answer, As it is a crowne of Loue it may.
  Nilus, in an Epistle which hee writeth to Olimpiodorus,
  Proconsull of Aegypt, saith, speaking of the Crosse, Per hanc desperabundis
  vndique spes annuntiatur,
                  Euery part of Christ affords a
 sinner confidence. 
                  To him, to whom (in all seeming) there remaineth
  no reason of hoping, the Crosse promiseth hope. There is no man so bad, no
  man so sad, to whom this doth not assure ioy and comfort. Consider Christ from
  the sole of the foot, to the crowne of the head; and all that we there find,
  are nothing else but reasons of confidence, and of comfort. His head bowing,
  his hands broken, his feet fettered, his side opened: with his head he beckens
  vs to him; with his armes he imbraceth vs; with his breast he doth warrant vs
  safetie. The heart of man is inscrutable. There were many that murmured at mans
  making, because hee that molded him, had not made him with a window in his
  bosome. But though thou shouldest be iealous of all the rest, yet canst thou
  not be iealous of Christ, nor of his Loue, since that he layes open his bowells
  vnto thee.
               They had now set vp the Crosse, leauing our Sauiour Christ naked
  thereupon, as alreadie hath beene deliuered vnto you. And that Historie of the
  King of Aragon, Don Alonso, further addeth, That the most blessed
  Virgin being sensible of the great shame which her beloued Son suffered vpon
  this occasion, and desiring much to couer him with the vaile which she had on
  her head, the earth heaued it selfe vp by degrees, &amp; serued in stead of a
  ladder to performe this good office. And though the Euangelists do not set
  downe all the particulars that passed then and there, yet this is so singular
  in it selfe, that I thought it not fit to haue it left out.
               Vpon the discomfort which Christ shewed in some few words that
  he vttered,Christs Deitie more concealed at his death than
 any time before the Diuells made a great muttering and whispering
  amongst themselues, that he was a meere man and a sinner. And hauing gone
  alwayes on in their blindnes, in not knowing of him, at this last push they
  bewrayed their blindnesse more than euer heretofore. Eusebius
  Caesariensis saith, That albeit all the whole life of Christ was a
  couering, and discouering of the treasure of his Diuinitie; yet at his death he
  did hide it in that manner, and kept it so close, that innumerable Legions of
  Diuells came to flout and scoffe at him, as if they had now gotten the
  victorie; so doth that place of Esay expresse this their triumphing
  ouer him, Infernus super te, conturbatus est in occursum aduentus tui,
  suscitauit tibi Gigantes: by whom he vnderstands the diuells, which said
  to our Sauiour Christ on the Crosse, Et tu vulneratus es, sicut &amp; nos,
  &amp; nostri similis factus es, detracta est ad inferos superbia tua, Thou
  hast hitherto deceiued vs, but now thou shalt cosin vs no more, wee know now
  well enough what thou art: We will now be Gods, Super astra Dei, exaltabo
  solium meum, &amp; similis ero altissimo, Thou wouldst faine likewise haue
  made thy selfe a God, but thou art wounded and infected as well as we, with
  sin. Now thy eyes waxe dimme and darke, thy face pale and wan, thy tongue
  furred  and swolne; thy lips blacke and blew; and thy
  whole body nothing from top to toe but stripes and goare blood.
  Caesarius, that was a Contemporarie of Saint Bernards, saith,
  That he did aske a certaine Diuel, from whence he came? And that he should make
  him this answer, I come from assisting at the death of Abbot Gerardo.
  How durst thou (said the other) set vpon so holy a man? Whereunto the Deu

                  l answered, Ego presens fui super
  brachium crucis, quando Dei filius expirauit; I was present at the crosse,
  when the Sonne of God expired. And Didimus saith, That
  Lucifer did assist there at that time, accompaned with great squadrons
  of Deuils in most horible and fearefull shapes. E

  the Bulls, the Lyons, and the Vnicornes, who comming vpon him with open mouth,
  did cast a cloud of heauinesse and sadnesse before those his Diuine eyes.
  Eusebius likewise expounding that verse of the 54 Psalme, [Timor
  &amp; tremor venerunt super me, &amp; contexerunt me tenebrae, Feare and
  trembling are come vpon me, and an horrible feare hath couered mee.]
  sayth, That as in holy Scripture many Diuels are called, spirits of
  Fornication, and of Horror, so some men are called Ruffians, Raggamuffins,
  Swash-bucklers, &amp;c. Contexerunt me tenebrae, is there set downe,
  to expresse the infinite number of Diuels attending then vpon our Sauiour. They
  did couer him like a cloud, but they could not comprehend him. To whom may be
  applyed that place of Saint Iohn, The light did shine in darkenes, and the
  darkenesse comprehended it not. God permitting it should be

  might bee verified; Tentatum per omnia He was tempted in all things.

                     •
                  orthwith by the hooke of his Diuinitie. Gregorie
  Nissen applyeth to this purpose that historie of Dauid, when
  Saul throwing his speare at him, hee left it sticking in the wall,
  Dauid remaining vnhurt. Quousque irruitis in hominem, interficitis
  vniuersi vos tanquam pariete inclinato. Saint Ierome expounding
  this place of our Sauiour Christ, calls him parietem, because he was
  our wall, Murus, &amp; antemurale. So sayth Esay. And
  parietem inclinatum, because he hung vpon the Crosse inclinato
  capite, &amp; maceriae repulsae; like vnto a wall that is pusht and
  shov'd at; For, as some setting their shoulders against a wal, and seeking by
  maine strength to throw it down to the ground, they themselues vsually fall
  with it, which thrust it downe, one remaining without an arme, another without
  a legge, and some without their liues: So the Iewes and Romans, setting to
  their shoulders to ouerthrowe the life of our Sauiour Christ; one lost his
  Kingdome, another his Monarchy, this man his goods, that man his life, &amp;
  many both their bodies and soules. This is that Interficitis vniuersi
  vos; And as that speare which Saul threw did not touch
  Dauid, but smote the wal; So the nailes, wounds, scourges, and thornes
  toucht our Sauiours Humanitie, but not his Diuinitie. So that the speare which
  was flung at him, missing his Godhead,  and hitting
  onely his Manhood, the Deuill was thereby taken, mocked, ouerthrowne, amazed,
  and astonished. In Exodus, God beeing willing to giue an end to the
  plagues of Aegypt, he commanded that euerie family of the children of Israell
  should on a certaine night kill a Lambe, and that they should sprinkle the
  posts of the doores of their houses with the blood thereof; and, that when the
  Angell should passe by, slaying the first borne of Aegypt, he should skip ouer
  the posts that were sprinckled with the blood of the Lambe, which the
  Israelites that night had eaten to supper. S. Chrysostome saith, That
  the Angell did feare the blood of that Lambe, because it was a type and figure
  of that true and most innocent Lambe, who was to haue his blood sprinckled on
  the posts of the Crosse. If then an Angell of God were affraid of the blood of
  a beast, because it was a figure of that blood which was to be shed on the
  Crosse for the sauing of sinners, and such as were Gods chosen people; What
  feare and terrour shall the blood and death of our Sauior Christ, God, and Man,
  strike into Hell? Saint Paul sayth, Triumphans illos in semetipso,
  Triumphing ouer them in the Crosse, subduing powers, principalities,
  &amp;c. It is Anselmes obseruation,
                     Coloss. 2. that the triumphers of this world, make
  their triumph by shedding the blood of their enemies:The

  deuils, and ouer sinne and death, by shedding his owne proper blood. God did
  antiently in those times of old, take the same course with his enemies, as
  other t

  made himselfe then to bee knowne by destroying, drowning, and killing of them.
  But now hee would get himselfe a name, and fame, by dying himselfe on the
  Crosse. This strange and new kind of victorie, Esay paynteth foorth by
  introducing our Sauiour Christ, who ascendeth all bloodie vp vnto Heauen; and
  by bringing in those Angells who aske the question, Who is this that comes thus
  stained and dy'd in his owne blood, and yet is both faire and valiant? Who is
  this (as it is in the Text) that commeth from Edom,
                     Esay. 63. with red garments from Bozrah? He is

  true, But humane nature hath both flesh and blood; Whereof they had made

  and without sinne) but in regard of the rest of mankind, from whome it was
  inseparable and not to bee remooued, and so must neede Sinne, whilest that was

                     503
                     We must fly to him in all extremities.
