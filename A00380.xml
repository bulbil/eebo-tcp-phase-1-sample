            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

The same dyd also wrastle with the angell / for the whiche wrastlynge he obtayned the nameGenes. xxxii. of Israell. For I sayth he wyll nat let the departe excepte thou shalte blesse me. His brother beynge supplanted / he dyd obtayne his fathers blessynge: He inforsynge the angell dyd purchase the blessynge of god. Nother oughte it to be thought any inconuenyence if a man be sayd to wrastle with god / seynge we do heare our sauyoure hym selfe sayenge in ye gospell thatMatthe. xi. the kyngdome of heuen doth suffre violence / and that men violently cōmynge to it do pulle it to them.

Lyke as in ye psalme before ye prophete doth demaūde after the saluacion of mākynde sayeng who shal arise to helpe &amp; remedy ye world beyng so desperate: In like fassyon doth he heare crye sayeng:
O lorde who shal abyde ī thy tabernacle / or who shal reaste in thy holy mountayne?
In yt he nameth a tabernacle he requireth an hye preest / and whan he nameth a holy moūtayne he desyreth a kynge of more puissaūce thā is ye puissaūce of Satan / 

and he heareth answere made to hym of the sprite: he whiche entreth without spotte and dothe worke ryghtwysenes. By the which testimonye or prayse is signyfyed the persone of Christ which onely with out all excepcyon was pure &amp; clene frō all blemys

Mounte Syon hath his denominacyon or name of speculacyon or beholdynge / In whiche who souer dothe reaste he beynge hyer than all thynges terrestryall or earthly doth beholde &amp; desyre no thynges but celestyall. And he dyd nat only worke ryghtwysenes which in all poyntes dyd accomplisshe the workes of his father / but he also wrought ryghtwysenes for vs and to vs. For vnto i. Corin. ivs saith ye Apostle was he made

ryghtwysenes whiche nother had any of our owne / nother coulde haue any / in lykewyse as we can nowe also haue none of our owne or propre. Thus hytherto haue I applyed this psalme vnto the persone of Chryste. Nother do they amysse whiche do interprete this psalme of the lyfe heuenly. For in heauen also is bothe a temple and a tabernacle / in which without inintercessyon or cessynge is offered the sacrefyce of prayse and of thankes gyuyng / lyke as is sayd in an other psalme: Blessyd be they whiche do dwell in thy house O lorde / Psalme. lxxxiii. in worlde without ende shall they prayse the.
