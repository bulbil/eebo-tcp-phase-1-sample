            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            The tranſlatour to the Reader.
            
               THere is no good nature (gentle Reader) that beholding on a ſtage an old Tragedie, wherein be repreſented the miſeries of any one man, or the ruine and deſolation of a whole countrie, will not accompany the outward motions of the players, with ſome inward affection, yea, ſometimes with teares and vehement compaſſion. Which if we doe in a play, whereof the matter is many times but inuented, and howſoeuer it be true, yet happened in Countries farre off and long agoe, the parties neither touching vs in kindred, nor the matter in example: ſurely the dangerous practices and moſt horrible executions of the Spaniſh Inquiſition, declared in this booke, which now is brought with fire and ſword into the low Countries, the ſodaine impriſonment of honeſt men without proceſſe of law, the pitifull wandring in exile and pouertie of perſonages ſomtime rich and wealthy, the wiues hanging on their husbands

ſhoulders, and the poore baniſhed infants on the mothers breſts, the monſtrous racking of men without order of law, the villanous and ſhameleſſe tormenting of naked women beyond all humanitie, their miſerable death without pitty or mercy, the moſt reprochfull triumphing of the popiſh Synagogue ouer Chriſtians, as over Painimes and Ethnicks, the conquering of ſubiects as though they were enemies, the vnſatiable ſpoyling of mens goods, to fill the ſide paunches of ambitious idle ſhauelings, the ſlender quarrels picked againſt kingdomes and nations, and all this onely to hoiſe vp a pild polling prieſt aboue all power and authoritie that is on earth: theſe things ought ſurely much more to moue vs to compaſsion: Being no ſtageplay, but a matter fit for any Poet to make a Tragedie of hereafter, either for that it will bee an argument moſt lamentable, or moſt incredible to them which ſhall not haue ſeene it; The perſons which ſuffer being our neighbours by their habitation and dwelling place, our acquaintance by entercourſe, our friends by long acquaintance, of the ſame houſhold of faith, and our very brethren in Chriſt. And if we weepe when we ſee cruelties ſet forth in playes, becauſe the like either hath happened to vs heretofore, or hereafter may betide vs, then have we not ouely good cauſe in theſe calamities of our poore brethren to bewaile that which happened to them, but alſo to feare what will follow vpon vs. For if we, that not many yeares ſince felt but a taſte of this Iron whippe, and ſince haue enioyed quietneſſe

and leiſure to ſerue God, thinke our ſelues ſure and the ſtorme paſſed, and that wee be but hearers and ſeers, and haue no parts in this Tragedie, beſides that we are vncharitable in ſo lightly eſteeming the griefes of others, we doe alſo fooliſhly and dangerouſly abuſe our ſelues. For who is ſo ignorant of the holy Complot and Conſpiracie agreed on by the Pope and his Champions for the execution of the Councell of Trent, and the generall eſtabliſhing of this Inquiſition? Behold the attempts in Scotland, the proceedings in France, the executions in Flaunders, and if we Engliſhmen haue one of the laſt parts, let vs bee ſure, as in Tragedies the laſt parts and Actes be moſt dolefull, ſo wee neuer knew yet what perſecution meant in compariſon, to that is meant and threatned vs now. If the Diuels holineſſe, and his lieutenant generall, the Popes maieſtie, were a little moued then, they bee now (doubt ye not) enraged, and tranſubſtantiate into furour and horne woodneſſe, to ſee their reuenues decay, their Monaſteries and Synagogues defaced, their villanies detected, their noble champions ſlain. And therefore you muſt ſet before your eyes the Diuell in perſon, and the Pope his chaplaine and Confeſſour, gotten vp into the top of ſome high mountaine, and from thence ſhewing the kingdomes of the earth to ſuch Princes as will themſelues fall downe and worſhip, and thereto driue the world. Which is ſo farre off from any figuratiue ſpeech, as it is knowne to be the very Platforme and foundation of all theſe broyles and troubles. Be not deceiued

(good Reader) vnderſtand the world, theſe men ſeeke no religion. For how can they ſeeke Religion, that thinke there is no God? They ſeeke the honour and wealth of the world. If the Goſpell would allow ambition, pleaſure, profite, the Pope would haue long ſince beene a proteſtant. If Popery had allowed preaching of the truth, reformation of life, pouertie: Popery had beene eſteemed (as it is) Hereſie, and ſo perſecuted. But the Pope would bee thought moſt holy, and be indeed moſt mightie; the world is falne from him: he hath ſpent all: nought comes in to ſupply; he hath a great ſort to entertaine, a great ſort to reward, a great pompe and ſtate to maintaine. Trow yee theſe things will bee raiſed of the ſpoile of poore Proteſtants? Nay, be thou ſure of it, Papiſt or Proteſtant, if thou be rich, and haſt any fleece, it will be all one. Thy land will vndoe thee: thy goods will condemne thee. Euen as the good Citizen of Rome, Q. Aurelius in Scyllas time, that was neither of the one ſide nor the other, but lamented the ſpoile and miſery of his countrie, when as he came into the market place, and heard hi
                  •
                name read among them that were proſcribed to death, cryed out, O vnhappy man that I am: my houſe at Alba is the cauſe of my death, and by and by was openly ſlaine. If euer there were time like to Scyllas, it is now in our dayes, in which hungry need, and vnſatiable couetouſneſſe armed with crueltie will ſpare nothing. The ſeruant will betray his maſter: the friend his friend and acquaintance: the brother ſhall murther his brother. As in the ſame time

               L. Catilina, he that after would haue ſet fire on the Citie, ſlew his owne brother, and after prayed Scylla that hee might bee proſcribed. The which being granted him, he recompenced with killing another, M. Marius one of the contrary faction, and bringing his head, the blood running along his armes, preſented it in the market place to Scylla, and ranne to the holy water-pot of Apollos temple which was hard by, to waſh his hands, a very fit vſe of ſuch holy water. The which ſtorie I the rather recite, ſparing an infinite ſort of our times, becauſe yee may vnderſtand by the way, that Idols and holy water bee ancient things, ſuch as were before Chriſts comming, and will be continued by his enemies till he come againe, and that knowing the Papiſts religion to be no better then thoſe heatheniſh peoples was, their couetouſneſſe greater, their need more, their cruelty farre paſsing not onely all preſent example, but alſo all written hiſtory, you may daily looke for worſe then Scillas time if they ouercome: hauing on the other ſide no fierce or cruell Marius to withſtand them, nor to quarell with them for the gouernment; but a poore flock of ſilly ſheepe behinde their ſhepheard affraid of the wolues, halfe yeelding, halfe defending their liues: and on their ſides thouſands of deſperate Catilines, that to repaire their decayed ſtates, will not ſpare neither to kill their owne brethren, nor to fire their countrie: and hauing at all times, but ſpecially now ſuch a Scilla, vnder whoſe banner they fight, as the old Scilla may in reſpect of this, be both forgiuen and forgetten. Take heed, we

               lhound, who though he think it no robbery to be equall in pompe with his predeceſſours, and in malice with the diuell his father: yet hath he vouchſafed to take vpon him the ſhape of a man, and goeth (they ſay) on foot, and maketh his tenants the ſtewes keepe-in like good huſwiues, which is no ſmall reformation, and doth good deeds at home, and worketh wonders (forſooth) whiles he vndoeth all abroad, and openeth ſuch a gap for the great Seigneur the Turke, as neuer was yet made. But what will not theſe fellowes do to reuenge their fall? and what ought not we rather to endure, then to admit theſe ſpirituall tyrants? who would not rather be conquered of a mightie Prince and honourable (in compariſon) then of a villaine bankrupt prieſt? who hath for theſe eight or nine hundred yeares occupied the whole world of credite; and now he ſhould come to accompt, killeth his creditours. A miſerable choice, but yet a ready choice. For the Turke contenteth himſelfe with honour and tribute, permitting religion. The Pope, no honour will ſatisfie him, no riches ſuffice him, no blood aſſwage him: neither the death of the liuing, nor the ſoules of the dead, will content him. Whoſe very name ſhould not be ſpoken of without Surreuerence and great contempt, for the baſeneſſe and vileneſſe of his counterfeit ſtate, were hee not ſo iuſtly to be hated and abhorred as the great abuſer and very vndoubted Antichriſt of the world, and ſworne enemy of God and man. The cruell and tyrannicall

outrages of whoſe Inquiſitours founded and eſtabliſhed by the Diuell and this Antichriſt, if we conferre with the milde proceedings and diſcipline of Commiſsioners appointed by God and his Anointed, we ſhall thereby ſee euidently by the heauenly iudgement and ſentence of wiſe Salomon, to which mother the liue childe appertaineth: To the Romiſh whore, who (in deſpite that ſhe cannot poſſeſſe the poore infants that belong not to her, to ſmother them ſleeping with the huge and filthy body of her traditions and ceremonies) ſeeketh by all meanes poſsible to diuide and mangle them: or to the naturall and pitifull mother the true Church of the faithfull, whoſe fathers and miniſters (knowing of whoſe ſpirit they are) ſeeke with all gentleneſſe to call home the loſt ones, and watchfully to nouriſh them. Whoſe prince imitating the peaceable raigne of Salomon, hath not ſo much as executed the falſe Prophets, not killed the wolues, not deſtroyed the foxes. Onely they are tyed vp ſhort, which though it bee no ſuch ſuretie for the little ones as worldly wiſdome doth require, and neceſsitie long ſince hath cried out for, yet is it to them no ſmall griefe to ſee the Lambes feed before their eyes, and the pooreſt ſhepheards leaſt whelpe baying at them: whileſt they in the middeſt of their gluttony and drunkenneſſe, houle for hunger of their brethrens fleſh, and thirſtineſſe of their blood, and pine for very enuie of the proceeding of Gods word.

Wherefore (good Reader) hauing ſo euident markes of their woluiſh and rauening natures, and ſo good notice of their bloody conſpiracie, &amp; ſo waying the very true cauſe of all theſe troubles and wars that be in Chriſtendome, and thereto conferring the preſent executions &amp; ſlaughters, euen in our neighbours houſe, the fire whereof may ſoone imbrace our owne, let vs be ſtirred vp to pray for their deliuerance, and that it would pleaſe God, to turne from vs the ſame iuſtly deſerued plague for our vnthankfulneſſe. Let vs be ſtrong in faith, and couragious in deed, to repell theſe common enemies from our countrie whenſoeuer they ſhall offer that they haue ſo long determined. And if in this tranſlation, there ſhall happen to be ſome faults, pardon them till the next impreſsion; for the meaning of the tranſlatour was onely to make thee ſpeedily vnderſtand of ſo great and ſo imminent a perill: beſides, that thou mighteſt vſe this booke as a taſte in the meane ſpace, whiles the booke of Martyres be reprinted, wherein there is a moſt plentifull and notable Hiſtory of the like matter and argument.
         
         
            
            The Preface of the Author.
            
               IN ſo great a hurly-burly of ciuill diſſenſions, wherein ſo many people and nations bend force against their owne companions and fellow-citizens, and furiouſly ruſh their ſwords and weapons into the very bowels of their owne naturall countrie, and for none other cauſe in very deed but for the Inquiſition, it would make a wiſe man doubt in this caſe whether of them were madde: the one ſide, which maintaine the Inquiſition, as a thing moſt holy and wholeſome for the Common-wealth; or the other, which ſeeke not to auoide any godly Inquiſition and reformation of religion, but to defend themſelues like men worthy of liberty wherein they were borne and bred, from a ſtrange, vnworthy, and intolerable ſlavery. For though they be both alike ready armed, yet differing aſmuch in their opinions and iudgements, as they doe in their mindes and affections, it cannot be that right and equitie ſhould bee on both parts: ſo that, if the one haue iuſtly taken weapon in hand, the other (no doubt) haue done it vniuſtly. And to paſſe over the great number of inferiour eſtates, it is not likely that the chiefe Soveraignes of the world, who are perſwaded that they ought by all meanes poſſible to maintaine the ſame, and haue vowed the defence thereof with great deuotion and ſolemne o

Beſides theſe glorious titles, there be alſo thereunto annexed other ſingular commodities; to wit, a diligent endeuour to remoue the infection that might grow aſwell of the Iewiſh and Mahometicall hereſies that daily doe ariſe, beſides the reuenues of the Exchequer encreaſed hereby, and the ſodaine and maruelous enriching of diuers priuate perſons, which though they be great matters in worldly reſpect, yet are they not ſo greatly to be accompted of in this cauſe. But foraſmuch as by Chriſts owne ſaying, and by naturall reaſon, a man cannot haue a more eaſie or perfect iudgement of the qualitie of a tree, whether it be good or bad, then by the fruit thereof, I may without offending of any man in the triall of this matter, which is no leſſe profitable then hard and difficult to doe, obſerue the ſame order: ſince the miſchiefe is now already ſo farre detected, and men growne to be ſo curious, that they feare not to call into question ſuch things, as they haue hitherto by great errour and doltiſhneſſe worſhipped and held for moſt holy and ſacred. Now if the Inquiſition be a good tree, or as they delight to terme it a Holy, I doubt not but it will be content to ſhew the fruits openly, by the goodneſſe or holineſſe whereof, it may without fraud or enuie be eſteemed how good or holy the ſtocke it ſelfe is. For light loueth the light, and he that dealeth truly and vprightly is willing to come into the light, in deſpight of the diuell and all other darkneſſe, that his workes done in the feare of God may come to light. But he that worketh the things that be euill hateth the light, and hauing power and authoritie, bridleth mens tongues, couering his faults with forced ſilence, leſt that the light ſhould diſcouer them, and ſhew them to be repro
                  •
               eable. Wherefore let all Christendome now behold theſe

fruites of the Holy Inquiſition: which being otherwiſe very plentifull, by the onely meanes of Gods goodneſſe, wee haue here and there plucked for a ſay and taste of the tree, and by theſe let them iudge (as caſily they may) whether this Holy Tree be worthy to ſtand ſtill, or to be turned vpſide downe. For herein resteth all and ſome concerning theſe matters; whether the reports that I ſhall make in this Treatiſe of the Holy Inquiſition, be true or no. Secondarily, how I came to the knowledge thereof, for no man will doubt but that this tree doth worthily deſerue to bee hewed downe, if there be ſufficient proofe that it buddeth forth ſuch peſtilent bloſſomes, and beareth like fruites as theſe be. Againe, it were a dangerous and inconuenient matter, if we heretickes that deteſt the Inquiſition as a ſharpe and iuſt plague of God, and therefore worthy to be holden ſuſpected, ſhould haue any credite giuen vs herein. Wherefore I haue thought it a thing worthy the trauaile, to ſhew the briefeſt and moſt certaine way, whereby the truth thereof might without any great trouble be vnderſtood. That is to ſay, if the King whoſe office it is ſpecially to ſee to the adminiſtration of justice in his owne dominion, would first bee brought to beleeue, that both he might of his abſolute authoritie, and of dutie ought to call the holy Court of Inquiſition to accompts, and that no lawes or decrees of their making, no Priuiledges, no Bulls, no Pardons or diſpenſations, finally, no Oath ought to let or hinder him from the doing of his dutie herein. Secondarily, if after he had appointed ſuch a ſpeciall Commiſſion to examine the Inquiſition, he would ſeeke meanes to be enſormed of ſuch matters by men of grauitie and good conſciences, who calling vnto them others, ſuch as might be thought to haue the most knowledge and beſt experience in theſe matters, might learne out a truth, as the beſt custome is, in all other courts and conſiſtories as they call them. For the which purpoſes thoſe that either preſently are, or haue beene heretofore fettered in the Inquiſitours priſons, were firſt to bee ſent for and examined but vnbridled in any caſe, hauing thoſe worſe then Iron bittes, taken from their tongues, with the which the Inquiſition hath hitherto kept her tyrannie

cloſe; that is to ſay, their ſolemne ſwearing of them to be ſilent while they liue, inhibiting them the vttering of any thing by any meanes, that they either knew, or ſaw, or had experience of themſelues touching the Holy Inquiſition, or their whole manner of proceeding againſt them in Court or otherwiſe: but that they ſhould rather repute themſelues as dead perſons for for that time concerning the knowledge or ſenſe of any ſuch matters. And as though their oath (for ſooth) were not a matter of force enough, they annexe thereunto terrible threatnings. By meanes where of all the trickes of the Inquiſition haue hitherto beene ſecret and hidden, and paſſed vnder couert to and fro, with a cloake and ſhadow of a zeale of godlineſſe, and yet not ſo obſcurely or ſecretly, but that the whole world (though confuſedly and as it were a farre off) hath at the length eſpied and found out their outragious tyranny.
            And this is the onely cauſe that maketh all men keepe their tongues, leaſt it might bee their happes likewiſe to haue experience thereof in themſelues. This bridle I ſay muſt firſt bee remoued and taken away from them of whome theſe queſtions ſhould be asked, and libertie muſt be giuen to ſpeake boldly and without danger, if a man would haue theſe ſecrecies come to light, that haue beene kept cloſe ſo long, to the great decay and hinderance of the Common wealth, Wherefore if ſmall credite ſhall be giuen to vs in this Treatiſe, or none at all, becauſe wee be as it were a partie, and therefore juſtly to be ſuſpected, ſeeing for our owne parts wee deſire no credite, but referre the matter wholly to diligent and orderly triall, there is no cauſe why any ſhould thinke better or worſe of it for vs, but judge of it indifferently by it ſelfe as it is.
            Moreouer it is as greatly pertinent to our purpoſe to ſhew how we came to the knowledge hereof. Wherein, albeit we take God to record and our conſcience, that all this is true, yet notwithſtanding wee craue no ſuch credite to be aided thereby: neither ſhall any have juſt cauſe to lay that to our charge, that we haue gone from the triall of the matter, and vſed this as a ſhift.
            
               
But to paſſe the Kings treaſuris, and the enriching of other priuate perſons, howſoeuer they came by their wealth, becauſe wee would not bee thought to enuie their proſperitie of many other and ſo great commodities as wee haue before rehearſed, (whereof the fauourers and maintainers of the Inquiſition do commonly make their bragges, that there is nothing that maketh for them, but rather for the contrary part) it is eaſie for any man to perceiue, that will conſider with us but thus much, that of ſo many thouſands of people, either Turkes or Iewes, or true Chriſtians or heretikes (as they terme them) and reuolters from the Romiſh faith, as haue come within the Inquiſitours iuriſdiction from the very firſt beginning of the Inquiſition, till this day, there are to bee ſeene many thouſands of Sambenites, as mounments of ſome that were burned, ſome whom beſides the perpetuall and vnrecouerable infamie that hath red

To be ſhort, that ſo many ſpoiles of poor ſoules doe remaine to be ſeene as haue ſuffred at their hands for very trifles: but of any whom they haue inſtructed and amended, or withdrawn from their errors, not ſo much as one example

            Now as concerning the originall of the Inquiſition, the continuance, and the glorious title that bleareth and bl

The fathers of the faith: The Inquiſitors of leud hereſies and apoſtacie?) I will ſpeak ſomewhat, to the intent men may vnderſtand by what right they claime and hold the ſame.
            After the warres were ended, wherin Ferdinando and Iſabella of famous memory expelled the Turkes out of the territory and Citie of Granata, and other places in Spaine, which had vſurped there by the ſpace of 778. yeares, from the time of Roderico the laſt king of Spain, that was of the race and line of the Goths, hauing reſtored their country into the ancient eſtate that it was in before, and gotten to themſelues perpetuall fame and renowne, they fell from thoſe continuall troubles and tumults of warre to

reforming and purging of religion. The occaſion whereof came as well by the Mores, that being conquered, had liberty to remaine in Spaine, and enjoy all their goods with condition that they ſhould receiue the chriſtian faith: as by the Iewes, that were in number as many as the other, who were permitted to continue ſtill vnder the ſame condition that the Mores did, commandement being giuen to all that were not content to admit this condition, that they ſhould immediately depart Spaine, paſsing ouer the ſtraites of Marrocke, and retyre into their owne countrey. For the Iewes (as their most ancient Chronicles doe report) did inhabite Spaine from the time that Titus Emperor of Rome deſtroyed Ierulalem. Who cauſed them to bee tranſported thither, there to remaine in miſerie and thraldome, being notwithstanding in good caſe for one thing, in that they were not compelled by any to alter their religion till the time of Ferdinando. Whereupon the kings of Spaine conſidering, that thoſe people were but only Chriſtians by name and for faſhion ſake, ſubmitting themſelues for feare and awe, and for ſafegard of their riches, rather then any loue or zeal which they bare to christianitie, deuiſed to make prouiſion, and to take ſome order for their better instruction. A godly purpoſe ſurely, and meet for chriſtian Princes, if euill counſellers had not maliciouſly peruerted their good intents. For there were alwayes about the king certaine Friers of the order of Saint Dommicke, to whom diuers well diſpoſed Princes gaue very great care and credit, eſpecially in matters of religion and conſcience: which being a proud and ambitious ſect, that tooke vpon them great skill, and outwardlly profeſſed much holineſſe moſt arrogantly and impudently; by meanes thereof, had more free acc

of Conſiſtorie of an Inquiſition; wherein the poore wretches, in ſteade of better inſtructions, wherewith there was ſome hope to win them, ſhould be robbed and ſpoiled of all their goods, and poſſeſsions, and either put to moſt cruell death, or ſuffer moſt intolerable torments by whippe or otherwiſe, leading the reſt of their life in perpetuall obloquie and ignominie, and ſuſtaining extream pottertie by loſſe of lands and goods. Neither was this executed onely vpon ſuch as had moſt ſhamefully blaſph

               g ceremonie of the Iewiſh or Moriſh law, or the ſmalleſt error in chriſtian religion, whereof they did neuer teach them ſo much as their articles, had beene matter ſufficient to condemne them. To the furtherance of this new deuice Sixtus the fourth of that name, Pope of Rome, put his helping hand by adding his confirmation, ſo that at the length it became of ſuch force being ratified and eſtabliſhed by the kings authoritie and the Popes, that were it not for that the hugeneſſe thereof is ſuch, that is not able to ſuſtaine it ſelfe, being a thing ſo burdenous to the world and ſo importable, a man might very well thinke it to bee impregnable. See I pray you how well theſe godly paſtours prouided for the new increaſe of Christ's flocke, whom they ought to haue had greater regard to feed than their owne bellies, and ſhould not in milking them haue drawne the very bloud to deuoure it, nor beſides the hauing of their fleece, flame them alſo moſt cruelly to couer themſelues with the skinnes, neither ought to haue killed the fatlings, but to cheriſh the weakelings, to binde the broken, to ſeeke the ſtra

the true chriſtian faith, whereof they had of long time bin accounted the patrons. But afterwards by meanes of their vnſatiable couetouſneſſe and ambition, (for the whech two vices they are already diſcredited among the common people) as alſo for their crueltie and tyrannie which they practiſed, being exalted to that high eſtate and dignitie, they became ſo intolerable, that the Princes themſelues who lately before had aduanced them to thoſe estates, were enforced to diſplace them, pretending diuers reaſonable cauſes and allegations, and ſo committed it vnto the Clergie: Whereof the ancient Churches of the Dominicans hung round about with ancients and enſignes of victorie, ouer ſuch as they conquered during the time that they were in authoritie, is proofe ſufficient.

            Howbeit they retaine till this day the title and name of Inquiſitours ſtill with tooth and naile, and will one day no doubt haue a cast at the office againe, and claime their right. So that we may thanke theſe wicked counſellors and none other for the Inquiſition at this day, most diuelliſhly peruerting the godly purpoſes of Princes, which tended to the weale of the Church, and conuerting them wholly to the aduancement of their owne commoditie and eſtimation. Or elſe whereto I beſeech you appertained it, that they which would be accounted diligent and faithfull ſowers of the ſeede of christianitie, and the zealous furtherers of the ſame, ſhould erect a new kind of Conſiſtory, ſo rare and ſtrange to the whole world, which is not ſet vp to informe the ignorant, or to conuince the obstinate, and bring them to the knowledge of true religion, either by perſwaſion of learning, or by charitable dealing, the only meanes that Christ would haue his miniſters to work by, but to compell them by force and might, by rigour and extremitie, by commiſsions and authoritie, by Racks &amp; Torments,

Chaines, Halters, Barnacles, Sambenites, by Fire and by Fagots: which holy Conſiſtorie of theirs, is not aſsiſted with men of godly conuerſation, or knowne to be learned in the myſteries of holy Scripture, ſuch as would labour painfully in the Lords vineyard, and ſet forward his harueſt: but is garded with Sherifes, Treaſurers, Notaries, Sum

And who would not iudge think ye, that all theſe things were deviſed rather to lay new taxes and impoſitions vpon the people, and to encreaſe the reuenues of the Eſchequer, than for the furtherance of religion. As for the purpoſe, if a man would chuſe out a cunning huntſman with all his furniture, hauing his art

For (doubtleſſe) the commiſsion an dauthoritie of preaching was giuen to good and godly Biſhops and paſtours (if any ſuch there were) both by the lawes of God, and constitutions of man, that they ſhould teach and instruct, as well the young nouices as the elder ſchollers, to tread the path of true godlineſſe. But theſe men being ſo blind, or ſo careleſſe, or both, that either they couldnot, or wouldnot ſee to their office and duetie in this behalfe, there was neuer a man of them all, either Biſhop or Diuine, but he thought that a great part of his dutie touching his function was abbridged &amp; diſpenſed withall, by meanes of erecting the court of Inquiſition; all good and godly laws concerning chriſtianitie, are ſo cleane raced out of the tables of their hearts.

Afterwards, being by violence forced vpon them, they did alſo with force and violence withſtand it, alledging that it tended rather to the impeachment of the libertie of their countrie, then to the reformation of religion. In ſo much that it was not received (if a man may ſay it were receiued at all that, was forced vpon them againſt their wils) till the ſettling of it had coſt many a mans life.

plainely by the zeale that was in thoſe good Princes, that they had a better meaning with them at the firſt, then that which through their wicked counſellours afterward was put in execution. The Inquiſition being th

               n to bring men into a heape of perpetuall errours? And the court of Inquiſition being erected on the other part for reformation of errours, they might be ſure like good hunters to lodge the Deere, and take their ſtand, and ſo to obtaine a continuall prey. But to proceed, let vs grant them thus much, that the Inquiſition was ordained to none other end, and that they be two ſeuerall and diſtinct offices, to teach the faith, and to roote out hereſies, yet were it the part and dutie of good and diſcreet counſellours, to prouide that the authoritie committed to Biſhops by the holy Scriptures of God, ſhould not thereby be taken from them: neither ſhould any other perſwaſion

enter into their heads, that there were any other fire or ſword to root out hereſies, but only the ſword of Gods word: both the which things the holy Apoſtle did moſt euidently teach in the Epiſtle to Titus; where among other qualities required in a Biſhop, hee would haue him embrace the word of God fit for inſtruction, that he may be able to exhort by wholeſome doctrine, and to conuince the gainſayers and aduerſaries. For ſurely a true and iuſtifying faith cannot be forced, (the nature thereof is ſuch) no more can hereſie be deſtroyed by the heretickes death. But the word of God is moſt apt and ſit for both purpoſes. For thereby faith is not only engendred, but increaſed and multiplyed meruellouſly, and whatſoeuer is not agreeable to true faith, if it be examined and tried by the light of this word, ſhall ſoone be bewrayed. Wherefore they ought first to haue reſorted to the Scriptures, and taken counſell of them, whether they had limited any puniſhment for ſuch as ſhould ſhew themſelues wilfull and obſtinate againſt the truth, or the moſt cruell execution that can be by fire. For as concerning the confiſcation of goods, what can be thought more wretched and couetous, or more vnjuſt and ſhameleſſe, or further from the profeſſion of a Christian man? And to let paſſe their open infamy, the staine whereof will hardly be ſpunged out againe, who can worthily ſpeake enough againſt them, that vſe the ſame kinde of puniſhment euen againſt thoſe poore wretches, wh
                  ••
                they haue perſwaded to recant their errours? Paul in the place aboue mentioned, appointeth no penaltie, for as much as it may well be, that the partie condemned may in time be reclaimed, and therefore mercy ought rather to be practiſed of euery good ſhepheard with all gentleneſſe and loue, then any ſuch extremitie. But let vs enter further, and ſee what Paul appointeth for ſuch as are obstinate perſons. Auoide the company of an hereticke (ſaith he) after one or two admonitions. Firſt hee would haue him charitably admoniſhed of his error twice or thrice, and that by the Biſhop, not cited into the court, not put to the torments, or otherwiſe puniſhed for his erronious opinions with ſuch extremitie, and ſo continually. Then if gentle admonition will reclaime

him, there is good cauſe why both the Biſhop and the whole congregation may rejoyce of the winning of a brother, to be a member of Chriſt. But if ſuch admonitions will not preuaile, he counſelleth vs to proceed to excommunication: that is to ſay, to cut him off and exclude him the company and fellowſhip of the Chriſtians: the which notwithſtanding must not be executed in way of reuenge of his error, but ministred as a medicine for his amendment. And this judgement of the Diſciple agreeth with the rule of his Maſter: If hee wil not giue ea
                     •
                  e to thee, nor other (ſaith he) that is to ſay, them that haue giuen him admonition the ſecond time, Let him be thence forth accompted of as an Ethnicke or Publican. Which is as much in vnderſtanding, as if he had neuer receiued the faith. In this degree of ſeueritie, which being duely conſidered is ſharpe enough, Chriſts diſcipline ſtayeth, and proceedeth no further. And this is the Court, theſe be the lawes thereof, and the whole manner of proceeding, wherewith a true Chriſtian man (if there had beene any ſuch among them) ſhould haue contented himſelfe in proceeding againſt his brother being beſide the right way; or againſt any hereſies, of what ſort or condition ſoeuer they be, becauſe Chriſt hath thought them to be ſufficient, and prouided theſe remedies, which the Church hath alwayes vſed from time to time to great profite, in the rooting vp of all hereſies that at any time grew therein. As concerning the putting of heretickes to death, it is like altogether, as if a Phiſician, to the intent to rid the patient of his diſeaſe, ſhould for the nonce rid him alſo of his life. Moreouer, they that doe pretend most of all now adayes the rooting vp of hereſies by ſuch meanes, do not only not attaine thereunto, (for as yet the world is blinded, to take falſhood for truth) but if it were ſo, then by taking away his life, they cut him off from all thoſe meanes and poſſibilities whereby he might attaine his owne ſaluation. For it might very well come to paſſe in time, for aſmuch as Gods judgements

are deepe and incomprehenſible, that the partie continuing aliue, might bee brought into ſome better caſe. But it is to be feared will ſome ſay, leſt he infect others. True it is, and for that conſideration both Chriſt and his Apoſtle commandeth us to 
                  •
               ſchue him, and to cut him off from the body of the Church. But if they would needes proceede farther, and vpon other reaſonable conſiderations puniſh ſuch obstinate perſons more ſeuerely; were not the ordinary magistrate ſufficient to execute the ſame? Doubtleſſe their anſwer will bee this, that the knowledge of hereſies, can in no caſe appertaine to the ſecular magistrates, becauſe they for the most part are ignorant in the holy Scriptures and Eccleſiaſticall affaires: For this is a common ſaying with theſe Fathers that are ſo far ſeen in Gods ſecrets, that neither the knowledge nor determination of matters in religion doe appertaine to the Secular magistrate, as they terme him in deſpight and reproach But I pray you in what reſpect are they themſelues choſen to ſupply thoſe places, and to bee Inquiſitours to determine matters of faith, whereof they are termed the Fathers, or to diſcuſſe hereſies, whereof they are ſaid to ridde the world, being neither learned in Scriptures, nor able to teach the beliefe? For they are thought men good enough for that office if they be Doctors in the ciuill and canon lawes. As for their Diuines (and yet a ſilly diuinitie God knowes) truly ſince the time that the Dominicans were diſplaced thence, (wherof I made mention before) we haue not ſeen any of them execute any ſuch office. Yea, what if ſince that time there hath bin an order taken by the Inquiſitors, and entred into their books, that no Diuine thenceforth ſhould occupy any ſuch place? Now as concerning the ciuil law, ſurely the Inquiſitors do not excell the ſecular magiſtrate; and as for the canon, if a man were neuer ſo well ſeen in it, they cannot deny, but it ſerueth as little to the deciding of matters in religion as the ciuill. How then is it poſsible to be otherwiſe, but that when ſuch ignorant men bee admitted

to determine matters of Religion, as haue no manner of knowledge in the holy Scriptures, ſaue only a little poore skill in the conſtitutions of mans braine, they muſt needs turne ſweet into ſoure, and ſoure into ſweet: call light darkeneſſe, and darkeneſſe light? That is to ſay, in profeſſing themſelues to bee the Patrones of ſaith, roote out all faith, and maintaine monſtrous errours: ſlea the children of God, and cheriſh the children of the diuell: kill the ſeruants of Chriſt, foster, maintaine, and encreaſe the ſeruants of Antichriſt.
            Here they will anſwer vs, that albeit they themſelues can no more judge of matters touching faith, than a blinde man can of colours, yet they take into counſell and commiſſion with them, to debate ſuch matters, divers Diuines, whoſe preſcript rule and order they put in execution, ſpecially Dominicanes, who haue nothing now to doe with the high authoritie and commiſſion of Inquiſition, ſaue only that they are admitted to conſultations, and to the Qualifications of doctrine, as they terme it.
            And here though we examine not narrowly with what quantity of Diuinitie they come furniſhed to this office, yet we may eaſily gheſſe, that being remoued for the cauſes aforeſaid, and thought vnſit for the place, they are not ſince growne much more apt: ſpecially ſeeing beſides their old infirmities, they are grieuouſly ſicke of their ancient ſhame; daily renewed by beholding from a low place, the loftie Tribunall ſeat from whence they are 
                  •
               iſmounted, and are in a perpetuall headach and madneſſe of jealous men, to ſee their aduerſaries enioy the honour which they haue lost. Wherein we report vs to the Inquiſitours themſelues, for no manknoweth better then they, what tokens the poore Dominicanes giue outwardly of the great bile within their breſt full of malitious matter, as oft as they are called to thoſe graue and waightie deliberations: in-ſo-much that it hath perhaps beene thought on, to ſhut them quite out of the Inquiſitours doores.

But goe to, they are peradventure amended ſince. Why might not then the ordinary magiſtrate call the ſame Diuines to the ſame conſultations? Now to appoint any man iudge of matters which hee vnderſtandeth not, whereby he muſt needs hang altogether of other mens opinions and ſentences whatſoeuer they bee, what an iniquitie is this? What a peruerting of all law and iuſtice? Who therefore can maruell, if when we ſee the Holy Inquiſition ſit in her heauenly Tribunall ſeat, we ſay with Salomon, I haue ſeen vngodlineſſe ſit in the ſeat of iudgement, and iniquitie in the place of iuſtice? And yet notwithſtanding all this, what libertie and prerogatiue they will allow themſelues, in the very ſame matters which they puniſh in others, as the higheſt points of herefie, you may behold in the example following.
            It happened a few yeares paſſed, in Barchinon a very famous Citie in the teritory of Cathalonia, that when they ſhould march forward in their proceſsion on corpus Chriſti day to carry the Maſſe bread about, and all things were ready, requiſite to ſo ſolemne a ſhew, euen as the Prieſt that had danced the Tragicall high Maſſe, ſhould couch the bleſſed hoſt in the golden pixe, as the Diuell would haue it, it was too great a compaſſe to be put in the boxe. All men were amaſed: the whole ſhew ſtaied: there was not a man in that great and notable aſſembly that knew what to doe, in a caſe ſo ſtrange and ſo vnlocked for. Now ſurely it was a ſport alone, and a ieſt worthy ſo great a company.
            Some perhaps of the wiſer ſort, ſaw no way but one to help at a pinch; namely to begin a new Maſſe in Gods name and with better lucke, and to ſhape a cake fit for the boxe. But that was too late: for the proceſsion had farre to goe, and it was too too much paines to defer it any longer. And beſides, perchance there was neuer a ſir Iohn there but had broke his faſt well, the better to take paine
                  •
                in ſo great a ſolemnity. And tho the Diuines were of opinion that hee that

ſang the high Maſſe, might diſpatch another in caſe of neceſſitie, yet he good ſoule looking for nothing leſſe then ſuch a chance, had already ſupt vp the rinſing of the Chalice, as his dutie was to doe. Well ſir, there was one of the Inquiſitours, a man of Arragon, whoſe name was Molonio. This Gentleman being as haſtie by nature, as bold by authoritie, made no more adoe, but tooke a paire of ciſſours, and pared his maker where he was ouergrowne, and ſo by a little paring, put both him in the boxe, and the people out of doubt. Some perhaps will praiſe this mans preſent wit in ſo great a difficultie: others will abhorre and deteſt his godleſſe and raſh boldneſſe: others will bewaile and lament the hard fortune of their God ſo to be pared and circumciſed by the curſed hands of a cruell Inquiſitour. But good Lord, if any other had beene ſo ſaucie but an Inquiſitor, ſpecially if he had had any Iewes blood in him, how would they haue handled him trow you? Indeed Molonio was put out of office: but he tarried not many dayes ere he was ſent to be Inquiſitour at Siuil, for they might not loſe ſo ſtout a ſouldier of the Inquiſition for a trifle. What ſhould we here talke of the Popes authoritie? they extoll and abaſe him: they adore him and contemn him: they reuenge his wrong and doe him wrong, euen as hee ſerueth or hindreth their holy office. Wee purpoſe not to proſecute theſe matters any further, meaning only to touch them in way of Preface, to declare by what beginnings and occaſions the Inquiſition is growne: what antiquitie and holineſſe it carryeth: and what profite it hath brought to the world vnder the title of reforming religion. Theſe things being as we haue declared them, ſo true in deed, and ſuch in qualitie, as no honeſt man can either plainely denie them, or juſtly excuſe them, no man ought to maruell if the people, which haue otherwiſe hitherto beene moſt dutifully obedient to their Magiſtrates, to driue ſo horrible a peſtilence from their countrie, haue be taken themſelues to their weapons and defence of armes, as hauing none other more reaſonable

meanes to helpe themſelues.
            They protest, that they ſeeke not to auoide the reformation of religion, which they heartily wiſh for, ſo that it be ſuch a one as is worthy of ſo good a name, and bee directed by the preſcript word of God, which ought to be the onely rule of religion, to all that loue true religion. And in that behalfe, what can they hope for of the Inquiſition, beſides that it hath already yeelded? They protest further, that they owe to their lawfull gouernours, and that by the expreſſe word of God, obedience, honour, and tribute, the which they are moſt ready to performe with their accuſtomed chearefulneſſe and hearty good will. Only they humbly pray and beſeech, that it may be taken of them without the diſhonour of God, and the most miſerable capti
                  •
               itie and thraldome of their conſciences, the which ought to bee more recommended, and deare to good and godly men, then their very liues. They protest beſides, that they will not any manner of wayes ſhake off the yoake of juſt obedience to their Magiſtrates, but they complaine, (and that not without great cauſe) that beſides the eaſie and gentle yoke which they haue hitherto borne with that meekeneſſe of heart that became them, they are ſcourged with the Iron whips of the Inquiſition, which ſeeketh nothing but the ſlaughter of innocent Citizens, and the confiſcation and ſpoile of their goods. They might haue in times paſt with ſome colour blamed the men of Arragon, which receiued not the Inquiſition without tumult and bloudſhed, for it was then couered with that goodly and freſh name, and ſhew of holineſſe: neither as yet had it raged against all indifferently, but only against the Iewes and Moores, and that alſo for very plauſible and apparant cauſes. But now ſince it hath not ceaſed to bring forth ſuch fruites, as wee haue rehearſed for theſe threeſcore and fifteene yeares: I thinke they ſhall not ſeeme to be madde, that ſeeke by all meanes to them poſſible, to driue it from their borders. Nay, they might rather be truly judged to bee madde men,

if in ſtead of their faithfull fathers, and good ſhepheards and preachers of true religion they would wittingly and willingly receiue into their houſes the very enemies, and moſt cruell deſtroyers of all faith and religion. And if there be any that know them not to bee ſuch as wee terme them, let them read but part of their ſleights and manner of proceedings diſcouered in this booke, (for wee could not learne them all,) and let them well waigh and conſider them, and then judge.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            A DISCOVERY AND plaine declaration of ſundry policies practiſed in the Spaniſh Inquiſition.
            
               CHAP. I.
               
                  The ordinary manner and forme commonly vſed as well in cyting, as apprehending ſuch perſons aS are accuſed.
               
               
                  WHenſoeuer any denunciation (as they terme it) or rather information is giuen againſt any perſon, be it onely for matters of no great importance (as nothing commeth into this court ſo ſmall or ſimple, but the parties accuſed are very greatly endamaged thereby) the Inquiſitors accuſtomably vſe this kind of practice. Firſt, they ſuborne ſome one out of a number, ſuch as have learned their leſſons for the nonce (commonly called Familiars) who of purpoſe The Inquiſitors Familiars. ſhall caſt himſelfe to meet one, and being prouided afore hand what to ſay, ſhall greet him on this wiſe. Sir, yeſterday, it was my chance to bee with my Lords the Inquiſitors, and as they happened to have ſpeech of you, they ſaid they had to talke with you about certain of their affaires, and therfore gaue me in charge to ſummon you to appeare before them to morrow at ſuch an hour. Now the party may not (being once warned) either refuſe or differre to come, but at his very great perill. Whereupon the next day hee repaireth to the place where the Commiſsioners ſit, and requireth the porter to ſignifie vnto the Lords that he is come. Whereof as ſoon as they haue intelligence, all three (if they be preſent) or at leaſt two of them, meet in a Counſell chamber where the Court is commonly kept, as at Siuil; in the caſtle Triana, and

ſuch like places elſe where in other Cities abroad, and calling the party in before them, they demand of him what his ſute is. Who anſwereth, that yeſterday he The Court and priſon of the Inquiſiti
                        ••
                     , was warned vnder their precept to come and ſpeake with them. Then inquire they his name; and that knowne, what he would: for as for vs (ſay they) we wot not whether you be the ſame man that we commanded to be here with vs, yea or no. Marry now ſithens you are come, if you have any thing to enforme vs of in this holy Court either of your ſelfe or of any other, in diſcharge of your conſcience (man) let vs hear it. Wherunto the party either anſwereth that he hath no ſuch matters to enforme them of (as indeed to ſtand vpon that point to the end with them, who ſeeke nothing els but his vndoing and ſuch as he ſhall appeach; is the wiſeſt &amp; ſafeſt way that may be taken) or els of meere ſimplicity, not knowing how he entangleth himſelfe, raſhly &amp; vnaduiſedly vttereth ſome thing of himſelfe or of ſome other. Then my Lords the Inquiſitors glad that they haue caught him, to the intent the more eaſily to fear and amaſe him that thus fooliſhly hath made himſelfe ſo fit a morſell for them to prey vpon, caſt lookes one at another, and reioycing as though they had ſmelled the rat, all at once fix their eyes vpon him, and behold him earneſtly: and whiſpering together a little while (Iwot not whether they ſay ought or nought) at the laſt either award the party to priſon, if the matter that he diſcloſeth of himſelfe ſeem any thing waighty, or if he chance to confeſſe nothing at all, they will him to depart, pretending that they know not, without better information, whether hee bee the ſame party whom they commanded to come before them or no. Whilſt the party is thus in examination, prouiſion is made that the promoter who gaue information againſt him, is ſecretly hidden behind ſome tapiſtry, where hee cannot

be ſeen; yet ſo, as he may ſee the parties face, and know if it be the ſame man, or no, if haply the Inquiſitors know him not. Then licence they him to depart, being aſſured that it is he which ſhall miniſter matter for this tragedy, and perhaps call him not before them of 2. or 3. moneths after, ſpecially if he be there inhabitant: for if he be a forreiner, they lightly giue him not ſo great reſpit. The next time, when their pleaſure is to ſend for him, they exhort him againe, that if he know or haue heard any thing that concerneth their holy Court, to diſcloſe it vnto them. For we know right well (ſay they) that you haue dealt with certain perſons ſuſpected in religion; which if you will confeſſe of your own accord, aſſure your ſelfe you ſhall receiue no harme: therefore we charge you take heed and looke well to your ſelfe. Our opinion is of you, that like a good Chriſtian man, you will call to your remembrance ſuch things as are by-paſt: for indeed a mans memory is weak (we wot well) and may fail him, and therfore it may be you haue forgotten, and faine would tell all you know if you could call it to mind. By theſe and ſuch like ſubtilties they abuſe many ſilly ſoules, or els diſmiſſe them for that time: yet ſo, as they ſhall not think themſelues cleerly diſcharged; but to keep them continually occupied and vnquieted in their minds, and to make them ſtand in daily fear &amp; awe of them, tell them it may be they ſhall haue further matter againſt them, and occaſion to call them againe. Yet ſometime it hapneth that they beare with ſome perſon, and winke at him many dayes, and with ſome whole yeares, ere they cauſe him to be apprehended, alwayes prouided, that he ſhall haue one or other of theſe iolly mates to keepe him company whereſoeuer he go, and waite vpon him at an inch to creepe into his boſome, and grope his conſcience: who vnder the colour of friendſhip and familiarity, very craftily and ſubtilly, whilſt he good man thinkes no harme, ſhall daily come and viſite him, and haue an eye to all his doings, &amp; mark

with whom he conferreth, where hee vſeth to reſort, what he doth there, and, as nigh as may be, whereabouts he goeth and what he intendeth: in ſo much that without the ſpeciall ayde of Gods holy prouidence, it is not poſſible for a man to eſcape their ſnares. Now if any of the Inquiſitors chance to meet any ſuch perſons ſo diſmiſſed, they ſalute him very courteouſly, and ſhew him a good countenance, promiſing to ſtand his good friend. All which courteous kind of entertainement tendeth to none other end but to make the man more careleſſe of his eſtate, and ſo to vndoe him ere he be aware. But what good (I pray you) can they getby get by theſe deteſtable and abominable ſleights, except perhaps they vſe them for their recreation, and take like pleaſure in them as doth the fouler in his paſtime, when hee playeth and dallieth with his game: or the fiſher, who after he hath ſtricken the fiſh, ſuffreth her to play with the line, and to ſport her ſelfe for a time that will ſcarfely laſt the turning of her taile: or as the catte that playeth with the mouſe, after ſhe hath giuen him ſome priuy pinch, leaving him at large, and hunting him afreſh, and by and by teareth him with her teeth, and eateth vp euery morſell? Wherein it may be that ſome ſecret myſtery lies hid, which all the world perceiues not, nor altogether without gain to theſe holy Officers. Howbeit this kind of dallying with their prey, they vſe not with euery body alike, in ſuch ſort as is before declared. For they haue very great reſpect of perſons and cauſes in this behalf. Which is a plain token that they deal not in this ſort either with ſuch ſtrangers or town-dwellers as they thinke are like to eſcape from them by this liberty, neither yet with ſuch as are charged with great matters, whom they thinke needfull to be ſeen vnto betimes, ſpecially if there be any hope that by their confeſſion they ſhall haue intelligence of

any other. But firſt, when they are determined to apprehend any perſon that is accuſed, they vſe to ſend for the Biſhops deputy of that dioceſſe or Ordinary (as they call him) and making him priuy to the depoſitions of the witneſſes againſt the party accuſed (which they call an Information) after a little conſultation had with him of the matter, they all ſubſcribe to a writing, which is a warrant directed from them to attach him: which kind of dealing ſeemeth to haue a ſhew of good equity. Forſooth they wil not bee thought to touch any of another mans flocke without th'aduiſe &amp; conſent of his own Paſtor, who being full ignorant &amp; vnskilfull (God knows) in the duty of a Paſtor (as commonly all of that coat vnder Papacy are) is brought to giue his conſent, that the ſheep ouer whom he hath a ſpeciall charge, ſhall firſt be fleeced, &amp; afterward miſerably ſlain, &amp; bereft of goods &amp; life. For as yet there hath neuer any breach bin heard of about theſe matters betwixt the Inquiſitors and the Ordinary for defending any of his flocke that hath been by them ſent to execution. Yet may a man ſee oftētimes, yea daily almoſt, great numbers dy in priſon, ſome hunger-ſteru'd, ſome extreamly racked and diſmembred in euery ioynt of their bodies, ſome euen in the midſt of their torments yeelding vp the Ghoſt betwixt the tormentors hands (as I will not faile hereafter to declare, when I ſhall be occaſioned to treate therof more conueniently) inſomuch that the Inquiſitors wil ſay of ſome of them, that they were as harmleſſe men, and as innocent, and put to death as wrongfully as any men could be. Wherby it is euident, that this ſending for the Ordinary to confer withall, about the apprehending of ſome vnder his cure, is a very vaine thing, and rather a fooliſh ceremony, than a matter ſerious or done of any iuſtice. And to tell the plaine truth, their manner is to bid the Ordinary to a banquet to quaffe his part of the Banquet. blood of his owne ſheepe, that the wolues may continue the faſter friends. Our Lord Chriſt, the great ſhepheard of the ſheepe, come when hee ſeeth his time,

and render to each of them according to their owne deſerts. Yet ſometimes it hapneth, that they call not the Ordinary to counſell, before the party be both accuſed and apprehended. For being well aſſured that hee will not gainſay them, nor controule any of their doings, they thinke it enough when the party is faſt &amp; forthcomming, then to declare to the Ordinary the occaſion and manner of their proceedings: who hearing it read vnto him, liketh very well thereof, aſwell that they haue already done, as is alſo content with whatſoeuer els they can deuiſe to do. Now if any that is accuſed doe chance to make an eſcape, either before he be apprehended or after, then vſe they all deuices that may be to find him and fetch him againe. Neither is it ſufficient that they giue the ſearchers certain common ſigns and tokens to know him by, as to deſcribe his apparell, his countenance, age, &amp;c. but they draw his counterfaite as liuely as may be in Counterfaits ſundry patternes, and diſtribute them among the ſearchers, to know the party the more eaſily by, whom perhaps they neuer ſaw in all their liues: whereof I will report you a true tale for example.
               Not long agone they apprehended a certain Italian at Siuil, who had wounded one of the Paratours on a time being at Rome, commonly called the Inquiſitors Alguazil. And albeit the Familiars that were ſent to ſeeke him, The Alguazil is in manner of a Sheriffe. had his counterfaite about them, as they vſe to haue: yet notwithſtanding hapning vpon him at Siuil, and halfe in doubt whether it were he or no, becauſe hee had altered his apparell, and of purpoſe changed his name, they purſued him a good while onely of a bare ſuſpicion, which they had by his countenance that it ſhould be he. Therefore one day as he was walking and talking with diuers in the Cathedral Church at Siuil, they foūd out this new deuice to attempt him withall, ſeemely for ſuch Familiars. Two or three of them came ſomewhat nigh about him, and as he hapned to turne in his walke; his backe being

towards them, on a ſuddaine one of them calleth him by his old name. The party being in earneſt talke, and miſtruſting nothing, ſuddenly looked behind him, &amp; made anſwer: whereupon the catchpoles forthwith laid hands on him, and were cleerely reſolued that hee was the ſelfe ſame man. This fellow lay in yrons a good ſeaſon, and after long impriſonment was whipped about the towne, and condemned to the gally perpetually. and thus was he ſerued for hurting the Alguazil, partly through his owne folly and negligence for want of a little heede taking. The which deuices albeit they be very ſubtile, and ſuch as no mans wiſedome can auoide, yet ſhall it not be greatly amiſſe to ſhew one other ſpecial example, how God oftentimes maketh them ſtarke fooles, and guardeth his with a holy kind of policy, that they may bee able to goe an ace beyond them. Not long ſince there was a certaine man of the Low Countries that had eſcaped out of the Inquiſitors priſon at Valladolit, who was apprehē
                  ded for the profeſſion of the Goſpell, and had bin a long ſeaſon in priſon. There went out to ſeeke him (as the cuſtome is) diuers of theſe hunting Familiars, who within a few leagues off, ouertooke him in the high way, and ſtayed him. The party told them flatly hee was not the man The Fiſcal. they tooke him for; and yet would not theſe good fellowes leaue him, but by force and ſtrong hand went about to bind and bring him backe againe, ſtill contrarying him, affirming him to be the ſelfe-ſame man whom they tooke him to be: and thereupon demanded of him, not doubtingly, but as though the matter were very cleere; Are not you he (Sir) that eſcaped out of the Inquiſitors priſon at Valladolit, about eight dayes ſince? Not I (Sirs) ſaith he, ſetting a good face on the matter, and therefore view me better. I am no ſuch man, but am newly come from Castile, where I haue wrought in mine occupation a great while: and becauſe you ſhall the better credit my words, and know it to be ſo, here is my teſtimoniall

which I carry for my paſport, take and reade it: and forthwith tooke out a certaine writing which he had about him, and offred it them to read. Which, after they had read it, they gaue credit vnto, and let him goe with ſhame enough that they had been ſo childiſhly deceiued in taking one man for another, as to their thinking they had done. And as touching the teſtimoniall that ſtood him in ſo good ſteed, this is the truth of it. After his departure out of priſon, making as much ſpeed in his iourney as poſſibly he could, he chanced to meete with a countrey man of his by the way, one of his old acquaintance 
                     
                        •
                     tho. newly come from Castile, and to helpe himſelfe withall in this diſtreſſe, found meanes to obtaine his paſport, which beyond both their expectations, as God Paſport. would haue it (a thing ſo appointed by his ſecret prouidence) did ſerue this mans turne, and ſaued him from ſo great a perill. For the other was departed from him but two dayes before, and left his teſtimoniall behind him in this mans hand to keepe: whereby he was in good time preſerued, and they colted like knaues very prettily. Yet haue theſe Familiars another fetch beyond all this, to retriue them that are eſcaped and fled away. As, ſome of them ſhall trace him by his footing if they can finde his foot-ſteps: others ſhall purſue him that way whither they thinke in their owne iudgements hee is moſt like to bee gone: another crew of them ſhall lye in waite for him by night, becauſe they are ſure he will trauell by night rather than by day. For I tell you, they are moe than a good ſort that are appointed for theſe purpoſes; inſomuch that a flie cannot eſcape the Inquiſitors fingers, but there ſhall be enow at hand ready to fetch her againe. But God, againſt all their deuices and narrow ſearching diligence, ſhall arme and ſafegard him, whom his good will and pleaſure is to deliuer. And thus much concerning the apprehending. Now to tell how they entreate them after they be arreſted and committed to ward,
            
            
               
               CHAP. II.
               
                  The Sequeſtration of their goods commonly called the Sequeſter.
                  
               
               IMmediately after euery arreſt done by the Alguazil, or complaint made to the court of any perſon by any of the Familiars, they ſtraightway take from about him all the keyes of his cheſts or lockes whatſoeuer, if he haue any, and forthwith ſend a Notary and certaine catchpoles with the Alguazil himſelfe to take an inuentory of all ſuch goods as are in his houſe whatſoeuer they be. Which being done very exactly, ſuch as they finde, they leaue in the cuſtody of ſome rich man dwelling thereabout, who vndertaketh to be accomptable therefore, and to re-deliuer them duly and truly whenſoeuer they ſhall be demanded. But in this Sequester (as they terme it) the owners of ſuch goods had need to looke well about them, and alwayes haue an eye to their fingers which are at the ſequeſtration, and are the doers, ſpecially when they come to rifling of money and iewels, either gold or ſiluer, or any other thing els that is of any price, and light for conueiance, or will lye in a narrow roome. For they are commonly limefingred, and willightly make ſomething ſticke by them, if they be not narrowly ſeene vnto. And indeed the greater part of this rabble of Familiars are bauds, theeues, ſhifters, and the vileſt ſort of people that liue only by filching, which cannot, nor will not hold their hands if they ſhould hang for it. Beſides that, they are perſuaded in conſcience, that they ſhould not in ſuch caſes forbeare other mens goods, although they haue no manner of right thereto.
               Now to tell you briefly whereto this ſequeſtration tendeth. Forſooth, that if it happen the party be condemned, ſo that his goods or any part thereof be confiſcate, this holy houſe I warrant you will not loſe ſo much as a dodkin of them. For who knoweth not thus much, that the prey and ſpoyles of ſuch ſilly ſoules is all that they ſeek for? els what ſhould theſe holy fathers that reſpect nothing but

vertue and godlineſſe, doe with their goods (I pray you) whom they beare vs in hand they would ſo faine bring home againe to the right way? Or who is ſo mad to think that misbelief can be amended by loſſe of lands or goods? Yet it may very well beſeeme Chriſtian men to be ſpoyled of all their ſubſtance, yea, and of their clothes from their backs alſo, by their enemies, ſeeing their head, whoſe members they are, and whoſe truth they profeſſe, was ſo ſerued: for whoſe garments (likewiſe) not much worth, perhaps halfe thread bare with wearing, after they had put him moſt cruelly to death, they determined alſo to caſt lots. And this kind of Sacriledge is now ſo ratified and confirmed by the common conſent of their Diuines, that is to ſay, the Monkes and the reſidue of the Clergy, that they ſhame not to preach &amp; teach openly, that whoſoeuer is not iumpe with the Pope, or diſſenteth from him in the leaſt iot, is bound in conſcience, in all haſt (ſay they) to bring in all his goods into the Kings Eſchecquer, and that he hath no more right vnto them then if he had robbed the King of them before, alleadging this reaſon, that for ſo much as he is reuolted from the Church of Rome, he is no longer any right owner thereof, but the King, to whom the Pope hath adiudged them. Wherefore a man is bound (ſay they) to reſtore them vnto him, although the Inquiſitors neuer heard ſo much as one word of him. And thus theſe ſubtill foxes by this one policy are both greatly gracious with Princes, and therewithall doe inueigle the conſciences, &amp; pick the purſes of the ſilly fooliſh people, deeming them as gods. But to returne to our purpoſe. As ſoon as the priſoner is entred within the firſt gate of y•
                   priſon, the keeper hauing with him a Notary, aſketh him if he haue a knife about him, or mony, or rings or any other iewels. And if it be a womā that hath a ſheath of ſmall kniues at her girdle, rings, little chains, bracelets, ouches, or any other ornaments, ſuch as women weare, they ſtrip them of all theſe, &amp; commonly they be his fees

that findeth them. This is done to this end, that the priſoners during the time of their impriſonment ſhall haue nothing to ſuccor themſelues withal any waies. They ſearch them alſo, le

                   they bring in priuily about them any writing, or book, or any other ſuch like thing. But after they be once entred into priſon, they are ſhut vp in a cloſe cabbayne, where they haue ſcarſely good elbow-roome, for cleanlines and lightſomnes not much vnlike to Litle

Some againe haue fellowes and companions from the very firſt day of their impriſonment, as the Lords Inquiſitors will, and as they thinke moſt conuenient to bring their matters about.

                  The ſeuerall dayes of hearing.
               
               AFter they haue thus continued in priſon about a week or two, the Inquiſitors priuily packe with the Iaylor to be in hand with the priſoner, as though it came from himſelfe, and to aduiſe him to ſue that he may come to his anſwer, and pray to haue a day of hearing. Wherein, it is not to be thought the contrary, but that there is ſome miſtery meant thereby, that the priſoner muſt firſt begin to ſtir in his owne cauſe. The keeper therefore either at dinner time, or ſome other moſt conuenient to bring his matters about, reſorteth to his priſoner, and among other talke, at the laſt falleth to queſtion with him how it hapneth that he ſ

                  th him to labour it with as much ſpeede as may be, making him beleeue, the ſooner the better, and that it will much further his cauſe ſo to do, and at the length bring his ſute to ſome good effect: Adding moreouer, that for the acquaintance which he hath with him, in the way of friendſhip hee is mooued to giue him the beſt counſell he can, &amp; ſuch as is meeteſt for his behoofe, promiſing to do &amp; deale for him

therein to his power, like a faithfull and truſty friend. Yet ſurely it may be thought with good reaſon, that if any thing may doe the poore wretch good, being in caſe ready for to be deuoured by theſe rauenous beaſts, it will fall out in the end to be better for him if he refuſe to craue a day of hearing, and tarry till the Commiſſioners doe call for him. But if there be none other good to be done, hee may chance to get this by his tarrying; in driuing them to begin with him, to take care for nothing but only to make anſwer to their obiections. But ſith it is ſo ſecret a myſtery, I will let it goe, and leaue it to the iudgements and conſiderations of the wiſer ſort to ſcan and iudge vpon. The poore priſoner knowing none of theſe ſubtilties, for the moſt part is ruled by his keeper, thinking that he hath giuen him good and wholeſome aduice, and prayeth him therefore to be a meane for him, and in his behalf to craue a day of hearing: whoſe ſute is eaſily heard of the Inquiſitor, and granted at the firſt I warrant you. Whereupon the party is brought into the Conſiſtory, where the Inquiſitor, as though he were altogether ignorant of the matter, beginneth to talke with him much after this ſort: Sirha, your keeper came and told vs, that you were deſirous to come to your anſwer. Now ſay on, what is your ſute? The priſoner anſwereth, that he would be very glad to haue his matter heard. And vnleſſe he look well about him, and be circumſpect in his dealing, very lothſomneſſe of his impriſonment, and fear of afterclaps, driueth him to confeſſe ſomewhat whereof he ſuſpecteth himſelfe to be accuſed. The which thing doth the Fathers good at their hearts, becauſe they are accuſtomed at this and ſundry other ſeaſons, to grant the priſoners dayes of hearing, and to call them often into the Court before they ſhall know their whole accuſation, and all that is depoſed againſt them (which by order and common courſe of law ſhould haue beene the firſt act that ſhould haue beene done againſt them) and all is to this onely end, to make the party

vtter ſomewhat of himſelfe raſhly and vnawares, that they as yet know not of. They aduiſe him moreouer to let it come from himſelfe, promiſing that if hee will acknowledge his faults voluntarily, he ſhall be foorthwith ſent home againe to his owne houſe, and bee diſpatched with all expedition, and dealt withall as gently as may be. But if for all theſe vaine and flattering promiſes he hold them hard, and ſtand mute (as indeede it is beſt for him) they charge him earneſtly to disburden his owne conſcience: and when he hath bethought himſelfe, and is diſpoſed to confeſſe any thing, that then he ſhould ſue to come to his anſwer, ſaying that in the meane time, they will conſider of his caſe, and ſo they remand him to priſon. Then after 6. or 8. dayes or mo, as they thinke good, they call for him againe, and aske him if as yet he be determined to confeſſe ought. The priſoner anſwereth, either that he hath nothing to ſay, but that he is innocent, or perhaps confeſſeth ſomewhat. But whatſoeuer his anſwer be, they are ſure ſtill harping on their old ſtring, vrging him to diſcharge his conſcience, and perſwading him that they goe about no other thing but to doe him good, and to procure his ſafety, of very loue and meere compaſſion which they take vpon him. Which gentleneſſe of theirs, and well meaning towards him, if he refuſe now, and ſet light by, he ſhall finde them ſharpe Iuſticers hencefoorth if the Fiſcall informe againſt him, and ſo ſend him againe to priſon. The Fiſcall is an officer which taketh all ſuch accuſations as the Promoters bring vnto him, and by office is the onely pleader, during the whole time that the cauſes be hanging, as it were the Kings Atturney, hauing his name no doubt à Fiſco, that is to ſay, the Eſchecquer: for whoſe aduantage he is altogether, and from whence hee is anſwered his fee.
               At the third day of audience, the party is called for againe, and demanded, if yet hee be reſolued what to doe, with earneſt requeſt after their accuſtomed maner, to confeſſe

a troth of his owne accord: if not, they threaten to vſe extremity towards him, and what they can do by law. And here they vnderſtand by this word law, extreme tormenting and mangling of men, yea ſuch as their owne owne lawes doe prooue very Innocents, ſaying hee may well aſſure himſelfe, that no man ſhall ſuſtaine any iniury within their holy Office, and that their faſhion is not to trouble any man but vpon good and ſufficient information againſt him, with ſuch like talke. Howbeit, if the party happen to diſcloſe any thing: nay (ſay they) yet are we not ſatisfied, we haue not all you can ſay, we ſuſpect you keepe ſomething in of purpoſe, and ſo ſend him to priſon, putting him to further paine, and calling him coram day by day, as they perceiue that by theſe means they wring more &amp; more out of him, though it be but by little &amp; little. But if he ſtand ſtoutely in the matter, giuing them direct anſwer that he hath nought to ſay in that place, by a ſhift of deſcant (as it were) they try him another way, exacting an oth of him: &amp; to the intent to proue his zeal, they hold him an Idol, repreſenting the crucifixe, couered with a blacke lawn, &amp; certain other Idols, I wot not what. They do alſo lay before him a Maſſe book or a Miſſall, and ſometime the bare image of the croſſe. For ſuch deuices and fooliſh toyes as theſe be, they haue alwaies in a readines to vſe as occaſion ſerueth, &amp; as they think moſt requiſit, reſpecting the party whom they are to deal withall. Here is the Chriſtian man driuen into a narrow ſtreight, ſo that he muſt needs vtter himſelf, and plainly ſhew what he is in conſcience and in belief. For if he be a faithfull man indeed, and one that from the bottom of his heart abhorres Idolatry, hauing before his eies the fear of God moſt mighty &amp; iealous, which in his moſt holy law hath reſerued this glory to himſelf, that we ſhould ſwear by him alone, he will beware that in no wiſe he giue part therof to ſuch vile Idols of wood or mettall; which being made to reſemble the higheſt in ſhape, are ſo much the more abominable in the

ſight of God, and of his congregation. Therefore a godly man will take heed of ſuch a wicked and vngodly oath, yea though he were to be torne in pieces preſently, ſeeing they be very Idols, and not God, to whom alone that honour belongeth, as the Inquiſitours themſelues cannot ſay to the contrary. After they haue thus put him to his oath, they begin to examine him vpon theſe interrogat

                  : What countrey man hee is, and vnder whoſe allegeance. Of what Prouince or Dioceſſe. In what city, town, or village he dwelleth. Who were his anceſtors, &amp; what their names were. What brethren or ſiſters he hath. What his father and mother were, and what were their names: how they liued, and by what trade and occupation. If he, or any of his kindred at any time haue beene conuented before the Inquiſitours, and vpon what occaſions. Moreouer, many other things they inquire of him; as of his age, and trade of life, where and with what manner of men he hath been moſt conuerſant: and thus is he ſorced to giue a ſtraight account of his whole life, where he hath paſſed his time yearly, and made his moſt abode, anſwering to euery point by it ſelfe ſeuerally. For out of each of theſe queſtions they fetch no ſmall arguments, wherewith they charge the poore ſoule afterward too too pittifully. When he hath anſwered to all theſe by-queſtions, then fal they afreſh to their old exhortation, ſometime by faire meanes, and ſometime by foule, aduiſing him to tell the truth frankely, aſſuring him, that they neuer cauſe any to bee arreſted without iuſt cauſe why, or without ſufficient witneſſes: ſo that whether he confeſſe or no, away he goeth to priſon againe.
               And in theſe three firſt times of hearing, a great ſort are either allured with their faire ſpeeches and promiſes, that they ſhall bee ſent home to ther owne houſes as ſoone as they will confeſſe that that is demanded of them; or elſe of very awe and feare of their euill and menacing words, vtter many things whereof the Inquiſitors

knew not one iot before, becauſe none had informed them thereof, but themſelues onely ſuſpected, leſt they had been accuſed by ſome, with whom they had dealt heretofore in ſuch affaires. Thus betraying themſelues like fooles, they bring other men into as euill caſe as themſelues, which perhaps neither feared any ſuch matter at all, nor the Inquiſitors had euer heard any thing of them before. But moſt of all, when they perceiue that theſe moſt holy Fathers, who hunt after nothing ſo much, as daily to haue change of ſpoyles, will take it thankefully at their hands, then labour they by all meanes poſſible to curry fauour with them, to get themſelues rid out of miſery, and to be ſet at liberty: So that it commeth oftentimes to paſſe, that the parties being at the firſt arreſted for very trifling matters, vndoe both themſelues and many others moe, by giuing ouer-much credit to the fair promiſes and goodly gloſes of theſe falſe and faithleſſe Inquiſitors, through want of skill how to behaue themſelues in their owne affaires, much leſſe able to iudge and diſcerne what opinion they ſhould haue of theſe Fathers, that is to ſay, not to be fathers (as they glory to be called in deriſion of all humanity, piety, and fatherlineſſe) but their moſt cruell and deadly enemies, which by craft, ſubtilty, and lying, and by all kind of knaueries, priuily goe about to get that they gape for, both life and goods of the guilty, and of the guiltleſſe. Againſt all which ſnares of theirs, there is one onely way of auoydance, to wit, that he whoſe deſtinie it is (I meane by Gods ordinance and appointment) to fall into their hands, beleeue neuer a word they ſay, promiſe A generall Cau

                     . they neuer ſo fairly; nor be afraid of them, threat or thunder they neuer ſo terribly: hauing alwaies before his eyes the loue and dread of him, who after hee hath killed the body, hath power alſo ouer the ſoule to ſend it to hell fire; and hauing numbred the very haires of our head to the vttermoſt, will not ſuffer the leaſt of them to periſh or fall to the ground without his good pleaſure and prouidence.

The next leſſon is to keep his tongue for his life, &amp; ſpeake not one word till the time that he hath heard his accuſation, with the depoſitions, whereunto he is bound by order of law to make anſwer.
               Furthermore, at the fourth day of hearing, they tender him an oath, vehemently exhorting him to ſhriue himſelfe voluntarily: otherwiſe they will deale with him as hardly as the law will permit them, if the Fiſcall once commence his ſute againſt him. And if he do yet perſeuere conſtantly, affirming that he hath no more to ſay, then reade they vnto him a long inditement, &amp; charge him with many great matters, falſely forged and deuiſed againſt him, ſuch as neither the party did euer ſo much as thinke vpon, nor any had accuſed him of to them. For it is a point of cunning forſooth in this their crafty faculty, for the Fathers to make theſe great matters and huge offices on their fingers ends for theſe ſpecial cauſes. Firſt, by thus loading the poor man, and laying to his charge many great and made matters, to bring him into ſuch a maze, that being ſcarcely his owne man, he ſhall not well know where he is, nor which way to turne him, nor what anſwer to make. Secondarily, to prooue if happely he will admit any of theſe miſdemeanors that are laid againſt him, or at the leaſt, if by argument about any of them they can trippe him in his tale, and ſo catch him in their net. Is this then their following of Gods iudgements, whoſe cauſe theſe Fathers of the faith brag and boaſt ſo much, and beare the ſilly ignorant people in hand, that they take vpon them to maintaine, in the very firſt ſteppe of the ſtage, whereon they are ready bent to do execution of a ſort of innocents, thus ſhamefully and mockingly to cry, Ariſe (O Lord) and iudge thine owne cauſe? Do Pſal. 74. theſe policies proceede of faith (trowe ye) where of they tearme themſelues the Patrons? Did euer any true Patrons of faith either teach them to other, or els vſe them themſelues? Are theſe the moſt direct meanes to bring him into the right way, that of meere ignorance and ſimplicity hath

gone aſtray from the truth and word of God, or to teach the vnlearned, or to correct and amend him, who hath erred and fallen of common infirmity? Or are they not rathermore likely to be the ſnares of Satā, practiſed frō time to time by contentious and diuelliſh people, priuily laid to ſupplant a poore man withall, and very ſtumbling blockes craftily and maliciouſly caſt for the nonce, to make him breake not onely his ſhinnes, but his neck alſo, that plainely and ſimply ſhall paſſe thereby, and lookes not warily to his footing? And who would haue thought (I pray you) that theſe holy Fathers would haue buſied themſelues in making ſuch mouſe-traps, and ſetting ſuch pitfals? But how many good Chriſtians haue fallen into theſe ſnares, to the great perill both of their bod

                  es and ſoules onely by the deteſtable meanes of theſe peſtilent and pernicious Tyrants, Chriſt the ſearcher of ſecrets, and chiefe Inquiſitor ouer all at his generall doome, ſitting in his ſeat of Maieſty, will one day make manifeſt.
               As touching their accuſations, the great and principall The Inquiſitors generall obiection. matters wherewith they burden euery one that commeth within their iuriſdiction, be theſe: Firſt, for that he being baptized, &amp; vnder the obedience of the Church of Rome, forſaking her profeſſion and doctrine, is become one of Luthers diſciples, by admitting and harbouring his hereſies in his heart; and yet not content therewithall to be an heretike himſelfe, hath prouoked and poyſoned others by teaching &amp; preaching the ſame hereſies vnto them. And to this effect well neare, they vſe many big words to make the ſimple folke afraid withall. Next to this, they charge them alſo with other matters, ſometime of more importance, ſometime of leſſe: Prouided alwayes, that the matter wherof the party is accuſed, be brought in, either in the beginning or ending, or elſe ſome other thing that ſome man hath him half in a iealouſie for. Which thing they lay to his charge, not as a matter ſurmiſed or of likelihood, but moſt conſtantly affirmed and teſtified by witneſſes. For in this

holy Conſiſtory they may do what they liſt, and what they think expedient. Then is the party accuſed put to anſwer to euery article that is laid againſt him, ſeuerally and directly, either yea or no, as he thinketh good, hauing alwayes a clerke by him to record euery word that he ſpeaketh. After this examination and confeſſion thus had &amp; done Ex tempore, without either order or any great aduiſement, they ſtraightway giue him pen, inke, and paper to put in his anſwer in writing if he will; pretending hereby, that they work for him al the means &amp; helps that may be to try himſelf an honeſt man. And thus is this crafty Inquiſition cloked with this goodly pretence of equity &amp; iuſtice, where in very deed this is their fetch, that hearing him firſt make one confeſſion by word of mouth ſuddenly and without aduiſement, and after that another with more deliberation in writing, they may eaſily find ſome ods betwixt the one and the other, hauing neither any copy of his former confeſſion to lay before him, nor being able for very feare &amp; trouble of mind to remember euery word that hath eſcaped him. But if there chance to be no contrariety, yet haply ſhall there be ſomwhat either more or leſſe in the one than in the other. Moreouer, it ſtandeth him vpon to be able to chop logicke with them, and to find out ſuch contradictions as the other look for, becauſe his latter confeſſion penned with ſome diligence, alwaies miniſtreth ſome matter of new cauillations. Which fetch of theirs whoſo will wiſely and warily auoid, muſt take heed he play mumme, and ſpeak not one word, but premeditated and deuiſed vpon afore hand: and being mute in all other matters, craue onely this one thing at their hands, and that in as few and apt words as he can poſſibly, to haue a copy of his accuſation, with paper, inke, and ſufficient time granted him, that he may by leaſure, and with ſome 
                     •
                  ood deliberation make anſwer to ſuch matters as are laide to his charge. But foraſmuch as they (no doubt) wil not hold thē
                  ſelues contented with one anſwer, but will ſeeke to haue

it both by mouth and by writing for the cauſes before alleadged, the party muſt in any caſe ſee to himſelfe, and ſeek to wipe their noſes by ſhaping them a ſhort anſwer: yea, be they neuer ſo full of their queſtions and flouriſhes, or how froward or vntoward ſoeuer they be, let them not get within him in any wiſe, but hold them offaloofe, and be as briefe with them as he can. For albeit theſe raueners be very greedy of that anſwer that was ſuddenly made, &amp; without any ſtudy, yet ſet they moſt ſtore by that that was of his owne penning, ſpecially if it bee done by one that is learned, whom by common and daily experience they know to be of that nature for the moſt part, that whiles they labour to auoyd matters of no great importance by ſome nice conſtruction, they fall into diuers other abſurdities, or at the leaſt, by vttering a little of their poore skill they miniſter much matter for captious fellowes to quarrell and cauill vpon. By meanes whereof, many times ſuch learned clarkes, who at the firſt fell into their fingers but onely for trifles, were afterward burdened with ſo many matters and ſo weighty, that they could neuer rid themſelues thence, til either they went to the ſtake, or els enduring ſome other puniſhment, led the reſt of their life in perpetuall ſhame and ignominy. Wherof I could ſhew you ſundry examples, but that I would be loth to fall from deſcribing the ſubtill practiſes of the Inquiſition, to diſcourſe in a manner of a whole hiſtory. Wherfore, I hold him wiſe which can obſerue in that place, vpon a little ſtudy to make a briefe and a reſolute anſwer Chriſtian-like, ſo as he neyther hurt his conſcience, by ſuppreſſing or ſhaddowing a truth, nor by his long proceſſe giue his aduerſary any thing to take hold vpon, or haue any aduantage againſt him, which (doubtleſſe) is the onely makr they ſhoot at, in putting him to anſwer it by writing. It is alſo very good for him, that ſo oft as he can, he make ſure his ſide by ſome Schoole

                     . of their Canoniſts and Schoolmen (as they call them) for ſo ſhall neither the truth be obſcured, nor theſe ſo eaſily

make a quarrel to his anſwer, being ratified and confirmed with his aduerſaries arguments. But whenſoeuer any eyther by writing, or word of mouth, confeſſeth any thing openly before them that is hereticall, they vſe this order commonly; out of that one ſaying to draw &amp; deriue diuers others by hooke or crooke, &amp; to charge him with each of them ſeuerally, as if he had ſpoken and affirmed them all preciſely, though the party neuer ſpake them, nor then will grant them, nor greatly vnderſtandeth them, or wel knoweth what to make of them. As for example, I will report a thing that hapned at Siuil a few yeares agoe: neither need I to coyne any examples in a caſe ſo common as this is, that is almoſt in experience dayly in that holy Court of theirs, to the great loſſe and vtter vndoing of many ſilly and ſimple ſoules.
               There was a certaine man cited before the Inquiſitors at Siuil, for ſaying in preſence of his familiar friends &amp; acquaintance, that he knew none other Purgatory but one, &amp; that was the blood of Chriſt, which daily waſheth and purgeth our ſinnes. The party who ſaid it, was but a ſimple man, brought vp in the countrey all the dayes of his life, hauing no ſpark of good ciuility in him, or of any good education, and by chance hearing this on a time among certaine of his companions, liked thereof very well; but now, comming before the Fathers for the ſame matter, told them plainly how he was of the ſame mind once, marry ſith it miſliketh their worſhips, he is very well content to forſake it. But what did it auaile (thou foole) to make ſo raſh and ſo ſudden a recantation? By confeſſing the matter, thou ſetteſt them agogge. By keeping thy tongue, thou hadſt grieued them to their very galles. By making thy purgation, thou couldeſt but haue loſt thy labor. Yet this did not content the cōmiſſioners, but there muſt needs be ſome other quarrell picked againſt him. For the Inquiſitors Organs (forſooth) went hard for want of exerciſe, &amp; therfore they muſt neceſſarily haue ſome body to play vpon them, and

keep them from ruſting. Ergo, ſay they, and conclude of this antecedent againſt this poor plough-man, the Church of Rome which in time paſt hath determined the contrary by law, doth erre, and the councel erreth alſo, and iuſtification commeth by faith only, wherein a man is made free &amp; abſolued à poena &amp; culpa. To be ſhort, out of theſe they fetch a rabble of opinions and aſſertions, which they call hereſies, &amp; charge the poor man with euery of them, as if he had affirmed them all in plain tearms, ſay he nay neuer ſo ſtoutly that he knoweth nothing of any ſuch matters, nor ſo much as once euer thought vpon them. Now who ſeeth not that this kind of proceeding in this holy office is packed full of ſubtill policies, and all the diuelliſh practices and deuices that may be? Yet herein is the mighty prouidence of God toward his elect ſpecially to be had in admiration, that theſe men wanting the means of calling &amp; teaching which other men haue to induce them by, in a place ſo quite contrary to theſe means as is fire to water, are both called and taught by God, hauing their eyes opened by him, &amp; their vnderſtanding lightned. For the Inquiſitors themſelues, who ſeek vtterly to deſtroy and root vp all faith &amp; truth, they (I ſay) by ſuch meanes as I haue before declared, are ye
                   very preachers, teachers, and furtherers of the ſame, as it is euident and manifeſt by many notable examples of ſundry perſons that haue fallen into their hands only for prating raſhly and fooliſhly, rather then of purpoſe or aduiſedly, that there is no purgatory, and that it is but a dreame and no ſuch thing indeed; whereas they haue been at their firſt comming in, ignorant in moſt of the points concerning ſaluation, by their only queſtionings, collections, illations, brought either in forme or out of forme, haue departed thence very well inſtructed: wherof this rude fellow of the countrey, of whom I laſt made mention, may bee a ſufficient teſtimony. Moreouer, if he party chance to confeſſe ought, they vſe to haue another hooke ready bayted, ſharpe and perilous enough, I warrant you: to wit, they

enquire of him whatſoeuer it be, of whom he learned or heard it, or if he haue haply read it in ſome booke, or if hee haue had any conference with any other about the ſame matter, or he himſelfe haue been an inſtructer to others, or by any meanes haue mentioned it in the preſence of any: in what place he did ſo, and who they were that ſtood by? For whoſoeuer was preſent, whether they liked his talk or no, yea though it were his owne father, or nigher him, if nigher could be, they are ſure to buy it full dearly: the Inquiſitors will haue a f
                     •
                  irt at them, becauſe they came not foorth with, &amp; made complaint thereof vnto them. All wch things it behooues a man greatly to be cunning in, that if it be Gods will that he fall into their hands, he may learne before hand out of his holy word and will how to preuent them, and prouide an anſwer to ſuch demands, leſt he vndoe both himſelfe and others through his owne folly and negligence. At the laſt, when his accuſation is read, if the party be an infant (as we tearme one within age) they prouide him a Patron whom they call a Tutor. A very godly The Tutor. way (no doubt) if ſuch a man were appointed to that place as would play his part ſtoutly, and as it becometh him in reſpect of his office. Howbeit he is no ſuch manner of man as the infant would and ſhould haue for the better bringing of his matters about, but one of their own choce, wch either is a very wolfe to ioyn with them againſt the ſimple lambe, or at the moſt, to ſtand like a cipher in Arithmetick, and doe nothing but fill vp a place, and for faſhion ſake and order ſtand in ſtead of a Tutor to performe the ceremonies and circumſtances of the law. For moſt commonly the Porter of their holy houſe ſerueth that turne, or in his abſence ſome other of the Porters lodge, and indeede but onely that he beareth the bare name and title of a Tutor, dealing in nothing that appertaines to the office, my Lords Muleter may eaſily be Tutor in ſuch ſort to the whole company of the priſoners all at once. By reaſon whereof, the Porter cannot alwayes bee ready to anſwer euery body

that knocketh at the gate. And on this ſort do theſe holy Fathers fulfill the commandements of God, and the laws of man touching poore infants and orphanes, who as well by the law of God as of nature, are commended ſo ſpecially to the conſideration and regard of all men, but moſt chiefly to Iudges.
               Neither reſt they here, contenting themſelues to mocke the law in this point alone, but in another of more importance: wheras the law prouideth, that euery defendant The Aduocate. ſhall haue his Aduocate, ſome man expert in the law, to pleade his cauſe, and order it diſcreetly according to law and conſcience, and to defend their right if any they haue, or at the leaſt to temper the rigor of the law, leſt it be conſtrued and miniſtred with extremity in this ſo waighty a matter, and the onely ſuccour that theſe ſilly ſoules haue to helpe themſelues withall; they deale with them in like ſort as they do in the former for appointing them a Tutor, and ſo ſhift it off with a meere ſhadow and a bare ceremony: onely becauſe it is a very waighty matter, therefore they would ſeeme full of curteſie and humanitie, and would faine cloke their wicked contempt of lawes with ſome goodly pretence. For they name vnto the party 3. or 4. of the moſt famous men toward the lawes, to chuſe out of them ſome one to pleade his cauſe, and beſides all this their gentleneſſe (of fatherly affection I dare ſay) they aduiſe him to take ſuch a man, who in their iudgements is the beſt learned. And what would a man deſire more? Yet whoſoeuer is choſen to be his Aduocate, will bee ſure that he tell not his Clyent any point of law that may doe him eaſe any way. For he knoweth right well, that if the Inquiſitors haue intelligence thereof, he ſhall not ſcape ſcotfree, ſeeing their meaning is nothing leſſe then to prouide him an Aduocate to defend his cauſe, but onely to bleare the common peoples eyes withal, and make them beleeue that they proceede by order of law like good conſcionable Fathers, where in very deede they compaſſe their matters

both againſt Gods lawe and mans. For the Aduocate and his Clyent may not ſo much as haue a word together ſecretly of any matter, but in preſence and hearing of the Inquiſitours or of ſome Notary. And what doth the Aduocate then would a man thinke? Marry he receiueth his Clyents anſwer to the accuſation rude and rough hewn as it were, and that doth he ſmooth and ſet together in forme of lawe (yet ilfauouredly framed full oft, God wot) and all this while taketh vpon him the name of an Aduocate, onely to delude the lawe withall. But forward to our purpoſe.
               Within 2. or 3. dayes after the party hath had the copy of his accuſation, he is called into the court, where his aduocate ſtandeth, like one that would ſtoutly defend his Clyentes cauſe, and ſaue all ſuch matters as ſhould ſeeme to make againſt him. Then the Inquiſitour, as though hee had done the party an high pleaſure, &amp; diſcharged his conſcience wholly for that part of the lawe, pointeth out the Clyent his Aduocate with his finger, and ſtraightway falleth into his old note, exhorting him to vtter the truth, and take heede to his conſcience, and if hee haue any more to ſay, to ſay it at once. All which time the Aduocate ſitteth or ſtandeth mute, and if he haue ought to ſay, yet dare hee not let it come out before hee haue made the Inquiſitours of his counſell. For the Aduocate all the while that hee is telling his tale, ſo eyeth the Inquiſitours, that one of their eyes is neuer off from the other: the Inquiſitour is ſo much afraid leſt the prating Aduocate vtter ſomething raſhly &amp; vnawares, wherin the Clyent might eſpy ſomwhat for his aduantage in lawe, and ſo auoyd the danger of their ſecret and hidden ſnares. The Aduocate on the other ſide is as much afraid, and quaketh euery part of him, leſt any word chance to ſlip him ſuddenly that the Inquiſitours happly ſhall not well like of, and therefore dare ſay nothing for his Clyent, but onely giue him a few wordes of comfort, and bid him bee of good cheer, and tell the truth

in any caſe, ſaying, that that is the onely way to preuaile in this Court: and as for me (ſaith he) I will be ready to do for you the beſt that I can. Then commeth the Inquiſitour in with his part, ſinging the ſame note, and ſo is the priſoner ſent to his priſon againe.
               After this day of hearing, the party beginneth to bee of better courage, hoping that his matter draweth nigh to an end: but it is farre otherwiſe God knoweth. For many of them are forgotten: ſome for a yeare, or halfe a yeare, or perhaps for three or fowre yeares, as it pleaſeth theſe good Fathers to deale with them, and there they lie in priſon, as it were a peece of leather that lieth ſteeping in the tanners fatte. During all which time, they neither are called any more, nor one word mentioned for their deliuerance. Then, if any for very lothſomnes and intolerable filth by reaſon of their long impriſonment, do craue to come to their anſwer, ſome perhaps obtaine it, and ſome go without it: but in the end both their luckes are alike. For they that after long ſuite get a grant thereof, are commanded into a Parler; where they haue ſuch countenances made them, and ſuch ſpeach vſed towards them, that it is eaſie to be eſpied, that they haue no manner of regard vnto them at all: and there (forſooth) they put them a queſtion a great deale meeter to be asked of men in a farre better caſe then they are in. As for the purpoſe: what their ſute is? or what they would haue? Whereunto each anſwereth, that he would bee glad to haue ſome end and determination of his trouble. Marry and thereabouts we go (ſay they) as carefully as wee can, and aſſure your ſelfe we will not forget you. But if he be earneſt to haue it determined, they bid him bethinke himſelfe then, and ſay the truth, asking him why hee no more regardeth his conſcience? &amp;c. At the length, laying the fault of his long impriſonment to himſelfe (whereas hee poore man would haue been content, if hee might haue had his choyce, to come forth to the ſtake, rather then to

continue there ſo long) they ſend him to priſon againe. And albeit they afterward do grant him diuers other daies of hearing: yet as he continueth his ſute, ſo keepe they him off with their accuſtomed delaies, till they thinke it bee time to communicate vnto him the depoſitions made againſt him, which they terme the publication of the witneſſes.
            
            
               CHAP. IIII.
               
                  The publication of the witneſſes
               
               AFter a long &amp; loathſom time of impriſonment, in ſuch ſort as mās nature is not able to endure it any longer, when the poor ſoule in their iudgements is brought ſo low, that he could be content to be delivered with all his heart, though it coſt his life, &amp; therfore likely to tell all &amp; more too, yea, euen as much as they themſelues can demand or deſire: they call him yet again before them, &amp; in a ſpeech framed as it were a mean betwixt a ſharp rebuking &amp; a gentle admonition, doe aske him how it happeneth that hee hath ſlipt his owne matters ſo long, and now at the length would haue him come in and tell the truth. Vpon which point they ſtand very long in perſwading him: and then eyther on this or the next day of hearing, the Fiſcall entreth his action againſt him, praying that publication may bee made of the witneſſes: which being granted, forthwith the depoſitions are deliuered to the party, but yet without any names ſubſcribed. The order and penning whereof is a ſufficient declaration what great zeale this holy Court hath to bring the truth to light. For all things are ſo difficultly reported and ſo abruptly; ſo wreſted and wrung with ſuch doubtfull tearmes of double ſenſe and vnderſtanding, that a man would iudge him ſure neuer well in his wittes that vttered them. And this is a peece of the Legerdemaine of that holy Houſe, purpoſely inuented to driue the party alwaies into a doubt, euen of thoſe points which hee knoweth are alreadie depoſed againſt him. Secondarily, that ſo nigh

as may be, he ſhould haue no maner of knowledge of the witneſſes, who they were that did depoſe againſt him, leſt happly hee ſhould take ſome exception againſt them. Finally, that if he haue conferred with any other then his accuſers, concerning thoſe matters whereof hee is accuſed, and knowing not who were his accuſers, but labouring to find them out, ſhould perhappes reckon vp all, and ſo by that meanes bring a great ſort of mo fiſhes to the Inquiſitours holy Angle.
               And here would I be glad to know of theſe Fathers of the Faith, ſeeing they are ſo well learned in the laws (if they would be ſo good as to tell vs how it commeth about) that whereas the Publication of witneſſes is ordeyned of common right to bee vſed ſincerely and plainly, yet in this holy Court it hath no place, neither is allowed for lawe, by reaſon that the names of the witneſſes are ſuppreſſed, and ſo the one halfe of the law, yea the better halfe of it, is curtalled and quartered, and the reſidue neither vprightly handled, nor faithfully, but moſt craftily and falſly abuſed, as I will make relation hereafter. And if an exception will lie againſt witneſſes, not onely by order of law, but in other reſpects vpon very good and neceſſary conſiderations, becauſe knaues and villaines ſhould not any way trouble nor moleſt honeſt men that are guiltleſſe and innocent, why is there no place in this moſt holy Court for ſuch exceptions? For in ciuill cauſes but of ſmall importance, they Witneſſes admitted in their holy Inquiſition. will not admit a mans enemy, nor a lyer, nor a defamed perſon, nor an Idiot, nor a Bedlam, nor a drunkard, nor a 
                     •
                  ew, nor a villaine, nor any ſuch kind of people to bee ſworne as witneſſes: and who then (I pray you) hath enabled all this route of Rakehels, in matters of religion and the weightieſt cauſes that can bee, to bee accepted and admitted for witneſſes, and that their teſtimony ſhall bee receiued and reputed in matters touching life and death: ſeeing they are diſabled by all lawes to condemne any man in the leaſt trifles that may come in queſtion betwixt man

and man? But here perchance they will ſay they deny not, but the party hath very good liberty of challenge againſt the witneſſes, if he could learne by any meanes or coniecture who they be that depoſed againſt him. Therefore if hee chance at any time to geſſe him right that hath thus teſtified againſt him, ſo that the Court iudge him inſufficient, and doth therefore refuſe him, they haue done notable iniury to both parts, or to one of them at the leaſt. Firſt of all to the witneſſe, by refuſing him now, if they did right before in ſuppreſſing his name, becauſe the party ſhould not know him: next, to the party himſelfe, being now at the length content to admitte his exceptions, ſo he can geſſe or by ſome other meanes learne his name, and haue ſufficient matter to charge him withall, and ſuch as may bee thought good cauſe of challenge: which ſurely in all indifferent mens iudgements that haue any conſciences at all, is an horrible and moſt deteſtable kinde of iniurie. But to returne to their policies. The depoſitions of the witneſſes therefore is an euident proofe, aſwell by their order and manner of examination, as alſo by their kind of ſpeach therein vſed, whether the Inquiſitours haue kept the euen ſtreet, or gone by crooked lane. For this is moſt ſure that they are not commonly read to the party in ſuch ſort as the witneſſes haue depoſed, but if any thing be vttered beſides by the witneſſes that might make for the priſoner, or be conſtrued on his ſide, they reiect all that as needeleſs and ſuperfluous, admitting onely that that maketh moſt againſt him, and clap on all that on their owne biace ſide. For the further proofe and declaration whereof it will bee worth the noting vnto you, to ſhew what their common vſage is in regiſtring of ſuch depoſitions: As for example.
               
                  N. a witneſſe (ſuppreſſing his name) ſworneand allowed, &amp;c. ſaith that heeth ſaid N. heard in ſuch a place, and ſuch a yeare, and of ſuch a moneth (if he can ſo preciſely remember the times) ſuch a man report, that the aforeſaid, that is to ſay, the party accuſed, ſaid thus and thus, &amp;c. And in their

Records (which they call their Originall proceſſe) they haue all thoſe circumſtances at large, which they exact of the witneſſes for a further truth and tryall of the matter: but in that exemplified copy which they deliuer to the party himſelfe, very ſubtilly they ſuppreſſe all the circumſtances of time and perſons preſent, whereby the party might haue any inkling of his accuſer or witneſſe, ſupplying thoſe places with theſe or ſuch like words: A certaine perſon: another man: and a third perſon. In which kind of depoſitons there bee certaine priuy points and nice conceits diligently to bee obſerued, that is to witt: Whenſoeuer they ſay that he heard it of a certaine perſon whom he hath named, it is to be vnderſtood, that the witneſſe heard the party himſelfe ſpeake it; and by the craftie conueyance of the Inquiſitors it is ſo brought about, that in the counterfeit copy which they deliuer to the parties hands, it ſeemeth as though he had heard it of ſome other mans mouth, becauſe he ſhall not gheſſe who it was that gaue euidence againſt him: but hauing conferd therin with diuers others, as well as with this man that depoſed againſt him, ſhould no more know who hurt him, then he that playeth at blind-man-buffe can gheſſe who gaue him the blow. And in this behalfe, if the priſoner chance to mention any ſuch perſons as the Court hath not yet beene enformed of, they are incontinently outlawed, and reputed as fauourers of heretickes, for ſuffering an hereticke to ſow ſuch peſtilent ſeedes among them, without making complaint thereof foorthwith to the Inquiſitors. But if the depoſitions bee on this wiſe, That he heard it of another certaine perſon whom he hath named, &amp;c. it is to be vnderſtood, that the witneſſe heard it by a meane, and therefore will not ſerue to ioyne with another witneſſe, though he bee man good enough for them, and fitte to feede their ſuſpicious humors. The difference betwixt both theſe depoſitions is no more but this, that in the one this word other is vſed, that is not put in the former, which is

onely thus, that he heard it of a certaine perſon, &amp;c. This geere, I tell you, is taken out of their Sancta Sanctorum. Thus by theſe ſubtill and captious quiddities, the Inquiſitours beguile many a Chriſtian ſoule that knoweth not their cunning dealings, but thinketh himſelfe ſafe enough, becauſe he feeleth his conſcience free from vttering any vntruth. And truely it is greatly to bee lamented, that ſuch poore wretches being guiltleſſe (God knoweth) a great ſort of them ſhould be ſo hemmed in of theſe crafty Catchpoles ſo farre beyond all humanitie, for want of a little skill in theſe their ſubtill and ſlightfull deuices. Wherin this counſell of ours (perhaps) may doe them ſome manner of pleaſure, for the more eaſie eſpying and auoyding of theſe their policies. The defendant therfore muſt take heede that he ſpeake not one word at this day of hearing, tending to the confutation of that which the witneſſes affirme, yea though it be as falſe as God is true, and he himſelfe neuer ſo well able in his owne iudgement to anſwer it preſently; leſt the Inquiſitours by their importunity happen to wring out ſomewhat from him on a ſuddaine, as they vſe to deale with diuers. Onely let him this doe; that is to ſay, craue a Copy of the depoſitions, and licence to anſwer them in writing by leaſure and with deliberation, againſt the next Court day, or ſo ſoone as he can conueniently. In which anſwer, let him ſee in any caſe that hee obſerue thoſe things, whereof in the accuſation made by the Fiſcall, I haue giuen him inſtructions before. Secondarily, after he hath obtained the Copy, diligently to mark of himſelfe, who be witneſſes with the witneſſes, and who not, and whether their teſtimony be able and ſufficient to condemne him in theſe matters wherin they beare witnes with the other, or no. As for his Aduocate, he is but onely for faſhion ſake, and it were as good for him to haue one of clou
                     •
                  s, for any helpe that he is like to haue The number and quality of their witneſſes. at his hand, much leſſe (may ye thinke) at the Inquiſitors. But as concerning ye witneſſes, two that heard it of report

are in this lawleſſe Court as good as one that heard it of his own mouth: ſo that two ſuch witneſſes of hereſay, and one that heard it of the parties own mouth, are enow to condemne him. Moreouer it is to be noted, that the keeper of the Inquiſit 
                     •
                  urs priſon, whom they commonly call Alcaidium, is as good as two of the beſt witneſſes. And therefore for ſuch mattters as he hath ſeene and obſerued in the priſon, his onely teſtimony is ſufficient to condemne any whom he himſelfe accuſeth. Yea, and in ſome caſes one onely witneſſe, though he haue nothing but by hereſay, yet is he ſufficient to put the party in ieopardy of the racke, if he haue not ſome iuſt cauſe of challenge againſt him. But if there were any reſpect at all, or regard of iuſtice in this Court ſo farre from all conſcience, it were enough in all godly and indifferent mens iudgements, either for the parties deliuerance, or at the leaſt for his purgation, to auoyde that quiddity in the depoſitions which I mentioned before, by faire and flat deniall of that, which the witneſſe ſaid onely of hereſay, were this word other there or no. Wherewith the Inquiſitors ſeeke to ſalue the matter, and to ſaue themſelues, being indeed but a very falſe and a friuolous cauill, onely, to colour a lye. For ſo ſhould it fall out in the end, that he who depoſed nothing but of hereſay, ſhould, as right and reaſon is, be refuſed as inſufficient: and the other that ſpake of his owne preciſe knowledge, be likewiſe reiected, if there were iuſt cauſe of exception: ſo that both their ſecret practiſes ſhould bee auoyded, and the Inquiſitours enforced to lay away all this their double dealing, and to tell him plainely that the witneſſe heard it of his own mouth, and ſo driue the party to auoyd it more ſubſtantially. But what ſhift ſhould a man make in ſuch a caſe? For, hauing the law in their owne hands like Lords, nay, like moſt cruell Tyrants rather, when they know the witneſſe had it at the firſt hand, yet will they make as though they were content to admit the exceptiō of the party who took the witnes to be none

other then ſuch as had it by report, and will afterward order the matter as it pleaſeth them, whiles the party ſuppoſeth that hee hath ſufficiently auoided that witneſſe, and thinketh himſelfe ſure enough for him. Let him therefore well and warily caſt with himſelfe aforehand, or rather pray vnto God to reueale vnto him, what is to bee done in this perplexitie.
               Furthermore, in this holy Court euery Iohn-a-Nokes may The Promoters ſeruing their holy Inquiſition. bee a promoter, and euery frantike Bedlam that is beſides himſelfe, euery varlet or villaine, and ſo forth euery one of the 24. orders, bee he a perſon neuer ſo much diſabled in law to be a witnes. For a hungry hunter, &amp; one that is greedy of his game, will be glad of euery curtalled curre that will do him ſeruice to bring home his prey. But if the Promoter in his information chance to want words of weight, or to miſplace them, or haue forgotten the very words which hee heard the partie ſay, ſo he can hit of the matter, and remember the ſubſtance, the Inquiſitors by vertue of their office inſtruct him, and bring it into his remembrance again: In ſo much, that oftentimes the Promoter will tell ſuch a tale as neither he heard, nor euer meant to tell, but euen as they themſelues haue prompted him word by word: which a man may well thinke is not all of the beſt ſort. Yet God hath ſometimes ſo blinded their ſenſes &amp; vnderſtandings, that they haue quite forgotten both themſelues &amp; all their owne practices and deuices. As it came to paſſe at Siuil, that a certaine frantike woman, in the abſence of her keeper chancing to breake looſe, and to vndoe her bolts &amp; irons wherein ſhe was fettered in a certaine godly mans houſe, came to the Inquiſitours to the caſtle Triana, and there had almoſt diſcouered to them the whole aſſembly of the congregation, which in that great cittie heere and there met in corners. The which (no doubt) had beene a prey alone for them, but that God meruellouſly defended that good flock of his, being at that time very ſmall in compariſon, and farre

vnable to abide the puniſhments which ſince that time they haue for the profeſſion of Chriſt endured moſt conſtantly. This woman before ſhe fell mad was one of the chiefe in the congregation: I meane for feruencie of zeale and skill in holy ſcripture, farre aboue that which a man would look for at a womās hand. By means whrof, ſhe was very well acquainted with all thoſe, who in this perillous time profeſſed the Goſpell of Chriſt, but in the heat of her phrenſie all her former loue and zeale that ſhe bare toward the congregation, being turned into an extreme and a deadly hatred, ſhe raged ſo vehemently againſt the aſſembly of godly perſons, that in all her madding time ſhee had nothing elſe in her mouth, but cryed vpon the Inquiſitors on this ſort: Fire and fagots, fire and burne them; poſſeſſed (no doubt) of ſome euil ſpirit labouring quite to ouerthrow that good Chriſtian congregation by the meanes of that mad woman. Therefore ſo ſoone as euer ſhe was got looſe, ſhe went ſtraight way with all ſpeed to the Caſtle where the Inquiſitours lay, &amp; there knocked at the gates, which were opened vnto her by and by, as commonly they are not ſtrait kept vpon any that can informe that holy Court againſt a ſort of poore innocents. Wherupon at her firſt entrance within the gate, ſhee required that in all haſte ſhe might come to the ſpeech of the Inquiſitours. Who ſtraightway aſſembled all together in their Parler, as it were to conſult about ſome waighty affares, and ſent for the woman before them to heare what ſhe could ſay. Who immediatly decared vnto them, that ſhe had brought them a Bedroll of Lutherans that ſwarmed abroad in the Citie, whiles they that ſhould diligently ſee to ſuch things, ſat idle within and ouer-ſlipt their matters: and ſo began to reckon them, &amp; if ſhe had proceeded, ſhe had appeached to the number of 300 and aboue, that were very earneſt profeſſors of the Goſpell: but that the Inquiſitours aſtonied at this ſuddaine ſight, and meruailing at the firſt what this ſhould meane (for till that time there had been little talke

or none of any Lutherans): beſides, eſpying many madde toyes which ſhe vſed in the telling of her tale (which was a truth indeede as ſhe reported it) cauſed her to ceaſe her prating in good time. Yet becauſe they would not bee thought negligent in doing their dutie, though the matter were but of ſmall importance, they kept the woman ſtill, and ſent for the good man in whoſe houſe ſhee was kept, whom ſhe meant to haue made foreman in her bil, becauſe he had enteated her ſomwhat roughly at ſuch times as her fittes were vpon her, to the end to make her leaue her rauing. The mans name was Franciſco à Cafra, the Parſon of Saint Vincentes Church: who afterwardes was impriſoned for religion &amp; eſcaped away by a miraculous means: notwithſtanding in the very firſt triumph ouer the Lutherans, they burned his picture. When hee was fetcht and brought afore them, being takē for a good honeſt man, they asked him what the woman meant by talking of ſuch a nū
                  ber of Lutherans, &amp;c. but he forthwith forcing a laughter, fained himſelf to maruaile at them, in that they perceiued her not to be beſides her ſelfe; declaring vnto them, that ſhe had bio in that plight by the ſpace of two or three moneths, in ſo much that he was conſtrained to beate her and binde her, as was to ſee by her ſhoulders both blacke and blue, &amp; by the print of the Irons on her legges: adding moreouer, that he for Gods ſake and in the way of charity kept her at his houſe: from whence ſhee brake looſe, cauſing him and his whole houſhold to ſeeke her ouer all the city: howbeit he was now right glad that he had once met with her againe, and found her ſafe. As for the Lutherans whom ſhe prated of ſo much, he told them, that during the time of her fits, ſhe had none other ſong, as moſt commonly mad folke will be alwayes talking of ſome one ſpeciall matter or other. And for the fetters wherein ſhe was chayned at his houſe, if it were their pleaſures either to ſend any to ſee them, or to make enquiry of his neighbors about him, they ſhould find all things ſo as he had reported, and therefore

beſought them, that ſome of their ſeruants might take and bind the woman, and bring her home againe to his houſe. Where at the woman fell into a great rage and exclamation, that all the caſtle rang withall, ſaying ſhee was not mad, but hee was the greateſt and ſtarkeſt Lutheran in all the City, that laded her with Irons, and ſcourged her dayly moſt pittifully. At which words they all fell in a great laughter, and thereupon commanded their ſeruants to take and bind her, and to carry her to her old home againe, and to her cold Irons, commending him greatly for his good worke, in taking vpon him ſo great a charge as to deale with a madde woman, and to ſeeke meanes to amend her; aduiſing him hencefoorth to make her ſurer, leſt ſhe ſhould chance to breake looſe hereafter, and make as much buſineſſe at ſome other time. Thus the Inquiſitours forgetting themſelues and their owne practices, loſt at this time as great a prey, as all that amounteth vnto which they had beene ſcraping and gathering together in the harueſt time and increaſe of the Church for two or three years before. But to returne to our matter. It is furthermore to be conſidered and obſerued in this holy Court, that the Promoter neuer ſpeaketh in open Court againſt any perſon, but onely the Fiſcal, who is, as it were, an Atturney generall to mooue the Court in all the matters that are brought vnto him, and to take all the informations, and follow them accordingly, ſo that the Promoter ſerueth him for a witnes. Whereof, like (as of other things) I need not to bring any other proofe or teſtimony then their owne. Let euery man therefore iudge by what right or reaſon they doe it.

                  The confutation of the witneſſes.
               
               THen after 3. or 4. dayes, the party is commanded to come before them, and to put in his anſwer to the depoſitions. And with him commeth alſo his Aduocate. But here I ſhould not forget to tell you by the way, that

whereas it is the part of euery Aduocate in all iuſt cauſes diligently to conferre with his Client about the depoſitions, and to aduertiſe him which bee the chiefe and principall points that require anſwer, and not onely thus to do, but alſo to draw the anſwer himſelfe, and ſet it in ſuch order as moſt may further his Cliēts cauſe (elſe wherto doth an Aduocate ſerue but for ſuch purpoſes?) they leaue the ſimple man to himſelfe, to deuiſe and diſpoſe it as well as he can, hauing none in the world to helpe him, ſaue God alone. And if you aske this holy Court the queſtion, why they doe in this behalfe breake and contemne this cuſtome, which doubtles proceeded of the very law of nature, they can yeeld you no reaſon for it, nor make you any other anſwer, but onely this: Forſooth there is a great difference betwixt this holy Court, and other common Courts. In very deed they ſay truth, and ſo it is: for all their nice quiddities were not worth a ſtraw, if the parties might there frankly and freely defend themſelues by ſuch means as are to them by all lawes allowable. But when the party hath already framed his anſwer ſo well as he can, then in good time his Aduocate commeth in, to play his part at the length. Who very warily (I warrant you) and circumſpectly, as he knoweth full well it ſtandeth him vpon, dealing in, ſo dangerous a caſe, leſt he likewiſe, ere hee be aware, fall into the Inquiſitors hands by ſome little ouerſight, declareth vnto his Client openly before the Inquiſitors, which depoſitions they be that touch him nigheſt, and what be the great matters that are prooued againſt him, who be witneſſes with the witneſſes, and who not, and that there is no good to be done any way but one, to gheſſe if it be poſſible who is his accuſer, and to deuiſe exceptions againſt him. And yet it is not beſt for the Aduocate here to be ouer buſie in prating to the party, or to put him in mind of any further matter that might doe him good, more then he by aduiſement and leaſure can pick out of himſelfe. Onely this counſell he giueth him, to remember

himſelfe, and call his wits together when he is moſt at leaſure, with whom he hath fallen out at any time, becauſe it may be that ſome of his enemies haue accuſed him for ſome old grudge. For if there be any apparant matter of ſome ſpeciall quarrell that hath beene betwixt the party and his accuſer, this is all and the onely cauſe of challenge that this Court will admit againſt any witnes whatſoeuer. Furthermore, he declareth vnto him, that he may refuſe peremptorily ſuch witneſſes as haue varied in their tales, or be his enemies, as is aboue-ſaid: or if he can bring mo witneſſes, to proue that he hath alwayes beene an aduerſary to that whereof he is accuſed, and one that hath rather frequented and dayly beene conuerſant in the contrary. And here is all the helpe that the poore Client hath at his Aduocates hands. Whereupon hee is remanded to priſon againe, with this Item alwayes, that he vtter the truth, with a few menacing words now and then enterlaced, more then well doe beſeeme them, that if he will not be ordered in time, they will extort it out of him by extremity of law: whereby it is giuen the party to vnderſtand, that he ſhall be hencefoorth more ſtraitly examined, and more hardly dealt withall: inſomuch that after three or foure dayes reſpite giuen him to call his wits together, and to remember himſelfe, they ſend for him againe, and aske him whether he hath yet be thought himſelfe, &amp; haue ought to ſay. But whether he hath, yea or no, his Aduocates queſtion is: If he haue hit on the names of any of his witneſſes or accuſers. Wherin if the party can cal any thing certainly to mind, he declares it vnto the Inquiſitors, praying them to conſider, whether ſuch and ſuch men be not his accuſers, betwixt whom and him there hath beene an old grudge, which as yet reſteth betwixt them vncompounded? Howbeit if he gheſſe not a right, beſides this, that his anſwer is not worth a button, both his whole three or foure dayes labour ſpent in gheſſing, is quite loſt, and his accuſation abideth ſtill vntouched. But if he chance to

gheſſe right, his Aduocate asketh him what exceptions he can take againſt ſuch as he hath named, but dares not for his life directly tell him that he hath gheſſed aright, for it is not good for him I wis to talke ſo plainely. Yet when the Aduocate hath heard his Clients exceptions, and taken the names of ſuch witneſſes as he nameth vnto him for proof thereof, being now at more liberty then before, he taketh vpon him the charge to examine thoſe matters by interrogatories, and further domandeth of his Client, if he be able to bring-in proofe for his better purgation, that he hath beene a friend to the Fryers and Monkes, and familiarly acquainted with them, and diligently obſerued and kept all and ſingular the cuſtomes, rites, and ceremonies of the Church of Rome, and vſed to come often to ſhrift, and to receiue his maker; and in paſſing by any image or croſſe, if he haue done to them their due reuerence, that it may appeare that he is none of Luthers ſect. Finally, if hee can auerre generally, that he hath beene quite contrary to that whereof he is now accuſed. Which things if he proffer to prooue particularly, the Inquiſitors by ſolemne act in law doe openly declare in Court, that they are content that he make his purgation accordingly within 9. dayes next after. The whole charge whereof, after that the party hath giuen in the names of thoſe witneſſes that depoſed againſt him, reſteth wholly on the Aduocate, as I haue ſaid a little before. Howbeit euery man hath not thus much fauor ſhewed him to make his purgation on this ſort, but onely in ſuch caſes, where the witneſſes in their depoſitions agreed not with their fellowes, nor greatly with themſelues in their owne tales. For otherwiſe they haue but ſmall ſuccour or none at all to auoyd them by making their owne purgation, but onely are admitted to take exception againſt the witneſſes (as I ſaid before) if they can deuiſe who they be.
               And when the party is proceeded thus farre, let him perſwade himſelfe, that God hath brought him thither for tryall of his fayth, whether it be pure and perfect, yea

or no. For if he, vpon hope to auoide the preſent perill of the body, determine to uſe ſuch ſhifts for his ſuccour in procuring his purgation by meanes aforeſaid, albeit he be throughly quit in this Court concerning his duty &amp; obedience to the Church of Rome and her Idolatries: yet bee he well aſſured, in that generall day of doome which will be ſo terrible to all creatures, &amp; in the judgement of Gods true Church, it will fall out againſt him farre otherwiſe. It ſhall therefore ſtand a man vpon in this caſe to look well about him, and to enter into his owne conſcience, and ſecretly debate with himſelfe the cauſes of his impriſonment diligently. For if it be for the glory of God, and the free profeſſing of the truth, and he forſweare Chriſt, treading the bloud of his teſtament vnder his feet, &amp; denying the truth wherunto God hath called and raiſed him out of that deep dungeon of darkneſſe, ignorance, and ſin, hoping by theſe curſed and damnable meanes to eſcape the tyranny of men, perhaps he may doe ſo for a ſeaſon, and purchaſe the favor of men again: but let him him be moſt aſſured, that he ſhall never eſcape the ſharp and moſt juſt judgement of God, from whoſe truth he is revolted: whoſe power is not only over the carcaſſe to kill the body, but afterwards to throw the ſoule into vtter darkneſſe. Therefore if hee haue any ſparke of grace left aliue within him, or any zeale either of Gods glory, or loue of his owne ſalvation, or that the authority of our Redeemer may waigh with him any thing at all, ſaying: Whoſo denieth mee before men, him will I deny 
                  Matth. 10. 
                  before my heavenly Father: and he that acknowledgeth me before men him will I alſo acknowledge before my Father and his Angels in heaven &amp;c. he will wholly reſt vpon that authority, and ſticke to his tackling in that pinch, and vtterly renouncing with heart and mouth all theſe meanes to ſaue this temporall life, offred vnto him by his Advocate and the Iudge (whereunto he cannot giue his conſent without great diſhonour to his Creator, and danger of his owne ſoule) will yeeld a plaine and open confeſſion of his faith, thinking

himſelfe a thouſand times in better caſe, that God hath preſerued him to that inſtant, to ſuffer ſome affliction for Chriſts ſake, battering in pieces this earthly tabernacle, that is to ſay, a full weak and wearyiſh body, for ſo noble a quarrell as is the honor of God and the building vp of his Church. For theſe curſed meanes to ſaue a mans life (which that holy houſe, the very ſinke of ſin and iniquity, vſeth, of like curteſie and compaſſion as is in the Crocodile, to grant to theſe poore ſoules) are not here reported, to the end that the godly ſhould learn hereby the ſhifts to ſaue themſelues, but rather, that by knowing them, they ſhould vtterly auoyde and abhorre them, and that the world may ſee that all the deuices and policies of this holy Inquiſition tend to no other end, but after they haue layd their cruell hands, continually ſtained with the bloud of ſome of the Saints, vpon any perſon, if he relent and recant Gods glorious truth, ſo to deſtroy him both body and ſoule▪ if otherwiſe, yet at the leaſt to kill his body, ouer which alone their power is able to extend it ſelfe in ſuch as liue in the feare and ſeruice of God duly and truly.
               Thus, after that the party hath endured two or three months in priſon at the diſcretion of theſe good Fathers, they ſend for him foorth once againe to the place of this combate: where the Inquiſitor beginneth to declare vnto him, how that the witneſſes which he brought for his purgation, haue beene heard what they can ſay, and therefore he deſireth to ſee what he can ſay for himſelfe, or elſe to draw to an end. Then he, after their accuſtomed manner, falleth to exhortation that hee tell the truth, which is alwayes one peece of their talke, ſo that I beleeue, a man ſhould tell them a good long tale, ere they would be ſatisfied. Whereunto the party maketh them ſuch reaſonable anſwer as he thinketh beſt for his owne caſe. Howbeit, vnto diuers they vſe to put ſundry queſtions, &amp; oppoſe them in their owne anſwer exhibited vp by thē in writing, quarrelling at euery letter and ſyllable, like to ſubtill Sophiſters.

When the party hath ſpoken all that he hath to ſay, the Fiſcall concludeth vpon his ſayings; and laſtly, the Inquiſitors with the aſſent of their Councell and Aſſiſtants giue ſentence when and what they liſt or like themſelues, the Diuines &amp; Monks, and other of the Clergy firſt waighing and conſidering ſuch things as the party hath vttered touching doctrine and faith, and ſo valuing it after their owne rate and meaſure, and trying it by their own touch, which they call the qualification of doctrine. At what time if the party be able to prooue ſubſtantially, that he neuer dealt in Chriſts Goſpell, which they, by a new name of their owne coyning, commonly call Luthers hereſies, either they abſolue him, and giue him his Quiet us eſt, or elſe moſt commonly vſe to order the matter, and giue iudgement accordingly as they haue him in a certaine iealouſie and ſuſpicion ſtil either more or leſſe: Prouiding alwayes, that none paſſe their hands without ſuch markes and badges as he ſhall carry with him to his graue, in token that hee hath bin within the Inquiſitors paw

But if the party ſhrinke not for the matter, but conſtantly continue ſo confeſſing the truth, or diſaffirme the depoſitions that be againſt him, hauing not excepted againſt the witneſſes, he is ſure 
                     •
                  o try the torments: whereof I haue now to ſay ſomewhat.
            
            
               CHAP. VI.
               
                  The condemnation to the racke, and the manker of the execution thereof.
               
               THe ſtate and condition of the godly (gentle reader) hath beene euermore from the beginning hard and very miſerable, in compariſon of the proſperitie which the wicked and vngodly enioy in this world. For according

to Chriſts owne ſaying in his Goſpell after Iohn, they thinke they doe God great good ſeruice, which ſlay them vpon euery light occaſion, and ſtudy daily by new deuices and practices to circumuent them: whereof you haue heard ſome ſufficient proofe before. And albeit the iniurious dealings and ſubtile practices which I haue declared already, be ſuch as any good natured people, or that can be content to be ordered by law, reaſon, or equitie, would worthily thinke intolerable: yet in reſpect of theſe that ſhall enſue hereafter, which I am now to ſhew, they will ſeeme not onely ſufferable, but very reaſonable and full of equity and good conſcience. For they doe farre exceede all barbarouſnes, yea I may well ſay all brutiſh and beaſtly madnes, that a man cannot more aptly liken them to any thing in the world, then to that which they do moſt liuely reſemble, and from whence they proceede, that is to ſay, Sathan their Syre: ſo that the diuell, though hee ſhould force himſelfe thereto, is not able in matters touching men, no nor in any thing elſe in the whole world, to goe beyond them in theſe their moſt monſtrous and diuelliſh examples of tyranny: neither hath he any mans heart in his belly, that can without teares reade or heare theſe things that hereafter enſue, which in rifling this butchery, wherein many a good ſoule vpon trifling occaſions, yea diuers of them guiltleſſe (God knoweth) are made away, we will lay open before the face of the whole world, and plucke off their hood of holineſſe, wherewith they haue bleared all mens eyes, and abuſed the whole world hitherto.
               After the ſentence be once giuen, except it be to the racke, the party is not ſent for againe, till the great day of their glorious ſhew; at what time he commeth out into open audience with the other priſoners that come to heare their iudgements pronounced vpon them, and euery man foorthwith to receiue his puniſhment accordingly, vnleſſe hee be found not guilty, and ſo quit by proclamation.

For then is he kept in priſon ſtill by the ſpace of 2. or 3. dayes after the triumph, that the world may thinke that he alſo departed out with the reſt. And this forſooth is one of their holy deuices, becauſe they would not be thought to lay their hands vpon any perſon raſhly, or without good cauſe why: as they are wont oftentimes to tell the parties by the way, in ſuch exhortations as they make vnto them, to vtter the truth. The holy houſe is ſo perſwaded of their owne doings, that what extreamity ſoeuer they ſhew vnto the priſoners, yet they think they do vnto them no iniury. Howbeit diuers of them, whom they ſhew ſpeciall fauour vnto for certaine cauſes to them knowne, are ſet at liberty, and ſent away to their owne houſes two or three dayes before the great day of their ſolemnities, cauſing it to be noyſed abroad, that they were accuſed by falſe witneſſes. Yet is this their ſlye dealing open enough to any man that liſt to mark it, euen by this one thing, that a man ſhall neuer fee any ſuch falſe witneſſes openly puniſhed therefore, which in all other caſes are accuſtomably moſt ſharply ſeen vnto. But if they be determined to put any man to the rack at ſuch time as he leaſt looketh for it, then ſhall he be ſure to be brought into the Audience: where all the Inquiſitors, or the greater part of them, ſit in their ſeates of Maieſtie, and beſides them the Prouiſor, as they tearme him, or deputy Ordinary of the Dioceſſe, like a ſhepheard ready to flea one of his own flock, who of duty ought to be preſent, as well to heare the ſentences giuen, as to ſee execution miniſtred. And at this Court-day they declare vnto the priſoner, how the Inquiſitours, with all the learned Councell, haue deepely conſidered his whole caſe, bearing him in hand, that they haue found it out for a ſurety that he will not wholly declare the truth, &amp; therefore are reſolued, that he ſhall ride the racke, and there be ſpurred certaine queſtions, and ſo by hooke or by crooke will wring it out of him, will he, nill he: therefore they aduiſe him to do it voluntarily, as he will avoyde the paine

and perill of the racke. Whereunto they ioyne a certaine exhortation, which they intermingle with ſome ſowre ſpeech of high and threatning words, and ſet it out with great ſeueritie of countenance, rehearſing vnto him all the ſeuerall torments of the racke as terribly as they can deſcribe them, to make him quake in euery ioynt of him. Yet whether he confeſſe, or not confeſſe, all is one, for to the rack he muſt go. Wherupon they ſend for the Officer, &amp; command him to haue the party into that place where The place where the priſoners are tormented. the Racke ſtandeth, which commonly is a deepe and a darke dungeon vnder the ground, with many a doore to paſſe thorow ere a man can come vnto it, becauſe ſuch as are put thereto, ſhould not be heard to ſhrike or cry: In the which place there is a ſcaffold reared; where the Inquiſitour, the Prouiſor, and the Clerke do ſit, to ſee the Anatomie made of him that is brought to them. Then the linkes being lighted, and all the players entred that haue parts in this Tragedy, the Executioner, who tarrieth laſt to make all faſt (as they ſay) and to ſee euery man in before him, commeth alſo at the length, and of himfelfe alone maketh a ſhew worthy the ſight, more then all the reſt of that rout, being wholly arrayed all ouer from the top of his head to the ſole of his foote in a ſute of blacke canuas, ſuch as the ſuperſtitious Spaniards weare on Maundy-thurſday, when The deſcription of the Tormentor. they ſcourge and whip themſelues, as the cuſtome is in moſt places vnder Popery, if not in all: much like that apparell that the diuells in ſtage-playes vſe here with vs in England. Moreouer, his head is couered with a long black hood that reacheth ouer all his face, hauing two little peep holes to ſee through, and all to this end, to make the poor ſoule the more afraid both in body and mind, to ſee one torment him in the likeneſſe of a diuell. O Lord, ſuch are their holy guiles.
               After that the Lords be ſet downe each in their places, they begin with him againe, and exhort him afreſh to ſpeake the truth freely and voluntarily: otherwiſe at his

owne perill be it. For if either his arme, or his legge, or any other ioint be broken in the Rack, as it happeneth to diuers, ſo that hee chance to dye thereof (for more gently than ſo, they mean not to deal with him) let him blame no man but himſelfe. For they think that after they haue giuen him this faire warning, they are now diſcharged in conſcience both before God and man, and therefore are guiltleſſe, what harm ſoeuer come vnto him by meanes of the Rack, yea though he dye thereon as innocent as the child newly borne. After this, with ſharp rebukes and menacing words, they command that the party bee ſtripped ſtarke naked, be it hee or ſhee, yea though it were one wel knowne to be the moſt honeſt and chaſte mayden or matron in all the city (as they bee neuer lightly without ſundry ſuch in this their ſhambles) whoſe grief I dare wel ſay is not halfe ſo great in reſpect of any torments that preſently they endure, as it is to be ſeen naked in ſuch a preſence, and of ſuch maner of perſons. For theſe wicked Villaines without any regard of humanity or honeſty, (which mee thinkes they ſhould ſomwhat reſpect, if it were but onely for their long beardes and ſide-gownes, with the name &amp; countenance of grauity and holines which they pretend, ſeeing that neither for Gods ſake, nor for the honeſty of the good and godly matrons and ſober maydens they wil not forbear one iote of that barbarous impudency) cauſe them firſt to be ſtripped into their ſhirts and ſmockes, and then out of them alſo welnigh (ſauing your reuerence) vp to their priuities, drawing on a cloſe linnen breech, &amp; after that make bare their arms alſo to their ſhoulders, as tho the Wrench and Rack, wherewith they are about to torment them, were not able to pearce their linne, or as tho their linnen breeches would more manerly couer thoſe partes, which they may bee aſhamed to diſcouer, then could their ſide-ſhirts or ſmockes. And here thoſe ranke R
                     •
                  mmes declare how they will not loſe that diuelliſh pleaſure which they take in that ſhameful and vnſeemly ſight,

though the poore wretches that ſuffer this, buy it both with paine and ſhame enough full dearely. The which thing ſurely is a good occaſion, why that after this ſhamefull and impudent dealing of theſe Fathers of the faith bee once noyſed and bruted abroad, they whoſe wiues or daughters eyther haue already, or may hereafter fall, or preſently are in this the holy Fathers foule handling, ſuffering this ſhamefull villany, ſhould be vtterly abhorred and ſhunned of all the people whereſoeuer they goe, aſwell of Papiſts as of other, becauſe they ought to eſteeme the honeſty and chaſtity of their daughters and wiues aboue all other treaſures. But to returne to our purpoſe.
               When the parties are thus ſtripped out of all their clothes, be it he or ſhee, into their linnen breeches, they ſignifie unto the Tormenter by ſome token, in what ſort they would haue the party ordered. For this is one other peece of their art, to talke by ſignes and watch-words like to pedlers french, wherein from the higheſt to the loweſt all the pack of them in that curſed Court, as well Iacke layler, as my Lord Iudge, can vnderſtand one another very readily. As for the torments by the which theſe holy Fathers vſe to bring men to their beliefe, as they be many in number, ſo in ſorts they are ſundry, yea moe by a great many than any poore ſoule is able to endure, or can come to the knowledge of.
               But the moſt vſuall be the Ieobit and Pullie with water, 
                  The Ieobit or Pullie. 
                  cordes, and fire: whereof I meane to ſpeake ſeuerally. And yet haue they one other caſt at him firſt ere he goe to his puniſhmēt, perſwading him afreſh to vtter whatſoeuer he knoweth either by himſelfe or by others of his acquaintance: In the mean ſpace, while they are thus communing with him, one commeth behind him, and bindeth his hands with a cord, 8. or 10. times about: and becauſe nothing ſhould be thought to be done without authority and order of law, the Inquiſitour calleth vpon him to ſtraine each harder than other. Being thus bound to the Racke,

they begin yet once againe to perſwade with him: and beſides the binding together of his hands, they alſo cauſe his thumbes to be bound with ſome ſmaller line drawne very ſtraite, and ſo faſten both the lines that tye both his hands and thumbes to a certaine Pullie which hangeth on the Ieobit. Then knocke they great and heauy bolts vpon his heeles, if the party haue none already, or elſe hang betwixt both his feete vpon thoſe bolts which he hath, certaine waights of Iron, at the firſt time but of fiue pound, and ſo hoyſe him vp from the ground. Whiles the poore wretch hangeth in this plight, they fall to their perſwaſions once againe, commanding the hangman to hoyſe him vp on high to the very beame, till his head touch the Pullie. Then cryeth the Inquiſitor and the Clerk vpon him to confeſſe ſomewhat, promiſing to let him downe out of hand, if ſo be that he willbe ruled: otherwiſe, they tell him that he is like to tarry there till hee would be glad to declare whatſoeuer they would haue him. After he hath hung thus a good ſpace, and will grant nothing, they command him to be let downe, and twice ſo much Iron more to bee layde on his heeles, and ſo hoyſed vp againe one inch higher if it may be, threatning him that he ſhall dye none other death, except he declare vnto them the truth in ſuch matters as they demand of him; &amp; therefore charge the hangman to let him vp and downe, that the waight of the Iron hanging at his heeles, may rent euery ioynt in his body from other. At which intolerable paines piercing all the parts of his body, if the party ſhrike or cry out (as he hath good cauſe to doe) they are as loude on the other ſide, roaring and yelling vpon him to declare the truth then, or elſe they tell him hee ſhall come downe with a vengeance. Neither will they onely ſay ſo, but the party ſhall find it ſo. For if hee continue in the ſame mind, they goe on forward as faſt in their mad moodes, and bid the hang man to ſlip the ropes ſuddenly, that he may fall downe with a ſway, and in the halfe way

to ſtop, &amp; giue him the Strappado: which being done with a trice, all his whole body is out of frame, both armes, The Strappado. ſhoulders, back, legs, and all the reſt of his ioynts, by reaſon of the exceeding great waight hanging at his heeles, and the ſudden ſway tearing each part from other. And yet here is no ho with them neither. For renuing their exhortation and threats, if he will not yield vnto them, they cauſe more Iron to bee added the third time: ſo that the poore wretch being in that pittifull plight, halfe dead and more, is by their commandement heaued vp once againe; and to mend the matter withall, beſides the extreamity of his griefes, they begin to raile vpon him, calling him Dog and Heretike that will ſtand ſo obſtinately in concealing the truth, and at the length tell him that he is very like there to make his end. Now if the pittifull creature in the midſt of his pangs call vpon Chriſt (as for the moſt part, all that are thus perſecuted for his truths ſake doe) that he would vouchſafe to ayde and aſſiſt him, thus miſerably tormented, and almoſt ſlain for his ſake, then fall they to mocking and deriding him, ſaying, Ieſu Chriſt, Ieſu Chriſt. Let Ieſu Chriſt alone, and tell vs the truth. What a crying out vpon Christ makeſt thou? confeſſe what we aske thee, and make vs no more ado. In much like ſort (as a man may eaſily iudge) were the blaſphemous ſpeeches of the Iewes againſt our Sauiour himſelfe, ſaying: Behold he calleth for Elias. He truſteth in God, let him deliuer him now if he will: for he 
                  Math. 27. Pſal. 22. 
                  calleth himſelfe the Sonne of God. Which is a true token and moſt euident argument, that it is Chriſt againſt whom they kicke and make all this broyle: whoſe name when it is called vpon by ſuch as ſuffer for his ſake, they doe ſo ill digeſt, that they can hardly abide to heare him named, or once ſpoken of. But if the party at any time deſire to bee let downe, promiſing to tell them ſomewhat, and performe it indeede, that is the very ready way to make him be worſe handled than before, becauſe they thinke that now he beginneth onely to broach his matters. For as

ſoone as this tale is at an end, they begin afreſh to exhort, to threate, to rack him, giuing charge to hale him vp, and to let him downe againe in ſuch ſort as is before declared. This execution for the moſt part continueth from nine of the clock in the morning till high noone, or an houre after: and when they are diſpoſed to leaue him and let him downe for that time, the Inquiſitours for a policie ask the layler if his other inſtruments be in a readines, to put the partie in feare of further torment
                     •
                  , being almoſt dead with theſe alreadie. The layler anſwereth that they are readie, but that hee hath not brought them with him. Then ſee (ſay they) that they be made readie againſt to morrow, and looke that nothing bee wanting. For wee will try one way or another, whether wee can get the truth out of this fellow, yea or no; and ſo depart, giuing theſe and ſuch like words of comfort to the poore wretch that lieth diſtracted in euery limme: How now Sirrha? how like ye this geare? haue ye enough of it, or no? Well, ſee yet betwixt this and to morrow, that ye call your wits to you, and bethink your ſelfe what to ſay, or elſe looke to die none other death but this: and yet we promiſe thee that all this is but a fleabiting in compariſon of that which thou art like to feele; and ſo depart. Then beginneth the Iayler to play the bone-ſetter ſo well as he can, and to put his armes and leges in their right ioynts again: and putting on his clothes, bringeth him back to his priſon, or carrieth him rather, hauing neuer a leg to ſtand vpon, yea ſomtime draggeth him by the armes or legges too-too pitifully: and then forſooth for faſhion ſake, and to ſeeme ſomewhat mercifull (minding in deede no ſuch matter) telleth him that a Surgeon ſhall be ſent for if neede bee.
               But if they bee determined to put the partie no more to the racke, then within two or three dayes they ſend for him forth againe into the Audience, and prouide ſo, that in the way from the priſon, as hee paſſeth by the place where the rack-ſtocke ſtandeth &amp; is commonly occupied,

the hangman ſhall ſtand for the nonce, to ſhew himſelfe in the ſelfe ſame likenes of a Diuel, the which I haue before deſcribed, that the party in paſſing by, may haue a ſight of him, and thereby bee occaſioned the more to remember his former torments. Who comming into the Court, findeth the Inquiſitor, the Ordinarie and the Clerke readie ſet each man in his place; which after their maner fall in hand with him, ſometime by perſwaſions, and ſometime by earneſt intreatie, mouing him to vtter ſomewhat. At which time if they prevaile not, neyther can get any thing out of him, they cauſe him to bee carried to priſon againe. But if hee declare any thing, they preſſe him the more, and ſuch matter it may bee his hap to diſcloſe, that it may chance to purchaſe him the Racke once more, vpon hope of getting ſome greater matters at his hands. Marrie if they were reſolued before to put the party to the Rack once again, then about 3. dayes after his laſt being there, when the ache in his ioints is moſt grieuous and painfull vnto him, they ſend for him againe to come before them; and what with earneſt entreatie and with terrible threats, they labour to haue him ſhriue him ſelfe of all his opinions and hereſies, and to appeach as well ſuch perſons with whom hee hath had conference in ſuch matters, as alſo all other whom hee knoweth to bee of the ſame minde and opinion. Otherwiſe, they will him to make himſelfe readie for the Racke: wherein if it bee his chaunce either to be mainmed in any part of his bodie, or to receiue his deaths wound, let him blame no man but himſelf. And if he continue ſtil the ſame man that firſt he was, the keeper is commanded that once again he prouide the Rack, all the aforſaid parties taking their places as before to ſee him ſtripped out of his clothes, and put to it once again in ſuch ſort as is before declared, or ſomwhat worſe, after this maner.
               The partie hauing his hands bound behinde him and hanging at the Pullie, they bind both his thighes together with ſmall, but very ſtrong cords, and ſo in like maner his

legges about the calfe or mid-leg. Then put they betwixt the cords and his legs a ſhort peece of wood, wherewith they wreſt the ſtrings ſo ſtiffe till they bee ſo deepe ſunke into his fleſh, that they are paſt ſight: a very extreme and a terrible torment, and much worſe then any that as yet hee hath endured. In this plight the poore ſoule lieth by the ſpace of two or three houres, abiding the Inquiſitours goodwill &amp; pleaſure: who neuertheles ceaſe not to moleſt and trouble him all this while, either by queſtioning, or entreating, or perſwading or flouting &amp; mocking him, or diſquieting him one way or another. Or in ſtead hereof, they practiſe, as they thinke beſt, another kind of torture: which, albeit it bee vſed vpon offenders in other places aſwell as in this, yet for one eſpeciall point of crueltie added by them, we may iuſtly aſcribe it to their holy Court as a deuice of their owne. The name of it, as it is cō
                  monly called, is Burri or Aſelli, and the maner of it is this. Burri or Aſelli. There is a bench made of maſſie timber, wrought ſomewhat hollow on the vpper part like a trough, ſo large that a man may lie open in it on his back; and thereabouts as his midriffe lieth, there is a ſharpe bar going croſſe ouerthwart, whereon a mans back reſteth that it cannot ſettle to the bottome, becauſe the partie ſhould find the leſſe eaſe, where otherwiſe he might ſtay or reſt his back againſt the bottome of the trough: being alſo placed in ſuch ſort, that his heeles ſhall lie higher than his head. When the partie is laied hereon, his armes, thighes, and legs are bound with very ſtiffe and ſmall cords about the middeſt of the maine bone, which afterwards they ſtraine with certaine ſtiffe wreſting ſtickes or truncheons put vnderneath the cordes, till the cords be ſettled downe within the fleſh, and pearce almoſt to the very bone, inſomuch that they bee cleane out of ſight, and then commeth in this The Torment by water &amp; the laund. deuice of their owne addition: Firſt, they take a very fine and a cloſe laund or linnen cloth, and ouerſpread the parties mouth therewith as hee lieth vpright, ſo as it may

ſtop his noſtrils alſo, that when the water is poured into his mouth, he ſhould take in no ayre at his noſe. Then take they a certaine quantity of water, ſo much as it pleaſeth the Inquiſitours to appoint, which they poure vpon the cloth, not by drops, but in the maner of a long ſtreame like a thread: which having ſomewhat a high fall, beareth downe with it the fine linnen cloth into the furtheſt part of his throat. And here, whoſo ſhould behold the poor wretch in this pitifull caſe, would thinke him, I dare ſay, to bee in as great an agony as any man is at the giuing vp of the ghoſt. For in all other torments a man may haue liberty to draw his breath: onely here he cannot, by reaſon that the water ſtoppeth his mouth, and the cloth his noſtrils, ſo that when they plucke it out of the bottome of his throat (as manie times they doe, to ſee whether hee will anſwer to their demands, yea or no) the cloth is ſo wet with water and bloud together, that a man would thinke the verie intralles would come out of his bodie. And thus the partie continueth in theſe pangs ſo long as pleaſeth them, with promiſes of ſharper ſauces than any that hee hath taſted as yet, and ſo they ſend him to priſon againe.
               But if theſe good Fathers be diſpoſed to deal with him further, &amp; proceed to other greater tortures (for their luſt is law in this their lawleſſe Court, where right &amp; reaſon can take no place) then within a month or two vnder or ouer, as they think beſt, the party is once againe brought to the rack, ſome twice, thrice, foure, fiue or ſix times, &amp; therein entreated eaſily or roughly as it pleaſeth the Inquiſitors to appoint. And ſome are tormented in another ſort, that is no where els vſed but in this holy Houſe, the which is termed by fire, the deſcription wherof is ſhorter to ſhew The Torment by fire. than the reſt, but the paines and cruelty, as great altogether. They take a charcole pan of Iron full of hot coles, which they ſetiuſt ouer againſt the ſoles of a mans feete before he goe to the foreſaid rack, and to the end that the

fire might haue the more force to burne them, they baſte them with lard or bacon.
               Thus after they haue occupyed and vnedged all their tooles one after another, and are paſt hope of hauing any thing at the parties hands, they reſpite him for a ſeaſon to take his reſt, and after a while call him before them againe, and fall to queſtioning with him, inquiring and requiring many things in a farre other order than they vſed before, in ſuch tearms as euery word may miniſter matter enough to quarrell at. The queſtions alſo are framed ſo cunningly and Point de vice (for this is their onely ſhift that neuer fayleth them) that by granting one thing, they muſt needes grant another, and deny the contrary to that. For theſe Fathers are paſſing good Logicians, and maruellous ſubtil Sophiſters, their crafts-maſters I warrant them, which notwithſtanding that they are dayly in vre with ſuch matters, will not ſticke to take a little paines, and vpon ſtudy to coyne caſes and queſtions for the nonce: which to help their memory withall, leſt when the time commeth that they ſhould haue vſe thereof, they might forget them, are written and laid open before them: ſo that if the party, when any thing is demanded of him, be neuer ſo little retchleſſe, it is not poſſible for him to auoyde them, but that one way or other they will ouertake him. The onely helpe for a man therefore in this caſe is, to haue a perfect remembrance of all ſuch things as he hath deliuered vp into their hands: for it is but in vaine for him to craue to haue them read vnto him, becauſe either they will not grant him that; or if they doe, yet will they read much amiſſe. Wherefore if he doe miſtruſt his owne memory, let his anſwer be this, that he wholly referreth them to his former doings and ſayings, and in any caſe auoyde reaſoning with them. Or if by their ſubtilties of Logicke, they inferre any thing thereupon, which either he knew not of, or elſe neuer affirmed, let him take heed in any caſe how he anſwereth it, leſt either they entrap him in ſome new

matter, or elſe driue him to the denying of Gods truth moſt wickedly. And the readieſt way will be, to cut off all their queſtions with a quicke and a round anſwer, and to tell them plainly that he was neuer ſet to ſchoole in all his life to learne theſe quiddities in argument, nor exerciſed in any manner of diſputation. For theſe fellowes are ſo cunning herein, and ſo full of interrogations and ſtrange deuices, beſides, ſo troubleſome therewithall, and ſo importunate, that many times they will get that out of a man by theſe meanes, when all the racking in the world will doe no good.
               As at Siuil not long agone, they apprehended a certaine godly Matron, whoſe husband they had burned a little before, and ſo made her a widow. But becauſe her confeſſion, while ſhe was on the racke, and there tormented moſt cruelly, was by their owne decrees inſufficient either to condemne her to the ſtake, or to confiſcate her goods ſuch as they were, and yet, if they could but get onely thus much out of her, that ſhe knew full well that the Church of Rome had determined clean contrary to that which ſhe affirmed, this ſhould be ſufficient cauſe to make her to forfeit that poore remnant of her riches that ſhe had to keep her ſelfe withall in her widdow-hood, though poorely (God knows) they did rather compell her by their importunity, than compaſſe it by their Sophiſtry, that ſhe was content to ſay ſo much. For perceiuing that elſe they would neuer make an end thus to moleſt and trouble her, Indeed (ſaith ſhe) I confeſſe that the Church of Rome hath ſo determined, and therefore I pray you enter in mine anſwer to be ſo, and let me depart quietly; and afterward as you ſhall ſee cauſe, determine what ſhall become of me or mine at your pleaſure. Whereunto they gaue her neuer a word, but only wrot as ſhe had ſaid, and ſought no further▪ For whether it were ſo yea or no, what care they, ſo the party ſay ſo much, that they may haue the ſpoyles whatſoeuer, either by hooke or by crooke.
            
            
               
               CHAP. VIII.
               
                  Certaine other deuices to driue the priſoners to confeſſe ſuch matters as the Inquiſitors are deſirous to vnderſtand of.
               
               WHen the extreamity of torments with the ſubtill practices before expreſſed will doe no good, but that the party conſtantly endureth the one, and anoydeth the other very cunningly, then fall theſe good Fathers to other farre better fetches to their thinking, wherein whoſo is able in a deuice to go beyond the reſt, is counted a chief Champion, and therfore hath yielded vnto him the preheminence of place aboue other in this holy Houſe. Being therefore paſt all hope of hauing any thing at the parties hands by foule meanes, they deuiſe to compaſſe him by faire, ſhewing themſelues very mild and mercifull, and ſo affectioned, as though the miſery and affliction which they ſee the other in, went to their own hearts. They weep with him, they entreat him, they cōfort him, they giue him their aduice, and deuiſe for him ſome ſecret meanes to rid him out of his miſery, making him beleeue that they tell him that in ſecret, which they would ſcarce tell to their owne fathers, or brethren, or deareſt friend that they haue aliue, with many other like words. And this they vſe commonly to doe to ſuch as bee the ſimpler ſort of people, but ſpecially to women, which for the moſt part are not ſo cunning to diſcerne forced and fayned tears. Therfore when the Inquiſitors begin to vſe them ſo gently, and to proffer them ſuch kindneſſe, then let the party ſee to himſelfe warily, and learne betimes to diſcerne whereabouts they goe in vſing ſuch flattering ſpeeches, aſſuring himſelfe, that they are but faire baites put vpon ſharpe hookes: whereof I will of a number report vnto you one example.
               The very firſt time that they began to burne for religion at Siuill, (which was diuerſe yeares ſince,) among certaine other that were for the ſame cauſe apprehended,

there was a very godly Matrone, with two of her owne Daughters and one of her ſiſters children, who hauing paſſed all theſe aforeſaid pikes with manlike conſtancy, were preſſed very ſore to betray ſome of their brethren, but eſpecially one to appeach another. One of the Inquiſitors counterfaiting a maruellous kind of compaſſion towards theſe ſilly women, ſent for one of the daughters to come vnto him. And when ſhee was come, they two being alone together, hee began to make a long ſpeech vnto her in way of conſolation, and afterwardes ſent her to priſon againe. This he vſed to doe diuers times and vpon ſeuerall dayes, alwayes towards the euening, and there held her a great while, declaring vnto her, how great a griefe it was to him to ſee her in theſe troubles: and therewithal would interlace ſome other pleaſant communication more familiarly many times, than did well become him. Which tended to none other end (as it fell out in proofe) but to perſwade the mayden, that he of very good affection ſorrowed to ſee her in ſuch diſtreſſe; that in ſeeing him ſo fatherly aduiſe her what the beſt were both for her ſelf &amp; her mother &amp; ſiſter to do in this caſe, ſhe ſhould wholly commit her ſelfe and her cauſe to his ordering. After that two or three dayes had been thus ſpent in ſuch like conference and familiar communication, weeping (as it were) ouer her for the miſery which ſhe was in, with other many moe arguments and tokens of compaſsion, wherin he vttered the affections and ſorrowes of his heart for her pitifull eſtate, with often proteſtation of his good will and beſt furtherance to his power: after all theſe polices (I ſay) when the wilie Wolfe was ſure that the ſimple ſheepe was within his reach, he beginneth to perſwade with her to diſcloſe vnto him the truth of the matter, aſwel in ſuch things as touched her mother, ſiſter and aunt, as any other that were not as yet apprehended, binding himſelfe by an oath, that if ſhe would ſo do, and diſcloſe to him whatſoeuer ſhe knew concerning theſe matters, hee

himſelfe would ſtop all theſe gappes well enough, and find a meanes that they ſhould all depart home againe quietly to their own houſes. The maiden being but ſimple witted, was ſoone induced to credit the faire promiſes and allurenents of this flattering Father, and thereupon beginneth to open vnto him certaine points of religion whereof they were wont to conferre among themſelues, in maner almoſt, as if one ſhould giue holy things to a dogge, or caſt pearles before a ſwine. The Inquiſitour hauing gotten this thred by the end, laboured to vnwind the whole clew, and therefore calling in the maiden many times before him, to the end that her depoſitions might bee entred by order of law, made her beleeue that hee would take it vp and end it ſo reaſonably, that ſhe ſhould receiue no manner of harme thereby, and in the laſt day of hearing made a repetition vnto her of all his former promiſes, as to ſet her at liberty againe, and ſuch like. But when the time came that ſhe looked verily for the performance thereof, there was no ſuch matter, but contrariwiſe my Lord the Inquiſitour and his adherents perceiuing how this deuice had brought ſomwhat to light, which al their extremities otherwiſe could in no caſe doe, to the end to make her confeſſe
                     •
                   the reſidue, determined once againe to haue her vpon the rack, wherein ſhe indured moſt intolerable paynes both vpon the Pullie and the Trough, vntill they had, as it were, in a preſſe wrung out of her aſwell her beliefe, as alſo forced her to accuſe thoſe perſons whom they had hunted after ſo long. For the damoſell through very extremity of pangs and torments, was driuen to betray her owne naturall mother, and ſiſters and diuers others, that were thereupon immediately apprehended, and afterward put to the torments, and at the length ſent to the fire.
               Moreouer, the ſelfe ſame maiden within a while after plaied a notable part in teſtimony of her beliefe. For when ſhee was brought vp vnto the ſolemne ſcaffold with other

ofher companions there to be ſeene of all the people, and euery one to heare ſentence of death pronounced vpon them, as ſhee returned thence to her place againe; hauing heard her iudgement, which was to bee burned, ſhee came to her Aunt who had beene her Schoolemiſtreſſe, and taught her her catechiſme and beliefe (for the profeſſion whereof ſhee ſhould preſently bee executed) and with a bold courage without change of countenance, bending her head downeward maidenly, gaue her moſt hearty thankes for that exceding great benefit in taking the paines to inſtruct her, and praied pardon at her hands if at any time ſhe had offended her, for that ſhe was now at the point of taking her death, and departing this life. Whom her Aunt on the other ſide comforted as ſtoutly, willing her to bee of good cheare, and to let nothing diſquiet her, for ſhe hoped in God that ſhe ſhould be with Chriſt ere it were long. And this did ſhe in the preſence &amp; hearing of all the people, but ſpecially of all thoſe of the holy Houſe and their adherents. This Aunt of hers was the ſelfe ſame woman, which a yeare or two before being mad had detected the whole congregation to the Inquiſitours, whereof I made mention before: who being reſtored to her former wits againe by the goodnes of God, ſo well as the reliques of her diſeaſe would let her, did now both confeſſe his truth, and for the ſame endured moſt horrible and 
                     •
                  othſome impriſonment and torments: moreouer, was openly whipped, and ſo remained in priſon during the reſt of her life. But to returne to their practiſes.
            
            
               CHAP. IX.
               
                  Certaine other more ſecret practiſes,
               
               THe paſſing excellency of theſe practiſes which preſently I entend to diſcouer, is ſuch, that they rather deſerue to haue ſome ſpeciall place by themſelues, then to be thruſt in heere confuſedly among theſe other groſſe and common deuices. For they doo as far paſſe all the other that haue been ſpoken of heretofore, as there is difference

in dignitie betwixt a Court of Pipowders and the high Court of Parliament. The firſt whereof in order as it falleth out, and the moſt myſticall (and I beleeue as beneficiall to their boxe as all the reſt) is the abuſe of their ſacrament (as they terme it) of Confeſſion, which by their owne decretals is no ſmall offence. But all is law in this holy Houſe (as I ſaid before) whatſoeuer they liſt. Their deucie is this: Whenſoeuer any of the priſoners beginneth to be but a little crazie, they aske him whether hee bee diſpoſed to go to holy ſhrift. The which is done for two eſpeciall conſiderations. The one is, to proue whether he like well of their holy confeſſion, yea or no. The other, to ſee if perchance he will be perſwaded to ſay ſomwhat vnder Benedicite, either touching himſelfe or any other, that this holy houſe may bee ſet on work. If the party bee willing, at hand is Sir Iohn and a Clerke behind him with pen and ink left behind the priſon dore, &amp; ſo the ghoſtly father falleth to his Confitetor: in proceſſe whereof he examineth the ſicke man firſt generally, &amp; then ſpecially, whether he hold any of Luthers articles, chiefely in this or that article, or haue at any time conferred with any other concerning the like cauſes: finally, of whom &amp; by what occaſion he heard them, &amp;c. willing him boldly to confeſſe it &amp; to feare nothing, neither to think any ſuch villany to be in him as to reueale it, ſaying that hee hath authority immediatly from the high Cōmiſſioners to abſolue him of all, ſo that he diſcharge his conſcienc: with other ſuch like talke to the ſame effect. Now if the party follow him ſo far that hee begin to confeſſe ought, then is he ſurely caught. For when he hath poured out al, &amp; ſaid what he can ſay in theſe caſes (though he do it through the earneſt &amp; wicked perſwaſions of the prieſt) then doth he charge him further to confeſs the ſame before a Notary, otherwiſe he tells him that his abſolution is nothing auailable vnto him. And if the party yeeld vnto him ſo much, &amp; be content ſo to do, then the clerk, who lieth lurking not far off, is ſtraightway ſent for, and ſo▪ is

this matter diſpatched. But if he refuſe, either miſtruſting him altogether, or elſe halfe in doubt to credite him, yet is he no leſſe in dangered by diſcloſing it to the Prieſt, than if he had confeſſed it before a Notary. For this kind of confeſsion is not right auricular, but all is done aloud, by meanes that the crafty confeſſor repeateth the words after him, and ſo driueth the party to anſwer him almoſt in the ſelf ſame note: who knoweth not nor feareth any ſuch matter, that there lurketh any body 
                     •
                  o cloſly behinde the door to heare or, write what he ſpeaketh. Then after they haue gotten thus much, either they charge the party therewith, or elſe by occaſion hereof examin him further vpon greater matters, &amp; therupon pick a new quarrel with him, to the intēt to vſe more extream tortures. Neither doth this good ghoſtly Father either fear excommunication, or feele any trouble in his conſcience, for reuealing his ghoſtly ſonnes confeſſion, both becauſe he is perſwaded, that a little loud ſpeaking, and in ſomewhat a higher note than the ſecrets of confeſſion would wel allow, is not to bee accounted any diſcloſing at all; &amp; for that, whatſoeuer he did, was done in the ſeruice and behalfe of the holy 
                     •
                  louſe.
               
                  Iulianus Apoſtata (as hiſtories of very good credite doe report) ſpoiled the Chriſtians of all that they had, and coloured his theeuery with a falſe gloſe vpon the Goſpel; whereas Chriſt commanded all his Diſciples to loue pouertie, and to bee careleſſe for things of this world. At another time hee perſecuted them moſt cruelly, and exhorted them to patience, ſaying, that Chriſt had giuen them an example. And no doubt, theſe holy Fathers haue borrowed one of their deuices of him. For when they ſee any conſtatly &amp; like a good Chriſtian man to continue aſwel in his faith towards God, as charity towards his brethren, they hedge him in with this argument: Now ſurely Sir, you are but a
                     •
                  faint Chriſtian belike. For you pretend the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Primitiue Church: and the Apoſtles and Martyrs in thoſe dayes being brought

before the Ethnike Magiſtrates, and examined whether they confeſſed Chriſt or no, anſwered plainely that they did: and being further demanded, what fellowes &amp; companions they had, would tell the truth at the firſt. Therefore 
                     ••
                  th you profeſſe your ſelues to be followers of them &amp; their examples, in like ſort ſhould you confeſſe of your ſelues and of your fellowes. And this is their goodly reaſon that they make. In very deed Iulianus Apostata ſpake truth, that Chriſtians in the time of affliction ſhould not be wauering, nor giuen to the gathering of theſe earthly treaſures. Euen ſo (ſay the Inquiſitors) ſhould a Chriſtian man comming before a temporall Iudge, and there examined of his beliefe, yield a plaine and euident declaration of the ſame. But they lye both of them by their leaue, when they ſay that the Chriſtians in thoſe dayes did of like zeale betray their brethren vnto the Ethnike Iudges, as they did make open confeſſion of their faith: for that were flat againſt the rule of charity. And therefore it is a plaine matter, that in all other things the Inquiſitours are altogether as bad as euer Iulianus was, becauſe they vſe the ſelfe ſame reaſons that he did, and all to one effect: that is to ſay, to make waſte in the Church of Chriſt, by cutting downe the branches thereof, making but a ieſt of the lawes of true Religion.
               As there was once an Inquiſitour, and one of the chiefeſt of them, whom it ſhall not be greatly amiſſe to touch by name, becauſe if his friends hap to reade this, they may acknowledge it to be true that I will report of him. His name was Iohn Gonſalue, borne at Siuil, and Biſhop of Tarracon. 
                  The Biſhop of Tarracon.
                   It was his common ſaying (which I beleeue other of his fellowes learned of him) ſpeaking of ſuch as were brought before him for the profeſſion of Chriſt, that it was a wonderfull thing to conſider, how firmely theſe heretikes haue ingrauen in the tables of their hearts this commandement: Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe, which will neuer be brought to confeſſe of their fellowes, till

they be almoſt torne in peeces with torments, and yet can ye not get it out of ſome of them by theſe meanes neither: ſuch notable teſtimonies hath true religion oftentimes, euen of thoſe that are her deadly enemies. For the law of God concerning both the Tables, is perfectly written and ſealed in the hearts of true Chriſtians, and the print of this ſeale of Gods law is not elſewhere to be found but in theſe onely. But all the Lawes of the fleſh are ſigned with this marke: To day mine owne man, and yours to morrow. And ſurely, me thinketh, a Chriſtian Biſhop ought to haue beene very much aſhamed to bee ſo blind and ignorant therein, and not alone ſo to be, but thereunto to adde ſuch blaſphemy beſides.
               The ſelfe-ſame Biſhop (ſeeing we haue begun to talke of him) was ſent from the Kings Court to Siuil to be one of the Commiſſioners in the Inquiſition there, about two or three yeares before: at what time ſo great a multitude of the faithfull were firſt eſpyed, of the which euen till this day, at certaine times appointed there be diuers ſent to the fire. For all his Predeceſſours were not worth a ſtrawe in compariſon of him, neither halfe ſo ſtout as he, nor ſo cunning in bringing their matters about as was this one man, but ſpecially ſuch as concerned the holy Inquiſition. For vntill this time there was neuer an able man, that was thought ſo prouident as to preuent ſo great a miſchiefe before it hapned, or otherwiſe able to vphold the Church of Rome drooping, as it were, by meanes thereof, and in danger of ruine. But for any other good qualities that were in him to commend him to this Office, or ſufficiency to diſcharge it, I report me to himſelfe, I report mee to them that choſe him to this roome, yeal report me to all that euer knew him, if there were any thing in him at all that might preferre him, ſpecially and aboue his fellowes, either apparance of learning, or skill in Diuinity, or knowledge in the eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, or any great reading of the anciēt Fathers or the late Writers (whoſe authority the

Church hath worthily in great eſtimation) or if hee were greatly ſeene in matters of faith, whereof they tearme themſelues the Inquiſitors and Iudges, as it were, both of oyer and terminer, in theſe caſes: to be ſhort, if there were any knowne and approoued godlineſſe of life and conuerſation in this man: wherein the whole packe of them flatter themſelues ſo much, that they arrogate vnto themſelues a very gay and glorious title thereby, but rather becauſe he was more cruell and vnnaturall, and ſomewhat more ſlie in the deuices and practices of the Inquiſition than the reſt were. In reſpect whereof, he obtained both a diſcharge from his ſeruice, and a fat Biſhopricke beſides in recompence of his trauailes, and partly in conſideration that he was an old forworne ſoldiour; and hauing now good leaſure, like a wicked impe of Rome, returned to his old occupation againe. At the ſelf-ſame time whiles he remained in commiſſion at Siuil, ſo many were apprehended for profeſſing the Goſpel, that he was driuen to beſtow ſome of them in his owne lodging, becauſe all the priſons in the towne were not able to receiue them, the number was ſo great. Yet his Reuerend Lordſhip wanted neyther time nor leaſure to take his pleaſure abroad, and to row vpon the riuer in Barges titled with purple and ſilke, with ſuch preparation as had better beſeem'd one of Sardanapalus ſchollers, than any ſober man or Chriſtian Biſhop: accompanied with Muſicians, but not with the Muſes, hauing a very great traine after him beſides, and ſo paſſing to his garden adioyning thereunto, all the whole people gazing vpon him, and running in heapes and throngs to ſee this ſight. In very deed theſe triumphs &amp; iollities were not greatly out of the way for him and his mates to delight in, their matters being in ſuch plight as they were; and the Church of God, whereunto he was a profeſſed enemy, ſo full of troubles, vexations, and afflictions. But to returne to their practices againe.
               Whenſoeuer theſe good gentlemen are deſirous to

learne out a certaintie of ſuch as liue altogether in one priſon, (whom they ſuſpect to haue ſome conference in matters touching ſaluation, either by way of exhortation, or by comforting &amp; confirming one another in the faith, being in ſo great miſery as they are) they ſend in a Flie among them (as the priſoners vſe to tearme him) whom the Inquiſitors caſt in priſon craftily and for a colour, to mark euery mans talke, who after two or three dayes that hee hath once crept into their acquaintance, will begin afarre off to offer ſome talke in matters of Religion, making as though he would be glad either to teach others, or to learn himſelfe, and by theſe ſubtill deuices many of the ſimple ſort are ſoone beguiled. Wherfore let euery man take heed after this faire warning, that he bee not ouerlight of credite in truſting ſtrangers too far (I meane ſuch as are put in priſon with them,) hauing no manner of acquaintance with them before. And to the intent that they may know ſuch a Flie the better, I will giue them one ſure token: to wit, he will commonly be the firſt that will offer talke, and pretend a zeale towards true Religion, both beſide time and without occaſion: and then ſhall they doe well to let him preach alone till his chaps ake, giuing him neuer a word. For if he chance to get any thing out of any of his fellowes that he longed for, ſo ſoone as the Iayler commeth to viſite his priſoners at his accuſtomable houres, hee is ſtraight-way in hand with him to craue a day of hearing for him, as the manner is that ſometimes the priſoners will ſue for. But ſo ſoone as he is out, I warrant them, the reſt that tarry behind, ſhall ſhortly after feele the fruites of his fellowſhip, little to their liking. A maruailous matter, doubtleſs, that men ſhould be ſo diuelliſhly bent, to be content for a ſmall gaine of a little money, to ſerue in ſuch offices, ſo much to their owne hindrance, that to obtaine their purpoſe they ſticke not to lye in priſon with others bound and chayned as they be, by the ſpace of two or three moneths, and then to endure all the other miſeries

incident thereunto, as hunger, filth, ſtench, which the other priſoners can in no caſe away withall by their willes, and yet can theſe men with all their hearts. Beſides this (a more wonderfull thing to conſider) they wil ſo paſſe from one priſon to another, that they are no ſooner out of one, but by and by they willbee in another, and ſo in the ſecond and third, &amp;c. and be content to endure the ſame extreamities twice, thrice, or foure ſundry and ſeuerall times, yea, all their life long to feede vpon theſe diſhes of dainties. And when this good fellow is out of priſon, and come before them to yeeld account of his office, he doth not onely declare what he hath heard the priſoners ſay, but alſo what countenance they made him when hee called theſe matters of Religion into queſtion, and how they tooke it, whether as liking or miſliking therewithall, or what opinion he hath of them, though they neuer anſwered him one word. And this mans accuſation is of as great force as the ſtrongeſt and moſt allowable witnes that is or can be, and is without all exception, be he neuer ſo meane a man either in calling, or credit, or cōmon reputatiō of mē: yea tho he be but a lakes-farmer, &amp; ſerue in his place for a ſmal reward, yet is he reputed a worthy member for that purpoſe, well beſeeming ſuch a head as is that holy Houſe of theirs. It happeneth alſo many times, that ſome ſuch as are apprehended for Religion, fall into the company of ſome that are layd in for ſpeciall matters; who to curry fauour with the Inquiſitors, will villanouſly accuſe their fellowes whom they haue heard confer together in pure and ſound doctrine: and the teſtimony of ſuch perſons is of the greateſt credit that can be, and moſt highly eſteemed in their holy Houſe. For to the ſtate of the matter, or qualification as they tearme it, a great reſpect is to be had of the circumſtances; as the priſon, the perſon of the accuſer, and the party accuſed.
               Other Flies there be alſo which ſerue the holy Houſe to do the like feat abroad out of priſons, ſecretly and ſlily going

about to compaſſe in by like wyles ſuch as are among the common people ſuſpected to be Lutherans; whereof ſome haue ſo good wings, that they will flye quite ouer the ſea into very farre countries to take ſuch as are content to leaue Spayne, and baniſh themſelues thence, to the end that they may liue the more ſafely in other places elſewhere: ſuch is the earneſt zeale which theſe good Fathers haue both to the glory of God, and the health of mens ſoules. But to keep within the bounds of Spaine, &amp; to ſpeak onely of thoſe that flye about the Cities there where this holy Court is kept: there are a great ſort of ghostly Fathers, both Prieſts and Monkes, which are not behind with their parts in playing the Flies. To whom if a ſimple man, and one whom God hath ſent ſome light of his word vnto, doe chance to reſort, and in proceſſe of his confeſſion open his conſcience vnto them, eyther doubtingly, or elſe as only ready perſwaded, praying to be further inſtructed or confirmed▪ they labour not onely to quench that light which began to ſhine in his heart, but ſome of them are in hand with him, either by gentle entreaty, or ſometime by threatning him terribly, to the end to get him to goe to the holy Houſe there to accuſe himſelfe, promiſing him in the behalfe of the Lords the Inquiſitors, that he ſhall haue all fauour ſhewed him that may be: ſo that it commeth to paſſe many times, that the poore ſoules like ſilly ſheepe, will runne of their owne accord into the Wolues mouth to be torne in pieces and deuoured euery morſell.
               Another policy they haue which they put in practice likewiſe, more vnhoneſt by a great deale then this, which is alſo borrowed out of the Inquiſitours budgets. After they haue groped a mans conſcience that ſuſpecteth no ſuch treachery at a holy mans hand, ſpecially vnder their bleſſed Benedicite, they diſſemble the matter for that time without contrarying him, willing him to reſort vnto them the next day when they ſhall haue better leaſure to

hear him thoroughly, and to talke with him more freely in thoſe matters, and ſo ſend him away halfe ſhriuen, with halfe a confeſſion ilfauoredly cut off. His meaning is this, that when the party commeth the next morrow, &amp; communeth with him of the ſelfe ſame matters out of ſhrift, he may freely, and without danger of reuealing his confeſſion, complaine of him to the Inquiſitours: neyther doth this their purpoſe want his performance. This religious rout (forſooth) can choke with agnat, &amp; ſwallow downe a camell. And of ſuch crafty diſſemblers, diuers haue gotten this good by their trauail at the Inquiſitours hands, that if any thing eſcape them ignorantly or for want of heed taking (as it happeneth many times) which had bin enough to haue heaped coales enow vpon anothers mans head, though the ſame things were proued againſt them ſo manifeſtly that they could not bee denied, yet can the Inquiſitours bee content to winde vp ſuch matters and winke at them wiſely, accounting it a greater loſſe to forgoe the gaines that commeth trouling in by ſuch fellowes, than the ſpoile were worth that might bee gotten by taking aduantage of them. Of the which ſort I could, if I were diſpoſed, recken vp a great number by name, and ſure they wel deſerue it for their wicked dealings in this kind of ſeruice, to be ſo ſerued. But I meane to ſuppreſſe their names in conſideration of Gods great might and mercy, who may hereafter ſhew his fauourable countenance vnto them, and grant them grace to repent (as I know hee hath done vnto diuers) and then ſhould I repent mee too late, that their names were made ſo infamous and execrable to the Congregation by my meanes, though for their owne demerits. For truely a great number of theſe at the firſt knew the truth, yea ſome of them preached and taught it to others. But ſo ſoone as the ſtorme began to ariſe, and to trie each mans building vpon what foundatiō it ſtood, on the rock or on the ſands, they thought it wiſedome for them to goe backe with that legge betimes. And being moreouer aſſured

that diuers had them in a great iealouſie for ſo doing, they imagined that they could not ſpunge out that ſtain by any other meanes, then if they ſhould become Promoters of ſuch as had bin their fellowes and companions tofore, &amp; ſo to become dayly Gueſts and ſtout Seruitours to this holy Houſe; and thus were perſwaded that they had taken a readie way to ſaue themſelues from the Inquiſitours. But what conſciences they carrie about within them, and what teſtimonies of the terrible iudgements of God prouided for them, they know beſt themſelues. It ſhall be ſufficient that I giue this Item by the way, to conſider that it is not any zeale in the Inquiſitours of the truth or cutting down hereſies, that moueth them to ſuch butcher-like ſlaughters as theſe (the which things both they pretend to doe, and the common people are like wiſe perſwaded of them) though we ſhould yeeld unto them ſo far that they bee erroneous opinions which they correct ſo ſeuerely. For if it were ſo, then ſhould they not haue fauoured them that that haue done them ſo profitable ſeruice, and procured them ſo great gains as is ſaid before. Nay, all the zeal which they haue, is rather to fill the kings Treaſury &amp; their owne purſes. Yet if we reſpect the chiefe cauſe that moueth them to make ſo many poor innocents to be ſo miſerably puniſhed &amp; tormented, &amp; afterwards put to death, beſides their wiles, their guiles, their villanous breach of faith, and the diuelliſh deuices, by the which they doe procure their matters, it is a ſting of Sathan himſelfe, who hath been a murderer of the children of God, the Father of lyes, and Patron of ſuch practices from the very beginning. For who is ſo blind but hee may eaſily eſpy, that this kinde of dealing can proceed of none other ſpirit? or who will be ſo blaſphemous to refer it to the ſpirit of God as author thereof? Moreouer, one other good leſſon to the godly may be this, that they take diligent heed, whom they deale withall or admit into their company and familiar acquaintance, and not to truſt euery man. For truely the ſaying of Ier

               Yet haue the Inquiſitours one other net more: which albeit they caſt not but at aduenture, yet commonly they draw a great draught whenſoeuer they vſe it. If they chance at any time to apprehēd any notable &amp; famous fellow, whom they know either to be a great teacher or preacher to others, or elſe to haue great reſort made vnto him for learning's ſake and for their better inſtructions, as ſome Doctor and Preacher of ſome name and fame, then their maner is to cauſe it to be bruted abroad by their Familiars, that the ſame perſon being on the rack, hath detected diuers of his Auditors; and for the further confirmation thereof, they ſuborne ſome of the next neighbours in the priſon adioining to auouch it, and to affirme that they heard the great ſhrikes which hee made being vpon the the racke. The which rumors are coyned out of this their holy Mint to this end, that ſuch as haue beene his ſchollers ſhould come to the holy Houſe, and there make open confeſſion of their faults, &amp; craue pardon betimes before they be ſent for, or the Sergeant attach them. For they perſwade the common people, that whoſo will come vncalled and vnſent for, and confeſſe their owne offences, ſhall either eſcape ſcot-free, or elſe very eaſily: and their puniſhment at the vttermoſt ſhal be only the doing of a little penance (as they call it). Thus by this meanes they deceiue a great number, which if they had taried till they had been ſent for, might haue taried ſtill till this time vnſent for; or if it had ſo happened that they had been ſent for, they ſhould haue been no worſe entreated then they were, being ſo doltiſh as to credit the Inquiſitours ſo farre vpon their faire and flattering promiſes, and follow their fooliſh aduice.
            
            
               
               CHAP. X.
               
                  How the priſoners are dealt withall concerning their diet.
               
               THe priſoners within the Inquiſition, concerning their meate and drink &amp; other neceſſaries, are vſed in all reſpects accordingly, as they are in credit with the Inquiſitours and the reſt of the officers of the holie Houſe. For the common eſtimation of them is no better than as they tearme them, dogges, heretickes, &amp;c. And yet they deale not with them altogether ſo well as moſt men will doo with their dogs, that doo them either ſeruice or pleaſure; but as men commonly vſe to intreat thoſe men, whom in deriſion of all humanity they terme dogges, and ſo eſteem of them. The diſcourſe whereof ſhall neither be altogether needeleſſe, nor impertinent in this place, becauſe it may do much good to the godly in many reſpects. Firſt to let them to vnderſtand the miſeries of their poore afflicted bretheren, that they may depart with ſome things for their reliefe, euery man according to his ability: Secondly, to put them in minde that the ſtaffe ſtandeth at their dores, and their turne therefore to bee the next, and that God hath reſerued them for a time, that they may follow the other in this fight, and ſerue him in this moſt glorious kind of ſeruce, by confeſſing his holy name before the world. Thirdly and laſtly, that this horrible and moſt barbarous tyranny of theſe holy Fathers may appeare to all the world among other of their cruell prankes, which wee are to report of them, and of their bloudy butchery. Happy therfore and thriſe happy was that preacher of Siuil, Conſtantine (for ſo Solon accounted him happy that had liued in honour and eſtimation, and died accordingly); who being impriſoned (as I will declare hereafter) for the teſtimony of Chriſts Goſpell, taſting their tyranny and endleſſe torments, bewailed his own miſery, crying and lifting vp his voyce to God many times with theſe wordes: O my Lord God, were there in all the wide world no S

                     ythians, nor

cruell Cannibals, into whoſe hands thou mighteſt haue deliuered mee, and let mee eſcape theſe men? Another named Olmedo, a man ſingular both for vertue and learning, falling likewiſe into the Inquiſitours hands for the ſelfe ſame cauſe that purchaſed vnto Constantine his death, firſt vpon his impriſonment fell ſicke, and afterward died amids the filth and ſtench of the priſon, and was wont to ſay in like ſort: O Lord God, doo with mee what thou wilt. Throw me headlong where thou wilt, ſo thou giue me not ouer to theſe men, whoſe entertainment is ſuch as may more rightly be termed a perpetuall Torture, then a place of Impriſonment. For firſt and formoſt, the place wherein each of them is ſhut vp ſeuerally, what with the The deſcription of the priſons. ſtraightnes thereof, and the euill aire, &amp; damp of the earth, if it be below, may more properly bee likened to a graue, then called a priſon: but if it be aloft, it is at the time of the yeare, by meanes of the extreme heate, more like a frying fornace. And in euery of theſe Holes, for the moſt part (ſpecially if their prizes bee ſo many that there bee moe ſeuerall perſons then ſeuerall roomes) two or three of them are thronged together, ſo that they haue no larger ſcope then to lay them down and reſt them in, ſaue onely a foote in compaſſe perhaps, which ſerueth for their ſtoole of eaſement to ſtand in, and by it a pitcher of of cold water to quench their thirſt. Neither in the day time is their light any more then may come in at a keyhole, or at a little long rift no greater then a mans finger. Howbeit there bee certaine priſons that bee ſomwhat larger, but they are alſo more then ſomwhat coſtly, and doo ſerue for ſuch as are not greatly ſuſpected for religion. Againe, other there bee, leſſe in compaſſe then the former, and worſe a great deale to lie in, for that they are not a mans length: in ſo much that they which enter into one of them, lightly neuer go out till they be halfe rotten, or die of a conſumption. All which places and priſons are beſtowed according to the qualitie of the perſon, and

of his or their deſerts, and many times as it pleaſeth the my Lords the Inquiſitours and maſter Iayler to beſtow them in, according as they beare affection to the party either good or bad. And thus much concerning the place of their impriſonment.
               The order of their dyet is anſwerable to their lodging. The manner of their diet, and their allowance. The rich pay very large fees to the holy Houſe, and euery priſoner is rated at the diſcretion of the Inquiſitour. Out of the which there is deducted an allowance for his daily charges 30 dipondia, commonly called Maruedis, whereof 17. make a dutch batte 8 and a half, a french ſouſe, 10. a flemiſh ſtiuer, which amounteth in our reckning after the Engliſh rate, to 6. pence well nigh. Howb

                  t if any of them be diſpoſed to exceede, &amp; haue any other dainties, he may at his pleaſure, ſo that he pay for it on his owne purſe. And yet they deale not ſo fauourably with euery ſort of priſoners, but onely with ſuch, by whom they looke not to haue any bootie, being laid in but for trifling matters. For if they be ſuch priſoners, as they know by the information giuen in againſt them, likely to loſe all that euer they haue, they will not ſuffer them to exceed in ſuch ſort, but let thē feed only vpon a little brown-bread, and a cruze of cold water, not ſuffering them in any caſe to haue any ſpeciall cates beſides their ordinary, be they neuer ſo rich, becauſe they make this accompt, that the more is ſpent in that ſort, the leſſe ſhall be their parts when it commeth to reckning and rifling. Notwithſtanding, if any be ſo poore that they are not able to liue of their owne in priſon, the King alloweth them a certaine for their daily diet, that is to ſay, halfe a riall of Plate, which is as much as a dutch batte, and is worth two ſouſe french, that is, 3. pence ſterling. Out of the which poore pittance is to be defrayed their Stewards and Laundres wages, and whatſoeuer other neceſſary charges grow beſides, muſt bee thence alſo deducted. Moreouer, of this allowance giuen them by the King, there

commeth not the one halfe to their vſe, for whom it was ſpecially limited &amp; appointed: for it paſſeth through two or three mens hands that will be ready to finger ſome of it. Firſt, thorow the office of Receipt (for ſo I thinke they tearm the Treaſury) who is accountant for all the reuenew

                   that come into the Eſchequer, and disburſeth for ſuch and Fees deducted out of the priſoners allowance. other like vſes. And this is the ſweeteſt office in all the holy Houſe, and therfore not granted but to ſpeciall men, eſpecially fauoured. Next to him the Steward or Cater will haue another peece, who will commonly for one penny beſtowed, demand two to be allowed: then the Cooke that dreſſeth their meate: and laſt of all the tythe which is the Iaylers fees, which many times alloweth the ſame vnto the poore priſoners of his owne beneuolence. This I haue deſcribed the more largely, becauſe all theſe Officers haue their certaine fees out of this ſmall allowance of the king: which paſſing thorow ſuch limed fingers is ſo fleeced, that it commeth not to the priſoners, but euery of theſe Officers will take not onely Tole, but Tythe, ere it paſſe his hands. For in this Houſe both maiſter and man, from head to foot, are all couetous and giuen to the ſpoile. Now if it happen at anie time by a ſpeciall grace of God, that any of theſe are touched with compaſſion to pitie the poore priſoners, and of verie almes doe relieue them by any meanes, that is counted ſuch a 
                     〈…〉
                  ainous offence in this their holy Houſe, that it will goe neare to coſt him a ſcourging till the bloud follow, that doth any way relieue them.
               As it chanced within theſe few yeares, a certaine man to bee appointed keeper of the Inquiſitours priſon in the Caſtle Triana at Siuill, that was not verie euill diſpoſed, for as yet hee had not learned the trickes of that holy Houſe, nor well digeſted their couetous and cruell lawes, being otherwiſe verie courteous, and a man not far ſtricken in yeares: his name was Petro à Herrera. Who entreated the priſoners very well, and ſhewed them ſuch

gentleneſſe and fauour as he could, yet cloſely and couertly, becauſe he knew the Inquiſitours in that poynt well enough, how much they were enclined to tyranny. It happened in his time (as oftentimes it doth when a number are apprehended at once) that among other priſoners, a certaine honeſt Matron was commited to his ward, with two of her owne daughters: which being put into ſeuerall priſons, had a great longing to ſee one another, and each to comfort the other in their diſtreſſes. Whereupon they beſought their keeper to ſuffer them to come together, if it were but onely for a quarter of an howre, or the ſpace that each might but imbrace other. The keeper being of a good nature, was content they ſhould ſo do, and ſuffered them to be together by the ſpace of halfe an houre: &amp; after they had a little ſhewed their affections, and done their duety each to other, the daughters to their mother, and ſhee to them again, hee brought euery one to her owne priſon where ſhee was before. Within a few dayes after, the keeper ſeeing the ſame perſons in moſt terrible torments, and fearing leſt the very extremity thereof would driue them to confeſſe that little curteſie &amp; fauour which hee ſhewed them, in ſuffering them to meete and talke together but onely for halfe an houres ſpace, went to the holy Houſe, confeſſed his fact, and prayed pardon therefore, ſuppoſing like a foole by his owne confeſſion to haue eſcaped the penaltie thereof. But the Inquiſitors (to whom it is incident to abhorre all kind of humanity) deemed it ſo haynous an offence, that they commanded him forthwith to be haled into priſon: wherein, partly by meanes of the great extremitie that was ſhewed vnto him, and partly of very thought and a certaine conceite that hee tooke thereupon, being therewithall ſomwhat melancholike, fell beſide himſelfe: and yet his infirmity and madnes notwithſtanding, they releaſed him no iote of his puniſhment. But after that hee had beene kept a whole yeare in a vile priſon, they brought him vpon their

triumphing ſtage, hauing a Sambenit on his back, and a rope about his neck like a fellon, and there gaue ſentence vpon him: firſt to be whipped about the city in the high ſtreetes, and to haue two hundred ſtripes beſtowed on him, and and afterwards to ſerue in a Gallie as a ſlaue, for ſix yeares. The next day following, as he was brought from the Caſtle Triana with their acucſtomed ſolemnity, to bee ſcourged, one of his madde fits that was wont to take him each other hower, came at the ſame time vpon him very pitifully, ſo that in caſting himſelf off from the Aſſes back wheron he was ſet in deſpight, hee fell vpon the Alguazil, and doubtleſſe had ſlaine him with a ſword which he ſnatched out of his hand, if the people that gathered about him, had not ſuddainly laid hands on him, and ſet him vpon the Aſſe againe, binding him ſomewhat ſurer, to the intent that he might receiue the reſt of his payment. And after he had receiued his two hundred ſtripes, the Inquiſitours commanded, that for his euill vſage &amp; behauior ſhewed towards the Alguazil, he ſhould continue in the gally four yeares moe ouer and aboue the other ſix, to make vp a iuſt halfeſcore. So well doe theſe good and godly Fathers reward charitie and good deeds, and courteſie with crueltie and extremitie, ſo that a mad man with them may not play a mad touch.
               Howbeit, there was one that was this mans predeceſſor called Gaſper Benna
                        •
                     idio, for couetouſnes &amp; cruell dealing a monſter rather then a man, inſomu
                     •
                  h that he was growue to ſuch a greedineſſe, that hee would defraud the poore priſoners of part of their ſmall pittance and allowance, being both euill of it ſelf for want of good cookery, &amp; worſe a great deal by meanes of his filching: of which victuals ſo lurched and purloined from them, hee would make good Marchandice, &amp; ſell them in Triana. Moreouer, ſuch allowance of mony as ſhould haue been paid to a Laundres for waſhing the priſoners clothes, hee conuerted wholly into his owne purſe, nothing regarding how ſluttiſhly the priſoners

went for a great whil together, without any ſhift, &amp; thus deceiuetd both the Inquiſitors &amp; the Treaſurer, who allowed the keeper in his accounts for ſuch &amp; ſuch mony paid &amp; receiued to the priſoners behoof, for whoſe weekly expenſes it was appointed. And herein mark, I beſeech you, the notable negligence &amp; ſlippery dealing of both parties: Firſt, the winking of the Inquiſitours at the keepers behauiour: and ſecondly, the keepers vniuſt oppreſſion of the poor priſoners. But to ſay the truth, it is no very hard matter to deceiue them that wil neuer take paines to boult out a truth. For if any of the priſoners receiuing neuer ſo much iniury at the keepers hand, had complained at any time, or grudged any thing at all, the cruell tyrant would finde the means to be euen with them: for he would take &amp; remoue him from the place that he was in before, and thruſt him into ſome deep Dungeō which they cal Mazorra, &amp; there would keepe him alone for two or three daies, giuing him not ſo much as a little ſtraw to lie vpon: &amp; as for his diet, neyther ſhould it be wholſome, nor yet ſufficient to hold life and ſoul together, but like to kill him, or at the leaſt to breed ſome extream ſickneſſe: all the which ſhould be done without commiſſion or warrant from the Inquiſitors, and yet would he very craftily and maliciouſly beare the priſoner in hand, that he did it wholly by the Inquiſitors ſpeciall commandement. Now if any that had beene ſo iniuriouſly dealt withall, meaning to make complaint thereof to the Inquiſitours, ſhould deſire him to pray a day of hearing (as none may ſolicite that matter ſaue onely the keeper) the craftie knaue ſuſpecting that hereby hee ſhould make a rodde for his owne taile, would beare the priſoner in hand hee had ſo done, and therewithall tell him, it would not bee granted at that time; and thus wlth ſuch forged anſwers would keepe the poore priſoner in that deep dungeon twelue or fifteene daies, till hee thought his anger were ſomewhat aſſwaged, and his courage thorowly cooled, and then at the length would remoue him

thence to his old priſon againe, making the poor man beleeue, that he had cauſe to thank him for it, which of meer compaſſion and pittie that he took vpon him, trauayled to the Inquiſitours, and became an earneſt ſuter to them to get him releaſed. In ſumme, ſuch filching he vſed, and ſuch extremitie hee ſhewed towards the priſoners, that diuers men of very good credit and eſtimation with the Inquiſitours, did make complaints thereof. Whereupon he was committed to priſon, and being found guiltie of diuers kindes of treacheries, yet notwithſtanding in giuing ſentence vpon him, he found the Inquiſitours his very good Lords and maiſters, who knew full well that he had beene a full ſure ſtake to their holy Houſe, and a truſtie ſeruitour: ſo that his iudgement was eaſie enough; nothing like as was giuen vpon the other his ſucceſſour, that only ſuffered the mother &amp; her daughters to meet &amp; talk together for the ſpace but of one halfe hower. albeit for his owne miſdeedes well knowen and proued by him, he deſerued to be dealt withall in as euill ſort altogether, as the other was for his pittie and mercifulneſſe. But to proceed. His iudgement in the end was this: to ſtand vpon the ſcaffold holding a wax taper in his hand, and afterwards to be baniſhed the citie for fiue yeares. And wheras they vſe wholy to confiſcate other mēs goods, they did only put this man to his fine of forfaiting the fee due to him by reaſon of his office, that ſhould haue bin paid vnto him by the holy Houſe: and this was done rather to ſatisfie his accuſers, then for any great zeal of puniſhing ſuch offences done by their holy Officers.
               The very ſame man had a maid-ſeruant in his houſe while he was in office there, who pittying the miſerable eſtate that the poore priſoners were in, pined and hungerſtarued by meanes of that wicked Iew her Maiſter (for ſhe herſelfe fauoured the Goſpel) did diuers times ſpeake vnto them at the grate, comforting &amp; exhorting them ſo wel as ſhe could, to arme themſelues with pacience, and did

ſundry times put vnder the dore ſome good &amp; wholeſom meates for their weake and feeble bodies, declaring no leſſe charity in deedes, then ſhee had before vttered in words. Whoſe zeale (no doubt) was ſo much the more meruailous, that wanting of her own to part withal to Chriſts afflicted members, ſhee would priuily conuey from her Maiſter ſome of the meate which hee had lurched from the priſoners of their due allowance, and ſo reſtore vnto them their owne. And to giue vs the more cauſe to wonder at the miraculous prouidence of God, which of euill ſeede ſendeth not alwaies the worſt corne, but ſomtimes the beſt, this maiden had a little damoſell her maiſters own daughter to help her in theſe her conueiances. Moreouer, by this maydens meanes the priſoners came to vnderſtand one of anothers eſtate▪ and to know in what caſe euery of their afflicted brethren was: the which thing was both a ſingular comfort to themſelues, and a ſpeciall furtherance to their affaires. At the length, this alſo came to the Inquiſitours eares: who, after that they had kept her in priſon a whole yeare, and there made her partaker of the like hardnes that the other priſoners were in, cauſed her to bee brought out vpon the day of their triumph, and ſet vpon the ſcaffold, where they gaue ſentence vpon her, to weare the Sambenite, and to bee whipped about the town with like infamy and extremity as had beene vſed to other before, with two hundred ſtripes: the which was wholly performed the next day following. Beſides this, they did alſo baniſh her the cittie and the ſuburbes for tenne yeares, with this writting on her head. A fauourer and aider of heretikes. Another thing alſo that ſo ſore incenſed the Inquiſitours againſt her, was this: for that it was confeſſed vnto them vpon examination of others, that ſhee had diſcloſed vnto diuers citizens, after what ſort the priſoners were entreated at the Inquiſitours hands, aſwell in their diet as otherwiſe. The which example being compared with the former concerning the fact of her maſter, and the puniſhments

that each of them had therefore, is euidence enough to ſhew what indifferency they vſe in puniſhing malefactours. But to my matter.
               It is a thing that hath neuer beene ſeen nor heard of before The priſoners reſtrained the libertie of ſong. their time, that either the moſt gallie ſlaue, or he that endured the worſt kind of bondage that euer was deuiſed by man, ſhould bee reſtrained and forbidden the ſolace of ſong, to recreate himſelfe withall in the middeſt of his ſorowful dumpes, to driue away fantaſies, and to relieue his penſiue and heauie heart with ſome kind of lightning. But this holy Houſe paſſing &amp; exceeding all the tyrannies that euer haue beene practiſed by or vpon any, depriueth the poore wretches of this ſmall ſolace in their greateſt miſeries and extremities. For if any of the priſoners begin to ſing any Pſalme, to the intent to eaſe his preſent griefe ſomwhat, or do recite any text of ſcripture, the more that the ſaying or ſinging thereof doth eaſe the ſilly ſoule, the greater matter do Inquiſitours and their officers make of it, taking it to be a great hinderance to their affaires if the priſoners be at any time light harted, becauſe their purpoſe is to keepe them in perpetuall ſlauery and thraldome, without hauing any one good day in all their liues. Therfore ſo ſoone as they heare any of the priſoners to ſing or ſay ought aloud, by and by is there a limme or two of the Diuell, that is to ſay, one Notary or other, with the keeper of the priſon to command them ſilence, and to charge them in the Inquiſitours names to make no countenauce of mirth vpon paine of Excommunication. Which if hee ſeeme to contemne and make light of, or elſe to laugh at (as indeede it is no better worthy) hee ſhall haue a bit on on his tong, and be taught his obedience, will he nill he, and thenceforth be taken for a rebell and a contemner of the Inquiſitours authority, and ſhall not bee ſuffered to ſpeake but in a very low note, whereof they themſelues will apoint him the tune, and Sol-fa it before him. This is done for two ſpeciall conſiderations. The one to bereaue

the poor ſoules of all kind of ſolace (as I ſaid before): the other, for that the craftie old Syres learn by dayly experience, that ſuch ſinging of Pſalmes or other ſongs made out of the Scripture, is a maruailous comfort vnto them, and a grea
                     〈…〉
                  couraging and hartening to others their weak brethren that lie a great diſtance from them in other priſons. There is alſo another cauſe why they enioin them ſilence, for that by ſong or loud ſpeaking they might one know of another. Therefore it happeneth many times, that a man and his friend, the father and the ſonne, the husband and the wife, ſhall be all within one priſon-houſe, by the ſpace of two or three yeares together, and neither of them know of the others being there, till the time come that they ſee one another at the great Doom-day vpon the ſcaffold. And vpon this conſideration eſpecially, this is wont to be one of their common queſtions in euery day of hearing: Whether the priſoners of ſeuerall priſons haue conferred or communed together, or the one know of the others being there: and if they find it to be ſo, ſtraight vpon it, they ſhift priſons, and examine them vpon another interrogatory, to beat one thing out of another, if they haue had any maner of conference, or what counſell each of them gaue to the other.
               And this is the whole order of the priſoners diet: ſo that ſuch as goe not to the ſtake, for the moſt part periſh there, eyther of the great filth &amp; ſtench of the priſon; or if they bee deliuered thence, dye ſhortly after of the french diſeaſe, growing vpon them by reaſon of their corrupt and naughtie diet: either elſe of abundance of Melancholy, become altered in their wits, or at the leaſt haue ſuch queſie bodies diſpoſed to theſe or to ſome other greater maladies, that they conſume away by little and little, leading a farre more miſerable life, than were any death that they could dye. For proofe whereof, out of a number of examples, that might be brought only out of the Inquiſition at Siuil, I wil chuſe one worthy to be reported in al Chronicles for a

ſpeciall example of their barbarous dealings.
               Not many yeares agoe, there arriued a certaine Engliſh ſhip into the port S. Lucars, which the Familiars going aboord vpon, to make ſearch for Religion, as their manner is to doe before any man of them may be ſuffered to come on land, they tooke and carryed with them to priſon diuers Engliſhmen that were in her, vpon ſuſpicion which they had on them to be profeſſors of the Goſpell, by certaine tokens and likelihoods which they eſpyed in them, and knew them by. In the ſame ſhip there was alſo a little boy not paſſing tenne or twelue yeares of age, ſonne to a very rich Marchant of England, that was owner (as they ſaid) both of the ſhip, and the moſt part of her lading. Among other they tooke alſo this yong child (as they pretended) for hauing in his hands Dauids Pſalmes in Engliſh. But whoſo doth indifferently vnderſtand of their couetouſneſſe and naughty practices, may well thinke without any offence to the holy Inquiſition, that the Fathers wealth was the occaſion, both of the childs impriſonment, and of the other miſery that did befall him afterward. Wherupon, they made Sequestration of the ſhip and goods, and carryed the child to priſon with the reſt of his company, where he aboad by the ſpace of 6. or 8 moneths. This child was ſo well brought vp by his parents in vertue and good diſcipline, and the ſame tooke ſo deepe root in him, being dewed with the grace of God, that notwithſtanding his tender age and hard impriſonment, he ceaſed not ſtill to giue moſt euident tokens of the ſame his good and godly education: inſomuch that many and ſundry times, but ſpecially euery morning and euening, hee did accuſtomably vſe to lift vp his eyes to heauen, and to call vpon God, from whence he was taught to looke and hope for all helpe and ſuccour. And as his keeper eſpyed him now and then making his prayers in that ſort, whereas he ought to haue beene aſhamed of himſelfe and of his paganiſme, to ſee in ſo tender age ſuch a patterne of piety and

godlines before his face, in ſtead thereof, ſo ſoone as he beheld him lifting vp his eyes to heauen, ſaying ſome Pſalm or other prayers in Engliſh, Now ſurely (ſaith he) this boy is become a pretty heretick already. After the child had continued the foreſaid ſpace in that darke dungeon (being tenderly brought vp to fore in his fathers houſe) by reaſon the moiſture &amp; dampe of the priſon, &amp; of his corrup

                  et, he fell into an extreame ſicknes. Whereof as ſoone as the Inquiſitors had intelligence, they gaue commandement to remoue him thence, and to carie him to the Cardinals hoſpitall till hee were recouered. This hoſpitall is a houſe T

Howbeit they are not dealt withall there in any thing more gently then they were before in their priſons, ſauing onely that they haue phyſick, which is allowed them verie liberally by the Hoſpitall, and may tender their bodies ſomwhat more charily for their healthes ſake. Neither may any man bee ſuffered to reſort to the patient, but his phyſi

But ſo ſoone as the patient beginneth to bee on the mending hand, though hee bee not altogether ſound, and perfectly whole, he is carried thither from whence he came. Marry this child being by reaſon of a great ſicknes which he caught in this long and painefull impriſonment, remoued into this Hoſpitall, became benummed in his legs, neither can any man tell any certainty what became of him afterward. Let euery man weigh now with himſelfe &amp; conſider, whether it beſeeme theſe good fathers ſo rudely to deale with a child and a ſtrāger, or if there be found any ſuch vnreaſonable kind of dealing among the wild Sc

               At the ſame verie time welnigh there was a certaine Turke taken and carried to the ſame priſon, who had voluntarily forſaken and abiured the Mahometical impietie, and was newly come from Marrock, the chiefe Cittie and

head of the realm of Mauritania, into that part of Spaine that lyeth directly ouer againſt it, diuided by Midland ſea. But ſauouring as yet of that venemous licour, wherewith he was poiſoned in his cradle, and fed withall from his infancy (for as yet he had not takē out any one leſſon of Chriſtianitie for want of a teacher) and finding moe faults and worſe enormities among the Chriſtians, than hee had left behinde him among his countreymen the Mores, ſuppoſing himſelfe to bee in good ſafetie there, and therefore more careleſſe, happened to ſay on a time, that the Moriſh law (meaning their religion) was farre better than the Chriſtians: for the which ſaying hee fell into the Inquiſitours hands; who to the end that they might bring him into a better mind, ſchooled and catechiſed him in ſuch ſort, that he confeſſed in priſon plainly, that from the firſt day of his Chriſtendom it neuer repented him that he was become a Chriſtian, till he came within the Inquiſitours iuriſdiction, where it grieued him to ſee force and violence, wrongs, iniuries, and tyrannie of all ſorts, executed with extremitie.
            
            
               CHAP. XI.
               
                  The priſoners viſitation.
               
               IT hath beene a cuſtome generally receiued in all places which haue ſought to bee renowned by ſitting in the ſeate of Iuſtice and equitie vprightly and indifferently, that certaine times ſhould ſpecially bee appointed for the viſitation of priſons, to the intent that the keepers ſhould not oppreſſe their priſoners, but that ſuch iniuries as eyther they had alreadie, or thereafter might receiue, ſhould bee redreſſed, and preuented, by the ouerſight of the chiefe rulers and iudges, ſo oft as neede were. A thing which both conſcience craueth, and the law of nature, &amp; all policie and good gouernment: laſt of all, God by his word commandeth, wherein the caſe and poore eſtate of ſuch as lye in bonds, is commended vnto vs, and giuen vs ſpecially in charge to be conſidered. Wherefore, to reſiſt

a number of wrongs (beſides other that come not to our eares) which the report was that the holy Houſe had done to their priſoners, where there was no good to be done any way but one (I mean by the viſitation of priſon-houſes) marke I beſeech you the Inquiſitours, &amp; conſider ye what hypocrits they are: which in reſpect of their holy houſe &amp; Conſiſtorie, with their glorious titles, and the very name of Sanctity, wherin they ſeeme to excell all other prophane and temporall Courts, ſhould haue bin by all reaſon more bountifull and gentle, more full of comfort and charity, and in withſtanding iniuries, moſt iuſt and vpright, carefully prouiding for the neceſſities of the poore afflicted, and duely puniſhing ſuch as had wronged them any way, eyther by couetous or cruell dealing: yet were they ſo farre from doing their dueties herein, that it ſeemeth rather their viſitation was deuiſed of purpoſe to a clean contrary end: in ſo much that the dayes when they keep their viſitations, may be more worthily termed dayes of Doom to the poore priſoners, than be thought meanes of eaſe or reliefe of their miſeries; as it appeareth moſt euidently by their common maner of dealing, on ſuch dayes appointed for the viſitation. Whereof wee purpoſe here to make rehearſall.
               The viſitation of priſons is commonly once or twice euery moneth kept by the Inquiſitors, a Notary, and the Keeper, &amp; for the moſt part vpon the Sunday or ſome other feſtiuall day. The maner of it is on this wiſe. At the very firſt entrance into the priſon, the Inquiſitor demandeth of the priſoners theſe queſtions: How it is with them: The maner of their viſitations. what they want: whether their Keeper giue them any euill language, or threaten them, or vſe any words of deſpight or reproach towards them: if he giue them their ful allowance in their diet duly and truly, or prouide them ſhift of ſhirtes, with ſuch words. For in very deede there is no hope of one drop of comfort at their hands for all this buſineſſe: but are onely words and queſtions of common

courſe, &amp; ſpeciall articles preſcribed vnto them to inquire vpon, whereunto they neither adde any more in words, nor performe ſo much in deeds. As; if the priſoner be halfe naked, or want a couch to reſt him on, and ſhould pray that his neceſſity may be conſidered &amp; prouided for, they ſhape him ſuch an anſwer as ſerueth thē both for winter &amp; ſūmer. And their anſwer in ſummer is thus, in very mild &amp; fatherly terms: Well (ſay they) now the weather is warm, you may liue full well without either clothes or couch. And for winter in this ſort: True it is, it hath bin a great froſt of late, but now that it thaweth, and the cold is come downe and reſolued into ſnow and raine, ſo that the ayre is open and cleared, you ſhall haue a more ſeaſonable time. Care you for the garments wherewithall you ſhould cloth your ſoule, which ſtandeth in vttering the truth, and diſcharging your conſcience before this holy Houſe: for this ſhould be your ſpeciall care. And here is all the prouiſion which they make for them, for all their queſtioning at the firſt; and ſo departing as they came, their viſitation in the end turneth but to a ieſt: ſo that, if their viſitations were dayly, ye ſee all the comfort that the priſoners ſhould haue at theſe holy Fathers hands. Yet notwithhanding true it is, that ſome ſuch whom they owe ſpeciall fauour vnto, receiue ſome curteſie at their hands, and eaſie it is to iudge who they be that find it, where coueteouſnes and cruelty keep their Court.
               Likewiſe if any of the priſoners, either learned or vnlearned, deſire to haue ſome good book, or the holy bible permitted them to read, to the intent to paſs that troubleſome and carefull time away to ſome profit, they ſhift him off with the like anſwer for a book, as they vſe before to him that was naked and without garments. For the Inquiſitour will anſwer him-like a graue counſeller, That the true booke is, to ſpeake the truth, and to diſcharge his conſcience in that holy Court, and that hee ought to bee occupied in that booke, that by recounting and recording

thereof, hee might lay open his wounds and ſoares to their Lordſhips, that were moſt readie to giue him a plaiſter: and this (ſay the
                     •
                  ) is the true booke, &amp;c. But if the priſ
                     〈…〉
                   bee
                     〈…〉
                   and importunate in crauing the ſame, either at 
                     〈…〉
                   the next viſitation; hee ſhall be taught to hold his peace, and to be anſwered with reaſon. For if hee be ſo 
                     〈…〉
                  ke what liketh him, they will bee ſo good as to deny what liketh not them. To bee ſhort, they ſeeme to be wholly bent vpon his thing of purpoſe, diligently to ſee vnto it, that the priſoner haue nothing to looke or think vp but only his preſent eſtate in miſery, that the grief thereof grating vpon him, may force him the rather to ſatisfie their requeſts as much as may be. Howbeit, if the priſoner haue any friends or kinsfolke that a
                     •
                  e able to relieue his miſery by any meanes, perhaps they will ſend the Inquiſitour ſome prettie preſent or other, to obtaine his fauour &amp; good will, that their kinſeman may be ſomwhat more fauourably entreated. Now, all the hardneſſe of this matter reſteth on this point, to get the Inquiſitour to take it. But for any other vnder-officers, it is an eaſie matter to bribe them, ſo it be done priuily or by night: for ſuch fellows will ſoon be corrupted. Marrie their maiſters make it ſomwhat more daintie and ſtrange: yea it were a thing impoſſible, if a man would take their firſt nay. Which commonly is after this ſort; that this holy Court is a Court incorrupt, that can away with bribes in no caſe, &amp;c. But ſith their anſwers are but from the teeth outward, all this adoo in excuſing themſelues, and refuſing the proffer, is a plaine token that they would bee content to haue it with all their hearts. Therefore is the Inquiſitour for the moſt part neuer without ſome of his brethren or ſiſters children about him, or ſome one ſeruant to whom hee ſheweth ſpeciall fauour and good will: the which ſeruant muſt be tendered and regarded as much as himſelfe. Then is there alſo another wayter that ſtanding by and ſeeing this great adoo betwixt the Inquiſitour and the other party,

the one proffering, and the other refuſing as faſt, when the party beginneth to relent, ſhall come vnto him immediatly, and teach him a trick how to obtain his purpoſe, &amp; entring talk with him without any manner of occaſion, wil point him to one with his finger, and ſay, Sir, ſee ye yonder the young gentleman that ſtandeth at my Lords elbow? He is my Lords Nephue. Now is there none ſo very an Aſſe, that hauing made ſo much adoo in tempting the Inquiſitour, but hee may eaſily perceiue that there is one ready to hold the poke, and to receiue his proffer, though the other refuſed it. And ſo by this meanes at the length the poore priſoners get ſomewhat releaſed. Whereby it is apparant, what ſpirit this holy Houſe is gouerned by, when couetouſneſſe is able more to preuail with them to further a deed of charity, than charity for her owne ſake could euer haue gotten or obtained at their hands.

                  The act contayning the publication of the Sentences.
               
               THere remaineth now the laſt Act of the Tragedy, wch is the very winding vp of all that is to be done in this holy Court. Wherein both parties are pleaſed, &amp; haue their deſire. The Inquiſitours in obtayning their prey: the priſoners ſeeing the terrible and continuall torments, the ſubtill ſleights and practices of the Inquiſitours, with their extream and cruell dealings, grow to an end. For then doe they heare their finall iudgements after their matters haue been toſſed to and fro many yeares in open Court, and in ſo great an audience and aſſembly, as there hath not been ſeen a greater, no not at Olimpus it ſelf. This Act of Faith they commonly called Auto. And ſurely good cauſe why. For then is the priſoners faith tried to the vttermoſt, and ſheweth it ſelfe what it is, either by denying and abiuring Gods truth in open and ſolemne audience, or elſe by ſtanding ſtoutly and manfully therein, in like ſolemnity of ſhew and view of all the people, thronging together purpoſely. Let the inquiſitours therfore deriue the word, and deſcant

of it as they pleaſe: we doo conſtrue it thus, as in a ſence moſt agreeable to Gods iudgement.
               This act hath many idle deuices, or to ſpeake more aptly, this Paſcall of Gods people Pelah: that is to ſay, this paſſage out of Egypt to the land of promiſe, I meane from the world to God, hath his Euen, his preparation. Ioſ. 13. For a few dayes before this feaſt, the Inquiſitours vſe to call into the Court ſeuerally one after other, all ſuch perſons whoſe goods are confiſcate: examining them what lands or goods they haue, and where they lie, charging them earneſtly that they conceale not one iot; declaring vnto them further, that if afterward it can be proued that they haue kept any thing back, both fellonie ſhall be laid to their charge, and they alſo in whoſe hands it is found ſhall pay for it moſt aſſuredly. After they haue confeſſed the whole truth of all their other goods and ſubſtance, beſides ſuch as were taken and found in their owne houſe at the firſt time of their apprehenſion, and ſo ſequeſtred, and that all be eſtreited into the accomptes of the Eſchecquer, they returne euery one to his own priſon againe, being aſſured to loſe all their goods, howſoeuer they eſcape with their liues.
               But the right Euen is the daie next and immediately going before the feſtiuall day. For then towards night they cauſe all the men to bee brought together into a large priſon houſe, ſuch as are appoynted to bee brought forth the next morrow to doo diuers kindes of penance before all the people, according as it is enioyned vnto them in their ſeuerall ſentences. This word penance, is a word borrowed and vſurped by them vpon the vſe of the old primitiue Church, for certaine penalties and puniſhments vſurped towards offenders. Into another like priſon they bring all the women together likewiſe. But ſuch as are iudged to death, are put each in their ſeuerall priſons

again, about 9. or 10. of the clock at night, there is ſent to each of them ſome pelting Prieſt to cary them this heauie tidings, and to be their ghoſtly father. And now at this laſt inſtant, the man to whom God hath giuen the ſpirit of conſtancy and boldnes, maketh his laſt proteſtation of his faith, to the ſhame of his Confeſſour, and confuſion of all that helliſh army. But on the other part, hee that hath not beene conſtant to fore, nor is at this preſent, hath now a time to call for grace at Gods handes (the onely giuer of all gifts and graces) thoſe eſpeciall gifts of conſtancy and patience. Howbeit both ſortes haue much to do with their ghoſtly fathers: the one in maintenance of their faith now in their laſt howre and moſt dangerous time of all: the other in hopeleſſe entreating and praying their pardon of life. Yet is there neither of them both but in that night they are occupied on euery ſide, ſuſtaining (no doubt) a great temptation, both in that their fleſh is fraile, and the diuell ſtirring; and yet ſure it is, that the heauenly Father forgetteth not his children in that howre. Yea, this night wherein his members ſuffer ſuch agony, may be well reſembled vnto that, which God himſelfe the head of all, ſuffred, both for the anguiſh of the patients, and the comfort that came from heauen.
               The next morrow by day breake, the Familiars and all the reſt of the officers pertaining to the Inquiſition, aſſemble together euery man to doe his office about this holy Sacrifice, and to attire ſuch priſoners as are to be brought out before the people euery one in his aray, very curiouſly, in ſuch ſort as was by the ſentence pronounced &amp; preſcribed. Whereof ſuch as ſtood ſtoutly to their tackling, &amp; defended their profeſſion againſt their deteſtable falſhoods, weare the Sambenit vnto the very ſtake, which is a linnen garment of the colour of the earth, made like to a coate-armour, The deſcription of the Sambenit and all to be painted with black diuels, ouer whom the manful ſouldiour of Chriſt triumpheth in token of victorie.

On his head he hath a hat long like a turret, wheron is pictured the image of a man burning in the fire with many diuels about him, plying him with ſire and fagots. It is much after the maner of a foughten field, as I may liken it. For there is the whole skirmiſh, with the ouerthrow of his enemies, ſet for a greater glory &amp; ſhew of conqueſt and victory. Moreouer, their tongues are nipped and pinched with a cleft peece of wood which they call Mordazas, of the Latin word Mordeo to bite, becauſe the priſoners ſhould not make any proteſtation before the people, either of their innocency, or of their beliefe; hauing beſides this about their necks new cords made of bentes, and their hands faſt bound behind them. Whereby he declareth (in mine opinion) like a good champion (though his deſerts in other reſpects be ſomewhat) yet that hee repoſeth no truſt or confidence in them, but in the onely and vnſpeakeable mercies of God, for the confeſſing of whoſe holy name he is readie to dye the moſt terrible death, &amp; ſo will appeare before the iudgement ſeate of God: whereas if God ſhould deale with him ſtraitly according to the letter and the law, notwithſtanding all thoſe glorious workes that make him ſo famous among men, hee ſhould well find, there were nothing remaining for him in the end, but the deſtinie and reward of a villanous theefe. And on this ſort come theſe conſtant martyrs diſguiſed, and bearing theſe badges: firſt vpon the ſtage, &amp; ſo conſequently to the ſtake. Likewiſe, they that by reuolting and denying the truth, haue brought the Fathers in ſome hope of their ſaluation, haue iudgement of death neuertheleſſe, and are arayed in like ſort, ſaue only that in ſteede of the diuels pictures, there is the image of the croſſe, hauing their hands bound in like ſort; that as the other haue borne the enſignes &amp; cognizance of true faith and manly courage, ſo theſe may carrie alſo the badges of daſtardie &amp; falſe faith. And in like ſort doe all the reſt come forth, arayed as the other, and beſette with like badges more or leſſe, as

it pleaſeth the Inquiſitours to diſgrace them in the ſight of the people.
               But at what time the priſoners are ready to paſſe out of the Caſtle Triana where they were impriſoned, then the holy Houſe affecteth of purpoſe to ſeeme full of pitty and charitie towards them, in the ſight of the common people. For after that they bee diſguiſed on this ſort, and euery man ſet in his order as he ſhall iſſue forth, they are commanded to pauſe a while, and forth with are certaine tables ſpread for them as they ſtand, and a very plentifull breakfaſt in ſhew, of roſted hennes, kidde, and ſuch like prepared, wherewith they would blind the common ſort, and perſwade them, that they had bin none otherwiſe vſed in priſon, beginning now at the laſt to make them amends for the euill entertainment which they had before. Howbeit the poor ſouls are in that taking at that time, that they will doe the meat no great harme, and therfore thoſe cut-throats the Familiars, wch vſe to gard the priſoners on each ſide, do cōmonly ſnatch the meat from before them, &amp; deuour it without either check or controlement. As for the preparation, ſuch is their ſtate in that triumph, as neuer was The order of the Inquiſitours triumph. the like pomp in Perſia, nor triumph in Rome comparable therunto. Firſt &amp; formoſt goe the Children of the Colledge where the youth is brought vp at learning, who both with their apparel, &amp; ſong, &amp; aray which they are kept in by certaine Clerkes that walke vp and down by them in ſurpluſſes, moue a pretty deuotion. Their dittie is the letanies: the one part of the Quier anſwering another, and the foote of their ſong is, Ora pro illis. After them goe ſuch as doe penance, placed as it were in certain degrees, ſo that ſuch as haue the eaſieſt puniſhments goe next in order vnto the Children, and are to bee diſcerned from other by theſe tokens: tapers in their hands vnlighted, ropes about their necks, &amp; Barnacles vpon their tongues, with hats of paper, bare-headed, except they put on thoſe hats, but without clokes like ſlaues: &amp; the better or richer man commeth alwaies

hindmoſt. Next vnto theſe goe they that are diſguiſed in Sambenites, that is to ſay, a linnen garment ſhaped like a coat-armour with a red croſſe ouerthwart, obſeruing the ſtate and condition of euery perſon, as is ſaid before. But ſuch as haue bin berayed with their Orders, are preferred before others, both for eſtimation &amp; place. Laſtly cōmeth in the third rank, thoſe that are condemned to the fire: of the wch ſort, ſo many as haue refuſed Gods truth, and betaken themſelues in ſteed thereof to lyes, in hope of mercy at mans hand, doe well deſerue to goe before the reſt that remained conſtāt to the end, whom the Inquiſitors place in the rereward as the fitteſt place for them euen in their own iudgements, in reſpect of their vertue and faith. Alſo on each hand of euery priſoner, there goeth a Familiar all armed to gard him, and beſides them two Monks or Theati

                      Ieſuites (as they term them) attending on euery one that is ready to ſuffer, to perſwade them tooth &amp; naile, not to cleaue vnto that doctrine now at their departure out of this world, wherein they haue bin trained and taught hitherto. Which wicked importunity is as great a grief in my fācy to him that conſtantly hath perſeuered hitherto, as any torment that hee hath endured. Immediately after the priſoners, doe follow in order, as the maner is in all ſolemnities, firſt the whole ſtate of the City, which conſiſteth vpon Alguaziles, Conſtables, Gouernours of the 24. Wards, the Iudges of euerie Court, the Regent or Viceroy and Aſſiſtant, and after them a great troupe of noble gentlemen on horſeback: next vnto them the State eccleſiaſticall. In the firſt rank the Clerks, Vicars and Curats: in the ſecond the whole Chapiter of the Cathedrall Church commonly called Cabildum Eccleſiae maioris: In the third place the Abbots and Priors with their Couentes: and laſt of all, after all theſe followeth the holy Houſe, which triumpheth indeede, and is in iolly ſtate that day. Before whom as they paſſe, there is a way made in reſpect of their honours, and a compaſſe kept, wherein the

                  Fiſcal, one that taketh no ſmall paines in the holy Houſes behalfe towards the obtaining of this victory, hauing a flagge of red damaske diſplaied in warlick faſhion (for all the world) occupieth the place of the Standard-bearer.
               The flag is of turky worke, full of much good workmanſhip, and hath on the one ſide the Popes armes that firſt granted the charter of the Inquiſition, and on the other the image of King Ferdinando that firſt admitted it, all verie ſumptuouſly embrodered with ſilke and purple: and in the top of the Standard is fixed a rich croſſe of ſiluer and gilt with the crucifixe, which the people make after more ſuperſtitiouſly a great deale, than they doe after anie other croſſe, onely becauſe it is the croſſe pertaining to the holy Inquiſition. Laſt of all, come the Fathers themſelues a verie ſoft ſet pace for grauity ſake, triumphantly as chiefe Emperours of that conqueſt. Hard at their heeles follow the Familiars and Promoters belonging to the holy Houſe, all on horſeback, as the maner was in the triumphes at Rome for euery Captaine conquerour to haue his ſouldiers hard at his elbow. After the which, come the common people hand ouer head with a wonderfull preſſe. With this pomp they paſſe from Triana where the Inquiſitours priſon is, to a certain ſcaffold made of wood, and reared vp a good height in the middeſt of the high ſtreet and chiefe of all the citie, for the Penitentiaries to ſtand vpon in view of all the people, there to hear the ſentence pronounced vpon them. Being come vpon the ſcaffold, they cauſe them to ſit downe, euery man and woman in the ſame order that he or ſhe came in. Right ouer againſt the which, there is alſo another ſtage ſet vp of like quantitie, wherein is erected a ſtately kinde of Conſiſtory for the Inquiſitours, where they ſit in their maieſtie like gods with all their traine about them that followed them thither.
               Here it would not be impertinēt (as I iudge) to diſcourſe a little in comparing the Triumph of our aduerſaries with

the publicke Penance vſed in the primitiue Church, and ſet out by theſe godly Biſhops and Paſtours in thoſe daies, The maner of the pe

And his ſhame was for his offence, but the eaſe of his griefe; and the plaiſter which the Paſtours and Preachers applied to his ruptures, was the perfect Plaiſter and true Sanatiue, that healed his wounded and corrupt conſcience. Neyther was it their maner that preſcribed the penance, to triumph on that day, or to ſend for their braueſt ſutes out of their wardrobes, to goe and ſhew themſelues abroad-in in token of ioy and victorie: but came themſelues in mourning weede, and ſo likewiſe did the whole congregation, declaring by that outward ſhew of ſorrow, that their hearts were touched inwardly with the fall and infirmities of their brethren. Inſomuch that manie times the Cenſors themſelues haue been ſeen to ſhed moe teares than haue the Penitentiaries, vnfainedly ſorrowing the ſhame which the other ſuſtained (as right and reaſon was) for their miſdeeds. Neither was any of them put to any kind of death one or other, or ſo ſmartly ſcourged, that by meanes of the ſtripes pearcing ſo deep, a man might haue ſeene the bare bone, nor the vtter ſhame &amp; diſcredite both of themſelues and their whole poſteritie ſought hereby: but whatſoeuer was done, it was referred to this end, that they might recouer the good name again among the congregation, wch they had loſt before by their miſdeameanor. As for any of the Preachers or Miniſters, none of them had any allowance or fees from the Eſchecquer, or any one fleece or locke of wool from the backes of any of his flocke, neyther was any thing found in their houſes that came by ſpoile of the poore. Ezechiel 34. Eſay 3. Woe be to you ſhepheards, &amp;c. Againſt the which albeit there be good cauſe to complain and cry out preſently, yet may

there perhaps be ſome other oportunitie elſwhere to do it. My meaning in this place is, onely to make a plat without any order or faſhion, that ſuch as haue any ſenſe at all left within them in this vniuerſall time of ignorance and dotage, may beginne to weigh and conſider what difference there is betwixt theſe triumphes ſet out with ſuch preparation and iollitie, and the publick penance vſed in the Primitiue Church, which the holie Houſe braggeth ſo much that they retaine till this day.
               Thus, when euery man hath taken his place in order, one beginneth a Sermon, which is purpoſely deuiſed much in commendation of the holy Houſe, and the confutatiō of ſuch hereſies as they are preſently about to proſecute. But the greateſt part of it is ſpent in ſhamefull and ſlanderous reproaches, wherewith they charge the good chriſtians, adding one trouble and griefe in the neck of another. Which if they ſeeme to take in good part, ſeeing themſelues ſet there as wondering ſtocks to all the world, and marks for them to ſhoot all their diueliſh darts of ſhamefull and reproachfull ſlanders at, either it is becauſe they beare them off with the ſure buckler of faith: or elſe by reaſon that they haue been acquainted therewith, and their hearts hardned with ſuch continuall exerciſe, like ſenceleſſe men they feel now no touch of them. When the ſermon is finiſhed, they begin to reade the ſentences giuen vpō the penitentiaries in order as euery man came, or in place as they ſit, beginning with ſuch as are to haue the eaſieſt iudgements and puniſhments firſt. This part of the Act is ſomwhat long, &amp; becauſe it is the chiefeſt part, therefore it requireth ſome ſpeciall treatiſe, but hereafter in more conuenient place. The Sentences being thus orderly al pronounced, the chiefe Commiſſioner for the Inquiſition ſingeth certain ſhort praiers for the Conuerts (as they call them) which neuertheleſſe muſt die alſo: the effect wherof is, that God would vouchafe to extend his mercy and fauour towards them, that they may perſeuer in confeſſing

the doctrine of the Church of Rome, &amp; die therin. Which don, they begin to ſing Miſerere the 51. Pſalme for the obtaining of Gods fauour and mercy towards the Penitentiaries; and that the diſcipline and abſolutions done and executed vpon them by the Fathers, may be effectuall &amp; auailable vnto them to true repentance. The ſentences are moſt commonly theſe. Death without mercie: Whipping with extremitie, that the parties either not at all, or elſe verie hardly eſcape with their liues: Condemnation to the gally, &amp; Forfaiture of all their goods, with ſuch like penalties, wherein the good mother-church of Rome extendeth her pittie and compaſſion towards her children by the Inquiſitours as by her meanes, thinking the proofe and the effect of true repentance neceſſarily to conſiſt therein. Now ſurely the whole world may ſee and perceiue (and that not onely ſuch as haue drunke of her cup) the ourageous tyrannie of ſuch Termagants as haue bragged and boaſted of themſelues, that they are the true Church of Chriſt, and be occaſioned thereby to remember themſelues, and to eſteeme of them as they are.
               The Pſalme being ended, which they abuſe to their purpoſe moſt impudently and abominably, in a plaine mockerie (as they doe commonly all other places of Scripture) the chiefe Inquiſitour ſingeth a ſort of Verſicles: and the whole Quier anſwereth them with their Reſponſes, in a high and a loud note, ſtrayning their cunning and pipes to the vttermoſt. Which done, the Inquiſitour of his abſolute authoritie pronounceth abſolution in a kind of note, wherein hee abſolueth all ſuch as are come home to the church of Rome (but forſaken Chriſt) from all their errors whereof they ſhew themſelues penitent, foraſmuch as they haue ſwe
                     •
                  ued from the Romiſh church. Howbeit this abſolution muſt haue none other conſtruction, than hath the Romiſh abſolution à culpa tantum, but not à poena. that is to ſay, from the fault only,

not from the penalty. For they muſt forth with, notwithſtanding this their recantation, abide the penalties without either mercy, iuſtice, or conſcience.
               After the abſolution, the Inquiſitours haue yet one other notable deuice to vphold their kingdom withall as it were with anker and chaine cable, which is a manifeſt proofe, that they are halfe in doubt, leſt nor they nor their kingdome ſhould long continue. And the deuice is this: That all the people gathered together at that time, whereof ſome come to ſee the ſolemnity aboue 20. leagues off, take a ſolemne oath before them, and bind themſelues thereby, vowing the performance thereof, that they will liue and dye in the ſeruice and obedience of the church of Rome, and by all meanes poſſible, to their power defend and maintaine it, hazarding both life and goods againſt any whoſoeuer ſhall goe about to ouerthrow it. Moreouer, they make them to forſweare and curſe, whatſoeuer is contrary to that which the church of Rome holdeth and affirmeth for true. Alſo that to their power they ſhall maintaine and vphold the holie Houſe, and defend all the officers thereof, &amp;c. In witnes wherof, and for a further ſurety of the matter, they take recor
                     〈…〉
                  one of another. And then may a man ſee the ſilly common people, &amp; thoſe of higher eſtate and degree crouch to the earth with great deuotion, and through ignorance take their oaths againſt God and his anointed, raſhly &amp; wickedly conſpiring together, euery man to his power, to be a promoter and ſetter forward of the Inquiſition. Now if you talk with any man about the aboliſhing of this monſter of all wickednes and iniquity out of the world, though he confeſſe of himſelfe, and grant indeede, that there is much cruelty &amp; tyranny vſed therin: he will tell you a tale again, of his ſolemne oath taken and vow vowed, in open and ſolemne audience, and what can ye reply to him then? Marry (ſir) thus. How that certain of the Iewes of very blind ignorance &amp; ſuperſtition did bind themſelues with an oath, and made a ſolemne vow, that

they would neither eate nor drinke till they had ſlain Paul, Act. 23. And theſe men (ſay we) ſinne thrice ſo deepely as they, and therefore are leſſe bound to ſeeke to ſaue their oath, ſo wickedly taken and ſo vngodly. Firſt, for that they of a blind and therefore a wicked zeale, in defence of their law, do fight againſt the Goſpell of Chriſt. Secondly, in abuſing and abhominably prophaning the name of God, ſwearing by his holy name, with al their might &amp; main, to maintaine an euill quarrell, and depreſſe a better, which lieth not in them to do. Thirdly, whereas they ſhould in time reuoke and retract all things begun againſt God and his holy word, they do ſtill proceed &amp; go forward in their purpoſe like the ſtubburne and ſtifnecked Iewes. Can any man come in now and auer the contrary? But when it ſhall bee moſt manifeſtly proued, that the Inquiſitors haue gon about buſily &amp; of purpoſe to deſtroy the kingdom of Chriſt, as did the wicked Iewes, then ſhal it alſo be euident and apparant, that ſuch as haue vowed this ſolemne oath, though it were of ignorance, haue incurred all thoſe three ſeuerall offences. Wherefore, if they will take vp themſelues, and learne to be wiſe in time, this will bee one way and meanes for them to recouer their ſaluation. Firſt, to conſider diligently what kind of quarrel the Inquiſitours do take in hand to maintaine. Secondly, to weigh with themſelues, whether they fight vnder the Inquiſitours banner for Chriſt, or againſt Chriſt, and ſo let them keepe or breake their oath, as they ſhall thinke good, after they haue debated the matter thorowly. Now to our purpoſe againe.
               After all things thus done and finiſhed, if any there bee among the Penitentiaries that deſerue to be ſo ſerued, they are ſtraight-way degraded: and the Biſhop that miniſtred the orders to the party, plaieth that part, arraied all in his Pontificalibus. The ceremonies vſed about the actuall degradation (as they terme it) of him that is to bee executed that day, are both ſtrange and tragicall. Firſt,

they apparell him in his maſsing robes, as though he were readie to d
                     ••
                   maſſe, and afterwards diſpoile him againe of euery trinket one after another, vſing both dog-trickes, The maner of degradation. and termes of coniuration about euerie of the ornaments, contrariwiſe to that that they did before at the firſt putting on thereof, when hee entred into orders. Then are his hands, lips, and crowne, ſcraped with a broken glaſſe or ſome ſharp knife, in token that they ſcrape off the oyle that hee was greaſed withall at his firſt initiation. All the which is done in the full view and wonder of all the people, ſome pitying the poore man, and ſome curſing him worſe than lew or Pagane, being indeede moſt happie, if it bee but for this one thing, that in the latter end of his life hee cryeth abrenuntio to that greaſie and ſtinking oyle, ſcraping away that Baals marke and that Apiſh patch ſo well as it will be, and ſo departing. But ſuch as haue not iudgement of death, are degraded onely verbaliter (as they term it) that is to ſay, by word. Which is in effect a ſuſpending from all function &amp; preferment, during the Popes pleaſure.
               Another ceremony they haue, that in no caſe is to be omitted, wherin the holy Houſe moſt ſhamefully and without any kind of colour in the world, mocketh both God &amp; man, and all the whole company preſent, giuing all men good cauſe iuſtly to laugh at their folly: &amp; that is this. In the end of their ſentence pronounced vpon ſuch as haue iudgement to be burned (their conuerſion to the church of Rome notwithſtanding) they adde moreouer &amp; cauſe there openly to be proclaimed, that foraſmuch as the holy Houſe miſtruſteth that the party is not truly conuerted nor from his heart, but counterfaiteth, and doe feare therefore, leſt a wolfe lurke ſtill vnder a ſheepes clothing, for all his ſemblance of conuerſion, they do giue &amp; bequeath him to the ſecular power, with this humble requeſt vnto them, to ſhew the partie ſo much fauour as may be, and to breake neither bone, nor pearce any skin of his body. But ſuch as

nothing was able to remoue from their godly profeſſion, whom they tearme Wilfull and Obſtinate perſons, they commend to the ſame power, with theſe words. Foraſmuch as we haue laboured earneſtly, and taken great paines with this man, to bring him home to our mother-church of Rome, and can doe no good on him, but that ſtill hee continueth obſtinatly in his opinions, &amp;c. we therfore deliuer this fellow to the ſecular power, to doe execution on him according to order of law: yet praying them by the way, that if he ſhew any tokens of true repentance, to deal as fauourably with him as they may, with other ſuch like ſpeech. And what impudencie (I pray you) is this? They haue already giuen ſentence vpon him that hee muſt dye, and therupon deliuer him to the ſecular power to be burnt, in ſo much, that if they that ſhould ſee execution done, do eyther ſuffer the partie to make an eſcape, or elſe keepe him and not burne him, they themſelues ſhould bee aſſigned to ſupply his place: and yet they require thus much at their hands, to vſe as much mercie towards him as they may. But what kinde of pittie or mercie is it I pray you, that they ſhew vnto them themſelues, which bring the poore ſoule foorth into that place diſmembred and ſhaken all into peeces in euerie lim
                     〈…〉
                  e and iointe of their bodies, with neuer a whole bone in their skinne, yea, the verie ſinewes, veines, and guts, within them broken with their moſt cruell tortures, wherewith diuers haue periſhed preſently, euen betwixt their hands? and yet will they ſue to the ſecular power, to breake neyther arme nor legge, nor anie other member, nor to draw one droppe of bloud on them. Forſooth it is becauſe the harme that they haue done to the poore wretches alreadie, is wholly within the fleſh; and becauſe they haue drawen no bloud of them, eyther with knife or launce, but onely at his mouth with a fine Lawne let down his throat, they forſooth are free from bloudſhed and breaking of bones. They themſelues haue entreated

him tootoo pitifully, &amp; without all mercy or good humanity, with exquiſite deuices &amp; ſuch kind of cruelty as was aboue meaſure &amp; more than barbarous, and fall they now to entreat the temporall Iudges to ſhew him as much mercy a
                     •
                   may be? Perhaps theſe flouting merchants ſuppoſe that by this onely ſhift of deſcant, in praying mercie for them, they haue cleanly auoided their Canon, which holdeth them accurſed and excommunicate, whoſoeuer being of the clergy ſhall ſhed any bloud, or giue any maime: for they can wipe away ſuch a fooliſh penalty, in compariſon of ſo great an offence, with as fooliſh and ridiculous a ſhift. And theſe moſt impudent toyes of mockery, both the Princes and the whole people, but chiefly the temporall magiſtrate heareth and ſuffereth, without ſaying any thing thereto: otherwiſe there is no man ſo void of all vnderſtanding, but he may eaſily perceiue, that their praying of mercy and crauing of fauour for them, is but a very ieſt, imagined, to flout all the whole companie withall, and ſpoken then, when they mean it leaſt. Loe, here is the pittie and tender compaſſion, and mother-like mercie of their holy mother-Church, which this holy Houſe ſheweth. This alſo may the reader ſee and marke by the way, were he neuer ſo blinde, that this ſhift of theirs to ſend ſuch to the fire of whoſe conuerſion they ſtand halfe in doubt, that is to ſay, leſt they leaue a wolfe in a lambe
                     •
                   skin, is yet one of the cunningeſt trickes, that the holy Houſe hath in all her bouget.
               I told you before, that the chiefeſt part of the Act conſiſted in the reading and pronouncing of the ſentences, and therfore moſt worthie the marking: foraſmuch, as they do not onely by ſingular falſhood, miſ-report ſuch things as the party vpon examination hath confeſſed, but alſo father thoſe things vpon him moſt diuelliſhly, which hee neyther ſpake nor thought in all his lifetime. And theſe hath the holy Houſe deuiſed againſt the partie, whereof part is moſt filthy, part ſhamefull and abominable, and part blaſphemous,

to the intent to diſgrace his perſon, &amp; to make both him and his doctrin the more abhorred of men, and encreaſe their owne eſtimation and credit, as moſt neceſſarie members to ſcoure and ridde the world of ſuch peſtiferous perſons, Whiles all this geare is in rehearſing to the people. they clappe vpon the parties tongue a cleft peece of wood, in maner as it were a barnacle, to his great and intolerable paine, ſo that hee can anſwer ne gain-ſay, nothing in defence of himſelfe and his owne innocencie. For if hee might be ſuffered and let alone, he would openly giue them the lye to their faces: as it hath hapned diuers times. Howbeit the controuerſie were not like long to continue. For ſtraightway the fellow ſhould bee ſure to haue his mouth gagged, or his tongue ſtocked, to teach him to be quiet, &amp; to ſay nothing openly. Moreouer, that which is the parties confeſſion in very deede, is ſo peruerted and corrupted, with the words ſo changed, &amp; rechanged in reading, that in a maner it may be very well ſaid for him, that hee neuer ſpake nor thought any ſuch thing. Wherof I will here ſhew ſome ſpeciall examples, becauſe they be matters of weight, and ſuch as cannot eaſily bee contraried, foraſmuch as the whole world ſeeth and knoweth them well enough.
               After that all the ſentences bee read, and the act uall degradation wholly finiſhed, the temporall magiſtrate taketh them into his hands very ſolemnely, according as it is enioyned him by the holy Houſe, and ſo conueyeth them to the place of execution, with a ſort of the diuels owne Proctors about them, calling &amp; crying vpon them with great importunity to forſake the truth which they haue receiued and profeſſed. And many times it chanceth, that ſuch as conſtantly perſeuer in confeſſing the truth to the end, doe breake their neckes againſt the ſtake with a trice, and then they noiſe abroad among the cōmon people, that ſuch, &amp; ſuch repentantly recanted their hereſies at their verie laſt howre, and came home again to the Church of Rome, and

therefore felt no force of fire at all, by reaſon of the Inquiſitours mercie and pittie extended vpon ſuch as became conuerted. By theſe, and ſuch like ſubtill practices, they goe about to bury the truth, as though God the auenger thereof were not able to raiſe it vp againe out of darkneſſe and dungeons. The reſidue, which be not condemned to dye, are caried backe to priſon againe: and the next day after, are brought out &amp; whipt, ſuch as had like ſentence pronounced vpon them: whereof diuers are afterward ſent to the gally, others remanded to perpetuall priſon, either to Triana the ſpeciall priſon for the Inquiſition, or to ſome place elſwhere altogether as euill as a priſon, with this Item to them ere they goe: that if they happen hereafter to call anything to minde, that erſt they haue not diſcloſed, they immediately reſort to the holy Houſe, and declare it whatſoeuer it be: for if it be found otherwiſe, that they haue craftily and cloſely concealed any thing, they ſhall be reputed (ſay they) as perſons without remorce of conſcience, and like-to be ſharply and ſeuerely puniſhed therefore. But the chiefeſt matter that they giue them in charge is, in no caſe to reueale any thing that they haue either heard or ſeene during the time of their impriſonment, concerning the maner of their entreating in any reſpect, either of puniſhment, or impriſonment, or otherwiſe, how and after what ſort they haue generally proceeded in Court againſt them, and their fellow priſoners; but for the time of their being there, ſhould take and repute themſelues altogether as dead perſons. For if the contrary can be proued by them, or that it come to the Inquiſitours eares that they haue vttered any of their ſecrets, they ſhall be taken for perſons Relapſed (a
                     •
                   they terme them) and be puniſhed with moſt ſeueritie. And the iudgement appointed for ſuch, is death without redemption, which ſurely is a deuiſe aboue al the reſt, and might worſe be ſpared. For by this their ſo ſtrait enioyning them ſilence vpon paine of their liues, they cope them (as it were) with needle &amp; threed, and ſo keepe in all

their knauery and tyranny as ſure as vnder locke and key, both cloſe and ſecret to themſelues. They know full well, I wis, that if the king who authoriſed them, ſhould by any meanes vnderſtand their falſe play which they vſe, the violence and iniurie that they offer, the ſlanderous reports which they make the wonderfull fetches, and diuelliſh deuices which they practiſe to entrappe diuers and ſundrie poore innocents, charging them with manie matters, which neyther they ſaid, nor ſaw, nor heard at anie time, but ſpecially if hee vnderſtood of their couetous and cruell dealings, &amp; (as I may ſay) more than barbarous, growing of that greedie deſire of theirs: he would (no doubt of it) turne the Inquiſition on their owne neckes, and foreſee the ſafetie aſwell of his owne ſubiects, as the common-weale of the countrey, and prouide for it accordingly: but chiefly hee would ſee to the execution of Iuſtice, whereof he is appointed by God a lawfull Protectour, rather than the enriching of his bagges and coffers, won by ſuch vnlawfull meanes. Or elſe, if the King ſ
                     •
                  acked herein to doe that appertaines to him, the cōmon people would be readie to fire them, that haue been ſo fierce with fire to others. Furthermore, they labour ſo earneſtly to burie the truth, and are ſo carefull leſt their crueltie ſhould come to light, that among other great penalies which they enioine to diuers men of worſhip and good reputation, and ſome of honour and in authoritie, after they haue kept them in priſon a ſeaſon, and cauſed them to ſuſtaine open infamie, they inhibite them the company and conference of any, other than ſuch as they ſhal appoint &amp; allow them: neither will ſuffer them to write to any friend of theirs without making them priuie vnto it, that they might haue the peruſing thereof. Their colour for this matter (forſooth) is very prettie, leſt that by conference or writing of letters, they ſhould publiſh their hereticall opinions. But in verie deede their drift is, leſt ſuch men as haue good friends and bee well allied, ſhould complaine and make their

mone to their friends &amp; allies, of the iniuries that haue bin done vnto them, and they make means to the King to enquire further of their doings, &amp; ſo bring the practices of the holy Houſe to light. Wherof this is proof ſufficiēt, that they vſe not this kind of puniſhment to any of the meaner ſort, but only to them that be of good bloud &amp; parentage.
               For at the very firſt beginning, when the maner of their Triumph firſt came vp, and was executed vpon the Lutheranes (as they call them) they that were preſent at the ſight, and beheld the order and faſhion well, were wont to write vnto their friends both within the Realme and abroad, of all ſuch things as there were done and ſeene, eſpecially of ſuch as did penance: alſo what ſentences were pronounced vpon them, with the cauſes and circumſtances of all their other puniſhmentes and penalties. But the holy Houſe (as dayly practice maketh euerie one his crafts-maiſter) grew ſo cunning in their affaires, that ſtraight-way they beganne to ſmell out the matter, that it might in time worke them ſome diſpleaſure, and therewithall that the doctrin which they ſo greatly deteſt and abhorre, might bee publiſhed and ſpreade further than they would wiſh it, ſo that manie which otherwiſe would haue continued in their blindneſſe ſtill, if they had neuer heard nor ſeene anie ſuch reportes, ſhould bee occaſioned thereby, to open their eyes and vnderſtandings, and to confeſſe aſwell the doctrine it ſelfe, and receiue it, as alſo eſpie the wickedneſſe of them that perſecute it. Therefore for remedie of this miſchiefe and inconuenience, the holy Houſe prouided, by making and publiſhing certaine preſidentes of ſuch like reportes, briefe, and in ſuch wiſe as were not likely to doe anie great harme: that who ſo were diſpoſed to certifie their friends of ſuch matters, ſhould follow thoſe preſidentes in any caſe: &amp; therfore appointed certaine great penalties for the tranſgreſſours hereof, that ſhould make their reportes in any other more large or ample maner, than was by their order preſcribed. The maner

wherof was this: That after they had told who &amp; what The Preſidents for letters appointed by the holy Houſe. maner of man he was that was puniſhed or executed, they ſhould adde moreouer, becauſe he held with Luther, without naming any of his opinions, (which notwithſtanding were ſpecially recited before) was burned, or thus, or thus puniſhed or executed, according to the truth of the matter.
               Moreouer, as the holy Houſe well may erre (albeit men now adayes are ſo bewitched with ſuperſtition and flatterie, that they dare affirme the contrarie, being ordered, and guided (ſay they) by the holy Ghoſt) ſo it commeth diuers times to paſſe, that ſome be cauſeleſſe apprehended, ſome vpon verie ſmall and light complaints, verie few vpon anie lawfull and ſufficient information. And the greateſt part, after they haue beene impriſoned in ſuch miſerable ſort as I haue before declared, for a yeare, or two, or more, till their cauſes were thorowly examined, at the laſt being tryed and found guiltleſſe, ſo that neceſſarily they are to be diſcharged, within a day or two after their great day of Triumph, they bring them into the Court, &amp; there beginne to ſet on them againe as freſhly as euer they did, willing them to vtter the truth, as they will auoid their diſpleaſures and the extremitie of law, threatning them the Rack, and ſaying that there is now come in ſufficient matter by information againſt them. Then if any will be feared with this facing, and be brought but to vtter one word of any ſuch matters as they are deſirous to heare of, they ſend him ſtraight to ward againe, and renue their ſute againſt him from the beginning. But if nothing can bee gotte out of him by this meanes, nor that they haue anie thing elſe to charge him withall, they leaue off threatning, and fall to flattering: ſaying, that they haue a better opinion of him than ſo, and therefore are reſolued to ſend him home again to his owne houſe: for the which fatherly fauour extended towards him in ſauing both his life and his goods, hee is to account himſelfe much beholding and bound to their Lordſhips, willing him to perſwade

himſelf, that what fauour they haue ſhewed him alreadie, they mean to continue towards him, for the good liking that they had of him at the very firſt view, but ſpecially for the good example of patience which he ſhewed during the whole time of his impriſonment. With theſe and ſuch like Lenitiues the good and vpright Iudges think to ſupple the reſt of his ſores that were of their owne making, &amp; to ſend him home to his houſe at the laſt, with ſpeciall charge that he be ſilent. Yet ſometime they detaine him in priſon a good while after, notwithſtanding that hee bee found not guiltie, nothing regarding what any, be he neuer ſo guiltleſſe, ſuffer at their hands, and there doe keepe him cloſely &amp; craſtily till a day or two after their great ſtate and iollity, that being diſmiſſed neer about the time that the other are, the common people may think he receiued his puniſhment amongſt the reſt, tho in ſome leſſer degree, and thereby be perſwaded that the holy Houſe neuer vexeth any man without ſufficient information. And marke I pray you one other new found guiſe that theſe rauening wolues haue got to obtain their prey &amp; ſpoile withall: that ſuch perſons as among other parcels of their puniſhments are condemned either to perpetuall impriſonment, either during the Inquiſitors pleaſure, or for a certaine ſeaſon, albeit they remaine no longer in Triana, that is, the Inquiſitours proper and peculiar priſon, becauſe they ſhall think themſelues quite and clear diſpatched, and to haue no more to doe with the holy Houſe: yet wherſoeuer they be appointed their place of aboad as an impriſonment, there be ſpies alſo to mark diligently how they take the matter, and whether they put it vp quietly, yea or no, or what they ſay vnto it. For if they bee chearefull, or doe any wayes make but a countenance of mirth in this time of their trouble, they ſhall both incurre the Inquiſitours diſpleaſure therfore, and feel a greater ſmart beſides. They alſo that doe remaine in ſuch appointed places, are likewiſe viſited ſometime by the Inquiſitours; but in ſuch ſort as hath bin deſcribed of the

other, and to the very ſame end and purpoſe, that is to ſay, that the common people might ſee how full of mercie and pittie they are: howbeit it is to this end, to bring them more in feare and awe of them, &amp; of their diſpleaſure. For then beginne they (as it were) to keep Court, and to make inquirie both of the priſoners themſelues &amp; of the keepers; whether ſince their departure out of Triana they haue heard any of their fellowes ſay any thing touching matters of religion, who it was that did ſo, and what countenance others that heard it, made thereunto. Alſo, whether any man doe grudge or find himſelfe grieued for any puniſhment that he hath endured, but eſpecially, whether they haue diſcloſed any myſterie or ſecret of theirs, or whether any man haue compaſſed or imagined to make an eſcape, with many other ſuch like queſtions. And if they finde no ſuch matters, they return as wiſe as they came, If otherwiſe there appeare any euident matter againſt them, then commence they their ſute againſt him or them. Not many yeares agoe, it chanced at Siuill in ſuch a like viſitation, that a certaine priſoner, after hee had remained in priſon for certaine yeares at the chiefe Inquiſitours pleaſure, whoſe name was Licentiato Gaſco, made verie earneſt ſuite vnto him for his diſcharge and deliuerance thence. This Gaſco was a man well learned in both the lawes, as it ſeemed: who ſtrayning himſelfe to ſpeake ſomewhat wiſely, made this graue and goodly anſwer vnto him, paſſing all wiſedome or good religion. Now Sirs (ſaith hee) you muſt My Lord the chiefe Inquiſitors occaſion. take your affliction patiently, for here you ſuffer for the ſinnes of the people, and for ours aſwell as for your owne. Howbeit I will moue the reſt of my Lords in the matter, and what may be done, ſhall be done. But vpon theſe and ſuch like fooliſh and blaſphemous ſpeeches, neuer anie Commiſſioner made inquirie: and thus departed hee out of the Parler, wherein he had made ſuch a clerke-like peece of worke to the poore priſoners in way of conſolation; and ſo like a gay-diuine, caſting a word out to the

keeper verie ſolemnly, and charging him by vertue of their Office to look to them narrowly, that none eſcaped. For if there did, he ſhould both ſeek them at his owne charge, and be puniſhed beſides for his negligence, in looking ſo ſlenderly to his duetie.
            
            
               CHAP. XIII.
               
                  The interpretation of the ſentences.
                  
               
               THere be alſo certaine ſpeciall termes which the holy Houſe vſeth for euerie kinde of penance ſeuerally. Wherein, ſeeing there lyeth alſo ſorne ſecret myſterie, it ſhall not bee greatly impertinent to declare them in this place, expounding them after the Inquiſitours owne ſenſe and vnderſtanding. Firſt, concerning the iudgements, ſome are to bee burned quicke, and that is for ſuch as haue conſtantly perſeuered vnto the end, in the confeſſion of a pure and perfect faith: and theſe men they call obstinate. Others are to bee burned alſo, but after they be dead, being firſt ſtrangled at the ſtake. Such are they, that being once wonne by their owne frailtie and weakneſſe, haue beene content to ſubmitte themſelues to the Inquiſitours, and to footh wahtſoeuer the other will ſay, &amp; yet haue by certaine euident and ſufficient tokens, giuen the Inquiſitours good cauſe of ſuſpicion, to thinke that they remaine the ſame in heart ſtill, notwithſtanding their mouth hath confeſſed the contrarie. After the ſame maner are diuers alſo of the former ſort, whom they tearme obstinate, ſtrangled ere the fire bee kindled, to make the people beleeue, that ſo ſoone as they were ſette to the ſtake, they abiured and renouced all their hereſies, and returned to the holy mother-Church of Rome. But of theſe I haue made mention before. Another ſort of ſentences there are that haue a ſhew of more mercie, which they call reconciliations, becauſe ſuch as haue renounced the truth are as it were purged and clenſed by doing that penance in way of ſatisfaction, and therby receiued againe into the very boſom of the Romiſh Church. Such for the moſt part cary

in their hands tapers vnlighted on the great day of their Triumph, with ropes about their neckes, and Sambenites vpon their backes aboue their other garments, as badges &amp; tokens of guilt: &amp; theſe they wear either during life, or for ſome other certaine number of yeares, or elſe are cloſe kept and ſhut vp in ſome monaſterie, or ſome other priuate places, whereof as there be ſundry ſortes, ſo are there likewiſe ſeuerall names. Some are Perpetuall without redemption. Some onely perpetuall. Some for a certaine ſeaſon: the which beeng expired, they muſt notwithſtanding remaine there ſtill, during the Inquiſitours pleaſures: and ſome be no longer limited at the firſt than during the pleaſure of the chiefe Inquiſitour, the Generall they call him, becauſe he is chiefe Iudge aboue all other Courts of the holy Inquiſition throughout the Realme of Spaine: there be alſo ſome at the pleaſure of the inferiour Iudges that gaue the ſentence, in their owne Courts and priuate iuriſdictions. Theſe diuerſities of priſons are like the properties of Purgatorie for all the world, excepting aſwell certaine caſes in matter of penance, as alſo degrees of affinitie and bloud in caſes of mariage. For they are deuiſed to glean all the mony out of the poor Penitentiaries purſes, more or leſſe, according to the quality of the offence, and after the rate and proportion of the penalty aſſeſſed on each of them therefore. And all this (forſooth) muſt bee vnderſtood to proceede from the Inquiſitours owneclemencie and mercie, of their own meer good will: by the only meanes whereof, the party that otherwiſe muſt neceſſarely periſh for abiuring the truth, may ſtand in ſtate of grace againe, and be in poſſibilitie to recouer his owne ſaluation.
               When iudgement is giuen to weare the Habite, (for ſo they call the Sambenite by a more cleanly terme) &amp; to perpetuall priſon without bayle or mainepriſe, it is to be vnderſtood, that there is no talk to be had of any remiſſion thereof till the party hath worn that garment, &amp; ſuffered

impriſonment, the ſpace of nine or ten whole yeares, except the partie haue ſo good hap, as by meanes of his friends to obtaine his pardon at the Kings hand, who onely may by his prerogatiue pardon it at his pleaſure. But after the expiration of thoſe yeares, vnleſſe the party haue giuen ſome cauſe of ſuſpicion againe, the chiefe Inquiſitour is commonly wont to remitte the reſidue, howbeit with great crouching firſt, and much entreatie.
               When they adiudge a man to weare the Sambenite, and to ſuffer perpetuall impriſonment, without adding anie more, it is commonly taken for 3. yeares. if the chiefe Inquiſitor doe ſo think good: vpon whoſe pleaſure it reſteth either to giue the priſoner his diſcharge after thoſe 3 years; or elſe to his perpetuall ignominie, there to detaine him all his life long. But when they ſay, that a man ſhall wear the Habite, and ſuffer impriſonment ſo many yeares or moneths, ſo ſoon as that certaine time is expired the partie is ſet at libertie, except it be added moreouer, beſides the limitation of time certaine, that it ſhal be further referred to the diſcretion and appointment of the Inquiſitours. The which clauſe they comonly vſe to put in the latter end, in the winding vp of all, to choake men therewith, to make them thinke themſelues much bound to them while they liue, for releaſing the ſame. But if the ſentence be to weare the Sambenite with impriſonment during the chiefe Inquiſitours pleaſure, it is left to their diſcretions to pardon or puniſh accordingly, as they ſhall think good. In ſumme, how or after what ſort ſoeuer their ſentence be, the matter is wholly referred to them and to their ordering.
               Now the meanes to redeeme this impriſonment, and to diſpenſe with the wearing of theſe robes, is the more common and ordinarie, by reaſon that the King hath in his Court diuers young gentlemen, to whom in reſpect of their ſeruice, he vſeth to grant pardons for thoſe matters. Then ſuch as get the grant hereof, doe commonly make inquirie for ſuch perſons as are therunto adiudged, who they

be, and where they remaine, to the intent to make their market of thoſe pardons to their moſt aduantage, as they can agree of price eyther more or leſſe, reſpecting alwaies, both the abilitie of the perſon, and the qualitie of the ſentence. For ſuch as had iudgement without redemption, pay more: other for releaſe of perpetuall impriſonment, leſſe: other for certaine time and during the Inquiſitours pleaſure, leſſe againe: and leaſt of all, that which onely reſteth vpon the diſcretion and will of the Iudge. Alſo, at ſome times the King, of his like liberality &amp; gracious goodneſſe, vſeth to grant vnto diuerſe, ſuch money as ſhould bee leuied for pardon of the Sambenite and other puniſhment, towards the redeeming of their brethren and allies, being taken priſoners by the Turkes or Moores. And yet, whoſoeuer ſueth vnto the King for anie ſuch pardon, muſt firſt in any caſe make the Inquiſitours and the Clerks or other Officers of that Court his friends: otherwiſe, both the Kings owne charter, and the payment made by the partie beſides notwithſtanding, they will auoide him by hooke or by crooke, and tell him plainly, be it the King or the Pope himſelfe that granted the pardon, he muſt bee better enformed how the caſe ſtandeth ere he may depart ſo lightly. Then, if the matter be brought to that paſſe, it is an eaſie thing for them to imagine, that the partie is not ſo cleared, but that there was good cauſe a while to make a ſtay.
               But when anie hath iudgement of Impriſonment during the chiefe Inquiſitours pleaſure, who for certaine ſecret occaſions to him knowne will not bee entreated, and yet cannot well with honeſtie repulſe the ſuters, albeit hee doe them manifeſt iniurie to detaine them ſo long, hee will conuey the matter full cunningly, ſaying, that he is content to referre it to the Inquiſitours by whom the iudgement was giuen. And when the partie reſorteth to them, then ſtraight-way is he poſted ouer from them backe againe to the high

Inquiſitor, alledging that the determination hereof belongeth vnto him, and ſo by meanes that one of them vnderſtandeth the others meaning, they dally and prolong the poor mans impriſonment, driuing him off from day to day, ſo long as it pleaſeth them. In like maner, the puniſhment is limited by the inferiour Inquiſitours. For when they are loth to be entreated, they paſs it to the high Inquiſitor, and ſo one of them ſerueth another: and therefore except the partie goe cunningly to worke, and bribe eyther the Clerke or ſome other Officer of the holy Houſe &amp; that with no ſmall gubbe, and there begin the ground of his ſute, all his labour and coſt beſtowed vpon the redeeming of his impriſonment, is quite loſt. But if any of the Inquiſitors or any chiefe Officer of the Court doe make interceſſion for the partie, then ſtraight-way the other vnderſtand, that it is done vpon ſome ſuch ſpeciall occaſions as they know, whereupon the ſuter is moued to pittie the ſtate of the poor priſoner, ſpecially if he vſe the ordinary words known and vſed among themſelues in caſes of petition. Which is on this ſort. My very good Lordes, my humble ſute to your good Lordſhips is, that ſuch a priſoners cauſe may bee fauourably conſidered, of whoſe good life and conuerſation, but ſpecially of his patience in the time of his impriſonment, I haue beene ſufficiently and ſubſtantially enformed. Here are intermedled two or three good words in his commendation, but moderately, leſt it ſhould be thought that hee were too carefull ouer him: The concluſion then is, that it would pleaſe their Lordſhips to determine, whether the partie ſhall bee releaſed yea or no. And of ſuch as eſcape thus hardly through the bryars, it coſteth ſome the one halfe of their goods: ſome all: and ſome a peece, as it pleaſeth the Inquiſitours to deale with them. For they are perſwaded this to be the nigheſt way to bring them home again, that are any thing gone aſtray or become aliens from the faith. Or perhaps the holy Houſe thinketh it to be againſt Gods Lawes, that an

hereticke ſhould haue whereupon to liue. Or elſe belike, they haue found out an Aphoriſme for their purpoſe: that as a ſurfetter muſt vſe a temperate and a thin diet: ſo muſt an heretick alſo be kept low, leſt he ſwell and grow vp therein; and therefore take it for a ſoueraigne medicine, to keepe him ſo hungrie that he muſt be faine to begge his bread.
               Moreouer, of theſe (as is aboueſaid) ſome haue iudgement, beſides the wearing of the habite and ſuffring impriſonment, to be alſo whipped. Some both to be whipped, &amp; afterward ſet to the Gally. But theſe ſharper kinds of puniſhments they commonly vſe to ſtrangers, be they neuer ſo ſmall offenders, to bee euen with them this way, becauſe they make ſo light of wearing the Sambenite, for moſt of them make but a ieſt of it. And all theſe proceed from the Inquiſitours owne mercie.
               The laſt and leaſt penaltie is appointed for ſuch as in their iudgements haue committed but a light offence: that is, to bee brought vpon the ſcaffold bare-headed and without anie cloake, hauing in his hand a waxe taper: whereof ſome are commanded to make Abiuration ex vehementi: Some ex levi▪
                   Abiuration de vehementi they call, when it appeared not in the hearing and debating of anie mans cauſe, what is certainely to bee determined, for want of ſufficient proofe, and becauſe the partie himſelfe confeſſed nothing that deſerued anie maner of puniſhment. Therefore vpon ſuch a fellow, whom they may neyther by iuſtice condemne for an hereticke, nor of their conſciences can abſolue and ſet at libertie, ſpecially hauing ſome apparant tokens of ſcarce good beliefe, they giue ſentence vpon him as vpon one vehemently ſuſpected: and ſo according to their ſuſpicion, they cauſe him to abiure, And ſuch a man being afterward found guilty, be it in the leaſt tittle of papiſtrie, they take for a relapſe, and condemne to the fire. Abiuration de levi, is much after the ſame maner, but that it is enioined vpon ſmaller

offences in their iudgements, whether the matter hath been apparant or no. Howbeit, no ſuch perſon, though he be taken with the ſame maner againe, ſhall be reputed for a relapſe, or haue iudgement of death therefore: albeit the qualifying of the ſecond offence, that is to ſay, the iudgement and eſtimation thereof, bee referred to the Inquiſitours. And this kinde of abiuration is for the moſt part vſed in other matters, then concerning Luthers doctrine, as for example, fornication (forſooth) betwixt ſingle perſons, as though it were no ſin: therefore it is accuſtomably puniſhed but as a trifling toy, by carrying of a waxe candle, and by abiuration deleui. Yet at ſome times they puniſh this ſin with the whip, and that verie extreamly, but if the party offend a thouſand times after, ſo that he put himſelfe vpon the Inquiſitours mercie, he is ſure neuer to dye therefore.
               Loe, theſe be the goodly means wherby theſe good fathers bring into the right way the weaklings, as Paul tearmeth them. And thus much concerning their deuices practiſed in the Inquiſition, till the time come that we may ſee the fall of that arke of Iniquitie, with the hidden ſecrets and myſteries thereof further diſcloſed, and all thoſe things fulfilled and accompliſhed, which in time (no doubt) muſt be reuealed and come to paſſe vpon this holy Inquiſition, theſe good Fathers, and their holy Houſe, finally vpon the whole man of ſin, which God threatneth by his Prophet, ſhall fall vpon all ſuch wicked hypocrites, which to the ouerthrowing of Chriſt's kingdome, and the vtter defacing of his glory, like ſhameleſſe men, moſt wickedly do pretend the defence, and zeale, and the earneſt aduancement of the ſame. Malach. 2. And now to you this precept (ſaith hee) O ye Prieſts. If ye will not giue eare, nor purpoſe in your heart to giue all glorie to my name (ſaith the Lord of hostes) I will curſe you, yea I will curſe your bleſsings, nay I haue curſed them alreadie, becauſe you doe not conſider it in your heart. Behold I will deſtroy your ſeede, and will ouerſpread your owne faces with the

filth of your ſolemnities, and it ſhall cleaue faſt vpon you, and you ſhall know that this commandement toucheth you onely. Repentye.
            
            
               CHAP. XIIII.
               
                  Certaine ſpeciall examples, wherein a man may more plainely ſee the treacheries and legerdemaines of the holy Inquiſition in very practice and exerciſe.
               
               HEre I haue thought good to annexe certaine ſpeciall examples of their practices; wherein a man may euidently ſee a great ſort of their treacheries heaped and ſhuffled together, ouer and aboue ſuch as I haue heretofore made relation of in their ſpeciall places, to the end that their crueltie in the execution hereof, with their vnſatiable couetouſneſſe, and all other abominable iniquitie in the peruerting of all good lawes, may bee liuely deſcribed and (as it were) painted in tables, and ſet foorth to the ſhew, that ſuch as doe behold them may take the full view thereof. And partly I doe it for their ſakes, who for the profeſſing of the Goſpel, and the abiuring of an abominable religion, haue bin ouertaken by the ſame meanes, ſeruing theſe holy Fathers in ſtead of a booty to prey and rauen vpon, becauſe I think it expedient for the Church to continue ſome memorie therof. Now therfore, let all Chriſtendome open their eyes, that they may know &amp; diſcerne theſe rauenous Wolues, Lions, &amp; Dragons, the very generation of Vipers, whom (notwithſtanding their tyrannie) they haue till this day had in great reputation, and honored as gods, to the great decay and vndoing of all Chriſtian common-weales: that learning to know them, and ſtripping them out off their clokes of piety &amp; godlineſſe, wherof they haue gotten ſpeciall commendation, they may baniſh them all Chriſtendome ouer. But as for any examples whereof I mean preſently to make rehearſall, they are taken out of one onely Court of the Inquiſition holden at Siuill, whoſe ſecrets alone the reporters hereof were able

to diſcloſe, hauing had the moſt part of them practiſed vpon themſelues, By relation whereof, a man may haue a pretty geſs, what a number there would be if a man ſhould likewiſe courſe ouer all the other Courts of Inquiſition throughout the whole realme of Spaine. Neither are theſe that hereafter enſue, or the other reported before in my whole treatiſe, of any long collection: but all within the compaſſe of 6. or 7. yeares next after they began to perſecute the Lutherans that grew vp in Spaine in great multitudes vpon a ſuddaine, eſpecially in Siuill and Valladolit.
               
               About wch time there was apprehended for religion, and brought before the Inquiſitors of Siuill, a certaine Engliſhman whoſe name was Nicholas Burton, a very godly man, whom afterward they burned for that he continued conſtant in his profeſſion &amp; belief, deteſting vtterly all their wicked &amp; abominable religion vntill his liues end. Immediately after his arreſt, all the goods and Marchandiſe which he brought with him into Spain by way of traffick, were according to their common vſage ſeaſed and taken into the Sequeſter: among the which they alſo rolled vp much that appertained to another Engliſh Marchant, wherewith hee was credited as Factour. Whereof ſo ſoone as newes was brought to London, aſwell of the impriſonment of his Factour, as of the Arreſt made vpon his goods, hee ſent his Atturney into Spaine with authoritie from him to make claime to his goods, and demand them. When his Atturney was landed at Siuill, and had ſhewed all his letters and writings to the holy Houſe, requiring them, that ſuch goods might bee deliuered into his poſſeſſion, anſwer was made him, that hee muſt ſue by bill, and retaine an Aduocate (but all was doubtleſſe to delay him) and they, forſooth, of curteſie aſſigned him one to frame his ſupplication for him, and other ſuch billes of petition as hee had to exhibite into their holy Court, demanding for each bill eight rialls, albeit they ſtood him in no more ſtead than if hee had put vp

none at all. And for the ſpace of three or four moneths this fellow miſſed not twice a day, attending euery morning and afternoon at the Inquiſitors Palace, ſuing vnto them vpon his knees for his diſpatch, but ſpecially to the Biſhop of Tarracon of whom I made mention before, who was at that very 
                     ••
                  me chief in the Inquiſition at Siuill, that he of his abſolute authoritie would command reſtitution to be made therof: but the booty was ſo good &amp; ſo great, that it was the harder to come by it againe. At the length, after he had ſpe
                     •
                  t whole four moneths in ſutes &amp; requeſts, &amp; all to no purpoſe, he receiued this anſwer frō them, that he muſt ſhew better euidence, &amp; bring more ſufficient certificates out of England for proofe of his matter, than thoſe which he hath already preſented to the Court. Wherupon the party forthwith poſted to London, and with all ſpeed returned to Siuill againe with more ample and large letters teſtimonialls and certificates, according to their requeſt, and exhibited them to the Court. Notwithſtanding, the Inquiſitors ſtil ſhifted him off, excuſing themſelues by lack of leiſure, &amp; by occupation in greater &amp; more weighty affaires, and with ſuch anſwers delayed him whole other 4. moneths after. At the laſt, when the party had welnigh ſpent all his money, and therefore ſued the more earneſtly for his diſpatch, they referred the matter wholly to the Biſhop. Of whom, when hee repaired vnto him, hee had this anſwer: that for himſelfe hee knew what hee had to doe: howbeit hee was but one man, and the determination of the matter appertained vnto the other commiſſioners aſwell as vnto him: and by thus poſting &amp; paſſing it from one to another, the partie could obtain no end of his ſute. Yet for his importunitie ſake, they were reſolued to diſpatch him, but it was on this ſort: One of the Inquiſitours called Licentiato Gaſco, a man verie well experienced in theſe practices, willed the party to reſort vnto him after dinner. The fellow being glad to hear this newes▪ and ſuppoſing that his goods ſhould be reſtored vnto him,

and that he was called in for that purpoſe to talk with the other that were in priſon, to confer with him about their accounts, the rather through a little miſunderſtanding, hearing the Inquiſitor caſt out a word, that it ſhould be needfull for him to talk with the priſoner; and being thereupon more than halfe perſwaded, that at the length they meant good faith, did ſo, and repaired thither about the euening. Immediately vpon his comming, the Iayler was forthwith charged with him, to ſhut him vp cloſe in ſuch a certain priſō, where they appointed him. The party hoping at the firſt that he had bin called for about ſome other matter, and ſeeing himſelfe contrary to his expectation, caſt into a dark dungeon, perceiued at the length that the world went with him far otherwiſe then hee ſuppoſed it would haue done. But within two or three dayes after, he was brought forth into the Court, where hee began to demand his goods: and becauſe it was a deuice that well ſerued their turne, without any more circumſtance they bid him ſay his Aue Maria. The party began, and ſaid it ſimply and plainely on this ſort, after the Engliſh faſhion: Aue Maria gratia plena dominiu tecum, benedictatu in mulieribus, &amp; benedictus fructus ventris tui Ieſus. Amen. The ſame was written word by word as hee ſpake it: and without anie more talke of claiming his goods, becauſe it was booteleſſe, they command him to priſon againe, and enter an action againſt him as an hereticke, foraſmuch as hee did not ſay his Aue Maria after the Romiſh faſhion, but ended it very ſuſpiciouſly; for hee ſhould haue added moreouer Sancta Maria mater dei ora pro nobis peccatoribus: by curtalling whereof, it was euident enough (ſay they) that hee did not allow the mediation of Saints. Thus they picked a quarrell to detaine him in priſon a longer ſeaſon, and afterwards brought him forth into their Stage diſguiſed after their maner: where ſentence was giuen, that hee ſhould loſe all the goods which he ſued for, though they were not his owne, &amp; beſides this

ſuffer a yeares impriſonment. His name was Iohn Framton a citizen of Briſtow.
               
               In the confiſcation of goods, it is neither any great noueltie, nor a thing ſo rarely ſeene in this holy Houſe, that ſtrangers goods ſhould bee alſo ſeiſed among other mens. Otherwiſe (ſay they) it might eaſily bee wrought, if they ſhould giue eare or credit to ſuch allegations, that manie by meanes thereof might colour their goods vnder another mans name, and by ſome falſe and forged Certificates proue them to appertaine to other men, and ſo defraud the Kings Eſchecquer. For remedy whereof, and for the better auoiding of all couerts &amp; colluſions, the holy Houſe thinketh it the ſafer way to offer wrong than to ſuffer any. As within theſe few yeares there arriued at Siuill a certaine rich Marchant ſtranger, whoſe goods were afterwaad confiſcate for religion. Among the which they ſeiſed a very faire and a goodly ſhip, ſuch one, as by all mens iudgements, there neuer rode a better nor a fairer vpon the riuer. The party brought ſufficient proofe that the ſhip was none of his owne, &amp; yet notwithſtanding the Inquiſitours found a meanes that the law went on their ſides, ſo that the ſhip fell out in triall to be theirs. And this Marchants name was Reuchino.
               
               Moreouer, in the ſame Court of Inquiſition at Siuill, there was one of the Citizens, a verie godly and a vertuous man, ſeuerely perſecuted by the Inquiſitours for religion, howbeit not executed therefore. And among other of his puniſhments, this was one peece: that all his goods whereon hee liued and maintained himſelfe, reaſonably well and honeſtly among his neighbours, ſhould bee wholly conſiſcate, and he commitied to cloſe priſon for tenne yeares. Wherein, after he had remained by the ſpace of two or three daies, liuing there full barely (God wot) of a poor ſtock, that diuers wel diſpoſed perſons had gathered for him of their deuotion, hauing ſomtine liued in reaſonable good eſtate; one of the

Notaries of the Inquiſition, came vnto him with a bill ſigned and ſubſcribed by the Inquiſitours, charging him to pay to the Notaries hands 130. ducates for his commons and other expenſes, during the time of his aboad in Triana their priſon for the Inquiſition. The partie made anſwer (as the truth was) that thoſe good Fathers had taken from him all that euer he had, ſo that nothing was left him; and where nothing was, they could haue nothing. Howbeit this anſwer contented not the Inquiſitours, but they ſent the Notarie vnto him once againe, ſtraitly charging him either to pay the mony out of hand, or elſe to bee remoued from that priuate place, and carried to the common iayle, and there to remaine till he had diſcharged it. What mad fooles were theſe, to confiſcate all his goods, and charge themſelues by account for them into the Eſchequer, not foreſeeing to demand allowance for his charges?
               About the ſame time wel-neer, the Houſe of the Inquiſition at Siuill apprehended a certaine noble woman, whoſe name was Ioanna Bohorquia, the Lady and wife of one Franciſco Varquio, a noble gentleman, and baron of Higuera, daughter to one Pedro Garſia Xereſio a very rich Citizen of Siuill. The cauſe of her trouble was, for that a ſiſter of hers called Maria Bohorquia, a very vertuous virgine, and one that afterwards was burned for her profeſſion and faith, had confeſſed in the extreamitie of her torments, that ſhe had conference with her ſiſter in theſe matters of religion diuers times. This Lady, when ſhee was firſt committed to priſon, was gone with childe well-nigh halfe a yeare: in reſpect whereof, neyther did they ſhut her vp ſo cloſe, nor dealt with her otherwiſe ſo hardly, as they vſed to deale with others, for the regard of that that was within her. Notwithſtanding, within foure dayes after her deliuerance, they tooke the childe away from her, and the ſeuenth day next after, they ſhut her vp in cloſe priſon againe, entreating her in all things as they did the other

priſoners, and with as much cruelty as they vſed to any: in ſo much that in all her miſeries the only comfort that ſhe had, was, of the good company of a certaine vertuous maiden that was her fellow priſoner for a time, but afterwardes ſent to the ſtake. Vnto whom ſhe bare ſuch good will, that being on a time caried foorth to the racke, &amp; recaried to priſon, ſore ſtrained thereon and ſo ſhaken in peeces, that hauing a bed of flags which ſerued them both to couch on, more painefull a great deale then eaſefull, whereon ſhee tumbled her ſelfe ſo well as ſhee could (though hardly God knowes, and to her great paine and griefe) the good Lady being not in caſe able to do her any other good, yet did ſhee inwardly ſhew ſingular tokens of loue and compaſſion towards her. The ſame maid was ſcarſe recouered, or her ioynts well knit againe, but the ſaid Lady was likewiſe caried out to bee ſerued in the ſame ſort, &amp; was ſo terribly tormented in the Burrie &amp; Trough, that by reaſon of the exceding ſtrait ſtraining of the ſtrings pearcing to the very bones of her arms, thighes, &amp; ſhinnes, ſhe was carried to priſon halfe dead and more, the bloud guſhing out of her mouth amaine, and in ſo great abundance, that it could not bee otherwiſe, but that ſomewhat was broken within her body: but after 8. daies God deliuered her from theſe rauening Lions, and ſet her with himſelfe in euerlaſting reſt and peace. The bruit of which fact the Inquiſitours laboured earneſtly to ſuppreſſe, leſt it ſhould be noiſed abroad among the common people, that they had ſo villanouſly torne in peeces this tender Lady vpon the racke: but the beholders of this their tyranny could not hold it in. Now ſurely, if ſhee had been a witch, or a traitor to her husband, or a murderer of her owne children, and the temporall Magiſtrate had dealt ſo with her to make her confeſſe theſe horible factes, what time hee were to giue vp his accompts (as the maner is) hee ſhould pay for it full dearely, if ſo bee that hee had thus cruelly and without all reaſon entreated any perſon whatſoeuer.

Yet the holy Houſe is not to yeeld accompt of any ſuch matters, but may racke to death euen ſuch, whom they themſelues after more preciſe and exact proofe, do acquit for innocents, and eſcape ſcotfree therfore, as it came to paſs in the example of this vertuous lady. For being one of ſuch eſtate, and of ſo good name and fame that they muſt neceſſarily yeld ſome accompt of her caſe vnto the common people, and were deſtitute of proofes ſufficient (though they had left no deuice or policy vnpractiſed, that they could imagine) ſeeing the matter ſo apparant to all the world, that by no meanes it could bee diſſembled: therefore the very firſt day of their next Triumph, they cauſed their ſentence which they had giuen vpon her, to be openly read there vnto the people one this wiſe: Foraſmuch as this Lady died in priſon (without ſhewing how or by what meanes I warrant you) and vpon diligent hearing and conſideration of her cauſe, is found innocent: therefore the holy houſe doth wholly acquit and diſcharge her of all ſuites and quarrels commenced againſt her by the Fiſcal, and doth reſtore her to her former eſtate of eſtimation and honour, abſoluing her clearely from all guilt and crime: and thereupon doo command, that reſtitution be made of all ſuch goods as were ſeiſed into the Sequeſter, vnto the hands of ſuch perſons as haue right and title thereunto, &amp;c. Thus, after that they had moſt beaſtly murdered her on the rack, they made her this goodly amends, to denounce her not guilty. God will one day (no doubt) aske an accompte of this their beaſtly and barbarous tyranny, ſith they maintaine it by the ſame power and authoritie in earth, which he hath ordeined, for the reuenge of theſe and ſuch like iniuries.
               Notwithſtanding, not long after it happened, that the holie houſe was aduiſed and fully bent to lay their baites and ſpread their nets in certaine quarters there: but if they had not vpon better aduiſement afterward wound them vp againe, they themſelues vnawares had giuen Rome

ſuch a gird, as I beleeue all the Lutherans hitherto haue not giuen it a greater. And thus it was. There were certain perſons, that were much more buſie than I beleeue they had thanke for, which found great fault with a foule companie Monkes and other religious men, for abuſing their auricular Confeſsion; vnder the colour thereof, masking with honeſt matrons and maydens that reſorted vnto them, making it a meanes to breake their ſutes by, and to compaſſe their purpoſes. The which thing the holy Houſe thought indeede worthie of conſideration and redreſſe. But foraſmuch as it was a hard to know who were theſe wooers and brokers, where none was appeached ſpecially and by name (as it happeneth in a matter wherein a multitude offendeth) they cauſed proclamation to bee made throughout all the Churches within the prouince of Siuill verie ſolemnly, that whoſoeuer knew of their owne certaine knowledge, or had heard by report of others, of anie Monkes or other religious or ſpirituall perſons (as they call them) that had abuſed their holy ſacrament of Confeſſion, to anie ſuch abominable actes or enterpriſes, or that anie other ghoſtly Father had dealt in anie ſuch like ſort with anie of his ſhrift children, that euerie ſuch perſon and perſons priuie to anie ſuch matters, ſhould come in within thirtie dayes, &amp; ſignifie it to the holy Houſe of Inquiſition; enioining moreouer, verie great penalties for ſuch as ſhould refuſe or contemne to come in accordingly, and to make declaration, what they were able to ſay: The proclamation was no ſooner made and publiſhed, but there came ſuch a number of women, onely inhabitants within the citie of Siuill, to complaine of their ghoſtly Fathers, that twentie Notaries, and as many Inquiſitors would not haue ſufficed to take the names of ſuch as came in and entred their complaints: wherfore the Inquiſitors, hauing more to doe than well they could diſpatch, gaue them other thirtie dayes come in and doe the like. But becauſe ſo little time

would not ſerue (they came in ſo thick) they gaue them ſo much more reſpite againe the third time: and after that the fourth, and there they were enformed to lay a ſtraw. For very many honeſt matrons and of good calling, partly of a fooliſh feare and ſuperſtition, leſt they ſhould bee excommunicated, and partly in reſpect of their husbands whom they were loth to offend and bring into a iealouſie or ſuſpicion of their honeſties, kept themſelues at home, thinking to eſpie better ſome oportunitie to ſpeake with the Inquiſitours apart. Whereupon they they attired themſelues with vailes or mufflers after the maner of their country, &amp; went to the holy houſe as priuily as they could. Notwithſtanding, their husbands did ſo narrowly watch them during all the time of this appeaching, that they could not poſſibly paſſe ſo priuily but diuers of them were eſpied, whereby they occaſioned their husbands vehemently to ſuſpect their honeſties. On the other ſide, it was a iolly ſport to ſee the Monkes and Friers and Prieſts goe vp and downe hanging downe their heads, all in dump and melancholly, by meanes of their guiltie conſciences, quaking and trembling, and looking euery howre when ſome of the Familiars ſhould take them by the ſleeue, &amp; call them in Coram for theſe matters. Inſomuch that a number feared leſt as great a plague were come among them, as the perſecution that was ſo hot about that time againſt the Lutherans. But the Inquiſitours perceiuing that theſe matters thus purpoſed, would ſound not onely to the great hinderance of themſelues, but alſo turne to the decay of the whole Church of Rome, and that this onely enterpriſe of theirs, if it ſhould goe on and take effect, would bee enough to bring all their ſpiritualtie into vtter hatred &amp; obloquie, but ſpecially tend to the diſcredit of their auricular confeſſion, which began alreadie to be but of ſmall account, although it was a matter that otherwiſe deſerued both ſtraitly to be examined, and ſeuerely to be puniſhed: yet did they in time take it vp, and made a ſtay therein,

contrary to all mens expectations: winding vp all theſe matters, whereof the Court was now orderly and lawfully ſeiſed. And as the report was, the Monkes and Prieſts made a common purſe, &amp; with a good round ſumme greaſed the Pope in the hand, ſo that he was content to grant a general pardon to all the whole company of Confeſſors, of his fatherly love and affection towards them, remitting all offences done or committed by them, &amp; commanding the Inquiſitours to ſurceaſe from proceeding any further, but wholly to ſuppreſs ſuch things as were paſſed alreadie, not ſuffering them in anie caſe to come to light. Howbeit thoſe that are priuy to the Inquiſitours dealings, ſay it is an vnlikely matter, affirming, that if the Pope ſhould make any ſuch grant, yet is the holy Inquiſition of ſuch preeminence, that if they take in hand any matter of weight, they will not ſurceaſe vpon the Popes inhibition or countermanding, and that it is oftener ſeene, that their authoritie preuaileth againſt the Popes, than his againſt them, as by this example following may more plainely appeare.
               Not paſſing two yeares before this, the Biſhop of Rome had by a like fooliſh part and vnawares cut the Inquiſitors combes, by publiſhing a generall Iubily, which they call a generall charter of pardon, for the ſafetie of all Chriſtendome, becauſe Chriſt belike did not ſufficiently prouide therefore, beſides a number of other pardons &amp; indulgences for ſuch as were ſuſpected to be Lutherans: ſo cunningly can this fellow make a gaine of the Goſpel to himſelfe. And wheras he cannot auoid the dart that Chriſt hath ſent into the world to plague him withall, but that he muſt be ſtricken therwith, he ceaſeth not to turn it ſome way to his owne aduantage. The words of the pardon were theſe: That whoſo in time paſt had been a Lutheran, and would forſake that ſect, might be abſolued thereof by his ghoſtly father. An old deuice of the diuell, that in as much as there aroſe about the ſame time great trouble in Spaine, but ſpecially

in Siuill the chiefe city thereof, and that a number offended therein, and began now to ſhrink from them, they might the more quietly and with leſſe danger keepe them in obedience, going about to win them by a kinde of clemencie and mercie, though fained and counterfait, rather then by dealing with them ſtraitly or ſeuerely. Howbeit, here was nothing found fault withall ſaue only the preiudicing of the holy Houſe, whereof as it ſeemed, the Pope had no great regard. Whereupon, they of the Inquiſition being ſomwhat moued, by reaſon that that one only clauſe had loſt them a good booty, contemned the Popes pardon, &amp; reſiſted it with might and maine, commanding peremptorily, that no ſuch pardon ſhould be publiſhed, as ſhould turne the holy Houſe to any preiudice: by meanes wherof neither was it receiued ne proclaimed. Loe, heer may a man ſee Sathan diuided againſt himſelfe, and perceiue thereby, that this denying of the Popes abſolute authoritie, which theſe good gentlemen puniſh in others with fire &amp; ſword, as being a neceſſary article of our beliefe, is but a noſe of waxe, which they turne what way they liſt: ſo that it ſerueth them rather in ſtead of a trap to entangle vs withall, then accounted of as an article of our faith, in the obſeruation whereof conſiſteth our ſaluation.
               The propertie of euerie tyrant is, ſpecially to hate both mercie and truth, and to vſe all crueltie and extremity that may be: or elſe to ſeek vtterly to be hated, when he ſeeth there is none other meanes to vphold him. As it was ſaid ſometime by one: Whom men fear, they doe but hate. And truly, if a man be diſpoſed to mark them well, he ſhall eaſily perceiue, that there hath bin hitherto no tyrant, that hath more duely obſerued theſe lawes, nor executed them more cruelly, than this holy Houſe hath done, deuiſing to doe all iniury and extremity that poſſibly they can, onely to bring men in feare and awe of them: ſo that they ſeem to deſire nothing ſo much as this; that all men may fear them, hate them who dare, foraſmuch as they puniſh trifling to ye
                     •
                  ,

and matters of no importance, yea ſuch as are ſcarce blameworthy, moſt ſeuerely and beyond all meaſure, as by the examples here enſuing may appeare moſt manifeſtly.
               At what time their Church was in ſo good and quiet eſtate, that the Inquiſitors had leiſure enough to take their pleaſure abroad, it chanced that the Biſhop of Tarracon high commiſſioner in the Inquiſition at Siuill (of whoſe holineſſe I haue made mention before) walked in a ſummers day for his recreation by the ſweet gardens that ſtand by the Riuer Guadalqueuir, accompanied with all his traine and in his ſtate as he was wont at diuers other times to do. Hard vpon the banke of a certaine pond that was in the ſame garden, where my Lord Biſhop at that time was recreating himſelfe, by chance there ſat a little child playing, that was the gardiners ſonne, not paſſing two or three yeares of age, out of whoſe hands one of the Inquiſitours Pages hapned to ſnatch a reede wherewith the child was making himſelfe ſport, as children are wont to doe, by meanes whereof the child cryed after his reede. Tke father hearing the child cry, came ſtraight-way to know the cauſe, and vnderſtanding it, was ſomewhat offended therewithall, &amp; prayed the Biſhops Page to giue the little child his reed againe: but becauſe he made little account of the gardiners words, proudly ſcorning and diſdaining the poore man, he offred to ſnatch it from him, and by reaſon that he held ſomewhat hard, a ſhiuer of the reed raced the Pages hand. It was no deaths wound I wis, nor any great maime, ſuch as ſhould deſerue anie great puniſhment, but only a ſmall ſcratch, like as a broken reed could make; I wot not well what to make of it, nor how to deſcribe it: ſuch a thing as the verie childe would haue made no mone for. The Page yet goeth to his Lord that walked not far off, to make complaint of this bloudſhed. Whoſe Lordſhip commanded, that the gardiner ſhould bee taken immediately and carried to Triana, where hee was laden with irons, and there continued by the ſpace of nine moneths,

and in the end loſt that little that hee had: which was not much God knows, and yet a hard thing for the poor man to recouer and get before hand againe, his wife and children perhaps ſtaruing in the mean time. And all this was only becauſe he had no ſpeciall regard to the Biſhops Page, in forbearing him as a member of the holy Houſe: but after the 9. moneths hee releaſed him, making him beleeue, that he had dealt with him in much more gentle and mild ſort, than his caſe deſerued.
               There was alſo in Siuill a certaine poore man that laboured for his owne liuing, and for his whole familie full duely and truely, and with the ſweat of his browes, whoſe wife a certaine Church-man kept againſt his will, and neyther the holy Inquiſition, nor anie other Court would puniſh this villanie. This poore man on a time being among his companions, where one of the companie miniſtred talke about purgatorie, and happened to take his tale by the end, of meer ſimplicitie, rather then of anie malice, and to ſay, that hee had purgatorie enough for his ſhare in that a vile knaue kept his wife from him perforce, &amp;c. the which talke comming to the good Prieſts eare, gaue him matter enough to worke vpon, and to procure the poore man a double diſpleaſure. Whereupon he accuſed him to the holy Houſe, as one holding an euill opinion of purgatorie. And they thought this a great deale more heynous offence, than the wicked fact of the Prieſt. For the poore ſoule for this onely offence was taken and thruſt into priſon, where he remained two whole yeares together, and at the length was brought vpon the ſtage, and had iudgement to wear the Sambenite, by the ſpace of of 3. yeares more, in ſome priuate place of impriſonment; and after that time expired, to be diſmiſſed or further retained as the Inquiſitours ſhould thinke good. Neither did they leaue him any one groat of all his poore ſubſtance, as they did let the Prieſt alone with his harlot: but notwithſtanding his long impriſonmēt, did likewiſe confiſcate that

little that was renaining. Behold, this is the Spaniſh Inquiſition, which ſo ſtoutly maintaineth the Chriſtian faith, purgeth religion of hereſies, and perſecuteth the teachers thereof.
               Moreouer, there was at Saint Lucars a certain ſtranger, howbeit ſuch a one as had remained in Spaine by the ſpace of twentie yeares, who of a very blind ſuperſtition dwelt in a wilderneſſe within a Chappell: where hearing it reported on a time, that a great number of Lutherans were dayly apprehended at Siuill by the Inquiſitours, and that they had made an edict, whereby commandement was giuen vnder paine of excommunication, that euerie man ſhould repaire to the holy Houſe with all ſpeede, and declare to the holy Inquiſition whatſoeuer hee knew eyther by himſelfe, or by anie other, concerning anie of theſe aforeſaid matters (for the Inquiſitours meant ſpeciall fauour to ſuch, as voluntarily would come in and accuſe themſelues) this doltiſh Hermite came to Siuill, went to the holy Houſe, and accuſed himſelfe before the Inquiſitours. The matter was, for that hee being ſometime at Geneua, had heard a certaine Frier diſpute of ſuch matters, namely, of Iuſtificatiō by faith in Chriſt, of purgatory, and ſuch other like, and liked thereof verie well, though afterward ſince that time hee gaue no great heede to them, nor greatly remembred them, and therefore came now to confeſſe his fault, and to craue their pardon. But as ſoon as the Inquiſitors had heard his confeſſion (perhaps to fill vp ſome emptie room in their iayle, or to make vp their tale, wanting an odde man, they ſent the Hermite to priſon, where after he had remained a ſpace, they brought him out vpon the ſtage, and there gaue ſentence vpon him to weare the Sambenite, and to ſuffer three moneths impriſonment, and to forfait all his goods. So ſhameleſſe (Loe) are theſe ſhauelings, that they can play ſuch prettie pranks openly, and ſo ſeuerely puniſh theſe trifles euen in their owne darlings.
               
                  
There iſſued alſo in the ſelfe ſame Triumph a certaine honeſt man a Citizen of Siuill, without eyther cap or cloke hauing a taper in his hand, of whom they exacted, after he had bin impriſoned a whole year together, a hundred ducates to wards the charges of the Inquiſition. The cauſe of his trouble was, for ſaying, that theſe outragious expenſes beſtowed in the erecting of thoſe curious monuments (as they unproperly tearm them) made of paper &amp; wickers on holy Thurſday to Chriſt that is in Heauen, as alſo the other, that are ſpent on corpus Chriſtiday (as they of Siuill are marueilous exceſſiue that way) ſhould be more acceptable in the ſight of God, if they were beſtowed vpon the poore in almes, or in the beſtowing of poore and fatherleſſe maydens in mariage. For the which words the partie was both puniſhed in this ſort; and as one ſuſpected for a Lutheran, abiured de vehementi.
               
               Alſo at the ſelfe ſame time, and in the verie ſame Triumph there was a certaine poore man brought before the people, who on a time as there chanced a quarrell to ariſe betwixt him and a Prieſt of Eciia a citie in Granata, hapned to ſay of the Prieſt in preſence of other, that hee could not be perſwaded, that euer God would come downe into the hands of that moſt abominable adulterer. For the wch ſaying, the Ordinaries deputie had puniſhed this poore man, howbeit the Prieſt held not himſelfe content therewithall, but did afterwards before the Inquiſitours lay blaſphemie to his charge: who not with ſtanding his former puniſhment, commanded him to be ſhut vp cloſe for a yeare, and at the end thereof, cauſed him to be brought out before the people in their ſolemne Triumph without eyther cloke or cap, with a taper in his hand, hauing a barnacle clapped vpon his tongue, to reuenge the blaſphemie that he had vttered, and ſo was abiured de leui.
               
               Among the reſt, there were alſo two brought into the ſtage at the ſame time, both young men and ſtudents: The

one for writing in his tables certaine verſes, the author wherof was vnknowne: which were ſo cunningly contriued, that they ſeemed to ſound both wayes, eyther to the great praiſe or diſpraiſe of Luther, as it pleaſed the reader to conſtrue them: for the which onely cauſe hee endured a whole yeares impriſonment, and was afterwards brought vpon the ſcaffeld in his hoſe and dublet, bare-headed with a waxe taper in his hand, and baniſhed Siuill and the ſuburbes thereof for 3. yeares ſpace, and abiured de leui. The other onely for taking a copy of thoſe verſes, liking them well for the deuice ſake and prettie inuention, had the like iudgement, ſaue only that in ſtead of baniſhment, he paid 100. ducates towards the charges of the holy Houſe.
               With ſuch examples as theſe be, a man might eaſily fill whole volumes, but that I ſuppoſe theſe to bee ſufficient which are already reported, to occupy mens eares withal, that they may vnderſtand &amp; ſee a great ſort of more ſtrange parts than theſe, which the holy Houſe playeth dayly, whereby appeareth moſt manifeſty, by what ſpirit they are guided and gouerned in all their doings, and what their intent is, and how good their title i
                     •
                   whereby they claime and challenge to the place it ſelfe the name of the holy Houſe, to themſelues the titles of holy Fathers and Patròne of the Faith: where with they haue bleared mens eyes hitherto: ſo that it is eaſie for euerie man to iudge whether Chriſtian godlineſſe. &amp; the true knowledge and worſhipping of God, with the kingdome of Chriſt (the perfect comfort of all good men) be by theſe meanes encreaſed &amp; enlarged, or rather not deſtroied, ſcattered and ſubuerted▪ and Sathans kingdome that is built vpon lyes, wrought with craft and ſubtiltie, vp holden and maintained by crueltie, robberie, and murther of many good &amp; godly men; whether I ſay it be not hereby more amplified &amp; enlarged.
            
            
               
               CHAP. XV.
               
                  Certaine ſpeciall treatiſes vpon diuers godly Martyrs of Chriſt, who dying very conſtantly like good Chrſtians for the profeſsion of the Goſpel, yet the Inquiſitors notwithſtanding deuiſed to defame and ſlander them with Apoſtacie and reuolting.
               
               THe Inquiſitours thinke it not ſufficient to execute ſuch by moſt cruell death, as contemning all their tyrannie, remaine firme and conſtant in the profeſſion of the Goſpel of Chriſt, before their faces and in open Court, but ſeek by all meanes poſſible as much as lieth in them, vtterly to extinguiſh in them the life of their ſoules, which is Chriſt leſus dwelling in their hearts by faith, of whom they haue declared themſelues to be faithfull Confeſſours as well at their death as in their life: For when they ſee all their polices void and to haue none effect, becauſe Chriſt taketh into his mightie protection and ſafegard all his ſeruants, ſo that no man is able to take them out of his hands (as he ſaith himſelfe) then deuiſe they meanes to rob them as much as in them lyeth of their name and renowne of conſtancie, by ſcattering abroad falſe tales and miſreports of them after their deaths, yea ſometimes ere they be dead, as they ſtand vpon the ſtage, clapping their engines vpon their tongues, becauſe they ſhould not contrarie them, reporting by them, that they haue forſaken their former faith, and returned to the Romiſh religion.
               And this is a double deuice of the diuels owne brain, for two ſpeciall conſiderations, which doe euidently proue that they are aſſiſted by his wicked ſpirit. For hereby they doe not onely rob the Martyrs themſelues of their due deſerued praiſe for their conſtancie and perſeuerance: but alſo the Church of Chriſt is ſpoiled of thoſe examples, wherin ſhe ſhould otherwiſe reioice, in making her reckoning. Therefore ſith that in diuers Acts of faith (as they tearm them) they haue dealt in this ſort with diuers,

of whoſe conſtancie God hath many wayes aſſured vs: it will be expedient that vnto this former treatiſe I doe alſo adde theſe ſeuerall and particular hiſtories, to the intent that the honour and eſtimation that is due to good and godly Martyrs, may be yeelded vnto them accordingly, &amp; the Church like wiſe reioice as ſhe hath good cauſe: laſtly, that the memorie of them may be preſerued and kept, both to the glorie of God, the increaſe of his Church, and the vtter ſhame and confuſion of this their holy Houſe.
               
                  Iohn Pontio de Leon.
                  IN the firſt ſeſſion holden at Siuill againſt the Profeſſours of Chriſtian religion (whom they call Lutherans) there was brought forth in the triumph at the ſame time, one Iohn Pontio de Leon, ſonne to Rhoderico Pontio de Leon Earle of Balen, borne of a noble Houſe, and a very good goſpeller, as well for his learning and knowledge, as for the practice thereof, with the continuance of many yeares, as I my ſelfe am able to make report for the great familiaritie and acquaintance that I had with him a long ſeaſon, and therefore (if need were) could giue a true and a faithfull teſtimonie thereof (before God I ſpeake it) but that all that euer knew him, or that had occaſion to marke his conuerſation, will with one conſent (I dare ſay) teſtifie the ſame. Among other vertues that appeared to bee in him vnſainedly and without hypocriſie, he was ſingular in one thing, in that he had an exceeding loue &amp; compaſſion towards his poor &amp; needy brethrē: inſomuch that being left very wealthie by his father, able to continue that port that his Anceſtors kept, fell by ſuch meanes almoſt into ſtarke beggery: howbeit ſuch as was to him neither noiſome nor grieuous. Not with ſtanding, diuers haue giuen their blind and fooliſh verdits of him therefore, attributing that to folly &amp; prodigalitie, which he did of a rare &amp; ſingular vertue. But ſince he liued ſo well that none could iuſtly ſo much

as ſuſpect any euill example of life to be in him, and many were in their extremities relieued by his goodneſſe: beſides this, accepted in ſo good part his poor &amp; hard eſtate, as by all mens iudgements he did very patiently, and in ſuch ſort as a great deale meaner men would ſcarce haue taken a farre better eſtate than hee was in; theſe things muſt needs be euident proofes of a ſingular grace of God to be in him, and ſuch a perfect kind of vertue as was void of all hypocriſie. Yet in recompence of that ſingular pitty &amp; compaſſion which he ſhewed in this world towards others, he was apprehended by the Inquiſitours for profeſſing the Goſpel, and after he had manfully maintained his quarrell againſt their malicious falſhoods during the time of his impriſonment (which was the ſpace of two or three moneths) whether it were the very extremitie of their torments that enforced him, or their faire and flattering promiſes of ſafetie and deliuerance that allured him, but hee ſhrunke at the length and yeelded, where erſt hee was inuincible, ſtooping and ſubmitting himſelfe to the obedience of the Romiſh Church. The firſt that euer enticed him ſo ſhamefully to reuolt, was one of theſe ſtinging and venemous flies whom they had caſt into priſon with him in maner as hath beene already declared: who being a man verie well learned, and beſides that a deepe diſſembler, did rather by his cunning enchantments bewitch him, than by any force of reaſons diſſwade or ſeduce him. Howbeit though God ſuffered him ſo to fall for a while, that hee might ſomewhat vnderſtand the frailtie of man, and ſenſibly feele it in himſelfe, yet ſtill remembring his owne word and promiſe, that none ſhall take anie of his flocke from vnder his hands, did not long time thus leaue him to himſelfe, but raiſing him vp againe moſt mightily, reſtored vnto him the double ſtrength that he had before. For the very night immediately before his execution hee did moſt manfully defend the truth againſt his Confeſſor in the hearing of diuers as well priſoners, as alſo

the Officers of the holy Houſe: for at ſuch times, their confeſsion is not meer auricular: inſomuch that being demanded by the Prieſt whether he would bee ſhriuen or no, where before the time of his apprehenſion and impriſonment hee vſed commonly to goe to ſhrift, he now refuſed, rebuking the Prieſt for his labour. And being vrged with his former doings, anſwered, that hee did it to ſerue the weakneſſe of his brethren, and for feare of offence to them that as yet were not proceeded ſo farre, and yet made his choice of his ghoſtly father; ſo as his ſhrift was more like a godly collation, than a popiſh confeſsion: Mary now (ſaith he) as the caſe ſtandeth there needeth no ſuch yeelding. The next day, when ſentence was pronounced vpon him, were openly read theſe articles among others, for the which he was chiefly and principally condemned. Firſt that he ſhould ſay, that hee from the bottome of his heart abhorred the Idolatrie that was committed in the adoration of the bread, &amp; therfore ſo oft as it was his chance to meet it, being caried abroad to ſick perſons, hee eyther turned ſome other by-way, and auoided it, or elſe haſted ſo that he forewent it, becauſe he ſhould otherwiſe haue bin enforced to doe vnto it ſome kinde of worſhip or honour; and at many times chancing to bee in the high Quier, would turne his backe becauſe hee would not behold the eleuation, and for the moſt part vſed to goe to the place where execution was accuſtomably done, (like as was Smithfield here in London) and there would walk a good ſort of turnes, to the end, that by continuall meditation of the martyrdome, but ſpecially of that faithfull and glorious confeſsion, which the wicked of this world by force and tyranny cauſed the godly there to make vnto Chriſt (by thus acquainting himſelfe with the place) hee might be the more emboldned, looking one day to be called thither, and ſo ſhould in the meane time prepare himſelfe, patiently to take it when it came. Likewiſe, at ſuch times as by order he ſhould receiue his Maker (as they ſay) he vſed

to remoue his houſhold, and to ſend them to ſome other place, making them beleeue at their returne that hee had ſo done, becauſe they ſhould not be offended to ſee him take ſuch libertie. But the effect of his confeſſion moreouer was this: that the iuſtification of a Chriſtian man reſteth only in the merirs of Ieſus Chriſt through only faith in him, and that other purgatory there was none. As for the Popes pardons and indulgences, they were but meer parchment and lead, &amp; he very Antichriſt, &amp;c. concerning my ſelfe (ſaith he) I am not only willing, but deſirous to dye &amp; ready to ſuffer any other puniſhment for this truth which I haue confeſſed, eſteeming of this world 
                        •
                     and the treaſures thereof in none other reſpect, then for my neceſſary vſes, to ſerue my neceſſity, and the reſt to beſtow in the maintenance and ſetting forward of the ſame doctrine which I haue of late profeſſed: &amp; therefore I beſeech God dayly vpon my knees both for my wife and children, that they may all continue in this quarrell to the very death. Howbeit the holy Houſe labored earneſtly by all means, to depraue him, &amp; therwithall, to depriue him of the due cō
                     mendation for that notable cōfeſſion made by him, ſpreading abroad falſe tales of his fall and departure from his late profeſſion, moſt ſpightfully and maliciouſly. Notwithſtanding I am able in few words to confute them, euen by this one argument, that in the exemplifications wch they cauſed to be made of ſuch matters as were done and paſſed in that act or ſeſsion, being not very circumſpect, they haue vnawares told the plaine truth themſeluesgoing about to ſet out the offences &amp; puniſhments of this good man, contained in theſe words, which are extant vnto this day: Iohn Pontio de Leon was burned as an Obſtinate Lutheran hereticke. The which word of it ſelfe, to ſuch as doubt of the parties conſtancie, is occaſion ſufficient to ſuſpect the Inquiſitors craftie and deceitfull dealing. But as for vs, his good conuerſation, whereof diuers can bear witneſſe, hath credit and perſwaſion enough of itſelfe.
               
               
                  
                  Iohn Gonſalue a Preacher.
                  THere was executed likewiſe, at the ſame time &amp; Triumph, a certaine Preacher that ſome time had been a Prieſt, but at that time no great Clerke: yet afterwards a man of very godly life and conuerſation, and one that became very well learned in the ſcriptures, whence onely hee learned true Godlineſſe, giuing ouer all that Sophiſticall and Dunſicall diuinitie, wherein hee had ſpent a great deale of time very idly. In all his ſermons hee bent his whole force to beatinto mens mindes the true way and meanes of our Iuſtification to conſiſt in Chriſt alone, and in ſtedfaſt faith in him, all the merits of man quite abandoned and ſet apart. His name was Iohn Gonſalue. But of ſuch profeſsion, there could enſue none other effect than did. As for his confeſsion, by the Inquiſitours owne reports, it was all one with the former that Iohn Pontio made, ſo that it fell out accordingly, that as before times they were ioined together in familiaritie and friendſhip, they ſhould alſo now bee linked together in like profeſsion, and make the like ends. Howbeit the night before his death, preparing himſelf to dye, he ſuffered a great conflict with his Confeſſours; whom notwitſtanding after much adoo on both ſides, hee ſent away with ſhame enough. And at his departure out of the Caſtle Triana, towards the ſcaffold, accompanied with two of his owne ſiſters that went to the ſame feaſt that he did, leauing alſo behind him two of his brethren, whereof the 
                        〈…〉
                     e and his mother were in like caſe executed at the next act, yet did he ſhew himſelfe to be of a notable courage &amp; conſtancy. For at the very firſt ſtep, iſſuing out of the caſtle gate and ſtanding in the full view of all the people, which had heard him at diuers times make very many godly ſermons, 
                        •
                     e began with a loud voice to recite the 106. Pſal. Deus laudem mea
                           〈…〉
                         ne tacueris, &amp;c. curſing &amp; condemning all hypocrits as the worſt ſort of people that were. Neither changed he

his countenance any thing at all after hee was mounted vpon the ſtage, albeit they had ſtocked his tongue; becauſe he began ſomewhat to comfort one of his ſiſters, whom he knew to be tender of nature, exhorting her to conſtancie and perſeuerance. Alſo when his ſentence was in reading he gaue very good eare vnto it, being nothing therewithall diſmaied, eyther at the degradation, whereunto they ſetled themſelues after their maner very ſolemnly, or at the putting on of ſuch ornaments and enſignes as were appointed for him &amp; his mates. The which things tho they ſeemed in the eyes of the world very odious, &amp; much founding to his rebuke and infamie, yet in the ſight of God and his Angels, were beautifull (no doubt) and glorious. To wit: they deſpoiled him of thoſe vile and wicked Maſsing robes, and arayed him with a Sambenite, a cope, and a paper hatte. But night drawing on, and ſuch as ſhould ſuffer being come into the place of execution, they were all commanded to ſay their Credo, the which each of them did ſeuerally: and when they came to that article: I beleeue the holy Catholick Church, they were alſo commanded to adde therunto the Church of Rome. But there they ſtaied all at once. Then were the Monkes and Friers in hand with Iohn Gonſalues ſiſters and other women then preſently to be executed, that they would adde it in their belief, and in that article put in the Church of Rome. Who anſwered, that they would doe as Iohn Gonſalue did, not becauſe they depended vpon him, or were doubtfull eyther what to ſay themſelues, or elſe what he would doe, but to the intent that his tongue might by that meanes bee looſed, that hee might declare his minde as well concerning that article, as the reſt of his whole beliefe. Whereupon hauing his tongue at liberty, like a good and godly ſchoolmaiſter he comforted them, willing them to be of good cheer, &amp; told them there was no more to be added. Immediatly after this confeſsion thus by them made, they broke their necks with a trice, ere the fire were kindled,

and forthwith began to noiſe abroad, that they had added thoſe words of the Romiſh Church in that article of their beliefe, accordingly as they were willed to doe, and ſo departed, acknowleding and confeſsing the Church of Rome to be the true and Catholick Church.
               
               
                  Of foure women of Siuil.
                  
                  IN the congregation at Siuill, which the Inquiſitours had wellnigh conſumed by fire, among thoſe that had been a long time profeſſours of the truth, there were foure women moſt notable and famous aboue the reſt, for their good &amp; godly conuerſation. That is to ſay: Iſabella Vaenia, Maria Viroeſia, Cornelia, and one Bohorquia youngeſt of the four: for ſhe was ſcarcely 21. years of age, &amp; yet for vertuous conuerſation comparable to her other fellowes: but in the knowledge of holy Scriptures, which ſhee had gotten by continuall reading, and ſtudying, and conference with godly and learned men (whereof there were in Siuill a great number at that time) ſhee became ſo ſingular, that ſhee did not onely farre exceede and ſurpaſſe her fellowes, but many of our Maiſters that are taken for great learned Clerkes, whom in the time of her impriſonment ſhee draue oftentimes to the wall, by their owne confeſsion, and made them aſhamed of themſelues. But Vaenia the firſt woman was a Matron for maners, and her houſe a Schoole of vertue, and a place of reſort, where the congregation aſſembled to ſing Pſalms and hymnes to God both day and night. Nothing was there prophaned, nothing done of hypocriſie and diſsimulation, all was pure &amp; perfect religion. At the laſt, the time being come that God had appointed for them, to bee made ready and ripe for him, and ſo to be both apt and able profeſſors of his name and truth, the Inquiſitors ſent for them, &amp; at one draught caught theſe foure with diuers other of their neighbours. The firſt thing that occaſioned this Bohorquia to

ſuch earneſt ſtudy of the Scriptures, was a little skill which ſhe had in the Latin tongue, wherein it was lawfull to read the Scriptures, both as often, and as long as ſhe liſted; being reſtrained and forbidden, that in no caſe the common people ſhould read them in their own tongue. Yea her ſchoolmaiſter D. Giles, a man whom ſhe did ſpecially chuſe for his ſingular integritie of life, as well as for his excellent learning, was wont to giue this teſtimonie of her, that he neuer came into her companie but he learned ſomewhat, and ſo departed thence alwaies better learned than hee came. During the time of her impriſonment, the Monks and Dominicanes had great diſputations with her, marueiling as much at the paſsing excellencie of her wit in anſwering all their ſubtill and ſophiſticall obiections, and (as it were) cutting them ſo quickly with the ſword of Gods word, as alſo at the wonderfull memorie which ſhee had in citing the holy Scripturs ſo readily: inſomuch that after they had done diſputing &amp; reaſoning with her, they gaue very good teſtimonies of her conſtancy and ſober behauiour, albeit they termed it by the names of wilfulneſſe and obſtinacie. After they had kept her a long time in that darke dungeon, and there cauſed her to endure all the cruell and extream torments that might be (by meanes wherof they forced her to confeſſe of her owne ſiſter, that ſhee was alſo one of the ſame religion: which was the occaſion firſt of her ſiſters impriſonment, &amp; ſo conſequently of her death, being murthered moſt cruelly among thoſe villains by extreame torments) they brought her forth vpon the ſcaffold, with diuers other godly men &amp; women, wherof I made mention before. How beit ſhe came in ſuch ſort as one making a ſemblance of ioy and mirth and conqueſt ouer the holy Inquiſition, rather then otherwiſe. The which ſtrange countenance of mirth, for ſo much as it was rare to ſee in her, and vnaccuſtomed, vttered by ſinging Pſalms to God, the Inquiſitours of ſpite and malice, ſought to alter into another tune, by ſetting a Barnacle

on her tongue in the way as ſhe went, which notwithſtanding ere they came to the ſcaffold they did vndoo againe. When they had read their ſentence vpon her openly, and giuen iudgement of death, the Inquiſitours asked her whether ſhe would recant yea or no, acknowledging her hereſies which heretofore ſhee had moſt willfully maintained. Wherunto ſhe anſwered them roundly, that neither ſhee would, nor truely could confeſſe ſo much. And ſo from thence ſhe paſſed with her other companions to the place of execution accompanied with theſe hypocrites, ſtill calling vpon her and her fellowes by the way to adde the Church of Rome in the article of their creed: but ſhee among the reſt moſt ſtoutly withſtood them. Notwithſtanding, the abominable villains, to the intent to blemiſh their good name and renoune by their moſt villanous trecheries, ſtrangled them with halters, as though they had at their laſt houres returned to the Romiſh Church: in conſideration whereof, the Inquiſitours taking pity on them, would not ſuffer them (ſay they) to bee burned quicke. Moreouer, their tyranny did alſo extend to the very walles where theſe holy aſſemblies and congregations were kept. For there was ſpeciall commaundement giuen, that the houſe wherein Vaenia dwelt, ſhould bee razed to the earth, from the very foundation, and conuerted to a perpetuall waſt ground, and in the middeſt of the plat an inſcription to be ſet in marble; for the wicked and idolatrous generation, a monument of many misdeedes, but to the Godly, a perpetuall memoriall of the true ſeruants of God, in whom Chriſt did moſt truely and perfectly dwell.
               
               
                  Ferdinando à Sancto Ioanno.
                  THis man likewiſe was one of the chiefe and moſt worthy members of the ſame congregation; I meane for the true feare of God that was in him, his ſingular honeſty, his ſeruent and exceeding zeale of doing good to

his neighbours without any regard of his own commodity, not in reſpect of his parentage, or any curioſity about his body, or otherwiſe in his behauiour or ſpeech. A young man indeede, yet for integrity of life, very notable and famous, Preſident of the Houſe of learning (as they terme it) and choſen therunto by the iudgements of many godly men that were firſt founders thereof, to inſtruct and teach the youth in the Colledge called the Colledge of children. In the which office after he had remained by the ſpace of 8. yeares, to his great commendation, he was perceiued to bee a Lutheran, that is to ſay, a man conformed to the very paterne of true and perfect piety: wherevnto alſo (as his duty required) he had wrought his ſchollers, as much as lay in him to do in a time of ſo great perſecution and tyranny. But his reward for his paines, if we reſpect mans recompencing, was much like vnto that which the common ſort of thankleſs people yeeld a man for his good deſerts: but reſpecting faith, ſuch as Chriſt foretold his diſciples that they ſhould find among men. For, being moſt terribly tormented vpon the Ieobit or the Trough, and ſo ſhaken in euery ioynt, that when hee was taken down thence hee was not of ſtrength able to moue any part of his body: notwithſtanding thoſe villains the tormenters tooke and drew him by the heeles in this plight all along to his priſon, as it had beene a dungſacke or any carrion. The occaſion why the Inquiſitours dealt ſo extremely with him, was for anſwering them ſomwhat roundly and homely, without relenting or yeelding vnto them one iote. Howbeit, during the time of this ſtrait impriſonment, God vſed him as a meane to comfort and erect a certaine yong man called Morzilio, a Monke of the cloyſter of Saint Iſidore, laid in for profeſſing the goſpel openly, who by meanes of the Inquiſitours faire and flattering promiſes, had a little before relented and yeelded ſomwhat in religion. The which thing (no doubt) was the ordinance of God, that theſe two ſhould be matched together

in one priſon. For this Ferdinando, perceiuing the yong Nouice to faint in courage, rebuked him ſharply, accuſed him of cowardiſe before God, &amp; driuing him thereby to repentance, confirmed and ſtrengthned him at the length: So that within few daies Morzilio prayed to come to his anſwer, and before the Inquiſitors, then and there, ſolemnly renounced that recantation which he had lately made, deſiring that his former confeſſion might ſtand
                        •
                     , the which hee tooke to bee very Chriſtianlike▪ Yet was he ſtrangled at the very ſame time, and afterward burned: marry whether he died in Gods fauour or the Inquiſitors, that knoweth God alone. But to returne to Ferdinando. After ſentence was giuen, the Inquiſitours demanded of him, whether he were determined ſtill to cōtinue the ſame man, and to affirme the ſame hereſies. Whereunto hee anſwered them verie roundly and bluntly (after his faſhion) in the hearing of all the people that hee had vttered nothing but the very pure and perfect Goſpel, and the true belief of a Chriſtian man, and therefore was far from accounting them hereſies. Whereupon immediatly they tooke away from him a croſſe of wood which they had thruſt betwixt his ſingers &amp; the cord that bound his hands, and therewithall clapped a Barnacle vpon his tongue, which remained there vntill the fire had conſumed it, and thus was he burned quicke.
               
               
                  Iuliano Ferdinando.
                  IT is a wonderfull thing I aſſure you for a man to conſider, that in ſo wearyiſh a thing as this Iuliana was and ſo poore, that a man would think he had nothing left but skin and bone, there ſhould be ſo great courage and ſtoutneſſe of ſtomack: but that the holy Prophet ſaith, and daily experience beſides confirmeth, that God hath oftentimes choſen the weaklings of the world to confound the ſtrong and mighty. For this ſame Iuliano the little (as commonly

he was called for the ſmalneſſe of his ſtature) being in Germanie without all the Inquiſitours reach, and there conuerſant with many learned men, among whom hee came to the knowledge of true and perfect godlines, by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, rather then by any mans perſwaſion or counſell, tooke in hand a very waightie and a dangerous enterpriſe: to wit, the tranſporting into Spain of two great dryfattes full of Bibles printed in the Spaniſh tongue, ſuch was the feruencie of his zeale to publiſh and ſet abroad the light of the Goſpel in his owne countrey. In the which attempt and enterpriſe, there was a great cauſe of feare, as if hee had vndertaken to bring in cart-loades of Scorpians or other more venemous beaſts, the hypocrites had ſo ſtopped all ventes, and made a reſtraint in euerie port, becauſe no maner of light or vnderſtanding ſhould by any meanes come vnto them. Notwithſtanding all this, God vnder his mighty protection, and by his owne ſafeconduct, brought that holy burthen thither, and that which was moſt miraculous of all, ſo prouided, that it was both landed and diſcharged within the walls of Siuill: where were ſuch buſie ſearchers &amp; catchpols prying in euery corner, that a man might with a great deale more eaſe haue deceiued Argus for all his eyes, of the Cow which hee had in charge to keepe. The which dew of Gods grace ſent vnto them ſo ſeaſonably, that Paradiſe of the Lords did moſt ioyfully and thankfully receiue, wherby the fruit (no doubt) grew to ripeneſſe, and became more plentifull againſt the time of harueſt and reaping. For at the laſt this matter broke out, and came to the Inquiſitours knowledge: firſt by meanes of a fooliſh fellow, more fearfull a great deale than need was, and afterwards by an vnfaithfull brother, pretending to profeſſe the Goſpel, wherein he ſeemed to haue profited reaſonably well, but ſhortly after ſhewed himſelfe to be a Iudas, and a champion for the Inquiſition, cloking &amp; colouring his malicious purpoſe, with that counterfait pretence of religion, &amp;

by that meanes betraied the whole congregation. Then the Inquiſitors well noſed like the diuell, and finding a little, followed on ſo farre, till at the length they ſprung the whole couie, found the neaſt, tooke both young and old, and ſo made hauoke of all. And this was the firſt 
                        •
                     ouzing they had, which broke that holy heard, that was ſo great in number, that the hunters themſelues at the firſt were afraid of them, and the ſpoile of them ſuch afterwards, that they filled all their larders, &amp; were enforced further to ſeek for other cellers to beſtow them in, and to cauſe ſo many o
                     
                        •
                     ens to be heated, that they were almoſt quēched with the ſuet of the Deare. For there were taken at Siuill at that one time 800. &amp; 20. of them or thereabouts, roſted at one fire. Among the which, this Iuliano was one of the firſt that was apprehended and ſent to priſon, where he lay continually, ſolitarie and without any companie, laden with irons aboue 3. whole years. By means wherof, there were dayly, diuers and ſundry ſights to be ſeen. Howbeit the conſtancy of this man was ſo great and ſo wonderfull, that the tormenters themſelues, were ſooner wearied, than he vnpacient for all his torments; and notwithſtanding his weake and wearyiſh bodie, yet alwayes remained of ſufficient ſtrength in minde to abide all their tyrannie, inſomuch that hee neuer departed from the racke with worſe cheere or leſſe courage, then hee was of at his entrance: ſo that all their torments, all their theatnings, and all extreamitie which they could doe or practiſe vpon him, did not make him yeeld or ſhrinke one iote, but that returning from the racke, or rather drawne thence by other of his fellow-priſons, hee would ſignifie vnto them, how hee had conquered and confounded his enemies, ſinging on this ſort: Vencidos vanlos frayles, vencidos van: Corrulos van los lobos: Corridos van. As much to ſay in Engliſh as thus. The Monkes depart vanquiſhed, they depart vanquiſhed: the Wolues doe flye with ſhame, they flye with ſhame. But long before this time came, hee was much troubled in

the firſt dayes of hearing with the Monkes, and other ſuch maintainers of iniquitie as they are; by whom the Inquiſitours, being vtterly vnlearned themſelues, vſe to controle and ouerrule hereticks. From whom ſo oft as hee returned, he delighted alwayes to ſing that ſong, in token of triumph ouer his aduerſaries. And on the great and ſolemne day of their Doom, being brought out of his priſon into the Court of the Caſtle Triana, to be apparelled with ſuch trinkets as are appointed for perſons condemned (like as other of his companions were) the report is, that with a maruellous good courage and countenance hee began to exhort them in this wiſe. My brethren be of good cheere, this is the howre wherein we muſt be faithfull witneſſes to God and his truth before men, like as it becommeth the true ſeruants and ſouldiours of Chriſt, and within this little while wee ſhall haue him ready to witneſſe with vs againe, and ſhall within few howres triumph with him in Heauen for euer. But immediately, as hee was making this good and godly exhortation, the villaines ſet a Barnacle on his tongue, and ſo hee went to his execution. How beit ſtanding vpon the ſtep whereon they that are to be executed vſe to ſtand, being not able in words to vtter the courage &amp; conſtancie of his mind in the patient ſufferance of all theſe tormēts for the Goſpels ſake &amp; the profeſſion thereof, he expreſſed no leſſe in geſtures and behauiour. Firſt, kneeling downe, and kiſsing the ſtep whereon hee ſtood: and afterwards being tyed to the ſtake, and couered vp to the head and eares with fagots, did diuers and ſundry times ſhrinke his head into the middeſt of them, as one moſt willing to receiue his death, &amp; deſirous to haſten the ſame: whereby, like a good ſouldiour of Chriſt, hee did very well foreſee and prouide to haue his confeſsion notified, and the infirmitie and weakneſſe of his feeble brethren, if any ſuch there were among them, holpen and remedied, encouraging them by theſe ſignes and tokens which he gaue them, both ſtedfaſtly to ſtand to the

truth, and lightly to eſteeme of the puniſhment. There was alſo preſent with him at his death one D. Ferdin ando Rodriguio, a falſe Apoſtle, whoſe importunity being not able any thing to remoue him from his profeſſion, cauſed it to appeare in the eyes of men, ſo much the more glorious: who ſuppoſing that the terrors of death would ſomewhat haue diſmaied him, obtained leaue of the chiefe officer, that his tongue might be looſed, vpon hope that he would ſgnifie his conuerſion to the common people by word of mouth, Howbeit it fell out quite contrary. For immediatly after that his tongue was at liberty, this Iuliano made as plaine and ſolemne a proteſtation of his faith, as euer he did at any other time in all his life. As for his friend and acquaintance that gaue him ſo euil counſell ſpeaking flatly againſt his owne conſcience (as he knew full well) hee gaue him ſuch an 
                        •
                     tem, and ſo tooke him vp for ſtumbling, that the villain hauing not a word to anſwer him for very ſhame, to the end to be euen with him ſome other way, fell into this outery &amp; exclamation. O that Spain, the conquerer and dame ouer ſo many countries, ſhould be thus troubled with ſuch a caitife. Kill him, kill him. And I warrant you there were butchers enow ready to doe as hee bad them, and to giue him his deaths-wound. The rumor alſo was ſpred of this man, that he had likewiſe recanted during the time of his being in priſon: but God be thanked it fell out in the end far otherwiſe.
               
               
                  
                     Iohn de Leon a Monke of Saint Iſidors cloiſter.
                  THis man at the firſt was but a taylor in Mexico that famous Citie in the Weſt Indies, called Noua Hiſpania, &amp; at his returne thence to Siuill againe, felt in his conſcience (as many good men doe) a certaine 
                        •
                     ea
                        •
                     e of God, though blind and not proceeding of knowledge, whereby hee was moued to become a Monk. yet his hap was ſuch by Gods good meanes, who did ſo prouide for his deſperate

attempt, that he entred into Saint Iſidors cloiſter in Siuill, wherein the greater part of the couent at that time was well affected in religion. But after he bad been ſchooled there by the ſpace of two or three yeares, and conuerſant among them, hee began to bee wearie of this monkiſh and ſolitarie kinde of life, ſeeking meanes to forſake his order, as hee did indeede: colouring the matter with his continuall diſpoſition to ſickneſſe; and yet being once out, had ſuch a deſire to talke with his former ſchoolmaiſters, that had inſtructed him in the true and perfect religion, that hee returned thither againe, for conference ſake and for their companie. But all in vaine Form the time of his abſence, all they for whoſe reſpect hee entred into that ilfauored order once againe, had left their coules, and were fled into Germanie. Whereupon hee perceiuing that there was no place of aboad for him, determined to alter his purpoſe ſo ſoone as he could certainly learn what was become of his old companions, and whither they were gone. But here perhaps ſome euill diſpoſed perſons will call him a double Apoſtata in forſaking his order twice. Marry the wiſer ſort will giue him double honour therefore, and account him the godlier man two to one. Therefore trudging after his fellowes, and (as it were) tracing them, he met with them at the length at Franckford with much ado, both for the painfulneſſe of his iourney &amp; the perils of paſſage: &amp; from thence went with them to Geneua, to meet with the reſt of his acquaintance that were ſetled there. About the ſame time, by meanes of Queene Maries ſuddaine death, and that the crown of England deſcended vpon the moſt gracious Lady Queen Elizabeth, they of the Engliſh congregation, that by occaſion of the late tyrannie were diſperſed here and there in Germanie, were by Gods good grace called home againeinto their owne countrey: wherupon diuers Spaniards that ſoiorned at Geneua, thinking England a meeter place for their congregation, did accompanie the Engliſhmen,

that returned homewards into England, and for their more ſafety diuided themſelues into ſeuerall companies. For the Inquiſitours tooke the departure of the Monkes in ſo euill part, aſwell in reſpect of forſaking their order, as renouncing their religion, that albeit they were but few in number, yea but a handfull (to ſpeake of) in reſpect of the world, yet they determined to plague them ſoundly, if they could come by them: and thereupon ſent out their flies to lie in wait for them euery where as they ſhould paſſe, ſpecially at Colyne, Franckford, Antwerpe, &amp; all the high waies that lay from Geneua that way: &amp; in like caſe all the waies on the other ſide from Geneua to Millayne. The charges whereof were allowed out of the kinges treaſury largely enough, both of the kings owne liberality, and of the deſire which the Inquiſitours had to catch them. And God knowes much a do there was, ſparing neither for labor nor coſt to finde halfe a dozen dogges to do this feat, and to hunt them out: beſides other great priuiledges and immunities that were promiſed to ſuch as would vndertake to bring them againe. A ſtrange thing to conſider, how the Inquiſitours deteſt and abhorre the light of the Goſpell, that they perſecute it to the very death. This fellow therfore had gotten him a companion, one Iohn Ferdinando of Valladolit, a very godly man, &amp; purpoſing to paſſe together into England thorough Germany, were laid for at Argentyne, by meanes whereof they were dogged, and taken in a certaine port in Zealand, as they were taking ſhip to croſſe ouer into England. And being apprehended, this Iohn de Leon took the arreſt with ſo good a courage, that he neuer changed countenance at it, but ſo ſoone as the meſſengers had ſaid that their errant was to him, hee made them anſwer ſtraight way. Wel (quoth he) let vs go in Gods name, for hee (no doubt) will be with vs. Whereupon they were both brought back into the towne, and there racked moſt pit fully, to the entent to make them confeſſe of their other companions; and within a few daies after were ſhipped

and carried into Spaine: each of them, during the time that they were in the ſhip, hauing a certaine Iron chaine wrought like a net, that couered both head and face, within the which there was alſo another engine of iron made like to a mans tongue, wch being thruſt into their mouthes tooke away the vſe of their tongues. And in theſe continuall paines and torments, beſides other ginnes and fetters of iron wherewith they were bound both hand and foot, they were brought into Spaine, and there deliuered into the Inquiſitours priſons: Iohn de Leon to the Inquiſitours priſon at Siuill, and his fellow to Valladolit, where hee was afterwards in defence of Gods quarrell executed by fire quick: as was alſo one Doctour Cacalia a companion of his, but a little before him, whoſe brother or ſiſters daughter this man had maried. Howbeit Iohn de Leon remained a great while in priſon, where he taſted the Inquiſitors tyrannie, ſuffering both hunger and cold, as alſo endured all their torments each after the other: and at the laſt was brought forth in their ſolemne ſhew, arayed in like ſort as the other that had continued &amp; perſeuered as he had done. It was a pitifull thing to behold, and (no doubt) would haue made many a man afraid to ſee ſo griezly a ſight, and ſuch a ghoſt as hee was: his face ſo ouergrowne with haire, his bodie ſo leane as any rake, hauing nothing left to couer his bones ſaue onely the very skin; and to the encreaſe of his paine, their Barnacle was ſet vpon his tongue, that it was loathſome to ſee the long ſtreames of fleame come out of his ſtomack, &amp; hang roping from his mouth to the ground, as hee ſtood vpright. But when ſentence of death was pronounced vpon him, hauing then his tongue ſet at libertie, to the intent that he might abiure &amp; recant (as they ſuppoſed hee would haue done) hee made ſuch a confeſsion with ſuch a countenance, ſo quietly, without any apparant motion or affection; though in few words, yet ſo effectually, as if he had been in his beſt eſtate and moſt libertie that euer hee was in. At the very laſt

howre of his death, there was aſſigned vnto him a certain Monke to diſpute with him, one of the ſame cloyſter that he himſelfe had once been on, and whoſe nouice hee was the firſt yeare after that hee entred that vnlucky order, that hee might record vnto him the principles of his old poperie and ſuperſtition. Howbeit the more meanes that they vſed to aſſault him withall, the ſtronger he grew and the more able to reſiſt them: for Chriſt (doubtleſſe) like a good captaine defended his ſouldiour. In the end, he was executed as cruelly, as in his life time before hee had beene tormented miſerably, but with as quiet and patient minde as might be. For ſo it was alwaies likely that ſo good a man as he, ſhould make ſo good an end.
               
               
                  Franciſca Chaueſia.
                  TOwards the furniſhing of the ſame ſhew, there was alſo one Franciſca Chaueſia, a modeſt Virgine and one of a perfect profeſſion, a Nunne of the cloyſter of Saint Elizabeth. A wonderfull thing to conſider how the perfect knowledge of Chriſt could come to her through ſuch Iron doores and gates, notwithſtanding all the froward ſuperſtition wherein ſhee was almoſt drowned. But the election of God in his Son Chriſt is a matter of ſuch force and efficacie, that nothing can withſtand it at the time appointed. Beſides this, her happe was ſo good otherwiſe, to haue vnto her ſchoolmaiſter one D. Aegidio, of whom we haue to ſpeake hereafter. Truly the ſhining light of Gods Goſpel could not long time be hid vnder that buſhel, but when the time was come, it would appeare and ſhine to the ioy &amp; comfort of the whole Church of God, and to the aboliſhing of darkneſſe and iniquitie. Well, the concluſion was, that comming before the Inquiſitours, and entreated as others had been before her, at the length ſhee was brought out vnto the ſtage or ſcaffold: where ſhee (albeit that in all her

life time ſhee had had no great conference with men) yet many times by her manlike anſwers, did put the Inquiſitors to afoule foile: and did moreouer, not only moſt conſtantly affirme the truth, but alſo moſt ſharpely rebuked thoſe good Fathers, calling them dumbe Dogs and the generation of Vipers. But of all the reſt, the ſmall regard which ſhee had either of death or the paines thereof, and ſpecially the chearefull countenance which ſhee kept ſtill euen to the very fire, was moſt worthy the ſight of all that beheld it.
               
               
                  
                     Chriſtophoro Loſada a Phiſition.
                  THis man in like caſe was ſcholler to D. Aegidio, taught &amp; trained vp by him in the principles of true religion. Among whoſe other good gifts &amp; bleſſings of God, wherwithall hee was indued, this one thing was in him moſt worthy of admiration, that whomſoeuer hee took in hand to teach and inſtruct in vertue and godlines, he did therewithall kindle as it were a certaine ſeruent zeale in their harts, whereby they were enflamed to all the exerciſes of loue and charity both inwardly and outwardly; and beſides this, maruellouſly animated and encouraged to patience at the very houre of their deathes. Whereby hee gaue an euident teſtimony to ſuch as were enlightned with Gods ſpirite, that Chriſt was alwaies preſent with him to make perfect his miniſtery, writing with his holy Spirite in their harts inwardly the ſame in effect that he in words pronounced outwardly. But beſides the good hap that this man had to light vpon ſo good a ſchoolemaſter, it was alſo his chaunce to meete with no worſe a father in law, a man ſo zealous and well affected in Gods religion, that this Loſada being a ſuter to his daughter, although hee were a faire conditioned man, very well learned, and better ſeene in his faculty then a great ſort of practifers bee, yet would hee not graunt vnto him his good will for hauing his daughter to wife, till hee were for a while become ſcholler to Doctor Aegidio, and learned of him ſome godly and vertuous inſtructions. A very hard condition ſurely

for a learned man, and one that thought himſelfe ſufficiently cathechiſed, to ſubmit himſelfe to another mans inſtruction, but ſpecially to D. Aegidio, that was commonly ſuſpected in religion at that time. Howbeit at the length he condeſcended thereunto, whether for vertues ſake, as deſirous of better inſtruction, or for his wiues, I knowe not. But howſoeuer it were, or in what reſpect ſo euer hee did it at the firſt, he applied it ſo earneſtly, that notwithſtanding he loſt his maiſter ere he could well haue ſpared him, yet after his maiſters death he declared how much he had profited vnder him: in ſo much that aſwell for his ſingular learning and skill in Scripture, as for his vertuous and godly conuerſation, he was thought the happieſt and worthieſt perſon to bee Superintendent ouer the whole congregation, which was great in number, though here and there diſperſed in corners. As indeede he tooke it vpon him, and did very wel diſcharge the office of a preacher among them, ſo far as hee might in ſuch aduerſity. Afterwards by meanes of thoſe bookes of Iuliano paruo, hee was apprehended by the Inquiſitours (being a thing almoſt impoſſible that ſuch a faithfull paſtour ſhould hide himſelfe when his flocke was diſperſed) before whom hee made a plaine proteſtation of his faith, for the which hee endured, firſt, hard and ſharp impriſonment with moſt cruell torments, and the open infamie of their ſolemne ſhew, and laſtly was committed to the fire. Where he, ſtanding at the ſtake, diſputed very notably of true religion againſt thoſe importunate hypocrites, who vpon a falſe perſwaſion that they had to conuert him, gaue him the liberty of his tongue, to the intent he might haue anſwered their expectation. And whereas they of policy fell out of their Spaniſh into Latine, becauſe the common people ſhould not vnderſtand them, Loſada alſo (not greatly marking their meaning herein) began to talk in Latin ſo copiouſly and eloquently, that it was a ſtrange thing to heare a man almoſt dead to this world, to haue his wits ſo freſh

and his tongue ſo ready, as euer they were at any time in all his life.
               
               
                  Christophoro Arelliano.
                  
                     CHriſtophoro Arelliano, a Monke of the cloyſter of Saint Iſidore in Siuill, was by the confeſſion of the Inquiſitours themſelues ſimply the beſt learned of all that came before them, and was betraied by his owne friends, ſuch I meane, as had receiued a great deale more commoditie and honour by him, then euer they had done by any, yet by their meanes was brought within the Inquiſition. The cauſe why he was ſo highly eſteemed &amp; accompted of for learning, was becauſe of his great reading and ſtudy in the ſchoole-doctours, as they tearme them. That is to ſay, Aquinas, Scotus, Lombardus, and ſuch like, that whatſoeuer had eſcaped them in all their workes, making for the maintenance of the truth, with a very good iudgement and a paſſing memorie, next after the ſcriptures and the ſounder ſort of the fathers and doctours of the Church, hee did both readily vouch, and applied them to his purpoſe very directly, and ſo brought to paſſe, that all his aduerſaries, with whom the authoritie of ſuch trifling writers weigh more then the holy Scriptures of God, were confounded with their owne doctours. Notwithſtanding all this, hee was condemned to the fire. For with theſe maine tyrants fire and fagots is aboue learning and truth, and able to controll &amp; ouerrule them both. But ere he came ſo far, he was firſt brought ſolemnly, &amp; ſet vpon the ſcaffold to haue ſentence pronounced vpon him, where there was a ſhamefull matter moſt impudently laied to his charge; That hee ſhould affirm, that the bleſſed and pure virgin Mary, the mother of Chriſt, was no more a maid then hee himſelfe was. A ſeemly ſpeach for theſe good Fathers to publiſh and proclaime in ſuch an open audience, if it had beene ſo that any were ſo beaſtly or ſo wicked to ſay it. Yet ſuch meanes they vſe to bring them into hatred among the

common people, whom they know many men to haue good opinion and eſtimation of for their ſingular and approued vertue. Howbeit when Arelliano heard that horrible blaſphemie, hauing the vſe of his tongue (as GOD would haue it) he cried out in the hearing of all the people, that it was a moſt impudent and ſlanderous lie, ſaying, that as well at this preſent, as alſo at all other times heretofore, hee did euer firmely hold, and beleeue the contrary, being thereunto perſwaded by diuers and ſundry places of Scripture, which hee could preſently alledge if neede were. Alſo for a further vexation, there ſtoode of purpoſe one of the Monkes of the ſame houſe, that had beene his greateſt enemy, laughing and reioycing at his miſery, thinking it, belike, not ſufficient to cauſe ſo godly a man, ſo excellently well learned, and a very innocent beſides, to be brought into ſo pitifull a caſe, but to amend the matter withall, ſeemed to triumph ouer him in this extremity. The ſuddaine ſight whereof did ſomewhat moue this good man: howbeit like a good chriſtian hee put it vp quietly, and pacified himſelfe, giuing a good example of patience to all that beheld it. Finally, ſtanding at the very ſtake, he comforted and encouraged a certaine monke of the ſame houſe called Iohn Chryſoſtome, that ſometime had beene his ſcholler, and now become his fellow, and ſo partaker aſwell of his death as his doctrine. But foraſmuch as I certainly know not the very true cauſe why this Monke was executed, I haue therfore not annexed him here vnto the reſt. Yet thus much I can truely ſay of him: A preacher he was, both reaſonably well learned and of good conuerſation and liuing, for any thing that euer was obiected to the contrary. And therefore thoſe hogs that minded nothing but their bellies, did not greatly like of him.
               
               
                  
                     Garſias Arias commonly called Seignior Blanco.
                  
                  THe wonderfull prouidence of God toward his elect, which contrary to common courſe doth mightily ſaue &amp; defend many that deepely were drowned, and lay a

long ſeaſon ſouſed in ſuperſtition and blindneſſe, fanſying it of will, and withſtanding the known truth againſt their owne conſcences (wch ſin the holy Scriptures call the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, declaring vnto vs, that the prayers of the congregation ſhall not auaile ſuch perſons as are ſpotted therewith) this prouidence, I ſay, did moſt maruellouſly appear by this one mans example to be of ſuch force, that the deeper that men are drowned in deſperation, the higher it afterwards aduanceth them in honour. This Arias, whom they commonly called Seignior Blanco, becauſe of his white haires and faire skin, had a very ſharp wit, and for his time was well ſtudied in diuinity: marry, therewithall ſomewhat crafty and ſubtile with a little ſpice of inconſtancy: which vices alſo hee did ſo couer with a counterfait cloke of religion, that he was able to deceiue him that thought himſelfe the wiſeſt man, yea, and did deceiue a great ſort indeed. It hapned in this time that there were two ſorts of Preachers in Siuill, and both of them had a great number of auditours diſpoſed to heare each part, as they beſt fancied the one or the other. The one of them concerning doctrin &amp; precepts, came nigher to the diſciplin of Epictetus the Stoick, than to the rule of holy Scripture. But herein they were inferiour to Epictetus, that all his ſayings and doings were one, but in theſe there was ſome ods: for they neuer ceaſed calling and crying vpon them, to moue them to often faſting, to mortification, to denying of themſelues, to continue in prayer at all times, lowly to thinke of themſelues, which they called humilitie, and to ſhew the ſame as well in apparell, countenance, behauiour and ſpeech, as in all the reſt of their life. But if you had ſtripped theſe fellows out of their ſide coats; Wel, I will not ſay all, but ye ſhould wel haue perceiued them to be men. In ſum, all their religion both top &amp; taile (as they ſay) reſted in works and outward exerciſes of the bodie, quite contrary to the other ſect, and therefore they would ſeem to be doers in any caſe. Wherupon they left the true

exerciſes of a Chriſtian man, I meane iuſtice, mercy, and faith, the only meanes to attaine true righteouſneſſe, and ranne by heapes to Maſſes, to hallowed places, to ſhrift (as they call it) &amp; many other ſuch like toyes, which the ſcripture calleth ſpiders webs that will neuer proue good cloth, hoping by theſe &amp; ſuch like meanes to be purged and clenſed from their ſinnes. Moreouer they vrged pouerty, with ſole and ſingle life, euen vnto ſuch as were already coupled in matrimony, but eſpecially the vow of obedience, as do the fooliſh friers, to the intent to get them auditours. And this (ſay they) is the true denying of our ſelues, and therefore extolled it as much as the obedience that is due to God himſelfe. Further, to the entent to keepe them in blindnes and ignorance ſtill, they diſſwaded men from the reading of books written of diuinity; ſpecially from Eraſmus works, by the which they ſhould learne nothing but a little pride in their owne knowledge, referring them rather to Henricus Herpius, and Bonauentures works, the A. B. C. and the ſcaling of mount Sion, and ſuch others, wherein they ſhould learne humility and obedience towards all, but ſpecially towards their elders and ſuperiours. Among others they alſo cited vnto them Maſius, Cauallius, Guerra, Petrus Cordubenſis, and many other moe then I can well call to mind: For whom perhaps it had beene farre better neuer to haue beene borne, then to leaue ſuch monuments behind them. Of the which ſort of preachers there were diuers, I confeſſe, in ſome reſpects very honeſt and godly men, but yet none, that vnderſtanding the iuggling and treacheries of their maiſters, would forſake them, and take a better way. For ſundry of them by their vnſeaſonable kind of faſting, and their curious ſearching of high and ſecret myſteries of diuinity, fell into a phrenſie, or elſe proceeding in their fooliſh enterpriſe, grew euery day worſe &amp; worſe, that is to ſay, of honeſt men, became very wicked, Phariſes, enemies and crucifiers of Chriſt, and in the ende twiſe ſo euill as were their maiſters whom they followed.

The other ſort did deale more ſincerely with the holy Scriptures, declaring out of them what was true righteouſneſſe and perfect godlineſſe: by meanes whereof they brought to paſſe, that that Citie bare the name aboue all other in Spain for their iuſt and true dealing, by the ſpace of a dozen yeares together, ſo that itappeared that they had fruitfully and effectually heard that peece of Scripture that treateth of true and perfect righteouſneſſe. For herevpon came all that plentifull harueſt that hath been inning 8. or 10. yeares, of thoſe good ſeedes of the Goſpel, which then were by them ſo painfully ſowen. The brightneſſe whereof, according to the nature of light, did ſo plainly diſcouer all that counterfait holineſſe, and phariſaicall deuotion, that it could not be but that needs there muſt enſue thereafter, firſt hatred and then perſecution. The chief, labourers in this harueſt, were Conſtantino, Aegidio and Varquio, Doctors all, and men both ſober, wiſe, and learned: whoſe trauailes in ſetting forward the Goſpel in ſo great miſts of ignorance, and the worthie ends which they made at their departures out of this life, as they be worthie of eternall memorie, ſo will wee ſhield them that they ſhall not be forgotten. But yet of all the other aduerſaries vnto the truth, this Arias was moſt ſpitefull, and more malicious than any of the reſt (perhaps becauſe the other erred of ſimple ignorance, but he contrary to his owne conſcience kicked againſt the knowne truth) for that the other had been more generally receiued, was more ſightly in ſhew, and more beneficiall to them that followed after it. Howbeit he would not gloze ſo openly as other of the ſame ſort would, for feare of diſcrediting himſelfe with diuers men of good reputation, and well affected in religion, with whom he was grown into ſome fauour &amp; good opinion, by reaſon of that vertuous and godly diſpoſition, which they ſaw in him in apparance: but in ſuch ſort behaued himſelfe, and ſo cunningly conueyed his matters, that though ſuch as had tryed him knew what was in him,

yet others tooke him for a deare friend of theirs, and eſteemed of him as if he had bin their kinſman or brother. But as touching his ſubtilties and diſſimulation, he ſhewed it moſt at one time ſpecially aboue all others, at what time complaint was made to the Inquiſitours by a ſort of hypocrites, perſecutors of the truth, of one Gregorio Ruizio, a man (as the report went of him) very well learned, for a certaine thing vttered by him openly in a diuinitie lecture in the Cathedrall Church of Siuill, tending towards the controuerſies in religion, and concerning ſpecially a mans iuſtification. For where the Inquiſitors had aſſigned him a day of hearing, two dayes before the day of his apparance, it was his chance to meete with this maiſter Arias; with whom hee had ſome a
                        •
                     quaintance, by reaſon that they profeſſed one kinde of ſtudie, but chiefly for the report of vertue that was ſpoken of him, though vnworthily. Whereupon, amongſt others that were aſſigned, this Arias alſo was charged to be there at that day, and to prepare himſelf to diſpute againſt Ruizio: who like a crafty Apoſtle ſo vndermined this Ruizio, that he gat out of him all the reaſons and arguments wch he had deuiſed againſt the day of diſputation for the maintenance of his ſide. For Ruizio (God knows) taking no great heed therof, nor ſuſpecting in him any ſuch trechery, more than he did his ghoſtly father, communicated the ſame vnto him. Which after Arias had obtained, he gaue him a friendly farwell, and ſo left him. At the day of diſputation, when both parts were aſſembled, this Arias was alſo preſent, &amp; ioined himſelf to the other ſide that were aduerſaries to Ruizio. The which when Ruizio beheld, he was ſomewhat aſtonied therewithall, and perceiued at the length his Legerdemane, ſeeing him ſo readily out off his arguments, which hee had made him priuie vnto two dayes before, and to anſwer them ſo fully and exactly, that hee had nothing to replie againe: whereupon the ſilly ſoule being thus circumuented, and ſpoiled of all his weapons, yeelded himſelfe,

leauing to Arias the honour of the field, which hee moſt like a Iudas had gotten by treaſon and treachery. The like honeſt part alſo for all the world he plaid with D. Aegidio. For whereas hee meaning nothing but well (as the moſt conſtant bruit is) had referred the matter concerning the opinion of his knowledge and learning to this mans iudgement, becauſe he knew him to be as able to iudge as a great ſort of others, he gaue ſuch a verdit, as it had been ſomewhat reaſonable for him to haue giuen in a matter of vntruth. Notwithſtanding he was the firſt in all Saint Iſidors houſe in Siuill, that ſtarted out of that dead ſleep of ſuperſtition and ignorance, wherein they were all dead and drowned, and by meanes of a few ſparkes which this man had ſet on fire, a great part of the houſe beganne to ſhake off their drowſineſſe, and to ſee a glimmering of the truth afarre off appeare like the dawning of the day, and to deſire that the vaile might bee drawne, to the end that they might the more eaſily ſee the ſhining beames of true religion. For the whole ſcope of all his ſermons, for the which there was a ſpace appointed, as it fell out moſt conueniently, ſometime by night, from two of the clocke in the morning, till foure, was wholly to ouerthrow all their profeſſion: howbeit not openly, but couertly and as it were afarre off. Firſt, hee taught them that ſinging and ſaying of their prayers all the day and night, was no ſeruice, nor praier vnto God: that the exerciſes of a true Chriſtian man were other then the common people took them to bee: that the holy Scriptures were to bee reade and ſtudied with diligence, whence alone the true knowledge and ſeruice of God and of his holy will, of true religion, and ſuch as was moſt allowable in his ſight, was to bee had and learned: to the obtaining whereof, we muſt (quoth he) vſe praier as a mean, proceeding as well of the ſenſe and feeling of our owne infirmities and neceſſities, as grounded vpon perfect truſt &amp; confidence in God. Thus, by laying theſe and ſuch like foundations of Chriſtian religion,

he made them to loath that ſtale ſtuffe of their old &amp; forworn religion, &amp; wrought in them an earneſt deſire of the better, but ſpecially moued thē to the ſtudy of holy Scriptures. Moreouer, beſides his ſermons hee read dayly a lecture vpon Salomons prouerbs very learnedly, &amp; made application thereof with good iudgement and diſcretion, and had priuate and familiar conference with diuers, ſuch as he was dayly conuerſant withall, and vſed to accompany, onely to the ſame end and purpoſe. And for this one thing his hap was alwaies very good, to haue ſuch ſchollers as were tractable and ſoone wrought, and (which was wonderfull to conſider) ſuch as were not greatly wedded to their monkiſh ſuperſtitions though they were vowed: whereby he had leſſe to doe with them, and might with more eaſe giue the aſſault, and in ſhort time batter downe this forced rampire of ſuperſtition, with the perfect ſhot of Gods word. Howbeit his head was ſo full of toyes and new deuices, that after all theſe wholeſome preparatiues, wherwith he had ſo wrought in them, that the reſt of their ſuperſtitious dregs might more cōmodiouſly be expelled, &amp; that they were halfe wonne to his doctrine, he made them fall to vnſeaſonable faſtings and watchings before the Sacrament, whence they ſhould looke for I know not what inſpirations: hee cauſed them to remoue all their ſtuffe, bookes and beds, out of their celles, and to lye vpon the bare earth, or elſe to ſleep ſtanding, to weare a hairecloth in ſtead of their ſhirts, and a hoope of Iron next vnto their skin, with a number of ſuch toyes moe, as though thoſe ſtinking weeds would not haue taken root faſt enough of themſelues, except the earth had firſt been cared vp with the coulter of Gods word, as was before declared. For after hee had weeded the old ſuperſtition, he did nothing elſe but ſow a like ſeede againe, more corrupt and perilous than the other that grew before. By meanes whereof manie of his auditours got ſuch good as is like to enſue of ſo dangerous a doctrine. Inſomuch that mamany

of them fell ſtark mad: ſome ſo conſumed with melencholy, that they were halfe frantick: ſome caught vncurable diſeaſes and paines in the head, and became almoſt brainleſſe, that they were not able to ſerue any turne thereafter: but they that had ſtronger bodies, and better ſtomackes to beare it out withall, had ſuch a phariſaicall pride and glory in themſelues by meanes of that vaine perſwaſion of holineſſe and perfectneſſe, that no wiſe man will account them in much better caſe than other of their fellowes. And yet perhaps were Arias excuſable herein from this ſo grieuous guilt, either for want of better knowledge, or by deſtiny if it were ſo, firſt to take vpon him that office, &amp; then ſo meanly to execute it, but that I am right wel aſſured that his conſcience did condemn all the traſh, wch he had planted in place of truth. For at the very ſame time being among his companions, would take pleaſure in remembring the folly of ſuch men, that were ſo forward to run any way that he would preſcribe and appoint them. Notwithſtanding ſuch is the force and might of Gods election, that theſe few good ſeedes ſowne among thoſe fitches, fructified in the end to the great encreaſe of godlines maruellouſly. Inſomuch, that diuers and ſundry of them, hauing their conſciences cleared &amp; purged of their old hypocriſie, and ſcarcely well ſtaied or quieted with theſe new deuices, ſought further by occaſion hereof, for ſome better inſtructions, and vnawares hapned vpon the other ſort of Preachers, that taught the truth with more ſinceritie. Of whom (after they had entred ſome acquaintance with them) they learned the principles of pure and perfect religion, leauing by little and little that euill opinion which they had generally conceiued againſt the Lutherans. Afterwards, being perſwaded that they could by no meanes attaine the perfect knowledge of the truth, except they would ſometime peruſe their writings, God did likewiſe maruellouſly prouide for them herein, that they had not onely ſuch bookes brought vnto them by a

miraculous means, as they had a long time deſired, euen at ſuch time as they ſecurely ſlept and ſought for no ſuch things: but alſo all other ſorts of books that were extant at that time, either in Geneua, or any part of Germany: ſo that hauing ſuch ſtore both of bookes and maiſters to inſtruct them, they began to noſell their whole couent, inſomuch that where at the firſt there were onely two that durſt giue the attempt in ſo dangerous an enterpriſe, there were very few in the whole cloyſter (which at that time was very well furniſhed) but they had ſome taſte of true religion &amp; godlineſſe thereby, and none repined againſt it. Their time that erſt was ſpent in mumbling their mattens and prime, was now beſtowed vpon lectures of diuinity: their dirges eyther cut off altogether, or curtalled very ſhort: their charters of pardons granted by Popes in ancient time whereunto all that crue leaned before, was now accounted for ſtale ſtuffe. As for images, they had a ſmall deale of worſhip done vnto them, or none at all. Vaine faſting was turned into ſeemely ſobrietie: neyther was anie taught to bee monkiſh, but to bee ſincerely and truly religious, nor anie mention made of proceeding in their former faſhions, but much talke rather in deriſion thereof, and to haue them aboliſhed. Neyther did they put this light vnder a buſhell, impriſoning it within their owne walles, but ſent it abroad into the Citie, and the townes and villages adioining, as well by publiſhing of bookes, as by other priuate conference. Then all things being brought to ſo good paſſe, that nothing was left in vſe ſaue onely their ſtout Idoll of their maſſe, and their monkiſh profeſſion that reſted in their coule and their crowne, which could neyther with good conſcience bee longer ſuffred, nor attempted without preſent perill, and yet no great good like to enſue thereof; they beganne to deuiſe firſt, and afterwards determined with themſelues, to forſake their neaſt, and to flye into Germaine, where they might liue with a great deale more ſafetie of

their liues and freedome of their conſciences. A very bold enterpriſe (doubtleſſe) and as ſome thought both raſh and deſperate. For neither was there any great poſſibilitie or likelyhood, that not one or two, but ſo many at once, and ſuch as were not onely the ſoueraignes of the whole houſe and fellowſhip, but famous ouer the whole citie for their excellent learning, ſhould forſake ſuch a cloiſter as the like was not in all the territory of Granata, leauing it in a maner deſolate, and eſcape in ſafety from the furtheſt part of Spaine into Germanie. And if they ſhould ſteale away in ſeuerall companies and at ſundry times, then were they like to be in euill caſe that ſhould tarry hindmoſt. For the Inquiſitors that had been quiet a great while, hauing intelligence hereof by ſome cankred knaue or other, would beſtirre themſelues of all hands. Therefore they concluded briefly, that either all which were priuie to this counſell, muſt depart ſpeedily together, or elſe looke to be apprehended ſhortly after. But God ſeeing them in this diſtreſſe, ſhewed them a meanes, how vnder an honeſt pretence a dozen of them might take occaſion to depart within one moneth, and each betake himſelfe a ſeuerall way towards Geneua, where they determined to make their aboad, &amp; purpoſed to meet all together within one tweluemoneth: as for the reſt being as yet but young nonices in religion, which remained behind becauſe they did not greatly like of going away, they within a while after aboad the brunt of the hurly-burly when it came. For at the very ſame time there were three burned out of that cloiſter, and diuers of the reſt diuerſly puniſhed. Inſomuch, that from that day till this, there was neuer any examination of matters touching faith in Siuill, but that houſe hath alwaies made out a man, or two. And very likely it is, that the truth ſowen and planted there hath taken ſo deep root, that it ſticketh to the hard ſtone walls, ſo that whileſt any one ſtone ſtandeth vpon another, it will yearely yeeld them one or two Lutherans.
                  
                     
I haue by occaſion entred into this diſcourſe ſomewhat largely, partly in reſpect of Chriſt's Church, towards the which I ſhould ſcarce behaue my ſelfe vprightly, if I ſhould rob theſe men of their renowne due vnto them, in regard of the ouerthrow which they haue giuen to Idolatry and ſuperſtition, behauing themſelues as couragiouſly as they aduentured dangerouſly, preferring vertue and godlineſſe before authoritie and power, voluntarily refuſing their preſent eſtates wherein they liued with ſome worſhip and in much pleaſure, and inſtead thereof contenting themſelues to be poor and diſdained, baniſhed from their owne countrey, to ſuffer ſhame and ignominy: finally, to be euery howre in danger of their liues, which they led notwithſtanding in very great miſery. Of the which good and proſperous ſucceſſe, a great part next vnto God wee doe owe vnto this Arias, of whom our purpoſe is preſently to entreat, foraſmuch as all this great fire, that hath enflamed to Gods glory, not onely that houſe, but diuers places in the citie abroad, beſides a number of other without the citie which we meane not to touch, bred of thoſe few ſparks which this man kindled at the firſt: who by reaſon of his vnconſtant and fickle nature, being halfe ſuſpected of his friends, and hated of ſtrangers, was diuers and ſundry times complained vpon to the Inquiſitors, conuented before them, anſwered the matter, and ſo diſcharged. At the laſt it came to paſle, in that troubleſome time wherein euery man almoſt was apprehended for religion, that Arias alſo went to the pot with his fellowes indeed, though hee had diuers times ſhifted it off before. The which end was foretold him two or three yeares before by Conſtantino, and that with a vehement affirmation, on a time when Conſtantino bad this Arias to his houſe to dinner, where were preſent at the ſame time Aegidio and Varquio, to the intent to take him vp ſomewhat roundly for his halting, foraſmuch as gentle admonitions vſed before would nothing preuaile. But in proceſſe of talke when they were rebuking

him moſt earneſtly, he ſtart out in a brauery and ſaid, that he feared greatly leſt hee ſhould ſhortly ſee Bulles ſet forth in open ſhew, prophecying ſomewhat plainly of the Inquiſitours Theatre. Whereunto Conſtantine made him this anſwer: Behold Arias, before God I tell it thee, that thou ſhalt not ſit mounted aloſt, as thou ſuppoſed to ſee and behold othes, but ſhalt ſtand below, and bee condemned thy ſelfe. As indeed it came to paſſe by Gods ſecret and diuine prouidence, that notwithſtanding he had been in time before a faithleſſe fellow, yet his laſt apprehenſion turned not to his vndoing, but wrought in him effectually, and contrary to hope brought forth in him the fruites of of true repentance. For hee did ſo earneſtly and deepely lament and bewaile his former eſtate, that whereas before time, he had been as fearfull as euer was Hare of Hounds, or Ape of whip, now being vpon the racke with a maruellous conſtancy (which argued in him a wonderfull exchange) hee withſtood the enemies of Gods truth, and took vp the Inquiſitors ſharply, that ſat in their ſeats of maieſtie like Demigods, ſaying that they were meeter to driue packs, &amp; that ſuch an office were more ſit for them, than to ſit where they doe in ſeat of iudgement, and take vpon them the determination of cauſes in religion, wherin they were as blind &amp; yet as bold as Bayard; declaring moreouer vnto them, that for his own part he was heartily ſorry, and did moſt earneſtly repent him, and would doe while he had a day to liue, for that hee had wittingly and willingly in their preſence impugned the truth againſt the godly defendants of the ſame, whereof hee himſelfe was now become a defender. Many other ſharp rebukes, ſo oft as he came to his anſwer, the Inquiſitours receiued at his hands. But in the end hee was brought forth after their guiſe and accuſtomed maner of pomp, arayed with all their robes, honorable (no doubt) in the ſight of God, though in mans iudgement reproachfull and ignominious: a man, to bee reuerenced for hisage, but ſpecially for the hartie repentance

of his former life, &amp; for that notable confeſſion of the truth which he made, leaning vpon his ſtaffe: &amp; ſo departing from the ſtage to the ſtake with a merry and cheerfull countenance, he made ſatisfaction to the Church of God by this notable example of repentance at his death, for all the miſchiefe that he had done thereto by his vnfaithfull and hypocriticall dealing in the reſt of his life time before. O man moſt happy of all other, worthy to be ſhrined, and to haue a ſeuerall place among the chiefe champions of Gods truth heer in this world, that haſt forſaken the greateſt miſchiefe and folly, and returned to make the like proteſtation of Gods truth that other martyrs and confeſſors haue done before thee: Paul, that choſen and elect veſſell of God, placeth himſelfe among the firſt ſort of ſinners, becauſe 1. Tim. 1. he had bin a perſecuter of the Church of God, tho of a good zeale, yet not grounded vpon knowledge. In what place then or degree ſhall we ſet this Arias of ours among the ſinfull ſort, who wittingly and willingly, ſecretly not openly, behaued himſelfe like an enemie, and perſecuted the ſame? Paul referreth it to the ſecret purpoſe of almighty God, that he might obtain the more mercy, wherof he had made himſelfe vnworthy ſo many wayes, ſaying it was to this end, that Chriſt in him might powre out all the aboundance of his mercie and graces, for an example to all them that ſhould truely beleeue in him. How much then and how plentifully hath Chriſt opened his coffers, and beſtowed his mercies (the treaſures of his goodneſſe) vpon this new Paul, if we may ſo tearm him? How ſure and certaine a token doth hee giue hereby, of his exceeding great mercie, grace, and loue towards all ſinners? Therefore by this one example, this leſſon may we learne, as by the true mirrour of Gods goodneſſe, to keepe our ſelues from raſh iudgements and ſpeeches towards ſuch as wee ſee in the moſt deſperate eſtate that can bee, foraſmuch as wee cannot certainely tell what God hath determined concerning them, but ought rather to follow

the counſell of Paul, that is, to hope the beſt.
               
               
                  
                     D. Iohn Aegidio a Canon and Preacher in the Cathedrall Church in Siuill.
                  THis Doctour Aegidio, albeit he was a man both apt to attaine learning and painfull beſides, yet hauing beſtowed his time in vnprofitable ſtudies, notwithſtanding that he had runne his full race, and attained the higheſt degrees in Schooles, and profeſſed diuinitie a long time, (ſuch was the ſtate of learning in thoſe dayes) that he had ſcarcely his Latin tongue. Beſides this his ſmall skill either in the tongues or in any other good learning, he was a wicked contemner and blaſphemer againſt the holy Scriptures: Yea I haue heard himſelf be waile the euill ſucceſſe of learning &amp; ſtudie in his time, &amp; the ignorance of that age, confeſſing it to be ſuch, that whoſoeuer had any wayes medled with the holy Scriptures in the Vniuerſitie of Alcala, where he himſelfe ſtudied, was ſo farre off from being accounted of among the learned, that many would ſcornfully and in great deriſion tearm him a good Bibler, preferring L
                           •
                        mbardus, Scotus, Gregorius, Arithmeticus, and ſuch other Dunſes, before the expreſſe word of God, for profoundneſſe of wiſdome or deep diuinitie. Afterwards being publike Reader of diuinitie at Siguenca, he was ſent for to Siuill, by one Alexander that was his predeceſſor there, to the intent he might be their Preacher in the Cathedrall Church in Siuill: where he was ſo highly commended, both for his vertue and learning, that he was Subdeane of the Church, contrary to their orders, hauing neuer beene examined by the Doctours, as the cuſtome is. And truely for ſuch ſchool-diuinitie, as was generally and vniuerſally receiued all Chriſtendome ouer, he was very famous, and of great credite, marry, hee neuer attempted to preach openly, nor had once opened the Bible, to read or ſtudy the Scriptures. And therefore the very firſt time that he came

into the Pulpit, contrary to all mens expectations, he was found altogether ſo vnfit for ſuch a function, that he began to be greatly out of conceit with himſelfe, and to grow in contempt of others: by the daily encreaſe whereof on both parts, they fell ſo to repent them, the one for admitting him ſo vnaduiſedly, the other for taking vpon him that office ſo arrogantly, being vnable to diſcharge it, that both they minded to remoue him, and he himſelfe determined to leaue them. But in proceſſe of time, after hee had thus paſſed the pikes by the ſpace of a yeare or two, it was his chance to meet with one that gaue him ſuch inſtructions (or rather it was the ordinance of God, that prouided ſo well, both for him &amp; for the whole citie) that within few howres conference, he learned by that parties meanes the readie way for a Preacher to trauaile in, and what the office and dutie of a Preacher was: to the obtaining whereof it was told him, that he muſt vſe other meanes, other bookes, and other maiſters, then hitherto he had done. Whereat D. Aegidio was ſomewhat aſtonied at the firſt, hearing him make ſuch a ſermon vnto him, but eſpecially maruelled to ſee his boldneſſe, that being but a plaine fellow, and as a man would ſay a very Ruſſetcoat, beſides that, one taken not to be very wel in his wits, would preſume ſo boldly to teach ſuch a Doctour as hee was, being neither familiarly acquainted with him, nor knowing him to his thinking. Yet D. Aegidio being of a gentle diſpoſition by nature, and hearing him diſcourſe ſo largely of the dutie of a Preacher, wherein hee acknowledged his owne infirmitie, did the more eaſily bridle himſelfe, and gaue him the hearing quietly. The force of whoſe perſwaſions (being a man indued with Gods ſpirit) was ſo great, that from that day forward D. Aegidio was quite altered and become a new man, thinking all his former life and labour euill ſpent, and therefore beganne anew to tread another path which ſhould lead him vnto perfect wiſedome and learning, whereof as then hee knew

not one ſtep. Furthermore, perceiuing his counſeller to ſtand ſo long vpon that point which concerned the dutie of a good Preacher, he took it to be a ſufficient calling for him to that vocation, whereof he knew he ſhould neither reap commoditie nor eſtimation in this world. Perhaps many will maruell to hear the party named that was the occaſion of ſo ſuddaine a change and alteration of ſuch a man in ſo ſhort ſpace, taking vpon him to teach him the true way to perfect wiſedome. Truly I muſt needs diſcloſe it, to the end that the wonderful myſteries of Gods election may be manifeſted and reuerenced, who by the fooliſh of this world confoundeth the wiſedome of man. His name was Roderico Valerio, man long ago condemned at Siuill by the Inquiſitors for a falſe Apoſtle, a counterfait Prophet, and a wicked deceiuer of the people, and therevpon baniſhed, and in his exile ſuffred for the profeſſion of the truth. Whoſe wonderfull kind of calling to the true knowledge of Chriſt, ſince I am occaſioned to make mention of the perſon, it ſhall neither be greatly impertinent briefly to ſpeak of, nor tedious to ſuch as be godly diſpoſed. This Valerio (a Citizen of Nebriſſa, a famous towne as any is in all the precinct of Granata, both for the antiquitie thereof, and chiefly for the fame of one Antonio de Nebriſſa a notable Clerke as any was, and one that firſt reſtored the puritie of the Latin tongue in Spaine in theſe our dayes) was deſcended of a good houſe, and of ſufficient abilitie to maintaine the worſhip thereof: howbeit he employed his wealth, not to vertue, but as commonly ſuch men of abilitie doe, which think all their honor to conſiſt in the maintenance of a good ſtable, &amp; the furniture thereof, in games, in coſtly and exceſſiue apparell, in hunting, &amp; other ſuch like paſtimes and exerciſes. For in all theſe qualities he was ſingular aboue all the yong gentlemen of the whole citie: inſomuch that hee ſought not only to match ſuch as were his equalls in degree and abilitie, but alſo to exceede them far. In the middeſt of theſe vain phantaſies,

a certaine motion came into his mind (by what occaſion, or through whoſe perſwaſion, or otherwiſe by what meanes, God knoweth) but he ſuddenly left all his old delights, contemning the ſpeech of the people (which was a hard thing for a man to doe) and bent himſelfe wholly both body and ſoule to the exerciſe of vertue &amp; godlineſſe, that a man would ſearcely iudge him to bee a man of this world. Moreouer, the wonderfull change that appeared to be in him otherwiſe, as well in his ſpeech and behauiour, as in his apparell that was fine and ſutable before, gorgious as might be, and now quite altered into ſimple ſtuffe and plaineſt faſhion, was well liked of ſome, but on the other ſide a great number thought it meere madneſſe or ſtarke folly. But as the like falſe verdites giuen of the holy Apoſtles, that were indued with the Holy Ghoſt, were attainted by the effectes of the ſame ſpirit, ſo the perfect feare of God, with the bewayling of his former vanities, the earneſt deſire of righteouſneſſe, and his whole talke tending to theſe ends and concerning theſe matters, alwayes framed according to the preſcript rule of Gods word, was a ſufficient proofe and euidence to men of perfecter vnderſtanding, that the ſpirit of God moſt certainly poſſeſſed him. In his youth time hee had gotten a little ſmack in the Latin, by the help where of hee was conuerſant in the holy Scriptures both day and night: ſo that by continuall ſtudie thereof, hee had a great part of them by heart, and could make application thereof to his purpoſe ſenſibly &amp; maruellous readily. He had alſo dayly conflicts with the ſpiritual men (as they call them) the Prieſts and Monks, which were the cauſes (ſaid he) that not only the eſtate of the Clergy, but alſo all Chriſtendome was ſo fouly corrupted, that they were almoſt hopeleſſe of remedy: for which cauſes hee did alſo diuers and ſundry times ſharply rebuke them. Whereat this phariſaicall generation much maruelling, enquired of him how he attained ſo ſuddenly to all this skilin holy Scriptures? how he durſt preſume ſo

arrogantly to inuay againſt the very ſupporters and lights of the Church? For indeed he ſpared none, but would tell the proudeſt of them his minde, being but a lay-man voide of all good learning, and one that had ſpent the greater part of his time in vaine and vnprofitable ſtudies. Likewiſe they examined him, by force of what commiſſion hee did it: who ſent him: how hee was called: and by what tokens hee declared the ſame. Alas for them good men, when they cannot denie their abominations, nor longer hold out the light which diſcouereth their darkneſſe, euen now as in all other ages from time to time, they are driuen to theſe ſhifts. Howbeit Valerio anſwered them truly and with a bold courage to euery demand: that he had not fiſhed for that wiſedome, and caught it in their moſt filthie puddles, and muddie ditches, but had it by the only goodneſſe of the Holy Ghoſt, who poureth whole floods of grace into the hearts of true beleeuers moſt aboundantly. As for his boldneſſe, he told them, that both the goodnes of his quarrell, and hee that ſent him gaue him the encouragement, and that the ſpirit of God which is bound to no eſtate or degree, be it in name neuer ſo ſpirituall, ſpecially if it be corrupt, hath heretofore choſen very idiots, and fiſhermen, and placed them in the roome of Apoſtles, to controll the Synagogue of the learned touching the law, to appeach them of ignorance, &amp; to call the whole world to the knowledge of their own ſaluation: &amp; that the ſame Chriſt had ſent him, whoſe name and authoritie hee had for his warrant: but as for any ſigne to declare the ſame, he ſaid it was the token of a baſtardly generation, and of the branches degenerate from the true ſtocke of the children of God, to aske for any ſignes in the time of ſuch light, when all things ſhine therewith, yea verie darkneſſe it ſelfe as cleare as noone day. At the length, for theſe, and ſuch like matters he was called to his anſwer before the Inquiſitors, where he diſputed very earneſtly of the true Church of Chriſt, and which were the markes to

know it by, how man was iuſtified in the ſight of God, and of ſuch other points of religion: the knowledge whereof, he confeſſed that he had attained vnto by no meanes or help of man, but by the onely handy worke of God, and his wonderfull reuelation. Howbeit his madneſſe &amp; phrenſie, wherewith the Inquiſitors ſuppoſed him to bee troubled, excuſed him for this time: yet to the end that he might the ſooner come to himſelf again, they condemned him in the loſſe of all his ſubſtance, &amp; ſent him packing as poor as Iob: but he neuer repented himſelfe thereof, or became other man; inſomuch that within a yeare or 2. after he was ſent for againe about the ſame matters, &amp; then driuen to make recantation: marry, in conſideration that they tooke him to be lunatick ſtill, they ſpared him his life, adiudging him neuertheleſſe to weare the Sambenite, and to ſuffer perpetuall impriſonment during life, ſaue onely that on ſundayes they brought him forth, with many other moe of his companions, and carried them to Saint Saluatours Church to heare ſeruice. Whereas diuers and ſundry times he aroſe out of his place, and in the hearing of all the people, controlled the Preacher when hee taught them amiſſe. At what time it ſo chanced, that the Inquiſitors were not halfe ſo bad as other that had beene before them, ſo that his fact was wound vp quietly, and excuſed by madneſſe and folly. Afterwards, he was remoued forth of priſon to Saint Lucars, into a certaine houſe of religion, where he died, being a man aboue 50. yeares of age, a very wonder to the world at that time, ſent to awake men out of their dead ſleep of wickedneſſe &amp; ignorance wherin they lay ſnoring and ſnorting ſo long. But foraſmuch as thoſe articles whereof he was moſt vniuſtly condemned, were ſtrange and not heard of in Siuill at thoſe dayes, hee had a Sambenite appointed to weare, ſuch one as was of the largeſt ſize that any ware in his time, the which at this day is to be ſeen for a ſpeciall monument of a notable heretike in the veſtry of the chief Church in Siuill, in a place

where euery man may eaſily ſee it, with this inſcription wrought in capitall letters, Roderico Valerio a citizen of Nebriſſa, an Apostata, and a falſe Apoſtle of Siuill, who ſaid he was ſent from God. By this mans aduertiſement, as I ſhewed before, was this Doctour Aegidio firſt awaked, and by his inſtructions came firſt to the knowledge of the true Goſpel of Chriſt, wch lay buried a long ſeaſon before, ſo that neither maiſter nor ſcholler once heard ſo much as one word thereof. Therefore ſo oft as his matter came in hearing before the Inquiſitours, this Doctor Aegidio did alwayes ſtand his good friend as much as in him lay, through whoſe meanes it was thought that he found the more favour at the Inquiſitours hands in the mitigation of their ſentence vpon him, being a relapſe as their term is. But in the end Doctor Aegidio himſelfe bought full dearely that little curteſie that was ſhewed to this man at his mediation. For thereby he purchaſed to himſelfe both much hatred, and grew dayly into great ſuſpicion with all that pack of Phariſies, that could not wel away with his perfect and vertuous ſinceritie. Beſides theſe good inſtructions, this Aegidio was alſo familiarly acquainted &amp; conuerſant with Conſtantino Fontio, a man excellently well learned, by whoſe dayly conference, he profited maruellouſly in ſtudie, fell to the reading of good Authors, and ſo grew to profound knowledge in the holy Scriptures: but ſpecially concerning ſuch matters whereof he would preach to edifie the people withall, he both learned them perfectly by conference with otherwiſe &amp; learned men, &amp; partly by his own reading and experience: at the length, beganne to preach as learnedly, godly, and zealouſly, as he had before times done coldly, fooliſhly, and vnskilfully. Then began the hearers to feel the maruellous force of that doctrine which theſe three men of great credit and eſtimation, Aegidio, Conſtantino, &amp; Varquia magno taught with one conſent, inſomuch that the more they grew in knowledge from their old ignorance and blindneſſe, the more were theſe men

had in reputation among them, and the old hyporcites deſpiſed, that had taught them other doctrine to the great perill of their ſoules. Whereupon there were dayly diuers complaints brought to the Inquiſitors eares of theſe men: but ſpecially of D. Aegidio, who of meer ſimplicity, and by reaſon that he was in ſome more authoritie than the reſt, did more openly inueigh againſt the aduerſaries of the truth whom they began chiefly to enuie at ſuch time as the Emperor in reſpect of his ſingular learning and integritie of life, elected him to the biſhopricke of Dortois. For then thoſe hypocrits began to beſtirre them of all hands, and to lay all their heads together to giue him a lift, thinking that if he were once conſecrated Biſhop there, he would keepe a foule coyle in their kingdome. Therfore they cited him to come before the holy Houſe, where plaint was entred againſt him by ſuch as were their crafts-maiſters, able to worke him miſchiefe, and to bring it about cloſely, ſo that by their meanes he was caſt into priſon, and therupon examined. The firſt matter was concerning the iuſtification of a Chriſtian man, and diuers other that depend thereon; as of mans merits, of purgatory, of the meanes of ſatisfaction for ſinnes deuiſed by mans braine, of the number of Mediatours, and whether there were any moe than Chriſt alone: alſo concerning the aſſurance of faith in ſuch as are iuſtified, &amp;c. Beſides theſe, there were alſo other matters that fell out by occaſion of an abominable Idoll of the bleſſed Virgine Marie, wrought very artificially by Ferdinando the King (as the report goeth): the which Image, vpon diuers feaſtes of the bleſſed Virgine, is ſet vp and ſhewed to the people with great pompe: whereupon Idolatrie or the worſhipping of Images came in queſtion. Alſo by like occaſion of a certaine chip of wood that is very ſuperſtitiouſly honoured in the ſame Church, as a peece of the Croſſe whereon Chriſt was crucified, the which relique Doctour Aegidio wiſhed to bee burned, the ſame matter likewiſe came in talke. Moreouer, concerning

inuocation and prayers to dead ſaints, and the baniſhing out of pulpits the deuices of mans brain, and of placing therein the perfect and expreſſe word of God and other ſuch neceſſary matters of like importance: and therwithal, to ſet him forward, he was charged to be an earneſt fauourer of Valerio de Nebriſſa, &amp;c. Whereunto D. Aegidio made anſwer particularly, but chiefly touching the firſt poynt. whereof he made ſo perfect &amp; abſolute a defence, ſo learnedly, ſo godly, &amp; ſo abſolutely, as any hath bin hitherto heard or ſeene: in the which anſwere hee gaue his aduerſaries twenty waies to take aduantage of him, and thereupon to inferre diuers other ſuch hereſies. But at that time the Inquiſitours were not growne ſo bold as ſince then they haue beene, nor indeede durſt burne ſuch a man as he was for theſe quarrels, albeit they were vrged and called vpon on euery ſide very earneſtly ſo to do. Therefore ſeeing that they could in no wiſe make him change or alter his minde, they began to deuiſe which way they might ſaue his life, becauſe the Emperour, who lately had elected him to ſo great a Biſhopricke, as alſo the whole Chapter of the Cathedrall Church in Siuill, were becom very earneſt ſuters in his behalfe. There was alſo one of the Inquiſitours named Corrano, a good and a fatherly old man, who for that aſſurance which hee had by his owne knowledge of the good conuerſation of Doctor Aegidio, and of the frowardnes of his accuſers, ſtood his very good friend, though his wicked aſſociate Pedro Diazio was ſore againſt him; who like a proud Apoſtata forſooke the truth, wherein the ſame Valerio de Nebriſſa had inſtructed him in his priuate lectures vpon Pauls Epiſtle to the Romanes: for the which hee gaue him at that time moſt hearty thankes, and yet notwithſtanding was now become a turne-cote. When Varquio was dead, and Conſtantino in the low countries with the Emperour being his chaplaine and confeſſour, there were certaine arbitratours appointed on both partes concerning this religion that was newly come

into Spaine. And Doctor Aegidio for his part among others named one Bartholomeo de Zamora, a Monke of the order of Saint Dominicke, a man very well learned, and one that knewe the truth. Who afterwards by the Emperours meanes was preferred to the Archbiſhopricke of Toledo: whence hee was ſhortly after depoſed for religion, or as it is more probably coniectured, vpon ſome priuy grudge which the Archbiſhop of Siuill, high commiſſioner in the Inquiſition, bare vnto him, and ſo after many conflicts with the Inquiſitours, at the length died. But at that time hee could not bee preſent at this triall, by reaſon that hee was attendant vpon the Emperour: So that Arias, who was commonly called Seigneur Blanco, was Iudge at that time. But what his verdite was, is already partly reported in the ſpeciall hiſtory that I haue written of him, and perhaps the ſame may come forth to light hereafter particularly ioyned with the anſwer that Doctor Aegidio made thereunto. But whether Arias were thereto nominated by the Inquiſitours themſelues, or by Doctor Aegidio, as yet it is not certainly known: ſo that ſome being abſent, and ſome fearefull to ſpeake their mindes for feare of afterclaps, the determination thereof was referred to one called Dominico à Soto, a ſophiſter of great ſame in the Vniuerſity of Salamancke, and one other of the order of Saint Dominicke, who after great expectation of his comming, at the laſt came from Salamanck to Siuill, and there entred diſputation with Doctor Aegidio that was but a plaine-dealing man and of a ſmall foreſight, more craftily and ſubtilly then other had dealt before him. Firſt, pretending much good will towards him, and perceauing that by dealing with him openly, hee could in no caſe remoue him from his opinion, hee fained himſelfe to be iumpe with him in the ſame: marry hee aduiſed him, that foraſmuch as thoſe articles that preſently were called in queſtion were ſomewhat odious in moſt mens eares, to the end to ſtoppe that gappe, hee would make and

publiſh ſome apt declaration and expoſition thereof, the which he offred to preſcribe vnto him in the beſt ſort that he could, that he might vſe it if it liked him, or elſe they two to conferre about it, and ſet it forth to the better diſcharge of their conſciences, furtherance of the truth, and contentation of the hearers. Whereupon Aſoto preſcribed ſuch a preſident: both of them conferred about it, and in the end agreed without any controuerſie. There was a ſolemne day of hearing appointed by the Inquiſitours for that purpoſe, and two pulpits ſet in the Cathedrall Church, the one for D. Aegidio, the other for Aſoto, and all the people were aſſembled thither. Aſoto began his ſermon, and proceeded accordingly. Immediately after the end thereof, he drew forth of his boſome a declaration quite contrary to that whereupon they were agreed. For in the former there was nothing but that which was conſonant to the truth and his own conſcience: in this, no ſuch matter, but only a plain recantation of all thoſe things whereof he was accuſed, and had bin a maintainer of before by the ſpace of 2. whole yeares, and lately alſo during the time of his impriſonment. But the pulpits were ſuch a diſtance aſunder, that by meanes thereof partly, and partly with the murmure of the common people, whiles euery man gaue his verdite thereof, there was ſuch a noiſe, that Doct. Aegidio could not well vnderſtand what Aſoto ſaid: but yet for the good opinion which he had of him, gaue him ſuch credit, that at the end of euery article, when Aſoto craftily asked his conſent thereto, willing him to ſpeake aloud that the people might hear him, or elſe to ſignifie ſo much by ſome countenance or geſture, he did ſo, confeſſing that he did agree to all thoſe things which Aſoto had read vnto them. Whereupon he was preſently condemned to ſuffer impriſonment for 3. yeares. Moreouer, this crafty Monk procured a prohibition againſt him for preaching, reading or writing by the ſpace of 10 yeares after, enioining him during that time, not to depart Spain. Wherat D. Aegidio maruelled

much, hearing that his puniſhment was no greater, knowing nothing hereof, nor vnderſtanding after what ſort he was circumuented, til the time that he was brought to priſon againe: whither diuers of his friends reſorting to viſit him, began to rebuke him for denying the truth. The which things wee neuer came to haue any notice of, but of his owne mouth in the time of his impriſonment. During wch time he chanced to hear of the death of 3. of his moſt deadly enemies, Sbarroia, a ſophiſter &amp; one of y•
                      order of S. Dominike, Pedro Mexia, o
                        •
                     e that took vpon him very arrogantly the title of a Philoſopher without any maner of good learning, and Pedro Diazio the Inquiſitor that plaied the Apostata and forſook the truth moſt wickedly as was before declared. Neither is it to be otherwiſe thought then to be the ſecret iudgement of God, that 3. of the greateſt enemies that the truth had, and ſore aduerſaries to this innocent man, ſhould dye all within one yeare each after other, while D. Aegidio was in priſon, and his matters in examination, and (as it is reported) that ſome of them ſhould depart ſcarce quietly. Howbeit hee liued foure or fiue yeares after that retractation which was compaſſed of him by ſuch deceitful meanes, and was neuertheleſſe eſteemed of all that godly congregation, and did as much good to other afterwards, as at any other time being at his moſt liberty. In the wch time, by reaſon of an embaſſie which he was ſent in, he viſited his brethren that ſometime had been ſchollers to D. Cacalia at Valladolit profeſſing the goſpel vnder him, &amp; renouncing all wickednes &amp; impietie. Whom after he had comforted and confirmed, in his way homeward as he returned to Siuill, being ſore ſhaken in that long iourney, by reaſon that he had not been acquainted with trauaile of a great while before, he ſickned, and thereupon within a few dayes after departed this troubleſome life, and went to euerlaſting reſt.
                  He left behind him certaine Commentaries vpon the book of GENESIS, &amp; Saint PAULES Epiſtle to the

Coloſſians, vpon certaine of the Pſalmes and Cantica Canticorum, written by him in the Spaniſh tongue very learnedly, and like one plentifully indued with the Holy Ghoſt, the which are reſerued in the cuſtodie of diuers men of truſt and credit, as iewells and treaſures to the behoofe of the Church. The which albeit they were both learned and godly, yet other things which hee wrote in priſon, doe ſo farre exceede them for the ſpeciall affections moued (no doubt) by the ſpirit of God, and expreſſed therein, that a man may eaſily ſee the force of affliction &amp; tribulation, how much it auaileth the godly for deepe iudgement in matters of diuinitie. But within two or three yeares after his death the new Inquiſitors thinking that the other who had the examination of him had dealt a great deal more eaſily with him than became Inquiſitors, ſeeing that they could not cite his ſpirit 
                        •
                     o appeare before them, which was in quietneſſe and in reſt, therefore they determined to ſhew their ſpite towards his carcaſſe &amp; dry bones. Whereupon they digged him out of his graue, and buried in his place and vnder his name a puppet of ſtraw, brought his corps vpon the ſcaffold, and vſed it in ſuch ſort as they would haue done himſelfe that ſitteth in Heauen with Chriſt on the right hand of his Father, if they could haue caught him here in earth. But God that dwelleth on high, laugeth at their follies.
               
               
                  Doctor Constantino Fontio, a Canon and Preacher in the Cathedrall Church in Siuill.
                  IT was the ſingular good hap of the Church (ſauing that it heaped condemnation vpon it the more) that Conſtantino ſhould come in place after ſo godly a man as D. Aegidio was: by whoſe meanes Conſtantino in very ſhort ſpace maruellouſly encreaſed &amp; profited in vertue and ſound religion. And therfore, foraſmuch as the worthines of this man was ſo great, I am iuſtly occaſioned ſomewhat largely to

diſcourſe of him in this hiſtorie. Wherein I feare it greatly, leſt I ſhall not bee able ſufficiently to ſet out the commendation of that man accordingly as his worthineſſe deſerueth. For how can I deuiſe to ſound thy prayſes ſufficiently, being the moſt famous Diuine of any that hath liued in our dayes, and one whom God of his aboundant gracious goodneſſe, did indue ſo plentifully with ſo rare qualities, as hardly are to bee ſeen together againe in one man, ſo that well they may be wondered at, but neuer valued to their worth? It is a ſtrange matter, and almoſt incredible, and yet true that I will report of him, for I am able to iuſtifie it: that of many thouſands of men that haue viewed this mans qualities thorowly, there was neuer any, but eyther loued him paſſingly, or elſe hated him ſpitefully. Therefore as he was ordained to be both beloued and hated with extremitie: ſo had hee many malicious enemies, and as many earneſt friends and fauourers. And heere I comprehend not vnder the name of friends, ſuch as hee himſelfe bare good will vnto, more than I account thoſe men among the number of his foes to whom hee wiſhed euill: but onely ſuch as he knew not, and yet they with all their hearts both loued and honoured him. For thoſe that he bare ſpeciall affection vnto (foraſmuch as he knew the vnconſtancie of this world) were onely one or two in all his lifetime. Notwithſtanding, ſuch as he thought worthy to be beloued in reſpect of their vertue, he would pleaſure any way that poſſibly he could. His youth, in compariſon of other young men that beſtudious, perhaps he beſtowed not ſo prayſably: yet ſo, as it was no hindrance to him in his age afterwards, but that he paſſed it with great commendation. For being a man of a maruellous pleaſant wit, and in matters of diſport pleaſantly diſpoſed (otherwiſe very faire conditioned) hee diminiſhed his credit and eſtimation ſomewhat after he was grown in yeares, by vſing himſelfe ouermuch to 
                        •
                     eſting. Howbeit, that was only with his aduerſaries, who notwithſtanding would as greatly

haue diſliked him on the other ſide, if hee had been as ſage and graue as either Curius or Cato. And indeed there are a great ſort of his ſayings in many mens mouthes, which being well weighed and conſidered, are more worthy to be called wiſe Apothegmes, than pleaſant ſpeeches: but they are ſuch as cannot aptly bee expreſſed, and retaine their grace in any other language. Neither did he ſo commonly vſe to ieſtat any, or ſo finely, as at thoſe hypocrites the Monks and Prieſts that had a certaine pride in themſelues, of a fooliſh phariſaicall opinion of holineſſe, being but in meere toyes and trifles. But moſt of all he vſed to gird the fooliſh Preachers, whereof there was neuer any age ſo full, whom the holy Scriptures account to be the vileſt ſort of people that are, comparing them to ſalt that hath loſt his ſauor, &amp; wil ſerue to no vſe. Neither can any man ſufficiently maruell at his paſſing wit, that being in a barbarous age, when all good learning was almoſt loſt, and forgotten among men, in this vniuerſall time of ignorance, hee did either only attaine to grounded knowledge, or had very few fellowes. And in the tongues, to wit, the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, became ſo notable without any teacher, that he alone had been ſufficiently able to reſtore them vnto vs of himſelfe. As for all other kinde of learning that ſerued to the furniſhing of a perfect oratour, he attained not onely a ſuperficiall ſight therein, but a perfect and abſolute knowledge. With theſe helpes he fell to the ſtudy of holy Scriptures, wherein he became ſo well learned euen in his youth, that whenſoeuer he was occaſioned to ſhew his opinion concerning any matters, or the ſignification of any termes therein, he left nothing vntouched that any might doubt of, except ſuch as were blind as buzzards, &amp; could ſee nothing. Moreouer, he was ſo eloquent in his owne tongue, that all his auditors were brought into a great admiration thereof. Being thus furniſhed with theſe good gifts, he fell to preaching, and without compariſon paſſed all them of this age or of the age before him. Beſides theſe

good qualities, hee had a ſingular good diſcretion and iudgement in all his doings, the which he had attained vnto, partly by great ſtudy, partly by long practice and experience, but ſpecially by great ſearch and profound knowledge in holy Scriptures, wherein he plainly ſaw, as it had beene from the top of a high Tower, whatſoever all the world did. At ſuch times as he preached (which commonly was about eight of the clock) there was ſo great reſort to his Sermon, that after foure of the clocke in the morning, and many times from three, it was hard to get a good place in all the Church where a man might conveniently heare him. Notwithſtanding all this fauour and affection which all the people bare vnto him (except the malicious hypocrites) beſides his meat and drinke for his reaſonable ſuſtenance, and his Library which was but meanly furniſhed, he gathered together no other great ſubſtance: for he was a man farre from thoſe two plagues that haue alwaies infected the Church of Chriſt, couetouſneſſe and ambition. In ſo much that being offered a good Canonſhip in the Church of Toledo, which many a man of his order would think himſelfe in happy caſe if he might attaine vnto, he was ſo farre from the greedy deſire thereof, that he contemned it, rather not caring for it

                     mmediatly after the death of the Biſhop of Vtica, that was preacher in the Cathedrall Church, the whole Chapiter with one conſent offered him that place which they commonly call the Oppoſition, and ſent for him thither very honourably. But he made them anſwer without any great deliberation, that he had great cauſe to yeeld them many thankes for their good opinions conceaved of him, in that they thought him worthy of ſo great a dignitie, ſaying that hee would doe the beſt he could to requite their curteſies. Howbeit foraſmuch as his fathers and his grandfathers bones buried many yeares agoe, were now in reſt and quiet, he would in no caſe doe any thing whereby the reſt that they were in

might be interrupted. And this (I ſuppoſe) was the ſumme of his anſwer and the very words which hee ſpake. For about that time there grew hot quarrells betwixt the Archbiſhop ſurnamed Siliceus a man of famous memorie forſooth, and the chapiter of the ſame Church. The Archbiſhop was hated of the chief men of the chapiter becauſe he had openly &amp; in opprobrious maner reported them to be deſcended of the loine of the Iewes: and they on the other ſide being men in good eſtate, and not able to beare theſe reproaches, thought to be euen with this fooliſh Biſhop that came from cart &amp; plough, and by good hap (as a man may ſay) without all reſpect of learning or honeſty, was preferred to the higheſt dignity in all Spain next vnder the king: and becauſe he was a troubler of common quiet, they purpoſed to work him all the ſpight that might be: by meanes wherof none were ſpared that had been buried by the ſpace of a 100 yeares, but that this good Archbiſhop vnder pretence of religion made inquiry of the Canons fathers, grandfathers and great grandfathers, driuing them to deriue their pedigree out of their graues. The which fooliſh &amp; vngodly controuerſies Conſtantino took occaſion to quip them for, at ſuch time as he was ſent for to ſupply that place. In like

                        uenca, both rich to the purſe &amp; worſhipful beſides for eſtimation, ſituate in his own natiue foil. Moreouer, being the firſt man that brought the knowledge of true religion into Siuill, he did ſo plainly ſet it forth and ſo ſincerely, ſo ſharply rebuked thoſe pedlers that ſold all their packs of pardons and other fancies for pence, laying ſuch things ſo ſore to their charge, that notwithſtanding they ſaw full well that he would proue a plague both to them and their whole generation, yet could they not finde any iuſt cauſe to accuſe him of but to their owne ſhame, and yet ceaſed they not to hate him deadly. Howbeit he took away their ſtings ſo cleane, that they could neuer come conueniently to poiſon him: neither did hee ſlacke for all

that to ſet forth the truth, notwithſtanding that hee knew they lay in wait for him priuily. And ſurely it was the ſingular prouidence of God which ſo bleſſed that Citie, that there ſhould be in that Church at once three ſuch notable men and ſo excellently learned, Conſtantino, Aegidio &amp; Varquio, which before times were Students together in Diuinitie, and now furtherers of vertue and good religion with one conſent, and with like zeale. For Varquio did read vpon the Goſpell after Matthew, in the Cathedrall Church; and that being done, did afterwards take in hand to expound the Pſalter. Aegidio preached dayly: Conſtantino not ſo often as Aegidio, but to as great fruit and edifying, continuing all together each man in his roome, till afterwards that God ſent ſtormie tempeſtes, to the end to try each mans building, that Varquio in the middeſt of this hurly burly, while hee and his aduerſaries were bickering together, died: Conſtantino was ſent for by the Emperour and his ſonne Philip, and forced to forſake Siuill. So that Doct. Aegidio was left alone like a lambe among a ſort of wolues to miniſter matter for a tragedy: the which is already declared in this hiſtorie. After whoſe death Conſtantino left the Emperours Court, where hee had gotten both wiſedome and learning, and returned to Siuil againe to ſet forward the light of the Goſpell that had beene ſtopped for a while. The which thing he did with as much zeale as euer he did before time: ſo that both he himſelfe was very well eſteemed, and his ſermons liked of all the people exceedingly. It was alſo his chance, by reaſon of a certaine order taken by the whole Chapiter, to bee appointed the next lent after his comming to preach euery other day in the Cathedrall Church. The wch when he refuſed to take vpon him becauſe of his late ſicknes, being ſcarcely well recouered, he was compelled to do it perforce, notwithſtanding that he was ſo weak a creature that he was ſomtime carried thither, &amp; for faintnes once or twiſe in a ſermon compelled to drink a draught of wine to refreſh himſelf withal,

and to make him able to hold out til the end of his howre. The which (doubtleſſe) was a very ſtrange ſight to behold: and yet ſuch fauour euery man bare towards him, that hee was diſpenſed withall to vſe that libertie. Afterwards being reſtored to his health, he deuiſed a ready way to ſet forward his purpoſe, and ſuch as none had troden in before him. For by his meanes one Seignior Scobario a famous man in Siuill, both in life and learning, to whom the Senate of the Citie by common conſent had committed the charge and ouerſight of the Colledge of children (commonly called the houſe of learning) conferring with Conſtantino about the matter, tranſlated the reuenue that ſome drunken chaplen would haue deuoutly drunk for his ſoule, into a yearely ſtipend, towards the maintenance of a Diuinitie-lecture in the ſame Colledge, whereof this Conſtantino was choſen reader. Who both happily tooke in hand and effectually purſued that profitable exerciſe: beginning firſt with Salomons Prouerbs, the booke of the Preacher, and Cantica Canticorum. Which after hee had paſſed through very learnedly, he proceeded into 
                        •
                     ob, and expounded it more than halfe. All which workes are extant at this day in written hand, gathered very painefully by one of his auditors named Bab. Wherein it ſhall appeare hereafter, as I can haue leaſure to publiſh them, how farre hee hath exceeded all that haue written vpon theſe books hitherto, and how excellently wel learned he was. But ſome euill ſpirit enuying the good ſucceſſe of that Citie, vnder the pretence of feruent zeale, cauſed him to forſake that courſe wherein hee ranne before, and afterward incombered him ſo many wayes, that he was neuer cleare quit of all till his dying day. About what time welneare, it hapned that the chiefe Canonſhip (which was firſt founded for a Preacher) fell void in the Church of Siuill, by reaſon of Doct. Aegidio his death. Whereunto the whole Chapiter would willingly haue choſen Conſtantino, as one whom they thought of deſert worthy the place, for the

notable gifts that both they and all the whole Citle ſaw in him of a long time while he continued Preacher there, but that it would not ſtand with the rules of their Houſe to admit him therunto without oppoſitions. For vpon their laſt error in chuſing Doct. Aegidio, immediately after, they entered an order, that none thenceforth ſhould be admitted to enioy that place without their accuſtomed kinde of oppoſitions vſuall in all Churches. Whereas Conſtantino on the other ſide had alwaies ſcorned and d
                        •
                     rided thoſe ceremonies, as toyes, not much vnlike the contentions of iugglers &amp; minſtrels for the beſt games. Moreouer, one Valdeſio Biſhop of Siuill &amp; a courtier, owing Conſtantino a priuy grudge from the firſt time that he preached before the Emperor, &amp; grew into his fauour, was very earneſtly in hand with the Chapiter, preſſing them with their own decree, after he vnderſtood that they were about to vndo it again. Wherupon there was a day appointed for the oppoſition, and publiſhed in the moſt famous Cities in Spaine, ſo that diuers came flocking, as it had bin a ſort of crowes about a carrion. But the wiſer ſort kept themſelues away from encountring with him, for the greatfauour and eſtimation that hee was in, ſo that there were but onely two that aboad the brunt: the one called Maiuelo a Canon of Alcala, the other a Canon of Malaga, hoping belike to get ſome great bootie thereby. Howbeit the firſt vpon better aduiſement returned home againe ſhortly after to Alcala: the other Canon of Malaga, bolſtered by the Archbiſhop to ſpight Conſtantino withall, wilfully continued the skirmiſh. At the length, Conſtantino being ouercome through the great entreatie and perſwaſion of the Chapiter, but eſpecially moued by the importunate ſute of a friend of his, to whom I wiſh he had not yeelded ſo much in this (for then perhaps he had been aliue at this time) reſolued himſelfe to ſtand for the Canonſhip, and to diſpute after the accuſtomed order: by meanes whereof fulfilling that ceremony, he of Malaga was ſent to ſhake his eares, and

the Chapiter preuailed againſt the Biſhop. There was alſo at the ſame time a little zeale which blinded Conſtantino, leſt perhaps ſome prater ſhould haue ſ
                        •
                     ept in place, that would alwaies be barking againſt good &amp; godly doctrine: whereas by his accepting of the ſame place there was a certain likelyhood and hope, that the doctrine therby ſhould haue the more free paſſage. In reſpect whereof, hee was the more willing, rather then for any greedy or couetous deſire of attaining any wealth thereby, the which vice hee alwayes contemned with a manly courage. Whereupon, his aduerſarie that ſtood againſt him perceiuing himſelfe vnable to weigh with him, either for learning; countenance, or fauour which hee found at the Chapiters hand, bent himſelf wholly to take exceptions to his perſon, &amp; to diſable him that way. Firſt he began to obiect againſt him all his youthly toyes, namely mariage, the wch was before he entred into orders, charing him that neither hee was rightly prieſted, nor came by his degree of Doctorſhip orderly. On the other ſide, a maruellous rabble of the hypocrites that had been of his old acquaintance began to bee galled afreſh, ſeeing him ſo highly preferred, inſomuch that they fell to reuiue old matters concerning diuers points of religion, vrging them more earneſtly than they had done before time, &amp; that in the court of ye Inquiſition, wherein Valdeſio his aduerſary ſat as Iudge. Notwithſtanding in the middeſt of theſe broiles, Conſtantino reſting vpon the good wils of the Chapiter, was inſtalled, and whiles the controuerſies were at the hotteſt, there was much buſineſſe in that Church by meanes of certaine books of Iuliano paruo, whereof I made mention before. In the which ſtormes what place was there wherein Conſtantino might ſhroud his head? And yet being brought before the Inquiſitours, albeit hee had thorowly diſpleaſed all his aduerſaries in the former braules before, yet notwithſtanding he auoided all their quarrels picked againſt him by his quicke and ready anſwers (after his accuſtomed maner)

ſo eaſily, that they could in no caſe get him to make any open proteſtation of his faith, by the which their hope was to compaſſe and circumuent him. And in very deede he had eſcaped at the length, but that God of his wonderfull prouidence compelled him ſore againſt his will, briefly and plainely to confeſſe his truth. For nigh about the ſame time there was a very honeſt and a ſubſtantiall widow, named Iſabella Martina, apprehended, in whoſe houſe Conſtantino had hidde certaine ſpeciall bookes for feare of the Inquiſitours, which hee might not auow the keeping of in Spaine without preſent perill. Whoſe goods being ſequeſtred according to the cuſtome of the Inquiſition, her ſonne, one Franciſco Bertramo, had conueighed diuers Cheſts of the beſt ſtuffe that his mother had, becauſe hee would ſaue ſomewhat, ſo that theſe greedie gulles ſhould not deuoure all. The which thing comming to the Inquiſitours eares, by meanes of his vntruſtie ſeruant who diſcloſed it, was the occaſion that they ſent immediately one Ludouico Sotellio their Alguazill to demand thoſe Cheſtes. Who reſorted vnto him accordingly; as he began to ſay his meſſage ſoberly, Bertramo forgetting the Cheſtes, and ſuppoſing that the cauſe of his comming had been for Conſtantino's bookes, tooke the tale out of his mouth and ſaid vnto him: Seignior Ludouico, I know whereabout you come, and therefore if you will promiſe mee on your honeſtly quietly to depart vpon the receite therof, I will ſhew you them. The Alguazill meaning the Cheſtes (as for the bookes hee neither came for them, nor knew of any ſuch before) promiſed him ſo to doe. Wherupon Bertramo carried him forth with into a ſecret place far within the houſe, and plucking forth a ſtone or two in the wall, ſhewed him Conſtantino's iewells of paper indeede, but farre more precious than gold or pearle. Whereat the Alguazil being ſomewhat aſtonied, to find that which he looked not for, told him that he came to demand no ſuch maner of thing, but certaine Cheſtes of

his mothers goods, which he had purloined from the Sequeſter. As for his promiſe made vnto him for his quiet departure, he ſaid hee was not bound thereby otherwiſe, but that he muſt needs carry both him &amp; his books to the Inquiſitours. Thus by theſe meanes came all Conſtantino's writings out of corners to light, and to the Inquiſitours hands, contrary both to his owne expectation and his aduerſaries, which would haue giuen a great peece of money to haue come by them before. And among other of his writings there was one great volume found written throughout with his owne hand, wherein (as the Inquiſitours themſelues reported in their ſentence which they gaue vpon him afterwards ſtanding vpon the ſcaffold) hee did openly and plainly in maner, as it were for his owne ſatisfaction, handle theſe ſpeciall points: that is to ſay, the ſtate of the Church, the true Church &amp; the Popes Church, whom he called very Antichriſt: the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper: the inuention of the Maſſe, wherein hee ſaid that the whole world was deceiued &amp; abuſed through ignorance of the holy Scriptures: the iuſtification of a Chriſtian man: Purgatory, wch he termed the wolus head, ſaying that it was a deuice of the Monks to feed their own bellies: alſo Bulles &amp; Popiſh pardons, mens merits, ſhrift, and other articles of Chriſtian religion. The which book ſo ſoone as it came to the Inquiſitors hands, they demanded of him if he knew his owne hand: howbeit he ſhifted them off from their purpoſe a good while, and droue them off from day to day, til at the laſt vnderſtanding the will of God, who had now taken away all euaſions from him, he acknowledged his owne hand, and confeſſed it to bee his owne writing, proteſting openly, that all things therein contayned were full of truth &amp; ſinceritie. Therefore (ſaid he) take ye no further paines in ſeeking witneſſes to teſtifie againſt mee, ſince you haue ſo plaine and perfect a confeſſion of my opinion and beliefe, but doe deale with mee as it ſhall pleaſe you. After the which examination and anſwer

hee remained in priſon by the ſpace of two whole yeares: where partly by occaſion of his corrupt &amp; naughtie diet, though he were not a man greatly curious or daintie therein before time, but chiefly, of very ſorrow conſuming him to ſee ſo much labour, both of his owne and others his fellowes, ſpent in vaine vpon that good Church, which now was ſo miſerably ſacked, he fell firſt to be a little craſed, and afterwards being not able to abide the exceeding heate of the Sunne, which made his priſon like a hothouſe vnto him, was faine to ſtrip himſelfe into his bare ſhirt, &amp; ſo to continue both day &amp; night. By occaſiō wherof he fell ſick of the bloody 
                        •
                     lixe, and within 15. daies after dyed, amids the filth &amp; ſoile of the priſon, rendring vp his ſweet ſoule to Chriſt, for the promoting of whoſe glorie he had oftentimes before aduentured it moſt manfully. And in this time of his ſicknes, as well as at the howre of his death, there was preſent with him a certaine young man, a Monk of Saint Iſidors cloiſter, vertuous and well diſpoſed, who alſo was priſoner there for religion at the ſame time, and put in the ſame priſon with him to keepe him company. This Monkes name was Ferdinando. Perhaps in the eyes of fooliſh worldlings this Constantino ſeemed to dye, but in very deed he reſteth in peace. As for the cruell tortures, which other haue accuſtomably beene tormented withall, the truth is, he neuer taſted any, not for any regard that theſe cruell Termagants had of ſuch a man as hee was (whoſe diſpleaſure hee had earneſtly procured againſt him by his ſharpe and quicke anſwers while hee was priſoner) but eyther, for that they determined to delay his puniſhment, meaning to detaine him, in priſon a longer ſpace, to the intent to diſcourage him, and to keepe other that fauoured his doctrine anie way, or were entred in that religion, in continuall awe: or elſe, becauſe they thought not that hee ſhould haue been taken forth of their hands ſo ſuddenly. Whereupon, the Inquiſitours bruted a rumour abroad to the ſame end

and purpoſe, to daunt ſuch as had been his ſchollers, that they might come trembling into the Court, and accuſe themſelues before they were ſent for, vpon hope of the Inquiſitours mercy: cauſing it to bee noiſed, that he in his life being vpon the rack, had confeſſed vnto them of diuers that were his auditours &amp; ſchollers. To the which end and purpoſe, diuers of the next priſon adioining to his, were ſuborned to affirme that they heard the cries and ſhrikes which he made at the time of his tormenting. Therefore now after his death, ſeeing him to bee taken out of their hands by Gods good meanes, ſo that now they had him no more aliue among them to extend their crueltie vpon, they determined notwithſtanding to worke him ſuch poore ſpight as they could, in derogating from the good eſtimation and report which he had of all men, ſpreading falſe and ſlanderous tales vpon him, that hee ſhould ſtrike himſelfe in a veine with a peece of a broken glaſſe, 
                        •
                     o auoid both ſhame and paine. There were alſo ſung openly in the ſtreetes ouer all the Citie diuers filthie and ſlanderous dities ſung by boyes in his diſpraiſe: but whether they were publiſhed by procurement of the Inquiſitours, or ſome of their Paraſites, or of meer malice deuiſed and ſet out by the fooliſh and variable people, God knoweth, but the other is the more likely. Alſo againſt the day of their ſolemne Triumph, his corps was taken out of the graue, &amp; in place thereof, a puppet of ſtraw put, and afterwards ſet vp in a pulpit ſo artificially, reſting the one hand vpon the pulpit, and holding the other vpright, that it reſembled Conſtantino very liuely, in ſuch ſort as he was wont to preach. And no doubt but that dumbe Image did preach as effectually in many mens hearts at that inſtant as euer he himſelf had done being aliue, in deriſiō of whom this puppit was made. Then, at what time that ſentence was to be giuen vpon him (to the hearing whereof, diuers came from places farre diſtant from Siuill) the Inquiſitours commanded that it ſhould not be pronounced out of the pulpit where

other iudgements were accuſtomably read, but cauſed the Image to be brought into their holy Court, and there to haue ſentence publiſhed: which place was ſo high, that the the people could not well vnderſtand what was read. Whereupon Calderonio the temporall Iudge thinking it not conuenient, and that ſome other ſubtiltie was meant thereby, moued the Inquiſitours in open audience, that iudgement might bee giuen in the accuſtomed place, or elſe read in ſuch ſort that the people might vnderſtand vpon what occaſions they had condemned him. Whereunto when the Inquiſitors gaue no great eare, but proceeded as before, there began to be a great tumultamong the people, foraſmuch as they could not well brook that iniurie, nor indeede would haue put it vp as it ſeemed, but that they ſaw Calderonio ſomewhat more quicke with the Inquiſitours, and to tell them their duties once againe: ſo that they commanded the Image to be carried into the accuſtomed place, and ſentence to be pronounced aloud, to ſatisfie the people withall. The reading whereof, occupied about an howre and an halfe: and the chiefe matter contained therein, was that which I haue receited before out of Conſtantino's booke. Marry, the Inquiſitours added moreouer, that of purpoſe and vpon good conſideration they had omitted many things that were ſo horrible, ſo wicked, and ſo ſtrange, that it was ſore againſt God commandement to vtter them in common audience. There bee diuers of this mans works extant that haue paſſed the print. Firſt a briefe ſumme of Chriſtian religion. Alſo one other diſcourſe in the ſame argument more at large, but ſomewhat imperfect, or rather ſcarcely halfe finiſhed: for he purpoſed to haue comprehended the whole bodie of Chriſtian religion, in two tomes. In the former hee treated of faith: In the other hee thought to haue handled the Sacraments, and to haue ſpoken of workes, and generally of the duetie of a Chriſtian man. As for the former part, it was already publiſhed ſome yeares agone: whereby hee

procured to himſelfe ſome diſpleaſure and ſuſpicion of hereſie among the common ſort of learned men, foraſmuch as entreating of faith he did not plainly inueigh againſt the Lutherans, nor attributed any preeminence to the Biſh. of Rome, but had written rather in derogation of pardons, of purgatory, of mens merits, and ſuch other like trifles, then in aduancement thereof: vpon the which ſuſpicions being examined, he would anſwer them, that ſuch matters as they wanted in his workes were more pertinent to his ſecond tome, wherein he purpoſed to diſcourſe of them ſomewhat largely. Howbeit this other volume neuer came to light, except perhaps it were that which was hidden in the widows houſe, and came to the Inquiſitors hands, the ſpeciall points whereof they publiſhed, as I haue before declared. Moreouer, he ſet forth a Catechiſme, which perhaps in other places elſewhere of more freedome and libertie was not greatly accounted of, but yet in theſe places of darkneſſe and ignorance, and vnder ſuch tyranny, it gaue much light to many. There be alſo extant ſixe ſermons of this good mans, wch he made vpon ſix of the firſt verſes of the firſt Pſalme. Wherein the learned may ſee, as well the profound learning that was in him, as alſo his ſingular art for conueiance. But of all his workes, which ſurely were as learnedly written and as godly as anie that euer were read in Spaine, the confeſſion of a ſinner, not paſſing two or three ſheetes long, exceeded all the reſt, both for the zeale, learning, and eloquence vttered therin, moſt liuely expreſſing the affections of a Chriſtian man, incident to ſuch an argument. Firſt he bringeth in a man before the iudgement ſeat of God, making him to ſee, and liuely 
                        •
                     o lament his owne filthineſſe and abomination, to caſt off all whatſoeuer theſe phariſees flattering themſelues with their owne righteouſneſſe were wont to couer our nakedneſſe withall, being eyther deuiſed or eſtabliſhed by man, and therein hee peruſeth all the ten Commandements orderly, confeſſing him guiltie of the breach therof,

and therewithall maketh ſo plaine and abſolute an expoſition of the whole law, in that ſhort ſummarie, that in ſuch a breuiat (be it ſpoken without offence to any) I haue not hitherto ſeene any ſo lightſome. In the end hee clotheth them with the wedding garment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe by faith, wherewith alonely he encourageth and emboldneth man before the face of God, as much as hee diſcomforted him before when as he brought him to the perfect knowledge of himſelfe, &amp; the conſideration of his owne caſe and eſtate. Finally, there is no one lot that concerneth chriſtian religion, but he hath touched it, referring it to ſome purpoſe in that briefe table: nor any affection that can be in a man, from the very firſt letter of the law til the laſt end of the Goſpel, and the fruition of the heauenly habitation, but he hath moſt liuely expreſſed it. Neither had he been euer able to deuiſe ſuch a peece of worke, notwithſtanding his paſſing gifts of nature and helps of art, except he had firſt learned them by often experience in himſelf. All the which books of his writing, worthie (no doubt) to be reſerued for euer, albeit the Inquiſitours had a little before vnawares allowed, yet at this time they condemned them: not for any thing found in them worthy of condemnation (as they themſelues teſtified in their ſentence vpon him) but becauſe there ſhould be nothing extant that might remaine as a monument or a memoriall ſounding any wayes to the commendation of him whom they had holden accurſed. Laſtly, they ſhewed their poore ſpight vpon that good mans dry bones, which they digged out of the earth, &amp; vpon that counterfait Image made to his likenes. Howbeit hee himſelfe being exalted aboue the clouds, &amp; taken out of their chains, &amp; deliuered from their vniuſt iudgements (beſides the loſs of theſe notable &amp; worthy monuments mentioned before) hath cauſed a great number of his familiar friends and acquaintance comfortleſſe

to ſit, lamenting and bewayling the miſſe of ſuch a man. O deteſtable tyranny that deſerueſt a thouſand curſes, ſeeing thou canſt not reſtore them againe, what amends wilt thou bee able to make to the world for the death of ſo many godly men as thou haſt moſt ſhamefully ſlaine and murdered?
