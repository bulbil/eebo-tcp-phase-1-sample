            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               AFter that his Excellency Prince Maurice of Nassaw, had trayned his whole Army through Brabant, and lastly laide siedge to the stronge City of Graue: at his first arriuall, hee busied his Soldiers, in continuall raysing of his Trenches, as well for his defence against the sallyes which might be made out of the Citty, as also to preuent the incursion of the Arch-dukes Campe: the which hee knew was very stronge, &amp; would very shortly attempt the Cityes rescue, which indéede so fell out, for that in a very short time, the Admirant of Aragon, with the Archdukes Army, was heard to be marching thetherward: yet by the carefull diligence of his Excellency, and his Commaunders, the whole Campe was so strongely fortifyed, and walled about with déep Trenches, that the Admirant comming thether, and perceiuing

that there was but small hope left, of making any breach through his excellencyes Trenches: Pitched his whole Army lesse then a halfe houres going from our Campe, lying within sight thereof, without any aparant signes of the least a

            His Princely Excellency with his whole Regiment, lyeth on the other side of the Mase, neere Kuycke: the Lord Count William, with his Forces lyeth on the side of the Heath: and Sir Frances Veare with his English Forces, lyeth on the higher side, on the side of the riuer Mase: the other Regiments are placed accordingly, in such order, and maintained with so gallant Martiall gouernement, as it doth ones heart good that beholdes it: their Watches and Centinels so warily and carefully ordered, that they seeme a common wealth: Also, many valiant and resolute enterprises are performed, euen vnder the Citty walles.
            The Cittizens perceiuing the Archdukes Campe to be néere hand, and trusting to be by their approach, better furthered and relieued, then afterwardes they found themselues, beganne to shewe themselues somewhat bolder then before, by diuers signes of brauerie, and some sallyes in the night vpon our Campe, howbeit to their losse, for that they still lost more (by far) then we did, which is contrary to common chaunce, where the 
                  •…
               allyes of Citties (which they neuer proffer but vpon espyed aduantage) happen for the most part to the dammage and losse of the besiedgers.
            Before the enemies approach, the Cittizens kept themselues very quiet, and now hoping of rescue, they made sundry fires in the Citty to the Campe: the which out of the Archdukes Campe were answered with the like signes, without that ought else haue ensued therof.
            In the enemies Campe there is great want of victuals, by reason whereof, many Italians come ouer into

his Excellencies Campe.
            The 18. of August there came aboue foure score Italians into our Campe, some of them were whole Corporalships, with all their weapons and furniture: His Excellency vsing them very kindly, victuals them, and to euery man he giueth a Gilden in money, with a Pasport to returne into Italy: with them hee sendes a messenger to aduise the States, that where they passe, they should be victualled, and so sent forwards.
            At the same time the Cittizens made a salley vpon our Trenches, but being preuented and not daring to come on any farther then their owne counterscarpe, it is not knowne whether they lost any men or no.
            The 19. of August, there came againe into his Excellencyes quarter, aboue 150. of the enemyes reuolted Soldiers, most of them Italians, some of them with their weapons and furniture, and othersome without: they were all well vsed and each man giuen a Gilden in money, and so shipt away.
            The 20. of August, there came ouer to our Campe, a Horse-man with his horse, and al his whole furniture, with two Horse-men without their horses: also two Spaniards which would receiue no Pasport, but wold remaine in his Excellencies seruice.
            The 21 of August, there was a Jesuite or Seminary Priest taken prisoner, and carr
                  •…
               ed into his Excellencyes quarter: also certaine reuolted Italians came to our Campe this day.
            At the same time there were brought nine prisoners which were taken in the skirmish néer vnto the Sconce which his Excellencie tooke from the enemy at his first comming before the Citty, being on the other side of the Mase. In this Sconce (whilst the enemy helde it) there was but a Corpes de Guarde, but it is now a stronge three square Sconce: howbeit, there is no Ordinance

thereon, but onely one great murderer, which casteth balles of fire-worke into the Citty: also, they shoote great péeces of blewe square stone, and other great stones out of it: of such bignes, that a man (with all his power &amp; strength) is but able to lift one of them. These stones (making way wheresoeuer they fal) breaking through Churches and houses, the people doe cry very pittifully, when the said peece is shot off, which can easily be heard out of the said Sconce. The balles of fire which they shoote, are filled with Musket-shot, and doe lye still on the ground, about halfe a quarter of an houre before they worke: and then the flame is séene aboue al the houses of the Citty, insomuch (for as much as can be perceiued, and is most apparant and likely of truth) those of the Citty, doe more feare these fire balles and these great stones, which are shot out of the sayd Sconce, then all the rest of his Excellencies great Ordynance, which he hath in foure batteryes.
            Betwéene the 21. and 22. of August, the enemy attempted to put about 2000. men into the Citty, together with 400. horse, furnishing them al with ladders, dealeboords, shouels, pickaxes, and other instrumentes, to breake in vpon the Redu

            The same night there was taken a horsemans boy, who was found swimming from the Citty, and was carryed before his Excellency, but they could gather nothing by him, because he shewed himselfe as if he had béen drunk or simple: and the selfe same night, the vttermost

            Betweene Thursday and Fryday in the night, being betweene the 22. and 23. of August, the enemy set fire on all his Tents and Cabbins, which did so flame, as if the whole Country had béen on fire, and ther withall, breaking vp his Campe, he went away very quietly without any noyse: next day were found many waggons with weapons and furniture, besides many sicke men, the which his Excellencie caused to be carryed away, vpon his owne costes and charges. The enemy tooke his way vpwards alongst the Mase: and his Excellency followed him with 1200. horse, and some foote: but being that the 23. day of August, there was a very thick mist, he lost the enemy, not knowing which way hee was gone. In the quarter of his Excellency the spéech was, that he was gone toward Rhynebercke. After in the Mase were found many dead bodyes driuing with the streame, as also many armes and legges that were shotten off.

                  y wounded. The quarter and Regiment belonging vnto Sir Frances Veare in this Siedge, is giuen vnto Prince Henry of Nassaw his Excellencyes yongest brother. The enemy lyeth betweene Uerb &amp; Ruremond, seeking by all meanes to assure those two towns with stronger Garrisons: but the townes would as fayne keepe them out, and enjoy a newtrall freedome: the approaches of the siedge goe daily forward; his Princely Excellency intending, not any more to put his Soldiers to the aduenture of any assaults, but endeuours to win the towne with Myning, (a costly and new winning of townes) for the towne is very stronge, and the shot doth but little harme vpon the walle. From this towne we can both heare the report, and see the smoake of the Artillery. In the Campe is good hope that it will be shortly recouered: I shal peraduenture take occasion to goe see the Campe, in company of others, that from hence doe dayly resort thether, both men, women and children, for the Campe is wonderfully well stored of victuals and other necessaries: hauing been there, I will as then relate further vnto you the true estate of all, as neere as I shall be able to collect them. Vntill which time I commit you to God.
               By letters of the 29. of August, according to our computation, there is certaine newes, that Sir Frances Veare was yet liuing, &amp; on the mending hand; howbeit his hurt was very sore and daungerous.
