            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            A most breefe manner of Instruction, to the principles of Christian Religion.
            By I. F.
            
            Psal. 34. Come ye children, and I will teach you the feare of the Lord.
            1. Peter. 3.11. Let euerie one be ready to render an account of his Faith.
            Imprinted at London by Hugh Singleton.
         
         
            
            
            To the christian Reader, grace and peace in Christe.
            
               THe short memories and dull wits, of many to conceiue &amp; remember, the most briefe &amp; short sum of Christian ReligioÌ„, hath moued me to doo this worke; and that because I see &amp; perceiue by daily proofe and experience, that all meanes and waies assaied, yet hardlie we can preuaile to settle, or beate into the heads and hearts of youth, so necessarie a matter, as is the instruction to right vnderstanding of the principles of Religion.
            I haue heere therfore according to my capacitie and small skill, drawne out a few questions, with Aunsweres annexed and adioined, verie fitte for the simpler sorte, both of youth and age, that are so long and harde to learne. That it greeueth my heart to thinke howe carelesse and heedlesse, many, bothe young and olde be in so needfull a matter, as concernes their saluation.
            But the cause of so small effect taken of

many, is this, partly by the negligence both of Parentes and their youth, both children and seruauntes, the Parents slacknesse in sending them to the Ministers; and theyr carelesnesse when they doo come, and heedlesse hearts in hearing and regarding; and theyr mindlesnesse when the Ministers endeuour is in the best and plainest manner bestowed among them.
            And therefore, I praye God styrre vp the Magistrates hartes to haue more care of this so waighty a matter. And to see their articles concerning this point better executed and put in practise; as well for carelesse and heedlesse, and mindlesse youth, and ignoraunt aged persons; as for negligent Parentes, and Ministers, for the instruction of the one, and discharge of the other.
            
               Thine in the Lord. 
               I. F.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            A very breefe manner of Instruction, to the principles of Religion.
            
               Question.
               WHat meaneth this woord, Catechisme?
            
            
               Aunswer.
               It is as much as to say, a Christian Instruction.
            
            
               Q.
               What is the cheefe part of a Christian mans duetie?
            
            
               A.
               To knowe God.
            
            
               Q.
               By what meanes may we best knowe God?
            
            
               A.
               By his worde, and by his workes.
            
            
               Q.
               By what meanes, is Gods will best made knowne vnto vs?
            
            
               A.
               By these two parts of his word, namelie, the Lawe and the Gospell.
            
            
               Q.
               What learnest thou by the Lawe?
            
            
               A.
               I learne three thinges.
            
            
               Q.
               VVhich be they?
            
            
               A
               First, I learne my miserable, wretched and wofull estate, and my corrupt and most dampnable condicion by nature.
               Secondly, I learne thereby, both what

Gods will is I should doo, and what I ought to doo. And what Gods will is I should not doo, and so, what I ought not to doo.
               Thirdly, I am thereby taught, to flie to Christ for my saluation. Because I see nothing but condemnation in the Law, and the dexteritie, and righteousnesse thereof. And this is the summe and effect of Gods Lawe in generall.
            
            
               Q.
               Shew mee then the breefe sum of Gods Lawe in speciall?
            
            
               A.
               You meane the commaundements of almightie God, that he gaue vnto Moses in the mount.
            
            
               Q.
               Yea the same, how many be there?
            
            
               A.
               There be ten commaundements.
            
            
               Q.
               If you can, I pray you declare them?
            
            
               A.
               Yes that I can, they be the same which God spake in the xx. Chapter of Exodus, saying: Heare O Israel, I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the land of Egipt, out of the house of bondage.

                     1. Thou shalt haue none other Gods but mee.
                     2. Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any

grauen Image, nor the lykenesse of any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath, nor in the waters vnder the earth, thou shalt not bowe downe to them nor worship them, for I the Lord thy God am a gealous God, and visite the sinnes of the Fathers vpon the chyldren, to the third and sowrth generatioÌ„ of them that hate mee: &amp; shew mercie vnto thousandes, in them that loue mee and keepe my commaundements.
                     3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine, for the Lord will not holde him guiltlesse that taketh his name in vaine.
                     4. Remember thou keepe holy the Sabbaoth day: sixe daies shalt thou labour &amp; doo all that thou hast to doo, but the seueÌ„th day is the Sabaoth of the Lord thy God, in it thou shalt doo no manner of worke, thou and thy sonne, and thy daughter, thy man seruant, and thy maide seruant: thy thy cattaile, &amp; the straunger that is within thy gates. For in sixe dayes the Lord made heauen and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seueÌ„th day,

wherfore the Lord blessed the seuenth day and hallowed it.
                     5. Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy dayes may be long in the lande, which the Lord thy God giueth thee.
                     6. Thou shalt doo no murder.
                     7. Thou shalt not commit adulterie.
                     8. Thou shalt not steale.
                     9. Thou shalt not beare false witnesse against thy neighbour.
                     10. Thou shalt not couet thy neighbors house, thou shalt not couet thy neighbors wife, nor his seruaunt, nor his maide, nor his oxe, nor his asse, nor any thing that is his.
                  
               
            
            
               Q.
               How many Tables be there in these ten commaundements?
            
            
               A.
               There be two Tables.
            
            
               Q.

               How many in the second Table?
            
            
               A.
               There be sixe.
            
            
               Q.
               How many of these are commaunded to be done, and how many are forbidden not to be donne?
            
            
               
               A.
               There be two commaundements to bee doone: and eight forbidden to bee done.
            
            
               Q.
               Which be they that be commaunded to be done, and which not to be done?
            
            
               A.
               The 4. and 5. commauÌ„ded to be done, The 1 2. 3 of the first Table, And the 6.7. 8.9.10. of the second Table not to be done.
            
            
               Q.
               Rehearse them?
            
            
               A.
               1. The sowrth and last coÌ„maundemeÌ„t of the first Table, is commaunded to be done, namely: Remember thou keepe holie the Sabboth day, &amp;c.
               2. So is the fift commaundement, being the first of the second Table, namelie: Honour thy father and thy Mother, &amp;c.

               Q.
               So thou seest how fewe God coÌ„maunds to doo?
            
            
               A.
               Yea, and yet we doo them not. And how many forbidden, &amp;c. and yet we doo them.
            
            
               Q
               But what learnest thou by this?
            
            
               A.
               I learne and see hereby, two speciall things to be remembred.

                     1. First Gods fatherlie care, loue &amp; goodnesse towardes vs, in both warning vs, and teaching of vs: Both what he would haue done, and what he would not haue done. What we should doo, and what we should not doo.
                     2. Secondly againe, I see first how fraile and vntoward we are, either to doo that he commaundeth, or to forbeare that hee forbiddeth: such is our corrupt and sinful state and naughtie nature, and euill inclined

disposition.
                  
               
            
            
               Q.
               Then thou hast profited somthing hereby.
            
            
               A.
               Yea, I thanke God I know and haue learned, both how gratiously and mercifullie God hath dealt with vs in this, and all other his holy Scriptures. And how far we are from dooing his holy will, and how prone, ready, and foreward we are to doo the contrarie: euen our owne will and heart lusts and delights.

                     3. By the working of Gods holy spirit in our harts, in hearing of the same word, &amp; receiuing of the same Sacraments, &amp;c.
                  
               
            
            
               Q.
               What is the cheefest prayer, to obtaine all thinges at Gods hand by?
            
            
               A.
               The same which Christ hath taught vs, saying: when you pray, pray on this manner, &amp;c. Luk. II.
               
               O Our Father which art in Heauen.
               1. Halowed be thy name.
               2. Thy kingdome come.
               3. Thy will be doone in earth as it is in heauen.

               6. And lead vs not into temptation.
               But deliuer vs from euill. &amp;c.
            
            
               Q.
               How many partes are contained in the prayer.
            
            
               A.
               There be three partes in generall.

                     1. The preface.

                     3. The conclusion.
                  
               
               But two partes speciall, &amp;c.

                     1. The preface is, Our Father wich art in heauen.
                     2. The sixe peticions, be deuided into two partes in speciall.
                  
               
               The fyrst contayneth three peticions.
               The second coÌ„taineth other three peticions.
               The 1. coÌ„taining ye glorie of God.
               The 2 coÌ„taining ye necessity of meÌ„.
               The fyrst three bee,

                     1. Hallowed be thy name.
                     2. Thy kingdom come.
                     3. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaueÌ„.
                  
               
               This consernes the glorie of God.
               
                  The other three,

                     1. 4. Giue vs this day our daylie bread.
                     2. 5. And forgiue vs our trespasses, as we forgiue them that, &amp;c.

               These concernes the necessity of men.
            
            
               Q.
               Then I perceiue this beginning, Our Father which art in heaueÌ„: is but a preface or an entrance into the prayer, or a preparing Gods eare and our heartes therevnto, And so the end but a conclusion, yeelding all power and glorie to God?
            
            
               A.
               You saye verie truelie.
            
            
               Q.
               I see also, that you vnderstand both, what thou speakest, and also what thou prayest for?
            
            
               A.
               Yea, that I doo I thanke God, &amp; I giue you thankes also, for your freendly and Christian endeuour. And the Lord giue me grace to vse this prayer and all other, a right. And so hartelie, reuerently, faithfully, and vnfeinedly, as may be to Gods glorie and my comfort.
            
            
               Q.
               
                  Amen. The Lord graunt it to all men &amp;c.
            
            FINIS.
