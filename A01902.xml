            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

THE MUCH
HONOVRED
KNIGHT,
SIR
NATHANIEL RICH.
            
               SIR,
            
            
               GOd, who
from all
eternitie
hath had
an infinit
Maſſe of
grace and glory lying by
him, to beſtow upon his
Church: and did accordingly
provide a treaſury and
Magazin ſufficient wherein

to ſtore up all, [the Boſome
of his Sonne:] in whom
are hid,
               Epheſ. 3. 8. 
               riches ſo unſearchable,
as cannot bee
told over, much leſſe ſpent to
all eternity.
            Hee hath as richly ſhed
his holy Sprit on us:
                  
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   Tit. 3. 6. that
we, who could never have
known of any thing bequeathed
us, nor what to pray
for as wee ought, might
both, fully from him know
all that God hath given
us; and through him lay
claime thereto, who maketh
interceſſion for us;
and ſo doth furniſh us with
a privy key to all that Treaſury,
which otherwiſe, is faſt
ſhut up to all the world.
            Through which Spirit of
of prayer, and ſupplications
               
thus powred foorth,
beleevers come to bee at once
anointed to the fellowſhip,
and execution of thoſe
three glorious Offices of
Chriſt their head. Not only
1. of Prieſts; by offering
up their prayers, as ſpirituall
ſacrifices, acceptable
to GOD, through Jeſus
Chriſt: but 2. of Kings;
to rule with God, Hoſ. 11.
12. Being hereby made of
Privy Councell to the King
of kings,Pſa. 20. 4, 5 ſo as their Councels,
and deſires expreſt in
their Petitions, are ſaid to
be fulfilled; and their decrees
in their Praiers
made,
               Iob 22. 27, 28. ratified, and eſtabliſht.
Nay further, by vertue
of this priviledge, advanced
to ſuch height of favour,

               Hoſ. 12. 3, 4 as by their ſtrength
in praier alone, to have power
with God himſelfe;
and not onely with him, but
alſo over him; and in their
wreſtlings to prevaile:
Yea to command: Himſelfe
hath ſaid it; Thus ſaith
the Lord, the holy One of
Iſrael and his Maker,
ASKE of me, of things
to come, concerning my
ſonnes, and concerning
the worke of my hands,
COMMAND ye ME,
Iſai. 45. 11. which ſo tranſcendent
priviledge of power,
is likewiſe by the expreſſe
words of this great Charter,
univerſally extended unto all
tranſactions of this lower
part of his dominions; whether
Eccleſiaſticall, which

doe concerne his ſonnes,
that is, his Church: or what
ever other, the more ordinary
works of his hands,
that appertaine to common
providence.
            And for as much as theſe
grand affaires of this his
Kingdome,
               Mat. 6. 10. as future, and
to come, are commended to
their praiers, as their moſt
proper ſubject, about which
they are to treate, Aske of
mee of things to come:
in this reſpect, they doe become
as truely. 3. Prophets
alſo: though not in ſo full
and compleate, yet in ſome
kinde of true reſemblance;
not by foretelling, yet by
foreſpeaking in their prayers,
things that come to paſſe.
To demonſtrate which, God,

who made and upholds this
world, and all things in it,
by the word of his power,
doth likewiſe rule and governe
it, by the Preſidents,
and preſcript rules, of the
word of his will: exactly diſpenſing
unto men,Pſal. 25. 10. both rewards
and puniſhments, according
to the tenour of ſome
or other, of his promiſes and
threatnings, and former like
proceedings therein recorded:
though with ſuch various
liberty, in reſpect of
the particulars, that his
wayes remaine unſearchable
and paſt finding out:
That looke how he appointed
in the heavens, thoſe ordinances
of the Sunne, Moone,
and Starres, by their light,
heate, and motion, to rule
               
               the day and night, to divide,
and cauſe the ſeverall
ſeaſons of the yeare, and all
the changes and alterations
that doe paſſe over this animall,
and naturall world▪
in like manner hath hee
ſtretched out that ſo exceeding
broad expanſe of his
word and law,Pſal. 119. 96. (to which the
Pſalmiſt doth aſsimulate it)
over this rationall world,Pſal. 19. 1, 2, 3, 4. compared with Rom. 10. 18. of
Angels and Men; and
therein ſet his Statutes,
and his Judgements, that
by the light of Precepts, and
their influences in rewards
and puniſhments, they might
order and direct theſe his
creatures reaſonable, and all
their actions; alſo diſpoſe,
and ſet out all the iſſues of
them. And ſeeing his Saints
               
they are a people in whoſe
hearts is his Law; and
their delight is to meditate
therein, both day and
night, they daily calculating
and obſerving the various
aſpects, conjunctions, and
mixt influences of thoſe innumerable
precepts, promiſes,
and threatnings, which
themſelves and others, Nations
or Men, ſtand under;
and by a Judgement thence
reſulting,Ier. 8. 7. ſo farre as they
have attained, endeavouring
to frame their ſupplications
and petitions according
to Gods will: Hence
their praiers oft, full happily
ſucceed, and aforehand
doe accord, to thoſe iſſues and
events, that afterwards fall
out. That like as it ſometimes

falls out, that the
earth comes to bee juſt under
the Sun and Moone, in
ſome of their conjunctions;
ſo their deſires and praiers,
ſometimes in a direct line
fall under, and ſubordinately
concurre with Gods ſecret
purpoſes, and ſome revealed
promiſe met in conjunction,
to produce ſuch and ſuch effects.
The Spirit alſo, herein
helping their infirmities,
ſometime ſo guiding
and directing them, by a
gracious preinſtinct, though
unbeknowne to them, to pitch
their requeſts upon ſuch particulars,
as God hath fully
purpoſed to bring to paſſe;
becomming thereby, as it
were, the Spirit of prophecy
unto them; reſpectively, in

ſome meaſure and degree.
            Thus doth that great
King, imploy his neareſt ſervants,
as his under-Officers,
and Sherifes to ſerve his
Writs, &amp; executions upō his
Enemies; to execute the
Judgement written in his
threatnings, Pſalm. 149. 9.
and to accompliſh his mercies
written alſo; by putting
all the promiſes in ſuit; to be
as man-midwives (as Hezekiahs
alluſion, when hee
ſent a viſiting to the Prophet
Eſay,
               Eſay 37. 2, 3, 4. for his voice and ſuffrage,
ſeemeth to import) to
help and aſsiſt his promiſes
and decrees in their travell
with mercies and deliverance,
Zeph. 2. 2. when theſe their children
doe come unto the
birth, and there is no
               
               ſtrength to bring them
forth.
            
            In all which, they ſhall
therefore have the honour to
bee accounted Co-workers together
with God, in his greateſt
works of wonder. And
at the latter day, when that
great and laſt Edition, both
of all Gods works, and likewiſe
ours, then compleate
and finiſhed, ſhall be publiſhed
to all the world, they
ſhall finde their names put
to them, together with his
owne; and the ſame by him
acknowledged, to be as truely
the works of their hearts and
prayers, as that they are the
ſole worke of his hands and
power. Such honour have
all his Saints.
            
            And if all the workes of
               
               GOD are ſo exceeding
great, and his thoughts
therein ſo very deep, Pſal.
92. 5. that every Iota of
them, doth deſerve our deepeſt
ſtudies, and intentions;
and thereunto require a proper
skill and wiſedome, to
reade his hand, peculiar unto
the Saints, ver. 6. whereunto
there muſt be adjoined the
moſt diligent ſearch,
               Pſal. 77. 6. and
attentive obſervation to
finde out his meaning in
them; and withall a ſpeciall
inclination, and delight to
be converſant therein, Thy
workes are very great,
ſought out of thoſe that
have pleaſure in them,
Pſal. 111. 2. And if, of all
the reſt, thoſe choiſer pieces,
his workes of mercy may

challenge our beſt regard:
in which his heart and delights
are moſt;
               Mich. 7. 18. on which
his wiſedome hath laid on
the richeſt workmanſhip, in
the moſt curious contrivements
of his love: Then
ſurely that ſelected volume
of more ſpeciall mercies [His
Epiſtles:] vouchſafed in
anſwer to our prayers, is above
all other, moſt exactly
to be ſtudied, and moſt diligently
to bee peruſed by us.
Wherein God doth unboſome
himſelfe, and lay open
his heart, more ſweetly, more
familiarly unto us; which
are directed, and in a maner
dedicated more particularly
unto our ſelves alone; Many
of them written with his
owne hand, in a more immediate

maner diſcovered and
appearing in them: and all
of them come ſealed with
the impreſſe of everlaſting
love, and downe laden with
the encloſure of the moſt
precious tokens of his ſpeciall
favour.Pſ. 107. 43. 
               Who ſo is wiſe,
will obſerve theſe things;
and they ſhall underſtand
the loving kindneſſe of
the Lord.
            
            Neither have ſuch favours,
onely more of mercy
in the things themſelves beſtowed,
but are further indeared
to us, by being made
our owne mercies, by a
more peculiar title to them:
by which the kindneſſe in
them is rendred double. For
therein wee have that royall
liberty to become our owne

chooſers, and contrivers of
our owne condition; having
all the promiſes throwne
downe to us, with blanks for
us to write our names in
which of them wee pleaſe;
which is the greateſt liberty.
And Wee have withall his
Spirit ſecretly directing,
and fixing the needle of our
deſires, to the ſame point,
wherein his great intentions
towards us doe meete with
our beſt good: which is indeed
the trueſt liberty. And
to be made our ſelves, whom
we love ſo well, and therefore
delight to do good unto,
the chiefeſt inſtruments under
him of our owne greateſt
happineſſe, is a priviledge,
then which, the creature is
not made capable of a more

tranſcendent royalty. And
yet when the greateſt love,
thus rectified, which poſsibly
we can beare our ſelves, hath
opened its mouth wideſt,
and ſtretched our deſires in
praying, to their utmoſt compaſſe;
then will Gods infinite
vaſt love, not onely fill
them, but doe for us above
all that we are able to aſk,
yea to thinke; exceeding
abundantly above all; as
farr above, as his thoughts
are above our thoughts;
which is farre more then
the heavens are higher
then the earth.
            
            All which, when put together,
(if well conſidered,)
how would it provoke us to
call in all that precious ſtock
of our time, thoughts, and

intentions which wee caſt away
on trifles, to lay out the
choiſeſt portion of them in
this thriving trade of entercourſe
with God; the returnes
whereof, are better
then the merchandiſe of
ſilver, and the gaine therof,
then fine gold. It is the
praying Chriſtian that alone
imployes the riches of the
promiſes, which wee uſually
let lie by us like dead ſtocke
unimproved: whilſt hee,
like a wiſe and diligent
Merchant, looks abroad upon
all the affaires of Ieſus
Chriſt, that are afloat here
in this world, and adventures
in them all; is watchfull
to ſpy out all advantages,
and with an holie

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , intermedleth
               
               in every buſineſſe that
may bring in glory unto God,
good unto the Church, grace
and comfort to his owne
ſoule. And how infinitely
rich muſt that man needes
become, that puts even Gods
riches out to uſe, with the
increaſe of ten Talents for
one, yea an hundred fold!
            
            The due eſtimate whereof,
would no leſſe quicken us to
as diligent an inquiry, what
becomes of all thoſe goodly
adventures, the prayers we
make; to liſten what haven
they arrive at, how, and
when, and with what
fraught they doe returne.
            
            In which great duty, and
moſt neceſſary property of all
true Merchants, yet many
of the beſt and greateſt dealers,

that are diligent enough
in praying, are ſtill found
failing and deficient; that
omit no gainfull opportunity
of adventure, but are careleſſe
and unobſervant of
their returnes.
            
            
               Some through ignorance
(it may be) that this is at all
a duty, or of any ſuch importance,
are carefull onely
how to lade in praiers enough,
not expecting to finde any of
this bread caſt upon the
waters, untill that great
and generall returne of
themſelves, &amp; all the world,
with joy bringing their
ſheaves with them. Others,
though at preſent,
many of their praiers come
home after a few daies, and
richly laden; yet through

want of skill to reade thoſe
Bills of Exchange which
God often writes in an obſcurer
character, they lie unregarded
by them. Many
when voyages prove long,
(though to their greater advantage,
when once they doe
returne, yet in the meane
time) through diſcouragement,
they give all for loſt,
as we doe ſhips at Sea we cannot
heare of. The moſt are
commonly complaining, that
their adventures ſtill miſcary,
and that little or nothing
comes of all their prayers.
And All are negligent of
keeping their bookes of accounts,
to caſt up their commings
in, and goings out, the
one with the other. By which
they loſe the chiefeſt portion

of that comfort, which for
the preſent, God hath here
allotted us to live upon [the
revenues of their prayers.]
And God alſo, is not onely
robbed of that Cuſtome
of his glory which ſhould
thence accrew; but wronged
alſo by ſtanding ſtill as
debtor in their accounts to
many prayers, in the return
of which he hath been creditor
long agoe.
            I have endevoured therefore
in this ſmall Treatiſe to
convince beleevers of the
grand importance of this duty,
which is ſo full of gaine:
To diſcover likewiſe the
cauſes of the neglect herein,
and remove the temptations
and diſcouragements which
doe occaſion it; and have

briefly reſolved ſuch caſes
as doe more uſually occurre
in the practiſe of it. But
principally, my deſire was to
give in ſome few experiments,
and obſervations,
which may help to teach the
weaker ſort, though not perfectly
to reade, yet here and
there to ſpell, (and eſpecially
out of the impreſsions in
their own hearts) Gods meaning
towards them in his
anſwers. I have caſt in ſome
ſcattered calculations of
broken praiers caſt up, which
though they wil not amount,
to make generall and perfect
Tables out of, yet may
ſerve, as Inſtances and examples,
for yong beginners,
to direct them in the exerciſe
of this moſt uſefull skill,

and wiſedome, how to compute
and ballance their accounts
by comparing their
prayers and their returnes
together.
            This ſmall and imperfect
embryon, I have preſumed to
ſend forth into the world;
and directed it firſt of all to
preſent its ſervice unto you;
and make an honourable and
thankefull mention of your
Name. Your worth deſerves
a more coſtly, large, and laſting
monument for this inſcription.
Your owne abilities
of learning, eloquence,
and depth of wiſedome in
humane affaires, would you
be perſwaded to lay them out,
as you are able, would erect
ſuch a remembrance and
ſumptuous memoriall of

               you, when you are gathered
to your Fathers, as
would beare ſome proportion
to your great worth. But
that which emboldned me
was the neere affinity which
meditations of this nature
doe hold, with thoſe other
your more retired thoughts
you thinke to none but God
and your owne ſoule. You
have beene long a frequent
and conſtant dealer in this
bleſſed way of entercourſe
with God in private: Thoſe
that know you, know your
ſtrict obſervance of thoſe
exchange houres you have
devoted to meet with God,
and enjoy communion with
Him. But above all, it was
that perſonall obligation, under
which a great and ſpeciall

all favour from you long
ſince brought me, upon which
I devoted (with my ſelfe)
the firſt of my labours unto
your ſervice. And it became
one great reliefe unto
my thoughts, weighing the
many inconveniences of appearing
thus in publique,
that it gave ſo full occaſion
to pay my vowes thus openly
before all the world; which
having now done, God that
is rich in mercy to all that
call upon him, fill you with
all Grace, and grant all your
petitions; ſo prayes
            
               Your Worſhips
obliged to love
and ſerve you
THO: GOODVVIN.

PRAYERS.
            
               PSAL. 85. 8.
               I will heare what God the
Lord will ſpeake: for He
will ſpeake peace unto His
people, and to his Saints:
but let them not turne againe
to folly.
The Coherence of the words.
            
            
               THis Pſalme was
penned, in the
name and for the
comfort of the whole

Church of the Iewes, both
as a Prophecie of, and a
Prayer for their returne
out of the Babyloniſh Captivity,
and the flowing in
again of that ancient glory,
peace, adminiſtration
of Juſtice, liberty of Gods
Ordinances, plenty and
increaſe, which formerly
they enjoyed, but had
now ſuffered an ebbe of
ſeventy yeares continuance.
And firſt he beginneth
with Prayer, from
the firſt verſe to this wee
have in hand, putting the
Lord in minde of, and urging
Him with His graciour
dealings in former
times unto His Church:
this is not the firſt time
(ſaith he) that the Church

hath beene in Captivity,
and that thou haſt returned
it, (as out of Aegypt,
&amp;c.) and therefore wee
hope that thou wilt doe ſo
againe; Thou haſt beene favourable
unto thy Land, &amp;c.
His Prayer being finiſhed
and hee having ſpoke, he
now ſtands, and liſtens, as
you uſe to doe when you
expect an Eccho, what
Eccho hee ſhould have,
what anſwer would bee
returned from Heaven,
whither his Prayer had already
come, I will heare
what the Lord will ſpeake:
or as ſome reade it, I heare
what the Lord doth ſpeake:
for ſometimes there is a
preſent Eccho, a ſpeedy
anſwer returned to a

mans heart, even ere the
Prayer is halfe finiſhed, as
unto Daniel, Dan. 9. 20. 21.
And in briefe it is this,
The Lord will ſpeake peace
unto His people: this anſwer
hee findes written at
the bottome of the petition,
but with this clauſe
of admonition for time to
come, added, But let them
not returne againe to folly:
a good uſe to bee made of
ſo gracious an anſwer.
            
               
               
                  Chap. 1.CHAP. I.
               
                  The maine obſervation and
ſubject of this Diſcourſe
thence deduced: That
Gods people are diligently
to obſerve the
anſwers to their Prayers:
The reaſons of it.
               
               THeſe words being eſpecially
ſpoken in relation
to the anſwer of
God returned to his Prayer
made, therefore in that
relation I meane principally
to handle them.
               The obſervation is this;
That when a man hath put
up Prayers to God, hee is to
reſt aſſured, that God will
in mercy anſwer his Prayers,
                  
and to liſten diligently, and
obſerve how his Prayers are
anſwered: both are here
to bee obſerved. I will
heare what God will ſpeake,
that is, how Hee will accompliſh
them: and withall
he confidently expreſſeth
an aſſurance, that God
will ſpeake peace. Thus
doth the Church, Mich. 7.
7, 8. I will looke to the Lord,
I will wait, my God will
heare mee: Shee was both
ſure of gracious audience
with Him, my God will
heare me: and ſhe will wait
till hee anſwers her, and
obſerve how hee doth it,
I will looke to the Lord: and
verſ. 9. I will heare the indignation
of the Lord, till he
plead my cauſe. So Habakkuk,
                  
hee having made a
Praier againſt the Tyrannie
of Nebuchadnezzar, in
the firſt Chapter, having
ended it, hee begins the
ſecond Chapter thus, I
will ſtand upon my watch
tower, and ſee what hee will
anſwer mee:
                  The ſinfulneſſe of the neglect hereof demonſtrated by 7. reaſons. and in the end
an anſwer comes verſ. 2.
and as hee thus waited for
a Viſion (for ſometime
their Prophecies were in
anſwer to their prayers)
ſo ſhould wee for an anſwer
unto ours.
               1. Reaſon,
                     Reaſ. 1. Hereby an Ordinance of God is taken in vaine: which is Gods Name. becauſe otherwiſe
you take an Ordinance
of God in vain in
your hearts, which is to
take Gods Name (with
whom in that Ordinance
you deale) in vaine: for it

a ſigne you thinke your
prayer not an effectuall
meanes to attain that end
it is ordained for; and ſay
ſecretly in your hearts, as
they Iob 21. 15. What profit
have we, if we pray to him?
for if we uſe any meanes,
and expect not the end, it
is a ſigne wee thinke the
meanes vaine to accompliſh
that end. Whereas
every faithfull prayer is
ordained of God to bee a
meanes to obtaine what
wee deſire and pray for,
and is not put up in vain,
but ſhall have anſwer: 1.
Ioh. 5. 14, 15. This is the confidence
that we have in Him,
that if we aske any thing according
to His will, He heareth
us: tis true, God heareth

an enemy, but to
heare with favour, is the
hearing there meant; and
is ſo uſed in our ordinary
ſpeach, as we ſay of a Favourite,
that he hath the
Kings eare; and if a man
bee obſtinate to a mans
counſell, we ſay, hee would
not heare, though hee give
the hearing; ſo here, to
heare is a word of gracious
inclination to doe the
thing required; and thus
Gods eares are ſaid to bee
open to their prayers; and ſo
it followes there, that if
he heareth us, whatſoever we
aske, wee know that we have
the petitions that wee deſired
of Him. Aſſoone as wee
have prayed, wee are ſaid
to have our petitions, that is,

they are then granted, and
we may be confident they
are aſſented unto by God;
although in regard of
outward diſpenſation, the
command for accompliſhment
is not yet come
forth: even as a petitioner
is ſaid to have his ſuit,
when the word of the King
is gone forth that it ſhall be
done, though it paſſeth
not the ſeale, or bee not
ſigned a good while after.
And like as when a wicked
man ſinneth, aſſoone as
the act is committed, ſo
ſoone doth ſentence from
God goe forth againſt the
ſinner, but the Execution
overtakes him not (it may
bee) a good while after,
according to that of Solomon,

Sentence againſt an evill
doer is not preſently executed,
                  Eccleſ 7. 11 it is preſently ſentenced,
as the words imply,
but not executed: ſo in
like manner falleth it out,
when a godly man praies,
that as ſoone as the praier
arrives in Heaven (which
is in an inſtant) ſo ſoone
is the petition granted,
(So Dan. 9. at the beginning
of his praier the Command
came forth ver. 23. though
the Angel, who brought
the anſwer, arrived not at
him till towards the end
in the Evening, ver. 21.)
but the reall accompliſhment
of it may be deferred.
So as no prayer in reſpect
of an anſwer to it
is in vaine; but where

God hath given a heart to
ſpeake, Hee hath an eare
to heare, and love to returne
anſwer: which not
to regard, is to take an
Ordinance in vain, which
is Gods Name.
               And ſecondly,
                     Reaſ. 2. Wee take the Attributes of God in vaine. not ſimply
Gods name, as in an Ordinance
made knowne,
but alſo His name, that is,
His Attributes are taken
in vaine. For it is a ſigne
you thinke of that God
you pray to, that either
his eare is heavy, that hee
cannot heare: or his hand
ſhortned, that he cānot ſave:
or his heart ſtraitned, and
his bowels reſtrained, that he
will not: And thus you rob
him, and deſpoile him of
one of his moſt royall

Titles, whereby he ſtyles
himſelfe,Pſal. 65. 2. a God that heareth
prayers; who is ſo regardfull
of them, that in
the firſt of Kings 8. 59.
they are ſaid to be nigh the
Lord day and night, they
are all before him, and he
ſets them in his view, as
wee doe letters of friends
which wee ſticke in our
windows, that we may remember
to anſwer them;
or lay them not out of our
boſomes, that wee might
be ſure not to forget thē:
ſo the petitions of his
people, paſſe not out of
his ſight, till hee ſends an
anſwer, which is called
ſpeaking here; God ſpeaking
as well in his workes as in
his word. But you, by your

neglect herein, make an
Idoll God of him, ſuch as
were the vanities of the
heathen, as if hee had eares
and heard not, eyes and ſaw
not your need, &amp;c. Such a
God as Elias mockt, You
muſt ſpeak aloud, (ſaith he)
he may be in a journey, &amp;c.
Even ſuch a God doe you
make the God of heaven &amp;
earth to bee, whileſt you
put no more confidence
in him, or make no more
reckoning of your prayers
to him, then the heathens
did of their ſacrifices to
their Gods. Petitioners do
not onely put up their requeſts,
but uſe to wait at
great mens doores, &amp; enquire,
and liſten what anſwer
is given unto them;

and it is part of an honour
to great men that we doe
ſo: and for the ſame end
are wee alſo to waite on
God, As an acknowledgement
of his greatneſſe, and
our diſtance from him, and
dependance upon him; as
the eyes of the ſervants looke
to the hand of their Maſters,
                  Pſal. 123. 2
                  ſo doe we (ſaith David) on
thee, till thou haſt mercy on
us. And Pſalm. 130. after
he had prayed ver. 2. Hee
ſaith, hee waited more then
they that watch for the morning,
like thoſe that having
ſome great buſineſſe
to doe on the morrow,
long for the day light, and
looke often out to ſpy the
day, ſo hee for a glimmering,
and dawning of an

anſwer. The like we have
Pſal. 5. 3. In the morning
will I direct my prayer to
thee, and looke, that is, for
an anſwer.
               Againe,
                     Reaſ. 3. If God give an anſwer we make him ſpeake in vaine. 3. If God doth
give you an anſwer, if you
minde it not, you let God
ſpeake to you in vaine,
when you doe not liſten
to what hee anſwers: if
two men walke together,
and the one, when himſelfe
hath ſaid, and ſpoke
what hee would, liſtens
not, but is regardleſſe of
what the other anſwers,
hee exceedingly ſlights
the man: As non reſpondere
pro convitio eſt, not to
anſwer againe is contempt,
ſo non attendere, not
to attend to what one

ſayes: Now our ſpeaking
to God by prayers, and his
ſpeaking to us by anſwers
thereunto, and to ſtudy
out his dealings with us,
by comparing our praiers
and his anſwers together,
which are as Dialogues between
us and him, is one
great part of our walking
with God. It is ſaid of Samuels
prophecy,1. Sam. 3. 19. 
                  that not a
word of it fell to the ground:
and ſo it may bee ſaid of
our prayers; and ſo it
ought to bee of Gods anſwers,
not a word of them
ſhould fall to the ground: as
there doth, if you by your
obſervation, and liſtning
therunto catch them not
(as Benhadads ſervants are
ſaid to doe Ahabs words,)

apprehend, and obſerve
them not: &amp; by the ſame
reaſon, that you are to
obſerve the fulfilling of
Gods promiſes, you are of
your prayers alſo: now,
1. Kings 8. 56. it is ſaid,
not one word failed of all hee
promiſed, Solomon had obſerved
this by a particular
ſurvay, and regiſter made
of all that God had ſpoken
and done for them, and
found not a promiſe unperformed:
and there is
the like reaſon both of anſwers
to prayers, (for prayers
are but putting promiſes
into ſuite;) and for our
obſerving of them: and
therefore Salomon brings
thoſe words in there, to
this very purpoſe, to confirme

firme their faith in this,
that no prayers made,
would faile, being grounded
on a promiſe, thereby
o encourage others, and
his owne heart to diligence
herein, as alſo as a
motive unto God to hear
him; for verſ. 59. hee inferres
upon it, Let my
words be nigh thee, &amp;c. Seeing
thou alwaies thus performeſt
thy good word
unto thy people.
               4. Yea,
                     Reaſ. 4. God may be provoked not to anſwer at all. you will provoke
the Lord not to anſwer
at all, he will forbear
to anſwer, becauſe hee
ſees it will be thus in vain.
When a man is talking to
one that liſtens not to
him, hee will ceaſe to anſwer,
and leave off ſpeaking,

and ſo will God. So as
that which the Apoſtle
ſaith of faith,
                  Heb. 10. 36. that it is not
enough to beleeve, but when
you have done the will of
God, you have need of patience
to eke out faith, that
you may inherit the promiſes,
may bee alſo ſaid, and
is alike true of praying:
it is not enough to pray,
but after you have prayed,
you have need to liſten
for an anſwer, that
you may receive your
prayers; God will not fulfill
them elſe. As he ſaid,
the Sermon was not done,
when yet the Preacher
had done, becauſe it is not
done, till practiſed: ſo our
prayers are not done,
when yet made, but you

muſt further waite for,
and attend the accompliſhment.
               5. If you obſerve not
his anſwers,
                     Reaſ. 5. We ſhall not return thankes to God for hearing us. how ſhall you
bleſſe God, and returne
thankes to him for hearing
your prayers: Pſal.
116. 1, 2. I love the Lord,
becauſe hee hath heard my
voice, and my ſupplication,
and therefore he goes on
to thanke him, throughout
the whole Pſalme.
You are to watch unto prayer
with thankſgiving:
                  Col. 4. 2. and
therefore, as to watch, to
obſerve, and recollect
your owne wants, which
you are to pray for, that
you may have matter of
requeſts to put up, ſo alſo
to obſerve Gods anſwers

for matter of thankeſgiving;
and many fill that
common place head full
of matter, to furniſh them
for petitioning, but as for
this other of thankeſgiving,
they watch not unto
it againſt they come to
pray, nor ſtudy matter for
that head alſo; and if any
ſtudy will furniſh you this
way, it is the ſtudying out
of Gods anſwers to your
prayers: The reaſon you
pray ſo much, and give
thankes ſo little, is, that
you minde not Gods anſwers:
you doe not ſtudy
them. When we have put
up a faithfull prayer, God
is made our debtor by
promiſe, and wee are to
take notice of his payment,

and give him an acknowledgement
of the
receipt of it, hee loſeth of
his glory elſe.
               6. As God loſeth,
                     Reaſ. 6. We loſe much experience. ſo
your ſelves alſo the experience
which you might
get hereby.1. Of Gods faithfulnes to us. 1. Both experience
of GOD and his
faithfulneſſe, which will
cauſe in you, hope and
confidence in God another
time, when you have
found him againe and
againe anſwering your
prayers. It was a ſpeech
of one eminent in holineſſe,
upon occaſion of the
accompliſhmēt of a great
requeſt made to God by
him, That God having never
denied him any requeſt,
I have tryed God

                  often, now (ſayes he) henceforth
I will truſt him; if the
hearing the prayers of another,
will encourage us
to goe to God, (as Pſal. 33.
5. For this cauſe ſhall every
one that is godly pray unto
thee) much more when
we obſerve, and have experience
that our owne
are heard: Therefore
(ſayes David) Pſal. 116.
1, 2. The Lord hath heard
me, and I will call upon him
as long as I live: as if hee
had ſaid, Now that God
hath heard mee, now I
know what to doe: this
experiment, if I had no
more, is enough to encourage
me for ever to pray
unto God: I have learned
by it to call upon him,

as long as I live. And alſo
2. by obſerving Gods anſwers
to your prayers,2. Of our owne hearts and wayes towards him.
you will gaine much inſight
into your own harts,
and wayes, and prayers;
and may thereby learne
how to judge of them. So
Pſal. 66. 18, 19. Davids anſurance
that he did not regard
iniquity in his heart,
was ſtrengthned by Gods
having heard his prayers:
for thus he reaſons, If I regard
iniquity in my heart,
God will not heare me: But
God hath heard me. For 1.
if God doth not grant
your petitions, it will put
you to ſtudy a reaſon of
that his dealing: &amp; ſo you
will come to ſearch into
your prayers, and the carriage

of your hearts therein,
to ſee whether you did
not pray amiſſe; according
to that, Ye luſt &amp; have not,
becauſe ye aske amiſſe, Iames
4. 3. As if you ſend to a
friend, who is punctuall in
that point of friendſhip
of returning anſwers, and
uſeth not to faile, and you
receive no anſwer from
him, you will beginne to
thinke there is ſomething
in it: And ſo alſo here,
When a Petition is denied,
you will be jealous of
your ſelves, &amp; inquiſitive,
What ſhould be the matter,
and ſo by that ſearch
come to ſee that in your
prayers, which you will
learne to mend the next
time. Or 2. if they be anſwered,

yet becauſe that
therein uſually God deales
in a proportion with you
to your prayers, (as you
might perceive if you
would obſerve his dealings
with you) you would
by this meanes come to
have much inſight into
Gods acceptation, and opinion
of your wayes:
For you ſhould ſee His
dealings with you, and
yours with Him, to be exceeding
parallel and correſpondent,
and hold proportion
each with other.
So Pſal. 18. 6. In my diſtreſſe
I called upon the Lord, and
ſo verſe 7, 8, &amp;c. hee goes
on to deſcribe his deliverance
which was the fruit
of thoſe prayers, and then

at 20, 21. verſes, &amp;c. hee
addes his obſervation upon
both, According to the
cleanneſſe of my hands hath
he dealt with mee, &amp;c. For
with the pure thou ſhalt ſhew
thy ſelfe pure.
               
               7. You will loſe much
of your comfort:
                     Reaſ. 7. We ſhall loſe much comfort. there is
no greater joy than to ſee
prayers anſwered, or to
ſee ſouls converted by us,
Iohn 16. 24. Aske and you
ſhall receive, that your joy
may be full: the receiving
anſwers makes joy to abound
and overflow. Yea,
even when we pray for others,
if our prayers be anſwered
for them, our joies
are exceeding great; much
more when in our owne
behalfe: and therein, even

in the ſmalleſt things
which a Chriſtian doth
enjoy, doth his comfort
exceed anothers, that hee
hath them by vertue of
prayers, and promiſes: he
knowes how hee came by
them; If ſtolne waters bee
ſweet, And bread eaten in
ſecret,
                  Pro. 9. 17. 
                  &amp;c. (as Solomon ſaies)
to wicked men; beg'd meat
is much more ſweet to godly
men: yea, in the very
praying for outward mercies,
there is more ſweetneſſe,
than they have in
enjoying them. As it is
joy to a good heart to ſee
any one converted, but
much more to him that
is the meanes of it. I have
no greater joy (ſaies S. Iohn)
then that my children walke

in truth: So to ſee God
doe good to his Church,
and heare others prayers
is a comfort, but much
more to ſee him do it at a
mans own praiers. Therefore
when God reſtores
comfort to a drooping
ſoule, he is ſaid, Eſay 57. To
reſtore comfort alſo to his
mourners, that is, to thoſe
that prayed and mourned
for him, as well as unto
that ſoule it ſelfe, it being
a comfort to them to
ſee their praiers anſwered.
Comfort it is many
wayes:  The heare from
God; as to heare from a
friend, though it bee but
two or three words, and
that about a ſmall matter,
if there be at the bottome

this ſubſcription, Your loving
Father, or, Your aſſured
friend, it ſatisfies abundantly:
ſo alſo,  To know
that God is mindfull of us,
accepts our works, fulfills
his promiſes:  How doth
it rejoice one to find another
of his mind in a controverſie:
but that God and
we ſhould be of one mind,
and concurre in the deſire
of the ſame things;Mat. 18. 19. 
                  not two
in the earth onely agree, but
God who is in heaven and
we to agree, this rejoiceth
the heart exceedingly.
And thus it is when a man
perceives his prayer anſwered.
Therfore you loſe
much of your comfort in
bleſſings, when you do not
obſerve anſwers to your
prayers.
            
            
               
               
                  Chap. 2.CHAP. 2.
               
                  Three caſes propounded: The
firſt, concerning prayers
for the Church, and for
the accompliſhment of
ſuch promiſes as may fall
out in ages to come.
               
               NOw as for rules, and
helps to find out Gods
meaning towards you in
your prayers, and to ſpie
out anſwers; and how to
know when God doth any
thing in anſwer to your
prayers, this is the next
thing to bee handled:
wherein firſt, I will anſwer
ſome caſes, and queries
which may fall out in
ſeverall ſorts of prayers,

about the anſwering of
them▪
               
               1 As firſt, concerning
prayers put up for the
Church, for the accompliſhment
of ſuch things
as fall out in Ages to
come.
               2 Concerning praiers
made for others of your
friends, kinred, &amp;c.
               3 Concerning thoſe
praiers, whether for your
ſelves or others, wherein
others joine with you.
               For the firſt.§. 1. The full anſwer to ſuch prayers is to come. Firſt, there
may bee ſome prayers,
which you muſt bee content,
never your ſelves
to ſee anſwered in this
world; the accompliſhment
of them not falling
out in your time: ſuch as

are thoſe you haply make
for the calling of the Iews,
the utter downfal of Gods
enemies, the flouriſhing
of the Goſpel, the full purity
and liberty of Gods
Ordinances, the particular
flouriſhing and good
of the ſociety and place
you live in: all you whoſe
hearts are right, doe treaſure
up many ſuch praiers
as theſe, and ſowe much of
ſuch precious ſeed, which
you muſt bee content to
have the Church (it may
be) in after Ages to reape:
All which prayers are not
yet loſt, but will have anſwers:
for as God is an eternall
God, and Chriſts righteouſneſſe
an everlaſting righteouſneſſe,
and therefore of

                  eternall efficacie, Dan. 9. 24
Being offered up by the eternall
Spirit, Heb. 9. 14. So are
prayers alſo, which are the
worke of the eternall Spirit
of Chriſt, made to that
God in his Name, and in
him are eternally accepted,
and of eternall force,
and therefore may take
place in after Ages. So the
prayer that S. Stephē
                   made
for his perſecutors, tooke
place in Saul when S. Stephen
was dead. So Davids
prayer againſt Iudas, Pſal.
109. 8, 9. took effect above
a thouſand yeeres after, as
appeares, Acts 1. 20. So
the prayers of the Church
for three hundred yeeres
in the Primitive times,
That Kings might come to

the knowledge of the truth,
and they leade peaceable and
quiet lives in all godlineſſe
and honeſty, (which S. Paul
in Nero's time exhorted
unto, 1. Tim. 2. 2.) were not
anſwered, &amp; accompliſhed
till Conſtantines time,
whē the Church brought
forth a Man-childe.Revel. 12 1▪
                   So
Eſay 58. after hee had exhorted
to, and given directions
for faſting &amp; prayer
in a right manner, hee
adjoyneth this promiſe:
Thou ſhalt raiſe up the
foundation of many generations;
thou ſhalt be called the
repairer of the breach, namely
for this, becauſe his faſting,
and prayers might
have influence into many
ages yet to come, in the

accompliſhment of what
was prayed for. And that
which Chriſt ſaies of the
Apoſtles, reaping the fruit
of S. Iohn the Baptiſts miniſtery,
and the ſeed he
had ſowne, is in like maner
herein verified; Iohn
4. 37. One ſoweth and another
reapeth. And in this
ſenſe that which the Papiſts
ſay is true, that there
is a common treaſury of
the Church, not of their
merits, but of their praiers:
there are bottles of teares a
filling, Vials a filling to be
powred out for the deſtruction
of Gods enemies:
what a collection of prayers
hath there been theſe
many Ages towards it?
and that may bee one reaſon

why God will do ſuch
great things towards the
end of the world, even
becauſe there hath beene
ſo great a ſtock of prayers
going, for ſo many ages,
which is now to be returned:
and herein it falls out
to us in our prayers, as in
their prophecies to the Prophets
of old,1. Pet. 1. 11▪
                   
                  The Spirit in
them did ſignifie the ſufferings
of Chriſt, and the glory
that ſhould follow. Vnto
whom it was revealed, that
not unto themſelves, but unto
us they did miniſter the
things that are now revealed:
and thus is it in the
ſpirit of prayer, which is inſtead
of the ſpirit of prophecy:
for wee pray through
the guidance of the Spirit

(who teacheth us what to
aske) for many things that
come to paſſe in after
ages.
               Onely at preſent,§. 2. Yet they may have an anſwer at preſent, in aſſurāce both that they ſhall come to paſſe, and of the acceptation of our perſons for them. it
may bee, in prayer thou
haſt revealed unto thee by
a ſecret impreſſion made
on thy ſpirit, that theſe
things ſhall come to paſſe,
and ſo haſt thy faith confirmed
in them, and withall
an evidence, that even
for thy prayers, among others,
God will performe
them; and that the contribution
of thy prayers,
doth help to make up the
ſumme: and upon ſuch
prayers God uſually for
the preſent alſo teſtifies
the acceptation of a mans
perſon, and reveales himſelfe

moſt to him that hee
is his; as he did to Moſes;
he never revealed his love
to Moſes more, then when
he praied moſt for Gods
people. And haply thou
haſt that as one of thy beſt
evidences of the uprightneſſe
of thy heart, that
thou canſt pray for the
Churches good, though
for a long time to come
which thou maieſt never
behold with thine eyes
even as David alſo did,
and rejoyced in it.§. 3. And in heaven we ſhall rejoyce at the accompliſhment of them: and at the day of Judgement▪
                  
               
               And when they are accompliſhed, and thou in
heaven, thy joy will ſurely
bee the more full for
theſe thy praiers: as at
the converſion of thoſe
thou haſt prayed for, ſo at

the ruine of the Churches
enemies, &amp;c. whom thou
didſt pray againſt; For if
there bee joy in heaven at
the converſion of a ſinner,
(as at the birth of a new
Prince and Heire of heaven)
then haply in a proportion
hee ſhall rejoyce
moſt, whoſe prayers had
moſt hand in it, and a ſpeciall
intereſt therein. And
ſo as thy other workes, ſo
thy prayers follow thee, and
the fruit of them,
                  Ier. 17. 10. as Ieremy
ſpeakes: and how ever,
yet at the day of Judgement
thou ſhalt rejoice, as
well as they that enioyed
the fruit of thy prayers in
their times, thou having
ſowne the ſeed of their
happineſſe; both hee that

ſowes, and hee that reapes
ſhall then rejoyce together, as
Chriſt ſayes, Iohn 4. 36.

                  The ſecond Caſe, concerning
prayers made for others:
of our friends, &amp;c. How
they are anſwered?
               
               THe ſecond caſe is, concerning
anſwers to our
prayers for others, for
particular men, as friends,
and kinred, &amp;c. and likewiſe
for temporall bleſſings.
               Pray for others you
know wee muſt:Pray for others wee ought. ſo the
Elders of the Church for

thoſe that are ſick, Iam. 5.
15, 16. Pray one for another,
ſayes S. Iames: as in
caſe a man is troubled
with a luſt, tell ſome private
friend of it, Confeſſe
your ſins one to another; that
when a mans owne prayers
are not ſtrong enough
to caſt it out, it may bee
done by the help of anothers
praiers joyned with
his. (So it followes, That
yee may bee healed, ver. 16.
For in that ſenſe I underſtand
healing, in ver. 16.)
So alſo, 1. Iohn 5. 16. If a
man ſee his brother ſin a ſin,
which is not unto death, that
is not againſt the Holy
Ghoſt, hee ſhall aske life for
him, and God ſhall give him
life, that ſins not unto death.
               
               
                  
Concerning this caſe I
give theſe conſiderations,
how ſuch prayers are anſwered.
               1. Conſideration.§. 1. Such prayers for others God often granteth. Such
prayers God often heareth;
why elſe are any
ſuch promiſes made? as
That they ſhall bee healed in
their bodies, James 5. 15.
Healed of their luſts, ver. 16.
Converted to life, 1. Ioh. 5.
16. God hath made theſe
to encourage us to pray,
and to teſtifie his abundant
love to us; that it ſo
overflowes and runs over,
that he will heare us, not
onely for our ſelves, but
for others alſo: which is
a ſigne we are in extraordinary
favour. So God intimates
concerning Abraham,
                  
to Abimelech, Gen.
20. 7. He is a Prophet, and he
ſhall pray for thee, and thou
ſhalt live: and as he was a
Prophet, ſo wee are Prieſts;
as for our ſelves, ſo for others
alſo, to God our Father:
and it is a prerogative
we have through the
fellowſhip wee have, and
communion of Chriſts
Prieſtly office,
                  Revel. 1. 6. 
                  who hath
made us Kings and Prieſts,
to prevaile and intercede
for others; and a ſpeciall
token and pledge of extraordinary
love. For if
God heares a mans prayers
for others, much more
for himſelfe in his owne
behalfe. So when Chriſt
healed the man ſick of the
palſie, it was, as it is ſaid,

                  For the faith of the ſtanders
by, Matth. 9. 2. Hee ſeeing
their faith, ſaid, Thy ſinnes
are forgiven thee; the meaning
is, not as if for their
faith ſake he forgave that
man his ſins,Hab. 2. 4. for, The juſt
doth live by his (owne)
faith: but to encourage
them, who out of faith
brought that ſick man to
him; and us all in like maner
to bring others, and
their plaints, by prayer,
before him; he therefore
then tooke occaſion to
declare and pronounce
forgiveneſſe to that poore
man;§. 2. hee therefore then
ſaid,Yet alwaies they do not prevaile for the parties prayer for. 
                  Thy ſinnes are forgiven
thee.
               
               2. Conſideration: yet
ſecondly, prayers for others

may often alſo not
obtaine the particular
thing prayed for them.
So Samuels prayer for
Saul, 1. Sam. 15. 35. So David
for his enemies, Pſalm.

                        •
                     7. 13.
               For it is in this,The reaſon. as it is

                     •
                  n the uſe of other means
and ordinances for the
good of others; God making
ſuch like kinde of
promiſes to our prayers
herein, as hee hath made
to our endeavours to convert
when wee preach to
men: that looke as wee
preach to many, and yet
but few beleeve,Rom. 10. 16. for, Who
hath beleeved our report?
even as many as are ordained
to eternall life; wee become
all to all, and winne but

ſome: So we pray for many,
not knowing who are
ordained to eternall life,
which whileſt wee know
not, wee are yet to pray
for them, 1. Tim. 2, 3, 4.
Onely as where God hath
ſet his Ordinance of Preaching,
it is more then a
probable ſigne hee hath
ſome to convert, and
uſually the word takes among
ſome, though often
but a few: So when hee
hath ſtirred up our hearts
to pray for others, it is a
ſigne God will heare us
for ſome of thoſe we pray
for: yet ſo as we may be
denied. For God doth require
it as a duty on our
parts, becauſe it is an outward
meanes ordained by

God, by which ſometimes
Hee uſeth to bring things
to paſſe: but yet not as ſuch
a certaine, and infallible
meanes, as hee hath tied
himſelfe univerſally unto,
to bring the thing to paſſe
on his part.
               And though indeed his
promiſe to heare and accept
the praier is generall
and univerſal:Such promiſes to hear us for others, being but indefinite, not univerſall. yet the promiſe
to heare it, by granting
the very thing it ſelfe
praied for, is but an indefinite
promiſe; ſuch as he
makes to other meanes
of doing men good, as to
our admonitions and reproofes,
and to our preaching,
&amp;c. Hee makes ſuch
promiſes, becauſe ſometimes
hee doth heare and convert

by them. For inſtance, that
promiſe, Iam. 5. 15. of healing
the ſick, cannot be univerſall:
for it might then be
ſuppoſed as a truth implied
in it, that ſick men
might never die, whē as it
is appointed for all men once
to die,
                  Heb. 9. 27. ſeeing it may bee
ſuppoſed that the Elders
may at all ſuch times of
danger of death ſtil come
and pray with them: but
the meaning is, that it is
an Ordinance, which God
hath made a gracious promiſe
unto, becauſe he often
doth reſtore the ſick
at their praiers: and therefore
upon every ſuch particular
occaſion, wee are
to rely upon God for the
performance of it, by

an act of recumbencie;
though with an act of full
aſſurance that we ſhall obtain
it, we cannot; the promiſe
being not univerſall,
out indefinite.
               Of the like nature are all
other promiſes of things
temporall and outward,Illuſtrated by the like tenour of all promiſes of things temporall.
(of which wee herein
ſpeak) as when God promiſeth
to give long life to
them that honour their parents;
riches and honours to
them that feare Him; the
tenour and purport of
which promiſes is not, as
if abſolutely, infallibly, &amp;
univerſally God doth alwayes
performe theſe to
thoſe that are yet truely
qualified with the conditions
ſpecified in thoſe

promiſes; The contrary
both Scripture, inſtances,
and common experience
ſhewes: they are therefore
indefinitely meant, and ſo
to bee underſtood by us;
for, becauſe when ever
God doth diſpenſe any
ſuch mercies to any of
his, hee would doe it by
promiſe; All his wayes to
His being truth, that is, the
fulfilling of ſome truth
promiſed; and alſo God
having purpoſed in his
outward diſpenſation of
things here in this world,
to beſtow riches and honours
upon ſome that
fear him, (though not upon
al, for how then ſhould
all things fall alike to all?
                  Eccleſ. 7. 2.
Poverty and cotempt upon

them that feare God,
even as well as thoſe that
feare him not.) Hee hath
therefore indefinitely expreſſed
His gracious diſpenſation
herein:The faith towards them required to be but an indefinite act of recumbency not of aſſurance. requiring
anſwerably an act of
ſaith (which principle in
us is ſuited to a promiſe,
as a faculty is to its proper
object) ſuitable to that his
meaning in the promiſe;
That as hee intended not
in ſuch promiſes an abſolute,
infallible, univerſall
obligation of himſelfe to
the performance of them
to all that feare him: ſo
the act of faith which a
man is to put forth toward
this promiſe, in the
application of it for his
owne particular, is not required

to be an abſolute,
infallible perſwaſion, and
aſſurance that God will
beſtow theſe outward
things upon him, having
theſe qualifications in
him; but onely an indefinite
act (as I may ſo call it)
of recumbency and ſubmiſsion;
caſting and adventuring
our ſelves upon him
for the performance of it
to us, not knowing but he
may in his outward diſpenſations
make it good
to us, yet with ſubmiſſion
to His good pleaſure,
if otherwiſe Hee diſpoſeth
it.Though of aſſurance to the promiſe in generall, yet not in the application of it.
               
               It is true indeed, that
that act of generall aſſent,
which faith is to give to
this promiſe in the generall

abſtract truth of it, is
to bee an aſſured certaine
perſwaſion and beleefe,
that God hath made this
promiſe, and that He certainely
will, and doth performe
it unto ſome according
to his purpoſe expreſſed
therein; which act
of generall aſſent, is that
beleeving without wavering,
namely of the truth
of the promiſe in general,
which S. Iames calls for in
prayer, Iam. 1. 6. But yet
that ſpeciall act of application
(as Divines call it) required
in this faith, wherby
I am to reſt upon it,
for my owne particular, is
not required to be ſuch an
undoubted perſwaſion, as
to thinke that I ſhall certainly

have this particular
promiſe in kinde fulfilled
to me; for the truth, purpoſe,
and intent of the
promiſe, is not univerſall,
but indefinite. So as it is
but an it may bee (as God
elſewhere expreſſeth ſuch
promiſes, as Zeph. 
                        •
                     . 1, 2.)
That it ſhal be performed
to mee: and yet becauſe
it may be God wil perform
it unto mee, therefore my
duty is to caſt my ſelf upon
God, and put in for
it, with ſubmiſſion to His
good pleaſure for the performance
of it to me. So
that ſo farre as the truth
and intent of it, is revealed
to be infallible &amp; certain,
ſo far a man is bound
to have an anſwerable act

of faith, of certaine and
infallible perſwaſion towards
it, as to beleeve
without wavering that
God hath made ſuch a
promiſe, and will perform
it according to His intent
in making it, which is unto
ſome: but yet withall becauſe
the tenour of it is
but indefinite, and in that
reſpect, whether it ſhal be
performed to mee or no,
is not therein certainely
revealed; Therefore God
requires not of mee in the
application of ſuch a promiſe,
an abſolute full perſwaſion
that He will performe
it to mee in ſuch or
ſuch a manner, &amp;c. But
only an act of dependance
and adherence with referring

it to his wiſe and
righteous good pleaſure
towards me.
               And yet againe if God
ſhould at any time give a
man ſuch a ſpeciall faith
concerning any ſuch particular
temporall bleſſing
for himſelfe or another,Yet when God ſometimes gives a ſpeciall faith, then we are to bee aſſured the thing ſhall bee done.
then hee is bound to beleeve
it thus in particular:
as when Hee gave power
to any to work miracles,
(as to his Apoſtles Hee
did, with a Commiſſion
to work them,) then they
were bound to beleeve
that ſuch and ſuch a miracle
ſhould infallibly bee
wrought by them; as that
the Devils ſhould be caſt
out by them, &amp;c. And
therefore in this caſe

Chriſt rebukes His Diſciples,
for not beleeving
thus upon ſuch particular
occaſions, Matth. 17. 20.
And then it is alſo true,
that if God give ſuch a
faith, Hee will infallibly
perform it: and thus thoſe
his words are to bee underſtood,
Matth. 27. 22.
Whatſoever yee aske in faith
beleeving,
                  An objection prevented. 
                  yee ſhall receive,
hee ſpeakes it of the faith
of miracles, for 21. ver. he
had ſaid, If ye beleeve and
doubt not, yee ſhall ſay to this
Mountaine, remoove into the
ſea, and it ſhall be remooved:
ſo that, when God works
ſuch a faith, and wee are
called to it, we are bound
to beleeve with a certain
perſwaſion that ſuch a

thing will be done, and it
ſhall bee done: but unto
ſuch a kinde of ſpeciall
faith in temporall promiſes
for our ſelves or others,
God doth not now
alwayes call us. If indeed
at any time wee did beleeve
and doubted not, by
reaſon of a ſpeciall faith
wrought by God, that
GOD would remove a
mountaine into the Sea,
or beſtow any outward
mercy, it ſhould be done:
for he that ſtirred up ſuch
a faith, would accompliſh
the thing: but it is not
that, which God requires
of beleevers, that they
ſhould without doubting
thus beleeve concerning
outward things; the promiſes

thereof being not
univerſall, but indefinite;
and therefore anſwerably
a man is not abſolutely
bound to beleeve that
God wil certainly beſtow
ſuch a temporall bleſſing
on him, no not though he
ſhould have the qualification,
which the promiſe
being not univerſal, made

                     •
                  o all ſo qualified, but indefinite
to ſome of ſuch ſo
qualified. The caſe is the
ſame of beleeving promiſes
made to our praying
for others, which is the
thing in hand.
               
                  §. 3. Such prayers for others are often returned into our own boſome.3. When the prayers

                     •
                  re thus made out of concience
of our duty for
ſuch, whom yet God doth

not intend that mercy unto,
then they are returned
againe into our owne boſomes
to our advantage:
even as S. Paul ſaith, that
his rejoycing that others
preached, though they loſt
their labour, ſhould turne
to his ſalvation, Phil. 1. 20.
So prayers for others,
though to the parties
themſelves we prayed for
they prove in vaine, yet
they turne to our good
So Pſalm. 35. 12, 13. When
his enemies were ſick, David
he praied and humbled himſelfe;
and my prayers (ſaies
he) returned into my boſome
David did by this his
prayer in ſecret for his
enemies, teſtifie the ſincerity
of his heart to God

and his true forgiveneſſe
of them (for it is the uſuall
diſpoſition of Gods children,
to pray for them
that are the greateſt enemies
to them,) and this
prayer though it did not
profit them, yet it turned
to Davids owne good, it
came back, and home againe
to him, with bleſſings
to himſelfe; God delighting
in, and rewarding
ſuch a diſpoſition in his
childe, as much as any other;
The Reaſon. becauſe therein we
reſemble Chriſt ſo truely,
and ſhew that God is our
Father, and our ſelves to
have his bowels in us; and
God ſtirreth up this praying
diſpoſition in his children
for their enemies,

not alwaies that he means
to heare them for them,
but becauſe he meanes to
draw forth, and ſo have
an occaſion to reward
thoſe holy diſpoſitions,
which are the nobleſt
parts of his image in them
and wherewith hee is ſo
much delighted; and ſo
their prayers returne into
their owne boſome, and
it is taken, as if they had
prayed for themſelves all
that while. Thus in like
maner, when Moſes prayed
ſo earneſtly for the
people of Iſrael, God offered
to returne his prayer
into his owne boſome,
and doe as much for him
alone, as hee had deſired
that God would doe for

them.Exod. 32. 10. 
                  I will make of thee a
great Nation (ſaies God to
him) for whom I will doe
as much for thy ſake, as
thou haſt prayed I ſhould
doe for theſe. As in
preaching the Goſpel,
Chriſt told the Diſciples,
That if in any houſe they
came to preach peace,
there were not a Sonne of
peace, Luke 10. on whom
the meſſage might take
place, and their peace reſt,
Your peace (ſaies hee) ſhall
returne unto you againe. So
is it, if your prayers take
not place.
               
                  §. 4. Good often in the end caſts ſuch out of our prayers hee intends not to heare us for.4. If wee have prayed
long for thoſe, whom God

                     •
                  ntends not mercy unto,
hee will in the end caſt
them out of our prayers

and hearts, and take our
hearts off from praying
for them. That which he
did by a revelation from
heaven to ſome Prophets
of old, as to Samuel and
Ieremiah, the ſame hee
doth by a more undiſcerned
worke; that is, by
withdrawing aſſiſtance to
pray for ſuch; by withdrawing
the ſpirit of ſupplication
from a man, for
ſome men, and in ſome
buſineſſes. Now thus he
did with Samuel; Why doſt
thou mourne for Saul?
                  The Reaſon.
1. Sam. 16. 1. So with Ieremiah,
Jer. 7. 16. Pray not
for this people: and this he
doth, becauſe he is loath
when his people doe pray
but to heare them; and

would not that ſuch precious
breath as that of
prayer is, ſhould bee without
its full and direct ſucceſſe,
or be in vaine: therefore
when he meanes not
to heare, he layes the key
of prayer out of the way,
ſo deſirous is hee to give
anſwers to every prayer.
It falls out in this caſe of
praying for another, as in
reproving another. One
whom God intends not
good unto, God will lock
up a mans heart towards
ſuch a man, that hee ſhall
not bee able to reprove
him, when towards another
God doth inlarge it
as much, where hee intends
good; thus it is
ſometimes in praying for

another; ſo as in praying
a man ſhall not be able to
pray for, as not to reprove
ſuch a man, though his
heart was to doe both:
but it fareth with him as
God threatneth concerning
Ezekiel towards that
people, that he makes his
tongue cleave to the roofe of
his mouth.
                  Ezek. 3. 26.
               
               
                  §. 5. God ſometimes anſwers thoſe prayers in ſome others whō we prayed not for.5. God will heare thoſe
prayers for, and anſwer
them in ſome others, in
whom wee ſhall have as
much comfort, as in thoſe
wee prayed for: and ſo it
often proves and fals out.
God,The reaſon. to ſhew he lookes not
as man lookes, nor chooſeth
as hee chooſeth, lets
our hearts be ſet on work
to pray for the converſion

or good of one hee intends
not mercy to; and
then anſwers them in
ſome other, whom Hee
makes as deare unto us.
When God had caſt off
Saul, ſtill Samuels heart
lingred after him, and hee
mourned for him: but
God at the ſame time,
when hee bids him ceaſe
mourning for Saul, 1. Sam.
16. to ſhew that yet hee
accepted that his mourning
as it came from him;
Goe (ſaies hee) and anoint
one of the ſonnes of leſſe,
1. Sam. 16. 1. Samuel deſired
to ſee a good ſucceſſor
in that government,
and he having been their
ruler, it was his ſpeciall
care; and he having anointed

                  Saul, it exceedingly
grieved him, that
he ſhould prove ſo wicked;
and God ſaw and anſwered
the ground of his
deſires; and therefore immediately
upon his prayers,
ſent him to anoint
the beſt King that ever
was upon that Throne,
who was the iſſue and
Man-childe of thoſe his
prayers. And again, when
Samuel came to anoint
one of the ſonnes of Ieſſe;
when he ſaw Eliab, ver. 6.
Surely (ſaies he) the Lords
anointed is before me: If Samuel
had been to chooſe,
hee would have choſen
him, and would have
prayed for and deſired
him: but God ſeeth not as

man ſeeth, ver. 7. and chooſeth
not as man chooſeth:
but in David was his praier
fully heard, and anſwered,
and that better. So
Abraham he had prayed
for Iſhmael; and Oh let Iſhmael,
live in thy ſight! Gen.
17. but GOD gave him
Iſaac in ſtead of him. So
perhaps thou prayeſt for
one childe more then for
another, out of thy natural
affection, looking on his
countenance and ſtature; as
Samuel did on Eliabs: but
yet thy prayers being
ſincere in the ground of
them, in that thou deſireſt
a childe of Promiſe,
God therefore anſwers
thee, though in another,
for whom yet haply, thy

heart was not ſo much
ſtirred; who yet when he
is converted, proves to
thee as great a comfort;
and it is as much as if that
other thou diddeſt moſt
pray for, had bin wrought
upon.

                  The third Caſe, about ſuch
prayers wherein others
joine with us. How
therein to diſcern the influence
of our own prayers.
               
               THe third Caſe to bee
conſidered is, when a
man prayes for ſomething
with others; or

which others likewiſe
pray for with him, ſo as
he is not alone in it; how
then ſhould he know, that
his prayers have a hand in
obtaining it, as well as
theirs? For in ſuch caſes
Satan is apt to object;
though the thing is granted
indeed; yet not for
thy prayers, but for the
prayers of thoſe others
joyned in it with thee.
               
                  §. 1. If our hearts were affected in praying with the ſame holy affections wherewith others that prayed with us were.1. If thy heart did ſympathize,
 and accord in the
ſame holy affections with
thoſe others in praying,
then it is certaine thy
voice hath helpt to carry
it; If two agree on earth
(ſayes Chriſt) Matt. 18. 19.
the word is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , that
is, if they harmonially agree

to play the ſame
tune: for prayers are muſick
in Gods eares, and ſo
called Melody to God, Epheſ.
5. 19 It is not ſimply their
agreeing in the thing
prayed for, but in the affections:
for it is the affections
that make the conſort
and the melody: now if
the ſame holy affections
were toucht, and ſtruck
by Gods ſpirit in thy heart,
that in theirs, then thou
doeſt help to make up the
conſort; and without thee
it would have beene imperfect:
yea, without thee
the thing might not have
been done; for God ſtands
ſometimes upon ſuch a
number of voices, and one
voice caſts it; as when he

named ten righteous perſons
to ſave Sodome: when
therefore the ſame holy
motives and affections
acted thee in thy prayer,
which did them in theirs,
it was the worke of the
ſame ſpirit, both in them
and thee, and God hath
heard thee.
               Eſpecially if God did
ſtir up the ſame ſecret inſtinct
in thee,Eſpecially when this ſympathy is unbeknowne each to other. to ſympathize
with another in
praying for ſuch a thing
unbeknowne one to another,
as ſometimes it falls
out; then ſurely thy prayers
are in it as well as his.
You ſhall obſerve ſometimes
a generall inſtinct
of the Spirit, put into
Gods peoples hearts, generally

to pray for or
againſt a thing, without
each others ſtirring up
one another: even as Ezekiel
by the river Chebar
prophecied the ſame
things Ieremiah did at
home at Ieruſalem. Thus
againſt the time that
Chriſt the Meſsiah came
in the fleſh, there was a
great expectation raiſed
up in the hearts of the
godly people, to look and
pray for him, Luke 2. 27.
and 38.
               
                  §. 2. By ſome ſpeciall evidence: as firſt, ſometimes by ſome notable circumſtance.2 God doth uſually, &amp;
often evidence to a man,
that his prayers contributed,
and went among the
reſt towards the obtaining
of it; as,
               1 By ſome circumſtance:

as for example, ſometimes
by ordering it ſo, that
that man that prayed
moſt for a thing of concernement,
ſhould have
the firſt newes of it when
it comes to bee accompliſht:
which God doth, as
knowing it will bee moſt
welcome newes to him.
God doth herein, as wee
doe with a friend, who we
know is cordiall in, and
wiſheth well to a buſineſſe;
hee ſends him the
firſt word of it, who was
moſt hearty in it, &amp; prayed
moſt about it. Good
old Simeon, had ſurely
been earneſt in ſeeking
the Lord, as wel as the reſt
in Ieruſalem, to ſend the
Meſsiah into the world,

to reſtore and raiſe up the
ruines of Iſrael, for God did
reveale to him, that hee
ſhould ſee him before he
died: and therefore to evidence
to him his reſpect
to his prayers, God carryed
the good old man into
the Temple, juſt at the
time when the Child was
brought into the Temple,
for to bee preſented to the
Lord, Luk. 2. 27, 28. And in
like manner good Anna,
who had ſerved God with
faſting and praier, night and
day: God ordereth it ſo,
that ſhe muſt alſo come in
at the ſame inſtant, Luke
2. 38. By ſome ſuch like
peculiar circumſtance or
other, doth God often uſe
to witneſſe to a mans

heart, that hee hath heard
him in buſineſſes, prayed
for in common with others.
               
                  Secondly, by the hearts being filled with much ioy in the accompliſhment.2. By filling the heart
with much joy in the accompliſhment
of what a
man prayed for: which is
an evident argument that
his prayers did move the
Lord to effect it, as well as
the prayers of others.
Thus that good old Simeon,
ſeeing his prayers now
anſwered, hee was even
willing to die through
joy; and thought he could
not die in a better time,
Lord now let thy ſervant depart
in peace. For when
the deſires have vented
and laid out much of
themſelves, then when the

return comes home, they
have an anſwerable part
and ſhare in the comfort
of it: and as deſires abounded
in praying, ſo will joy
and comfort alſo in the
accompliſhment. As when
a Ship comes home, not
onely the chiefe owners,
but every one that ventured
ſhall have a ſhare out
of the returne, in a proportion to the adventure:
ſo here, though ſome one
whom it mainly concerns
hath eſpeciall intereſt in
the mercy obtained, yet
thou ſhalt have thy prayers
out in joy from God,
that the thing is granted.
S. Paul had planted a
Church at Theſſalonica,
but hee could not ſtay to

water it with his owne
preaching, yet when abſent,
hee waters thoſe
Plants which hee had ſet,
with prayers, night and
day; 1. Theſ. 3. 10. Night and
day praying exceedingly for
you, ſayes hee: and as his
prayers were exceeding
abundant for them, ſo
was his joy as aboundant
in them, when hee had
heard that they ſtood
ſtedfaſt, and fell not back
againe; Now wee live, if
yee ſtand faſt in the Lord,
ver. 8. And what thanks
can we render to God for all
the joy wherewith wee joy
for your ſakes, before the
Lord? ver. 9.
               
                  3 By thankfulneſſe for it when accompliſht.3. If God give you a
heart thankfull for a bleſſing

vouchſafed to another,
prayed for by you
with others, it is another
ſigne your prayers have
ſome hand in it: S. Paul
knew not what thankes to
give for the anſwering of
his prayers, as in that forementioned
place. Old Eli
had put up but one ſhort
ejaculatory petition that
wee reade of, for Hannah,
&amp; that was The Lord grant
thy petition, 1 Sam. 1. 17. &amp;
for the returne of that one
prayer when Hannah related
how God had anſwered
her, ver. 26, 27. hee returned
ſolemne thankes,
And he worſhipped the Lord
there. ver. 28.
               
                  § 3. Eſpecially when the thing obtained cō
                     cernes a mans own particular.And laſtly, in caſe the
thing concerned thy ſelf,

which was prayed for by
others helping thee therein,
what cauſe haſt thou
but to thinke that it was
granted for thy owne
prayers, and not for
theirs onely? ſeeing God
ſtirred up their hearts to
pray for thee, and gave
thee a heart to pray for
thy ſelfe, and beſides, gave
thee the thing which thou
deſiredſt: which argues
thou art beloved aſwell as
they, and accepted as well
as they. I know this ſhal turn
to my ſalvation through
your prayers, ſaith S. Paul,
Phil. 1. 19. though their
prayers went to the buſineſſe,
yet had not S. Paul
beene accepted himſelfe,
the prayers of all the men

in the world, would have
done him but little good.
God may heare the prayers
of the godly, for wicked
men, when they doe
not pray themſelves, in
temporall things; ſo hee
did heare Moſes for Pharaoh,
Abraham for Abimelech;
and he may heare
godly men the ſooner for
others prayers; ſo hee
heard Aaron and Miriam
the ſooner, for Moſes his
ſake, Numb. 12. 13: But
if God ſtirs up thy heart
to pray for thy ſelfe, as
well as others for thee;
then God that gave thee a
heart to pray, hath heard
thy prayers alſo, and hath
had a reſpect to them
more in it then to theirs,

becauſe it concerned thy
ſelfe, as a more ſpeciall
mercy unto thee.
            
            
               
                  Chap. 5.CHAP. V.
               
                  Common directions helpfull
in all caſes and prayers.
Firſt, from ſuch obſervations
as may be taken,
from before, and in
praying.
               
               HAving premiſed theſe
Caſes, I come now to
more generall and common
directions to help you in
diſcerning and obſerving
the minde of God, and his
anſwers to you in your
prayers. All which directions

are ſuch, as may be
helpfull in all the forementioned
caſes, and in
all ſorts of prayers whatever.
And they are taken
from obſervations, to bee
made upon your prayers,
&amp;c. Both before, in, and after
praying;
               
                  § 1. Before: when God prepares the heart to pray.Firſt, Before praying;
when God beſpeakes a
prayer, (as I may ſo ſpeak)
that is, when God ſecretly
ſpeakes to the heart to
pray much about a thing;
I expreſſe it thus according
to that phraſe of David,
Pſal. 27. 8. Thou ſaidſt
ſeeke my face: and I ſaid,
Thy face Lord will I ſeeke:
now God then ſpeakes to
the heart to pray, when
not onely hee puts upon

the duty by ſaying to the
conſcience, this thou
oughteſt to doe: but
Gods ſpeaking to pray is
ſuch, as his ſpeech at firſt
was, when hee made the
world, when hee ſaid, Let
there be light, and there was
light: ſo hee ſayes, Let
there be a prayer, and
there is a prayer, that is,
hee powres upon a man a
ſpirit of grace and ſupplication,
a praying diſpoſition;
hee puts in motives, ſuggeſts
arguments and pleas
to God; all which you
ſhall finde come in readily,
and of themſelves; and
that likewiſe with a quickning
heat, and inlargement
of affections, and
with a lingring, and longing,

and reſtleſſeneſſe of
ſpirit to bee alone, to
powre out the ſoule to
God, and to vent and
forme thoſe motions and
ſuggeſtions into a prayer,
till you have laid them together,
and made a prayer
of them. And this is a
ſpeaking to the heart: and
obſerve ſuch times when
God doth thus, and neglect
them not; then to
ſtrike, whileſt the iron is
hot; thou haſt then his
eare, it is a ſpeciall opportunity for that buſineſſe,
ſuch an one as thou
mayeſt never have the
like. Suitors at Court obſerve
molliſsima fandi tempora,
their times of beging,
when they have

Kings in a good mood,
which they will be ſure to
take the advantage of; but
eſpecially if they ſhould
finde that the King himſelfe
ſhould beginne of
himſelfe to ſpeake of the
buſineſſe which they
would have of him: and
thus that phraſe of Pſal.
10. 17. is underſtood by
ſome, that God prepares the
heart, and cauſeth the eare
to heare; that is, hee faſhions
it, and compoſeth it
into a praying frame. And
ſure it is a great ſigne that
God meanes to heare us,The difference between Satans unſeaſonable urging us to pray, and Gods moving us.
when himſelfe ſhall thus
indite the Petition.
               And by the way let me
give this note of difference,
betweene theſe

                  ſpeakings to the heart, and
thoſe whereby Satan puts
us upon ſuch duties at unſeaſonable
houres and
times; as when we are otherwiſe
neceſſarily to be
imployed in our callings,
to eate, or to ſleepe, &amp;c.
then to put upon praying,
is a device of his he uſeth,
to tire out new converts
with. The difference will
appeare in this, the devill
comes in a violent imperious
manner upon the
conſcience, but inlargeth
not the heart a whit unto
the duty: but whenſoever
God at ſuch extraordinary
by-times doth call
upon us, hee fits and prepares
the heart, and fills
the ſoule with holy ſuggeſtions,

as materialls for
the duty; for whatſoever
he calls to, he gives abilities
withall to the thing
he calls for.
               And thus uſually, when
hee will have any great
matters done &amp; effected,
hee ſets mens hearts a
worke to pray, by a kinde
of gracious pre-inſtinct;
hee ſtirres them up and
toucheth the ſtrings of
their hearts, by his Spirit
ſent downe upon them:
Thus againſt the returne
of the captivity he ſtirred
up Daniels heart, Dan. 9. 1.
Hee knowing by bookes, the
time to be neere expiring
was ſtirred up to ſeek God:
                  Dan. 9. 2.
and ſo hee that made this
Pſalme, Salvation being

then nigh, ver. 9. 10. then
God ſtirred him up to
pray, and pen this prayer
for their returne: which
God had foretold hee
would doe, Ier. 29. 10, 11,
12. For having promiſed
ver. 10. I will cauſe you to
returne after ſeventy yeares:
Then (ſayes he, ver. 12.)
ſhall ye call upon me, and ye
ſhall goe and pray unto mee,
and I will hearken unto you:
he ſpeakes it not onely by
way of command, what it
was they ought to doe;
but as prophecying alſo
what they ſhould doe; for
then he meant to ſtirre up
their hearts; as then hee
did, as appeares by thoſe
forementioned inſtances.
Therefore obſerve what

things, God, thus by an
inſtinct doth inlarge thy
heart to pray for at times,
and ſometimes at extraordinary
by-times, when
haply thou diddeſt not
think to pray about any
ſuch thing, yet hee then
ſtirred thee up moſt, it
may be, as thou wert walking,
&amp;c. and having ſpare
time, he drawes thee into
his preſence and moves
thee in that maner ſpecified.
               
                  §. 2. 2 In praier: Gods ſpeaking to the heart in prayer, an evidence of hearing: which may be diſcerned.Now ſecondly: as God
thus ſpeakes to the heart
to pray, ſo alſo in praying;
and his ſpeaking to the
heart in prayer may bee
diſcerned by theſe particulars.
               
                  1 By giving a quiet reſt of ſpirit about the thing prayed for, in and by prayer.1. When God quiets,

and calmes, and contents
the heart in prayer, which
is done by ſpeaking ſomething
to the heart, though
what is ſpoken, be not alwayes
diſcerned: If you
ſhould ſee one, who was
an earneſt and importunate
ſuitor and exceeding
anxious when he went in
to a great man, but behold
him after comming out
from him contented, and
quieted, and cheerefull in
his ſpirit, you would conceive
that certainly ſomething
had beene ſaid to
him, which gave him encouragement,
ſatisfaction
and contentment in his
ſuit; Thus when thou
goeſt to God, and haſt
been importunate in a buſineſſe,

(as ſuppoſe for
Chriſt, Oh give me Chriſt,
or elſe I die!) and thy deſires
were exceedingly up
for it; But thou riſeſt up
with thy minde calmed
and ſatisfied, and feeleſt
the anxiouſneſſe, the ſolicitude
of thy heart about
the thing taken off, and
diſpelled; This is a good
ſign that God hath heard
thy Prayer, and hath ſpoken
ſomething to thy
heart, which makes it
thus compoſed. When
Hannah out of much bitterneſſe
and with ſtrong
deſires (which by a long
delay had bin made more
violent, ſo as her heart
was much diſquieted (for,
Prov. 13. 12. Hope, and by

the ſame reaſon, deſire alſo
deferred makes the ſoule
ſick) when out of the abundance
of her griefe,
ſhee had poured her ſoule out
before the Lord, 1. Sam. 1.
16. Eli the Prieſt joyning
in prayer alſo for her, The
Lord grant thy petition!
after that prayer ſhe found
her heart ſo quieted, that
ſhee looked no more ſad, as
the Text ſayes there; She
aroſe quieted, and calmed,
and it was that prayer,
that did both fill Elies
mouth, with that word of
prophecie, and her heart
with quietneſſe, and a ſecret
word from God accompanying it, that did
ſtill thoſe waves: and accordingly
God gave her a

Son, a Son of her deſires.
And the like God doth
now, by ſpeaking (as I
ſaid) ſomething to the
heart: as by dropping in
ſome promiſe or other into
the heart, or ſome like
conſideration; ſaying as
it were to the heart, even
as Eli from God did to
her, The Lord grants thy
petition; As to S. Paul, when
he was earneſt with God
about removing his buffetings
by Satan (which
whether they were the
ſtirring up a luſt, or temptations
of blaſphemy, I
doe not now diſpute) I
beſought God thrice, that
is, earneſtly (ſayes hee,)
that it might depart; and to
this hee had an anſwer in

the meane time given
him, till it ſhould bee taken
away; enough to ſtill
and quiet him, ſo 2. Cor.
12. 8, 9. And he ſaid, that
is, in prayer the Lord did
put in this conſideration
and promiſe into his
thoughts, And he ſaid unto
me, my grace is ſufficient for
thee, and my power is made
perfect in weakneſſe: This
anſwer thus comming in,
this promiſe thus ſeaſonably
ſuggeſted ſtayed and
quieted Pauls heart. In
like manner thou haſt (it
may bee) been long praying
againſt poverty, or the
like diſtreſſe, and God lets
fall this or the like promiſe
into thy heart, I will
never leave thee,
                  Heb. 13. 5. 
                  nor forſake

thee, which quiets and
contents thy minde. This
is an anſwer, and obſerve
ſuch anſwers, for they are
precious.
               
                  2 When God drawes nigh and reveales His love in and upon ſuch a petition.2. If whileſt thou art
a praying, God doth draw
nigh to thy ſoule, and revealeth
himſelfe to it, in
and upon ſuch, or ſuch a
particular petition. As in
caſe thou didſt mainely
intend when thou diddeſt
begin to pray, to ſet thy
ſelfe to beg ſome temporall
mercie at his hands,
ſome great matter for the
good and proſperity of
the Church (as Daniel,
Chap. 9. did ſet himſelfe to
ſeeke God for the returne
of the Captivity:) and even
before thou commeſt

to aſke it, or in aſking it,
God ſmiles upon thee,
welcomes thee: falleth about
thy neck and kiſſeth
thee: This thou art to obſerve
as a ſigne hee heares
thy prayer, and accepteth
both thee and it; when
there is ſuch a ſtrong
ſenſe of Gods favour,
and preſence, whileſt thou
art upon ſuch a ſuit and
requeſt, more then at
other times, or then in
other paſſages of the ſame
prayer, this is a token
God heares thee, in that
particular, and thou art
to obſerve this his ſpeaking
to thy heart: When
thus thou ſhalt no ſooner
come into his preſence
to enquire of him, but

hee ſayes, Here I am, as
the promiſe is, Eſay 58. 9.
Therefore, Pſal. 69. 17, 18.
Heare me ſpeedily ſayes David;
and (that I may know
thou heareſt mee) draw
nigh to mee: therefore
when God drawes nigh
to thee, it is a ſigne hee
heares thee. Daniel having
faſted and prayed for
three weekes together,
Dan. 10. 2, 3: Then an
Angell came, and one of
the three Perſons came
and told him, hee was a
man greatly beloved, ver. 11
and 19. when in like maner
God by his Spirit
comes downe, and meets
thee, and tells thy heart in
ſecret that thou art His
beloved, and Hee is thine,
                  
then thy prayers are certainly
heard: for if hee
accepts thy perſon, much
more thy prayers, 1. Iohn 5.
19, 20. Men, falſe men,
(falſe upon the ballance, as
David ſpeakes, when they
come to bee tried and
weighed,) they will out
of cunning uſe ſuitors
moſt kindly then, when
they meane to put them
off, and deny them their
requeſts: But God who
is truth and faithfulneſſe
it ſelfe, doth not uſe ſo to
deale, but when he means
to anſwer the prayer, Hee
withall ſometimes reveals
his free grace moſt, to
the end they may ſee and
acknowledge the fountaine
of all, to be his everlaſting

love, and ſo take
the thing granted as a
fruit of it, and thereby
come to bee the more abundantly
thankfull.
               Onely let me adde this
Caution,A caution: That yet this is not alwayes an infallible ſigne the thing is granted, though that the prayer is accepted. which may bee
of great uſe to you. That
it is not alwayes infallibly
true, that when God
drawes nigh to you in a
particular requeſt, that
that requeſt in particular,
ſhall bee granted in that
maner you deſired, but it
is a certaine evidence that
thy prayer is heard, and
that the thing thou aſkeſt
is agreeable to his will,
and that hee approves of
thee and thy requeſt exceedingly,
and thinketh
the better of thee for it,

and hee will give thee it,
or ſomething that is better▪
There may be herein
and ſometimes is a miſtake
of Gods meaning, to
thinke that alwayes, then
the thing ſhall be granted,
when God drawes nigh
to a man: experience
ſometimes ſhews the contrary.
               
                  
                     Queſt. 
                   But you will ſay, Why
doth God draw ſo nigh
if he meanes not to grant
it?
               
                  
                     Anſw. 
                   1. He ſhewes thereby
His approving will of the
thing prayed for. Now
GOD approves many
things, hee decrees not.
The reaſons why God ſometimes drawes nigh when he grants nor the thing.There is his approving will
and his decreeing will.
God may ſhew his approving

wil of the thing thou
aſkeſt, (as ſuppoſe it bee
in view a matter which is
of great conſequence for
the Church;) which hee
doth for thy encouragement:
but yet it followes
not, that his decreeing
wil is for the accompliſhment
of that very thing in
particular.
               2. God may accept the
perſon and the prayer,
when hee doth not grant
the thing prayed for; and
by that drawing nigh
witneſſe his acceptation
of thy perſon and the
prayer. Yea,
               3. That revealing of
himſelfe is oftentimes all
the anſwer he intended to
ſuch a prayer, and it is anſwer

enough too, to enjoy
in the ſtead of a particular
mercy the aſſurance of
Gods love. As ſuppoſe
thou didſt pray againſt
ſome evill comming upon
his Church, which he yet
intends to bring; which
hee did ſet thy heart a
worke to pray againſt,
thereby to manifeſt the
ſincerity therof; and then
hee ſeeing thee thus ſincere
drawes nigh to thee,
and tells thee, however,
it ſhall go well with thee,
and that thou art greatly
beloved of Him: Thou
art ſometime to take this
for all the anſwer hee
meanes to give. And this
hee doth ſometimes alſo
to content the heart, and

prepare it for a deniall in
the thing: whereas, otherwiſe,
the deniall of what a
Chriſtian hath been earneſt
in, might occaſion (as
in many it doth) a queſtioning
and doubting of
Gods love.
               
                  §. 4. God ſome times ſtirs up a particular faith of aſſurāce in ſome buſineſſes.3 When God ſtirres up
in the heart a particular
faith in a buſineſſe: as
ſometimes He doth, and
upholds the heart to wait
for it, maugre all diſcouragements.
So hee did in
David, Pſal. 27. 3. David
was then in great hazards
by reaſon of Saul or Abſalom,
and thoſe ſuch and
ſo often, as that to ſenſe
and outward probabilities
hee was like never to
live quietly againe at Ieruſalem
                  
and enjoy Gods Ordinances
there in peace;
but for this David had
prayed, and had made it as
the grand requeſt of his
whole life (as every man
hath ſome one great requeſt
of all other, even as
Hee hath ſome ſpeciall
grace above all other, or
gift, &amp;c. ſo requeſt to God
next to His ſalvation, as
haply for his Miniſtery, or
the like, therefore ſayes
David, verſe 4. This one
thing have I deſired) and accordingly
God gave him
a ſpeciall faith in this
thing above all other, becauſe
it was his great requeſt,
In this will I be confident▪
verſe 3. And though
an hoſte of men ſhould againe

and againe incompaſſeme,
ſaies he, yet in this
I will be confident, that I
ſhall ſtill eſcape, and ſee
Ieruſalem againe, and enjoy
the Ordinances and
live in peace; and though
his faith failed him often
(as in the perſecution of
Saul it did) for he ſaid he
ſhould one day periſh by the
hand of Saul:
                  1 Sam. 27. 1 yet at other
times his faith was marvellouſly
upheld, and hee
was confident in this. Hee
uſed not to be ſo, in other
requeſts thus abſolutely
particularly and diſtinctly,
and therefore he ſayes,
In this, &amp;c. As there is a
witneſſe of the Holy Ghoſt
immediate to the heart,
ſealing up adoption to a

mans perſon, ſo in ſome
caſes, there is the like teſtimony
for the obtaining
of ſome eminent thing we
have aſked. Which particular
ſpeciall faith, doth in
a kind of ſimilitude anſwer
to the faith of miracles
of old, whereby a man
had a particular confidēce,
that God would doe ſuch
a miracle by him: ſo in &amp;
by meanes of prayer, in
ſome things there may be
a particular ſtrengthning
&amp; aſſuring the heart, that
God will doe ſuch a thing
for a man: which I confeſſe
is rare and extraordinary,
as alſo that immediate teſtimony
concerning our
perſons is, which many
want that goe to heaven.

And haply this other concerning
the accompliſhment
of ſpeciall mercies,
is much more rare; and
but in ſome buſineſſes;
and is a thing which ſome
men are not acquainted
with, but yet may bee in
ſome caſes exiſtent to
ſome mens ſpirits, as it
was to Davids in the
thing mentioned.
               And concerning this alſo
I will alſo adde a Caution,
A caution, that herein a conditionall evidence be not taken for abſolute. as about the former.
That it doth not alwayes
fall out upon all ſuch kind
of evidences made to a
mans ſpirit, and that by
God, that the thing prayed
for doth come to paſſe.
For theſe very perſwaſions
ſtirred up by God,

may bee and are often but
conditionall, though thus
immediately made to a
mans ſpirit, and are ſo to
bee underſtood, and not
peremptory and abſolute.
It cannot bee imagined
that all theſe ſhould alwayes
be of greater abſoluteneſſe
and peremptorineſſe,
than were many
of thoſe revelations made
by God to the Prophets,
wherein Hee manifeſted
his gracious purpoſe towards
ſuch a man or people,
either to vouchſafe
them ſuch a mercie,
or bring ſuch a judgement;
which forewarnings
though they were
particular and expreſſe,
yet limited and intended

with a condition, according
to the performance,
or not performance of
which, it fell out, either
the judgement expreſly
threatned was diverted,
or that good thing which
was as directly and fully
promiſed, was not beſtowed:
as it was in the
caſe of Ionas threatning
the deſtruction of Nineveb;
and ſo in the promiſe
concerning Ely's
houſe, 1. Sam. 2. 30. I ſaid
indeed that thy houſe, and
the houſe of thy father ſhould
walke before mee for ever,
but now the Lord ſayes, it
ſhall not bee ſo: For they
had broken the condition
which was implied in it;
they had deſpiſed the

Lord; and them that deſpiſe
me, ſayes God there, I will
deſpiſe. In like manner is
Gods meaning, expreſſed
towards us in ſuch like
perſwaſions wrought in
us by prayer, to be underſtood;
as that ſuch mercies
will ſurely come to
paſſe, but ſtill under a
condition of obedience,
and performing of thoſe
vowes, which a man joyned
with thoſe his petitions,
to move the Lord to
grant the things; which if
a man faile in, or ceaſeth
to goe on to beleeve, it
may and doth often come
to paſſe, that things fall
out contrary to that perſwaſion,
and then wee are
apt to queſtion whether

it was from God or no;
which it might bee, and
truely wrought by his
Spirit and yet not alwaies
abſolutely meant (that
was your miſtake ſo to
take it) but conditionally
onely. For in ſuch great
requeſts of the ſoule unto
God there uſe to paſſe mutuall
covenants betweene
God and us; and Indentures
are drawne and ſealed
unto by us, that is, we
in prayer, offer and promiſe
to doe thus and thus,
if God will vouchſafe us
ſuch a mercy, and pleade
it to God to move him to
beſtow it; and God, hee
thereupon (it may bee)
ſeales a covenant on his
part to grant the thing, &amp;

works ſuch an undoubted
perſwaſion; but if wee in
that interim of waiting
for that mercy, doe deale
falſely in that covenant
which we made; and this
even whileſt wee are yet
in dependance upon God
for it; whereby it appeares
that we would have done
ſo much more after wee
ſhould have received it
once, in this caſe God denies
the thing, and yet
notwithſtanding, that perſwaſion
and evidence was
from God that heard the
prayer. He ſaid indeed he
would doe thus and thus
for thee: (as he told David,
I would have given thee
much more:) becauſe thou
ſaidſt to him, thou wouldſt

walke thus and thus, or
didſt vow this or that to
him; thou faileſt in thy
word, upon which God uttered
his; and thereupon
ſayes God as to Ely, Now it
ſhall not be ſo, and yet God
had ſpoken it afore, and
not Satan, nor thine owne
heart onely.
               
                  §. 5. Whē God puts a reſtleſſe importunity into the heart, to pray for a particular mercy.4. When God doth put
a reſtleſſe importunity into
the heart, maugre all
diſcouragements. So in
that Pſalme 27. 4. One thing
I have deſired, and I wil ſeek
after it, that is, as I have
ſought it, ſo I will not
leave ſeeking to God for
it: when God maintaines
this in the heart, it is a
ſigne he heares, and will
anſwer: for you know the

Parable, that the unjuſt
Iudge heard her for her importunity;
therefore when
God puts an importunity
into the heart, he meanes
to heare.
               Onely this likewiſe is
to be added in this,A double importunity: one accepted, not the other. There
is a double importunity:
one out of ſuch an inordinate
deſire to a thing, as
the heart knows not how
to be without ſuch a mercie,
and ſo continues to
aſk, but asketh amiſſe, and
ſo receives not, Iam. 5. But
there is an importunity
joyned with a ſubjection
to Gods will; which when
it runs along with it, then
God hath ſtird it up, and
then looke for ſomething
to come; otherwiſe you

may bee importunate, as
they ſeeke mee daily, when
yet God heard not, Eſay
58. 2.
            
            
               
                  Chap. 6.CHAP. VI.
               
                  Further Obſervations to
be made, on the diſpoſitions
and carriage of our
hearts, after Prayer: untill
the iſſue of the thing
prayed for.
               
               NExt: after thou haſt
prayed, obſerve, what
God doth towards thee.
               
                  § 1. Whē God gives an obedient dependant heart, in walking before him.As firſt, how hee doth
guide thy feet and heart
after praying: there is much
in that: that which was

the Spirit of ſupplication
in a man when he prayed,
reſts upon him as the ſpirit
of obedience in his
courſe; ſo as that dependance
hee hath upon God
for the mercy hee ſeekes
for, is a ſpeciall motive, &amp;
meanes to keep him fearefull
of offending, and diligent
in duty; to looke to
his paths to walke and behave
himſelfe as becomes
a ſuitor, as well as to come
and pray as a ſuitor. Thus
David, he walked by this
principle, Pſal. 66. 18. If I
regard iniquity in my heart,
God will not heare me; that
conſideration ſtill came in
as a curb unto ſinne; and
without this a man provokes
God, and ſo caſts

himſelfe behind-hand againe,
and by ſinning loſeth
what ground hee had
got by praying. Therefore
David, Pſal. 145. 8, 9,
10. when he was to pray,
even as for his life, (as
then he did, it being a deliverance
from his enemies
he ſought) he ſpecially
prayes God to direct
him and keepe him, that
hee might not ſin againſt
him; for he knew by ſinning
hee ſhould enervate
and ſpoile all his prayers:
not onely heare me ſpeedily
(ſayes he) but alſo Cauſe
me to know the way wherein
I ſhould walke; Teach me to
doe thy will; this he eſpecially
prayes for, and more
then for deliverance, for

elſe he knew God would
not heare him. Therefore
when thou art in treaty
with God for any mercy,
obſerve, doth God ſtill after
praying keep thee in a
more obedient frame of
ſpirit? it is a ſigne hee intends
to anſwer thee; as
in like manner, when hee
keeps thee from uſing ill
meanes, &amp;c. When hee
meant to give David the
Kingdome, hee kept him
innocent, and his heart
tender, that it ſmote him
but for cutting off the lap of
Sauls garment: he was not
ſo tender after. Therefore
in Pſal. 18. when hee was
delivered from all his enemies,
hee ſayes, God dealt
with him according to his

uprightneſſe: for I kept my
ſelfe from mine iniquity. So
alſo Pſal. 27. 11.
               
                  2 Whē God gives a heart to waite for &amp; expect the mercy.2 When God after prayer
ſtrengthneth the heart
to wait for the mercy. So
Pſal. 27. ult. David having
prayed, ſayes to his ſoule,
Wait on the Lord, be of good
courage, and he will ſtrengthen
thy heart. Honeſt men,
when they nouriſh hopes
in one that is in dependance
on them, who waiteth
and is obſequious upon
the hopes he hath of a
ſuite, uſe not to deny him:
it were diſhoneſty in thē
to keep a man underhand,
and then fruſtrate his
expectations; Therefore
when God keeps thy ſoule
after praying in ſuch a dependant

frame, looke for
ſome good anſwer. And
indeed when a man hath
prayed long, in the end he
begins to wait (as I may ſo
ſay) rather thā pray (though
he pray ſtill) becauſe now
he looks God ſhould performe:
before, and at firſt,
he told the Lord he deſired
it, but now he can with
ſome boldneſſe tell him,
that he waits for it and expects
it. The hope of a godly
man and his expectation
ſhould make him aſhamed
if it were not anſwered,
therefore in this caſe anſwers
uſe to come.
               
                  Both theſe two laſt we
have together joyned Pſa.
37. 34. Wait on the Lord, &amp;
keep his waies, and he ſhal exalt
thee.
            
            
               
               
                  Chap. 7.CHAP. VII.
               
                  Obſervations to be made
after prayer, upon the iſſue
of what was prayed
for: and firſt, if accompliſhed,
whether as the
fruit of prayers, or out of
common providence;
Helps herein.
               
               WHen a man hath
thus waited, and
kept his way, then let him
obſerve the iſſue and concluſion
of what he ſought
for, how things are caſt
by God. Now of neceſsity,
one of theſe two muſt fall
out, that either the thing
deſired is accompliſhed, or
not accompliſhed; and in either

of theſe he may come
to ſpie out anſwers to his
prayers; for prayer may
be anſwered, though the
thing be not done.
               I meane to inſiſt ſeverally
on theſe.
               
                  §. 1. God ſometimes anſwers the prayer fully in the way and manner deſired.1 If the thing thou
prayedſt for doth come
to paſſe, then what needſt
thou doubt of an anſwer,
and whether God heard
thee or no? For thou beholdeſt
it with thine eies:
and ſo often it falls out,
that God doth grant according
to the deſires of
a mans heart; and not only
ſo, but alſo fulfils his
counſell therein, as it is,
Pſal. 20. 4. that is, fulfils not
onely his deſire, and aime
of his prayer, but in that

very way, by that very
meanes, which his judgement
and counſell pitcht
upō in his own thoughts.
The deſire of the heart
may be ſatisfied, when
God gives ſome other
thing, but the counſell of
the heart is then fulfilled,
when a man is anſwered
in that particular, which
his own judgment pitcht
upon as beſt for him. For
counſell is an act of the
underſtanding, deliberating
about meanes to an
end, &amp; directing to chooſe
a particular meanes tending
to an end: ſo that as
Eliphaz ſayes to Iob, 22.
27, 28. Thou ſhalt make thy
prayer to God, and hee ſhall
hear thee: &amp; decree a thing,

and it ſhall be eſtabliſhed to
thee, that is, a man is guided
to decree and pitch
upon ſuch mercies in his
prayers, as God makes
good in particular: hee
ſaies what he would have,
and God performs it: and
this priviledge thou ſhalt
have (ſayes Eliphaz there)
if thou wilt turne to him,
and be acquainted with
him, and receive the Law
from his mouth: thou ſhalt
not erre in praying; but
what thou ſetteſt upon to
pray for, ſhall be accordingly
granted to thee▪
ſuch a man ſhall have the
priviledge, Fingere ſibi
fortunam in a right ſenſe,
to be his owne chooſer,
and carver of his owne

mercies; and as Chriſt
ſaid, Be it according to thy
faith, ſo God ſayes ſometimes,
Be it according to thy
prayers; and Eliphaz ſpeaks
of it as of a ſpeciall favour,
that whereas other mens
prayers are anſwered obliquely,
thine ſayes hee
ſhall be anſwered directly,
which is more comfortable;
as direct beames are,
and have more heate in
them then collaterall and
oblique. Thus if a man
will heare God and obey
him, God will heare him:
for if a man be ſubject
to Chriſt; Kingly Office,
his Propheticall Office ſhall
guide him, and cauſe him
not to erre in his Petitions;
but by an unerring

providence &amp; preinſtinct
infuſed by his ſpirit, God
will ſo guide him, as to ask
evē that very thing which
GOD intends to give;
whereas of himſelfe hee
knowes not what, nor how
to aske. So David asked
long life, and God gave it
him, Pſal. 21. 2, 3, 4. God
not onely gave him his
hearts deſire, but the requeſt
of his lips, v. 2. Hannah
askt a ſonne, and God anſwered
her in the very
thing ſhee deſired, and
therefore ſhee called him
Samuel, 1 Sam. 1. 20. Becauſe
(ſayes ſhe) I askt him
of the Lord: and Verſe 27.
For this child I prayed, and
the Lord (did not give another
thing in ſtead of it,

but) hath given me my Petition
I asked of him. So, 1.
Chro. 4. 10. labeſh called on
God (tis ſaid) and God granted
him the thing hee requeſted.
And thus God often
deales with his children.
And to this end hath
God given us his Spirit;
and made Chriſt Wiſedome
unto us, who knowes what
is good for us, though we
doe not. And hath therefore
alſo commanded us
to ſpye out mercies for
our ſelves, and then come
to him for them: and to
this end hath made ſuch
particular promiſes of particular
mercies, which he
would have us have an eie
unto in our prayers; all
which is, becauſe often he

means to beſtow the very
things we aſke.
               And yet becauſe,Yet our hearts are often jealous, whether it be an anſwer to prayer, or out of common providēce. although
we have the very
things wee did aſke and
deſire, ſuch is the jealouſie
&amp; infidelity of our hearts,
that we often diſcern not,
nor acknowledge that it
was our prayers, that obtained
them from God:
but we are apt, when once
wee have them, either to
look but to things below,
and the ſecond cauſes of
them, though before wee
did earneſtly ſeeke them
of God, or elſe ſtill diſtruſtfully
to queſtiō whether
or no it was at our
prayers that hee granted
them, or out of common
providence. Thus Iob in

his diſtemper, Iob 9. 16▪
although I had called, and
God had anſwered me, yet
(ſayes he) I would not beleeve
that he had hearkened
to my voice, that is, not that
he did it in reſpect to my
prayer and requeſt, becauſe
he now deales ſo feverely
with me, For hee
breaketh me with a tempeſt,
Ver. 17. And thus doe
our diſtruſtfull hearts,
(which are apt to bee unſatisfied
with all the cleereſt
pledges of Gods favour,
and ſtill to miſconſtrue
and pervert them,)
although God doth anſwer
us upon our calling
upon him, yet we will not
beleeve that he hearkened
to our prayer in it.

Therefore that you may
be further inabled to diſcerne,
how, and when
things you prayed for,
come in by prayer; I give
you theſe further directions.
               
                  §. 2. Directions to helpe to diſcerne this.1. When God doth a
thing in anſwer to prayers,
 hee often doth it in
ſuch a maner, that his
hand may bee in a more
then ordinary maner ſeen
in it.1 From the manner of Gods performance: God diſcovers a more then ordinnary hand of providence in things accompliſht by prayer: inſtanced and diſcovered in 5. particulars. There are few prayers,
wherein a man hath
ſought God much, but in
the anſwers of them God
diſcovers himſelfe much,
and turnes many great
wheeles in the accompliſhment
of them, and
manifeſts (as David deſires,
Pſal. 17. 7.) his marvelous

loving kindneſſe;
and indeed, when GOD
heares prayers, that have
beene a long while a making,
Hee ſhewes uſually
halfe a miracle one way
or other.
               Now GOD diſcovers
his immediat hand in the
anſwers of prayers many
wayes.
               
                  1 By bringing it to paſſe through many difficulties.1. When hee carries a
thing through many difficulties,
 when there were
a great many croſſe wards
in a buſineſſe prayed for,
the leaſt whereof would
have kept the key from
turning: when GOD ſhall
make (as it were) a key on
purpoſe to unlocke it;
when God plots and contrives
all the paſſages in a

buſineſſe thou didſt pray
for, and ſo accompliſheth
it; This is a ſigne, it is a
fruit of prayer, and that
prayer had been a making
that key all that while:
So in bringing David to
the Kingd me; Ioſeph out
of priſon; Mordecai to
honour: and likewiſe S.
Peter out of priſon, which
was done at the prayers of
the Church, Act. 12. He
was ſleeping betweene
two ſouldiers: if they had
waked, he had beene diſcovered:
and hee was in
chaines, but they fall off,
ver. 6. 7. And the Keepers
ſtood before the doore,
but they mind him not,
ver. 6. and when one
watch is paſt, hee paſſeth

quietly through another,
ver. 10. and when both
thoſe were paſt, an Iron
gate flyes open of its own
accord, ver. 10. Now ſuch
difficulties are there in
many buſineſſes, which
yet in the end are accompliſhed
by prayer: Iron
chaines fall off, Iron gates,
enemies hearts flye open
of their own accord; and
though not in that miraculous
manner, by the
meanes of an Angell, yet
no leſſe wonderfully.
               
                  Or ſecōdly by facilitating all the means &amp; cauſing them to conſpire to accompliſh it.Or ſecondly when God
facilitates all meanes to
accompliſh the thing
which was prayed for, ſo
as all meanes doe in view
conſpire and combine in
it, that thou haſt winde

and tyde, and a faire day,
and all the way paved; or
as David ſayes, haſt thy
way made plaine before thee;
and there falls out a great
conjunction and meeting
of many circumſtances together
to effect it, which
had influence into it,
whereof if any one had
beene wanting, haply the
thing had not been done,
when the thing prayed for
is thus granted, prayer
then hath done it. Thus,
when hee delivered the
people of Iſrael out of
Egypt, which was the accompliſhment
of their
long deſires and prayers,
(their cry came up the Text
ſayes) how were all things
facilitated! they that detained

them doe themſelves
come, and intreate
them to goe out, yea, are
urgent, ſayes the Text;
and that at midnight: nay,
hire them to goe out,
with their eare-rings; and
Pharaoh himſelfe then
parts lovingly and fairely
with them, and deſires
their prayers,
                  Exod. 12. 31, 33, 35. Ver. 32. 
                  Bleſſe me alſo:
Yea, to ſhew there was
no reſiſtance, the Text
ſayes, a Dog did not move
his tonguee: The bruite
Creatures did not diſturb
thē, though at midnight,
when thoſe Creatures uſe
to be moſt obſtreperous
through noiſes.
               
                  3 By bringing it to paſſe ſuddenly and unexpectedly.3. When hee doth it
ſuddenly, and accompliſheth
the thing thou haſt

long prayed for, ere thou
art aware of it: as the returne
of the Captivity of
Babylon, which was the
concluſion of many prayers,
was done in a trice,
they were as men in a dream,
Pſal. 126. 1. they could
ſcarce beleeve it was ſo,
when it was done, it was
becauſe they had ſowen
many prayers which came
up on the ſuddaine, ver. 5,
6. So Peter, hee was faſt
aſleepe, and did not ſo
much as dreame of deliverance.
So Ioſephs delivery
out of priſon, and
advancement to bee the
greateſt man in the Kingdome,
the ſuddenneſſe of
it ſhewed it was Gods remembring
of him, and

hearing his prayers.
               
                  4 By doing above what was deſired with addition of other mercies.4. When God grants
the thing with an overplus,
 above what wee did
aſk, &amp; caſteth many other
mercies in together with
that which we long prayed
for; this alſo may be a
ſigne God did heare our
prayers in it: for when he
doth heare indeed, hee
uſeth to doe above what wee
did aske or thinke, thereby
the more to overcome
the heart. So David aſked
long life, and he gave him
more then he asked, Pſal.
21. 2, 3, 4, 5. So Solomon
he asked but wiſdome, and
hee gave him more then
he asked, Peace, Riches, Honour,
and all with it, 1 Kin.
3. 12, 13. Hannah ſhee aſked

but one male childe,
1 Sam. 1. 10. but God gave
her three ſonnes more
and two daughters, Chap.
2. 21. When prayers are
anſwered, uſually mercies
come thicke, they come
tumbling in; the thing
we prayed for comes not
alone: as when ſinnes are
puniſhed, then miſeries
alſo they come like armies
in troops upon us: as
temptations likewiſe come
together, and we fall into
many of them at once,Iam. 1. 2. as S.
Iames ſpeakes: Thus doe
mercies alſo.
               
                  5 By adding ſome ſpeciall circumſtance as a token of Gods ſpeciall hand in it.5. When the thing is
granted by prayers, there
is often ſome particular
circumſtance of providence
concurrent with it,

which is a token for good,
and ſealeth to us that it is
from God; ſuch often as a
man himſelfe takes notice
of, and which others take
notice of alſo. Shew mee a
token for good, ſayes David,
Pſal. 86. 17. that others
may ſee it and be aſhamed:
and ſuch tokens doth God
often make ſmall circumſtances
to bee. Things
ſmall in themſelves, may
bee magna indicia, great
ſignes and tokens: for
example Moſes and Aaron,
and the Iſraelites had
long cryed to GOD for
the deliverance of his
people, and laid up many
prayers; their cry came up,
as was ſaid; and when
God doth deliver them,

what tokens were there
of good? and of GODS
hand in it, and of his anſwer
to their prayers?
The Text notes (as was
obſerved before) that a dog
did not barke at their going
out, Exod. 11. 7. which
was a ſmall circumſtance,
but it was magnum indicium,
and ſo intended by
God; for the Text addes,
That ye may know that God
puts a difference between the
Iſraelites and the Egyptians.
This was a 
                     •
                  oken of
Gods hand, to over-rule
the tongues of rude bruit
creatures, that uſe to ſtir
at ſuch unuſuall noiſes,
and at travellers eſpecially
in the night. So when
Iſaac and Abraham, and

his ſervant alſo, had prayed
for a Wife for Iſaac,
ſee by what a token God
ſhewed he had heard their
prayers; Rebekkah was the
firſt that came out to the
ſervant ſent to bring a
wife for him: and if ſhee
be the woman appointed
for Iſaac (ſaies the ſervant)
Let her offer me drinke,
                  Gen 23. 13, 14. 
                  and
my Camels alſo: this was
a ſmall thing in appearance,
but a great indicium
of Gods hand in it, and
therefore the ſervant bowed
at it, and worſhipped:
and the ſigne in it ſelfe
was ſuch, as argued a
good nature in her, and a
kinde courteous diſpoſition,
which therefore (it
may bee) hee ſingled out,

as a token of a meet wife,
as a thing eſpecially to be
looked at in the mariage
choiſe.
               
                  § 3. Obſervation from the time wherein the thing prayed for is accompliſht, as,Againe, the conſideration
of the time, wherein
the things we have aſked▪
are granted, may much
help us to diſcerne, whether
it be in anſwer to our
prayers. For God who
doth all things in weight
and meaſure, ſhewes his
wiſdome and love, as much
in the ſeaſon, as in giving
the thing it ſelfe: GOD
conſidereth all times of
thy life, and ſtill choſſeth
the beſt and fitteſt to anſwer
thy prayers in, In an
acceptable time have I heard
thee. So Eſay 49. 8. As David
(in like maner ſayes)

hee prayed in an acceptable
time, Pſal. 69. 13. So accordingly
God anſwers in the
beſt and moſt acceptable
time to us; for he waits to
be gracious, for he is a God
of judgement, Eſay 30. 18.
that is, Hee is a wiſe God
that knowes the fitteſt
times and ſeaſons, wherein
to ſhew kindneſſes, and
to deale forth his favours
in.
               
                  1 Sometime the thing is accompliſht about the time wherin we are moſt inſtant in prayer.As firſt, it may be, that
at that very time when
thou haſt beene moſt inſtant
and earneſt, yea even
whileſt thou art a praying
or preſently after, the
thing is done and accompliſht.
To this purpoſe is
that of Eſay 65. 24. That
as ſometimes he heares before

they call (which argues
much love to give
mercies unſought) ſo alſo
whileſt they are ſpeaking, I
will heare, and grant the
thing, which argues no
leſſe love; and he culs out
that time on purpoſe, that
they might reſt aſſured
that it was in anſwer to
their prayer. Thus to aſſure
Hezekiah his prayer
was heard, God ſent the
Prophet in unto him whileſt
hee was a praying and
weeping, with his head turned
towards the wall. So
Iſaac going out to pray in
the field, meets his Rebekkah
then a comming;Gen. 24 63
that bleſſing of a good
Wife, being ſurely the
great requeſt temporall

hee was then in Treaty
with God for: this Rebekkah
was the fruit of many
prayers. So when S. Peter
was in priſon, the Church
being gathered together
to pray for him, S. Peter
comes and knocks at the
ſame houre, Acts 12. from
the 12. ver. to the 18. So
as it often falls out herein,
as to the Ruler in the
Goſpel, Iob. 4. 52. who inquiring
diligently, found
that the ſame houre that
Chriſt had ſaid to him, Thy
ſonne liveth, his ſon recovered,
and ſo he beleeved, and
his whole houſhold: So alſo
here, that ſometimes the
thing is done, or the
newes of it comes the
ſame houre or ſoone after,

wherein a man was praying
about it, and haply
then when the heart was
moſt ſtirred about it,
more then at any time
elſe: this is a ſigne it was
an anſwer of prayers, and
may help to confirme a
mans faith in it, as that alſo
did his.
               
                  2 When granted in the fitteſt time.Or ſecondly, when it
is the moſt acceptable
and every way the fitteſt
time to have the thing
granted. At that time,
1. when thou hadſt moſt
neede, and 2. when thy
heart was moſt fit for it.
For in anſwering prayers,
God aimes eſpecially at
two things: 1. To ſhew his
mercy, that a man might
magnifie and exalt that:

And 2. 
                  To have the heart
ſatisfied and filled with joy
and contentment in his
anſwer, and the thing
made ſweet, and a mercy
indeed to him: in briefe,
that his goodneſſe might be
delighted in, and his mercy
exalted.
                  The fitteſt time knowne two wayes. And for theſe two
purpoſes he culs out ſuch
times, when we have moſt
need; and alſo when our
hearts are moſt ſubdued,
and our luſts mortified.
For then we are fitteſt to
relliſh his goodneſſe alone,
and not to bee drawne
away with the carnall
ſweetneſſe that is in the
thing. The one you have
expreſt, Eſay 30. 18. Hee
waits to bee gracious to have
his mercy exalted. The ſecond

intimated Iames 5.
Ye aske and receive not, becauſe
ye aske amiſſe, to conſume
upon your luſts; Such
prayers, whileſt the heart
is in this temper, the Lord
denies, or deferres in mercie
till the heart bee weaned.
               
                  1 When wee have moſt need.For the firſt of theſe:
As, ſuppoſe thou diddeſt
pray long for aſſurance of
ſalvation, and joy in the
Holy Ghoſt, and when
thou hadſt moſt need of
it, either when thy ſpirit
would have failed without
it, as Eſay 57. 16. Or againſt
ſome great affliction
approaching, or ſome
great encounter with the
world for the Name of
Chriſt, then God filled thy

heart with it, &amp;c. that
was the fitteſt time: now
hath God heard thy prayer.
As S. Peter hee was in
Priſon, and had beene ſo
for many dayes, as appeares
by the fourth and
fifth verſes, Acts 12. God
could haue delivered him
at any time, while
the Church prayed for
him, ver. 5. But God kept
him in on purpoſe, till
that very night, when in
the next morning Herod
meant to bring him forth
to execution, and then
God delivered him at the
prayers of the Church;
then was the moſt fit time;
As the Pſalmiſt ſayes, The
full time to have mercy on
him was come.
                  Pſal. 102. 1
                        •
                     . And then

to receive an anſwer, is a
ſigne God did it out of
ſpeciall love, which love
hee would have exalted by
thee, as Eſay 30. 18.
               
                  2. When the heart was beſt prepared to receive it, and moſt weaned from it.If 2. when thy heart
was moſt fit for the mercy,
it was granted, then art
thou alſo heard in an acceptable
time: for God
doth not with hold mercies
from thoſe that are
his, out of want of love;
neither ſo much for what
is paſt, as for the preſent
evill diſpoſition of their
hearts, whereby they are
unfit to receive them:
and in this ſenſe likewiſe
may that bee underſtood,
that God prepareth the
heart: and heareth the prayer,
Pſal. 10. 17.
               
                  
As firſt, when thy heart
is moſt weaned from that
temporall mercy (ſuppoſing
it ſuch) granted thee
upon ſeeking of it: So
David, when had hee the
Kingdome in poſſeſſion
given him? then, when
hee was as a weaned child,
and had his high thoughts
(which haply at the firſt
newes of it had riſen in
his minde) purged out,
Pſal. 131. 2. I have no high
thoughts, &amp;c. ſayes hee
then; Thus, when thy
heart had let all carnall
ends goe, and had betaken
it ſelfe alone to God,
for thy portion to be had
alone out of him then the
thing prayed for comes
to paſſe: this was the

fitteſt ſeaſon.
               
                  
                     Object. 
                  .But you will bee ready
to ſay, To have a thing
when my heart is taken
off from it, and even contented
not to have it,
makes it to be as no mercy:
for where there is no
deſire, there is no rejoycing.
               
                  
                     Anſw. 
                   If thy deſire bee taken
off the thing, then thou
wilt rejoyce the more in
GOD now; and though
the thing of it ſelf ſhould
now give thee leſſe ſatisfaction,
yet God by the
thing wil give thee more,
and he will make it up; for
thou wilt relliſh his love
and ſweetneſſe in it now,
which is better then life,
and therefore much better

than that thing enjoyed;
and indeed the violence
of the deſire before,
would have made it leſſe
ſweet, for the thing alone
would not have filled and
contented that deſire,
when it was an inordinate
luſt, and ſo thou wouldſt
have beene vexed with it,
rather than ſatisfied, and
found a greater vanity in
it: but now when it is become
a ſubordinate deſire
unto God, that the
deſire is downe, and the
heart quieted and contented
with God in the
thing: the heart ſayes as
ſhe ſaid, I have enough. So 2.
likewiſe thou maiſt have
an affliction thou prayedſt
long againſt taken off

then, when thy heart was
moſt willing to accept thy
puniſhment (as Moſes's
phraſe is,Lev. 26. 41) and to ſubmit
to God in it.
               
                  § 4. A third ſort of obſervations, from the anſwerable proportion betweene Gods dealing in the accōpliſhment of it, and our prayers.A third thing you are
to obſerve concerning
the accompliſhment of
the thing prayed for,
whereby you may diſcern
whether granted in anſwer
to prayers, is, when
thou ſeeſt God in his dealings
with thee, and anſwering
of thee, to deale
in a kinde of proportion
with thy manner of praying
and ſeeking of him,
and of walking with him
whileſt thou were dependant
on him, for ſuch or
ſuch a mercy. And as you
may ſee a proportion between

ſinnes and puniſhments,
which are the rewards
of them; that you
can ſay, ſuch a ſin brought
forth this affliction, it is ſo
like the Father: ſo you
might ſee the like proportion,
betweene your
prayers, and your walking
with God, and Gods anſwers
to you, and his dealings
with you. So did
David, Pſal. 18. 24. According
to the cleanneſſe of my
hands hath he recompenced
me, &amp;c. His ſpeech notes
ſome ſimilitude or likeneſſe:
as for example, The
more by-ends or carnall
deſires you had in praying,
and the more you
mingled of theſe with
your holy deſires, and the

more want of zeale, fervency,
&amp;c. were found in
your prayers, the more
you ſhall (it may be) finde
of bitterneſſe mingled
with the mercy, when it
is granted; and ſo much
imperfection, and want of
comfort in it: ſo ſayes David
in the ſame Pſal. verſe
25. 26. With the pure thou
wilt ſhew thy ſelfe pure.
Pure prayers have pure
bleſſings; &amp; è contra: With
the foward thou wilt ſhew
thy ſelfe froward: and againe,
as you in praying
ſometimes ſlackened and
grew cold, ſo you might
ſee the buſineſſe in like
manner to coole, and caſt
backward: as when Moſes
hands were downe, Amalck

prevailed; but when they
were lifted up, Iſrael had
the better, Exod. 17. 12.
God let him ſee a proportion,
which argued his
prayer was the meanes of
prevailing. A man findes
in praying, that his ſuite
ſometimes ſticks, and goes
not on as he expected, this
is becauſe he gives not ſo
good a fee as he was wont,
and doth not ply God, and
ſolicite him; but on the
contrary, when hee was
ſtirred up to pray, then
ſtill hee found things to
goe well: by this a man
may clearely ſee, that it
was the praier which God
did heare and regarded.
Thus likewiſe when a
man ſees hils and dales in

a buſineſſe, faire hopes often,
and then all daſht againe,
and the thing in the
end brought to paſſe, let
him looke back upon his
prayers: didſt not thou in
like maner juſt thus deale
with God? When thou
hadſt prayed earneſtly,
and thought thou hadſt
even carried it, then daſh
all againe, by interpoſing
ſome ſin, and thus againe
and againe? Herein God
would have you obſerve
a proportion; and it may
help you to diſcern, how,
and when they are anſwered,
and obtained by prayer;
becauſe God deales
thus with you therein in
ſuch a proportion to your
prayers.
            
            
               
               
                  Chap. 8.CHAP. VIII.
               
                  Seven Obſervations more,
from the effects which
the accompliſhment of
the mercy hath upon the
heart, &amp;c.
               
               
                  §. 1. If the thing obtained drawes the heart neerer to God, and to reioyce in his favour in it, more than in the thing.FOurthly, thou mayeſt
diſcerne whether they
bee in anſwer to thy prayers,
by the effects upon thy
heart.
               As 1. If the thing that
is granted upon thy prayers,
draw thy heart more
neere unto God, it is then
certaine, that it was granted
as an anſwer to thy
prayers. Things granted
out of ordinary providence
onely, doe increaſe

our luſts, and are ſnares to
us; as Saul gave David his
daughter Michol to be a
ſnare to him:Pſal. 69. 22. So their full
tables are made ſnares: ſo
GOD gave the Iſraelites
their will, the things they
deſired, but withall gave
them up to their luſts, Pſal.
106. 15. hee gave them
their requeſts, but ſent
leanneſſe into their ſoules;
the Quailes might fat
ſome of their bodies that
ſurvived, yet their ſoules
grew leane: there was a
curſe upon their Spirits:
this new delicate food
made their bodies more
luſtfull, they did eate and
drinke,
                  Exod. 32. 6 
                  and roſe up to play.
But things obtained by
prayer are ſanctified to us,

for every thing is ſanctified
by prayer,
                  1. Tim. 4. 5 ſo as it ſhall
not inſnare nor intangle
our hearts: a thing obtained
by prayer; as it came
from God; ſo a man will
returne it to God, and uſe
it for his glory: So Hannah
having obtained Samuel
by prayer, ſhee returnes
him unto God, 1. Sam. 1. 27
28. For this childe I prayed,
and God gave me my petition,
and therefore alſo I have
lent him to the Lord as long
as hee liveth. If therefore
thou findeſt this his dealing
with thee, in anſwering
thee, to be a kindely
motive to cauſe thee to
mourne for ſin, and to bee
as a reſtraint againſt ſin,
it is a ſigne it was the fruit

of praier: Thus it wrought
with David, Pſal. 6. 8. Away
from mee yee that work iniquity:
God hath heard the
voice of my weeping.
               
               Alſo if thou rejoyceſt
in God, more than in the
thing obtained: ſo Hannah
begins her ſong when ſhe
bleſſeth God for her child;
My heart rejoyceth in the
Lord, &amp;c. 1. Sam. 2. 1. Shee
rejoyceth not ſo much in
the gift as in the giver;
and his favour more in
this that her prayer was
anſwered, then in the
thing obtained: this is a
ſigne of having obtained
the mercy through prayers,
when it is thus ſanctified
unto a mans ſpirit.
               
                  §. 2. Prayer anſwered enlargeth the heart with thankfulneſſe.2 Prayers anſwered

will inlarge thy heart
with thankefulneſſe, and
thus uſually they doe;
ſelfe-love makes us more
forward to pray, than to
give thankes; for nature is
all of the craving and taking
hand: but where
grace is, there will be no
eminent mercie gotten
with much ſtrugling, but
there will be a continued
particular thankfull remembrance
of it a long
while after, with much inlargement:
and As prayers
abounded, ſo will thankſgiving
abound alſo. Hannah,
ſhee makes a Song, 1. Sam.
1. 2. Great bleſſings that
are wonne with prayer,
are worne with thankfulneſſe:
ſuch a man will not

aſk new, but he will withall
give thankes for old.
Thankfulneſſe, of all duties,
proceeds from pure
grace, therefore if the ſpirit
ſtirs thee unto it, it is a
ſigne he made the prayer;
What thankes ſhall I render
to God, for the joy I have in
you, ſaith S. Paul, 1. Theſſ. 3.
9, 10? So in all his other
Epiſtles, all thoſe hee
writes to, as he prayes for
them, ſo hee tells them,
he gives thanks for them,
and for their graces which
he had prayed for. And if
anſwering prayers for
others, makes S. Paul ſo
thankfull, what when for
himſelfe? Prayer and
thanks, are like the double
motion of the lungs,

the ayre that is ſucked in
by prayer, is breathed
forth againe by thanks: Is
thy heart afreſh inlarged,
as to mourne for paſt ſins
long ſince committed, ſo
in like manner, to give
thankes for paſt mercies
wonne with long prayers,
and this for a long while
after? it is a ſign that they
were obtained by prayer.
               
                  §. 3. If this encourageth thee to go to God againe.3 If the mercy obtained
doth encourage thee
to goe to GOD another
time, to pray againe the
more confidently and fervently,
it is a ſigne thou
haſt got the former that
way: For the Holy Ghoſt
having once ſhewed thee
this way of procuring
mercy, hence it is, thou

art thus ready to take the
ſame courſe another time.
Pſal. 116. 2. The Lord hath
heard mee, and I will call on
him as long as I live. I know
(ſayes hee) now what
courſe to take, if I be in
any want, even to call upon
him; and he calls upon
others to doe ſo too.
               
                  § 4. It makes a man carefull to performe his vows made in prayer, to obtaine it.4 When God having
heard thy prayers upon
ſolemne vowes made by
thee, thy heart is made
carefull to pay thoſe
vowes, which thou didſt
make in the time of thy
ſuing to GOD for that
mercy, this may be an argument
to thee, the thing
being granted, that thy
prayer was heard. For
firſt, it argueth, that thy

heart it ſelfe doth ſecretly
make ſuch an account,
that upon them God did
grant the thing, and thou
doſt therefore make conſcience
to return all again
to God in ſervice, as the
condition of thy Indentures
made with him; and
as an homage due, and an
acknowledgement for ever,
that ſuch a mercy was
won by prayer; and by
this preſerveſt the memory
of the receit of that
mercy: vowes being of
the nature of homage:
and ſecondly, in this alſo
it is an evidence, that the
thing was obtained by
prayer, in that God cals for
thoſe vowes from thee,
by his Spirit in thy heart,

and ſtirs thee up to perform
them; it argues that
in relation to thy prayers
anſwered, He takes them
as dues from thee, that having
diſpatcht thy ſuite,
He now calls for what
was agreed to bee given
him when it ſhould bee
performed. And thirdly,
in that alſo he doth accept
the payment of theſe thy
vows of thee, he acknowledgeth
that thoſe vowes
and prayers were heard:
for as Manoah ſaid in another
caſe, If hee meant to
have deſtroyed us,
                  Iudg. 13. 23 
                  hee would
not have accepted a ſacrifice:
ſo in this caſe it may
be ſaid, if God had not
heard thy prayers, hee
would not have accepted

thy vowes after thy praying.
Thus David, Pſal. 66.
13, 14. I will pay thee my
vowes, which my lips have
uttered, and my mouth hath
ſpoken, when I was in my
trouble; the reaſon follows,
v. 17, 19. becauſe that Verily
God hath heard me, when
I cryed to him: and ſo Eliphaz
in Iob doth connect
and hang theſe two together,
Iob 22. 27. Thou ſhalt
make thy prayer to him, and
he ſhall heare thee, and thou
ſhalt pay thy vowes: This
which he ſpeakes of paying
his vowes, was not
onely as it was to be his
duty, but alſo as a conſequent
that would follow
the other, that when his
prayers ſhould be heard,

he thereupon would performe
his vowes: for his
ſcope is to move Iob to
turne to God, ſhewing
what benefit would accrue
to him by it, and amongſt
others this: The hearing
his prayers, and performing
his vowes.
               
                  5 If a man ſees by faith, and acknowledgeth God
                     
                        •
                      ſole han
                        •
                      in the accompliſhment.5 When thou art inabled
by faith, to ſee cleerly
Gods hand ſhewed forth
in the effecting of that
mercy over and above the
power of ſecond cauſes,
and to acknowledge it to
his glory: for the truth is,
one maine cavilling reaſon
in our blinde hearts,
whereby wee are uſually
hindred and put by from
apprehending our prayers
to be anſwered, when

yet the thing is done, wee
ſhall find to be, that our
eyes are terminated and
bounded in ſecond cauſes,
and not raiſed to ſee
Gods hand in the thing:
therefore on the contrary,
when God inableth
thee to ſee that hee hath
done thee this kindneſſe,
ſo as thy minde is cleere
in it, this is a fruit of his
hearing thy prayers: And
this you will uſually finde
to be true, that ſo much
faith and dependance as you
had upon God in prayer
for the obtaining of a
mercy, ſo much faith and
acknowledgement you will
have in the accompliſhment
of it. Parallel with this rule
is that other, which in another

caſe is uſually given,
that in performance
of duties, ſo much as the
ſoul did goe out of it ſelfe
to God, for ſtrength to
performe them, ſo much,
when they are performed,
will the heart acknowledge
Gods aſſiſtance
and be humbled: And this
is a ſigne of prayer being
heard upon this ground,
becauſe Gods end of hearing
prayers is, that wee
might glorifie him. So Pſal.
50. 15. Call upon me in the
day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou ſhalt
glorify mee. Therefore
when the heart hath prayed
much for a mercy, with
dependance before the
obtaining of it, and then

is enabled to exalt God
when it is obtained; it is a
ſigne that God did it in
relation to thoſe prayers.
For there is that connexion
made betweene theſe,
as between the cauſe and
the effect, I will heare thee,
and thou ſhalt glorifie me.
David, when he was delivered
out of all his troubles,
(as when hee made
that 18. Pſal. he was, as appeares
by the title of it)
then at the 6. verſe, he relates
how he had prayed,
and how hee was heard;
and ſee thereupon how
his heart was enlarged to
acknowledge God alone
to have done all, in the reſt
of that Pſalme; ſo from
the 27. and alſo from the

31. ver. When wee ſee
Angels from God, beyond
the power of ſecond
cauſes deſcending,
it is a ſigne, that prayers,
as Angels, firſt aſcended,
and obtained that mercy.
Thus alſo the Church
Eſay 26. having obtained
thoſe deliverances by
prayer, ver. 17. (for which
there ſhe makes that ſong
by way of thankfulneſſe)
ſhe aſcribes all unto God,
ver. 12. Thou haſt wrought
all our workes for us, and
ver. 18. Verily we have not
wrought any deliverance in
the earth.
               
               
                  §. 6. With the mercy, ſometimes a ſpeciall evidence comes in, that it is obtained by prayer.6 When with the mercy
there commeth the aſſurance
of Gods love, and
an evidence of his favour,

when GOD ſends not a
bare token only, but a letter
alſo with it, to beare
witneſſe of his love, in
which the token is wrapt.
I need not make that a
ſign, for when this comes
with a mercy, it carries its
owne evidence, you will
then know well enough
that it is the fruit of prayer.
               
                  §. 7. By the evēt; things obtained by prayer, prove reall and ſtable mercies.7 Laſtly, it will be evident
by the event; things
obtained by prayer have
few thornes in them, the
curſe is taken out, but
what comes but by ordinary
providence, comes
as it were up of it ſelfe alone,
and like the earth
untilled, is full of thornes,
and bryers, and many vexations:

The reaſon is,
for what comes in by
prayer comes as a bleſſing,
and ſo no ſorrow is added to
it; and alſo becauſe prayer
killeth thoſe inordinate
luſts, which is the cauſe
of that vanity and vexation
which is in the things
enjoyed. But when the
bleſsing of God maketh rich,
he addeth no ſorrow with it,
Prov. 10. 22. Things long
deferred, at laſt obtained
by prayer, prove moſt cō
                  fortable,
and in a ſetled
manner ſuch; they prove
ſtanding and ſtable bleſſings;
and what trouble
the heart was put to in the
deferring, it is recompenced
by the more ſetled
conſtant immixt ſweetneſſe

in the enjoying;
prayer having long perfumed
it, and the thing being
ſteeped therein, it
proves exceeding pleaſant.
So Prov. 13. 12. Hope
deferred makes the heart
ſicke, but when the deſire
comes, it is a tree of life, and
heales that ſickneſſe, and
abundantly comforts the
heart. Thus Iſaac found
Rebekkah a great bleſſing,
and a comfortable wife to
him, Gen. 24. ult. Such a
comfort alſo was Iſaac to
Abraham, Gen. 17. 18, 19.
A ſonne indeed, a ſonne of
laughter, as his name ſignifies:
and ſuch was Samuel
to Hannah, ſhee had
not onely a ſonne of him,
but a good ſon, a bleſſed

ſon, a Prophet, and the
Judge of the people of
God: whereas Iacob getting
the bleſſing, but without
prayer, how imbittered
was it to him, (though
a bleſſing to him in the event)
by twenty yeeres
baniſhment from his mothers
houſe? When Iſrael
themſelves ſet up a King,
but not by me, as God ſaies,
what a puniſhment was
he to them? given in wrath,
and taken away in anger:
Hoſ. 13. 11.
            
            
               
               
                  Chap. 9CHAP. IX.
               
                  Conſiderations to quiet the
heart, and to help it to diſcerne
an anſwer to, and
acceptation of the prayer
when the thing is not
accompliſht.
               
               
                  § 1. The thing prayed for is not alwaies granted, when yet the prayer is heard.BUt now the next and
more difficult queſtion
is, When the thing is not
granted, how ſhall we then
diſcerne and know, that
God doth notwithſtanding
heare the prayer?
               Concerning which, I
muſt premiſe this, that it
is true, that alwayes the
very thing it ſelfe deſired
is not granted, when
yet the prayer is heard.

Chriſt prayed, the Cup
might paſſe from him,
which though ſome interpret
the word paſsing,
for the ſhort continuance
of the brunt, and that
therefore in that reſpect
hee was heard directly in
what he asked: yet if ſo,
why was that clauſe if it be
poſsible, added? that argues
his petition was for a totall
removall, yet with
ſubjection to Gods will;
for he knew there was no
great impoſſibility in a
ſhort removall of it: nay,
it was impoſſible but that
it ſhould paſſe, Acts 2. 24.
But howſoever, it is plain
in Moſes, about his going
into Canaan: Deut. 3.
26. I beſought the Lord,
                  
ſayes hee, ver. 23. and hee
was angry with mee, and
would not heare me. ver. 26.
Likewiſe ere I come to reſolve
the caſe, an objection
is alſo to be removed,
which is,
               That if the Spirit of
GOD doth make every
faithfull prayer in us, as
Rom. 8. 26. it is ſaid Hee
doth; wee know not what to
pray for, but the Spirit helpeth
our infirmities, &amp;c. and
he ſearcheth the deep things
of God, as it is ſaid, 1 Cor. 2.
that therefore hee knowing
that GOD will not
grant ſuch a thing, you
may think that he ſhould
not ſtirre up the heart to
pray for that which God
meanes to deny, but alwayes

guide the heart aright,
and not let us erre
or miſſe in the things wee
pray for. To this, in briefe
by way of anſwer.
               
                  An objection anſwered:1. The Spirit makes
not prayers in us, alwayes
according to what Gods
ſecret will and foreknowledge
is,That though the Spirit knows Gods mind, and teacheth us what to pray for; yet the thing prayed for may not bee granted. but according to
his revealed will to us,
both in his word, and in
his providence, as things
therein are preſented to
us, and doe lie before our
view, and ſo not alwayes
according to what hee
meanes to doe, but according
to what it is our duty
to pray moſt for: for hee
concurres to aſsiſt us to
pray, as he doth in preaching
or uſing other ſuch

like meanes and Ordinances,
wherein though the
ſpirit knowes whom God
meanes to convert, whom
not, yet he aſſiſts us Miniſters
in our ſpirits oftentimes
as much to preach to
thoſe hee meanes not to
convert, as to thoſe hee
meanes to convert: Hee
dealing with us therein
according to what is our
duty, not according to
what is his decree.
               Againe, ſecondly, that
phraſe helpes to anſwer
this, when hee is ſaid to
helpe our infirmities, and
therefore not according
to his owne vaſt knowledge,
doth he frame our
prayers, but ſo, as hee applies
his aſſiſtance to our

infirme, weake, and narrow
apprehenſions, and
ſtirres up deſires in us to
ſuch things, as according
to our knowledge wee
are in duty to conceive,
and which by all wee can
ſee, by what is afore us revealed
in his providence,
we thinke to be moſt for
our good, and his glory;
and God accepts ſuch deſires
as from us, but yet
doth for us according to
the largeneſe of his owne
love.
               
                  §. 2. A miſtake to pray abſolutely for ſuch bleſſings as are not abſolutely promiſed.And ſo now to come
to the caſe propounded,
and therein unto helps to
pacifie, and direct the
heart about thoſe prayers
at which the things are
not granted.
               
                  
And firſt, how diddeſt
thou frame thy prayer for
that thing which is denyed
thee? Didſt thou pray
for it abſolutely, and peremptorily
as ſimply beſt
for thee? thou muſt not
then think much, if ſuch
a prayer bee denyed, for
therein thou wenteſt beyond
thy commiſſion: but
if thou didſt pray for it
conditionally, and with an
(if) as Chriſt did, if it be
poſsible (which inſtance is
a ſtrong ground for ſuch
kinde of prayers) and not
my will, but thy will be done,
ſo, as thou didſt referre it
unto, and truſt Gods judgement
in the thing, and not
thine owne, onely didſt
put him in mind as thy

duty was, of what was repreſented
to thee as beſt
for thee in view, and ſo
left it to him to caſt, and
didſt, referre it to His will
and wiſedome:In which when we are denied we are to reſt in Gods judgment as beſt for us and ſo interpret the prayer anſwered. Then thy
prayer may be moſt fully
anſwered and heard, and
yet the thing denied, and
thou art to interpret, and
God takes meaning and
mind revealed in the event
in the beſt ſenſe,
which way ſoever it falls:
for otherwiſe, CHRIST
had not been heard, when
yet, the Text ſayes, Hee
was heard in all hee feared,
Hebr. 5. 7.
               
                  § 3. There may be a reſervation in the denial, for ſome greater mercy.2. Obſerve, if there
were not a reſervation in
that denial, for ſome greater
and further mercy,

whereof that deniall was
the foundation. Thus
1 oftentimes ſome great
croſſe is prevented, by the
deniall of a thing, which
we were urgent for: if we
had had many of our deſires,
we had been undone:
So it was a mercy to David,
that his childe was
taken away, for whoſe life
he was yet ſo earneſt, who
would have been but a living
monument of his
ſhame. It was alſo a mercy
to David, that Abſalom
was taken away, (whom
ſurely he prayed much for,
for hee loved him much)
who if he had lived, might
have beene the ruine of
him and his houſe. As a
wicked mans deliverance

and the granting his requeſt
layes a foundation,
and is a reſervation of
him to a worſe Judgement:
So, the deniall of a
Godly mans prayer is for
his greater good, and is
laid as a foundation of a
greater mercy: 2 and againe,
oftentimes the very
deniall breaks a mans
heart, and brings him nearer
to God, puts him upon
ſearching into his wayes,
and eſtate, and in his prayers
to ſee what ſhould be
amiſſe therein, which alone
is a great mercy; and
better then the thing, ſeeing
by the loſſe of that
one thing hee learns how
to pray better, and ſo to
obtaine a hundred better

things afterward. Chriſt
deſired the Cup might paſſe,
it did not; and that was
the foundation of our ſalvation,
&amp; the way to His
glory: Hee being to paſſe
through that ſuffering into
His glory: The woman
that had the bloody iſſue,
though ſhee uſed many
meanes, and haply prayers
among the reſt, and all in
vaine, yet none tooke effect;
that in the end ſhee
might come to Chriſt, and
have both body and ſoule
healed at once.
               
                  §. 4. There may be a tranſmutation of the thing denied, into ſome other bleſſing that is better of the ſame kind.3 Obſerve if there be
to a tranſmutation and a
tranſlation or turning of

                     •
                  he thing deſired into
ſome other greater bleſ
                  
                     •
                  ing
of the ſame kind: for

God (all whoſe wayes are
mercy and truth to His people)
doth improve, huſband,
and lay out the precious
ſtocks of their prayers,
to the beſt advantage,
in things, whereby the
greateſt returns and gains
may accrue: as old Iacob
laid not his Hand of bleſſing
as Ioſeph would have
guided them, but laid the
right hand upon the yonger
Sonne, whom Ioſeph
did ſet at his left: So often
doth God take off his
hand of bleſſing from the
thing we prayed for, and
laies &amp; diſcovers it in another
more for our good:
and as God giving Iſaac
the power and priviledge
to bleſſe a ſonne, though

                  Iſaac hee intended it for
Eſau, yet God unbeknown
to him tranſmitted it to
Iacob, yet ſo, as the bleſſing
was not loſt: Thus
is it in our prayers for bleſſings
both upon our ſelves
and others. There is often
a tranſmutation, never
a fruſtration of them:
which may as truely and
directly bee called an anſwer
to the prayer; As if a
factor beyond Sea, when
the owner ſends for ſuch
and ſuch commodities,
ſuppoſing them more vendible
and advantagious,
but the Factor knowing
the ſtate of things,
and the prices, ſends him

                     •
                  ver in ſtead of them,
ſuch as ſhall ſell better,

and bring in more profit,
may be ſaid to anſwer his
letters, and that better,
then if hee had ſent thoſe
very commidities he writ
for; Thus Abrahams prayers
for Iſhmael were turned
for Iſaac: Davids for
the Childe to Solomon.
               
               
                  §. 1. God anſwers to the ground of our prayers.4 Obſerve if in the
end God doth not anſwer
thee ſtill according to the
ground of thy prayer:
that is, ſee if that holy end,
intention, and affection,
which thou hadſt in prayer,
be not in the end fully
ſatisfied, though not in
the thing thou didſt deſire:
for God anſwers,
Secundum cardinem, according
to the hinge which
the prayer turnes upon.

As when a General is ſent
out with an Army, by a
King or a State, who give
him many particular directions,
how to order
and diſpoſe, and manage
the war, although in many
particulars that fall
out, wherein they could
not foreſee to give ſo punctuall
and particular directions,
he ſwerve from the
directions, yet if he keeps
to the intent of their
Commiſſion, and doth
what is moſt advantagious
for their ends, he may
bee ſaid to keepe to his
Commiſſion. For as they
ſay of the Law, Mens leg is
eſt lex▪ the mind of the Law
is the Law, not the bare
words it is printed in: ſo

the Meaning of the Spirit
is the prayer, Rom. 8. 27.
and not ſimply the things
deſired, wherein wee expreſſe
thoſe our deſires:
and ſtill the meaning, the
intent, the ground of our
prayers ſhall be anſwered.
To open this, the maine
ends, and meanings of
our hearts in our requeſts
are Gods glory, the Churches
good, and our owne
particular comfort and
happineſſe: we can deſire
but comfort, and a man
looketh out, and ſpieth
out ſuch a particular mercie,
which hee thinketh
tends much to Gods glory,
and his happineſſe,
and yet that thing is denied;
yet notwithſtanding

God will anſwer him according
to the meaning
of his prayers, his glory
ſhall certainely be advanced,
even for that prayer
of his, ſome other way,
and his comfort made up,
which is the common deſire
of all mankinde: and
thou canſt have but comfort,
let the thing bee
what it will that conveighs
it to thee; and God
will take order that that
comfort thy ſoule deſired,
thou ſhalt have come in
one way or other, which
when it doth, thou canſt
not but ſay thy prayers
are heard. For as God fulfils
his promiſes, ſo hee
heares prayers, there is
the ſame reaſon of both:

now God hath promiſed,
Hee that leaves Father and
Mother, ſhall have an hundred
fold: not in ſpecie, as
we ſay, in kinde, this cannot
alwayes bee fulfilled,
for an hundred Fathers
he cannot have. God fulfills
it not therefore alwayes
in the ſame kinde,
but in ſome other things,
which ſhall be more then
a hundred Fathers would
bee.
               
                  Moſes hee prayes hee
might goe into Canaan,
God anſwers the ground
of his prayer, though not
in the matter in it expreſſed
and deſired, and that
both for Moſes his comfort
and his owne glory;
for hee takes him up to

heaven, the true Canaan,
whereof that Canaan was
but a type, and hee appoints
Ioſhua a freſh and a
young man, comming on
in the world, and one
whom Moſes himſelfe had
tutored and brought up,
and was his pupill, ſervant
and attendant, Num.
6. 11, 28. and this was
more for Gods glory, for
Ioſhua was therein to bee
he type of Chriſt leading
us to heaven, which
the Law (of which Moſes
was the type) could not
bring us unto by reaſon of
the weakneſſe of it; and he
being yong did it better:
and it was not ſo much alſo
for Gods glory, that
one man ſhould doe all;

and whereas Moſes deſired
to have the honour of it;
in that his ſervant that attended
him, and had been
brought up by him, and
had all from him, that hee
was the man ſhould doe
it, was well nigh as great
an honour to Moſes, as if
hee had beene the leader
himſelfe. And ſo David
when hee deſired to build
the Temple and an houſe
to God, for the like reaſons
God denied it, but
yet honoured him to prepare
the materialls, and to
draw the patterne, as alſo
in that his Son did it, who
was therein alſo the like
type of Chriſt, being a
Prince of peace, but David
a man of blood and war,

and likewiſe God accepted
this of David, as if he
had built it, and will recompence
him as much.
               
                  §. 6. God when hee denies, yet ſometimes yeelds far in it, to give ſatisfaction to his childe.5. Obſerve, if in the
thing which thou haſt
prayed much about,
though it be denyed thee,
yet if God doth not endeavour
to give thee (as I
may ſo ſpeake) all ſatisfaction
that may be, even as
if hee were tender of denying
thee, and therefore
doth much in it for thy
prayers ſake, though the
concluſion proves otherwiſe,
as being againſt
ſome other purpoſe of
his, for ſome other ends:
As when hee denied Moſes
to goe into the Land
of Canaan, hee did it with

much reſpect (as I may ſo
ſpeak with reverence) to
Moſes: he yeelded as far
as might bee, for hee let
him leade them, till hee
ſhould come to the very
borders; and hee let him
ſee that good Land, carrying
him up to an hill, and
(as it is thought) by a miracle
inabled his ſight to
view the whole Land;
and the man hee choſe to
performe this work, was
his ſervant, which was a
great honour to Moſes;
that one brought up by
him ſhould ſucceed him.
So when Abraham prayed
for Iſhmael, Oh let Iſmael
live in thy ſight, Gen. 17. 18.
God went as far in granting
his requeſt as might

be; for, ſayes hee, ver. 20.
I have heard thee, and I have
bleſſed him, and I will make
him fruitfull, and multiply
him exceedingly, and hee
ſhall beget twelve Princes;
but my covenant I will eſtabliſh
with Iſaac. So likewiſe,
when in caſting that
thing, thou didſt ſeeke at
his hands, he ſhews an extraordinary
hand in turning
it; it is a ſigne he had
a reſpect to thee, that hee
would vouchſafe to diſcover
his hand ſo much in
it; let the thing fall which
way it will, if Gods hand
appeare much in it, thou
mayeſt comfortably conclude,
that there is ſome
great thing in it, and that
prayer wrought that miracle

in it, to diſpoſe it ſo;
and that there is ſome
great reaſon why hee denies
thee, and a great reſpect
had to thy prayers, in
that he is pleaſed to diſcover
ſo extraordinary a
providence about it.
               
                  §. 7. Obſerve the effects that denials have upon the heart. As firſt, if a man doth acknowledge God righteous in it, &amp;c.Laſtly, looke into the
effect of that deniall upon
thine owne heart; as,
               1 If thy heart be inlarged
to acknowledge God,
to be holy and righteous
in his dealings with thee,
and thine own unworthineſſe
the cauſe of his denying
thee. Thus we often
find the Saints expreſſing
themſelves in their
prayers: that Pſal. 22.
though typically made of
Chriſt; yet as it was penned

by David, and as it
may concerne his perſon,
it may ſerve for an inſtance
for this, I cry in the
day time, but thou heareſt
not: this might have made
him jealous of God; but
ſaies he, Thou art holy, &amp;c.
and dealeſt now with me
in an holy manner, and
art juſt in it: Others have
called on thee, and have
been heard, though I now
for my unworthineſſe am
denied: But I am a worme.
It might have put a man
off, when he ſhould think,
others are heard, but not
I, but it puts not him off,
but humbles him, I am a
worme, &amp;c. And Thou art
holy.
               
               
                  Seco
                        •••
                     y, if God fill the heart with a holy contentment in the deniall.2 If God fill thy heart

with an holy contentmēt
in the deniall; if he ſpeak
to thy heart, as he did to
Moſes, when hee denied
him, Deut. 3. Let it ſuffice
thee; if as to S. Paul, when
hee was ſo earneſt about
removing that buffeting,
if thou getteſt but ſuch an
anſwer as that to him, My
grace is ſufficient; or that
ſome ſuch like conſideration
is dropt in that ſtayes
thee: It was the effect of
Davids ſeven dayes faſting,
that he did ſo contentedly
beare the loſſe of
the Childe, which his ſervants
thought would have
overwhelmed him, 2. Sam.
12. 19, 20, 21. But a conſideration
was dropt in,
which was the fruit of his

prayer, That he ſhould goe
to him, not hee returne hither;
and his minde was
comforted thereby, in ſo
much, as it is ſaid, ver. 24.
That he comforted Bath ſheba
alſo.
               
               
                  Thirdly, if the heart be thankfull out of faith, when denied.3 If thou canſt bee
thankfull to God out of
faith, that God hath caſt
and ordered all for the
beſt, though hee hath denyed
thee; and although
thou ſeeſt no reaſon, but
that the thing prayed for,
would have beene for the
beſt, yet art thankfull upon
the deniall of it, out
of faith reſting in Gods
judgement in it: As David,
in all thoſe forementioned
places was, Thou
art holy, that inhabiteſt the

prayſes of Iſrael; he praiſes
God for all this: David
before he did eate, after
his ſeven dayes faſting
for the childe, aroſe, And
went firſt into the Temple
and worſhipped, 2. Sam. 12.
20. and of what kinde of
worſhip it was, appeares
by his anointing himſelfe
and changing his raiment,
which was in token of rejoycing
and thankſgiving,
and it fell out to
him according to his
faith, for preſently after,
Solomon was begotten,
verſ. 24.
               
                  §. 4. If the heart be not diſcouraged, for continuing ſtill to pray for other things.4 If thou canſt pray
ſtill and giveſt not over,
although thou ſtandeſt
for mercies which thou
miſſeſt; if when thou haſt

mercies granted, thou feareſt
moſt, and when denied,
loveſt moſt, and art
not diſcouraged, thy prayers
are heard, Pſal. 80. 4.
Though God ſeemed angry
with their praiers, yet
they pray, and expoſtulate
with him, and give
not over, for they made
that Pſalme as a Prayer,
And how long wilt thou be
angry againſt the prayer of
thy people? So Pſal. 44. 17.
Though wee are caſt among
Dragons, yee wee have not
beene falſe in thy Covenant.
So ſay thou, I will pray
ſtill, though I never have
an anſwer in this life. It
moves ingenuous natures
to ſee men take repulſes
and denialls well, which

proud perſons will not
doe: and ſo it moves
God.

not after them when they

if they had not prayed:
who ſtill venture, &amp; have
a great ſtock of prayers

going, but looke not after
the returns that are made,
caſt not up their commings

prayers; and when they
have prayed, ſit down diſcouraged,
as not making
account in earneſt that
ever they ſhall heare of
their prayers againe, even
as if they had been but as
words caſt away: as beating
the ayre; as bread caſt
upon the waters, which they
thinke ſinks, or is carried
away, and they ſhall finde
it no more; but herein
you deſpiſe Gods Ordinance,
and erre, not knowing
the power of prayers; and
yee contemne the Lord
But you wil ſay as they in
the Prophet ſaid, Wherein

in doe wee contemne him?
if you aſkt a man a queſtion,
and when you had
done, did turne your back
upon him, as ſcoffing Pilate
aſkt in ſcorne of
Chriſt, What is truth? but
would not ſtay for an anſwere,
did you not contemne
him? as not to anſwer
when a queſtion is
aſked you, is contempt, ſo
not to regard the anſwer
made, when you have
beene earneſt in begging,
is no leſſe contempt alſo:
if you had writ letters to
a very friend about important
buſineſſe, and had
earneſtly ſolicited him for
an anſwer, and hee were
carefull in due time to
ſend one, if you ſhould

make account to heare of
him no more, ſhould you
not wrong him in your
thoughts? Or if hee did
write, if you ſhould not
vouchſafe to reade over
his anſwer, were it not a
contempt of him? ſo is it
here, when you have been
earneſt with God for bleſſings,
and regard not the
anſwer: and becauſe verily
this is a fault among us,
I will therefore endevour
to diſcover to you the cauſes
and diſcouragements,The cauſes of this neglect, are of two ſorts.
which though they keepe
you not from praying, yet
from this earneſt expectation,
and reall, and true
making account to heare
of anſwers of your prayers;
onely my ſcope is, not

to ſhew you ſo much the
reaſons, why God denies
you many requeſts, as
why even in your owne
hearts you are diſcouraged
after you have prayed,
as if they would not
bee anſwered, although
God doth anſwer them.
Theſe diſcouragements
are partly temptations,
partly ſinfull impediments
wherein wee are more
faulty.
               
                  1 Temptations, want of aſſurāce; as 1. That becauſe your perſons are not accepted your prayers are not.1 Becauſe your aſſurance
that your perſons
are accepted, is weake,
therfore your confidence
that your prayers are
heard, is weake alſo: For
as God doth firſt accept
the perſon, and then our
prayers: ſo the beliefe,

that God doth accept our
perſon is that which alſo
upholds our hearts in
confidence that our prayers
ſhall be granted: this
you may finde in 1 Iohn 5.
13, 14, 15. in the 13. verſ.
he ſayes. Theſe things have
I written to you, that ye may
know you have eternall life:
and upon that aſſurance
this will follow, Verſ. 14,
15. And this is the confidence
that we have in him,
that if we aske any thing according
to his will, he heares
us, &amp;c. And if we know he
heares us, we know we have
the petitions wee deſired of
him. Marke how he links
theſe three together, as
effects and conſequences
each of other. 1. Theſe

things I write unto you, that
you may be aſſured, that life
and heaven is yours, as in
12. and 13. verſes. And upon
that 2. this confidence
wil follow in your hearts,
That God hears you, that is,
that you have his eares open
to you, and his heart
enlarged towards you:
and then 3. if you be aſſured
that God heares you,
then from this will follow
an aſſurance, that You ſhall
have any thing granted you
deſire; yea, and he makes
this one of the maine and
immediate effects of Aſſurance
of juſtification;
therefore he ſayes, this is
the confidence that we have
in him; that is, this effect
there is of this confidence,

for whereas they might
ſay, what benefit will accrue
to us by this aſſurance?
why this ſaies hee,
which is one of the great
and maine priviledges of
a Chriſtian, even aſſurance
that God will heare him;
and not only ſo, but grant
him all his prayers. For
when a man is aſſured
God hath given him his
Son, he will then eaſily be
induced to beleeve and
expect, How ſhal he not with
him give mee all things?
Rom. 8. 32. If once he looks
upon God as a Father, he
will then eaſily conceive
that which Chriſt ſayes,
If Fathers that are evill can
give good things to their
Children, how much more

ſhall not your Father give
his ſpirit, and all good things
to them that aske them: and
if he gave his Son, when
wee did not pray to him,
how much more ſhall hee
not with him give us all
things wee pray for? If a
man comes to ſue to any
man whoſe mind he knew
not, whether hee loved
him or not, he would have
ſmall hope or expectation
of having his ſuite granted,
though hee came againe
and again; but if he
be aſſured he is in favour
with him, according to
that degree of favour, hee
ſuppoſeth himſelf to ſtand
in with him, hee is aſſured
and confident of obtaining
his requeſt.
               
                  
                  2 Of the weakneſſe of our prayers: which is anſwered by three things.
2 Diſcouragement is
the weakneſſe of their
prayers: though a man
thinks his perſon is accepted,
yet alas ſayes he, my
prayers are ſo poore and
weake, as ſurely God will
never regard them. To
remove which, let mee
firſt aſke thee this queſtion:
 Doeſt thou pray with
all thy might? then though
that thy might be weak in
it ſelfe, and in thine owne
apprehenſion ſuch, yet
becauſe it is all the might
which thou haſt, and
which grace hath in thee,
it ſhall be accepted. For
God accepts according to
what a man hath, and not according
to that he hath not.
2 Cor. 8. 12.
               
                  
                   2. Thou art to conſider
that God doth not
heare thee for thy prayers
ſake, though not without
them, but for his Names
ſake, and his Sons ſake, and
becauſe thou art his child,
as the mother when her
child cryes (ſuppoſe it be
a weake child) doth not
neglect to heare and relieve
it: but tenders it not
becauſe it doth cry more
lowd, but becauſe it cries;
and pities it the more the
weaker it is.
               
                   3. Againe, though the
performance in it ſelfe be
weake, yet confidered as
a prayer, it may be ſtrong,
becauſe a weake prayer
may ſet the ſtrong God a
worke, as faith for the act

of it, as produced by us
may be weak, yet becauſe
its object is Chriſt, therefore
it juſtifies: ſo it is in
prayer, it prevailes, not
becauſe of the performance
it ſelfe, but becauſe
of the name, which it is
put up in, even Chriſts
name; and therefore as a
weake faith juſtifies, ſo a
weake prayer prevailes as
well as a ſtronger; and
both for the like reaſon in
both, for faith attributes
all to God, and ſo doth
prayer; for as faith is
meerly a receiving grace,
ſo prayer a begging grace.
And therefore doſt thou
think thy prayers are accepted
at all, notwithſtanding
their weakneſſe? if

that they are accepted,
then they muſt be accepted
as prayers, now if they
be accepted as prayers,
then as effectuall motives
to prevaile with God to
grant the thing you aſke;
for if hee ſhould not accept
them to that end, for
which they were ordained,
it is as if hee accepted
them not at all. As therefore
when he approves of
any mans faith as true and
ſincere, hee approves and
accepts of it to that purpoſe,
for which it was ordained,
which is to ſave
and juſtifie, and to this
end doth as fully accept
the weakeſt act of faith,
as the ſtrongeſt; ſo is it
with their prayers, which

being ordained as a means
to obtaine mercies from
him, if hee accepts them
at all, it is with relation
to the accompliſhment
of them, which is their
end.
               4. Men are miſtaken
in judging of the weaknes
of their prayers, they
judge of the weakneſſe of
their prayers by their expreſſions,
and gifts in performing
them, or by the
ſtirring and overflow of
affections, whereas the
ſtrength &amp; vigor of prayer
ſhould be eſtimated
from the faith, the ſincerity,
the obedience, the
deſires expreſt in it. As it
is not the lowdneſſe of a
Preachers voice, but the

weight and holineſſe of
the matter, and ſpirit of
the Preacher, that moves
a wiſe, and an intelligent
hearer: ſo not gifts, but
graces in prayers are they
that move the Lord. The
ſtrength of prayer lies not
in words, but in that it is
fitted to prevaile with
God; one prayer is not
more ſtrong then another,
further then it is ſo
framed as it hath power
with God more or leſſe; as
of Iacob it is ſaid, he had power
with God, Hoſ. 12. Now
prayers move God, not as
an Oratour moves his
hearers, but as a child
moves his father: two
words of a childe humbled,
and crying at his fathers

feet, will prevaile
more then penned orations.
Rom. 8. It is the meanning
of the ſpirit, that God
lookes unto, more then
the expreſſions: for the
groans there are ſaid to be
unutterable. Hezechiahs expreſſions
were ſo rude
and broken, that he ſayes,
Eſay 38. 14. that he did but
chatter, (hee being then
ſick,) even as a crane, yet
God heard them.
               
                  3. So often failings of anſwers: anſwered by foure things.A third diſcouragement
is faylings of anſwers;
 I have prayed often
and long, and I have been
ſeldome or never anſwered,
and therefore I make
little account of my prayers,
that they are heard: others
have the revenewes

of their prayers comming
in, but I doe miſſe whatſoever
almoſt I ſtand for:
Therefore ſay they as
thoſe, Why have we faſted,
and thou regardeſt it not?
Iſay 58. 3.
               
                   To remove this, conſider,
1. That thou haſt the
more reaſon to wait, for
thou haſt the more anſwers
to come: for as wicked
men treaſure up wrath,
ſo doe godly men mercy,
and eſpecially by their
prayers; &amp; therefore mercies,
and anſwers do often
come thick together, even
as afflictions alſo doe.
               
                   Suppoſe thou ſhouldſt
have few anſwers concerning
the things thou ſeekeſt
for here, either in

praying for thy ſelfe or
others, yet thy reward is
with the Lord. It is in praying
as in preaching, a man
may preach faithfully
many a yeere, and yet not
convert a ſoule, and yet
a man is not to give over
waiting, but to obſerve
after every Sermon what
good is done, and whether
God will give men
repentance, as it is, 2 Tim.
2. 25. And if none be converted,
yet as Eſay 49. 4. A
mans reward is with the
Lord. Every man ſhall receive
his own reward according
to his own labour. 1 Cor.
3. 8. and not according to
the ſucceſſe of his labour
only. So it is in praying,
though thou miſſeſt againe

and again, &amp; nothing
ſucceeds thou prayeſt for,
yet be not diſcouraged,
for thy reward is with the
Lord, which will come in
one day.
               
                   3. God doth it, not
that hee heares thee not,
but to try thee; for a man
to ſay as David ſayes,
Pſal. 116. 1, 2. God hath
heard my prayer, therefore I
will call upon him as long as
I live, that is nothing ſo
much as to be able to ſay,
Well, I have prayed thus
long, and for theſe many
things, and never ſped,
and yet I will call upon him
whilſt I live, though I find
no anſwer in this life. To
finde commings in, in a
trade, and yet to hold out

trading ſtill, argues not ſo
much faithfulneſſe in a
mans calling, as when a
man hath loſſes, and caſtings
behind hand, and
yet to follow it.
               
                   4. God uſually ſtayes
ſo long that we have done
expecting, Luke 18. 8. The
Elect cry day and night, but
God ſtayes ſo long, ver. 7.
that when he comes hee
findes not faith, they have
done expecting, have forgot
their prayers, and
then hee doth things,
                  Iſai. 64. 
                  they
looked not for.
               
               
                  § 2. A 2. cauſe, are ſinfull diſcouragements, which are three.Other diſcouragements
there are wherein we our
ſelves are more faulty, and
which are our ſins, more
then our temptations,
which yet weaken the expectation

of having our
prayers anſwered: as,
               
                  1 Slothfulneſſe in prayer.1 Slothfulneſſe in prayer,
 when wee doe not put
to all our might in praying,
and then no wonder,
we doe not onely not obtaine,
but that our owne
hearts miſgive us, that we
look for little ſucceſſe and
iſſue of ſuch prayers, Qui
frigidè rogat, docet negare;
he that ſhews himſelf cold
in a ſuite, teaches him he
ſues to to deny him; if
wee ſee one ſeeking to us
faintly, and ſlightly, wee
are not then ſollicitous to
deny him, but thinke hee
will be eaſily put off, and
not thinke much; ſo accordingly
when wee ſhall
obſerve ſo much by our

ſelves, and ſee our ſelves
ſlothfull in praying, and
praying as if we prayed not,
no wonder if by reaſon of
that conſciouſneſſe, wee
looke not after the ſucceſſe
of ſuch prayers,
which in the performance
wee ſlighted; when wee
pray, as if wee were willing
to bee denyed, wee
knowing that the Scripture
ſayes, that the fervent
prayer onely prevailes, that
prayer which is 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,
that ſets all the faculties
on worke, Iames 5. 16.
How ſhould wee then expect
that God ſhould
grant any good thing to
us? For though God ſels
nothing to us for our
prayers, but gives freely,

yet hee would have his
gifts accepted: now without
large deſires, and longings
they would not be
accepted: and what is fervent
prayer, but the expreſſion
of ſuch fervent
deſires? Iacob wreſtled
when he obtained: many
ſeeke to enter, ſayes Chriſt,
but you muſt ſtrive. Now
when wee know theſe
things, and yet are ſlothfull,
how can wee expect
any anſwers at all? will
not the conſciouſneſſe of
it quell all our expectations?
and hence it comes
to paſſe that God proportioning
his dealings with
us to our prayers, becauſe
we ſeeme to pray, and yet
pray not to purpoſe,

therefore God hee ſometimes
ſeemes like one aſleepe,
and then ſometimes
to wake, and make
faire offers to helpe, and
yet falls as it were aſleepe
againe, becauſe we were
thus drowſie in our prayers;
thoſe prayers that awaken
God, muſt awaken
us: Thoſe prayers
that ſtir God, muſt firſt
ſtirre us to lay hold on God
as Iſaiah ſpeakes: as obedience
ſtrengthens faith
and aſſurance, ſo fervency
in prayer begets confidence
of being heard. In
all other things ſlothfulneſſe
doth diſcourage and
weaken expectation: doth
any man expect that riches
ſhould come upon him

when hee doth his buſineſſe
negligently? for it
is the diligent hand that maketh
rich: doth any man
expect a crop and a harveſt,
if hee takes not pains
to plow, and ſowe his
Corne? no more if you
doe not take paines with
your hearts in Prayer, can
you expect an anſwer, or
indeed will you.
               
                  2 Diſcouragement: looking at prayer as a duty rather then as a meanes to obtaine bleſſings.2 Cauſe: or ſinfull
diſcouragement herein,
is looking at prayer onely
as a duty to be performed,
and ſo performing it as a
taſke, and not ſo much
out of deſires ſtirred up
after the things to be obtained,
nor out of faith
that we ſhall obtain them;
which is as if a Phyſitian
                  
having a ſick ſervant, to
whom he preſcribeth, and
commandeth to take ſome
phyſicke to cure him, and
his man ſhould take it indeed
becauſe it is commanded
and preſcribed
by his maſter, looking at
it as an act of duty as hee
obeyes him in other buſineſſes,
but not as looking
at it as a medicine, or
meanes, that will have any
worke upon him to
cure him, and therefore
orders himſelfe as if hee
had taken no ſuch thing.
Thus doe moſt in the
world pray to God, take
prayer as a preſcription only,
but not as a meanes:
they come to God daily,
but as to a Maſter onely in

this performance, not as
to a Father, and thus doing,
no wonder if they
looke for little effect of
prayers: for our expectation
never exceeds or
reaches further then our
end and intention, which
we had in any buſineſſe. If
I perform any Ordinance,
but as a duty, then I reſt
therein, and expect no further:
as if a man preacheth
for filthy lucre onely,
he performs his duty and
then lookes for his hire,
but lookes not after any
other effect of his Sermons:
ſo nor will men
doe after their prayers for
anſwers to them when
they performe them as
duties onely. Now to

help you in this, you are
to looke to two things in
prayer.
                  A directiō. Two things to be lookt at in praying. Acōmand. A promiſe. Firſt to a command
from God. Secondly to
the promiſe of God: and
ſo to conſider it in a double
relation, firſt as a duty,
in reſpect to the Command,
ſecondly as a means to obtaine
or procure bleſſings
at Gods hand in relation
to his promiſe: therefore
in prayer, firſt an act of obedience,
ſecondly an act of
faith is to bee exerciſed,
aske in faith nothing wavering,
Iam. 1. Now the moſt
in the world performe it
as an act of obedience only,
and ſo reſt in the preſent
performance and acceptation
of it, but if a
man pray in faith, hee will

                  pray with an eye to the
promiſes; and looke on
prayer as a meanes for
time to come to obtaine
ſuch or ſuch a mercy at
Gods hands; and if ſo,
then he is not ſatisfied till
hee hath an anſwer of his
prayers, and till then will
wait, as the Church ſayes,
Shee would wait till hee did
ariſe and plead her cauſe.
               
               
                  3 Diſcouragement; falling into ſins againe after praying.A third ſinfull diſcouragement
is returning to
ſinnes after prayers, when
a man hath prayed for
ſome mercy, and riſeth
full of much confidence
that his prayers are heard,
and ſo a while he walkes,
yet falling into a ſin, that
ſin doth daſh al his hopes,
undoes his prayers, (as he

thinkes) and calls them
backe againe, meetes as it
were with the anſwer,
which is Gods meſſenger,
and cauſeth it to returne
to heaven againe. How
often when God had even
granted a petition, and
the decree was a comming
forth, and the grant
newly written, and the
ſeale a ſetting to it, but
an act of treaſon comming
betweene, ſtops it
in the ſeale, and deferres
it, blots and blurreth all,
both prayer and grant
when newly written, and
leaves a guilt in the mind,
which quells our hopes,
and then wee looke no
more after our prayers; and
this eſpecially if when we

were a ſinning, ſuch a
thought came in, (as often
it doth to reſtrain us)
are you not in dependāce
upon God for ſuch a mercy,
and have prayed for
it, and are faire for it,
how then dare you doe
this, and ſin againſt him?
when in this caſe the
heart goes on, this blots
all the prayer, and diſcourageth
a man; for ſaith the
conſcience, will God hear
ſinners? (as he ſaid.) And
thus farre it is true that
ſinning thus between, interrupts
and hinders the
obtaining our petitions,
that anſwerably as wee
doe thus daſh and betray
and undoe our prayers,
                  The anſwer to it. ſo
in a proportion, we finde

in the way to our obtaining
the thing wee prayed
for, ſo many rubbes and
difficulties doe ariſe; for
as wee lay blocks in Gods
way comming towards
us to doe us good, ſo hee
in ours: therefore often
when a buſineſſe goes
proſperouſly on, and wee
think wee ſhall carry it,
comes ſome accident betweene
the cup and the
lip, that caſts all behinde
hand againe, becauſe anſwerably
wee dealt with
God. For when wee had
prayed, and were encouraged
and in good hopes,
then by ſome ſinne or other
wee ſpoyld all, and
bereaved our ſelves of our
expectation. But yet this

you are to conſider, that
as in the end praying uſeth
to overcome ſin in Gods
Children, ſo alſo God in
the end overcomes difficulties,
and brings the
matter to paſſe: and know
it is not ſins paſt ſo much
that hinder the prayers of
Gods people, as the preſent
unfitneſſe and indiſpoſition
of their hearts for
mercy.
            
         
         
            
            TIDINGS
OF PEACE TO
BEE SPOKEN
to Conſciences
diſtreſſed.
            
               Pſal. 85. ver. 8.
               — God will ſpeak peace unto
his people, and to his
Saints, &amp;c.—
            
            
               THE maine thing
intended to bee
inſiſted upon out
of theſe words is diſpatcht,
yet that I may
not leave ſo faire and
fruitfull a crop ſtill ſtanding
upon the ground unreaped,
I will goe on
more briefly to have in
the reſt of that harveſt

the Text affords.
            This Pſalm (as was ſaid)
was penned as a Prophecy
of and prayer for the returne
of Gods people out
of the Captivity of Babylon,
and the ſetling and
eſtabliſhment of that
Church and State upon
its former Baſis, yet ſo as
therein there is a further
and more eſpeciall aime
had to the peace and glory
to bee brought in by
Chriſt, till when this Prophecy
otherwiſe had but
a poore and ſlender accompliſhment,
in regard
of much outward glory or
peace that that Church
enjoyed.
            And therefore the
peace here ſpoken of and

promiſed for the preſent
is to be extended largelier
then to outward proſperity,
or an happy iſſue out
of that calamity, even to
ſpeaking peace to drooping
and weather-beaten
conſciences: and accordingly
we finde this kinde
of peace to have beene
ſpecially promiſed by the
Prophet Iſaiah to the people
at their returne out of
the Captivity, both in
Iſaiah 48. from 20. to the
end, and Iſaiah the 57.
from the 14. to the end,
there being many broken
hearts that had wanted
the light of Gods countenance
long, having beene
during the Captivity, baniſht
from the Ordinances

of the Temple, hanging
up their harps mourning,
whoſe thoughts were
as if God had meant to
deſtroy them, as appeares
Ier. 29. 11. who afterwards
were refreſhed with in
ward peace, at the reſtauration
of thoſe Ordinances,
as well as with
outward, as by thoſe places
doth appeare. Therefore
in relation to this
kind of peace onely I will
at this time handle the
words.
            In the words you
have a diſcovery of Gods
proceedings in treating of
peace or proclaiming war
with his people and ſubjects.
            
               
                  Obſer. 1 1. You ſee that ſometimes

God doth not ſeake
peace to his owne children.
This was their ſtate for
the preſent, when this
Pſalme was penned: Hee
will ſpeake peace, therefore
at preſent he did not; yea,
it may incline us to think
that God at preſent ſpake
the contrary, for the Prophet
ſpeaks this by faith,
as contrary to ſenſe, and
preſent experience; hee
beleeves God intends to
come againe to a treaty
of peace, though now hee
ſeemes to have nothing
but anger, and blood, and
war in his looks, ſpeeches,
and actions; and to threaten
and proclaime warre,
and take up Armes againſt
them. And thus God often

deales with his owne
Children, whether a people
or a particular man:
ſo with a nation, Eſay 63.
10. They rebelled, and hee
fought againſt them: ſo
with a particular man,
God frowned upon and
rated his Child Ephraim,
and ſpake bitter things againſt
him, (it is the phraſe
uſed, Ier. 31. 20.) though
yet Ephraim is my pleaſant
Child ſayes he: David had
not a good word from
him a long time, Pſal. 51. 8.
Make me to heare againe
of joy and gladneſſe. And
Pſal. 50 7. Heare oh my people,
and I will ſpeake, but
not againſt them they
might hope, becauſe hee
ownes them for his people:

               Heare oh Iſrael, and I
will teſtifie againſt thee: and
yet it followes, I am the
Lord thy God. Iob (ſayes,
he did not ſpeake onely againſt
him, but alſo wrote
bitter things, hee wrote as
it were bookes againſt:
him, Iob 13. 26. hee writing
over in his Conſcience
the ſinnes of his youth
in letters of blood and
wrath and terrors for
them.
            
               
                  Obſer. 2 There muſt needs be
ſome great reaſon for this
they being his people, which
is the ſecond thing that
is intimated, and may be
obſerved out of theſe
words, namely, the reaſon,
or moving cauſe provoking
God thus to interrupt

the peace of his people:
they had fallen into
ſome groſſe folly or other,
ſome ſinfull inordinate
diſpoſitions had beene indulged
unto, and nouriſhed
in them, which is uſually,
though not alwayes,
the cauſe of this his dealing:
this is evident by
this, that the concluſion
of their peace, when it is
made up againe hath this
clauſe, as the onely article
of reconciliation between
them, that they returne
no more to folly, implying
they had formerly runne
out into ſome inordinacy,
which to reduce them
from, God had tooke up
armes againſt them, and
thereby taught them wiſdome

to take heed of
loſing, and then buying
peace at ſo deare a rate againe.
And indeed all the
quarrells, that God hath
againſt a Nation, a particular
place, or perſon, that
belongs to him, doe begin
there; They rebelled, and
Hee fought againſt them,
Eſay 63. 8. For the iniquity
of his covetouſneſſe I was
wroth, Iſa 57.
            
               
                  Reaſon. 
                The reaſon is, for anger
is out of love as well
as hatred, which therefore
he expreſſeth though with
griefe, hee ſhould be put
to quarrell with thoſe,
hee hath ſet himſelfe to
loue. And as wicked men,
whom hee alwaies hates,
may out of his patience

have a truce; ſo on the
contrary, with his owne,
God may take up a quarrell,
yet He loves them, &amp;
remembers them with everlaſting
kindneſſe.
            The Vſes of both are
theſe.
            
               
                  Vſe 1 1 As peace with God
is deare to you, ſo to take
heed of turning unto folly.
Onely take this advertiſement,
that they are
not meere follies or ignorances
that doe interrupt
or breake the peace: as it
is not ſimply the outrage
of ſome Pirats that will
cauſe two States at peace
to enter into a warre, unleſſe
that State conſent to
their act, and maintaine
them in their rapine. So it

is not ſimply the riſing
of luſts that warre in our
members againſt the Law of
the minde, that breake the
peace betweene God and
us, unleſſe they be approved
of, and conſented unto,
nouriſhed and maintained
with ſome preſumption;
whilſt wee
maintaine, and take up
a conſtant fight againſt
Gods enemies in us, and
diſavow the outragious
riſings of our luſts, the
peace may hold and often
doth; for whilſt wee
are not at peace with ſin,
God may be at peace with
us and our Spirits; but ſo
much peace as wee give
them, ſo much warre God
takes up.
            
               
               
                  Vſe 2
The ſecond Vſe is: Doth
God take up quarrells againſt
His owne? then upon
any breach made, goe
forth to meet Him: It is
Saint Pauls exhortation,
not to let the Sunne goe
downe upon thy wrath, but
to reconcile thy ſelfe ere
night, with thy offended
brother; but I turne the
exhortation, Let not the
Sunne goe downe upon Gods
wrath towards thee; but
every day make and renew
thy peace with God,
ere thou ſleepeſt, that as
David ſayes, thou mayeſt
lie downe and ſleepe in peace,
Pſal. 4. 8.
            
               
                  Vſe 3 The third Vſe: If the
peace of Gods owne people
be thus often interrupted,

who yet are the
Sons of peace: Luk. 10. what
wrath is reſerved for the
children of diſobedience,
               Epheſ. 2. 2.
and open Rebells? that
are children of wrath, becauſe
of diſobedience. There
is no peace to the wicked,
ſayes my God, Eſa. 57. God
is a preparing againſt thee,
who ever thou art, that
goeſt on in ſinne, if thou
turne not, Pſal. 7. 13. thou
art preſt for hell, and art
thither bound, to encounter
with the wrath of the
great God, thither where
no truce is to bee had,
there is no diſcharge in that
warre, as Solomon ſayes,
Eccleſ. 8. 8. Think of this,
you that ſinne, and will
ſinne; whoſe peace is not

ſtruck up betweene God
and you, who never yet
ſo much as entred into any
treaty of peace with
God, who never apprehended
God and your
ſelves at oddes.
            
               
                  Obſer. 3 The third thing to be
obſerved out of the Text
is this; That when the Child
of God wants peace, he can
have no peace till God ſpeak
it; God muſt ſpeak peace,
if ever his people have it:
therefore ſayes hee here,
I will heare what God will
ſpeake: he ſpeaks in oppoſition
to the voice of man,
and the helpe of ſecond
cauſes, and of all meanes
whatever, which in time
of diſtreſſe, of themſelves
can doe no good.
            
               
               
                  Reaſ. 1
Reaſon firſt: Becauſe
God is the King of all the
world, the Soveraigne
Lord of all. Now treaties
of war and peace are the
prerogative of Kings, and
of them alone: they may
conſult with their ſubjects
about eſtabliſhing good
Lawes, as they uſe to doe,
&amp;c. but the proclaiming
Warre and Peace with
forreigne States, they
have ever held in their
owne hands; and ſo doth
God who is the King of
Kings.
            
               
                  Reaſ. 2 Secondly, becauſe God
is the Judge of all the
world and the party offended,
at whoſe ſuite all arreſts
and controverſies
doe come; now when a

condemned man ſtands at
the barre, let all the ſtanders
by ſay what they
will, bid him be of good
comfort, and tell him that
his cauſe will goe well, yet
till hee heare the Judge
himſelfe ſpeake as much,
he cannot be at reſt in his
minde: the Judge onely
can acquit him and abſolve
him The King alone
ſpeakes pardons; and ſo
doth God peace; all afflictions
are his arreſts; thou
muſt therefore make thy
peace with him, if thou
wilt be at peace.
            
               
                  Reaſ. 3 Thirdly, peace eſpecially
of conſcience, is a
thing muſt be created, for
our hearts of themſelves
are full of nothing but turmoile;

as the raging ſea,
which cannot reſt. I create
the fruit of the lips, peace.
Iſaiah 57. 19. men may
ſpeake it, but I muſt create
it; A word of power,
ſuch as went forth when
light was created, muſt
goe forth from God, or
elſe there is no peace;
for otherwiſe our hearts
are as the ſea, that reſts
not.
            
               
                  Reaſ. 4 Fourthly, the wounds
of conſcience which are
in Gods people, are of
that quality, that none but
God can cure them; for,
the chiefe thing that
wounds them, is the loſſe
of Gods favour, not ſimply
his wrath: for it is the
glory of God, and his favour,

not ſelfe-love onely
that makes them ſeeke
him; therefore nothing
gives peace, but the reſtoring
of his favour, and the
light of his countenance;
the ſame dart that wounded,
muſt heale againe;
Iſay 57. I ſmote him, and I
will heale him: And as one
that is ſick with love, whē
love is the diſeaſe, no phyſick,
no perſwaſion of
friends can cure it, nothing
but onely the love
of the party beloved; ſo
when a ſoule is wounded
for the loſſe of Gods love,
not all the things in the
world can cure the heart,
but one word from him,
one good looke, one promiſe
from him that wee

are his, ſtills all, and onely
can give peace. Like to a
poore child, that cryes for
its mother, let who will
dandle it, and play with it,
and uſe it never ſo kindly,
yet it will not be ſtilled
till the mother comes; ſo
it is with a poore ſoule
that cryes after God day
and night.
            
               
                  Vſe 1 1 Vſe. In caſe thou art
in diſtreſſe, eſpecially of
ſpirit, and want of peace
of Conſcience, waite upon
GOD, in the uſe of
meanes for peace; friends
may come to thee, and
ſay, Why ſhouldeſt thou
be troubled? thou haſt no
ſuch cauſe to bee caſt
downe; but all theſe are
miſerable comforters, (as

               Iob ſaid) unleſſe God ſpeak
peace: David heard by
the Prophet Nathan that
his ſinne was pardoned,
but yet his ſoule was not
at quiet, til God would ſecond
it immediately by
his Spirit; therefore ſayes
he, when Nathan had been
with him, Pſal. 51. 8. Make
me to heare of joy and gladneſſe.
Art thou baited with
helliſh blaſphemies caſt
into thy ſoule? God muſt
ſpeake peace, and rebuke
Satan for thee, and take
him off thee; all thy
friends, all the men in the
world cannot doe it; they
can only ſay as the Archangell
ſaid, The Lord rebuke
thee. And hee can as
eaſily doe it, as he did rebuke

               Laban, and forbade
him ſpeaking roughly to
Iacob, the ſame charge hee
can give in an inſtant to
Satan: therefore wait upon
God, and looke up to
him.
            
               
                  Vſe 2 2 Conſider this againſt
the time you come to die;
all your deſire is to die in
peace, and, Oh let thy ſervant
depart in peace! is the
ſpeech and deſire of all;
But who is it, that muſt
ſpeake peace to you then?
God onely. At death you
will ſend for a good Miniſter,
or a good friend,
to give you ſome comfort,
(as you call it) but, if God
will not ſpeake it, how
can they? if you could
call all the Angels out of

Heaven, and all the Saints
both in earth, and Heaven;
and ſo could have all
that whole Colledge of
Phyſicians about you, and
they, ſhould deſire to
comfort you with all their
cordialls; yet if God will
not ſpeake it, who is able
to doe it? Iob 34. 29. If he
hides his face, who can behold
him? None can ſhew his
face, as the oppoſition in
the next words ſhewes.
Falſe daubers may come
to you, &amp; ſay, Peace, peace,
as they in the Prophet
ſaid; but liſten what God
will ſpeak, he onely muſt,
and can doe it; and be ſure
you make ſure of him before
you come to die.
Would any wiſe Prince

deferr the treaty of peace
with his enemy, till hee
come into the field, and
when the battel is begun?
how fooliſh then are
thoſe, who neglect ſeeking
after God, till the aſſault
of death comes, and
the King of feares with all
his terrours, hath encompaſſed
them round?
            
               
                  Obſer. 4 4. Obſervation is, that
let Gods people be in never
ſo great diſtreſſe, yet
it is an eaſie thing for God to
give peace to them; mark
the expreſſion uſed here,
It is but ſpeaking peace, that
is, it is as eaſie for him to
give peace, as it is for you
to ſpeake a word; it is no
more to him: Then, our
comfort is, that as he onely

muſt doe it; ſo he eaſily
can doe it, even with
a word.
            
               
                  Reaſ. 1
               Reaſon 1. Becauſe his
ſpeaking is creating: if he
ſpeaks, he makes things to
be, even with a word; as
at firſt, he did but ſay, Let
there be light, and there was
light; ſo ſtill, if he but ſay,
Let there bee peace, there is
peace: hee made all, and upholds
all by the word of his
power. As therefore when
the ſtorme was at its
height, and the waves
moſt raging, yet at one
word of Chriſts, they were
all ſtill: The ſea and the
winds obey him: ſo, when
tentations are moſt fierce,
and the doubts of thine
owne heart moſt tumultuous,

and raging, a word
from him, can ſtill them.
            
               
                  Reaſ. 2 Secondly, becauſe the
light, which God gives to
a mans ſpirit, when hee
ſpeaks peace, is a ſure and
infallible light, and therefore
a ſatisfying light; ſo
as when it comes, it muſt
needs give peace; and no
objection, no tentation
can darken or obſcure it,
when it ſhines: If he give
quietneſſe, who can trouble?
ſayes he in Iob 34. 29. No
creature is able to ſeparate
from his love, or the
aſſurance of it.
            1 It is a certaine and infallible
light, which God
gives, when hee ſpeakes
peace; The anointing from
above, which enlighteneth

a mans eyes, is truth, and is
no lie, 1. Ioh. 2. 27. that is, in
teaching a man (of which
hee there ſpeakes, not
onely what hee is in himſelfe,
but what hee is in
teaching us) he doth it ſo,
as a man is not deluded
by it, and therefore it is
added, None elſe need teach
him; for did the ſpirit,
(whē he did ſpeak peace)
ſpeak ſo, as that that man
to whom it is ſpoken, did
not infallibly apprehend
it, hee ſhould ſpeake in
vaine: for ſo the Apoſtle
reaſons in caſe of unknown
tongues, that if a trumpet
give an uncertaine ſound;
or a man ſpeakes ſo, as it
ſhall not be knowne what
hee ſpeakes, hee beats the

aire: 1. Cor. 14. 9. Now
therefore ſurely God,
when hee ſpeakes peace,
ſpeakes it ſo infallibly,
and diſtinctly, that the
ſoule knows the meaning
of it; It is not a voice elſe;
for, ſayes the Apoſtle
there, ver. 10. The end of
all voices is to ſignifie, and
therefore if I know not the
meaning of the voice, hee
ſhall be as a Barbarian, that
ſpeakes to me: ver. 11. eſpecially
when the ſpeaker
undertakes to bee a witneſſe,
as the Holy Ghoſt in
ſpeaking peace is, 1. Iohn
5. 6. Now to witneſſe, is
ſuch a teſtimony, as is taken
for infallible, for the
end of it is to put an end
to the controverſie, and it

ends the ſtrife betweene
man and man; now the
Holy Ghoſt when hee
ſpeakes, ſpeakes as a witneſſe,
and therefore puts
an end to a mans doubts:
he ſpeakes infallibly.
            And therefore in the
ſecond place, it is a ſatiſfying
light alſo; it is ſuch
a light, as diſpells darkneſſe,
as anſwers all objections;
and ſo ſpeakes
peace home. As in a queſtion,
and Controverſie
in Divinity, or Logike,
when ſome one bottome
truth is underſtood, a man
hath a light, which goes
through all the Objections,
and anſwers them all;
ſuch a light doth the Spirit
give to a poore diſtreſſed

ſoule, about the
great controverſie of his
owne ſalvation, when hee
doth ſpeake peace; hee
gives ſuch a light, as ſatiſfies
the minde, as lets
him ſee that in Gods free
grace, and in Chriſt,
which doth anſwer to all,
hee, or all the devills can
ſay againſt him, from
what wants, or objections
are in himſelfe. Hee openeth,
and no man, nor devill,
is able to ſhut: And therefore
when he doth ſpeake
peace, his teſtimony is taken
and beleeved: If wee
receive the witneſſe of men,
and reſt in it: 1. Iohn 5. 9.
The witneſſe of God is greater,
that is, of more power,
and efficacie to perſwade,

and ſatisfie the
ſoule.
            
               
                  Vſe 1 1. Vſe, is an Uſe of
comfort to poore ſoules,
that are in diſtreſſe, and
in ſuch diſtreſſe ſometimes,
as they thinke, and
ſay their caſe is deſperate,
and paſt recovery, ſo farre
are their ſoules ſometimes
ſhot into deſpaire. Conſider,
how eaſie it is for
you to have your condition
altered, and changed,
even in a moment. I tell
thee, though (it may be)
thou haſt been caſt down
this twenty yeeres, and
thy ſoule is battered, broken,
hardened, ſetled, fixed
in ſerious thoughts of
thy ruine, and reprobation,
yet one good looke,

one good word from God
ſhall in an inſtant diſpell
all, alter thy conceit and
apprehenſion cleane; God
can and doth often more
with one word, in one
moment, then Satan could
doe in many yeeres, with
all the objections he could
muſter up. The truth of
this, in experience wee
often finde and obſerve in
our ſelves and others. Yea,
and ſometimes when hee
doth ſpeake peace, hee
gives ſuch ſatisfaction to
a mans ſoule in that particular,
that hee would bee
content to bee as many
yeeres more, in his ſpirituall
conflicts, to enjoy
but the like light, one
halfe houre. Thus eaſie

is it, for God to ſpeake
peace. Though thou thinkeſt
thy ſelfe never ſo far
off from peace, yet he can
ſpeake peace to them, that
are afarre off, as well as
thoſe who are neere: as himſelfe
ſayes, Eſay 57. 19.
for, ſayes hee, it is I that
ſpeake it. And when hee
doth it, then all thy doubts
and diſtreſſes, will bee forgotten,
as the paines of
a woman in travaile are
when a man-childe is
borne.
            
               
                  Vſe 2 Secondly, is the Church
in any diſtreſſe? (as the
Church here at this time
was,) hee can redeeme it
out of all with a word. A
word ſpoken to Cyrus his
heart, did ſet them in

their owne land againe,
ſo you have it expreſſed,
Eſay 44. 26, 27, 28. The
God that ſaith to Ieruſalem,
thou ſhalt bee inhabited, and
to the Cities of Iudah, yee
ſhall bee built; you ſee his
maner of doing it, it is but
with a word ſpeaking; he
ſayes to Ieruſale, be built; and
though there be neuer ſo
great impediments in the
way, he will ſay to the deep,
bee dry, that his people
may paſſe over; hee dryed
up a whole Nation, a
ſea of people, namely the
Babylonians, to make way
for this deliverance. And
when they are conquered,
and Cyrus, a new King
comes to have the ſway
of things, God ſpeakes to

his heart alſo; That ſaith
of Cyrus, he is my ſhepheard,
and cauſeth him to ſay to
Jeruſalem, Be thou built.
Therefore goe to him,
and truſt in him in all the
diſtreſſes of the Church,
as the Church alſo did,
Pſal. 44. 4. Thou art my
king, command deliverances;
A Mandamus from God
doth it, and will doe it at
any time.
            
               
                  Obſer. 5 Let God bee never ſo
angry, and his peoples
diſtreſſe never ſo great,
yet he will ſpeak peace in the
end to his people: you
heard before, that if wee
have peace, he onely muſt
give it; and then, that hee
could, and was able with
eaſe to doe it: and now

you ſhall heare, that hee
will certainly doe it in
the end.
            The Reaſons the Text
ſuggeſts are theſe:
            
               
                  Reaſ. 1 1. If wee conſider but,
who this God is, that is
to ſpeake peace, I will
heare what God the Lord
will ſpeake; he is the Lord,
and therfore able to ſpeak
what pleaſeth him; he is
peculiarly the God of peace,
and therefore willing to
ſpeake peace. Now, 1.
when it is ſaid, hee is the
God of peace, and the God of
comfort, the meaning is,
hee is full of it, infinitely
full of it, and out of the
abundance of the heart, the
mouth ſpeakes; thoughts of
peace, and love to his,

doe boile within him, as
hatred, or malice doth in
a malicious man towards
his enemy; ſo as hee cannot
containe and forbeare
expreſſing it towards him;
that as David ſayes, his
thoughts did burne within
him, and at laſt, brake forth;
ſo in God, I know the
thoughts I thinke towards
you (ſaies hee to them of
the captivity) Ier. 29. 11.
They are thoughts of peace,
and not of evill. And 2.
beſides that theſe his
thoughts of peace are taken
up of himſelfe, his
Son alſo hath beſpoken
peace for us; and therefore
God will ſpeake it,
Even as Ioſeph, though he
ſpake roughly a while to

his brethren, yet could
not in the end containe,
Gen. 45. 1. ſo nor God.
            
               
                  Reaſ. 2 Secondly, Let us conſider,
who they are to
whom hee is to ſpeake it,
they are his people, as the
text hath it; and to them
there is no queſtion, but
hee will ſpeake peace;
though hee ſeemes angry
for a while. They are his
people, that is the reaſon
given, 1. Sam. 12. 22. Hee
will not caſt off his people:
as alſo Eaſy 63. 8, 9. When
they rebelled, he was wroth,
yet hee ſaid, ſurely, they are
my people, ſo I was their Saviour.
They? why they
are the ſonnes of peace,
Luke 10. 6. ordained for
peace, and therefore ſhall

be ſure to have it; and although
ſome differences
may ariſe betwixt God
and them, yet there is a
naturall 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                in the Lord,
that moves him to ſpeake
peace in the end to them:
as the dumbe ſonne of
Craeſus, when hee ſaw his
father like to bee killed,
though hee had never
ſpake before, yet then out
of an impetus of ſpirit, the
ſtrings of his tongue were
unlooſed, and hee cried
out to the murtherer, Kill
not King Craeſus; ſo, when
the enemies of his Church
are ready to devoure his
people, and Satan is ready
to ſwallow his child up
in deſpaire, then Gods
bowells worke within

him, and hee can hold no
longer, but cries, ſave my
child, ſave my Church. Is
Ephraim my pleaſant child,
(ſayes God) Ier. 31. 20?
Well ſayes God, though I
ſpake againſt him, and took
him up, and chid him
ſoundly, yet I cannot forget
my child ſayes he, nor
my Fatherly affection to
him, but my bowels are ſtirred,
and I will ſurely have
mercy on him.
            
            
               
                  Reaſ. 3 Thirdly, otherwiſe if
God did not in the end
ſpeake peace, they would
indeed returne to follie,
which is the third thing
in the text. For his end of
ſpeaking peace, is that
they might not returne to
folly, Pſal. 125. 3. The rod

of the wicked ſhall not alwayes
lie upon the righteous,
leaſt they put forth their
hand to iniquity, Therefore
at the laſt verſe, Peace ſhall
be upon Iſrael. As for this
cauſe he ſpeakes outward
peace, ſo alſo inward, and
ſuffers not the rod of Satan,
and of his owne heavie
diſpleaſure to lie upon
their hearts: for elſe
they would returne to
the pleaſures of ſinne; for
every creature muſt have
ſome delight; their ſpirits
would faile, and be tired
out elſe, and wearied
in good duties, if GOD
ſhould not in the end
ſpeake peace, Eſay 57.
The ſpirit would faile before
me. When the childe

ſwounds in the whipping,
God lets fall the rod, and
falls a kiſſing it, to fetch
life into it againe. As tis a
rule in Phyſicke, ſtill to
maintaine nature: and
therefore when that ſhall
bee in hazzard to bee deſtroyed,
they leave giving
purging Phyſicke, and
give cordials: ſo doth
GOD with his people,
though with purging
phyſicke, he often brings
their ſpirits very weake,
and low, yet hee will uphold
and maintaine their
ſpirits, ſo as they ſhall not
faile, and bee extinguiſht,
but then he will give cordials
to raiſe them up
againe.
            
               Vſe 3. What good heart

that beares a child-like affection
to God, would offend
ſuch a God, that bee
thy diſtreſſes what they
will bee, will certainely
ſpeake peace: then doe
not put him to it, ſpend
not upon that precious
ſtock of his free grace and
love. Tis true, he is maried
to thee, and therefore
though thou haſt gone a whoring
after many lovers, Ier.
3. 1, 2, 14. ſtill hee ſayes,
Returne, for I am maried to
thee: as therefore when
man and wife are fallen
out, they conſider, wee
muſt live together, and
therefore they reconcile
themſelves againe: ſo
conſider it muſt bee betweene
God and thee, and

make it a meanes and motive
to recover thee, as
Samuel did to the Iſraelites:
1. Sam. 12. 22. You
have committed this great
ſinne, yet turn not aſide from
following the Lord, for God
will not caſt you off, you are
his people. Goe home to
him againe, he will ſpeak
peace. Thinke thus, the
time will come wherein
God will be friends again
with me, he and I cannot
be ſtrange long; though
I would, he will not, Eſay
57. 18, 19. though he went
on ſtubbornly, yet God
healed him, and would
not loſe his childe, therefore
I will returne of my
ſelfe.
         
         
            
            
            THE
FOLLY OF
RELAPSING
after Peace ſpoken.
            
               Pſal. 85. ver. 8.
               — But let them turne no
more to folly.
            
            
               
                  Obſer. 6
               
                  THE ſixth Obſervation
is, That
Peace being ſpoken
to their hearts by GOD,
they ſhould returne no more
to folly. See this Ezra 9. 13,
14. Thou having puniſht
us leſſe then wee deſerve,

and given us ſuch a deliverance
as this, ſhould wee
againe breake thy Commandements,
wouldſt thou not be
angry with us till thou hadſt
conſumed us?
            
               
                  Reaſ. 1 1 Reaſon: Becauſe it
will be a greater aggravation
in ſinning; It is made
the aggravation of Solomons
ſinne, 1 Kings 11. 9.
That God had appeared to
him twice: they were eſpeciall
appearances and
manifeſtations of mercy;
and though ſuch doe now
ceaſe, yet wee reade of
ſuch as are analogicall to
them, as Iohn 14. 21.
Chriſt promiſeth to manifeſt
himſelfe, which is
by ſhedding abroad his
love, and his Fathers love

into the heart, which is evident
by the former
words, he ſhall be loved of
my Father, and I will love
him, and after he ſaith, wee
will come to him, and make
our abode with him, ver. 23.
and 27. My peace I will give
unto you. Now ſuch appearances
will be ſet upon the
ſcore of every ſin, many
yeares after, as they were
upon Solomons. And the
reaſon is, becauſe nothing
wounds an ingenuous loving
Nature more, then
matter of unkindneſſe:
if it had beene my enemy
ſayes David, I could have
borne it, Pſal. 55. 12, 14.
but it was thou ôh man, mine
acquaintance, we tooke ſweet
counſell together, a boſome

friend to whom I had
committed my ſecrets, opened
my heart: Thus
when God hath unboſomed
himſelfe as it were
to a man, and told him
what was in his heart towards
him, this goes nigh
him, if hee lifts up the
heele againſt him. And
the reaſon of that further
alſo is, 1 becauſe of all
things elſe, a man cannot
endure to have his love
abuſed, you come nigh
him when you doe ſo, for
his love is himſelfe, and
commands all in him, ſo
that abuſe his love, and
you ſtrike at his heart; it
is leſſe to abuſe any excellency
in a man, to reproach
and extenuate his

parts, learning, &amp;c. though
theſe are deare to him,
but his love is his bowels.
And therefore, when God
hath opened his heart to
a man, and ſet his love upon
him, and revealed it to
him, and hee carries himſelfe
unworthily, it paines
him at the heart. Beſides,
2. it is againſt the law of
Nature and of Nations,
to ſeeke out for a peace,
and get it concluded, and
then ſecretly to prepare
for, and enter into a war;
nothing more hatefull, or
can exaſperate two Nations
one againſt another
more then this. It was
the aggravation of Abſaloms
ſin, that being newly
reconciled with his father,

and taken into favour againe,
after two yeeres
diſcountenance, hee then
began to rebell more
cloſely.
            
               
                  Reaſ. 2 2 Reaſon is intimated
in the word folly, as if the
Lord ſhould have ſaid, Set
aſide the unkindneſſe and
wrong you doe to me, yet
therein you befoole your
ſelves; you will have the
worſt of it. And indeed,
when God doth afterwards
draw nigh to a man
againe, upon that his recovery
of his peace, it appeares
to be folly, even in
that mans owne apprehenſion;
when hee hath
taſted how ſweet God is,
then come and aſke him,
What, will ye returne to

ſin againe? hee will then
ſay, Aſke mee if I will
wound or cut my fleſh:
It is impoſſible, thinkes
he, I ſhould any more be
ſo beſotted; if there were
no other motives, hee
thinkes it the greateſt folly
in the world. And therefore
GOD on purpoſe
chooſeth out that expreſſion,
and placeth it
here in this caſe, becauſe
it is indeed the greateſt
folly in Gods ſight; and
is ſo apprehended by our
ſelves, looking upon ſinne
after peace is ſpoken to
us. It is folly to ſin againſt
GOD at any time, but
eſpecially then, and that
will appeare by theſe particulars.
            
               
1. Becauſe, before a
man had that peace, hee
felt the bitterneſſe of ſin,
for GOD never ſpeakes
peace, till that bee felt:
now that is an argument
even to ſenſe, never to returne
to it againe; which
a foole will be warned by;
A burnt Child dreads the
fire; even as a Child will
take heed being taught by
ſenſe. When a man ſhall
be in great diſtreſſe, and
his Conſcience ſhall ſuggeſt
to him, as Ier. 4. 18.
Thy wayes and thy doings
have procured theſe things
to thee, this is thy wickednes:
a ſpeech like that when
you ſay to your Children,
when they have gotten any
harme or cold, or ſickneſſe,

this is your playing
and gadding and going in
the Snow, and your eating
of fruit, &amp;c. ſo doth
GOD ſpeake there, to
them when they were in
diſtreſſe, this is your wickedneſſe,
for it is bitter, it
reacheth to the heart, it
woundeth the Conſcience,
the wounding of
which, of all elſe is the
greateſt miſery. When
once a man after this hath
peace reſtored to him, and
hee comes newly out of
ſuch a diſtreſſe, aſke him
then how he likes turning
to ſuch a ſin againe, and he
will tell you, it is the greateſt
folly in the world:
aske David if hee will
murther any more after

his bones have been broken,
and ſet againe.
            2 Thou wilt eaſily acknowledge,
it is folly to
return to ſin again, if thou
conſidereſt the terms, upon
which thou didſt obtaine
thy peace. Reckon
what paines it coſt thee,
to waſh out the guilt and
ſtaine, which ſinne had
made, what vows and reſolutions
thou madeſt,
what bonds thou didſt
ſeale unto, what promiſes
never to returne, what
prayers and teares, what
rappes and knocks at Heaven
Gates, ere thou couldeſt
get an anſwer, or
God to ſpeake one word,
he making as if hee had
not beene within: why is

it not folly now to loſe
that in an inſtant, thou
haſt beene a getting ſo
long, haply many yeares,
and with ſo much paines
and coſt? You uſe it as an
excuſe to prodigalls to
ſay, things lightly come
by, are lightly gone; and
yet you count them, and
call them fooles for it, as
not knowing what it is to
earne a penny: how much
more folly is it, when a
man having afore morgaged
his peace, and God reſtored
it again after much
ſuite, and waiting many a
term, then to come home,
and venture to caſt all away
at one throw at dice?
ſuch a fool art thou, when
thou returneſt to ſinne; to

drink that at one draught,
which thou haſt been getting
many a yeare, what
madneſſe is it? when thou
haſt taken much paines,
to waſh thy ſelfe, then to
wallow in the mire again,
and make thy ſelfe new
worke, what folly is it?
who but Children and
fooles will doe thus?
That which the Church
ſaid in another caſe, may
well be alluded to in this,
Cant. 5. 31. I have waſhed
my feet, how ſhall I defile
them?
            
            3 Conſider, what it is
thou doſt hazard, to loſe
by returning to folly: thy
peace. David loſt it, as appeares,
Pſal. 51. 12. therefore
ſayes he, reſtore to me

the joy of thy ſalvation; In
loſing of which, thou wilt
be ſo much a loſer, that if
the ſinne thou chooſeſt▪
were able to give thee all
the world, it could not recompence
thee; no not
the loſſe of one houres
communion with God,
which in a moment will
bring thee in more ſweetneſſe,
than all thy ſins can
doe, to eternity. If all the
pleaſures of ſin were contracted,
and the quinteſſence
of them ſtrained into
one cup, they would
not afford ſo much, as one
drop of true peace with
God doth, being let fall
into the heart. It is peace
which paſſeth underſtanding.
Few pleaſures here do

exceed the ſenſes, nay, the
ſenſes are capable of more
than the things can give;
but this paſſeth underſtanding.
Gods loving kindneſſe
is better than life. If it
were propounded to thee,
thou muſt loſe thy life
next moment, if thou
ſhouldſt commit ſuch a
ſinne, wouldeſt thou venture,
if thou didſt beleeve
it? Now The loving kindneſſe
of God is better than
life, and wilt thou loſe the
enjoying of it, though but
for a moment?
            4. It is folly to returne
againe, becauſe the pleaſures
of ſin will be much
leſſe to thee after thou
haſt had peace ſpoken.
Take them at the beſt,

when they are freſheſt,
and when thy palate was
moſt in reliſh, and taſte
with them, when thou
wert carnall, and ere thou
kneweſt what ſweetneſſe
was in God, and they then
were but poor ſorry pleaſures:
but now, they will
prove farre more empty
than before; they are
empty vaine pleaſures even
to him that hath thē
in their flower, and in his
ſeaſon of ſinning; and
therefore all wicked men
are weary, and do inwardly
complain of their condition,
onely they cannot
finde ſweetneſſe in God,
and ſo are faine to keepe
themſelves to their huſks;
but alas, to thee they are

farre leſſe worth than to
another man, who knows
not God, and therefore
thou art like to have a
worſe bargaine of it; another
man can make more
money of a ſinne, and
get more pleaſure out of
it, than thou art able to
doe.
            For firſt, thy conſcience
having beene ſcorched
with ſinne, as ſcalt fleſh
deares more, and is more
ſenſible in comming to
the fire, than other parts
of the body, is become of
a quicker ſenſe; whereas
wicked mens is ſeared,
and ſo they commit all
uncleanneſſe with greedineſſe:
but thine is tender
&amp; galled in the act, which

allayes much of the pleaſure
of thy ſinne, and mingleth
the more bitterneſſe
with it.
            And 2. beſides this galling
of conſcience, which
is common to thee with
many an unregenerate
man, thou haſt a principle
of grace, an inner man,
which is dead to ſuch,
pleaſures, that taſts them
not, that is like Barzillai,
who through age 2 Sam.
19. 35. could not taſte either
what he ate or drank,
as young men doe; no
more can that New man in
thee, and therefore it can
be but halfe as pleaſant to
thee as to another man. If
one ſide of a man be taken
all with a numbe palſey,

what pleaſure is it to that
man, to exerciſe his limbs
in the actions of life? He
is but halfe a man, and
lives but halfe a life; ſo it
is with thee, when thou
haſt grace in thy heart,
but halfe thy heart can
take pleaſure in ſinning,
that new man the other
halfe, reluctates, grieves
for it, hates what thou doeſt;
and all this muſt needs
ſtrike off much of the
pleaſure.
            But 3. If wee adde to
this, that this new man in
him having once taſted
what ſweetnes is in God,
and How good the Lord is,
is then like a man that
hath eaten ſweet-meats,
other things are out of

taſte with him, and therefore
alſo it is folly to returne.
No man (ſayes
Chriſt, Luke 5 ult.) having
dranke old wine deſireth
new, for hee ſaith the old is
better; a manuſed to high
fare cannot agree ſo well
with thinne dyet: ſo the
ſoule having beene uſed
to taſte of great pleaſures
in God, the impreſſion &amp;
remembrance of them
leaves his ſoule leſſe ſatisfied
than another mans; a
ſtomack that hath beene
enlarged to full diet, looks
for it, and riſeth more
hungry from a ſlender
meale: now communion
with God inlarges the faculties,
and widens them
and makes them more capable

of greater joyes,
than other men have, and
therefore the creature is
leſſe able to fill them; ſtill
he remembers with much
griefe, whileſt he is eating
his huſkes, what fare hee
had in his fathers houſe:
and oh, Then it was better
with me, than now. Call me
not Naomi, but call mee
Marah, as ſhe ſaid, For I
went out full, and am come
home empty; ſo doth hee
ſay, when he comes from
the act of ſinning, he went
with his heart full of
peace, and meeting with
a bargaine of ſinning,
thought to eke out his
joy, and make it fuller,
but hee comes home
empty.
            
               
               
                  Vſe 1
1 Uſe, is to thoſe who
have had peace ſpoken to
them, let them at ſuch
times feare themſelves
and God moſt, for then
comes in this, as you ſee
here, as the moſt ſeaſonable
admonition that can
be given, to returne no
more to folly. 1. Feare
God then moſt: for of all
times elſe, then ſins provoke
him moſt; to come
and call him Father, and
the guide of your mouth, and
yet to fall to ſinne, this is
to doe as evill as you can,
you cannot doe worſe.
Ier. 3 4, 5. So Ezra 9. After
ſuch an eſcaping, ſhould we
againe breake thy Commandements,
wouldeſt thou not
be angry till thou hadſt conſumed

us? In times of affliction
it is the property
of a good childe to love
GOD moſt: in times of
ſpeaking peace, to feare
God moſt and his goodneſſe,
and to fear to offend him
for his goodneſſe ſake.
Did I onely ſay, that God
is provoked moſt then, if
you return to folly? Nay,
I adde further, he is grieved,
which is more then
to be provoked; and therfore
you ſhall marke that
expreſſion and admonition
not to grive Gods Spirit,
then comes in, when
the Spirit hath ſealed us
up to the day of redemption,
Epheſ. 4. 30. Then by ſinning
wee are ſaid more
properly to grieve him

then before, when hee
hath ſo far ingaged himſelfe
to love a man, and
expreſſed himſelf to him,
and ſet his ſeale upon him
for his. God is angry with
wicked mens ſins, but hee
is grieved for yours. To
grieve him is more then
to anger him. Meere anger
is an affection can eaſe
it ſelfe by revenge, and
by comming even againe
with the party, and when
wee can or intend to doe
ſo, our mindes are not ſo
much aggrieved, but
pleaſe themſelves rather
to thinke of the revenge
which wee meane to execute:
ſo when wicked
men ſinne whom GOD
meanes to meet with, hee

is ſaid to be angry rather
then grieved; and ſayes,
I will eaſe my ſelfe of mine
adverſaries: Iſay 1. 24. and
avenge my ſelfe of mine
enemies. But here, as when
a mans wife that lies in his
boſome, or his child ſhall
wrong him: ſo is it when
one ſins, whom God hath
ſet himſelfe to love, and
done much for, and made
knowne his everlaſting
kindneſſe unto, and ſealed
to the day of redemption:
this goes to his
heart, grieves him rather
then angers him, and ſuch
are the trueſt and deepeſt
griefes. What ſhould hee
doe with you in this caſe?
if afflict you, and by that
meanes goe about to

turne you from your iniquity,
therein he ſhall but
afflict himſelfe as it were;
for Though they rebelled,
yet when they were afflicted
hee was afflicted, Eſay 63. 9,
10. As when a Father that
is a Magiſtrate, or as one
that maintaines a Student
in a Colledge, if either
puniſheth a childe, or pupill
in his purſe, he puniſheth
himſelfe, ſo muſt
God afflict himſelfe to afflict
you. Put not the
Lord into theſe ſtraits if
you have any love in you.
And 2. as thou art therefore
to feare God moſt
then, ſo thy ſelfe moſt,
and to be more watchfull
over thy own heart; thou
art then apt to returne to

folly, if thou takeſt not
heed; as when a man hath
beene very hot, or ſweat
much, hee is apt to take
the greateſt cold. Hezekiah,
after GOD ſealed
peace to him and anſwered
his prayers, and renewed
the leaſe of his life, his
heart got cold, he did returne
to folly. The reaſon
is, becauſe then the heart
is apt to grow leſſe watchfull,
and to thinke it ſelfe
fortified enough againſt
any tentation. As S. Peter
having ſeene Chriſt tranſfigured
in the Mount,
grew confident in his own
ſtrength. And know that
the Devill watcheth ſuch
an opportunity moſt, for
hee gets a great victory if

he can foile thee then, after
hee hath beene foiled
himſelfe, and when thou
art moſt triumphing over
him; how many battels
have beene loſt through
ſecurity of victory and
recoyling of the enemy?
and beſides our corrupt
nature ſo farre as unrenewed,
is apt to gather
heart to it ſelfe, to ſlight
ſinne, as thinking its pardon
eaſily gotten.
            Therefore when thou
art tempted, labour often
to renew thoſe thoughts,
which thou hadſt of thy
ſinne at that time, when
thou wert ſuing for peace,
before thy peace was gotten;
when thou wouldeſt
have given a world for

Gods favour; &amp; alſo what
thoughts thou hadſt of it,
when God ſpake peace,
how thou didſt abhorr it,
yea, thy ſelf, &amp; look what
ſin was moſt bitter to thee
&amp; an enemy to thy peace;
as if uncleanneſſe, Idlenes,
neglect of prayer, ill company,
&amp;c. and preſerve in
thy heart thoſe bitter apprehenſions
of it, &amp; ſay of
it, thou haſt bin a bloody ſin
to me, as Moſes wife ſaid of
her huſband: and though I
have got peace, &amp; my life
ſaved, yet it was a bloody
ſin to Chriſt, his blood was
ſhed to purchaſe this my
peace, &amp; ſhal I return to it?
            And when tempted to it
again, have recourſe to the
kindnes God ſhewed thee

in pardoning, and ſay, how
ſhall I do this, and ſinne againſt
God? ſay as he ſaid,
Is this thy kindneſſe to thy
friend? 2. Sam. 16. 16. and
what, ſhall I Abſalom-like,
now I am new reconciled
to my Father, fall a plotting
treaſon again? what,
ſhall I make more worke
for prayer, more worke for
God, breake my bones again,
&amp; lie roaring again?
Think thus, I was burnt in
the hād afore, I ſhal be racked
ſurely now. Sin no more
leſt a worſe thing befall thee.
            
            
               Vſe 3. The doctrine of
aſſurance (if not abuſed)
and of Gods ſpeaking
peace to men is no dangerous
doctrin to make men
ſecure and preſumptuous

in ſinning: when peace is
preached in any mans
heart, this uſe naturally
flowes from that Doctrin,
returne no more to folly. The
very ſcope of the whole
Epiſtle of S Iohn is to help
all beleevers to aſſurance,
as appeares by the 1. Iohn
1. 4, 5. and the 5. Chap. 13.
Theſe things I write to you,
that yee might have communion
with God, and that
your joy might be full. But
this will open a way to all
licentiouſneſſe. No ſayes
S. Iohn, Chap. 2. 1. Theſe
things I write unto you that
ye ſin not; nothing guards
the heart more againſt
tentations, then the peace
of God: it is ſaid to guard
the heart, Phil. 4. 2. Yea

and if you doe ſin, the aſſurance
of Gods love is
the ſpeedieſt way to recover
you; ſo it followes:
If any one doth ſinne, wee
have an Advocate with the
Father, &amp;c. And hee that
hath this hope in him, that
is, to live with Chriſt, and
knowes what manner of love
the Father beares us, purifies
himſelfe as hee is pure,
1. Iohn 3. 1, 2, 3. If there
were no more but ſelfe-love
in a man, it were
then no wonder if he doth
abuſe it. For ſelfe-love,
where the love of God is
wanting, is unthankfull
and ungratefull, willing
to take all the love and
kindneſſe which is afforded,
and abuſe it, and work

upon it for its owne advantage;
and it is true alſo
that becauſe wee have
too much of this principle
unmortified in us, therefore
God truſteth ſo few
with much aſſurance, becauſe
they would abuſe it.
But where true love to
God is ſeated, and much
of it implanted, there the
love of God &amp; the peace
of God doth as kindly and
naturally enkindle and
enflame and ſet it awork,
even as arguments ſutable
to ſelf-love doe work
upon, and ſtirre that principle.
For grace is more
for GOD then for our
ſelves, it being the image
of Gods holineſſe, whoſe
holineſſe conſiſts in this,

to aime at himſelfe in all:
and therefore when Gods
free grace towards a man
is revealed, it raiſeth him
up to higher ſtraines of
love to God, and hatred
of ſin. And therefore it is
obſervable, Pſa. 51. 12. that
David when he prayes for
the reſtoring of the joy of his
ſalvation, hee prayes not
ſimply for it, or alone, but
withall prayes for a free
ſpirit, Eſtabliſh me with thy
free ſpirit: that is a ſpirit
of ingenuity, which is
kindly, ſweetly and freely
wrought upon: therefore
when we have a free
ſpirit wrought in us,
then that free love that is
in God towards us will
worke moſt kindly upon

it, and conſtraines us to
love him that loved us firſt.
The love of Chriſt conſtrains
us, 2. Cor. 5. 14. Becauſe we
thus judge, that if Chriſt
died for all, then they which
live ſhould not live unto thē
                  ſelves
but unto him that died
for them: S. Paul gives
the reaſon, why this love
of Chriſt did thus conſtraine
him, becauſe hee
did thus judge, that is, this
conſideration of Chriſts
love, hee having a principle
of love in his heart to
Chriſt, hee found to be a
powerfull prevailing reaſon
to perſwade him to
live to Chriſt. Having a
new judgement hee ſaw
force and ſtrength in the
argument. And ſo ſhall

we if we thus judge, and
it will have this naturall
conſequence as naturally
to follow upon it in our
hearts, as any reaſon in
any other kinde hath, that
is brought to enforce any
other concluſion. And
therefore as the minde is
conſtrained (as it were) to
aſſent to a truth proved
by force of reaſon, that if
you grant this, then this
or that will follow: ſo
becauſe we judge this reaſonable
by an argument
drawne out of loves Topicks,
that if Chriſt died
for all, who otherwiſe muſt
themſelues have died, that
then they ſhould live to him,
this will conſtraine us to
love him, and live to him.

               Amor Dei eſt extaticus, nec
ſe ſinit eſſe ſui luris.
            
            THis Text and admonition
here gives a
uſt occaſion to conſider
a little of that ſo often
queſtioned caſe of Conſcience
concerning relapſes
of Gods Children into
the ſame ſinnes and folly
againe,The caſe of relapſing into the ſame ſinne after peace ſpoken, reſolved. and whether after
peace ſpoken, Gods people
may returne againe to
folly. Some have held,
that a man after a ſecond
repentance could not fall
into the ſame ſinne again:
others if he did, it excluded
him from mercy for
time to come. For the

comfort of ſome poore
ſoules whoſe caſe and tentation
this may be, I will
ſpeake ſomewhat though
ſparingly and with caution.
            1. The Scripture no
where excludeth thoſe
from the ſtate of grace, or
barrs mercy from thoſe,
that have relapſed into
the ſame ſinne, eſpecially
ſo long as in regard of the
manner of their ſinning it
be but folly, not wickedneſſe
or wilfull ſinning,
that is, rather proceeding
out of errour of underſtanding,
and heat, and
impetuouſneſſe of fooliſh
affections, then obſtinacie
and malice in the will,
and with deſpite of the Spirit

of grace, Heb. 10. 27.
            Yea: 2. In Scripture
wee meet with ſuch paſſages
and promiſes, as
may undoubtedly uphold
any ſoule, that hath ſo
fallen after peace received,
into the ſame ſinne,
and preſerve him from apprehending
himſelfe excluded
therefore from
mercy and the ſtate of
grace: As Hoſea 14. 4. I will
heale their backſlidings, I
will love them freely; unleſſe
they had fallen after
repenting &amp; former healing,
it could not have
been called backſliding,
and yet this hee promiſes
to heale, &amp; withall ſhewes
the ground that mooved
him to it, his loving them

freely: for if in any thing
his free love is ſhewne to
any of his children and
drawne out, it is in healing
againe ſuch a backſliding
ſoule after recovery
and peace given. For
the falling into the ſame
ſinne, which hath been repented
of and healed, provokes
God more then a
thouſand other acts of
ſinnes formerly committed
though of the ſame
kind. And therein alſo to
ſhew his free love, that he
can pardon even the abuſe
of love it ſelfe, he leaves
ſome thus to ſinne after
his love ſhed abroad in
their hearts. Some hee
ſhewes his free love unto,
in keeping them from

               ſinning, others in pardoning
them, and giving them
repentance: they are but
ſeverall wayes of drawing
it forth; ſo that if in any
thing, herein his free-love
is ſhewne, for if it were
not free, it would never
endure it ſelfe to bee abuſed.
And likewiſe the ſure
mercies of David are then
ſhowne, when God multiplies
to pardon: ſo Eſay 55.
3. having mentioned the
promiſe of the ſure mercies
of David, He promiſes
to multiply to pardon, as
it is in the Originall verſe
7: which are thus joined,
both becauſe the ſureneſſe
of his Covenant, is therein
ſhewne, and becauſe
wee might haply multiply

to ſinne; and at leaſt it
ſuppoſeth the poſſibility
of it againe. God likewiſe
runs upon ſuch a ſuppoſition
in that expreſſion of
his, to his owne people,
Iere. 3. 1, 2. They ſay if a
man put away his wife, and
ſhee becomes another mans,
ſhall not the Land be greatly
polluted? but thou haſt played
the harlot with many lovers,
yet returne againe to
me, ſaith the Lord. Hee
ſpeakes to her as to one,
had been his Wife, who
though ſhee had not been
put away by him, but had
put away her ſelfe and
run away, not once but
often, and that with many
lovers, and ſometimes
in the midſt of her whoredomes,

had come in and
made challenge of his
former love and pleaded
his former mercy to her,
and yet fallen back againe
verſe 4. 5. (where he adds,
Wilt thou not from this time
cry, My Father, and thou art
the guide of my youth, that
is, I know ſayes God, you
will come now and cry as
heretofore you have done
and ſay, Oh thou art my
Father and my Huſband,
and confidently ſtill claim
an intereſt in me upon my
former kindneſſe, and yet
doe as evill as you can, for
you cannot doe worſe
then thus to abuſe my
love) yet for all this at the
12. verſe, Returne thou backſliding
Iſrael, ſaith the

Lord, for I am married to
you, verſe 14. That which
hee doth thus to a nation,
hee may doe to a particular
man who is his
child.
            Againe, 3. There are
not altogether examples
wanting for this.
            
               
                  Examp. 1 1. Wee finde Sampſon
a godly man (whom yet
wee would ſcarce have
thought ſuch but that we
find his name in the liſt of
thoſe Worthies, Heb. 11.)
enſnared with a Philiſtine
woman againſt the counſel
of his parents, Iudg. 14.
3. who clearely laid open
his ſinne to him, and hee
was in the event reprooved
for his folly, for his
wife deceived him, told

his riddle to his enemies
which hee in the end perceived,
and further to reproove
him, in the iſſue
ſhee was given away to
another, verſe 16, 17, 20
from all which paſſages of
reproofe, an holy man
that had his eyes in his
head, could not but ſee
his errour; and yet againe
a long while after this,
(twenty yeres after, Iudg.
15. 20. (when certainely
ere that hee had repented
of this his ſinne, for which
his parents before, and after,
God ſo clearely did
rebuke him,) hee went to
Gaza, Iudg. 16. verſe 1. and
ſaw a harlot and went into
her, and there ſcaped narrowly
with his life at midnight,

And verſe 4. After
that alſo it came to paſſe
hee fell in love with another,
as bad as any of the
former, Dalilah, who was
his ruine. But his returning
thus to folly coſt
him deare, for in the end
he was taken as a Captive
to the Philiſtims his enemies,
&amp; that through her
falſe-hood, deprived of
his ſtrength he had ſpent
upon theſe women, had
his eyes thoſe betraying
lights put out, that had
enſnared him, and himſelfe
made a foole of, to
make his enemies ſport.
So as no child of God can
take any great encouragement
thus to returne to
folly, for the future, by

his example, though comfort
they may have therefrom
in caſe they have
returned for the time
paſt.
            2. Another example
may be that of Ieboſhaphat
who commited a great
ſinne in joyning with
Ahab that wicked King
that ſold himſelfe to worke
wickedneſſe, 2. Chron. 18. 1,
2, 3. and hee was foretold
what would bee the ſucceſſe
of that confederacy
and journey by Michaiah
before he went with him
to battell, and after in the
battell it ſelfe, where hee
hardly eſcaped with his
life, and by an extraordinary
providence at his
prayer was delivered, verſe

               
31, 32. and as if that were
not ſufficient, God ſends
another Prophet to him,
Chap. 19. 2. who with open
mouth reproves him and
diſcovers to him his ſinne,
Shouldeſt thou helpe the ungodlie,
and love them that
hate the Lord? therefore is
wrath upon thee from before
the Lord: which meſſage
to ſo good a man doubtleſſe
was not in vaine, but
humbled him for that his
ſin, and wrought repentance
in him to avert that
wrath. And yet after that
great and miraculous deliverance
of him and his
people, Chap. 20. we finde
him relapſing into the
ſame ſin ver. 35. After this
did Iehoſhaphat joyne himſelfe

with Ahaziah King
of Iſrael who did very wickedly,
and he joyned himſelfe
with him to make ſhips to goe
to Tarſhiſh: which another
Prophet in like manner
reprooveth, and likewiſe
God himſelfe rebuked
by the like ill ſucceſſe
of that league to the former,
the ſhips were broken,
verſe 37.
            3 Saint Peter a man,
who ſeemed by other of
his cariages, bold enough,
was yet three ſeverall
times ſurprized with baſe
feare: once when hee
tempted Chriſt, not to hazard
himſelfe at Ieruſalem,
where Chriſt had told
him, that he was to ſuffer:
Matth. 16. 21, 22, 23. Maſter
               
(ſayes hee) ſpare thy
ſelfe: upon which ſpeach
Chriſt calls him, Satan, rebuketh
him more ſharply,
then at any other time,
for which ſurely there
was a more then ordinary
cauſe. Saint Peter thought
that if his Maſter ſhould
ſuffer at Jeruſalem, that
himſelfe, and the reſt
ſhould not be ſafe: That
ſpeech therefore proceeded
from feare, and therefore
Chriſt doth immediately
thereupon call for
ſelfe deniall, and taking
up the Croſſe, verſe 24.
And this was immediately
after peace ſpoken,
verſe 16, 17, 18. CHRIST
had never more comfortably
given teſtimony to

Saint Peter, and his faith,
then there. Yet againe, after
this Chriſt had him up
into the Mount and tranſfigured
himſelfe, to hearten
him againſt that tryall
to come, which made
him ſo confident; yet
then hee denied him, at
his arraignment: when againe
Chriſt immediatly
upon that lookt back upon
him with ſo ſweet a
looke as broke his heart
for this his folly; and ſo he
returned againe, and it
coſt him many a tear; and
Chriſt after the Reſurrection,
owned him againe,
more then any of the reſt,
bad them that firſt met
him, Goe tell Peter, Hee
mentions him by name,

and in eſpeciall, goe tell
him the firſt newes of it:
and then alſo hee aſked
him, Peter, loveſt thou me?
and hee ſaid, Lord, thou
knoweſt I love thee: as if he
had ſaid, Though I have
played the wretch, yet I
love thee: upō this, though
hee grew more bold, Acts
4. 13. yet Gal. 2. 11, 12. we
finde him falling into the
grudgings of the ſame diſeaſe,
which caſt him into
another fitt, hee diſſembled,
fearing them of the
Circumciſion: this was a
ſpice of the former ſinne,
though not ſo groſſe; and
though the outward acts
in theſe ſinnes were divers
in their occaſions,
yet they were all acts and

buds of the ſame root of
bitterneſſe; and may as
well bee called ſins of the
ſame kind, as the committing
differing acts of uncleanneſſe,
are reckoned
falling into the ſame
ſinne.
            In the fourth place, if
the Scriptures had beene
utterly ſilent in examples,
yet reaſon conſonant to
other principles, and
grounds of Divinity, and
of the Scriptures might
perſwade the ſame.
            
               
                  Reaſ. 1 1. If hee may after the
moſt ſerious, and through
repentance fall againe, into
as grievous a ſinne of another
kind, and returne:
why not into the ſame
againe? I confeſſe there

is ſome diſparity, which
might make him more averſe,
and ſet him in ſome
more remoteneſſe, from
the ſame ſinne he hath particularly
repented of, then
another; which ſhall bee
conſidered in its place.
Yet, the difference, cannot
bee ſuppoſed ſuch, as
ſhould make the one poſſible,
and not the other:
all true repentance working
the heart, to an abominating
every ſinne, as
well as any; and therefore
if it were true, it was for
that particular ſinne, as ſin;
and then it would worke
the like againſt all, and
every ſinne, according to
the meaſure of the ſinfulneſſe;
and though it may,

and doth worke a more
keen, and ſpeciall hatred
againſt that particular ſin,
a man hath beene moſt
ſtung with, yet ſtill, this
is but ſo farre, as this aggravation,
(to fall into the
ſame ſinne againe,) may
cauſe ſuch a relapſe, to bee
more ſinfull then another
ſinne: and ſo farre, and upon
that ground he is, and
may bee more ſet and
ſtrengthened againſt it,
then againſt another ſinne.
But then, if the ſuppoſition
fall upon another
groſſe ſinne, never before
committed, the ſole and
ſingle act of which, other
circumſtances make as
heynous, even as this reiterated
act of a ſinne formerly

committed, can be;
then the one is equally as
poſſible as the other. But
however yet ſtill the difference,
is but in degrees;
namely in that the heart
is elongated a degree, or
ſo, further from that ſinne
formerly committed, then
any other: which will not
therefore ſo vary the caſe,
(as magis &amp; minus doe
not) that it ſhould bee
made impoſſible to fall into
the one, and not into
the other.
            
               
                  Reaſ. 2 2. Reaſon: If he may
fall into ſome groſſe ſin,
which at firſt converſion,
hee did above all other
humble himſelfe for; and
yet, that ſame initiall repentance,
did not put him

into ſuch an impoſſibility
of falling into that ſinne
againe: Why then ſhould
a renewed act of repentance
for the ſame, or for
ſome other reiterated ſin,
be ſuppoſed to have ſuch
vertue in it, as to make
him ſhot-free for ever,
from the ſame fiery dart
againe?
            
               
                  Reaſ. 3 Againe thirdly: Let it
be conſidered, frō whence
it ſhould be, that a renewed,
or indeed any act of
true repentance, though
never ſo great, and intenſe,
ſhould have ſuch a
tranſcendent, eternall, and
invincible vertue in it,
and priviledge annexed
to it; for how is it, that
repentance doth ſtrengthen

us againſt ſinne, but
by reſtoring the decayed
frame of Grace, to a better
conſtitution and greater
degree of ſtrength
then before; and by raiſing
it, above a mans luſts,
and above that luſt, more
then all other? as in David,
when hee prayed,
Create in me a cleane heart,
which, through his ſinne
of uncleanneſſe, was in an
eſpeciall manner, defiled
with a proneneſſe to that
ſin: But yet withall remember,
that, that new
frame of heart, &amp; ſtrength
gotten by that renewed
repentance, and that
augmentation, and increaſe
of hatred againſt,
and abominating that

ſinne wrought by it, is all
but a creature; as grace,
and every new degree of
Grace is: and therefore
for preſerving us, hath in
it ſelfe but the power, and
force of a created habit,
which may bee prevailed
againſt, by the ſin that is
in us; and can no more,
nay much leſſe put us into
a ſtate of confirmation againſt
any particular ſin,
then the grace of the Angels
could of it ſelfe confirme
them in a ſtate againſt
all ſinne. And as for
the impreſſion of that bitterneſſe,
which in our repentance
for that ſin fallen
into, was made upon
our hearts: that alſo can
bee ſuppoſed to have but

the like force upon our
ſpirits, that the impreſſion
of joy unſpeakable and
glorious, hath upon the
heart in thoſe heavenly
raptures, which beleevers
ſometimes enjoy; yea
and the latter of theſe
will eaſily be ſuppoſed to
be of the greater efficacie
of the two; and both but
creatures: Now thoſe raviſhing
joyes, are not yet
ſuch immortall and everlaſtingly
quickning cordialls,
that put ſuch ſpirits
into a man, as to preſerve
him from ſwounds, and
faintings of ſpirit for ever:
and though, whilſt
they abide and are preſent
to the heart, they do
then raiſe it above all

thing here below: yet
when a man hath beene
a while off from that
Mount, and hath converſed
a while with things
here againe below; then
that luſtre weares away,
as the glory that ſhined in
Moſes face did: and after
a while, the ſenſe and
preſent taſt of thoſe joyes
weares out; and when
that is gone, the bare remembrance
of thē which
is left, hath not in their
abſence, ſuch an infallible,
though a great efficacy
to preſerve his minde
in an everlaſting diſreliſhing
former delights; but
that hee may, and often
doth fall in love againe
too too much with them:

although indeed whilſt
the preſent ſenſe of them
did abide upon the heart,
it abſtracted the minde
from all things here below.
And hence a man is
apt to fall from his firſt
love, Rev. 2. and from that
high eſteeme of ſpirituall
things; as the Galathians,
Gal. 4. 15. Where is the
bleſſedneſſe you ſpake of,
ſayes Saint Paul to them?
therefore anſwerably the
remembrance of the bitterneſſe
of any ſin felt in
our deepeſt humiliations,
is much leſſe able to preſerve
a man, nor is the impreſſion
and dint made ſo
laſting, nor the ſcarres
and wounds of conſcience
continuing for ever

ſo freſh, as everlaſtingly
to preſerve and deterre us
from falling into the ſame
ſinne againe. For both are
but creatures, and at beſt
but arguments drawne
from ſenſe, and experience
within our ſelves,
and have but an humane
created power which is
not alwayes efficacious;
eſpecially ſeeing GOD
hath ordained us to live by
ſaith, more then by ſenſe,
for faith is appointed by
God to be our more conſtant
keeper, 1. Pet. 1. 5. We
are kept through faith unto
ſalvation, and by it more
ſurely and more conſtantly
then by impreſſions of
joy, or ſorow which are
made to ſenſe: and yet

wee are not kept by it of
it ſelfe, but by the power of
God: ſo then, wee are
kept by the power of God as
the principall ſupporter,
and guardian, through faith
as the inſtrumentall, and
by it rather then by ſenſe
or any other grace of ſorrow
or repentance; becauſe
faith caries the heart
out of it ſelfe, and commits
it ſelfe wholly into
the hands of God as a
faithfull Creator (who is
the ſtrength of Iſrael, to
keepe a man from everie
evill worke,) as not being
able to ſecure it ſelfe againſt
any ſin through the
power of any fortification,
or ſtrength that any
other grace or degree of

grace hath built, no not
for one moment; and
therefore is as dependant
upon God after a fall, and
a renewed repentance out
of it, yea and more then
before hee fell, and his
owne wofull experience
hath reaſon to make him
ſo. The like inſtance to
illuſtrate the truth of this
wee may draw from the
aſſurance of faith it ſelfe.
For even the aſſurance of
faith it ſelfe, (which is an
act properly belonging to
that grace, called therefore
the aſſurance of faith,
Heb. 10. 22.) which doth
ſtrengthen us as much againſt
doubting when it
is joyned with joy unſpeakable
and glorious, as

repentance can do againſt
any other ſinne: and
whileſt it is upon us, in
the ſtrength of it a beleever
is apt to thinke himſelfe
armed and ſtrengthened,
and ſo eſtabliſht, as
that hee ſhall never queſtion
Gods love any
more, or the pardon of
his ſinnes: and yet, experience
ſhewes it, that the
guilt of ſinne prevailes
ſometimes againe, after
this, and the ſame doubts
ariſe, and prevaile as much
as ever; neither will the
remembrance of the former
aſſurance be alwayes
of force enough to reſiſt
them; for hee may come
to queſtion that aſſurance
it ſelfe alſo; and ſo forget

that hee was purged
from his old ſinnes. And if
the guilt of ſin prevaile in
the Conſcience againe, againſt
ſuch a renewed and
ſetled act of faith, why
may not the power of a
luſt prevaile in the members,
after a renewed act
of repentance?
            
               
                  Reaſ. 4 4. If it be ſaid, that a
renewed act of thorow
repentance doth keepe a
man, not by any peculiar
vertue in it ſelfe alone,
but by the power of God
concurrent with it: Then
I demand to ſee the promiſe
wherin God hath infallibly
obliged and ingaged
his power, upon ſuch
a renewed act of repentance,
to preſerve from

falling into that ſinne of
all other for ever; without
which no man in faith
can affirme it; and without
which there is an it
may bee, and a ſuppoſition
of ſuch a poſſibility, as
ſometime falleth out, and
is reduced to exiſtence.
GOD indeed hath ſaid,
that if we fall, hee will put,
under his hand, to breake
that fall that it ſhall not
ruine us; but not ſo to
keep us in his hands, as we
ſhall bee out of danger of
falling againe. A renewed
act of repentance is indeed
an ordinance ſanctified
to preſerve a man;
yet, but in the ſame maner
that other ordinances are,
as Prayer, and the word

preacht, and admonition,
&amp;c. with which GOD
doth not alwayes ſo infallibly
cooperate, as efficaciouſly
to worke alwayes
that which they
ſerve to.
            5. If there were not
ſuch a poſſibility, as might
and doth ſometimes fall
out; then every regenerate
man, after ſuch a renewed
act of repentance,
might ſecure himſelfe
againſt the committing
that groſſe act againe for
ever; but ſo he can never
doe againſt any particular
act of ſinne, but that
ſinne againſt the Holy
Ghoſt. Saint Paul therefore
exhorts, when a
brother is fallen into a

ſinne, to reſtore ſuch an one
with the ſpirit of meekeneſſe;
upon this conſideration,
conſidering thy
ſelfe, leſt thou alſo bee tempted;
and hee layes the
exhortation upon thoſe
who are moſt ſpirituall;
Yee that are ſpirituall, refore
ſuch an one, conſidering
thy ſelfe leſt thou alſo
be tempted, Gal. 6. 1. ſo as
hee ſpeakes of ſuch, as
have their hearts raiſed up
to the beſt frame, through
the moſt deepe, and ſerious
repentance: and now
wee will ſuppoſe one, that
hath formerly fallen himſelfe
into the ſame ſinne,
which another is fallen into,
but not yet reſtored,
but himſelfe is returned

by repentance out of it:
(for indeed, ſuch a ſpirituall
man, is of all other like
to bee the meekeſt boneſetter
of a man fallen,) &amp;
even ſuch doth Saint Paul
exhort to conſider, that
themſelves may for the
time to come, be alſo or in
like manner tempted, that
is, fall as this man fell; and
therefore ſo bee tempted as
to fall into the ſame ſinne
againe, that he was fallen
into. And if any man
could bee ſecure from the
like fall againe, hee had
beene out of the reach of
this exhortation to this
duty upon that ground
mentioned, as not capable
of it. But the Holy Ghoſt
hath elſe where, 1. Cor. 10.
13.

told us, that there is
no tentation which is common
to man, but is incident
to befall any man, at any
time; and therefore verſe
12, exhorts him that ſtandeth,
to take heed leſt be fall:
indeed, that temptation
which is common to Devils
with men, the ſinne of finall
deſpaire, and againſt
the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. a regenerate
man may through
the grace of Chriſt, ſecure
himſelfe againſt: but, all
ſuch ſinnes as are common
to man, from theſe or any
of them, no man in any
ſtate, can without an extraordinary
revelation, ſecure
himſelfe from the
commiſſion of.
            Onely I adde theſe

Cautions concerning this
caſe.
            
               
                  Cautiō 1 1. There are two ſorts
of corruptions. Firſt,
more groſſe corruptions,
which Saint Peter calls,

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , the defilements
of the world, 2. Pet.
2. 20. they being the common
mire, or kennell,
wherein the uncleane
ſwine of this world wallow,
and which the Apoſtle
calls ſuch workes of the
fleſh as are manifeſt, Gal. 5.
19. even to the light of
Nature; ſuch as are adultery,
fornication, drunkenneſſe,
&amp;c. and by thoſe two
expreſſions doe they diſtinguiſh
them from a
ſort of more ſpirituall and
refined luſts. For ſecondly,

there are corruptions
more ſpirituall, as pride,
ſecret love of the world.
Now, for thoſe groſſe
corruptions, which are
contrary, even to common
honeſty, and (to uſe
Iobs phraſe) are puniſht by
the Iudges, 31. Iob 11. which
profane men wallow in,
a godly man hath more
ſtrength againſt them, ſo
as it is not ſo ordinary for
him to bee entangled againe
and againe with
theſe; for where but morall
principles are, theſe
are abſtained from, as we
ſee in the Phariſee, I am no
adulterer, &amp;c. therefore,
where grace is, much
more. And ſome ſinnes are
more oppoſite to the ſpirit

of holineſſe, and leſſe
compatible with grace,
as uncleaneſſe, of which
Saint Paul ſayes, God hath
not called us to uncleaneſſe,
but to holineſſe, 1 Theſ. 4.
7. it is in an eſpeciall manner,
there oppoſed to
holineſſe: and ſuch as theſe
are works of the fleſh which
are manifeſt, even to Nature,
to civill men: and
therefore when they are
often fallen into, they doe
manifeſt, that the heart is
but fleſh. And although
the limits, how ſeldome
or how often, cannot bee
ſet concerning relapſes
into theſe, or any ſinnes;
yet, in an ordinary courſe
it may be ſaid, that few
godly men fall into ſuch

ſinnes againe and againe:
God keepes them from
ſuch in an ordinary providence,
that ſcandalls
ſhould not ariſe: they being
ſinnes which all the
world takes notice of.
But thoſe other ſinnes of
raſh anger, and love of
the world, and ſpirituall
pride, &amp;c. theſe being leſſe
manifeſt, and ſitting more
cloſe to our ſpirits, godly
men are more ſubject
unto.
            Yet ſecondly: we muſt
againe diſtinguiſh.
            1. There are the inward
luſtings to thoſe
outward acts: now, though
grace weakeneth the very
luſtings within, yet, takes
them not wholly away:

               The ſpirit that is in us, (that
is,) in us Saints, ſayes S.
Iames, luſteth to envy: and
as to envy, ſo to all other
ſinnes.
            
            And ſecondly, there are
the outward groſſe acts of
ſuch ſins; and there in the
weakneſſe of ſin in a regenerate
man, and ſtrength
of grace ſhewes it ſelfe
moſt in preferving from
them: for, as to will is
preſent with me ſaies S. Paul
to will what is good, yet how
to performe it I am not able,
Rom. 7. 18. So on the contrary,
to luſt the heart
may bee ready, and luſt
may ſoone riſe up in
rebellion, but when it
ſhould come to the act,
there is a weakneſſe diſcovered;

they come to the
birth, and want ſtrength
often to bring forth; the
contrary luſting and prevailing
of grace being
then ſeene and diſcovering
it ſelfe: that it fareth
with a regenerate man in
this caſe often as with a
man that is deadly wounded,
who riſeth up to
ſtrike his enemy, and
thinkes to runne him
thorow, but ſinks downe
againe, medio conatu, when
his ſword is at his enemies
breaſt, through a deficiency
of ſpirits; or as a man
in a Palſie, or the Gout,
who thinks hee is able to
walke, til he comes to try,
and then he finds a weakneſſe
which makes him

fall backe againe: Thus,
even when the whole
forces of luſts are muſtred
up, yet the weapons fall
out of their hands. Humours
in a healthfull conſtitution,
may ſtirre, and
boake in the ſtomacke,
when yet they come not
up, nor prevaile unto vomiting.
In that place afore
named, Gal. 5. the Apoſtle
ſeemes not to deny
but that in the moſt
regenerate, luſtings may
ariſe, for the fleſh (ſayes he)
luſteth againſt the ſpirit, ver.
17. but yet, as for outward
acts, he tels them, verſe 16.
That if they walke in the
ſpirit, that is, in the prevalency
of the ſpirit, keeping
up a holy frame of

heart above the fleſh, that
then yee ſhall not fulfill the
luſts of the fleſh: for that
frame of heart ſo kept up,
will hinder the outward
fulfilling of the luſt; which
is never done till fleſh
and corruption is actually
raiſed above the ſpirit, &amp;
gets more voyces to carry
it; till the ſpirit be under
hatches, and the fleſh
above, and ſo ſteeres the
helme:otherwiſe the luſting
of the ſpirit againſt
the fleſh, will hinder the
outward doing, and fulfilling
of a luſt. For the reaſon
hee gives, verſe 17. ſo
as you cannot doe what you
would, implyes, that not
onely luſtings, which ariſe
without conſent, may be

in ſuch a man but further,
much of the will may
bee wonne to conſent to
them, to like them; when
yet there is not ſtrength
enough to carry it on to
the outward act; you cannot
doe what you would. And
what thoſe works of the
fleſh are, which are manifeſt
workes of the fleſh,
and which Chriſtians
whilſt they walke in the
Spirit fulfill not, hee mentions
and reckons up in
the following words. And
this is the more ordinary
frame of a Chriſtians
heart; for verſe 24. (ſayes
hee) they that are Chriſts
have crucified the affections
and luſts, that is, ſo farre, as
not to fulfill them.
            
               
3. He may more eaſily
fall into a groſſe ſinne of
another kinde, then into
the ſame after ſpeciall repentance
for it, and peace
ſpoken in the pardon of
it. Becauſe true repentance
eſpecially fortifies
the heart againſt that ſin
which a man hath moſt
repented him of; and ſincerity
lies more in watching
over that ſinne then any
other: ſo ſayes David,
Pſal. 18. I was upright, and
kept my ſelfe from mine iniquity,
that eſpeciall ſinne
which was eminently his
ſinne. A mans arme that
hath beene broke, will, if
well ſet, rather breake in
ſome other place then
where it was broke at the

firſt. Hence ſometimes it
falls out, that that which
was a godly mans boſome
ſinne before converſion,
continues not to be ſo after:
but, another ſteps up
in the roome of it, by reaſon
that hee then endeavoureth
to waſh out that
great ſtaine, moſt; and
ſpendeth the moſt of the
Fullers ſope, to purge
himſelfe from it; and ſo
becomes, ever after, moſt
watchfull over it; and ſets
in this his weakeſt place,
the ſtrongeſt gariſon, and
a watch, to prevent the
enemy. And, as an act of
ſome preſumptuous ſinne,
though it inclines the
heart more to all ſinne,
then before, yet, eſpecially,

to commit that kinde
of ſinne againe, rather then
any other: ſo on the contrary,
is it in a ſound and
ſolemne repentance, for
ſome eſpeciall ſinne; and
in the endeavouring, to
mortifie ſome eſpeciall
member of the body of
ſinne: (to mortifie which,
not only in the bulke and
generall, but alſo particularly
and apart in the ſeverall
members of it, the
Holy Ghoſt exhorts, Coloſ.
3. 5.) though thereby, the
whole habit of the body
of ſinne is purged and
weakned, yet that particular
ſinne which we aime
eſpecially to have mortified,
is through Gods bleſſing
more ſubdued then

any other. We ſee Idolatry,
was the ſinne which
the people of Iſrael relapſed
into, againe and againe;
yet when they
were once throughly
humbled by the Captivity
for it, they never returned
to it, of all ſinnes
elſe, not to this day: ſo as
it may bee ſaid, as was
foretold, haply in an other
caſe, Ezek. 16. 43.
Thou ſhalt not commit this
lewdneſſe of all thy abominations:
Ionah, though he
would haply never runne
away from God againe,
after his Gaole delivery
out of the Whales belly;
yet, immediately, after
peace ſpoken to his heart
hee falls into a ſin of another

kinde; into a paſſion
of extreme anger and peeviſhneſſe,
and quarrelling
againſt God. And the reaſon
of this eſpeciall tenderneſſe
to fall into the
ſame ſinne, is, becauſe the
Conſcience lookes upon
a relapſe into that ſinne,
to bee more hainous, then
into any other ſinne of another
kind; becauſe of
that aggravation of it,
which thereby would
ſtaine and die it: and although
a ſinne of another
kind ſhewes the variety
of corruption more; yet,
this is more againſt the
power and worke of repentance
it ſelfe, which
was particularly exerciſed
about that ſinne: and

alſo breaks, and diſſolveth
all bands of a mans vows,
covenants, prayers, &amp;c.
made againſt it in particular,
and ſo is made more
grievous. And this wee
may ſee in Ezraes humbling
himſelfe for that
great ſinne of the people,
in joyning themſelves in
marriage with the people
of the land, when hee did
ſet himſelfe to humble
himſelfe for them, together
with thoſe that feared
God, Chap. 9. 4. What an
hideous apprehenſion of
the hainouſneſſe of that
ſinne, if they ſhould again
fall into it, did that dayes
repentance raiſe his heart
up unto? as appears v. 14.
Should we againe breake thy

commandements, and joyn in
affinity with them, wouldſt
thou not deſtroy us, till thou
hadſt conſumed us, and till
there was no eſcaping? Into
which ſinne, yet, the people
did againe fall, after
they had repented of it,
with a ſolemne confeſſion
and promiſe of amendment,
which is recorded,
Chap. 10. v. 11, 12. &amp;c. yet
they returned to it againe
the ſecond time, as wee
finde in Malachie, who lived
the laſt of the Prophets,
and after this prayer
of Ezra. For Chap. 2. 12.
the Prophet ſayes, An abomination
is committed in Ieruſalem,
for Iuda hath marryed
the daughter of a
ſtrange god: and then followes

the aggravation, v.
13. This ye have done again,
that is, the ſecond time,
and in that reſpect are
challenged to deale treacherouſly;
and that alſo in
reſpect they had repented
of it the firſt time, covering
the Altar with teares,
with weeping, and crying
out, as Malachie there
ſpeakes: ſo as God regardeth
not your offerings any
more. And therefore alſo
Pſal. 78. 40. How oft did they
(ſaith hee, as aggravating
their ſins) by murmuring
provoke the Lord? and
Numb. 14. 22. God reckons
up, and mentions the
times of their ſinning,
how often they had thus
ſinned, as an aggravation

of them, They have tempted
me theſe ten times.
            
            
               
                  Cautiō 4 4. He may fall into the
ſame ſinne againe and againe,
 untill hee hath recovered
himſelfe, and
his peace fully by a thorough
repentance, but
yet ſeldome after. Lot
committed inceſt two
nights together; but the
orifice of his luſt, was not
yet ſtopped by repentance;
the wound was not
cloſed, and ſo bled againe
afreſh; but when it is healed
once, and the heart
made perfect with God,
and divorced from that
ſinne, and entred into
Communion with God againe;
then though it may
fall out, yet a man more

hardly returnes. A woman
that is gone from her
huſband may play the
whore a long while with
him ſhe ran away withall,
till her husband fetches
her again: but to run often
away, after receiving again,
is intolerable. That is
not ſo ordinary in Gods
childe.
            
               
                  Cautiō 5 5. Though wee can
hardly ſet limits to ſay
when, or when not, this
ſhall fall out from the degrees
of mens repentings:
as that if they have ſuch or
ſuch a degree of repentance,
then they fall no
more: yet we may further
conſider a difference of
their returnings to God, &amp;
repentings; and of Gods

ſpeaking peace.
            1. Of their Repentings:
ſome are more imperfect,
and but as it were thawings
of the minde a little,
by meanes of a little Sunſhine
of Gods love: ſome,
are more thorow and
deep; that recover a man,
and put him into a ſound
and healthfull eſtate. As
for example, a man in an
ague hath well dayes, yet
his fits returne, and it may
be they leave him for a
month or ſo; and yet they
take him againe, as at
Spring and Autumne;
which is becauſe all this
while his body is not thorowly
recovered to a ſtate
of health: ſo is it with a
mans heart in reſpect of

his luſts; though he may
have many well dayes,
wherein hee may eate his
meate, and receive ſweetneſſe
in the word, and ordinances:
yet at times his
diſtempers and aguiſh fits
returne, he being aguiſh
ſtill; but in the end, after
the peace of God hath
more thoroughly eſtabliſhed
his heart, he attaines
to ſome ſetled conſtant
victory over it; and when
it doth not prevaile to
victory, ſuch aguiſh fits
end uſually in conſumptions,
in which long agues
often end: as in Temporaries,
in whom, ſinne
overcomming GODS
ſtriving with them, it
eates all good beginnings

out; but if they belong
to GOD, then uſually
that aguiſh diſtemper, is
in the end by a more thorough
repentance, ſo healed,
as that they attaine
to more victory, and ſecurity
againſt it then any
other ſinne; that as in
thoſe other kind of tentations,
it often falls out,
that, that which a man
doubted of moſt, hee
comes in the end to bee
moſt aſſured of, and to
doubt no more; ſo alſo
here, a man becomes moſt
freed from that ſinne, hee
was long exerciſed with
of all other. So alſo
            2. For Gods dealings
with his, there is much
difference therein to bee

found: there are ſome
kinds of ſpeaking peace by
God, and meltings of the
heart of his people, which,
yet are not of that force as
to overcome, but wherein
God doth but (as it were)
ſtrive with them; which
ſtrivings doe ever and
anon worke their hearts
to a repentance, and that
true, and ſerious: which
yet is not ſo deepe, and
thorough, nor ſo healing
the heart at the bottome,
as it ſhould. For GOD
ſometimes uſeth more
imperfect kinde of ſtrivings,
even with his own
children, about ſome particular
ſinne they are to
leave, which doe not ſo
fully, at firſt prevaile, and

overcome in them; which
God doth, to let them ſee
the running iſſue of their
natures, how grace would
runne out at it,Heb. 2. 1. (as the Apoſtle
ſpeakes) and overcome
grace in them, if hee
ſhould let it alone: and
ſo, lets out upon his child
after many yeeres ſome
luſt, which had been long
downe, which puts him to
it exceedingly, ſo that he
is in hazzard to bee undone,
and is put into
feares of it; and yet God
viſiteth his ſpirit by fits,
and per intervalla at times
ſtrives with him; and
though hee falls, yet hee
puts under his hand, and
gives him well dayes, and
ſome comfortable viſitations;

yet ſuch as are not
deep enough to worke
him fully off from it. For,
as God ſtrives with wicked
men, ſo he ſometimes
ſtrives with his own alſo;
which may ſeeme to bee
the true meaning of that
ſpeech, Gen. 6. where, having
mentioned the ſinne
of his owne children, ver.
2. That the Sonnes of
God tooke to them wives
of that wicked ſeed of
Cain, hee ſayes, My Spirit
ſhall not alwayes ſtrive
with man, for that [he alſo]
is but fleſh: Hee meanes
not this, of all mankinde,
for he ſayes, [hee alſo] is
but fleſh: now, with what
other creatures, doth hee
joyne them in this compariſon,

but with others
of the ſonnes of men? ſo
as the meaning is, I ſee my
Children, that they alſo
are corrupt, and degenerate
as well as the reſt of
mankinde, and my Spirit
hath ſtriven with them.
In which ſtriving, GOD
lets them ſee, how if hee
did not in the end, ſhew
foorth his free love to the
full, in the reſcuing of
them, and healing their
backſliding, they would
bee undone: ſo as, in the
end, through his grace
which is ſufficient, they
obtaine the greateſt conqueſt,
over that luſt of any
other; when the heart is
once thoroughly awakened,
and ſetled in a thorow

peace. And as,
thoſe doubts they were
moſt troubled with once,
(which though they had
at times ſome light againſt,
yet by fits did ſtill
ariſe) are yet in the end,
ſo overcome, as they ariſe
no more, but they enjoy
the greateſt freedome
from them: So is it often
herein. And theſe ſtrivings
to not overcomming, I reſemble
to the thawings of
the Ice, in a great froſt, as
when in the day time, the
Sunne ſhines, and in the
Sunſhine it thaweth a little:
but yet, ſo as at night,
or in the ſhade it freezeth;
when ſometimes, the weather
alſo begins to change
for a night, and yet falls a

freeing againe: ſo here,
there is not ſuch a thorow
ſhedding abroad the
love of God in the heart,
as ſhould make a thorow
generall thaw, to the purpoſe
as wee ſay; and ſo,
when the heat of that is
withdrawen, it freezeth
againe: but in the end
there comes a more thorow
and generall thaw,
and change that carries all
away, melts the heart, and
ſo alters the temper and
conſtitution of the weather,
(as I may ſo ſpeake)
as it freezeth no more.
And ſuch a thawing of his
heart had David, when
Nathan came to him, and
not afore; though it may
bee hee had thoſe leſſer

relentings often before.
            But let thoſe that are in
ſuch a caſe, take heed they
bee not hardened thorow the
deceitfulneſſe of ſinne and
of all the times, that paſſe
over you, in your lives,
theſe are the moſt climactiericall,
and criticall, and
moſt dangerous. For God
will not alwayes ſtrive, but
if thou beeſt his childe, if
ſuch thawings will not do
it, hee will uſe ſome great
afflictions, in the end to
divorce the heart, and thy
ſin; his love will one way
or other, overcome thee,
and in the end prevaile.
As when Iſrael went on
ſtubbornely in the way of his
heart, (ſayes God) I have
ſeene his wayes and will heale

him and guide him, Eſay 57.
&amp; the Lord may ſo heale
thee, as thoſe luſts of all
other ſhall not in that
groſſe maner, breake forth
any more. And in thoſe
times, when God dealeth
thus with him, a man will
after ſay, that in ſuch paſſages
of his life, hee had
more free love ſpent on
him, then in all his life
time, before or after: and
when he is freed and healed,
he will be more thankfull,
and fearefull then ever
before, or then otherwiſe
he would have been;
and ſo get ground by his
ſtumblings. If any of you,
being now in ſuch a conflict
as this, in ſuch a viciſſitude
and chance of war:

If yet thou findeſt a conſtant
fight againſt thy ſin;
and that thoſe breakings,
and meltings of thy heart
by God, do winne ground
of it; and that the comforts,
and hope, which at
times are vouchſafed, doe
ſtrengthen, &amp; ſtabliſh thy
heart in well doing: as 2.
Theſſ. 2. ult; and makes
thee more fearefull, every
time thou riſeſt, then ever;
ſo as to looke upon
another fit if it ſhould
come, (which knowing
the deceitfulneſſe of the
heart, thou feareſt,) as
the fit of ſome great ſickneſſe,
leſt it ſhould returne
againe: eſteeming it as
the greateſt croſſe that
can befall thee; which

thou wouldeſt buy off
with thy blood; and bleedeſt
moſt of all to thinke,
that thou haſt ſo unconſtant
a heart, which as it
hath abuſed Gods love
formerly, ſo thou feareſt,
will doe ſo againe; if thus
thou go on to fight it out,
the love of God will in
the end overcome in thee;
but if thou findeſt that
thoſe encouragements frō
God, do through thy corruption,
(which turnes
Gods grace into wantonneſſe)
nouriſh thy luſts,
and make thee leſſe fearefull
againſt the next time;
and thy heart harder, and
ſecure, and to ſlight ſinne
more, becauſe thou haſt
beene ſo oft viſited from

on high, and pardoned:
thy caſe is dangerous, and
may prove deſperate.
            6. Though he may returne,
yet not preſently:
Luke 5. laſt. Hee that hath
taſted old wine, doth not
ſtraightway drinke, and deſire
new: not whileſt the
love of God, and the taſt,
and reliſh of it is freſh in
his mouth: when the impreſſion
is worne out indeed,
and begins to bee
forgotten, then haply he
may returne.
            
               
                  Vſe. 
                To conclude with the
uſe of this point; If it be
folly to runne into the
ſame ſinne, though we repent
of it afterwards:
then, what folly is it in
them that utterly fall away?

and after they
have beene enlightned, and
taſted of the good word of
God, then fall againe to
the pleaſures of ſinne and
never repent of them?
as many doe; that come,
and try a little, what is in
religion, and the wayes of
God, and then returne againe
to their vomits, and
never returne to piety againe.
Fooliſh ſoules, who
hath bewitched you? are
yee ſo fooliſh, that having
begun in the ſpirit, yee end
in the fleſh? as Gal. 3. 3.
Folly indeed: to ſpend the
harveſt of your time, in
ſeeking God, and then to
leave him, when you are
about to take leave of the
pleaſures of ſinne. Alas

poore ſoules, whither will
yee goe? doe you ever
thinke to have ſuch a God
againe? Thou haſt the words
of eternall life, ſaid the
Diſciples to Chriſt: and
as Saul ſaid to his ſervants,
to keep them from falling
away unto David; Can
the ſonne of Ieſſe give you
vineyards, and make you
Captaines of thouſands?
1. Sam. 22. 7: So, can
the world give you that
peace, that I can give
you, may Chriſt ſay to
you; yea and heaven beſides
hereafter? Is the devil,
with all the wages
of ſinne, you poſt after, able
to make you amends?
you thereby diſhonour
God in returning to ſinne,
               
and bring an evill report
upon the good land; and
diſcredit your Maſter, in
changing your ſervice;
but withall you befoole
your ſelves moſt: you
returne to folly. For even
that, which you thinke to
gaine, the worlds good
word and opinion by,
even that you loſe: for,
though they make aſpoile
of you, and triumph in
ſuch, and glory in their fleſh
a while: yet they never inwardly
think well of ſuch
a one; nor truely love
him. A back-ſlider, is like
luke-warme water, having
been once heated, which
good men ſpue out, and
evill men regard not; for
what uſe, can indeed bee

made of it? Like ſalt that
hath loſt its ſavour it is
good for nothing, but the
dunghill. Like one that
hath beene maried, but
lives divorced; ſhe is undone
for her mariage ever
after. Such is the condition
of thoſe that fall away
and repent not: You
who have but turned
unto folly and are not
grown to a deſpiſing and
deſpiting Gods wayes,
Returne, Oh Shulamite,
returne. And you that
have peace and communion
with God, take heed
you do not loſe him, you
will never have ſuch a
God againe.
            FINIS.
