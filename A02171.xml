            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

shauelings are not his successors, but approoued by their
liues and doctrine, to be professed Antechristes. Peter was
humble and spent his time in praier and preaching, these
are proude and meddle with states, Empires, kingdomes
and Monarchies, pulling down one and creating another
hauing Emperours knéeling at his féete, and casting off
their crowns with his toe, treading on their backes, and
blasphemously applying the text to him selfe, Calcabo super
Aspidem, &amp; Leonem. These presumptuous thoughtes
were not founde in Peter, who imitating his Maister
Christ, walked abroade to féede his Flocke: this (the
Pope I meane) following the aspyring attempt of Lucifer,
is carried on mens shoulders, and yet in his hereticall
Bulles to blinde the People, hee calleth himselfe
Seruus Seruorum: guarded not as Peter was with the
faythfull of Israel, but either with his stout Cardinalles,
Copesmates of Caiphas Crue, or with some detestable
Courtizans, the best imblazers of his profession. Long
did this Monster maske in a Shéepes skin, partlye couered

laide open for Antechrist to the world. So that his verye
Countrymen Italians, nursed vp vnder his nose, séeing

Doctrine that the Churche of Rome is the supreame

                  t before the wind:
and no doubt if we enter into the déepe consideration of
the Spanish attempt, wee shall finde it sent into these
partes by the Lorde for speciall causes. First to shew vs
howe for our sinnes hee can bring the very enemies of
his trueth, as Ministers of his wrath, to punish offenders,
as oft hée did against the Israelites when they
transgressed his Statutes a
                     •
                  d Lawes, neglected the

were hedged in with the sea, and had a long and peaceable
time of quiet: made sloothfull by these his fauoures,
his Maiestie brought in these Spaniardes to waken vs
out off our dreams, to teach the braue men of this realm,
that after peace comes warres, that in the greatest quiet
wée shoulde applye our selues to martiall indeuours,
and know how to handle the Sword a

                  er subdued the Cananites, but the
Lord did put weapons in their handes to execute the end
of his victories. The third, he sent them as sommons and
Ambassadors to incourage vs to attempt the like: for
when the Sarasens in the time of Charles the greate, had
inuaded Germanie, and the frontes of France, the newes
hereof brought to the Emperour, he presently saide, how
doth the Lorde fauourablye accuse vs of sloth and carelesnesse
of increasing his religion by those Pagans, when
they for their Mohomet and the aduancement of his blasphemies,
hazarde their liues to suppresse the contrary.
And I seeme to sit at home: and dare not for the Lord of
Hostes cause, enter armes against the Infidels, so that awakened
with this, Charles not onely withstood them in
his owne land, but hauing geuen them the repulse, spent
many yeares in setting foorth the glory of GOD by the
sword, among the miscreants: So no doubt these Spaniardes,
the Souldiors of Antechrist, are sent to tell our
Nobles, Captaines and martiall men of this land, that
they sléepe secure, that the Bées hiue in their Helmets,
that their pampered horses serue for foot-clothes, not for
the fielde: that wee suffer the enemies▪ of the trueth too
much to offer vs the braue: These causes no doubt mooued
the Lord to send them, and yet to subuert them: to
shew them he fouoreth his people, and vseth reuenge against
the despisers of his Gospell: therefor are such men
greatly to be commended, that for the benefite of theyre
Countrey, feare not to hazard their liues, especially if it
were with the aduancement of the glory of God. If then

palpably heretical to al true Christians, let vs in a word
or two looke into their liues, wherein as in a Christall
Mirrour, wée shall see figured and pourtraid the Anatomie

in their heartes, puffed vppe with aspiring thoughtes,
and in their Apparell, set out with inestimable brauerie,
the meanest Scholler of the least Traueyler, eyther

couered with his Scarlet Robe, and his sumptuous
traine following him, shall thincke that hée méeteth not
one of Peters Disciples, but some greate Potentate, or
Monarch of the worlde, rather resembling ALEXANDER
in his effeminate Persian robes, when hée surnamed
himselfe the sonne of AMMON, then a Christian,

before Capua, the Senate hearing the il nowes,
resolued in the Senate house to sacrifice vnto Mars, fearing
hee was displeased with their Armie: which sentence
Scipio hearing, starting vp amongst them said: I will no
other God but our fortunes, no other vowes but our right,
no other Sacrifice but the Sword. I infer this heathenish
comparison, both accounting their Saint of Compostella

and his stomack to be equally poysed: the one false,

                  CAESAR béeing Dictator for the
Romanes, &amp; hauing conquered France,
hearing that there was a little Ilande
beyonde, full of hardy and couragious
people, thirsting after honour, and coueting
to increase the Romane Monarchie,
hée rigged his Fleete, and cut ouer into England,
where he founde such harde landing, that hée was glad to
passe away with the repulse: but hée, whose minde was
impatient of dishonour: after he had renewed his fléete,
made a long oration to incourage them, but they found
so hard a breakefast, that hardly they could be induced to
giue the second attempt. The Spaniardes béeing but in
respect our Neighbours, hearing how not onely we haue
defended our owne Realme, but made diuers inuasions
with greate victories: as Edward the thirde in France,
and Henrie the fift, who forced the King by armes to proclaime
him heire apparant, in so much that Henrie the
sixt sate crowned in Paris. The poore Souldiours hauing
heard of these and other our resolutions, were discouraged
before they came, and feared to buckle with men
so hardy and fortunate although they were both charged
by their King, and incouraged by the Pope with a generall
pardon a poena &amp; culpa, yet al the perswasions would
not serue, for diuers hid themselues, and other by fained
excuses sought absence, but at last compelled forwarde,
and forced to take shipping, they found here that they

feared: men that durst abide their braue, and returne
them blowe for blowe, not the naked Moores, nor the
fainting Portugall, but English men that prize honour
as déere as their liues: who if they heare but this word
Elizabetha, they flie like Lions in the face of the Enemy,
nay in the mouth of the Cannon, rather opposing themselues
to ten thousand deathes, then the fortune of her enemies
should touch her royall Maiestie with any contrary
passion. Féeling thus what they feared, some taken
Prisoners, others slaine, a multitude drowned in the sea
by Shipwrack, the remnant of poore mercenary men cry
cut in bytternesse of minde.
