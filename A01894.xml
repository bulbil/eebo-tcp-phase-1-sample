            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                     Was that then which is good made death unto mee?
God forbid. But ſinne, that it might appeare ſin,
working death in mee by that which is good: that
ſinne by the commandement might become exceeding
ſinfull.
                  
                  
                     WEE finde our Apoſtle in the
9. verſe to have been alive,
but ſtruck upon the ſudden
dead, by an apparition preſented
to him in the glaſſe of
the law, of the ſinfulneſſe of
ſinne. Sin revived, ſayes the
9. verſe, appeared to be ſinne,
ſayes the 13. verſe, lookes but like it ſelfe, above
meaſure ſinfull: and hee falls downe dead at the
very ſight of it: I dyed, ſayes he in the 9. it wrought

death in me, ſayes the 13. that is, an apprehenſion
of death and hell, as due to that eſtate I was
then in. But yet as the life of ſinne was the death
of Paul, ſo this death of his was but a preparation
to a new life, I through the Law and dead to the
Law, that I might live to God, Gal. 2. 19. and here
hee likewiſe ſpeakes of Gods worke upon him at
his firſt converſion; for then it was that hee relates
how ſinne became in his eſteeme, ſo above
meaſure ſinfull.
                  
                  The ſubject then to be inſiſted on is the ſinfulneſſe
of ſinne, a ſubject therefore as neceſſary as
any other, becauſe if ever we be ſaved, ſinne muſt
firſt appeare to us all, as it did here to him, above
meaſure ſinfull.
                  
                  And firſt, becauſe all knowledge begins at the
effects which are obvious to ſenſe, and interpreters
of the nature of things, therefore wee will
begin this Demonſtration of the evill of ſin, from
the miſchievous effects it hath filled the world
withall, it having done nothing but wrought
miſchiefe ſince it came into the world, and all the
miſchiefe that hath beene done, it alone hath
done, but eſpecially towards the poore ſoule of
man, the miſerable ſubject of it.
                  Which firſt it hath debaſed the ſoule of man,
the nobleſt creature under heaven, and higheſt
allyed, made to be a companion fit for God
himſelfe, but ſinne hath ſtript it of its firſt native
excellency, as it did Reuben, Gen. 49. 41. debaſed
the ſoule more worth than all the world, as
Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, that onely went to the

price of it: yet ſinne hath made it a drudge and
ſlave to every creature it was made to rule:
therefore the Prodigall as a type is ſaid to ſerve
ſwine, and feed on huskes, ſo as every vanity maſters
it. Therefore we find in Scripture, that men
are ſaid to be ſervants to wine, Tit. 2. 3. ſervants to
riches, and divers luſts, &amp;c.
                  And hence it is that ſhame attends upon it, Rom.
6. 21. Now ſhame ariſeth out of an apprehenſion
of ſome excellencie debaſed: and by how much
the excellencie is greater, by ſo much is the
ſhame the greater, and therefore unutterable
confuſion will one day befall ſinners: becauſe
ſinne is the debaſement of an unvaluable excellencie.
                  Secondly, it not onely debaſeth it, but defiles
it alſo; and indeed there was nothing elſe that
could defile it, Mat. 15. 20. for the ſoule is a moſt
pure beame, bearing the image of the Father of
lights: as farre ſurpaſſing the ſinne in pureneſſe,
as the ſunne doth a clod of earth; and yet all the
dirt in the world cannot defile the ſunne; all the
clouds that ſeeke to muffle it, it ſcatters them all:
but ſinne hath defiled the ſoule, yea, one ſinne,
the leaſt defiles it, in an inſtant, totally, eternally.
                  
                  Firſt, one ſinne did it in the fall of Adam, Rom.
5. 17. one offence polluted him, and all the world.
Now ſuppoſe you ſhould ſee one drop of darkneſſe
ſeazing on the ſunne, and putting out that
light and eye of heaven, and to looſen it out of
the orbe it moves in, and cauſe it to drop downe
a lump of darkneſſe, you would ſay it were a

ſtrange darkneſſe: this ſinne did then in the ſoule,
to which yet the ſunne is but as a Taper.
                  Secondly, it defiles it thus in an inſtant. Take
the moſt glorious Angell in heaven, and let one
of the leaſt ſinnes ſeaze upon his heart, he would
in an inſtant fall downe from heaven, ſtript of all
his glory, the uglieſt creature that ever was beheld:
you would count that the ſtrongeſt of all
poyſons, that would poyſon in an inſtant; as Nero
boiled a poiſon to that height, that it killed Germanicus
as ſoone as he received it; now ſuch an
one is ſinne.
                  Thirdly, ſinne defiles it totally: it reſts not in
one member onely, but beginning at the underſtanding,
eates into the will and affections; ſoaks
through all. Thoſe diſeaſes we account ſtrongeſt,
which ſeaze not on a joynt or a member onely,
but ſtrikes rottenneſſe through the whole body.
                  Fourthly, it defiles eternally, it being aterna
macula, a ſtaine which no nitre or ſope, or any creature
can waſh out, Ier. 2. 21. There was once let in
a deluge of water, and the world was all overflow'd
with it; it waſhed away ſinners indeed,
but not one ſinne. And the world ſhall be a fire
again at the latter day, and all that fire, and theſe
flames in hell that follow, ſhall not purge out
one ſinne.
                  Thirdly, it hath robbed the ſoule of the image
of God, deprived us of the glory of God, Rom. 3. 23.
the image of Gods holineſſe, which is his beauty
and ours: wee were beautifull and all glorious
once within, which though but an accident, is

more worth than all mens ſoules devoid of it, it
being a likeneſſe unto God, a divine nature,
without which no man ſhall ſee God. Though
man in Innocency had all perfections united in
him via eminentiae, that are to be found in other
creatures, yet this was more worth than all: for
all the reſt made him not like to God, as this did;
without which all Paradiſe could not make
Adam happy; which when he had loſt, he was
left naked, though thoſe his other perfections remained
with him; which is profitable for all things,
as the Apoſtle ſayes. The leaſt dramme of
which, the whole world emballanced with,
would be found too light; without which the
glorious Angels would be damned devills, the
Saints in heaven damned ghoſts, this it hath robbed
man of.
                  Fourthly, it hath robbed man even of God
himſelfe: Your ſinnes ſeparate (ſayes God) betwixt
you and me: and therefore they are ſaid to live
without God in the world: and in robbing a man of
God, it robs him of all things; for all things are
ours, but ſo farre as God is ours; of God whoſe
face makes heaven, he is all in all, his loving kindneſſe
is better than life, and containeth beauty, honours,
riches, all: yea they are but a drop to
him.
                  But its miſchiefe hath not ſtaid here, but as the
Leproſie of the Lepers in the old Law, ſometimes
infected their houſes, garments; ſo it hath hurld
confuſion over all the world, brought a vanitie
on the creature,
                     Gen. 2. 
                     Rom. 8. 23. and a curſe: and had

not Chriſt undertooke the ſhattered condition of
the world to uphold it,Heb. 1. 2. it had fallen about Adams
cares.
                  And though the old walls and ruinous palace
of the world ſtands to this day, yet the beauty, the
gloſſe, and glory of the hangings is ſoyled and
marred with many imperfections caſt upon every
creature.
                  But as the houſe of the Leper was to be pulled
downe, and Traitors houſes uſe to be made jakes:
ſo the world (if Chriſt had not ſtept in) had
ſhrunke into its firſt nothing: and you will ſay,
that is a ſtrong carrion that retaines not onely
infection in it ſelfe, but infects all the aire about:
ſo this, that not the ſoule the ſubject of it onely,
but all the world.
                  Laſtly, it was the firſt founder of hell, and laid
the firſt corner ſtone thereof: ſinne alone brought
in and filled that bottomleſſe gulfe with all the
fire, and brimſtone, and treaſures of wrath, which
ſhall never be burnt and conſumed. And this crucified
and pierced Chriſt himſelfe, poured on
him his Fathers wrath, the enduring of which
for ſinne, was ſuch, as that all the Angels in heaven
had crackt and ſunke under it.
                  But yet this eſtimate is but taken from the effects
of it, the eſſence of it which is the cauſe of
all theſe evills, muſt needs have much more miſchiefe
in it. Shall I ſpeak the leaſt evill I can ſay
of it? It conteins all evills alſ
                           •
                         in it: therefore
Iames 1. 23. the Apoſtle calls it filthineſſe, and
abundance of ſuperfluitie, or excrement as it were,

of naughtineſſe. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . As if ſo tranſcendent,
that if all evills were to have an excrement,
a ſcumme, a ſuperfluitie, ſinne is it, as being
the abſtracted quinteſſence of all evill. An evill,
which in the nature and eſſence of it virtually,
and eminently, containes all evills of what kinde
ſoever that are in the world; Inſomuch as in the
Scriptures you ſhall finde that all the evills in the
world, ſerve but to anſwer for it, and to give
names to it. Hence ſinne it is called poyſon, and ſinners
ſerpents: ſinne is called a vomit, ſinners dogs:
ſinne the ſtench of graves, and they rotten ſepulchres:
ſinne mire, ſinners ſowes: and ſinne darkneſſe,
blindneſſe, ſhame, nakedneſſe, folly, madneſſe,
death, whatſoever is filthy, defective, infective,
painfull. Now as the holy Ghoſt ſayes of Nabal,
as is his name, ſo is he; ſo may wee ſay of
ſinne: for if Adam gave names to all things, according
to their nature, much more God, who
calls things as they are. Surely God would not
ſlander ſinne, though it be his onely enemie. And
beſides, there is reaſon for this, for it is the cauſe
of all evills. God ſowed nothing but good ſeed
in the world; He beheld, and ſaw all things were
very good. It is ſinne hath ſowne the tares: all
thoſe evills that have come up, ſorrowes and diſeaſes,
both unto men and beaſts. Now whatſoever
is in the effect, is via eminentiae in the cauſe.
Surely therefore it is to the ſoule of man (the
miſerable veſſell and ſubject of it) all that, which
poyſon, death, and ſickneſſe is unto the other
creatures, and to the body; and in that, it is all

theſe to the ſoule, it is therefore more than all
theſe to it: for corruptio optimi peſsima: by how
much the ſoule exceeds all other creatures, by ſo
much muſt ſinne, which is the corruption, poyſon,
death, and ſickneſſe of it, exceed all other
evills.
                  But yet this is the leaſt ill that can be ſaid of it.
There is 2. ſome further tranſcendent peculiar
miſchiefe in it, that is not to be found in all other
evills, as will appeare in many inſtances.
                  For firſt, all other evills God proclaimes himſelfe
the author of, and ownes them all; though
ſinne be the meritorious cauſe of all, yet God the
efficient and diſpoſing cauſe. There is no evill in
the City but I have done it. He onely diſclaimeth
this, Iam. 1. 13. as a baſtard of ſome others breeding,
for he is the Father of lights, ver. 17.
                  Secondly, the utmoſt extremity of the evill of
puniſhment God the Sonne under-went, had a
cup mingled him of his Father, more bitter than
if all the evils in the world had beene ſtrained in,
and he dranke it off heartily to the bottome; but
not a drop of ſinne, though ſweetned with the
offer of all the world, would goe downe with
him.
                  Thirdly, other evils the Saints have choſen
and imbraced as good, and refuſed the greateſt
good things the world had, as evill, when they
came in competition with ſinne. So Moſes thoſe
rather to ſuffer, much rather than to enjoy the pleaſures
of ſinne, Heb. 11. from 24. to 28. So Chryſoſtome,
when Eudoxia the Empreſſe threatned

him: goe tell her, ſayes he, Nil niſi peccatum timeo,
I feare nothing but ſinne.
                  Fourthly, take the Devill himſelfe, whom you
all conceive to be more full of miſchiefe than all
the evills in the world, called therefore in the abſtract
ſpirituall wickedneſſe, Eph. 6. 12. yet it was
but ſinne that firſt ſpoiled him, and it is ſinne poſſeſſeth
the very devils: he was a glorious Angell,
till he was acquainted with it: and could there
be a ſeparation made betweene him and ſinne,
he would be againe of as good, ſweet, and amiable
a nature, as any creature in earth or heaven.
                  Fiftly, Though other things are evill, yet nothing
makes the creature accurſed but ſinne: as
all good things in the world doe not make a man
a bleſſed man, ſo nor all the evills accurſed. God
ſayes not, bleſſed are the honorable, and the rich,
nor that accurſed are the poore: but curſed is the
man that continues not in all things, Gal. 3. 10. a
curſe to the leaſt ſinne; and on the contrary, bleſſed
is the man whoſe iniquities are forgiven, &amp;c.
Rom. 4. 7.
                  Sixtly, God hates nothing but ſinne. Were all
evills ſwept downe into one man, God hates him
not ſimply for them, not becauſe thou art poore
and diſgraced, but onely becauſe ſinfull. It is ſin
he hates, Rev. 2. 15. Iſa. 27. 11. yea it alone: and
whereas other attributes are diverſely communicated
in their effects to ſeverall things: as his
love and goodneſſe, Himſelfe, his Sonne, his
children, have all a ſhare in: yet all the hatred
(which is as large as his love) is ſolely poured

out upon, and wholly, and limited onely unto
ſinne.
                  All the queſtion will be what tranſcendencie
of evill is in the eſſence of it, that makes it above
all other evills, and hated, and it onely by God,
Chriſt, the Saints, &amp;c. more than any other
evill.
                  Why? It is enmity with God, Rom. 8. 7. abſtracts
we know ſpeake eſſences: the meaning is,
it is as directly contrary to God, as any thing
could be: for contrary it is to God, and all that
is his.
                  As 1. contrary to his eſſence, to his exiſtence,
and being God: for it makes men hate him, Rom.
1. 30. and as he that hateth his brother is a murtherer,
1 Ioh. 3. 15. ſo hee that hateth God may be
ſaid to be a murtherer of him, and wiſheth that he
were not. Peccutum eſt Dei-cidium.
                  
                  2. Contrary it is to all his attributes which
are his name: men are jealous of their names:
Gods name is himſelfe; as 1. It makes a man
ſlight Gods goodneſſe, and to ſeeke happineſſe
in the creature, as if hee were able to be happy
without him. And 2. it depoſeth his ſoveraignty,
and ſets up other Gods before his face. 3. It
contemns his truth, power, and juſtice. And 4.
turnes his grace into wantonneſſe.
                  And as to himſelfe, ſo to what ever is his, or
deare to him. Beſides, A King hath 3. things in
an eſpeciall manner deare to him: His Lawes,
His favour ites, his image ſtampt upon his coine:
and ſo hath God.
                  
                     
Firſt, his lawes and ordinances: God never
gave Law, but it hath beene broken by ſinne;

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      is the definition of it, The transgreſsion of
the Law, 1 Ioh. 3. 4. yea it is called deſtroying the
Law, Pſal. 119. 126. And know, that Gods
Law, the leaſt tittle of it, is more deare to him,
than all the world. For ere the leaſt tittle of it
ſhall be broken, heaven and earth ſhall paſſe.
The leaſt ſinne therefore, which is a breach of
the leaſt law, is worſe than the deſtruction of the
world: and for his worſhip, (as envying God
ſhould have any,) it turns his ordinances into
ſinne.
                  Secondly, for his favourites: God hath but a
few poore ones; upon whom becauſe God hath
ſet his love, ſinne hath ſet its hatred.
                  Laſtly, for his image even in a mans owne
breaſt: the law of the members fights againſt the
law of the mind, and endevoureth to expell it,
though a man ſhould be damned for it. Gal. 5. 17.
The fleſh (namely ſinne) luſteth againſt the Spirit,
for they are contraries. Contrary indeed; for me
thinkes though it hates that image in others, that
yet it ſhould ſpare it in a mans ſelfe, out of ſelf-love;
but yet, though a man ſhould be damned,
if this image be expelled, it yet laboureth to doe
this; ſo deadly is that hatred, a man hates himſelfe,
as holy, ſo farre as he is ſinfull.
                  It abounds now ſo high, as our thoughts can
follow it no farther: Divines ſay, it aſpires unto
infinity, the object againſt whom it is thus contrary
unto, being God, who is infinite, they tell

us, that objectively, ſinne it ſelfe is infinite. Sure I
am, the worth of the object or party offended,
aggravates the offence: an ill word againſt the
King is high treaſon, not the greateſt indignity to
another man. Sure I alſo am, that God was ſo
offended with it, as, though he loves his Sonne
as himſelfe, yet he (though without ſinne) being
but made ſinne by imputation, yet God ſpared him
not: and becauſe the creatures could not ſtrike a
ſtroake hard enough, he himſelfe was pleaſed to
bruiſe him, Eſay 53. 16. He ſpared not his owne
Sonne, Rom. 8. 32. His love might have overcome
him, to have paſſed by it to his Sonne; at
leaſt a word of his mouth might have pacified
him: yet ſo great was his hatred of it, and offence
at it, as he powred the vialls of his wrath on him:
Neither would entreaty ſerve, for though he cryed
with ſtrong cryes it ſhould paſſe from him, God
would not, till he had out-wraſtled it.
                  And as the perſon offended, aggravates the
offence, as before, ſo alſo the perſon ſuffering,
being God and man, argues the abounding ſinfulneſſe
of it. For, for what crime did you ever hear
a King was put to death? their perſons being
eſteemed in worth above all crime, as civill.
Chriſt was the King of Kings.
                  
                  And yet there is one conſideration more to
make the meaſure of its iniquity fully full, and
to abound to flowing over, and that is this,
that the leaſt ſinne virtually more or leſſe containes
all ſinne in the nature of it (I meane not
that all are equall, therefore I adde more or leſſe)

and I prove it thus: becauſe Adam by one offence
contracted the ſtaine of all, no ſooner did one
ſinne ſeaze upon his heart, but he had all ſinnes
in him.
                  And ſo every ſinne in us by a miraculous multiplication
inclines our nature more to every ſinne
than it was before: it makes the pollution of nature
of a deeper dye; not onely to that ſpecies of
ſinne, whereof it is the proper individuall act, but
to all elſe: as bring one candle into a roome, the
light ſpreads all over; and then another, the
light is all over more increaſed: So it is in ſinne;
for the leaſt cuts the ſoule off from God, and
then it is ready to goe a whoring after every vanity
that will entice it, or entertaine it.
                  And this ſhewes the fulneſſe of the evill of it,
in that it containes not onely all other evills in the
world in it, but alſo all of its owne kinde. As you
would count that a ſtrange poyſon, the leaſt drop
of which containes the force of all poyſon in it:
That a ſtrange diſeaſe, the leaſt infection whereof
brought the body ſubject to all diſeaſes: yet
ſuch an one is ſinne, the leaſt making the ſoule
more prone and ſubject to all.
                  And now you ſee it is a perfect evill; and
though indeed it cannot be ſaid to be the chiefeſt
in that full ſenſe wherein God is ſaid to be the
chiefeſt good; becauſe if it were as bad as God
is good, how could he pardon it, ſubdue it, bring
it to nothing as he doth? and then how could it
have addition to it, one ſin being more ſinfull than
another? Ezek. 8. 15. Iohn 19. 11. But yet it

hath ſome analogie of being the chiefeſt evill, as
God the chiefeſt good.
                  For 1. as God is the chiefeſt good, who therefore
is to be loved for himſelfe, and other things
but for his ſake; ſo alſo in ſin the chiefeſt evill,
becauſe it is ſimply to be avoided for its ſelfe; but
other evills become good, yea deſirable when
compared with it.
                  Secondly, as God is the chiefeſt good, becauſe
he is the greateſt happineſſe to himſelfe; ſo ſin,
the greateſt evill to it ſelfe: for there can be no
worſe puniſhment of it,Rom. 1. than its ſelfe; therefore
when God would give a man over, as an enemie
he meanes never to deale withall more, he gives
him up to ſinne.
                  And thirdly, it is ſo evill, as it cannot have a
worſe Epithete given it, than it ſelfe; and therefore
the Apoſtle, when he would ſpek his worſt
of it, and wind up his expreſſion highteſt, uſque ad
hyperbolem, calls it by its own name, ſinfull ſinne,

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Rom. 7. 13. that as in God being
the greateſt good, quicquid eſt in Deo eſt Deus ipſe,
therefore his attributes and names are but himſelfe,
idem praedicatur de ſeipſo: ſo it is with ſinne,
quicquid eſt in peccato, peccatum eſt, &amp;c. he can call
it no worſe than by its owne name, ſinfull ſinne.
                  
                  
                     
                     USE.
                     AND what have I beene ſpeaking of all this
while? Why? but of one ſinne in the generall
nature of it. There is not a man here, but
hath millions of them; as many as the ſands upon
the Sea ſhore; yea, as there would be Atomes,
were all the world pounded to duſt, it exceeds
in number alſo; and therefore ere we goe
any further, let all our thoughts break off here in
wonderment at the abounding of ſinne, above all
things elſe; for other things, if they be great,
they are but a few; if many, they are but ſmall:
the world, tis a big one indeed, but yet there is
but one; the ſands, though innumerable, yet
they are but ſmall; your ſinfulneſſe exceeds in

                           •
                        oth.
                     And next, let all our thoughts be wound up to
the moſt deepe and intenſe conſideration of our
eſtates; for if one ſin abounds thus, what tongue
can expreſſe, or heart can conceive their miſery,
who to uſe the Apoſtles phraſe, 1 Cor. 15. are yet
in their ſinnes? that is, ſtand bound to God in
their owne ſingle bond onely, to anſwer for all
their ſinnes themſelves; and cannot, in the eſtate
wherein yet they ſtand of impenitencie and unbeleefe,
plead the benefit of Chriſts death, to
take off and eaſe them of the guilt of one ſinne,
but, all their ſinnes are yet all their owne, which

to a man in Chriſt they are not; for his owne
bonds are cancelled, and given in, and Chriſt entred
into bonds for him, and all his ſins tranſlated
upon him.
                     Now for a proper character of their eſtate, and
ſutable to this expreſſion:
                     Firſt then a mans ſinnes may be ſaid to be ſtill
his owne: when he committeth ſinne, out of his
owne, that is the full frame and inclination of his
heart. Thus the devill is ſaid to ſinne, Ioh. 8. 44.

                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         
                        out of his owne; the whole frame of his
ſpirit is in it; which a man in Chriſt cannot be ſo
fully ſaid to doe, for hee hath a new creature in
him that ſinneth not, 1 Ioh. 3. 1, 9. that can ſay even
when he ſins, It is not I, but ſinne.
                     
                     And ſecondly, then ſinne is a mans owne, when
he hates it not, but loves it: The world loves his
owne, ſaith Chriſt, Ioh. 15. 29. and ſo doth a wicked
man his ſinne, more than any good; which is
Davids character, Pſal. 52. 3.
                     And thirdly, what is a mans owne, he nouriſheth
and cheriſheth; therefore Eph. 5. 19. No
man hates his owne fleſh, but loveth it, and cheriſheth
it: ſo doe men their ſinnes, when they are
their owne. Thoſe great and rich oppreſſors,
Iam. 5. 5. are ſaid to nouriſh their hearts in wantonnes,
and in pleaſure, as in a day of ſlaughter; as
living upon the creame of ſinning, and having
ſuch plenty, they pick out none but the ſweeteſt
bits to nouriſh their hearts withall.
                     4. So what a man provides for, that is his own;
ſo ſayes the Apoſtle, A man that provides not for

his owne, is worſe, &amp;c. When therefore men make
proviſion for the fleſh, as the phraſe is, Rom. 13. 14.
have their Caterers and contrivers of their luſts,
and whoſe chiefeſt care is every morning, what
pleaſures of ſinne they have that day to be enjoyed,
it is a ſigne that their ſins are their owne.
                     In a word, when men live in ſinne, 'tis the expreſſion
uſed, 1 Tim. 5. 6. She that lives in pleaſure,
is dead while ſhe lives. When the revenewes
of the comfort of mens lives come in, from the
pleaſures of ſinne, and that ſupplies them with
all thoſe neceſſaries that belong to life; as when
'tis their element they drink in like water; their
meat, they eate the bread of wickedneſſe, Prov. 1. 7.
and it goes downe, and troubleth them not; their
ſleepe alſo, they cannot ſleepe till they have done or
contrived ſome miſchiefe, ver. 16. their apparell,
as when violence and oppreſsion covers them as
a garment, and pride compaſſeth them as a chaine,
Pſal. 73. their recreation alſo, It is a paſtime for
a foole to doe wickedly, he makes ſport and brags
of it, Prov. 10. 23. yea their health, being ſick
and diſcontented, when their luſts are not ſatisfied,
as Ahab was for Naboths vineyard; Amnon
grew leane, when hee could not enjoy his Paramore.
                     All theſe, as they live in their ſins here, and ſo
are dead whileſt they live, and ſo are miſerable,
making the greateſt evill their chiefeſt good; ſo
when they come to die (as we all muſt doe one
day) and how ſoone, and how ſuddenly we know
not; wee carry our ſoules, our precious ſoules,

as precious water in a brittle glaſſe, ſoone cracked,2 Sam. 14. 14.
and then we are ſpilt like water, which none
can gather up againe; or but as a candle in a paper
lanthorne; in clay walls, full of cranyes, often
but a little cold comes in, and blowes the candle
out;) and then, without a through change of
heart before, wrought from all ſinne, to all
godlineſſe, they will die in their ſinnes. And all,
and the utmoſt of all miſeries is ſpoken in that
one word: and therefore Chriſt, when he would
ſumme up all miſeries in one expreſſion, tells the
Phariſees they ſhould die in their ſins, Iohn 8. 28.
                  
                  
                     Vſe 2.
                     ANd let us conſider further, that if ſin be thus
above meaſure ſinfull, that Hell that followeth
death, is then likewiſe above meaſure fearful. And
ſo it is intimated to be a puniſhment without meaſure,
Ier. 30. 11. compared with Iſa. 27. Puniſh
them as I puniſh thee (ſayes God to his owne) but
I will puniſh thee in meaſure. And indeed, ſinne being
committed againſt God the King of Kings, it
can never be puniſhed enough. But as the killing
of a King, is amongſt men a crime ſo hainous, that
no tortures can exceed the deſert of it: we uſe to
ſay, all torments are too little, any death too good
for ſuch a crime. Now peccatum eſt Dei 
                              〈◊…〉
                           
                        
as I ſaid before, a deſtroying God as much as in
us lies: and therefore none but God himſelfe can
give it a full puniſhment: therefore it is called a
falling into Gods hands, Heb. 10. 31. which, as he

ſayes there,Iſa. 40. is fearfull. For if his breath blowes
us to deſtruction, Iob 4. 9. for we are but duſt heaps;
yea, his nod, he nods to deſtruction, Pſal. 80. 16.
then what is the weight of his hands, even of
thoſe hands, which ſpan the heavens, and hold the
earth in the hollow of them? and if God take it into
his hands to puniſh, he will be ſure to doe unto
the full. Sinne is mans worke, and puniſhment is
Gods, and God will ſhew himſelfe as perfect in his
worke, as man in his.
                     
                     If ſinne be malum catholicum, as hath been ſaid,
that containes all evils in it; then the puniſhment
God will inflict ſhall be malum catholicum alſo,
containing in it all miſeries; it is a cup full of mixture,
ſo called Pſal. 75. 8. as into which God hath
ſtrained the quinteſſence of all miſeries, and the
wicked of the earth muſt drink the dregges of it,
though it be eternity unto the bottome. And if
one ſin deſerves a hell, a puniſhment above meaſure,
what will millions of millions doe? And
we reade that every ſinne ſhall receive a juſt recompence,
Heb. 2. 3. oh let us then take heed of dying
in our ſinnes, and therefore of living in them; for
we ſhall lie in priſon till we have paid the very
utmoſt farthing.
                     And therefore if all this that I have ſaid of it wil
not engender anſwerable apprehenſions of it in
you, (this being but painting the toad, which you
can look upon and handle without affrightment)
I wiſh that if without danger you could but lay
your eares to hell, that ſtanding as it were behind
the ſkreene, you might heare ſinne ſpoken of in

its owne dialect by the oldeſt ſonnes of perdition
there, to heare what Cain ſayes of murthering
his brother Abel; what Saul of his perſecuting
David, and the Prieſts of Iehovah; what Balaam
and Achitophel ſay of their curſed counſels and
policies; what Ahab ſayes of his oppreſſion of
Naboth; what Iudas of treaſon; and heare what
expreſſions they have, with what horrors, yellings,
groanes, diſtractions, the leaſt ſin is there
ſpoken of. If God ſhould take any mans ſoule
here, and as he rapt His, into the third heavens,
where he ſaw grace in its fulleſt brightneſſe; ſo
carry any ones ſoule into thoſe chambers of death,
as Solomon calls them, and leading him through
all, from chamber to chamber, ſhew him the viſions
of darkneſſe, and hee there heare all thoſe
bedlames cry out, one of this ſinne, another of
that, and ſee ſinne as it lookes in hell! But there
is one aggravation more of the evill and miſery
ſinne brings upon men, I have not ſpoken of yet,
that it blinds their eyes, and hardens their hearts,
that they doe not ſee, nor lament their miſery, till
they be in hell; and then it is too late.
                  
                  
                     Vſe 3.
                     BUt what, doth ſin ſo exceed in ſinfulneſſe, and
is the venome of it boyled up to ſuch a height
of miſchiefe, that there ſhould be no name in heaven
and earth able to grapple with it, and deſtroy
it? Is there no antidote, no balme in Gilead more
ſoveraigne, than it is deadly? Surely yes, God

would never have ſuffered ſo potent and malicious
an enemy to have ſet foot in his dominions,
but that he knew how to conquer it, and that not
by puniſhing of it onely in hell, but by deſtroying
it: onely it is too potent for all the creatures
to encounter with. This victory is alone reſerved
for Chriſt, it can die by no other hand, that
he may have the glory of it; which therefore is
the top of his glory, as mediator, and his higheſt
title, the memory of which he beares written in
his name JESUS, for he ſhall ſave his people from
their ſinnes, Mat. 1. 21. And therefore the Apoſtle
Paul, his chiefeſt Herauld, proclaimes this
victory with a world of ſolemnity and triumph,
1 Cor. 15. 36. Oh death, where is thy ſting? oh
grave, where is thy victory? the ſting of death is
ſinne, the ſtrength of ſinne is the Law: but thankes
be to God that gives us the victory through our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt: which yet again addes to the Demonſtration
of the ſinfulneſſe of it: for the ſtrength
of ſinne was ſuch, that like Goliah it would have
defied the whole hoſt of heaven and earth. It was
not poſsible the blood of Bulls and goats ſhould take
away ſinne, Heb. 10. 4. nor would the riches of the
world, or the blood of men have beene a ſufficient
ranſome: Will the Lord be pleaſed with rivers
of oyle? ſhall I give my firſt borne for my tranſgreſſion?
No, ſayes he, there is no proportion, for
thy firſt borne is but the fruit of thy body, and
ſinne is the ſinne of thy ſoule, Mich. 6. 7. it muſt
coſt more to redeeme a ſoule than ſo, Pſal. 49. 9.
No, couldeſt thou bring rivers of teares, in ſtead

of rivers of oyle; which if any thing, were like to
pacifie God, yet are they but the excrements of
thy braines; but ſinne is the ſinne of thy heart:
yea all the righteouſneſſe that we could ever do,
cannot make amends for one ſinne: for ſuppoſe
it perfect, when as yet it is but dung. Mal. 2. 3.
and a menſtruom cloath, yet thou oweſt it already
as thou art a creature; and one debt cannot pay
another. If then we ſhould goe a begging to all
the Angels, who never ſinned, let them lay all
their ſtock together, it would begger them all
to pay for one ſinne: no, it is not the merit of Angels
will doe it; for ſinne is the tranſgreſſion, the
deſtruction of the Law, Pſal. 109. 1. and the leaſt

                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         is more worth than heaven, and all that is
therein.
                     Onely, though it be thus unconquerably ſinfull
by all created powers, it hath not gone beyond
the price that Chriſt hath paid for it; the
Apoſtle compares to this very purpoſe, ſinne and
Chriſts righteouſneſſe together, Rom. 5. 15, 20. 'Tis
true, ſayes hee, that ſinne abounds, and that one
ſinne, 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , and inſtanceth in Adams ſinne,
which ſtaineth all mens natures to the end of the
world; yet ſayes he, the gift of righteouſneſſe by
Chriſt abounds much more; abounds to flowing
over, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , ſayes the Apoſtle, 1 Tim. 1. 14.
as the ſea doth above mote-hills, Malach. 7. 14.
Though therefore it would undoe all the Angels,
yet Chriſts riches are unſearchable, Eph. 3. 8. hee
hath ſuch riches of merit, as are able to pay all
thy debts the very firſt day of thy mariage with

him, though thou hadſt beene a ſinner millions
of yeares, afore the creation to this day: and
when that is done, there is enough left to purchaſe
thee more grace and glory than all the Angels
have in heaven. In a word, he is able to ſave
to the utmoſt, all that come to God by him, Heb. 7. 5.
let their ſins be what they will.
                     But then wee muſt come to him, and to God by
him, and take him as our Lord, and King, and
head, and husband, as he is freely tendered, we
muſt be made one with him, and have our hearts
divorced from all our ſinnes for ever. And why
not now? doe we yet look for another Chriſt?
and to allude to us, as Naomi ſaid to Ruth, Is there
yet any more ſonnes in my wombe, that they
may be your husbands? So ſay I, Hath God any
more ſuch ſonnes? or is not this Chriſt good enough?
or are we afraid of being happy too ſoon,
in being married to him?
                     But yet if we will have Chriſt indeed (without
whom we are undone) how ſhall we thou continue
in ſinne,
                        Rom. 6. which is thus above meaſure ſinfull? no
not in one. The Apoſtle ſpeaks there in the language
of impoſſibility and inconſiſtencie. Chriſt,
and the raigne of one ſinne, they cannot ſtand together.
                     And indeed, wee will not ſo much as take
Chriſt, untill firſt wee have ſeene more or leſſe
this viſſion here, and ſinne appear to us, as to him,
above meaſure ſinfull: naturally we ſlight it and
make a mock of, and account it preciſeneſſe to
ſtick and make conſcience of it: but if once ſinne

                        
                           〈1 page duplicate〉
                        
                        
                        
                           〈1 page duplicate〉
                        
                        
thus appeares to any but in its owne colours, that
man will looke upon the leaſt ſinne then, as upon
hell it ſelfe; and like a man affrighted, feare in
all his wayes, leſt he ſhould meet with ſinne, and
ſtarts at the very appearance of it; he weepes if
ſinne doe but ſee him, and hee doe but ſee it in
himſelfe and others; and cryes out as Ioſeph did,
How ſhall I doe this, and ſinne? and then a man will
make out for Chriſt, as a condemned man for
life, as a man that can no longer live, oh give me
Chriſt, or elſe I die; and then if upon this Chriſt
appeares to him, and manifeſts himſelfe, as his promiſe
is to thē that ſeek him, Ioh. 14. 21. his heart
thereupon will much more deteſt and loathe it:
he ſaw it evill afore, Out then it comes to have a
new tincture added, which makes it infinitely
more ſinfull in his eyes; for he then lookes upon
every ſinne as guilty of Chriſts bloud, as dyed
with it, though covered by it; the grace of God appearing,
teacheth us to deny all ungodlineſſe and
worldly luſts. The love of Chriſt conſtraines him.
Thinkes he, Shall I live in that for which Chriſt
died? ſhall that be my life, which was his death?
did he that never knew ſinne, undergoe the torment
for it, and ſhall I be ſo unkinde as to enjoy
the pleaſure of it? No, but as David when hee
was very thirſtie, and had water of the well of
Bethleem brought him, with the hazard of mens
lives, powred it on the ground; for ſayes hee, It
is the blood of theſe men: So ſayes he, even when
the cup of pleaſures is at his very lips, It coſt the
blood of Chriſt, and ſo pours it upon the ground.

And as the love of Chriſt conſtraines him, ſo the
power of Chriſt doth change him. Kings may
pardon Traytors, but they cannot change their
hearts; but Chriſt pardons none, hee doth not
make new creatures, and all old things paſſe away,
becauſe he makes them friends, favourites to live
with, and delight in; and if men put on Chriſt, and
have learned him, as the truth is in Ieſus, they put
off as concerning the former converſation the old
man, with the deceitfull luſts; and he ceaſeth from
ſinne, that is, from the courſe of any knowne ſin:
they are the Apoſtles owne words,1 Pet. 5. 
                              〈◊◊〉
                           
                         which ſhall
judge us; and if we ſhould expect ſalvation from
him upon any other termes, we are deceived; for
Chriſt is author of ſalvation to them onely that obey
him, Heb. 5. 9.

                  Contents of Aggravation of
ſinning againſt knowledge.
                  
                     Doct. TO ſinne againſt knowledge is the higheſt
aggravation of ſinning. page 34
                     1. Demonſtrations of the point, by comparing it with
other kinds of ſinning. 36
                     How much ſins againſt knowledge doe tranſcend ſins
of ignorance. 37
                     1. In ſins of ignorance there may be a ſuppoſition, if
he had known it, he would not have done it: but
not ſo in theſe. ibid.
                     
                     2. The vaſt difference between them appears in the
repentance God accepts for each: a generall repentance
for the one, not ſo for the other. 39
                     3. Some kinds of ſinning againſt knowledge exclude
from mercy, which done ignorantly, leave a capacity
of it. 40
                     4. Sinning againſt knowledge is the higheſt, but that
of ſinning againſt the holy Ghoſt. 41
                     6. Reaſons.

                           1. Becauſe knowledge is the greateſt mercy. 42
                           2. Knowledge is the immediate guide of men in all
their waies: a man ſins againſt his guide. 43
                           That knowledge is ſo proved, in that an erroneous
conſcience binds. 45
                           3. Reaſon: Knowledge layeth a further obligation
to obedience. ibid.
                           
                           Lawes come in force when promulged. 46
                           4. There is the more contempt caſt on the law. 47
                           5. In ſins againſt knowledge the will of the ſinner
cloſeth more with ſin, as ſin. ibid.
                           
                           
                              
6. In ſinning againſt knowledge, a man condemnes
himſelfe. 48

                                 1. Diſtinction, To ſinne with knowledge and
againſt knowledge doe differ. ibid.
                                 
                                 A regenerate man guilty of more ſins knowne
than another. ibid.
                                 
                                 Yet not of more ſins againſt knowledge. 50
                                 2. Diſtinction. Men ſin againſt knowledge either
objectively or circumſtantially only. 51
                                       1. What it is to ſinne directly againſt knowledge.

                                       2. What to ſinne againſt knowledge circumſtantially
onely. ibid.

might preſerve them from ſinning. 53

                  AGGRAVATIONS
OF SINNING
AGAINST KNOWLEDGE.
                  
                     ROM. 1. 21.
                     Becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him
not as God, neither were thankfull, but became
vaine in their imaginations, and their fooliſh
heart was darkned.
                  
                  
                     
                        THere are two generall aggravations
the Apoſtle inſiſts
on, in theſe two Chapters, of
the Gentiles ſinfulneſſe: Firſt
their unthankfulneſſe, ver. 21.
in deſpiſing the riches of Gods
goodneſſe, Chap. 2. 4. Secondly,
of Rebellion, in ſinning againſt knowledge: That
when they knew him, they glorified him not as God.
And of all other hee inculcateth this of ſinning
againſt knowledge, as the greateſt: for bringing

in a long, large, and particular indictment of many
ſeverall ſinnes, Idolatry, ver. 23. unnaturall uncleanneſſe,
ver. 26. &amp;c. and all kinds of unrighteouſneſſe,
ver. 29. hee doth both in the beginning,
and end of the bill, bring in this aggravation, that
they ſinned againſt knowledge in all theſe. So
ver. 18. he begins the indictment and promulgation
of Gods wrath above all for this, that they
with-held the truth in unrighteouſneſſe; which
was as much as all that unrighteouſneſſe committed,
barely in it ſelfe conſidered: And then again
in the end, when hee comes to pronounce ſentence,
he comes in with this, after all particulars
had beene reckoned up, Who knowing the judgement
of God againſt thoſe which doe ſuch things, yet
doe them.
                     
                     So that this Doctrine is cleare from hence,Doct.
That to ſinne againſt knowledge,
                        To ſin againſt knowledge is the higheſt aggravation of ſinning. either in omitting
good duties which we know we ought to performe,
or committing of ſinnes we know wee
ought not to doe, is the higheſt aggravation of
ſinfulneſſe.
                     I put both in both ſinnes of omiſſion and commiſſion:
for ſo the particular ſinnes the Gentiles
are taxed for here, are of both ſorts; as not glorifying,
or worſhipping God, as well as turning his
glory into a lye, &amp;c. to omit prayer, when your
conſciences tell you, you ought to doe it: to omit
holy diſcourſe, examining the heart, when you
know you ought to doe them, are as well ſinnes
againſt knowledge, as to tell a lie againſt your
knowledge, or as to ſteale and forſweare, or

murder, or be drunke, &amp;c.
                     Now when I ſay, it is an aggravation to theſe
ſinnes, my meaning is this: That take any ſinne
thou thinkeſt moſt groſſe, and view it barely in
the act of it, put the act nakedly in the one ſcale,
be it a ſinne of uncleanneſſe, or drunkenneſſe;
and then put this circumſtance which was added
to it in the other ſcale, that before and when
thou diddeſt it, thou kneweſt it to be a ſinne, this
alone weighs as much, yea more than the ſinne it
ſelfe doth: that as it is ſaid of Herod, that he added
this to all his other ſinnes, that he caſt Iohn in
priſon, who told him of his Herodias, and ſo is
made as much as all his former ſinnes: ſo is this
brought in here, that in and unto all their unrighteouſneſſe,
this was added, they with-held the
truth, the light of their conſciences (which is as
a Prophet from God) they did impriſon in unrighteouſneſſe,
ver. 18. And therefore when Daniel
would convince Balſhazzar of his deſervedneſſe
to loſe his Kingdome, and that he was not
able to hold weight in the ballance, Dan. 5. 22.
what puts he into the other ſcale againſt him to
weigh him up, and to ſhew he was too light, ver.
21, 22? he tells him how his father knew the God
of heaven, and how that his knowledge coſt him
ſeven yeares the learning among wild beaſts, and
thou (ſayes he) his ſonne kneweſt all this, and yet
didſt not humble thy ſelfe. Here is the aggravation
weighs downe all: he knew the God of heaven
againſt whom he ſinned, and that judgement on
his Father for his pride; and then withall he tels

him, that this God, in whoſe hands is thy breath, and
all thy wayes, thou haſt not glorified. I name this
place among many others, becauſe it is parallel
with this in the text. Ile name no more, but give
reaſons and demonſtrations for it.
                     
                        
                            Firſt, Demonſtrations.
                        
                        The greatneſſe of this kind of ſinning might
many wayes be made appeare;Demonſtratiōs of the point, by comparing it vvith other kinds of ſinning. we will demonſtrate
it onely by comparing it with other kinds
of ſinning.
                        To ſinne, though out of ſimple ignorance, when
that ignorance is but the cauſa ſine qua non of ſinning,
that is, ſo as if a man had knowne it a ſinne,
he had not done it, doth not yet make the fact not
to be a ſinne, though it leſſeneth it. For Luke 12.
48. He that did not know his Maſters will, was beaten,
when the thing committed was worthy of
ſtripes, though he did not know ſo much, becauſe
the thing deſerves it. And the reaſon is, becauſe
the Law being once promulged, as 1. to Adam
it was, and put into his heart, as the common ark
of mankinde; though the tables be loſt, yet our
ignorance doth not make the Law of none effect.
For the Law of nature for ever binds, that is, all
that was written in Adams heart, becauſe it was
thereby then publiſhed in him, and to him for us.
But poſitive lawes, as I may call them, as to beleeve
in Chriſt, &amp;c. anew delivered, bind not, but
where they are publiſht. Ioſiah rent his clothes,
when the booke of the Law was found, becauſe
the ordinances were not kept, although they had
not knowne the Law of many yeares; yet becauſe

they ought to have knowne it, therefore for all
their ignorance, he feared wrath would come upon
all Iſrael. So alſo Lev. 5. 17. ſinnes of ignorance
were to be ſacrificed for: yet however, it
leſſeneth the ſin, therefore he ſhall be beaten with
few ſtripes.
                        
                        And ſure, if ignorance leſſeneth them, knowledge
aggravates; for contrariorum eadem eſt ratio:
therefore he that knowes, ſhall be beaten with
many ſtripes. Yea ſuch difference is there, that
God is ſaid to wink at ſins of ignorance. Acts 17.
30. The time of this ignorance God winks at. Whiles
they had no knowledge, God tooke no notice:
yea and he abates ſomething for ſuch ſinnes, becauſe
the creature hath a cloake, hath ſomething
to ſay for its ſelfe; (as Chriſt ſayes, Iohn 15. 22.)
but when againſt knowledge, they have no cloak.
Yea farther, Chriſt makes a ſinne of ignorance to
be no ſinne, in compariſon: So there, If I had not
ſpoken and done thoſe workes never man did, they
had had [no ſinne.] (That is) none in compariſon,
but now they have no cloak,
                           How much ſinnes againſt knowledge doe tranſcend ſins of ignorance. no ſhelter to award
the ſtripes, or plea to abate of them.
                        And that you may ſee the ground of this vaſt
difference betweene ſinnes of ignorance, and againſt
knowledge,In ſins of ignorance there may be a ſuppoſition, if he had known it, he would not have done it: but not ſo in theſe. conſider firſt, that if a man ſin 
(ſuppoſe the act the ſame) out of ignorance meerly,
there may be a ſuppoſition, that if hee had
knowne it, he would not have done it; and that
as ſoone as he doth know it, he would or might
repent of it. So 1 Cor. 2. 8. If they had knowne,
they had not crucified the Lord of Glory. The like

ſayes Chriſt of Tyre, Sidon, and Gomorrha, that if
the ſame things had beene done in them, they would
have repented. But now when a man knowes it
afore, and alſo conſiders it in the very committing
it, and yet doth it, then there is no roome for
ſuch a ſuppoſition, and leſſe hope. For what
is it that ſhould reduce this man to repentance?
is it not his knowledge? now if that had no power
to keepe him from his ſinne, then it may be
judged, that it will not be of force to bring him to
repentance for it; for by ſinning the heart is
made more hard, and the knowledge and the authority
of it weakned and leſſened, as all power
is, when contemned and reſiſted, Rom. 1. 21. their
fooliſh heart becomes darker. Ariſtotle himſelfe
hath a touch of this notion in the third of his
Ethicks, that if a man ſinne out of ignorance, when
he knowes it, he repents of it; if out of paſsion,
when the paſſion is over, he is ſorry for what he
hath done: but when a man ſinnes deliberately,
and out of knowledge, it is a ſigne he is fixed and
ſet in miſchiefe; and therefore it is counted wickedneſſe
and malice. And hence it is, that thoſe
that have beene enlightned with the higheſt kind
of light, but that of ſaving grace, Heb. 6. 4, 5. and
Heb. 10. If they ſinne wilfully after ſuch a knowledge
of the truth, God lookes on them, as thoſe
that will never repent. And therefore likewiſe
the ſchoole gives this as the reaſon why the Devills
ſinne obſtinately, and cannot repent, becauſe
of their full knowledge they ſinne with;
they know all in the full latitude that it may be

knowne, and yet goe on.
                        Secondly, the vaſt difference that in Gods account 
is put betweene ſinnes of knowledge,
                           The vaſt difference between them, appears in the repentance God accepts for each. A generall repentance for the one, not ſo for the other. and of
ignorance, will appeare by the different reſpect
and regard that God hath to them, in the repentance
he requires and accepts for them; and that
both in the acts of repentance, and alſo in the
ſtate of grace and repentance, upon which God
accepts a man, or for want of which he rejecteth
him.
                        Firſt, when a man comes to performe the acts
of repentance, and to humble himſelfe for ſinne,
and to turne from it, God exacteth not, that ſins
of ignorance ſhould particularly be repented of.
But if they be repented of but in the general, &amp; in
the lumpe, be they never ſo great, God accepts
it. This is intimated Pſal. 19. 12. Who can underſtand
his errour? cleanſe me from my ſecret ſinnes:
that was confeſſion enough. But ſinnes of knowledge
muſt be particularly repented of, and confeſſed,
and that againe and againe, as David was
forced to doe for his murder and adultery, or a
man ſhall never have pardon. Yea farther, greater
difference will appeare, in regard of the ſtate
of grace and repentance: for a man may lye in a
ſinne he doth not know to be a ſinne, and yet be
in the ſtate of Grace, as the Patriarchs in Poligamie,
and in divorcing their wives: but to lye in a
ſinne of knowledge, is not compatible with grace:
but unleſſe a man maintaineth a conſtant fight
againſt it, hateth it, confeſſeth it, forſaketh it, hee
cannot have mercy. This cannot ſtand with uprightneſſe

of heart. A friend may keepe correſpondencie
with one, hee ſuſpects not to be an
enemy unto his friend, and be true to his friendſhip
notwithſtanding: but if hee knowes him to
be an enemie, he muſt break utterly with the one,
if he leanes to the other.
                        
                            Thirdly, yet farther in the third place, ſo vaſt
is the difference,Some kinds of ſinning againſt knowledge exclude frō mercy, which done ignorantly leave a capacity of it. that ſome kind of ſins committed
out of and againſt knowledge, utterly exclude
from mercy for time to come; which done out
of ignorance, remained capable of, and might
have obtained it; as perſecuting the Saints, blaſpheming
Chriſt, &amp;c. Pauls will was as much in
thoſe acts themſelves, and as hearty as thoſe that
ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: for he was made againſt
the Church, and in theſe ſins, as himſelfe ſayes,
not ſinning willingly herein onely, but being carried
on with fury, as hot and as forward as the
Phariſees that ſinned that ſinne: onely ſayes hee,
1 Tim. 1. 13. I did it ignorantly, therefore I obtained
mercie. Though it was ignorantly done, yet
there was need of mercie: but yet in that he did it
but ignorantly, there was a capacity and place
for mercie, which otherwiſe had not beene. But
thus to ſin after a man hath received the knowledge
of the truth, ſhuts a man out from mercie, Heb. 10.
and there is no more ſacrifice for ſinne, for ſuch ſins;
I ſay, ſuch ſins as theſe, thus directly againſt the
Goſpell, when committed with knowledge. For
ſins againſt the Law, though againſt knowledge,
there was an atonement, as appeares Levit. 6.
from the 1. verſe to the 8. where hee inſtanceth

in forſwearing: But to perſecute the Saints, and
Chriſts truth, with malice, after knowledge of it,
there is no more ſacrifice: not that ſimply the ſin is
ſo great in the act it ſelfe of perſecution, for Paul
did it out of ignorance; but becauſe it is out of
knowledge: ſo vaſt a difference doth knowledge
and ignorance put betweene the guilt of the ſame
ſinne.
                        And therefore indeed,Sinning againſt knowledge is the higheſt to ſinning againſt the holy Ghoſt. to conclude this in the 
laſt place, this is the higheſt ſtep of the ladder, next
to turning off: the very higheſt but that of ſinning
againſt the Holy Ghoſt: which muſt needs argue it
the higheſt aggravation of ſinning, when it aſcends
ſo high, when it brings a man to the brinck, and
next to falling into the bottomleſſe pit, irrecoverably.
And therefore to ſinne preſumptuouſly (which
is all one) and to ſinne againſt knowledge, (as appears
Numb. 15. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. it being there oppoſed
to ſinning out of ignorance, (ſuch a ſinne as
David did, of whom it is ſaid, 2 Sam. 12. 9. that he
deſpiſed the word of the Lord: which phraſe alſo is
uſed to expreſſe ſinnes of preſumption, ver. 31. of
that 15. of Numbers) To ſinne, I ſay, preſumptuouſly,
is the higheſt ſtep: So in Davids account,
Pſal. 19. 12, 13. For firſt he prayes, Lord keepe me
from ſecret ſinnes, (which he maketh ſinnes of ignorance)
and then next he prayes againſt preſumptuous
ſinnes, (which, as the oppoſition ſhewes, are
ſinnes againſt knowledge:) For (ſayes he) if they get
dominion over me, I ſhall not be free from [that great
offence.] That is, that unpardonable ſinne, which
ſhall never be forgiven: ſo as theſe are neereſt it

of any other: yet not ſo, as that every one that fals
into ſuch a ſinne commits it, but he is nigh to it, at
the next ſtep to it. For to commit that ſinne, but
two things are required; light in the mind, and malice
in the heart: not malice alone, unleſſe there be
light; for then that Apoſtle had ſinned it: ſo as
knowledge is the Parent of it, it is after receiving
the knowledge of the truth, Heb. 10. 27, 28.
                     
                     
                        Theſe are the Demonſtrations of it,Secondly, Reaſons, which are 6. 1. Becauſe knowledge is the greateſt 
                                 〈◊〉
                              . the
Reaſons are
                        Firſt, becauſe knowledge of God and his wayes,
is the greateſt mercie, next to ſaving grace: Hee
hath not dealt [ſo] with every Nation. Wherein?
In giving the knowledge of his wayes: and as it is
thus, ſo to a nation, ſo to a man; and therefore
Chriſt ſpeaking of the gift of knowledge, and giving
the reaſon why it ſo greatly condemneth,
Luke 12. 48. ſayes, For to whom [much] is given,
much is required. As if hee had ſaid, To know his
Maſters will, that is the great talent of all other.
There is a [much] in that. Thus it was in the
Heathens eſteeme alſo: They acknowledged their
fooliſh wiſdome in morall and naturall Philoſophie,
their greateſt excellencie: and therefore Plato
thank'd God for three things; that he was a man,
an Athenian, and a Philoſopher. And Rom. 1. 22.
the Apoſtle mentions it as that excellencie they
did profeſſe. And Soloman, of all vanities ſayes this
is the beſt vanity, and that it exceeds folly, as light
doth darkneſſe, Eccleſ. 2. But ſurely much more is
the knowledge of the Law, and of God, as we have it
revealed to us; this muſt needs be much more excellent.

And ſo the Jewes eſteemed theirs; as in
this ſecond Chapter of the Romanes, the Apoſtle
ſhewes alſo of them, that they made their boaſt of the
Law, and their forme of knowledge of it, and approving
the things that are excellent. And what doe
the two great books of the creatures, and the word,
and all meanes elſe ſerve for, but to increaſe knowledge?
If therefore all tend to this, this is then the
greateſt mercie of all the reſt.
                        For ſecondly,2. Reaſon. Knowledge is the immediate guide of men in all their wayes: A man ſins againſt his Guide. God hath appointed knowledge
as the immediate guide of men in all their wayes,
to bring them to ſalvation and repentance, for to that
it leads them. It is that ſame 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           , as the Philoſopher
call'd it: and therefore the Law, Rom. 7. 1, 2.
is compared to an Husband, (ſo farre as it is written
in, or revealed in the heart) that as an Husband is
the guide of the wife in her youth, ſo is the Law to the
heart. And whereas beaſts are ruled by a bit and
bridle, God hee rules men by knowledge. And
therefore if men be wicked, notwithſtanding this
light, they muſt needs ſinne highly, ſeeing there is
no other curbe for them, as they are men, but this:
if he will deale with them as men, this is the onely
way; and therefore if that will not doe it, it is ſuppoſed
nothing will.
                        It is knowledge makes men capable of ſin, which
beaſts are not; therefore the more knowledge, (if
men be wicked withall) the more ſinne muſt neceſſarily
be reckoned to them: ſo as God doth not
ſimply looke what mens actions and affections are,
but chiefly what their knowledge is, and accordingly
judgeth men more or leſſe wicked. I may illuſtrate

this by that compariſon, which I may allude
unto: That as in Kingdomes, God meaſures out
the wickedneſſe thereof, and ſo his puniſhments accordingly,
principally, by the guides, the governors
thereof, what they are, and what they doe;
as in the 5. of Ieremie, the 4. verſe it appeares;
where firſt God lookes upon the poore people, but,
he excuſeth them, theſe are fooliſh, and know not the
way of the Lord: and therefore God would have
beene moved to ſpare the Kingdome, notwithſtanding
their ſins. But from them at the 5. verſe
he goes to view the Rules, I will get me to the great
men, for theſe have knowne the way of the Lord: and
when he ſaw that theſe had broken the bands, then,
how ſhall I pardon thee for this? So is it in his judgement
towards a particular man: when God lookes
downe upon a man, and ſees him in his courſes exceeding
looſe, and wicked, hee lookes firſt upon
thoſe rude affections in him, which are uncleane,
profane, debaucht, greedy of all wickedneſſe; Ay
but ſayes he, theſe are fooliſh of themſelves, but
I will looke upon his underſtanding, and upon the
ſuperiour faculties, which are the guides of theſe
affections, and ſee what they dictate to theſe unruly
affections, to reſtraine them: And when he findes
that the guides themſelves are enlightned, and have
knowne the way of the Lord, and that the will and the
affections, though informed with much knowledge,
yet break all bands, then how ſhall I pardon
thee? Thee, who art a knowing drunkard, and a
knowing unclean perſon, &amp;c. ſo as thus to ſin, aggravates
and maketh ſin out of meaſure ſinfull.
                        
                        
                           
Now that knowledge and reaſon is a mans guide,
                           That knowledge is ſo, proved, in that an erroneous conſcience bindeth.
will further appeare by this: That even erroneous
knowledge doth put an obligation, a bond, and a tye
upon a man: which can be in no other reſpect, but
becauſe knowledge is appointed to be a mans
guide. Thus if a man thinkes a thing (which is in it
ſelfe common and indifferent) to be a ſinne, and forbidden,
(as Rom. 14. 4.) although the Law forbids
it not, yet to him it is uncleane, though in Chriſt it is
not uncleane, that is, by the Law of Chriſt. For,
this his knowledge and judgement of the thing
hath to him the force of a Law: for it propounds it
to him as a Law, and as from God; which reaſon of
his, God hath appointed as his immediate guide: and
the will is to follow nothing that is evill, which is
repreſented to it, as evill; this is the Law of meere
nature in all conditions; therefore if a man ſhould
doe an action which is in it ſelf good, if he thought
it to be evill, he ſhould ſinne, and ſo è contra, for he
goes againſt the dictate of nature. So that erroneous
knowledge, though againſt the Law, is a law
to me, though not per ſe, yet per accidens. Now
therefore if to go againſt a falſe light of conſcience
be yet a ſinne, though it proves that the commandement
allowes the thing was done, and was for
it, then to go againſt the true light of the Law, how
ſinfull is it?
                        Againe, thirdly, the knowledge of the law binds 
the perſon ſo much the more to obedience,Knowledg layeth a further obligation as obedience. by
how much the more he knowes it: ſo as though it
would be a ſinne, when he knowes not the Law to
tranſgreſſe it, yet when he knowes it, it is a greater

ſinne. 'Tis true indeed, that conſcience and the
Law, when they meet, make up but one Law, not
two diſtinct Laws: and therefore in ſinning againſt
knowledge, though a man doth not commit two diſtinct
ſinnes, yet the knowledge of it doth adde a
further degree of ſinfulneſſe to it: As a cloath is
the ſame cloath when it is white, that it was when
it is dyed with a ſcarlet dye; yet then it hath a dye,
a tincture given it, which is more worth than the
cloath: and ſo when you ſinne, not knowing the
Law, the ſin is the ſame for ſubſtance, it would be
if you had known it; yet that knowledge dyes it,
makes it a ſcarlet ſinne, as Eſay ſpeaks, farre greater
and deeper in demerit than the ſinne it ſelfe: and
the ground of this is,Lawes come in force when promulged. becauſe Lawes then come to be
in force, when they are promulged, and made known:
ſo as the more they are promulged and knowne, the
more is the force of their binding, and ſo the greater
guilt. Therefore Deut. 11. 12. 3. 8. God ſtraitens
the cords more, the binding force of the law
more upon thoſe Jewes conſciences, to whom he
at the firſt perſonally with majeſty had promulgated
it, than upon their children, though upon
theirs alſo. Now if all Gods Lawes, being made
knowne to Adam, binde us, and are in force, and
this when we know them not; then if we do know
them, or might know them, they binde much
more: and ſtill the more clearely wee know them,
the obligation increaſeth, and the guilt inſuing
with it: and the rather, becauſe now when wee
come to know them, they are anew promulged, in
a way of a peculiar mercie; wee having defaced

the knowledge of them in our fall.
                        Fourthly, when the Law, being knowne, is broken,
                           
there is the more contempt caſt upon the Law,
                           There is the more contempt caſt upon the Law.
and the Law-giver alſo; and ſo a higher degree
of ſinning. And therefore Numbers 15. 30. He that
ſinnes out of knowledge, is ſaid to reproach the Lord,
and to deſpiſe the word. And therefore Saul ſinning
againſt knowledge, Samuel calleth it rebellion: and
though it were but in a ſmall thing, yet he parallels
it with witchcraft. So alſo Iob 24. 13. they are ſaid
to rebell, when they ſinne againſt light; becauſe
rebellion is added to diſobedience: For knowledge
is an Officer ſet to ſee the Law executed, and
fulfilled; and makes God preſent to the conſcience.
Therefore Rom. 2. 14. it is called a witneſſe;
and therefore in ſinning againſt knowledge, men are
ſaid to ſinne before the face of the Lord himſelfe; now
what a great contempt is that? Therefore alſo
Pſal. 50. the hypocrite ſinning againſt knowledge, is
ſaid to caſt the law of God behind his back: ſo as
there is a contempt in this ſinning, which is in no
other.
                        Fiftly, the more knowledge a man ſinneth againſt, 
the more the will of the ſinner is diſcovered to be
for ſinne,
                           In ſins again
                                 •…
                               knowledge, 
                                 〈◊〉
                               will of the ſinner cloſeth more with ſin as ſin. as ſinne. Now voluntarium eſt regula &amp;
menſur a actionum moralium: willingneſſe in ſinning,
is the ſtandard and meaſure of ſinnes. The leſſe will,
the leſſe ſinne: ſo much is cut off, the leſſe the will
cloſeth with it; at leaſt wiſe ſo much is added, by
how much the will is more in it: and therefore the
higheſt degree of ſinning is expreſt to us by ſinning
willingly, and this after knowledge, Heb. 10. Now

though an ignorant man commits the act as willingly,
as when Paul perſecuted the Church, yet he
commits it not conſidered as ſinne, till he hath the
knowledge of it: but then when it is diſcovered to
be ſinne, and the more clearely it is ſo diſcovered,
the will may be ſaid to joyn with it as ſinne. Therefore
the Apoſtle ſayes, To him that knowes to doe
well, and doth it not, to him it is ſinne. Iames 4. 17.
becauſe by his knowledge the thing is repreſented
as ſinne; and ſo he cloſeth with it the more, under
that notion and apprehenſion.
                        
                            Sixtly, in ſinning againſt knowledge, a man condemns
himſelfe;
                           In ſinning againſt knowledge a man condemns himſelfe. but when out of ignorance meerely,
the Law onely doth condemne him. So Rom. 2.
1. A man having knowledge in that wherein hee
judgeth another, he condemneth himſelfe. So Rom. 14.
Now as ſelf-murder is the higheſt degree of murder,
and an aggravation of it; ſo ſelf-condemning
muſt needs be reckoned. God tooke it as a great
advantage over him that hid his talent, that out of
thine owne mouth I will condemne thee, thou wicked
ſervant.
                        
                        The doctrine being thus proved,
                              
                                 •
                              . Things handled concerning ſins againſt knowledge. Firſt, I will explaine,
what it is to ſin againſt knowledge.
                        
                        Secondly, I will give the aggravations of it.
                        Thirdly, I will give rules to meaſure ſinnes of
knowledge by, and the greatneſſe of them in any
act.
                        Laſtly, the uſe of all.
                        For the firſt, what it is to ſinne againſt knowledge.
Firſt, to explaine it, I premiſe theſe diſtinctions.
                        
                           
The firſt diſtinction.1. What it is 
                                 〈◊〉
                               ſinne gainſt knowledge, explained. That it is one thing to
ſinne with knowledge, another thing againſt knowledge.
                        
                        There are many ſinnes doe paſſe from a man
with his knowledge,
                           1. Diſtinction To ſinne with knowledge and againſt knowledge doe differ. which yet are not againſt knowledge.
This is to be obſerved for the removall of a
ſcruple which may ariſe in ſome that are godly,
who elſe may be wounded with this doctrine
through a miſtake.
                        A regenerate man is, and muſt needs be ſuppoſed
guilty of more knowne ſinnes, than an unregenerate
man: and yet he commits fewer againſt knowledge,
than he.
                        Firſt,A regenerate man guilty of more ſinnes known, than another. I ſay, hee is guilty of more knowne ſinnes:
For he takes notice of every ſinfull diſpoſition that
is ſtirring in him, every by-end, every contrariety
unto holineſſe, deadneſſe to duty, reluctancie to
ſpirituall duties: and when regenerated, beginneth
to ſee and know more evill by himſelfe, than ever
he did before: he fees as the Apoſtle ſayes of himſelfe,
Rom. 7. 10. all concupiſcence: and the holier a
man is, the more he diſcernes and knowes his ſins:
So ſayes the Apoſtle, Rom. 7. 18. I know that in me
dwels no good thing. And ver. 21. I finde when I
would doe good, evill is preſent with me. And 23. I
ſee another law. All theſe, he ſayes, he perceived
and found daily in himſelfe: and the more holy
that he grew, the more he ſaw them. For the purer
and clearer the light of Gods Spirit ſhines in a
man, the more ſinnes he knowes: he will ſee luſts
ſteaming up, flying in his heart, like moates in the
ſun, or ſparkes out of a furnace, which elſe he had

not ſeene: the clearer the ſun-beame is which is
let into the heart, the more thou wilt ſee them.
                        But yet in the ſecond place,Yet not of more ſinnes againſt knowledge. I adde, that nevertheleſſe
he ſinnes leſſe againſt knowledge: For then
wee are properly ſaid to ſinne againſt knowledge,
when wee doe take the fulfilling of a luſt, or the
performance of an outward action, a dutie, or the
like, into deliberation and conſideration, and conſider
motives againſt the ſinne, or to the dutie, and
yet commit that ſinne, yeeld to it, and nouriſh that
luſt, and omit that dutie: Here now we ſinne not
onely with knowledge, but againſt knowledge: becauſe
knowledge ſtept in, and oppoſed us in it,
comes to interrupt and prevent us: but now in
thoſe failings in dutie, and ſtirring of luſts in the regenerate
afore mentioned, the caſe is otherwiſe:
they are committed indeed with knowledge, but
not againſt it: For it is not in the power of knowledge
to prevent them; for motus primo primi non
cadunt ſub libertatem; but yet though ſuch ſinnes
will ariſe againe and againe, yet ſayes a good heart,
they muſt not think to paſſe uncontrouled and unſeene:
Therefore let not poore ſoules miſtake me, as if I
moant, throughout this diſcourſe, of all ſins which
are knowne to be ſinnes, but I meane ſuch ſinnes
as are committed againſt knowledge: that is, when
knowledge comes and examines a ſinne, in or before
the committing of it, brings it to the Law, conteſts
againſt it, condemnes it, and yet a man approveth
it, and conſenteth to it; when a dutie and a
ſinne are brought before knowledge, as Barrabas
and Chriſt afore Pilate, and thy knowledge doth

againe and againe tell thee ſuch a ſinne is a great
ſinne, and ought to be crucified, and yet thou cryeſt,
let it goe; and ſo for the duty, it tels thee again
and againe it ought to be ſubmitted unto, and yet
thou omitteſt it, and committeſt the ſin, chooſeſt
Barrabas rather than Chriſt, theſe are ſinnes againſt
knowledge: now ſuch ſins againſt knowledg break
a mans peace, and the more conſideration before
had, the more the peace is broken.
                        The ſecond diſtinction is,2. Diſtinction. Men ſin againſt knowledge, either objectively, or circumſtantially onely. that men ſinne againſt
knowledg, either directly, or collaterally: objectively,
or circumſtantially.
                        
                        Firſt directly: when knowledge it ſelfe is the
thing men abuſe, or fight againſt, becommeth the 
                           object,
                           What it is to ſin directly againſt knowledge. the terminus, the butt and mark ſhot at; this
is to ſin directly againſt knowledge it ſelfe.
                        The ſecond way, collaterally, is, when knowledge
is but a circumſtance in our ſinnes: ſo as the pleaſure 
of ſome ſinne (we know to be a ſin) is the thing aimed
at;What to ſinne againſt knowledg circumſtantially onely. &amp; that our knowledge ſteps but in between
to hinder us in it, and we commit it notwithſtanding,
though we doe know it; here knowledge is indeed
ſinned againſt, yet but collaterally, and as a ſtander
by, but as a circumſtance onely, ſhot at per accidens,
concomitanter, and by the by, as one that ſteps
in to part a fray is ſmitten, for labouring to hinder
them in their ſin, as the Sodomi
                              •
                           es quarrelled with
Lot: they are both found in this Chapter, and
therefore come fitly within the compaſſe of this
diſcourſe.This diſtinction explained out of this Chapter.
                        
                        Firſt, This collaterall kinde of ſinning againſt
knowledge is mentioned in the 21. verſe, where he

ſaies, They knew God, yet they glorified him not:
there knowledge is made but a circumſtance of
their ſinning; they ſinned againſt it but collaterally.
But then that other kind of ſinning directly againſt
knowledge, is mentioned ver. 28. They liked not to
retaine God in their knowledge: that is, they hated
this knowledge it ſelfe, ſo as now they did not onely
love ſin, they knew to be ſin, but alſo they loved
not the knowledge of it; ſo that becauſe both are
thus clearly inſtanced in, wee will ſpeake of both
more largely.
                        Now ſinnes directly againſt knowledge it ſelfe
are many:Sins directly againſt knowledg reduced to two Heads. I will reduce the chiefe heads of them
into two branches:

                              Firſt, in regard of our ſelves.
                              Secondly, in regard of others.
                           
                        
                        Firſt,1. In regard of ourſelves five wayes. in regard of our ſelves, five wayes we may
thus ſin againſt knowledge it ſelfe.
                        
                            Firſt, when we abuſe knowledge to helpe us to
ſinne:When we abuſe knowledge to help us to ſin, 3. wayes. as firſt, to plot and contrive a ſin, as Iudas
plotted to betray his Maſter, if hee could conveniently;
ſo the text ſayes, Mark 14. 11. hee would
doe it wiſely:1. To plot and contrive ſinne. and thus thoſe that came to intrap
Chriſt with moſt cunning queſtions, did ſinne, and
thoſe who plot againſt the juſt,2. To colour ſins committed by lyes. as Pſal. 37. 12.
                        So ſecondly, when men uſe their wiſedoms to
tell a cunning lye,3. To colour ſins by pretence of religion, and uſe their knowledg of religion to plead for, and inſtifie their ſin
                                 •
                              . to cover a ſin; as Plato ſayes,
men of knowledge, ſunt ad mendacia potentiores &amp;
ſapientiores: whereas fooles, though they would
lye, yet often tell truth ere they are aware.
                        But alſo thirdly, when they abuſe morall knowledge,
which yet, as Ariſtotle ſayes, is leaſt apt

to be (I am ſure ſhould leaſt be) abuſed, ſo as to
make a ſhew of good pretences to cover their ſins,
and diſſemble them; not onely by finding out ſome
cunning artificiall colour, as David did in the matter
of Vriah — Chance of warre (ſayes he) falls to
all alike: but when men are ſo impudently hypocriticall,
as to make uſe of religious pretexts, (as
the Devill ſometimes doth) as Saul, who pretends
to Samuel, I have done the will of the Lord: and
when Samuel told him of the cattell, oh, ſayes he,
they are for a ſacrifice; when God had expreſly
commanded to kill them all. But this ſhift ſhifted
him out of his Kingdome, Samuel pronounceth
him a rebell in it, Rebellion is ſinne againſt knowledge,
therefore he knew it. Thus alſo Iezabel coloured
over the ſtoning of Naboth with a ſolemne faſt. So
Iudas fiſheth for money with a charitable pretence,
This might have beene ſold, and given to the poore.
In ſins againſt knowledge, uſually the mind indevours
to find out a colour, and that provokes God
more than the ſinne, becauſe we goe about to mock
him. We ſee men cannot endure a ſhift, much leſſe
the All-knowing God, not to be mocked: and we
ſee it is hard to convince ſuch an one. David was
faine to be brought to the rack, ere he would confeſſe,
when he had a ſhift; and men doe ſeeke ſuch
ſhifts onely in caſe of ſinning againſt conſcience:
for elſe there were no need,When men neglect to get knowledge that might preſerve them from ſinning, &amp;c. they would be ſure to 
plead ignorance, as Abimelech did.
                        Secondly, when men neglect the getting and obtaining
of knowledge, which knowledge might keep
&amp; hinder them frō ſinning, and might make them

expert in duties. This is as much as to ſin againſt
knowledge, although the ſins be committed out of
ignorance: yet that ignorance being through their
owne default, it comes all to one: when it may be
ſaid of men, as the Apoſtle doth of the Hebrewes,
Chap. 5. 12. That for the time they have had to learn,
they might have beene teachers; they had yet need be
taught againe the firſt principles▪
                            If a man had an
Apprentice, who through negligence and want of
heeding, and obſerving what hee daily ſees and
heares about his trade, might have got for his time
much knowledge in his trade, whereby he might
have ſaved his maſter much, which hee now hath
loſt him; and rid and perfected much worke, hee
daily ſpoiles him; ſuch careleſſe blockiſh ignorance
it is juſt for his maſter to correct him for, and to
charge on him all that waſte and loſſe, becauſe he
might have knowne how to have done better. And
therefore even they who thought ignorance in it
ſelfe no ſin (wherein they erred) yet the neglect of
knowledge upon this very ground, they thought a
great ſinne, and that it would be ſo farre from excuſing
ſinnes, as that it would aggravate them. So
here we ſee theſe Gentiles ſhall not onely be reckoned
with for the actuall knowledge, they had
attained to, and ſinned againſt; but alſo for what
they might have had, and have picked out of the
creatures. For ſo the Apoſtle brings in this here in
the 20. verſe, that the power of God being cleerly
ſeen in the creatures, they neglecting to ſpell and
reade it, ſo much knowledg as they might have got,
God will reckon to them, and aggravate their ſins
by.
                        
                           
Thirdly, which is yet much worſe, when men 
refuſe knowledge,When men refuſe knowledge that they may ſin more freely. that they may ſinne the more
freely; and doe ſtop the eare, leſt they ſhould be
charmed: As when men are loath, and afraid, and
dare not reade ſuch a booke as diſcovers, or might
diſcover that truth to them, the ſubmiſſion to
which would prejudice them, and this to the end
that they may plead ignorance of their ſinne. Thus
alſo thoſe that aſſent not to truth when it comes in
ſtrongly upon them, but ſeek to evade it. But 1 Cor.
14. 38. when the Apoſtle had cleerely diſcovered
the truth in thoſe things controverted, ſo as who
ever was ſpirituall, or not fully blind, might ſee, and
would acknowledge the truth: then he ſhuts up his
diſcourſe about them, ver. 27. If any be ignorant,
let him be ignorant: for it is wilfull, it is affected;
hee ſpeakes it, as elſewhere, Revel. laſt, it is ſaid,
He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill: that is, hee
that will be unjuſt, and refuſeth to turne, let him
goe on. This is a great ſinne, for God, you ſee,
gives ſuch a man over: one that is but neglectfull,
or dull of capacity, God will take paines with him,
to teach him, and beare with him, as Chriſt did
with his Diſciples: but if he be wilfully ignorant,
he lets him die in his ignorance, and yet will reckon
with him, as if all his ſinnes had beene committed
againſt knowledge, becauſe hee refuſed to
know.
                        The fourth is to hate the light, and to endevour 
to extinguiſh it.Is to hate the light, and to endevour to extinguiſh it. This is yet much worſe, when
men hate the Word, and the Miniſters of it, the
examples of Gods people, and the light they carry

with them (they ſhining as lights in a crooked generation,
Phil. 2. 15. and yet they hate theſe, as theeves
doe a torch in the night, and fly againſt the light, as
batts doe, and as the Iewes did, Iohn 3. 20.) This
Chriſt ſayes is the great condemning ſinne of all others.
So theſe Gentiles put Socrates to death for
reproving them. And thus men ſinne alſo, when
they labour to extinguiſh the light in their owne
conſciences, and like not to retaine God in their
knowledge, verſe 28. but would ſtudie the art of forgetfulneſſe:
When men have put the candle out,
and drawne the curtaines, that they may ſinne, and
ſleepe in ſin more freely and ſecurely. Thus thoſe
alſo ſin in a higher meaſure, who have had a cleare
conviction, that they ought to be thus ſtrict, and
ought to ſanctifie the Lords day, and pray privately,
but now have loſt this light, and think they
need not be ſo ſtrict: when men continue not in
what they were once aſſured of, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,
2 Tim. 3. 14. theſe ſinne againſt their knowledge,
and are the worſt of ſuch ſinners: and this eſtate
Ariſtotle himſelfe makes ſtatum maligni, the ſtate
of a wicked one, namely, when the ſparkes of light
are extinguiſht or hated. For when any mans light
is loſt and turned into darkneſſe by ſinning, then, as
Chriſt ſayes, how great is that darkneſſe? When
good lawes are not onely not enacted and embraced,
but repealed alſo, (it is Ariſtotles ſimilitude,
to diſtinguiſh an incontinent perſon, and a wicked
man) this is an high kind of ſinning: So of theſe
Gentiles it is ſaid, their fooliſh heart was darkned;
they had extinguiſht ſome of that light God gave

them. As ſome drink away their wits, ſo ſome ſin
away their conſciences; and thus by degrees, they
firſt ſinne away the light of the word they had, as
they in Iude, who were religious once, and then
they quench even that little ſparke of nature that
is left. Alſo verſe 10. corrupting themſelves in
what they know naturally.
                        
                        Fiftly, Men ſinne againſt knowledge yet worſe,
when they hold opinion againſt their knowledge.When men hold opinions againſt their conſciences.
So many are ſaid to doe, in 1 Tim. 4. 2. he foretels
they ſhould ſpeake lyes in Hypocriſie, and invent
lyes that ſhould have a pretence of holineſſe; which
they know to be a lye, or elſe they ſhould not be
ſaid to ſpeake lyes in hypocriſie; but they doe it to
maintaine their honour and greatneſſe, which muſt
downe, if their doctrine prove falſe: and though
many are given up to beleeve their lyes, 2 Theſ. 2. 11.
as a puniſhment of their not loving the truth; yet
others of them ſhall know they are lies, and yet
vent them for truths. Thus when men faſhion their
opinion to the times and wayes of preferment, and
their dependances on Great ones, or to maintaine
and uphold a faction, or out of pride, having broached
an error, maintaine it, though the pulling out
that one tile doth untile all the houſe. Theſe are the
two cauſes given of perverting the truth, 1 Tim. 6.
4, 5. namely, pride and covetouſneſſe, and ſuppoſing
gaine godlineſſe, and ſo faſhioning their religion
accordingly: when men are Knights of the poſt,
that will write or ſpeak any thing, whereby they
may get gaine and preferment.
                        
                           
Secondly,2. Men ſin directly againſt knowledge it ſelfe in reſpect of others,
                            men ſin againſt knowledge in regard
of others.
                        Firſt, by concealing it: the Apoſtle indeed ſayes
 in a certaine caſe, Haſt thou knowledge? keepe it to
thy ſelfe.
                           By concealing knowledge. He ſpeakes it of opinions, or practices about
things indifferent, which might ſcandalize
the weake; but if thou haſt knowledge, which
may edifie thy brother, thou oughteſt to communicate
it. Socrates, knowing there was but one God,
ſaid, in his Apologie for his life, that if they would
give him life, upon condition to keep that truth to
himſelfe, and not to teach it to others, hee would
not accept life upon ſuch a condition: and I remember
he expreſſeth his reſolution in words very
nigh the ſame words the Apoſtles uſed, Acts
4. 20. whether it be better to obey God than men,
judge you: and, we cannot but teach the things wee
have heard and ſeene, ſayes Chriſt: for knowledge
is a thing will boyle within a man forvent, and cannot
be impriſoned: It is light, and the end why
light was made, was to be ſet up to give light. And
Chriſt argues from an apparent abſurdity to put a
light under a buſhell, which may give light to all
the houſe; Haſt thou knowledge of God and of
his wayes, thou canſt not but ſpeake (if withall
thou haſt but a good heart) to all in the familie, to
thy wife in thy boſome, &amp;c. God took it for granted,
that Abraham would teach his children what
 he ſhould know from him: The ſame diſpoſition is
in all the children of Abraham.
                           Men endevour to ſuppreſſe knowledge in others.
                        
                        Secondly, when men endeavour to ſuppreſſe
knowledge. As the Phariſees, they kept the keyes of

it in their hands, and would not open the treaſures
of it themſelves, nor let others doe it neither. So
they (Acts 4. 16.) could not deny but a great miracle
was done by the Apoſtles (ſay themſelves) but
that it ſpread no further, let us threaten them, and
charge them, that they ſpeake no more in his name.
And this they did againſt their conſciences by their
owne profeſſion, we cannot deny it: as if they had
ſaid, if wee could we would, but it was too manifeſt
it was the truth. So when Maſters keep their
ſervants from the meanes of knowledge, they are
thus guilty.
                        Thirdly, when wee would make others ſinne 
againſt their conſciences.When men go about to make others ſinne againſt their conſciences. Iohn 9. The Phariſes, when the
blind man would not ſay as they ſaid, they caſt him
out; they would have had him ſay that Chriſt was
a ſinner, when through the ſmall light he had, hee
judged it evident enough, that a ſinner ſhould not
doe ſuch a miracle, as was never done ſince the
world began. And ſo Iezabel made the Judges, and
witneſſes ſinne againſt conſcience in accuſing Naboth:
and ſo ſome of the Gentiles, that would hold
correſpondencie with the Jewes, would have conſtrained
the Galathians to be circumciſed, Gal. 6.
12. Thoſe that knew that circumciſion was to be
aboliſht, yet they would perſwade them to it by a
clubb argument, drawn from avoiding perſecution,
not from evidence of the Truth, or by reaſons
that might convince them, and their conſciences:
therfore he ſayes, they conſtrained thē. The perſwaders
might indeed glory, as having their cauſe and
ſide ſtrengthened, but they wanne little credit to

their cauſe by it; for as the perſwaders arguments
were ſuited to fleſh, ſo the others yeelding was out
of fleſh, and ſo they glory in your fleſh and weakneſſe,
ſayes he; as the Papiſts urged Cranmer, not by
arguments, but threats and promiſes to recant;
this is the greateſt cruelty in the world, to have a
man murder himſelfe, ſtab his conſcience. To
offend a weak conſcience is a ſinne, if but paſſively,
when thou doſt ſomething before his face, which
his conſcience is againſt: but if thou makeſt him
wound his own conſcience, and to doe an act himſelfe,
which his owne conſcience is againſt, it is
much worſe: as if thou beeſt a Maſter, and haſt a
ſervant who pleadeth conſcience, that hee cannot
lye for thy advantage in thy ſhop, or who will not
doe unlawfull buſineſſes on the Sabbath day, and
pleads conſcience, wilt thou ſmite him and whip
him? God will ſmite thee, thou whited wall. How
dareſt thou ſmite him, and ſo cauſe him to doe that
for which God will whip him worſer? Shew mercy
to thoſe under you, enforme their conſciences,
wring them not,2. Generall Branch: Sins committed collaterally or circumſtantially againſt knowledge. you may hap to break the wards if
you doe.
                        Now for ſinnes committed collaterally, or per
modum circumſtantia (that I may ſo expreſſe it)
againſt knowledge, they are done either when particular
acts of ſinne are committed,It is done, 1. Either in particular acts of ſinning, or 2. In continuing in an eſtate of ſinning againſt knowledge. and duties omitted,
againſt light and knowledge; and ſo the
Saints may and doe often ſinne againſt knowledge.
Or,
                        Secondly, in regard of a knowne eſtate of ſinne,
and impenitencie perſiſted in; when men continue,

and goe on in ſuch a ſtate againſt conviction of conſcience,
that ſuch is their eſtates.
                        For the firſt,Particular inſtances being infinite. becauſe particular acts of ſin committed
againſt knowledge are infinite, and there
will be no end of inſtancing in particulars,A diſtinction is given concening them. therefore
I will not inſiſt: Onely in briefe this diſtinction
concerning ſuch acts may be obſerved, and the
obſervation of it may be uſefull: That ſome acts
of ſinnes againſt knowledge, are meerely tranſient:
that is, are done and ended at once. And though
the guilt of them is eternall, yet the extent of the
act is finiſhed with the committing it, and reacheth
no further:1. Some ſinne more tranſient as a vaine oath, breach of the Sabbath,
&amp;c. which acts cannot be repealed, though they
may be repented of. But others there are, which
though the act may be but once outwardly and
profeſſedly done,2. Some more permanent and continued, until recalld, though but once committed. yet have an habituall and continued
permanency, life, &amp; ſubſiſtence given it, ſuch
as that untill a man doth recall them, hee may be
ſaid continually to renew thoſe acts, and every day
to be guilty of them, and to maintaine it, and ſo habitually
to cōmit them. As it is with Laws, which
though made but once, are yet continued acts of
the State, whileſt they ſtand in force unrepealed: ſo
is it in ſome ſins. For inſtance, when a man doth
take goods from his neighbour unjuſtly, the act indeed
is done but once: but till hee reſtores them,
he may be ſaid to ſteale them; every day, every
houre, he continues to doe it habitually; So a man
having ſubſcribed to falſhood, or recanted the
truth publiquely, the act, though done but once,
yet untill a retractation be ſome wayes made, hee

continues that act,Which are of 
                                 〈◊〉
                               other moſt 
                                 •
                              angerous to 
                                 •
                              ommit, when againſt knowledge. and ſo is daily anew guilty of it.
So if a man ſhould marry one, whom it is unlawfull
for him to marry, (as Herod did) though that
ſinfull act of eſpouſals, whereby they entred into
it, was ſoon diſpatcht; yet, till a divorce, he lives in
a continuall ſin. And ſuch acts (of this latter ſort I
meane) againſt knowledge are moſt dangerous to
commit; becauſe to continue thus in them, though
but once committed, hazards a mans eſtate; and
therefore men find, when they come to repent, the
greateſt ſnare, and trouble, and difficulty in ſuch
kind of ſins; to extricate themſelves out of them
by a meet and true repentance.
                        But as concerning the firſt branch of this diſtinction,
namely, of particular acts committed againſt
knowledge; beſides this laſt diſtinction briefly
touched; I will anon give you ſeverall aggravations
and rules whereby to meaſure the ſinfulneſſe
that is in ſuch acts ſo committed: but in the meane
time the ſecond branch of this former diſtinction
muſt be inſiſted upon, and therefore I will bring in
theſe aggravations and rules which concerne particular
acts, as diſtinct heads, after I have briefly
ſpoken to this other, which is, That
                        Secondly,2. Going on in a ſinfull eſtate againſt knowledge. thoſe ſinne againſt knowledge, who
goe on in an eſtate of ſin and impenitencie, which
they know to be damnable: As Pharaoh, Exod. 9.
27. who confeſt that the and his people were wicked,
and yet hardned himſelfe in ſinne moſt dangerouſly:
and yet three ſorts of men may apparently
be convinced thus to ſin.Three ſorts of men thus ſin:
                        
                        Firſt, thoſe that keep out, and with-draw themſelves

from profeſſing Chriſt and his wayes,Such as for worldly end forbear to profeſſe Chriſt a
                                 •…
                               his waies, whi
                                 ••…
                               they know to be ſuch. and 
the feare of his name, out of ſhame or feare of man,
or loſſe of preferment, or the like worldly ends,
when yet they are convinced that they are Gods
wayes, and ought to be profeſſed by them. I doe
not ſay, that all, who doe not come in to profeſſe
Chriſt, and that doe not joyne themſelves with his
people, that they goe on againſt knowledge; for
many are ignorant, and miſtaken about them: but
when men are convinced of the truth, and neceſſity
of profeſſing and confeſsing of it even unto ſalvation,
(as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Rom. 10) and yet out of fear,
or ſhame, keep ſtill on the other ſide, drawing in
their hornes all together. Theſe goe on in an eſtate
of impenitencie againſt knowledg; for put all theſe
together, and it muſt needs appeare to be ſo: as
Firſt, when they are convinced that this is the
truth, and that ſalvation and the power of religion
is onely to be found in ſuch wayes and men: and
Secondly, that theſe are to be practiced and profeſſed,
and yet Thirdly, out of ſhame, &amp;c. keepe
ſtill a loofe off, and goe on a contrary way; theſe
muſt needs know, that they goe on in an eſtate of
impenitencie againſt knowledge. This was the
caſe of many of the Phariſes, who therefore ſinned
highly: they beleeved, and were convinced, that
Chriſt was the Meſſiah; and ſo then to be confeſt,
and followed, and to be cleaved unto: and then alſo
they muſt needs know, that his followers onely
were the Children of God: Yet Ioh. 12. 42. it is
ſaid, though they thus beleeved on him, yet they durſt
not confeſſe him for feare of the Iewes, and of the

                           Phariſes, and of being put out of the Synagogues. At
the latter day, Chriſt ſhall not need to ſever ſuch
from the reſt, as hee will doe the ſheepe from the
goats; for they willingly remaine all their dayes
amongſt them, whom they know to be goats, and
refuſe the company, and fould, and food, and
marks of the ſheep; which they know to be ſuch:
they may apologize, and make fair with the Saints,
that their hearts are with them, but they will be
rankt at the day of Judgement, as here they ranked
themſelves,Pſal. 125. ult. 
                           with the workers of iniquity. Of theſe
doth the Pſalmiſt ſpeake, Thoſe that turne aſide by
their crooked wayes, them ſhall the Lord leave with the
workers of iniquity.
                        
                        Thoſe alſo thus ſinne, and are to be joyned with
theſe, who know the tearms and condition of ſalvation,
and how they muſt part with all for Chriſt,
and yet will not come to the price; ſuch doe goe
deſperately on againſt knowledge in a bad eſtate,
and doe judge themſelves unworthy of eternall
life. Thus the young man in the Goſpell, he was
told, that he was to ſell all, and that was the condition,
and hee knew heaven was worth it, and was
convinced of the truth herein, that thus he ought
to doe, for he went away ſorrowfull: now if he had
not knowne that he went away without happineſſe,
he needed not have beene ſorrowfull at all; but he
knew the bargaine of ſalvation was not ſtruck up,
and likewiſe what it ſtuck at, and yet ſtill reſted in
his former condition, and choſe rather to enjoy his
many poſſeſſions: This man now went on in his
ſtate againſt knowledge.
                        
                           
Secondly, as alſo thoſe who upon the ſame or like 
ground defer their repentance,Thoſe that defer repentance. theſe go on in a bad
eſtate, and muſt needs know they doe ſo; for in
that they promiſe to repent hereafter, and take up
purpoſes to doe it, when they have gone on a little
while longer, to adde drunkenneſſe to thirſt, they
doe thereby profeſſe that there is a work of grace,
which they muſt attaine to, ere they can be in the
ſtate of grace: for they would not promiſe ſo much
hereafter, but that they know not how, without
ſuch a work, they ſhould be ſaved. Whileſt therefore
ſuch ſhall reſt without preſent endevouring
after it, ſo long they are judged in themſelves to be
in a bad eſtate at preſent. When men know the curſes
due to their preſent eſtate, and yet ſay as hee,
Deut. 29. 19. I will goe on in the way of my heart, and
ſhall have peace afterward. This man ſinnes moſt
highly, and therefore Gods wrath ſmoakes againſt
that man, and he ſayes of him, that he will not be
mercifull to him, in that place.
                        Thirdly, ſunk and broken profeſſors, ſuch cannot 
but goe on in a bad eſtate againſt knowledge,Apoſtate profeſſors goe on in an eſtate of ſinning againſt knowledge.
when either men are falne from the practice and
profeſſion of what is good, which once they
thought neceſſarie to ſalvation; or when they continue
to hold forth their profeſſion in Hypocriſie.
Thoſe that have eſcaped the pollutions of the world,
through the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt, but are returned
to their vomit againe, ſome of theſe are ingenious,
and acknowledge both themſelves faln, &amp; their
preſent eſtate moſt miſerable, and yet goe on in it;
and ſuch are to be pittyed, but yet are in a moſt dangerous

condition. Saul when he was fallen away,
yet had this ingenuity a while left, hee deſired Samuel
to pray to his God for him, and told David,
that he was more righteous than he; yet ſtill went
on in his courſes, and in the end (as ſome have
thought) ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                        
                        But others there are, who though they be fallen
from all the inward, powerfull and ſecret performance
of duties they once did practice, and from
all conſcience of ſinning, yet retain their profeſſion
which they know to be but an out-ſide: theſe of all
others goe on againſt knowledge: and Rev. 22. 15.
they are ſaid to make a lye; not onely to tell a lye in
words, but to make a lye in deeds. Now a lye is a ſin
of all others moſt againſt knowledge, and indeed
againſt a double knowledge, both facti and juris:
&amp; ſo is this. 1. That they profeſſe themſelves to be
that they know they are not. 2. That they will
not endevour after that ſtate they know they ought
to get into, if ever ſaved. This is the condition of
many, who being convinced of the power of religion,
have launched forth into a profeſſion, and
hoyſt up ſaile, but now the tyde is fallen, the ſpirit
withdrawne, the conſcience of ſinne extinguiſht in
them; yet for their credit ſake ſtill beare their ſails
up as high as ever: even as many Merchants doe,
who are ſunk in their eſtates, ſtill beare a faire ſhew,
yea will ſeeme richer than ordinary, by purchaſing
lands, &amp;c. Such a profeſſor was Iudas, hee began
ſeriouſly, and thought to have gone to heaven, and
was earneſt in good duties at firſt: as they alſo,
2 Pet. 2. 18. they really, or 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           , eſcaped the pollutions
                           
of the world, through the knowledge of Chriſt:
but in the end Iudas became a groſſe hypocrite, one
that pretended the poore, when he loved the bag;
and on the ſudden betrayed his Maſter, when yet
the Diſciples knew it not, ſuſpected Iudas as little
as themſelves; and the end of thoſe alſo, in that
fore-named place, is ſaid to be worſe than their beginning.
Now becauſe ſuch ſinne ſo highly againſt
knowledge, therefore their puniſhment is made the
regula of all other wicked mens; as when it is ſaid,
that other ſinners ſhall have their portion with Hypocrites:
as the wicked Angels puniſhment is made
the meaſure of mens: Goe ye curſed into the fire prepared
for the Devill and his Angels: ſo among men,
ſuch groſſe Hypocrites, their puniſhment is made
the rule, and ſo the chiefe of all kind of torments,
which ſinners of the ſonnes of men ſhall undergoe.
                        Now let mee ſpeake a word to all ſuch as thus
go on in a ſtate of impenitencie againſt knowledge:Application.
this is a high kinde of ſinning, and of all the
moſt deſperate, and doth argue more hardneſſe of
heart, and deſpiſing the riches of Gods goodneſſe. For
if, as in the Rom. 2. 4. to go on in ſinne, when a man
[knowes not,] that is, conſiders not that Gods mercy
leads him to repentance, is made the ſigne and effect of
a very hard heart, treaſuring up wrath, then much
more, when thou knoweſt and conſidereſt thou art
in an impenitent condition, and haſt many motions
leading thee to repentance, is thy heart then to be
accounted hard? When a man commits a particular
act againſt knowledge, he haply and uſually ſtill

thinks his eſtate may be good, and that he ſhall not
loſe God utterly, or hazard the loſſe of him; onely
his ſpirit, being at preſent empty of communion
with him, he ſteales out to ſome ſtolne pleaſure:
but when a man knowes his eſtate bad, and
that he is without God in the world, and yet goes on,
he doth hereby caſt away the Lord, and profeſſeth
he cares not for him, or that communion which
is to be had by him, as Eſau did his birth-right.
                        
                           David, though he deſpiſed the Lord, yet hee
did not caſt away the Lord, as Saul did: for Saul
ventured utterly to loſe him, knowing his eſtate
naught. David, when hee ſinned, thought Gods
eternall favour would ſtill continue, though for the
preſent he might loſe the ſenſe of it. But when a
man goes on in a ſtate of ſinning, he ventures the
loſſe of Gods eternall love, and ſlights it, and
knowes he doth ſo: when a man knowes that he is
condemned already, as being impenitent, and that all
his eternall eſtate lyes upon the non-payment of
ſuch duties of repentance, &amp;c. and that the guilt
of all his ſinnes will come in upon him, and that an
execution is out, and yet goes on, this is more than
to commit one act againſt knowledge, whereby he
thinks he brings upon himſelf but the guilt of that
one ſinne; and upon the committing of which, he
thinks not the morgage of all lyes, though it deſerves
it; herein men ſhew themſelves more deſperate.2. Head: Rules whereby to eſtimate ſinnes againſt knowledge.
                        
                        In the next place, I come to thoſe rules, whereby
you may meaſure and eſtimate ſinning againſt knowledge,
in any particular act of ſinning; and they are

either before the ſinne, or in ſinning:
                           Of two ſorts Before ſinning or in ſinning 1 Before ſinning, 3. rules. 1. The more a man conſider the iſſues and conſequents o
                                 •
                               a ſinne. 
                           three of either,
which I make a ſecond head, to explaine this doctrine
by.
                        Firſt, before.
                        
                        The firſt rule is, The more thou kneweſt, and
didſt conſider the iſſues and conſequents of that
ſinne thou didſt commit, the more thou ſinneſt
againſt conſcience in it: when as in Rom. 1. ult. Thou
knowing (ſayes the Apoſtle) that thoſe that commit
ſuch things, are worthy of death: that is, thou conſidereſt
that Hell and Damnation is the iſſue and deſert
of it, and yet committeſt it; yea and this when
haply hell fire at preſent flaſheth in thy face, and
yet thou goeſt on to doe it, in this caſe men are ſaid
to chooſe death, and to love it, Prov. 3. 36. When a
man conſiders, that the way to the whorehouſe are
the wayes to death (as Solomon ſpeaks) So when thou
a profeſſor conſidereſt with thy ſelfe before, This
ſinne will prove ſcandalous, and undoe me, diſable
me for ſervice, caſt mee out of the hearts of good
men, and yet doſt it. Thus that fooliſh King was
told againe and againe, Ier. 38. 17, 18, 19. that if
he would yeeld to the King of Babel, he ſhould ſave
his life, and City, and Kingdome, and live there
ſtill; but if hee would not, he ſhould not eſcape:
but as Ieremie told him, verſe 23. Thou ſhalt cauſe
this City to be burnt with fire, yet he would not hearken:
This is the word of the Lord (ſayes Ieremie,) and
he knew it to be ſo; and yet being a weake Prince,
led by his Nobles, he would not follow his Counſell:
and thus Iudas fully knew the iſſue: Chriſt
had ſaid againe and againe, Woe be to him by whom

the Sonne of man is betrayed, and yet went on to
doe it.
                        The ſecond rule is,Rule, The more conſultations and de
                              
                                 ••
                              tes before. the more conſultations, debates,
and motives againſt it, did runne through
thee before thou didſt it, ſo much the greater and
more hainous. How often did mercy come in, and
tell thee, that if thou lookeſt for any hope or part
in it, thou ſhouldeſt not doe ſuch an evill? how
often came that in, Shall I doe this, and ſinne againſt
God? did any Scripture come in to teſtifie againſt
thee in the nick? did God ſend in the remembrance
of ſuch a mercie paſt, to perſwade thee; or
ſome mercies to come, which thou dependeſt upon
him for? That which made Spira's ſinne ſo great,
was ſuch debates as theſe before: and this made
Darius ſinne, in caſting Daniel into the Lions den,
ſo great; he debated it with himſelfe, Dan. 6. 14.
he was ſore diſpleaſed with himſelfe, and laboured
to the going downe of the ſunne to deliver him; he
conſidered that he was as his right hand in all the
affaires of his Kingdome, and a man entrapped
meerely for his conſcience, and that to put him to
death was to ſacrifice him to their malice; he knew
him to be holy, and wiſe, worth all the men that
ſought after his life, and yet yeelded; theſe conſiderations
troubled him afore, and alſo after; inſomuch
as he could not ſleep for them, ver. 18. Now
becauſe that every ſuch conſultation ſhould ſet an
impreſſion upon the heart, and countermand the
motions of ſin, when therefore thou doſt it, maugre
all ſuch debates and motives to the contrary, this is
much againſt knowledg, and very heynous. Therefore

the Phariſes, Luke 7. 30. are ſaid to have rejected
the counſell of God, 
                           
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           , in or againſt themſelves:
the words will beare either: In themſelves,
becauſe they knew it, and tooke it into conſideration,
and yet rejected it: and againſt themſelves, becauſe
it was their deſtruction.
                        The third rule is,3. Rule, The more teſtimonies and warnings againſt ſinne. that the more confirmations
any man hath had of the knowledge of that which
he ſinneth in, and teſtimonies againſt it, the greater
ſinne againſt knowledge it is: when a man hath
had a cloud of witneſſes in his obſervation againſt
a particular ſinne, and yet doth it, and goes on in
it, it is the more fearfull. To goe on againſt that
one witneſſe, the bare light and grudging of naturall
conſcience onely, is not ſo much; but when it
is further confirmed, and backed by the word
written, which a man hath read, and with teſtimonies,
out of which a man meets with ſuch places,
wherein againe and againe in reading of it, ſuch a
practice is condemned, and obſerves it; and then
alſo heares it reproved in Sermons, and of all ſinnes
elſe, heares in private conference that ſinne ſpoken
againſt alſo; yea hath in his eye many examples of
others ſinning in the like kinde, which have beene
puniſhed, yea haply himſelfe alſo; yet to ſin againſt
all theſe is exceeding hainous. Sometimes God
orders things ſo, as a ſinne is made a great ſinne, by
ſuch forewarnings; ſo he contrived circumſtances
that Iudas ſinned a great ſinne; for Iudas knew before
that Chriſt was the Saviour of the world; he
knew it by all the miracles he had ſeene, as alſo by
his gracious words and converſe; and he profeſſed

as much in following of him; and he had the written
word againſt it, Thou ſhalt not murder the innocent.
But yet further, God to aggravate his ſinne
to the higheſt, orders it ſo, that Chriſt ſhould tell
him of it when he was to goe about it, pronounceth
a woe to him, Iohn 22. 22. that it had beene good for
that man that he had never beene borne. Mar. 14. 21.
and the Diſciples they were ſorrowfull at Chriſts
ſpeech, when hee ſuſpected one of them; and
ſhewed an abomination and deteſtation of ſuch a
fact, there was a Jurie of eleven men, yea witneſſes
againſt it; yea and Iudas againſt himſelfe, he asked
if it were he; yea and Chriſt gave him a ſop, and
told him, thou haſt ſaid it, and doe what thou doeſt
quickly: which even then might argue to his conſcience,
that he was God, and ſearched and knew
his heart, and yet hee went out and did it immediately.
How did hee ſinne againſt the haire, as wee
ſpeak, and how did all theſe circumſtances aggravate
his ſin?
                        But yet a more cleare evidence of this is that inſtance
of Pilate, whom God many wayes would
have ſtopt in his ſinne of condemning Chriſt, who
examining him before the Phariſes, he could finde
no fault with him, as concerning thoſe things
whereof they accuſed him, Luke 23. 14. and yet to
allay their malice, unjuſtly ſcourged him, verſe 16.
And further, when he ſent him to Herod, as being
willing to rid his owne hands of him, Herod alſo
found nothing worthy of death in him, verſe 15.
which was another witneſſe might have confirmed
him concerning Chriſts innocencie. Yea yet further,

that the fact might be more aggravated, a moſt
notorious murtherers life muſt be put into the ſcale
with Chriſts, and either the one or the other condemned:
and when the people yet choſe Barrabas,
why (ſayes Pilate) what evill hath he done? ver. 22.
then he diſtinctly knew and conſidered, that he was
delivered up through envie: Yea and when hee
was upon the bench, and ready to pronounce ſentence,
as it were, God admoniſht him by his owne
wife, Mat. 27. 19. whom God himſelfe had admoniſhed
in a dreame, ſhe ſending him word ſhee
had ſuffered many things by reaſon of him that night,
and therefore have nothing (ſayes ſhee) to doe with
that juſt man: yea he himſelfe, when he condemns
him, waſheth his hands. And thus it falls out in
many ſinfull buſineſſes which men are about, that
God often and many ſeverall wayes would knock
them off, and ſtops them in their way, as hee did
Balaam; reproves them, as he did him by a dumbe
Aſſe, 2 Pet. 2. 16. ſo there by ſome ſilent paſſage
of providence, and not onely ſo, but by his Spirit
alſo ſtanding in their way, with the threatnings
ready drawne and brandiſht againſt them, as the
Angell did with a drawne ſword againſt Balaam,
and yet they goe on; this is fearfull.2. Rules to meaſure the ſinfulneſſe of ſuch acts in ſinning, 3.
                        
                        There are 3. Rules alſo, whereby the ſinfulneſſe
of ſin, as it is againſt knowledge, may be meaſured,
from what may be obſerved IN the act: as 
                        
                        Firſt,The leſſe paſſion or temptation to a ſin againſt knowledge. the leſſe paſſion, or inward violence or
temptation to a ſinne committed againſt knowledg,
the greater ſinne againſt knowledge it is argued to
be: For then the knowledge is the clearer, paſſion

or temptation being as a miſt. But then to ſinne,
when a man is not in paſſion, is to ſtumble at noonday.
For as drunkenneſſe takes away reaſon, ſo
doth paſſion (which is a ſhort drunkenneſſe) cloud
and miſt a mans knowledge. And ſo Ariſtotle
compares the knowledge of an incontinent perſon,
to the knowledge of one that is drunk. When Peter
denied his Maſter, though hee had warning of it
before, and ſo it was againſt knowledge, and it
was by lying, and ſwearing, and forſwearing, which
are ſinnes of all other moſt directly againſt knowledge,
yet he was taken unexpectedly; and when
that which might ſtir up feare to the utmoſt in him,
was in his view; for hee was then in the Judgement
Hall, where his Maſter, juſt before his face,
was arraigned for his life, and he thought he might
alſo have preſently been brought to the barre with
him, if he had beene diſcovered to have been his
Diſciple; ſo as his paſſion being up, his ſoule was
diſtempered, reaſon had little time to recover it
ſelfe; and therefore though it was againſt knowledge,
yet the leſſe againſt knowledge, becauſe
knowledge had laeſam operationem, it had not its
perfect worke upon his heart: but now Iudas, in betraying
his Maſter, had not onely warning before,
but was not tempted to it, but went of himſelfe,
and made the offer to the Phariſees, ſought how
conveniently to doe it, plotted to doe it, had his
wits about him, had time to think of it, and therefore
it was (beſides the hainouſneſſe of the act)
more alſo againſt knowledge, and ſo the greater.
So David when he went to ſlay Nabal, was in hot

blood, in a paſſion; but when hee plotted to kill
Vriah, he was in cold blood: he was drunke when
he lay with Bathſheba, but ſober when hee made
Vriah drunke: hee went quietly and ſedately on in
it. And therefore we find David blamed onely in
the matter of Vriah, not ſo much for that of Bathſheba.
                        
                        Secondly,The more inward regreet, and ſorrow, and reluctancy, the ſtronger is the knowledge, and ſo more againſt it. the more ſorrow, reniſus, or reluctancie,
and regreeting of mind there is againſt a ſinne,
'tis a ſign that the knowledge of it is the ſtronger,
and quicker againſt it, and ſo the ſinne the more
againſt knowledge: for that gaine-ſaying and diſpleaſure
of the minde againſt it, ariſeth from the
ſtrength and violent beating of the pulſe of conſcience,
and oppoſition of it againſt the ſinne, it ſprings
from the greater and deeper apprehenſion of the
evill of the ſinne in the action, which is then in doing;
and though that reluctancie be a better ſigne
of the eſtate of the perſon, than if there were none
at all; as there is not in thoſe who are paſt feeling,
&amp; commit ſin with greedineſſe; whoſe eſtate is therefore
worſe, and more uncapable of repentance,
yet the fact it ſelf is argued to be the more hainous,
for it argues it to be againſt ſtrong, active, ſtirring
knowledge. This argued Herods ſinne to be much
againſt knowledge (as indeed it was) Mark 6. 26.
the text ſayes, he was exceeding ſorrowfull: now
that he could not have beene, unleſſe he had exceedingly
apprehended what a great ſinne it was to
behead Iohn, who, he knew, was a juſt and an holy
man, ver. 20. and who was one that had a great
place in his eſtimation, for he obſerved him, and was

wrought much upon by his miniſterie, and he knew
that he did but ſacrifice him to the malice of a wicked
woman; and in this caſe the ſinne is alſo hereby
made ſo much the greater, in that Conſcience
doth ſtir up a contrary violent paſſion in the heart
againſt the temptation, and therefore yet to doe it,
when there is ſuch a bank caſt up that might reſiſt
it, yet then to break all downe, ſuch a ſin waſts the
conſcience much.
                        
                            Thirdly, on the contrary, the more hardneſſe of
heart there is,The more hardneſſe of heart in committing a ſinne knowne to be a ſin, the greater the ſin, as it is a ſin againſt knowledge. and want of tenderneſſe, in committing
that ſinne, which a man knowes to be a ſinne,
it is argued thereby to be the greater ſinne againſt
knowledge; not onely the greater ſinne, but the
greater ſinne againſt knowledge. For hardneſſe of
heart in ſinning, is an effect of having formerly ſinned
much againſt knowledge before. For as the
light of the Sun hardneth clay, ſo the beames of
knowledge and conſcience, lighting upon mens
hearts, uſe to harden them, and doe make them in
the end paſt feeling. And therefore in 1 Tim. 4. 2.
ſinning againſt knowledge is made the cauſe of a
ſeared conſcience, they ſpeak lyes in Hypocriſie:
and therefore knowingly that they are lyes, and
ſuch lyes as damne others as well as themſelves,
which who beleeve are damned, 2 Theſ. 2. 11, 12.
and if ſo, no wonder if it followes, having their
Conſciences ſeared with an hot iron. It is not a cold
iron will ſeare their conſciences, and make them
inſenſible, but an hot iron, a burning and a ſhining
light, which once having had place in their conſciences,
and being rejected, they begin to be hardned

and ſeared. For knowledge makes ſinnes and
the apprehenſions of them, familiar to a man, and
ſo leſſe terrible and frightfull in the end, as Beares
and Lyons doe become to their keepers, through
cuſtome. Iudas had a hard heart, when he came to
betray his Maſter, ſurely his conſcience had ſmitten
him at firſt more for nimming out of the bag,
than it did now for this of murder. He could never
have had ſuch a hard heart, had he not had much
knowledge: was it not a hard heart, that when he
was challenged to his face, hee could ſet a brazen
face on it, and did aske as well as the reſt, Is it I?
when alſo Chriſt curſed him to his face, who
ſhould doe it, and the Diſciples all abhorr'd it:
had not Iudas lived under ſuch bleſſed and glorious
meanes, and ſinned long againſt knowledge,
all this would have ſtartled him, and have ſtaggered
in his purpoſe: but he goes on as if it were nothing,
though when he had done it, his conſcience
was then opened too late; when a man formerly
hath beene troubled with a ſmall ſinne, more than
now with a groſſe lye, which he can digeſt better
than once the other: or, when before, if he omitted
praying, it troubled him, now he can goe a weeke
without, and is not ſenſible of it, it is a ſigne that
his knowledge hath hardned him.
                        Thus having given ſuch rules,3. Head. Aggravations drawne from the kind

may eſtimate the ſinfulneſſe of particular acts, I will
now proceed to other wayes, aggravations taken
from the kind of knowledge a man ſins againſt, to
ſin againſt what kind of knowledge is moſt hainous
and dangerous; and theſe are five, drawn from the

ſeverall qualifications of that knowledge, and the
light which men ſinne againſt.The more

                              eater the ſin. For the greater, or
the more ſtrong &amp; efficacious the light and knowledge
is, the greater is the ſinne of knowledge thou
committeſt; and this I make a third generall head
to explaine this doctrine by. All theſe five rules
being applicable and common both to particular
acts againſt knowledge, and alſo lying in an eſtate
of impenitencie againſt knowledge, and all other
particulars which have beene mentioned.
                        
                            Firſt then, to ſinne againſt the inbred light of nature,To ſin againſt the inbred light of nature.
that is, in ſuch ſinnes, as though thou hadſt
wanted the light of the word in, thou wouldſt have
knowne to be ſuch: This is a high kind of ſinning.
Such the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, Iude 10. What things
they know naturally, in theſe they corrupt themſelves,
as bruit beaſts, putting as it were no difference of
actions, no more than beaſts, no not in what nature
teacheth them, and therefore therein are as beaſts:
for it is the light of nature puts the firſt difference
betweene men and beaſts; and in ſuch kinde of
ſinnes the Apoſtle inſtanceth in this firſt Chapter, as
namely, that of unnaturall uncleanneſſe, in three
particulars: as 1. ſelf-uncleanneſſe, ver. 24. 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           ,
that is, alone by themſelves: ſo Beza and Theophilact
underſtand it, which he makes there the firſt degree
of unnaturall uncleanneſſe, which is therefore unnaturall,
becauſe thou deſtroyeſt that which nature
gave thee for propagation, quod perdis homo eſt.
Then 2. the uncleane love of boyes, men burning in
luſt with men, ver. 27. be it diſcovered in what dalliance
it will, though not ariſing to an act of Sodomie,

                           doing that which is unſeemely, ver. 27. which
hee therefore ſayes, is the perverting the uſe and intent
of nature, and ſo is a ſin againſt nature, leaving
the naturall uſe of women. My brethren, I am aſhamed
to ſpeak of ſuch things as are done in ſecret. Theſe
kind of ſinnes, by the Apoſtles ranking them, are
in a further degree of unnaturalneſſe, than any other,
becauſe they are made the puniſhments of
other ſinnes, which yet were againſt the light of nature
alſo: namely, not glorifying God when they
knew him: yet that being a ſinne, the light of nature
was not ſo clear in compariſon of theſe, therefore
theſe are made the puniſhments of the other,
as being more againſt nature. So for men to be
diſobedient to Parents, ſtubborne to them, and
without naturall affection, as the Apoſtle ſayes, ver.
30, 31. this is againſt nature, even the inſtinct of it.
So unthankfulneſſe, and requiting evill for good,
is againſt a common principle in mens mindes. Doe
not the Gentiles doe good to thoſe that do good to them?
your hearts uſe to riſe againſt ſuch an one out of
common humanity; or if you ſee one cruell and
unmercifull, which is another reckoned up, ver. 31.
there being uſually principles of pitty in all mens
natures, by nature; therefore for one man to prey
upon, and tyrannize over another, as fiſhes doe
over the ſmall ones, as Habakkuk complaineth,
this is againſt nature;Hab. 1. 14. which teacheth you to doe as
you would be done to. So covenant-breakers, and lying,
and forſwearing, mentioned ver. 30. inventers of
evill, and truce-breakers, are ſins againſt nature, and
natural light; lying is againſt a double light,

both morall; both juris, which tels us ſuch a thing
ought not to be done; and facti, whileſt we affirm
a thing that is not, the knowledge of the contrary
ariſeth up in us againſt, though there were no law
forbade it; therefore of all ſins elſe, the Devills
luſts are expreſſed by two; lying, which is a ſinne
in the underſtanding, and malice in the will, Iohn
8. 44.
                        
                            Secondly, to ſin againſt that light which thou
didſt ſuck in,To ſin againſt the light of education. when thou wert young, to ſin againſt
the light of thy education, this is an aggravation, and
a great one. There is a Catechiſme of a bleſſed mother
Bathſheba, which ſhee taught Solomon when a
child, put in among the records of ſacred Writ,
Prov. 31. wherein ſhe counſels him betimes, not to
give his ſtrength to women; ſhe foretold him of that
ſinne: and becauſe it is incident to Kings moſt, they
having all pleaſures at command, ſhe tells him particularly,
it deſtroyes Kings: and ſo alſo not to drink
wine, was another inſtruction there he was forewarned
of: this aggravated Solomons fault the more;
for reade the 2. Chapter of Eccleſiaſtes, and we ſhall
finde there, that hee was moſt guilty in the inordinate
love of theſe two; but hee had not beene
brought up ſo, his good mother had not thus inſtructed
him. And thus alſo when God would aggravate
his owne peoples ſin unto them, he recalls
them to their education in their youth in the wilderneſſe.
So Ierem. 2. 2. Goe and cry to them, Iremember
the kindneſſe and towardlineſſe of thy youth:
he puts them in mind of their education by Moſes
their Tutor, and their forwardneſſe then. And ſo

                           Hoſ. 12. when he was a child, I loved him; and then
God had their firſt fruits, ver. 3. this he brings to
aggravate their back-ſliding, ver. 5. Therefore the
Apoſtle urgeth it as a ſtrong argument to Timothie,
to goe on to perſevere in grace and goodneſſe, That
he had knowne the Scriptures from a child: and therefore
for him to fall, would be more hainous. The
reaſon is, becauſe the light then infuſed, it is the
firſt, a virgin light, as I may call it, which God in
much mercy vouchſafed to pre-poſſeſſe the minde
with, before it ſhould be deflowred and defiled
with corrupt principles from the world; and did
put it there to keep the mind chaſte and pure: and
this alſo then, when the minde was moſt ſoft and
tender, and ſo fitter to receive the deeper impreſſion
from it. And hence ordinarily the light ſuckt
in then, ſeaſons men ever after, whether it be for
good, or for evill; it fore-ſtalls, and pre-judgeth a
man againſt other principles: and though a man
comes to have more acquired knowledge and reaſons
after put into him when he is come to perfect
age, yet the ſmall light of his education, if it were
to the contrary, doth bias him, and keeps him fixt,
and bent that way. So we ſee it is in opinions about
Religion: the light then entertained, can never be
diſputed out: ſo in mens wayes and actions, Traine
up a child in his way, and he will not depart from it.
Prov. 22. 6. To ſin therefore againſt it, and to put
out the beames of it, or defile it, and to weare out
the impreſſions of it, how wicked is it, and what a
wretch art thou to do ſo?
                        Many of you young ſchollers have had a good

                           Bathſheba that inſtructed you, not to poure out your
ſtrength to drinke or women, but to pray privately,
and to feare God, and love him; and when you
come hither, you have good Tutors alſo, who teach
you to pray; Miniſters, who inſtill bleſſed truths
into you, from which, one would think, you ſhould
never depart; yet you doe.
                        Think how grievous this is; for if it is made an
excuſe for many a man in ſinning, that it anſwers
but his education; that he never knew or ſaw better,
as you ſay of many Papiſts; then muſt it needs
on the contrary, be an aggravation of ſinfulneſſe.
And as it was Timothies commendation, that hee
knew the Scriptures from a child, ſo it will be thy
condemnation, that thou kneweſt better from a
child, and yet rebelleſt againſt thy light.
                        
                            Thirdly, the more reall and experimentall the
light is,The more reall and experimentall light men ſin againſt. men ſinne againſt, ſtill the more ſinne; as
when they have learnt it from examples of godly
men, whom they have lived amongſt, or the obſervations
of Gods dealings with themſelves or
others, and not onely from the word notionally.
To ſinne againſt ſuch light, this addes a further degree;
not onely to ſinne againſt the bare light of
nature, but alſo further, when nature hath beſides
lighted her torch at the Scripture, and then when
beyond all this, the reall examples and obſervations
made of Gods dealings with a mans ſelfe and
others, ſhall confirme all this, this makes a mans
ſinfulneſſe much more grievous; for as exempla efficacius
docent quàm praecepta, ſo the knowledge got
by experiments of mercies or judgements, is of

more force and evidence. Knowledge learnt by
experience, is the moſt efficacious. Therefore Chriſt
himſelfe, who knew all things already, yet learnt
(in the ſchoole of experience) by what he ſuffered.
A little of ſome knowledge diſtill'd out of a mans
owne obſervation, is moſt precious, every drop of
it; therefore the Apoſtle urgeth it on Timothie,
2 Tim. 3. 14. Continue in the things thou haſt learned,
and beene aſſured of, knowing of whom thou haſt learned
them. There is a two-fold motive, and both
emphaticall; Firſt, he was aſſured in himſelfe; and
ſecondly, that which ſtrengthned that aſſurance,
and was a meanes to worke it, was the example of
the holy Apoſtle, and of his owne Parents, Knowing
of whom thou haſt learned it: And ſo ver. 10.
the Apoſtle againe urgeth his owne example, Thou
haſt fully knowne my doctrine and manner of life;
and then alſo brings to his mind the education of
thoſe his godly Parents, who inſtructed him. Hence
alſo, Eſay 26. 10. it is made an aggravation, that
in the land of uprightneſſe men deale unjuſtly. Thus
light drawn from the obſervation of Gods judgements
upon others, it much aggravates: it is laid
to Belſhazzars charge, Dan. 5. 22. Thou kneweſt all
this, how God dealt with thy father Nebuchadonezer.
So ſome of you come here, and live in a religious
ſociety, and ſee ſometimes one, ſometimes another
of thy Colleagues turn to Chriſt,The more ſhining the light is in the conſcience joyned with a taſte, the greater the ſin. yea haply chamber 
fellow converted from his evill courſes, and
yet thou goeſt on, this is ſinning againſt a great
light.
                        Fourthly, the more vigorous, ſtrong, powerfull

the light is that is in thee, and more ſtirring in thy
heart, and joyned with a taſte, the greater the ſins
committed againſt it are to be accounted. The more
thou haſt taſted the bitterneſſe of ſinne, and Gods
wrath, and haſt beene ſtung with it as with a Cockatrice,
the more thou haſt taſted Gods goodneſſe in
prayer, and in the ordinances, the more of ſuch a
knowledge, and yet ſinneſt the worſe. In the 5. of
Iohn, 35. Chriſt aggravates the Iewes unbeleefe in
himſelfe, and their preſent hardneſſe, that Iohn was
to them, not only a ſhining, but alſo a burning light;
that is, they had ſuch knowledge engendred by his
miniſtery, as wrought joy and heat, as well as
light; therefore it is added, they rejoyced therein
for a ſeaſon. And thus their fall, Heb. 6. is aggravated,
that it was ſuch a light as had taſting with it.
For to explaine this, you muſt know, that between
ordinary notionall light, or that aſſenting to ſpirituall
truths which is common with men, from traditionall
knowledge living in the Church, that between
it and true ſaving light, or the light of life, there is a
middle kind of light, which is more than the common
conviction men have, and leſſe than ſaving
light: it is a light which leaves alſo ſome impreſſion
on the affections, makes them feele the powers
of heaven and hell, and be affected with them. Now
the more of ſuch light againſt a ſinne, be it drunkenneſſe,
or uncleanneſſe, or oppreſſion, and yet
falleſt to it againe, the worſe. For this is a further
degree added to knowledg, and not common to all
wicked men. And therefore as thoſe Iewes, who
had not onely common meanes of knowledge,

but miracles alſo, and yet beleeved not, Iohn 12. 17.
ſhall be more condemned; ſo thoſe who have ſuch
taſting knowledg ſet on by the holy Ghoſt (which
is as much as if a miracle were wrought, for it is
above nature, a ſupernaturall worke of the Spirit.)
And therefore to ſinne againſt ſuch light, and ſuch
onely, is that which makes a man in the next
degree of fitneſſe to ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.
                        
                        Fiftly, to ſin againſt profeſſed knowledge, is an 
aggravation alſo,To ſin againſt profeſſed knowledge. and an heavy one. To ſin againſt
a mans owne principles which he teacheth others,
or reproves or cenſureth in others. Titus 1. laſt,
Thoſe that profeſſe they know God, and yet deny him,
theſe are moſt abominable of all others: For theſe
are lyars, and ſo ſinne againſt knowledge as lyars
doe, in the 1 Iohn 2. 4. ſuch an one is called a lyar
in a double reſpect, both in that he ſayes hee hath
that knowledge he hath not, it not being true; and
becauſe alſo he denyes that in deed, which he affirmes
in word, this is ſcandalous ſinning. So Rom.
2. 24. the Iewes beaſting of the law, and of having the
forme of knowledge in their braines, cauſed the Gentiles
to blaſpheme, when they ſaw they lived cleane
contrary thereunto: and therefore a brother that
walkes inordinately, was to be delivered to Satan,
to learne what it was to blaſpheme, 1 Tim. 2. 20. That
is, to learne to know how evill and bitter a thing it
is, by the torments of an evill conſcience, to live
in ſuch a courſe, as made God and his wayes evill
ſpoken of, as it befell David when he thus ſinned.
Yea 2 Cor. 5. 10, 11. though they might keep company
with a heathen, becauſe hee was ignorant,

and profeſſed not the knowledge of God; yet if a
brother, one that profeſſed, and ſo was to walke by
the ſame rules, did ſinne againſt thoſe principles he
profeſſed, then keepe him not company: Thus did
Saul ſinne. All the Religion he had and pretended
to in his latter dayes, was perſecuting witches: yet
in the end he went againſt this his principle; hee
went to a witch in his great extremitie at laſt. And
thus God will deale with all that are hollow, and
ſinne ſecretly againſt knowledge in the end. Hee
ſuffers them to goe againſt their moſt profeſſed
principles.
                        Theſe are aggravations in generall, applicable
both to any act of ſinning,
or going on in a
known ſtate of
ſinning.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     USE.
                     NOw the uſe of all that hath been ſpoken,How great an engagement &amp; motive it is to men of knowledge to turne to God, and to take heed of ſinning. what
is it, but to move all thoſe that have knowledge,
to take heed, more heed of ſinning than other
men? and thoſe of them that remaine in their naturall
eſtate, to turne ſpeedily and effectually unto
God? For if ſinning againſt knowledge be ſo great
an aggravation of ſinning, then of all engagements
to repentance, knowledge is the greateſt.
                     Firſt, thou who haſt knowledge, canſt not ſin ſo 
cheap as another,Such an one cannot ſin ſo cheap as others: their ſins are more coſtly and chargeable, who is ignorant: Therefore if
thou wilt be wicked, thy wickedneſſe will coſt thee
ten times more than it would another. Places of
much knowledge, and plentifull in the meanes of
grace, are dear places to live in ſin in. To be drunk,
and uncleane, after enlightning, and the motions of
the Spirit, and powerfull Sermons, is more than
twentie times afore; thou mighteſt have committed
ten to one, and beene damned leſſe. This is
condemnation (ſayes Chriſt) that light came into
the world.
                        and will have leſſe pleaſure in ſinning. Neither canſt thou haue ſo much pleaſure
in thy ſin as an ignorant perſon; For the conſcience
puts forth a ſting in the act, when thou haſt
knowledge, and does ſubject thee to bondage and
the fear of death. When a man knows how dearely
he muſt pay for it, there is an expectation of judgement
embittereth all. Therefore the Gentiles ſinned

with more pleaſure than we. Therefore Eph. 4.
18, 19. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of them, ſayes, that
through their ignorance, and darkneſſe, and want of
feeling, they committed ſin with greedineſſe, and ſo
with more pleaſure; they not having knowledge
or hearts ſenſible of the evils that attend upon their
courſes.
                     
                         Secondly, thou wilt in ſinning againſt knowledg
be given up to greater hardneſſe.
                        Such are given up to greater hardneſſe of heart. 
                        If the light that is
in thee be darkneſſe (ſayes Chriſt) how great is that
darkneſſe? therefore the more light a man hath,
and yet goes on in works of darkneſſe, the more
darkneſſe that man will be left unto, even to a reprobate
mind in the end.
                     
                         Thirdly, it will procure thee to be given up to
the worſt of ſins,Such God gives up to the worſt and groſſeſt of ſins. more than another man; for God
when he leaves men, makes one ſin the puniſhment
of another, &amp; reſerves the worſt for ſinners againſt
knowledge. Theſe Gentiles, when they knew God,
they worſhipped him not, God gave them up to the
worſt of ſinnes, whereof they were capable, as
unnaturall uncleanneſſe, &amp;c. But theſe are not ſinnes
great enough for thee, that art a ſinner of the
Chriſtians; to be given up to drunkenneſſe, or
adultery, &amp;c. otherwiſe than to diſcover thy rottenneſſe,
theſe are too ſmall ſins; but thou ſhalt be
given up to inward profaneneſſe of heart, (as Eſau
was, having been brought up in a good family) ſo
as not to neglect holy duties onely, but to deſpiſe
them; to deſpiſe the good word of God and his
Saints, and to hate godlineſſe and the appearance
of it; thou ſhalt be given up to contemne God and

his judgements, to trample under foot the blood of the
covenant, or elſe unto deviliſh opinions; thoſe other
are too ſmall to be puniſhments of thy ſinne: For
ſtil the end of ſuch an one muſt be ſeven times worſe
than the beginning, as Chriſt ſayes it ſhall; if thou
wert a drunkard, a ſwearer, or an uncleane perſon
before, and thy knowledge wrought ſome alteration
in thee, thou ſhalt not haply be ſo now at thy fal,
but ſeven times worſe; profane, injurious to Saints,
a blaſphemer, or derider of Gods wayes and ordinances.
                     Fourthly, when thou commoſt to lay hold on 
mercy at death,At death, knowledg ſinned againſt, gives up to more horror and deſpaire. thy knowledge will give thee up
to more deſpaire, than another man. Knowledge,
though when it is but newly revealed, it is an help;
yet not made uſe of, turns againſt the ſoul, to wound
it, and to work deſpaire; and this both becauſe we
have ſinned againſt the meanes that ſhould have ſaved
us, as alſo becauſe ſuch as ſinne againſt knowledge,
ſin with more preſumption; and the more
preſumption in thy life, the more deſpaire thou art
apt to fall into at death. Therefore Eſay 59. 11, 12.
what brought ſuch trouble, and roarings like Beares
upon theſe Jewes? and that when ſalvation was
looked for, that yet it was ſo far off from them, in
their apprehenſions? our iniquities (ſay they) teſtifie
to our face, and we know them. Now then ſins teſtifie
to our face, when our conſcience tooke notice
of them, even to our faces, when we were committing
them; and then alſo the ſame ſins themſelves
will againe teſtifie to our faces, when we have recourſe
for the pardon of them. Therefore thou wilt

lye roaring on thy death bed, and that thou knoweſt
them, will come as an argument, that thou ſhalt not
have mercie. As ignorance is a plea for mercie, I
did it ignorantly, therefore I obtained mercie; ſo I did
it knowingly, will come in as a bar and a plea againſt
thee, therefore I ſhall not have mercie.
                     
                         Fiftly,Hell it ineaſeth torent. both here and in Hell, it is the greateſt executioner
and tormenter. In this ſenſe it may be ſaid,
Qui auget ſcientiam, auget dolorem: He that increaſeth
knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow, as Solomon
ſpeaks: for knowledge enlargeth our apprehenſion
of our guilt, and that brings more feare and torment.
Have they no knowledge, who eate up my people?
Yes, there is their feare (ſayes David.) Therefore
Heb. 10. 28. after ſinning after knowledge, there remaines
not onely a more fearfull puniſhment, but a
more fearfull expectation in the parties conſciences.
And this is the worme in hell, that gnawes for ever.
Light breeds theſe wormes.
                     But then you will ſay, it is beſt for us to be ignorant,
and to keep our ſelves ſo.
                     I anſwer, no: For to refuſe knowledge will damn
as much as abuſing it. This you may ſee in Prov. 1.
23. Ye fooles (ſayes wiſedome) you that hate knowledge,
Turne, and I will poure my ſpirit upon you, and
make known my words to you. Well, ver. 24. they refuſed,
and would none of his reproof: Therefore ſayes
God, I will laugh at your calamitie: that is, I will
have no pitty, but inſtead of pitty, God will laugh
at you; and when your feare comes, I will not anſwer,
becauſe ye hated knowledge, ver. 29. ſo as this is as bad.
There remaines therefore no middle way of refuge,

to extricate thy ſelfe at, and avoid all this, no
remedy but turning unto God: otherwiſe thou canſt
not but be more miſerable than other men; yea and
this muſt be done ſpeedily alſo: For thou having
knowledge, God is quicker in denying thee grace,
and in giving thee up to a reprobate mind, than another
man, who is ignorant. He will wait upon another
that knows not his will &amp; waies, twenty, thirty,
forty yeares, as he did upon the children of the Iſraelites
that were borne in the wilderneſſe, and had
not ſeene his wonders in Egypt, and at the red ſea:
but thoſe that had, he ſoone ſware againſt many of
them, that they ſhould never enter into his reſt. Chriſt
comes as a ſwift witneſſe againſt thoſe to whom the
Goſpell is preached, Mal. 3. 5. he makes quick diſpatch
of the treaty of grace with them. Therefore
few that have knowledge are converted when they
are old, or that lived long under the meanes. And
therefore you that have knowledge, are engaged to
repent, and to turn to God, and to bring your hearts
to your knowledge, and that ſpeedily alſo, or elſe
your damnation will not only be more intolerable
than others, but the ſentence of it paſſe out more
quickly againſt you. Therefore as Chriſt ſayes, Ioh.
12. 36. Whilſt you have the light, walk in it: For that
day of Grace, which is very clear and bright, is uſually
a ſhort one. And though men may live many naturall
dayes after, and enjoy the common light of
the ſunne, yet the day of grace, and of gracious excitements
to repent, may be but a ſhort one.

OF SINNING
AGAINST MERCIE.
                  
                     ROM. 2. 4, 5.
                     Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe, and forbearance,
and long ſuffering, not knowing that
the goodneſſe of God leadeth thee to repentance?
But after thy hardneſſe and impenitent heart, treaſureſt
up unto thy ſelfe wrath againſt the day of
wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgement
of God?
                  
                  
                     THis is the laſt &amp; moſt weighty
aggravation which the
Apoſtle puts into the meaſure
of the Gentiles ſinfulneſſe
(which in the former
Chapter he had, verſe 29.
pronounced full before) to
make it fuller yet: Their ſinning againſt mercies,
                     
and deſpiſing the riches of Gods goodneſſe, patience,
and forbearance, the hatefull evill and iniquity
whereof, can be better no way ſet off and
illuſtrated unto mens conſciences, than by a
diſplay of the riches of that goodneſſe which
mea ſinne againſt. My purpoſe therefore is to
unlock and carry you into that more common
treaſury of outward mercies, and leade you
through the ſeverall roomes thereof, all which
doe continually leade you unto repentance: That
then reflecting upon our ungratefull waſte, and
abuſe of ſo many mercies in ſinning, thereby
our ſins, every ſinne, the leaſt, may yet appeare
more ſinfull unto us, who are leſſe than the leaſt of
all thoſe mercies. Know then, that beſides that
peculiar treaſure of unſearchable riches of grace
laid up in Chriſt (the offer of which neglected
and deſpiſed,Epheſ. 2. 7. addes yet to all that ſinfulneſſe, a
guilt as farre exceeding all that which ſhall be
ſpoken of, as Heaven exceeds the Earth) There
is another untold Mine of Riches the Earth is full
of,
                     Pſal. 104. 24. as the Pſalmiſt tells us, and the Apoſtle here,
which theſe Gentiles onely heard of, and which
we partake of all as much as they. As there are
riches of grace offered to you which can never be
exhauſted; ſo there are riches of patience ſpent
upon you, which you will have ſpent out in the
end; the expence of which, caſt up, will alone
amount to an immenſe treaſure, both of guilt in
you, and of wrath in God, as theſe words informe
us.
                  
                     
To helpe you in this account, I will
                  1. In generall, ſhew what Goodneſſe, or Bounty,
Patience, and long ſuffering are in God.
                  2. That there are riches of theſe ſpent upon
all the ſons of men.
                  3. That theſe all leade men to repentance. And
then
                  4. I will expoſtulate with you, and aggravate
your ſinfulneſſe, in going on to deſpiſe all theſe by
unrepentance, as the Apoſtle here doth.
                  Firſt, in that God is ſaid here to be Good, or
Bountifull: 2. Patient, or forbearing: 3. Longſuffering,
they ſeeme to note out three degrees
of his common mercies unto men.
                  Firſt, he is a good, or a bountifull God: for ſo,
as goodneſſe is here uſed, I exegetically expound
it: For though it be true, that goodneſſe and bounty
may differ; yet when riches of goodneſſe are
ſaid to be communicated, it imports the ſame,
and is all one with Bounty; And ſuch is God.
And all thoſe noble and royall qualifications and
properties which concurre to make one truely
good, and bountifull, doe meet and abound in him,
in all thoſe good things which he doth beſtow;
and are found truly in none but in him: ſo that it
may be truly ſaid, that there is none good but God,
as Chriſt ſayes of him.
                  Now Bounty, in the generall, which is in God,
may be thus deſcribed:
                  It is a free, willing, and a large giving of what is
meerly his own, looking for no recompenſe againe.
                  
                     
To explaine this, that you may ſee, that all
theſe conditions are required to true goodneſſe,
and all of them to be found in God onely.
                  1. He that is Bountifull, he muſt be a Giver,
and Beſtower of good things: and all he beſtows,
it muſt be by way of gift, not by way of recompence
unto, or by deſert from the party hee beſtowes
all on:Luke 6. 33. Therefore Chriſt ſayes, Luke 6.
33. that to doe good to thoſe who have done, or doe
good to us, is not thank-worthy, nor is it Bounty. But
God is therefore truely good, becauſe hee ſimply,
meerely, and abſolutely gives away all
which he beſtowes: For hee was not, nor can
any way become beholden to any of his creatures;
nor had formerly received any thing from
them,Rom. 11. 35. which might move him hereunto: ſo Rom.
11. 35. Who hath firſt given him, that hee may recompence
him againe? Nay untill He gave us a being,
we were not capable of ſo much as receiving
any good thing from him.
                  2. He who is truly termed Good, or Bountifull,
all that he gives away muſt be his owne;
                     Pſal. 24. 1. And ſo
all which God beſtowes, it is his owne. So Pſal.
24. 1. The Earth is the Lords. The ground wee
tread on, the place wee dwell in; Hee is our
Landlord. But is that all? for the houſe may be
the Landlords, when the furniture is the Tenants:
therefore he further addes, And the fulneſſe of it
is his alſo: that is, all the things that fill the world,
all the furniture,Pſal. 50. 11, 12. and proviſion of it both; all the
moveables. (So Pſal. 50. 11, 12.) The cattell and

the fowles upon a thouſand hills are mine, ſayes hee;
and alſo all the ſtanding goods, the corne and
oile (which you ſet and plant) are mine, Hoſ. 2. 9.
yea and the Pſalmiſt in the ſame 24. Pſalme, adds
further, that they who dwell therein are his alſo:
not the houſe and furniture onely, but the Inhabitants
themſelves. And this, by the moſt ſure,
and moſt ſoveraigne title that can be, better than
that of purchaſe, or inheritance, of and from
another: for he hath made them; All is thine,
becauſe all comes of thee,
                     1 Chron. 29. ſayes the ſame David,
1 Chron. 29. 11, 12. And all things are not onely
[of him] but [through him] Rom. 11. 36. that is,
they cannot ſtand nor ſubſiſt without him. Even
Kings, (the greateſt and moſt bountifull of men)
their bounty is but as that of the clouds, which
though they ſhowre down plentifully, yet they
firſt received all from the Earth below them.
                  3. He muſt give largely, it is not Bounty elſe.
Now God is therefore ſaid to be rich in goodneſſe,
becauſe he is abundant in it. So we finde it, comparing
Pſal. 33. 5. with Pſal. 104. 24. in which
it is ſaid, that the earth is full of his goodneſſe, and
his riches; which we may judge of, by what he
ſayes in the 27. verſe of that 104. Pſalme, of
what an houſe he keepes, and what multitudes he
feeds: All theſe (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) wait on thee,
that thou mayeſt give them meat, and thou openeſt
thy hand, and they are filled with good. King Ahaſuerus,
to ſhew his bounty, made a Feaſt to his
chiefe Subjects, but it was but for halfe a yeare,

and not to all: ſome few halfe yeeres more would
well nigh have beggard him; but God doth thus
continually. The greateſt and moſt bountifull of
men, when they would expreſſe the largeſt of
their bounty, ſpeake but of giving halfe of their
Kingdomes, (ſo Herod, and he did but talk ſo too)
But God beſtowes whole worlds, and Kingdomes,
as Daniel ſpeakes, Dan. 4. 35. and gives them to
whom he pleaſe.
                  
                  4. He that is bountifull, muſt give all he gives
freely, and willingly. Which, though I put together,
yet may imply two diſtinct things: As firſt,
that he that gives, muſt be a free agent in it, who
is at his choice, whether he would give any thing
away or no. The Sunne doth much good to the
world, it affords a large light, and even halfe the
world at once is full of its glory: yea and all this
light is its owne, not borrowed, as that of the
Moone and Starres is; yet this Sunne cannot be
called good or bountifull, becauſe it ſends forth
this light neceſſarily, and naturally; and cannot
chooſe but doe ſo; nor can it draw in its beames.
But God is a free giver, he was at his choice, whether
he would have made the world or no; and
can yet when hee pleaſeth, with-draw his Spirit
and face,
                     Pſal. 104. 29. 
                     and then they all periſh, Pſal. 104. 29.
Secondly, it muſt be willing by alſo: that is, no
way conſtrained, nor by extraction wrung from
him, who is to be called Bountifull. A willing
mind in matter of bounty, is more accepted than
the thing, 2 Cor. 8. 12. Now of God it is ſaid,

                     Dan. 4. 22. that he gives the Kingdomes of the
world to whom he will, and none ſwayes him, or
can ſtay his hand, ver. 35. yea hee gives all away
with delight. So Pſal. 104. 31. having ſpoken of
feeding every living thing, and of other the like
works of his goodneſſe, throughout that Pſalme,
hee concludes with this, God rejoyceth in all his
workes: that is, doth all the good he doth to his
creatures with delight; It doth him good (as it
were) to ſee the poore creatures feed.
                  Laſt of all, looking for no recompence for the
time to come. This is another requiſite in Bounty.
Sayes Chriſt,Luke 6. 34. 
                     Luke 6. 34. If you give to receive
againe, as ſinners doe, this is not thank-worthy: but
ver. 35. ſo doth not your heavenly Father: For
(ſayes he) Doe good, and hope for nothing againe,
ſo ſhall you be like your Father, and then you ſhall
ſhew your ſelves true children of the [moſt High.]
In which word, he inſinuates a reaſon why God
gives all thus: becauſe he is ſo great, and ſo High
a God, as nothing wee doe can reach him; as
David ſpeaks,Pſal. 16. 2. 
                     Pſal. 16. 2. My goodneſſe extends
not unto thee: he is too high to receive any benefit
by what we doe. And even that thankfulneſſe he
exacts, he requires it but as an acknowledgement
of our duty, and for our good, Deut. 10. 12.
                  And ſo much for the firſt, namely, what goodneſſe
and bounty is: and how God is truely good,
and he onely ſo. But this attribute of his, and the
effects of it, he exerciſeth towards all our fellow
creatures, and did to Adam in Paradiſe. But

now to us ward (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) namely
the ſons of men, now fallen, hee extendeth and
manifeſts a further riches, namely, of patience
and long-ſuffering, which the devills partake not
of, the good Angels and other creatures: that
ſinned not, are uncapable of. For as Chriſt ſayes,
Luke 6. 35.Luke 6. 35. In what he beſtowes on us, he is kind
to ſuch, as are evill and unthankfull. Mercy is
more than goodneſſe, for mercy alwaies doth reſpect
miſery: and becauſe all the creatures are
ſubject to a miſery, Rom. 8. 20, 21, 22. of bondage
and vanity, therefore his tender mercies are over
all his workes. But yet patience is a further thing
than mercy, (as mercy is than goodneſſe) being exerciſed,
not towards miſerable creatures onely,
but towards ſinners, and includes in it more three
things further towards them.
                  1. Not only that thoſe perſons he doth good
unto do offend, and injure him; but that himſelf
alſo is exceeding ſenſible of all thoſe wrongs, and
moved by them, and alſo provoked to wrath
thereby; it is not patience elſe. So in the 2. of
Pet. 3. 9. It is not ſlackneſſe (ſayes he there:) God
is not ſlack: that is, he ſits not in heaven as one of
the Idol gods, that regarded not what acts were
kept here below; or took not to heart mens carriages
towards him; but is long-ſuffering, or patient;
that is, he apprehends himſelfe wronged,
is fully ſenſible of it; is angry with the wicked every
day,
                     Pſal. 7. 11. 
                     Pſal. 7. 11. he hath much adoe to forbear,
even when he doth forbeare, and letteth them

alone; he exerciſeth an attribute, a vertue towards
them, namely, patience, in keeping in of
his anger; which is as to keepe fire in ones boſome.
                  But ſecondly, this is not all; he doth not ſimply
forbeare, and reſtraine his anger, but vouchſafeth
that time he forbeares them in, that they
might repent in it; and his mercies, as meanes leading
to repentance. So it followes in that 2 Pet.
3. 9. But God is long ſuffering to us-ward, and his
long ſuffering hath this in it, not willing that any
ſhould periſh, but come unto repentance. So alſo
Revel. 2. 21. it is called ſpace to repent.
                     Revel. 2. 21. And all the
bleſſings he vouchſafeth, he gives them as means
and guides to leade them on to repentance, as here.
And Mat. 18. 29.Mat. 18. 29. Have patience with me, and I
will pay thee all. That is, give me a longer day
and ſpace to pay the debt in, and be willing to
accept it when I bring it, and let me lye out of
priſon, that I may be enabled to pay it.
                  Thirdly, there is yet a further thing in his patience,
namely, a waiting, and expectation that
men would come in,Luke 13. 17. and repent. So Luke 13. 17.
Theſe three yeeres have I [come ſeeking] fruit, but
have found none: There was an expectation, a
longing, a deſire it would bring forth fruit, Oh
when ſhall it once be, ſayes God, Ier. 13. laſt?
                  In the laſt place, that other attribute of long
ſuffering, which is the third, is but as a further
degree of patience; but patience lengthened out farther,
that is, when God hath beene thus patient,
                     
hath forborne and waited for their comming in,
and that not for three yeeres, but haply thirty,
forty yeeres, and ſtill they turne not; his patience
then begins (as we would think) to be (as it were)
worne out, and his anger begins to ariſe, as if he
could forbeare no longer; (as it was towards
that tree, Why cumbereth it the ground? Cut it
downe) yet hee goes on to ſpare a man another
yeere, and many more yeares ſtill after that; and
endureth with much long ſuffering (as Rom. 9. 22.)
the veſſels of wrath, endures to wonderment,
above meaſure, beyond all expectation, all patience,
as it were; this is long ſuffering.
                  
                  The ſecond generall head is, that there are
[riches] of this his goodneſſe, &amp;c. expended on
us.
                  It is a rich goodneſſe, patience and long ſuffering:
Rich in themſelves, in regard of their abundance,
as they came from him: and rich alſo in
regard of their precious uſefulneſſe unto us, as they
may be improved by us.
                  Firſt, in themſelves they are rich: if wee conſider
what is expended, all that while, Hee layes
out, not ſimply his power to ſuſtain and uphold
all things, and to maintaine us freely: ſo to doe
is nothing to him. For whilſt he doth but ſo, nothing
goes out of purſe, or is detracted from him;
(as I may ſo ſpeak) he feeles not the expence either
of power, providence, &amp;c. All this coſt him
but words: For he upholds all, creates all by the
word of his power,
                     Heb. 1. 
                     Hebr. 1. And thus to maintaine

the Angels, and to have maintained all mankinde
before they fell, had beene no more. But (my
brethren) when now he maintains us ſinners, not
ſimply power goes forth from him, but his glory
is expended, and taken from him, and for the
while waſted, detracted from; he loſeth, at preſent,
every day infinitely by us, and he is ſenſible
of it; every ſinne takes glory from him, robs him,
as he himſelfe complaines: that he who made the
world, upholds it, (keeps it together, as the hoops
doe the barrell, it would fall to pieces elſe, to
nothing; in whom all live, as fiſhes in the Sea, yea
upon whom all live) that He ſhould live unknown,
                     Iohn 1. 10.
unthought of, unſerved; yea diſgraced, diſhonoured
in the world, and have this world loſt to
him, as it were; and ſinne, the Devill, wicked
men, to have all the glory from him, to be exalted,
to carry the whole world afore them: This
ſpends upon him, he had need of Riches to doe
this.
                  Secondly, conſider the multitude of ſinners,
that thus ſpend, and live upon theſe riches, no
leſſe than all the world: Hee had need of multitudes
of patience in him: He forbeares not one,
but all and every one. We looke upon one man,
and ſeeing him very wicked, wee wonder God
cuts him not off; we wonder at our ſelves, that
God did not cut us off before this, when once
our eyes are opened: nay then caſt your eyes
over all the world, and ſtand amazed at Gods
forbearance towards it. Take the richeſt man

that ever was, to have millions of men in his
debt, it would undoe him ſoone. All the world
are in Gods debt, and run ſtill in debt every day
more and more, and yet he breaks not, nay breaks
not them.
                  Nay thirdly, to manifeſt this abundance yet
more, conſider not onely the multitude hee forbeares,
but the time he hath done it: to forbeare
much, and to forbeare it long: he hath forborne,
and beene out of purſe from the beginning of the
world, ſince men were upon the face of the earth,
five thouſand yeeres and a halfe already; and
how long it is yet to the day of Judgement, wee
know not: And yet ye ſee, He is as patient, and
as bountifull now in the latter dayes of the
world, as he was at the firſt. Did that greateſt
Convert that ever was, that had not lived paſt
thirty yeeres in his ſinfull eſtate (for he was young
when he held the ſtoners clothes that ſtoned Stephen)
and yet was the chiefeſt of ſinners, did he yet
(as himſelfe ſayes) thinke himſelfe a patterne of
long ſuffering,
                     1 Tim. 1. 16. 1 Tim. 1. 16. though it a great
matter God ſhould forbeare ſo long? what is the
whole world then? if he, being but one ſmall
poore veſſell, was ſo richly laden with the riches
of Gods patience, how is this great bark of the
world then fraught, that hath gone over ſo vaſt a
gulfe of time? how much of theſe his riches
have been laden in it?
                  And then fourthly, adde to this the expenſive
prodigality of all theſe ſinners in all ages; every

ſinner ſpends ſomething, and how laviſh are men
of oathes? All the thoughts of mens hearts from
their youth up, they are evill, and onely evill, and continually:
and how much then hath every man
ſpent him? every ſin is a debt.
                  In the ſecond place, this is a rich goodneſſe
and patience in regard of the preciouſneſſe and
uſefulneſſe.
                  
                  Firſt, precious, in regard of what all theſe manifeſtations
of his goodneſſe and forbearance
coſt,2 Pet. 3. 1. even the blood of his Sonne, who as a Lord
hath bought and purchaſed all wicked men; their
lives, and their reprivall, all that time that here
they live; and all the bleſſings and diſpenſations
of goodneſſe, which here they do enjoy. Chriſts
mediation ſo far prevailes with God for all the
world, that it puts a ſtop to the preſent proceedings
of juſtice, which otherwiſe had ſaid of all,
that day thou ſinneſt, thou dyeſt. So that as Chriſt
may be called the wiſdome and the power of God;
ſo alſo the patience and the long ſuffering of God.
For, for his ſake, and through his meanes, it is
exerciſed: God would not ſhew a drop of mercy,
but for his Sonne. Which, I take, ſtrongly
and clearly intimated, in that dealing of his, with
the Jewes, (Exod. 23. 20. compared with Exod.
33. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. Immediately after God had given
the Law, (by the rules and threatnings
whereof, God the Father in his government was
to proceed) and after they had tranſgreſſed it, He
there declares, that he could not goe with them:
                     
                        〈1 page missing〉
                     
                     
reſted thee, and told thee, this world was no place
for thee,Acts 1. 25. for hell is onely our owne place, Acts 1.
25. thou ſhouleſt have beene executed the firſt
day. And is not ſo much time of eaſe from puniſhment
infinite mercy? Caſt but your thoughts
upon the Angels that fell, that have been in hell
from the firſt moment of their ſinning, doe but
thinke with your ſelves, what they would give to
have ſo much time, cut out of that eternity, they
are to run through, &amp; to have it ſet apart for eaſe,
and to be void of torment; if the rich man in
hell, made it ſuch a great ſuit, and counted it ſo
great a favour to have but one drop of water
(which could but for a little while (ſcarce more
than a moment) have cooled and eaſed, not his
whole body, but the tip of his tongue only) how
much more would he have thought it mercy, to
have lived ſo many yeares againe as he had done
free from torment? what is it then for thee, to
live ſo many yeares free from the falling of the
leaſt drop of that wrath, whereof the full vialls
ſhould have been poured out many yeares agoe?
The ſame Law was out againſt us, which was out
againſt the Angels;2 Pet. 3. 9. 
                     That day thou eateſt, thou
ſhalt dye the death: what put the difference? the
Apoſtle tells us, his long ſuffering to us ward: not
to them: for in Chap. 2. 4. he had told us that
hee ſpared not the Angels which fell, but poſted,
and threw them into hell, as ſoone as they had
ſinned.
                  Sixtly, But further, in the 6. place; Is this all?

hath it beene barely a time of eaſe given thee, a
time of reprivall? No, it hath beene more, ſpace
to repent, and ſo to obtaine thy pardon in, Rev.
2. 21. And as it hath beene more than eaſe of torment
unto thee, ſo alſo conſider it hath beene
more than ſlackneſſe in him that hath afforded it
to thee, as the Apoſtle there doth tell us. It is
not that he hath tooke no notice of thy offending
him, but he is ſenſible of every idle thought, of
every oath, vaine word, and as the Scripture tels
us, he is pained at the very heart, in ſo much as he
repents that ever he made thee;Gen. 6. he is angry with
thee every day thou riſeſt, every time hee lookes
on thee, when ever he meets thee going into the
Taverne to be drunk, the whorehouſe to be uncleane,
when he meets thee reeling in the ſtreets,
he hath much adoe to forbeare killing thee, as
he had to forbeare Moſes when he met him in
the Inne: He is ready to have a blow at thee, and
it ſhould not need be any great ſtroake, or fetching
his arme about; if he did but blow on thee,
thou wert conſumed. To ſuffer thee to live, doth
therefore coſt him much riches of patience; but
to cut thee off, need coſt him nothing: hee can
doe that with eaſe. But further, all is joyned with
a willingneſſe that thou ſhouldſt repent, and not
periſh, as that place tells thee. It were much
mercy for a Traytor to be reprived, to have a
leaſe of his life for twenty yeeres, though there
were no hope nor meanes of obtaining his finall
pardon after that time ſpent, and this alſo, though

moneth, a yeere? what others, who have laine
gaſping, would have given a world for time againe,
(as I have heard one crying day and
night (call time againe) or if not then, oh what
in Hell:
                  The third thing I am to ſhew, is, that all this
goodneſſe, patience, and forbearance, is afforded towards
you as a meanes, and helpes to bring you
to repentance.Acts 17. 26, 27, 28. 
                     Acts 17. 26, 27, 28. God (ſayes
the Apoſtle there) hath allotted to men, both their
times to live in, and alſo their places of abode and
habitations, all richly furniſhed with bleſſings to
uphold their lives &amp; beings. And to what end are
both theſe thus afforded? That they might ſeek
the Lord, if by groping after him (even as men in
the darke) they might haply finde him. But men
being in the darke, and deſtitute of guides to
bring thē unto God, may yet be as far of finding
him as ever. Therefore adde but the words of
my text, to what the Apoſtle ſayes there, and we
ſee, that this goodneſſe of God takes us by the
hand, and leads us to repentance; to turne from
ſinne unto God, and ſo to finde him. And thus
lead are you unto God, by the help of three ſeverall
guides, which each after other ſweetly leade
you, and point you out to this.
                  Firſt, all this goodneſſe beares witneſſe to
your hearts of a gracious hand that extends it ſelf
in all theſe; therefore in that 17. of the Acts,
he ſubjoynes, God is not far off any of us. That
there is a good God beſtowes all things on you,

is a thought lyes at next doore of all his bleſſings,
not far off. Yea they all (ſayes the Apoſtle
to the ſame Gentiles,Acts 14. 16. 
                     Acts 14. 16.) doe beare witneſſe
of him, (though they went on in their owne
wayes) yet (ſayes he there) God left not himſelfe
without witneſſe; that is, an impreſſion on their
hearts that his good hand beſtowed all on them,
when he filled their hearts with foode and gladneſſe.
                  
                  Secondly, His goodneſſe having brought thus
God to mens thoughts, then your owne conſciences
take you, and leade you downe into your
ſelves, and beare witneſſe, that you by walking
in your owne wayes, doe nothing but provoke
and offend this good God. So Rom. 2. 15.
                  And then thirdly, there is an indelible principle
common to all men to love thoſe who love
them;
                     Luke 6. which after the two former have brought
you hitherto, point, you to Repentance, as the
concluſion. [Shall we goe on to ſinne againſt this
good, ſo good? returne evill for good?] Is not this
a naturall neceſſary conſequent out of all theſe,
to ſay as they, Let us therefore feare the Lord, who
giveth us the early and the latter raine,
                     Ier. 5. 26, 27. as it is Ier.
5. 26, 27? And though men are ſaid not to know
this, in the text, yet the meaning is, they doe not
throughly and effectually conſider thus much, ſo
as thereby to be brought to Repentance, yet
however there is ſuch a witneſſe of all this in all
mens hearts, and thus are they led on unto Repentance,
would they ſee their way and follow
their guide.
                  
                     
The uſe ſhall be an uſe of expoſtulation (as
here the Apoſtle carryes it) with men ſinfull and
impenitent, for going on to ſinne againſt all this
mercy; together with an aggravation of their
ſinfulneſſe hereby. Men, if young, doe uſually
take the advantage of this their precious time,
(which out of ſo much long ſuffering is vouchſafed
them) and of all thoſe precious opportunities,
and bleſſings they enjoy, to improve them
onely, in reaping and gathering in to themſelves
the pleaſures of ſinne; making the time of youth
their harveſt of ſinning, and yet thinke to eſcape
by repenting, afterwards: and then when old,
after they have already enjoyed a long and a
faire Sunſhine day to turne to God in, and to
have ſowne much ſeed to the Spirit, the comfort
whereof they might now have reaped; yet as
they have altogether neglected ſo to doe all their
youth, ſo they goe on to doe ſo ſtill, whilſt they
ſee they have any day left, be it never ſo neare
the ſetting; and doe chooſe rather deſperately
to venture their eſtate in the world to come, upon
the riches of his mercy pardoning, (though
without all care and endeavour to change their
hearts or lives) upon the experience they have
had of the riches of his mercy forbearing them
in this world, thinking to finde him the ſame in
both. With all ſuch, let me reaſon a little, and
from the riches of Gods goodneſſe, patience, &amp;c.
ſpent upon them, at once expoſtulate with them,
for their impenitency, and aggravate to them

their ſinfulneſſe, and alſo, if poſſible, prevail with
them to goe on to deſpiſe it thus no longer. And
if there be any principle of common ingenuity,
any ſparke (I doe not ſay of grace, but of goodneſſe
of nature) left unextinguiſht, me thinkes it
ſhould affect you, and doe ſome good on youere
I have done.
                  And to that end, conſider a little, and compare
together Gods loving kindneſſes towards you,
and your unkind dealings towards him.
                  To begin at the very beginning of thy being:
how much riches of goodneſſe were there laid
and buried in thy foundation? when the firſt corner
ſtone was laid, when thou wert made a man,
(beſides the coſt which hath beene ſpent upon
this building ſince) and, curſed as thou art, even
that very foundation was laid in bloody iniquities,
in which thou wert conceived; and the very
materialls of ſoule and body, thou conſiſteſt of,
being tempered with ſinne,Hab. 2. 10, 11. 
                     like the ſtone in the
wall, and beame out of the timber, cry out every
moment to God againſt thee,Pſal. 137. 7. as Edom did, Raſe
it, raſe it, even to the very ground.
                  
                  Conſider how but the other day thou were
meere nothing, and when an infinite number that
never were nor ſhall be, were in as great a poſſibility
of being as thou, (for when he made this
world, he could have laid it aſide wholly, and
created millions of otherworlds) yet he choſe
thee to have a roome in this, but one world, (for
he means to make no more) and this world could

have ſtood without thee, and did before thou
wert, and ſhall doe when thou art gone: yet he
called thee forth out of nothing, and by his Almighty
power, bade thee ſtand forth when there
was no need of thee. I ſay he choſe thee to have
a being: for as there is an election of things that
are to ſalvation, ſo out of things that were not
unto being. And wretch that thou art, if thou repenteſt
not, thou deſtroyeſt what God hath
made, and hadſt better have kept nothing ſtill,
and never have peept out, or elſe to skulk into thy
firſt nothing againe, for thou art loſt, better never
to have beene borne.
                  
                  Secondly, Conſider yet more goodneſſe. Thou
mighteſt have beene admitted into the loweſt
forme of creatures, have beene a worme, a flea,
a flye, which we men fillip and cruſh to death at
pleaſure: but to be made a Man, created one of
the States, Barons, Lords of the world the firſt
houre, admitted into the higheſt order, crowned
a King in the wombe, as David ſayes of man,
Pſal. 8. 5. made a little lower than the Angels,
                     Pſal. 8. 5. but
crowned with glory and honour; made to have
dominion over all the works of his hands. The one
halfe of thee is more worth than a whole world,
[thy ſoule] as Chriſt ſayes, that went to the
price of ſoules; upon which God hath beſtowed
an eternity of being, and made it the picture of his
face, his Image, when other creatures do weare
but his footſteps. And thy body the other peece,
and indeed but the Caſe, the Sheath, (as Daniels
                     
phraſe and the Chaldee hath it, Dan. 7. 15.) of
thee, what a curious workmanſhip is it? wonderfully
and fearfully made,
                     Pſal. 139. 15. as David ſayes, Pſalm.
139. 15. curiouſly wrought in the lower parts of the
earth: So there he calls the womb; becauſe as
curious workmen, when they have ſome choice
piece in hand, perfect it in private, and then
bring it forth to light for men to gaze at: So
God out of a teare, a drop, he hath limmed out
the Epitome of the whole world; the Index of
all the creatures.Eccl. 12. 2. 
                     Sunne, moone, ſtarres, are to be
found in thee. And yet wretch as thou art, thou
art withall the Epitome of hell, and broughteſt
into the world with thee, the ſeeds and principles
of all the villanies, that have beene acted in
the world, and if thou repenteſt not, thou hadſt
better have beene a toad, or ſerpent, the hatefulleſt
of creatures; and wouldſt change thy condition
with them one day.
                  Thirdly, being a man, haſt thou all thy members
that belong unto a man? it is becauſe hee
wrote them all in his booke, Pſal. 139. 16. if he had
left out an eye in his common-place booke, thou
hadſt wanted it; is not that a mercy? aske the
blinde. If thou hadſt wanted thoſe windows to
looke out at, thy body would have beene a dungeon,
the world a priſon. If a Tongue (which is
thy glory) or an eare, thou hadſt lived among
men, as a beaſt among men. And yet when God
gave thee all theſe, what did he but put weapons
into an enemies hand? for haſt thou not uſed all

theſe,Rom. 6. 
                     as weapons of unrighteouſneſſe? Inſomuch
as the tongue, but one member, is called a world of
iniquity by the Apoſtle; and if thou repenteſt
not, thou hadſt better (as Chriſt ſayes) have entred
into the world without an eye, an care,
a tongue, than with theſe goe for ever into
hell.
                  Fourthly, when thou wert taken out of the
wombe, (where thou didſt remaine, but whileſt
thou wert a framing) what a ſtately palace hath
he brought thee into, [the world] which thou
findeſt prepared, and ready furniſht with all
things for thy maintenance, as Canaan was to the
Children of Iſrael; a ſtately houſe thou buildeſt
not, trees thou plantedſt not, a rich Canopy
ſpangled, ſpread as a Curtaine over thy head;
he ſets up a Taper for thee to work by [the Sun]
till thou art weary,
                     Pſal. 104. 23. 
                     Pſal. 104. 23. and then it goes
down without thy bidding, for it knows its going
downe, ver. 19. and then he drawes a curtain over
halfe the world, that men may goe to reſt, thou
cauſeſt darkneſſe, and it is night, ver. 20. An houſe
this world is, ſo curiouſly contrived, that to every
roome of it, even to every poore village,
ſprings doe comes as pipes to finde thee water. So
Pſal. 104. 10, 11.Pſal. 104. 10, 11. The pavement of which houſe
thou treadeſt on, brings forth thy food, ver. 14.
Bread for ſtrength, wine to cheere thy heart, oyle
to make thy face to ſhine, ver. 15. Which three are
there ſynecdochically put for all things needfull
to ſtrength, ornament, and delight. The very

                     chambers of that houſe (as David calls them)
drop fatneſſe, and water the earth, ver. 13. Hee
wheeles the heavens about, and ſo ſpins out time
for thee, every moment of which time brings
forth ſome bleſſing or other, and no one is barren.Pſal. 65. 11.
Therefore Pſal. 65. 11. the yeere is ſaid to be
crowned with goodneſſe: a diadem of goodneſſe
encircles it round: and yet thou haſt filled this
world thou thus art brought into, with nothing
but rebellions, as hee hath done with bleſſings,
and haſt piled up ſins to heaven; and thou haſt
preſſed all theſe armies of bleſſings thou findeſt
the world filled with, to fight againſt their Maker,
under the devills banner, whom thy wickedneſſe
ſets up as the god of this world. And as the
yeere is crowned with goodneſſe, ſo thy yeeres
with wickedneſſe, and no moment is barren; but
all thy imaginations are evill continually. Yea thou
haſt ſinned againſt heaven and earth, and ſubjected
the whole creation unto vanity, laden the earth,
and filled it ſo with wickedneſſe, that it groanes,
the axeltree of it is even ready to crack under
thee, and the ground thou treadeſt on to ſpue
thee out.
                  
                  Fiftly, ſince thou cameſt into the world, what
a long time hath God ſuffered thee to live in it?
hee hath not ſpared thee three yeares onely, (as
he did the figtree) but thirty, forty. And when
thou firſt madeſt bold to thruſt forth thy trayterous
head into the world, Death (which thy ſin
brought into the world with it) might have arreſted

                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
but for one treaſon, and though all that time of
his reprivall he carryes and behaves himſelfe never
ſo obediently. But unto thee, this time hath
beene more than a longer day of life, and putting
off the execution (which for the guilt of that firſt
rebellion ſhould have been acted on thee in the
womb) it hath beene time to repent in: And yet
hath not this time of thy reprivall made thee ſo
much the more rebellious? and haſt not thou
ſpent all this time in making up the meaſure of
thine iniquity full? and hath it beene will ingneſſe
onely in God that thou ſhouldeſt not periſh?
yea more, joyned with waiting alſo, when it
ſhould once be, thinking the time long, as longing
and deſiring that thou wouldſt repent, that he
might pardon thee. Thus Ierem. 13. laſt, God
expreſſeth himſelfe, when ſhall it once be? yea
and conſider how many dayes of payment have
been ſet, and how many promiſes made, and broken
all by thee, and yet ſtill hee walteth unto
wonderment. Thou receiuedſt preſſe money at
thy Baptiſme, when thou didſt promiſe to forſake
the devill and all his workes, and to begin to
ſerve him, when thou ſhouldſt begin to diſcerne
betweene good and evill. But no ſooner did the
light of knowledge dawne in thy heart, but thou
beganſt to fight againſt him; and thy firſt
thoughts to this day have beene onely and continually
evill. And then (haply) in thy younger
yeares, before thou hadſt taſted of the pleaſures
of ſinne, he gave thee an inkling, by meanes of

thy education, of his goodneſſe towards thee,
and of that happineſſe to be liad in him, and thou
hadſt the firſt offer of him, ere thy tender yeares
were poyſoned by the world; and he hath dealt
with thee againe and againe, both by his Word
and Spirit; not waited onely, but wooed thee,
and hath beene a ſuiter to thy heart long: and I
appeale to your hearts, how many promiſes you
have made him, of turning from all your rebellions
to him, after ſuch a Sermon, which was
brought powerfully home: in ſuch a ſickneſſe,
and in ſuch a ſtrait, thy conſcience knowes full
well: And ſtill God hath made tryall of thee,
and given thee longer day; and though thou haſt
broke with him againe and againe, yet he hath
forborne thee againe and againe, and hath waited
this twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, ſixty years, when
thou ſhouldeſt come in, and be as good as thy
word, and ſtill thou haſt failed him. And yet behold
and wonder, and ſtand confounded at the
riches of his long ſuffering, that after ſo many
yeares expence, and promiſes broken by thee,
expectations failed in him, and many mockeries
of him, after all this he is yet willing to accept of
the remainder, if thou wouldſt ſpend the reſt of
the time, left thee in the fleſh, according to his will,
as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,1 Pet. 4. 3. 1 Pet. 4. 3. even to loſe
principall, uſe, and all, for what is paſt, and requires
but the ſame compoſition was propounded
the firſt day; yea and not onely ſo, but with
promiſe to become a debtor unto thee, to beſtow

further riches on thee than ever yet thou ſaweſt,
or art able to conceive: yea and all this, when
he could have his penyworths out of thee another
way, and loſe not one farthing by thee, but
by puniſhing thee in hell, recover all to the
utmoſt.
                  
                  Neither, ſeventhly, hath it beene barely and
ſimply an act of patience and forbearance, though
joyned with this willingneſſe, thou ſhouldſt not
periſh; or meerely a permiſſive act of ſuffering
thee to live. But God ſhewes forth yet more
riches of goodneſſe joyned with this long ſuffering;
in him ye live, and move, and have your being;
and doſt thou live in him onely? nay thou
liveſt on him alſo, upon his coſt and charges;
I have hung upon thee (ſayes David) from my
mothers wombe. And conſider what thy life is,
that of ſo ſmall a bottome, he ſhould ſpin out ſo
long a thred! had hee not drawne it out of his
owne power, as the ſpider doth her web out of
her owne bowels, it had beene at an end the ſecond
minute; to maintaine that radicall moiſture,
that oyle that feeds the lampe, and light of thy
life, that radicale balſamum, this is as great a miracle
as the maintaining the oyle in the cruze of
the poore famiſhed widow. And further yet;
hath he maintained thee onely? Nay more, hath
he not defended thee, tooke thy part, protected
thee, tooke thee under his wing, as the hen doth
her chickens, to ſhelter thee from thoſe many
dangers thy life hath been expoſed unto? Otherwiſe,

how many wayes, ere this, hadſt thou been
ſnatcht away out of the land of the living? Is
thy caſe, the caſe of the figtree onely, which before
we mentioned, that when God cryed, Cut
it downe, another cryed, ſpare it? but there have
beene many have cryed, Cut thee downe, and God
hath cryed, ſpare Thee: there is never a minute,
but the devills would have had a blow at thy
life, as he longed to have had at Iohs. That thou,
a poore lump of fleſh, ſhouldſt walke through,
and in the midſt of ſuch an hoſt of fierce and cruell
enemies, whoſe hearts are ſwelled with malice
at thee, and God ſhould ſay to them all, concerning
thee, as he did to Laban concerning Iacob,
Touch not this man. And yet if thou wert not
liable to their malice and power, yet conſider
how many dangers and caſualties, beſides, thou
haſt beene kept in, and from; as falls, drowning,
killing many wayes; how often have the arrows
of death come whisking by thee, took away thoſe
next thee, (haply of thy kindred, brother, ſiſter,
yoke-fellow, of the ſame houſe, family with thy
ſelfe) and yet have miſſed thee? And if we look
no farther than theſe dayes of mortality we have
lived in; two great plagues in this Kingdome,
how have the moſt of us all here ſurvived, and
now the third is increaſing and growing upon us?
To have our lives in ſuch deare yeares of time,
when to have our life for a prey is mercy enough,
as Ieremy told Baruch! that theſe arrows ſhould
flye round about us, over our heads, and miſſe us!

that Gods arreſts ſhould ſeize upon men, walking,
talking with us, and ſpare us! how often,
many other wayes, hath thy neck been upon the
block, and the axe held over, and yet hath fallen
beſides! To goe no farther than thy own body,
the humours thereof, if God ſhould not reſtraine
them, would overflow and drowne it, as the
waters would the earth, if God ſhould not ſay
to them, ſtay your proud waves. And when in a
ſickneſſe they have been let out, yet God hath
kept a ſluce, that ſo much ſhould break forth, and
no more, which ſhould purge, and waſh the body,
and make it more healthfull, as the overflowing
of Nilus doth. And when then thy body
hath been brought low and weake, and like
a crazy rotten ſhip in a ſtorme, taking in water on
all ſides, ſo that all the Phyſitians in the world
could not have ſtopt thoſe Leakes; yet hee hath
rebuked wind and ſea, hath careened, mended
thee, and launched thee into the world againe,
as whole, as ſound, and ſtrong as ever; and God
hath ſaid,Iob 33. as Iob. 33. that Thou ſhouldſt not dye.
In a word, if thou conſider but what thy life is,
and the dangers it is ſubject to, thou wilt acknowledge
it as great a wonder to preſerve it, as to ſee
a glaſſe, that hath beene in continuall uſe, gone
through many hands, and hath had many knocks,
and falls, to be kept for forty, fifty, ſixty yeeres
whole and unbroken: God hath carryed thy life
in his hand, as it were a candle in a paper lanthorn
in a ſtrong windy night, and kept it from being

extinct, when as wee often ſee in many, that a
little cold comes but in at a little cranny, and
blowes their candle out, as Iob ſpeaks.
                  And eightly, how have theſe yeeres and
hours of thy time been filled up with goodneſſe?
and with how many comforts? For a Traytor
to live, though but upon bread and water all
his dayes, what favour is it? and ſo hadſt thou
lived all this time, never ſo miſerably, though
all thy dayes thou hadſt eaten thy bread in darkneſſe,
and hadſt had much ſorrow with thy ſickneſſe,
                     Eccleſ. 5. 17. (as
Solomon ſpeaks.) Some there are, who, as Iob
ſpeaks,Iob 21. 25. 
                     Iob 21. 15. dye in the bitterneſſe of their
ſoules, and never eate with pleaſure, ſcarce ſeeing a
good day; and if this had beene thy caſe, yet
this is infinite mercy. Even whatſoever is on this
ſide Hell,Lamen. 3. 22. is mercy. Lam. 3. 22. ſay they in the
worſt eſtate the Church was ever on earth, It is
thy [mercies,] not mercy onely, but multitude of
mercies are ſhewne us, that we are not conſumed,
becauſe his mercies are renewed every morning. If
at the brink of hell, and not in, it is mercy. But
hath he not all this while filled thy heart with food
and gladneſſe,
                     Acts 14. 17. as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Acts 14. 17?
It were infinite to goe over the particular kinds of
common comforts, which God vouchſafes men
here: not halfe the riches of his goodneſſe is
yet told: It would require an age to make an Inventory
of them. Haſt a houſe in the world to
hide thy head in, and keepe thee from the injuries
of the weather? (which was more than

Chriſt had) God he is thy Landlord, (though it
may be thou payeſt him no rent;) he it is that
builds the houſe, Pſal. 127. 1. Haſt a bed to lye
upon? he makes it, eſpecially in thy ſickneſſe,
Pſal. 41. 3.Pſal. 41. 3. Haſt thou ſleepe (which is the nurſe
of nature, the parentheſis of all thy cares and
griefes,) he rocks thee aſleep every night; and
as he gives thee a houſe, ſo hee gives thee reſt,
Pſal. 127. 2.Pſal. 127. 2. It is God keeps off thoſe gnatts of
diſtracting cares, and griefes, and thoughts, and
terrors of conſcience, would buzze about a man,
and keepe one continually waking. And when
thou ſleepeſt, is thy ſleepe pleaſant to thee? God
makes it ſo,Ier. 31. 26. 
                     Ier. 31. 26. Haſt thou cloathes to cover
thy nakedneſſe? reade old Iacobs Indentures,
Gen. 28. 20.Gen. 28. 20. and thou ſhalt ſee by them whoſe
finding they are at; if Thou wilt give mer rayment,
that is one of his conditions mentioned. Yea, doe
thy cloathes keepe thee warme? even this is attributed
to him,Iob 37. 17. 
                     Iob 37. 17. He fills thee, feeds thee,
ſpreads thy table, ſerves thee, fills thy cup, as David
deſcribes his goodneſſe, Pſal. 23. 5. and gives
thee thy meat in due ſeaſon; and hath not failed
thee a meales meat, but thou haſt had it at thy appointed
time, as Iob ſpeaks. And haſt thou health?
which is the ſalt to all theſe bleſſings, (without
which thou wouldſt ſay, thou hadſt no pleaſure in
them) He is the God of thy health, and keeps off
diſeaſes.Exod. 15. 26. 
                     Exod. 15. 26. I will put none of thoſe
diſeaſes on thee; I am the Lord who healeth thee;
that is, preſerve thee from them which elſe

would ſeize on thee. And theſe mercies hee
vouchſafeth unto you that are the pooreſt,Pſal. 68. 19. and
loades you with theſe and the like benefits every
day.
                  
                  But haſt thou Riches added to theſe, and abundance?
The bleſsing of God maketh rich, Prov. 10.
22. Though thou hadſt them by birth, yet hee
made thoſe friends, and parents of thine, but
feoffees in truſt for thee: they were no more, it
was God who bequeathed them, Eccl. 2. laſt.
Or whether thou haſt got them ſince by thine
owne induſtry, it is hee gives thee power to get
wealth,
                     Deut. 8. 18. 
                     Deut. 8. 18. Prov. 12. 24. and out of a
ſmall eſtate maketh men great, Iob 8. 7. It is hee
by his providence hath ſtopt the ſecret iſſues and
draynes of expence, at which other mens eſtates
runne out; hath ſtopt that hole in the bottome of
the bag, as the Prophet ſpeaks. And with theſe
riches hath he given thee a heart to uſe them. This,
as it is a farther mercy, Eccleſ. 5. 19. and Chap.
6. 2. ſo alſo from him, as it is noted there.
                  Or haſt thou credit (which is better than
riches?Prov. 22. 1. ſo ſayes Solomon, Prov. 22. 1.) it is God
who gives it, not thy wiſedome, parts, or worth:
Eccleſ. 9. 11. favour is not alwaies to men of skill:
that is, not acceptation of what they doe, without
a farther bleſſing from God. Therefore beſides
the gift of wiſdome, he gave a further promiſe
of honour alſo unto Solomon, 2 Chron. 1. 11.
It is God who faſhions mens opinions. The Apoſtle
prayes to God his ſervice might be accepted of

the Saints, though no ſervice was like to be
more acceptable, for it was the gathering and
bringing in of almes and reliefe to them. It is he
rules mens tongues, bids men bleſſe, as well as
he bade Shimei curſe: and he hath kept thee from
ſuch groſſe ſinnes, which, as flyes, would have
putrifyed the oyntment of thy good name, who alſo
conceales thoſe thou haſt committed, and hides
thee from the ſtrife of tongues,
                     Iob 5. 21. 
                     Iob 5. 21.
                  Haſt thou friends, or doe any love thee?
(wherein much of the comfort of our lives conſiſts,
and therefore David ſayes of Ionathan,
2 Sam. 1. 26.2 Sam. 1. 26. 
                     Thou wert pleaſant to me) it is God
who gives favour in mens eyes: So hee did Ioſeph,
Gen. 39. 21.Gen. 33. 10. If any man or creature doth
thee a kindneſſe, he toucheth their hearts, (as it
is ſaid of the men who clave to Saul) and viſits for
thee; He made the Aegyptians beyond all reaſon
the Iſraelites friends, gave them favour in
their eyes, as the text tells us. And hence, Gen.
33. 10. Iacob ſayes, He ſaw the face of God, in reconciled
Eſaus face; for Gods favour appeared
in his looke. He put you into your callings, ranks,
and ſtations, gives you all your skill, ſucceſſe in
them; The meaneſt of trades, to ſow, and plough,
and threſh, they are from the Lord, who is wonderfull
in working, (Eſay 28. from the 23. to the end)
even as well as the skill of the moſt curious Ingraver,
Limbner, or Embroyderer (as of Bezaleel)
the Scripture ſayes, God was his Maſter,
taught him. Haſt thou enlarged parts and gifts

for higher imployments?Iob 32. 8, 9. it is not thy birth, or
age hath acquired them unto thee: Iob 32. 8, 9.
Great men are not alwaies wiſe, therefore it goes
not by birth; nor have the aged alwaies underſtanding,
it goes not onely by experience; but it
is the inſpiration of the Almighty. And haſt a
calling anſwerable to thy parts, to be a Scholler,
and have thy minde enriched and ennobled with
the beſt and choiſeſt jewell the world hath, wiſdome
and knowledge; whereby the minde is
elevated as much above other mens, as they are
above beaſts? God hath beene thy great Tutor,
The mind of man is Gods Candle, and hee maketh
wiſer than a mans teachers, as he did Moſes in
Egyptian learning, Daniel, David.
                  
                  To conclude, haſt thou comfort in all theſe?
in riches, learning, credit, wife, children, meat,
drink, &amp;c. Hee puts in all the ſugar, delight and
pleaſure that eſpecially depends on him; even to
faſhion the heart to all theſe. As ayre lights not
without the Sunne, nor wood heats not without
fire; ſo neither doth thy condition comfort
thee without God.Acts 14. 17. And therefore Acts 14. 17.
it is ſaid, He filled their hearts, as with food, ſo, with
gladneſſe.
                  
                  And beſides all theſe, conſider the many peculiar
paſſages and turnings of his providence
towards thee for thy good; the working of
things together, ever and anon to doe thee a
good turne; the packing and plotting all for
thee, better than thou couldſt have plotted for

thy ſelfe; as thy reliefe in many ſtreights, ſucceſſe
in many buſineſſes; He workes all our works
in us and for us, as Eſay ſpeaks, Eſay 26. hath he
not taken ſuch ſpeciall care and providence of
thee, as if hee had regarded no man elſe in the
world?
                  And now when thou haſt conſidered all, bethinke
thy ſelfe withall a little of thy dealings
towards him: what have beene the effects and
fruits of all this goodneſſe? hold up thy head
man, looke God in the face. It is well yet, that
ſhame begins to cover thee. How hath that his
patience and long ſuffering, vouchſafing thee
ſpace to repent, wrought with thee? how nigh
to repentance hath it brought thee? Such is the
perverſeneſſe of mans nature, as Solomon tells us,
Eccleſ. 8. 11.Eccleſ. 8. 11. that becauſe ſentence againſt an evill
worke is not preſently executed, therefore the hearts
of the ſonnes of men are fully ſet to doe evill: Becauſe
God defers puniſhing, they defer repenting;
thou thinkeſt to ſpend the moſt precious
of thy time and ſtrength in ſinning, and give God
the dreggs, the bottome, the laſt ſands, thy
dotage, which thy very ſelfe and friends are
weary of, and all theſe bleſſings and comforts
which God hath vouchſafed thee, how haſt thou
uſed them againſt him? This oyle which ſhould
have beene fuell to thy thankfulneſſe, hath encreaſed
the fire of thy luſts, and thy luſts have
conſumed them all, Iames 4. The riches hee hath
given, thou haſt made Idols of, and ſacrificed

thy deareſt, morning, daily thoughts and affections
unto, as God complaines, Ezek. 16. from the
15. and ſo on: [His meat] (as at the 29. ver. he
calls it) thou ſacrificedſt to thy belly, which thou
haſt made thy God; thy ſtrength to women;
the wealth hee hath given you, you have made
uſe of, but to live at a high rate of ſinning, and to
procure the ſweeteſt bits, the daintieſt and moſt
coſtly ſinnes; The edge of that ſword of power
God hath put into thy hand, thou haſt turned againſt
him and his, haply both his Children and
Miniſters; ſo that God, by giving thee all theſe,
hath but made thee more able to offend him, and
hath ſtrengthned an enemy, and by ſparing thee
thus long, hath but made thee more bold to doe
it; all his mercyes have but fortifyed thy heart
againſt him; Doe ye requite the Lord thus, ye fooliſh
people and unkind? as Moſes expoſtulates the
caſe,Deut. 32. 6. 
                     Deut. 32. 6. as Chriſt ſaid to the Jewes, For
which of all my good workes doe yee ſtone me? So
ſay I to you, for which of all his mercies is it, ye
ſinne againſt him? what, to fight againſt him
with his owne weapons? to betray all he gives
you into the devills, his enemies hands? What
iniquity did you ever finde in him, thus to deale?
God will one day thus expoſtulate his cauſe with
you, and heape coales of fire upon all your heads,
(if that you turne not) becauſe you have rendred
him evill for good: and all theſe mercies thus
abuſed, will be as ſo many coales to make hell
fire the hotter. And to reaſon this point yet further

with you out of the Text, and what arguments
it will afford to work upon you.
                  Conſider, firſt, what it is thou doeſt; whileſt
thus thou goeſt on, thou art a Deſpiſer of the
Riches of his goodneſſe: that which is oppoſite to
goodneſſe, muſt needs be tranſcendently evill.
What, art thou evill, becauſe God is good? and ſo
much the more evill, by how much the more
he is good, ſurely there muſt needs be an unexhauſted
treaſure of wickedneſſe in thee, which
will alſo cauſe in the end a treaſure of wrath in
him; what and ſinne againſt mercy, patience,
long ſuffering, added to goodneſſe? of all attributes,
as the richeſt to the moſt glorious; for
it is that he glories in: in the abuſing of which,
therefore he thinkes himſelfe moſt debaſed: of
all attributes the tendereſt: what, kick againſt
his bowels? ſo are his mercies called: canſt hit
him no where elſe but there? to deſpiſe a mans
wiſdome, power, learning, is not ſo much as to
deſpiſe his love; what canſt thou imagine will
become of thee, when thou commeſt to dye?
what is it thou wilt then come to plead and cry
for? O mercy, mercy; why wretch that thou
art, it is mercy thou haſt ſinned againſt. Riches
of mercy and patience abuſed; turnes into fury.
I may allude to that ſpeech, 1 Sam. 2. 25.
If a man ſinne againſt his brother,
                     1 Sam. 2. 25. 
                     the Iudge
ſhall judge him; but if againſt God, who ſhall
plead for him? So hadſt thou ſinned againſt
any other attribute, Mercy might have pleaded

for thee; but if againſt Mercy it ſelfe, who
ſhall?
                  Well, if thou goeſt on thus to doe ſo ſtill,
thou haſt a hard heart; it argues the greateſt
hardneſſe of all other; that is the ſecond. You
uſe not (however it comes to paſſe) to deale
thus with the worſt of men, ſinner like to your
ſelves; but to them that love you, you tender
love againe, Luke 6. 33. and will you deale ſo
with God? Is it a ſmall thing to weary men, but
you muſt weary God alſo?
                     Eſay 7. 13. ſayes Eſay, 7. 13. Hee
thought it infinitely leſſe to abuſe men than God;
but you carry your ſelves as men, to men, but
as devills towards God; herein ye have not the
hearts of men in you; not principles of common
humanity, whereby ye differ from beaſts; The
cords of love are called the cords of a man,
                     Hoſ. 11. 6. 
                     Hoſ. 11. 6.
the ſpirit of man breakes, melts under kindneſſe;
beaſts indeed yee uſe to prick with goades, but
the cords of a man are the cords of love; no
principle being more deepely engraven in mens
hearts, than this, to doe good to thoſe who doe good
to you, Mat. 5. 46.Mat. 5. 46. Nay, would ye had herein
yet the hearts of beaſts; The Oxe knowes his
owner, the Aſſe his maſters cribb, but my people
have rebelled againſt mee. A ſinne ſo much
againſt nature, that he calls upon thoſe creatures,
who have no more than meere nature in them,
viz.Eſay 1. 
                     the heavens to ſtand aſtoniſht at it. But as nature
elevated by grace, riſeth higher than it ſelf;
ſo being poyſoned with ſinne, it is caſt below it

ſelfe, ſins againſt it ſelf, and the principles which
are begotten in and with it ſelfe; if it were not
ſo, how were it poſſible thou ſhouldſt hate him,
who never did thee hurt? and goe on to wound
him, who weepeth overthee? and deſpiſe that in
him moſt, which ſeekes to ſave thee? and load
him with ſins?Amos 2. 13. 
                     Amos 2. 13. who loades thee daily
with his mercies,Pſal. 68. 19. 
                     Pſal. 68. 19.
                  There is a third conſideration the text ſuggeſts,
to ſhew the fearfulneſſe of thy ſin in this
reſpect; and that is, that thou goeſt on every minute
ſinning and in impenitency, by deſpiſing his
goodneſſe, to treaſure up wrath againſt the day
of wrath; to ſin againſt mercy, of all other encreaſeth
wrath; thou muſt pay treaſures, for
treaſures ſpent. As thou laviſhly ſpendeſt riches
of mercy, ſo God will recover riches of glory
out of thee: God will not loſe by thee, but will
reckon with thee in wrath for every offer of patience
ſpent; for every ſand of long ſuffering that
runs out, hee drops in a drop of wrath into his
Vialls, and it will prove a treaſure, ſuch a treaſure
as ſhall bring in an eternall revenue of glory unto
God, of all his glory loſt, and riches ſpent,
with advantage; ſuch a treaſure, as will aske an
eternity of time to be ſpent upon thee, and yet be
never emptied or made leſſe; and the longer thou
goeſt on, the greater heap it will ſwell unto. And
doſt thou know and conſider how faſt this treaſure
fills, and how much the longer thou goeſt on
to adde to it, ſtill the more thou addeſt, ſtill the

laſt yeere more than all the yeeres before? every
minutes impenitency adding to this heape and
ſumme, as new figures added in a ſumme uſe to
doe; the firſt is but one, the ſecond makes it ten,
the third an hundred, the fourth a thouſand, and
what a ſumme will this grow to?
                  Ay but thou wilt ſay, Tuſh, I am in proſperity,
in health, wealth, and eaſe, and to day ſhall be as
to morrow, and much more abundant. Eſay 56.
12. Well, but fourthly, conſider out of the text,
that there will come a day at laſt, the morrow
whereof will be a day of wrath: It is treaſuring up
now, but is not brought forth till the day of
wrath, till which day thou mayeſt goe on and
proſper, as Iob giving us the reaſon why wicked
men proſper here, ſayes, Chap. 21. They are reſerved
to the day of wraths, in the plurall, becauſe
treaſures are laid up againſt then; thou art yet
ſpared, becauſe thy ſins are not yet full, and that
Treaſure is not full, as the ſins of the Amorites
were not; and all this thy preſent proſperity fits
thee but for hell. So Rom. 9. 22. they are ſaid to
be veſſells fitted for deſtruction, by long ſuffering.
And ſo Nahum tells us, they are but as ſtubble
laid out in the Sunne a drying, till it be fully dry,
Nahum 1. 10. that it may burne the better; and
like grapes that are let to hang in the Sunſhine till
they be ripe, Revel. 15. 16. and ſo thou for the
winepreſſe of Gods wrath.
                  
                  But thy ſenſeleſſe heart may hap to ſay, I ſee
no ſuch thing, and theſe are but threats, I thinke

ſo; therefore it is ſaid in the Text, that it is a
Treaſure; which, as Treaſures uſe to be, is hid
till that day comes, &amp; then revealed, as the words
have it. For though thou ſeeſt not this day a
comming, yet God who ſits in heaven, ſees thy
day a comming, as David ſayes, Pſal. 37. 13. who
is therefore ſaid to ſee it, becauſe himſelfe ſees it
not; and it is a comming faſter than thou art
aware of it,2 Pet. 2. 3. 2 Pet. 2. 3. Damnation ſlumbereth not,
though thou dreameſt not of it; lingreth not: as
an hue and cry, it is ſent out, and is on its courſe,
and will in the end overtake thee, and that when
thou leaſt thinkeſt of it, as a theefe in the night,
when thou art aſleepe, yet dreameſt not of it,
2 Theſ. 5. when thou art leaſt prepared for it,2 Theſ. 5. as
in the old world, when they were eating and
drinking: as God watcheth when his child
is at the beſt and ripeſt, and then takes him; ſo he
will watch thee to take thee for thy neglect, at
thy worſt, and give thee haply no time to prepare;
they goe downe to hell in a moment, Pſal.
