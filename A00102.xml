            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            ¶Iniūctions geuen by the Quenes maiestie, aswell to the Clergye, as to the laitie of this Realme.
            
               THe Quenes mooste royall Maiestie, by thaduyse of her moste honorable counsayle, intendynge thaduauncement of the true honour of almyghtye God, the suppressyon of superstition, through all her hyghnesse Realme and dominions, and to plant true religion, to thextirpacion of all hypocrysye, enormities, and abuses (as to her duetie apperteineth) doth minister vnto her louynge subiectes, these godly Iniunctions hereafter folowynge. All which Iniunctions, her hyghnesse wylleth and commaundeth her sayde louyng subiectes, obediently to receaue, and truly to obserue and kepe, euery man in theyr offyces, degrees, and states, as they wyl auoyde her hyghnesse displeasure, and the paynes of the same hereafter expressed.
            
            
               THE fyrst is, that all Deanes, Archedeacons, Parsons,
                  Vsurped and forraine aucthoriti
                        ••
                     
                  
                Uycars, and all other, Ecclesiasticall persons, shall faythfully kepe &amp; obserue, and as farre as in them may lye, shall cause to be obserued and kepte of other, al and singuler lawes and statutes made for the restorynge to the Crowne the aunciente iurisdiction ouer the state Ecclesiasticall, and abolyshyng of all forrayne power repugnaunte to the same. And furthermore all Ecclesiasticall persons, hauyng cure of soule, shall to thuttermost of theyr wytte, knowledge and learnynge, purelye, sincerely, and without anye coloure or dissimulation, declare, manifest and open, foure tymes euery yere at the least, in theyr Sermons and other collations, that all vsurped and forrayne power, hauynge no establyshemente nor grounde by the lawe of God, is for mooste iuste causes taken awaye and abolyshed. And that therefore no maner of obedience or subiection within her hyghnesse realmes and dominions, is due vnto any such forrayne power. And that the Quenes power within her Realmes and dominions, is the hyghest power vnder God, to whom all men within the same Realmes and dominions, by Gods lawes, owe most loyalty &amp; obedience, afore and aboue al other powers and potentates in earth.
            Besydes this, to thintent that all superstition  and hypocrysye, crepte into dyuers mennes hartes,
                  Images
                may vanyshe away, they shall not sette forth or extoll the dignitie of any Images, Reliques,

or miracles, but declarynge the abuse of the same, they shall teache that all goodnesse, health and grace, ought to be bothe asked and loked for onely of God, as of the very aucthour and geuer of the same, and of none other.
            
                Item that they the persons aboue rehearsed, shall preach in theyr Churches, and euery other cure they haue,
                  A sermon euery moneth.
                one Sermon euery moneth of the yere at the least, wherein they shall purelye and sincerely declare the woorde of God: and in the same exhort theyr hearers to the woorkes of Fayth; as mercye and charitie,
                  workes of Fayth.
                specially prescrybed and commaūded in scripture, and that workes deuysed by mans phantasies besydes scripture:As wandryng of Pylgrymages, settynge vp of Candels,
                  workes of mās deuise.
                praying vpon bedes, or such lyke superstition, haue not onely no promyse of rewarde in scripture for doynge of them: but contrarywyse great threatenynges and maledictions of God, for that they be thynges tendyng to Idolatry and superstition, which of al other offences, God almyghtie doth most deteste and abhorre, for that the same diminishe moste his honor and glory.
            Item that they the persons aboue rehearsed  shall preache in theyr owne persons once in euery quarter of the yeare at the leaste one Sermon,
                  Quarter Sermon or Homely

                     dementes.
                they shall immediatly after the Gospell, openly and playnely recite to theyr parishioners in the Pulpitte, the Pater noster, the Crede, and the ten commaundementes in Englyshe, to thintent the people may learne the same by hearte, exhortynge all parentes and householders, to teach theyr children and seruauntes the same, as they are boūd by the lawe of God, and conscience to do.
            
            Also that they shall prouyde within three monethes next after this visitacion,
                  The Byble &amp; Paraphrasis.

And within one .xii. monethes next after the said visitacion the Paraphrases of Erasmus also in Englyshe, vpon the Gospelles, and the same sette vp in some conuenient place within the sayd Church that they haue cure of, whereas theyr Parysshyoners may most commodiously resorte vnto the same, and reade the same, out of the tyme of common seruice. The charges of the Paraphrases shalbe by the personne or proprietarie and paryshyoners borne by equall portions. And they shall discorage no man from the readyng of any parte of the Byble, eyther in Latin or in Englyshe, but shall rather exhorte euery person to reade the same, with great humilitie and reuerence, as the verye lyuely woorde of God, and the specyal fode of mans soule, which

all Christian persones are bounde to embrace, beleue, and followe, yf they looke to bee saued: wherby they maye the better knowe theyr dueties to God, to theyr Soueraigne Ladye the Quene, and theyr neyghbour, euer gentely and charitablye exhortyng them, and in her Maiesties name, strayghtly charging and commaundyng them, that in the readyng therof, no man to reason or contende, but quietlye to heare the reader.
            
                Also the sayde Ecclesiasticall persones, shall in no wyse at any vnlawfull tyme, nor for any other cause,
                  Hauntyng of Alehouses by Ecclesiasticall persons.
                then for theyr honeste necessities, haunt or resort to any Tauernes or Alehouses. And after theyr meates, they shall not geue thē selues to drynkyng or ryot, spendyng theyr time idelly by day or by nyght, at dyse, cardes, or tables playing, or any other vnlawfull game.

was by act of Parliament in tyme of our deare brother kyng Edwarde the syxt, made lawefull, wherevpon a great nombre of the clergy of this realme were their maryed, and so yet continue, yet because ther hath growen offence, and some slaunder to the Church, by lacke of discrete and sober behauyoure in manye mynysters of the Churche, both in chosyng of theyr wyues, and in vndiscrete lyuynge with them, the remedye wherof is necessary to be sought. It is thought therfore very necessary, that no maner of prieste or deacon, shall hereafter take to his wyfe anye maner of woman without the aduyse and allowaunce fyrste had vpon good examination by the byshop of the same Diocese, and two Iustyces of peace of the same shyre, dwellyng next to the place where the same womā hath made her moste abode, before her maryage, nor without the good wyll of the parentes of the sayde woman, yf she haue any lyuyng, or two of the next of her kynsefolkes, or for lacke of knowledge of such, of her master or mastres where she serueth. And before he shalbe contracted in any place, he shall make a good and certen profe therof to the mynyster, or to the congregation assembled for that purpose, which shalbe vpon some holy day where dyuers may be present. And yf anye shall do otherwyse: that then they shall not be permitted to minister eyther the woorde, or the sacramentes of the Churche, nor shall be capable of anye Ecclesiasticall benefyce. And for the maner of mariages of any Byshoppes, the same

shalbe allowed and approued by the Metropolitane of the prouince, and also by suche commissioners as the Quenes Maiestie shall therevnto appoynt. And yf any master or deane, or any head of any colledge, shal purpose to mary, the same shall not be allowed, but by suche to whom the visitacion of the same doth properly belonge, who shall in anye wyse prouyde that the same tende not to the hynderaunce of theyr house.

               And further her Maiestie forbyddeth all maner her subiectes to geue eare or credit to suche peruerse &amp; malitiouse persons, which most sinisterly &amp; malitiously labour to notifie to her louing subiectes, how by the wordes of the sayde othe, it may be collected yt the kinges or Quenes of this realme, possessours of the Crowne, may

chalenge aucthoritie and power of ministrie of diuine offices in the Churche, wherein her said subiectes be much abused by such euyll disposed persons. For certeinlye her Maiestie neither doth, ne euer wyll challenge any other aucthoritie, than that was challenged and lately vsed by the sayde noble kynges of famous memorye kyng Henry the eyght, and kynge Edwarde the syxt, which is and was of auncient tyme due to the Imperyall Crowne of this realme.

And if any person that hath conceiued anye other sence of the fourme of the sayde othe, shall accepte the same othe with this interpretacion, sence, or meanyng; her maiestie is well pleased to accept euery such in that behalfe, as her good and obedient subiectes, &amp; shall acquite them of all maner penalties conteyned in the saide acte against such as shal peremptorily, or obstinately refuse to take the same othe.
            
            
               
               For the Tables in the church.
               
                  WHeras her Maiestie vnderstandeth that in many and sundry partes of the realme, the Alters of the Churches be remoued, &amp; tables placed for ministratiō of the holy sacrament, accordynge to the fourme of the lawe therefore prouyded, and in some other places the Alters be not yet remoued, vpon opinion conceiued of some other order therin to be taken by her Maiesties visitours. In thorder whereof, sauynge for an vniformitie, there semeth no matter of great moment, so that the sacrament be duely and reuerently mynystred. yet for obseruation of one vniformitie through the hole Realme, &amp; for the better imitacion of the lawe, in that behalfe, it is ordered that no Alter be taken down but by ouersyght of the curate of the Churche, and the churchwardens, or one of them at the least, wherin no riotous or disordred maner to be vsed, and that the holy table in euery Churche be decently made, and set in the place where the alter stode: and there cōmonly couered as therto belongeth, and as shalbe appoynted by the visitours, and so to stande, sauing when the cō
                  munion of the sacrament is to be distributed, at whiche tyme the same shalbe so placed in good sorte within the Chauncell, as wherby the minister may be more conueniently hearde of the communicantes, in his prayer and ministration,

&amp; the cōmunicantes also, more conueniently &amp; in more nomber communicate with the sayde minister, and after the Communion done, from tyme to tyme the same holy table to be placed where it stode before.
               Item where also it was in the tyme of kyng Edward the syxt vsed to haue the sacramentall bread of common fine bread:
                     The Sacramentall breade.
                   It is ordered for the more reuerence to be geuē to these holy misteries, being the sacramentes of the bodye and bloud of our sauior Iesus Chryst, that the same sacramentall bread be made and formed plaine without any figures thervpon, of the same finenesse &amp; fashion rounde, though somwhat bygger in compasse and thickenes, as the vsuall breade and wafer heretofore named syngynge cakes, which serued for the vse of the priuate masse.

               Also you shall praye for the whole commons of this realme, that they may liue in true faith and feare of god, in humble obedyence and brotherly charytie one to thother.
