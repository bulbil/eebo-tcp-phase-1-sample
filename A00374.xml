            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                  The preface, prologhe or longe epiſtle, written to the right vertuous ād ſage father Paulus Uolzius (whom allmightie god euen now this laſt yeare hath delyuered out of this wretched world) declareth euidētly, that though ſome mē haue euen maried them ſelues to the vayn paſtymes and pleaſures of the world. Yet god thorow aduerſite (as his accuſtomate maner is) nurtureth god throw aduerſite calleth his owne children to re pentaunce. and teacheth his owne, chaſteneth thē, and calleth them to a Chriſtē life: To the furthuraunce wherof like as eueryone of us is bounde to beſtowe all his laboure and ſtudie. So is not he to be caſt awaye, that beyng weake and fraile, not onely deſyreth to be vertuous, but alſo is feruent in lerning the waye of godlines: Wherof they are the beſt teachers, that auoydinge the tediouſneſſe of huge and great volumes, do inſtructe men rather to lyue godly, then to waiſt their braynes in long and vayne diſputacions. For how few ſo euer they be that geue them ſelues to

                  ole

doctrine, yet the feare of god (the fruit wherof is eternall ſaluacion) apperteyneth vnto all mē. Nether doth anye mā atteyne ſo nyghe vnto wiſdome, as he that is in loue withall, and appeareth not ſo much lerned himſelfe, as he is Who is wyſeſt and beſt lerned. ſtudious to allure all other (yea aſwell frend as ſoo, aſwell turke as Chriſten) to godlyneſſe, and is not himſelfe ouercome with euel, but rather ouercometh euel with good. For as it is a Chriſten mās parte to ſaue and not to deſtroye, ſo hath the ſame right true and effectuous diuynite ſubdued more people in tymes paſt to the kyngdome of Chriſt, then any other artilery, weapen or ordināce of warre. Yea like as oure moſt cruell enemies maye be mollified and wonne with benefites and kyndneſſe, whan we ſe

                  e nothyng ſo much as the it health. Euen ſo in ſekynge their deſtruction, we maye ſooner turne in to turkes oure ſelues, then that we ſhal cauſe them to become Chriſten men.
               Now to conſidre the corruption of The corruptneſſe of the world, this world, and how farre it is out of frame, the darckneſſe, the trublous rufflinge, the greate tirannye, auarice and iniquite therof vnpuniſhed: how colde

me are in charite, ād how greatly geuē to ambicion and lucre: Who lamentinge the ſame, doth not ſe thouſandes of occaſions for us all to take better holde of Chriſtes doctryne, and to haue recourſe ther vnto? Specially conſidering that the cruell Philiſtynes preuayle ſo greatly, and ceaſſe not (euen now in oure tyme) to ſtoppe it vp, wringing and wreſting it to their filthie purpoſes: oure philiſtynes yea brablinge and cryeng ſo ſore agaynſt it, that for feare mē darre not drynke the lyuinge water therof, but muſt be fayne to take ſuch corrupte lycoure, as come out oft heir all to trodē ciſternes: euen earthly thynges for heauenly, pelfare of mens inuencious inſteade of gods holy commaundmētes. Which trifles yet ſhal eaſely of themſelues vaniſhe awaye, yf the light of faith be ſo kyndlind in oure myndes, that we leſe not the rule and patron of Chriſtes loue and charite. And doutles it ſhal further the goſpell moſt notably preſtes. yf they that teach it, do excell in the knowlege and life ther of: and yf Prynces eſtabliſhinghe no lawes for their pryuers owne pleaſure, delite more to refourme their people with mercie, thē with

crueltie, rather to defende them, then to pyll or pol them. As for Prynces, they ſhulde without doute vſe leſſe oppreſſinge of their people, leſſe warrynge one againſt another, and leſſe ſheddyng of blonde, yf biſſhoppes and preſtes that be aboute them, were not readyer to flatre them, then they are ſince rely to inſtructe them in Chriſtes doctryne. Which as it manifeſtly rebuketh couetous phariſes, ypocrites and proude riche folkes: So doth it openly teach us to do good, and to be meke ād gentle of mynde, euē to oure enemies.
               Now though Prynces make many lawes wherof Chriſt is not the authoure, yet as they are to be obeyed whan they commaunde that which isiuſt and right, ſo is it beſt to ſuffre them euen whan they be euell. As touching the The comen people, comē people, though their eſtate be lowe, their vnder ſtonding ſſroſſe and weake, ād they of dewile bound to obeye, yet for aſmuch as they perteyne to the miſtical body of Chriſt, they muſt be nouriſhed, for borne ād cheriſhed after a fatherly maner, vntil they were more ſtrong in Chriſt. For euery one is not like perfite in te kyngdome of god.

Therfore he that is called to more excellentie of giftes, ought (after the maner of the higheſt elementes) to drawe other vnto him, and to helpe that his inferiours maye be trāſfourmed in to his nature: and not vnder the pretence and cloke of vertue to diſagree from the lernynge of Chriſt, who is the onely marke which euery man ought to ſhote at, and in no wyſe to chaunge it, but to inforce himſelfe to come as nye it as he can. Which as it is the higheeſt perfection alowed of god, ſo cōſiſteth it not in the maner or kynde of lyuinge, not in garmentes, meates or drynkes, but in the affecte and mynde.
               And like as there is no eſtate of lyuinge but there be ſome daungers wher into it maye fall, ſo ought no mā to be diſpleaſed, but rather to take it in right good worth, whan he is warned therof. Nether is he a condemner of other men, that faithfully ſheweth Noting is fre frō the cauillation of lewd perſons them their dewtie. And yet can ther nothing be fre frō the cauillacion of lewde perſonnes: but what ſo ener is ſpoken, yea euen to the praiſe of vertue agaynſt vyce, that ſame is taken to the worſt, and iudged of them to be of a

wrong and ſyniſtrall opynion. Yea of ſo corrupte and peruerſe iudgmentes are ſome, that they counte it (euen in preſtes) to be but a ſmall vyre, which is moſt abhominable: and alſo eſteme it to be an hye vertue, which hath but onely the viſure and appearaunce of godlynes thinkinge thē ſelues better for the ceremonies, rules ād trifles of mēs inuencion, and yet hauynge no conſcience at all to ſlaundre other men. Nether nede men to feare, that the reprouing of ſuch abuſes doth ether ſubuerte religion or hyndre true obedience. For whō ſoeuer the holy gooſt enſpyreth, is of his owne acorde without anye maner The holy gooſt is the anthour of obediēce of compulciō readye to obeye, yea euen thoſe rulers that be ſharpe and roughe. Who yet neuertheles ſhulde nomore abuſe the obedience of their inferiours, then anye man ſhulde make his libertie a cloake or couer to his carnal liuinge. Which though ſome do, yet ought not other men therfore to be locked as Iewes in the bondage of ceremonies. For the more a man is religigious and geuē vnto true godlyneſſe, the leſſe he yeldeth to the ceremonies, of mens inuencion. Wherin yf no man

were ſnared till he were of parfite experience, then like as the fewer ſhulde be diſceaued. Euen ſo doutleſſe (acording to the deſyre of all them that be good) the religion of the goſpell ſhulde be ſo pleaſaunt vnto euery man, that they ſhulde be hartely wel contēt ther with without anye other.
               And reaſon it is, that all thinges geue place to the glorie of Chriſt, wher with Moſes reioyced, that his owne honoure was defaced and myniſhed: like as alſo the religions of men ſhulde be, yf they that profeſſe the goſpell dyd lyue therafter. For as they whom we now call religious, are nothinhe like them of the oldtyme, but drouwned in ypocriſie and worldly buſyneſſe, yea nothinge better then other temporall men, ſaue onely in appearaunce. Euen ſo ſhal the vowes of chaſtite, pouerte, and obedience be better hepte of him that obſerueth the profeſſion of holy baptyme, then they be of them.
               The reſt is then, that ſeyng the confidence in oure ſelues is moſt daungerous, we nether diſdayne them that be feble, ner fooliſhly ſtōde in oure owne conceate for no dyuerſite of lyuinge

from other mē: But rather folowinge the counſaill of Chriſt, let us euen frō
                  oure hertes confeſſe whan we haue done oure beſt, that we are but vnprofitable ſeruauntes. And to the intent that we maye be obedient vnto Chriſt himſelfe, let vs be ready not onely to heare them that call vs vnto him, but alſo to tollerate and ſuffre the euell: Neuertheles in ſuch forte, that yf they commaunde thinges wicked and contrary to the doctryne of Chriſt, we rather obeye god, then men.
            
            
               
               The firſt Chapter.

                  WHo ſo will eſcape the daunger of ſyme, and proſperouſly go forwarde in the waye of godlynes, muſt allway The lyfe of mā is but a war fayre. conſidre, that this life of man is a perpetuall warſart, and muſt be circumſpecte, that the world with his delycious and flatring pleaſures iugle not his mynde from watchinge, or make him to careleſſe, as though he had already conquered his enemies: Who, conſideringe they be ſo many, as namely the wicked and craftie deuels aboue us, the world afore and behinde us, yea on the right hande and on the lefte, aſwell Enemies at hā
                     de ſhakyng the wal of oure ſaules with the gonnes of aduerſite, as prouokyng us vnto euell with his vainepromiſis: Not onely whyle the ſlipper ād craftie ſerpent layeth awaythe, euē by oure awne affections and ſenſualite to entyce and drawe oure myndes vnto

mortal and deedly pleaſures, But alſo whyle we oure ſelues beare a boute with us the olde earthy Adā, oure owne moſt perilous enemie: Conſiderynge Iſaye, we haue ſo many deedly enemies, ought we not therfore ſtill to be weaponed ād allwaye to watche: Why ſlepe we then ſo faſt, geuynge oure ſelues to ydilneſſe, to pleaſure, to reuelynge, as though we ſhulde rather lyue in banckettyng, then in warfare againſt ſuch enemies: Why will we rather make truce with vyce and ſynne, thē with god, whit whom the wicked can haue no peace: namely they that not onely take parte with ſynne, but vnkyndly alſo ād wickedly breake their appoyntment made with him: Haue we not in we haue promiſed in baptyme, to fight alwaye vnder the ſtādart of chriſt holy baptyme profeſſed and bounde oure ſelues to fight faitfully euer vnder the ſtandart of Chriſt oure captaine, to whom we owe more then we haue to paye: Do not the badges and ſignes of baptyme in us teſtifie, that we are ſworne vnto him, neuer to forſake him, wherof the name of Chriſt alſo ought to put us in remēbraunce. Why are we then ſuch rennagates, that we not onely take parte againſt him which

beſtowed his owne life for us, but do it alſo in a filthie quarel, to opteyne noue other rewarde then the very death of oure ſoules? Yf in theſe mad warres of men, the miſerable ſouldyours do ioperde their lyues are pricked and ſtered vp vnto courage, thorow the greatneſſe of the pray, thorow the comforte of the captayne, thorow the cruelneſſe of the enemies, thorow ſhame of cowardneſſe, or deſyre of praiſe. How much more then ſhulde the hope of rewarde kyndle us to haue luſtie ſtomackes: whan he that ſhal quyte oure payne yf we wynne the felde, beholdinge us, doth not onely comforte us in oure laboures and trauayles, whyle we are yet fightinge, but alſo geueth us ſuch rewarde as excelleth all the ſences ād wittes of man, euen bleſſed immortalite and heauē it ſelf: The hope of which rewarde ſhulde by reaſon enflame the quycke courages of gentle ſtomackes, ſeynge he that hath promiſed, can nether dye ner diſceaue.
               And conſideringe he beholdeth us that ſeyth al thynges, lyke as very ſhame of cowardneſſe at the leeſt waye ſhulde moue us to be luſtie in this battayll:

Euē ſo for aſmuch as to be prayſed of him is very felicite, why ioperde we not oure lyues to haue this prayſe: Seynge now we are ſo circumſpecte in auoyding, the daungers ād death of the body, why perceaue we not the death of the ſoule whych is much more cruell: Now euen as the body is out of tē
                  pre whā it will kepe no meate, ſo whā the worde of god ſemeth bitter vnto Tokēs that the ſoule is ſicke. 
                  
                     •
                  s, yf oure mynde ryſe againſt it, yf oure memory kepe it not, yf we thynke not vpon it, net worke therafter: Yf oure ſoule grudge, or be weake and faynt to worke the dedes of mercie, to ſuffre trouble or loſſe: Yf the eyes of oure mynde be waxen ſo dymme, that they ſe not the cleare light of the treuth: Yf oure inward eares heare not the voyce of god: Summa, yf we lacke al oure inwarde feling and perceauyng of the knowlege of god. It is an euident tokē not onely that oure ſoule is acraſed, but alſo deed, becauſe god which is the life therof, is awaye For felyng is a token of life: and like as the body is not alyue yf he fele not the prickinge of a pynne.
               Euen ſo whan we are wounded in

oure ſoule and haue committed euell, yf it greue us not, then is not oure ſoule alyue, but deed: For the which cauſe alſo Chriſt called the Phariſes paynted ſepulcres, namely becauſe they bare deed ſoules aboute with them Wherfore conſidering that the bodies of good men are the temple of the holy gooſt, and for aſmuch as (acording to the goſpell) the mouth ſpeaketh out of the abundaunce of the hert, No doute we wolde ſpeake the lyuely wordes of god and worke his dedes, yf he oure lyfe were preſent within oure hertes.
               Thus though we fight in ſtraunge and wonderfull ioperdies, with many violent and ſubtill aduerſaries, yet haue we cauſes ſufficient to be of good cō
                  forte For though oure enemies be greuous: Cauſes of conſolatiō. yet haue we preſent helpe at hande. Though they be many agaynſt us, what matter is it whan god is on oure ſyde: Yf he ſtaye us, who cā caſt us downe: As for oure enemie, he is no new ſoldyour, but one that was ouercome many yeares agoo, ād ouer throwne by the might of Ieſꝰ chriſt: as he ſhal non alſo be ſubdued in us bi the

               What weapens are to be vſed in the warre of a Chriſten man.
               LYke as nothing perteyneth more to the warre of a Chriſtē mā, then to knowe with what weapens

he muſt fight, and to haue the ſame alwaye readye at hande: Euen ſo (conſideringe the aduerſary is neuer ydle) we ought not to ceaſſe from warre, but yf we wil fight againſt the multitude of vyces, we oughte alwaye to watche, to haue oure mynde armed, ād to take the weapēs of defence, but ſpecially to prouide us of two, namely praier two weapens ād knowlege, which be the chefe armoure of a Chriſten man. Perfite praier lifteth vp te mynde vnto god: knowlege armeth the mynde with halſome preceptes and honeſt opynions. Theſe two cleue ſo together, that the one can not lacke the other: For as the one maketh interceſſion, ſo the other teacheth how we ought to praye, namely in the name of Ieſu, and what we ought to deſyre, euen that which is wholſome for oure ſoules health. Now though praier be more excellent, becauſe ſhe thalketh familiarly with almightie god, yet is knowlege no leſſe neceſſary: Which as it ought not to be vnparfite, ſo ought not prayer to be faynt, ſlacke, or without quyckneſſe. Nether cā we wel perfourme the great iourney that we haue to go, without the ayde and helpe of

theſe to weapēs. The vſe of praier is, not to mōble &amp; bable much, as they do The vſe of prayer that are not rype in gods ſprete. For fyve wordes ſpokē in knowlege, are better, then ten thouſand babled with the mouth. Nether is it the noyſe of our, lippes, but the feruēt deſyre of the mynde that god aloweth. Which feruent prayer with like ſtudie or meditaciō of the holi ſcripture, is able as, wel to put abacke the greate violēce of our enemies, as to make eaſie any greuous aduerſite. Yf we with this heauēly Mannaād foode of god be refreſhed in the furtheraunce, of oure iourney, it ſhal make us bolde and ſtrōge, to buckle with oure enemies. For the doctryne of god as it onely is pure and vndefyled (contrary to the nature of mens doctrynes) Euen ſo, to them that ſpiritually vnderſtōding it, maye abyde the hearyng therof, ther is nothing ſweterner more pleeſaunt, and therfore the more the doctryne of God. worthy to be ſearched and wel pōdred. This is the ryuer of cōforte, the fountayne of eaſe, the wel that refreſhed the weerye, the water of Siloe, where the blind recouer their ſight. To the ſtudie wherof yf we applie oure ſelues

wholly: that is, yf we exercyſe oure myndes continualli in the lawe of god, we ſhal be ſo armed, that we nede not to feare anye aſſaulte of oure enemies.

               As conſernyng the interpretours of the holy ſcripture, we ought not to choſe Expoſitours of ſcripture them that teach to brawle and contē

Now as we ought to growe vnto parfitneſſe and ſtrenght in the knowlege therof, and not ſtill to be children. Euen ſo yf we will haue it to be ſauery vnto us, and to nouriſhe us, we muſt not reed without vnderſtunding (as cloſtres do) but breake the codde, and failt of the ſwetneſſe within: ſpecially cōſideringe that as it is the ſprete and not the fleſh that quyckeneth, ſo wil the father of heauē be whorſhipped in the ſprete, and not in the barcke of the lettre. Wherfore tough we ſhulde not deſpiſe the weake, yet ought we to make ſpede vnto more ſecrete miſteries, and to ſtere vp our ſelues ther vnto by offten prayer, till it pleaſe god thorow his ſonne Ieſus

Chriſt to open it, that yet is ſhutt, vnto us.
               Now tho oure purpoſe, yf we wandryng thorow out al doctrynes, pyke and choſe out the beſt, and by the example of the bee, refuſe the poyſon, ād ſucke out onely the wholſome and ſwete Iuce, it ſhal arme oure myndes the better to a vertuous conuerſacion. But that deuyne harneſſe which with no weapen can be perſed, is fetched onely out of the armory of holy ſcripture, wher with oure Dauid Chriſt Ieſus brake the forehead of oure aduerſary. Wherfore if we liſt to go vnto the ſtore houſe of gods ſcripture, we ſhal there In the armoury of gods word are the beſt we apens fynde the true armoure of this warre, valeaunt in god not onely to deſtroye fortreſſes and counſails and euery highe thing that exalteth it ſelfe agaynſt the doctryne of god, but alſo to reſiſte in the daye of aduerſite, ād to quench al the whote and fyrie weapēs of oure cruell enemie. Such weapens or armoure of light (though we be the refuſe ād aut caltes of the worlde) hath almightie god geuen us, to make us ſtowte and luſtie in his warres. For in his armory fynde we the harneſſe of

Iuſtice and verite, the buckler of ſaith, the helmet of health, and the ſworde of of the ſprete which is the worde of god: Wherwith yf we be diligently couered and fenced, ther ſhal no tribulation, ſtraitneſſe, hunger, nakedneſſe peril perſecution, &amp;c.

               YF we thus warre now, intendinge to opteyue the peace which Chriſt onely geueth, we muſt ſtrongly fight agaynſt oure owne vices, with whom, god oure onely peace and felicite, is at variaunce: Of the which felicite they are utterly voyde, yea very wretches, filthie and vnhappie, that lyenge ſtill in the night of ignoraunce and fooliſhneſſe, are deſtitute of his wiſdome: yf we be wyſe, we ſhalbe conquerours of the enemie. Wherfore

like as worldly wiſdome is fooliſhnes worldly wiſdome. before god, euen ſo yf we be wiſe in him, it oughte not to diſcorage us, whan the worlde iudgeth us to be fooles, to be diſceaued, to dote, and to be mad bedlems, becauſe we intende to departe toward Chriſt. Is not this a miſerable blindneſſe, ſore to be mourned, whan in trifles and thynges of no value, yea vnto filthyneſſe and in euel onely, mē are cleare witted: ād in thynges concernyng ſaluacion and in goodneſſe not to haue much more vnderſtonding thē brute beeſtes?

Cōtrary wiſe a very euel thing is it to lacke knowlege: yea as he is good for nothing which hath no wiſdome. So is it a worſe thing to diſdayne to lerne: But to withſtande and repugne the trueth is worſt of al, ād fartheſt To withſtand the trueth is worſt of al. frō grace: Namely, whā mē deſpiſe the wiſdome of god, ād thinke ſcorne to be taught of it: For the which cauſe he himſelfe ſhal utterly forſake thē, and reioyſe in their deſtruction.

This wiſdome muſt we requyre onely of god with feruent praier out of the vaynes of holy ſcripture. The chefe parte of it is to know oure ſelues, which we ſhall do the better, yf we well cōſidre, what we be inward and within our ſkynnes.

               THe eternal lawe which god hath created in in the right reaſon of man, teacheth him to abhorre al

corrupte affections, and not to lyue after them, which thing euen the heithē philoſophers do alſo cōfeſſe. Now as we are bound ſureli to know what motiōs we be moſt enclined vnto, ſo ought we to underſtōd, that thorou right reaſō (which is the power of gods holy ſprete) the moſt violent of thē maye either be refrayned, or els turned in to vertue Trueth it is, that as ſome mā is more prone vnto vertue thē ſome, either bi reaſō

And ſome tyme an euel diſeaſe of the mā is recōpēced with another certayne cōtrary good gifte or propertie. As for the vices that are nigheſt vnto vertues, we muſt amēde thē, ād turne thē in to that vertue which they moſt nighe reſēble. For let a man that is ſoone prouoked vnto anger, refrayne his mynde, ād he ſhalbe nothing faynt herted, but bolde yea and fre of ſpeach without diſſimulaciō, The nygarde, by the exercyſe of

reaſon, ſhalbe thrifftie and a good huſband: The flatrer, ſhal thorow moderacion, be curteys and pleaſaunt: The obſtinate maye be conſtant: Solemneſſe maye be turned to grauite: One ful of fooliſhe ioyes maye be come a good cō

The waye The waye to felicite. thē to felicite is firſt to know oure ſelues: Secōdly, to do al thinges after the iudgmēt of reaſō, whoſe mouth muſt not be out of taiſt, but without corrupcion. Now as ther is no greather rewarde thē fēlicite: euen ſo that which vnto oure onely ſtrēgth is hardeſt of al to do, is moſt eaſie yf we loke vnto god oure helper. Wherfore yf we grounding oure ſelues vpō a ſure purpoſe of a perfite life, do feruētli ſet vpō it &amp; go luſtely vnto it, no doute we ſhalbe able to bring it to pas: for to be willinge to be a chriſtē mā is a greate parte of Chriſtēdome. A good wil doth much And though the beginning of a thing be neuer ſo harde, yet the waye of vertue in proces doth waxe eaſie: ſhal beeſtes be more ready to be tamed, thē we in our mindes? Sal we for the healt

of our bodies be ruled by the counſail of a phiſician beynge a man, and not maſter our awne affections at the commaundement of god him ſelfe, to haue a quyete conſcience al oure whole life? Shal we do more ſo ſaue oure bodies from likneſſe, then to delyuer both body and ſoule from eternall death?

               Of the two partes of man, proued by holy ſcripture.
               AShame it is, that in this warre men be ſo rude and vnexercyſed, that they know not the dyuerſite betwene reaſon and affectiōs. For that the philoſophers call reaſon, the ſame doth S. Paul ſōtyme call the ſprete, ſō
                  tyme what reaſon is. the inward man, ſomtyme the lawe of the mynde. That they call affection, calleth he ſomtyme the fleſh, ſomtyme the body, ſomtyme the outward man, the law of the membres, and the body of death. And thus oure warre is peace, life and libertie of the ſoule: but death and bondage of the fleſhe, with al his luſtes. Now where as Plato put two ſoules in one man, S. Paul in one mā maketh two men; ſo coupled togheter, that nether without other cā
                  
be either inheauē or hel. And againe ſo ſeparated, that the death of the one muſt be the life of the other. This is the olde debate betwene the two twynnes Iacob ād Eſau Iacob ād Eſau, which or euer they come to light, wraſtle together within their moters wombe. Betwene theſe two brethren is neuer ioyned parfite concorde. For Eſau hateth Iacob, who hauing Eſau euer ſuſpected, darre not come within his daunger. With thing auoyde the ioun ſail of the fleſh ſhulde teach us to ſuſpecte oure owne ſenſual fleſhe, and alwaye to eſchue the counſail therof. Yea mete is it and conuenient, that the woman be obediēt to the huſbande, that Iſaac be more ſet by then Iſmael, that grace increace, and tirannye of the fleſh myniſhe. For whan carnal affections ware olde, then ſpringeth vp to bleſſed tranquilite of an innocent mynde, and ſure quietneſſe of the ſprete. Let not Iſmael therfore the childe of the fleſh diſceaue us with his paſtyme and pleaſures, but let oure Iſaac alwaye ſuſpecte him, and flee the occaſions Flee the accaſiōs of ſynne of ſynne. For ful wilde is the fleſh, ſo that the trouble therof is expedient, to the exercyſe of vertue, to the cuſtodie of humilite, to nurtoure us, ād

to teach us whā we are tēpted, firſt to deſire helpe of god: ſecōdly, that yf we be his, no tentacion can be daungerous vnto us: And finally againſt al vain glorie, agaynſt ſo wilde and manyfolde affections, to be euer ſtil, wraſtleng.

deuell, yf we be ouercome. The ſecōd parte is the ſprete, wher in we repreſente the ſymilitude of the nature of god, The ſprete. who after the eternall law of his owne mynde, hath grauen therin the lawe of honeſtie, wherbye we be knett vnto god, and made one with him. The thirde parte is the ſoule, partaker of The ſoule the ſenſible wittes and naturall mocions, wo yf ſhe forſakyng the fleſh 
                     〈◊〉

                  . But yf ſhe foolowe the corrupte affections of the fleſh, then ioyneth ſhe herſelfe vnto an harlot, and is made, one body with her, that beyng an euel, ſtraunge, flatryng, fooliſhe and babling woman, breaketh her promes, and forſaketh the huſband of her iouth. Wherfore yf we enclyne vnto the ſprete, it maketh us not onely bleſſed, religious, obedient, kynde and mercifull. But alſo teacheth us to deſire celeſtiall and neceſſary, pure, parfite and godly thinges, to obeye God more then men: and though ſome affections be diſguiſed with viſers of vertue, yet not to be diſceaued with them. Yf we enclyne to the fleſh, it maketh us beeſtes, deſpyſers of God,

diſobedient, vnkynde and cruel, yea ād cauſeth us to deſire delicate, pleaſaunt and filthie thinges. The rule of true The rule of true godlyneſſe godlyneſſe therfore is to leene ſo nighe vnto the ſprete, that for any good inclinacion or vertue we aſcrybe nothinge to oure ſelues: that we do nothing for our awne pleaſure or advauntage: that for obſeruyng of outward thinges we iudge not oure ſelues better thē other men: that we regarde more our neghbours naceſſite, and be readier to helpe them, then to kepe mês tradicions: that our loue be chaiſt and ſpiritual, ād that nothing be ſo deare vnto us as Chriſt himſelfe.

               Now to guyde and conueye us out of the blynde errours of this world, vnto the pure and cleare light of ſpiritual liuinge, we muſt of vertue and godlyneſſe make euen a crafft and occupation: the rules wherof yf we do folow, and manfully exercyſe oure ſelnes therin, the holy gooſt ſhal bring oure purpoſe for ward.

The firſt poynt is therfore, that we haue Thre neceſſari poyntes knowlege to diſcerne what is to be refuſed or clene obboliſſed, and what is to be accepte. Secondly, where as the fleſh draweth us to in ordinate affectiō we muſt hate that wich we knou to be euel, &amp; loue that which is honeſte, wholſome ād good. Thirdly where as infirmite ouercometh us is either with tediouſneſſe or with tentacion, we muſt be of good corage: and ſo contynue in the thinges which we haue wel begon ne, that we faynt not: ād that after we haue ſet oure hand to the ploughe, we loke not bacward, til we haue opteyned the crowue promiſed.

Which ſcripture is ſo agreable to the equite of nature, ād euery where ſo like it ſelfe, ſo rauiſeth, moueth, and altred the myndes of them that take hede thervnto, yea ād telleth of ſo many, great, wonderful and true thinges, that yf we oft conſidre the ſame, it ſhal ſtere us vp vnto more feruentneſſe both of faith, praier and vertue, beyng ſure, that as the rewarde of vice and of theſe momentany pleaſures, is both vexaciō of mynde and eternall

               The ſeconde rule.
               AS the firſt rule is thā, not to doute in the promiſes of god. So is With a good corage muſt we entre in to the waye of ſaluacion the ſeconde rule, that we entre in tho the waye of ſaluacion gladly, boldly, and with a good corage: that we be alwaye ready for Chriſtes ſake to leſe both lyfe and goodes: that we be not negligent, but feauent: that we ſuffre not the affectiōs of our louers, the pleaſures of this world, the care of oure houſholde, the chaine of wordly buſyneſſe, to hold us back from the kyngdome of heauen. For we muſt for ſake Egypte, that we turne not agayne to the fleſh portes therof: So haiſt out of Sodome, that we loke not back: So fiee out of Babylon and from the vyces therof, that we do it ſpedely without prolonginge of the tyme: that we truſt no longer to our ſelues, but committe us wholli vnto the lorde, that we ſerue him altogether, and no other maſter: that we halth not on both legges.

For the lorde is ſo gelous ouer oure ſoules, that he wil haue al that he hath redemed with his bloude, and can not ſuffre the fele ſhipe of the deuell, whō he ones ouercame by his deathe. So be there but two waies onely, the one of Two wayes onely ſaluation, the other of perdicion. The ſtrayte waye is it that we muſt walke, wherin to, though few do entre, yet muſt we conſidre that we are as much bounde as other men, to leade a Chriſten lyfe, to take Chriſtes croſſe vpon us, and to folowe him. For yf it belōg vnto us to lyue with Chriſt, and to ryſe agayne to eternall lyfe, then belongeth it alſo vnto us to dye with him, and to be crucified with him as touching the worlde, ſynne ād carnal deſures. Which as it is an hard thing and knowne wnto few, ſo is it the comen and general profeſſion of al Chriſten men, ſworne and promiſed in baptyme the moſt holy and religious vowe of all. And though there be neuer ſo few that perfitly folowe the head, yet muſt we al enforce oure ſelues to come therto. For of al Chriſten men they are the beſt, that with ſtedfaſt hert and purpoſe are ſtil mynded ſo to be.

               The thirde rule.
               THe thirde rule is, that we utterly deſpiſe and count for a thing we muſt deſpiſe what ſo euer leadeth frō the waye of Chriſt. of naught, watſoeuer wold feaer us from the waye of vertue and of Chriſt, Which as it is of al other lifes the moſt commodious. So euen at the firſt ceaſeth it to be ſharpe, and in proces is made eaſier, pleaſaunt, and delectable, wherby we go with ſure hope, and that without laboure, to eternal felicite: where as theſe mad men of the world, with their owne extreme laboure, purchaſe eternal death: non though the waye of godlyneſſe were much more laborious thē the waye of the world yet the hope of rewarde and the cōforte of god ſwageth the tediouſſneſſe therof, and of bitter maketh it ſwete. But in the waye of the world, one care ād ſorou ſpringeth of an other without any quietneſſe. For notging is filthier or more laborious, thē, the bondage of nothing worſe, thē to be ſeruaunt vnto ſynne Egypte nothing more greuous then the captiuite of Babylō, nothing more intollerable thē the yoke of Pharao ād Nabugodonoſor. But Chriſtes ioke is pleaſaunt, his burthē is light. Summa

there lacketh no pleaſure, where a quyete conſciēce is: No miſery, where an vnquiete conſciēce crucifieth te mynde They that out of the vices of Babilon are conuerted vnto the lord, haue, experiēce herof, and can tel us, that nothing is more greuous, thē vice: nothing more eaſie, more chereful, or more cōfortable thē is vertue. Neuertheles though both the rewarde and laboures of vertue and vice where like, yet were is better to be vexed with Chriſt, then to ſwymme, in pleaſure with the deuell: which is ſo filthie, cruell ād diſcentful a maſter, that euery man ſhulde flee out of his ſeruyce, wherin is nothing but greuous laboure in purchacyng, ſorou ād thōght in leſyng, yea many thouſād ioperdies, miſerable care, perpetuall tourmēt, miſchaunce labour ſpēt in vaine, much grefe of hert ād mynde.

               The .xij. Chapter
               The fourth rule.
               THe fourth rule is, that we haue none other marke ād enſample Chriſt onely muſt be the marke and enſāple of our lyuing of lyuing, ſaue onely Chriſt who is nothing els ſaue charite, ſimplicite, innocēcie, paciēce, clēueſſe, &amp; what ſoeuer he himſelfe taught: To whō we directe oure iourney, yf we be ſo geuē oneli vnto vertue, that we loue &amp; deſire nothing but either Chriſt, or els for Chriſt: hating, abhorringe, flyeng &amp; anoydinge nothing but onely ſinne, or els for ſinnes ſake. And thus yf oure eye be pure, al oure bodi ſhalbe bright ſo that what ſoeuer honeſt or indifferēt thing we take in hande, it ſhal turne to oure welth. As for filthie thinges, nether advauntagener puniſhmēt ſhulde make us to cōmitte them. Meane thinges verely and indifferēt ought no farther to be deſyred, then they are profitable to a chriſtē liuing. As for an enſā
                  ple. Conning or lerning muſt be loued for chriſtes ſake: ſo that whā we know

him and the ſecretes of his ſcripture, we loue him in ſuch ſorte, that openyng him vnto other, we both take frute of him our ſelues, and yf we haue knowlege of other ſciences, we vſe them all to his honoure. For better it is to haue Loue is more excellent then knowlege leſſe knowlege &amp; more loue, then much to know and not to loue. This euery thing, ſo farre forth as it helpeth moſt vnto vertue, ought chefely to be applied. But rather ought we to lack them then that they ſhulde holde us back from Chriſt: Unto whom we ought to haiſt ſo ferueutly, that we ſhulde haue no leyſure to care for other thinges, whether they be geuen us or taken awaye from us: but euen to vſe the worlde as yf we vſed it not. After this rule yf we examen al oure ſtudies and actes, than like as hauyng a craft or occupacion we wil not laboure to defraude oure neghbours, but to fynde oure houſholdes and to wynne thē vnto Chriſt. Euen ſo whan we faſt, praye or vſe any ſuch lyke, we ſhal not do it for any carnall purpoſe, but proceade on ſtil til we come vnto Chriſt, nether goyng out of the waye, ver doyng or ſuffring any thing, that ſhal not myniſtre

               The .xiij. Chapter.
               The fifth rule.
               THe fifth rule is, that we counte it parfite godlyneſſe, alwaye to We muſt aſcende from thinges viſible, to thinges inuiſible applie our ſelues to aſcēde frō thinges viſible to thinges inuiſible. Which yf we do not: then are we no true honourers of god, but playne ſuperſticious. And yet beyng ſtraungers in this viſible world, what ſoeuer offreth it ſelfe to oure ſenſible powers, we conſidering it, ought to applie the ſame either to the world angelical, or els to maners, euen vnto god, and to the inuiſible porciō of oure ſelues. And thus the thing that we perceaue bi our ſenſible wites, ſhalbe vnto us an occaſion of godlyneſſe: Yea by the light of this viſible Sonne we ſhal lerne, that great is the pleaſure of the inhabitauntes of heauen, vpon whom the eternall light of god is euer ſhyninge. And like wiſe by the darck night, we ſhal thynke how horrible it is, a ſoule to be deſtitute of the lihht of god: and that yf the beautie of the body be pleaſaunt, the beautie of the ſoule is much more honeſt. For the leſſe felyng we haue in thynges

tranſitory and of the body, ād the leſſe we are moued thee with, the more the leſſe delyte we haue in erthy thinges, the more pleaſure haue we inheauenly. ſwetneſſe we fynde in thinges perteyning to the ſprete, ād the better are we aquainted with thinges eternal: to the loue wherof we ought to arriſe from thinges tēporal, &amp; in cōpariſō of the other euen to deſpyſe them, and more to fear the diſeaſe, poyſon ād death of the ſoule, thē of the body: Yee the wrathe of god, more then any thonder or lichtenyng, The miſterie therfore in al thinges ought to loked vpō, aſwel whā we conſidre the outward creatures &amp; workes of god, as in the ſtudie of his holy ſcripture: the ſprete wherof &amp; not the baren lettre muſt ſpecially be ſearched out, &amp; the allegories handled, not dreamyngly allegories. or vnfrutefully, nether with ſubtyl diſputacions) after the maner of oure diuynes, that are to much addicte to Ariſtotel) but wel fauouredly, after the euſāple of the olde doctours: for in aſmuch as it is the ſprete that geueth life &amp; libertie: therfore in al maner lettres &amp; in al oure actes we muſt haue reſpecte to the ſprete &amp; frutes therof &amp; not to the fleſh &amp; his frutes: wiſhing rather to be priuely alowed in the ſight of god,

thē opēly in the ſight of man: rather to In ſprete &amp; verite wil god be worſhipped. whorſipe god in ſprete &amp; verite, then other wiſe, rather to eate Chriſtes fleſh &amp; drinke his bloude ſpiritualli, thē oneli with the mouth: rather to be quickened &amp; to haue life in the ſprete, thē hangingſ. Ihons goſpel or an Agnus dei aboute oure neckes, to reioyſe in any carn all thing, where the ſpreſe is not preſēt: rather to be one ſprete with the ſprete of chriſt, to be one bodi with his, to be a quicke mēbre of his church thē without frute to ſaye or heare many maſſes: rather to haue a cleane &amp; ſaueri minde, ād to ſtudie to walke with chriſt in new life, thē to haue the bodi waſhed, touched with ſalt, anointed, or ſprēcled with holy water: rather to ropreſēt &amp; folou the vertuous &amp; bleſſed doctrine of ſayntes, We muſt folow chriſt in his ſaintes. yea to counterfaite chriſt in thē, thē to reioyſe in touching their relikes, to honoure their bones, or to be buried in a gray freres cote rather to expreſſe the lyuely and very ymage of Chriſt ſet forth in his owne ductryne, ād liuinge, thē to crepe to te cruſſe, or ta haue at home a pece of the wod that it was made of: rather to aſcēde to more parfitneſſe of the ſprete, to grou in parfite loue

and charite, and to offre a contrite and humble hert vnto god, then to haue cō
                  fidence in carnal thinges, or ſuperſticyous ceremonies, tradicions and inuentions of men: rather to do the thinge that the eyes of god requyre, thē to pleaſe the eyes of men: rather to procure the quyetneſſe, and innocencie of the mynde, and to ſeke the nouriſhmēt the rof by the true hearing, ſeynge and feling of the word of god in the ſoule, thē by the outward ſenſes of the body: rather with inward medicynes to heale the hurtes of the foule, and by the winges of loue to flie vp to the ſprere, then crepyng on the ground with vncleane beeſtes, to be ſtil vnlerned in the miſteries of Chriſt, or to be deſtitute of the ſwete lycoure that commeth of him.
            
            
               The .xiiij. Chapter.
               The .vi. rule.
               THe ſixte rule is, that varieng aſ much as is poſſible both from We muſt vary from the comen people, the dedes and opynions of the comen ſorte of men, we fette the enſample of godlyneſſe at none, ſaue onely at Chriſt himſelf, the onely true patron and fourme of lyuinge, the onely true pathe and right hie waye. For loke as

are the opinions wher with oure myndes be inſtructed, ſuch are alſo oure maners and conuerſacion. And therfore Chriſten men in bringing vp their children, ſhulde chefely care, that euen frō the cradle they be Chriſtenly perſuaded, ād not lerne to ſynge filthie or wā
                  ton ſonges, to wayle or wrynge their handes for the loſſe of worldly goodes, to recōpence euel for euell. For towe is not readier to catche fyre, then man is diſpoſed vnto vice: which chefely proceadeth of euel opinious, whan in ſteade of a ſwete thing, we embrace it that is ſower, and whan for it that might do us good, we folow our oune damage ād loſſe. Wherfore conſidering that the comen ſorte of people and their maners now adaies be moſt corrupte, and ſeyng ther is no worſe authour of lyuinge thē they be: for aſmuch Iſaie, as the flocke of good men is but ſmal, peavice more regarded then vertue. No eſtate, nothing ſhulde make us to go frō the trueth, no opynion, no name or parſone of mā ſhulde moue us to tread one ynthe from Chriſtes trueth, or from the lyfe of vertue: Wherof non adaies mē are more aſhamed, then were the Neithen in tymes paſt: Yea to be a right

Chriſtē mā, is accōpted euery where a very vyle thing: ſo vayne is the world and in ſo great reputacion haue thei it to be borne of noble bloud, to be riche, to haue their pleaſures, to be ſtrōg and valeaunt, to be praiſed of the world, to be accōpted worldly wyſe: whā in veridede the chefeſt nobilite of al is to be the child of god, the chefeſt riches is to true nobilite true riches. true pleaſure true ſtrength poſſeſſe him in whō are al thinges: the chefeſt pleaſure of al is ſo to delite in Chriſt, that we be moued with the loue of none other luſt: the chefeſt ſtrength is, whā a mā hath ſo ouercome himſelf, that he cā finde in his hert to deipiſe al iniuries, to recōpēce good for euel, to praie for thē that curſe him. The chefeſt praiſe of al is, for godlynes ſake to be true praiſe mocked &amp; laughed at of euel men, &amp; to be approued of Chriſt: the chefeſt wiſdome of al is, to be circumſpecte in prouidyng true wiſdome for the life to come. Summa, we muſt not cōforme our ſelues to this world, but ſo alter oure myndes, that we herken and approue, not what is the wil of mē, but what is the good, wel pleaſinge, and parfite wil of god. For yf we moue not the eyes of oure hert from Chriſt, but folowe

his verite, we ſhal not go out of the waye. Yf we walke after his light, ſo that it ſhyne vnto us, we ſhal nether ſtumble in darkneſſe, ner fal in to the blynde errours, opinions or ſectes of the world.

               THis excellent lernyng then of Chriſt muſt be ſtabliſhed in us, that we thinke us not to be borne vnto oure ſelues, but to the honour of god and welth of al men. So that louyng him agayne which beſtowed himſelfe on us all toghether for oure redemption, we alſo for his ſake loue other men, and abhorre their vices: hauing not onely reſpecte to their nede, and what we are able to do for thē, but alſo remēbringe the manifolde cauſes that by reaſon ſhulde moue us to loue them, to tendre them, to be at one with thē, and not to accompte them as ſtraungers, or to hate thē for any alteraciō of veſture or of any ſuch trifle yea in no wiſe to deſpiſe them, but eſtemyng their hurt our awue, to conſidre, that what ſoeuer we haue receaued

it is geuen us to beſtowe vpon thē, and to increace in edifieng of them in charite. This lerninge wil induce men to deſyre no vengeaunce, but to be the ſōnes of their father in heauen, to ouercome euell with good, to ſuffre hurt rather then to do it: to forgeue other mēs offē
                  ces: to be gentle in maners: Yf they be connynge, to for heare and amende the ignorance of the vnlerned: Yf they be riche, to be circumſpecte in diſtributinge the goodes that god hath geuen thē; In pouer te to be aſwel contēt as other men: In office to be more carefull and diligent in conſydering their charge: In notyng the maners of euel perſones, yet not to deſpiſe the profeſſion of vertue: In labouring for a comen office or in executing of the ſame, to do it alwaye for the profit of the comen and not for their awne ſingular welth: beyng ready, euen with the loſſe of their awne life and gōodes, to defende that which is right: beyng lothe to haue preeminence, Offices of Chriſtē men. which yf it chaunce vnto thē yet to thinke that they alſo haue a lorde and maſter in heauen, euen Ieſus Chriſt, and that no mā is bounde to folow his doctrine more ſtrately thē they

that he will of no man aſke more ſtraite accomptes then of them, that they leine not to their awne willes, that they flater not thēſelues in euell: that their maners beſuch as deſerue riches, honoure, reuerence, dignite, fauoure, and auctorite: that they them ſelues be not giltie in the offences which they do puniſhe in other: that they deſpiſe no man in compariſon of thē ſelues: that in bearinge rule, they mynde not ſo much to excelle as to profite all men: that they turne not to their awne profit the thinges which are comen, but beſtowe that they haue yea and themſelues alſo vpon the comen welth: that in their titles of honoure they refarre all ſuch thinges vnto god: that in myniſtring their office, they fetch not enſample of their predeceſſours, or of flaterers, but onely of Chriſt: that they be ready rather to leſe their domyniōs then Chriſt, who hath a farre better thing to geue them. For nothing is ſo comly, ſo excellent, ſo gloryous, to kynges, prynces and rulers, as in ſymilitude to drauwe nyghe vnto the higheſt, greateſt and beſt kyng, euen Ieſu: Namely, in ſteade of violence to xeercyſe

charite, and to be myuiſtre vnto all mē. Inconcluſion, we muſt ſo cleue vnto the lerning of Chriſt, and be ſo circumſpecte ther in, that we cloke not oure We maye not cloke our awne vyces with other mens falles. awne vices with other mens failes. For though holy men haue ſomtyme done any thing not to be folowed (as Dauid, whā he commutted aduoutrie and murther: Salomon, whan he had ſo many quenes and concubynes. Not, whan he was droncken: Loth, wan he laye with his awne daughters: Mary Magdalene, whan ſhe ſyune ſo ſore: Peter, whan he denyed the lorde: Paul, whan he perſecuted the church of god.) Yet ought we to do nothing that varieth from Chriſt: but as we haue bene like other men in ſynne, ſo ſhulde we be companyons and parteners alſo with them that repent and turne vnto god. And as for other mens dedes, we ought not churhſhly ſo much to barch agaynſt them, nether with cruelneſſe to feare them, as with ſoftneſſe and

Therfore ought we ſo to prece vnto the beſt, that though we be not ſo parfite in all thinges as we ſhulde, oure mynde yet be not defyled with greuous offences, but more receaue able of the benefits of god. And though we can not do ſo well as holy and bleſſed men haue done before us, yet let us committe no worſe thinges then the heithen: Who though they had no parfite knowlege of god, yet was honeſtie dearer vnto them, then either fame, goodes, life, or any thing els in the world. And doutleſſe it ſhal notably withdraw us from ſynne, yf we pondre well in our myndes we muſt pondre the commodities of ſynne. the incommodities ther of, as infamye, pouertie, loſſe of goodes, wayſting of tyme, the hate of good men, grefe of mynde, miſerable vnquietneſſe of conſcience, with thouſandes mo

And though we can not atteyne to the moſt excellent vertue, yet ſhal it profit much, yf we beyng but in cyuile or morall vertues, ronne not headlonge in to all kynde of vyces. Notwithſtonding for aſmuch as that is not the reſting place and quyet hauen of felicite, but a ſhorter iourney ther vnto, we muſt pray ſtill vnto god, that he will vouchſafe to plucke us vp to better thinges.

For as yf we be ouercome, ther foloweth us a more paynful and longer grefe, then we ſhulde haue had in tyme of fight, yf we had wonne the victory: Euen ſo yf we be cōquerours ther foloweth us a more greate and lō

Thus beyng myndfull of all mightie god and his manifolde benefites, we ſhal not vnkyndly departe from ſo noble, ſo louyng, and ſo beneficiall a father, to make our ſelues wilfully bonde vnto the deuell, that moſt filthie and cruell maſter.

We muſt remembre, not onely that we came naked out naked we came &amp; nakd ſhal we go of oure mothers wōve, and ſhal naked got hither againe, but alſo that this preſent life with al his riches is vncertayne: &amp; therfore ſhuld we turne oure mindes frō the corrupte maners of the comē ſorte, &amp; rather content oure ſelues with pouertie: conſidering the fearful woo that chriſt threatheneth the riche men of this world.

and againe, that to be no honoure but rebuke, which is geuen of an vngodly perſone for an vngodly perſone for an nothing better, then a quyete meane life vnhoneſt thing. For the more honoure we diſcerue, the leſſe we deſyre it, beynge content with the conſciēce of well doynge. As for the honours that the comen people deſyre ſo greatly, they be but vayne, becauſe that as they geuen of them that put no difference betwene honeſtie and diſhoneſtie, ſo are they geuen oft for meane and filthie thinges, and that to the vnworty. Now yf any honoure be geuen vnto us, we ought to referre it al vnto god. Therfore like as nothinge is more ful of prickes, cares, perils and ſorowes then the life of greate men, ſo is nothing better then a quyete meane life. For ſeyng al honour is coupled with greate charge, beter it is for us humbling oure ſelues, to be partakers of mercie, then by ambicion to be excluded from the ſecoure of grace. Wherfore yf the enſample of Chriſt ſticke faſt in oure myndes, we ſhal lerne the better to deſpiſe al worldly honoure, and to reioyſe onely in the croſſe of chriſt. For yf we be diſpiſed of god, and abhorred of his angels, what

For a ſurer profe of incurable fooliſhneſſe and lack of vnderſtonding is not, then yf we ſtand greatly in our awne conceate. Wherfore yf for honour, beauty, cōnyng or any ſuch thing, we be moued vnto pryde, the beſt is to humble oure ſelues before god, and to conſidre oure awne deformities, In concluſion it ſhal chefely refrayne us from pride, yf we pondre well, not we muſt conſidre our awne deformities, onely what we are in oure ſelues, how filthie in oure birth, and as a buble of water in all oure life, yea euen wormes marte whā we dye, but alſo what Chriſt
