            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

handled, (which I could not so well finde time for before) I make bold to tender them here (such as they are) vnto your Lordship, and intreating onely your courteous acceptance of them, without further troubling your Honour amids so many weightier affaires, commit both your selfe and them to the gratious protection and holy direction of the Highest.

                      DAVIDS Remembrancer; as being penned by him for this end, to put God in minde of him, and of his present forlorne and distressed estate.
                  
                     The Psalme consisteth of three principall Parts.
                     Parts 3.
                  
                  There is first Vers. 1, 2. 
                     a grieuous complaint of his presentPart 1. condition; propounded by way of expostulation;
                     Complaint.
                  
                  
                     1. Vers. 1. In regard of God; who seemed not to regard him.
                     2. Vers. 2. In regard of himselfe, by meanes thereof driuen to his shifts, and in a manner at his wits end.
                     3. Vers. 2. In regard of his aduersaries; who tooke occasion thereby to triumph and insult ouer him.
                  
                  There is secondly Vers. 3, 4. an humble suit and request
                     Part 2. commenced by him to God, and conceiued in three distinct parts, answering the three branches of his former complaint. For 1. Vers. 3. Hee requestethRequest. God that he would Respice, refertur ad, Usque quo avertis faciem? Exaudi, ad, Usque quo obliuisceris? Aug. in Psal. 12. 
                     Behold and heare; that hee would vouchsafe to regard him, and turne his face againe towards him, and not send him away, inaudita querelà, vnheard and vnanswered.

                  To returne to the first Branch of his Complaint, which I purpose only to insist on.Branch 2.
                  
                  
                     First, for the Manner of it, or Phrase it is conceiuedManner. in; there are foure seuerall Readings, thoughReadings 4. in effect for sense and substance much the same.
                  For 1. Some reade the words of the formerReading 1. Part, without stop or stay, as one continued sentence; Graec. Sept. Lat. Vulgat. Ang. Genev. Reg. Bibl. Calvin. alij. 
                     How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for euer? But they both neglect the pause in the Hebrew; and beside make no very good sense.
                  2. Others make a pause, but a pause misplaced;Reading 2. and they thus reade them; Usquequo, Domine, oblivisceris me? In finem? Remig. in Psal. 12. Erit hoc usque quo in aeternum? Hugo Card. ibid. Sic Vatabl. &amp; Leo Iudae. 
                     How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget mee? For euer? As elsewhere, Psal. 74. 10. 
                     How long, O God, shall the Aduersary reproach? shall the enemie blaspheme thy Name for euer? But the pause here in the Originall, is after Domine; not after Obliuisceris.
                  
                  3. Others placing the pause aright, reade the words as an Aposiopesis, that is, a broken or imperfectReading 3. sentence, not vnfit to expresse passion. Quousque, Domine? subaudi, non intueberis? oblivisceris mei in aeternum? Iun.

                        usque, Domine? How long, O Lord? As if he had said; How long will it be ere thou minde me? In aeternum obliuisceris? Wilt thou neuer againe thinke on mee? How long wilt thou hide thy face away from me? And the like we may find in diuers other places; Psal. 79. 5. 
                     How long, O Lord? wilt thou be angrie for euer? Shall thy iealousie burne like fire? And, Psal. 89. 46. 
                     How long, Lord? Wilt thou hide thy face for euer? Shall thy wrath burne like fire? Yea the very selfe-same Aposiopesis apparantly, where he saith; Psal. 6. 3. 
                     But thou, O Lord, how long? And, Psal. 90. 13. 
                     Returne, O Lord: how long? And let it repent thee concerning thy seruants: As also of

                  4. It may well be read by way of Reduplication,
                     Reading 4.
                     
                     Per epimonen repetendo ingeminat. Cassiod. (a forme very fit also to expresse the vehement affection of a soule surcharged with sorrow, and pincht in with paine;) enclosing the middle part of the Verse within a Parenthesis: How long, O Lord? (wilt thou neuer remember me?) how long, (I say) wilt thou hide thy face away from me? And the like Reduplication is found also elsewhere, where hee saith, Psal. 94. 3. 
                     How long shall the wicked, O Lord? How long (I say) shall the wicked exult?
                  
                  Either of the two latter may well stand with the Context of the words in the Originall.

                  1. There are two things complained of:Substance.
                  
                  1. That God had forgotten him.
                  
                  2. That he had hid his face away from him. Both Nec oblivio, nec aversio cadit in Deum. Remig. in hunc Psal. Neutrum De' reverâ facit, sed more nostro Scriptura loquitur. Aug. &amp; Ruffin. in hunc locum. Per

                     For God therefore to forget DAVID, not to minde him, or looke after him, is much! If his eie be neuer so little once off vs, the spirituall aduersarie is readie presently to seize on vs, Aeriae potestates tanquam milvi circumvolitant, ut pullum infirmum abripiant. Aug. in Psal. 62. &amp; in Psal. 90. as the Kite on the Chicke, if the Hen looke not carefully after it.

                     only ioy and stay, to turne his face away from him, that hee may not minde him, as if Psal. 27. 9. in anger and euill-will towards him, he had cast off all care of him, yea were resolued to reiect him, and were willing to expose him to the will of those that would Psal. 38. 16. reioyce in his ruine: this is much more. There is an vnmindfulnesse of him implied in the former; an euill minde▪ towards him implied in the latter.
                  And surely, if Psal. 30. 5. 
                     in the fauour of God there be life; yea Psal. 63. 3.

despaire, were there not somewhat else (euen Psal. 37. 24. an hand of God himselfe) to support and vphold it.
                  And yet was this, as we see here, DAVIDS estate at the present. He complaineth that God had forgotten him, yea he had hid his face from him: this discomfortable estate had lasted long with him alreadie, and it was vncertaine yet how long it would last.

                  Now in this manner doth God indeed forgetDistinction. some; some hee seemeth to forget, though indeed he doe not forget them.
                  As Ambrose saith, That Quosdam deserit, quosdam deserere videtur. Ambr. in Psal. 118. 
                     God doth wholly forsake some: as he did Matth. 27. 5. 
                     Iudas and 2 Sam. 7. 15. 
                     Saul, whom he vtterly cast off. Some he seemeth to forsake, but he forsaketh not indeed. As our Sauiour Christ, albeit Esai. 53. 4. God seemed to haue forsaken him, when not onely Act. 2. 23. hee left him in his cruell enemies hands, and Luke 22. 53. suffered them to worke their wils vpon him, but euen 2 Cor. 5. 21. Esai. 53. 6, 10. powred out his owne heauie wrath and indignation vpon him; and he complained therefore as before, That Mark. 15. 34. 
                     his God had forsaken him; yet was he not indeed then forsaken, but euen then Hebr. 5. 7. 
                     heard and helpt; 
                     Iohn 16. 32. 
                     nor was he euer left alone; but though Matth. 26. 56. 
                     his Disciples all forsooke him▪ and fled from him; yet his Father forsooke him not, but abode euer with him: And DAVID, though Psal. 22. 1. he complain sometime in the same termes that our Sauiour did; yet elsewhere

                     Psal. 31. 22. he acknowledgeth that how soeuer he had said in his haste, (in the heat of temptation,) that he was cast out of Gods sight, yet euen then did God heare him, and grant his requests.
                  
                  In like manner, some God thus forgetteth indeed. (As Hosh. 8. 14.

Some he seemeth to forget, when he doth not. Deus benos non negligit, cum negligit. Nec obliviscitur, sed quasi obliviscitur. Ruffin. in Psal. 
                     Hee neglecteth not the godly, no not when hee neglecteth them: Yea, Obscuris super nos dispositionibus Deus saepe unde nos aestimatur deserere, inde nos recipit; &amp; unde nos recipere creditur, inde derelinquit: ut plaerunque hoc fiat gratiâ quod ira dicitur; &amp; hoc aliquando ira sit, quod gratia putatur. Gregor. mor. l. 5. c. 5. hee remembreth them then best, when he seemeth least to regard them, when he seemeth most of all to forget them. Though the wicked, when he hath his will on the poore, thinketh that Psal. 10. 11.

                     the poore, saith the Psalmist, shall not alwaies be forgotten; nor the hope of the afflicted perish for euer. But Psal. 9. 12. 
                     God when he maketh inquisition for bloud, will make it appeare then that hee remembreth them, and that hee doth not forget the poore mans complaint, nor will euer

The Deuill slandered Iob, and traduced him, as if he had beene but an hireling, Iob 1. 9, 10, 11. one that serued God onely to serue his owne turne vpon God; and would therefore soone leaue God, if God should seeme to leaue him, yea would not stick to curse God, if he should but a little anger him, to his face.

So dealeth God with his children, when they haue done amisse and runne riot, though vpon their repentance he be at one againe with them, yet he concealeth it long many times; neither is his countenance oft the same for a long time after towards them, that formerly it had beene.

After that Absolom by a traine had made away his brother Ammon, and was fled vpon it to Geshur; DAVID a Father but too indulgent, (1 King. 1. 6. 2 Sam. 18. 5. that was his fault, and he smarted shrewdly for it) after some space of time, when the sorow for his son Ammon was ouer, began to earne inwardly after Absolom; and since that Ammon was gone, hee was loth to lose the comfort of his Absolom also, whom he loued but too well, and farre better than his Absolom loued him. And though hee stroue to conceale it, yet Sed malè dissimulat: quis enim celaveritignem, Lumine qui semper proditur ipse suo? Ovid. ep. 12. Apparet facilè dissimulatus amor.

DAVID had to Nathan freely confessed his offence, and Nathan from God againe assured him of the free and full forgiuenesse of it; The Lord hath taken away thy sinne, thou shalt not die for it: Yet the Lord, the more throughly to humble him for it, and to make him the more wary for the time to come of shunning that that might produce againe such fearefull effects, Est quidā etiam tranquilli maris tremor, aut lacus qui ex tempestate requievit. Senec. de tranquill. c. 1. did not looke vpon him so louingly for a long time after, as before he had wont to doe. Reade but the Psalme that hee made after Nathan had beene with him; and see how earnestly and instantly hee crieth and calleth vpon God still, Psal. 51. 1, 8, 9, 11, 12. 
                     to turne his face away from his sinne, and to looke in mercy vpon himselfe, not to cast him wholly out of his sight, nor to take his good Spirit vtterly away from him, to restore vnto him againe those inward comforts and ioyes, which Psal.

And in like manner doth God deale with many other of his deare seruants, after some hainous and notorious crimes by them committed, he withdraweth oft his face and fauourable countenance away from them, not till they repent onely, but euen after they haue repented of them, to make them wiser

and warier for the time to come, and to detest their owne folly the more for the present.

                     Count it matter of much ioy, my brethren, saith Iames, when you fall into many trials, or troubles. Since you know that the triall of your faith bringeth forth patience: And let patience haue her perfect worke, that you may be sound and entire. And Omnipotens Deus quid nobis profuturum sit sciens, dolentium exaudire vocem saepe dissimulat, ut utilitatē augeat, dum per poenā vita penitius purgatur. Greg. mor. l. 14. c. 18. Vota differens cruciat, crucians purgat, ut ad percipiendum quod desiderant, ex dilatione melius convalescant. Idem ibid. l. 8. c. 17. for the furthering and consummating of this worke, doth God oftentimes thus withdraw himselfe, as it were, out of the way, and seemeth to keepe aloofe off, when he is yet neere at hand with vs. He doth as the Physitian or Surgeon

doth with his Patient, when he meeteth with a sore festred or full of dead flesh: Hee applieth some sharpe corrasiue to purge the wound, and to eat out the dead flesh, that would else hinder the cure.

Aug. in Psal. 90. &amp; in Psal. 98. &amp; in Psal. 130. &amp; in 1 Ioan. 6. Which being done, the Patient, it may be, impatient of paine, as soone as he feeleth the smart of it, crieth to haue it remoued. But he telleth him, No, it must stay there till it haue eaten to the quicke, and effected that throughly for which it is applied. And to this purpose hauing giuen charge to them that be about him, to see that nothing be stirred till hee come againe to him, withdraweth and retireth himselfe till it be full time to take it off againe. Meane while the Patient lying in paine, counteth euery minute an houre till the Surgion come backe againe, and if he stay long, thinketh that sure he hath forgotten him, while he is taken vp with other Patients, or is otherwise imployed, and wil neuer in any time returne again to him: when as the Surgion, it may be, is all this while but in the very next roome to him, there by the houre-glasse, to that purpose set vp, attending but the time, till the plaister haue wrought that that it is to effect. And in the very selfe-same manner doth God deale oft with his dearest ones. Thus 2 Cor. 12. 7, 8, 9. 
                     Paul buffeted by Satan, (it was no small corrasiue and heart-sore, you may be well assured, that troubled so much so magnanimous a spirit as his was) was instant with God more than once or twice to be rid of that euill.

                        in Euāg. l. 5. c. 24. the answer he had from God was, that he must patiently abide it: hee should

not want his grace that should enable him to vndergoe it. But it would be worse with him, if it were otherwise; he would be in much perill of being puffed vp with pride, if he were wholly freed from it. Yea thus DAVID, when Gods hand was somtime vpon him, and he felt it harsh and heauy, he crieth earnestly vnto God, to haue it remoued from him: Psal. 39. 10. 
                     Take, saith he, thy plague away from mee; I am euen consumed with the stroke of thine hand. And he pleadeth with God, as the Patient would doe with the Physitian, when he is full of paine with that that is applied, he is sure that the plaister hath done enough by this time:

                     Profered ware, for the most part, is but slightly esteemed of. Wee make light of the first and the latter raine, of the constant

course of the Sunne, and the seasons of the yeere, though on these things dependeth the stay and the staffe of our life, because they come commonly in a constant and an ordinary course: But when a little dash of raine commeth after fasting and praier vpon a long drought, wee are vsually as more affected with it, so more thankfull to God for it, than for all the sweet dewes or the plentifull showres that Iob 38. 37. 
                     Gods flagons shed downe vpon vs the whole yeere before. Oh, saith DAVID, when he had some space of time found a restraint of Gods fauour, that before he had enioyed, now if God would vouchsafe to looke louingly vpon him, and restore him the wonted sight and sense of his fauour againe, Psal. 51. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. 
                     he would teach sinners Gods wayes, and his mouth should set forth Gods praise; and he would offer vp to God any thing, that he should desire and would accept of. And for this cause, no doubt, among others, doth God make vs many times sue long for it, and cry with DAVID, How long, Lord? before it doe come; to make it more welcome to vs, and vs more thankfull for it when it doth come.

If God, when (for iust causes best knowne to himselfe, and for the most part for euill desert and bad demeanure on our part) he hath turned his face away from vs, and carried himselfe strangely toward vs, hee should by and by sodainly vpon the first and least bend of our hamme, or formall sob, or superficiall sigh, or a forced teare or twaine, or some faint and heartlesse prayer turne it againe toward vs, and looke kindly againe on vs; -

But now when wee shall finde by wofull and dreadfull experience in the bitternesse of our spirits, that Gods face being once clouded toward vs, or turned from vs, it must, or may at least cost vs many a deepe sigh, and a salt teare, long looking, and much longing, euen Psal. 119. 81; 82, 123. till our heart faint, and our eyes faile, much anguish of minde and perplexitie of spirit, much striuing and strugling with our owne corruption and weaknesse, and much straining and wrestling by earnest suit

and supplication, by fasting and instancie of prayer, ere we can come to preuaile so farre with God, as to haue those thicke clouds of his wrath dispelled, and that louing and amiable aspect of his vouchsafed vs againe; this cannot but make vs (if we be not desperately retchlesse) exceeding carefull of all good courses that may keepe and retaine it with vs, when we haue it, and no lesse fearefull of ought that may againe estrange it away from vs. The Spouse in the Canticles, when after long search, with much adoe, shee had at length lighted on her beloued, Cant. 5. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. &amp; 3. 1, 2, 3. whom by her neglect of him, shee had vnaduisedly giuen occasion to withdraw himselfe from her: Cant. 3. 4. Tenui, nec dimittam eum. 
                     I tooke hold on him, saith shee, and I will not let him goe againe. And, Psal. 80. 18, 19. Irae interveniunt, redeunt rursum in gratiam. Verùmirae si que fortè eveniunt hujusmodi inter eos, rursum ubi reventum in gratiam est, Bis tanto amici sunt inter se quàm prius. Plaut. Amph. 3. 2. 
                     Turne away from thy wrath, say the people of God to God in the Psalme, and Let thy face shine forth once againe on vs: and then will we neuer goe backe from thee againe, nor giue thee the like cause to turne thy face againe from vs.
                  And thus you see both in what sense God is said to hide his face from his, and for a long time oft (as both to themselues and to others seemeth) to forget them; as also for what causes he is wont so to doe.

He so loueth his children, as he hath a care of their good; and disposeth and administreth all things so as may be for it. A fond mother would haue her sonne alwaies by her good will at home with her, and neuer out of her sight; would haue him crossed in nothing, but let him haue his will in euery thing, though it be to his owne euill. But the wise parent driueth him out at doores, sendeth him forth to schoole, bindeth him apprentice, it may be, or boordeth him abroad, where hee seeth him but seldome, breaketh him oft of his will, frowneth on him and correcteth him when he doth otherwise than well; and yet Quis magis amat? pater an mater? mater ardentius, pater constantius.

                  Secondly, This may be a warning to GodsVse 2. children, to take heed how they take libertie to sinne vpon assurance of Gods fauour, and

presumption of his goodnesse and fatherly louing kindnesse. For though God doe loue vs, yet he doateth not on vs. Psal. 89. 30, 31, 32, 34. &amp; 99. 8. If we carry our selues saucily or stubbornly towards him, he will not beare it; if we take bad courses, he will not endure it. He will not suffer vs through his forbearance of vs to be hardened in euill: but by some meanes or other he wil be sure to bring vs home againe, if at least we belong to him, and to his election of loue. And though he cast vs not off vtterly, though he damne vs not eternally; yet he may so seeme to forget vs, so estrange himselfe from vs, so withdraw and with-hold from vs the light of his countenance, that the bright beames of his fauour may neuer shine forth again on vs, as formerly they haue done, so long as wee liue, and so may we come to haue not a purgatorie, but a very hell in our soules while wee liue here; Esai. 38. 15. goe drooping and dwindling, distressed, distracted and de

                     ected all our life long, and be in little better case for the time than the reprobate oft are, yea than the very deuils and damned soules in hell themselues. Though we escape with our liues, yet the cure may be so costly, and the course of Physicke and Surgery that God shall take with vs, may be so harsh and vnpleasant, may put vs to those bitter pangs, and vnsupportable paines, that it may make vs curse the day that euer wee did wittingly and willingly that that might prouoke such a wrath, or require such a cure, and wish a thousand and a thousand times that we had beene, not fast asleepe in our beds,

but dead and buried in our graues when wee did it.
                  It is a vaine thing therefore for any man to presume so, as to say or thinke, God will neuer sure deale so roughly with me, though I cary my selfe otherwise then I ought towards him. Yea it is most fearefull and dangerous vpon such impious imaginations to presume to displease &amp; prouoke him to wrath. For to omit that An quia Deu

                     it is a note of a most vngracious disposition for a man therefore to be euil, because God is good; and to take libertie to himselfe to wrong God, because God loueth him. Art thou dearer to God than DAVID was? Art thou deeper in Gods bookes, or higher in his fauour than he? Yet how sharply God dealt with him; how roughly, yea how rigorously (as might seeme to fleshly reason) he handled him, hauing prouoked him to wrath, and incurred his displeasure, may appeare by those Psal. 32. 3, 4. &amp; 38. 2 - 8. &amp; 51. 3, 8, &amp;c. Psalmes wherein at large he complaineth of it. And how long it was in these cases ere he could recouer his former estate of inward comfort and sense of grace with God againe, appeareth likewise by his earnest suit, so oft and so instantly commenced for it, both here and Psal. 51. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, &amp;c. else-where.
                  Thirdly, The consideration hereof should instructVse 3. vs, not to be vtterly dismaid and discouraged, if either wee shall finde and feele our owne estate, or shall see and obserue the state of Gods Church and children to be such as DAVIDS was at this present, and all Israels at other times.

And hereby may it appeare what our faith and confidence is founded on, whether on Gods word or his pledge, his pawne or his promise: If when the pledge or the pawne is gone, yet our faith abideth stil firme, it is a signe that it was fixed on God himselfe, and not on it: But if when it is gone, our faith falleth to the ground, it is a signe that our faith was wholly founded on it, not on God or Gods word, which abiding still firme, our faith were it thereon founded would continue stedfast with it. For Psal. 125. 1. 
                     Those that trust in the Lord, saith the Psalmist, are as Mount Sion, that standeth fast, and neuer stirreth. And this is that that we should by all meanes labour

                  And in like manner should we be affected also in regard of Gods Church, when wee shall see it to be in such estate as was formerly obserued. We should make her case our owne; and take occasion thereby, to be the more instant with God, that his face may be turned to it, that seemeth to be turned from it, and that in mercie and

goodnesse hee will remember and thinke vpon her as his Spouse, whom now, when Lament. 1. 1, 2.

And the like vse should we all make, either of Gods hand on our selues, or of his dealings in this kinde with his Church and children abroad, albeit we our selues remaine free: Esai 62. 7, 8.

                  For to this very end doth God oft as it were winke, and withdraw himselfe from his people, that wee may with strong cries on all hands awake and fetch him againe. True it is indeed that God is not as Baal, of whom Elias sometime said to his Priests, 1 King. 18. 27.

                     Vp, Lord, say they, why sleepest thou? Awake, we beseech thee; and stand not aloofe off for euer. Why dost thou hide thy face away from vs? and forgettest what misery and affliction we are in? As the Disciples to our Sauiour, when they awoke him out of sleepe; Matth. 8. 25.

                     Mark. 4. 38. 
                     Carest thou not that wee perish? And againe, Psal. 78. 65. 
                     The Lord awaked, as one that had beene asleepe. Thus at this very present doth God seeme to be asleepe, while the enemies of his Church daily preuaile and get ground of her, and triumph ouer her. Hee seemeth, I say, to sleepe, and hee would by our out-cries be awaked. And sure it is to be doubted that we haue not yet cried long enough or loud enough, that he seemeth to sleep still, and doth not yet rouse and raise vp himselfe for the deliuerance of his distressed ones.

                  Let vs beware therefore of impatience; But let vs take heed especially, how any length of afflictionsVse 7. maketh vs once thinke of leauing God, or of seeking with Saul to Satan, by putting our hands vnto wickednesse, or vsing indirect courses, for the saluing and easing or releeuing of our selues. It was the Deuils policie that he vsed, but without successe, with our Sauiour; Matth. 4. 3, 4. to beare him in hand that his Father had cast off all care of him, thereby to perswade him to depend no longer vpon his prouidence, who if he did loue him or regard him, would not so suffer him to starue. And it is one of the slights that euen to this day he vseth oft with Gods seruants, thereby in time of affliction to withdraw them from relying on God, who seemeth not to looke after them, as if they were sure to perish, if they shifted not for themselues, but trusted still to him, that had no care at all of them. And howsoeuer by this engine he preuailed not with our Sauiour, yet by it with many other, too many, too oft he preuailes, and maketh them commit much folly. For while

All the difference betweene the one and the other is this; that to the one it is said, Deny Christ, or thou shalt die; to the other it is said, Doe euill, or thou shalt liue wretchedly, thou shalt liue a life little better, if not worse, than death. He is once for all a Martyr, that will rather endure the one; he is oft, yea euery day a Martyr, as Paul saith of himselfe, that 1 Cor. 15. 31.

                     HAVING vpon some enducements (how weightie I leaue to the censure of others; but such as to methen seemed not altogether vnsufficient) cōceiued a purpose of publishing the former Discourse, I thought it not amisse to annex this ensuing vnto it, as meetly well suting with the Argument therein handled, and not vnfit therfore to second it. And remembring withall, that among other of those, whom I owe dutie and respect vnto, I

had not hitherto▪ remembred your selfe in this kinde, I checked my selfe for it, and resolued with my selfe not to rest longer guiltie of such neglect. I know I shall not need in many words to intreat your Worships kinde acceptance of it, either for mine owne sake, or for it selfe. The one I am bold to presume of vpon experience of your wonted courteous vsage and professed respect of mee farre aboue my desert. The other the subiect Matter of it maketh mee confident of: Which what it is, either the bare Title, or Text it selfe will soone acquaint you withall: And both ioyntly together will (I hope) helpe sufficiently either to couer or to counteruaile, the rawnesse and rudenesse, or what euer other defects in my weake and vnworthy Manner of handling so singular a Subiect, may seeme any way to blemish the Worke. I was neuer furnished with any store of Rhetoricall lights: And am willing therefore the rather to embelish my writings with such borrowed helpes as my poore reading affordeth either out of holy or humane Writers:

                  Adde we but one Example more; and that shall be of the Prophet Ieremies confident cariage in this kinde: He had foretold that Ierem. 34, 2. 
                     Ierusalem should be sacked by the Chaldeans. And the Chaldeans accordingly came and begirt it. But the Iewes thus besieged send to Aegypt for succour. And the King of Aegypt commeth with a great force, raiseth the siege, and releeueth the Citie. Hereupon began the false Prophets to triumph and insult ouer Ieremie, as if he were taken now with the manner, and detected of falsehood, as one that had fore-told that that was not like to be effected. But the Prophet telleth them confidently, relying on Gods word, That Ierem. 37. 10.

                  And hereby may we try the efficacie of our faith, if euen then we beleeue these things, when there is no sight or shew at all of them; which it is better for vs to beleeue now, when it may be for our benefit, than by wofull experience to be taught the truth of them hereafter, when it shall be too late for vs to beleeue that which we shall not then heare from others, or see in others, but feele and sustaine sensibly our selues.
                  But because all will say they beleeue thus;Effect 2. Feare. come we to the touchstone, to the triall. How did NOAES faith appeare? or wherein was it shewed? His Faith bred Feare. By faith-moued with feare. As he beleeued the thing told him by God to be true; so he feared the issue, he expected the euent of it with feare. And by this his disposition he teacheth vs what the nature of true faith is, that in such cases as this was, Fides facit formidinem. Tertull. ad Marc. Quādo incipit quis credere, incipit timere. Si cepit credere, cepit &amp; timere. Bern. mod. viv. c. 4. 
                     Faith breedeth Feare.
                     Point 3.
                  
                  There are two ordinarie attendants of faith, faith of future things I meane, and those such as may concerne vs either directly or indirectly, Hope and Feare. And true faith hath euer one of these twaine attending on it, according to the nature of the thing apprehended by it. If it be a good thing that faith apprehendeth, it expecteth it with hope; if an euill thing, with feare. If it be

a promise that Faith layeth hold on, it breedeth hope: if it be a threatning that Faith fastneth on, it worketh Feare.
                  
                  Yea these two affections, Credulitie and Timiditie, Faith and Feare, doe mutually and enterchangeably succeed either other, produce either other. Faith breedeth Feare, and Feare breedeth Faith. Credulitie maketh men timorous: and Timiditie maketh men credulous. Credula res timor est, quod de amore Ovid▪ epist. 6. 
                     Feare is very credulous, and suspitious, 
                     Pessimus in dubiss augur timor. Stat. Theb▪ l. 3. Sed malus interpres rerum metus omne trahebat Augurium pejore via. - Claud. bell. Gild. Ad tristē partem strenua est suspicio. P. Syr. Prona est timori semper in pejus fides. Sen. Herc. sur. 2. readie to incline to the worse side, and to fasten vpon euery shadow and least shew of that that it surmiseth. And as Timiditie is credulous, so Credulitie is as timorous, enforcing the minde to hang in continuall suspence and expectation of those euils that it apprehendeth as imminent.

                  The reason is in a word: Faith hath it from God, to whom all things are present; for there is no Prius &amp; posterius. former and latter, first or last Omnia semel &amp; simul videt, quorum nullum est quod non semper videt. Aug. de Trin. l. 15. c. 14. Deo in conspectu praesto simul sunt universa, praesentia, praetenta, futura. Ibid. cap. 7. with him. And hauing them from him, Fides enim velut quoddam aeternitatis exemplar, praeterita simul, ac praesentia, ac futura sinu quodam vastissimo comprehendit, ut nihil ei praetereat, nihil pereat, nihil praeeat. Bern. de temp. 17. shee apprehendeth them in some sort as they are with him, on whose

word alone, or principally at least, shee beleeueth them.
                  The vse of which point may be, First of all toVse 1. Information. informe vs, what the reason is why there is so little feare in the world, of God, and of his Iudgements. Neuer more wickednesse abroad in the world: neuer iuster cause to expect some generall iudgement. And yet neuer more securitie; neuer lesse feare; Quasi securos esse sola esset securitas. as if it were the only meanes of securitie or of safetie for men to be secure. Whereas saith that worthy Bishop Grosthed well in one of his Epistles yet vnprinted, Sola istic securitas est nunquam esse securum. R

                     It is our best and surest securitie, for vs neuer to be secure.
                  
                  But what is the reason hereof? Surely therefore so little feare, because so little 
                     Quod non credit quis, non movet eum ad sperandum vel timendū. Beda in axiom. 
                     Faith. The generall want of feare argueth a generall want of Faith. Therefore neuer more securitie, because neuer lesse faith. Our Sauiour himselfe intimateth as much. He telleth of Math. 24. 6, 7, 8. 
                     a world of troubles, ouer and beside a 
                     Matth. 24. 12. 2 Tim. 3. 1-5. 
                     world of wickednesse, that should be toward the worlds end. And yet withall that Math. 24. 37, 38, 39. it should then be, as before the Floud it had beene, when men 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . Quod plus est, quam comedebant &amp; bibebant. Matth. 24. 38. gaue themselues wholly to eating and drinking, building and planting, making merry and marrying: and as they did nothing else, so 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . Matth. 24. 39. they minded nought else, till the Floud came in suddenly and swept them all away at once. 1 Thess. 5. 3. 
                     They shall crie, Peace, Peace, and all is well; saith the Apostle, vntill sudden destruction surprise them, as paines and pangs doe a woman with childe, taken before her reckoning be out. And the reason hereof our Sauiour secretly doth elsewhere

imply, when he saith, Luk. 18. 8. 
                     The Sonne of Man when he commeth, shall he finde Faith vpon earth? As if scarce any Faith should be found in the world at the worlds end: and the most therefore should make but a mocke of the last Iudgement, as 2 Pet. 3. 3, 4. Iude 18. Saint Peter also fore-telleth.
                  
                  Yea this generall securitie and want of feare,Vse 2. Conuiction. sheweth that euen the greatest part of those that professe themselues Christians, haue not so much Faith as many damned ones, 1 King. 21. 27. 
                     Ahab, 
                     Matth. 27. 3, 5. 
                     Iudas and others, haue had; nay, not so much Faith as the Deuils themselues haue; For Iam. 2. 19. 
                     the Deuils, saith Saint Iames, beleeue and tremble: which they would also doe, if they beleeued but as they did. If they had no more but euen the Historical faith, it could not but worke in them the seruile Feare. And how can they looke to scape hell, that come short herein of those that be already in hell: that are worse in this regard than Ahab, though an hypocrite, though a reprobate, worse than Iudas himselfe, though Iohn 6. 70. 
                     a Deuill incarnate; yea worse herein than those damned Spirits, than the Deuils themselues. And Quanta damnatio à damnatis damnari? Autor de fingul. cleric. what a fearefull estate is it to be condemned of those, that either are or shall themselues be damned?
                  
                  Secondly, This may serue to shew a differenceVse 3. Distinction. betweene Gods Children and worldly men, together with the ground of it.
                  When warning is giuen of Gods Iudgements, as here there was, Malach. 3. 16, 17. They feare least, whom they most concerne; and they feare most, whom they least concerne. They feare most, that haue least

cause to feare; and they feare least, that haue most cause to feare. He feared here that was to be saued; when they feared not that were to be destroyed. Gods children oft-times feare for them, when they feare not for themselues. As for matter of griefe, DAVID saith of himselfe, Psal. 119. 148. 
                     I beheld the transgressors and was grieued, to see how they brake thy Law: And, Psal. 119. 136. 
                     Mine eyes run downe with streames of water, because men keepe not thy Statutes. He was grieued for them, when they were not grieued for themselues; yea hee sorrowed, with 2 Cor. 12. 21. 
                     Paul, for them and their sinnes, because they sorrowed not for them themselues. Si doles, condoleo; si non doles, doleo tamen: &amp; boc doleo magis, quo tu minus doles. Bern. de consid l. 1.

                     1 Cor. 12. 26. Membro dolenti membra reliqua condolent. In the naturall Body the paine of one limbe causeth paine to all his fellow limbes: but in the spirituall Bodie politique, not the paine only of a limbe, but De non dolente caetera grauius dolent. 
                     the want of paine in a limbe, is a meanes of paine to the fellow-members. So for matter of feare;

The sucking childe lieth in the cradle, not once dreaming of any danger; and the parents feare and care is all for it.
                  
                     Thirdly, hereby may we examine our Faith,
                     Vse 4. whether it be sound and sincere or no.Examination. Triall 1.
                  
                  First, If it worke vpon the affections. If it worke in vs, loue or hatred, ioy or griefe, hope or feare, according to the nature of the obiect, the qualitie of the thing apprehended. For that faith or knowledge that swimmeth only in the braine, but sinketh not downe into the heart, that consisteth only in speculation, and proceedeth no further, doth not at all pierce into, or worke vpon the affections, it is no sound knowledge, no true faith; it is but as the glittring of a glow-worme, a light without heat.
                  
                  Why, saith Bernard, doth Salomon say, That Prov. 1. 7. &amp; 9. 10. 
                     the feare of God is the beginning of wisdome; when as Knowledge and Faith goe both before Feare? Because, saith he, there is Instructio doctos reddit; affectio sapientes. Ibi instruimur; sed hîc afficimur. Ibi in auditorio docentem Magistram Sapientiam audimus; hîc &amp; suscipimus. Bern. in Cant. 23. no true wisdome in either, vnlesse they doe worke in a man this Feare. 
                     Sol non omnes quibus lucet, etiam calefacit: Sic fapientia multos quos docet quid sit faciendum, non continuò accendit ad faciendum. Ibid. 
                     The Sunne, saith hee, affordeth light to many, whom it imparteth no heat to. And it is not the light of it, but the heat, that quickeneth, and maketh fertile and fruitfull. Aliud est multas divitias scire, aliud &amp; possidere; nec notitia divitem facit sed possessio: sic aliud est nosse Deū, aliud timere; nec cognitio sapientem, sed timor facit, quia &amp; afficit. Ibid. Vera demum ea est scientia, quae afficit. Greg. mor. l. 23. c. 17. 
                     It is one thing to know wherein wealth consisteth, and another thing to haue it; and it is not the knowing of it, but the hauing of it that maketh a man rich and wealthy: So it is one thing to know God, and another thing to feare God; and it is not the knowledge of him, but the feare of him; and the knowledge of him so farre forth, as it bringeth vs to the feare of him, as a mans skill so farre forth as it is a meanes to bring wealth to him, that maketh a man wise and happie. And that knowledge or faith therefore, that

worketh not in this manner vpon the affections, is but Umbra &amp; larua fidei, non fides. 
                     a liuelesse shadow, a dead counterfeit of Faith.
                  
                  Secondly, if it make vs stand in awe of GodTriall 2. and his Iudgements; which he inflicteth oft vpon others, euen to keepe vs in awe. So 2 Sam. 6. 7, 9. when God smote Vzza in DAVIDS sight, DAVID (it is said) feared God exceedingly that day. He feared him before, but exceedingly then: that roused vp, renewed, and made his feare more fresh. And Act. 5. 5, 10, 11. when Ananias and Sapphira were so suddenly slaine, feare came vpon the whole Church, and vpon all those, not that saw it onely, but that heard of it.
                  
                  This is the nature of true Faith, to worke in mens hearts, not a presumptuous securitie, and a regardlesnesse of God, but an awfull feare, a reuerent dread, a trembling at his Maiestie, when he giueth but warning of Iudgements to come; and much more then Esai. 26. 9. 
                     when his Iudgements are already abroad in the world. 
                     Psal. 119. 120. 
                     My flesh trembleth, saith DAVID, for feare of thee, and I am (euen heartily) afraid of thy Iudgements. And surely if it be the property of the childe of God 
                     Esai. 66. 2. Habb. 3. 16. 
                     to tremble at his word: 
                     2 King. 22. 19. 
                     Iosias heart melted againe for feare at the hearing of the Law: how much more at his worke, at his rod, at his scourge, at the shaking of his sword? What awefull childe will not tremble to see his father take the rod in hand, and it be but to correct some seruant therewith? much more if it be to scourge one of his brethren. To feare any euill is naturall:

to be afraid of Gods anger is a worke euen of grace too. And

                     Blessed is the man that feareth God. So that He that is not afraid so, yet doth feare. Some

                  And we shall doe well to obserue how theSolution. Distinction. Holy Ghost therefore oft ioyneth these two together: Psal. 33. 18. 
                     The eye of the Lord is vpon them that feare him, and that hope or trust (for hope and trust are in effect here, as oftIerem. 17. 7. Psal. 146. 5. else-where; the same) in his mercy. And againe, Psal. 147. 11. 
                     The Lords delight is in them that feare him, and that hope▪ or trust in his mercy.
                  
                  In which places, as it is well obserued by Augustine, that the Psalmist Cùm dixisset, Timentes, adjecit, Sperantes. hauing said, that feare him, he addeth withall, and that trust or hope in him; to exclude the former feare. For, saith he, Nunquid enim sic timetur Deus, quo modo &amp; latro? nam &amp; latro timetur, &amp; bestia timetur, &amp;c. Si times latronem, ab alio speras auxilium, &amp; non ab eo quem times: qui sic timet, poscit auxilium ab eo quem non timet, adversus eum quem timet, &amp;c. Aug. in Psal. 146. 
                     Men feare a theefe, or a wilde beast, in one manner;
                     
                     and children feare their parents in another manner. Men feare the one, so as they flie from them; good children the other, so as they seeke to them. And in the latter manner, not in the former, ought men to feare God. Wicked men and damned spirits feare him so, as Mark. 1. 24. they flie from him: Gods children so feare him, as that yet they sue and seeke to him: If they seeme to flie from him, it is but to flie to him; they flie but from his Iustice to his Mercie: as he that appealed sometime Machetas quidā Macedo. Plut. in apophth. 
                     from Philip to Philip, from Philip sleeping to Philip awaked: So doe Vis ab illo fugere? ad ipsum fuge. Vis fugere ab irato? fuge ad placatum. Aug. ibid. &amp; in Ps. 30. &amp; in 1. Ioan. 6. 
                     they flie from God to God, from God in iustice angrie with them, to the same God in mercie pacified and appeased towards them.
                  So againe on the other side doth Bernard well obserue, that Dicturus, Sperantes, praemisit, Timentes. Bern. in Ps. Qui habitat, serm. 1. being to say, that hope in him, he saith first, that feare him. For, saith he well, there are foure
                           •…
                         sorts of men: Sunt qui non sperant: sunt qui desperant: sunt qui frustra &amp; maniter; sunt qui bene &amp; utiliter sperant. Ib. some hope not, some despaire, some hope in vaine, and some hope aright.
                  
                  The first sort is of those that Neque timent, neque sperant.

                     nor feare; neither hope for Gods mercy, nor feare Gods wrath; it is all one to them, whether God be angrie or not angrie, whether he be pleased or displeased with them.
                  The second sort is of those that Timent, sed non sperant. Qui sperat &amp; non timet, negligens est: qui timet, &amp; non sperat, depressus est. Aug. ad fratr. erem. 10.

                     Sort 2. 
                     not; they feare Gods wrath, but they hope not in his mercie: they haue both their eyes fixed on the wrath and iustice of God, neither eye on his mercie or goodnesse, and so come to be swallowed vp with despaire.
                  
                     The third sort is of those Sperant, sed non timent. that hope, but feare

Bern. ibid. so presuming on his mercie, but hauing no regard to his wrath, they take libertie to themselues to lie and liue in sinne, without any remorse of conscience or repentance for the same.

                  The first of them neither hope nor feare; the second feare, but hope not; the third hope, but feare not; the fourth hope and feare.

As Lots sonnes in law, when their wiues Father told them of a showre of fire and brimstone that should come and destroy all Sodome,

So saith Basil of NOA, when he told the World of a Floud that should swallow vp the whole World, and set himselfe thereupon about the building of an Arke, of such strange forme and bulke, a worke of so great toile and charge, to saue himselfe and his houshold in,

But all this NOA contemned, and notwithstanding all this, hee went not about only, but through with that that God had enioyned.

As NOA before he could goe about that building, hee must first fell his wood, saw out his planckes, hew out his timber, &amp;c. So before we can raise this spirituall building, we must pull downe 2 Cor. 10. 4, 5. an old frame, an erection 1 Iohn 3. 8. of the Deuils rearing, that standeth where it must stand, and rid the place of the rubbish and remainders of it: Now this requireth much toile and labour, and will take vs vp much time: And yet wee deferre and put off all, and thinke wee

shall haue time enough for it hereafter, though Psal. 90. 9. none of vs are like to liue neare

                      euils, wherof no print or foot-step was to be seene at the present. And NOA is striken with feare, &amp; prepareth presently to preuent it. God giueth vs warning not by word only, but by deed, by euident arguments of his wrath alreadie broke forth, and burning vp our brethren almost on euery side of vs. And yet Psal. 90. 11. who layeth it to heart, or prepareth to preuent the euill that so euidently appeareth to approach?
                  Now what is the reason of such difference both in the one kinde and in the other? (NOA so carefull, and we so carelesse:) but that he beleeued and feared; and we doe not? What else was it, that made Lots Sonnes▪ in law stay still in Sodome, though they were told what would become of it? What else, that made some of those Aegyptians so carelesse, as to leaue men and beasts abroad, when Moses had giuen warning of the storme that should come? But that Genes. 19. 9. the one beleeued not Lots word; Exod. 9. 21. the other feared not the Lords word: the one beleeued not, and therefore feared not; and the other

feared not, because they beleeued not? neither of both cared, because neither of both feared. And what else is it that maketh men stay still in their sinne, and make no prouision to preuent Gods wrath, both reuealed in his word,Vse 2. Conuiction. 
                     Rom. 1. 18. and manifested in his worke; but that they beleeue not the one, they dread not the other?
                  And this may conuince multitudes, euen of professed Christians, to haue neither Faith nor Feare. 
                     Heu, vivunt homines, tanquā mors nulla sequatur; Et velut infernus fabula vana foret. They liue so securely, so carelesly, as if there were neither heauen nor hell: they prepare no more to meet God, when in wrath he seemeth to approach, then as if Esai. 5. 18, 19. they cared not whether he came or no▪
                  
                  Yet should wee aske any of these, whether they beleeued the word of God or no, whether they feared the wrath of God or no? they would answer, they did; and be angrie that any man should make doubt of it: they should be Qui pudorē amisit; bestia par est, qui timorein, bestiâ pejor est.

course therefore let euery one of vs take without further delay; and pray that others also may doe the like. It may be that God hearing the prayers, seeing the teares, and regarding the repentance of some few, may be moued to shew mercie on the whole, though the generalitie remaine still vnreformed.

We shall be marked out for saluation, as Ezech. 9. 4. those were that the Prophet speaketh of, in the generall destruction. And one of these three shall vndoubtedly befall vs: Either wee shall be Esai. 57. 1. taken away, with 2 King. 22. 20.
