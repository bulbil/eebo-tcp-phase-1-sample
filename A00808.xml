            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               ❧ To the Right Worſhipful, the Mayſters, and Wardens, of the companies of the Cittie of London, Iohn Fit Iohn, wiſheth long lyfe, continuall health, and proſperous felicitie.
            
               ALthough I haue bene ſomewhat bold, and rude, to intermeddle my ſelfe wyth that kynde of excercyſe, which I haue made, and enterpryſe to doe, it maye be aunſwered, that I had nothing to doe withall, I haue to excuſe my ſelfe, that the frayltye of this world is ſuch, that I am perſwaded, duety inforceth me, and neceſſitye ſo vrgeth me thereto, conſydering the vnſtedfaſt ſtabilitye that is vſed among thoſe men which are mayſters, and alſo of yonglinges, which are ſeruauntes, or Apprentyſes, (vſe the tearme of ſpéech thereof, as it ſhall pleaſe you) I thoughte good to gather this my ſymple Harueſte into Barne, and to beſtowe it abroade, whereby the poore, indigent and néedy, might be ſufficed with the fruitefulneſſe thereof, of neceſſitye I may call them pore and needy, which I am ſure eyther for lacke of good inſtructions, otherwyſe for wante that they be not good hearers, are and doe fall, the more is the pittie, headlong into ſo many daungers, and perrils that they are innumerable, &amp; for that it is a thing moſt wholſom and conuenient, for al thoſe which haue and doe take vpon them the charge of a ſtewardſhip, or to be a Captayne of a number of Souldyers, whervnto they ought to haue care &amp; regard. And ſéeing that Agapetus was not abaſhed to wryte vnto the Emperour Iuſtinian: and dyuers others without feare hath written vnto Kinges, Noble men, and others, I without blame, thought good therefore, Worſhipfull, to dedicate

this my Harueſt vnto your Worſhips, for as much as you are in place to be inſtructoures, fathers, and ſheapheardes ouer a great Flock of ſhéepe, and I know your carefull myndes is ouer them, as much as the Henne is ouer her Chickens, your Worſhippes good willes is not withdrawne, to plucke and roote out Vice, and to extoll right, equitie, and Iuſtice, and that with Conſcience. In lyke maner do I wyſh that thoſe Souldyors or Flocke which are vnderneath your authoritye, would follow the commaundements of the Apoſtle: Omnis anima poteſtatibus ſupereminētibus ſubdita 
               Rom. 13. 
               ſit. Nō enim eſt poteſtas niſi a Deo. Let euery ſoule ſubmit himſelf vnto ye authority of the higher powers. For there is no power but of God, all powers are ordayned of God, whoſoeuer therefore reſyſteth power, reſiſteth the ordynaunce of God. And they that reſiſte, ſhall receiue to themſelues damnation. S. Peeter alſo 1. Peter. 2. exhorteth &amp; commandeth, that we ought to be ſubiect to euery humayn creature, for the Lords ſake. Siue regi tanquam precellenti ſiue preſidibus. Whether it be vnto the King, as vnto the chiefe head, eyther vnto Rulers, as vnto them that are ſent of him, for the puniſhment of euill doers: but for the lawde and prayſe of them that doe well. Further, the wyſe man Cato ſayth, Da locum maioribus. He willeth vs to giue place vnto the Cato. Elders. In lyke manner you are aunciente and diſcreete, men growen in age, being in Authoritie, and aboue all thinges, ought ſo to behaue your ſelues, that Math. 5. both your workes and wordes may ſo ſhyne, that they may glorifye the father which is in heauen. Godlynes is a thing moſte worthy to be imbraced, and practyſed both of old and yong, which bringeth as S. Iohn ſayth by knowledge, euerlaſting lyfe. Eſpecially what is Iohn. 17. Eccleſiaſt. more comely for olde age, whoſe departure from thys worlde, by the courſe of nature is at hand, then the conſydering and meditation of heuenly things. Age which

is reuerend, is not accoūted by length of time, or number of yeres, for ye wyt of man is not the hore heyres. What is old age. But very age is ye life vncorrupted. How ſéemely is it to a whyte head, to haue a good iudgement, and to old men to vnderſtand counſaile?
            There is nothing more reprochful, ſayth Seneca, than Seneca. an old man, which hath none other argument to proue that he hath lyued long, but only his yeares. S. Paule 
               Titus. 2. requyreth the Eldermen that they be ſage, diſcréete, and ſound in the fayth, and would haue them ſage and and graue. That is to ſaye, ſuch perſons, as neyther in countenaunce, geſtures, words, or behauyour, ſhoulde ſhew any poynt of lightneſſe, incontinencie, impudencie, or whatſoeuer is contrary to the dignitye of olde age, but rather ſo behaue themſelues in all poynts, as becommeth their age, whoſe life ought to be vnſpotted, and a Myrrour of Vertue, and a ſpectacle to all yong folkes. Alſo he requyreth thoſe that be aged, or in Authoritie, to be diſcréete, temperate, quyet; not raſh, not vncircumſpect, not furyous in doing any thing of head, but with good aduyſement and iudgement, vūng ſuch temperaunce and grauitie, and ſuch diſcretion in all their enterpriſes, as ſhal not be counted vnworthy nor vnſemely for their age. For as much as whē I had finiſhed this mine enterpryſe, which I haue takē in hand, I thought good with my ſelfe that this my dedication, before recyted, would accompliſh my deſyre, for that your wyſedomes are ſuch to conſyder well therof, and ſomewhat herein I admoniſh al thoſe which are in authoritie, exhorting them, as it is written. Thou ſhalte take no giftes, for giftes blynd the ſyght, and peruert the words of the righteous. Iob ſayth: the fire ſhal conſume the houſes of ſuch as are ready to receyue gyfts. For as gyftes and brybes cauſeth the ſubuerſion of Iuſtice. Likewyſe doth friendſhip many times, and the old Prouerb herein is true. As a man is friended, ſo is

his matter ended. He is a iuſt mā that ſpareth not himſelfe. King Ageſilaus being demaunded, which was Ageſilaus the better, eyther Iuſtice or Fortitude. He aunſwered if all men were iuſt, we néeded no Fortitude. The glorye of a man is to doe Iuſtice. Some that are in authoritye Eccleſia. are ſo raſh and vndiſcréete, that when matters of controuerſye be brought before them, the fyrſte Tale doth preuayle, and the other partye cannot be harde, although his cauſe be neuer ſo iuſt and good. Wherefore it is to be well marked of Alexander the great, Alexander. which when any man complayned to him of another, being abſent, he vſed to ſtoppe the other eare with hys hand he being demaunded why he did ſo, he aunſwered, that as he lefte open one eare to the Accuſante, ſo he would kéepe one eare ſtopped and cloſe for the Defendaunt.
            
               Eſay ſayeth: learne to doe right, applye your ſelues to Equitye, delyuer the oppreſſed, helpe the fatherleſſe Eſay. 1. to his right. The Prophet Zachary ſayth: Execute true iudgement, ſhew mercy and louing kyndeneſſe euery Zacha. 7. man to his Brother. The Apoſtle ſayth: Let not the Sunne go downe vpon your wrath, neither giue place Ephe. 4. vnto the backbyter. Let vs not loue in worde or in tongue, but in worke and truth, for he that is ſound in Iohn. 3. loue, loueth his neighbour as himſelfe, and is the very ſame vnto his neighbour, that Chriſt is to him. Briefely haue I calculated and gathered togither the flowers which are ſwéete and pleaſaunt, out of the Garden of lyfe, which is the holy ſcriptures, not thinking any offence to be committed herein, to ſlaunder any perticuler perſon, concerning Iuſtice, but ſhewing the eſtate as the world is now adayes, which is a thing not decent nor agréeable to ſcripture, we Engliſh people are geuen to deſyre new toyes and conceites, thinking the newneſſe thereof to be more of price then the olde, although it be neuer ſo fond. The ſcriptures are olde, my

trauayle and induſtry herein is but new, and the newneſſe thereof, is for the reformation and inſtructing as well of Mayſters, as alſo of ſeruaunts, haue I made in a new Dyalogue the vnderſtāding and true meaning of my mind, whereby it might the better be perceiued. And to ſhow for whoredome, ſwearing, lying, thefte, Dronkenneſſe, Idleneſſe, Couetouſneſſe, and Correction for the offenders. How the ſcripture and other Godly Authours doe alow. The Apoſtle ſayeth: What ſonne is he whome the Father chaſtneth not? if ye indure Hebr. 12. chaſtening, God offereth himſelfe vnto you, as vnto ſonnes, but if ye be not vnder correction, whereof all are partakers, then are ye no ſonnes, but Baſtardes. For whome the Lorde loueth, him he chaſteneth, Prou. 3. yea, he ſcourgeth euery ſonne that he receyueth. I moſte humbly craue your worſhippes pacience herein, if ought I haue varyed, for my Eloquence is not ſo fine as Cicero wryteth of dueties, to his ſonne, and as herein it might haue bene ſhewed, and am a yong Cicero. beginner of ſuch excercyſe, &amp; this being the fyrſt tyme of myne enterpryſe, I muſt cōfeſſe as before I haue declared vnto you, the occaſyon thereof. In lyke maner Tobias the auncient father, and faythfull ſeruaunt of Toby. God, taught his yong ſonne Tobias euen frō his tēder age, to feare God, and to refraine frō al ſin. His admonicious which he gaue to his ſonne, are ſo Godlye and profitable, ſo aduauncing vertue and repreſſing Vyce, that they may iuſtly ſéeme worthy to be written in letters of Golde. The Parentes of Suſanna broughte her vp from her youth, that ſhée was ſo Godly, ſo vertuous, Dany. 14, and ſo honeſt, that God would not ſuffer ye wicked Iudges to preuayle againſt her. Phillip the Euangeliſt, Act. 21. which was one of the ſeauen Deacons, had fower Daughters Virgines, &amp; he brought them vp ſo Godly and learnedly, that they were able to Prophecy

and vnderſtande the holy Scriptures. S. Paule declareth that Timothie euen from his infancye, and chyldhood Tim. 12. had learned and vnderſtoode the holy ſcriptures, which alone are able ſufficiently, and euen to the vttermoſt to iuſtructe the men of God vnto Saluation, through fayth in Chriſt Ieſu. Prouoked with ſuch like examples, I haue done myne indeuour to the vttermoſt of my power, to ſhew vnto your worſhips, thys wholſome ſéede of Doctryne, and my ſymple labour, truſting hereby, not ſo to weary my ſelf, to get nought but diſpleaſure, for Saluſt ſayth: It is extreme péeuiſhneſſe, Saluſt. yet doe I commend this vnto you, deſyring your worſhips to accept it as a ſynguler gifte, profytable, and delectable to be read, and neceſſary for the right and perfect inſtructions, according to the tenour which I haue taken in hand; whereof to be ignoraunt, is to much vngodlineſſe, but alſo not attempt any thing that ſhall eyther be diſpleaſaunt to God, or to Godlye and well learned, or to your ſelues. Take it therefore, I beſéech your Worſhips with ioyfull hartes, as a good wil towardes you, for other gyfte haue I not to giue you, and I ſhall moſt humbly beſéech God to be your defendour, and to giue you his holy ſpiryte, which may gouerne you all in your doinges, that you maye walke blameleſſe in his ſight, and be fonnde in the number of Gods elect. The euerlaſting peace of God in Ieſus Chriſt, the contynuall ayd, ſtrength, ioy, and comforte of his moſt pure, holy, and mighty ſpirite, with the increaſe of fayth, be moſt effectually wroughte in your hartes, to your owne commodities, eternal ioy and comforte.

               Yea in deede, I dwelt with my mother, but my father is dead, and lyeth buryed in the bodye of our Churche, almoſt three yeares paſt, but my mother I truſt is alyue.

               If thy mother be alyue, what didſt thou with her?
            
            
               Puer.
               Marye I did go to Plough and Carte, and kepte the Crowes out of the fielde, and fetch home the Kyne and other ſuch lyke thinges, which appertayne vnto huſbandry.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               In ſo doing thou didſt well, for Adam did worke in the Garden of Eden: Cayn Gene, 2. was a Plough man and tilled the earth: hys Gene. 3. brother Abell was a Sheaphearde, and kepte Sheepe: Noye was a planter of Vyneyardes, Gen. 4. and canſt thou not liue as thy father hath done before thee?
            
            
               Puer.
               No, I cannot lyue in that order, it is to paynefull for me, although my Father did Hedge and diche, digge and delue, and did bring me vp in the ſame trade, and you haue ſhewed me thoſe examples, I mynde not to doe

ſo.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               No, what wilte thou do then?
            
            
               Puer.
               What will I doe? I will tell you, I will be a Seruingman, and wayghte on a Gentleman, and then I ſhall goe a Hawking and Hunting and haue my delight as Gentlemen hath, I ſhall haue two new coates a yeare, I will haue my ſutes of Hoſe, my Hats with feathers, and be all in the brauerye, after the newe faſhyon, and ſometyme I ſhall wayght vpon a Gentlewoman, who woulde deſyre to lyue a merryer lyfe? or elſe I will to London to be a ſeruaunt.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               The old Prouerbe is true. A yong Courtyer, an old Begger, for they ſay ſeruice is none heritage, and if thou ſhouldeſt be vſed as Eſop doth declare in a fable, what wouldſt thou then Eſop. ſay to thy brauery?
            
            
               Puer.
               I pray you recyte the ſame to me.

               He was a man by whome there is a booke made, that I haue read, and is caled Eſops fables, wherin he likeneth a Seruingman to a Greyhound.
            
            
               Puer.
               He was a horeſon in deede, that would liken a man to a Dog. Why there is a great ſort that be Seruingmen and doth liue well ynough, and ſo I trowe I will.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               Yea I wil not deſpyſe ſeruingmen, for they are men neceſſary. But Eſope ſayeth, as long as a Greyhound is youthfull, and can follow his game, he ſhall be much made of, and as long as you are yong and luſtye, ſo maye you be, but when age commeth on you, as dyd on the Greyhound, then you ſhall not bee ſteemed,

but ready to be ſet at liberty without comforte.
            
            
               Puer.
               Why then I praye you tell me your mynde, what your aduyce is for me to doe.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               My counſell is to haue you go home agayne to your Mother, conſydering you ſay ſhe is an old woman, and your Father dead, ſhee is without friendſhip or comforte, and you ſhall be a good ſtay and a helper vnto her.
            
            
               Puer.
               I mynde not ſo to doe, for I know a way better then to doe ſo, ſhe hath geuen me Gods bleſſing and hers, and is well contented withall, and hath geuen mee Money in my Purſe, I may be bolde to ſay vnto you, beſydes that I take you to be an honeſt man, and a true man, elſe I woulde not haue tolde you, for there be ſo many men now a days of dyuers ſortes, I knowe not well whome to truſt.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               Thou ſayeſt truth in deede, the more is the pittie, for one man cannot truſt another, What wee ought to doe to our Parentes. Reuerence them. Leuiticus. 19. Eccle. 3. Here them. Epeſi. 6. Honour them. but yet Moiſes writeth as I remēber. Let euery one reuerence his Father and mother. Ieſus the ſonne of Syrach wryteth on this manner. Heare me your Father (O my deare Chyldren) and doe thereafter that ye may be ſafe, for the Lord will haue the father honoured of the children. Honor thy father and Mother, this is the fyrſt commaundement that hath any promyſe, that thou mayeſt be in good ſtate, and lyue long on the earth. And looke what a Mother commaundeth her children to doe, he will haue it kepte. Who ſo honoureth his Father, his ſinnes And why?
                  
ſhall be forgeuen him, and he that honoreth his mother, is one that gathereth treaſure togither, who ſo honoureth his Father, ſhall haue long life, and he that is obedyent for the Lords ſake, his mother ſhall haue ioy of him. Honour thy father from thy whole harte, forget not the ſorrowfull 
                     Eccle. 7. Howe wee ſhould honour our Parentes. Ephe. 6. Toby. 4. trauayle that thy mother had with thee. The Apoſtle ſayeth: Chyldren obay your fathers and mothers in the Lorde, for ſo it is right. Tobias ſayde to his ſonne, hold thy Mother in honour all the dayes of thy lyfe, for thou oughteſt to remember what and howe great perrill ſhe ſuffred for thee in her wombe.
            
            
               Puer.
               You are verye ſcripulous with mee to honour my mother, I doe not denye it, but I confeſſe my duetye is vnto my mother, yet may I doe that which I purpoſe to doe, for I am ſure you cannot tell me of any that doth practiſe ſuch obedience to Father or mother. Of my parte I promiſe you, I knowe not what obedience is, for it was neuer taught me.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               Then will I teach you eſpecially concerning our communycation. Fyrſt, I will ſhew you that obedience is What is obedience. a lowly and harty ſubmiſſyon of our ſelues to God, and afterwardes to our Parentes, to the Maieſtrates, to our ſuperyours, and to al thoſe to whome GOD hath committed the rule and gouernaunce of his Flocke and people in this worlde, or in iuſt cauſes, to all them to whome we be by any tytle inferyour.

               Puer.
               I am therewith content, I perceyue you haue had ſome intelligence &amp; knowledge of Scriptures, that can remember ſuch thinges vpon a ſodayne, yet I may loue both father and mother, and ſhew my duety and obedience vnto them, although I doe not dwell with them: For I muſt ſeeke how to behaue my ſelf, when God calleth thē away from me, out of this vale of miſery, to get my liuing as they haue done, for if I ſhould do as the Prouerbe is, loke after ded folks ſhoes, I might thāce to go barefote.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               And can you not liue by taking paynes with Huſbandrye, as your father and others haue done?
            
            
               Puer.
               No forſooth.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               And why ſo I pray you tell me?
            
            
               Puer.
               Mary ſyr there is ſuch moyling and toyling, and taking of great paynes, with harde fare, that I muſt needes to London to be a Townſeman, thereto liue more at eaſe.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               If euery one were of thy mynde, and ſo permitted to haue their owne wils, we might chaunce to faſt for lack of bread, Corne, and ſuch other neceſſaryes for mans body. But the truth is, at London thou mighteſt learne

ſome honeſt and profitable occupation, wherewith thou mayeſt be able to get thy own liuing in tyme to come, and to make prouiſion for ſuch as ſhall belong vnto thee hereafter, for if thou ſhouldſt be brought vp ydely, thou ſhouldeſt become an vnprofytable member in a common weale, and for lack of liuing, fal into many inconueniences, for it is written. Send him to labour, Eccle. 33. that he goeth not ydle, for ydleneſſe bringeth much euill. And agayne. Let no laborious Eccle. 7. worke be tedious vnto thee, neyther the Huſbandrye which the almightye God hath created. As the Byrds of the ayre are created to flie, Iob. 5. Prou. 29. ſo man is borne to labour. He that Tilleth his Land, ſhall haue plentiouſneſſe of bread, but he that followeth ydleneſſe, ſhall haue pouertie. Thou ſhalte eate the laboure of thy hands, Pſal. 128. ſayeth Dauid: O well is thee, and happy ſhalt thou be, wherefore be not weary in well doing.
            
            
               Puer.
               Although that theſe ſentences affyrm that labour is a thing neceſſary, I doe not denye it, for if a man eate or drinke, it is labour: if he goe abroad in the fields, it is labour: if he worke at any Science it is labour: al this I know.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               Yea, but there is further labour then that, there is a labour fyrſt to ſerue God, and remember howe much bounde thou arte vnto him for hys bountious and lyberall good giftes, whiche he doth beſtow on thee, thou muſt labour how to feare him, how to obay the Prince and her Miniſters,

and beſydes I wil ſhew you ſomewhat what commeth of ydleneſſe.
            
            
               Puer.
               I pray you let me here what ydleneſſe is, and the daunger thereof.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               I will mingle labour and ydleneſſe togyther, and as the Scripture alledgeth for them both, I will ſhew you. If the Mayſter Eccle. 33. doe ſet his ſeruaunt to labour, he ſhall fynd reſt, but if he let him go ydle, he ſhall ſeeke libertye. The yoake and the whippe boweth downe the harde necke, but let him tame the euill ſeruaunt with bondes and correction. Vnto the Horſe Proue. 26. ſaieth Salomon belōgeth a whip, vnto the Aſſe a bridle, and a rod to the fooles back. Like as the dore turneth about vpon the Threſhold, euen ſo doth the ſlouthfull welter himſelfe in bed. The ſluggard and ydle perſon thinketh himſelf wyſer then ſeuen men that are wyſe, and ſit and teach. Set him to laboure, for that belongeth vnto him. He that will not worke, ſhall not eate. An ydle hand maketh pore, but a quick labouring Prou. 10. hande maketh riche, who ſo gathereth in Sommer is wyſe, but he that is ſlouthfull and ſluggiſh in Harueſt, bringeth himſelfe to confuſyon. As vyneger is to the teeth, and as ſmoke is vnto the eyes, euen ſo is a ſluggiſh perſon to them that ſend him forth. A dilligent hand ſhall beare rule, but the ydle ſhall be vnder Tribute. Prou. 12. The ſluggard would fayne haue, and cannot get his deſyre, but the ſoule of the dilligent ſhall Prou. 13. haue plentie. The way of the ſlouthfull is full of Prou. 15.
                  
Thornes, but the ſtreat of the righteous is all cleanſed. Who ſo is ſlouthfull and ſlacke in hys Prou. 18. labour, is the brother of him that is a waſter. Slouthfulneſſe bringeth ſleepe, and an ydle Prou. 19. ſoule ſhall ſuffer hunger. A ſlouthfull body ſhutteth his hande in his boſome, ſo that for cold he cannot put it into his mouth. Voluptuouſneſſe Prou. 21. Tullye. of the ſlouthfull is his owne death, for by cuſtome of labour, we ſhall make the payne more eaſye to ſuffer. His hands will not labour. Antonyne Antonine an Emperour, withdrew from dyuers perſons their Pencions, and Sallaries, perceiuing them ydle, ſaying: that there was nothing more▪ reprochfull and cruell, then that they ſhould knawe and deuour the Weale publicke. Which with their labour nothing increaſed it.
            
            
               Puer.
               I confeſſe ydleneſſe hath taught much vnhappineſſe, Eccleſi. but I would God that we had ſuch an Antonyne here among vs, for then the Clergye woulde indeuour their ſelues to beſtowe their labour and paynes, whereby Gods word might increaſe.

               You ſaye truth, Dorcas Act. 9. was a vertuous woman, made Garmentes with her owne handes, and gaue them to the pore. Ioſeph was a Carpenter, his wyfe Mary Mark. 6. and the mother of Chriſt did ſpinne, and had Ioſephus. Gen▪ 4. knowledge in the Science of Weauing. Thubalkan was a Smith, and did labour to keepe himſelfe from ydleneſſe. The ſins of Sodome Ezec. 16. were theſe: Pryde, fulneſſe of meate, aboundaunce

and ydleneſſe. To labour and to be content Eccle. 40. with that a man hath, is a ſweete pleaſaunt lyfe, and that is to fynde a treaſure, aboue all treaſures.
               Treaſures that are wickedly gotten, profiteth Proue. 10. nothing, but righteouſnes deliuereth from deth.

               For all this your good exhortacions, I render vnto you thankes, praying to God that I may print them well in my mynd, and although before I tolde you that I would haue eaſe, and be a Townſeman, I confeſſe euery one is not borne to be a Prince, or a Ruler, nor to be a Huſbandman, nor an Artifycer, or Marchaunt, but the vocation that GOD hath called them vnto, they muſte bee contente with, yet I doe not abhorre or deſpyſe laboure, but doè proteſte your ſayinges to bee good and profytable: Notwithſtanding, of myne interpriſe which I haue taken in hande, I am not thorowly reſolued. The world is ſo now a dayes in that order, that one man dareth not diſcloſe his mynde to another, the more it is to be lamented, and yet they bragge and boaſt that the Goſpell is preached abroade, and it ſhould be the better. But it doth not appeare ſo, but as I haue harde my father and mother ſay, I would the olde learning-were vp agayne.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               So it is GOD be prayſed therefore, for this is the old Religion, and now the Goſpell flouriſheth, and it is long of the hearers, that doe not

printe the true and liuely word of Ieſus Chriſt, in their mindes, for it goeth in at the one eare, and out at the other (the more it is to be lamented, and I am ſorye therefore.
            
            
               Puer.
               Well, I cannot tel, but I haue heard my father ſay often tymes, that the holy and bleſſed Maſſe was a goodly thing, and then men liued more in fere.

               A goodly thing: no, no, you are a yong man, giue no attētiue eare vnto ſuch fond talke, it was a thing abhominable, and moſt deteſtable, I am ſure the Miniſter doth not teach you, but to the contrary.
            
            
               Puer.
               I cannot tell, hee ſayeth one thing without his booke, and he ſayeth another on his booke, but what it is, I doe not vnderſtand.

               The more is the pittie, haue you not preaching in your Church?

               I will teach you, but wilte thou not be perſwaded by me once agayne to goe backe agayne.
            
            
               Puer.
               No I thanke you, for I am ſure you ſpeake it vnto mee of Friendſhippe, yet GOD wylling, I will ſee London, and be a Townſeman there, for your perſwaſyons hath mooued mee not to bee a Seruingman.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               I am gladde that my eruditions hath ſo mooued you, but I coulde declare vnto you manye moe ſtoryes then that of Eſop, but you are yong, and not paſſing eyghteene yeares

olde, and when you come to London, you muſt be aprentiſe, and bound to ſerue ſeuen or eyght yeares, and if you ſerue your mayſter well and truly, you ſhal be a Free man of the ſame Citty, and that is your deſyre.

               It is euen ſo, yet I may be bolde to ſay vnto you, I am bounde alredy, I know not what you mene by bynding, my father was a bondman &amp; bound to a Gentleman in our countrey, they call him Mayſter L.

               Your bondage by the Lawes of this realme will profyte him, as Littleton declareth, and that will not ſerue Littleton for bondage. your tourne, when you ſhall be bounde, that queſtyon wil be demaunded of you, &amp; then that being knowne, you cannot be bound as an apprentice, but ſhall looſe your labour and be conſtrayned to goe into the countrey agayne.
            
            
               Puer.
               I can then ſay the contrary, for they knowe it not.

               You muſt not do ſo for that is an vntroth, and in ſo doing you ſhall not do well.
            
            
               Puer.
               Well, or not well, God willing, I will put it in tryall. But tell me now, you haue hard my mynde all this whyle, whether goe you? and what countreyman are you?

               I was born Northwardes, and am a Citizen of London, and there is my dwelling.

               What is that

Citizen? is it an occupation?
            
            
               Ciuis.
               It is no occupation, but all the inhabitauntes within the ſame Cittie, and being Freemen therof, are called Citizens.
            
            
               Puer.
               I thought they had bene called Townſemen. But I pray you tell me, what doe the ſeruauntes there? they ſaye here in the country, they take great paynes, and fetch water, and be cruelly whipped, and carryed to a place, they call it Brydewell.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               I tolde you before what commeth of eaſe and ydleneſſe,
whereby you might vnderſtande that paynes muſt be taken, and the moſt parte of them doe fetch water in a Tanckarde on their ſhoulders. I haue done it my ſelf, and ſo haue others, that are men of welth and worſhip dwelling there. And as for Brydewell, there is ſuch a place, Brydewell for all lewd and cuill perſons. which was erected and appoynted by the famous Prince King Henrye the ſixte, as by Rycharde Graftons Chronicle appeareth, at the humble ſute of the Cittizens of the ſame Cittie, and is ordayned for all thoſe lewde and ydle Perſons, as Vacabonds and ſuch lyke, and for thoſe yt are obſtinate &amp; naughty perſons, which will not liue in the feare of God, but abuſe their bodies with euill and lewde vyces, as Whoredome. &amp;c.
            
            
               Puer.
               Is that ſo? then I truſt in God I will not come thyther, for I will not vſe that euill excerciſe. Here in the country, the horeſons that are ſo luſty and play ſuch partes, bee not whipped, but ſtand in the Church in a Sheete.
            
            
               
               Ciuis.
               That is the ſpiritual lawes of this realme, and the abuſe of the follye is a thing worthy of puniſhment, for ſuch vyces are not ſufferable, I coulde ſhewe you Storyes what the Scripture ſayeth, concerning Whoredome.

               Keepe thee from the euill woman, and from Prou. 9. the flattering tongue of the harlot, that thou luſt not after her bewty in thine hart, and leaſt thou be taken with her fayre lookes.

               You haue remembred it well, they take no thought for liuing, which acquaynte themſelues with exceſſe. The Prophete exhorteth vs to walke honeſtly, as in the day, not in exceſſe Roma. 13. of eating and drinking, but put ye on the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.

               Theſe are ſhrewd Thunderbolts that you ſhoote at me, yet is there a ſaying: Drinke no 1.

Let men make themſelues merry with wyne, that afterward they may be more chearefull to obay God, and to ſuffer heauy thinges if neede be, and let men beware they forget not themſelues, that they ouerwhelme not their ſences, and choke vp their ſtrength.
               Wyne moderately dronken, is profytable for Eccle. 33. the lyfe of man. What is his lyfe that is ouercome with wyne?
            
            
               Ciuis.
               I will ſhew you. The ſmoth and playne ground, is vnto dronkards a Den, for they fal, breake their legges, their armes, and ſometime their neckes, and are burnt when they fail into the fyre. They lye wallowing lyke ſwyne, and worſe then the brute beaſte, which goeth to her vomite. Their lyuer is inflamed with to muche drinke, the heade is payned, the members are made weake and tremble, their ſences are corrupted, the naturall heat is ouerwhelmed with

ouermuch wine, ye ſtomack which is ouerlargely diſcēded, is ſick with crudity or rawnes, and with intollerable paynes: the whole body is in a maner inflamed, and the thirſt is augmented. Dronkardes lye groueling like blocks, &amp; ſo are bereued of their ſtrength that neither head nor foote can do their office. Wyne and dronkenes taketh away the hart. Wine and women make Oſea. 4. Eccle. 19. Plato. wyſe men runagates, and put men of vnderſtanding from right inſtitutions. A dronkarde hath a tyrannicall harte, for he would rule all men as he luſt, and not by any reaſon or lawe.

               I am ioyfull thereof, for S. Paule ſayeth to the Coloſſians Coloſſ. 3. the third chapter. Ye maiſters do to your ſeruants that which is iuſt and equall, &amp; know that ye alſo haue a mayſter in heauen. Alſo the duty of a mayſter is that he muſt dilligētly prouyde that he gouern thē Godly, &amp; iuſtly: Godly ſhal he gouern thē, if while they bee in his ſeruice he excerciſe thē not only in ſeruil &amp; manual works: but alſo in deeds of godlynes, &amp; vertue, and to forſee yt no kind of ſin be vſed of his ſeruants in his houſe, neither ydlenes ſuffred, neither ſwering, picking, neyther ſtealing, neyther whoring, nor any fylthy cōmunication, but

that all Godlineſſe, honeſty and vertue be practyſed among them, when they come from the Church vpon the Saboth day or holiday, to examyne them what fruitefulneſſe the haue learned there, that by this meanes God maye the more aboundantly poure forth his bleſſing vpon him, and all his houſholde.
            
            
               Puer.
               Theſe are good exhortations which delighteth me verye well, I pray you as you haue begon, ſo reherſe more to me and you can.

               Yes I thanke God, I can, for the duety of a mayſter is, to dele What is the duety of the Mayſter iuſtly, truely, and faythfully with his ſeruants, he muſt take heede, that he do not onely require of them faythfull and dilligent ſeruice, due and true worke and labour, but that he alſo wythout fraud or deceyt, giue them their dutyes, and couenaunts, as meate, drinke, lodging, linnen, wollen, apparell, their occupation, and whatſoeuer is agreede vpon betwene them, that there be found no vnrighteous dealing in hym, but all iuſtice, all equitie and truth.
               Let him not euill intreate his ſeruaunt that worketh truely, but let him loue a diſcreete ſeruaunt Eccle. 7. Eccle. 33. as his owne ſoule, and defraude him not of his duty. If the mayſter intreate a good ſeruant euill, and keepe him harde, and make him to be prowd and to run away from him, he cannot tell what way to ſeeke him.
            
            
               Puer.
               It is moſt true, for as much as you tolde me that the duety of the mayſter is, to foreſee that neyther ydleneſſe

ſhould be ſuffred, you haue tolde me your mynde, for that I pray you in lyke manner, let me vnderſtande what is agaynſte ſwearing. What is agaynſt ſwering. lames. 5.

               Saynt Iames ſayeth, ſweare not, neyther by heauen nor by earth, neyther by anye other oth. But let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, leaſt you fall into ypocriſye. Thou ſhalte Exodus. not take the name of thy Lorde God in vayne, for the Lord will not holde him guiltleſſe that taketh his name in vayne. Wherfore I aduertiſe thee, let not thy mouth be vſed to ſwearing. Eccle. 23. The wyſe man ſayeth, whē that men here ſuch ſwearing, the heire of their heades ſhould ariſe Prou. 27. for feare, and they ſhould ſtop their eares, and not here ſuch vnreuerence, and deſpyſing of Gods name.
               Thou ſhalt not ſweare at all, neyther by Heauen, for it is Gods ſeate, nor yet by the earth, Math. 5. for it is his footeſtoole, neyther by Ieruſalem, for it is the Cittie of the great King, neyther ſhalte thou ſweare by thy heade, becauſe thou canſt not make one heare, whyte or blacke, Math. 23. who ſo ſweareth by the Aulter, ſweareth by the ſame, and by all that is thereon, and who ſo ſweareth by the Temple, ſweareth by the ſame, and by him that dwelleth therein, and who ſo ſweareth by heauen, ſweareth by the ſeate of God, and by him that ſitteth thereon.

               Ciuis.
               If they be called before a Iudge, for the iuſt tryall of matters in controuerſy, it is lawfull for them to ſwere, and then they muſt take Heb. 6. heede. For when God made promiſe to Abrahā becauſe he had none greater to ſweare by, hee ſware by himſelfe, and ſayd: ſurely I wil bleſſe thee, &amp; multiplie thee in deede. As for men, they ſwere by hym that is greater then their ſelues, and the oth is ye end of al ſtrife. Who ſo ſwereth by any creature, he ſweareth by him that made Auguſt. that creature.
            
            
               Puer.
               Then you alow to ſweare before a Iudge, to be agreable to the ſcripture. If they ſweare falſly, what is to be accounted vpon them?
            
            
               Ciuis.
               Thoſe that ſwere falſely do contrary to the ſcripture. For it is written, thou ſhalt beare no falſe witneſſe agaynſt thy neighbour. Falſe Exodus. witneſſe procureth mallice, thefte, manſianter, and other vyces to be hidden, it is the oryginall of vyce, for a Iudge ſitting in iudgemente, cannot indifferentlye miniſter iuſtice, becauſe that falſe witneſſes do blynd the truth often tymes. Ye ſhall not ſweare falſlye by my name, and ſo to vnhalow the name of thy God, Leuit. 19. for I am the Lord, ſayth God. Better is ye pore Prou. 19. man that liueth Godly, then the blaſphemer that is but a foole. The wyſeman ſayth, a falſe witneſſe ſhall not remayne vnpuniſhed. A falſe witneſſe laugheth iudgement

Who ſo beareth falſe witneſſe agaynſte his Prou. 25. neighbour, he is a very ſpeare and ſword, and a ſharpe arrow. Thou ſhalte not forſweare thy Math. 5. ſelf, but ſhalt performe thine oth to God, ſwere not at all, be no falſe accuſer. Let thy tongue Titu. 2.

The Egiptians law Egiptians lawe. was, that no ſwearing ſhoulde be vſed among them at all, except it were for a waighty cauſe, if anye were founde to be periured, the ſame ſhoulde looſe his heade. Doualdus King of Scots made this acte within his land, that al Doualdus. periurers and common ſwearers ſhould haue their lippes ſeared with a burning hote Iron.

               I remember I haue hearde ſay that King Henry the fyfte, made a ſtatute for ſwearers, in hys owne Pallace, that if he were a Duke that did Henry the fyfte. ſweare, he ſhould forfeite for euery tyme fortye ſhillings, to the ayding and helping of the pore: if he were a Lord or a Baron, twēty ſhillings: if he were a Knight or an Eſquyre, x. ſhillings: if he were a Yoman, twenty pence: if he were a Page or a Lackey, or a ſlaue, to be ſcourged naked, eyther with a rod, or elſe with a whip.

               If this law were in theſe dayes put in execution, there would not be ſo much ſwearing vſed as is, which for lack of the feare of GOD prouoketh many to offende, which God of his goodneſſe ingrafte into their ſtony hartes the increaſe of his loue, and that they may feare him with all vnfayned reuerence. I perceyue and doe gather of your good leſſons, that better it were that the bodyes of the blaſphemers in this world ſhould ſuffer a little payne, then after this lyfe to haue both their bodyes and ſoules caſt into Hell fyre.

               You ſay troth, if al fathers and mothers and mayſters would dilligently watch vppon their children, and ſeruants, it ſhall cauſe them not onely not to be defyled with the moſte greuous ſinne of ſwearing, but alſo that the moſt holy name of God ſhould be had in high reuerence,

great eſtimation, and perpetuall honour for euer after, ſo long as they liue. But aboue al thinges I woulde wiſhe the Parentes themſelues to be an enſample in this behalfe, vnto their children and ſeruauntes, and ſhew euermore ſuch reuerence vnto the name of GOD, that the yonglinges maye well perceyue that it is no vayne thing that they are taught. If they doe the contrary, that is to ſay, blaſpheme the holy name of God, then ſhall they vndoubtedly come vnto diſhonour, and a ſhamefull ende.
               In this world the plague and vengeance of God, ſhall not goe away from their houſes, they ſhall be ſtricken with many greuous diſeaſes in their bodyes, their goods and Cattell, yea and all that euer they haue, ſhall come to nought, their kynde of liuing ſhall be deſpyſed with all good men, their death ſhalbe paynful, miſerable and wretched, and after theſe ſo great and manifolde plagues, they may be ſure Eſay. 66.

More enſamples might be declared at large for thys matter, but you ſhall here further what S. Paule writeth to the Epheſians, the ſixt chapter, Ephe. 6. vnto mayſters.

Alſo you muſt be bound by a payre of Indentures, for ſo many yeares as your Mayſter and you can agree for, alwaies prouided whē you come out of your yeres, before you haue the liberties of London, you muſt be of the age of foure and twenty yeres, &amp; the ſame maiſter as I told you in the duty of mayſters, muſt teach you or cauſe you to be taught your occupation, &amp; he to find you meat, drink, linnen, wollen, hoſe, ſhoes and all other ſuch neceſſaries. And if you haue ſerued your mayſter truely, then he wil make you a freeman of London, wherby you may liue &amp; with the ayde of almighty God doe full well

as your mayſter before you hath done. You muſt be carefull and myndfull to carry awaye good exhortations when you heare them, and willing and dilligent to pleaſe your Mayſter and Miſtreſſe, in which doing, you ſhall fynde great commoditie and profyte.

               You cannot do ſo in London, I remember there was a ſtatute made in the ſixte yeare of the reigne of King Henrye the eyght, that al Vnlawfull games prohibited.

Idlenes without lerning is deth, &amp; the graue of a quick mā. The wiſe māſayth, I went by the field of the ſlothfull, &amp; by the vyneyard of the foliſh mā, Prou. 17. and loe, it was al couered with nettles, &amp; ſtood ful of thiſtles, and the ſtone wall was broken down.

               That is a very ſtreight ſaying: how can a man loue his chyld, when he chaſteneth him, and holdeth him euer in correction? I pray you what is ment by the ſame word correctiō?
            
            
               Ciuis.
               Correctiō is an amēdment of our former euil life, taming of our carnall wil, mortifying What is correction. of our fleſh, applying of our ſelues to the commaundement, will, &amp; example of Chriſt, to take away and baniſh the euil, to bring in and eſtabliſh the good, as Dauid ſayth: Eſchew euil Pſalm. 34. and do good, for euil works always taketh away the credite of good wordes. To take hede Prou. 10. vnto the chaſtning of nurtoure, is the waye of lyfe, but he that refuſeth to be reformed, goeth wrong. He that thinketh ſkorne to bee Prou. 13. reformed, commeth to pouertye and ſhame, but who ſo receyueth correctyon, ſhall come to honoure. A ſcornefull bodye loueth not one that rebuketh him, neyther will he come among Prou. 15. Prou. 23. the wyſe, withholde not correction from the chylde, for if thou beateſt him with the rod, he ſhall not die.
               The correction of the wiſe is an obediēt eare, a golden chayne, and a Iewell of golde. Prou. 25.

               This is a good correcting, euery mā to examin his owne conſcience, &amp; ſo to correct himſelf: but this is not the correction, that I meane.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               there is another kind of corectiō which is to be ioyned vnto ye ſayings of the wiſe mā, the rod &amp; correction miniſtreth wyſedome, but if a chyld

be not looked to, hee bringeth his mother to ſhame, therfore ſayeth he: Nurtour thy ſonne with correction, and he ſhall comforte thee, yea he ſhall doe thee good at thy harte. A ſeruaunt will not be the the better for words, for though he vnderſtand, yet wil he not regard them. He that delicately and familyerly bringeth vp his ſeruaunt, ſhall make him his mayſter at the length.
               He muſt not make him fellow with his mayſter, neyther at his table, nor yet in any other place, theſe wordes ſignify, as the old prouerb is of cōmon people vſed: a yōg bough wil bend while it is greene, but when it is old, it wil not moue, ſo is it to be accounted for youth, they muſt be looked vnto whyle they are yong, they muſt not be wantonly broughte vp, but with feare, they muſt be vſed at the fyrſt, as they ſhal continue, and for their faultes be corrected.

               I gather much of your talk, but though you ſpeake of children, is the meaning thereof by ſeruanntes lykewyſe?
            
            
               Ciuis.
               Yea all is one, for where there is a child or a ſonne named, or a ſeruaunt, all is as one thing: For where the wyſe man ſayeth. Chaſten Prou. 19. thy ſonne whyle there is hope, but let not thy ſoule be moued, to ſley him is not ment, but that hee ſhall geue him reaſonable correction, and not in anger, for correction is as neceſſary for youth, as meate, drinke, and apparrel.

               They are ſo, yet: He that byndeth a Auguſt. frantick man, and waketh him that hath the letargye, or ſleeping ſickneſſe, diſpleaſeth both, loueth both, &amp; healeth both: both whyles they be ſick do diſdain him, and whē they be whole, yet both doe thanke him.
               In correction wrath is ſpecially to be prohibited, Tully. for he that will puniſh when he is angry, ſhall neuer keepe well the meane, which is betweene to much and to little. It is better to be Eccleſ. of a wyſe man corrected, then to bee with the flattery of fooles deceyued.
               Be of thyne owne liuing a ſharpe correctour, Chriſoſt. Seneca. and of other mens a gentle reformer. Correcte thy friende ſecretlye, and praiſe thy friende openly.

               Let thy tongue be ignoraunt of lying, and Ephe. 4. Ierome. loue ſo well truth, that whatſoeuer that thou ſpeakeſt, think that thou ſweareſt. Lye not in earneſt nor in ieſt.

For Lyars not without cauſe, may be compared to mad dogges: for all thoſe that vſe it, hurte their conſcience, and loſe their credite, and bringeth them to confuſyon. A lyer is worſe then a theefe, for from a theefe a a man may hyde, and from a lyer he cannot. That which is bred in the bone, will not oute of the fleſh.
               Thoſe that for their pleaſure, were accuſtomed to lye in their youth, wil not faile, for their profyte, to lye in their age.

               So ſayd, and ſo done, is a thread well ſpone: for haue this regarde with your ſelfe, thou muſt commit thy workes vnto the Lord, Prou. 16. and loke what thou doeſt it ſhall proſper. If ye be louing and obedient, ſayth the Prophete, ye Eſay. 1. ſhall enioy the beſt thing that groweth in the Land, but if ye be obſtynate, and rebellyous, ye ſhall be deuoured with the ſword, for thus the Lorde hath promyſed with his owne mouth. When you are well placed with an honeſt mā, remember what S. Paule ſayeth to the Epheſyans.
               Seruauntes be obedyent vnto your carnall The obedience of ſeruauntes. Ephe. 6. Colo. 3. mayſters, with feare and trembling, in ſingleneſſe of your harts, as vnto Chriſt, and agayne in the thyrd chapter to the Coloſſians. Seruantes be obedyent vnto your bodily mayſters in all things, not with eye ſeruice, as men pleaſers, but in ſingleneſſe of harte. And what ſoeuer you doe, doe it hartily, as though you did it to the Lorde, and not to men, you ſhall receaue the reward of inheritaunce, for ye ſerue the Lord Chriſt.
               Here you may well perceaue and vnderſtande

what a comfortable and a precyous rewarde Gods ſeruauntes ſhall haue. S. Paule wryteth to Timothie in the ſyxte Chapter. Let 1. Tim. 6. as many Seruaunts as are vnder the yoake, count their mayſters worthye of all Honoure, that the name of God and his doctryne, be not euill ſpoken of, for the ſame bread you breake vnto others, ſhall be broken vnto you agayne.

For the Oxe and Goate is in awe of the Lyon, the Ramme and Ewe, of the Wolfe: the Cowe and the Lambe, feare the Beare: the Goate, the Libbarde: the Hawke is afrayde of the Eagle: the Doue, of the Hawke: waye the maner of Beaſtes and Byrdes, amongſt their owne kynde, you ſee euer the bigger and ſtrō

               Thē by your ſayings there is as I conceaue, two kynde of theftes, the one is to ſteale from another man, and the other is to deceaue his Neighboure by falſe weyghtes, and vniuſt meaſures.

               It is ſo. For a falſe Balaunce is an abhomynation Falſe weights abhominable. Prou. 11. vnto the Lord, but a true weight pleaſeth him. A true meaſure and a true Ballaunce are the Lords, he maketh all weyghts. Treaſures that are wickedlye gotten, profyte Prou. 16. Prou. 10. Prou. 20. nothing, but righteouſneſſe deliuereth from death. To vſe two maner of weights, or two maner of meſures, both theſe are abhominable vnto the Lorde. The Lorde abhorreth two manner of weightes, and a falſe ballaunce is Leuit. 19. an euill thing, ye ſhall do no vnrighteouſneſſe in iudgemēt, in metyard, in weight, or in meaſure. True balaunces, true weights, a true Epha, &amp; a true Hin ſhall ye haue, I am the Lord your God. And agayne. Thou ſhalte not haue Deut. 25. in thy bagge two maner of weights, a great &amp; a ſmall, neyther ſhalte thou haue in thy houſe dyuers meaſures, a great and a ſmall.

               Theſe thinges I muſt needes looke vnto, for loath I am, that it ſhould happen ſo to me, I thanke God, there was none of my kindred that euer I did know, was found guylty concerning ſuch cryme.

               I told you at your fyrſt meeting, of obedience, and it is a thing very neceſſary to be remēbred, you muſt pleaſe your mayſter, &amp; miſtreſſe, as S.

For Chriſt alſo ſuffred for vs, leuing vs an example yt we ſhould folow his ſteps, which did no ſin, neyther was there deceit found in his mouth, which whē he was

reuyled, reuyled not agayne, when he ſuffered, he threatued not, but cōmitted the cauſe to him thatiudgeth righeouſly.

               Your duety is, to be ſwifte to heare, ſloe Iames. 2. to ſpeake, and ſlow to wrath. For the wrath of man, worketh not that which is righteous before God, therefore you muſt not geue worde for word, or taunt for taunt, nor to pleade with him as it were a counſeler ſhould pleade a caſe at the Barre before a Iudge. For I tolde you before, you muſt not be ſtowt and ſtubborn, but lowly and obediente, which thinges by your talke, you haue already forgotten, and yet you ſayde Obliuyon ſhould not enter ſo ſoone into you, you haue two eares, the one to heare, the other to carrye away the ſence and true meaning of ſuch thinges as are taught you.

               Do you not beleeue me? and can you not awaye with that I haue tolde you? by ſcripture I coulde recyte more to you, and one thing more I will ſhewe you.
               It is written in the. xxi. Chapter of Deutrinomium, Deut. 21. wherein is ſhewed and declared the greate daunger and perrill of thoſe which are diſobedient children, which ſay as you ſay, and will refuſe correction and good gouernmente. That is, if any man hath a ſonne or a ſeruaunt, that is ſtubborne and diſobedient, and wil not hearken vnto the voyce of his father and mother, and they haue taughte him nurtoure, but he will not hearken vnto them, this worde father and mother, is taken here for Mayſter and miſtreſſe, it followeth what ſhall be done vnto him.
               Then let his father and mother take him, and bring him out vnto the Elders of the Citty and ſaye.
               This our ſonne is ſtubbern and diſobedient,

and will not hearken vnto our voyce, he is a ryoter and a dronkarde, then let all the men of that Cittie ſtone him with ſtones vnto death, and thou ſhalte put euill from thee, and all Iſraell ſhall heare and feare: If ſuche correction ſhould be vſed in theſe dayes, what would ſeruauntes and children doe. God forbid it ſhould, but yet it is not hurtfull for mee, to exhorte and perſwade you by ſcripture, to bring you out of darkeneſſe into light, which light ſhall be your comforte, and I tolde you before of two corrections.

               If you forgiue men their faults, your Luke. 6. heauenly father will alſo forgiue you. Yet I confeſſe a ſeruaunt may offend, if he do, I pray you tell me whether it is lawfull for a mayſter to geue his ſeruaunt vnlawfull correction?

               Due correctiō is alowable for ſeruants, if a mayſter ſhall take an vnreaſonable thing to correct his ſeruaunt, whereby he putteth out one of his eyes, breake his arme or legge, or his head, it is not lawfull, for he muſt conſyder with himſelfe, that his ſeruaunt is of the ſame mould made, that himſelfe is, and that God

will requyte euill for euill, an eye, for an eye. &amp;c. The Prophet ſayth.

But if he he are thee not, then take with thee one or two, but I thanke God you haue ſo vſed me, that it ſhall not be ſhewed to any.

               Remember what is written in the ſame place.
               Better it is for thee to enter into life with one eye, then to haue two eyes and be caſt into hell fyre. So likewiſe, better it were for thee to ſuffer wrong and iuiury then to reuenge agayne. Recompence to no man euill for euill. Let euery ſoule be flowe vnto anger. Loue your enemyes, Roma. 12. Iames. 1. Luke. 6. doe good vnto them that hate you, bleſſe them that curſe you, pray for them that wrong and trouble you. And who ſo ſmyteth thee on the one cheeke, offer him the other. And who taketh thy cloake, forbid him not thy coat, and whoſo taketh that is thyne, aſke it not agayne, and as yee woulde that men ſhoulde doe vnto you, euen ſo doe ye vnto them.
               Lykewyſe, and if you loue them that loue you what thanke haue you therefore. But rather loue thoſe whome you thinke to be your enemies, iudge not, and ye ſhal not be iudged. Forgiue, and ye ſhall be forgeuen.
               Thus now you heare what benefyte and commoditie commeth, and what a fountayne or Wellſpring of lyfe is ſhewed vnto you, concerning ſufferaunce.
               A good name is more worth then a precious oyntment, and the day of death, is better then Eccle. 7. the day of byrth.

Let loue be without diſſimulacion. Be kynde one to another, with brotherly loue. In geuing honour goe one before another. Loue 1. Peter. 2. brotherly fellowſhip. Be not weary in well doing. Let not the Sunne goe downe vpon your 2. The. 4. wrath.

               That is, if my neighbour ſhoulde deſyre my Cloake, ſhall I giue my Coate to him alſo? peraduenture I ſhall go naked my ſelfe, the fraylty of the fleſhe, will not be ſo aunſwered, for ſure I beleeue, though it be ſo written in ſcripture, there is another meaning therein, which if it were declared, eſpecially vnto thoſe that are the couetous perſons of this worlde, I thinke it woulde touch them ſomewhat, for the moſte parte of them, are all gathering and ſeeking to inrich themſelues, and nothing will part from yet they haue a good example of the rich man Diues, &amp; the pore begger Lazarus. Luke. 16.
               
            
            
               Ciuis
               That is wel remembred of you, they haue the more to aunſwere, thoſe which are in this world in ſubſtaunce &amp; lyuing, haue a great accoumpt to make at the latter day, and the pore man that hath his helth, &amp; followeth his labour Eccle. 5. and getteth his liuing with the ſweate of hys

browes, is better at his hartes caſe, then they which hath golde and treaſure, mixed with ſickneſſe and diſeaſes. Albeit, I pray God that thou, when thou commeſt to be a man able to What is agaynſt couetouſneſſe. kepe a houſe of thine own, yt couetouſneſſe doth not enter into thy breſt, as it doth into many in theſe dayes.
            
            
               Puer.
               I thanke you for your good wiſhing towards me for the auoyding therof, let me heare ſome of your mynd.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               God cō
                  mandeth Exod. 20. yt thouſhalt not couet thy neighbours goods. For couetouſneſſe is the roote of al euil. 1. Tim. 6. Pſal. 119. Prou. 11. Dauid ſayd: Inclyne my hart (O Lord) to thy teſtimonies, &amp; not to couetouſnes. He that hordeth vp his corn ſhalbe curſed among ye people, but bleſſing ſhal light vpō his head that giueth foode. He that truſteth in his riches, is lyke to a broken ſtaffe, for he ſhall haue a fall, but the righteous ſhall flouriſhe as the greene leafe.
               Better it is to haue a little with the feare of Prou. 15. God, then great and vnmeaſurable-treaſures otherwyſe. Better it is to haue a little thing Prou. 16. with righteouſneſſe, then great rentes wrongfully gotten. He that hateth couetouſneſſe, ſhal Prou. 18. Eccle. 11. Eccle. 14. lyue long. Nothing is more wicked and vngracious then a couetous Man. A couetous mans eye hath neuer ynough.
               He that loueth riches ſhall not bee iuſtifyed. Eccle. 31. Hebr. 13. Lette your conuerſation be without couetouſneſſe, &amp; be content with that you haue already. The Apoſtle exhorteth vs yt couetouſnes ſhold Colo. 3.
                  
not be once named among you, for God verily hath ſayd, I will not fayle thee, nor yet forſake Examples agaynſt couetouſneſſe. Luke. 16. Act. 5. Ioſu. 7. thee. Iudas for lucre of money ſolde &amp; betrayd his mayſter Chriſt.
               Ananyas and Saphyra were puniſhed with ſoden death, becauſe of a couetous mynde. Acham by the commandement of God was ſtoned to death, becauſe he toke of the excomunicate goods.
               Couetouſneſſe cauſed Herod to ſeeke to perſecute Chriſt in his ſwadling cloutes, I haue harde ſay, that Syr Thomas Moore, which knewe the truth to forſake it agayne, and to conſpyre with a Cardinall in Englād, to blynd and deceiue the King of England, and to bring him out of the light into darkeneſſe. Saule for the couetouſneſſe of praiſe, loſt his Kingdome. 1. Reg. 13. 1. Reg. 35. The couetouſneſſe of Achab and Ieſabel was the occaſyon that Naboth was ſtoned vnto death.
               Take heede ſayeth the Euaungeliſt, and beware Luk. 6. of couetouſneſſe, for no mans lyfe ſtandeth in the aboundaunce of thinges, which he poſſeſſeth.
               The Prophet ſayeth: wo be vnto them that Eſay. 5. giue ſentence with the vngodly for rewardes, and condemne the iuſt cauſe of the righteous. They haue excercyſed their harts in couetouſneſſe. 2. Peter. 2.
               
               Bleſſed is the rich, which is found withoute Eccle. 31.
                  
blemiſh, and hath not gone after Gold, nor hoped in money and treaſures, where is there ſuch a one, and we will commende him, and call him bleſſed, for great thinges doth he among the people.
               For riches is the guift of God geuen to man, to mayntayne the degrees of this worlde, and therefore not euill, yea and ſome muſt be poore and ſome rich, God our father hath deuided riches and pouertye among his children, according to his Godly will, pleaſure and wiſdome. And as riches doth not exclude thee from the bleſſing, ſo doth not pouertye certifye thee, but to put thy truſt in the liuing God. For if thou truſt in the liuing God, then if thou be poore, thou coueteſt not to be riche, for thou arte certifyed with that which GOD hath prouyded for thee.
            
            
               Puer.
               I thanke you hartily, I maye lyken you vnto a Mercers ſhop, for I can no ſooner aſke you a queſtion, but you reſolue it vnto mee immediately, if men in theſe dayes would marke the true ſayings of the ſcripture, things might be amended, it is pitty that a man will not examin his conſcience, conſidering that he is but a flower in this world, but what remedy, I doubt not if it be not amended, God will ſeeke reuengement thereof, when he ſeeth good.

               For of the aboundaunce of the hart, the Luke. 7. mouth ſpeaketh, ſo doth all men, for what they

ſay with their mouthes, the hart thinketh the ſame, yet the talke that I haue had with you, moueth mee to ſay vnto you, as Chriſt ſayd to his Diſciples.
               Bleſſed are the eyes which ſee that you ſee, Luke. 10. for I ſay vnto you, glad I am, not only of your company, but that I perceaue you reape and gather good ſeede at my handes, and let Cocle alone.
            
            
               Puer.
               Duety byndeth me there vnto, otherwyſe, although I am tender of yeares, what mighte you thinke of me, if you ſhoulde ſpend all this talke on me, in vayne. For I gather that it were better to haue friendly vſage of the ſcriptures, then to excercyſe that whiche ſhoulde neyther be profytable for vs, ne yet to the hearers commendable. For in the tenth of Luke and other places, it is written. Aſke and it ſhalbe geuen you: ſeke, &amp; you ſhal find, knock &amp; it ſhall be opened vnto you, for who ſo aſketh receaueth, &amp; he that ſeketh fyndeth, and to him that knocketh, ſhall it be opened, by theſe comfortable words, which I haue receiued of you, I truſt ſhall make me as freſh as the Olyue, or Hauthorne, for theſe your ſweete flowers that you haue geuen vnto me, grow in the Garden of lyfe, and hath brought me out of the puddle, which peraduenture I ſhould haue lyne wallowing in. Yet I am carefull to thinke how I ſhould, behaue my ſelfe at London.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               Thou arte much to blame. Chriſt ſayd vnto his Diſciples.

Take ye no thought for your lyfe, what Luke. 13. ye ſhall eate, neyther for your body, what you ſhal put on, the lyfe is more then meate, and the body more then rayment, conſyder the Rauens and the little ſmall Byrdes, they neyther ſowe nor reape, they haue alſo neyther ſtorehouſe nor Barn, and yet God feedeth them, but how much better are ye then the fowles, wherfore Luke. 13. be of good comforte, and aſk not what you ſhal eate, nor what you ſhall drinke, and clyme not vp ſo hye, as the Prouerbe is, leaſt a chip fall into your eye, but ſeeke the Kingdome of God, and all theſe ſhall be mynyſtred to you, wee draw now a pace towards London.
            
            
               Puer.
               I pray▪ you how far is it thyther, me thinkes the iorney very long, and yet comfortable, bycauſe of your aduertiſement.

               It is not aboue one Myle, or thereaboutes.
            
            
               Puer.
               I am glad thereof, for I promyſe you Syr, I am almoſte weary. I haue come a great waye, yet GOD bee wyth my good olde Mother, and all my Friendes, I am ſure they woulde be gladde to heare of my well doing.

               She may very well heare therof, I doubte it not, and ſhee ſhall haue great ioye of you.
            
            
               Puer.
               I truſt ſo, yet in al my troubles, &amp; temptations, whatſoeuer ſhal happen, Lord graunt

me that I may remember your ſaying, &amp; that I may ſay as the wyddow ſayd, vnto the vnrightfull Iudge.
               Deliuer me from myne Aduerſarye, for I Luke. 18. knowe the Aduerſarye the Deuill, will ſeeke all the wayes he can to get mee into his Net. But ſtill my fortitude and ſtrength ſhall bee in God.
               My mouth ſhal ſpeake the praiſe of the Lord, Pſal. 145. and let al fleſh giue thanks vnto his holy name for euer and euer.
               For he ſayeth, and commandeth me, to take Luke. 21. heede that I be not deceiued, and againe, hee ſayeth: When I here of warres and inſurrections, he commaundeth me not to be afrayde, for ſuch thinges muſt come to paſſe, whyche God of his infynite mercy graunte mee grace that hereafter, I may remember, &amp; ſay. Delyuer me, O Lord, from myne enimies, for I flye Pſal. 143. vnto thee to hyde me, &amp; ſtretch forth my hands to thee.
               And now Lord what is my hope, truely my Pſal. 39. hope is euen in thee, deliuer me from all myne offences, and make me not a rebuke vnto the fleſh. Here my prayer, O Lord, and with thyne eares conſyder my calling, holde not thy peace at my teares.
               For inumerable troubles are come about me. Pſal 40. Pſal. 43. O deliuer mee from the deceitfull and wicked man, for thou arte the God of my ſtrength, and

thou arte able to wreſt and confound myne enemyes, they lye lurking abroade on euery ſide as the Fox doth for his praye, they lay baytes for me, as the Fyſher doth for the ſmall fyſhes. Saue me O Lorde, and delyuer me, for thy names ſake.
            
            
               Ciuis.
               Theſe are very good ſayinges. For S. Iohn. 3. Iohn ſayeth: He that commeth from an high, is aboue all, and he can delyuer you from all troubles and temptations of the world. In the Reuelation lykewyſe it is written. As many Iohn. 4. Hebr. 12. as I loue, I rebuke, and chaſten, be feruente therefore and repent, and beare this well in mynde.
            
            
               Puer.
               It is my deſyre. But I pray you Syr, what great town is that ſame before vs?

               That is London.

               I will do my good will, but now you are in London, where will you become this night? haue you no frindes nor Kinſfolks here in London?
            
            
               Puer.

               If it pleaſe you to ſhowe me the houſe,

               Take heede to thy ſelfe now, and keepe wel thy ſoule that thou forget not the thinges which thyne eyes haue ſeene, and that they departe not out of thy harte, all the dayes of thy lyfe.

            ¶ A generall prayer for all men, to walke in their vocation and calling.
            
            
               FOr as much, O heauenly Father, as both thy honor, and diſhouour, after a certayne manner, dependeth in this world, eyther of our Godlye or wicked lyfe, if we lyue well, thy very aduerſaryes ſhall be compelled to glorifye thee, but if our lyfe be vngodlye, ſo ſhalte thou be diſhonoured among the wicked and euill ſpoken of, through our ſynfull lyuing, and becauſe we ſhould not walke inordinately and ſo prouoke the enimies of thy truth to raile on thee, and to blaſpheme thy holy name, thou haſt apoynted in thy bleſſed law, certain honeſt and godly ſtates and degrees, wherin thy people ſhould lyue, and haſt ſtraightlye commaunded, that ſo many as profeſſe thee &amp; thy holye word, ſhould contynue in the ſame, and euerye one according to his vocation and calling, and by no meanes leade a diſſolute lyfe, after the maner of the Heathen, which know not God, that by well doing, the profeſſoures of thy holy religion, may not only ſtop the mouthes of fooliſh and ignorant people, but alſo prouoke them to glorifye thee our Lord in the daye of vyſytacion. We knowing our infyrmitie and weakeneſſe, which is great, and vnable to be redeemed

of our natural ſtrength, and free wil, that we are not able to think a good thought, much leſſe for to fulfyll thy commandements, which thou haſte ſtrayghtly commaunded to be kept, and wiſhing the glorye of thy moſte glorious name, and the accompliſhment of thy heauenly will: Moſt humbly, and from the very hart, beſeech thee therefore, for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, for to indue vs with thy holy ſpirit, which may fulfill that lacketh in vs, make vs newe Creatures, trade vs in the path of thy holy law, and geue vs grace to walke according to our vocation, in feare, and in obedience of thy good wil, that we admit nothing that in any poynt may hinder thy glory, and thy honour, deface thy name, and cauſe thee to be euill ſpoken of among the vngodly, and that this may come to paſſe, graunt O moſt mercifull Father, that euery one of vs, from the higheſt to the loweſt, may vnfaynedly aunſwere to our calling, and frame our lyues according to thy bleſſed will, vnto the glory of thy name, that whatſoeuer we doe in worde or deede, we may do al things in the name of the Lord Ieſu, geuing thanks to thee, God the Father, through him. Graunt that all temporall Rulers may vſe their office iuſtly and godly, ſeeke not onely to be feared, but alſo to be beloued, to mayntayne the good, and to puniſh the euil, accept no perſon in iudgment, alone no falſe accuſation, ſhed no innocent

bloud. Here the ſmall as wel as the great, receyue no brybes, ſet forth thy glory, aduaunce thy holy worde, promote thy faythfull preachers in all their doinges, ſeeke the profyte of the common weale, and ſo behaue themſelues, they may be foūd worthy officers in thy ſight: Graunt that the ſubiects may ſhewe all reuerent ſubmiſſyon to their Rulers, obay them in all thinges, be faythfull and true to them, yea, that not only for feare of puniſhmente, but alſo for conſcience ſake.
            Graunt that the Biſhops, &amp; Preachers of thy worde, and all other ſpirituall Miniſters may take hede to thēſelues, &amp; to all the flock in that which the holy Ghoſt hath appoynted them ouerſeers, to feede the holy congregation, which thy dearely beloued ſonne purchaſed with hys precious blood, &amp; take the ouerſyght of thē, not as though they were compelled, but willingly, not for the deſyre of fylthy lucre, but of a good mynde, not as Lords ouer their pariſhioners, but that they be an enſample vnto the Flocke: Graunt they may lay aſyde all Tyranny, and hautyneſſe of mynd, and walke with all gentleneſſe, and tender compaſſyon towards the ſheepe of Chriſt, committed to their cure and charge, let them be as moſt louing Fathers to Chriſtes flock, &amp; if any of the ſheepe chaunce to runne aſtray, and go out of the way, let them not therefore be vngentlye intreated, but as it is

the offyce of a good Sheaphearde, by fayre meanes, call them home agayn vnto the ſhepefolde, ſeeking rather their ſaluation, then their deſtruction, let them remember the Hyſtory of the loſte Sheepe, and conſyder how tenderly the head Sheaphearde Chriſt thy ſonne and our Lord, fetch it home agayne, euen vpon his ſhoulders, for the ſeruant of the Lord may not fight, but peaceably and gently towardes all men; ready to teach, ſuffering the euill with meekeneſſe, informing men that reſyſteth. If at any time thou (O God) mayſt giue them repentaunce to know the truth, let them caſte away vngodlyneſſe and old wyues fables, reaching them thy heauenly worde, purely and truelye, and be vnto them that beleeue an example in the word, in conuerſation, in loue, in ſpright, in fayth, in pureneſſe.
            Let them giue attendaunce vnto reading, to exhortacion, to doctryne. Let them ſtudye to ſhewe themſelues in thy ſight, lyke workemen worthy of prayſe, euen ſuche as neede not bee aſhamed, as in Preaching thy holye worde, and ſo lykewyſe in mayntayning: diſtributing to the poore, in feding the hungry with meate, in cloathing the naked, in lodging of the harborleſſe, in nouriſhing Godlye and learned men, that they may be paſtors, and feeders both in word &amp; indeed, grant againe that

the Pariſhioners may reuerence the Biſhoppe and other ſpiritual miniſters, giuing them no leſſe honour, then the chyld giueth to the Father, remember that they be Aungels of God: the Meſſengers of Chriſte: the lighte of the world: the ſalte of the earth: the diſpenſers of the miſteries of God: the feders of their ſoules: the comforters of the weake: the Phiſitions of the ſicke: the vpholders of the whole: the exhorters vnto vertue: the frayers away from vyce: which watch contynuallye for the health of their ſoules, worke in the harts of al them that be inſtructed with thy worde, ſuch a tender loue and good will towardes the Miniſters that teach them, that the may giue vnto them aboundauntly all good thinges, whereby the Preachers may be the more able not onelye to nourriſh their family, but alſo maintayne Hoſpitality, for the releefe and comfort of the pore. For who goeth a warfare at any tyme at his owne coſte? who planteth a vineyarde and eateth not of the fruite? who feedeth a flocke, and eateth not of the mylke? if the Preachers ſow vnto their pariſhioners, ſpirituall thinges, it is a great thing, if they repe their eternal things. O Lord that they which preache thy Goſpell, ſhould lyue of the Goſpell: moreouer, graunt that the huſbands loue their wyues, as their owne bodyes, and not to be bitter, churliſh, or vnkynde vnto them, but geue honoure to them

as to the weaker veſſell, which are fellowe heyres vnto them of lyfe: Lykewyſe, graunt that the wyues be in ſubiection to their owne huſbandes as vnto the Lorde, in all thinges, and ſo behaue themſelues as becommeth women, of an honeſt lyfe, and a godly conuerſation.
