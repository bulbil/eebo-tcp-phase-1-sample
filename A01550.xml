            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

This consideration may well be a strong engagement to godlinesse, where but either parent onely hath beene religious. For if 1 Cor. 7. 14. either partie beleeuing,

though the other be an infidell, be of force sufficient to bring the Children bred betweene them within compasse of Gods Couenant: surely the godlinesse of either, though the other were prophane, must needs be no small tiall to oblige their issue the more straitly to that course, which they stood bound to haue taken, though their parents had beene both of them vtterly irreligious. But in this kinde hath God to you beene more abundantly gratious, in blessing and honouring you on both sides with two such worthie Parents, whose memorie as it is and will euer be deseruedly honoured with all those that here knew them; so it is iustly expected that it be reviued in you especially, and the residue of their issue, as

For, to omit that God hath furnished you with some abilities of learning that he had not, that he hath called you sooner and entred you earlier, you haue the more day before you: Your worthy Father hath broken the ice to you, he hath laid you to your hand a good foundation of religious courses in that Familie that you are to be Head vnto hereafter; he hath setled neere you and obliged vnto you M• T.

gratious goodnesse you haue already made entrance into. Sir, you see what a taske is exacted of you, what a necessitie of well-doing and of proceeding in good courses is euery way imposed vpon you. Let all laid together preuaile with you to make you as the more carefull to affect and embrace all good meanes of helpe and furtherance therein; so the more forward and diligent from time to time instantly and incessantly to craue further grace at his hands, by whose strength we all stand; who as he hath begun this his gratious worke in you, so is alone able to finish it (and I doubt not but he will so doe) to his owne glory in you, and your eternall glory with him. And to this purpose may this loose discourse afford you any the least helpe, I shall esteeme it a sufficient recompence of my labour in the publishing of it, what euer the issue be otherwise: If any other beside shall reape benefit thereby, I desire but that God may haue the praise of it, and my selfe onely their prayers. Howsoeuer it proue, it shall remaine a testimonie of the sincere loue and respect that he beareth and oweth to you and the house you come of, who both is and shall by Gods grace alwayes continue

               Watching therefore and waking are two seuerall things: it is one thing to wake, or to be awake, and another thing to watch. For example: we are all here (I presume) at this present waking; but cannot properly be said to be watching, because neither is it now the ordinarie time of rest, neither (it may be) haue we any present inclination thereunto.

But the Disciples of our Sauiour the night before he suffered, are said to haue watched with him, Matth. 26. 40. 
               Could ye not watch an houre with me? because both it was then the ordinarie time of repose, and they very sleepie and drowsie also themselues.
            Againe, Psal. 77. 3. the Psalmist complaineth that God held his eyes waking, or

               watching; (but in an vnproper sense) that he was forced to keepe waking, and so in some sort to watch as it were against his will. A man lieth oft awake when he would faine sleepe, but

                cannot, either through disease of bodie or distraction of minde: And a man that is set to watch, may keepe awake, but not minde or regard his charge: and neither of them in such case are said properly to watch. But those that sit by such a sicke man as cannot sleepe, to tend him, are said to watch by him: And the Shepherds are said to haue beene Luk. 2. 8.

            So that bodily watching (to speake properly and precisely) is then, when a man striueth to keepe himselfe corporally waking for the tending or heeding of something, at such time as he is or may be inclining to sleepe.

               Acts 12. 6. 
               Peter watched thus while he slept in the prison between two souldiers tied fast with two chaines. And so did Psal. 3. 5. &amp; 4. 8. 
               Dauid, when trusting to Gods gratious protection,

he laid himselfe quietly downe to sleepe. Whereas on the other side, Matth. 26 47.

Aug. in Psal. 125. theeues and murtherers also doe many times) to put his treason in practise, Matth. 26. 40. while his fellow Disciples slept; and yet watched he no more, nay not so much as they did. And 2 Sam. 11. 2, 3, 4. 
               Dauid was broad awake, when he spied Bathsheba from off his terrace; and yet watched he not so well as before he did, when on his pallet he lay fast asleepe: he rose from one sleepe, to fall into another, a worse sleepe. It is not

            §. 4. Now the Reasons of this point may bePart 2. foure:The Proofe.
            
            
               The first taken from the drowsinesse of our owne naturall disposition.
               The second from the diligence of our Aduersarie the Deuill.
               The third from the necessitie of perseuerance.
               The fourth and last from the danger of relapse.
            
            For the first of them, to wit, the drowsinesse ofReason 1. our owne naturall disposition. Matth. 26. 43. 
               He came the second time, saith the Euangelist of our Sauiours Disciples, whom he had but lately before awaked, and found them asleepe againe; for their eye were heauy. And as it is with those that be of an heauie constitution,

of a drowsie disposition, that though they be awaked out of sleepe, yet vnlesse they vse some diligence (yea though they so doe) to keepe themselues awake, they are ready euer anon to be napping and nodding, and (if they be not the more carefull) to fall euen fast asleepe againe: So it is naturally with euery one of vs in regard of our soules: We are all generally Languido sumus ingenio, &amp; in somnum ituro, aut in vigiliam somno simillimam: vt Senec. de prouid. c. 5. of a very dull and drowsie disposition, by reason of that lumpish flesh of ours, Rom. 7. 17, 23. that abideth much euen in the best of vs. By meanes whereof it commeth to passe, that we are oft slipping and slumbring, be we neuer so carefull and diligent; yea in danger oft, after we haue beene awaked out of this dreery and deadly sleepe, to fall eftsoone backe againe into the same, if we keepe not a constant watch ouer our selues and our soules. Beside that the Deuill is ready and busie euer to helpe forward, besprinkling of our tempels with his spirituall Opium of euill motions and suggestions, to further the matter, and to cast vs againe (if it be possible) into a Lethargie irrecouerable.

In this latter manner are we said to watch ouer you; and the maine end of our watching is to keepe you waking.

            The Pastor then indeed must watch ouer his people: but Ierem. 6. 17. the people must watch also with their Pastor, and must be kept waking by his watching. Yea as Act. 20. 28. 1 Tim. 4. 13, 15, 16 he must watch ouer both himselfe and them; so Matth. 7. 15. &amp; 16. 6. &amp; 24 4. 2 Ioan. 8. must they in person also watch each one ouer himselfe. To which purpose, if we should demand of our Sauiour, as Peter did sometime in the very same case, and vpon the like occasion; Luke 12. 41. 
               Master, speakest thou this vnto vs alone, or vnto all? Doest thou speake this to thine Apostles onely, or to Pastors alone, that are to watch ouer others, or to the people also, to thy Disciples all in generall? our Sauiour

would no doubt answer, yea so expresly he doth answer, Mark. 13. 37. Quod vni dictum est, quisque sibi dictum putet. Ausen. in ludo 7. Sapient. in Solone. 
               What I say vnto you, I say vnto all, Watch. Others may watch ouer vs; but none can watch for vs: each one in person must euer watch for himself.

            And no maruell then if they seldome awake or recouer, whom God, and the Deuill, and their owne corrupt heart, God in iustice, the Deuill in malice, and their owne corrupt heart out of its owne drowsie disposition, shall all conspire as it were together to with-hold from waking, and from returning to their wonted watch.

So that whether wee regard the drowsinesse of our owne naturall disposition; or the diligence of our Aduersary euer watching against vs; or the necessity of perseuerance, and holding out to the end; or the dreadfull danger of relapse, if wee fall from our former forwardnesse, and either intermit or giue ouer our watch, and our standing vpon our Guard: wee cannot but see the truth of the point formerly propounded, to wit, that it is not sufficient for vs that wee haue beene awaked out of this spirituall sleepe of sinne, but there is further need of perpetuall care to bee had for the keeping of vs from falling backe into that deadly slumber againe.

Now what may be the Vse of all this, butThe Use. to exhort and excite vs to the diligent practise and performance of a duty so necessarie, that so neerely concerneth vs, and that is so oft and so earnestly exacted of vs and pressed vpon vs, both by Matth. 24. 42. &amp; 25. 13. &amp; 26. 41.

            For the former, to wit, the Manner how thisPart 3. The manner. spirituall watch is to be held, wee will pitch vpon foure points, wherein the same doth principally consist:
            
               The 1. is a due Examination of our seuerall actions;
               
                  The 2. a diligent obseruation of our speciall corruptions;
               The 3. a carefull auoidance of the occasions of euill;
               The 4. a constant resistance of temptations vnto euill;

A wise and wary Chapman that hath to doe with a deceitfull Merchant, Draper, or other, one that keepeth his wares in obscure places where the defects of them cannot so easily be discerned, or hath false lights that may helpe to giue a counterfeit glosse to them, he will take no ware of him vpon his word, but hee will first diligently view it, tosse it and turne it to and fro ouer and ouer, try how it is in the middest as well as at both ends, bring it forth into the light, hold vp his cloth against the sunne, see if he can espie any defect or default in it; hee knoweth well hee may easily else bee ouer-reached. The like should bee our practise, because our case is alike.

               like a deceitfull Draper (saith one,) to draw men on vnto sinne, sheweth them the present pleasure or profit of sinne as the one end of the cloth, but concealeth and keepeth out of sight the middle and the other end of it in the internall remorse here, and the eternall punishment hereafter. Then there is the world, which our selues are wont to say is wholly set vpon deceit, and the Spirit of God saith 1 Iohn 5. 19.

            §. 19. This was Dauids course: Psalm. 119. 24. 
               Thy testimonies (saith he) are my comfort and my counsell. Dauid was a very wise Prince himselfe, 2 Sam. 14. 20. 
               prudent like an Angell of God, as the woman sometime told him. And he had besides a learned Councell about him; Achitophel among the rest, 2 Sam. 16. 23. 
               One whose words went in those dayes for Oracles. But yet had Dauid a Counsellor beyond and aboue all these, to wit, the voice of God himselfe in his word: This had a negatiue voice in all Dauids consultations; so that though the matter propounded seemed good in his owne

eyes, yea and had the approbation of his learned Councell withall, yet if this his head Counsellor went not with it, it was not for Dauid to deale with. And this Counsellor so long as Dauid hearkned vnto (for sometime to his owne woe he ouer-shot himselfe by neglecting it; but for the most part he did so) so long he did well, and thriued and found comfort, and had prosperous successe in whatsoeuer he went about. And the like must we doe, if we desire to fare as he did; make Gods word our Counsellour, if we would haue it our comforter: doe as worldly-wise and warie men are wont to doe; they will doe nothing without counsell; If they dwell neere to a Lawyer, whom they may freely repaire and haue accesse to vpon euery occasion, and of whom they may haue counsell, and cost them nothing, as oft as they will, they will be sure to doe nothing of moment, where the least matter of doubt or suspition of danger may be, without his aduice. And such a Counsellor haue we Deut. 30. 12, 13, 14. Rom. 10. 8. euer at hand with vs, ready on all occasions to aduise vs, neuer weary of conferring with vs, Esai. 30. 1. &amp; 31. 1. Prou. 1. 25.

            §. 20. Yet is this that that most men can be hardly drawne to condescend vnto, to take aduice of Gods word, that is so willing to aduise

them. There is none but would haue comfort from it: and there is none almost willing to take counsell of it. We like all well to haue a Comforter of it; but we haue no lust to make a Counsellor of it. But as Dauid, and Gods Spirit by Dauid ioyneth these two together: so Matth. 19. 6. we must not disioyne or seuer them the one from the other; or if we doe, we shall but delude our selues with vaine hopes. For he that taketh not counsell of Gods word, shall neuer receiue comfort from Gods word. He that maketh it not a Counsellor, shall neuer finde it a Comforter.
            The neglect of this hath beene the cause that many, wise otherwise and religious, haue oft shamefully ouer-shot themselues, because (with Iosh. 9. 16. 
               Ioshua and the Israelites in their agreements with the Gibeonites) they haue not beene carefull to consult with the voice of God in his word. In which kinde commeth iustly to be censured the vnaduised cariage of those that practise first and aduise afterward: runne on head into ambiguous actions, and then after fall to examining whether they haue done well, and as they ought in them, or no.

They come to him very demurely, and make deepe protestations, calling God solemnly to witnesse of the truth of their intention, of their willing minde and full purpose to put in execution and practise whatsoeuer God by the Prophet should aduise them vnto, were it good or bad. But (as Ierem. 42. 20. 
               Ieremie after truly told them) they dissembled but with him. For they were resolued before what course they would take; and came onely to make triall whether the Prophet would concurre therein with them or no. Which when they found that he did not, they flie off fairely from him; yea they sticke not to giue him the lie, and to tell him to his teeth, Ierem. 43. 2, 3. that the answer he brought them was no diuine Oracle, but an vntruth of his owne coyning at the instigation of Baruc. And in like manner doe many now adayes repaire to Gods Ministers for their opinion in cases of conscience concerning the lawfulnesse of some act that they are resolued on already; that if they deliuer their opinions with them, they may then be able to say, they had the iudgment of good Diuines for it, before they did it, or attempted ought in it, to stop the mouthes of those with that may afterward question it: but whether they concurre or

no, resolued to goe on, and so oft doe directly contrary to the iudgement and aduice of those whom they made shew to consult with. I say not, but that a man consulting with a Diuine, if he receiue not good satisfaction from him, is free still notwithstanding his sentence. But

            §. 18. A second point wherein this spirituallPoint 2. Watch consisteth, is, the diligent Obseruation of our owne speciall corruptions. 1 Pet. 2. 11. 
               I beseech you, brethren, saith the Apostle, as Pilgrims and Strangers, abstaine from fleshly lusts, that fight against the soule Sinne is the maine enemie and the 1 Cor. 15. 56. bane of mans soule.

And as in the world, where two neighbour kingdomes are at open warre either with other, there is an hostilitie in generall betweene all the Subiects of either, euen between those that neuer bore armes against,

nor euer saw either other; but this hostilitie is more specially executed and exercised betweene those that either border either vpon other, or are vp in armes in the field together either against other: So here, there is a generall hostilitie betweene each Soule and all Sinne, but that exercised in more speciall manner betweene each particular soule and some peculiar sinnes; and these commonly of two sorts, the sinnes of a mans calling or particular vocation, and the sinnes of a mans nature, or of his naturall constitution.
            §. 19. First, the sinnes of a mans Calling; vnder which head also may be comprehended the sinnes either of the places that men abide in, or of the times that they liue in.
            When I say the sinnes of a mans Calling, it is not so to be vnderstood, as if the workes or duties of any lawfull Calling were euill or sinfull in themselues: but that a man by occasion of his place and vocation, or his course of life and conuersation, may haue more, and more frequent occasions of some sinnes then of others, greater and stronger inducements and inticements to some sinnes then to others, which he is therefore more specially to keepe watch against.

Can a naturall man then by naturall helps so restraine and curbe his owne naturall corruptions, that they shall not come to breake forth on him, or to be discouered in him? And cannot Christian men, hauing spirituall and supernaturall helps, doe as much, yea or much more?

               Ester 6. 1. 
               On that night, saith the story of Assuerus, the Kings sleepe went from him. It is no watching to speake properly, neither is it thank-worthy, for a man to lie awake, because hee cannot sleepe: but when long continuance of waking, and the vsuall houre of rest, and the drowsinesse of his owne braine, and the heauinesse of his eies, and the example of others fast asleepe by him, shall all concurre and conspire as it were to cast him into a slumber, for a man Oculos vigilia fatigatos cadentesque in opere detinere. Senec. epist. 8. then to striue to keepe waking is true watching, and is thank-worthy indeed. So here for a man to keepe himselfe sober, when hee cannot come by wine or strong drinke, or when he wanteth his good-Fellowes to drinke with (for this it is one of those sociable sinnes; there is no life in it without company) it is Necessitas nō habet

But for a man to bee carefull not to breake the bounds of sobriety, when he shall be in place where wine is plenty, and no restraint of it, and where company will be egging him on, and vrging him with instance to take more then is meet, that is true temperance and praise-worthy indeed.

Are you not ashamed to be ouerseene with drinke in such sort as to make your selfe a scorne and a laughing stocke to euery one that beheld you, and to become no better then a beast?

thee wicked like him? Wilt thou imitate him in that, wherein thou condemnest him? and be like him in that which thou mislikest in him? Yea shall mans wronging thee make thee wrong God? his abusing thee make thee abuse Gods blessed name? his flying in thy face make thee flie in Gods face? What watching call wee this, for a man to keepe no longer awake, then till his eies begin to grow heauy, and then of his owne accord to settle himselfe vnto sleepe? Or what watching is it to keepe watch and ward, to fence and fortifie, where no assault is made, and to set no watch nor make resistance when we are indeed assaulted? to watch, till we see the enemie whom wee should watch against, approach; and so soone as we descrie him, as Iohn 10. 12.

No: it is in regard of continuall danger that wee are in, either by inward defect or by outward default, that this Watch is required: And therefore there must watch be most diligent, where is most likelihood of danger, or where hottest assault is made: Yea continuall watch must bee held and ioyned with resistance, not till assault only be made, but so oft as assault shall bee made, and so long as it shall continue: Which because it will so doe euer euen till we die, this our Watch must continue also euen vnto death.

we may be the better enabled to goe thorow therewith.
            The first may bee the practise of Sobrietie andHelpe 1. Temperance, Luk. 21. 34, 36. 
               Take heed, saith our Sauiour, lest at any time your hearts come to bee oppressed or surcharged with surfetting and drunkennesse, and with the cares of this life: and so that day come vpon you and surprize you vnawares: But watch and pray continually. And surely as it is with the body; so is it also with the soule. Temperate diet is a great helpe to bodily watching: and on the other side

               Be not filled with wine, (saith the Apostle) wherein is excesse; but be filled with the Spirit: as if when the one went in, the other went out; and there were no roome left for the one, when men are filled so with the other. Wee are wont to say that When the wine goeth in, the wit goeth out: but the Apostle saith, that when wine is thus taken in, the Spirit of God is expelled, (wherwith we should watch) &amp; the Spirit of Satan is entertained, (against which we should watch) and the Temple of the one is made a stie and a stable for the other.

               It is euill for a man to eat with offence; and with the disabling of himselfe vnto good duties: And it is euill for a man to vse game or any other lawfull delight in that manner, as it shall bee an occasion, either of stumbling to others, or of sinne and euill to himselfe. And, Rom. 14. 21. 
               It is not good therefore for a man to eat flesh, nor drinke wine, nor vse game, nor doe ought else, whereby either himselfe, or any other

shall be occasioned to sinne. For what we owe vnto others, Rom. 8. 12, 13. we owe much more to our selues; being enioyned Rom. 13. 8, 9. Leuit. 19. 18. Matth. 22. 39. Galat. 5. 14. to loue others indeed, but as our selues. And therefore ought wee to haue a care as well to Tit. 2. 12.

But it fareth with me, as with men at sea that are seasicke because they cannot brooke the sea: when they are in a greater ship, they thinke they should bee better, if they were in a lesse barke; it is the rolling of the great ship they thinke that maketh them so euill: and so out of the ship they get them into the boat or the barke. But in the ship or in the barke they are bad still, as euill as euer,

               He that walketh but with the wise, saith Salomon, shal wax wiser thereby: and he that keepeth company with fooles, shall be the worse for it. The very company of either is wont ordinarily to worke euen with some efficacie on those that much or oft conuerse though for other ends with either. A third helpe therefore vnto Watchfulnesse may be the shunning of the societie and fellowship of wicked and prophane persons. Psal. 6. 8. 
               Away from mee, saith Dauid, all ye workers of iniquitie. And, Psal. 101. 4.

               I am a companion of all those that feare thee, and keepe thy precepts. Such as feared God, were they high or low, were they rich or poore, they were for his company, he was content and desirous to bee acquainted with them.

Come we to any wicked man, that liueth neuer so loosely, and tell him that there is no feare of God in his heart; he will bee ready to cry out of presumptuous and vncharitable censurers, that take Gods office vpon them to see into mens soules, and to tell what is in mens hearts. But the Spirit of God it selfe telleth such, that Ex fructibus siquidem arbor dignoscitur: ex ramulis de radice iudicatur. Matth. 7. 20. &amp; 12. 33. their owne liues euidently discouer to any vnderstanding eye what is within them; their prophane and secure courses proclaime a want of this awe in them. For were there any the least measure of that feare of God in them, that they would bee thought to haue, yea were it but the seruile feare onely, that Iam. 2. 19. the Deuils themselues baue; they would not, nay they could not continue and goe on so carelesly, so securely in their dissolute courses as they doe;

And if it bee vncertaine when the generall day of Doome will bee, it is no lesse vncertaine, yea in some sort more vncertaine when thy particular day of doome will be.
            There are both affirmatiue and negatiue signes of the one; there may be affirmatiue, but there are no negatiue signes of the other. Of the generall day of Doome there are some affirmatiue signes; such as argue the neere approaching of it, Matth. 24. 32, 33. Luk. 21. 30, 31. as the tendernes of the bough and the sprouting out of the figtree doth the Summers approach. And there are some negatiue signes; such as 2 Thess. 2. 3. 
               till they come that day shall not bee, as Rom. 11. 25, 26, 31. the gathering in of the Iewes againe;

and Apoc. 17. 16, 17. the destruction of the Beast and the woman that sitteth on her.
            But of each mans particular Doomes-day, to wit, of his dying day, there may be signes affirmatiue, as decay of nature, old age, and some vncureable diseases; Vise Culsum de re medica l. 2. c. 6. by which it may bee knowne that the day of death is not far off. But negatiue signes of it there are none, of which we may say, till such or such things be, a man shall not die: a man cannot say, I am not weake, nor sicke, nor old yet; and therefore I know I shall not die yet.

For Gen. 19. 23, 24, 25. how many haue risen well in the morning, that neuer went to bed againe? Nonne multi sani dormierunt, &amp; obdormierūt? Aug. homil. 28. Et mors somno continuata est.

            But yet that rule of liuing euery day as if that day were a mans dying day, must bee conceiued for the manner of our behauiour and cariage, not for the matter and substance of it.
            To make this more plaine. For the maine matter and substance of a mans imployment, that is, the workes, duties and offices to be performed of him, it is not true. For did a man know that this day should be his last day, or had hee some strong presumption that it were so to be; it were not lawfull for him to follow, either his lawfull disports &amp; delights, or the ordinary works of his speciall calling; but rather leauing either of them, hee ought wholly to apply himselfe to the setting of his house in order, as Esai. 38. 1. 
               Esay willed Ezechias, and the making of all straight and euen betweene God and his owne soule, to praier and supplication, and such

holy meditations, as the present occasion should require.
            But for the manner of a mans cariage in those duties that he is daily called vnto, or is conuersant about, it is true; a man ought continually so to behaue himselfe in them, in being Hoc citra diem mortis praesta: moriantur ante te vitia.

            §. 56. And surely a speciall meane it would be to keepe vs in compasse, if wee could but thinke with our selues, when we are about to behaue our selues in ought otherwise then we ought, and then our conscience telleth vs that we should, Would I doe this, or doe thus, if this were to be my last worke; were I to die vpon the doing of it, or were I presently to giue vp an account, and to make mine answer before God for it?

               Let a man therefore, saith the same Apostle, examine himselfe, and so repaire to Gods boord. As examination of our selues is a meane to fit vs for Gods table, so is it a meane also to further vs in our account, which wee are to giue vp vnto God. Wee should liue euery day, as wee would, if we were to goe that day to Gods boord; and we should so addresse our selues when we are to repaire to Gods boord, as we would if we were then to goe vnto God: and the diligent discussing of our selues and our courses is a good meane to further vs in, to fit vs for either.

Watch is to be iealous of our selues and of our owne infirmitie and weaknesse, that we may soone be ensnared and easily surprised, foiled at least, if we be not exceeding wary, before wee be aware.

to shun all sinne, and whatsoeuer is euill in it selfe: so this iealousie of our selues, and feare of our owne infirmitie, will make vs carefull to eschew all occasions of sinne, and whatsoeuer by meanes of our weaknesse may become matter of euill vnto vs. For as those that know themselues to be of a weake stomacke, ready to take checke at such meats as many other ordinarily are wont to digest well enough, are very chary of their diet, and carefull to eschew and forbeare not such meats only as are simply vnwholesome, but euen such also as they suspect or suppose to be hard of digestion, and will not in that regard so well accord with their weaknesse: So Panaetius adolescentulo quaerenti, An Sapiens amaturus esset; De Sapiente, inquit, videbimus: mibi &amp;

               I was afraid, saith he, of all my workes; knowing, that if I did wickedly, thou wouldest not acquite me. And this suspitiousnesse of himselfe no doubt was it that caused him to Iob 31. 1.

            §. 64. Matth. 26. 41. 
               Watch and pray, saith our Sauiour, that ye enter not into temptation: the Spirit indeed is ready; but the flesh is weake. As if he had said more at large; Considering your owne infirmity and feeblenesse, ye haue great neede to take heed and earnestly to desire, that yee may not so much as touch vpon any temptation: For such is the pronenesse of your corrupt nature to giue way to them, that if you doe but enter into any temptation, though the Spirit purpose otherwise,

               Peter sometime did to stand bathing himselfe against the fire in the High-priests Hall; wee are suddainly caught, as he was, ere we thinke on it, we haue by some sudden iniection our affections so fired, that the very frame of our heart is all on a flame, ere we are aware of it, or are able now well either to preuent it, or easily to suppresse it.
            §. 65. Againe, this iealousie of our owne weaknesse will make vs the more carefull, as to shun all occasions, whereby we may bee endangered; so, because it is not in our power euer to auoid them,

to vse diligently all good meanes, whereby wee may be supported and strengthened against them. To which purpose our Sauiour ioyneth watching and praier together, as Matth. 26. 41. there, so Luke 21. 36. elsewhere: as also Ephes. 6. 18. 1 Pet. 4. 7. his Apostles oft couple them the one with the other.

And no maruell; For so long as wee finde our selues (as wee suppose) strong enough to stand alone on our owne legs of our selues, wee thinke scorne to vse crutches, or to be supported by others: so long as wee thinke our selues wise enough and able to wade well enough thorow with our affaires, Consilij satis est in me mihi. - Arachne apud Ouid. met. l. 6. wee regard not to take aduice or to seeke helpe and aid from others: So here, so long as we misdoubt not our owne weaknesse, as we are ouer-forward to presume vpon our owne strength, so we are ouer-backward and carelesse of vsing those meanes whereby we might attaine true strength indeed. And on the other side, the more conscious men are to themselues of their owne wants, the more diligent are they wont to be in resorting to those by whom their wants may bee supplied: and the more suspitious wee are of our owne infirmity and weaknesse, the more carefull will we be daily and hourely to repaire vnto him, who alone is able to confirme and strengthen vs, yea who is able so 2 Tim. 4. 17. to enable vs notwithstanding our weaknesse, that 2 Cor. 12 9, 10. his power and might shall appeare in vs amids our feeblenesse, and 2 Cor. 4. 7. our very infirmity shall make much for his glory.

               In this kinde, as one well saith, it is more behouefull for a man to be somewhat too fearefull and heedy, then to be a little too confident and foole-hardy: to take notice of his owne weaknesse, that hee may become strong, then while hee thinketh himselfe strong in his owne conceit, to proue weake. In regard whereof also the Wiseman, as we said formerly, not vnworthily pronounceth him Prou. 28. 14.

               Thou wilt deny me, Peter, saith our Sauiour, Nay, but I will not; saith Peter. Though all should deny thee, yet will not I deny thee: I will neuer deny thee, though I die for it. And no doubt of it but that

               Peter then both meant as hee spake, and spake what hee thought; hee misdoubted not himselfe, nor his owne inability, but hee would and should doe as then hee said. But Non se norat aegretus: sed agretum norat medicus. Verior

            And surely, as it befell Peter, so falleth it out with many other. They are like sicke men, - iussus requiescere, postquam Tertia compositas vidit nox currere venas &amp;c. Pers. sat. 3. Qui acuta febre diu laborauit, si morbus per bidnum triduumue intermiserit, dicit statim, Iam licet ad satietatē edere, &amp;c. Stella ad Luc. 11.

And so is it here with a many: they thinke themselues strong enough to encounter with Satan, especially if they haue stood out and come off well (as they thinke) in a temptation or twaine, and so Qui praesumit, minus veretur, minus praecauet, plus periclitatur. Tertull. de cultu foem. Timor salutis fundamentum est: praesumptio impedimentum timoris. Ibid. grow carelesse either of eschewing the occasions of euill, or of vsing meanes whereby they may be enabled to withstand them when they are offered: Which when they so doe, it is iust oft with God to leaue them to their owne strength, as the nurse doth the childe that will not endure to bee lead, and so to suffer them to fall, as soone then they will, sometime to their eternall ruine, that

they may deseruedly perish through their owne folly and foole-hardinesse; sometime to their present paine, but their future amendment, that hauing had experience of their owne feeblenesse and inability to stand of themselues, they may in time to come be more wary, more distrustfull of their owne strength, and more carefull to resort from time to time vnto him, from whom onely true strength is to be had.
            And for this end no doubt hath the Holy Ghost left vpon record the foule slips and fals of many of Gods worthy Saints and Seruants, not that any should thereby bee incouraged or emboldned vnto sin; but Vt cautela minorum sit ruinae maiorū. Greg. mor. lib. 33. c. 15. Scriptae sunt ruinae priorum ad cautelam posteriorum. Stultus quippe est, qui praecedentem cadere videt &amp; ipse non cauet. Rad. Ardent post Trinit. 9.

               that the ruine of such great ones might make weaker ones more wary; that where we haue seene them slip for want of watchfulnesse, there might we be more watchfull: that when we see others foiled farre stronger then our selues, it might make vs the more to distrust our owne strength: Which the more we distrust, the lesse shall we presume on it, and the more carefull shall wee be to vse all good meanes, whereby true strength may be atchieued of vs and increased in vs.
            §. 67. A ninth Helpe to further vs in this spirituall Watch is a sincere hatred of euill, that we labour not onely to condemne sinne in iudgement, but euen to hate and detest it in heart. Prou. 8. 13. 
               The feare of God, saith Salomon, is to hate euill: not to forbeare it onely, but, as the Apostle speaketh, Rom. 12. 9. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . 
               to abhorre it. The seruile feare may make a man breake off the

practise of sinne outwardly in his life, (wicked men, had they but it, durst not goe on in their wicked courses as they doe) but the filiall feare will doe more then that, it will make a man hate and detest it also inwardly in his heart: For this feare it is a louing feare, Timor Dei cum amore coniunctus. Caluin▪ instit. l. 1. 
               a feare ioyned with loue, yea proceeding from the loue of him whom we feare. And Psal. 97. 10. 
               ye that loue the Lord, saith the Psalmist, hate that that is euill. 
               Amas Deum? debes odisse quod odit. Aug. in Psal. 96. 
               Doest thou loue God, saith Augustine; thou must hate then what hee hateth: Yea if thou louest him indeed, thou canst not but hate what he hateth.
            Neither indeed can we Rom. 12. 9. 
               closely cleaue to that that is good, till wee haue brought our hearts to detest and abhorre that that is euill. Which thing if it were once throughly wrought in vs, there should not neede much Rhetoricke to perswade vs to watch both against sinne and against all occasions of it: Wee would of our selues bee carefull enough to shun and auoid that, which our hearts abhorred, and could not brooke or abide. For as the meat that a man loatheth, he cannot endure so much as the sent or sauour of it, nay nor, it may be, the sight of it: so would it be with vs in regard of sinne, had we the like inward dislike and loathing of sinne in our soules. And Stomachum fecit illi luxuria: citò tamen cum illa redibit in gratiam. Tunc de illo feremu

                  uenit. Sen. ep. 112. one maine cause of relapse into sinne, and of want of due watchfulnesse against it, in those that for some time haue surceased the practise of it, is because they neuer hated it in heart, though they could not but in iudgement condemne it, being euidently conuinced in conscience of the euilnesse of it: Psal. 66. 18. 
               their heart looked still

               after it (though their hand for feare or other respect were for a while with-drawne and with-held from it) ready therefore when such respects as before staied and restrained it were at any time remoued, to giue friendly entertainment vnto it againe.
            §. 68. Would wee therefore keepe a constant Watch against sinne? Oh let vs labour then to haue wrought in vs a true hatred of sinne; of such sinnes especially, as we haue beene most addicted vnto, or haue most delighted in before. The more formerly wee haue loued them, the more now let vs loath them: the more we haue for the time past delighted in them, the more for the time to come let vs euen detest and abhorre them.

wee haue formerly defiled our soules with, wee should labour to haue our loue in like manner turned into hatred; and Si quaeris odio misera quem statuas modum; Imitare amorem. - Senec.

            This could wee doe with Ammon; wee would doe further as he did. 2 Sam. 13. 16, 17. He thrust Tamar instantly out at doores, when his affection was thus altered; hee could no longer endure so much as the sight of her: and not that onely, but he caused the doore to be bolted fast after her, that shee might not haue any free or further accesse in vnto him againe. So were our hearts and affections estranged from such sinnes, as they had beene linked and fastened vnto before, wee would not only bee carefull without further delay to dispossesse our soules of them, but wee would bee constantly watchfull to keepe the doore of our heart surely bolted against them, that they might neuer be able to gaine entrance againe with vs.

            §. 73. Now this is done by meanes either publike or priuate. First by frequenting the publike ministery of the word at due times. 1 Thess. 5. 19, 20. 
               Quench not the spirit, saith the Apostle: despise not Prophesie: as if the neglect, or contempt (and it is the contempt of it that is the maine ground of neglect) of the one were a principall meane of extinguishing and quite quenching the other. And vndoubtedly so is it. For either fire or light is put out, not by pouring on of water onely or some contrary matter; but besides that, either by withdrawing from it and denying that vnto it that should feede it; (for Pro. 26. 20. Deficientibus lignis deficit ignis. if the fewell faile, the fire will of it selfe out:) or by neglecting to blow it, and to stirre it vp by times; as wee oft see it fall out that it goeth out of it selfe also, where yet there is wood and coale enough to haue longer continued, had some such industry beene vsed. And euen so is spirituall grace oft impaired and decaieth, not by the practise of sinne and wickednesse only, as by water poured on it; but by neglect of the word, the meanes that should foster and feed it, and that by raising and rowsing vp our dull and dead spirits should Psalm. 119. 28, 37, 50, 93. put spirituall life and alacritie, as it were, vnto vs. And no maruell then, if, as Salomon saith, Prou. 29. 18. 
               Where vision faileth, there the people perish: if the

               pen hymnes, both of praise and of praier: many holy and heauenly meditations had he in the time of his exilement, as may appeare by Psal. 7 &amp; 22. &amp; 34. &amp; 52. &amp; 54. &amp; 56. &amp; 57. &amp; 1

                  9. &amp;c. those diuine ditties during it composed of him. And yet could not he content himselfe with these his priuate deuotions. But, as

               Psal. 42. 4. &amp; 122. 1. it was the very ioy of his heart, when hee was at home, to repaire to the Temple, to the publike assemblies there held: so nothing made his banishment, and his abode in forraine parts, more bitter vnto him, then this, that by meanes thereof hee was restrained of repairing vnto them, and of ioyning with Gods people in such holy duties as were there daily performed. Read diuers of the Psalmes framed by him during that time; and consider well, Psal. 27. 4. &amp; 42. &amp; 63. &amp; 84. how bitterly hee bewaileth his restraint in this kinde; how instantly hee sueth to God for freedome of resort; how hee blesseth those that had liberty of repaire or place of abode there, euen the very birds themselues that had accesse but to build thereabout: and you will soone see a strange difference betweene that worthy man of God and these, that so highly ouer-prize their owne priuate deuotions, as thus to vnder-value the publike assemblies of Gods Saints, and the ministery of his word.
            §. 75. And yet neither also is this sufficient indeed, that we frequent the publike meanes: priuate helpes must be added and adioyned thereunto, of meditation, of conference, of supplication, of examination, of confession, and the like: that though much or most of the weeke be taken vp with our worldly affaires; yet wee reserue some time amids them constantly euery day for some spirituall imployment. For as it is with our clockes and our watches, that vnlesse they bee wound vp at certaine times, they will slacken their motion, yea by meanes of the heauy weights and

plummets of lead that hang on them, they will at length come downe to the ground, and so stand stone still: So is it with our soules; wee haue our earthy affections and our worldly thoughts, as heauy weights, hanging so at the heeles of them, that vnlesse they be at some certaine times wound vp, as it were, by the vse of some holy exercises, they will grow slacke and sluggish in their mounting vp to heauen-ward, yea at length, it may be, come to an vtter cessation of all endeuour in that kinde.
            For this cause Dauid, as Psal. 1. 1, 2. he maketh this one property of a Blessed man, that hee maketh Gods law his daily, yea and his nightly meditation: So he professeth of himselfe, that it was Psal. 119. 97. one of his daily exercises to meditate on Gods word; and Psal. 16. 7. &amp; 63. 5, 6. &amp; 119. 62. it was his nightly imploiment to be singing of Gods praises. He had certaine set times euery day for meditation and inuocation, Psal. 55. 7. 
               at morning, at noone-tide, and at euen: And besides those ordinary set times, he tooke occasion oft extraordinarily, as opportunity was offered, euen Psal. 119. 164. 
               seuen times a day, that is, many times, to be lauding of the Lord, either for his iudgements, or for his mercies.
            And the like should we doe euery one of vs, if we desire to keepe this spirituall watch fresh in our soules, and Rebus non me trado, sed commodo. Quocunque cō

Quicquid facies, citò redi à corpore ad animum: illum diebus ac nectibus exerce. would not haue them wholly dulled with or drowned in the world: wee should set some time apart euery day from our worldly affaires, to be spent in reading, in meditation, in conference (with God, at least) in prayer and inuocation of his name, in search of our soules,

in acknowledgement of our sinnes, &amp;c. And so intermingle the one with the other, that by ouereager attending the one we doe not wholly neglect the other.
            It is that that would fit vs for the publike ministerie, and make it the more effectuall with vs: As on the other side Logatur Chrysost▪ de Lazaro &amp; Diuite, homil. 3. it is well obserued, that the want of such priuate imployments maketh the publike ministerie altogether vnprofitable with many; 2 Tim. 3. 7. who heare much, and are at many Sermons, but gaine little by any, because they are not carefull heereby, either to prepare their hearts before-hand, to receiue the seede of the word as into ground fitted for it, or to water and cherish what they haue taken in on the Sabbath, by a constant course of religious offices in the weeke following.
            §. 76. Nor let any man alledge heere in way of excuse for himselfe, that for the workes of his calling, they are so many, so manifold, hee cannot possibly finde any spare time to spend thus in religious imployments. For (to omit what might be said further in way of answer hereunto) did they esteeme so highly of holy things as the worth of them well deserueth, they would finde time for them as well as they doe ordinarily for matters of farre lesse weight then it. Yea (that which is a foule shame to consider) those that will pretend such straites of time to shift off such imployments, can finde many of them time enough (if not more then enough) to follow their vaine and idle disports. And canst thou

finde euery day almost spare time enough at large for the one? and canst thou no day almost finde the least spare time at all for the other? Vndoubtedly that day maist thou well esteeme but euill imployed, whereof thou spendest more part in thy vaine delights, then in the aduancement of thy spirituall good.
            To conclude, if wee will watch aright and as wee ought; as the workes of our speciall callings must not be neglected, so our spirituall good, and those meanes either publike or priuate that tend directly to the nourishing and improuing of it, are to bee principally regarded: And therefore so are we to ply and follow the one, that yet euen amids them we take time for, and Sicut laborantibus manibus nec ocu

Bern. de diuers. 40. exclude not wholly all minding and meditation of the other; yea so warily in their due season to attend either, that neither wee bee surprised with slouth and idlenesse on the one side, nor yet with worldlinesse on the other.
            And thus haue we seene both what it is to watch, why we are so to watch; the manner how we must watch; and the meanes whereby we may be enabled so to watch in some measure.
            §. 77. Now here, ere we end, would a QuestionQuestion▪
                be answered. For may some say; But is it possible for any man liuing by this manner of watching to keepe euer waking; by thus watching against sinne, to keepe himselfe wholly free from sinne?
            
            To passe by here that conceit of some Schoolemen,Answer. that a man cannot keepe himselfe free from all sinne in generall; but that he may from any one

sinne whatsoeuer in particular; that hee may, though not from all, yet from this or that sinne. Which they expresse by a similitude Exemplum ponitur de existente in vase perforato, qui licet possit quod libet singulorum foraminum obstruere, non tamen omnia: dum enim vnum obstruit, aliud patens relinquitur. Scotus in 2. dist. 28. q. 1. of a man enclosed in a barrell full of holes let downe vnder water, that may with his finger or some other helpe stop any one hole and keepe the water out at it, which yet hee cannot auoide but that it will come in the whilest at the rest, any of which yet also he may stop if he will. But to passe by this, which I take to bee not all out so sound; for answer hereunto some distinction must be made.
            Sinnes therefore are of two sorts, either voluntary,Sinnes. or inuoluntary; either with the will, or without it.
            Some sinnes are inuoluntary, or without theSort 1. will, such as be absolutely either beside or against it; as are all sinnes, In quibus est voluntas facti, sed non voluntas peccati. Aug. retract. l. 1. c. 15. of pure ignorance, and of meere infirmitie.
            Sinnes of pure or bare Ignorance I call those in which ignorance is simple or single, not affected, and Et comes &amp; causapeccati. Nauarr. enchirid. cap. 23. §. 46. not a Companion onely but a Cause. It is not with men in them, as it is with those that affect Ignorance, and please themselues in it; and Vt liberius peccent, libenter ignorant. Bern, de bon. deser. that without checke of conscience they may more freely offend, are content so to continue: but they desire to bee informed aright, and vse the best meanes they can so to informe themselues; but yet are mistaken, and so doe that out of ignorance, Si scissent, non secissent. Tertull. apolog. which for a world they would neuer haue done, had they knowne it to be euill.
            
               Sinnes of meere Infirmity or frailty I call those, Rom. 7. 21, 23. Gal. 5. 17. velimus nolimus, habemus illas: titillant, blā
                  diuntur, stimulant, infestant. Aug. de verb. Dom. 45. Vt non sint, vultis, sed non potestis. Ibid. &amp; de verb. Ap. 4.

Thus in hearing the word, a man, it may be, cannot listen so attentiuely for any long time together, but that many bythoughts will come buzzing and fluttring about him, as Gen. 15. 11. Stella in Luc. 11. Hildebert, epist. 7. Et Berengos. de luce visib. &amp; invis. the fowles did about Abraham when he was offering of his sacrifice, and will oft, Distinguendum inter cogitationes illas, quibus voluntas fauet, quas cum dilectione amplectitur, &amp; illas quae repugnanti atque invito animo suggeruntur, quibus mens cum horrore quodam renititur, vt resistat, quibus vt contristatur admissis, ita gaudet repulsis. Pelag. ad Demetriad. Aliud est enim nolentem tangi, aliud consentientem animū perimi, Greg. mor. lib. 21. cap. 7. pressing in vpon him in spight of his heart, disturbe him and hinder him in that holy exercise: yea sometime the more a man striueth and bendeth himselfe to banish and beat them away, the more hee commeth to be pestred and encombred by them, and his attention to bee tainted and infected withall. Thus in prayer oft Psal. 43. 3, 4, 5. a man cannot shake off that deadnesse or dulnesse and drowsinesse of spirit, that possesseth his soule, and depriueth him of that alacrity and feruency that ought then to be in him. Thus a man railed vpon and reuiled, though hee can keepe his tongue from breaking out into euill language, and can stay his hand from striking in way of reuenge; yet hee cannot for his heart bloud, it may be, doe hee what hee can, Nam ne

               rebelling against the law of his minde, or from swelling and boiling with some wrathfull passion and inordinate motion within him. Thus Psal. 42. 5, 6, 11. Mark. 9. 24. in distresse or danger euen a godly man many times

cannot rest and rely vpon God with that firmenesse and confidence of faith, and with that quietnesse and tranquillity of minde, that hee ought, and not onely desireth with all his heart, but with all his might and best ability endeuoureth to doe.
            §. 78. Now sinnes of this kinde cannot bee auoided, be a man neuer so carefull, neuer so wary and watchfull: (a man cannot watch there, where hee suspecteth no euill; nor can his watching auaile him beyond his ability:) which 2 Chron. 30. 18, 19. Nehem. 1. 11. Rom. 7. 17, 20. God therefore in mercy vouchsafeth his children a daily pardon of course for, and is content graciously to passe by and put vp in them; though Luke 12. 48. Rom. 7. 15, 16, 21, 23. 1 Iohn 3. 4▪
                in rigor of iustice he might deseruedly call them to a strict account for them. And yet by the constant vse of this religious watch hauing our iudgements better cleered, and our hearts confirmed and strengthened, we may come in time to be lesse subiect to the former sort of them, and lesse exposed also to the latter.
            Other sinnes besides those are all more or lesseSort 2. voluntary, and are committed in part at least with the will of the committer: such are sins Matth. 13. 25. of negligence and ouersight, escaping vs through carelesnesse; Matth. 26. 31, 74, 75. of mixt infirmitie, proceeding from temptations of much terror; of Deut. 17. 12. presumption, Psal. 19. 13. Num. 15. 30, 31. pride, and 2 Cor. 12. 21. 1 Tim. 5. 6. wantonnesse, occasioned by delightfull obiects, and the like. Yea such are the most, if not all, outward grosse sinnes ioyned with knowledge, which euen a naturall man therefore might forbeare if he would; and which it were an vniust

The other sleepeth but vnquietly, like the Watchman that against his will in part falling asleepe, hath but an vnquiet sleepe of it, and euen watcheth in some sort in his sleepe, he is dreaming of the danger that he is or may be in, and of the enemies approach, whom he is set to watch against. It is that which wee may obserue in the Churches sleepe in the Canticles; Cant. 5. 2. 
               I sleepe, saith she, but mine heart is
               
               awake. We vse to say of children, that their heart is asleepe euen when their eies are awake: contrariwise it is said of the children of God, that their eies oft are asleepe when their heart is awake: so that though they be outwardly borne-downe and caried away with the stiffe winde, or the strong streame of some violent and vntoward temptation, yet their heart inwardly is not wholly surprised with it, they sinne not with a full and an absolute consent of will in it; there is some secret mislike still of themselues in that they doe, and some inward strife and reluctation (though not at all times alike sensible) more or lesse against it, euen in the very act vsually of committing it.

fall backe into this spirituall Lethargie, likely to be in worse case and more irrecouerable then wee were at the first: Let it not suffice vs, that we haue beene awaked out of our sinfull and secure courses, but let vs bee carefull by all good meanes to keepe our selues so waking and watching; by due examination of our seuerall actions ere we enter vpon them; diligent obseruation of our speciall corruptions that we may contend and striue against them; carefull auoidance of the occasions of euill, that they be not offered; and constant resistance of temptations vnto euill, when we are therewith assaulted: And that we may the better so watch and hold out in this our watch; let vs labour to keepe an holy moderation and sobriety in the vse of all Gods good creatures; hold fellowship with the godly that may haue an eye to vs; shun the society of wicked ones that may taint and infect vs; striue to preserue the feare of God fresh in our soules; endeuour to perswade our hearts of Gods presence euer with vs; thinke oft on our end, and our account to come after it; be oft casting vp reckonings betweene God and our soules; haue a iealousie of our owne infirmitie and procliuity vnto euill; labour to haue a sincere hatred of sinne wrought in our hearts; and lastly be diligent in the duties of our particular vocations, and constant in frequenting of religious exercises as well publike as priuate. Thus watching we shall preuent and escape many euills, that for want of this watchfulnesse, to our woe afterward, we might otherwise be ouertaken withall; we shall
