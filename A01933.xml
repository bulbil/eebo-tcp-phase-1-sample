            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               An aſtronomicall Deſcription of the late Comet, or blazing-ſtar.
            
            
               I Hope there bee none ſo farre more precize then wiſe, as to thinke it vnlawfull to looke on this celeſtiall Signe with other then vulgar and poreblinde eyes: (which were ſtill to maintaine ignorance mother of deuotion.) Or if any ſuch there be, I ſhall meet with them in the cloſure of this Treatiſe, and therefore without further tedious Prologue;
            May it pleaſe you to ſuruay this celeſtiall Planisſpheare, whoſe lineaments are optically proiectedHow the Planisſpheare is delineate. vpon a plaine touching the Ecliptique in the twentieth degree of the dodecatemory of Libra, the eye being placed in the center of the Spheare, from whence all the great circles doe appeare right lines, as they are in the chart protracted. Which thing is of ſpeciall vſe in our preſent buſineſſe (as you ſhall anon perceiue) for which cauſe I preferred this new

manner of proiection (though to my greater paines) before any other in common practiſe.
            
               The Ecliptique. The loweſt line of all is the Ecliptique line, from which the Sunne (as other Planets doe to ſome few degrees) neuer ſtrayeth.
            
               Parallels of latitude. The crooked prickt lines bee parallels of latitude from the Ecliptique towards the Articke Pole therof: the ſpace betwixt euery two lines is fiue degrees.
            
               Circles of longitude. The other right lines falling down perpendicular on the Ecliptique be circles of longitude; beginning at the fifth degree of Virgo, and ſo forwards to the fifth of Sagittary: the ſpaces be alſo fiue degrees: by theſe two kinde of lines, it is eaſie to finde the longitude and latitude of any ſtarre in the chart, and alſo of the Comer.
            Theſe circles of longitude do in the Spheare concurre in the pole, but this proiection in plano doth keep them parallel, or at a continued equall diſtance each from other.
            
               Aequinoctiall line. From the beginning of Libra towards Capricorne, is extended the aequinoctiall line, to whoſe interſections with the Ecliptique when the Sun commeth, the nights and dayes bee equall; as alwayes in all places of the earth vnder the ſame.
            From this line, towards each Pole, is counted the declinations of Stars, the greateſt part of this Planiſpheare is on the Arcticke or Northerne ſide: but theſe things are plainely remonſtrate to the eye in the chart, and therefore I will make no further explanationPictured Conſtellations. of them; neither of the Conſtellations emblematically pourtrayed according to the myſticall Hieroglyphicks of ancient Sages.
            
               
               The ſtars places. The place of each particular ſtarre is correſpondent to the moſt accurate obſeruations of the illuſtrious Prince William late Lant Graue of Heſſen, and that treſnoble Dane Tycho Brahe, of whoſe admirable Vranicall inſtruments many honourable witneſſes are ſtill ſuruiuing.
            But it (for whom all this preparation is made) is the late Comet, whoſe delineation is taken from mine owne vigilant and diligent obſeruations with Geometricall inſtruments, eſpecially the Radius, orHow the Comet was obſerued. Croſſe-ſtaffe, eternized by the heroike Poet:

                  Deſcripſit radio totum qui Gentibus orbem,
                  Tempora quae meſſor, quae curuus arator haberet.
               
            
            Who with his Iacobs ſtaffe ſuruay'd the ground,
            Did meaſure times, and all the Heauens round. The firſt occaſion and particular manner of which obſeruations with the ſcrupulous and punctuall places (of the Comet) from them by neceſſity of ſphericall triangles deducted, I leaue to my Latine Cometography, which (if theſe labours finde acceptance at home) I will adorne for Franckfurt: of whoſe more curious and ample demonſtrations, this little chart is a true Synopticke Epitome; wherein may at once bee ſeene the Comets place, as it daily appeared in the concaue ſurface of Heauen: theThe Cometary line. line of his proper motion (appearing in the Heauens to be the arch of a perfect great circle) croſſeth the Ecliptique in the 15 degree, with ½or thereabouts of Scorpio, running through the Conſtellation of Libra, ouerthwart Arctophylax, along the extent ofAmongst what Conſtellations. his left arme by the taile of Vrſa maior, towards the Pole Arctick, but a little more Southward.
            
               
This Cometary line cutteth the AequinoctialllineInclination to the Aequinoctiall. in the 8 degree almoſt of Scorpio, and 15 of Northerne latitude: making with it an angle of 81 degrees 23 towards Libra and the Pole Arctick. If this angle had heene right 90 degrees, the line of the Comets motion would haue runne into the very Pole, but making ſome inclination towards Libra, it fell (as I ſayd) a little Southwards from the Pole.
            
               To the Ecliptique. This line alſo and the Ecliptique (towards Capricorne and the North) comprehended an angle of 116 degrees. So that the Pole of the Comets proper motion was about 15 ½. degrees of Aquarius▪
                with 25 degrees ⅔ of Northerne latitude.
            
               The Comets motion in this line. The motion it ſelfe (reckoned in this line) from my firſt obſeruation on Wedneſday morning the 18 of Nouember, to Wenſday the 16 of December when I laſt ſaw the Comet, amounted almoſt to 73 degrees in 28 dayes: which is not 2 degrees ⅔ oneA little ſwifter at the firſt. day with another: but the Comets apparant motion at the firſt was ſomewhat ſwifter, though not much, and in the end a little ſlower.
            I haue for the further remonſtrance heereof graduated the Cometary line; beginning at the interſectionTo finde it by the Planiſpheare. with the Aequinoctiall both wayes: and by the Comets place ſet downe the time.
            Heere I would haue thoſe who ranke Comets amongſt inconſtant Meteors, to take ſpeciall noticeNote ther gu'arity thereof. of this Comets conſtant regularity, for that the inequality of his motion was not onely little, but ordinate, ſucceſſiuely decreaſing ſenſim ſine ſenſa, by ſo little and little, that it could not be perceiued, but by comparing many dayes obſeruations.
            
               
               Scarſe one fourth part of the Moones motion. Let them alſo obſerue that his motion in this line was ſcarſe at the ſwifteſt one fourth part of the Moones celerity: but of this anon.
            I will alſo propound to Maſters in Aſtronomy this Comets exact and direct deſcription (by his apparantIn one exact great circle. motion) of a great circle without any deuiations. What was the true line of his motion in the aetheriall Ocean? What inclination it kept to this our habitable Orb? By what Primum Mobile this Comet (keeping ſo iuſt a line) was whirled about theAſtronomicall propoſitions cocerning the Comets motion. earth euery foure and twenty houres?
            Theſe conſiderations bee onely fit for thoſe who haue beene rapt vp aboue the elementary regions of vulgar Schooles: and ſlept not in Parnaſſus, but Olympus, vnder the ſpangled canopy of Vrania; I can hardly keepe within the ſpheare of this little Treatiſe, and ſcarſely refraine from the Samian Philoſophy of Ariſtarchus in the earths motion, were it not I feared another Ariſtarchus his broach: and that I muſt reſerue theſe myſteries for a more learned language. Wherefore to proſecute our preſent deſcription: Vpon the inclination of this CometaryThe Comets motion in Longitude and latitude. circle or line to the Ecliptique and Aequinoctiall, depend the Comets places and motion in longitude, latitude, right aſcenſion and declination, as appeares in the Planiſpheare; wherein is manifeſt, that the Comets motion of longitude was continually retrograde,Continually retrograde. contrary to the order of the ſignes, from the middle almoſt of Scorpio, through Libra into Virgo▪
                which retrogreſſion hath beene noted in many other Comets, as I ſhall elſewhere relate; but the cauſe of their retrogreſſion hath laien hid in the myſticall

cabinet of Aſtronomy. It were vaine to affirmeBut not from Saturne. 
               Saturne now alſo retrograde in his Acronichiall oppoſition in Gemini, to hale backe this Comet by the haire after him (as ſimple Aſtrologians conceit) for that theſe planetary retrogreſſions and ſtations▪ of Planets bee but 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , appearances; the Planets ſtill making progreſſe in their owne circles, (as is well knowen to them who are well verſedFrom whence was cauſed his retrogreſſion. in the Labyrinths of Aſtronomy) but this Comets retrogreſſion depends on the inclination of his true line in the aetheriall Regions, which though it appeared to vs circular in the concaue of Heauen, yet in it ſelfe was right: but I may not breake Pythagorean ſilence.
            This retrograde motion being referred to the Ecliptique in longitude was (contrary to the motionSlower in the beginning. in his proper circle) ſlow in the beginning, and much ſwifter in the end; which is cauſed from the great inclination of the Cometary line to the Ecliptique, which plainely appeareth in the Chart, by which you ſhall eaſily finde the Comets place in longitude and latitude for any day of his tearme.
            
               Comets declination from the Aequinoctiall. The Comet alſo euery day changed his parallel of declination (mounting continually Northwards) and therewith his verticall paſſage ouer the Earth.
            The common ſort, at his firſt appearing, thought him to bee ouer Spaine, making I know not what prognoſticks thereof: but their eyes deceiued them,Was not at firſt ouer Spaine. they aimed many thouſand miles too ſhort: At my firſt obſeruation he declined twelue degrees towards the South, making his diurnall gyre ouer that terreſtiall circle wherein lie Noua Guinea, the Iles Timor

About the twentie two of Nouember it entred the aequinoctiall plaine ouer the Moluccas, Malaca, Sumatra, Abaſsia, St. Thomas, Guiana; euery day aſcending higher towards our Pole Arctick, about the 30. entring the Tropick of Cancer, afterward paſſing ouer all the regions of the earth, euen ouer the vtmoſt limites of the Britiſh Empire.
            
               How to know ouer whoſe head it was eueryday. By the Comets declination is eaſie to know ouer what place the Comet was euery day verticall: for if his declination be equall to the Latitude, or Poles elevation, (which may be knowne by Tables or Mappes) then of neceſſity did the Comet paſſe ouer head in that place. The middle of Spaine lyes in fortie degrees of Latitude from the equinoctiallWhen ouer Spaine.
                northward; but the Comets declination was not ſo much, till about the ſixt of December; and therefore could not be verticall to them before that time.
            
               
                  Over London. About the eleuenth of December his declination was fiftie one degrees and halfe, and therefore paſſed ouer London in the morning, and ſo haſted more Northwards euen as farre as the Orcades.
            
            The Comets declination may be had in the chart by the line of his motion being graduated on both ſides the aequinoctiall: for the diſtance from the aequinoctiall is (with a little correction) the declination: for from one degree to twentie, the diſtance is within a few minutes the declination: but fromTo finde the Comets declination by the planiſphere. twentie degrees to fortie ſubſtract one fourth part of a degree, from fortie to fiftie ſubſtract halfe a degree, and from fiftie to ſixtie ſubſtract one degree

from the Comets diſtance (from the aequinoctiall) and there remaines his declination, which whether it were South or North the Plani-ſphere will ſhew.
            On the third of December his diſtance in his own line from the aequinoctiall was 30. degrees 40. min. from whence 15. min. ſubſtracted there remaines 30. degrees &amp; twenty fiue minutes the declination.
            
               The alteration of his riſing. By reaſon of this mounting Northwards, the Comet did euery day riſe ſooner then other, withall changing his azimuth, or point of compaſſe (in his riſing) from South-eaſt and by Eaſt towards the north vntill at length it made continual abode aboue our Horizon.
            
               Seen after Sunſet. I may not forget that the Comet in the later part of his period was North-weſt after ſunne-ſet, which gaue occaſion to ſome not skilfull in Aſtronomie to affirme a ſecond Comet. But from the beginning I fore-told (which was no great matter to doe) that if the Comet continued awhile, it would aduance neere to the tayle of Vrſa maior, and be ſeene in the euening after the Sunne.
            
               The Comets blazing ſtream. Now are we come to that from which Comets, or Blazing-ſtars are denominated; the tayle, or rather the blazing ſtreame, which in this Comet was very remarkable, and is truely pourtraied in the planiſphere, as it appeared in the heauens, being alwaies in oppoſition to the Sunne, or extended in length according to a right line iſſuing from the SunneAlwaies in oppoſition to the Sun. through the Comets body. For plainer remonſtrance whereof I ſpecially invented this new manner of proiecting the Spheare in plano, and haue cauſed the Elipticke to be protracted to the beginning

of Capicorne, and in it the Suns place exactly noted on ſeuerall daies of the Comets apparition, alſo from the Sunnes Center proceede right lines through the body of the Comet which doe preciſely ſhew the true proſpect of his buſhie lockes.
            The 27. of Nouember in the morning the Comets haire was ſpread ouer the faire ſtarre Arcturus betwixt the thighes of Arctophylax or Bootes. Now the planiſpheare doth ſhew that a right line drawne from the Sunne then in the 15 degree of Sagittarie through the Comets body

                approach the ſaid Starre. So the laſt of November about midnight following the Comets buſh ouer-ſhadowed a ſtarre of the third light in the left hinder knee of Vrſamaior. Which doth manifeſtly appeare in the planiſpheare by a line extended from the Sunne (then in 19. degrees of Sagittarie) through the Comets body; the like may be ſeene in other places.
            In-ſooth this Comets forelock was a better Ephemeris for the Sunnes place then many in great requeſt.
            
               The buſhie lockes not of the ſame matter with the Comets head. Hence is detected the groſſe ignorance of thoſe writers who neuer or ſeldome caſt vp their eies towards thoſe glorious lights, but onely delighting in ſolitary contemplation doe much buſie their wits in ſearching the cauſe of Cometary ſtreamings; affirming them to be of the ſame matter (but more rare and thin) with the head. Which with many other abſurdities may be refuted by this preſent obſeruation; which doth 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                by geometricall and lineall neceſſitie certainely demonſtrate that theWhat it is. Comets taile is nothing elſe but an irradiation of the

Sunne through the pellucide head of the Comet. For though the Sunne-beames be not of themſelues conſpicuous in the pure aëry or aetheriall regions, yet paſſing through the Comets more condenſed ſubſtance and there by refraction recollected and more neerely vnited they did not onely illuſtrate the Comet it ſelfe, but alſo a long tract beyond him.
            According to the refraction and recollection of the Sunnes beames, ſo was the illuſtration and illumination of the Comet; which appeared to vsHow the Comet varnihed. more or leſſe as the Comet was neerer or farther from the earth: and theſe be the true reaſons why the Comet (which at firſt was illuſtrate with a bright reſplendence) did euery day more and more looſe his radiant luſtre till at length it appeared like a faint ſhadow, and quite vaniſhed out of our ſight: for neither could the Sun beames be any longer vnited by refraction in the Comets now diſſolute and ſluide ſubſtance, neither could that little glimpſe (if any were) be perceiued, being ſo farre remote from the earth, as ſhall be anon remonſtrate.
            By the ſame reaſons did the Comets ſtreaming buſh alſo by little and little vaniſh away, and ſo much the rather, by how much the Sunne rayes were there alwayes more diſſipate then in the Comet, and thoſe locks euer leſſe relucent then the head.
            
               The forelockes dilatation from whence. The dilatation of the Comets fore-locke was cauſed by a ſecond refraction of the Sunne beames, by which refraction they were brought to an interſection, after which they beganne againe to diverge,

or diſplay themſelues in that forme which appeared in the heauens, and is delineate in the planiſpheare.
            
               The exceeding length of it. This dilatation was nothing ſo ſtrange, as the extent in length, being ſometimes more then 45. degrees, and namely the 1. of December, ouerſhadowing the left hinder knee of Vrſa maior.
            
            Though in the end the Comet did as it were winde vp this long haire about his head.
            Some haue doubted, if this long ſtreame of light had touched the earth, whether it would haue cauſed any combuſtion? Surely no: Indeede the Sun beames may by reflexion or refraction bee ſoIt had no burning qualitie. concentred &amp; vnited, that (though it were through a peece of ice framed into a burning glaſſe) they ſhall eaſily ſet any combuſtible matter on fire; but that happens onely in the center of vnion, or concourſe of the recollected beames: but this Comets lockes being diverged, or diſplaied rayes, could haue no ſuch power though they had touched the earth.
            
               Many ſtrange concluſions may be drawne from the Sunnes irradiation through the Comet. From this one obſeruation of the Sunnes irradiation through the Comet many more ſtrange and excellent concluſions may be collected, which neither my leaſure will ſuffer mee to examine particularly, neither can theſe pages well containe them.
            Wherefore now I will tye vp this Comets radiant lockes with admiration of that glorious lampe, wherewith He that inhabits the light inacceſſible doth illuſtrate, and enlighten this whole world.

               The Comets place about the Moone argued from the rigularitic of his motion. Wherefore I may iuſtly vſe the Lacedemonian

               , walke not in the errors of thoſe wandring Philoſophers. Let this Comets regular and

ordinate motion (for a month together) neuer deuiating from one right line, keepe you in the way of verity.
            
               
                  2 From the quantity therof. This very reaſon alone many ages agoe perſwaded diuine Seneca, and in our Fathers daies that ingenious and ſubtile Cardane to place all Comets aboue the elementarie regions, wherein only inconſtant and momentany Meteors make their ſickle vagaries.
            The analogie alſo obſerued in the ſtarres betwixt their diſtance from the earth, and their motion about the ſame, doth eleuate this Comet aboue the Lunary regions, his proper motion being ſcarſe at any time the fourth part of hers.
            This argument was ſometimes accounted a firme demonſtration, before that conglomeration of ſolide orbes was with the Aries or engines of Aſtronomicall obſeruations battered and demoliſhed: neither is it yet reiected by thoſe who well deſerue the firſt place in the reſtauration of this celeſtiall Art; for though thoſe Babylonian wals be ruinated, yet is the analogie of motion and diſtance ſtil preſerued.God hath created all things in waight, meaſure and number.

                  3 From infallible demonſtration by parallax. But that abſtruſe &amp; admirable 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , moſt irrefragable and infallible remonſtrance drawn from the parallax doth place this Comet farther beyond the Moone, then ſhe is from the earth, yea many times her apogaeall or greateſt diſtance. But becauſe this huge diſtance may ſeeme ſtrange to many (being as I haue ſhewed contrary to the long receiued opinion of common Philoſophers) and the doctrine of parallax to moſt no leſſe vnknowne, then the word it ſelfe; I will for their better ſatisfaction, with as much breuity and perſpicuity as I can, vnfold obſcure, but ſure argument.
            Parallax (in Aſtronomy) is a commutation or changing of any Planets or Comets true place (pointed out by a line drawne from the Earths center through the Planets, or Comets) into another place appearing to our eye on the ſuperficies of this terreſtriall ſpeculatorie. Or parallax, is the difference of theſe two places.
            This commutation or difference ariſeth from that 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , reaſon, or (to vſe the vulgar tearme, though here vnproper) proportion, which the earths ſemidiameter (or thickneſſe from the center to his ſuperficies) hath to the planets or Comets diſtance from the earth: for if this ſemidiameter hold any ſenſible proportion to the diſtance, it is not poſſible that the eye vpon the earth ſhould ſee the Comet or Planet in the ſame place which it hath in reſpect of the center, but there will be a parallax, commutation, or difference more or leſſe according to the diſtance. So the Moones perigaeal or ſhorteſt diſtance being not much more then fiftie two ſemidiameters of the

earth, fals into a notorious parallax (or difference of her true and apparant place) and that of one degree and 6. minutes, for the proportion of one to fiftie two, or 1/52 part is very ſenſible: but the Sun being remote when he is perigeall, no leſſe then 1100
                  •
                Semidiameters from the earth (by all Aſtronomers conſent) hath very little parallax of 3 m. for the proportion of 1 m. to 1100
                  〈◊〉
                is very little, or nothing: but according to the more accurate &amp; late obſeruations of Keplerus (Mathematician to two Emperors) the Sun being 1800
                  〈◊〉
                Semidiameters of the earth from it, ſhall haue but 2 min: of parallax: But the vpper Planets, Iupiter &amp; Saturne, are ſo exceedingly remote, that the earths ſemidiameter can cauſe in them no parallax at all, much leſſe in the fixed ſtars, which are almoſt infinitely remote from the earth, retaining their mutuall diſtances and ſituations (in what place of the earth ſoeuer they be obſerued) yea from their firſt creation, being ſet by the Almighty, as ſo many markes, whereunto the terreſtriall inhabitants might refer the ſeuen Planets, or any other celeſtiall light, as Comets and new Stars.
            
               
For the better vnderſtanding of this parallacticall diſcourſe, I muſt entreat you to examine this following Diagram.

is equall to the angle, but the 2 being further from the earth, doth from l appeare in b. hauing v, b, leſſe parallax, then the former: but 3 being yet further from the earth, doth from l appeare in c, hauing v, c, but a little parallax.
            
               Parallax greateſt in the Horizon. Any of theſe parallaxes are greateſt when the Planet is in the Horizon, as 1 is, the other being a little aboue: but in the Zenith or Verticall poynt ouer our heads, there can be no parallax at all, for then the line from the Center doth runne into the line from the Superficies, making one line. as you ſee z, l, o. So that the parallax doth from the Horizon vpwards continually decreaſe, and at lengthNothing in the Zenith. vaniſh away in the Zenith.
            
               So much leſſe as the Comet is farther from the earth. By this which hath beene ſayd is manifeſt, that the farther any viſible thing is from the earth, the leſſe parallax it muſt needes haue: but the finding of the parallax is not ſo eaſie; Hic labor, hoc opus eſt: this requires more then ordinary skill in Aſtronomy.
            
               To finde the parallax. There bee two ſpeciall wayes to finde the parallax: The one is by two obſeruations made at one time in two remote places of the earth, for if the Comet doth in both of them appeare in one and the
                  1 By obſeruations in two diuers places at one time ſame place amongſt the fixed ſtarres, then cannot the earths ſemidiameter haue any proportion to the diſtance of the Comet: but if the Comet doth appeare diuerſly amongſt the fixed ſtarres, then hath it parallax more or leſſe according to his diſtance from the earth. In the former Diagram let L be London, R be ſome other remote place, 1 the Comet, which from L will appeare amongſt the fixed ſtarres in A, but

from R it will appeare in V: ſo that the difference is A. V. very much, becauſe 1 is neere the earth: Let there be alſo another Comet 3 which from L will appeare in C, but from R in V, the difference V C very little, becauſe 3 is very farre from the earth. IAt London. haue beene very diligent in obſeruing all the Comets places amongſt the fixed ſtarres, that ſo hereafter comparing them with thoſe which appeared in other countries, the true parallax of this Comet may be knowne, which I dare ſay by this triall will proue
                  2. In one place by two obſeruations in one night. little or none. In the meane time I haue not neglected the ſecond way of finding the parallax, which is by comparing two apparant places of the Comet in one and the ſame night, one place being neere the Horizon, and the other neere the Zenith. For the difference of theſe two places will manifeſt the parallax: where regard muſt be had of the ſtarres proper motion in the interuall of time, which is very eaſie to performe. There be many kindes of obſeruations, by altitudes, declinations, aſcenſions, &amp;c. which are very difficult, and perplexed with diuers ſpecies of parallaxes, beſides refraction. And thereforeAn eaſie and certaine way to finde the parallax. omitting them, I will acquaint you with an eaſie and moſt certaine way to ſearch forth any Comets parallax, &amp; that without error of 5 or 6 mi. which is nothing to 66 mi. of the Moones parallax. This is by obſeruing the Comet a very little ouer or vnder ſome ſtarre neere the Horizon, and afterwards the ſame night neere the Zenith or verticall point. For if the Comet (hauing parallax) neere the Horizon appeare a little vnder the ſtarre, it will towards the Zenith appeare neere, yea (it may be) eclipſe the ſtar,

or be a little aboue him, which is plaine by the Diagram, for the Comet 3 appearing from l in c vnder the ſtarre v will in z the verticall point bee in coniunction with him, and eclipfe him from your ſight. Here the Comet is ſuppoſed to haue no motion, beſides that from the primum mobile: but if hee haue any, as this Comet had, it is eaſie to make allowance for the ſame, eſpecially being ſo little in 5 or 6 houres betwixt the two obſeruations. As for refractionRefraction here no hindrance. neere the Horizon, it cannot bring any incumbrance, for that it doth as well eleuate the Starre, as the Comet.
            
               An obſeruation of the Comets parallax. The night before the third of December, about one houre after midnight, I obſerued the Comet not yet 10. degrees aboue the Horizon, vnder two little ſtarres of the fourth light in the girdle of Arctophylax. The diſtance of theſe ſtarres is but 50. min. which ſerued as a ready and certaine meaſure, wherunto I might compare the diſtance of the Comet from them, for the more perſpicuous diſtinction whereof I vſed the Teleſcopium or Trunke-ſpectacle.
            The Comet appeared from the vppermoſt ſtarre (which was directly in his way) the diſtance of the two ſtars, &amp; moreouer ⅓ part thereof, in all one deg. 6. min. Towards morning, the Comet being mounted 53. degrees aboue the Horizon, the Comet appeared from the ſaid ſtarre a little more then ⅔ of the two ſtars diſtance, about 36 mi: ſo that in 5. houres the Comet was come but 30. minutes neerer to the ſtarre; no more then his proper motion in that time (according to former and following nights obſeruations) required. Wherefore remouing this proper

motion, he would haue appeared at both times a like diſtant from the ſtarre; and therefore had none or little parallax. For ſuppoſe the Comet to haue had as much parallax as the Moone (in her perigaeon) which is (in 10. degrees aboue the Horizon) 65. min. and in 53. deg. of altitude ſcarce 40. m. the difference is 25. m. and ſo much ſhould the Comet by alteration of his parallax haue appeared neerer the ſtarre at the ſecond obſeruation, then at the firſt, to which if you adde his proper motion in the mean ſpace, it will be 55. m. &amp; ſo the Comet ſhould haue been but ⅕ part of the 2 ſtars diſtance from the vpper ſtarre; whereas he was more then ⅔, which is a notorious difference, and could not eſcape the ſight; and therfore had not ſo great parallax as the moone,Found much leſſe than the Moones parallax. and by neceſſary conſequence was aboue her, ▪yea many times her diſtance from the earth, which I might eaſily confirme by the like obſeruation the night following, when the Comet had ouertaken the ſtarre more then a degree; but eſpecially by my obſeruations the nights preceding the 10. 11. and 12. daies, when the Comet was very neere vnto a little ſtarre in the left arme of Arctophylax, at the firſt vnder him and after aboue, and alſo by his diſtance from another obſcure ſtar (which I found by the Teleſcopium 15 mi. aboue the Comet: this little ſtarre I could finde in no globe nor mappe, but onely in the excellent Vranimetria of that diligent and induſtrious Beyerus. By diligent and curious noting the Comets diſtance from theſe ſtarres, firſt neereNot aboue 6. m. the Horizon, and afterwards towards the Zenith in the ſame nights, I dare be bold to conclude that

this Comet had not 6. minutes of parallax (for within theſe limites I may confine the incertaintie of my obſeruations) and therefore more then 600. ſemidiameters of the earth diſtant from it.
            
               Proued alſo from proſpect of the Comets forelocke. How ſtrange ſo euer this may ſeeme, yet is it enforced from moſt certaine demonſtration parallacticall. Which may moreouer be confirmed from the proſpect and irradiation of this Comets forelocke. Which if the head had any notable parallax, muſt of neceſſitie haue twice ſo much, and ſo could not appeare in one line with the Comet, and the Sunne as I haue formerly demonſtrated.
            But leaſt the Reader not acquainted with Mathematicall demonſtrations, ſhould thinke it a nouell poſition, yea 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

engines finde the leaſt parallax, no not of one minute; and therefore iuſtly affirmed them far beyond the Moone: yea, which is moſt remarkable, and cauſed no ſmall admiration, and delight in the Heroicke Lantgraue of Heſſen, as it pleaſed him by letters to ſignifie to Tycho▪ Rothmannus the Lantgraues Mathematician, obſeruing the Comet in 1585. agreed with Tycho in the place thereof to a ſcruple, (at one and the ſame inſtant) and yet the one was remote from the other almoſt 300. Engliſh miles, the diſtance betwixt Caſſels, and Vrani-burge, which punctuall agreement had been impoſſible if the Comet had not beene exceedingly remote beyond the moone. I muſt alſo remember that Albumaſar 1000. yeares almoſt ſince obſerued a Comet aboue the ſpheare of Mercury.
            
            
               This Comet 600. ſemidiameters of the earth from it. Wherefore it is no ſuch ſtrange diſtance from the earth that I aſſigne to this our Comet, 600. ſemidiameters of the earth; which is but ⅓ of the Suns diſtance.

But this Comet was farre aboue the higheſt aſcent of groſſe and ſulphurous exhalations, his quantitie more then could be cauſed by a great part of the earth turned into ſmoake, his motion too regular, and his durance too long for ſuch wandring, and ſoone vaniſhing exhalations.

                The place of this congreſſe is moſt remarkable, amidſt the balance of Libra; which the Comet paſſing through doth withall, as it were from Heauen, proclaime to Prince and people:

            The other is correctiue Iuſtice, an indifferent and equall adminiſtration of right to all.
