            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

                  Epheſ. 1. that the ſpirit of wiſdome and reuelation might be giuen thē, &amp; that the eies of their vnderſtanding might be lightned, &amp;c. And for this cauſe are we to pray with all maner of praier and ſupplication, and with al earneſtnes, that this key of Dauid, of ye true Dauid Ieſus Chriſt might be giuen vs. For if the ſpirit once open no man ſhutteth, but if he ſhut, &amp; ſo long as he ſhutteth no man can oopen; nay as Austen ſaith, though god himſelf ſhould appeare vnto vs in ſome likenes of man, and ſpeak vnto vs, yet if he do not moue vs, &amp; direct vs by his inward grace (the grace of his ſpirit) he ſhould do vs no good at al with al his preaching.

                     . dei. cap. 6. Therfore I ſay (deare brother) begin here, make praier for Gods enlightning ſpirite the firſt ſtaffe of thy ladder, and the firſt ſtone of thy building. Pray for the ſame early and late, and doubt not but it ſhalbe giuē the. For if we that be euil can giue good gifts vnto our children, how much more ſhall our heauenly father giue the holy Ghoſt to them that deſire him?
                  Luc. 11.13. This promiſe is made by Chriſt himſelfe, and by no worſe perſon, and therfore as he that beleeueth it, hath ſealed that God is true▪ 
               Ioh. 3.33. ſo he that beleeueth it not, yea or doubteth of it, ſaying, who ſhall aſcend into heauen and fetch me the ſpirit, the ſame man maketh Chriſt a liar, and ſo diſhonoreth the ſonne, and the father to. This may ſuffice concerning the principal help for the vnderſtanding of the Scriptures. Now beſides this there are certaine inferior helps and means, which though they be not as effectual as the former, for God forbid we ſhould make any compariſon betweene the power of God and the weaknes of man, yet they be moſt neceſſarie and no way to be neglected. Nay this is true, that if we ſhould do nothing but pray, as did the Meſſalians of old, or hold open our mouthes (as it were) &amp; gape after extraordinary inſpirations as certaine Enthuſiaſts do to this day, we ſhould do no leſſe then tempt God (like to them that will take no paines with their ground, and yet looke for a good crop) and ſo in ſtead of bleſſing, wee ſhould reape a curſe. Therfore though we muſt begin with praier, yet we may not be content with praier, but we muſt ioine to it, firſt a diligent hearkning to our paſtors &amp; teachers, like as the Iſraelites

Num. 13. which were ſo ſtrong &amp; ſo walled that they made the children of Iſrael quake to thinke of them, and for dāger as perillous in a maner to be medled with as the tree of the knowledge of good and euill, which brought preſent death to thē that touched it: No, for then they would not haue turned &amp; toſſed the bible ſo as they did, but they would haue beene as ſoone wearie of it,1. Sam. 5. as the men of Ekron were of the Arke of god. 1. Sam. 5. But partly in reſpect of their duty, wherby they were bound not onely not to deſpiſe, but euen to vſe the gift that was in others; knowing that whether it were Paul,

Theſe and the like reaſons moued them (to haue a reſpect to the direction of thoſe writers, but not to captiuate their ſenſes to it) which becauſe they ſtill do remaine, yea and will to the end of the world, therefore the commentaries of the learned for the more eaſie vnderſtanding of the ſcripture are alwayes neceſſarie.

               , that a man may ſay of them as Moſes ſayd of thoſe that offered for the furniſhing of the Tabernacle,
                  Exod. 36. 
               Exod. 36. The people bring too much and more then inough for the vſe of the worke that the Lord hath commanded to be made. Indeed vnneath a mans life will ſuffice to reade the bookes that are written alreadie vppon the ſcriptures in the three chiefe tongues, but yet for them that are ignorant of the tongues, there is not as yet (to borrow a fewe of Moſes words) an helper found out meete for them. I grant the notes that we haue vpon our Engliſh bibles are moſt ſound and profitable; but they want application for the moſt part, (howe could it be choſen? except the volume ſhould haue beene made not portable) the commentaries alſo vpon diuerſe parts of the Scripture tranſlated into our mother tongue (for I haue not ſeene many of our mens making; others haue laboured for vs, and we haue entred into their labours) they are right worthie and moſt woorth the reading, but yet for the more learned and zealous ſort of the common people,
                  Iohn 4.38. not for them that were lately weaned from the breſt, and muſt be tolled on by a little at once, and by a ſmall price alſo. Therfore when I vnderſtoode that God had put into the heart of this Reuerend &amp; excellent builder (the Author of theſe notes) to employ his talent this way alſo, namely by writing vppon the Scripture to profite the common people, I reioyced greatly and was full of comfort, not onely becauſe of his learning and ſufficiencie (being knowne to bee a workeman that needeth not to be aſhamed) but alſo for his wiſe diſcretions ſake, for that he knoweth howe to abound, and how to be ſparing, and ſo to handle the matter, that they for whom it was prouided might be moſt benefited. For this I ſay, I reioyced (like as the Iſraelites when they found the well Num. 21. they made a ſong in the praiſe of it) yea I confeſſe I exhorted him to goe forward with this intendment of his,
                  Num. 21.17. though he ſhould omitte many of his ſermons &amp; lectures. For I conſidered that though a mans liuely voice moueth more, yet a mans writing teacheth more: more throughly, becauſe it giueth a man leaue to conſider of it, and doth not ſtrike his eares onely, and then away, (for which cauſe wordes are ſaide by the wiſe Poet to haue

               ) more generally, becauſe it reacheth not onely to them that are neere, but alſo to them that are farre off, not onely to them that are aliue, but alſo to them that are yet vnborne. In deede ſo it is, he that ſpeaketh profiteth his owne congregation, but he that writeth profiteth all: he that ſpeaketh profiteth for an houre; and he that writeth profiteth for euer. Therefore I ſay, I perſwaded him to redeeme this power of dooing more good, whatſoeuer it ſhoulde coſt him, or rather whatſoeuer it ſhoulde coſt vs by wanting his reading. But nowe when I perceyued for all this talke, and the like, hee was alwayes the ſame man for aſſiduitie in preaching, euen as the children of Iſrael ſhronke not downe vnder their labour, howſoeuer it were increaſed, then I gaue glorie vnto God, ſaying,
                  Exod. 1. Surely the Lord hath done great things for him, yea the Lorde doth great things for the people ouer whom he placeth him. For who is able to ſpeake oftner? who is able to doe more good? Of ſuch as are painfull, being moſt readie, of ſuch as are readie being moſt painefull, of ſuch as are pithie being moſt familiar, of ſuch as are familiar being moſt pithie: learned without oſtentation, ſweete without gloſing, zealous without newfangling, beloued and louing againe, mouing and moued himſelfe, comfortable and comforted himſelfe. I do not giue him halfe his dew, as they know that know him, and yet happily more then euerie one that knoweth vs both doth thinke fit to proceede out of my mouth, I being ſo linked to him as I am.

Truly (gentle Reader) though I cannot doe thee good by my ſelfe, yet whatſoeuer fauour or credit I may ſeeme to be in with him, the ſame I will gladly employ for thy ſake vnto that end; namely I wil be to him (as Socrates ſayth he was to the Athenians) a ſpurre or a ſtinger to pricke him forwarde, or rather (to ſpeake as Iſay ſpeaketh) I will be his remembrancer, and giue him no reſt vntill hee haue gone through the bookes of Moſes, at the leaſt. This, if God giue him life ſo long, and if in the meane time ſome come not in to his helpe, as Aaron and Hur helped Moſes when hee was wearie with holding vp his handes, or as Peters partners helped him, Luke 6. when his net was torne. Farewell (good Reader) and doe thou alſo bleſſe and loue this man, who for thy ſake doth thus debaſe himſelfe (becauſe he would not exceede thy capacitie be thou neuer ſo ſimple) whereas he could otherwiſe get himſelfe a great name like the great men of the earth, by writing for the reach of the better learned: againe farewell.

               Opera Trinitatis quoad extra ſunt indiuiſa &amp; communia, with many ſuch teſtimonies. In this very place that we now looke vpon, the Hebrue word for God is of the plurall number, to note (as ſome thinke) the pluralitie of perſons, &amp; the verbe created, of the ſingular number, to note the vnity of deitie in them all. And verſ. 26. it is ſaid, Come let vs make man, noting the three perſons all ioynt creators together, and cannot be vnderſtood of Angels, as ſpoken to them, becauſe man was not created according to the Image of Angels, but of God. Now if any ſhould doubt how the firſt article of our beleefe agreeth with this which attributeth the creation to God the Father, it may be anſwered that it is not ſo doone there, to the ende to exclude eyther Sonne or Holy-ghoſt, but onely to ſhew the order and manner of the creation, and other workes of God: for as the father is the fountaine of the Godhead, and yet not therefore either Sonne or Holy-ghoſt excluded from the ſame, but each of them God, &amp; equall with the Father as touching the Godhead: ſo rightly is the Father made author of creation, and yet neither Sonne nor Holy-ghoſt idle in the ſame. But 
                  〈…〉
                that by a certaine order the 
                  〈…〉
               
               
firſt in order, willeth it as it was, the whole fabrick and courſe of things created. Then he expreſſeth this will by his Sonne, in whom as the Image of his Father, the decree and order of all 
                  •
               he worke ſhined:
                  Colo. 1.15.
                he ſpake and they were made and diſtinguiſhed in theyr orders. Thirdly the Holy-ghoſt together with them both, worketh alſo immediatly, cheriſhing and nouriſhing what was created, and giuing motion vnto them. Thus was there an order in the worke, and yet all three perſons ioyntly creators of all together. This marked and remembred, both anſwereth the doubt now in ſpeeche touching our beleefe, and many other places of Scripture alſo, wherein the creation is aſcribed in ſhew of words but to one perſon. Iohn ſaith, All things were made by the ſonne. Paule ſaith, Yet vnto vs there is but one God,

               which is the Father of whom are all things. And in the ſame verſe he ſaith of Chriſt, that By him are all things, and ſuch like Auſten ſaith Filius non agit a ſe, ſed per ſe. The Sonne dooth not of himſelfe, but by himſelfe. All which ſpeeches and theyr like eyther in Scripture or Fathers, note an order among the perſons in their worke, but exclude none from the ſame.
                  Note.
                For as we ſaye the Fire ſhyneth by the light which commeth from the ſame, and yet we make not that light any ſeruile inſtrument off or to the ſame fire, but euen his naturall force and power: So is the Father ſayde to doo whatſoeuer hee dooth by the Sonne, and yet not as by any vnder inſtrument and inferiour meanes, as wickedlye the Arians would conclude, but as by his ſubſtantiall power and vertue. And againe, as wee ſaye the fyre ſhyneth, and the light of the fyre alſo ſhyneth: ſo all which the Father dooth, the Sonne alſo dooth. Thus much of this poynte.
            
               2 What was created. Heauen and earth,

                ſay theſe words of Moſes heere: And Heauen and Earth and Sea, and all things that are in them, ſay the Apoſtles in an other place.
                  Acts. 4.24.
                But that the generalitie bee not miſtaken, you muſt remember that needefull limitation which the Apoſtle addeth when hee ſayth, All things that were made. By him all things were made, and without him was made nothing, That was made,
               
                  Iohn. 1.3.
               
               
By which clauſe is made a plaine diſtinction of things created, from things vncreated. Nazianzene &amp; Epiphanius, with other of the old writers, rightly concluded vpon it againſt the Arians, that as the Father was not made nor created, ſo neither Sonne nor holy Ghoſt were. But eſpecially this clauſe diſcerneth and diſtinguiſheth the workes of God and good creatures, from ſinne and death, and ſuch like, which were not things made, but came otherwiſe, not things poſitiuely, as I may ſpeake of themſelues, but a priuation, deſtruction, and horrible deprauation of the order firſt made by God.
                  Iohn. 8.
                Thus teacheth Iohn when he maketh Satan the author of lyes, and ſaith then he ſpeaketh of his owne. Againe when he ſaith,
                  1. Epiſt. 2.
                the concupiſcence of the fleſh is not of the Father, but of the world:
                  3.8.
                and in the next Chapter, He that committeth ſinne is of the Deuill, for the Deuill ſinneth from the beginning. And as for death, By ſinne came death, ſaith the Apoſtle, and the rewarde of ſinne is death, &amp;c. When it is ſayd therefore that God made all things, remember to adde this, all things that were made, as S. Iohn dooth, and ſo ſhall you exclude from the worke of God, all ſinne, death, deformitie, confuſion, tyranny, calamitie, and ſuch like, which being neuer made by God, are crept in by Satans malice and mans corruption, as breaches and blots of Gods order.
            
               3 When? In the beginning ſaith Moſes heere, and much a doo haue curious heads made about theſe words. But if we haue that reuerent feare in vs, that all men ought to haue toward the word of God, they are plaine inough: for if he had ſaid in the end, God created heauen and earth, would we not ſtreight haue conceiued, that hee created them laſt, to wit, in the worke of the ſixte day? And why ſhould we not as eaſily conceiue him, when he ſaith in the beginning to meane nothing, but firſt of all, to wit, the firſt day, and ſo leaue all vngodly quirkes to a vaine heart, that ſhall weepe for ſuch wickednes one daye? In principio, ſay the beſt interpreters, that is, Certo ac definito tempore, atque adeò in principio temporum, non ab aeterno. In the beginning,
                that is in a certaine and definite time, and euen in the beginning of time not from euerlaſting. In principio, ſcilicet creandi. In the beginning,
                to

wit, of creating 
                  •
               aith very rightly: Abben Hezra, God created heauen and earth. And let theſe graue lights of graue and learned men ſway more with vs then a thouſand ſubtilties, which as Syrach ſpeaketh, are fine ſubtilties, but vnrighteous. This creation of it in the beginning,
                  Syra. 19.24
                conuinceth the falſhood that it is eternall. So do many things mo beſide this, and namely that computation which is generally receiued of all men of the yeares which it hath indured, and which be now paſt ſince the creation. But neuertheleſſe on go ſome with their blinde concepts, and would prooue the contrary. For firſt ſay they,
                  The 1. are▪ againſt the creation of the world.
                if we grant the world had a beginning, then was God idle euer before, but that is abſurd, therefore it was not created, but was eternall. We may anſwer them firſt, that the rule which they harpe vpon in this argument, namely that Perfectiſsima cauſa non eſt otioſa: the moſt perfect cauſe is not idle, Non eſt vera dea gentibus voluntariis, is not true of ſuch things as worke by will, or willingly, as the moſt excellent Carpenter may forbeare his worke and action a time. If they thinke that God was alone, therein they ſhew themſelues carnall and ſpeake carnally. For how ſhould he be alone more then, then now, vnto whome all things are preſent, though they be future, and things that are not as if they were. Hierom vpon this occaſion citeth that ſaying of Scipio. Nunquam minus ſolus qùam cum maxime ſolus.
                Neuer leſſe alone then when I am moſt alone. And cannot this be true much more of God, that he is not alone without theſe creatures which he made. Could he ſay it when his countrey was loſt, his wife and children, freends and louers, that yet all his good was with him, and cannot the Lord ſay it much more, that his good ſtandeth not in the preſence of creatures, but before euer they were, and now that they are, yet all his is with him without them? Chriſt ſayth, hee is not alone,
               
                  Iohn. 8.29.
                not in reſpect of any company of man or creature, but in reſpect of his Father whome he ſaith to bee with him. Nowe ſhall Chriſt not bee alone in reſpecte of hys diuine coniunction with hys Father, and ſhall it not be alike with the Father in regard of his ſonne, and with the holy Ghoſt in regard of them both, and with eache of them in reſpect of others. Surely that inſeperable vnitie of the Trinitie denyeth to euery perſon a poſſibilitie to be alone.

And that inſearchable myſterie of the fruition of his owne glorye, is other manner of company (if I may ſo ſpeake) then all the creatures of this world can yeeld him.
            O but yet ſay they, what did God euer before. Verely ſaith Auſten, he made Hell for ſuch buſie braines &amp; vnreformed harts and toongs, that will ſo curiouſly enter into Gods ſecrets. How much better would the words of the modeſt and godly Apoſtle become them.
                  Rom. 11.34
                
               O the deepenes of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God: howe vnſearchable are his iudgements and his wayes paſt finding out, who hath knowne the minde of the Lord, or who was his counſell
                     •
                  r, &amp;c.
            
            Secondly they reaſon thus. The moouer &amp; the thing mooued, be relatiues, and the one ſuppoſeth the other. But God the moouer was euer, therefore the thing mooued, to wit the world. But we anſwer them to this alſo truly, that if there be a moouer actually, then there muſt needes alſo be a thing mooued. But God though he were from euerlaſting himſelfe, yet did he not actually mooue in reſpect of theſe outward creatures, which are without his eſſence, but onely was Mouens potentia. It is farre differing therefore to ſpeake of one as was ſaid before, that worketh by wil and freely, &amp; to ſpeake of a thing that worketh naturally, &amp; it is no abſurditie to ſay, yt the relation betwixt the firſt cauſe &amp; the world made, began in time, ſince the creation of the world is an outward action of God, &amp; voluntary. The very ſame anſwer may be made vnto the rule, whē the cauſe is, the effect is, the cauſe eternal, therfore the effect, to wit, ye world. For this holdeth in natural things alſo, that worke naturally &amp; neceſſarily, but not in things ye worke freely &amp; willingly, as God did in creating. Otherwiſe euery houſe muſt be as ancient as the Carpenter that made it. No the relatiō ther betwixt ye cauſe &amp; the effect, beginneth in time after, becauſe he is a voluntary cauſe, &amp; ſo is it with God. Silly then &amp; ſlack are theſe concluſions you euidently ſee, and far from demonſtrations.
            Thirdly they reaſon thus. That which hath no alteration, is not ſubiect to generation or corruption: The heauen hath no alterations for thus many thouſand yeares none haue beene obſerued. Therefore it is not ſubiect to generation to be made, or corruption, to ceaſe to be. Therefore it is eternall. We aunſwer,

that all though it might be truly ſayde, that many partes of the world are ſubiect to alteratiōs, as the aire, the water, the earth, &amp;c, and conſequently the whole not perpetuall, whoſe parts be alterable. Yet with diuinitie we rather ſay, that Generatio phyſica, naturall generation and creation be two things, and differ much: ſo do Corruptio phyſica, naturall corruption and violent deſtruction, which a renuing ſhal follow. Therefore although neither generation nor corruption can be without alteration, yet things may be created that haue no alterations, as Angels, ſtars, ſoules. And by diuine power celeſtiall bodies may be deſtroyed, or at leaſt changed and renued according to the ſaying: Heauen and earth ſhall paſſe, and againe: They all ſhall waxe old as doth a garment, &amp;c. Behold I create a new heauen, and new earth, and with ſuch like. For the argument then it may be granted, that albeit the world was not Genitus, generated, as I may ſay, yet it was created by God of nothing, and ſo their purpoſe faileth for all this cauill alſo.
            Fourthly they ſay, Time is eternall, therefore motus, moouing: for time is the meaſure of moouing: &amp; if motion, then a thing moued, to wit, the world, &amp;c. For anſwer wherevnto, firſt the conſequence may be denyed: for time is not onely taken as philoſophy taketh it, for meaſure of moouing, according to firſt and later. But ſometime it is put ſimply and abſolutely for the continuance of a thing, though it be not the meaſure of the motion of the ſame. So may we call eternitie, and that infinite continuance, that I may ſo ſpeake of God, who hath bin from euerlaſting. But this is improperly, for indeed the maner that hath taken place in ſchooles, is to call time the meaſure of mouing. Now Ariſtotle not able by naturall wit, to ſee rightly what difference was betwixt time &amp; eternitie, or what maner of continuance eternitie was, iudged time to be eternall, becauſe he ſaw an eternitie of a moouer: which is not ſo, for there may be a mouer eternall, to wit, God, albeit no motus corporis mobilis: for God is not corpus mobile, as the parts of the world are, &amp; as philoſophie meaneth. Now Tempus eſt menſura motus corporis mobilis non dei, according to Philoſophy. Secondly touching the antecedent, that time is eternall, it may truly alſo be denyed. And for that which is vſually brought to prooue it, that it began with the firſt moouer in ſome moment or poynte

of time, which point being a coniunction of paſſed and future, preſuppoſeth a point paſſed, and ſo an other infinitely: it may be anſwered that euery point of time is not a continuer &amp; ioiner of paſſed and future, but it is alſo ſometime 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , amending of time, whether it be at the beginning or ending, for as for example, the point in the line is not euer a continuer of the ſame line, ioyning that which followeth after, to that which went before, but alſo a certaine thing both beginning and ending the line: So in time, there is Nunc initians, a beginning, and an inſtant, or a preſent that beginneth with the thing, as when the world tooke his beginning, then began alſo ſuch an inſtant or preſent, there is alſo Nunc continuans, a continuing pointe, which is properly called time, becauſe Tempus est fluxio à priori ad poſterius, a going from the firſt to the later, and at laſt there ſhall be Nunc terminans, an ending point, to wit, the end of the world now thus created, moouing and b
                  •
               ing. Nothing therefore helpeth this argument, to prooue an eternitie of the world, more then the reſt did. Many mo might be alleadged to this purpoſe, but no better then theſe, and I iudge neither theſe nor them very pleaſant to ſuch as I ſpecially labour to profit, becauſe they conceiue not ſuch conſequences. Wherefore I cut them off, and this onely I commend vnto you to be thought of. It is impoſſible euen by the Philoſophers owne rules that there ſhould be mo infinites then one. Now God is one infinite, therefore nothing els in heauen or earth beſide. But whatſoeuer is elſe it had a beginning, and many things ſhall haue an ending alſo. The reſt by his power ſhall haue an eternitie giuen them to continue not of themſelues.
            
               4 How did God create all things? Not by or with any labour,
                  Pſal. 33. Rom. 4.17.
                but by his word: for He ſpake the word (ſaith the Pſalme) and they were made, he commanded and they were created. Liberrime ſine vlla coactione, nō neceſſitate abſoluta, ſed neceſſitate cōſequentiae, nempe ſuae volūtatis.
                Freely without any cōſtraint, not by an abſolute neceſſitie, but by a neceſſitie of conſequence, to wit, of his owne good wil. Solo nutu ſine vlla mutatione aut fatigatione. Onely with his beck without any change or wearines in h

               5 Whereof? Not of his eſſence, neither of any former matter coeternall with himſelfe, but of nothing: for if by him all things were made, ſurely beſide him nothing is excepted from making, no not that firſt matter wherevpon all things were made. But you will ſay man was made of the duſt of the earth, fiſhes and fowles of the water, woman of man, and then how were all things made of nothing? Damaſcene anſwereth, Deus fecit omnia ex nihilo, alia quidem immediate, alia mediate.
               
                  Lib. 2. ca. 5.
                God made all things of nothing, but ſome immediatly, others mediatly. His meaning is, that God made firſt of nothing a matter, a firſt matter whereof he made all other things. Now that firſt matter is made of nothing immediatly, but the reſt that were formed of that matter were formed of nothing mediatly, becauſe they were made of that which was made of nothing, and ſo ſecondarily or mediatly as I ſay then of nothing. But then you will ſay againe, Ex nihilo nihil fit, Of nothing nothing is made. And I anſwere you, that ſo it is in the order of nature, now ſet and eſtabliſhed of God, but in God himſelfe this principle holdeth not. Or if you will thus. By man this is impoſſible, to wit, to make any thing of nothing, but with God all things are poſſible, and want of matter letteth not him. It is our comfort that he could and can ſo do: for thereby we know his great abilitie to preſerue what ſo wonderfully he hath made, as alſo to confound and turne to nothing all ſubtile and malitious practiſes againſt his children.
            
               6 To what end? To the prayſe of his glory, ſayth the Apoſtle, for in him, and by him, and for him are all things,
               
                  Prou. 16.1. Pſa. 103.22 Rom. 11.36
                and this is the generall end. Beſide which there be alſo ſpeciall ends and ſubordinate ends vnder them againe, as the manifeſtation, the acknowledging and contemplation of his heauenly and diuine wiſedome and goodnes which appeareth in the Creation. For if the Lord would be celebrated, then muſt he create things to acknowledge him, and to celebrate and prayſe his name beeing knowne and manifeſted. Therefore he created things reaſonable and vnreaſonable, that they might prayſe him, and be matter of his glory. The heauens declare the glory of God, and the fyrmament ſheweth his handy worke. Agayne,
                  Pſal. 19.1.
                the gouernment of

the world a ſubordinate end to that againe. For therefore created he the world, that he might gouerne it with his prouidence, and preſerue it, and ſo might euer declare his wonderfull workes which he hath done from the beginning of the world, or now doth, or yet ſhall do, eſpecially that he might gouerne his Church of elect angells and men.
                  Eſai. 40.26.
                
               Lift vp your eyes (ſayeth the Prophet therefore) and ſee who hath created theſe things. Thirdly and laſtly,
                  Gen. 1.28. Pſal. 8.7. 1. Cor. 3.22
                that all other things might ſerue to the health of body and ſoule, to the life, pleaſure, and neceſſitie of man, and eſpecially to the good of his choſen, being vnto them as it were meanes and miniſters whereby God doing them good, might be honored and prayſed of them. Onely man he created for himſelfe, and all the reſt for man.
            Now if any with the Manichees enquire wherefore many things were made whereof they knowe no vſe to man, eyther of things in the ſea or land, let them conſider what S. Auſten aunſwereth: namely, that herein they ſhould rather adore the riches of Gods power and goodnes, not only in creating, but alſo in preſeruing ſuch a multitude of things as he hath created, &amp; ſay with ye prophet Dauid, O Lord how manifold are thy works, in wiſdome haſt thou made them all,
               
                  Pſal. 104.24.31.
                
               the earth is full of his goodnes. Glory be to the Lord for euer: let the Lord reioyſe in his workes. Though we know not the vſe of them, yet his wiſedome doth, and that ſhould content vs. Sure we ought to bee that hee made nothing in vayne, and it is ſayd of them all that they were good.
            
            
               
                  Hurtfull beaſts and ſuch like why created.
               Yea but what may be ſayde for ſo many hurtfull beaſts and creatures as be in the worlde vppon lande, or in Sea? Why did God create them? Surely it was enough for aunſwere heerevnto that was ſayde before, that though wee knowe not by and by the good of a creature, yet therefore God may not be condemned for creating them, for hee may do with his owne as pleaſeth him. Yet neuertheleſſe we may further ſay as ſome do, that if man had not ſinned, no creature had been hurtfull to him, and therefore now his fault to be blamed, not Gods creation. Lactantius aunſwereth, that in great wiſedome God hath made aſwell hurtfull things as others,
                  De ira dei. cap. 13.
                that by contraryes, a fuller

knowledge might growe in man to the prayſe of God that hath done all ſo well. And this true aunſwere daſheth that greate thunderbolt as hee thinketh, of the Epicure, made to ouerthrowe Gods prouidence and care to gouerne the worlde, and maketh it ſeeme more fooliſh then fearefull. God (ſayth hee) eyther will take away all hurtfull things and can not, or can and will not, or neyther can nor will, or both can and will. If hee woulde and can not, then wanteth hee power, and is not God: if hee can and will not, then is hee enuiouſe, and is not God: if hee neyther can nor will, then both enuiouſe and weake, and ſo no God: if hee both can and will, then how do they yet remayne. This goodly argument is eaſely aunſwered, by ſaying, hee can and will not, and yet not enuiouſe therein, but good and carefull for man, that he might by ſight of contrary euill better diſcerne the good, and ſo profit thereby both in wiſedome and thankefulneſſe to the Lorde. Lactantius whoſe Chapter is very worthy reading.
            
               7 And laſtly, in what time, or how many dayes did God create all things, in ſixe dayes ſayth the Scripture, and euery day ſome thing ſayth this place, till the ſeuenth day, wherein hee reſted. Non vno momento, ſed ſex dierum ſpatio, not in one moment, but in ſixe dayes ſpace. If you happely thinke or meete with Syrach his wordes, who ſayth, Hee that liueth made all things together, the Lord who only is iuſt &amp;c. You muſt conſider, that he ſpeaketh not of the time, but of the multitude of creatures. Meaning that God made them all together before he reſted, and gaue ouer creating, but not meaning that hee made them all in one moment of time, or in one day, for we ſee both this place and others againſt it: the Lords owne commaundement written with his owne finger giueth teſtimonie, that in ſixe dayes the whole was made. Thus are we inſtructed in all theſe ſeuen points that I named in the beginning: to wit, who created, what was created, when, how, whereof, to what end, and in how many dayes, or what time.
            Now touching the vſe, this further.
                  How the creation profiteth vs to the knowing of God.
                What may be knowne of God ſayth the Apoſtle, is manifeſt in theſe creatures, for God hath ſhewed it vnto them: for ye inuiſible things of him, that is, his

eternall power and Godhead are ſeene by the creation of the world, &amp;c. The quantitie, qualities, courſe, and perpetuities of things created, how do they ſhew God, ſurely ſayth the Prophet the heauens declare the glory of God, and the fyrmament ſheweth his handy worke.
               
                  Pſal. 19.
                Agayne the ſame Prophet teacheth the like, when he goeth from this creation to the viewe and thought of Gods wonderfull and great loue to mankinde, ſaying: When I beholde thy heauens, euen the worke of thy fyngers, the Moone and the Starres which thou haſt ordayned,
               
                  Pſal. 8.3.
                
               O what is man Lord thinke I then, &amp;c. Reade the whole Pſalme.
            Concerning other things to be obſerued in this Chapter, ſome ſay, how could Moſes write of theſe things that were done ſo long before he was borne?
                  How Moſes could write of theſe ſo long before him done.
                ſurely not by any wiſedome and learning of Aegypt wherein yet he was moſt excellent, but by that holy ſpirit of God, whereby he had receyued to be a faithfull Miniſter in the houſe of God, being in this aboue all Prophets, that he was inabled not only to gouerne things preſent, and foretell things future, but thus notably to lay downe things paſſed from the beginning of the world.
                  Act. 7.22.
               
            
            Touching thoſe waters aboue the fyrmament, well ſayde Beda in his time,
                  Verſ. 7.
                  
                what manner of waters they be, and for what purpoſe ordayned,
                  Waters aboue the fyrmament to what vſe.
                he knoweth that made them: thereby geuing vs to learne, what modeſtie becommeth vs in ſpeaking of the ſecrets of God. The ſame power that is able to vpholde all the frame of this world without any earthy prop, is able to holde thoſe waters there in their place, to that ende that his wiſedome hath ordayned them for, and this ſhould content vs.
            Becauſe it is ſayd, Let the lights be for ſignes &amp;c. therefore Aſtrologers catch as though their vnlawfull dealings ſhoulde therein be warranted.
                  Verſ. 14.
                  
                
               
                  Aſtrology not warranted.
                But let them conferre Eſay 44. verſ. 22. &amp; Ierem. 10. verſ. 2. with this, and then it will appeare that herein the Lord meant not to warrant what there he miſliketh.
                  Eſay 47.12 Eccleſ. 7.2.8. Chap. Eſai. 41.22. Pſa. 104.19
                But that theſe words are to be taken in things naturall and politicall, as ſignes of day and night, Sommer, and Winter, &amp;c. For if the Starres inclined men vnto euill, how ſhould it be ſaid, that God ſaw them to be good whē he had made thē, nay, how ſhould it not

redound euen to the touch of the creator thus farre that he is author of euill. But that be farre from vs to ſay and therefore, let God be good, and his ſtars good, and their art wicked and naught, Let Auſten ſpeake for all that I could name vnto you.

            What it is for man to be created according to the Image and ſimilitude of God. The Apoſtle Paul teacheth,

            Man is appointed heere his foode of God that he ſhould eate, and ſome mooue the queſtion how that ſhall be.
                  How doth God appoint man foode before his fall.
                For if man were created immortall if he ſinned not, what needed he any meate to be appointed for him, ſince yet he had not ſinned. Anſwer is made by ſome, that there be two kindes of Immortall, one that cannot die but euer liue, an other that may liue for euer, a condition being obſerued, and die alſo if that condition be broken. One immortall after the firſt ſort needeth no meate, but he that is immortall after the ſecond ſort dooth neede, and ſuch was Adam: if he had not ſinned he had not dyed, but ſinning he was ſo made. that he might die, and therfore his fleſh and nature not ſuch that could liue without meate. Others anſwer that this appointment of meate was made by God in reſpect of their fall, which he knew would be. Howſoeuer it was, curioſitie becommeth vs not: but this comfort we may rightly take by it, that what the Lord hath made, he will maintaine and nouriſh, and caſteth for them his prouidence euer to that end, euen as the Prophet ſayth, Caſt thy care vpon the Lord and he ſhall nouriſh thee vp. He is our father and knoweth what we haue need of. He careth for vs, as ſaith S. Peter. Againe in that he ſaith, Ego ded

thoſe gifts and bleſſings come, ſurely euen from hence, I haue geuen them, and therefore thankefulnes due, and moſt due to ſo good a God and carefull Father.
            That it is ſayde, when all was made the Lord ſawe, and all was good,
                  Verſ. 31.
                  
                yea, exceeding good, the lyke hauing been teſtified alſo particularly, it may admoniſh vs as neere as euer we ſhall obtayne ſtrength,
                  Folow God in doing all well.
                to indeuour to be lyke our heauenly Father, in doing nothing but what may receyue in his mercy ſuch teſtimony that it is good, for great is the comfort of that, and more then great the diſcomfort of the contrary.
            The making of all things before man, ſheweth Gods woonderfull mercy and loue to man,
                  Gods loue prouideth all readie for man before hee is made.
                who would as it were prepare euery thing for his vſe and comfort before he would haue him bee in the world. Not vnlike to a man heere amongſt vs, that louing the friend whome he intendeth to haue with him, and to come vnto him, ere euer he will haue him come, maketh all things ready that may be either for pleaſure or neceſſity to him, &amp; then ſendeth for him to come, all things beeing ready. O what is man, frayle man, wretched and miſerable man, that God ſhould thus regard him, may we well ſay with the Prophet, yet thus it was. And ſhall that God that thus prepared for man ere euer he was, now forſake man when he is, if he be not moſt vnkindly and too vnkindly forſaken of man? it cannot be, it cannot be, and therefore in all diſtreſſes caſt your eyes vpon him, and thinke of ſuch teſtimonies of his loue as this was, and be ſure that he knowing what you haue neede of, will neuer forſake you.
            When the Angells were created, it is not preciſely named, but that they were created,
                  Creation of Angells.
                both by this place it is knowne, and Coloſſ. 1.16. by Iude alſo and Peter: the vſuall opinion is, the firſt day, reade Iunius. And this of this Chapter briefely.
         
         
            
            Chap. 2. 
            
               The generall heads of this Chapter are three.

                     The inſtitution of the Sabboth.
                     A repetition of ſome things concerning Creation.
                     The inſtitution of Mariage.
                  
               
            
            
               COncerning the firſt, it is ſayde,
                  Verſe. 2.
                  
                GOD reſted the ſeuenth day, and thereupon conſecrated it holie to his Church for euer: which reſt of the Lord muſt be vnderſtood from creating,
                  How God reſteth.
                not from preſeruing, and from creating, to weet, of any new kinde, for otherwiſe dayly he createth the ſoules of men, and diſpoſeth them to their bodyes.
                  How the Father yet worketh &amp;c.
                If any queſtion bee made of briers, brembles, and ſuch like, not created at firſt, but ſpringing vp ſince, anſwere may be made, that theſe, and many other things appertayne to corruption, and heere mention is made only of perfection. Theſe things haue proceded from God puniſhing, and the ſixe dayes works from God not offended.
            
               2 This Sabboth begun thus by the Lords owne example, after it pleaſed him by a law to ratifie, Exod. 20. it was called The Sabboth of dayes, becauſe it was euery ſeuenth daye. Beſide which,
                  Diuers Sabboths.
                the Iewes had a Sabboth of yeares euery ſeuenth yeare, Exod. 23. Leuit. 25. and ſeuen times ſeuen yeares made 49. the next yeare after being euer the Iubile, to weet, euery 50. yeare: Then was the Sabbatum magnum, the great Sabboth, when the Paſſouer fell vpon the Sabboth, as it did that yeare that Chriſt ſuffered, Iohn 19.
            
            3 That moſt ſtrict and preciſe reſt ſpecified in the lawe from all worke, from roſting of meate, gathering of ſtickes, Exodus 16.29.35.3. and Number. 15. from any long iourney, and ſuch lyke, were Ceremoniall, and therefore with other

the Ceremonies of the law are abrogated by Chriſt, there remayning to man now a further freedome, and yet without breach of the Sabboth, as I pray you reade in my treatiſe vpon that commaundement at large. The daye alſo of the Iewes Sabboth was changed from the Saterday to the Sonday by the Apoſtles thē
               ſelues, Act. 20.7. 1. Cor. 16.2.
            
            4 The ende and vſes of this Sabboth alſo you may there more at large ſee,
                  Ends of the Sabboth.
                to wit:

                  For order in the Church of God, that we might meete together, and none be freed from ſeruing God at leaſt one day in ſeauen.
                  For the reliefe of ſeruants and brute beaſts, which by pitileſſe worldlings might elſe be abuſed.
                  And laſtly to reſemble, and ſtill to remember vs of our eternall reſt in heauen, to be cared for now, and enioyed then when this life is ended, Eſay 58.13.
                  
               
            
            The exerciſes alſo of this Sabboth you may there reade, to weet,
                  Exerciſes.
                preaching, praying, reading, ſinging, conferring, mutuall admoniſhing, viſiting the ſick, poore, priſoners, with many ſuch like.
            Touching the repetion of things concerning creation, verſ. 4. and 5. it is ſaid, that God had not yet cauſed it to rayne: therein aſcribing it to the Lord as his peculiar power to open and ſhut the heauens,
                  Rayne, the gift of God.
                and to ſend drought or rayne, according to his good pleaſure. And in deede ſo it is very often repeated in the Scriptures, that we might duly confeſſe it, and thankfully euer conſider it. I will ſend you rayne (ſayth the Lord) in due ſeaſon▪ and the earth ſhall yeeld her increaſe,
               
                  Leu. 26.4. Deu. 11.14
                
               yea, I will giue the fyrſt rayne and the later, that thou mayſt gather thy wheate, thy wine, and thy oyle. The vſe of this knowledge we learne by the Prophet, euen to ſay in our hearts. Come, let vs now feare the Lord our God that giueth rayne both earely and late in due ſeaſon,
               
                  Iere. 5.24.
                
               and which reſerueth vnto vs the apoynted weekes of the

harueſt. That a miſt ſupplied the place of the rayne,
                  God will neuer wāt meanes.
                and watered all the earth, we learne the great power of our God to furniſh and ſteede himſelfe euer with meanes to effect his wyll. If hee haue not one thing, he can take an other, and neuer will he wante conuenient inſtruments of mercie for his children.
            
               2 Man was created of the duſte of the earth, that ſo baſe a matter might euer worke humilitie of minde,

                  Mans baſe matter ſhould humble him.
                that earth wee were, earth we are, and to earth againe we ſhall returne: hee, not we can tell how ſoone.
            
               3 But ere euer hee made Man,
                  All made ready to man.
                hee made all thinges for man, as was noted before. The earth to goe vpon, the heauens to couer him, the Sea for walles, Fiſhes and Fowles, Hearbes and Trees, to feede and comforte him, to delight and accompanye him, light by daye, and the like by night, manye a greene and pleaſant thing, and what wanted of ſuch creatures for man before hee was. Is this God a changeling? was his care for man then ſo great, and is it nowe nothing. No, no, hee is the ſame, and though wee haue ſinned, yet hee is intreated, and for Chriſt, as hee was hee will bee, carefull and good for man and to man euermore. Yet this is not all, but conſider we further of this thus.
                  God no les carefull of vs then of Adam.
                That if this dealing ſhewed loue and care to Adam, then howe is it not eache one of our caſes at this daye, in ſome reſpect. For before euer hee would haue anye of vs to lyue and breathe in this world, wee ſee, had hee not prouided Parents and Freends, houſes and comfortes, and whatſoeuer might bee needefull for vs? O loue then to vs alſo moſt kinde, and a care that may aſſure vs hee will euer care for vs. Loue him and feare him, honour him and ſerue him, hee is your GOD, who prouided for you before you were borne, thinges needefull for you, againſt you ſhould bee borne, and wyll hee euer forſake you, nowe when you are borne?

                  God both giuer and taker of life.
                God gaue life then, and who can take it awaye without his leaue? Can raging tyrants, bluddy perſecuters, flye Iudaſes? No, no, till hee will, you cannot dye, thunder they and threaten they neuer ſo much, and breathe out ſlaughter euerye houre againſt you. God gaue life, and God muſt take it awaye, it is one prerogatiue of his, you neede not feare. Againe, who can preſerue lyfe but hee that firſt gaue it? No man, no meanes. And therefore vſing as you are occaſioned,
                  No phiſick without God, can profit.
                what God hath appointed of any helpes, yet caſte your eye euer vpon the Fountaine from whome life came at the firſt. It is an other prerogatiue againe of his, to preſerue life alſo, and to giue his bleſſing for that purpoſe to his creatures, Hearbes or Plants, meates, or drinkes, men and their counſels whatſoeuer.
            Againe, life is the gifte of God, therefore abuſe not what God hath giuen you.
                  Life muſt be accomted for.
                It was not of your ſelfe, but it was giuen you▪ you muſt accompt for it, how you haue vſed it to the giuers praiſe▪ and your owne diſcharge.

                  Paradiſe made for a figure of Heauen.
                that it might bee for euer to poſteritie after, a figure of a celeſtiall place, abounding with innumerable comfortes, for the godly prepared in Heauen. Hee made not man in Paradiſe, but tranſlated him and put him in it after hee was created, that it might reſemble, that wee alſo ſhall bee remooued from the place where wee firſte tooke our beeing, to a place with our GOD, where wee ſhall neuer take ending. God ſet in this Paradiſe thinges not onelye profitable for vſe, but pleaſant alſo for ſight,

                not allowing Man in his moſte innocencye to be idle: no,
                  Idleneſſe hated of God from the beginning.
                hee would not his Angels to wante what to doe, but made them miniſtring Spirites. Howe then ſhould hee nowe, when corruption hath cauſed a curſſe, and that curſſe giuen cauſe of force to labour, alowe lothſome idleneſſe? Bee ſure hee dooth not, bee ſure hee will not. And therefore all honeſt mindes will not looke for nowe, what was not lawfull then. Yet differed that labour then, much from our labour nowe, for that was an iniunction inferring no greefe, and this is a paine deſerued by ſinne.
            
               7 God alowed them not to eate of the Tree of knowledge of good &amp; euill,

                that they might be acquainted euen from their beginning, with obedience and ſubiection to theyr maker: which as it was firſt and before all ſinne, ſo ſhould it bee euer of more account to a godlye minde, then all the pleaſures of ſinne vnder Heauen. If not, wee ſee the curſſe vpon the contrarie, it ſhall cauſe vs dye the death, that is, eternall damnation is the due rewarde of the contempt of Gods commaundement by diſobedience. Mee thinke wee may profitte thus by it alſo: to ſee howe God tooke his courſe to bring vp theſe newe created Seruantes of his, and ſo wee to do to ſuch as God ſend vs. Hee would invre them with obedience euen from the firſt,
                  Learne of God howe to bring vp youth.
                and haue them knowe what awe was to theyr ſuperiour: ſo let vs doe to our Children and charge, and wee ſhall followe a good patterne. Bowe their backes, euen from theyr Cradle, that is, euer as yeares permit, let them learne to obeye, and it ſhall be well: for he well ruleth that hath well obeyed, and hee commeth the rather to beare that credit, when other cockered wantons haue the wrath of GOD, and the diſlike of men againſt them. This is inough though I ſaye no more, yet thinke you much more of it, whome you follow, when you invre with obedience, and whome

you refuſe to followe, when you make ouer boulde whom you ſhould keepe vnder. Wanton darlings haue made many weeping Parentes, and drunke to theyr woe of the Cuppe of ſhame, when they might haue beene honoured if they had learned ſubiection. They breake rather then bowe, when once time is paſt.
            Mariage, the third point of the diuiſion, is alſo layd downe to vs in this Chapter, and in this ſort.

               All which are great teſtimonies, proofes and arguments, of the holyneſſe and goodnes of this diuine inſtitution of mariage, whervnto may be added the words of the Lord Ieſus in the Goſpell. Whom God hath ioyned together,
               
                  Math. 19.
                
               let no man put a ſunder. Gods coniunctions be euer holy and good, therfore mariage moſt commendable and honorable. The wordes of the Apoſtle, Euery one hath his proper gift,

               and the vnbeleeuing wife by the beleeuing husband. Therefore mariage moſt holye and good. For howe could an impure thing ſanctifie and make holye the vſers. It woulde pollute them and not ſanctifie them if it were ſuche. Agayne,

                ſo to furniſhe the Woman with direction, and abilitie, that ſhee maye doe within dores, what of her ſhould bee doone. Wherevpon the man is compared to the Sunne that giueth light, and the Woman to the Moone, that receyueth light from the Sunne.

But it is quite contrarye with many idle Drones. that ſhyne with the beames of theyr Wiues,

               and not aſhamed. That they were created naked,
                  Three things to be learned by our firſt nakednes.
                doth well declare how peaceable we ſhould be amongſt our ſelues, and how contrary to our beginning theſe weapons and armour be that now we are forced to vſe.  We were made then and are borne now with no iacks on our backs, no ſallets on our heads, nor ſpeares in our hands, but naked, and now we be armed i
                  •
                ſuch ſort, that if a beaſt ſhould be brought forth in reſemblance like vs when we be ſo armed, ſurely it woulde bee accompted a great monſter, and brought foorth for the hurt of all other creatures.  Secondly it doth teach vs how we ſhould depart againe, ſurely naked, for as naked we came, ſo naked ſhall we go, and cary no more away then wee brought with vs.  Thirdly it ſtayeth vs with comfort when any loſſe befalleth vs of theſe worldly goods, for ſo did it Iob, when vpon his loſſe he ſayd,
                  Iob. 1.
                
               Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked muſt I returne againe, the Lord gaue, and the Lord hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord eue

               8 That they were placed in Paradiſe naked ſo to remayne if they had not fallen,
                  Verſe 25.
                  
                ſheweth vs how God would haue vs walke before him, verely naked, without clokes and couers,
                  We ſhould walke before God without couers.
                maſkes and ſhadowes of any coloured craft. This nakedneſſe and nuditie not of body but of minde, of counſells, and actions, the Lord euer loued, and the contrary cloking he as hartily hateth. Wo be vnto you that ſeeke deepe to hide your counſells from God, ſayth the Prophet Eſay, for your works are in darkeneſſe,
               
                  Eſay. 29.
                
               and you ſay who ſeeth vs, and who knoweth vs?

               9 That they were not for all that aſhamed, fauoreth nothing any fantaſticall Anabaptiſts,
               
                  Innocency maketh bould, and giltines aſhamed.
                that will go naked, but declared the innocency that then was in them is now loſt by ſinne, yet regayned in meaſure by Chriſt, and ſhall perfitly be inioyed in the life to come, when nakedneſſe ſhall ſhame vs no more then it did at the firſt. Many and many are the things yet mo that might be noted out of this Chapter, but theſe ſhall ſuffice till heereafter.
         
         
            Chap. 3. 
            
               You haue ſeene in the former Chapters the creation of our firste Parents and their innocency, now ſhall you ſee their ſinne, and their fall. And this whole Chapter hath theſe heads in it.

                     The fall of Man.
                     The manifeſtation of the ſame by God, verſ. 9.
                     The puniſhment of it, verſ. 14.
                     The reſtitution by Chriſt, verſ. 15.
                  
               
            
            
               COncerning the firſt, it is ſayde, That the Serpent was more ſubtill then any beaſt of the feeld that God had made.
               
                  Verſe 1.
                  
                
               
                  The beſt things Satan moſt deſirous and buſye to abuſe.
                Noting, an extraordinarie thing in this beaſt aboue all others, which when we ſee Satan to make choyſe of, to abuſe to mans deceyuing and deſtruction, it may truly yeeld vs this note carefully to be obſerued, that if there be any thing better then an other, any gift and grace more in one then an other, or any thing extraordinary any way that may helpe him, that will Satan diligently by all meanes aſſay, to make it an inſtrument to ſerue his moſt dangerous and damnable purpoſes. Examples in the Scripture beſide this place many, and examples in experience euery day: to note one or two. Satan knoweth that it is a notable meanes to win many to the Lord,
                  The greatnes of men abuſed by Satan to hurt.
                to ſee great men and honorable perſonages to go before, as

alſo moſt effectual to the contrary, to ſee them drawe back, therefore with might and mayne as the Lord will ſuffer him, he laboureth to ſtop the one, and to further the other, that is to hinder their zeale to go before Gods people in all godly duties, and to increaſe their coldnes and drawing back, that they being kept in the way of death by him, together with them, by their example many may alſo dye &amp; periſh, which otherwiſe would do well if they had good guides. He laboreth the Rulers and the Phariſies euen with all his power, that they may not beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, to the ende that if any begin to draw towards the kingdome of life, and to ſay we neuer hard mā ſpeake as this man doth,
               
                  Iohn. 7.46.
                by and by they may be ſtopped with this obiection, do any of the Rulers &amp; Phariſies beleeue in him, and ſo by the deadly power of their hurtfull examples be ouerthrowne againe, &amp; that begun zeale vtterly quenched. Another example in the Acts of the Apoſtles. He might no doubt (Satan I meane) in thoſe darke dayes haue ſtirred vp many againſt the Apoſtles, but amongſt all▪ he choſe certaine honorable and deuout women with the chiefe men of the Citie, that by ſuch outward credit of wealth &amp; pietie, honor and dignity,
                  Act. 13.
                he might giue a greater blow to the cauſe of God, &amp; more eaſily worke the wo of his true ſeruants, keeping as you ſee this peſtilent pollicie, if any man or matter be of accompt, to ſeeke to win that to ſerue his purpoſe. He had rather tempt Demas that hath once folowed Paule, to forſake him againe, then many others: for dayly experiences, I had rather you ſhoulde thinke of them, then I note them. Conclude we therefore euer to be circumſpect and moſt carefull by this remembrance to preuent Satan, knowing that it is his manner, if God haue bleſſed vs either with knowledge, birth, wealth, office, credit, or any thing whereby our example may do more harme, if wee take a bad courſe, to labour mightely that he may for this cauſe the rather win vs to ſerue his turne, and ſo abuſe that good thing in vs, which ſhould ſerue to Gods glory, to the quite contrary, as here he did the wiſedome of the Serpent.
            
               2 Obſerue we heere the meanes whereby as ſpeciall helpes our Mother Eue was drawne to her deſtruction,
                  The meanes of Eue her 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  
                and all ours in her, and with her.
            
               
               
                  Verſe 1.
                  
               
                The firſt, is heere her tittle tattle too long and too much with the Serpent,
                  Note.
                or with Satan in the Serpent: whereas ſhee ſhould haue ſuffred no ſuch ſpeech againſt the rule and order that God had ſet downe, when once ſhe perceyued it tend that way, but with a zeale of defyance haue flung away from all ſuch conference and perſwaſion. Let her experience teach vs the danger of ſuch dealings euer.
                  How to auoyd euill motions.
                And firſt for inward temptations, if any ariſe▪ as neere as the Lord will aſſiſt vs: let vs not debate the matter with them long, but euen quickly reiect them, bend our mindes ſome other way, and take in hand ſome thing, worke, or ſtudy, or ſuch like, that we can be moſt earneſt about, calling to the Lorde with hartie heate, that he will help vs to quench and auert ſuch fierie darts. For truly if we reaſon with them, meditate of them, as many do, our fall in the end is greatly to be feared. Then for outward aſſaults by wicked company and lewd perſons the meſſengers of Satan,
                  Note.
                
               
                  How to auoyd outward aſſaults.
                take heede alſo by this example of Eue how you tattle with them. They be Serpents as this was, yea ſubtile Serpents, that will deceyue &amp; deſtroy you, as this did Eue. They ſpeake not, but the Deuill in them. Heare no ſuch charmers, charme they neuer ſo ſweetly. The enchancers of Egypt neuer hurt Pharaoh as they will hurt you. Away with your care betimes. Let diſlike as a fire kindle within you, and cauſe either your toong very ſharply to rebuke, or your ſteps to turne ſpeedely from ſuch company. O the vertue that hath bin loſt for want of this care. They that gliſtered as the Starres, and were for name as the very Sunne beames, ſpreading it ſelfe into all coaſts, haue become darkeneſſe, and as vile as the dung to all goodneſſe, by harkning ouer long to the hiſſing of ſuch Serpents. Be warned therefore, and beware betimes, for the Lord hath ſayd it: we can not touch pitch without ſpot, and euill words corrupt good maners. Experience teacheth, if a man tary long in the Sunne, hee will be ſunneburnt, and if he clap coles to his breſt he will be ſinged. Vnſkilfull youth beware by Eue, and bid ſuch Serpent
                  •
                leaue their hiſſing.
            
                Secondly, ſhee wauereth in beliefe of the Lordes truth, ſhe
                  •
                maketh a peraduenture of a certayne truth, and ſayth, leaſt yee dye, when the Lord had ſayd, yee ſhall dye, abſolutely &amp; flatly.

Beware therefore by her in this againe, and what God hath ſayde beleeue euer, diminiſh neuer. If hee ſay wee ſhall dye, wee ſhall finde him true, and if hee promiſe life, wee may not doubt. Beleeue him ſtedfaſtly whatſoeuer hee ſayeth, and mince not hys words with our Mother Eue, neyther adde any peraduentures, for great vantage hath Satan if we incline to a doubt, bee it neuer ſo little.
            
                Thirdly by a bolde lye of a facing Deuill, ſhee is pulled on to her deſtruction, for hee telleth her flatly, They ſhall not dye. And why did hee ſo? Becauſe as long as ſhee dreaded any thing the Lordes ſentence, as a thing that might fall out if ſhe did eate, ſhee could not bee brought to diſobey, therefore worketh he away from before her eyes that dread I warrant you with all indeuour. The caſe is ours euen at this day. As long as the iudgements of God are before our eyes agaynſt ſinne, we feare to ſinne, and this feare is as a ſtrong banke to keepe out the waues of wickedneſſe from ouerflowing vs. But if once the Deuill ſhake from our hearts thys dread by any meanes, as by hope of ſecrecie, impunitie, mercy in God, repentance in our ſelues, long life, good works, or what ſoeuer, (as hee hath infinite meanes) then drawe wee with Eue to a deadly fall, and the will of Satan is almoſt wrought. See examples of both. Ioſeph feared God, and this feare moſt ſtrongly beat back the waue that woulde haue all to wet him, had hee yeelded to hys Miſtreſſe. The Midwyues the lyke, and many mo. But out of Dauids minde hee got this feare, and hee had his will. From Cayne, from Abſolon, Achitophell, Iudas, and thouſands dayly hee doth the ſame, and hath his will. Beware then of ſuch bould lyes, as tend to depriue vs of this holy feare. Such bee theſe, doo this, or that, conſent to mee, yeeld to mee, wee will ſaue you harmeleſſe, wee wyll haue a ſhift, &amp;c.
            
                Fourthly the text ſayth, Shee ſawe that it was good to eate, and fayre to the eye: noting thereby a luſting looke, or a looking luſt, with a delight in the thing that God had forbidden, another mightie meanes to pull her to hell then, and vs and all fleſh now and euer. For that looking eye of Putiphars Wife vppon the bewtie of Ioſeph, made a luſting heart, and a ſinfull

ſoule within her. So did it in Dauid when hee ſawe Ber
                     •
                  abe. Heerevpon the eyes are ſayde to bee full of adulterie, and hee that thus looketh to haue committed iniquitie in his heart.  Her ambitious minde was an other meanes, noted in the wordes alſo, and ſtill it continueth a meanes to much euill. Marke Eues fall then, and theſe helping meanes, beware the one, and eſcape the other.
            
               
                  How ſpake the Serpent.
               
               3 But how could the Serpent ſpeake, ſince this power is not geuen to beaſts, but only to man? No queſtion it was not the Serpent by his owne power, but Satan in and by the Serpent, which is not impoſſible.
                  Iliad. 9.
                We reade of Achilles horſe, that foretould his mayſter of his death, of the flud Cauſus, which ſaluted Pythagoras, of the tree that ſpake to Apollonius, of the oke Dodonaea which ſpake like a man, of Iupiters Bull, and many ſuch, which who ſo conſidereth the guiles of Satan, hee needeth not to reiect as vntrue and impoſſible. When God permitteth, Satan is able to ſhrowde himſelfe vnder the creatures, as may beſt fit his purpoſe. Many wicked Southſayers Satan caſteth into pangs and fits of furie, and then ſpeake they by him, or he rather by them what he will.
            
               
                  Wily heds be fitteſt for the Deuill.
               
               4 In that Satan choſe the Serpent rather then an other creature, becauſe he was wily and ſubtill, me thinke it ſhoulde giue a good watchword to the crafty heads of this world, to take heed leaſt Satan make alſo choyſe of them for ſome purpoſes, as fitteſt for him, and beſt able by their guilefull fetches that they abound with and excell in, to ſerue his Deuilſhip. Surely we ſee by this they are liker to be aſſayed, then playne men and true dealers are. For playne men and women, that walke playnly, vprightly, iuſtly and honeſtly, they will not fit the Deuils turne, indeed they are too good for him, and God will not ſuffer them to be abuſed by him, but will ſet hym packing, and ſheld them from him, but where there is a crafty companyon, full of ſubtilties, ſleights, wiles, and falſe patchings, walking deceitfully in all his doings, O there is a ſeruant for the deuills owne tooth, and at him will he, he ſhall fit the deuills turne many wayes.
            
               5 How was it that the woman was not afrayde when the Serpent came to her, and offred to talke with her? ſome thinke,

becauſe his ſhape was then otherwiſe then it is now, God his curſſe vpon him hauing altered both his forme and going.
                  Why the woman feared not when the Serpent ſpake.
                Better me thinke anſwere they, that ſay, becauſe as yet there was no enmitie ſet betwixt the woman and him. Cyrill thinketh, becauſe the woman in ſimplicitie thought that ſuch other creatures ſpake aſwell as her huſband and ſhe.
            
               6 She was thus tempted,
                  Note.
                ſeduced and ouerthrowne in Paradiſe, and it may well admoniſh vs,
                  Where tooke our firſt mother ſuch a great fall.
                that if that Paradiſe coulde not free them from temptation, ſurely our Paradiſes heere ſhall neuer do it. But euen in our Princely Pallaces, our gliſtering Chambers, our daintie and delicate Gardens, the Deuill will be chatting with vs, and ſeeking to worke our woe for euer and euer if he can. Nay would God theſe paynted Paradiſes were not rather the places and meanes of our wofull faulls, then poorer places be, wee geuing our ſelues ſo much to the pleaſure of them, that God is forgotten, and the paſſage to Satans pleaſure layde open a thouſand wayes. O how haue they fallen ſwimming in pleaſures, that ſtoode moſt holy, when they had fewer delightes? O how haue courts of Princes robbed them of vertue, when in countrey and meaner places no Deuill could violate or defyle? Bewace wee then Satan euen in our Paradiſes, yea rather I ſay, then in poorer Cotes: when euery thing about vs is bright and braue, beware wee that enemy that is black and foule. Many pleaſures ſhould effect many deſires to pleaſe the giuer, God almightie, and no pleaſures ſhould make me wanton, luſting and longing for vnlawfull things. Let Eue bee remembred where ſhee was deceyued, and I ſay no more, it was in Paradiſe.
            
               7 In the former Chapters we haue heard nothing but the Lord ſayd, the Lord ſayd,
                  Verſe. 1.
                  
                but now come we to heare the Serpent ſayd, and the Serpent ſayd.
                  After the worde of truth, commeth the word of deceipt. Whiſperers in ſermon o
                        •
                      ſeruice time.
                So ſee wee playnely how after the word of God, commeth the word of the Deuill. It was not ſo then onely, but it hath ſo continued euer ſince. When the Lorde hath ſpoken by the mouth of his Miniſter, Prophet, Apoſtle, Paſtor, or Teacher, then ſpeaketh Satan by his Serpents contrarye. They in the Church, theſe aſſoone as they be out of Church, yea many times euen in the Church they will be hiſſing in their

eares that ſit next them. If God haue ſpoken to a childe by his parents, to a ſeruant by his maiſter, to a man by his freend, what is true and good, ſtreight commeth a ſerpent, one or other, and ouerthroweth all, leading them captiue to a contrary courſe. What ſay theſe ſerpents,
                  Seducers of youth.
                will you be thus vſed, will you beare all this? you are now no childe, do this, and do that, you ſhall not dye, but you ſhall liue, and be like Gods, knowing good and euill, &amp;c. But as Eue ſped by this Serpent, ſo ſhall you by thoſe, if you auoyd them not. Such ſerpents were thoſe yong Counſellers that made Rehoboam,
               
                  1. King. 12.
                
               Salomons ſonne, do contrary to the aduiſe of the old counſellers, to his great loſſe. Againe marke heere which was firſt, the word of God, or the word of Satan. Dixit Dominus,
               
                  Truth elder then falſehood.
                the Lord ſayd, goeth before Dixit ſerpens, the ſerpent ſayde, and ſo you ſee truth is elder then falſehood, and Gods word before Satans lyes: that is Tertullians rule to know truth by, namely, to looke which was firſt. Quodcunque primum illud verum, quodcunque posterius illud falſum. Whatſoeuer was firſt,
                  De preſcript. haeretic.
                that is true, whatſoeuer was later, that is falſe, and that is firſt that was from the beginning, and that was from the beginning, that in the writings of the Apoſtles may finde his warrant. Let it not blinde you then that ſuch an error hath continued a thouſand yeares, if it be to be proued that a contrary truth is elder farre.
            
               8 Satan tempteth the woman as the weaker veſſell, and if you haue any thing wherein you are weaker,
                  Satan tempteth where wee are weakeſt.
                then in another, beware, for hee will firſt aſſault you there. It is his manner lyke a falſe Deuill to take his aduantage. Happely you are eaſilyer drawen to adulterie than murder: that then ſhall pleaſe him, hee will begin there. So did he with Dauid, and then brought him to murder after. Dauid was weaker to reſiſt the one, thē the other. Thinke of your fraylties, and be godly wiſe, where the wall is loweſt he will enter firſt.
            
               9 He telleth her, they ſhall be like Gods, &amp;c. And it is his continued practiſe ſtill with hope of higher climing, to throwe downe many a man and woman. He will tickle you with honor,

with wealth, with friends, and many gay things that you ſhall get by yeelding to him, but whilſt you ſo looke to mount aloft,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                to better your ſtate, and to inioy promiſes, downe ſhall you fall from heauen to hell, and finde a falſe ſerpent when it is too late to call againe yeſterday, that is to vndoo what you haue done. Our mother Eue whilſt ſhe looked to become like God, and her huſband with her, ſhe became like the Deuill,
                  
                     
                        〈…〉
                      marke it.
                and caſt away her huſband alſo, euen ſo ſhall you if any vayne hope, promiſe or ſpeech tickle your heart to offend the Lord, vndo your ſelfe and friends.
            
               10 When ſhe had eaten, ſhe gaue to Adam.

                She was deceyued, and ſo was Adam.

                And many a man is deceyued by his friend both in matters of religion, &amp; of the world, when the friend is once deceiued himſelfe, and doth not know it. Eue meant him no harme, and yet ſhe hurt him becauſe ſhe was wrong her ſelfe. Many a Papiſt maketh a Papiſt, and thinketh well, but erroneouſly. Good is that friendſhip therefore where no part is wronged, and a faire warning is this for all people to beware what they are perſwaded to euen by their friends. Agayne, why did Satan not perſwade Adam himſelfe, but ſet Eue to do it? becauſe full falſely he knewe there is no eaſyer way to deceyue the man then by his wife, the huſband yeelding to her often what hee will to none. This continueth ſtill a pollicie of his, and many a man ſtill dayly falleth by this meanes. But good wiues wyll learne by this what they perſwade their huſbands too, and wiſe men what they conſent vnto.
            
               11 When they had both eaten, the text ſayth,
                  Verſe. 7.
                  
                
               theyr eyes were opened,
               
                  Pilate had done well if he had folowed his wife. How many wayes eies ar opened.
                meaning the eyes of their minde and vnderſtanding: but becauſe in other places the like is ſayde of the eyes of the body, therefore heere conſider you how many wayes both the one and the other are ſayd to be opened. For the bodily eyes, they are opened three wayes. Firſt, when of blinde they are made ſeeing. So were the blinde mans eyes opened in the ninth of Iohn, and elſe-where others. Secondly, when a man is made to ſee that whiche before hee could not ſee though hee were not blinde.
                  Iohn. 9. Num. 22.
                As when Balaams eyes were opened to ſee the Angell in his way

with a drawen ſword whome before he ſawe not, and yet was not blinde.
                  1. King. 6.
                When Elizaeus man was made at the prayer of hys mayſter to ſee the fierie chariots and horſſes for his mayſters defence, when the towne wherein he was, was beſieged. When Agar was made to ſee the well where ſhe might giue her childe drinke in the wilderneſſe,
                  Gen. 21.
                which before ſhe could not ſee, though her eyes were good. Thirdly and laſtly the bodely eyes are ſayde to be opened, when they are made to knowe and diſcerne what before they ſawe playnely, and yet did not knowe. Thus were Eliſha his enemyes their eyes opened when they were in Samaria,
               
                  1. King. 6.
                and their eyes that were going to Emaus. Theſe men ſawe, but they knew not what they ſo ſawe,
                  Luc. 24.
                till their eyes were opened. Then the firſt knewe that they were in Samaria, and the other knewe that hee was Chriſt that had talked with them. Now for the eyes of the minde, they alſo are opened three wayes. Firſt, by doctrine and teaching. Thus ſayth God to Paule, I haue made thee a Miniſter,
               
                  Act. 26.
                
               and ſend thee to the Gentiles to open their eyes, that they may turne from darkeneſſe to light, &amp;c. Secondly, by aduerſitie and affliction, for vexation giueth vnderſtanding,
               
                  Eſay.
                ſayth the Prophet. So were the prodigall ſonnes eyes opened, to ſee to take a better courſe then he did, which in his iolitie he did not ſee. Thirdly and laſtly by conſcience and feeling of ſinne committed. Thus were theſe our firſt parents eyes opened,
                  Fearefull in reſpect of griefe felt, but profitable in reſpect of good God, if we rightly repent.
                euen to ſee how fearefully they had ſinned and fallen from God. This of all other is the dreadfulleſt blindneſſe, not to ſee ſinne, and this opening of eyes by pearcing a blowe into my conſcience, is conſequently moſt fearefull. Thus againe were Iudas his eyes opened, to ſee how he had ſinned in betraying innocent bloud, and when he ſawe it, not able to abide the ſmart of it, he hanged himſelfe. Pray we therefore euer againſt this blindneſſe.
            
               12 They are aſhamed, and make couers for their nakedneſſe, had they bin as carefull not to be ſhamefull,
                  Verſe 7.
                  
                as now they are to couer their ſhame,
                  Men more carefull of ſecrecy then of innocency.
                it had bin well. Or were we yet as carefull not to do euill as we 
                  •
               re to hide it when it is done, it were alſo well, but we eate more to couer then to auoyd.

                   God is ſayde to haue walked in the garden in the coole of the day.

                           〈◊〉
                        .
                   That is nothing elſe, but God in mercy came to viſit theſe ſinners, and to reueale vnto them what ſtate they were in: which except he had done, no queſtion but Satan had drawne them further to more iniquitie, his manner being to go forward to worſe and worſe, where once he hath begun if God let him not. Such is Gods mercy at this day to vs miſerable ſinners. We fall and offend him ſome one way, ſome another, and all of vs too many wayes. Where it pleaſeth him to ſhewe iuſtice and wrath, there he letteth them goe on with hardned hearts, braſen browes, and ſtiffe necks euery day, worſe and worſe, but where it pleaſeth him to ſhewe mercy, there he commeth to walke in the coole of the day: that is as I ſayd, there he viſiteth the partie that hath ſinned happely the ſame day, happely the ſame houre, euen aſſoone as the deede is done, by ſmiting the heart, as he did Dauids, with true remorſe, ſight and ſorow of and for what then is done, that albeit that can not be vndone againe, yet it may be lamented with ſpeedy and true repentance, and no more added therevnto, as no doubt we ſhould do, if God thus walked not to viſit vs with his holy ſpirit. Happy were we if we could not ſinne and offend our God, but ſince that is not now to this corruption of ours poſſible, pray we the Lorde with bowed knees that he would viſit vs euer, and quickly, yea in the coole of the ſame day, that is, ere we go to bed, or take any reſt, that we may ſee and ſigh for our tranſgreſſions that day againſt his Maieſtie.
               
                  2 God walked not then ſilent, but the Text ſayeth, they heard hys voyce. No more doth hee now,
                     God is not ſilent now in his walking.
                   but wee alſo heare hys voyce: for his voyce are his Miniſters, Preachers, and cryers, crying in hys Churche Repent, for the kingdome of God is at hande. Happye are they that heare them with profit and feeling, and who ſo contemne them, let them learne by this

place, that they deſpiſe God himſelfe walking in the garden o
                     •
                   his Church, and ſpeaking to them, which contempt he will hotely reuenge one day.
               
                  
                     The coole of the day, what it doth ſignifie.
                  
                  3 Agayne by the coole of the day, we may note if we will the oportunitie of time that God tooke to come to doo good vpon theſe ſeduced ſinners, to weet, when the heate of the temptation was paſt. Thereby teaching his Miniſters ſome godly wiſedome, to take their time, and notably diſcouering our vile corruption, that admit no counſell nor perſwaſion while the heate of concupiſcence &amp; temptation is vpon vs. Happely in the coole of the day we will, that is, when wofull experience hath beate vs, and ſinfull heate is abated in vs. But O graceleſſe wee that no ſooner: Yet better late then neuer, ſo that wee preſume not: which if wee doo, ſurely it is many to one, that neyther in the coole of the day the Lorde will viſit vs, but euen caſt vs away for euer, becauſe we preſumed, making no more accompt of his Maieſtie, but to be at our becke, and of repentance, which is his great gift to be at our call.
               
                  4 In that they hid themſelues from the preſence of God. Marke the frute of ſinne, it woundeth the conſcience, and the conſcience wounded,
                     Sinne maketh vs hyde from God.
                   feareth, accuſeth, vexeth, and tormenteth a man, diſtruſteth in God, flyeth from him, and vaynely ſeeketh a couer from him that admitteth no couers. But let vs bee warned by it how fooliſh this courſe is, nay how deſperate and daungerous: and when through frayltie, wherewith we are clothed as with a garment, we haue offended, runne not from God, but runne to God, hide not from him, but open to him what indeede he knoweth already. Fall at his footeſtoole, and cry peccaui. I haue ſinned, Lord I haue ſinned, woe is me that I haue ſo, but haue mercy vppon me, deere God haue mercy vppon me, yea agayne and agayne haue mercy vppon mee, and according to the multitude of thy mercyes doo away mine offences. Thus may you liue, but by running from him you cannot runne from him, by hiding you can hide nothing, and yet for your indeuour you ſhall dye the death.
               
                  
                  5 Adam ſayd, he was afrayd becauſe he was naked,

                   ſo waywarde is fleſh to confeſſe a truth, if it touch our ſelues with any fault, but God folowed him out, and aſked him who tould him that he was naked? thereby vrging him hardly to tell truth, and teaching vs all at this day, that except we confeſſe truly and fully, playnely and faithfully our ſinne to God, there is no forgiuenes. Wryings and turnings from the matter will not ſerue, minſings and ſhiftings before hym were neuer currant, nor euer ſhall be. A direct confeſſion becommeth a ſinner, and God requireth it:

                  the woman whome thou gaueſt mee. Would God this ſinne of tranſlating a fault from our ſelues to others had dyed with Adam, then had not ſo many of vs bin ſo faultie in the ſame as we are, ſome blaming one thing and ſome another, and fewe men as they ought blaming themſelues. To recken vp particulars, were too long, thinke of them your ſelues, and auoyd the like. Monſtrous is that bouldneſſe or ingratitude, that rather will blame God then themſelues, as heere Adam did, when they ſhould be thankfull to God for as much as he did. The woman doth the lyke, and as Adam layd the matter vppon her, ſo ſhe vppon the Serpent, both naught, and farre from the courſe of right repentance.

And her ſubiection ſhould admoniſh her of her weakeneſſe and neede of direction, and ſo abate all pride and conceipt of her ſelfe, and worke true honor in her heart towards him whome God hath made ſtronger then her ſelfe, and giuen gifts to direct her by. This I ſay this authoritie in the man, and ſubiection in the woman ſhould effect. But alas▪ many men are rather to be ruled, then to rule, and many women fitter to rule, then to be ruled of ſuch vnruly huſbands. On the other ſide many men for abilitie moſt fit and able to rule, yet for pride in the heart where ſubiection ſhould be,
                     To wit, in the woman
                   ſhall haue no leaue to rule. So fit we ſometimes to the order appoynted of almightie God. Amendment is good on both ſides, for feare of his rod, whoſe order we breake.

                  4 In the third place Adam hath his puniſhment appoynted,
                     Adams puniſhment.
                   but with mencion of his fault before, to weet, Becauſe thou didſt obey the voyce of thy wife, and eat. Thereby geuing a note to Magiſtrates and Rulers that inflict puniſhments, to doo the lyke, namely, to be able euer to lay downe a iuſt cauſe of theyr ſentence. If Herod ſhould haue done thus when he killed Iohn, he would haue ſeene his owne cruell iniuſtice: and many in theſe dayes would be to ſeeke of true cauſes, if they would keepe this order.
               
                  5 Adam was drawen to it by his wife, and ſhe by the Serpent,
                     Other procuring no excuſe of ſinning.
                   yet neither of them excuſed by that, well and well agayne admoniſhing vs, that no yeelding to a friend in an euill matter, ſhall euer be defended by ſuch excuſe. The caſe you ſee heere, is in the Church this day. Satan ſtirreth vp his falſe charmers in holes and corners againſt the Lorde and his anoynted. They are as this Serpent. Many in ſimplicitie are abuſed by them, thinking all ſhall be well,
                     Priuie ſeducers.
                   
                  they ſhall knowe good and euill, &amp;c. theſe be as Eue. And many yeeld vnto theſe for fauour and frendſhip, kinred, and liking, &amp;c. and theis are as Adam. But as Adam was excuſed becauſe his friend perſwaded him, ſo ſhall they bee and no otherwiſe, and would God wee might thinke of it at large, and with a full meditation.

                     The earth puniſhed.
                   and the benefits that we receiue neuertheleſſe by labour from it, declare Gods mercy, that we might be thankefull. The labour that is inioyned, teacheth how hatefull to God all idleneſſe is, and the courſe beeing ſo,
                     Men liuing without a vocation.
                   that with the ſweate of mine owne brow I ſhould eate my bread, a vocation is inferred for euery man to walke in, and liuing at other mens tables, and other mens trenchers, eating the ſweat of theyr browes, and not mine owne is condemned.
               
                  7 God made Adam and his Wife coates of Skinnes. The beginning of apparrell is heere to bee noted,
                     Verſe. 21.
                     
                   that it was when wee had ſinned,
                     The beginning of apparell when.
                   and ſo is vnto vs at this daye no otherwiſe, then if an offender ſhould weare an halter all his life in remembrance of his faull. What ſhould more coole this vayne delight of apparell in vs then this? ſhould the theefe that had purchaſed an haulter by his faull, yet had life granted him with a law to weare that halter during life, wax proud of his halter, and dye it red, or greene, or in ſome braue colour, that he might ruffle it out with his haulter? Surelye ſo it is with apparell,
                     A ſilken halter is but a halter.
                   it is our halter and badge of our deſert to dye, and wee ſhould not bee ſo proude with an halter as wee are: Whether it be ſilke or veluet, ſiluer or golde, all is but an halter. And it ſhould make vs ſighe rather then ſwell with pride as we doo. It ſhould humble vs trulye and ſerue our neede, it ſhould neuer make vs hawtie and ſerue for pompe.
               
                  8 Adam is thruſt out of Paradiſe to paine and labour.

                   And it teacheth the iudgement of God vpon all ſuch,
                     Men abuſing places of honor.
                   as being by hys mercy preferred to places of honour, pleaſure and good, graceleſlye abuſe them, and themſelues in them, to the Lordes diſliking. Surely they ſhall bee thruſt out then in the Lordes iuſtice and wrath, when he ſeeth his time.

                   being put out of all hope to recouer it and his eſtate anyemore, might quietly ſubiect himſelfe to the Lords ordinance, and faule to till the earth as he was inioyned.
               
                  If any ſhould thinke the Lord might haue kept the tree of Life from him, and let him neuertheleſſe inioye the Garden. Truth it is he could ſo, but he would not ſo. Thereby as in figure declaring thus much:
                     A figure.
                   That if any man be not vouchſafed by Gods mercy and ſauour to inioy Chriſt Ieſus the true Tree of Life, the ſame may haue no place in the kingdome of God the true Paradiſe. And thus much for a taſte of the good of this Chapter, being but a li

                     The propagation of mankinde.
                     The murder of Abell by Cain his brother.
                     And the puniſhment of the ſame by God.

                after man was caſt out of Paradiſe,
                  Mariage not impeached.
                then this was. Which ſome wicked ſpirites inflamed with venome againſt the holy inſtitution and ordinance of God, haue ſnatched at, and thereby ſought to blemiſh godly mariage, ſaying it was then vſed, when paradiſe was loſt and not before, then Adam knew his wife and not before. But theſe wicked impes ſhould know, that if we ſhould alwayes reaſon from the order of ſpeeches in the word of God, we ſhould make many abſurdities, The maner of the Holy-ghoſt being ſo often to ſpeake of that laſt that was done firſt, and of that before that was done after. In Samuel it is ſaid,
                  1. Sam. 6.14
                
               They claue the wood of the Cart, and offered

the Kine for a burnt offring vnto the Lord, and then in the next verſe: They tooke downe the Arke,15. and put it vpon the great ſtone: as if they had clou

               n the Cart, wherevpon the Arke was before they tooke the Arke downe, which could not bee, yet the order of the wordes are ſo. A number of ſuch places there be in the Scriptures, in all which, as there is a plaine figure putting that after, that was doone firſt, ſo may it be heere very well, that Adam knew her before, although now ſpoken of, and not before, and ſo the Act of Mariage nothing impeached by this order of wordes B

               t ſuppoſe it were not ſo, but that nowe firſt he knewe her, yet cannot theſe Spirits denye, but euen in Paradiſe it was ſaid, Increaſe and multiplie, thereby authoriſing and ſanctifieng the act if they had neuer fallen: ſo that holy euery waye ſtandeth Gods ordinance notwithſtanding this word: Afterward Adam knew his Wife.

                  Children the gift of God.
                The firſt mother that euer was, abſcribing the firſt Childe that euer was vnto Gods giuing: ſo then acknowledged, ſo euer ſince acknowledged, by the godlye, that children are a bleſſing comming onely from the Lord: He maketh the barren woman to bring forth, and to be a ioyfull mother of Children, and he onely dooth it.
            
               3 She called her eldeſt Kaine, which ſignifieth a poſſeſſion,

                which ſignifieth vaine or vnprofitable. By which diuerſitie of names euidently appeareth a diuerſitie of affection in the namers, and ſo teacheth vs two things. Firſt the prepoſterous loue that is in manye Parentes, eſteeming moſte oftentymes of thoſe Children that are woorſte, and leaſt of them that deſerue better. Theyr Kaines be accounted Iewels and wealth, but theyr Habels vnprofitable, needeleſſe and naught. Secondlye it teacheth the lot of the godlye in this worlde many times, euen

               Such and ſo crooked are mens iudgements often, but the Lords is euer ſtreight,
                  A comfort ſweete.
                and let that be our comfort: he preferreth Abell before Cain, whatſoeuer his parents thinke, he loueth Iacob better then Eſau, and hee chooſeth little Dauid before his tall brethren: hee ſeeth the heart, and goeth thereafter, when men regard ſhowes and are deceyued. Care away then, if my heart be ſounde, God eſteemeth me, and let man chooſe.

                Idleneſſe hated then from the beginning, both of the godly and ſuch as had but ciuill honeſtie, or the vſe of humaine reaſon. The antiquitie of Huſbandrye heerein alſo appeareth,
                  Antiquitie of husbandrie.
                to the great praiſe of it, and due incouragement vnto it. But alas our dayes: many things hath time inuented ſince, or rather the Deuill in time hatched, of farre leſſe credit, and yet of more vſe with wicked men, a nimble hand, with a paire of Cards, or falſe Diſe,
                  Diſe and Cardes.
                is a way now to liue by, and Iack muſt be a gentleman, ſay nay who ſhall. Tilling of the ground is to baſe for Farmers Sonnes, and we muſt be finer. But take heede we be not ſo fine in this world, that God knowe vs not in the worlde to come, but ſay vnto vs,
                  Thinke of this yee ouer fine Farmars.
                I made thee an Huſbandman, who made thee a Gentleman, I made thee a tiller of the ground, a trade of life moſt ancient and honeſt, who hath cauſed thee to forſake thy calling wherein I placed thee. Surely thou art not he that I made thee, and therefore I know thee not, depart from me thou wicked one into euerlaſting fire.

                Faith euer preſuppoſeth a word becauſe it is a frute that ſpringeth onely of that ſeede, and therefore it neceſſarily followeth, that albeit wee read not preciſelye when God taught them thus to worſhip him, yet certaine it is that he taught it, and commanded it, otherwiſe it could not bee doone of faith nor pleaſe him. Moſt like therefore that God taught Adam, and Adam his Children, leauing behind him this

holy practiſe as ancient as the world within a little,
                  How ancient inſtruction of parents is, &amp; of what force.
                that parents ſhould inſtruct in religion the ſeede that God hath giuen them: and ſo looke vnto them, that euen their Cains if they haue anye▪ dare doe no other, but at leaſt make a ſhowe of obedience to God, how wicked ſoeuer theyr hearts bee. Such care would cut the combe of ſuch vile atheiſme as ruleth nowe, and make all curſed ſpirits at leaſt not to dare to ſhowe their contempt of God and holy exerciſes appoynted for man to ſerue God withall, and by, as now they dare and do.

                  Verſe. 4.
                  
                yet marke you a difference in their dooings. Cain brings an offering, but Abell brings an offring of the fat of his ſheepe, which the ſpirit of God noteth by a repetition of ſet purpoſe, with an edge of ſpeeche, ſaying not only that he brought of the Sheepe, but of the fat of them, of the fat of them.
                  Leu. 22.22.
                Thereby deliuering to vs this difference betwixt a true heart and a falſe, a true godly man or woman, and a ſinner. They both offer, but the one thinketh any thing good inough, and the other in the zeale of his ſoule, and fulneſſe of his Lord,
                  Howe hypocrites diſcouer themſelus.
                thinketh nothing good inough. He bringeth his gift, and of the fatteſt, that is, of the beſt he hath, and wiſheth it were ten thouſand times better. This heate of affection towards God, let vs all marke, and euer thinke of: it vneaſeth ſuch as in theſe dayes thinke any ſeruice inough for God, halfe a quarter of an houre in a weeke, &amp;c. And ſuch, as if they haue any tithes to pay to their Miniſter, who is in the place of God to receiue them,
                  Bad tythers.
                whilſt that courſe ſtandeth for his maintenance, chooſe out the broken and blinde, the halte and lame, the ſcabbed and ſcuruye, and the worſt of euery thing, thinking that alſo to good. But theſe holow harted Cains, and couetous hypocrites God ſeeth, and their rewarde ſhall be as Cains was.

Marke I praye you how hypocrites, though they be hypocrites, yet can they not abide to be ſerued like hypocrites, no, they will not giue God himſelfe (much leſſe man) leaue to deale with them as they deſerue. Kaine will fret, and rage and fret, if his falſe hart be reiected of God. And all ſuperſtitious idolaters will doo the like if theyr faſtings and prayers, croſſings and creepings, and all theyr worſhip either in matter or manner, or both diſliked of God, bee diſcountenanced. That which they doe is wicked and naught, and yet neither God nor man may ſay ſo, or ſhow ſo. But we muſt be content, you ſee this mallice for telling truth is not of two dayes age, but as olde as Kaine.
            
            
               
                  How the fauour and diſlike of God appeared.
               
               9 But how appeared this liking and diſliking of their ſacrifices, and whereby knew they of it? The vſuall anſwer and opinion is, that either from heauen fire came downe and conſumed Abels offring, as that of Elias in the Kings, of Salomon when hee dedicated the Temple,
                  1. King. 18. 2. Chro. 7. Iud. 6.
                or out of the Stone wherevpon it laye, as wee reade of Gedeon. But becauſe the Scripture is ſilent,
                  Where the word hath no mouth, haue you no eare, much leſſe an itching eare.
                let not vs be curious. Contented with this, that it did appeare, what waye we knowe not certaynelye. The texte is playne, Kaine ſawe the difference, and was highlye diſpleaſed. Some thing therefore was doone of God, and ſome ſigne giuen of his gratious fauour more to Abell and his gift that came from a true heart, then to Kaine and his gift, not from the like proceeding.
            
               
                  Verſe. 4.5.
                  
               
               10 It is eſpecially to bee noted, that God is not ſayd to haue reſpected onelye Abel his offring,
                  Men regarde me
                        •
                      for gifts, God regardeth gifts for men.
                but to haue reſpected Abel and his offring, putting a regarde of Abels perſon, before the regard of his gift. Thereby teaching vs that it is not with God as it is with men: for men regard cheefly the gifts and then the perſons according to their gifts, if they giue much, they regarde them more, if they giue leſſe, they loue them thereafter, but God quite contrary. He reſpecteth firſt the perſon, and then the

gift, and if the perſon pleaſe him, his gift he accepteth, if not, no gifts of his doth God care for. Now the perſon pleaſeth onely in Chriſt, and therefore no gifts but the gifts of the godly doth God reſpect. Baſe is that minde that is wonne to loue by gifts, or to diſlike for want of gifts great inough. Such ſinne is not in God, and therefore away with Opus operatum.
               
                  Opus operatum.
                Such popiſh traſh offendeth God. It is not you ſee the deed doone that pleaſeth God as they ſay, but the partie that dooth it, muſt firſt pleaſe God, as you ſee heere. He had reſpect to Abell firſt, and then to his offering, that is, firſt it pleaſed him to accept in Chriſt, Abels perſon, and then the duties that came from his accepted ſeruant, he regarded. Like place is that in the prophet:
                  Mala. 1.10.
                
               I haue no pleaſure in you ſaith the Lord of hoaſts, neither will I accept an offring at your hands. Firſt profeſſing the diſlike of theyr perſons and then his neglect of any thing they gaue. Eſay the like againe, and many times elſewhere in the Scripture.

                Wherefore if euer wee would that any thing proceeding from vs ſhould bee accepted of God, let vs labour firſt that our ſelues may be accepted, by being truly grafted into him by faith, with whome God is perfitlye pleaſed and for him, with all that depende vpon him.

Olde anger prooues curſſed malice, and olde malice wyll haue murther cruell, if other circumſtances of time, place, and the like may bee had. Let not the Sunne goe downe then vpon your wrath, but ſtoppe beginning

Anger that cannot ſpeake is moſt wicked,
                  A faire ſpeaking anger.
                but anger that can ſpeake, and faire ſpeake, and meane ſo ill, is wickedneſſe it ſelfe. It is a Cains curteſie to ſpeake faire, and meane ill, to walke with me as a brother, and to cut my throate as an enemy, and euen that ſhould make vs hate it.
                  To ſet brethren at variance how olde a practiſe of Satan.
                See alſo heere and obſerue it well, how old a practiſe of Satan it is to ſet brethren at variance for religion. Cain hateth Habell, becauſe God made it knowne that his religion and worſhipping of God, was better then his. Old ſatan hath not caſt his cote yet, but ſoweth diſlike ſtill for the ſame cauſe. Gods word giueth teſtimony to one brothers truth, and diſliketh vtterly the other brothers falſehood. This maketh the worſe to gnaſh at the better, where he ſhould reioyce for him and pertake in his good by yeelding to it.
            
               12 God regarded this iarre in Caine, and expoſtulateth with him what ayled him. Dooth not God abide it, and will Caine do it? haue we any Cains now that hate theyr brethren and heare this, are they not afraid of Gods eye? are they not aſhamed to be like Cain? doe they thinke to iumpe with him in crime, and not to iumpe with him in iudgement? It cannot be.
            
               13 But will Cain confeſſe to God what is the matter? no I warrant you,
                  To hyde malice as olde as Caine.
                neither his hatred before, nor his murther after, but concealeth all as much as he could, though in deed from God nothing can be hid. So old againe is this corruption of hiding and couering, cloaking and ſhadowing of our ſinnes. When wee do it, we reſemble Caine, and what fowler patterne to be paynted by▪

                  Long life and death at laſt of the olde fathers.
                many yeares they continued, yea many hundreds, but at laſt they dyed. Death long ere it came, but at laſt it came. And touching their long life▪ ſome queſtions are mooued: Firſt why it was ſo long▪ Secondly whence or howe it came to bee ſo:
                  Their life whye ſo long.
                of the firſt, two cauſes are aledged, one for the propagation of mankinde, ſo much the faſter and more ſpeedely: the other for continuance of remembrance of matters, and deducing of them to poſteritie the better. To the ſecond, anſwer is made,
                  Howe ſo long.
                that as al mens liues at this day are from God and of God, as the fountaine, ſo was alſo that long life of theyrs, and by him onely it was produced to and for ſuch terme as it was. Neuertheleſſe, if we ſpeake of cauſes in nature (by which alſo God worketh when it pleaſeth him) diuers and ſundry there were then, now to be remembred if we will, wherefore their life might paſſe ours as it did, and bee ſo long. The indifferent mixture, equall temperature;
                  Cauſes in nature of long life.
                and good diſpoſition of the cheefe and firſt qualities, heat, colde, moyſture, dryneſſe, is in nature the ground of life, and by all probabilitie in that beginning this was ſo, more then now. Their dyet better and temperance more from ſurfetting and fleſhlye pleaſures, then is now. The region they dwelte in hote in a ſtrength to drye vp and conſume ſuperfluitie of humors, when anye were corrupt and rotten:

And laſtly the fruites of the earth, in their puritie, ſtrength, and vertue, not corrupted as after the Flud, and euer ſince ſtill more and more might be to them a true cauſe and a moſt forcible cauſe of good health, greater ſtrength, and longer life, then euer ſince by nature could bee.

worde euer infallible and vnmooueable.

To finde it I ſaye, and God knoweth, not wee, how ſoone. To daye I,

                to morrowe thou, ſaith the Wiſe man. His conceipte was not vnprofitable, that imagined mans life to be as a Tree at the roote: whereof two Miſe lye gnawing and nibling without ceaſing, a white Mouſe, and a blacke. The white Mouſe hee conceiued to bee the daye, and the blacke Mouſe the night: by which daye and night mans life as a tree by continuall gnawing at laſt is ended. Who can nowe tell howe farre theſe two Miſe haue eaten vpon him.

                Happely the Tree that ſeemeth yet ſtrong, ere night may ſhake, and ere daye againe fall flat downe. O let vs thinke of this vncertaintie, and that is all I wiſhe by this ſpeeche. Adams coate of Skins might fitlye remember him of this. And what weare wee ſtill in our moſt ruffe, which appertayned not ſometime in ſome ſorte, to a liuing creature, by whoſe death we being clad, may fitlye thinke of our owne deaths that are ſo ſure. But you ſee the Snowe howe blinde it makes a man,

                        •

                to reuerence and feare the liuing God, and (by the way) when it dooth ſo, if godly men be ſaid to walke with God,
                  Mich. 6.8.
                I pray you with whom walke they that are vngodly? Surely with him, that if they ſaw him would feare them, and ſhame them to bee arme in arme with ſo foule a gueſt. But what the eye ſeeth not the heart feareth not, yet the end will finde it, when it is too late. In this place to walke with God, ſignifieth he was tranſlated out of this life and world, not by death as others, but aliue as were no others then, to liue with the Lord. Which tranſlation to him was inſteed of death, that following to him by this rapt, that to others without it after death.
                  Where Henoch and Elias are.
                The Lord did this to giue vs ſome ſigne of the reſurrection to a better life prepared, and to be a teſtimonie of the immortalitie of ſoules and bodyes. As to inquire where hee became, is meere curioſitie. The like wee read of Elias the Prophet, that he alſo was caught vp into heauen in this extraordinary manner.

                Many vaine motions about them, both by idle heads which I will not ſcan. Yea euen godly men haue waded further, then by any neceſſitie they were conſtrained: for where God hath not an anſwer we ſhould not haue a queſtion, that is, where it pleaſeth him to be ſilent we ſhould not be ſifters,

                for he concealeth nothing that may be profitable. Syrach is alledged, where it is ſaid, that Henoch was tranſlated into Paradiſe. But as the booke is not Canonicall, ſo in that is the Latin tranſlation falſe, the Greeke hauing nothing of Paradiſe, but ſimply that he was tranſlated. Other gueſſes and talkes I take as they be onely gueſſes, and paſſe them ouer. Where ſhould they be but with others of the godly where they are: their bodies in the rapt changed, as the Apoſtle ſaith all ours ſhall be, when corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and mortall, immortalitie,

                     1 Mans degeneration from God in the foure firſte verſes.
                     2 The iuſtice of God ordaining puniſhment for him from the 5. verſe to the 8.
                     3 The mercie of God euen in this Iuſtice, from the 8. to the end.
                  
               
            
            
               1 
               TOuching the firſt, it teacheth vs, as I ſayd,
                  Verſe. 1.2.
                  
                the great and greeuous corruption of man,
                  Mās great corruption
                who the more bound hee is for mercy to ſerue God trulye, the more apte and prone hee is to offend him highlye. The Lorde had nowe increaſed mankinde▪ &amp; them manye to theyr great comforts, if they could haue vſed it, and nowe without all regarde and thankefulneſſe for ſuch his goodneſſe, headily, and haſtilye, wickedlye and vngodlye they prouoke him to anger and great diſpleaſure againſt them, by fleſhlye following their owne willes, euerye man marrying as hee beſt lyked, for outwarde beautye, without regarde of Gods liking, and inwarde vertue. The Sonnes of God, that is, the Children of the godlye, ſawe the daughters of men, that is, of wicked parents deſcended, ſuch 
                  〈◊〉
                
               Kain was, that they were fayre, and they tooke them wiues of all that they liked.
            
               2 Wee ſee howe greeuous a thing vnequall mariages bee, when the godlye with the vngodlye,
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   all 
                     〈…〉
                  
                the beleeuing with the Infidels, the religious with the ſuperſtitious, are vnequally yoaked: ſurely euen ſo greeuous to God, that for this cauſe eſpecially the

whole world was deſtroyed by the Flud. The Lord is no changeling, he diſliked it euer▪ and diſliketh it ſtill. It is a ſecret poyſon that deſtroyeth vertue more ſpeedily then anye thing. Salomon was ouerthrowne by the daughters of men for all his wiſedome. Iehoſaphat matched his Sonne to Ahabs daughter, and it was his deſtruction. Hee forſooke the waye of the Lorde, and wrought all wickedneſſe in a full meaſure. Whye? becauſe ſayth the Texte,
                  2. Ch▪ 21 6
                
               The Daughter of Ahab was his Wife. Ahab was wicked, but a wicked Wife made him farre worſe, for ſhee prouoked him ſaith the Texte:
                  2. Cor. 6.
                
               Be not vnequally yoaked with the Infidels (ſaith the Apoſtle): for what felowship hath righteouſneſſe with vnrighteouſneſſe? and what communion hath light with darkeneſſe? what concord hath Chriſt with Belial: or what parte hath the beleeuer with the Infidell. It is a lawe of mariage that ſhould not bee broken,
                  Thinke of theſe reaſons, and mary vertue, not wealth nor will.
                that it bee in the Lorde, that is, with his liking and in his feare, with ſuch as bee godlye, and hould the truth. Our children we allow not to marrye againſt our wils, but our right wee challenge to giue a conſent. And ſhall the Children of God ſeeke no conſent of theyr Father in Heauen to theyr marriages? But his conſent hee will neuer giue to marrye his enemie, and therefore doe it not. It is not lawfull, it is not expedient, if it were lawfull. The Flud came to ſo much ſuch diſobedience, and forget it neuer.
            
               
                  Beautie is vaine.
               
               2 Conſider how God hateth it, that in mariage, onely beautie and fauour ſhould be reſpected: for theyr faireneſſe the ſonnes of God choſe wicked Women, ſaith this place, and God plagued it. Fauour is deceitfull, and beautie is vanitie (ſaith wiſe Salomon,) but a Woman that feareth God, ſhe ſhall be prayſed.

                  Gods great patience and long ſuffering.
                And ſee in it, and by it the deepneſſe of Gods goodneſſe to vs miſerable ſinners, he dooth not by and by bring vpon vs the deſarte of our ſinnes, but beareth with vs, and long beareth with vs, daylye and hourelye,

giuing mercy more notwithſtanding all thoſe ſinnes, yea he ſtriueth with vs, and tuggeth with vs, that wee might be ſaued and not periſh. O what a God is this. Looke how your ſelfe ſtriue with your childe or friend whome you loue, to bring him to good, and to ſaue him from euill, euen ſo doth the Lord with you, yea much and farre more. As I liue, as I liue ſayth the Lord, I deſire not the death of the wicked,
               
                  Eze. 33.11.
                
               but that he may turne from his way and liue: O turne you, turne you from your euil wayes, for why will yee dye yee houſe of Iſraell.
               
                  2. Petr. 3.9.
                
               The Lord of his promiſe is not ſlack, as ſome men count ſlackneſſe, but is patient toward vs, and would haue no man to periſh, but would all men to come to repentance, ſayth the Apoſtle Peter. And deſpiſeſt thou O man ſayth S. Paule, the riches of Gods bountifulnes and patience and long ſuffering, not knowing that the bountifulnes of God leadeth thee to repentance? Thus good is God, and thus he ſtriueth with vs.
            
               4 Agayne, marke his mercy in the time that hee graunteth heere to repentance:
                  Verſe. 3.
                  
                
               An hundred and twentie yeares ſayth hee ſhall his dayes bee: that is, though thus greatly and greeuouſly man hath offended, and euen all the earth is become corrupt, ſo that with great iuſtice I might bring a flood foorthwith, and conſume them all: yet will I not doo ſo, but ſtill beare longer, and looke for amendment, yea an hundred and twentie yeares yet will I giue him ere I bring the flood vpon him, to ſee if they will returne, and auoid my wrath. What is long ſuffring if this be not? and this is the ſweete nature of our God.
            
               5 Of Gyants and mightie men the word ſpeaketh ſundrie times in ſeuerall places. Heere he ſayth,
                  Gyants.
                of theſe vngodly mariages came many of them, which being mightyer then the vſuall ſort of men, vſurped by their might, authoritie ouer others, and did degenerate from the ſimplicitie wherein their Fathers lyued. In the booke of Numbers, they that went to ſearch the land of Canaan, when they returned made report,
                  Chap. 13.34.
                
               that they had ſeene there Gyants, in compariſon of whome, they ſeemed Graſhoppers. In Deuteronomie mention is made of Og, the King of Baſhan, whoſe bed was of iron, nine cubits long,
               
                  Chap. 3.11.
                
               and foure

cubits brode. That great Goliah alſo of the Philiſtims you remember. S. Auſten ſayth: he ſaw the tooth of a man as great as an hundred of ours, what was the body then? ſomewhat you may gueſſe. Plinie reporteth, that in Crete out of a mountayne was digged the remnants of a man by gueſſe of proportion when hee liued ſix and fortie cubits, but there were no end to tell you all we reade of this matter. Thus much ſufficeth to cauſe vs to conſider Gods power, which mightely and maruelouſly hath euer ſhewed it ſelfe in his creatures.
            
               6 In the fift verſe it is ſayd, The Lord ſaw the wickednes of man that it was great.
               
                  Verſe. 5.
                  
                He euer ſeeth both good and bad whatſoeuer it is:
                  God ſeeth all.
                neyther walls nor darkeneſſe can hinder his ſight. To the godly it is a comfort, who are many times wronged by falſe ſuſpicion, ſlanders and lyes, but the Lord ſeeth. To the wicked it muſt be a terror, and a very great one, that cloke they or couer they, hide they or hap they their ſinnes neuer ſo much, yet the Lord ſeeth. And what will hee doo? euer ſee, and neuer puniſh? then were he vniuſt, but that he cannot be for any man, therefore the end will ſmart, without repentance.
            
               7 If you doubt of this, beleeue the text which telleth vs what fell out when God ſawe it would be no better,
                  Verſe. 6.
                  
                
               it repented him that euer he had made man, that is, ſpeaking after the manner of men. God deſtroyed man, and in that as it were did diſauow him to be his creature. And marke withall how liuely the Lorde doth diſcouer the corruption that is in vs, ſaying, all our imaginations,
                  Verſe 5.
                  
                and all our cogitations are euill, and only euill, and euer euill.
                  Mans corruption how great.
                What greater euill then in this ſort and meaſure to be euill? Where is that free will that wilfull men deuiſe to do good, when our mould and mettall is become thus bad? Away with ſuch dreames, experience is the fooles ſchoolemaiſter, and ſhall not euen that teach vs, but will we gayneſay our owne knowledge? Auſten telleth vs, and all the world, that homo male vtens libero arbitrio, &amp; ſe &amp; ipſum perdidit: man abuſing that freewill which before his fall he had, he loſt both himſelfe and it. We are naught waking, we are naught ſleeping, we are ſinfull dreaming, and when we do not dreame, and where is our good?
            
               
               8 Somewhat conceyue of the meaſure of ſinne that was now in the earth, by theſe ſpeeches of God, that he repented,
               
                  The meaſure of ſin then how great.
                and that he was ſory in his heart. Could a ſmall meaſure make God thus greeued? No, he dayly indureth great wickednes, and yet repenteth not that he made man: wherefore this muſt teach vs their ſinne was great, and warne vs agayne to beware, at the leaſt with great ſinne to offend the Lord. If we cannot but ſinne through our imperfection, yet let vs not increaſe the meaſure without remorſe by any wicked malice. But ſtay to go on, if wee cannot ſtay to go in. Stop the courſe as the Lord ſhall inable, and not by fulneſſe of meaſure, as this people did heere pull vengeance from heauen whether God will or no. O heauye day and houre to you or me, if the Lord ſhall ſay, it repenteth me that I haue made ſuch an one, yea, I am ſory, and ſory at my heart for it. Beware then of great ſinnes, and of heaping ſinne vpon ſinne, till God be driuen to ſay thus againſt you. The contrary is ſweet, when the Lord reioyceth at our beeing, and ſhall ſay to Satan, haſt thou marked my ſeruant Iob, ſuch a man, ſuch a woman, how they loue me, &amp;c.
            
               9 But why was the Lord ſory that he had made man? ſurely becauſe he muſt deſtroy him againe, his ſinne is ſo great. Why then he is ſory to deſtroy man. Truth it is,

                if he could with iuſtice chooſe. O then what ſee wee? Cannot God proceed to puniſhment of rebellious ſinners, yea of ſuch rebellious ſinners as theſe were, that made the whole earth ſmell of their ſinnes, but with ſome griefe, with ſome diſcontent, with ſome 
                  •
               othnes as it were to haue it ſo if they would amend, and ſhall he be haſtie and furious, implacable &amp; vnmerciful to a poore ſinner that groneth &amp; greueth, ſigheth &amp; ſobbeth▪ wepeth &amp; crieth for wo that he doth ſin,
                  O comfort to an heauie ſpirit.
                and that he cannot but ſin againſt ſo good a God, &amp; ſo deere a Father, and wiſheth it better euery day he riſeth, and euery night he goeth to bed? No no it cannot be. And therefore be of good comfort thou greeued ſpirit, the Lord loueth thy longing care to ſerue him better, and he can ſooner ceaſe to be God, which is impoſſible, then caſt away his eyes of mercy and pitie from thee. He will not puniſh thee, but he luſteth to exerciſe thee, that the glory of thy faith

after ſuch aſſault appearing bright, may receyue a Crowne of comfort brighter then golde or beaten golde, beſet with precious ſtone:

               10 In the ſeuenth verſe the Lord ſayth I will deſtroy. Before we noted his mercifull ſtriuing to bring to repentance,
                  Verſe 7.
                  
                but now note his iuſtice if man will not repent,
                  God iuſt.
                he beareth long, and ſaith turne, turne: but at laſt he catcheth his ſword, and ſayth, I will deſtroy. Tempt not the Lord therefore ouerlong you vnfeeling hearts, for you ſee a fear
                  •
               . Many times admoniſhed, and neuer amended, thinke you heare this word, I will deſtroy.

               11 In the eyght verſe it is ſayd, But Noe found grace in the eyes of the Lord.
               
                  So God iuſt that euer mercifull, and contrary.
                So then God puniſheth, that euer yet he ſpareth ſome. So is hee iuſt that hee forgetteth not his mercy. He ſpareth Noe and his houſehold with him, and that in mercy. Gratiam inuenit, non meriti mercedem. Grace he founde, but no reward of merit. Yet what God giueth him, we may not deny him, he was a iuſt man, and vpright in his time, and walked with God. A ſingular prayſe in ſo corrupt an age to be ſo vnlike them. Would God it might teach vs the prayſe of this, not to be caryed away with corruptions amongſt vs, be they neuer ſo generall, or ſo imbraced of the greateſt men. To walke with God is a precious prayſe,
                  Multitude or cuſtom.
                though none do it but my ſelfe, and to walke with man, with the world, with a Towne or Pariſh in wicked wayes, is a deadly ſinne, though millions do it. Iuſtice and vprightneſſe will abide the touch, when craft and diſſembling will be diſcerned droſſe. Noe in this wicked time, and in this vniuerſalitie of ſinning, was a iuſt man and vpright, and walked with God, do they all what they would, he would not follow thē, and let vs marke it.
            
               12 In the 24. verſe, and ſo to the end of the Chapter, direction is giuen to Noe how he ſhould be ſaued,
                  Verſe 24.
                  
                euen in an Arke, which he is commanded to make to that purpoſe. The preſcription you ſee, and euery particular as they lye. Let me tell you the reſemblance that hath bin made by ſome, peraduenture not vnfitly.
                  The reſemblance of the Ark.
                
               Noe ſay they was a fit figure of our Sauiour Chriſt, for in him was fulfilled moſt effectually that which was ſayd of Noe in

the fift Chapter the 29. verſe, Lamech begat a ſonne, and called his name Noah, ſaying: this ſame ſhall comfort vs concerning our worke, and ſorow of our hands, as touching the earth which the Lord hath curſſed. The Arke a figure of the Church, for as out of that there was no ſafetie, ſo out of the Church there is no ſaluation. The matter of it muſt not be euery thing, but of Pine trees direction was giuen. The children of the Church are not euery ſort, not they which are borne of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man,
               
                  Iohn. 1.13.
                
               but of God. The Pitch repreſented the loue of the Church, wherewith as with glew the members are vnited and faſtned together. Within and without the Arke was pitched, and within and without a true member of the Church is vnfayned loue. He loueth within, he loueth without, he loueth without, and he loueth within, it is not ſecret and cannot be ſeene, it is not ſeene outward and wanteth within, but truth and ſhow, and ſhow and truth go together in this man. O bleſſed pitch, would God we were all thus pitched, for the more of this cleaueth to our fingers, the better we. It defileth not, but maketh vs holy before the Lord. In the Arke were diuers roomes, and in the Church are diuers gifts, diuers orders, and degrees of men. In the heauen we ſeeke for diuers manſions. In the Arke are beaſts vncleane, aſwell as cleane, and in the true Church and of the true Church, hee that denyeth ſinners to be, ſhall prooue an Anabaptiſt. The window they ſay might repreſent the Goſpell, and the preaching thereof, for as by that window came light into the Arke to lighten their bodyes, ſo by the preaching of the Goſpell commeth light into the Church to lighten the hart, and minde, and vnderſtanding of thoſe that are within. The dore, Chriſt. I am the dore, and ſo as foloweth. The Arke was great and very great. So is the Church of great largeneſſe, diſperſed by God both farre and wide. Reade the 54. of Eſay 2. Reioyce thou barren that beareſt not, &amp;c. inlarge thy tents. &amp;c. The flood reſembled Baptiſme, which killeth the ould man, and reſtoreth the new▪ 
               while the Arke was preparing ſayth S. Peter, whereby eight ſoules were ſaued in the water,

               whereof the baptiſme that now is, anſwering that figure &amp;c. ſaueth vs alſo by the reſurrection

of Ieſus Chriſt. Finally and laſtly, the Arke was toſſed in thoſe waues of water both vp and downe, and ſo is the Church whilſt it heere is militant, too and fro. Yea euery member doth witneſſe this, toſſed of the world, toſſed of fleſh, toſſed of Satan, and toſſed by ſinne, neuer able to hould together, if God, as he did the Arke, did not defend it, guide it, and keepe it, and gouerne the waues, that they ſhall not hurt further then in mercy he will heale againe. This is the figure of the Arke, and ſumme of this Chapter.
         
         
            Chap. 7.
            
                Hauing heard in the former Chapter the ſinne of man in thoſe dayes, and the gratious ſtriuing of God with him to bring him to amendment, geuing euen then, when he might iuſtly haue puniſhed, yet an hundred and twenty yeares to repentance. In this Chapter we ſhall ſee how all this goodnes of God was deſpiſed and neglected, thoſe hundred and twenty yeares in all wickedneſſe likewiſe ſpent, and therefore God forced as it were at laſt to bring the flood vpon them. The generall heads may be theſe two.

                     The entrance of Noah into the Arke.
                     The comming of the flood vpon all fleſh.

               1 
               COncerning the firſt, it is to be obſerued that God biddeth him enter into the Arke,
               
                  Noah entred commanded.
                thereby giuing his faith that ſure ſtay of the word, without which it muſt needs haue wauered, and bin ſhaken in pieces in that great tryall. And Noah his not entring till he was bidden, teacheth vs truly to take God for our guide in all our actions, and his word for our warrant and aſſurance in what we go about.
            
               2 The Lord ſayth, he ſaw Noah righteous in that age before him,
               
                  Verſe 1.
                  
                not meaning thereby that Noah wanted weakenes of humane imperfections,
                  Such God taketh vs as we will to

Then were all the fountaines of the great deepe broken vp, and the windowes of heauen were opened, heauen and earth agreeing together to accompliſh Gods will, and to deſtroy mankinde.

                thereby declaring, that by his diuine power they were only ſaued, and the Arke kept whole againſt all dangers, and inſinuating to vs the like cauſe of all our ſafetie euermore. It is not our houſe, our Caſtle, or tower when we go to bed that ſaueth vs, but that the Lord ſhutteth the dores, and cloſeth vs in, this is our ſuretie, that no power can withſtand whatſoeuer it wiſheth, this is our ſafetie, that wee may truſt vnto. Were the

gates of the citie iron or braſſe, if he ſhut them not, they wil neuer hould out, but were they wood or clay, made ſtrong by his defending mercy, no canon can batter them▪ nor man get them open to hurt any within, whome the Lord will haue ſafe, and to that end hath ſhut within them.

                But whether man periſhed eternally or no, that is the queſtion, I meane all that were drowned in the flood, whether were they alſo condemned to hell, and ſo periſhed that way? we may anſwere truly, that it becommeth duſt and aſhes to leaue Gods ſecrets to himſelf: but for the argument,
                  Like puniſhment in this life doth not argue lyke in the next world.
                that therfore it ſhould ſeeme ſo becauſe they taſted of his outward iudgement alike, it foloweth not: for the two theeues crucifyed with our Sauiour, had like outward puniſhment, and yet not one inward condemnation. Many dye the deaths of ſeuerall offences, and yet are ſaued by mercy in the world to come. God forbid we ſhould cenſure men ſo, as to conclude their eternall death vpon their temporall ſuffrings. We may not do it: well may wee learne by theſe words (that all things periſhed) that if nothing could help it ſelfe when God was angry,
                  Truſt in nothing to ſaue if god do frowne
                what ſhall it be that ſhal haue ſtrength to helpe vs, and ſheeld vs from his wrath? may the ſtrength of a Gyant, gold, ſiluer, horſes, wiſedome▪ or any thing do it? no, all theſe things in this flood could not profit any thing the owners of them, and ſo ſhall it euer bee, therfore truſt not to them.
            
               11 The rayne from aboue, and the fountaynes beneath, are things we cannot lack, yet ſee we in this place how they made a flood.
                  Gods fauour and anger changeth the vſe to vs of creatures.
                Learne we then by it what a great difference Gods fauour and anger make in the ſame creatures. If in fauour he rayne, we are nuriſhed by it: if in anger he do it, we are deſtroyed: ſo is it with the fire, with the aire, with our meates &amp; drinks, and whatſoeuer we vſe in this mortall life, his mercy maketh, &amp; his wrath marreth the ſame thing. O how ſhould wee then valew Gods fauour? how ſhould wee ſeeke to haue it, and feare to looſe it. Pray we when we riſe, and pray we when we ſleepe, that his creatures we may enioy in fauour euer.

                Yet ſay the wicked in the Prophet Malachie, It is vayne to ſerue the Lord, there is no profit in it. But wee ſee the contrary in this place and euer. If the Lords wrath be kindled neuer ſo little, bleſſed are all they that truſt in him. When mountaynes and hills,

perils, he ſeeth their dangers, and in his due time he remembreth to releeue and releaſe them, as he did heere Noah and his family. Can the Bride forget her ornaments, nay can the Mother forget her childe: theſe things be hard, and eaſily are not done, yet ſuppoſe they might be done, the Lord for all that cannot forget his, who making him their God, he hath made his ſeruants,

God forbid, and as we feare God, let vs thinke of it, for he that ſo ſoone could alter in his anger the eſtate of the whole world, that of a place ſo full of reſt for thouſands thouſands of creatures, now there ſhould bend reſt for the foote of one doue, ſurely he can change as quickly the ſeate of any Prince, or noble, or genleman, or other man, that all the honor and comforts beeing wiped away in wrath, there ſhould not be reſt for any, but a fearefull ſight of horror and confuſion vpon euill deſerts.
            
               10 The Arke to the doue was like a priſon, a place of reſtraint, &amp; not according to her kind,
                  Verſe. 9.
                  
                which was to flye abrode, yet finding no reſt,
                  Better an inconuenience then a miſchiefe.
                rather then ſhe will periſh, ſhe returneth to the ſame againe. It may teach vs this, that better is an inconuenience then a miſchiefe. If we cannot as we would, we muſt as we can. I ſpeake it againſt all heatheniſh and vnchriſtianlike impatiencie. The heathens rather then they would ſerue, they would kill them ſelues. And many in theſe dayes, rather then they wil ſuffer what God impoſeth, will do what God deteſteth, let it not be ſo. If we cannot be abrode and at libertie, becauſe Gods iudgement againſt ſinne hath taken away our footing in ſuch or ſuch ſort, whilſt it ſhall pleaſe him, let vs be content, returne as the doue did to the place appointed, and thanke him for mercy euen in that, that yet there we liue, and are not deſtroyed as others haue been.
            
               11 Noah ſtayed vpon this 7. dayes, and then ſent out the doue againe ſayth the text▪

                which returned to him in the euening, bringing in her mouth an oliue leafe which ſhe had pluckt, wherby Noe knew the waters were abated. This doue may note the preachers alſo of the word again,

                who bring in their mouths ſome good tidings to the Arke, that is to the Church, and euery good news may be cōpared alſo to an oliue leafe, &amp; the tellers to doues. That good news yt the women brought to ye diſciples that Chriſt was riſen,
                  Matt. 28.8.
                was like an oliue leafe in their mouth, &amp; they like this doue in this place: ſo all others. Reade 2. King. 7. of ye good news of the lepers, &amp; 2. Sam. 18.27. he is a good man, ſayth Dauid, &amp; commeth with good tidings: ſo good men &amp; women haue words

of comfort in their mouths, when others haue the poyſon of aſpes vnder their toongs, they haue oliue leaues to cheare vp Noah and his company withall, when others haue wormewood and gall to make their harts ake with the bitternes thereof. Such doues God make vs euermore, &amp; if this be regarded of vs, we will indeuor it.

                  The difference of a good ſeruant and a bad.
                Firſt marke the often ſending of the doue, when the rauen goeth but once. It ſheweth the difference of a good ſeruant and a bad. The firſt is often vſed, becauſe he is faithfull and true, the later but once, becauſe then he is found to be a rauen, more heeding the carions that his nature regardeth, then performing his meſſage which his ſender deſireth. The prayſe of theſe two fowles, how they differ in this place for their ſeruice, we all ſee, and it ſhould thus profit vs, as to pricke vs to the good, and afray vs from the euill. In ſome place or other we are all ſeruants as theſe fowles were, to God, to Prince, to Mayſters, to ſome or other. Let vs be doues that they may often vſe vs, let vs not be rauens▪ that they may iuſtly refuſe vs. Secondly in the doues not returning any more let vs marke a type of the ſaints of God,
                  A type of the godly.
                that hauing ſundry times diſcharged the truſt of their places, as the doue did, at laſt haue their departure out of the arke, that is, out of this life and Church militant, and finding reſt for their foote in Gods bleſſed kingdome, returne no more to the Arke againe, but then continue and abide for euer.

                and all creatures with thee. So we ſee there is no affliction or triall yt God impoſeth vpō his childrē, but if they indure it quietly, truſt in his mercy firmely, &amp; tary his good pleaſure obediently, it hath his cōfortable end.

                ſhewed himſelf appeaſed, and his anger at reſt: this pietie was in Noahs heart before, but now it ſmelleth, when it breaketh into worke: ſo was Abraham for his faith noted of God before, but when that faith flamed out into a willingnes to ſacrifice his deere ſonne, then God cried out, now, now, I ſee Abraham thy loue &amp;c. Surely that which powning and beating is to ſpice, works be to faith in ſome reſemblance: the ſpice is ſweet before it be brayed, but when it is brayed, much more: ſo is faith in the heart accepted of God, before oportunitie ſerue to worke, but when oportunitie doth ſerue, and holy works come to a godly faith, then ſmelleth it maruelouſly, and the Lord ſauoreth a reſt to his owne good liking, and our true comfort for euer and euer: let it teach vs, let

By which ſo dooing of the Lord, firſt we learne the antiquitie of the mercie, in adding outwarde ſignes to confirme man by: Secondly the vſe of them. The antiquitie if it had beene no more but from Noah it had been much, but we ſee it was before, euen in Paradiſe to Adam, there was the Tree of Life, and the tree of the Knowledge of good and euill. The one aſſuring him if he obeyed, he ſhould liue, and the other if he ſinned, that he ſhould die. A mercy ſo long continued to his children ſhould bee greatlye regarded with hartie thankes for it▪ The vſe of ſuch outwarde ſignes is not to confirme God in his promiſe, who though hee neuer added anye ſeale, yet would bee moſt true in his worde, but to confirme vs in the beleefe of that promiſe, which of it ſelfe and in it ſelfe is moſt immooueable. For though he be true to performe, yet wee are weake to beleeue, and a gratious God hee is that will ſo ſupport vs. Againe, the Rainbowe is taken as a figure of Chriſt,
                  An allegorie of the Rainebow.
                and therefore wee thereby taught, that when either the darke blackneſſe of vglye ſinne, or the thicke cloudes of greefe and aduerſitie, doe threaten vnto vs any fearefull ouerthrowe, wee ſhould clap our eyes ſtreight vpon our Rainebowe Chriſt Ieſus, and bee aſſured that though that blackneſſe of ſinne be neuer ſo great, yet in him and by him it ſhall bee doone awaye, and neue

                teacheth vs two things. Firſt to do well to

euery one as we can, knowing that though when we doo it, they to whome we do it, know it not, regarde it not, eſteeme it not, nor vs for it, as being drunke with anger, malice, youthfull temerity, and ſuch like, yet a wakening time may come, when they may do otherwiſe, ſee the good and bleſſe vs for it, whilſt we liue, and the very memory of vs when we be dead. Secondly as in figure it may tell vs, that the godly ſin not to death, but though they ſleepe they awake againe, though they ſlip, yea fall quite downe, yet they recouer and riſe againe, euen ſeauen times a day. A great comfort when I am downe, but no imboldning to fall downe.
         
         
            Chap. 10.
            
               THis chapter wholy conſiſteth in a deſcription of the propagation of mankinde,
                  Verſe. 1.
                  
                by the poſteritie of Noah,
               
                  Gods power &amp; mans forgetfulnes.
                after they were now releaſed from the Flud, wherein all fleſh but they, was periſhed: which great increaſe in ſo ſhorte a time, noteth vnto vs the wonderfull power of God, and diſcouereth alſo what moſt vnkinde forgetfulneſſe of the Lordes goodneſſe to their fathers, but as it were yeſterday, was crepte ſo quickely into ſome of them.
            
               2 With Sem and Iapheth is curſſed Cham, telling vs,
                  In the Church good and bad.
                that this outward militant church hath hir blots and wrinckles in hir: not onely in reſpect of the godly, whoſe regeneration is not finiſhed till they dye, but in reſpect alſo of the euill that are mixed and mingled with the good, betwixt Sem and Iapheth, two good men, Cham a caytife hath a place in the world.
            
               3 Cham was yoonger, and ſo euer is falſhood later then truth, ſinne later then innocencie, and euill later then good,
                  Truth elder then falſehood.

                  Oppreſſion howe ould.
               
               4 Nimrod a tyrant ſtarteth vp in this Chapter. When? when he waxed mightie. Ancient therefore is oppreſſion and crueltie, and the abuſe of Gods bleſſings: when God hath increaſed a man in power and wealth, then moſt is hee bounde to ſerue him for it, but quite contrarie it is, the mightier the worſe, and the richer the crueller to oppreſſe the weake ones. Read the 2. of Chron. 26.16. and Deutro. 6.10. verſe.
            
               5 His tyrannye is compared to Hunting, and the tyrant to a hunter.
                  Verſe. 9.
                  
                Hunting hath ſnares, nets, dogges, and diggings of deepe ditches,
                  Tyrannie compared to hunting
                ſpyings, and pryings, watchings and wardings, and euer the death of the creature hunted is the game. Tyranny and oppreſſion hath the like, if yee liſt to compare them, at leaſt in this they ioyne full iuſt, the partie hunted muſt dye at laſt. But ſuch Nimrods, ſuch tyrants, ſuch hunters God ſeeth, and ſuch huntings of the poore till they haue their bloud, God in his iuſtice together with the hunters, will repaye.
            
               
                  Sinne groweth by cuſtome
               
               6 In that it is ſayde Nimrod was ſuch an one before the Lord. It noteth the nature of ſinne and cuſtome, to wit, to gather ſtrength by continuance, and at laſt not to feare, euen the face of God, nor his holy eyes to looke vpon it. Cuſtome of ſinning taketh away the feeling of ſinne, and therefore if we ſtay not to doe euill before man, at laſt it will be ſayde of vs as of Nimrod
               ▪ that euen before God we are become hunters, that is, we are growne to an impudencie and boldneſſe of ſinning.
            
               
                  In euery towne a Nimrod great or little.
               
               7 As Nettles then Roſes be of greater increaſe, and bad weedes multiply apace. ſo ſpred this iniquitie further then vertue, and filled the world with ſuch fruite dayly. To this day they fructifie in a full meaſure, and what towne is that almoſt in the world, that hath not a Nimrod one or two at the leaſt in it. That is, a harde, a cruell, a greedy, and couetous man, that grindeth the faces of his neighbours, till both ſkinne and fleſh being of the bare

bones, do onely remaine. I ſay no more, yet thinke you more of it that reade it.
            
               8 Though we ſee heere diuiſions of Countreys made amongſt them, and ſome dwelling here, ſome there, as they liked, yet one bloud remained amongſt them, as a knot euer to ioyne them, what diſtance of place ſoeuer ſeuered them. And is it not ſo ſtill, though longer time &amp; larger increaſe haue ſpred it further? Surely it is ſo, we cannot deny: and therefore this bond of bloud, ſtock, houſe, linage, and kinred in roote, though I ſaye the degrees bee far, ſhould continue regarde one of an other, and loue more then is. Likewiſe trading and traphiking, helping and releeuing with mutuall interchange of commodities one of another, deſire of traueling no leſſe one to finde out and knowe an other, what diſtance of place ſoeuer doth ſeperate. For we be all as we ſee of one bloud and parent. And ſhould a man placed in France ſay adewe for euer, and in all reſpect of affeccion, care, and loue to his houſe in England, out of which he deſcended? Then might he iuſtly be accompted vnnaturall, curriſh &amp; vnkinde, aboue the courſe of a good man: ſurely euen ſo in the other, and thus profit by it: for men are not to be thought of, onely according to far or neere dwelling, but according to the roote from which they deſcended.
            
               9 Againe when we read this chapter, remember Chams curſſe by his father, in the former chapter,
                  Earthly glory no true token of Gods fauour.
                and then marke his worldly eſtate layd downe in this, and ſee howe the one may agree with the other. There I ſaye hee was curſſed, and heere he ſeemeth more bleſſed then any of them: for his Children are many, the place of his dwelling moſt fruitfull, pleaſant and fertile. Now he that hath ſo great a poſteritie, as eleuen ſonnes, ſo ſweete a portion of the earth as he had, with all the circumſtances of theſe two worldlye felicities, how is he curſſed? ſurely euen as the wicked vſually are curſſed, not by denyall of outwarde bleſſings, but by a taking from them of heauenly fauour: wherefore learne by it this ſecret euer, that in earth they floriſh with earthlye pleaſures many a time, whome GOD hath marked neuer to loue, but to carrye his curſſe for euermore. Feare not therefore though one be made riche, and the glorye of his houſe bee increaſed,
                  Pſal. 49.
                for the

fauour of God conſiſteth not in theſe things, but for all them hee may be a Cham, and his fathers curſſe ſetled vpon him, and his ſeede. Bleſſed are the people (ſaith the Pſalme) that be in ſuch a caſe, hauing relation to outward bleſſings named before, but then followeth after as a correction of the former: yea rather bleſſed are they that haue the Lorde for theyr God: noting the former to bee but bleſſings in reſpect, and the later onely the true and certaine happineſſe of any fleſh. See alſo how euen in thoſe daies to iudge of the eſtate of the wicked, and godlye, they had neede to enter into the Sanctuarie of God, for if they went by outwarde ſhowe either of the one or of the other, they ſhould be deceyued, as alſo nowe.
            
               10 But why dooth Moſes mention ſo carefully and preciſely the borders or limits of Chanaan or of the Canaanites? Certainlye it was by the guiding of Gods holy Spirite in reſpect of the church and children of God,
                  The wicked often prouiders for others that ſhalbe better then they.
                to whom after it ſhould be giuen, that they might know them the better. Where marke we the depth of Gods hidden and ſecret prouidence, in ſuch ſorte as it peereth out and ſheweth it ſelfe vnto vs. Do wee not ſee how earthly things are giuen to the wicked, which euen then when they enioy them, by a wiſe God are appointed in his prouidence vnto others, whome he fauoureth more, and for whome he vſeth but thoſe for a time to prouide for them, and to make them readyer to theyr handes? Adore we therefore this ſecret depth, and ſay we with the Apoſtle: O the deepenes of the riches, bothe of the wiſedome and knowledge of God,

                     The confuſion of tongues, from the 1. ver. to the 10.

               1 
               TOuching the firſt, it is ſayd, that the earth was all of one language,
               
                  Verſe. 1.
                  
                and queſtion is made what that was,
                  What language was firſt.
                and whether it remained ſtill or no after the confuſion, and with whome: for the firſt, it is anſwered, that although it be vncertaine, yet probably it is coniectured, that it was the Hebrew. For ſo ſay the proper names of men and women, which remaine as yet and are Hebrew, being impoſed then and not altered by Moſes the relator into any language els. Of this iudgement is Hierom vpon the 3. of Sephon, when he calleth the Hebrew tongue the mother of all the reſt. Auguſtine thought otherwiſe, writing thus: Vnam ſane linguam primitus fuiſſe didicimus,

               antequam ſuper bia turris illius poſt diluuium fabricatae in diuerſos ſignorum ſonos humanam ſocietatem diuideret. Quae autem illa lingua fuerit, quid attinet querere. That there was one tongue in the beginning we learne, before the pride of the Towre built after the Flud, had deuided mans ſociety into diuers ſounds of words: but what tongue that was what need we aſke. To the ſecond it is anſwered, that it did remaine, being as is ſuppoſed, &amp; inioyed of vs at this day. And to the third, yt it was in the houſe &amp; family of Sem, Arphaxad,
               
                  The Chaldie tongue
                
               Selah &amp; Eber, of whom it had denomination Hebrue. Philo thinketh ye firſt tongue was the Chaldee, contrary to Hierom as was ſaid before, and Hierom to him. But ſince Arphaxad was a Prince of the Chaldeans, what hindreth that rather the Chaldee and Hebrew

ſhould not be all one at firſt, though in proceſſe of time ſome difference grew?

               2 When it is ſaid to reache vp to heauen, we may not thinke they were ſo mad as to imagine they could ſo doe,
                  Hyperbole
                but wee muſt know the manner of ſpeech to be a figuratiue amplification often vſed of men without fault, and often vſed in the ſcripture it ſelfe: when Dauid ſaith of them that ſaile on the ſeas, &amp; are occupied in great w

                he doth not meane as he ſpeaketh, that they are caried vp to ye heauens indeed, but by the ſame figure he meaneth very highe. So is the former and ſo are many moe ſpeeches in the word, which if Iulian could haue ſeene or other ſuch like prophane ſpirits, yet perceiue, their carping impietie had a faull.
            
               3 Vnitie of language was a great mercie of God, by that meanes keeping them by a notable bande knit together,
                  Vnitie of language.
                whome far diſtance of place had ſet a ſunder. And if this be a mercy that we ſpeake, as it is a great one: ſurely far greater it was that they all ſpake one ſpeech, for ſo might they continue not onely in a moſt profitable interchange of any earthly commodities, but euen alſo in a holy communion of al mercies whatſoeuer, one vnderſtanding from an other, and of another, what wonderfull good ſoeuer the Lord ſhould ſhow. Now as a puniſhment of pride the caſe is altered, and we neither in the one nor other can do as then they might But as a wonder it is at this daye, that ſpeeche being as it were the image of the minde, where mindes agree, &amp; thoughts do ioyne, ſpeech ſhould differ as now it dooth.

               4 The time of this tower built, and ſpeech confounded, may be aſked, to which, anſwer is vncertaine. There is a fragment vnder the name of Beroſus (if it ſhould not wrong him to ſay ſuche trifles be his) and there it is ſaid, that an hundred and thirty yeares after the Flud it was. Others better like to ſay, it was three hundred and 40 yeares after: ſo as I ſayde, certaintie there is none. I ſtand not vpon coniectures to ſ

                ſaying to the reſt, Come, let vs build, &amp;c. But when once it was broched not one man alowed it, but euen all full quickly yeelded to it. Whereby we ſee firſt the vileneſſe of man, not onely to deuiſe that which is naught, but to ſet it full greedily abroche when it is deuiſed, and to labour to perſwade others to imbrace and folowe the ſame. Again to conſent to that which is wickedly deuiſed of others and to make a particular concept a general iudgement, action and worke at laſt. Great cauſe therfore that mens lewd deuiſes ſhould be reſtrained from being publiſhed, ſince both the deuiſers wiſhe, and mans great corruption, is ſo prone to yeeld a wicked conſent, and folowing of the ſame.

But what was Moſes &amp; Aron that they ſhould be thus vſed of their brethren? Surely the Lords faithfull miniſters, his choſen ſerauants they were, whoſe cauſe (when he had thus exerciſed them with a trial) he tooke into his own hands, his ielouſie on their behalfe began to burne, and till hee had ſhewed a iudgement that ſhould make all eares to tingle that heare of it, &amp; all hearts, not forſaken of God, to feare how they doe the like, hee neuer left them Conclude we then vpon all thoſe that ſinne, ſome be wicked, to broache a wickedneſſe, and thouſands weake to folowe the ſame when once they heare it, yea though it be to builde a Tower againſt God, it neuer was, nor euer ſhall be, either godly pollicie, or chriſtian dutye, to ſuffer mens braines to broche what they liſt, and others to folow vnquiet deuiſes, hatefull to God and hurtfull to his Church in a high degree.

Would God this vngodly and vntowardlye regarding and deſiring of a name, had not beene before, and were to this day a cauſe to make many reiect the truth of God, which they ſhould imbrace. For times paſt, what ſaid our Sauiour in the 5 of Iohn: Howe can you beleeue which receiue glorie one of an other, and do not ſeeke that glorie that is onely of God.

O how could I runne this note to the admonition of them, that ſeeke by ſuch towers as this, not onely to get a name, but to keepe their poſteritie from diſperſion, that is, to continue thē in that countrey, in that towne, in that houſe, &amp;c. neuer ſeking the Lords fauour &amp; mercy, to direct and make ſtrong their deſires, neither euer ſeeking to plante his feare in them that muſt inioye thoſe things. But their iſſew is according: the Lord turneth all croſſe in his iudgement, and for that very thing they are diſperſed and driuen often, to forſake not onelye the place, but the verye lande. I ſaye no more, thinke what you knowe.

                as ſome thinke they did, though it bee not propable (the reaſon being expreſſed before by themſelues, to be for to get a name, &amp;c.) then may it admoniſhe vs howe bad men neuer looke at the true cauſes of Gods iudgements and plagues, but frame vnto themſelues ſome other concepts, and runne their courſe according to the ſame. The true cauſe of the Flud was ſinne,
                  Note.
                and therefore they ſhould haue ſayd: Let vs ſinne no more, leaſt a woorſe thing happen vnto vs, and not let vs builde a towre. For the cauſe bring not taken awaye, for which God ſmiteth, no towers nor ſteeples, no tops nor top gallants, though they could reache as high as was ſayde, can euer deliuer from his blowes. Let theyr folly be our inſtruction, and whilſt we liue, pray that we may, and indeuour when wee haue prayed, to ſee the true cauſe of Gods viſitation any waye, vpon vs or ours, that that being knowne, wee may take a true courſe to turne his wrath awaye from vs.

A like vnitie againe in Ioſephs brethren to deale vniuſtlye and vnkindlye with their brother. There was an vnitie in Sodom againſt Lot and his perſwaſion. And the whole worlde was one againſt Noah and his preaching. So is it heere and ſo is it often, the people are one, but not in truth, not in right, not in GOD, and what vnitie is that. Be wee not then as I ſayde, amazed at a name, wee knowe who crye, vnitie, vnitie, but wee ſee no proofe nor euer ſhall, of veritie. And wee knowe the Fathers ſpeeche, who ſpake it trulye, Vnitas ſine veritate proditio eſt, Vnitie without veritie is but a conſpiracie.

            Chap. 12. 
            
               The generall heads of this Chapter are cheefely three.

                     The calling of Abraham, from the 1. ver. to the 4.
                     His obedience to that calling, from the 4, to the 8.

                God: and thereby learne wee, that it is the Lordes worke, onely to gather hi

                a church, to appoint before all times, whome hee will call in time, and make a member of the ſame. What man dooth in the gathering of the ſame, he do

               2 Conſider whome he calls, Abraham the yonger brother,
                  God looketh not at merit in his calling
                and peraduenture an idolater, more like ſo then otherwiſe, though vncertayne. And ſee we by it that Gods choyſe is free, not tyed to circumſtances of age, of birth, of degree, or any qualitie in man whatſoeuer: but on whome hee will haue mercy,
               
                  Rom. 9.
                
               on them hee will haue mercy. He looketh not as man looketh, for man many times regardeth the elder brother before the yonger, and the outward gift of nature before inward graces of the ſpirit, as Iſhai offred his eldeſt to Samuel to be anoynted King, and all the reſt before he offred Dauid, thinking leaſt of him whome yet God appoynted. And Ioſeph would haue had his father layd his right hande vpon his eldeſt ſonne Manaſſes. But God doth not ſo, finding nothing in the beſt to deſerue a calling, and therefore vſing his libertie without all reſpect of circumſtances as I ſayde before.
            
               3 Whence was he called? euen out of his owne countrey,
               
                  All muſt be forſaken to follow God.
                
               and from his fathers houſe. Teaching vs firſt thereby, that neyther Father, Mother, countrey, nor any thing, may be ſticked vnto aboue Gods commandement, for hee that loueth any of theſe things more then me, ſayth the Lord, is vnworthy of me. In the Pſalme it is ſayd to the Church &amp; to euery member of it,
                  45.11.
                
               Harken O daughter and conſider, incline thine eare, forget alſo thine owne people, and thy fathers houſe: ſecondly admoniſhing vs what a perilous thing countrey impietie is,
                  Countrey impietie perilous.
                able to infect any man if he tary in it. And therefore God draweth Abraham away from them, becauſe with them he ſhould hardly euer haue been good.
            
               4 Whether did God call him, ſurely to no certayne place, but from his owne, to ſome ſtrange place,
                  Be not curious when God doth call.
                which he would apoynt vnto him, thereby making tryall of his loue ſo much the more, by how much he knew no certayne place wherevnto to go. It teacheth vs aboue hope, vnder hope, to cleaue vnto God, and i

               5 To what end doth he call him? ſurely that he might make

of him a mightie Nation,

                that hee might bleſſe him, make his name great, and bring to paſſe that in his ſeede, that is in Chriſt, who ſhoulde deſcende of him, that bleſſing might bee recouered which was loſt in Adam, and ſo all the Nations of the world be bleſſed. So ſee wee playne how Gods dealings ſhoote euer at the good, and to the good of them whom hee loueth, and who obey him &amp; are ruled by him. Many a man hath he drawen from home and out of his owne countrey, but to his great good both in body and minde. In body, by honors, preferments and earthly bleſſings many, wherewith hee hath inriched him in a ſtrange place. In minde, by a true knowledge of his holy truth there attayned vnto and got, which otherwiſe in likelyhood had neuer beene. How preferred hee Ioſeph in a ſtrange lande, with many mo, &amp;c. But marke how the Lord expreſſeth his fauour further, when he ſaith, I will alſo bleſſe them that bleſſe thee, and I will curſe them that curſe thee,

               6 How did God call him? by his word: and by this word at this day he calleth vs,
                  God calleth by his word.
                ſending vs his meſſengers earely and late to ſpeake vnto vs, and to intreate vs as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in his name, that we would be reconciled to him, not dye but liue, and inioy a place of eternall comfort for euermore, with his owne ſelfe, his ſonne, his holy ſpirit, one God of maieſtie, glory and power, with angells, archangells, Saints and Martirs, the ſpirits of iuſt and perfect men. To day then, or any day when we heare his voyce, harden we not our hearts, neyther deſpiſe him that ſpeaketh Chriſt Ieſus.
                  Heb. 12.25.
                For if they eſcaped not that refuſed him that ſpake on earth (to wit Moſes) how much more ſhall we not eſcape, if wee turne away from him that ſpeaketh from heauen, whoſe voyce then ſhooke the earth, and now hath declared ſaying, yet once more will I ſhake not the earth only, but alſo the heauen, &amp;c.

For what a doo would ſome of vs haue made at ſuch a motion, what folly, what madneſſe would we haue accompted it, to leaue a place we knew and euer had liued in, to go we could not tell whether. But ſo did not Abraham, he obeyed to go, and to leaue all, yea hee obeyed to leaue all, and goe hee knewe not whether. Marke therefore I pray you the nature of true faith, and the meaſure of it in Abraham, it wreſtleth, it ſtriueth, it ouer commeth at laſt all obiections of fleſh and bloud, and yeeldeth a holy and ſweet obedience to the commandement will and pleaſure of almightie God: ſuch faith ſhall honor vs, as it honored Abraham, if being in vs for our meaſure, there ſhall flow from it ſuch dutifull obedience to our God, as occaſion ſhall be offered, and we called to now, wherefore euer let vs thinke of it.

                I pray you let vs remember euer that it was vpon a word, commanding hym and calling hym as hath been ſayde, and not vpon his owne head. The fourth verſe ſayth hee departed, but how? as the Lord ſpake vnto hym, ſayth the text, &amp;c. Cutting thereby and therein the combes of all momiſh Monks that apply his example to their bad dooings, and their leauing of friends, as they ſaye, and Fathers houſe, to his example. For Abraham was commaunded, they not. Abraham had cauſe, leaſt hee ſhould bee ſeduced by his idolatrous kinred and countrey, they not. Abraham knewe not whether he went, they full well. Abraham carryed his wife with him, and left her not, they not ſo in any caſe. Therefore you ſee how well this example fitteth them, and how iuſtly they reſemble it.

                He liued 175. in all. And ſo it appeareth that a whole hundred yeares he was a traueller, and poſſeſt not the breadth of a foote as Steuen ſayth of all that was promiſed to him, and yet his faith fayled not, but by the ſame he abode ſayth the Apoſtle in the land of promiſe as in a ſtrange countrey, &amp;c. when we farre vnlike him faynt, and are greeued with euery litle delay in the Lords doings.

                or to hinder him from that wherevnto the Lord had called him. But ſhe truſſeth vp and away with him whither God ſhould apoynt, knowing his lot to be her lot in well or wo: taking her ſelfe called when her huſband is called, as if ſhe had by name bin expreſſed, becauſe God is no ſeperater of man and wife, whome himſelfe hath ioyned till death depart. O honorable Sara for this obedience, without croſſing, gaine ſaying, contrarying, repining and murmuring: being a comfort and incouragement to her huſband to obey his calling, and no daſher, no cooler, no pulback, no hindrance, no carnall perſwader to the contrary, nor yet any pidling Lots wife, either all day ere ſhe can ſet out, or yet looking back when ſhe is in her iourney. What a prayſe is this for all faithfull wiues to aime at whilſt they lyue.

               11 Thus hauing conſidered both Gods calling, and Abrahams obedience, thinke we in the third place of the croſſes that accompanyed this faithfull couple, Abraham and Sara in theyr iourney. Their remoues are diuers, which cary euer ſome griefs. There ariſeth a famine, a double triall in a ſtrange place frō that it is at home, where a man being knowne and friended, hath many helps. Then ſmiteth a feare ye hart of Abraham that for his wife he ſhould be killed amongſt vngodly men that feared not God, a great croſſe. This feare droue him to a ſhift that was a greater croſſe to indanger his wife and her vertue for the ſafetie of him, which euen that way alſo could be but vncertayne. The concept was accompliſhed, and his wife was taken from him to bee Pharohs
               
wife, a helliſh wound to the harts of both Abraham and Sarah. And what ſhal we note in al this,
                  The lot of the godly.
                but firſt the lot of the godly through many feares, many troubles, many tryalls, many gripes and greefes to paſſe along this life toward the kingdome of reſt and ioy, with him whoſe ſeruants we are to abide whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe him to exerciſe vs withall: true obedience to almightie God in any thing, wanting no croſſes more or leſſe in this world euer to wait vpon it. Secondly we may note againe the weakeneſſe of Gods choſen many times, not of the ſmalleſt faith and place in Gods Church, but euen of the greateſt accompt and ſeruice. For in our great Father Abraham,
               
                  The weakneſſe of chiefe pillers in Gods Church.
                what a blot was this to cauſe his wife to make a lye, to denye her mariage, and to caſt her ſelfe into ſuch danger, and himſelfe into ſuch griefe, as that courſe did? but this is our mould &amp; mettall, and theſe are the wants of great ones often times. Glory we not therefore of fleſh euer, for it is too full of imperfection, neyther commit we the like folly euer for any feare.
            
               12 But was Sarah wronged by this wicked King? no, but when mans ſtrength fayled,
                  17
                
               
                  God ſteppeth in to ſaue Sarah
                and both Abraham and Sarah were euen at the pits brinke of great ſhame and violence, God ſteppeth in, &amp; taketh the defence of thoſe poore ſtrangers vpon him againſt a mighty King, and ſaueth Sarah from all hurt. He plagued Pharoh and his houſe with great plagues till ſhe was reſtored to her huſband againe. Shewing thereby that he neuer fayleth to conſider the croſſes, griefes, wrongs and iniuries of his children, but euer watcheth ouer them, and for them, euer prouideth and eateth to deliuer them ſo farfoorth as ſhall be good for them, to the great incoragement of all vs that ſee it and marke it, to truſt in him, and euer to ſerue him.

So ſhall the man be bleſſed that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth his word, and foloweth his commandement, calling him whether it pleaſeth him. All his troubles ſhould by Gods prouidence bee ended and turned to his good. God ſhall be for him in the midſt of his enemyes as a ſure refuge. And what ſhould we ſay, or what can we ſay more truly and fitly in this place, then as the Prophet Dauid ſayd, Many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord deliuereth them out of them all.

Abraham is fauored for Sarahs ſake, ſo were Iaakob and his family for Ioſephs ſake. Pharoh is plagued till he deliuered Sarah, ſo was both king and countrey afterward till the Iſraelites were let go.

                The eſpeciall heads of this Chapter are theſe.

                     The welth of theſe 2 mē Abr. &amp; Lot, frō the 1.v. to the 7.
                     The diſſention betwixt them from the 7. to the 14.
                     The iteration of Gods promiſe from the 14. to the end.
                  
               
            
            
               THe wealth of them ſheweth that riches alſo ſomtimes are beſtowed vpon the godly,
                  Verſe 2.
                  
                ſuch as ſhall be heires and inheritors of the peereleſſe ioyes of euerlaſting life.
                  Riches giuen to the godly.
                And therefore though it be hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of God, and euen eaſier for a camell to go through the eye of a nedle, yet it is not impoſſible, but God with whome all things are poſſible, can bring it to paſſe.
            
               2 It teacheth vs that euen with wealth a man may be godly, and folow his vocation, to the good liking of almightie God, and the diſcharge of himſelfe, in ſuch meaſure as humane frailtie permitteth, for neither Abraham nor Lot are hindred heereby from pleaſing God. Needleſſe therefore it was, and but a Philoſophicall folly or pang, that Crates caſt his money into the Sea, and ſayde, Ego te mergam, ne mergar a te. I will drowne thee, leaſt I bee drowned of thee: for with money and many worldly bleſſings moe a man may ſerue God, as heere Abraham and Lot dyd. Or that our holye Monks thought (at leaſt made the common people thinke) that the touching of money woulde

defile them, and the not touching or dealing with it was great puritie and holyneſſe. There is no ſuch matter wee ſee by theſe two great ſeruants of God. But there is a rule which wee may farre better folow, and in deede ought to folow, layd downe by the ſpirit of God in the Prophet Dauid, to wit, If riches increaſe, ſet not thy hart vpon them, &amp;c. Vſe them we may, but loue them we cannot without a fault. That which is ſayd in the Goſpell, Sell all, and giue to the poore, is vnderſtood of a hart willing if neede be, not of a deede when cauſe concurreth not. Liber ſi ſis ab auaritia, omnia vendis licet nihil vendas, ſin minus nihil vendis, licet omnia vendas. If thou be free from couetouſnes, thou ſelleſt all things though thou ſhouldeſt ſell nothing, otherwiſe thou ſelleſt nothing, though thou ſhouldeſt ſell all things.

               3 The contention betwixt them ſheweth an accidēt of wealth through our corruption,
                  Wealth cauſe of contention ſometime.
                now and then to make ſtrife and diſagreement, euen where a bond of nature is to the contrary: ſo it did heere, they were both ſo wealthy, that the land could not beare them, that they might dwell together.
            
               4 But where began the contention? amongſt their ſeruants, theyr heardmen could not agree together:
                  Seruants ſet mayſters at variance.
                and brawles amongſt ſeruants at laſt reach to their maiſters, they many tymes harkening to the ſame more partially then they ſhould: too true this is by dayly experience found in euery coaſt and countrey, would God either this example, or thouſands of euils that growe thereby, might make them amend that yeeld too much to thys miſchiefe. It is neither pittie nor charitie to beleeue all reports, much leſſe the reports of a man greeued againſt the partie, who hath greeued him, leaſt of all againſt him, who hauing nothing at all offended, the mayſter I meane, is only abuſed becauſe his ſeruant hath done what his mayſter neither wiſhed nor liked. Let not Lot and Abraham ſo cruelly iarre and ſtomack one an other, becauſe their ſeruants cannot agree together: and what ſeruants? their heardmen, their dogkeepers, or horſekeepers, or the baſeſt they haue. Where ſhould wiſedome appeare if not in this, to diſcerne perſons, cauſes, times, and occaſions, and neuer for a baſer to loſe a better, for a ſtranger, a neighbour, for a ſeruant, and cauſe of no accompt, a gentleman and loue of moſt great accompt.
            
               
               5 I but what ſhall a man doo? his ſeruant is abuſed, other mens ſeruants ſeeke to crow ouer them,
                  Mayſters excuſes to deale in their ſeruants quarells.
                &amp; to rule the roſt as they liſt. This is an iniury to the mayſter, and a ſhame to ſuffer it. So a man may be made a foole, and compted a wretch and a daſtard of no reputation, and neuer a man care to ſerue him that will no better ſticke to his men, then ſo. Well ſayd fleſh and bloud, and ould Adams corruption, I knowe this is the ſonge thereof, and much more then this to this ende. But either wee bee Chriſtians or none. If wee bee Chriſtians, and care for his word, wee haue heere a direction what to doo, ſurely euen as godly Abraham did at this time. He conſidered all circumſtances, loued concord, regarded peace, ſought it, and inſewed after it. Thought it would bee farre more credit for him to haue vnitie and good loue, then the bitter effects of the contrary. Therefore hee hartneth not his ſeruants and ſetteth them on, hee taketh not their tales into his boſome, to worke diſlyke of Lot his Coſen, hee looketh not bigge vppon Lot, biddeth hym not away from hym, &amp;c. But hee talketh with hym of the matter, and that not hotely, but kindly and friendly, with great meekeneſſe and loue, knowing in wiſedome that ſpeach ſomewhat, but kinde and ſoft ſpeach much more cooleth a heate that beginneth to riſe,
                  Speech endeth anger, and ſilence nouriſheth &amp; increaſeth it.
                and doth out a fyre that began to flame. Hee is Lots elder and Vncle, his better in that reſpect and all other, yet hee ſtandeth not vpon that, looking when Lot ſhoulde come vnto him, and ſtoupe to hym, but as in yeares and euery way hee did excell him, ſo in wiſedome and mildneſſe, in humilitie and temperance of affections hee farre paſſeth him. Ouerruling himſelfe by that vertue thus farre, that hee goeth to hym, and vrging him with that which Lot not ſo well conſidered, to wit, that they were brethren, neighbours, friends, kinſfolks, &amp;c. moueth hym thereby as by ſo many ſtrong reaſons, and mightie hands, that loue and peace might remayne betwixt them, and contention and brawles be far away bothe from them, themſelues, and from their people: I pray thee ſayth hee, I pray thee, let it not be thus, but ſo, and ſo forth. He gaue hym his choyſe to goe which way hee would, and would accept what hee refuſed. O paterne of wiſedome and all vertues for all Noblemen, Gentlemen, and whoſoeuer may ſay they

                     The victory of Abraham from the 13. to the ende.

               THE cauſe of thys warre you ſee in the text, that by thys meanes they might ſhake off the yoke that they indured twelue yeares,
                  Rebellion.
                I meane the one part, for twelue yeares fayth the text, were they ſubiecte to Cnedor Laomer, but in the thirtenth they rebelled, a bad courſe to get libertie, where ſubiection is due. For Rebellion God neuer loued, neuer proſpered,

but euer plagued. The iſſue in this place ſayth aſmuch. The fearefull deſtruction of Corah and his company, Abſolon and his company, and in our owne ſtories of many an one ſayth aſmuch. Papiſts charge vs that wee are no good friends to Princes and Rulers, and it is no newes to heare it of them. Elias had ſuche meaſure meaſured vnto hym by the wicked King, when hee was called a troubler of Iſrael. Micheas the true Prophet, Ieremy and Amos as true as hee,
                  1. King. 22. Iere. 38.4. Amos 7.10
                all of them faithfull to Princes euer, were ſo accuſed, and with venemous words if you reade the places, but all moſt falſely and iniuriouſly. Wee ſay, the doctrine of Rome is no friend to Princes, and iudge you how truly. Sanders monarchie freeing ſubiects from theyr othes to their naturall Princes. The Bull of Pius the fift. The anſweres of them that were examined, whether if the Pope inuaded, they would take the Princes part or his. The Oration that Cardinall Poole made to the Emperour. The many many moſt fearefull, moſt wicked, moſt vnnaturall and damnable conſpiracies entred into by them, their rebellions, let them be your lights to leade you to a true verdit and ſentence. They that rebelled in King Henry the eyght his dayes,

                in King Edward his ſonnes dayes, in her Maieſties moſt happye dayes that wee haue now long inioyed in the mercy great of our moſt gracious God, and long long that wee may yet inioy, beſeech his goodnes: were they Papiſts or Proteſtants, men fauoring the Goſpell, or addicted to, and drowned in the dregs of Popery and ſuperſtition? They that repented that they were ſo buſye in Queene Maryes dayes, in cutting off the boughes, and ſtill let the ſtocke remayne, which aboue all rather ſhould haue been he wed downe, meaning her ſacred Maieſtie, what were they? men helding out the light of Gods holie Goſpell, or fighting for his triple Crowne of Rome, that ſhall neuer be able to ſaue their ſoules, from due deſert of ſuch diſloyall thought and moſt vndutifull ſpea

                Long did hee ſpare, but at laſt they had this touch by the ſword of theſe Kings againſt them, and when that would not ſerue, a finall deſtruction from heauen by fire and brimſtone. Iude applyeth it thus, that if God ſpared not them, certaynly hee will not ſpare vs, and let vs thinke of it.

               4 In the 13. verſe it is ſayd, that one eſcaped to tell Abraham, where ſee the prouidence of God for his euer. No ſooner is Lot in danger, but one is prepared to procure him reſcue. So ſhall it euer bee with Gods faithfull ſeruants wee may be aſſured,

                Many a crooked nature would haue thought of this now, and haue let Lot taſte of that which his departure in ſome ſort had procured. But doth Abraham ſo? No, but in his friends diſtreſſe all former faults are forgotten, and willing offer of hym and his into danger, with all ſpeede made to releeue and releaſe him from his oppreſſion and danger. This is loue that God loueth, and this is loue that well beſeemeth all friends that would be accompted truly true friends.

                ſheweth the kindneſſe of a man that is truly godly, euer ready by any meanes he can to comfort and cheriſh, to relieue and do good to his weary, weake, and needy brother. For godlyneſſe is louing and comfortable both by wordes and deedes, vngodlyneſſe is churliſhe and harde, parting with nothing, as you ſee in Naball.
            
            
               9 This place is abuſed by the Papiſts as many moe bee, to prooue theyr Maſſe. But they ſhewe their wickedneſſe,
                  Melchiſedechs fact no figure of popiſh Maſſe.
                and want theyr purpoſe. Behould (ſay they) a type and figure of the

vnbloudy Sacrifice that Chriſt offred at his laſt Supper. This the figure, that the fulfilling of it in truth, and hee remayning for euer a Prieſt after the order of this Melchiſedech, the truth of this figure, that is an vnbloudie Sacrifice, vnder the ſignes of bread and wyne, muſt alſo euer remayne, &amp;c. Wee anſwere them firſt, that foraſmuch as the Apoſtle ſo fully diſcuſſing this compariſon betwixt Chriſt and Melchiſedech, maketh no mention of any ſuch Sacrifice, it beeing yet as themſelues ſay, the chiefeſt poynt of the compariſon. Too much to blame are they, that they ſhame not to obtrude vnto the Apoſtle ſuch an vnknowne Myſterie, and to ſupply of theyr owne what he directed by the ſpirit of God quite left out and neuer mencioned. If they denye this conſequence, to wit, from the Apoſtles ſilence or omiſſion to the nullitie of the thing, wee tell them it is moſt ſtrong by vertue of a rule in diuinitie which they ſhall neuer improue whilſt they lyue.
                  A rule touching types and figures.
                The rule is this. Of types and figures of the olde Teſtament, ſo farre onely and neuer further may a doctrine be eſtabliſhed, as the ſame types and figures by expreſſe and plaine words of the Apoſtles ſhall be expounded and interpreted. For if euery man might expound them as he thought good, varietie of allegories moſt vncertaine and doubtfull ſhould ouerthrowe all truth amongſt vs. If therefore any reliefe for the Maſſe muſt be had from this fact of Melchiſedech, needes of neceſſitie they muſt bring ſome place of the new Teſtament where it is ſo expounded: otherwiſe they play but with allegories of their owne making, and their ſpeech may bee tearmed allegoricall, but not theologicall. For that fulneſſe of perſwaſion and 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , that is in Diuinitie, ſtayeth not vpon allegoricall deuiſes, except they be warranted by God himſelfe.
            
                Secondly where as they ſaye Melchiſedech offred heere bread and wyne to God, we vtterly deny it, and referre our ſelues to the words of Moſes, wherein is not any ſuch matter. The text is protulit, not obtulit, he brought forth bread and wyne, not he offred bread and wyne. Except to bring forth were to offer and ſacrifice, which it cannot be. And that knewe euen that olde Tranſlator whome they make ſuch accompt of, and thereupon tranſlated the Hebrue word to bring forth, not to offer.
            
               
                Thirdly, if we ſhould graunt all they ſeeke, to wit, that he offred bread and wine (as God forbid we ſhould ſo be-lye the texte) yet would it not folow what they deſire. For how hang theſe together Melchiſedech was a figure of Chriſt, and offred bread &amp; wine to God. Therefore Chriſt in his holy Supper offered himſelfe vnbluddely to God the Father for vs, which alſo is done ſtill in the Maſſe. Conſider of it, is there any ſequele in the world in it? may we not aſwell conclude, that Chriſt ought to be offred dayly vnder the ſignes of Lambes, of turtle Doues, young Pigeons, Goates, and Calues, and many ſuch things, becauſe once theſe things were offered, as they, that hee muſt bee offred vnder bread and wine, becauſe bread and wine were offred by Melchiſedech? Surely thoſe burnt offrings of the law, did far far more liuely reſemble and expreſſe the future ſacrifice of Chriſt, then the offring of any bread could: for in them was ſuffring, dying, ſhedding of bloud, and a being ſlaine and killed, which is not in bread, and therefore if anye ſhould remaine to ſuch an ende as the Papiſts would, rather they ſhould remaine then the ſignes of bread and Wine.
            
                Againe, if this offring of Melchiſedechs were a figure of Chriſt, either Chriſt hath fulfilled it or not, if he haue not, then was
not all finiſhed as he ſayd, which God forbid, and if hee haue then being fulfilled, why ſhould it not ceaſe, as all other figures doo of the ould Teſtament: ſhall the figure and the truthe ſtand both at once? It is ſtraunge diuinitie: nay the contrary is true, and ſound diuinitie, to wit, that Chriſt hauing vpon the Croſſe, with his own oblation of himſelfe, ended and determined all figures, vſed to ſhow his comming, this alſo if as they take it, a figure of him, ended likewiſe, and finiſhed, and taken away.
            
                Yet further let theſe men conſider their abſurdities againſt themſelues: for if their Maſſe leane vpon this fact of Melchiſedech, their tranſubſtantiation is quite gone, for that which Melchiſedech offred (if he offered as they ſay) was not any figure or bare ſhow and accidents of bread and wine, but bread indeed, and Wine indeede, the ſubſtance there aſwell as the accidents, and therefore if that was any figure of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, then muſt that ſacrifice be bread and wine indeed, as that was. Againe

if Melchiſedech offred any offring, it was an offring of thankſgiuing▪ wherevpon his wordes proceeded, bleſſed bee the Lorde that hath delyuered thy enemies into thy hande. But they will not haue theyr Maſſe offring ſo, but a propitiatorie ſacrifice, how then agree theſe together? Conclude wee then in a better ſorte then theſe men doe, that in truth, Chriſt is a Prieſt for euer, after the order of Melchiſedech, as the Pſalme ſaith, but this order conſiſteth not in anye reall offring of himſelfe daylye, for the ſinnes of men (for with one oblation, ſaith the Apoſtle, hath hee conſecrated for euer them that are ſanctified) but this order conſiſteth in theſe thinges.
                  Heb. 10.14
                
               
                  The compariſon how it ſtandeth.
                Firſt, Melchiſedech was both a King and a Prieſt: ſo was our Sauiour Chriſt. Secondly, hee was by interpretation, ſaith the Apoſtle, King of righteouſnes, and King of Salem,
               
                  Hebr. 7.1. verſe. 2.
                that is, of peace: ſo is our Sauiour Chriſt truly and verilye, King of righteouſneſſe and peace, yea of all righteouſneſſe and peace.
                  verſe. 3.
                
               Thirdly, Melchiſedec was without father, without mother, without kindred, and had neither beginning of his dayes, nor end of life: that is, none of theſe were left in Scripture to our knowledge, but hee is propounded to vs as eternall, ſo is our Sauiour Chriſt eternall indeed, and without all theſe,
                  verſe. 3.
                in reſpect of the one or other nature, his Prieſthood endeth, not as Arons did, but is for euer. Laſtlye, Melchiſedech was in this aboue Abraham, and all the Leuites of Abraham after deſcended,
                  ver. 5. &amp;c.
                that hee receiued tithes of him and them, hee paying tithes vnto him, and they alſo, as the Apoſtle ſaith, becauſe they were in his loynes: And hee bleſſing Abraham, the leſſer beeing bleſſed of the greater: ſo was our Sauiour Chriſt aboue Abraham, and aboue all the Leuiticall Prieſts of the lawe, that deſcended of Abraham. This reſemblance hath warrant as you ſee in the Scripture, and therefore is 
                  •
               ounde thus farre. But if we will goe further, to ſay, Melchiſedech offred Breade and Wine, therefore Chriſtes bodye muſt bee offred of Prieſts in the Maſſe daylye, vnbloudily, vnder the accidents of Bread and Wyne, for the ſinnes of the quicke and the dead, wee adde that which the Apoſtle addeth not, which yet hee would neuer haue omitted, if it had beene to bee added, we goe beyond our warrant, and wee muſt vaniſhe with our vanitie, that hath

no ſurer ſtaye then our owne deuiſe and fanſie▪ And thus much of this matter.
            
               10 The 
                  •
               are laſtlye that Abraham had to keepe bothe the credit of himſelfe a profeſſor, and the Lordes honor,
                  Care of the credit of a profeſſor of truthe.
                whome hee ſerued, appeareth in this Chapter: For hee will not haue ſo much as a thred of him, leaſt hee ſhould therevpon ſpeake euill of him, his God, and religion. Such a remembrance ſhould we euer haue by his example of the Maiſter wee ſerue, of the office we beare, and of the partyes wee deale with, abhorring bribes that robbe bothe vs, and our God, of good reporte, and ſet open the mouthes of the wicked againſt the trueth, whereof wee are profeſſors. Abraham would not, that this wicked King ſhould ſaye, Hee had made Abraham riche, and wee care not that anye man ſayes of vs. Wee can bee content to bee fedde of Papiſtes, that they may freelye diſhonour the Maieſtie of God, of Theeues, that they may eſcape and ſteale againe:
                  Note.
                of adulterers, and filthie lyuers, that they may ſtill tranſgreſſe, and neuer thinke what may bee ſayde by them, or by others, vppon this occaſion of the Lorde, whoſe name wee profeſſe. Of his truth, which wee ſaye wee houlde, or of our ſelues, whome yet wee gladlye would haue men thinke well of. This is nowe farre you ſee from Abrahams example in this place, and therefore, except wee learne of him heereafter to amende this courſe, it maye iuſtlye bee feared, wee ſhall neuer come where Abraham nowe is.
         
         
            
            Chap. 15.
            
                The heads of this Chapter. In this Chapter there is, the promiſe renued againe, the faith and iuſtification of Abraham, from the 1. verſe to the 9. 2. The confirmation of him by an outward ſigne, from the 9. to the end. Particulars as in other chapters many.
            
            
               1 
               IN that it is ſayd, The worde of the Lord came to Abraham in a viſion: note we the manner of Gods reueyling himſelfe in thoſe dayes. In the 12. of Numbers it is thus ſayde.
                  verſe. 6.
                
               If there be a Prophet of the Lorde amongſt you: I will be knowne to him by a viſion, and wil ſpeake vnto him by a dreame. Noting the two ordinary meanes in thoſe daies,
                  Aug. de geneſi ad liter. lib. 12
                
               viſion &amp; dreame. Heere it was by viſion, of which S. Auguſtine maketh three kindes, Corporalem, ſpiritualem, mentalem, corporall, spirituall, and mentall, if I may ſo ſpeake. The corporall viſion is, when corporall things to our corporall eyes appeare and are ſeene. The Spirituall, when the likeneſſe of things are ſeene in ſpirit, in dreame, or in an extaſie. The mentall, as wee terme it, is when vnderſtanding is giuen, to know the meaning of ſuch likeneſſes and formes, when they are ſeene. As for example, Pharoh ſaw the fat Kine and leane Kine,
               
                  Gen. 41.
                but knew not what they meant, Ioſeph knew what they ment, and yet ſaw them not: Pharoh therefore had a ſpirituall viſion, and Ioſeph a mentall. An other example:
                  chap. 40.
                The two ſeruants of Pharoh, the Butler and the Baker had theyr ſpirituall viſions, but knew not againe what they pretended, Ioſeph did, which had no ſuch appearances made vnto him, and that was a mentall viſion. Nabuchadnezar againe had the ſpirituall viſion, Daniel. 2. Daniel bothe the ſpirituall

and the mentall. This viſion of Abraham was a corporall viſion as is thought, and proofe thereof alledged out of the fift verſe.
            
               2 Obſerue wee the oportunitie of this Viſion, when it was. Surely when Abraham was returned from the reſcue of Lot, and was now in a great feare what might be faull him by thoſe Kings, whome he had ſo purſued, conquered, and deliuered his freend from. He was a ſtranger and they at home, hee but a few, they of great power, alyance, and kindred, howe ſhould it bee, but they would combine together to deſtroye him, and neuer put vp and digeſt what he had doone to them. This multiplied in Abrahams minde, as all feare will, and gaue him many a ſecret gripe, that all the world felt not ſo well as hee. But behould a gracious God, a deare and tender father▪ that neuer ſlumbreth nor ſleepeth when his be in agonies and perplexities. In this oportunitie of time he appeareth to his ſeruant, renueth his promiſe to his great comfort, and daſheth in ſunder, with his wordes of ſweete mercy, the bones of all ſuch troubled thoughts, and fearefull concepts. Could Abrahams heart haue wiſhed his comfort, in a more fit time? Did hee not thus againe before, when Lot was departed from him. Let it euer then be one of our notes, in reading the word, how fitly, in reſpect of time and neede, God comforteth his, and let vs know, that he is one and the ſame, for euer, to all that put their truſt in him. He ſeeth what Abraham wanteth, and when he wanteth, and ſeeth he not vs? Hee gaue Abraham what hee wanted, and when he wanted it, and is 
                  •
               e onely his God? Stirre we then vp the faith within vs, euer euer to truſt in him, to depend on him, and to expect from him our wanted helpes, euen in the very time they may beſt ſteede vs.
            
               3 Let vs marke the manner of comforte, and the wordes themſelues. Feare not Abraham (ſaith he) I am thy buckler,
               
                  Verſe. 1.
                  
                
               and thine exceeding great rewarde.
               
                  How God comforteth.
                He telleth him not that his enemies be wicked and he iuſt, or that they ſhall be weake, and he ſtrong, or any ſuch matter, but this he ſaith onely, I am thy ſhield. Teaching vs, that this is enough againſt all the threats of foes,

and terrors of a whole worlde, if God care for vs, and take vppon him to be our ſhield againſt them. Earthly hearts do not conceyue this, but they crie: Giue me friends and fauour with men, with Princes, with Noblemen, with Magiſtrates, and Gentlemen, giue me gold and ſiluer, giue me alyance and kindred, and ſuch like, and then let me alone, but if we want theſe all or ſome, woe be to vs, we cannot liue, we ſhall be ſo croſſed, ſo ſnubbed, ſo browbeaten, ſo pinched a thouſand wayes, that death were better a great deale, then ſuch a life. But O carnall wretches, and carnall comforts, is God nothing, and man all, is the Creator ſo weake, and the creature ſo ſtrong, where are our eyes: If theſe things bee had with Gods fauour, they are good meanes, and may bee our comforte, but if theſe wante, and God loue, is hee all to weake to ſhielde vs? God forbid. Naye onely his loue is life and libertie, though all the worlde with his power were ſet againſt vs.
            And this is that which in this place God would haue Abraham to ſee▪ That hee might not thinke, alas I am a ſtranger, weake and without friendes, great men malice me, and howe ſhall I doe, howe can I ſcape their handes, &amp;c. away (ſaith GOD) Abraham with ſuch concepts, I am thy Buckler, and I tell thee, that is inough againſt all thy foes, were they neuer ſo manye and mightie. Truthe Lorde truthe, and farre bee it from vs,
                  Rom. 8.
                euer to thinke otherwiſe. If thou be with vs, who can be againſt vs, to hurt vs. If I walke in the middeſt of the ſhadow of death, ſaith the Prophet Dauid, I will not feare any euill,
               
                  Pſa. 23.4.
                and why? Quia tu mecum es, Becauſe thou art with mee,
                and O Lorde it is our ſonge alſo, increaſe our faith for thy merci

               4 In that hee ſaith, hee is his rewarde, and not onely ſo, but his exceeding great rewarde,
               
                  No loſſe in ſeruing God.
                wee doe well ſee there is no loſſe in ſeruing God, as the wicked doe complaine in the Prophet Malachie,

               5 When Abraham ſayth to God, yea but O Lorde what wilte thou giue mee, ſeeing I goe childleſſe, &amp;c.
               
                  Verſe. 2.
                  
                We may ſee the weakeneſſe of Gods children, euen his deere ones, and cheefe-ones, if things anſwer not theyr deſires. They are a little impatient, and thinke leſſe of many mercies, that both they haue and are promiſed after to haue, becauſe they wante ſome one thing that they would gladlye haue. So was Abraham heere for wante of a Childe: as if hee ſhould haue ſayde, O Lorde, what is all thou promiſeſt whilſt this wanteth, that I haue no iſſue. This is a great corruption in vs, and wee muſt beware. For if God were not mercifull, it were the waye to robbe vs of all, to thinke light of anye for wante of ſome. Let vs not thinke it is denyed, that is differred. God hath his tymes for all thinges, and bounde are wee to his Maieſtie, for what wee haue till more come, and though neuer more come.
            
               6 When Abraham thus vttered his greefe, for wante of

ſeede, God telleth him in great goodneſſe, hee ſhould haue ſeede according to his deſire, yea farre and farre aboue that which hee could imagine or aſke. For as the ſtars of heauen ſo ſhould his ſeede be for number.
                  Verſe. 5.
                  
                A gratious promiſe to a greeued minde, for that ſame thing. But when or wherein will not God be good to thoſe that truly ſerue him:
                  Iuſtification by faith
                this promiſe Abraham beleeued, (ſaith the text) and it was counted vnto him for righteouſnes. By faith then was Abraham iuſtified, we plainly ſee, and is there an other way for other men? this were madnes to thinke, &amp; therefore chooſe we with him to beleeue, that by faith, as he was, wee may be iuſtified. For it is not written for him onelye, that it was imputed to him for righteouſnes (ſaith the Apoſtle) but alſo for vs,
               
                  Rom. 4.23.
                
               to whome it ſhall bee imputed for righteouſneſſe, which beleeue in him, that raiſed vp Ieſus our Lorde from the dead. Againe, I count all things loſſe, and do iudge them dongue,
               
                  Phili. 3.8.9
                
               that I might win Chriſt, &amp; might be found in him, that is not hauing mine owne righteouſnes, which is of the lawe, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, euen the righteouſnes which is of God, through faith, &amp;c. With many ſuch places, if it were not needleſſe in many wordes to folowe this doctrine now. Away therefore with whatſoeuer yeeldeth man to boaſt in, and knowe that the thing that God regardeth in vs, is faith. Firſt becauſe of his eternall purpoſe, onelye to ſaue beleeuers, and ſecondly, becauſe faith euer aſcribeth to him the glory, both of truth and power.

               7 But it is layd downe heere, that Abraham aſked a ſigne. How could that ſtand with a right faithe:
                  A ſigne asked.
                may a man beleeue and yet aſke a ſigne to confirme doubting? aunſwer may bee made, that God promiſed two things: a Seede, and the inheritance of the land of Canaan: Abraham beleeued the firſt, and was iuſtified, but ſomewhat wauered in the ſecond, becauſe hee could not conceiue how he ſo ould a man ſhould euer be maiſter of that land. And that a man may haue true faith, though not all faith: it is manifeſt in all Gods children,

of water to come out of the rocke, and ſo greeued God. Truth is ſufficient, and perfection falleth not into this life. Looke what your note ſaith in the Margin.

And in the diuiſion and placing of theſe beaſts, we ſee the ould manner of making couenants in thoſe dayes: They firſt deuided them, to ſhowe,

Secondly to ſhowe, that they wiſhed euen theyr owne bodyes ſo deuided and cut a ſunder, if they ſhould breake that couenant: read the 1. of Sam. 11.7. Then they layd one parte anſwering to an other, to ſhowe the anſwering, and agreement, and conſent, that ſhould be in their two hearts either to other. Laſtlie, the Birds were not deuided, to ſhowe, that though all externall matters might be parted, yet theyr mindes and wils not. Read the marginall note againe in your Bible.

But as Abraham droue them away, ſo ſhould his Seede by Gods helpe, conquere and ouercome theyr cruell enemies.

                to ſerue a cruell people, and to be euill intreated of them, wee may note the manner many times of the Lordes dealing, with ſuch as hee meaneth to doe much for. Surely then hee vſed, and nowe hee

vſeth not to make any man rule before he haue ſerued, not to giue freedome, but after a taſte firſt of bondage. Firſt muſt come ſower and then ſweete, firſt paine and then pleaſure, firſt trauell and then reſt. So knowe wee better what his benefite is, by former experience of the wante, and wee become more thankefull for it. Ioſeph founde it thus, Dauid, Daniell, and manye moe.

Remember how Cain ſped, how Sodom and Gomorrha ſped, how Pharoh and his hoaſt ſped, howe Corah and his company ſped, how Miriam Moiſes ſiſter ſped, for her wicked ſpeech againſt her brethren,

                and to go no further, howe thoſe wicked impes of children ſped, that cryed to the Prophet, Bauld head, Bauld head. True it is, that God ſpareth long ſometime, but as true againe it is, that he paieth home at laſt, and as true as either of theſe that the ſharpeneſſe of his wrath when it lighteth, recompenſeth the long ſtay of it before it light.

Stande in awe, and goe not on. Make not your ſinne full, by continuing of it. For if you do, your death is determined. Many things moe yet hath this chapter, but let theſe ſuffice now,
         
         
            
            Chap. 16.
            
                The principall heads of this Chapter are theſe.

                     The double mariage of Abraham, to the 4▪ verſe.
                     The diſpiſing of Sarah by Hagar, to the 7. verſe.
                     Her flight and returne, to the end.
                  
               
            
            
               COncerning the firſt, the occaſion of it is noted,
                  Verſe. 2.
                  
                when it is ſayd Sarah was barren,
               
                  Good Spirits in men or women, blame themſelues before others.
                
               and bare no children to Abraham. Her barrenneſſe ſheweth the power of God, in after giuing her a Childe, and is noted to that end.
            
               2 In that ſhee layeth the fault vppon hir ſelfe, and not vppon her huſband, ſaying, The Lord had reſtrained her, &amp;c. It ſheweth hir ſpirit modeſt and godlye, and telleth vs the better to diſcerne them, that had rather blame any themſelues, and that in a thouſand things, then themſelues in one. Such Spirites bee proud and arrogant, ſwelling with vaine concepts of themſelues, and poyſoned with ſpite againſt others. And if they be women, they are no Sarahs we well know, by this good marke of a good Sarah in this place.
            
               3 The Lord reſtraineth honeſt Women from child bearing, and none but he, but filths reſtraine themſelues, leaſt their ſecret whordomes ſhould appeare.
            
               4 If Sarah thought ſhee was finally reſtrained, becauſe of age, it was a want in a good woman, and a little ſpotte in a fayre face. For God is not to be tyed to time, to age, and yeares. But is as able when yeares be many, as when they be fewer. Yea age and youth to him are one, if his pleaſure be to haue it ſo.

               r giuing her Maide to her huſband, noteth the corruption of that time: from the beginning it was not ſo, for male and female God created them firſt,

                one for one, and not mo for either at once.
            
               6 Abraham obeyed his wife, and tooke her maide, ſaith the texte, and this alſo was a blemiſh, though then indured as wee knowe. He ſhould haue ſayd▪ no, I will not doe it, we will tr

                  Verſe. 4.
                  
               
               7 When Agar ſaw ſhe had conceiued, her Miſtreſſe was deſpiſed in her eyes: and ſo truly verified we ſee the prouerbe:

                  Aſperius nihil est humili cum ſurgit in altum,
                  Pungitur in celſa ſimia ſede ſedens.
               
Nothing more proude, than a beggar ſet on horſebacke, and a verye Ape, if you place him vp aloft, begins to bridle the matter, and take vpon him maruelouſly. Secondly it teacheth, that aduerſitie is better borne then proſperitie, of manye one. Thirdlye it ſheweth the end of euill counſell, Sarah is beaten with her owne rodde.
            
               
                  Verſe. 5.
                  
               
               8 But dooth ſhee ſo applye it, no: but in a rage ſhe flyeth vppon Abraham, and chideth him, becauſe her maide abuſed her. An angrye minde will lay the fault where it is not, and eſpecially an angrie woman.
            
               
                  Verſe. 6.
                  
               
               9 Abraham anſwereth his angrie Wife with meekeneſſe, a vertue in him, and beſt for her to appeaſe hir wrath, for fire neuer quencheth fire as we all know. But a ſoft anſwer breaketh anger ſaith the Wiſeman.
            
               10 Sarah handled her roughly, after Abraham had anſwered, and behoulde by it the certaintie of Womens affections.

Before ſhe promoted her, and now ſhe plagueth her: before ſhe deſired fruite of hir, and now when ſhe ſeeth the hope of it, it will not ſerue. To bee woone with the Egge, and loſt with the ſhell, is a great inconſtancie. Sarahs cauſe was better, but yet her hardneſſe more then happilye anſwered the cauſe as it was.
            
               11 Agar runneth away, when ſhe ſhould haue amended her fault and ſubmitted her ſelfe to her miſtr
                  •
               ſſe, ſo take wee the courſe in the crookedneſſe of our nature, that wee ſhould auoyde many times. Stubborne ſtomacks had rather breake then bowe, but we muſt beware it.
            
               12 When ſhee was thus fled▪ the Lorde yet rewarded not what ſhe deſerued: but by his Angell admoniſhed her in the wilderneſſe▪ 
               to returne againe: ſo good is hee,
                  Verſe. 7.
                  
                that hee regardeth all ſortes, and contemneth not the poore eſtate of a ſeruante.
            
               13 When the Angell aſked her whence ſhee came, and whether ſhee would, ſhe playnely anſwered and lyed not,
                  Verſe. 8.
                  
                
               that ſhe fled from her Dame. Such truth is an ornament, where it is found in Man or Woman,
                  Read Iob. 31.15.
                and ſuch truth in a ſeruant in theſe wicked dayes wherein we liue, O how rare.
            
               14 This councell to returne, was not giuen her by and by,
                  Verſe. 9.
                  
                neyther this finding of her in the wilderneſſe, but after ſhee had taſted a little ſmarte, then was it ſayde vnto her, teaching vs that then is the beſt time for good counſell, when our owne rodde hath beaten vs, and not before, with manye natures.
            
               15 When hee biddeth her humble her ſelfe to her Dame, wee ſee the dutie of ſeruauntes plainely, and the dutye alſo of Dames, truely to bee content, and accept to bee appeaſed and pacified with the ſubmiſſion of a ſeruaunt that hath

offended, which ſome will neuer, ſo fierce is their nature, and ſo voyde of remembrance, that euen their maiſter is alſo in heauen, read the Epiſtle to Philemon, for his ſeruant to bee receyued againe, that had gone awaye.
            
               16 In the 13. verſe, behoulde her thankefulneſſe, when ſhee thus vſed of the Lorde. She called the name of the Lorde that ſpake to her (for this Angell was Chriſt) Thou God lookeſt on me, and ſo foorth, a good bringing vp in a good houſe, maketh ſome ſhowe in hir manners, more then at theſe dayes it will do in many.
            Laſtlye, ſee howe afliction and good councell will make Hagar come home againe to a good place, and learne to performe more dutie where it is due. So ſhould it make others aſwell as her, but that grace is wanting which was in her.
         
         
            Chap. 17. 
            
               The generall heads in this Chapter are theſe.

                     The change of Abrahams name, from the 1. verſe to the 7.
                     The inſtitution of circumciſion, from the 7. to the 15.
                     The promiſe of a Childe to Sarah, from the 15. to the ende.
                  
               
            
            
               PArticular thinges worthye our noting, may bee theſe,
                  Verſe. 1.
                  
                and ſuch others. Firſt the mentioning of his age,
                  Theyr age noted for 2. cauſes.
                wherefore it was. Surelye to teach two things: Firſt, that the Seede which God gaue him, was not by ſtrength of nature, but by extraordinary grace, for Sarah and he bothe were of theſe great yeares.
            
               Secondly to ſhew how long in patience and faith Abraham expected that gratious promiſe, not doubting as the Apoſtle ſayth of the ſame, but ſtrengthned in the faith, giuing glory to God,
               
                  Rom. 4.19.
                
               and being fully aſſured that he which had promiſed was able to doo it.
            
            
               2 The words I am God all ſufficient,
               
                  Verſe 1.
                  
                haue been obſerued before to contayne a moſt ſtrong and ſure ſtay to a chriſtian hart,
                  A comfort by Gods omnipotencie.
                in all perplexities and diſtreſſes: for if his promiſes be great, this power of his aſſureth vs hee is able to pay and performe them. If wee pray and aſke any thing be it neuer ſo hard in fleſh and blouds conceipt, this aſſureth vs we ſhall obtayne it if it bee good for vs. For what cannot hee giue that is all-ſufficient, if it be his good pleaſure to doo it? and ſo in all things as I ſay it is a maruellous fortreſſe to ſhield a mans faith from the battring ſhot of Satans aſſaulting feares and doubts. In iourneying on the way, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers,
               
                  2. Cor. 12.26.
                
               in perils in our owne countrey, in perils in forren countreys, in perils in the Citie, in perils in the wilderneſſe, and euery euery way it is a ſtay to vs, that God will either deliuer out of them, or in them, as ſhall be beſt, for he is all-ſufficient.
            
            
               3 Obſerue wee the couenant betwixt God and Abraham,
               
                  Verſe 1.
                  
                how it containeth firſt a condition of Abraham to be performed, and then a promiſe of God vppon that condition to be expected. The condition that Abraham muſt performe▪ is this, walke before me, and be thou perfect or vpright. Gods promiſe is this, I will be God to thee, and to thy ſeed after thee, verſ. 7. This couenant ſtandeth ſtill to all the ſeede of Abraham after the ſpirit, that is, to all thoſe that are ingrafted into Chriſt by a true faith.
                  Godlynes gayneth God to vs and our children, vngodlynes l
                        •
                     ſeth him to both.
                And therefore as then hee and all his ſeede according to the fleſh, if they would inioy the promiſe, were to performe the condition, ſo ſtill it is with vs, and ſhall be with all Gods children to the ende of the world. True religion in the hart of man or woman, ſhall euer finde God a gratious guide, ſtaffe, and ſtay, and want of the ſame a iuſt neglecter of vs, becauſe wee haue broke the condition. For this cauſe it is ſayde by the bleſſed Apoſtle,

that gayne is not godlynes,
                  1. Tim. 4. &amp; 6.
                but godlynes is great gayne, and profitable to all things, as that which hath promiſe both of this life, and that to come. For this cauſe was God euer ſo carefull by his Prophets and Preachers to call vpon the people for ſinceritie in worſhip and holy obedience, that they performing their part, hee might performe his to be their God, and their childrens after them for euer. And for this cauſe againe were all thoſe exhortations made by good Fathers to their children, and charge that we reade of in ſcripture, that they ſhoulde feare God, knowe God, and ſerue God. That they ſeeking him, he might be found of them, they louing him, he might loue them, they ſeruing him, he might ſerue them with his mercy and fauour, with his prouidence and bleſſings needfull to this life, and with his kingdome and comforts for euer and euer when this life is ended. Maruell not then if either your ſelfe, your ſeede, or others and their ſeede whome you know be reiected of God, and taſte of his wrath by ſundry iudgements, if you knowe that you and they do not walke before hym as heere hee commandeth Abraham, nor performe the condicion with any care, wherevnto you ſee God maketh his promiſe in this place.
            
               
                  Verſe 5.
                  
               
               4 The change of Abrams name was for confirmation of his faith touching the promiſe,
                  His name why changed.
                that in all hope &amp; aſſurance hee might expect and recken of what in all truth and certayntie would bee performed on Gods part if hee beleeued, yea euen as ſurely and verely as now he was called Abraham of Abram, and Sarah of Sarai: ſo carefull was God euer to vnderprop the faith of his children by all good helps, that it might abide.
            
               5 Concerning Circumciſion, which is the ſecond head in this Chapter,
                  Verſe 7.
                  
                note what it was, a cutting away of the foreſkin of the fleſh of euery male childe.
                  Circumciſion what, and why there, &amp;c.
                Conſider why in that part of the body, to ſhew, that whatſoeuer is begotten and procedeth of the ſeed of man iſſuing from that part,  is corrupt and ſinfull,  vtterly vncapable of grace and life, except it be renewed and borne againe by the ſpirit of God through a gracious receiuing it into a gracious couenant, freely made with man and his ſeed by a gracious

God that would not the death of a ſinner, but that he ſhould know him, ſerue him, loue him, and liue for euer.  Conſider how long it indured, but vntill Chriſt, and no longer of neceſſitie. What was afterwards done, was in regard of weakenes in the Iewes, till the truth of Chriſt and the effect of his comming might be better knowen. For what ende, to confirme this promiſe that now you haue ſeene,  that if they walked befo
                  •
               e God, and were vpright, verely and verely, yea euen ſo verely as that ſigne was in their fleſh, would God be their God, and the God of their ſeed after them.
            
               6 Note how the ſigne is called by the name of the thing ſignified. This cut in the fleſh is called Gods couenant,
                  Verſe 10.
                  
                when it was but the ſigne: and the couenant as you haue ſeene this,
                  The ſygne hath the name of the thing ſignifyed.
                
               I will be thy God, &amp;c. This is no new kinde of ſpeaking with God, but vſuall euer in his ſacraments: heere you ſee it in the circumciſion, afterward in Exodus when he commeth to the Paſſeouer, he calleth the Lambe the Paſſeouer, which was but the ſigne of the Angells paſſing ouer all thoſe houſes that were ſtricked with the bloud vpon the dore cheekes.
               
                  Exod. 12. 1. Cor. 10. Luc. 8.11. Tit. 3.
                In the new teſtament the rock is called Chriſt, the ſeed is called the word, the water is called the waſhing of the new birth. And yet may not God bee alowed by ſome men in the ſacrament of his laſt ſupper to ſpeake as euer he did in all ſacraments? but becauſe there he ſayth the bread is his body, &amp;c. therefore it muſt be ſo really, carnally, ſubſtantially and groſſely by tranſubſtantiation deuiſed of themſelues. But by theſe examples of like ſpeach and phraſe you well ſee that their aſſertion is a reall lye, a carnall lye, a ſubſtantiall lye, and a groſſe lye: and truly ſayd the Father if they woulde regard him, Chriſtus non dubitabat dicere hoc eſt corpus meum, cum fignum daret corporis ſui. Chriſt doubted not to ſay this is my body, when he deliuered but a ſigne of his body.
            
               7 That the child was not circumciſed before the 8. day, it teacheth vs that God hath not tyed ſaluation to the ſacrament,
                  Verſe 12.
                  
                for it had bin a hard thing in the Lord to deferre it an houre if the childe had periſhed without it.
                  Saluation not tyed to the Sacrament.
                This anſwereth the feare of ſome

good ones, and the falſe bouldnes of ſome bad ones in theſe dayes touching children that dye without baptiſme, for God is not worſe to vs vnder the Goſpell, then hee was to them vnder the Law, neither leſſe able to ſaue now without baptiſme, then in thoſe dayes he was without circumciſion, the ſeede of the faithfull. This grace was not then free and now bound, then more and now leſſe, then ſtronger, and now weaker, farre be it from vs ſo to dreame. Dauids childe when it died before the eight day, he yet for all that iudged not damned, neither cryed out for it as he did for Abſolon that was circumciſed, but ſayd that he ſhould go to it, refreſhed himſelfe, cheered his wife, and made his ſeruants to wonder at his comfort. And when he ſayd he ſhould go to it,
               
                  2. Sam. 12.23.
                we knowe he meant not that it was in Hell, or any helliſh Limbus, and that thither himſelfe looked to go to it, but rather comfortably he conceyued it was with the Lord, becauſe the promiſe extended it ſelfe both to the godly and to their ſeede: if further we deſire to thinke of this matter, conſider we this and the like reaſons.  No elect can be damned, wee knowe it a principle whatſoeuer fooliſh men do prattle, but ſome vnbaptized are elect (a thing that no man will deny) therefore ſome vnbaptiſed cannot be damned: which if it be true, then ſee you plainly that ſaluatiō is not tyed to baptiſme, as ſome imagine.  Againe, he that heareth my word, ſayth Chriſt, and beleueth in him that ſent me, ſhal be ſaued, cannot be damned, Iohn. 5.24. but this may one doo before he be baptiſed, therefore before a man be baptiſed, he may ſtand in the ſtate of ſaluation, and out of all danger of damnation. The aſſumption is euident in the Eunuch, Act. 8· and others.  Fortie yeares it was omitted in the wilderneſſe,
                  Note.
                and yet hard to ſay that whoſoeuer ſo dyed was damned, ſince God in that omiſſion intended no crueltie, but mercie and pitie to his people.  How do not theſe men conſider that they put life and death, ſaluation and damnation in the hand of a mortall man, yea of any Miniſter, that if he be diſpoſed for malice to the parents to hurt the childe, may be abſenting himſelfe, and ſeeking delayes in the weakeneſſe of the childe, ſo farre hurt it, as to damne it for euer out of the kingdome of God, and company of all faithfull. O fearefull doctrine, fearefull to all good parents, iniurious to thouſands of poore infants,

and blaſphemous againſt the bottomleſſe mercy of a ſweet and tender father, who hath ſayd, I will be thy God and thy childes, not adding any condition of baptiſme, if it cannot be had as it ought.  How much ſweeter is it that Luther obſerued, and long before him Bernard, Epiſt. 77. in the words of our Sauiour. He that beleeueth and is baptiſed, ſhall be ſaued,
               
                  Ma
                        •
                     . 16.16.
                
               and he that beleeueth not ſhall be damned. Marke ſayth Luther how in the affirmatiue he mencioneth baptiſme, but not in the negatiue. For he doth not ſay, he that is not baptiſed ſhall be damned, but he that beleueth not, he ſhall be damned. Are couenants made by Sacraments, or only ſealed by them?  Did not the Primitiue Church examine thoſe of yeares in the faith before they baptiſed them. Why ſo I pray you, but that they might ſhewe it was the couenant, not the ſeale, their faith, and not the ſacrament, which chiefely was to be regarded, though the ſeale alſo in no caſe to be neglected, much leſſe contemned.  How many in times paſt deferred their baptiſme for many yeares, as Conſtantine, Nectarius, Nazianzene, &amp;c. not therein doing ſo well as they ought, but yet euidently ſhewing the faith of the Church then, that God without baptiſme is able to ſaue, and hath not tyed his grace to any ſigne.  If he can ſaue men of yeares, why not infants? but I will go no further, only this will I ſay, that if ſaluation depended vpon the ſacrament, it were not only fit that women who are neereſt in time of weakeneſſe, ſhould baptiſe (who yet are forbidden by God and well ordred Churches) but alſo that all ſorts of perſons, and not only Miniſters, ſhould diſpenſe that holy myſterie, to the end that no poore creature might be caſt away for want of it. But bleſſed be God that hath neither thus inthralled his grace, nor taught his Church in his word, but quite contrary as we ſee in this place, both by telling Abraham his couenant reached to his ſeed, and by deferring the ſeale of the ſame, to wit, circumciſion to the eight day, which hee would neuer haue done, if the want of it ſimply had bin damnation. Conclude wee therefore with Auſten, Inuiſibilis ſanctificatio ſine viſibili ſigno eſſe poteſt, the inuiſible ſanctification may be without the viſible ſigne,

baptiſme hurteth, and euen with Lumbard himſelfe Gratia Dei non eſt alligata ſacramentis, The grace of God is not tied to the ſacrament,
                beſide many others that I omit.

                  Not ſinne, but the imputation of it.
                not to take ſin away quite, that it be no more in the party circumciſed, but only the imputatiō of it, that thogh the venom of it remaine ſo rooted in our nature, that but by death it cannot quite bee rooted out, yet layde to our charge it is not for Chriſt his ſake. As therefore you ſee the corne cleane wynowed from his chaffe,
                  Note.
                yet hath in it nature to yeelde chaffe agayne to that which groweth of it when it is ſowen: ſo doth this nature of ours to thoſe that ſpring of vs yeelde corruption and originall ſinne, though we our ſelues were circumciſed or baptized and ſo purged thereby from it. Becauſe that purgation is euer to be vnderſtoode thus, Non vt non ſit in nobis peccatum, ſed vt non imputetur, Not that wee are cleared from the being of anye euill in vs, but from the imputation of it to vs. Therefore then in your generation, ſaith the text, ſhall this ſigne and ſacrament of circumciſion be continued, that is, from father to ſonne, and then to his ſonne againe, and ſo to euery male, foraſmuch as ſinne like chaffe being propagated from the father to the ſon, the chaffe of that is now ſprung vp muſt be fanned away as well as his was of whome this blade ſprung vp.

                  Contempt of ſacraments.
                and remember howe God neuer coulde abide the contempt of his ſacramentes, and that hee taketh the wrong doone to the outwarde ſigne as if it were doone vnto the thing it ſelfe ſignifyed by it. Becauſe (ſayeth hee) ſuch an one hath broken my couenaunt: when he had but neglected the ſigne of his couenaunt. This may leade vs both to the conſideration of that Popiſh follie, and alſo to a true anſwere vnto it that concludeth out of the eleuenth chapter of the firſt Epiſtle of Paule to the Corinthians, that becauſe the Apoſtle ſayeth, They that eate and drinke vnwoorthely are guiltie of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, &amp;c,
               
Therefore needes it muſt be, that the wicked eate the body and drinke the bloud of Chriſt. which they coulde not doe except they were there really, for by faith they can not eate that are voyde of faith. Therefore there is a reall preſence by tranſubſtantiation. When all this in very deede prooueth no more then euidently we ſee in this place, namely, that God attributeth the abuſe of the ſigne to the thing ſignified, ſaying, that becauſe the wicked come vnreuerently and vnpreparedly to thoſe holy ſignes, and receyue them vngolilie wythout fayth, therefore they ſhall bee guiltie euen of the body and blood it ſelfe, that is, euen as guiltie by abuſing the ſigne, as if they had abuſed the thing ſignified it ſelfe: for the contempt of the one redoundeth vnto the other. Circumciſion was a ſigne of his couenaunt, and here hee ſayeth, hee that contemneth that being the ſigne, is guiltie, and ſhall bee guiltie of the breach of his couenaunt, which was the thing ſignified: ſo are bread and wine the ſignes of the Lordes bodie and blood, and therefore ſayeth the Apoſtle by the ſame manner of ſpeaking, hee that abuſeth them by eating and drinking vnwoorthily of them, hee ſhall bee guiltie euen of abuſe doone vnto the thing it ſelfe, the true body and blood of Chriſt. No more proouing hereby that the ſignes are chaunged and become really the thing it ſelfe, than here it is to bee prooued that circumciſion was really the couenaunt it ſelfe, becauſe it is ſayde, hee that omitteth the one, breaketh the other. Weake proppes therefore you ſee Poperie hath, if they bee with a godly indifferencie examined and conſidered, caſting away that moſt wicked wilfulneſſe and preiudice that hurteth ſo many, and wil let them ſee nothing.
            
               10 In the fifteenth verſe you ſee God chaungeth alſo the name of Sarai as well as hee had doone to Abraham,
               
                  Why Sarai her name was alſo changed.
                and ſayeth her name ſhall be no more Sarai, but Sarah, and hee will bleſſe her, &amp;c. Where wee may note, howe it being a great honour to Abraham, ſo to haue his name chaunged by God,

                hee woulde haue his wife alſo partaker of the ſame with him, as teaching thereby that what befalleth the huſband, eyther to weale or woe, reacheth it ſelfe alſo in ſome ſorte to the wife as a partaker

with him in the ſame.
                  Women thinke of this.
                No queſtion but ſome part of this doctrine ſoundeth well to women, and they readely catch at it, but I doubt twiſe, whether all of it doo ſo or no. My meaning is, they moſt gladly heare that any honor of their huſbands ſhould reach vnto them, and exalt them alſo, but to pertake with their huſbands in affliction and croſſes, in ſorowes and cares, in reproches and ignominie cauſeleſſe, in bitterneſſe and vnthankefulneſſe of an vnkinde world, is it as ſweet a doctrine to them? I doo but moue the queſtion, let all women anſwere it in their hearts to themſelues in ſtead of mee.

                  Fathers affection to children, and childrens to fathers.
                ſayth this great Patriarke. See and ſee the heart of a father to his childe. Though God heere promiſed more ſeede vnto him, and that he ſhould be a Father euen of many Nations, and his progenie like the Starres of heauen for number, yet all that remoueth not his affection from that one that hee had alreadie, to wit, Iſmael, but ſtill his hart is to him, and O that he may liue alſo. So are Fathers, but God knoweth ſo are not euer children to them againe.
                  Note.
                The parent cryeth for life to the childe, and the childe for death to the parent.
                  O that Iſmael may liue ſayth Abraham, that I may inioy my childe: but O that Abraham may dye will Iſmaell ſay, that I might inherit his land and goods, and be a yong mayſter or miſtreſſe, and ruffle it out: yea, when will this ould Father and Mother of mine be gone, I thinke they will liue euer. Too true this is, and let it teach parents wiſedome, to moderate affections, though they retayne nature, to doo what ſhall be neceſſary and fit for their children.
            
               12 Wee haue heard the commandement of God touching Circumciſion,

                now in the 23. verſe marke wee the obedience of Abraham to the ſame,
                  Great obedience.
                how much ſoeuer fleſh and bloud might ſtartle and ſtagger at it, marueling why God ſhould inioyne ſuch a thing, and in ſuch a part of the body, &amp;c. Abraham I ſay caſteth no ſtops, neither admitteth of any humane obiections, but obediently circumciſeth both himſelfe and his ſonne, and all that were in his houſe, yea euen the ſame day did he it that God commanded

him, where we thinke it great readyneſſe, if after many and many biddings, admonitions and warnings, we be brought to doo ſome thing that God biddeth vs doo. Againe ſomewhat conſider wee heere of the conditions of Abrahams familie, that ſo willingly ſuffred their mayſter to circumciſe them,
                  A godly family.
                without either reſiſtance or imagination that their mayſter was mad to ſeeke ſuch a thing at their hands, as to vncouer all their ſhames, and to cut them there, as ſome others woulde haue thought. Surely it is a notable token of that inſtruction and diſcipline that was in Abrahams family, for had they not bin well trayned in the way of godlyneſſe, they woulde ſooner haue mocked then obeyed their mayſter.
            Laſtly, but alas why ſpared hee not his owne ſonne, and his onely ſonne in this hard action of cutting?
                  Duties to God binde all.
                ſurely becauſe the commandement reached to all males, and therefore to him aſwell as others. Learne then parents that in obedience to God you muſt be no more partiall to your owne children then to others, but as ſtreitly require dutie of them, as of any others, yea rather rather though many do it leſſe. But I ſay no more.

                that as wee heare him, ſo we muſt ſee him. But we heare him onely by his meſſengers, and ſo wee ſee him not in nature or eſſence, but in ſuch teſtimonies of his preſence as it pleaſeth him to giue.

               2 In that he calleth them men, being indeed Angells and no men, we note that cuſtome of the ſcripture that a name doth not euer conſtitute a nature. Circumciſion is called the couenant as you heard before, the Lamb the Paſſeouer, the ſeede the word, the Deuill is called Samuell, and many ſuch.

               3 For their eating, we know it was but by diſpenſation for the time, not for any neceſſitie of nature. And if you aſke what became of the meate which they did eate, the Schoolemen will readely anſwere you that it did vaniſh in the chawing, as water doth in boyling. Wiſer men aſke no ſuch queſtions, and therefore neede no ſuch anſwere. In the extraordinary dealings of God what neede wee to ſift his ſecrets, and to bee wiſe aboue ſobrietie?
            
               4 Touching his hoſpitalitie, you ſee heere how earneſtly he inuiteth them, hee ran to meet them ſayth the text, how reuerently hee vſeth them beeing but ſtrangers to him,
                  A hartie houſeholder loued of God.
                
               hee bowed downe to them, and ſpeaking to one of them in whome appeared to bee moſt maieſtie, hee giueth him the title of Lord, hee accompteth it fauour to him if they will turne in to him, &amp; take ſuch as God hath ſent, hee tearmeth himſelfe their ſeruant, and in a word he prayeth them not to go from him in any caſe, all teſtimonies of a curteous and bountifull good houſekepers nature, and true tokens of hartie welcome if they came. It is an ould ſaying, frenum &amp; veſtes veniendi ſunt tibi teſtes. When a man catcheth a man by his horſſe bridle, or by his owne clothes, and will not part with his hould till hee haue his petition, they bee tokens of no words of courſe, but inward truth and louing welcome if a man come, where as, twentie fine phraſes with when, and if, and will you, and ſuch like be but court holywater as the prouerb is, a very harty houſeholder therefore was Abraham, and that would the Lord haue noted in theſe words and geſtures in this place to theſe ſtrangers.

                we ſee the antiquitie of this modeſtie, that of a mans owne things he ſhould ſpeake with leaſt. So vſe wee to inuite men to a

pittance, or to ſome one particular morſell, when yet wee intend ſomewhat better. But whatſoeuer Abraham made ready, was all but moderate in compariſon of that vngodly exceſſe that ſome now vſe, rather to ſhewe their owne pride, then to welcome the gueſt. True welcome neuer conſiſted in meates and drinks, and multitude of diſhes, but in that affection of an inwarde heart, which truly hath appeared in a cup of water, where better abilitie wanted, and which paſſeth all diſhes and meates vnder the ſunne.

Well, good Abraham went heere to his wife when he was to haue gueſts to meate with him, and hath left behinde him an order of good rule in euery houſe in ſo doing, and chawked out ſuch hen huſwiues, or ſuch ſowre grubs as will not follow him in the like, euer I ſpeake of ſuch, as whoſe callings are not contrary

You know what the Apoſtle writeth of ſome women, to wit, that they are idle, &amp; being idle,

The text ſayth hee haſted, Sarah haſteth, the boy haſteth, and all this teacheth truly the cheerefulneſſe of their hearts in that they did, and how kindly and wiſely they conſidered circumſtances, that their ſtrangers might be weary, and peraduenture wiſh ſome refreſhing quickly, that they were trauelers, and to paſſe on their iourney, not to be ſtayed ouer long, in curioſitie to be fine, or prodigalitie to be pompouſe. Altogether confirming the common prouerb, Optimum condimentum beneficii celeritas, &amp; bis dat qui cito dat. The beſt ſawce to a good turne is to do it quickly, and who giueth ſo giueth twiſe.

Their eating was touched before, yet heere being mencioned ſo expreſſely that they did eate, your marginall note anſwereth, that as God gaue them bodyes for a time, ſo gaue he them the faculties of the ſame bodyes, as to walke, to eate and drinke, and ſuch like, and thus much in the firſt part of this Chapter ſhall ſuffice to haue noted.

If the argument folow that becauſe ſhe called him Lord ſhe obeyed him, and regarded him in his place, how ſhould it alſo follow that whome ſo often we call Lord Lord, our true Lord and God, him we ſhould obey regard and reuerence?

                  Shall any thing be hard to the Lord? By which words we may remember that vſuall diuiſion of the things wherein our faith vſeth to ſlip, that they are either matters touching Gods wil, Gods conſtancie, or Gods power, as alſo what godly aduiſe teacheth vs to oppoſe againſt them, namely theſe three, his goodnes, his truth, &amp; his power: to a doubt of his will, the firſt, to a doubt of his ſtedfaſtnes in his promiſe, the ſecond, and to all doubts of his power, his might and omnipotence, the third. Sarah reſpecting too much the courſe of nature, doubted of the laſt, and you ſee how the Angell anſwereth by his mighty omnipotencie, Shall any thing be hard to the Lord? No. Now becauſe this place is abuſed by the Papiſts, iudge I pray you how this argument

foloweth. Hee is able to giue a childe, which hee in good will hath promiſed, therefore hee hath and doth in the Sacrament make bread his body really, which he neuer willed, meant, or promiſed? He will do it, ergo he can do it, is euer true, but he can do it,

                   therefore he will do it, doth not euer follow. I ſpeake not what God cannot do, and yet no want of power in him, but a more perfit power, as it ſhould be a weakeneſſe in him, and not a power if hee could do them. But this I ſay if an argument from his power to his will do not follow, then much leſſe from want of both power and will to his deede doth any ſequeale lye. I call that power now, which in deede as I ſayd were no power but weakeneſſe if God could do, his word or his nature being to the contrary. But what do they cōſider that bring doctrines to the word, and would haue the word confirme them, not learning all doctrines from the word as they ſhould.

                   where wee reade that Abraham went to bring them on the way, noted no doubt by the Lord,
                     Perfit curteſye.
                   to tell how euery way Abraham vſed his gueſts with hys beſt kindneſſe. Alacriter inuitare, to inuite hartely, liberaliter tractare, to feaſt chearefully, comiter dimittere, and to ſend away friendly and kindly a ſtranger or gueſt, it is perfit hoſpitalitie, and very true and commendable curteſye. And this we ſee heere was in Abraham, who vnto the former added this, that at parting he brought them on the way. Surely this mention made of theſe things by the Lorde, is a very great teſtimony of his great good liking of them.
               
                  2 Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?

                        O ſweete.
                     
                   Why then becauſe the Lord hath been good, hee will bee good, and adde mercy to mercye? In deed it is ſo, and what a comfort is this? Can any tongue expreſſe or hart conceyue thys goodneſſe of the Lord? To drawe an argument from his firſt mercy to a ſecond, and from a ſecond to a third, and ſo euer on frō mercy to mercy. O ſweetneſſe and goodneſſe. This knewe Dauid well, and therefore in euery Pſalme almoſt he prayeth hym to be good to hym, becauſe he hath been good to hym before. Thou haſt ſet mee at libertie when I was in trouble,

                  therefore ſtill haue pittie vpon mee, and regard me, &amp;c. In the Epiſtle to the Romanes the Apoſtle thus reaſoneth alſo,
                     Rom. 8.32.
                   concluding that ſince God had not ſpared his owne Sonne, but gaue him for vs to death, therefore it could not be but with him he ſhould giue vs all things alſo. Man vſeth to reaſon thus, I haue bin good, therefore he may not grate vpon me any more, and I haue done a very great good vnto him, therefore in all equitie &amp; reaſon I am not further to be vrged. But our ſweete and gracious God quite contrary, I haue been good, and therefore I will be ſtill and euer good, and the greater benefites I haue ſhewed, the more ſure it is I will not ſtand at the leſſer, but from the more to the leſſe with me ſhall be euer a ſure ſequele. And if I haue beſtowed mine owne Sonne vpon man euen to death, how ſhould it bee thought that with him I will not giue farre leſſer things alſo. O ſweet agayne I muſt needes ſaye, for what man or woman hath not thouſands of mercyes

from the Lord, and therein euen ſo many comforts to his 
                     •
                  ealt, that he will neuer forſake him, but I may bouldlye and with a cheerefull heart, ſay, O Lord be mercifull vnto me, not becauſe I haue beene a good ſeruant to thee, but becauſe thou haſt beene a good God to me. If my obedience were to be the argument why thou ſhouldeſt ſhow me fauour, my heart were gone, for I knowe mine owne wickedneſſe, and my ſinne is euer before mee. But ſince thy former goodneſſe in thy ſweete mercy, are arguments to thee of more goodneſſe to bee ſhowed by thee to the former, O Lorde I abound with ſuch arguments to mooue thy maieſtie bleſſed bee thy name for them, and I praye thee my God and my comfort ſo gratious and kinde, to adde mercy to mercy, fauour to fauour, and help to help in this neede of mine, that I owing thee now my ſelf, for ſo many mercies, I may for more owe thee more then my ſelfe, or my ſelfe, many and many times to loue thee, to feare thee, to ſerue thee, and praiſe thee, whilſt I haue a daye to liue. Thus may we chaw this comfort in our mindes, and taſt the ſweete of it.
               
                  5 Yet if wee haue any care of the Lords glorye, ſurelye the Lorde hath a quicke eye to ſee it, and euen for that alſo in mercye he will doo for vs and to vs, for behould what followeth here as a ſecond reaſon, why the Lord will reueyle his purpoſe to Abraham, and hide nothing from him. For I knowe him ſaith he, that he will commaund his ſonnes, &amp;c. A good thing to moue vs to all obedience generallye, which the Lorde euer ſeeth, and to this particularly of teaching and inſtructing our families and companyes,

                   which the Lorde heereby (to ſet an obſeruation of it) moſte greatly commendeth. Abraham did it, and God highly extolleth it, we cannot abide it, and ſhall he likewiſe prayſe vs? Abraham did it, ſo many hundred yeare a goe, and is it nowe but a new deuiſe, that is not needefull? Surely, conclude thus, and it is moſte true, he inſtructed his familie, that they might know as he knew: and religion, and the ſeruice of God, liue in them to the glorye of God, when hee was gone. And for this God will hide nothing from ſo carefull a ſeruant: wee will not do it, but are bothe ignorant our ſelues, and let others bee alſo, caring not what betommeth

of Gods glorye, either in our life or after our death, and therefore from ſo careleſſe wretches hee will hide all his ſecrets, all his counſels, yea all his comfortes, and the lighte of his countenance, for euer. Beware, beware then, whileſt we haue time to amend and reforme this fault.

                   ſo fowle and greeuous, that it euen cryeth, and ſhriketh in the eares of the Lorde for vengeance. Caine thy brothers bloude cryeth to mee out of the earth, &amp;c.
               
               Shall we then nouriſhe and foſter that with ſuch pleaſure, that day nor night ceaſeth to ſolicite the Lorde againſt vs, yea to crye in his eare, that he would awake and plague vs? Surelye that man, that woulde crye ſtill againſt vs but to man, we would abhorre and hate, and that which cryeth lowder then all the men in the worlde can, and that to God himſelfe, and for greater puniſhment then any man can inflict, wee are ſo farre from hating, that wee hate him that perſwadeth vs to hate it.
               Thys is ſtraung madneſſe, if wee would conſider it. The Drunkardes drunkenneſſe cryeth agaynſt him, and will not ſuffer the Lorde to reſt tyll hee puniſh it, and yet hee loueth it, ſo dooth the Swearer, Adulterer, and ſuche like, theyr ſinnes crye againſt them, &amp;c.

And the Texte telleth vs, Hee ſtoode yet before the Lorde, and entreth into a zealous and carefull conſideration, bothe of the Lordes glorye, and Iuſtice, as alſo of the good of as manye faythfull as might bee founde in Sodome, and with all humilitye pleadeth for them bothe: his wordes you ſee, and marke them well.

And I warrant you this Angell which was Chriſt, controlleth not his ſpeech as vntrue, but letteth it paſſe as verye right. And as hee tyeth not righteouſneſſe and ſaluation to the ſacrament, ſo neither dooth he it to his owne life, but euen then hee knew it true, that Peter after long preached, that though God choſe him and his for his peculiar people,

                  13 When he aſketh whether the Iudge of all the worlde ſhould not do right, hee reaſoneth from the Lordes office, and teacheth vs, that with humble bouldneſſe we may do ſo in our earneſt deſires: as ſhall not the father pittie his childe, and helpe him, &amp;c. Lord thou art my father then, for thy place ſake, pittie

me, helpe me, ſaue me, and keepe me, I beſeeche thee and praye thee, &amp;c.
               
                  
                     With what humilitie God is to be prayed vnto.
                  
                  14 In his title of duſt and aſhes, ſo often applyed to himſelfe, we ſee all of vs, both the humble conceit that this great Patriarch had of himſelfe, as alſo the reuerent humilitie he ſpake to his God withall. Two ſpeciall things for our vſe in theſe dayes, wherein we are puffed vp, and ſwell with filthye pride and forgetfulneſſe of our ſelues, as though wee were made of ſome farre more precious matter then duſt and aſhes, and wherein we ſpeake to our God as vnreuerently and raſhlye, as euer did anye prophane minde, for many of vs, without any ſuch ſpirite of lowlineſſe and dread, as heere was in Abraham, not conſidering what we are, and what God is, how vnworthy we are, to ſpeake or breath before him. But we ſwap vs downe in our places moſt vnreuerently, and then we ſtare, and looke, and gape, and yawne, and huddle and tumble vp ſome vnliked prayers of the Lorde, not onely without any profit to vs, but to our great harme, for ſo vndutifully vſing the name of God. Well thinke heereafter of this example of Abraham better, and amend both theſe faults.
               
                  15 It is worthy marking againe, how Abraham iterateth his requeſts one after an other, from fiftie to ten, and yet the Lorde is not angrie, but heareth him patiently, and kindely maketh anſwer to euery one, he will not do it for ſo many ſake. And is he changed from this kindneſſe now, if I do the like vpon occaſion. No no, our God is one for euer, not ſubiect to change, and therefore bouldly and comfortably doe as your neede conſtrayneth, hee will abide you, and anſwer you as ſhalbe fit.
               
                  
                     O comfort
                  Laſtlye marke it, and forget it neuer, Abraham maketh an end of intreating, before God of hearing him. O ſweete, O deere, and gracious God, what ioye is this, can my ſoule wiſhe a greater mercy, then that I maye ſpeake on, and he will heare, yea that I ſhall giue ouer firſt, and not hee, when once I ſue vnto his Maieſtie? Lord make vs profitable vſers of this mercie.

               1 He calleth them Angels, who before were called men, and therein we may note the manner of the ſcriptures and word of God,
                  Verſe. 1.
                  
                how it vſeth by one place to lighten and expounde an other,
                  One place of ſcripture expoundeth an other.
                expreſſing more plainely to auoide doubt, what before was more obſcure, &amp; might cauſe doubt. Againe in ſo expreſſely ſaying they were Angels, that fooliſh conceipt is ouerthrowne, that they were theſe three, the three perſons in Trinitie, as alſo that moſt wicked blaſphemy of ſome heathniſh ſpirits, that Sodome was deſtroyed by Necromancie, to wit, by fire procured by that art: when the Lord as he vſeth, executed his wrath by his Angels.

You ſee the ſtate of that citie, how generall the euill was, and howe fearefully it had ſpred it ſelfe, through all the vaines &amp; members of that place, that there was none good, but the ſpirit of God ſaith, all, all. A lamentable eſtate of any place whatſoeur, when iniquitie ſhall ouerflowe all, and would God we drew not toward ſuch fearefull meaſure now vnder the Goſpell, when it may bee obſerued to a maygame, a Beare bayting, a prophane ſtage playe vpon the Lordes daye, and many ſuch things, how wee compaſſe the place round about, as heere is ſayd theſe Sodomites did, from the yonge to the ould, euen all the people from all quarters. Verely the words

of the Holyghoſt to iumpe vppon vs, and may very truly be ſayd of vs, and the Lord preuent by mercy and fauour, in chaunging vs from ſuch lewde likings, that ſuch iudgement and wrath doe not iumpe alſo vpon vs, as it did vpon theſe men. Marke againe you may, when he ſayth all were ſuch, the nature of ſinne how it ſpreadeth and infecteth, firſt one and then an other, till it haue gone ouer all. It is the deuils leauen, which ſtayeth not, till it haue leauened the whole lumpe, and therefore happie is the place where it beginneth not: for it ſpreadeth quickely and largelye and dangerouſlie.
            
               3 Their ſhameleſſe ſpeeche to haue the men brought out that they might knowe them,

                  Cuſtome of ſinne.
                the impudencie that ſinne affecteth in time, when it once getteth rule. Surely it taketh all modeſtie, and ſhame, and honeſtye awaye, and prooueth the ſaying to be moſt true: Conſuetudo peccandi tollit ſenſum peccati. The cuſtome of ſinne taketh awaye all ſenſe and feeling of ſinne. At the beginning men ſhame to haue it knowne what they doo, though they feare not to doo it, and they will vſe all cloakes and couers that poſſibly they can to hide their wickedneſſe. But at laſt they growe bould and impudent as theſe men did, euen to ſay, what care we. And why? Certainelie becauſe this is the courſe of ſinne in Gods iudgement, that it ſhall benum and harden the heart wherein it is ſuffered, and ſo feare vp the conſcience and conceipt in time, that there ſhall bee no ſhame left, but ſuch a thicke viſard pulled ouer the face, that it can bluſh at nothing, eyther to ſaye it or doe it. Behould theſe braſen browed wretches heere, who after long vſe of ſinne (no doubt at firſt more ſecret, are now come to require theſe men openly, and to tell the cauſe, that they mighe know them, without all ſhame or ſparke of ſhame, in and at ſo horrible abhomination. Maruell not then any more, that the adulterer bluſheth not, the drunkard ſhameth not, nor the blaſpheming ſwearer, hideth not his face. You ſee the reaſon, cuſtome to doo euill in that kinde, hath vtterly bereaued him of feeling and ſhame, as it did theſe Sodomites. A heauy and fearefull caſe, for Gods plague is euen at the doore of ſuch people, as you ſee it was heere for theſe Sodomites.

                  Ignorance excuſeth not from ſinne, but from leſſe or more.
                In the firſt remember, that if hee had wronged the woman, hee had not knowne it was any mans wife, but tooke her as ſhee ſayde, that ſhee was his Siſter, yet ſinne ſayth the Lord had it bin, and thou haddeſt ſinned againſt me in doing it. A good caueat for thoſe that thinke ignorance ſhall ſalue ſores, &amp;c. Surely they are farre wide. Ignorance may excuſe a tanto, but neuer a toto. Ignorance may leſſen faults, but not change their natures. Sinne ſhall be ſinne though I doo it ignorantly. The latter teacheth vs,
                  Sinne againſt man is ſinne againſt God.
                that all ſinnes againſt the ſecond Table, and our dutie towards our neighbours, redound to the breach of the firſt Table alſo, and are chalenged by the Lord as offences agaynſt hys Maieſtie. Againſt mee, againſt mee, ſayeth the Lorde. By

name, this ſinne of adultery and whoredome, it reacheth to the Lord, and ſtayeth not at the womans huſband, or the mans wife, and the Lord will be reuenged of it. Thinke of it yee adulterers and adultereſſes, and knowe it betimes:
                  O note.

The ſinne is agaynſt hym aſwell as the man, and no gifts, no bribes, no cunning, can ſtoppe hym nor ſtaye hym: as hee is GOD, hee wyll haue vengeance for hys parte, and thou muſt haue as ſowre ſawce to thy ſweete meate, as his dreadfull iuſtice can giue thee.

                and in deede the onely teſtimonie of a touched heart, when knowledge reformeth what ignorance committed. Aſſoone as hee knewe, hee reſtored her. Contrarywiſe, when wee perſiſt in that afterknowledge, which want of knowledge let vs fall into, what touch is there, what token or teſtimonie of God his working ſpirit? Surely all is dead there, and the vaynes of ſpirituall life froſen vp: that man or womans ende ſhall be worſe then their beginning, thoſe later ſinnes are more vgly then the former, and hell and damnation haue euen ſeazed and taken poſſeſſion of ſuch ſoules to eternall woe.

no more touch, feeling, ſenſe, remorſe, nor amendment, then was in the dayes of our ignorance and deepeſt darkeneſſe? Truly it cannot be but this heathen King will accuſe vs in the great day if it be not better with vs.

                  A good thing to inferiors the admonition of ſuperiors.
                that when hee was vp thus earely, hee called all hys ſeruants together and telleth them all: both to take away all ſuſpicion of hys fact with Abrahams wife, and ſo to cleere her credit which hee was to bee carefull of, and alſo to teache hys ſeruants by hys example euer whilſt they liued to beware. So carefull are good mindes not onely of themſelues, but of theyr charge. And how much the ſerious and earneſt warning of ſo great a perſonage may doo, I referre to your experience. Would God ſuch warnings and ſpeaches were more often made by ſuch. But becauſe you ſhould not doubt of it, the ſpirit of God hymſelfe hath teſtified ſo much in this place, and ſayth, they were all afrayde. See then the piercing power of a good exhortation or admonition made by a ſuperiour. Therefore agayne I ſay greatly to be wiſhſhed they would ſpeake more often.

                   that a true touched heart indeede with the word of God is not prowde nor diſdaynfull, but admitteth of farre inferiors vpon occaſion to ſpeach. If this King had followed the cuſtomes of ſome in our dayes that be no Kings, nor Gods neyther, hee would haue ſent out a meſſage to Abraham by ſome page, boye or woman, and haue kept his ſtate, with great diſdayne that a ſtranger as Abraham was, ſhould come to ſpeach with his owne perſon.

And it is a ſpeach that would wonderfully profit vs if wee woulde vſe it to our ſelues now and then, demaunding of our ſelues what we haue done. The drunkard, if God gaue him an hart to ſay alas what haue I done, ſurely hee woulde amend, ſo the ſwearer, the ſlanderer, and ſuch lyke.
               
                  3 What haue wee ſinned ſayth hee, wee, wee. A notable eſtate when a Gouernour ioyneth himſelfe with his people in this to auoyde ſinne,

                   caring that neyther they nor hee doo any thing that may bee ſinne and offend: and ſtill carry your eye vpon it, how hee calleth ſinne, ſinne in himſelfe aſwell as any others, no way excuſing or ſhifting or diminiſhing the matter with reſpects of yeares, of eſtate, of frayltie, or any ſuch like, and yet hee an heathen, and wee Chriſtians.
               
                  4 Vpon mee and my kingdome ſayth hee, full well confeſſing agayne that a ſuperiour ſinneth not to the hurt of hymſelfe alone.

                     Miniſtring occaſion of ſinne.
                   and ſo gaue occaſion to the King to offend, to his owne harme and his kingdomes. Well then we learne that to giue one occaſion to ſinne, is to bring ſinne vpon him,
                     Note.
                   and therefore wee muſt make more conſcience heereafter of miniſtring occaſions, then happely heeretofore wee haue done.

                     Adultery by ignorance a great ſin.
                   but a great ſinne, a ſtrange ſinne, and a thing that ought not to be done. You knowe our dayes, and the manners of the ſame, I ſay no more, your ſelues be iudges whether Heathens and Pagans ſhall not riſe in iudgement againſt ſome that cannot ſaye they knewe not that ſhee was his wife, and yet no remorſe. Doo theſe men thinke there is a God? a hell, any damnation, or ſaluation?

would God they did. It would wring ſome grace out of them, if not for loue, yet for feare.
               
                  7 In Abrahams anſwere, that hee thought the feare of God was not in that place,
                  
                     Verſe. 11
                     
                   
                  
                     The feare of God as a banke.
                   
                  and therefore they woulde kill him for his wiues ſake. You ſee what holdeth out, and what letteth in all wickednes into a place, be it kingdome, or towne, or houſe. If the feare of God be there, the banke is ſtrong, the fluds of lewde life cannot ouerflow: but if it be not, no thing ſo horrible but it will enter: yea euen this in Abrahams iudgement, that a man ſhall be murdered for his owne wife. Happy then is the place where this feare is, and curſſed where it wanteth.
               Laſtly, the Kings gifts and liberalitie to Abraham, his kinde offer of his land to dwell in, his good nip that he gaue to Sarah for her diſſembling, ſaying, hee was her brother, whome God had giuen her for her huſband, and to be a veyle to ſhield her, and couer her from all harmes, are good fruites of a hart moued with that which God had ſayd to him and for our inſtruction. Alſo that Abraham prayeth for him hartely and vnfaynedly, and is in perfit loue and charitie with him, though ſomewhat he had wronged him is worthy noting. And laſtly, how when ſinne is reformed, God altereth his puniſhments, and taketh them away, healeth all the houſe whome hee had cloſed vp from bearing of children, with ſuch other things, are matters of profit to vs if wee marke them. Bleſſed is that man and woman that heareth God warning them, obeyeth his warning willingly as this King did, abhorreth that which is euill with him, and with ſpeede and care reformeth things amiſſe, as he did, for ſuch will all godly Abrahams pray, and God by them will be intreated to take puniſhments away, and to put mercies in their place to his great prayſe and their great comfort euermore.

               The generall heads of this Chapter are theſe three.

                     The birth of Iſaack from the 1. to the 14.
                     The baniſhment of Agar from the 14. to the 22.

                It doth aſſure vs thus much, that the word hath not paſſed Gods lips euer, which proued not true, and ſhall proue true to the worlds end. Truth being eſſentiall to him, and he neuer changeling: onely this there is, a ſeaſon and time appoynted, either reuealed or otherwiſe, which wee muſt expect. Tary that and all ſhall be well, for ſo did Sara heere, and the godly elſewhere euer, and had their deſires.

                That Sacrament then, as this now, are ſacraments and ſignes of our new birth. Fitly therefore by the receipt of our names at ſuch time ſhould we euer when we heare them be remembred, that wee haue promiſed to God and his Church that we will be new men.

                  That mothers ſhould nurſe their owne children.
                An ancient and good example to be folowed of all women, that haue no true inabilitie indeed to denye it. For to this end hath God prouided nouriſhment for it in the mothers breſt, that it might be ſo. The earth alſo nouriſheth the plants and hearbes which ſhe bringeth foorth. The tree no leſſe with her ſap and ſuck, the bowes and branches that ſpring out of her. All other creatures do the like, be they neuer ſo fearce. The Tygar, the Wolfe, the Beare, and the Lion, yet gentle to their young ones, and giue them ſuck. Shall onely women more vnkindely then any, deny them nouriſhment? The mother is content, when ſhee cannot ſee it, nor handle it, but hath it in her bodye to nouriſh it, yea and to abide many a ſharpe nip and pinche for it, eating this, and forbearing that, as ſhall be beſt for her childe ſhe goeth with: and when it is borne, that they may ſee it, and h

Laſtlye the dangers of this are not few, if they were well conſidered. For manye a diſeaſe and ill qualitie is drawne with the milke from a bad Nurſe, beſide that experience teacheth vs, that many plants will neuer proſper, except they haue of their owne earth about them. All theſe things then perſwade vs aſmuch as may bee, to folowe Sarah heere this good Woman, and to nurſe vp our little Iſaacs that God dooth giue our ſelues. Yet neceſſitie hath no lawe, I knowe it true, but let not wanton vnwillingneſſe, nor vnwilling, wantonneſſe, bee neceſſitie. Iudge of this thing in a godlye feeling according to your place, and other true circumſtances, and I leaue it to you, I preſcribe to none, neither ſaye anye more.
            
               
               5 When the wayning time came, Abraham made a feaſt, yea a great feaſt,
               
                  Verſe 8.
                  
                ſaith the texte, and it teacheth vs the libertie of Gods children,
                  Cuſtomes ought not peeuiſhly to be carped at.
                according to places and times wherein they liue, touching ſuch matters and cuſtomes as this is. We our ſelues haue our faſhions and vſes at birth, at Baptiſme, at the mothers going to church to giue thankes, in hir lying in, &amp;c. What may well bee done, and ſuffred and liked, let it not be peeuiſhly, waywardly, ſpitefully, and vniuſtly traduced: For this very feaſt and faſhion of Abraham might be cenſured, if to finde faulte were to ſpeake true, if malice were zeale, and a frowarde nature were a good minde by and by. Surely as the Apoſtle ſaide, To the cleane all things are cleane,
               
                  Tit. 1.15.
                ſo ſaye I to meeke and modeſt mindes, all cuſtomes that may any waye be charitably interpreted are acceptable, &amp; as he ſayth againe, but vnto them that are defiled &amp; vnbeleeuing, nothing is pure, but euen their minds &amp; conſciences are defiled, ſo ſay I vnto thoſe that are waſpiſh, and wayward, ſpitefull and froward, euery thing that they fanſie not, is vncleane and vnlawfull, eyther Heathniſh or Iewiſh, or popiſh, or ſomewaye intollerable, and their fanſie is regularerum the rule of right, vnto which all mens dooings muſt be framed, if ther be peace. But there is a rule, that all godly mindes preferre before all ſuch rules, to wit, euen the rule of the bleſſed Apoſtle, If any man luſt to be contentious,

                  Mocking and mockers bee odious.
                the ſonne of the promiſe. See in a figure the condition and order of the world. The vngodly are mockers, gibers, flowters and flirers, at ſuch as the Lorde hath looked vpon in more mercy, then he hath vpon them, and it is no new thing. Patience muſt paſſe it ouer, and God will paye it home as he did this. This mocking they take to be but a ſmall fault, if any at all, but the Apoſtle ſaith it is bitter and cruell perſecution. Peruſe the place, Galat. 4.29.

               7. That Sarah ſpied it, and not Abraham, the reaſon might eyther bee in her more vſuall beeing which the children then Abraham
               
was, or in her affection, which was not ſo good to Iſmaell, as Abrahams was: hee being Father, and not ſhee mother. Nowe wee knowe it well, that miſlike quicklye ſpyeth a faulte, when affection to the partye is ſomewhat darker eyed.
            
               8 She craueth of Abraham, that both mother and Childe may for this cauſe be caſt out,

                  Mocking puniſhed.
                and admoniſhed Abraham that it ſhould be ſo. It noteth vnto vs how mocking and ſcoffing flyring and gyring, pride and vanitie, and the contempt of Gods promiſes, neuer ſcapeth Gods iudgement, but is both obſerued and puniſhed ſome waye or other, firſt or laſt. Naye marke it more, which in deed is more, the Childes fault is the mothers ſmarte alſo,
                  Childs fault mothers wo alſo.
                and ſhe likewiſe muſt be caſt out by Gods owne ſentence. For happilye ſhe ſawe and heard theſe mockes, and rebuked them not, but cockered and dandled ſuch wicked beginnings in hir young impe: but very ſure I am in our dayes many fooliſh mothers doe it, and are ſo vainelye pleaſed with theyr children, that euen their faults pleaſe them alſo. But let them marke this example, and prouoke not God. He is as able, and let them feare it, to caſt both them and their children out of his houſe for euer, as heere Abraham was, theſe two out of his.

                   then marke how ſtreight Abraham leaueth, and forſaketh all priuate

affection to childe or mother, and obeyeth Gods commaundement. So ſo muſt it bee with vs, if Abraham his ſpirit be in vs. And what an example ſhould this bee to all Parents to gouerne theyr mindes by. Abraham was godlye, Iſmael his owne fleſhe, and childe, yet he executeth the Lords will vpon his owne childe, to his ſmart, and vpon the mother alſo, preferring Gods will before them both, and forſaking them, rather then Gods commandement. What ſhall or can our doting affections anſwer to this example? Murders, adulteries, blaſphemies, and ſwearings, are ſuffered by vs, with many mo, and no correction done. No it is to be feared, manye of vs had rather ſhake of all Gods commandements, then once make our children ſmart a daye. But be wiſe, be wiſe, and regarde ſuch good examples as this, when wee meete with them.

                   A liuely example of Gods iuſtice vpon ſeruantes, that being in good place cannot be thankefull to God, and dutifull to their maiſters, but will ſo behaue themſelues, that they looſe that place. Such wander many times vp and downe, to theyr great greefe and ſhame, and want both in back and belly thoſe comforts which they had very eaſily and largely, if they could haue conſidered it. Nay, which is more, theyr wandring and wante, many times brings heauie and dolefull ends, to their ignominie in this worlde, howſoeuer they eſcape in the worlde to come. Wherefore let all ſuch as are well, and liue well, be they ſeruants or other, remember this example of Agar, thruſt out from ſo good a place, and now deſolately, and heauily, wandring with her poore childe vp and downe the wilderneſſe.

Firſt obſerue, how affliction foloweth affliction, and one greefe in the necke of an other, when once God beginneth to exerciſe vs. Shee loſt her place, ſhee wandreth in the wilderneſſe with her childe, comfortleſſe and deſolate, the water

of the bottle is ſpent, and no more to be had, when the child cryeth for drinke, and is readye to dye for it: and laſtly, ſhee giueth her child vp to death, as ſhe thought, getting her farre of, as vnable to heare the crye of it. The leaſt of all which, was a bitter pange to her that taſted it. Let it ſchoole vs if the Lord ſo deale with vs, we are not priuiledged, we haue no immunitie.

               Learne wee then carefully, as I ſayde before, both howe croſſe followeth croſſe, and how ſtill greater and greater, and the laſt the

worſt of all, if it pleaſe God ſo, and let vs harden our ſelues for it, in his holy feare, and not be ouer tender. Secondlye obſerue wee againe the diuers paſſions of loue heerein, either of parents to children,
                     Diuers effects of loue in friends.
                   or freend to freend. Some cannot be drawne from them eyther daye or night, when they are like to dye, and it is a great loue, and a good. But heere it is otherwiſe, for the mothers heart cannot abide to ſee the childe dye, and this alſo becauſe ſhee loued it. So are manye where they loue intirely. Thus differ our diuers natures euen in one thing, and wee haue our diuers reaſons vpon diuers circumſtances. Bleſſed is the partie, whoſe affections draweth neereſt the Lords alowance, and an holy patience. Laſtly conſider it, &amp; that not a little how in this bitter agonie, &amp; moſt heauie plight,
                     Agar rayleth not as ſome do.
                   yet ſhee neither openeth her mouth againſt the Lorde, nor againſt the meanes of her woe Abraham &amp; Sarah, no not againſt Sarah, that was the firſt and cheefe cauſe indeed, to ſtirre vp Abraham to put her away. No curſſing, no banning, no rauing nor railing, is heard out of her. A very great commendation of her, and a very great want in our dayes, in ſome, that thinke themſelues no common Chriſtians, for that thing almoſt hapneth not croſſe to theyr mindes, but the verye ayre almoſt is infected with theyr bannings, bee it neuer ſo ſmall, and of no accompt. Theyr ſoule is acquainted with bitterneſſe altogether, and theyr tongues cannot but take like courſe. What would theſe doe, if they were as greatlye greeued as Agar was. Naye whether would they haue ſent Sarah, eſpeciallye if they had beene in her caſe.
               Surelye, ſurelye, neyther Abraham, nor Sarah, nor God I feare me, ſhould haue eſcaped curſes manye and great, but for Sarah, ſhe ſhould haue beene curſſed to the deepe pit of Hell ten thouſand times and further, if ſin ther were any further torment to be had for her. But learne. O ſi

                  ie and furious Spirites, euen by Agar heere, an other leſſon, followe it and vſe it with carefull hearts, if you meane not to brue for your ſelues in hell, what you wiſhe to others.

                   O mercye and comfort, marke it if wee bee aliue.

When the greefe is at the top, and the caſe at the worſte, when the worlde and all worldlye meanes are giuen ouer, then God is neereſt, preſent, and at hande, and ſendeth his Angel to ſuccoure this comfortleſſe Woman and her Childe, to his eternall prayſe and her greater ioye then euer tongue can tell. The Lorde heard the voyce of the Childe, ſaith the 17 verſe, and the Angell cryed from Heauen to her. Who will diſpayre of God and his helpe whilſt life is in him, that heareth, and ſeeth, and marketh this? Shall it euer fall out, that the ſeede of Iacob ſhall wante releefe, when Iſmaell the mocker is not neglected? Cannot God forget his promiſe, and let Iſmaell dye, and can hee forget all his promiſes in Chriſt Ieſus ſealed,

O farre bee it from our ſoules to thinke it, and our heartes to feare it.

                     True piety purchaſeth true reuerence.
                   which is the third generall head in this Chapter, you ſee the occaſion of it in the 22, verſe. Namely becauſe they ſaw God to be with Abraham in all that he did. See we by it, how the godly are feared, euen of men farre greater then themſelues, for theyr holy walking before the Lord, and his gratious countenance to them againe.
                     Mark. 6.20.
                   So we read of Herod, that he feared Iohn, and reuerenced him, becauſe he was a iuſt man and holy, not for any worldly pompe or outward ſtrength that he was able to make, to hurt him by, for his coate was heary, his girdle of a ſkin: and yet ſtracke the vertue of his life, &amp; maieſtie of his calling through the golden Robes of Herod to his very hart, and made him afraid of him. Great is the power then of true vertue, and would God we would marke it, as alſo the dignitie of the calling of the miniſterie, if it be maintained.
               
                  2 The kings requeſt being honeſt, note alſo how eaſilye Abraham yeeldeth his conſent vnto it. Euer a vertue in good men to be gentle and courteous, and eaſie to bee intreated, for lawfull things. The contrary, a fowle vice, whereſoeuer it is moroſitie and frowardneſſe euen in euery thing.
               
                  
                     Coſt is not euer well ſpared.
                  Laſtly that Abraham giueth ſheepe and beenes, &amp;c. learne we not onely, howe lawfull, but howe wiſe a thing it is, and commendable, both to get and maintaine peace with our coſt ſometimes, and that it is not euer by and by well ſpared, that pinchingly and peltingly is ſpared. But it is euen verified in that manye and many a time, penny wiſe and pound fooliſh. Thus this chapter endeth, and we may end alſo with Dauids remembrance concerning wiſedom, that the feare of God is the beginning of it, a good vnderſtanding haue all they that doe thereafter,

               OF particulars this firſt, that it is ſayde after theſe things,
                  Verſe 1.
                  
                
               God did prooue Abraham, &amp;c. That is,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                after ſo many tryals now already paſſed and ſpoken of, yet God tryed him againe, and harder then euer before, namely in the ſacrificing of his owne and onely ſonne. What ſhould wee learne by it, but this, that there is no time limited, no age freed, no perſon exempted, no not Abraham in his oulde age, but whilſt life laſteth, ſo long ſhall Gods exerciſes be incident vnto vs. And euen ſtill the later the greater peraduenture, if ſo God thinke it good, yet all for the beſt, for eyther they make our faith and vertue appeare, and ſo God is glorified for his graces giuen vnto vs, and others are helped by our example, or els our infirmitie ſhoweth it ſelfe to the greater humbling of vs, and driuing vs to prayer, for greater ſtrength, Remember alſo the great honour that Abimilech the King had ſhewed him preſentlye before, and nowe marke what followeth the death of his Sonne, for any thing hee knoweth. Thus is the lyfe of Gods Children, a mixture of ſweete and ſowre, and a continuall interchange of ſorrowe and comforte, comforte and ſorrowe.
            
               2 Let vs obſerue the degrees or amplification of this croſſe of Abraham, by ſome circumſtances that are layde downe,
                  The circumſtāces that amplifie this tryall.
               
               
as firſt, that Abraham muſt take him and ſacrifice him his owne ſelfe, and with his owne handes, a great matter, and far more then if he had giuen him ouer to an other. Secondly of the perſon to be taken, who was he, thy ſonne ſayth the Text, and not thy ſeruant. Thirdly thy Sonne, and not thy wiues Sonne alone, as ſome ſonnes be. Fourthly, vnicum thy onely Sonne Iſaac. Fiftlye, whome thou loueſt, all circumſtances of great moment, and greatly to be 
                  〈◊〉
                of vs, that wee may knowe in what ſorte God, God will be bould with vs his creatures, and workemanſhip, when it pleaſeth him. Wee muſt not thinke it ſtrange, to be exerciſed euen in thoſe things that are deere vnto vs. But whatſoeuer they are, ſtil to remember, that he which loueth any thing more then God,
               
                  Luc. 14.26.
                
               is not worthie of him. Sixtlye that hee muſt goe with him three dayes iourney ere he offred him. For the olde ſaying is acerbiſſimae mora quae trahit paenam, &amp; miſericordiae genus eſt cito occidere morti deſtinatum. Bitter is the delay, when puniſhment muſt followe, and it is a kinde of mercy to kill quicklye, who appointed once is to bee killed. Certainely, the griping thoughts and twitching paſſions, that Abraham felt in his minde during theſe three dayes, made this tryall of his farre greater, then it had beene, if preſentlye hee ſhould haue ſmit that blowe. Laſtlye, that hee muſt offer him for a burnte offring: O depth of tryall, able to haue ſwallowed vs vp, a thouſand of vs: bothe to laye his handes vpon his deere Sonne, and then to burne him to aſhes, when hee had doone, his owne ſelfe making and tending the fire, till all was doone, and putting peece after pe
                  •
               ce into the flame, when any was without, and with his owne eyes to ſee all this, and to looke vpon it. Heere is a tryall, to tell vs what God may doe, if it pleaſe him. This hee did to one farre better then anye of vs, and yet wee muſt bee nice, and tender, and dayntie, and if GOD touche vs but with the ache of a finger, or a toe, wee ſtraight thinke hee dealeth hardelye with vs, and hee hath forgotten his loue. But O learne, learne, and ſee this.

                  ppe with the ordinarye proppes, no doubte of Gods truthe and omnipotencie. The nature of which, is eyther to vphoulde other. For his truthe vphouldeth his omnipotencie, and hys omnipotencie his truth. And this his obedience is ſet out euen from the beginning, to the lifting vp of the very knife.
               
                  2 Wee maye heere obſerue,
                     How the commandements of God ſeeme ſo harde, 
                           •
                        r to whome.
                   what maketh the commaundements of God ſeeme ſo hard vnto men. Surely not ſo much the nature of the commaundements, as theyr nature to whome they are giuen, which being crooked and corrupt, maruelouſlie fighteth and rebelleth againſt the ſame ſtronglye. For ſaye to an angrye, furious, and hote bludded man, thou muſt forgiue, and loue thy neighbour, bleſſe him, when hee curſſeth thee, doo good to him, when hee dooth hurte to thee, &amp;c. Out hee cryeth, it is impoſſible, howe can a man obey ſuch a lawe? But ſaye to an Abraham, that is, to one that is borne againe, and regenerated by the Spirite of God, in ſuch ſorte as Abraham was, who hath now God reigning in him, in ſteede of oulde corruption, offer thy onelye Sonne, beeloued and deere to thee, euen with thyne owne handes, and burne him when thou haſt doone, for a burnte offering, and you ſee heere, hee will doe it without grudging, or gayneſaying. So ſure is it, that if the Lorde haue altered our nature, His yoake is eaſie,
                  
                     Math. 11.
                   
                  and his burthen is light.
               
               Well therefore, maye wee ſaye it is with vs ſinfull men, as it is with ſicke folkes, who woonder at the ſtomackes, myrthe, and cheere, of the whole, and thinke it a verye harde matter to doe ſo. But where is the hardneſſe? Is it in the thing, or in the weakeneſſe of the ſycke?
               So I ſaye is it, when wee thinke anye parte of Gods lawe

ſo harde and harde, as manye doe.
               
                  3 In that it is mentioned, hee roſe early, to accompliſh this buſines, therein hath the Holyghoſt made manifeſt, not onely his great obedience, but his woonderfull alacritie and forwardneſſe in the ſame, a ſtrange example in ſo harde a matter. But what can not Gods ſpirite effect, if it bee powrefull in Man or woman.
               
                  
                     Freends earthly affections muſt bee warely preuented
                  
                  4 He maketh not his Wife priuie for anye thing wee can ſee in the Text, and as we may coniecture, for feare ſhe ſhould hinder him by any womanly weakeneſſe or motherlye teares, from his bounden and purpoſed obedience. Which if it were ſo, fitly dooth it admoniſh vs to doe the like, when we iuſtly can thinke, that our freends affections will anye waye tempt vs or totter vs agaynſt the Lords commaundements.
               
                  5 Abraham tooke the wood of the burnte offring, and layde it vpon Iſaac his ſonne,

                     How to anſwer in things yet hidden.
                   
                  but where is the Lambe for the burnt offring. O pricke and wounde to the Fathers heart no doubte, when the Childe thus ſpake. But hee was reſolued, God, not naturall affections muſt now bee obeyed. Therefore hee taketh courage to him in a godly determination, and conceyling all ſtill from the Childe, anſwereth him, My ſonne God will prouide him a Lambe for a burnt offring, and ſo wente on with the Childe ſtill. In which anſwer of his beeing of Gods prouidence, in a caſe hidden and ſecret, as yet, wee are notablye taught in all diſtreſſes, what to hope, and what to ſaye: Surelye euen as Abraham did to hys Chylde in this place, Dominus parabit, The Lorde

ſhall prouide.
                   If the wife ſaye with Tobias wife, what ſhall we doe, we are poore, where ſhall wee haue bread for our Children, where this, and where that. O be content, The Lorde ſhall prouide, is a good anſwer, a fit anſwer, and the anſwer of father Abraham in this place to his ſonne. Lord giue vs faith, and thou neuer prouideſt more notably a Lambe to ſaue young Iſaac heere, then thou wilt alſo prouide neceſſaryes for vs to ſaue our liues, till the time appoynted of thee.
               
                  7 But now the matter can be no longer hidden: for they are come to the place, and the deed muſt be doone,

                  Abraham therefore buildeth an Altar there, and couched the wood, and bound Iſaac his Sonne, and layde him vpon the Altar vpon the wood. Though the Texte ſpeake nothing of any ſpeeche of Abraham to his ſonne, yet like it is, that ere hee bound him, hee ſhewed him Gods commaundement, where vnto his ſonne readilye ſubmitted himſelfe.
                     What Abraham ſaid when he bound Iſaac.
                   
                  Ioſephus taketh vpon him to tell vs more, and ſuppoſing ſo ſtrange a thing could neuer bee done without ſome dialogue betwixt the Father and the Sonne, hee ſayth it was in this ſort.
               Firſt the Father ſpake to his Childe and ſayde: O my ſonne, deare and beloued,
                     Ioſeph. Antiq. lib. 1 cap. 13.
                   with great care and diligence haue I hetherto brought thee vp, whome with a thouſand deſires I wiſhed before I had thee. Thinking nothing more happye a comfort for mee, then if I might liue to ſee thee a man, and leaue thee in my place, the poſſeſſor of all that I haue when I goe. But behould, it ſeemeth good to him nowe, that gaue thee to mee, to take thee from me againe, and that I ſhould looſe thee. Which ſince it is ſo: O my gratious Childe, indure this ſacrifice: for I yeeld to God for my owne parte, who ſeeketh this ſeruice of vs, for his continuall fauoure towardes vs, bothe in peace and warre. Thou art borne by nature to dye a death at ſometime, and now thy death muſt not be common, but of thyne owne Father, to the Father of all fleſhe thou muſt bee offred in Sacrifice. As it ſeemeth, his mercie deeming thee vnworthy to dye, eyther by ſickneſſe, or warre, or anye other calamitie. But taking thy ſoule from thee in the middeſt of prayers and holye ſeruice to his Maieſtie, hee will place thee

with himſelfe: where as one mindefull of the ende wherefore I haue brought thee vp, thou ſhalt vnderproppe mine age, and bee my comfort, not of thy ſelfe and by thy ſelfe, but thou ſhalt leaue vnto me God my defence and comforte in thy place. Then anſwered Iſaac the worthie Childe of ſo good a Father, and ſayde vnto him.
               O my Father, I am content vnworthy euer to haue been borne, if ſtriuing againſt the will both of God and thee my Father, I ſhould not willinglye indure that determined by you both, which if none but thy ſelfe would haue my deere father, I would not denye thee.
               Thus (ſayth Ioſephus) ſpake they each to others, and then all things being readye, vp went the knife to giue the blowe, had not God of his infinite goodneſſe ſtayed the hande. But O mercie memorable for euer and euer in the Lorde, who will not the parting of ſuch a father and ſuch a childe as yet, but ſtaying the matter, altereth the greefe into all ioye, and deliuering the father his childe againe, ſendeth them both home together with as cheerefull hearts as euer had anye cupple, no queſtion in this worlde after anye danger.

                   What two examples bee theſe for vs to marke? The father ſhowing vs what it is to bee vſed to the yoake from a mans youth as hee was, ſurelye it maketh harde thinges eaſie, and euen the verye greateſt things to bee better performed then euer they woulde, if ſuch exerciſes often had not beene. The Sonne teaching vs what grace is effected by ſuch gratious education as no doubte this Childe had. And bothe of them laying before our eyes, ſuch a patterne of obedyence to Almightie God, euen to the loſſe of lyfe, as neuer wee ſhould forget, but beſeeche God with daylye prayers, that wee may come as neere vnto, as anye caſe of ours towardes his Maieſtie, ſhall require euer.

                  IN that God forbiddeth nowe at this pinche, this ſacrifice of Iſaac to be made by his Father. Wee may well conſider howe

carefull the Lorde is, leaſt by anye example of anye commanded thing by him, others ſhould take occaſion to doe the like, without like warrant from him. Which happilye in this caſe would haue beene doone, if hee had not ſtayed Abrahams hand, but ſuffred the matter to bee accompliſhed and effected. Men would peraduenture haue raſhlye iudged ſuch ſacrifices to haue pleaſed the Lord greatly, and ſo haue often doone wickedly.

Secondly to ſhowe him what ſingular care and fauour God had ouer him, and towarde him, who ſo notablye would deliuer him by an open Angell from Heauen.

                     Rom. 10.9.
                   and telleth vs that aſwell With the mouth wee confeſſe vnto righteouſneſſe, as with the heart beleeue vnto Saluation, alſo our Sauiour himſelfe who requireth to the inwarde acknowledging of him in the heart, the outward profeſſion of him before men.

                   This is that

which S. Iames meaneth, when he ſayth, Abraham our Fathe was iuſtified by workes, when he offred Iſaac his ſonne vpon the Altar. Seeſt thou not ſayth he, that the faith wrought with his workes, and through the workes was the fayth made perfect,
                  
                     How ſaith dooth iuſtifie and how works
                   
                  &amp;c. That is, Abraham by this meanes was knowne and declared to be iuſtified, and his faith being effectuall and fruitefull by workes, was thereby knowne to be a true fayth, and not a dead faith. For S. Iames ſpeaketh not of the cauſes of iuſtification, but by what effects we may know, that a man is iuſtified. True is the diſtinction therefore euen of the Schoolemen themſelues. Chriſt dooth iuſtifie a man effectiue effectually, by working his iuſtification, faith doth iuſtifie a man apprehenſiue, apprehendinglye becauſe it taketh hould of Chriſt, who is our iuſtifier, and workes do iuſtifie alſo, but declaratiue, declaringly, becauſe they ſhowe that a man is iuſtified, as hath beene ſaid. So Chriſt, faith, and workes, doo all iuſtifie, but diuerſlye. True alſo is it that Bernard ſaith, workes are via regni, but not cauſa regnandi, the waye to the kingdome, but not the cauſe of reigning there.

                   ſaith hee, feareſt God. Then behould the fountaine of all obedience, the feare of God, and the witneſſe againe of the feare of God, true obedience, which being true, as it is moſt true, woe and bitterneſſe to the inhabitants of the earth, if the Lorde bee not mercifull for our obedience beeing turned into daylye, fearefull, and moſt careleſſe rebellion, where is our feare of his Maieſtie become? Surelye the Fountaine is dammed vp and ſtopped, and therefore no frute can flowe therfrom. Let euerye man priuatelye applye this, and ſaye with himſelfe, I thinke I feare GOD, but if GOD giue iudgement of my feare by my obedience, as hee did heere of Abraham, how will all prooue, &amp;c,

                   and yet hee was ſpared. But this is the nature of our good God, to accept in mercie our wyll for our worke, and a

ready indeuour euen for the deede it ſelfe, if hee would not ſuffer vs to goe any further: but this, when the word goeth before to guide the will and not elſe. For thoſe Baals prieſts beeing deſtitute of the word, though they lanced themſelues neuer ſo deepe, yet neyther in will nor worke pleaſed the Lord. And it is a good place alſo of Paule, not ſparing the body, &amp;c.

                   So then with this caue at let vs gather great incouragement to ſerue him, who will in reſpect of our ready minde acknowledge that we haue not ſpared this or that, when in deede yet it is ſpared though not by vs. Can we feare or doubt of reward if wee do it when ready will is thus regarded? Or doth that doctrine of God condemne good works, which thus aſſureth vs good will is reſpected? yet euer beware to exclude Gods mercy, and to put in place of it the works merit.
               
                  7 Conſider what I ſhall now note vnto you, and regard it with me from your hearts. Is Abrahams willingneſſe to offer his Sonne, a token of loue and great affection to the Lord? So ſayth the Lord heere, and ſo hee taketh it, euen as a worke that was done for his ſake, and which but for his ſake could not haue bin obtayned at Abrahams hands for eyther golde or ſiluer, by all the men in the world. O harts of ours then that they could feele. O eyes of ours that they could ſee. What affection was it in the Lord to vs, not to lay onely his owne and onely Sonne beloued and innocent vpon the altar of the Croſſe for vs, and to heaue vp the knife as ready to doo it, but in deede to doo it? O loue of loues, what loue was this, and what affection to vs was this? Abraham was commanded of our God who could commaund. Abraham ſhould haue ſinned if he had refuſed, ſo ſhould not God. Therefore if the one ſhew loue in Abraham a creature, what doth the other in God the creator? Well might it be ſayde with a vehemency, So God loued the world.
                  
                     Ihon. 3.
                   So I ſay and ſo as no toong is able to ſpeake of it, nor pen write, nor hart thinke. The Lord giue faith and thankefull feeling euermore.
               
                  8 Abraham thus ſtayed from ſacrificing his Sonne, yet fayled not of a ſacrifice in his roome, but lifting vp his eyes,

                     God will prouide for his ſeruice if we truly purpoſe it.
                   
                  him hee tooke and offred. Now remember wee what Abraham ſayde to hys ſonne before, that the Lorde ſhoulde prouide him a Lambe. Was it not ſo? Did not God prouide this ramme to ſupply yong Iſaac his place? No queſtion hee did, and no chance but Gods guiding hand brought him thither, and faſtned him there. What ſhould we learne then by it, but this, that if our hearts be ſet in deede to ſerue the Lorde in our place and calling, certaynly hee will neuer ſuffer vs to want the thing that ſhall be neceſſary and expedient for vs therevnto. A great comfort and a true.

                Two things in this Chapter eſpecially.

            IN mencioning ſo preciſely the age and death of Sara, we may note the ſingular accompt that the Lord made of her,
                  Verſe. 1.
                  
                and if we marke it well, wee ſhall ſee it a prerogatiue aboue all other women.

So would ye Lord by all meanes incourage vs to ſerue him.
            
               2 In that a woman who by nature is not ſtrong,
                  GOD ſtrong, though wee bee weake.
                in ſuch troubles and griefes many times as ſhe had, ſuch remoues and trauels through forren countreys ſhould liue ſo long, how noteth it the power of God greater then any weakenes, and how ſhould it comfort vs againſt any infirmitie of body whatſoeuer.

Againe it teacheth vs that there is both a better life and a worſe death then heere is in this world, otherwiſe what preheminēce had Gods children ouer the wicked, ſince they dye aſwell as they?

               in Kiriah-Arba in the land of Canaan. Thus did the Lord place and ſet downe in that countrey certayne pledges and pawnes, to aſſure the reſt that he would in time giue that land vnto them as he had promiſed, and they ſhould poſſeſſe it. So may wee now be aſſured of the kingdome of heauen, that forſomuch as many of our brethren and ſiſters are already there placed, and haue taken poſſeſſion before vs, ſurely wee alſo ſhall folow, and hee will giue that land, euen that heauenly Canaan and new Ieruſalem for euer and euer.

worſer: for the world was firſt golden, then ſiluer, then braſſe, now leather or lead, or worſe if any worſe thing you thinke good to name. Money is better and men worſe, the cheſt ſtored with better ſubſtance, and the ſoule filled with worſe ſinnes, yea euen with all ſinnes that ſo ſinfull a world can bring foorth and infect withall.

                     The obedience and care of his ſeruant in that behalfe.

Yea not onely to ſuſtayne vs, but with very great abundance to bleſſe vs, as heere he did Abraham. And therefore tye not God to yeares, nor his mercy euer to the meaſure of your wit.

                The bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich, and the bleſſing of the Lord is vpon the iuſt. Earthly wretches aſcribe all to their owne labours, pollicies, and fetches, but ſuch vnthankfull harts were there euer.

Euen then in this wandring time which the ould ſaying is doth not gather moſſe, yet God was able to bleſſe him, &amp; to make his ſtore increaſe. Surely in ſuch places it had bin great power in God to let him ſtill paſſe amongſt them with life, though hee had left him and let him be poore. But the Lord would euen this alſo: and therefore where, where, is not God able to doo for hys if they pleaſe him?

Conferre it with Gen. 28. Deut. 7. v. 3. 2. King. 8.18. where the like doctrine is taught.
            
               8 Paſſe not ouer againe in this talke of Abraham about the mariage of his ſonne without noting,
                  Parents authoritie in childrens mariages.
                what power the parent then had ouer the childe in guiding his choyſe, and not leauing him libertie directly without cauſe to ſtray from his liking, oppoſe it againſt the licentious rage of children in theſe dayes, whoſe wit and onely wit in this caſe muſt be folowed, ſay parents to the contrary by graue experience whatſoeuer they can. Yet ſtandeth it faſt euen in this matter as in all other, hee that deſpiſeth me, ſhall be deſpiſed of me, and hee that deſpiſeth parents, deſpiſeth God who hath ſayde, thou ſhalt honor thy father and thy mother &amp;c. Now ſhall children thinke that honor of word, cap, or knee, is due, and the greateſt matter of all others eyther to their owne good or parents comfort, belongeth no further to them then they liſt? It cannot be. Therefore who ſo in this matter taketh not parents good aduiſe and conſent, he deſpiſeth God, and the curſſe doth reſt vpon him without repentance.
            
               9 In the 5. verſe the ſeruant reaſoneth with his mayſter, and putteth a caſe. Conſider in it I pray you and learne,
                  Verſe. 5.
                  
                how it is not inough onely to beware of forbidden euill, when a man taketh an oth, but care alſo muſt be had leaſt in things commanded wee offend, not knowing the full drift and ſcope of the Commandement. And for this cauſe doth this ſeruant thus queſtion with hys mayſter.
            
               10 Beware ſayth he, that thou bring not my ſonne thither againe,

                meaning into his own countrey out of Canaan And why think you? ſurely leaſt he ſhould loſe the inheritance promiſed him there by God. Why was ye matter now in any likelyhod? truly no.
                  Abrahams great faith.
               
               
               Abraham was but a ſtranger in Canaan yet, neyther had any more poſſeſſion then the ſepulchre that he bought there for to bury his wife in. But by his faith which wauered not one iote in Gods promiſe, he poſſeſſed euen the whole land, and therefore he would not ſuffer his ſonne to be remoued thence to the woman, if the woman would not come to him. O that wee had ſuch faith to beleeue what is promiſed vs, and to expect it with aſſuring hope, then ſhould our hearts be free from many cares that now oppreſſe them, and we poſſeſſe to our good content what yet in mans eyes we haue no hould of.
            
               11 In the 7. verſe, Abraham maketh mention of the Lords calling of him out of his owne Countrey,
                  Verſe. 7.
                  
                into that where hee now was, and ſo ſtayeth himſelfe vpon that, that by no meanes he will doubt but God will go forward with his mercy begun in this and by this his calling. So, ſo, and euen ſo ſhould all wee bee in that calling whatſoeuer vnto good that God voutſafeth vs. As for example, if the Lord haue called vs into the land of light by hearing the word preached vnto vs,
                  Note well.
                or any other good meanes whatſoeuer, neyther ſhould the world, nor wants of men, neyther any thing in this life, make vs returne to the land of darkeneſſe againe. So of Magiſtracie, or Miniſterie, or ſuch lyke, the calling of God ſhould be our ſtrong ſtayes to goe through with it againſt all aſſalts to the contrary. But eſpecially this is a place, and an example for them that for any earthly preferment in mariage of their children, can be very well content that they ſhould bee caried from Canaan euen againe and againe to Meſopotamia, that is, from the grace and light of God which hee hath giuen, and from the place where he hath promiſed to giue an inheritance into the miſts and cloudes of ould ignorance againe, and all damnable ſuperſtition. Abraham heere abhorreth it though his ſonne ſhould loſe his wife thereby: and ſurely as he ſhould be our example to folow euer, ſo ſhall he be their condemnation that will not doo it.
            
               
                  The arguments of Abrahams faith.
               
               12 Marke againe in this verſe the arguments whereby Abraham ſtrengtheneth his faith. Firſt hee aledged the deede of

God in theſe words, qui eduxit me, which brought me out.
                Secondly his promiſe, qui loquutus eſt &amp; iurauit, which ſpake vnto me and ſware. And why doth hee not alledge his owne doings, and ſay, becauſe I obeyed hym, and left mine owne countrey for him, or becauſe agayne I offered to kill this ſonne of mine when he bad me, and to offer him vp in ſacrifice to him or ſome ſuch lyke? ſurely becauſe the children of God were neuer acquaynted with bragging of their owne works, and putting God in the noſe with their owne merits. Some do it, and alas will not ſee how they offende in it, but men and women poſſeſſed with Gods ſauing ſpirit, neuer did it, neither will doo it. Abraham knewe merits in hym were no ſuch props to his faith, as mercies in God, and therefore ſilent in the one with comfort he aledgeth and remembreth the other. So let vs doo if wee haue no calling but the common calling of Chriſtians. And if wee bee further eyther Magiſtrates, or Miniſters, or ſuch lyke, then conſider alſo how fitly wee may doo it. For as Abraham had the deede of God in bringing hym out, ſo haue Magiſtrates and Miniſters, in geuing them that place. And as Abraham had hys promiſe, and hys oth, verely ſo haue they, that hee wyll bee with them in the cauſe of iuſtice,
                  2. Chro. 19.6. Matth. 28.
                and in theyr miniſterie to the verye worldes ende. Bee it concluded then in our ſoules for euer, that the Angell of God ſhall be with vs, as heere Abraham ſpeaketh, ſo long as wee liue, to honor God by a faithfull ſeruice, and not our owne ſelues by ſome ſubtill ſeemings, for God ſeeth.
            
               13 I cannot but remember you of it alſo, how when the ſeruant putteth the caſe the woman would not come ſo farre, Abraham doth not bid him tell her what wealth ſhee ſhall haue, what riches and treaſure, and that his ſonne ſhould haue all, or ſo forth, but he anſwereth by his truſt and aſſurance that the Lord would moue her and bring it to paſſe if it were his liking, and therefore hee ſayth, the Lord ſhall ſend his Angell, &amp;c. Thus euer euer doth Religion perſwade one way, and earth, and fleſh, and the world, and other way.

                Often times doe we promiſe good vnto men in the name of the Lord, and wee hope it ſhall come to paſſe, yet wiſedome would that wee ſhould more fully teach &amp; ſay as heere Abraham doth. But if ſhe will not &amp;c. That is yet if God will not thus and thus do for cauſes knowne to his owne wiſedome and not vnto vs, then this and this ſhall be your eſtate, &amp;c.
            
               15 Onely bring not my Sonne back agayne ſayth hee, repeating againe what hee had once giuen in charge before, and we noted it. O conſtant hart, doth to abide himſelfe, and to keepe his poſteritie in a ſtrange countrey, being once called thither, although with wealth hee might returne, and with his owne kindred peraduenture liue more quietly. What a thing in a godly mans hart is a place apoynted hym of God. How is he not fickle and fugitiue onely for greater worldly good, without any direction from a better cauſe? Yea how muſt not a man like without God his liking, nor carue for himſelfe a portion of this worlde where himſelfe liketh, but where the Lorde will be content, remayning conſtant, and with the ſame contented, till the Lorde giue a going out. Abraham had his griefes heere no doubt, and probably may wee thinke the Cananites were not to hym as hys kindred, nor Canaan as hys owne Countrey. Yet ſo would the Lorde. And wee ſee before our eyes that the heart of Abraham anſwereth to the Lorde,
                  Pſal. 27.
                O my God, I am content to doo it, and his toong chargeth his ſeruant againe, bring not my Sonne back, &amp;c.

That is, after hee had inquired, queſtioned, talked, and was fully inſtructed concerning his mayſters will, and the ende of his othe, then hee ſware. A very good example to teach all men how an othe is to be taken. But alas, where is this conſcience, and care, and feeling, with feare to abuſe this dutie? Where is hee that ſearcheth and ſecketh to knowe the matter, and the depth of it, how farre it

may charge him what hee is requeſted to ſweare vnto. Yet thus doth Abrahams ſeruant heere, and let vs note it.

I beſeech you where were theſe golden, ſilken, pearled, and idle Dames that our dayes yeeld, when waterpots &amp; ſherpehooks were thought no hurters of womens hands by the very parents themſelues. I vrge it not for imitation, but for moderation.

                   wherby he deſireth of God he may haue notice, which the woman ſhalbe, that he ſhould chuſe for his maiſters ſonne. Graunt ſayth he that ſhe which ſaith drink, and I will giue thy Camels drinke alſo may be ſhe, &amp;c. I pray

you marke the marke that he wiſheth in his mayſters wife. Is it not a ſweete and curteous nature,
                     A marke for to chooſe a wife by.
                   rather then a gay gowne and a loftie looke? Is it not a lowly and louing minde rather then any wealth and pompe? Surely it is, for he wiſheth this, and leaueth out thoſe. And peraduenture touching the laſt, the ſeruant had hard it out of the mouth of long experience, that Diuite faemina nihil intollerabilius. There is nothing more intollerable then a rich woman. Except God gouerne, let me adde I pray you: for his grace maketh many ould ſayings to fayle of generalitie. Yet ſomething there was or is that ſuch prouerbs aroſe in times paſt, and are ſtill called to remembrance in our dayes vpon occaſions. Surely all bee not Saints that goe for Saints, before ſtrangers it may be feared.
               
                  6 That thou haſt ordayned. Marke this word well, and in it obſerue the iudgement that this ſeruant had of Mariage,
                     Verſe. 14.
                     
                   namely,
                     Mariage goeth not by hap.
                   that there was no hap nor chance in it, but that euery one is ſerued according to the ordinance of God, either for comfort or croſſe. Is it not all one with that which Salomon ſayth: Houſe and riches are the inheritance of the Fathers,
                  
                     Pro. 19.14.
                   
                  but a prudent wife commeth of the Lord? How doth this good iudgement then ſhew vnto vs the good order in Abrahams houſe for knowledge and inſtruction. He that walketh in the ſunne will be ſunneburned ſaith the prouerb, and ſurely where good inſtruction is in a houſe or towne, the people will ſauour of it. Would God our ſeruants might thus ſauour of the talke they heare at our tables or otherwiſe as this man did. But alas what know I? nay what know ye your ſelues of your ſelues? without doubt this, that if carping and gawling of others, if ſwearing, and filthy ſpeaking, if mocking and cenſuring of the way of truth, if Papiſme or Atheiſme be a color worthy carying, our ſeruāts may learne in our houſes and of vs to cary ſuch colors: but as for Religion and a ſound iudgement in the ſeuerall branches of Gods booke, alas, alas, it is not to be had with many of vs, nor amongſt vs.
               
                  
                     A good hart of a ſeruant to his mayſter.
                  
                  7 By the word mercy in the ſame verſe, appeareth the nature and hart of an honeſt and faithfull ſeruant, that he would not

onely haue things fall out to his mayſter, but in mercy to fall to him, that is all for the beſt, and his comfort if it may any way be more then other.
               
                  8 Now what ſucceſſe had this prayer of a true ſeruant with God? I pray you marke the 15. verſe.
                     Verſ. 15.
                     
                   
                  Eare hee had left ſpeaking ſayth it, behould Rebekah came out, &amp;c. See then the gratious goodnes of God, and how open his care is to one that is carefull of the credit committed vnto him, be he ſeruant or what elſe ſoeuer. Euen before he had left ſpeaking the Lord anſwereth this ſeruants deſire, and ſendeth by his hidden powrefull prouidence this mayde Rebekah to come to the Well to him. Now if wee conſider what hee went about, and what the Magiſtrates and Miniſters heere apoynted in earth amongſt vs goe about, is there any compariſon? Then with aſſurance may they go on in their places, that God will regard them and giue them his bleſſing, when he thus dealt with this ſeruant?
               
                  9 In that ſhe came foorth with a Pitcher to fetch water, the ſeruant hauing prayed as you ſawe before in the 14. verſe,

                   note the wonderfull prouidence of God, how it ruleth euery action, and ſuffreth nothing to go by chance as many dreame. For was there no time to fetch water but now, when the ſeruant laye by the Well wayting for Gods direction? Yes many tymes myght ſhee that daye haue ſtored her ſelfe,
                     God diſpoſeth times &amp; ſeaſons.
                   had not God directed euen to that time. And what God will muſt come to paſſe.

                   no gazing at paſſers by or ſtrangers, no prittle prattle, nor telling of newes, but modeſtie, ſilence, and ready diſpatch of that which is gone about. A good example for youth if it were carefully folowed.
               
                  11 But the ſeruant ſeeing her make ſuch ſpeede, runneth to meete her, and prayed her that he might drinke of her pitcher.
                  
                     17 &amp;c.
                     
                   
                  She ſayth vnto him drinke Sir.

of his buſineſſe, but hauing commended his ſuite vnto God, he beginneth to try the very firſt that came to ſee if his mark before mencioned might be found in her. In the mayd marke all gentleneſſe and curteſie of nature with ſpeech conuenient, neyther a foole to ſay no thing, nor yet ouerbould to talke at randon. When ſhe had giuen the ſeruant drinke, then ſee I pray you how no doubt by Gods very direction ſhe vſeth thoſe words that the ſeruant had prayed God before might bee a marke for hym to knowe the woman that God had apoynted for his mayſters ſonne by. I will (ſayth ſhee) drawe water alſo for thy Camells. By whiche the ſeruant knewe it was his Miſtreſſe that ſhould be, Gods gift and apoynted match for his Mayſter Iſaac. Then hee wondred to conſider Gods mercy and prouidence fitting things ſo quickly and graciouſly vpon his prayer,
                     The manifeſtation of God his prouidence is wonderful.
                   and bringing ſo forward the cauſe of his comming. And in deede the manifeſtation of Gods prouidence is wonderfull: for which of vs could once euer haue thought that ſuch things ſhould haue come to paſſe as now we know and ſee? Happy is that hart that is contented with Gods will, and prayſeth his name for well and woe.
               
                  
                     Verſe. 22.
                     
                  
                  12 Then the ſeruant tooke foorth a golden abilement &amp;c. Where we may ſee, how although hee was perſwaded that this was the woman whome God had apoynted for wife vnto his mayſter, yet doth hee vſe ordinary meanes, as gifts of golde, to procure her to conſent. Therefore wee ſee the children of God do neuer reaſon thus, if God haue apoynted the matter, it ſkilleth not what I doo, but they vſe the apoynted meanes, and leaue Gods counſells to himſelfe. Our Sauiour fled into Egipt from Herods tyranny,
                     Matth. 2.
                   and yet God had apoynted that hee ſhould not ſo dye.
                     Act. 27.
                   And in the Acts of the Apoſtles, they toke broken peeces of the Ship, and ſo got out, yet foretould that they ſhould not periſh, with many ſuch examples in the ſcripture. Agayne wee may note it heere,
                     Attyre in women.
                   that ſuch golden attiring as this and Iewells, are not ſimply condenmed in all women. But it is the manner, or meaſure or calling that maketh things not alowable. Confer this with Peter and Paule forbidding brodered heyre, &amp;c. as alſo with the third of Eſay, and interpret one by an other. Mayſter

                  Cranmer in hys booke of the Sacrament ſayth, thoſe places of Peter and Paule be denyalls but by compariſon, and not ſimply. But I neede not to ſpeake in this matter. We are too apt to take more then is alowed, when men are but carefull not to reſtrayne what is alowed. Both are extremities, and the middle way is the good vertue euer commended.
               
                  13 The ſeruant bowed himſelfe when hee ſaw how all fell out.
                     Verſe. 26.
                     
                   And we are to marke in it how Gods children ſhould not only pray in their wants, but alſo be thankefull in their wealth,
                     Thankefulnes to God.
                   for ſo doth this ſeruant. He begged Gods aſſiſtance, and now that he euidently ſeeth it, he voweth himſelfe, and bleſſeth the Lord for it. But God forgiue vs our vnkindneſſe in this behalfe: for if ten of vs be clenſed, nine of vs neuer returne to giue thanks.
               
                  14 In the 31. verſe, and ſo on,

                   it pleaſeth the Spirit of God to note Labans kindneſſe and good intertainment of this ſeruant,
                     A notable ſeruant. The lyke is read of Popilius a Roman, that he refuſed all intertainment of King Antiochus, vntill he hard of him that he would be ruled by the Senat, about which meſſage hee was ſent. Diſcretion in doing a meſſage.
                   when once he had heard of him by his ſiſter, and no doubt it is euer thus done, to commend vnto vs curteſy and gentleneſſe, and to bring vs in diſlike with curriſhneſſe and hardneſſe. But when meate was ſet before him, the ſeruant will not once taſte of it till he haue done his meſſage: more carefull a great deale of his mayſters buſineſſe then of his owne belly. Where are ſuch ſeruants in theſe dayes.
               
                  15 When you come to the ſeruants tale, I pray you note how hee leaueth out that which happely might haue offended them, namely, how Abraham his mayſter gaue him in charge in no caſe to bring back his Sonne amongſt his kindred agayne. It ſheweth ſuch a wiſedome and diſcretion in a good ſeruant when hee doth his meſſage, as is euer to be followed of all that reade it. And it ſheweth alſo, that although no vntruth be to be auoutched, yet neyther is all truth euer and at all times to be declared.
               
                  16 Whē the ſeruāt had thus ſhewed how all things had hitherto fallen out euen by Gods mighty &amp; merciful directiō, yet leaueth he libertie to the parents &amp; friends if you marke it, to diſpoſe of their child &amp; ſiſter as they would.
                     Verſ. 49.
                     
                   So ſee we in thoſe days how the

godly abhored to wring mens children from them by indirect meanes, if the parents were vnwilling to beſtow them for.
               
                  17 In the anſwere of Laban and Bethuel vnto the ſeruant when he had ended his tale,
                     The vnderſtanding and affection of the godly when a thing is ſayd to them.
                   marke the nature or: manner of the godly, both for vnderſtanding and affection: Touching the firſt, you ſee they taſt a good tale when it is tould them, and diſcerne God in his works. And touching the ſecond, they ſeeing the matter was of God, gaue anſwere thus: Wee can ſay vnto thee neyther euill nor good, behould Rebekah is before thee, take her and go. Both theſe are very ſpeciall graces, where God doth graunt them, but rare graces wee muſt needes confeſſe in our dayes in compariſon of the greater number. For how many ſauour nothing whatſoeuer you ſay out of Gods booke vnto them, but are in this matter euen voyde of all capacitie, though in worldly cauſes quick inough.
                     Note.
                   Then for affection how many wilfully ſtriue in minde againſt that thing that yet in conſcience they are conuinced to be the will of God. So that where is the man or woman almoſt we may ſay among many, that hearing Gods will tould them, and made rather more manifeſt then this was heere by the ſeruant, is ſtricken, moued and touched with it inwardly, yeeldeth vnto it; and ſayth: Sir, I can neyther ſay good nor euill vnto you, this thing is of the Lorde that you tell mee, I ſee his will, and farre be it from me to reſiſt him, no my hart is ready, and I am content to doo it? &amp;c. Yet thus doo Gods children as heere you ſee. Let vs folow it then and folow it euer when a good tale is tould vs.
               
                  18 Then the ſeruant bowed againe toward the earth vnto the Lord, wherein ſtill marke the conſtant pietie of the ſeruant, who ſtill, ſtill is thankfull and boweth to God. Agayne in the verſes folowing note the cuſtome of thoſe dayes, to giue gifts to the Bride and to her friends.

                   See alſo how it is lawfull to be honeſtly merry when once our buſines is done, and charge diſcharged: for now the ſeruant eateth &amp; drinketh which he would not do before &amp;c.

That is, we conſent and yeelde, and we are all in a heate and haſte, to promiſe all obedience to that which wee heare, and a man would thinke wee were wonne for euer. But after a while what do we? Truely euen as you ſee theſe friends, in the morning, we are well cooled, or rather euill cooled, our heate and haſte is paſt, and nowe the mayde muſt tarrie ten dayes, that is, nowe wee will delaye and deferre, what before wee promiſed and purpoſed with all ſpeede. So the longer the worſe, when it ſhould bee euer the better, if wee were not euill.
               
                  20 But the ſeruant ſayth againe, Hinder me not ſeeing the Lorde hath proſpered my iourney, &amp;c. Many ſeruants if they had beene in his place, would haue taried and feaſted, and taken good cheere, and excuſed the matter well enough, that the maids friends were loth to parte with her. But ſo would not this moſt carefull and truſtie ſeruant do: but hauing ſped well, he longeth to be with his maiſter to eaſe his minde alſo, which is a ſpeciall good care in a good meſſenger: for aegrè tristia, ſed cito laeta ſunt nuntianda. Slowlye is euill, but with all good ſpeede, glad things are to be tould, ſaith the olde ſaying. Againe becauſe God had proſpered him he would be gone, making Gods mercie a ſpurre to his faithfulneſſe and diligence, and not a ſtower of him, as no doubt many would.
               
                  21 Then they called the maide, and aſked her conſent therein, leauing this for the godly euer, and all to marke,

                   that as children owe a dutie to parents, to aſke their conſents,
                     Children ought not to be forced to mary.
                   ſo euen parents alſo owe this to their children not violently to force them againſt theyr liking: for who ſo marrieth, marrieth for himſelfe, and not for his parents, and good reaſon then the heart ſhould

loue, whom the life muſt indure till dying daye. Now loue is not forced, neither euer can bee, but God giueth it reciprocally, if the match be his. No loue, no match of Gods making, let parents thinke, and it is his prerogatiue to ioyne together man and wife. If man will ioyne by force and violence, whom God hath not ioyned by conſent and loue, what a bouldneſſe is that in him that dooth it, and how, will God not indure it, but turne it to his woe. Yet children againe may not bee ouerbould becauſe of this, but like if they poſſiblye can, where their parents better experienced then they are, iuſtly like. For if they do not thus, giuing all poſſible place to their parents iudgements, ſurely they doe not honor father and mother as they ſhould.

It ſhoweth vs the cuſtome of thoſe godlye Fathers of whome he learned it, nowe and then to goe foorth, and all priuately alone, to ſend vp to God the aboundance of theyr hearts, fraught with his feare, to meditate of his mercie continually taſted, to pray againſt faults continuallye committed, and after many holye debatings of his fauours in them, to turne home againe comforted and euen refreſhed, that with theyr GOD ſo good and ſo kinde, they haue had ſome conference, as became his Children. O wee, wee, ſinnefull and wretched, howe manye are our walkes for vayne pleaſure, and howe fewe or none in thys holye order.
               
                  26 As Iſaac was thus walking in the Fields, hee lift vp his eyes, and ſawe the Camels comming,

Both her lighting and vayle, tokens of her modeſtye and humilitie. The marginall note is ſufficient for this, if you ioyne vnto it the 1. of Sam. 25.23. where Abigael meeting Dauid, haſted and lighted alſo.
               
                  27 The ſeruant declareth all Gods dealing in this matter, and no doubt it both contented &amp; mooued Iſaac: whervpon he brought her into his mothers tent, he married her,
                  
                     If God take away one comfort, he giueth an other.
                   well liking of Gods choyſe, hee loued her, a token of Gods matche, and hee was comforted with her after his mothers death, to teache vs for euer this good, that if GOD take one thing, hee will giue

an other, to the perpetuall praiſe of his infinite mercie, and the great incouragement of his children to continue in his feare. What a ſort of inſtructions nowe hath this Chapter yeelded vs, and yet neither in this nor in any, is that halfe noted that might be noted. So plentifull is the ſpring of this heauenly water, yea ſuch a ſea of knowledge &amp; comfort is Gods booke. This much is more then we thinke of euer: and thus much remembred by this occaſion, and practiſed better, ſhall yeeld vs ioy, when all worldly follies ſhall faile their followers. We haue heere but a time, and how ſhort or long who can tell: ſpend this well, and we liue for euer: ſpend this ill, and wee dye for euer. Life and death, differ verye much, mirth and miſerie, weale and woe, ioy and paine, I iudge, we iudge not to be like, but euer and neuer are pearcing dartes, if we haue any feeling in bliſſe to liue, or curſſe to remaine, obeying or diſobeying the Lords good will. The Lord make vs carefull, and ſo I end.

                A dutie that parents do owe theyr children and children againe to their parents,
                  To burie them, is a debt of all friends.
                huſband muſt doe this for his wife, and the wife likewiſe for her huſband it is the laſt curteſie and kindneſſe to be ſhowed, and it is not a matter of little regarde with the godly. They know there will be a meeting againe, and therefore they lay vp as it were the bodyes of theyr dead freends, as men laye vp theyr iewels, till ſuch day come. Iſaac and Iſmael were no great friends once, but yet no iarres hinder them, for this common duty to their Father. We are more crooked and wayward, many of vs if luſt do vrge vs in this pointe. Our diſpleaſures priuate hinder vs greatlye from common good, and our anger laſteth from age to age, to our great reproche.

For ſince God is not the God of Abraham alone, but of all that feare him: This comfort may you haue in your ſoules euer, that when you be gone, yet he remaineth and liueth for euer, to bleſſe and proſper, to defend and comfort your children after you, that are now your care.

O powrefull God, what cannot he do, and whome cannot hee exalt if it pleaſe him? Seruants and all ſuccorleſſe children looke at it.

               9 Rebecca was barren long, and had no Childe, both to her owne and huſbands greefe no doubt.
                  God taketh his owne time to giue children.
                But ſo it pleaſed God then, and ſo ſo now it pleaſeth him often alſo, to ſchoole his children, by withholding theyr wiſhed comforts from them a time. Iſaac had a promiſe, that he ſhould haue ſeede, and in his ſeede, the familye and lyne greatlye increaſed, yet God wyll haue him wayte for it, and tarry his good pleaſure in patience, which wee muſt marke. Iſaac prayeth for his wife and the Lorde is intreated to ſhowe vs what cupples ſhould do one for an other in this behalfe, and how well the Lord liketh it, when they do it.

                  The onely refuge of the godly.
                Noting thereby to vs, that there is no refuge to the godly euer in theyr diſtreſſes more then this, to get them to the Lorde, and to learne of him ſome comfort for their caſe. But how did ſhe aſke of the Lord? Surely there is no certayntie layde downe vnto vs, and therefore as wee cannot

bee reſolued with any certainty, ſo is the ſilence vſed an euidence that there is no neceſſitie: the matter is not to vs materiall. Auſten ſaith, whether ſhe went vnto the altar, that Abraham had built, or Melchiſedeck was yet aliue, or ſome ſuch man, or any other way that I cannot remember and thinke of, ſayth he, this is certaine, the Scripture is true, and ſhe aſked God. Others ſaye this was before Abraham dyed, and that ſhee aſked of him, and had her anſwer as foloweth:

                  Why Iacob borne later
                
               Iacob is borne the later, whom God could haue made firſt, if it had pleaſed him, but he would haue it knowne, that he was choſen meerely of grace, and not as more excellent, becauſe the elder. Hee held his brother by the heele: which heele ſignified his poſteritie, ouer whom the Iſraelites ruled, not by nature, but by God.

                Sometime with reaſon, and often without. Heere a reaſon is added of the Fathers loue, to wit, becauſe hee loued veniſon, which Eſau often killed for him. But of the mothers no reaſon is giuen, happily ſhee loued Iacob more, becauſe God had choſen him before Eſau. Whatſoeuer it was, certaine it is, ſhee loued him whome God loued. But ſomething was in Iacob that pleaſed hir we may probably thinke,
                  Rom. 5.
                for this is the difference of Gods loue and mans, that the reaſon of his, is euer in himſelfe, and not in the partie being a ſinfull man, but the reaſon of mans loue, is in the merit of the partie, leſſe or more euer.

humanitie would haue releeued his hunger, either gratis, or for leſſe then a birth-right, much more his brother. Howe then may Iacob be excuſed heere? The anſwer of good men is, that in an extraordinarie thing, we may not vſe an ordinarie meaſure, iudging of it, as of other things, that are ordinarie. The Lords purpoſe was to deriue the birth-right to Iacob: this occaſion and opportunitie falleth out, Iacob taketh it, and let vs leaue all to God, and make no doctrine eyther of rebuke to others, or imitation to our ſelues by extraordinarie facts.

A very bad ſpeech of an earthy minde, that meaſureth all by the belly, and thinketh nothing of vſe, that profiteth not that waye? and we cannot better conceiue of this ſpeeche, then by the like. Suppoſe a Chriſtian in diſtreſſe ſeeketh comfort ſomewaye of a Turke. He ſhall ſay, if thou wilt forgoe thy fayth and profeſſion, thy title and intereſt in Chriſt and religion, I wyll releeue thee. The Chriſtian ſhall thinke and ſay. My diſtreſſe is great, and what good dooth my faith and profeſſion now to me,
                  How world lye men thinke of ſpirituall graces.
                can my title and name now releeue me? can I liue by the name of Chriſtianitie? is eyther meat in my belly, or money in my purſſe by religion? No I may dye for hunger, and lye in priſon for wante, for all my Chriſtianitie, and therefore better is it for mee to take goulde and ſiluer, meate and drinke, pleaſure and comforts of this life, and be out of this want, then to cleaue and be wedded to my faith ſtill, away then with this that helpeth not▪ and welcome that that neuer fayles. Forgiue me the penny, and I ſhall want nothing. Were not this a prophane ſpeech of an vntaught minde and man? were not this a moſt horrible contempt of a moſt holy profeſſion? Then thinke of Eſau by this. What ſaith he, is this birth-right to me, now that I am like to dye for meate, as if he ſhould ſay, giue me for my belly, and let it go, that feedes me not, and ſo foorth. Nowe if this be vgly before our eyes, as I am ſure it is, then learne wee by it,
                  Godlines is gaine, and not contrary.
                neuer to meaſure ſpirituall things by worldly profit, to back and belly and purſſe, &amp;c, but thinke of ſpirituall things in theyr kinde, and know, that he that feareth God, ſhall wante no manner of thing that is good.

                which the godly doe not. The preheminence of the birthright was this, Habebant ius Sacerdotii &amp; regni in familia. They were Prieſts, and kings in the familie after the fathers death.
                  Gen. 49.3.8. &amp;c.
                They had a preheminence aboue the reſt, in the diuiſion of the fathers inheritance, Deutro. 21. They ſucceeded the father in all dignitie, principallitie and honour. They had authoritie ouer theyr yonger brethren, ſo that they roſe vp at theyr preſence, and miniſtred to them. Spectabat etiam vitam aeternam. It had alſo his reference and reſpect to eternall life. All which being great things, this prophane man made little accompt of, but ſould his title to them all for an eaſie price, according to a ſillye feeling of ſpirituall grace.

                that Iacob ſet before him, and contemned the birthright. See I pray you the remorſe in wicked men, when they haue offended. They eate and drinke, laugh and are merry, this is the care they take, and feeling that they haue. A fearefull dulneſſe if we thinke of it: not onely to do wickedly, but to be ſo farre from repentance afterward. Yet is this vſuall with many men, Dauids heart ſmote him when hee had offended, and it was Gods grace and ſpirit in him: ſo ſhall it be in vs. A ſtonie heart is a plague of God,

                  The tryals of Gods children are alike.
                that God tryed Abraham this mans Father before, euen with the ſame affliction in a ſtrange coūtrey, and now he tryeth his ſonne after him with the ſame. Thereby giuing vs occaſion to learne, that euen ſuch temptations as others before vs our Fathers and brethren haue taſted of, we alſo muſt expect and prepare our ſelues for. The cup of affliction, is not appropriated to ſome fewe, but made ready euen for the whole number

of Gods elect, as the Father of wiſedome ſhall iudge it ſit. Now if others alſo haue drunke with vs both before, and ſhall after, then falſe is that peeuiſh perſwaſion, that Sathan ſo faine would faſten in our mindes, that none but we taſte of this croſſe, or in this ſort and ſuch like. It is not ſo, but as heere, what Iſaac is tried with, his father alſo indured before, ſo what we abide, others in like ſorte haue abidden, and it is no more token of Gods diſpleaſure to vs, then to them, but his meſſenger in loue, to invre our faith both to them and vs. The Apoſtle Peter is very plaine, &amp; let not his wordes depart from before your eyes, day or night:

He admoniſheth Pharoh of a famine to come, by his ſeruant Ioſeph? and whye? But that ſo he might prouide for his ſeruant Iacob, a place to be fed in 2. Kings and 8, you haue an other notable example of this mercy. Let the Lord then worke his pleaſure with vs, ſure we are by theſe examples, he will not faile vs, but prouide for vs, as ſhall be beſt.

                for his goodnes ſake. But euen vnto thouſands of their ſeed that ſerue him, and keepe his commaundemenes will he be good. O parents marke it, and lay it to your hearts. You ſee the fruite of your comming to church, of your hearing the worde, receiuing the Sacraments, and of leading your life according to the waye preſcribed, it ſealeth vp the Lords fauour, not onely to your ſelues, but to your children after you, to a thouſand deſents.

Let vs cleaue to God then, and hee will cleaue to vs, let vs truſt in him, and he will neuer forſake vs.

So the Lorde bleſſed him among theſe ſtrangers, and is that arme ſhortned, that it cannot nowe bleſſe our labours in our ſeuerall callings and trades, if it pleaſe him? We knowe it is not, and therefore rather we want Iſaacks trauell,
                  It is not lawfull (ſaith the heathen Xenophon for any that ſowe not corne, to praye that they may haue good corne: this verye nature ſpake.
                who lay not on the one ſide, and looked to liue, but laboured truly, and ſowed his ſeed, or els we want his good heart toward God and religion, and therfore the Lord ſerueth vs thereafter. Iudge your ſelues, as you beſt can, and amend what you finde to be amiſſe: with ſowing, not with ſleeping Iſaac got his increaſe, and yet not with ſowing neither without Gods bleſſing, but the Lord bleſſed him ſaith ye text ver. 13.
                and ſo makes him the author of this fruitfulnes in ye land, as euer he is. His mightie increaſe alſo otherwiſe, the text doth ſhew you, and marke it well, what God can do.
            
               9 So he increaſed in very deed, that the Philiſtins had Enuie at him. Thereby we finding the ſaying true,

                that pouertie breeds pittie, and plentie, ſpite: yea thereby wee ſeeing the guiſe of this world moſt playne before vs, that if a man want he is contemned, and if God bleſſe him hee is enuied, for enuie is a greefe at an others well doing. And there is no poyſon like this poyſon, for all others hurt ſome others, &amp; not themſelues, but enuie rather waſteth and weareth our owne ſelues, then hurteth others. Actius Sincerus ſayd well of it, when being in company where queſtion was made, what was good for the eyes to quicken the ſight, and ſome ſayd Fennell, ſome Saladine, ſome glaſſe, &amp;c. He ſayd Enuie was better then all thoſe. Noting thereby, that enuie and ſpite, is euer buſie, to ſpie quickly, rather with moſt then leaſt: what remedy but patience, and patience againſt ſpite, ſhall euer haue victorie at the laſt. Xenophon ſayde to one that ſpake ſpitefully of him, Tu didiciſti maledicere, &amp; ego conſcientia teſte maledicta contemnere. Thou ſaith he, haſt learned to ſpeake euill, and I in the teſtimonie of my cleare conſcience, to contemne thy ſpite. So ſay we, and ſo do we, and the game will be ours in the end.

ſed gratias agendo. Patience ouercommeth all things, not with ſtrugling againe, but with ſuffring, not with murmuring, but with giuing of thanks. Socrates was merry, when he anſwered one that aſked him, why he put vp an iniury, and cauld not the partie into law: What? if mine Aſſe take vp his heele and hit mee, muſt I goe to the law with him by and by. Noting what patience is rather to be vſed of wiſemen.

Thirdly, it is very worthie noting, that albeit this matching of Eſau in that Countrey with mens daughters, as we may probably thinke, not meane, might haue beene ſome wordlye ſtrength to Iſaac, who was there a ſtranger, yet being not in the Lorde, hee deteſteth ſuch meanes, and wiſheth in his heart no ſuch affinitie, but in faith relyeth vpon the ſure God.

                Wherein we may note both a generall prouidence of God, and a particular. A general, that commonly men in age &amp; time ſhould by courſe of nature waxe darke of ſight, that thereby they drawing towards an other world, might be weined from earthly matters, and be occaſioned more to meditate, by want of bodily ſight vpon things that are not ſeene.

Therefore if euer I ſhould vſe my friend, I would ſurely vſe him, and craue his due conſideration to ioyne with me, when I finde my affections hote vpon any thing to effect it or haue it: for euen then ſoneſt as I ſay by the vehemency of deſire may my iudgement fayle me, whereas my friend being ſwayed no way with any affection, looketh more throughly into the matter, and with a cleerer eye then I can, ſo finding and ſeeing ſuch perill and danger, ſuch euill and inconuenience, as I for my

heate carying me vneuenly could not ſee. So doth Iacob in this place obiect what in deede in mans gueſſe might very well haue fallen out, and of like by his mother was not either at all or earneſtly thought vpon.

My father ſayth he may poſsibly feele me, and I ſhall ſeeme to him to be a mocker, and one that would deceyue hym, ſo ſhall I bring a curſe vpon me, and not a bleſsing. Looke at this yee children that mary againſt parents minds, and doo many things elſe to their great griefe.

                We may marke in it how nothing is able to goe contrary to Gods will and determination. We ſhall feele and not knowe, we ſhall heare, and yet be deceyued, yea, when euen our owne mouths ſhall confeſſe it to be Iacobs voyce,
                  Verſe. 22.
                  
                yet with an outward counterfet ſhew of Eſau his roughneſſe, we ſhall be caried away if the Lord haue ſo decreed it. Therefore let them that are to perſwade others be content, if all beleeue not, and let them that beleeue not in ſo cleere light, feare leaſt God haue decreed woe to them and haſten, if yet they wil be warned, from ſuch hardneſſe.
                  1. Sam. 2.25
                The ſonnes of Eli are a fearefull example if they will conſider it.
            
               11 Let vs conſider heere who is bleſſed,
                  Childrens vſage if they wil be bleſſed.
                ſurely a ſonne that feedeth his father. And when doth the father bleſſe him? ſurely when his hart is euen light and cheerefull in him. All which teacheth vs both how children ought to ſeeke to win the bleſſing of their parents, namely, by well vſing them. And alſo that then is a man moſt fit to powre out comfort or bleſſing to others,
                  A cheerefull ſpirit moſt apt to bleſſe others.
                when his heart is not troubled, but cheerefull, and ſmelleth euen a ſweet ſauour in them whome he ſhould bleſſe and ſpeake vnto, for hard it is to ſing one of the ſongs of Sion in heauynes, but the woe of minde and ſmart of griefe within letteth greatly the ſweete ſtreame of comfort that ſhould flowe to others.
                  Pſal. 137.
               
            
            
               12 Mark how he ſayth that the ſmell of his ſon is like a feeld

                  The Bleſſing. Goods ill gotten.
                From which gratulation all they are barred, that get their poſſeſſions, lands, and reuenewes, by vngodly meanes, as by ſtealth, bribery, oppreſſion, and wrong, for ſuch are like a feeld which the Deuill hath corrupted and ſowen ſinne in, to their certayne fall when time ſhall come, yet may their garments happely ſmell a great way off by the art of man, but neyther themſelues nor their riches by bleſſing of God.
            
               13 Agayne conſider well in this bleſſing what wealth and what riches the father wiſheth to his forme,
                  What wealth hee wiſheth.
                and you ſhall ſee it is no pompe, no port, no vanitie of apparell, nor ſuch things as the world now doteth vpon, but he wiſheth him of the fatneſſe of the earth, and huſbandmans frute for huſbandmans paynes. Which though it tye not euery man to till with his owne hands, yet teacheth it that our godly fathers in thoſe better dayes of theirs, thought it a ſpeciall honor for their children to liue by Gods bleſſings vpon the earth, and not by other idle courſe and ſiniſter practiſes. Marke the bleſſing well, and you ſhall ſee more.
            
               
                  By earthly things other meant
               
               14 In that Iſaac nameth nothing but earthly things, be not deceyued as ſome haue bin, to thinke that eyther himſelfe reſted in ſuch things, or that he wiſhed no better to his childe, for it is not ſo. But by and vnder theſe earthly bleſſings hee compriſed and chiefely prayed for all heauenly and ſpirituall graces promiſed of God, and beleeued of Iſaac to Abraham and his ſeed in Chriſt and by Chriſt. This manner of ſpeech therefore is no other then vſually the Prophets haue by things outward and ſubiect to ſenſe and the weakeſt capacitie, to vnderſtand and meane things ſpirituall, not ſeene, but ſubiect to faith aboue many times our ſlender capacitie. So Eſay 11. and many other places.
            
               
                  An allegorie.
               
               15 The allegorie in this place that Ambroſe maketh, is not amiſſe. To wit, that as Iacob the yonger is heere bleſſed in the name of the elder, and the clothes that he hath borowed of his elder brother, giue a ſweete ſauour in the noſtrills of the Father: ſo are we in the name of Chriſt our elder brother, with whoſe garment of pure righteouſneſſe being clothed, wee ſmell ſweete alſo

to our heauenly Father, and are accepted. This againſt indirect righteouſneſſe, and for righteouſneſſe of imputation.
            
               16 That which he ſayth in the 29. verſe,
                  Verſ. 29.
                  
                
               let people be thy ſeruants, and nations bow downe vnto thee, &amp;c. may bee a good proofe that Iſaac ſtayed not in theſe earthly things which he nameth, but loked at higher matters. For how could he conceyue any hope of ſuch dignitie as th
                  •
               s, ſauing that hee was aſſured his poſteritie was choſen of the Lorde, and euen for the kingdome that after folowed, that it ſhould be in his ſtock and line, and belong to them? Therefore ſayth the Apoſtle▪ that Iſaac bleſſed Iacob by faith, and Eſau concerning things to come,
               
                  Heb. 11.20.
                as did alſo Iacob in the ende of this booke when he was a dying. This honor then that heere hee ſpeaketh of, ſhot at that which was fulfilled afterward in Dauid and Salomon, but chiefely in Chriſt, vnto whome all people are ſeruants, and all Nations bow,
                  Philip. 2.
                
               euen the knees of all things in heauen and earth, and vnder the earth,
               
                  Pſalm. 2.
                
               and to whome God hath giuen the heathen for an inheritance, and the ends of the earth for a poſſeſsion, as ſayth the Prophet. Yet true alſo euen of the godly is this which is ſaid, he that curſeth thee ſhall be curſed, and bleſſed be hee that bleſſeth thee:
               
                  Pſalm. 15.
                
               for euen in his holy tabernacle ſhall a place be giuen to them that make much of ſuch as feare the Lord. And whoſoeuer offendeth one of theſe little ones that beleeue in me,
               
                  Math. 18.6.
                
               it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his neck, and that hee were drowned in the bottome of the ſea. But chiefely I ſay it is true in Chriſt who deſcended of Iſaac that heere ſpeaketh thus, which Chriſt, whoſoeuer curſeth by abuſing his perſon, or contemning his truth &amp;c. that man ſhall be curſed, and whoſoeuer bleſſeth him, by imbracing him, and beleeuing on him &amp;c. that man ſhall be bleſſed.
            
               17 Iacob was ſcarce gone out when Eſau came.
               
                  Verſe. 30.
                  
                Marke I pray you the powrefull prouidence of almightie God,
                  Narrow eſcapes.
                how it ruleth and gouerneth times and ſeaſons, dayes and houres, and moments of time, to the ſafetie and benefite of his choſen. For doth Eſau come before Iacob is gone? No, firſt Iacob is out of

his walke, and then he commeth. Yet ſee agayne the narrow eſcape, and let vs learne by it not euer to looke for eaſy and great paſſage from perill, but be content if hardly and narrowly God deliuer vs, ſcarſe he was gone, yet gone.
            
               
                  Teares too late.
               
               18 After long debating of the wrong, at laſt Eſau breaketh into teares, but preuayled not. Let it make vs wary and wiſe, leaſt prophaning the dignitie of our holy calling to Chriſt, and vilely eſteeming ſpirituall graces, ſelling them as this man did for ſome baſe price, and preferring profit or pleaſure before them▪ we at laſt bewayle the ſame as now he doth, but all too late. Let the Apoſtles exhortation ſound euer in our eares: Let there bee no fornicator,
               
                  Heb. 12.16.
                
               or prophane perſon as Eſau was, which for one portion of meate ſould his birthright. For ye know, how that afterward alſo, whē he would haue inherited the bleſsing, he was refuſed, finding no place to repentāce, though he ſought it with teares. Surely ſuch men &amp; womē as hauing bin once zealous &amp; great louers of the word,
                  Note.
                of preachers &amp; profeſſors of the ſame, with very forward affection in all good cauſes, and after to pleaſe ſome mens humors, to purchaſe to themſelues this or that profit, or that they may inioy ſome ſinfull pleaſure, either forgoe all agayne quite, or in great meaſure. Let them take heed they be not either in, or very neere the prophannes of this Eſau. For what do they elſe then contemne ſpirituall things to obtayne earthly, ſell their birthright, that is their title to Gods kingdome had by walking in his feare, for ſuch ſinfull reward as they gayne by their change. God awake all cooled harts, and giue them heate agayne, that ſo are ſlipped and thinke not of it. Remember Eſau, and beware Eſau.

                  2. Reg. 8.20

                is a certayne viciſſitudo rerum, an interchange of things. For hardly hath bin ſcene or rather neuer, that any man, any ſtocke, or any countrey, ſhould be euer aloft, or euer below and vnder.

But the Lord changeth giuing the yoke, and breaking it away agayne according to his good pleaſure.
            
               20 Agayne heere in Eſau wee may note ſome properties of a bad man voyde and deſtitute of any true grace,
                  Notes of wicked man.
                and learne by them both to examine our ſelues, and to auoyde them if wee finde them. Firſt, hee hated his brother for this thing, and hee that hateth his brother, is a manſleyer ſayth the Scripture. Secondly, hee thinketh in his minde a ſecret venome of a poyſoned heart, his tong hee ſtayes, ſed loquitur in corde, hee ſayth within him ſome euill. Like as the Prophet ſayth, they imagine miſchife in their hearts, meaning the wicked. Laſtly,
                  Pſal. 140.2.
                hee appoynteth a time when hys Father ſhall bee dead, beeing content to make fayre weather, and to carry murder and ſuche murder as of hys owne brother tyll that daye. Thys is an hypocrites faſhion euer to forbeare euill for feare of men.
            
               21 But his mother heard of it.
               
                  The Lord diſcouereth treacheries againſt his.
                He happely afterwardes bolting out ſome ſuſpicion. This is the Lord ſtill and ſtill, and euermore, in the behalfe of hys, nothing ſo ſecret to their harme, which ſome way or other commeth not out. Thus hath thy power O Lord appeared mightely, and by name in this Kingdome, and the protection of thy faithfull ſeruant our deere and gracious Souerayne Queene Elizabeth. O Lorde how haſt thou opened the darkneſſe of ſinne conceyued agaynſt her royall perſon, agaynſt thys lande, and the life of all that feare thy name.
                  Engliſh treaſons.
                For wee were ſould, wee were ſould O Lord by many bloudy mindes, ſhee thy ſacred ſeruant firſt as our head and ſtay vnder thy Maieſtie, and then wee her poore people, liuing and breathing vnder her ſhadowe, not to be for ſeruants and handmaydes, as complayned that Queene Eſther to Aſſuerus, for then they had not bin ſo cruell, but to be deſtroyed after many miſerable &amp; monſtrous torments, with bloudy ſword of murdering mindes, that ſhould haue licked vs vp, &amp; drunke our bloud til they had vomited againe for fulnes with the ſame. And from all this thine owne ſelfe hath ſaued vs and ſet vs free, giuing them their portions eyther by Sea or land, by one meanes or other, as they did deſerue.

Out thou broughteſt Eſau his conſpiracies at all times to this day, and ſaued thy true Iacob, whome thou haſt bleſſed amongſt vs, and ouer vs, to our vnſpeakable comfort ten thouſand wayes. Some or other heard of it, as Rebecca did heere, and were inſtruments of wiſedome, counſell, and ſeruice, to preuent it 
                  〈…〉
                Lord wee thanke thee, with the very ſoules of our foules wee thanke thee, crauing mercy, that wee cannot do it as we ſhould. O Lord continue thy mercy for thy mercy ſake, and let the ſoule of our Souerayne be ſtill deere vnto thee, write her deere Father in the palmes of thy hands, and regard her euer as the apple of thine eye. Continue thy Goſpell to this land, and the light of thy countenance ſtill in our dayes, bleſſed for euer and euer for what is paſt.
            
               22 Marke how Rebecca vſeth meanes to ſaue Iacobs life, and yet ſhe had Gods oracle that he ſhould be mightie,
                  Verſe. 43.
                  
                and rule ouer his brother,
                  The godly vſe means, and preſume not vpon God his apointment.
                ſo that if euer any might haue preſumed of Gods apoyntment, ſhe for one might: but yet ſhe doth not, but leauing that, vſeth ordinary meanes, and ſendeth him away. How ſenſeleſſe then is it that ſome talke of predeſtination, that if it be to be ſaued, they cannot be damned, and if to be damned they cannot be ſaued, and therefore no meanes to be vſed: fye fye of ſuch follies. Do as Rebecca heere doth, leaue God his apoyntment to himſelfe, and take the ordinary courſe to be ſaued, heare his word, beleeue his promiſes, and indeuour to walke in the wayes of hys will, then ſhall God performe his apoyntment to your comfort as he did to Iacob, the other is but tempting of God, and deceyuing your ſelues. Chriſt himſelfe flyeth into Egypt from Herod, and yet apoynted of God to liue his time, which no Herod could preuent, with many moe.
            Laſtly, note Rebeccas words to her huſband, I am weary of my life for the daughters of Heth,

               &amp;c. See in them, how going about to get Iacob leaue to depart the countrey,
                  Rebeccas godly diſcretion.
                ſhe telleth not her huſband the true cauſe, leaſt ſhe ſhould grieue his heart, but maketh an other excuſe, yet a iuſt one. Such wiſedome and good diſcretion is commendable eyther in man or woman. Thus ſhee

had her deſire, her huſbands minde not troubled, her ſonnes both ſaued, and her ſelfe in peace and quiet. It was the Lords goodnes thus to direct her: and that Lord in mercy make all theſe things profitable to vs. Amen.

                which otherwiſe were ſtirred vp againſt Iacob, when once hee ſeeth the will of God, what it is. He is now ſo farre from raging or rayling agaynſt Iacob, that quietly and fatherly hee calleth him vnto him, bleſſeth him, and giueth him his counſell to direct his match. This is a ſpeciall place for grieued parents to conſider of, or friends whatſoeuer, that wee bee not froward and wilfull when children or others haue offended. Anger muſt haue an ende,
                  Greeued parents or friends.
                and the ſight of Gods wyll muſt ouerrule vs. I haue heard of parents that neuer woulde relent, what circumſtances ſo euer were to moue them. Theyr griefe may be iuſt, but yet for all that Iſaac heere is a better example then they are, and let vs all thinke of it.

                and to ſtrengthen his heart, that the Lorde would be with him ſo long as hee ſerued him in all his matters, ſuch comfort were fathers bleſſings in thoſe dayes to children, which now very little or nothing are regarded.
            
               3 That he calleth him God all-ſufficient. See comfort and ſtay of all trauelers in ſtrange places,

                whoſe trauell lyeth vpon them eyther by any neceſſitie of their calling, or for the truth and their good conſcience ſake. Surely it is this, God is all ſufficient, euer able to protect and ſaue them whereſoeuer they come: ſo muſt Iacob thinke that goeth abrode and be comfortable, ſo will Iſaac thinke that parteth with him, and by the ſame ſtay his heart concerning the ſafetie of his ſonne. So let vs &amp;c.

               4 He forbiddeth him mariage with vnbeleeuers, and it ſtill doth remember vs how perfitly thoſe godly Patriarks hated ſuch vnequall matches eyther for lucre or pleaſure, as wee in theſe dayes make no conſcience of.

                and the bleſſed of the Lord, yet muſt he now goe walke, hee muſt abrode and ſhift for himſelfe, his countrey, and fathers houſe are not for him, a baniſhed man muſt he be. O Iacob wee ſee thy caſe, and conſider the lot very often of Gods deere ones, God make vs bleſſed as thou wert, for to be baniſhed is no newes.
            
               6 When Eſau ſaw ſaith the text &amp;c. Now then he ſeeth, when he had offended,
                  Eſau ſeeth too late his fault.
                but he ſhould haue ſeene before he offended. An ouerlate ſight is good neither in pietie nor pollicie: for though the prouerb ſayd it is neuer too late to do well, yet an other anſwereth, that had I wiſt commeth euer behinde. So heere &amp;c.

Where is our faith when we ſee this with patience to beare the time of our humbling &amp; triall, knowing this and many mo examples of Gods exaltation of his childrens worldly eſtate, when hee ſeeth his time. For who ſeeing Iacob now woulde haue thought hee ſhoulde haue bin as hee was after when hee came backe agayne: yet ſo hee was, and ſo able is God to any if it be his will. Only beleeue in thy aduerſitie, and deſpayre not.

The myſtery of this ladder may bee this. The ladder is Chriſt. The foote of it in earth noteth his humanitie, man of the ſubſtance of his mother borne in the world.

the hart of Iacob now thus caſt off, as it were to goe ſeeke abrode to get a liuing. By which wee may firſt note the neede of comfort in reſpect of weakeneſſe that the beſt men haue ſometime, for God did not thus cheere vp Iacob for no cauſe. Secondly, wee may note to our owne comfort the readyneſſe of God to offer before men aſke or ſee the depth of the griefe they would otherwiſe fall into. And thirdly, that though Angells aſcende vp and downe, yet it is God that keepeth and comforteth, and no creature doth, but what hee is the author of. A good place to lighten our vnderſtanding concerning their blindneſſe that make Angells their Gods to pray vnto, and to expect helpe from. No ſayth this place, it is I, it is I, that am with thee, and will keepe thee whitherſoeuer thou goeſt, and will bring thee agayne into this land: for I will not forſake thee, vntill I haue performed that that I haue promiſed thee. I, I ſay, I it is and not theſe Angells that yet aſcend and deſcend by mee to doo what ſeruice I apoynt, but they are not of themſelues to doo any thing, onely they obey my voyce, and are miniſtring Spirits to do what they are commanded. I am the fountayne and author of all. Leaue wee then this folly, nay great and grieuous impietie to our aduerſaries, that will not be perſwaded by any thing, and cleaue wee to God as the onely giuer of all good, knowing that Angells ſhall ſo farre miniſter vnto vs as he apoynteth, and no otherwiſe: for he is the Lord, and they are but ſeruants.
            
               11 But it is a maruelous ſweete ſpeech that I haue named, and heere you ſee in the 15. verſe,
                  To vs this alſo ſpoken
                and ſuch as might comfort Iacob in deed with a very full comfort. If the Lord would ſay ſo to me, I would feare nothing may ſome man thinke &amp;c. In deed and would it ſo cheere you if God ſhould ſay aſmuch to you? Looke then what the Prophet Hoſe ſayth,
                  Hoſe. 12.4.
                when hee ſpeaketh of this thing, and hereafter performe your promiſe, neuer feare, but truſt in God, for euen thus ſayth the Prophet hee ſpake vnto vs, vs I ſay all, and not only to him.
            
               12 And I will not forſake thee, till &amp;c. O Lord thus art thou in this,
                  Verſe. 15.
                  
                and thus art thou in all things that thou ſpeakeſt. Not for a time indureth thy fauour,
                  The Lords loue laſteth.
                but whome thou loueſt, to

the ende thou loueſt them,
                  Iohn. 13.1.
                and neuer wilt thou leaue that man or woman that truſteth in thee.
            
               13 Till I haue performed what I haue promiſed ſayth the Lord. And did he then forſake Iacob? no,
                  I ill for euer, not for a time.
                it is aſmuch this word till, as neuer. I will not forſake thee till, that is, neuer will I forſake thee. Often alſo is the word taken elſewhere for a perpetuitie, and doth not limit a time, as in the Goſpell, I will bee with you till the ende of the world, that is, euer, and not then to giue ouer when the world endeth, ſo Pſalme. 72.2. and in other places. Weake therefore is their coniecture, that thinke Ioſeph knew his wife after Chriſt was borne, becauſe it is ſayd he knewe her not till ſhe had brought foorth her firſt begotten ſonne. For the word till, there may ſignifie a perpetuitie aſwell as in theſe places that I haue named, and in others: and the meaning be, he knewe her not till then, that is, he neuer knew her. I will not ſayth God heere forſake thee till I haue performed, that is as I ſayd I will neuer do it.
            
               14 When Iacob ſayth, Surely the Lord is in this place.
               
                  Verſe. 16.
                  
                He meaneth not to include his infinite maieſtie in a finite place,
                  How God is in a place.
                for God is euery where, and may not locally bee included any where. But Iacob meant of the ſigne of his preſence which hee gaue there, which is vſually ſayd in the ſcripture to be his beeing heere or there. Reade the laſt of Eſay in ſtead of many mo. And I was not aware ſayth Iacob. Whereby wee may gather thys comfort, that if the Lord be ſo neere his faithfull when they are not aware, that is, before they ſeeke and looke intentiuely for him, how ſhall hee abſent himſelfe when they doo looke for him, yea ſhrike with their feruent prayers, grones,
                  A comfort.
                and cryes in his Maieſties cares, that he would come vnto them and comfort them? O he can neuer doo it, and therefore doubt not of him, but vrge him with this example if you liſt to Iacob, and be full of faith.
            
               15 Then Iacob aroſe,

                  Chriſt is the ſtone vpō whom we reſt.
                This ſtone by ſome is noted as a figure of Chriſt, for it was one of

the ſtores of the place, &amp; preferred by Iacob to this vſe: ſo Chriſt a man of the nature of men, but choſen amongſt them to an higher vſe and dignitie then any elſe. This ſtone was placed in Bethel, that is,
                  Eſay 28.
                in the houſe of God: and the Prophet ſayth of Chriſt, Ponam lapidem in Sion, I will put a ſtone in Sion, &amp;c.
                Thirdly, this ſtone had oyle powred vpon it,

Looſer therefore I ſay I feare are we to our woe one day in a greater matter, then theſe ſhepheards were in a leſſer.

See the affections of fleſh vnto fleſh I meane vnto our carnall kindred, how dull are we that we cannot thus hartely be moued with the ſight and preſence of brethren in faith. Conſider our coldneſſe, and as we know the band is better, ſo dayly let vs ſtriue to thinke better of it.

               yet ſhouldeſt thou ſerue me for nothing? wherby we may learne, that if a brother of a brother be to bee rewarded, and one kinſman of an other (for ſo meaneth Laban) if he take paines in truth and induſtrie for him: then may we not ſee ſtrangers, that are no waye bounde to vs in nature, as the other be, go without their wages,

Surely our Miniſters, that faithfully and truly teach vs, we may not defraud, our ſeruants we may not rob of theyr due, neither anye labourer that worketh with vs, for this were more iniuſtice then the other, and yet the other, ſuch as Laban maketh ſhewe to bee aſhamed of·

                and not vnlawfull, and at the ſeauen yeares end alſo, asketh her, and doth not take her by force. Compare it with the damnable libertie of our dayes, wherein gayning our purpoſe,
                  Verſe. 21.
                  
                is thought both obedience to God, and loue to our neighbour ſufficient, though wee would be loth our ſelues to haue ſuch meaſure, and both God and man abhorre vs for it. That the time ſeemed ſo ſhort, ſheweth the force of affection when it is ſet.

Here they were ſo ſtrong in Iacob, that Leah in compariſon of Rachell was deſpiſed: which the Lorde ſaw and miſliked, giuing vpon that a mercy to her, that he gaue not to Rachell, to be fruitefull and beare. Wherein we ſee againe, that children are the bleſſing of the Lord, and his free gift, neuer to bee had by any power but by his. Leah ioyeth in his mercy, and acknowledgeth that it proceeded from God, who looked vpon her tribulation, and therefore ſhee bleſſeth him,

Wee ſee it heere in Rachell, otherwiſe, a good woman no doubt of it, and let the foulenes of the ſpot in hir make vs wiſe and warie, to auoide it in our ſelues. It graced not her, it cannot grace vs, nay it diſgraced her, and it will all to blurre and blot vs. She wiſhed not to others as to hir ſelfe, no not to her owne ſiſter: no more doe we I feare me, ſhe prayſed not God aſwell for his mercy to others, as to her ſelfe, no more do wee I feare me, yet both ſhe and we bound to do it. Better then is the ſpirit, that not finding in it ſelfe what it wiſheth, ioyeth yet vnfainedly that others haue it.

                  Mandraks.
                To diſcourſe whereof, belongeth rather to Phiſitions,

then Diuines. It is an hearbe, whoſe roote hath a certayne likeneſſe of the figure of a man. There is male and female of it: that is, two ſorts, differing in greatneſſe both of roote, leafe, and fruite, which commonly men call after this ſort. The fruite of the female as is written, in quātitie like a Cheſnut or Wallnut. The Aple of the male, as great as an Egge: the roote forked as man is: the ſmell of it very paſſing pleaſant: for the force of it to worke loue, I leaue it to others to iuſtifie, that ſo write of it. For the efficacie of it, eyther of roote or apple, in helping barrennes in Women, which ſeemeth to be aſcribed to it by theſe ſiſters here, (they contending ſo about it) happily it is not generall. For the Hearbe being very could, cannot haue that effect in all bodyes, but rather the contrarie in ſome, namely in cold. But in hote countreys, as in Affrike, Spaine, Italy, Egipt, and ſuch like, where the bodies are commonly of extraordinary heate, this may be vſed to bring them to ſome good temperature, and conſequently, if God will, to more fruitefulneſſe, immoderate heate being an enemie to conception, aſwell as immoderate cold is. But as I ſaye, I leaue theſe things to Phiſitions. For Ruben that found them, I rather thinke hee brought them for the pleaſantneſſe of the ſmell, which is written to be very great, then for ſecret vertue that he knew to be in them,
                  Cantic. 7.
                to ſuch an end as we now ſpeake of. I will tell you what one writeth of his owne experience, and ſo leaue this. Leuinus Lemnius ſaith, he had hanged of the leaues and apples in his ſtuddie,
                  An experience of Mandraks.
                for the great pleaſure of the ſmell: and in time hee began to be ſo heauie headed, that hee could not holde open his eyes in his ſtuddie, but muſt needs ſleepe, and thus hee continued rather euery day worſe then other. At laſt, wondering what ſhould ayle him, and ſtriuing with him ſelfe, by caſting his eyes too and fro, vp and downe, hee threw them vpon the Mandrakes, and preſently ſuſpecting they were the cauſe, he remooued them away out of his ſtuddie. Vpon which he euery day amended, and his ſleepie pang was gone. So is it ſurely effectuall, to ſleepe by this experience.

Whereby we ſee how eyther an ould greefe breaketh out, or els howe indeed Iacob was to blame, to accompany the one ſo much for beautie, that hee greeued and neglected the other, who had borne him children.

                to his great praiſe, and the example of all ſeruants that deſire to bee compted good, Leah going out to meete him, may well be a paterne to all wiues of kindnes and loue to their huſbands, and in her was a fruite of a louing woman. It is ſome comfort to him that hath trauelled truely, to bee welcome home, though his fare bee but ſilly. And frowarde vnkindneſſe betwixt couples pearceth deepe. Leah is dead, but this kinde meeting of her huſband, when he commeth from his labour, with both good face and good heart, may liue and rule in vs, if God will.

The deſire that here appeareth of children, may bee the poore mans comfort, that hath his houſe full.

               8 When Rachell had conceiued, and borne alſo, Iacob then aſketh his wiues, that he may depart, and telleth his vncle Hee knoweth what ſeruice he hath done. Where we ſee, how a good conſcience maketh his maiſter iudge, yea a good conſcience feareth no iudge. The Apoſtle telleth them, they know after what ſorte he hath beene amongſt them,

hath beene had before of no ſuch nature. Why is not Iacob rewarded all this while for his ſeruice, being by Labans owne confeſſion ſo good? Surely the better nature, the ſooner abuſed by kinde ſpeeches drawne along, and nothing giuen, leaſt if he had any thing he ſhould depart. So the old ſaying was euer true, Bonus ſeruus perpetuus aſinus. If he be a good ſeruant, keep him ſtill vnder, and ſo ſhall you inioy him longed. So that be he good, or be he had,
                  Seruants not rewarded.
                the worldly and vnkinde maiſter will giue little or no rewarde. For if bad, then he deſerues nothing ſaith his Maiſter, if good, then faire wordes muſt feede him and his charge, nothing giuen, leaſt he depart. He muſt be drawne on to ſerue in expectation, that ſtill he may ſerue. But ſuch Labans are not ſo wiſe as they take themſelues. For they rob themſelues indeed by this courſe of many an honeſt heart, that both is with them, and would be with them, if ſuch wicked vnkindneſſe were not.

                In reſpect of Iacob, no. But for Laban, Iacob knew full well riche mens properties moſt commonly for wages and promiſes: namely to differre long, and performe hardly then alſo, therefore hee will take him while hee may haue him, leauing him no ſecond cogitations. But leauing vs an example of lawfull wiſedome, when we deale with wretched minded men, that more regarde profit then honeſtie.

                and his ſonne in lawe by mariage, he hath both his daughters, and their children are many, bone of his bone, yet is hee glad to haue Iacob on the hip for a bad bargaine as hee hoped, and thinking hereby to gaine Iacobs ſeruice for little or nothing, would God ſaith he, this bargaine might ſtand. Where he ſhould rather haue ſaide in all courſe of nature and ciuill honeſtie: Alas my ſonne, this will be no great gaine to thy maintenance, and to the maintenāce of thy wiues &amp; children, which be mine as thy ſelfe art alſo, to loue &amp; care for euer, therefore deuiſe ſome better way then this, for I would wiſhe thee farre more, &amp;c. But as true as olde is the ſaying: Quod facis ingrato perit. What ſeruice a man dooth to an vnkinde maiſter it periſheth.

               ly, ſubtilly, and cunningly, that worldly men deale with Gods children, the more breaketh out Gods mercy towards them, and theyr cleere truth, innocencie and honeſtie, to the praiſe of God, to the comfort of them, and to the confuſian of them that thought an euill thought of them. Care away then, when the wicked ſift vs &amp; ſearch vs, compaſſe vs round about, to ſpie into vs, what they may

rebuke, for they worke for vs, and not againſt vs. God is on our ſide ſtronger then they, and in deſpite of all their peeuiſh pollicies he will haue his loue and our truth appeare. O truth then in all our delights to be kept as a iewell, more worth then any treaſure.
            
               18 Iacob feedeth the reſt ſayth the text of Labans ſhepe, to wit,
                  A quiet minde.
                with a quiet minde▪ well contented, and nothing diſcouraged with his vncles too too ſuſpicious and vnkinde dealing, hee wayteth with patience and godly comfort of heart for the Lordes bleſſing vpon his true ſeruice, and nothing doubteth but that hee who inioyes the earth, and all that is in it, had inough for him and his, and would as his good pleaſure ſhould be miniſter it to him. Let all ſeruants conſider this faith and truth in Iacob, and follow it: and remember, that though they ſerue men, yet they ſerue alſo the Lord in thoſe men,
                  Epheſ. 6.7.
                which Lord, will deale like himſelfe euer.
            
               19 Then Iacob tooke rods of greene popular &amp;c. A fact that at firſt ſeemeth great falſehood,
                  Verſe. 37.
                  
                craft and ſubtiltie in Iacob, and very vnlawfull. But better conſidered, it is not ſo. For as touching the warrant of it, the next Chapter telleth vs plaine it was Gods apoyntment,
                  verſe 9.10.
                from whome no vniuſt thing can proceede. Farre therfore is it from being any couer to their craft that ſhall be without like author by their owne corruption practiſed of any. Now if any man go further and thinke ſuch a meanes may not well be aſcribed to God, vnleſſe wee will make the Lord vnrighteous and faultie, let that man conſider and ſee how hee not onely toucheth Iacob in credit who aſcribeth it ſo, nay the ſpirit of God who cannot lye, &amp; who directed the pen of Moſes to lay this downe, but further, he denyeth the Lord that equitie &amp; right which he ſee
                  •
               h &amp; confeſſeth &amp; granteth to man. For what if a iudge cōdemne one that hath wronged or robbed a man, to pay him four fould, is it iniuſtice in him? no, and why then if the Lord condemne Laban to anſwere Iacob a portion for the wrong hee hath done him, ſhall hee bee vniuſt? May not the Lord giue vnto his ſeruant his owne bleſſing without iniuſtice? Or is God ſo bound to Laban to bleſſe his flocks ſtill that he may not alter his hand without a fault? And what elſe doth God in this place, but ſuffer Laban
               
to inioy whatſoeuer hee had gotten by his bleſſing vpon Iacobs true ſeruice and for Iacobs ſake before, without taking thereof any thing away. Only hereafter he will not diſpoſe his bleſſing as he had done, but for Labans ill dealing, will tranſlate it from him to Iacob. Is this vnlawfull for the Lord that is bound to none, to vſe his libertie? God forbid: and this is all that God doth heere. If you ſay, O but the meanes ſeemeth cunning. I pray you conſider whether man be to apoynt Gods meanes or no, ſaying thus ſhalt thou effect thy will, &amp; not otherwiſe. If not, then both leaue Gods bleſſing for the cattell, and liking of the meanes free to his owne wiſedome, and take euer his will to be a rule moſt ſure of all right. Then is it a queſtion whether this was miraculous, or naturall, or mixt, partly miraculous, and partly by nature, and it is concluded that it was mixt, it being nothing preiudiciall to the power of God to vſe a meanes, although euer hee doth not, but ſometime with, &amp; ſometimes without. Without meanes the Lord wrought when he gaue Manna to the Iſraelites, when he deuided Iordan, when he made Aarons rod to bud, and ſuch like. So healed Chriſt many other by the power of his word, without any meanes. With meanes, when hee apoynted a plaſter of figgs to Ezekias, when Naaman waſhed in Iordan, when Chriſt vſed clay and ſpittle, &amp; ſuch like. Alſo in the meanes that God vſeth, it is to be noted, yt ſometimes they are in nature ſomewhat auayleable to ſuch an effect, ſometimes nothing at all, but rather contrary. Auaylable as oyle &amp; water to heale &amp;c. Nothing auaylable as clay &amp; ſpittle to giue ſight &amp;c. This fact of Iacobs in ſetting the rods in this ſort, was of ye firſt kinde namely in nature ſomewhat auaylable, for great is the power of imagination by conception eyther of reaſonable or brute beaſts which imagination is affected &amp; moued by ſights very much, &amp; 
                  〈◊〉
                was here by theſe party colored rods For theſe rods wrought not this effect becauſe they were looked vpon, but becauſe the inward ſenſes were affected by them, &amp; the imagination made as it were like them. Now if any will ſay, there were ſome ſeale in this, if imagination and generation belonged to one and the ſame facultie, or to one and the ſame part of the body, but none now as it is, imagination belonging to the mind,
                  Animae.
                and generation to nature, imagination alſo being in the brayne, and

generation in the members of body appointed there vnto much diſtant from the braine: that man muſt remember that yet they are the actions of one and the ſame creature, and being ſo, there is a ſimpathy and mutuall affecting of parts of the ſame body, though they be diuers and much diſtant in place one from an other. Experience you ſee in the partes of generation, which are affected, mooued and ſtirred with vncleane thoughts and conceipts in the minde, as is alſo the thought and minde by thoſe parts, if ſeede do abound in them to ſtirre vp luſt. And therefore ſtill no maruell but naturall and by courſe of reaſon, poſſible, that the minde affected with a ſight, and an impreſſion thereof entred into the imagination, ſhould alſo haue an operation and an effect in the wombe below to frame and forme the thing therein conceyued after that ſort. This was euer alowed of Philoſophers, Phiſitions, and all learned, and examples many related in authors of the ſame. Galen telleth an experience of a woman that had a moſt faire childe, neither her ſelf nor huſband being ſo. And how? only by an intentiue beholding a faire picture. Hyppocrates ſpeaketh either of the ſame or the like, and ſayth, the woman being accuſed and condemned in all iudgements as diſhoneſt and adulterous, ſhe was quit by him, who commanding a ſearch to be made what pictures ſhe had in her houſe, and one being found of a very faire yong man, Hyppocrates aſſured them of her honeſty, by a learned diſcourſe of the power of imagination in theſe things. Quintilian in his controuerſie wherin he defendeth the Matrone that brought forth a black More, vſeth this argumēt to clere her with. In Spayne it is well knowne, that by ſetting before the eyes of their Mares the faireſt horſe they can poſſibly get, they haue found it ſpecially profiting to their deſire.
                  Ciuit. 18.5.
                
               Auſten giueth this very reaſon wherefore in Egipt there is neuer wanting a white ſpotted Oxe, which they call Apis,
               
                  De Trinit. lib. 11.
                &amp; worſhip for a God. In an other place he much ſpeaketh of the great things that are wrought heereby, except ſome groſſe corpulence or hard matter hinder in the female. By all which you ſee it appeareth plainly, that together with ye working power of God, which in this was chiefe, &amp; euer is, yet euen in nature &amp; reaſon this laying of partycolored rods to affect ye imagination of the females at the time of their heate before their eyes, was

effectual, to bring to paſſe a like colored yong one to Iacobs gain, whoſe bargaine was to haue all ſuch, and onely ſuch.
            
               20 There is another queſtion in this place yet, and that is concerning the time when Iacob layde the rods in. And ſome haue ſaide he obſerued a time of the day, namely the morning, and not the euening, others a time of the yeare, as about September, that they might Lambe about Marche, and not at Marche, that they might bring forth about September. The latter is better., and more agreeable to the text: yet they that houlde the firſt, would ſeeme to relye much vpon the benefit of ſleepe, which hath gone before. As if by reaſon thereof, the morning ſhould be better both for a ſtronger conception, and alſo for a more quicke affectation of the power imaginatiue. What is true we may thinke of, if we will, and that is this: The moſt kinde of creatures (that bee for mans vſe) ſleepe in the night, and feede and labour in the daye, Therfore the morning generation is after ſleepe and before meat, the euening, after meate and before ſleepe. Wherefore in the morning the ſeede is better concocted, and the braine wherein the imagination is more quick, free, and cleere. For ſleepe eſpecially furthereth concoction, riddeth away the vapors of the braine, and giueth vigor and ſtrength, to ſenſe and motion. Therefore the ſeede by reaſon of better concoction, is more fruitefull, and the imaginatiue vertue by means of the late refection of the ſpirits by ſleep, and clearing of the braine, more forcible and effectuall. Contrariwiſe, at night the meate lying vnconcocted, the head is charged with thicke vapours from the ſtomack, and the imagination wearyed with long watching. And ſo conſequently, the ſeed neither ſo fruitefull and ſtrong, neither the imagination ſo effectually mooued and ſmitten as in the morning. But as I ſayd, it is better to referre Iacobs deed, to the ſtronger and better parts of the yeare, which he carefully obſeruing, to laye or not laye the roddes before the ſheepe, hee had both moe and more ſtrong, Laban fewer and weaker. And this I hope may ſuffice, both for this place and this Chapter.

               In this Chapter we may conſider generally.

                     The cauſes of Iacobs departure.

                     The manner of the ſame, together with Labans following.
                     The couenant betwixt Iacob and Laban.
                  
               
            
            
               PArticularly. Firſt, theſe wordes that Labans ſonnes ſpeake, Iacob hath taken away all that was our father, &amp;c. together with the countenance of Laban,
               
                  Verſe. 1.2.
                  
                that was not towards him as in time paſt, and let vs note theſe things in them and by them.
            Firſt and formoſt the nature of this worldly traſh and pelfe, how the loue of it ſeuereth and ſundreth neere and deere friends, maketh them diſlike greatly one of an other, and remoue dwelling ſo farre a ſunder,
                  Worldly goods part friends.
                that ſeldome or neuer they meete agayne. A moſt wofull effect of ſuch a cauſe, and a moſt horrible corruption in vs, that ſhould ouerrule ſuch earthly affections.
            Secondly, how nothing contenteth a couetous minde as long as he ſeeth an other man thriue by hym. He would haue all, and without he will neuer be pleaſed.
            Thirdly, how like to the father the children be, all of them mutterers and murmurers againſt Iacob, for the bleſſing that God voutſafed him.
            And laſtly, how hote youth bableth out that which cooler age couereth and keepeth in. Laban as bad in hart as they, but yet he keepeth his toong and diſſembleth, ſo cannot the yong men doo, their bloud is too warme, and wily craft hath not yet poſſeſſed them.

               2 That Labans countenance was changed toward Iacob as the text ſayth we ſee,
                  Face ſheweth what heart thinketh.
                
               Quam difficile eſt crimen non prodere vultu. How hard it is not to bewray in face what lodgeth in hart againſt

any. Vultus index animi. The countenance declareth the minde, and ſo heere.

               n Iacob of like be thinketh him of his Countrey,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                though not preſuming to attempt any returne without better warrant. And wee may thus profit by it, euen to conſider how good it is ſometimes to haue mens faces change, that we may thereby the rather looke vnto better things, as to the Lord, and the light of his countenance, to heauen our country, where no ſnubs be &amp;c. which happely we are too cold in, as long as mans fauor carieth vs along in ye liking of this world. Why doth Dauid ſay it was good for him that he had bin in trouble,
               
                  Pſalm. 119.
                but that he felt the change of man kindle in him a ſweeter thought of that God and his great mercy that cannot change, but yeſterday, and to day, and foreuer, is the ſame. Why ſayth he againe ſo earneſtly, but it is good for me to hould me faſt by God, by God I ſay, &amp; to put my truſt in him &amp;c. ſauing that mans tott
                  •
               ring loue, and too fickle frendſhip ſmote his hart with a deeper conſideration of the comfort therof aboue all earthly things whatſoeuer. No doubt againe but it was good for Ioſeph that Putiphar turned vpon him as he did without cauſe, for he ſaw therby what man is, and what God is, and how broken a reed he truſteth vnto that maketh fleſh his arme, and thinketh all ſhall be wel with him, becauſe ſuch and ſuch giue him countenance. Alas alas who hath not bin deceiued by mans fickle fauour, and thought all was ſure, when and whilſt he had that, and rather might many things fall out, then ſuch perſons change their loue without iuſt cauſe. But their experience at laſt hath bin euen as Iacobs was heere, that neither truth of ſeruice, and performance of p
                  •
               ynefull ſauour by day &amp; night, neither neerenes in bloud before mariage nor any increaſe of knot by mariage, neither any bleſſing of God giuen vnto paines, nor any thing whatſoeuer, could bold that loue that was neuer true, but for reſpects, or that man or woman that neuer made conſcience indeed of deſerts, to yeeld them due comfort according to their qualitie. But well well, let it be too late to call againe yeſterday, yet it is not too late to day to ſee the word of the Lorde before vs, and to marke this example of Iacob, how hee found a change in his owne vncle, without any iuſt cauſe,

and to beware our ſelues of being ouer farre caried hereafter with that which is ſo vncertaine in it ſelfe.
            
               
                  Verſe. 3.
                  
               
               4 And the Lord ſaid vnto Iacob, turne againe vnto thine owne countrey,
               
                  When man forſaketh, God releeueth.
                
               &amp;c. See the ſweete mercie of Almightie God to his true ſeruant. When man ſowreth, he laugheth vpon him, when man hateth, he loueth, and when man looketh away with a face quite altered, he looketh vpon and vnto his true Iacob, with the eyes of his olde mercy and louing kindneſſe, rather much increaſed, then any one iotte leſned and diminiſhed. O comfort, a true one, and a great one: for thus I feele it. When the potentates of this worlde liſt to waxe bigge againſt a poore childe of God, and to ſwell with diſlike againſt him, they alſo adde this vanitie, to that greeuous iniquitie, that they thinke he ſhall neuer be able to beare their diſpleaſure, but he is euen in their hands to be vſed as they will, and what will they? Surely they intend to begger him and all his, to cruſh him, and breake his backe, to grinde his face, and play Rex with him at their pleaſure. And other mad men are alſo of that minde, and begin to ſay, alas how ſhall he do, ſuch an one is offended with him, and his countenance is changed vpon him. Surely he is vndoone, and caſt away, with other like ſpeeches to that end. But let theſe Nimrods, that ſo will tyrannize ouer any poore Iacob, and ſuch faithleſſe fearefull men, as ſo bewayle the oppreſſed, looke vpon this example here, and conſider it well.
            Did Iacob periſhe, when Labans face changed, and all his children with him, hath Laban power to ſinke him and cruſh him, and doe what hee will? No, but when all theſe changes are in man, then God ſteppeth in and looketh vpon him that man will not ſee, ſpeaketh vnto him, directeth him from them ſo vnkinde regarders of a true heart towardes them, and wholy taketh him into his owne protection, to his owne care, that neyther they nor any for them ſhall hurt him, and Iacob ſhall liue in an other place vnder his bleſſing and mercye, better then euer hee did there amongſt them. O God then euer be thou our God, we beſeech thee deerely, and wee care not what changes man ſhall make vpon vs vniuſtly and vnkindly.
            
               
               5 Then Iacob ſent for his wiues into the feeld to hym,

               Rachel and Leah. Whereby we may note,
                  Husbands ſhould conferre with their wiues.
                how in matters concerning them, it is a good mans part to conferre with his wife, and not to do all vpon a brayne, in a kinde of prowde and vnkinde authoritie ouer the woman, who though ſhe be in ſubiection vnto her huſband by law of ſex and mariage, yet is ſhe his fellow and companion and helper alſo, euen by aduiſe and counſell many times. Sweet then is the conference of man and wife together about common cauſes concerning them both, and let it be liked in our eyes euer by this example of Iacob,
               
                  Reade before vpon Chap. 18. verſe 6.
                that intending a remoue from ſo vnfriendly a friend, ſendeth for his wiues to him, and talketh with them. His ſpeach hath in effect bin conſidered before by his parts, and we ſhall not neede to ſtand vpon the particulars agayne, only your ſelfe reade it and conſider it: marking in the 6. verſe, how a true ſeruant that hath conſcience in him ſerueth, namely, with all his might, this is oppoſite to that eye ſeruice which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, Epheſ. 6.
            
            
               6 Come we therefore to the anſwere of his wiues,
                  V. 14. &amp;c.
                who with one conſent ſayd vnto him,
                  Wiues ought to cleaue to their huſbands.
                
               Haue we any more portion and inheritance in our fathers houſe &amp;c. Do whatſoeuer God hath ſayd vnto thee. By which ready and full conſent, we ſee the dutie agayne of godly wiues, namely, when their huſbands do impart vnto them his purpoſe grounded vpon iuſt cauſes and ſufficient warrant, then not to hang back, to croſſe him and grieue him, and not to yeeld to him, but rather with theſe gratious women heere to ſay, what God hath put in thy minde that do. We are ready, and wee will obey. Thy lot ſhall be our lot, and the Lords good pleaſure all our lots. Agayne let it not be vnconſidered, how Iacob finding iuſt fault with their father, and vpon true cauſe complayning of him, the women yeeld vnto truth, and neither cleaue to their father againſt their huſband, nor forſake their huſband for to iuſtifie their father. Heere is no ſuch croſſing partialitie, but as God hath made them wiues to Iacob, ſo they cleaue vnto him kindly, and preferre him before all the world.
            
               7 By which willing conſent to forſake father and friendes,

country and all,
                  A type of the Church.
                and to cleaue vnto their huſband, may be happely reſembled the nature of the Church the ſpouſe of Chriſt, which is euer to forſake all and to follow him.

                a great fault in a good woman: but weakenes ſometimes is in the beſt, and it may not be iuſtified. This itch of ſuperſtition though good men indeuour, yet can they not euer vtterly extinguiſh in their deereſt, but in long time, if euer.
            
               9 Iacob thus gone and remoued away with all that he had, three dayes after Laban heareth of it,

What hee meant to doo we cannot tell, becauſe God hath not told vs, but of like he was fiery inough, and conceyued diſlike before, would now prick him forward mightely. But what do we ſee? truly that which with vnſpeakable comfort wee may well note and euer remember,
                  A ſweete comfort.
                to wit, how God cooleth him and tempereth him before he commeth vnto Iacob to ouertake him, charging him in a dreame for his life not only to do no euill, but not to ſay ſo much as an euill word to Iacob. Take heed ſayth God, take heed. Can a man conceyue of this care and mercy in God toward Iacob as it deſerueth? O how true ſayd the Prophet Dauid,

Comfort your hearts then beloued euer with this example, and feare not man: but feare, and loue, honor and ſerue to your dying day this God that can, this God that will, and now doth ſo bridle an enemy.

               10 In the 27. verſe, you ſee what Laban ſayth, if hee had knowne of Iacobs departure,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                
               hee would haue ſent him away

with mirth and with ſongs, with tymbrel &amp; with harp. Thus is his toong changed by the Lords warning, but God knewe his heart. There were many preſumptions by former facts how hee would haue liked his departure if hee had bin made acquainted with it, but it is beſt now to ſay the beſt, and gracious is that God that can pull ſuch words out of a man diſpleaſed, and force him to ſpeake nothing but faire where hee will haue it ſo. Let all ſnuffers and browbeaters of honeſt men conſider this, and ſee if they can doe what they liſt.

                  How the godly and wicked differ.
                Where wee may ſee a difference betwixt the godly and vngodly men. The firſt ſpeake and boaſt of iuſtice and equitie, ſaying, this or that is due to you by right, and to your offence, but the ſecond boaſt and braue it euer with their power and might, ſaying this and that I am able to doo, as Laban did heere, I truſt we are reſolued ſoone whether to follow.

                  The gods of idolaters.
                euen make and vſe, repute and take ſuch things as they worſhip beſides the true God, for their gods. And what ſkilleth it for the name, when there is proofe of the thing.
            
               13 In Iacobs anſwere, cary your eye to Labans obiections which were 3. Firſt, that being his ſeruant, he fled away ſecretly,
               
                  Verſe. 31.
                  
                ſecondly, that hee tooke away his daughters and their children,
               
                  Iacobs anſwere to three obiections
                being ſo neere to him in bloud without his priuitie, and thirdly and laſtly why he ſtole away his gods, vnto all which Iacob anſwereth, but diuerſly, for to the two firſt hee ſayth playnly it was becauſe he was afraid, and thought that Laban would haue takē his two daughters frō him: wherein we may note ye open ſimplicitie &amp; vprightnes of Iacob, in telling the truth euen as it was indeed, without ſuch colors &amp; cunning as mē vſe in theſe days. To the third he anſwereth by a ſtout denyall, referring him not only to ſearch all that euer hee had, but offring the party to death with whom any ſuch thing might be found. By which vnaduiſed ſpeech

he raſhly ouerſhot himſelfe,
                  Raſhnes in Iacob. Reade Gen. 44.9.
                and would haue bin as ſory as euer was Ieptha when his daughter met him, if Laban had taken him at his word, and found the gods with Rachell, Iacobs deereſt wife. Wee learne therefore by it, that haſty ſpeach may worke much woe, and therefore be we not ouer raſh. We knowe none ſo well as our ſelues, and therefore good to be ſo bould to promiſe innocency for none but our ſelues for feare of reprofe. But yet this is,
                  As one is themſelfe ſo they thinke of others.
                and this was, and this will be euer, that as euery one is true and good himſelfe, ſo eaſily thinketh he others to be ſuch, but often deceyued, and ſo was Iacob heere. Yet as God would it was not then found out, for Rachell made a cunning excuſe, as you ſee in the text, that her father ſhould not ſearch vnder her, where in deede theſe idols were though vnknowne to Iacob.
               
                  Reade 1. Sam. 19.13. ſomewhat to the purpoſe.
                Such wits haue women often times vpon a diſtreſſe, to ſhift away a ſhame, which in deede were better neuer deſerued, then with any deuiſe, though neuer ſo fine auoyded.
            
               
                  Verſe. 36.
                  
               
               14 Then Iacob was wroth, ſayth the text, and chid with Laban,
               
                  Some anger lawfull.
                a iuſt anger that hath a iuſt cauſe, and is not immoderate. What griefe to a true man to be made a thiefe, and to be burdened with practiſe that his ſoule abhorreth. Yet this you ſee falleth out ſometimes, and by name now heere to Iacob, which muſt worke a ſtay of minde in vs if a like thing happen.
                  Exo. 32.19. Num. 16.15 1. Sa. 20.34.
                
               Moſes was angry when he ſaw the calfe, and when Corah rebelled, Num. 16.15▪ Ionathan for his fathers rage againſt his friend Dauid, and many moe examples of lawfull anger hath the ſcripture, ſo that all anger is not forbidden, but onely ſuch as hath ſinne in it.
            
               15 In the expoſtulation that Iacob maketh, if you marke it &amp; reade it,
                  From 38. to 43.
                  
                is notably layd downe the faithfull vſage of a good ſeruant, and the vnkind requitall of a bad mayſter. A good ſeruant is not flitting euery day and changing,
                  Properties of a good ſeruant, and a bad mayſter.
                but 20. yere in a place ſometimes as Iacob heere. He waſteth not any wayes his mayſters good vnder his hands, but ſo careth for and regardeth all things, that his mayſter proſpereth by his faithfull trauell, in the day he is conſumed in the heate, and with froſt in the night, and his ſleepe departeth from his eyes, for thus ſpeaketh Iacob of

himſelfe. An vnkinde mayſter is deſcribed thus, cruelly he requireth of the hands of his ſeruant whatſoeuer is loſt, without regard of circumſtances: he changeth his wages often and euer to the worſe, and at laſt he ſendeth empty away, whome in all conſcience he ſhould reward very liberally. Thus you ſee is Laban charged heere, and let vs be aſhamed of ſuch qualities.
            
               16 Then Laban anſwered, Theſe daughters are my daughters, &amp;c. Now ſee a trick of this world agayne,
                  Hollow ſlattery.
                when a man is brideled, and dare not hurt, then to pretend fauour and loue, and to ſmooth the matter as though he neuer meant hurt, which is not ſo. This iugling the world hath not loſt yet, but God ſeeth truth, and loueth truth.
            Finally, a couenant of loue Laban will haue made,
                  A quiet ende of all troubles.
                becauſe his conſcience accuſed him of euill deſerts. Iacob is content, and letting anger go, maketh them good cheere. Laban ſweareth like an idolater, and Iacob aright, conſider you both: of a rough beginning, there is a ſmooth ending. Laban taketh his leaue, and departeth quietly, and all is well. O able God, and carefull God for thy children euer, make vs thy ſeruants faithfull and true, that in all ſtormes we may finde thy fauour, and of all feares no worſe an end then in thy mercy may be to our comfort, as this was now to Iacobs.

               The chiefe things of this Chapter are theſe.

                     The meeting of the Angells.
                     The meeting of his brother Eſau.
                     And his wreſtling with the Angell.
                  
               
            
            FOr particulars, let vs remember that but euen now was ended Iacobs feare of Laban, and his bad meaſure that he was

euer like to offer to him and his,
                  A ſucceſſion of feare to the godly.
                had not God reſtrained him, and now followed preſently at the ende of that the feare of his brother Eſau, whome hee muſt meete. What ſheweth this vnto vs, but the continuall ſucceſſion of feare vpon feare, trouble vpon trouble, and tryall vpon tryall vnto the godly, to the true teaching of vs what to expect,

                and wherewithall not to be diſmayed if it happen, for it is the lot of Gods deereſt.
            
               2 We ſee heere a multitude of Angells meete Iacob as hee ſetteth on his iourney. Where firſt marke the thing, and then the oportunitie of it touching time. For the thing it ſelfe, it truly confirmeth this doctrine, that God giueth his Angels charge ouer his elect to attend and defend them as ſhall ſeeme beſt to his great, mercy and infinite wiſedome, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, are they not all miniſtring ſpirits,
               
                  Hebr. 1.14.
                
               ſent forth to miniſter for their ſakes which ſhalbe heires of ſaluation? ſo ſaith the Prophet, the Angels of the Lord pitcheth round about them that feare him,
               
                  Pſal. 347.
                
               and deliuereth them: yea, hee hath giuen them charge ouer euery one that putteth his whole truſt in God,
                  Pſal. 91.11.
                and committeth himſelfe wholy to his protection in all temptations, to keepe ſuch an one in all his wayes. And they ſhall beare that perſon in their hands that hee hurt not his foote againſt a ſtone.
               
                  2 King. 6. Act 12. Ezeck. 19.
                Examples in Elizeus, in Peter, in many mo. It derogateth therefore greatly from the mercy &amp; care that God hath for his to ſay euery man hath but one good Angell and one bad, for euery man and woman fearing God hath many as Iacob had heere, and euen ſo many as any way ſhall be needfull in his wiſedome that euer knoweth what is expedient &amp; fit. Secondly for the oportunitie of this viſion, you ſee how great it was, euen then when Iacob was ſetting forward to meete with his brother Eſau, of whome, he was very greatly afrayde, not only for himſelfe, but for thoſe with him that were as deere to him as his life. What they taught Iacob by thus appearing vnto him, we may all very eaſily conceyue ſurely euen this, that though he were weake, yet was he ſtrong, ſtrong I ſay by God, and the might of his power, who ſhould neuer ſuffer him to miſcary, whilſt he had an Angell in heauen to ſend with him, but would ſo ſtand on his ſide againſt Eſau, that all ſhould be well, and with

ſafetie paſſed ouer. O this God, this God of ours, doo wee not ſee him? Since this booke began haue wee not ſeene many teſtimonies of his loue, and care not only to help and comfort, but euen in the nick to doo it when there is moſt neede, and when his childs heare is downe in the body by ſome occaſion. Neuer any more notable then this to Iacob heere, and therefore let vs marke it, and of them all conclude how bleſſed the man is that hath the God of Iacob for his help, &amp; whoſe truſt is in the Lord his God.
            
               3 The next thing we may marke, is the counſell of Iacob vnder Gods bleſſing, taken of him to pacifie his brother,
                  The godly vſe means.
                and to haue a good meeting. Firſt he ſendeth meſſengers to him,
                  V. 3.4.5.
                  
                to ſignifie his comming, leaſt by ſtealing by him he might iuſtly offend. Secondly, he deuideth his people and cattell as you ſee. Thirdly he prayeth. Fourthly and laſtly hee ſendeth a preſent. In all which we may note two things. Firſt, that the godly haue neuer bin deſpiſers of means, though their truſt in God, and aſſurance of his helpe were neuer ſo great, but wiſely and with good pollicie and diſcretion they haue diſpoſed themſelues to vſe the ſame as God directed. Secondly,
                  In wordly things. My Lord Eſau.
                that it is lawfull to vſe ſubmiſſion in ſome ſort to the wicked, and that religion ſtandeth not in ſtubbornes and frowardnes, and diſdainefull, proude, and vndutifull ſpeaches, as ſome imagine.
            
               4 Theſe meſſengers thus ſent of Iacob to giue his brother notice of him,
                  Verſe. 6.
                  
                returne againe and tell him that Eſau commeth to meet him with 400 men, whereupon ſayth the text,
                  Verſe. 7.
                  
                
               Iacob was greatly afrayd, and ſore troubled,
               
                  How hard it is for the beſt to cleaue ſtedfaſtly &amp; ſtrongly to God.
                not knowing what Eſau meant by bringing thus many with him (which of like Eſau did onely for pomp and to ſhew his power) but fearing the worſt, as nature is apt in the very beſt. The thing that we are to note in it, is, how hard it is euen for Iacob, yt is a very extraordinary mā
               ▪ to cleaue ſtedfaſtly vnto God in perill &amp; danger, and to ouercome by faith ſuch falſe feares as will muſter thēſelues before his eyes. We ſaw before how God had comforted him by yt hoſt of Angles that met him, yet now euen now againe when hee heareth this newes, the infirmitie of fleſh appeareth, and Iacob is ſore afrayd. Knowe wee then our mould what it is, and if ſo notable a man

as Iacob, after ſo many incouragements, haue yet imperfection of faith, ſet wee it downe that great is our neede farre farre vnlike Iacob to pray for faith, that the Lord may increaſe it in vs euer more and more. See againe in Iacob euer as we go the life of man, feare after comfort, and comfort after feare, ebbings and flowings, riſings and fallings, ſo wee go along, and ſo wee ſhall ende.
            
               5 That he falleth to prayer after he had deuided his companies,
                  The right vſe of meanes.
                ſee both the right vſage of lawfull meanes, and the true cōfort in all diſtreſſe whatſoeuer it is. The right vſage of meanes is with prayer, and the right vſe of prayer is with meanes if God offer them: theſe, one exclude not an other, but both ioyne together as louing friends, and thus ioyned and ioyntly vſed, the Lord giueth his bleſſing to the beſt. The true comfort in all diſtreſſe, we ſee heere is to flye to God by prayer, to caſt vp our eyes, hands, and harts to his holy Maieſtie, that hath written his faithfull in the palmes of his hands, and cannot forget them. This now is Iacobs refuge chiefe and moſt comfortable. O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Iſaac, looke vpon me &amp;c. We know how he ſped, and what promiſe we haue at this daye if we knocke, therefore vſe we the like in our diſtreſſes, and expect in comfort his aſſiſtance.
            
               6 In the Prayer it ſelfe, conſider how ſweete it is in the childs wo,
                  Verſe. 9.
                  
                for him to be able to remember that his parents were godly and in fauour with the Lord.
                  Parents pietie a comfort to the children.
                Then conceiueth hee comfort, that hee which loued the ſtock, will not caſt away the branch, but graciouſly reſpect him, and therefore to his comfort he crieth O God of my father, ſuch an one and ſuch an one that went before me, looke vpon me, and haue mercy vpon me, thou waſt his God full good and full kinde, euermore, ſhew mercy now to his ſeede according to thy ſweet promiſe, and ſo foorth. A great cauſe to make parents godly if there were no other, that their children euer may pray as did Iacob,
               
                  Prayer hath her ſtrength from promiſe.
                
               O God of my father, &amp;c. 2. Conſider how he groundeth both prayer and hope, vpon word and promiſe, ſaying, Lord, which ſaydſt vnto me returne &amp;c. So let vs doo, and not firſt do raſhly what we had no warrant for, and then pray

to God for helpe, wherein we haue no promiſe: yea it you marke it, he repeateth this promiſe ouer againe in the twelfth verſe, it was ſuch ſtrength vnto him to conſider it. Thirdly not merit, but want of merit is his plea.
                  Iacob plea deth no merit.
                
               I am not woorthie of the leaſt of al thy mercies, &amp;c. Which beateth downe all Popiſh pride, and biddeth them learne, that ſur
                  •
               ly if Iacob wanted worthines, and worthines of the leaſt, they are no Iacobs but farre behinde him, and therefore much more vnworthie mercies many, and mercies great which yet God beſtoweth. Secondly, it mightily comforteth vs againſt that fiery dart of the diuell, wherewith hee often trobleth ſome weak ones, namely yt they are vnworthy vile &amp; wretched, and thus and thus vnworthie, therefore they may not pray to God nor expect frō him any fauour. Ah wicked ſpirit auant:
                  Note this comfort.
                for do we ſee here Iacob driuen away from God with any vnworthines, no no: but in the humble confeſſion thereof, notwithſtanding it all he commeth to God, and ſo doo wee comfortably and boldly. For though our vnworthines bee more then Iacobs, yet is it not the meaſure onely that God hateth but the thing, and if here we ſee the thing no reaſon to driue from God, where it is acknowledged, ſurely no more is the meaſure neither where that alſo is confeſſed and bewailed truly. Laſtly, conſider here he alledgeth his weaknes as a reaſon to moue God to mercy: for I feare him ſaith he, leaſt hee will come and ſmite mee and the mother vpon the children.
               
                  Verſe 11.
                  
                What a comfort is this that wee ſhould haue warrant in the word to vrge God to mercy by reaſon of our wants? Sathan perſwadeth vs we muſt runne away by reaſon of our wantes: but you ſee he lieth, and the contrary here is our comfort. Yet ſee this further. Iacob was comforted many waies as you ſawe before, that hee ſhould not feare, yea by an hoſte of Angels that met him, and yet he feareth. This was a great infirmitie of fraile fleſh in Iacob you muſt needs confeſſe, and yet ſo farre is Iacob from being daunted with this to keepe from God, that euen becauſe of it hee goeth to him, and not hiding it nor fearing the diſcouery of it, layeth it before the Lord as an argument to moue him. How then ſhall we doo quite contrary to what we ſet here, and ſay O I dare not, I dare not, I am ſo weake and euer fearing that God will not heare mee. Moue him as Iacob moued him, &amp; ſay as Iacob might haue ſaid.

Truth Lord I haue had many comfortes and helpes of my faith to driue all feare farre from me, and to aſſure me of thy care, and yet Lord I feare ſtil, thou maiſt ſay therefore to me O thou of litle faith I will no more regard thee, but Lorde ſuch is not thy ſternnes to thy children. What moued thee therfore firſt to yeeld me comfort, let it moue thee ſtil I moſt humbly beſeech thee, for they both ſtil remaine, to wit thine owne goodnes and my imperfection. Thine remaineth, and mine is not yet gone quite as it ſhould, Lord then helpe me for yet I feare. Thus ſhall we follow Iacob rightly in this place, and let him thus profit vs.

withall, ſtil to keepe that? Vnderſtand by Canaan, the truth of the figure euerlaſting heauen, and what ought we to part withall to purchaſe that? Surely not with as much as Iacob doth here, but with all that euer we haue, euen life it ſelfe, if ſo the caſe require. For hee that loueth houſe or land or any thing more then that, is vnworthie of it. So then poſſeſſe wealth, that we willingly part with it, if the keeping muſt part vs and our heauenly country.

                  Iacobs wreſtling.
                and hauing gotten ouer his wiues and children and all that he had, ouer the ford Iabbock, Iacob himſelf is left alone, when there commeth a man and wreſtleth with him. The text ſaith a man, but it was God in the forme of man. Which wreſtling as it was a very extraordinary thing &amp; ſtrange, why it ſhould be to ſuch as doo not vnderſtand it: ſo was it a notable thing and full of inſtruction to vs if we do vnderſtand it, and conſider of the Lords dealings and purpoſe herein, both with Iacob and others his faithful euermore.
                  The doctrine and vſe of this wreſtling.
                Firſt then this wreſtling warned and forewarned as it were Iacob, that many ſtruglings remained for him yet in his life to be runne through and paſſed ouer, which were not to diſcomfort him, when they hapned, for as here, ſo there, he ſhould go away with victory in the end. Secondly, it deſcribed out the condition not onely of Iacob, but of all the godly alſo with him, namely, that they are wreſtlers by calling while they liue here, and haue many &amp; diuers things to ſtruggle withall and againſt, ſome outward, ſome inwarde, ſome carnall, ſome ſpiritual, ſome of one condition, ſome of an other, which all, yet through God they ſhal ouercome and haue a ioyful victorie in concluſion, if with pattence they paſſe on, &amp; by faith laie hold vpon him euer in whom they only can vanquiſh, Chriſt Ieſus. Thirdly, it was God, not man, yet man appearing, &amp; God hidden, to tel and teach vs yt in all our aſſaults, trials, and confl
                  •
               cts, it is God yt we haue to do withal, and yt entreth ye liſts to wreſtle with vs, to the end our ſtrength may appear, although not God but mā or ſome other means appear vnto our outward eies: which thing is a matter of great moment to al faithful to be remembred euer: for we ſhal therby cōceiue great comfort &amp; leſſe feare, knowing yt no euil

can come in the end from ſuch an aduerſarie, whereas the ignorance or forgetfulnes of this maketh vs runne too violently vpon the outward cauſes or cauſers and ſo to offend. It mightly ſtand Iob that he ſaw it was God yt 
               wraſtled with him, &amp; did not barely reſpect the ſecond meanes. Fourthly, it diſcouered the ſtrength whereby Iacob both had and ſhould ouercome euer in his wreſtlings, euen by Gods vpholding with the one hand, when he aſſaileth with the other and not otherwiſe: which is an other thing alſo of great profit to be noted of vs, that not by any power of our own▪ we are able to ſtand, and yet by him and through him conquerers and more then conquerers. Fiftly, it is ſaid, that God ſaw how he could not preuaile againſt Iacob, which noteth not ſo much ſtrength in Iacob as mercy in God euer kinde and full of mercy. Compare it with a ſpeech not vnlike vnto it in the 19. of Geneſis where it is ſaid, I can do nothing till thou be gone, &amp;c. Gods cannot,
                  Ge. 19.22.
                is his wil not, for loue that he hath vnto his children, and liking to be euen ouercome by their faith. Sixtly, he touched the holow of Iacobs thigh and it was looſed, ſo that Iacob haulted. Whereby we may ſee how the godly wreſtle with temptations in this life and ouercome, ſurely ſic vincunt vt vulnerentur, ſo they ouercome, that yet now and then they get rappes, and wipes. Dauid was a notable wreſtler, yet ſinful fleſh gaue him a foule venye or two, though he roſe againe like a good wreſtler by true repentance, and had the victorie againſt that fall. So all the godly by one imperfection or other, we ſee they get wipes, though in the end all is well by the ſtrength of him that gat no rappe vnto ſinne, Chriſt our dear ſauiour &amp; true ouercommer. Seuenthly, that the Lord ſaith to Iacob Let me go, it wonderfully commendeth Iacobs tollerance of the Lords wreſtlings, till himſelfe gaue euer and would depart: and to vs it giueth this doctrine, that when 
                  •
               od doth trie with vs by any temptation and croſſe, by any aſſault and ſpirituall exerciſe, we ſhuld not be content only for a day or two, or while we thinke good, but euen ſo long indure his good pleaſure, till himſelfe do giue ouer of himſelfe, not preſcribed nor appointed by vs: which becauſe it is a great matter for our frailty to do, therefore we may boldly pray that the Lord would in mercy conſider our ſtrength, and according to his promiſe laie no more

vppon vs then hee will make vs able to beare: but giue the iſſue with the temptation in due time to his glory and our good. Laſtly, that Iacob ſaith, Hee will not let him go except he bleſſe him: It teacheth vs to be ſtrong in the Lord when ſoeuer we are tried, and euen ſo hartie and comfortable, that wee as it were compell the Lord to bleſſe vs ere hee go, that is, by his mercifull ſweetnes to comfort our hearts, and to make vs more and more confirmed in all vertue and obedience towardes him, yelding vs our praier as farre as it may any way ſtand with the ſame, with force and violence as it were offered on our partes to the Lord, he highly eſteemeth and richly rewardeth euermore. Thus did the woman of Canaan wreſtle with him and would not let him goe, till hee had bleſſed her in her daughter.
                  Mat. 15. 1. Sam. 1. Cant. 3.4. 2. Kin. 4.30
                Thus did Anna wreſtle with him for a childe and let him not goe, till ſhee had him: and ſo many others faithfull men and faithfull women in their ſeuerall caſes. And thus doe you ſee how profitable a thing this wreſtling of God with Iacob is, if it be well conſidered. Many are the conflicts of all them that will ſerue God with a good conſcience, and God knoweth what yet hangeth ouer any man or womans head, that they ſhall tugge withall before they dye. Whatſoeuer it is turne to this place and conſider theſe thinges, follow and fulfill as the Lord inableth you this courſe, and Gods truth for your warrant, you ſhall wreſtle well, and to your great comfort in the end.

                that his good legge noteth the godly who walke vprightly before the Lord, and his bad legge, the wicked that euer hault and are not ſound. Others, that his good legge noteth the ſpirit in man which is ſtrong and willing, the bad legge, the fleſh which is fraile and weake, &amp;c. That the Iewes eate not of that part, was a ceremonie of that people who had many moe. Much better ſhould they abſtaine from all halting in Gods ſeruice and true religion, then from the part that was touched,
                  Read Heb. 12.13. 1. Re. 11.21
                but that fleſh and bloud is more buſie in matter of ſhew and outward obſeruance,

then in matter of weight, and inward truth. Thus let it ſuffiſe to haue profited by this Chapter.
         
         
            Chap. 33. 
            
               The chiefe matter of this whole Chapter, is the reconciliation of the two brethren, Iacob and Eſau when they met. Which how it was in the diſcourſe thereof we ſhall ſee.

                  In peril nor amazement, but counſell is conuenient.
                
               hee diuided the children to Leah and to Rahel and to the two maides. Wherein wee ſee thus much, that a wiſe man is not ſo ſmitten out of his wits with a danger when he is in it, that hee cannot tell what hee doth, as many men are, but hee gouerneth his feare and keepeth it within limits, hee caſteth about in good diſcretion and abilitie of minde what is beſt to be done, he concludeth quickly, and executeth ſpeedily his determination, and ſo all being done that he can, for his part he committeth the whole to his gracious God, to bleſſe and giue ſucceſſe to as his will ſhall be. This let vs marke in Iacob heere, and by it hereafter ſtaie ſuch amazements as many of vs vſe to be ſubiect to in a diſtreſſe when it commeth.

               2 Hee put the maides and their children foremoſt, and Leah and her children after,
               
                  The godly haue their affections.
                
               and Rahel and Ioſeph laſt. Which if it were done in reſpect of ſecuritie and ſafetie to one more then an other, we ſee then in the godly how affections haue place. To the maides he wiſheth well, and to their children, but to Leah better, and to Rahel beſt of all. Thus are good men, men, and ſubiect as I ſay to humane affections in their meaſure. But if he put Rahel hindermoſt, becauſe ſhee had but one childe, then ſauoreth it of order as was ſaid before. The former for my part I rather thinke, for we haue ſeen before his exceeding loue to Rahel, &amp; in ye former Chapter this reaſon was giuen of diuiding the

people, That if Eſau come to the one company and ſmite it, the other company ſhall eſcape.
               
                  Verſe 8.
                  
                Therfore euident as I thinke what he meant to Rahel when he ſet her laſt.
            
               3 Then hee went before them himſelfe,
               
                  Iacobs going before all, ſhewed his faith and loue.
                
               and bowed to the ground ſeuen times vntil hee came to his brother Eſau. His going before, a notable argument of his faith. For God hauing ſaid vnto him, I will bee with thee, in the aſſurance of this which his heart beleeueth, hee marcheth forward. His loue alſo appeareth to his charge that followed him. For what part they take he wil take, and that firſt and formoſt, yea hee will interpoſe himſelfe betwixt them and the danger, that he may auert it from them if God ſo will. A paterne of a good ſhepheard, of a good parent, of a good maiſter, and in deede the office of a couragious Captaine. His bowing as it was a token of his ſubmiſſion to his brother in worldly thinges, ſo may it reſemble the eſtate of the Church in this world, ſtooping and bowing ſubiect, and vnder their pompe and ſtate in this life, who in the next ſhalbe moſt miſerable for euer and euer. The glory of the wicked is here, and the godly are vnder, the glory of the godly is in the next life, and then the wicked ſhall be vnder. Haue we patience then and tarry the time till it may appeare what we are.

                  Al harts in Gods hand
                
               and fell on his necke and kiſſed him, and they wept. O the power of God to turne all hearts which way he will. Now be we iudges our ſelues whether it be not true that Salomon ſaith: The Kings heart is in the hand of God, and as the riuers of water hee turneth it whether ſoeuer pleaſeth him,

               yea hell and deſtruction, are before the Lord, how much more the hearts of the ſonnes of men. Where is that of Eſau now, the dayes of mourning for my father will come ſhortly, and then will I kill Iacob? The Lord, euen the mighti
                  •
                and mercifull Lord, hath wiped it out of his mouth and heart, out of his minde and purpoſe, and out of his might and power. And here is a change farre fitter for a brother. Glad was Iacobs heart when hee ſaw this I warrant you, and glad were all his people. Bleſſed be God that can ſo cheare his children euer, and ſo ſitteth in the hearts

of their threatners that they cannot moue, but as he will. Who will not truſt in this God in all his diſtreſſes, that he ſhall worke for him and chaunge hearts to his beſt comfort euermore. Is he the God of Iacob alone, are all his promiſes come to an ende when Iacob is helped? No, no: we alſo are his, and he is ours, dearer to him then his owne life when time was, and for vs therfore alſo ſhall he thus worke in the hearts of men as ſhalbe good for vs if we cleaue to him. What can a thundring ſcolding enemy do to you or mee more then Eſau could do to Iacob. If you will thinke of nature, God is ſtronger then nature, and therefore can effect more. Be it vnto vs then in the Lords bleſſing, euer an increaſe of our faith this example. Something again as a means conſider of Iacobs humilitie, who bowed himſelfe ſo to his brother. Doth not God bleſſe it to a good effect? Sic vent os

                  Children the gift of grace.
                Therein acknowledging children to bee not onely the gift of God, but the gift of his grace to as many as haue them, which is a great comfort if it be well marked to all fathers and mothers of children. Againe before a bad man, yet he ſpeaketh religiouſly, and Eſau maketh no ieſt at it as bad as hee was. Wee frame our ſelues too much to company and prophane ſpirits in our daies, ſcoffe at any thing that ſauoureth of religion.
            
               6 Next hee aſketh him of the droues which he met: not that he was ignorant,

before and ſhewed to be lawfull. Eſau his ſpeech that hee had inough, ſheweth the pride of rich mens hearts,

                that in that chaunge of countenance from that which he feared, hee ſaw euidently Gods face, that is his worke, prouidence and mercie, and therefore his heart ioyed in it. His terming of his preſent to be a bleſsing, hath this reaſon, becauſe gifts were giuen of the godly that gaue them willingly,

We haue men and women within compaſſe of our knowledge, whoſe wrath can neuer be appeaſed by any meanes that either the parties themſelues or any friends for them can make. No ſubiection, no ſubmiſſion, no wordes, no deedes, can ſtirre them a iote. And yet they would be loth to be called Eſaus, much more impatient, if a man ſhould ſay farre worſe then Eſau. But they ſee themſelues whether indeed it be not ſo: when Eſau is intreated and they cannot, to that which God and grace and the perill of damnation perſwadeth vnto. God is loue, and without loue, without God, and conſequently, caſt away for euer.

Better it is that the able go more ſoftly, then the weake and feeble ouer faſt: for the one hath daunger the other none.

ſingled out in a partiall affection, and for ſome ſhew of that which indeed is not in them. They are all the Paſtors care, and he muſt in conſcience driue as the weakeſt may indure, not hurling &amp; haſting to the abilitie of ſome, &amp; vtterly ouerthrowing the greater part. A good Phiſition of the body doth not deſire to cure haſtily, but ſurely and ſoundly: and why muſt the Phiſition of the ſoule his praiſe, conſiſt in haſte?

The Paſtors office is aboue their reach, if they loued not to haue an oare in other mens boats: and he that hath called him to it, counted him faithfull and put him in his ſeruice, hath indued him with diſcretion, and aſſiſteth him with a conſcience to cōſider his charge, who be ſtrong, and who be weake, what might be done, and what is conuenient and profitable to bee done, with the diſcharge in ſinglenes before his eyes, that is the ſhepheard of ſhepheards, and chiefe Biſhop of our ſoules,

His courſe and reaſons thereof haue an other iudge. Iacob may not haue more care of bruit beaſts, then Miniſters muſt haue of Gods people, but he wil not ouerdriue the very weakeſt, no more muſt the Miniſter if he meane to ſaue and not kill. Haſte hath made waſte, that I can tell, and more leiſure would haue been better ſpeed. Remember Iacob here.

                and deliuered them out of danger. Now Iacob buildeth an aultar in the true thankfulnes of his ſoule vnto God for this great mercy and deliuerance of him from his brother Eſau. And hee calleth it the mightie God of Iſrael: giuing to the ſigne the name of the thing which it ſignified, which is vſuall in the ſcripture. Thus would he publiſh Gods goodnes in his ſafe-being, with all his after all dangers. Would God it might kindle ſome heat in our hearts and conſciences, to conſider our ſelues, the daungers that we haue been in in our

For this hath the Lord done for vs, and whatſoeuer it is in our eyes, ſurely it is wonderfull euen through the world. All nations ſee our happines, the wicked gnaſh their teeth at it, the godly haue ſent vs their gratulations, and they bleſſe GOD for vs. But where now are our Aultars? That is, where are our thankes and moſt gratefull ſonges of our deliuerance? We haue found mercie as Iacob did, yea farre more, for greater Eſaus haue come againſt vs, then did againſt him, not with foure hundreth men, but many thouſandes, to captiuate vs for euer as their ſlaues when they had ſlaine their fill. And yet wee liue, and by God onely who hath ſtraungely reuenged vs vpon them that would thus haue eaten vs vp. Yet with Iacob we build no Aultars. That is I ſay againe, wee giue not thankes for the cuſtome of our time, as hee did after the manner of his. At the firſt peraduenture wee did, but it was ſoone at an end. Now we are fallen into a dead ſleepe againe, and both God and his mercy is forgotten. Our daunger alſo as if it had neuer been. But in the Lord I beſeech you, let vs awake againe, looke vpon Iacob heere what hee doth, and euery man and woman follow his example. Build God an Aultar, not in earth with lime and ſtone, but in your heart of moſt kinde and thankfull remembrance for all his mercies to the land, to our dread ſoueraigne, to our ſelues, our ſoules and bodies, to our wiues and children, to our neighbors and friendes, and infinite wayes that wee cannot name. Bleſſe his Maieſtie for them, and let not the remembrance die, till you dye your ſelfe. A thankfull heart is all that the Lord

ſeeketh, and it is all that in deed we can doe to him. The childe vnborne hath cauſe to thanke him, and much more we that enioy his mercy at this preſent houre. The Lord touch our harts that they may feele, that Lord looſe our tongues that they may ſpeake, and the Lord inable both heart and tongue to continue praiſes vnto his maieſtie, not for a day or tws, but whileſt breath goeth through our noſtrelles, and we remaine. O our God of mercie, bleſſed be thou, bleſſed to day and bleſſed for euer: bleſſed with heart, and bleſſed with ſoule: yea bleſſed with the ſoule of our ſoules: for we were dead &amp; now liue, yea as ſheepe appointed to the ſlaughter after ſtrange tortures and torments before, ſo were wee: but the ſnare is broken and we are deliuered: we releaſed, and our enemies crawling in the bottome of the ſea. Thou haſt done it O God our God, and to thee be praiſe for euer and euer for it. Amen, Amen.
         
         
            Chap. 34. 
            
               The chiefe heads of this Chapter are theſe three.

                     The defiling of Dinah the daughter of Iacob.
                     The fraud and ſubtiltie of her brethren,
                     The cruel murder they committed for that cauſe.
                  
               
            
            COncerning the firſt, the text ſaith, Dinah went out to ſee the daughters of that country.
               
               
                  Verſe 1.
                  
                That is, ſhee went a walking to gaze and ſee faſhions,
                  Womens needles going abroad.
                as women were euer deſirous of nouelties, and giuen to needles curioſitie. Shechem the ſonne of Hamor Lorde of that countrey ſaw her, and preſently tooke her, laie with her, and defiled her. This was the fruit of her needles ietting abroad being a young woman. A profitable example to warne all youth honeſtly minding and meaning, to beware, and to keepe within: for it is ſafe, it is ſure, it is credite ſo to doe. Libertie and looſenes hath ſpoyled manie

an one as it here did her. Which the wiſe Syrach well knowing,
                  Syrach 7.24.
                willeth all that haue daughters to keepe their bodies and not to ſhew any cheerfull face to them, that is, not to be fond ouer them and readie to grant them what libertie witleſſe youth may wiſh to haue, but rather to marry them with all good ſpeed, and then is a weightie worke performed. Salomon indued with ſuch deepe wiſedome, noteth it as a propertie of an vnchaſt woman and giuen to filthie delightes,
                  Pr. 7.11. &amp;c
                
               that her feete cannot abide within her houſe, but now ſhe is without, now in the ſtreetes, and lieth in wayt at euery corner.
               
                  1. Tim. 5.13
                The Apoſtle Paul againe as a thing that greatly diſgraceth any woman liuing layeth it downe, to be i

               le and to go about from houſe to houſe. For this wil make them alſo pratlers and buſie bodies, ſpeaking thinges which are not comely. Dauid compareth a good woman to a vine vppon the walles of the houſe, becauſe ſhe cleaueth to her houſe, and keepeth within euen loth to be gotten out except the occaſion be good and iuſt. Others haue compared her to the ſnaile, that hath euer her houſe vpon her backe.
            
               2 Obſerue the conſent of parents regarded here euen by the Heathens.
                  Verſe 4.
                  
                For Shechem beggeth of his father that he wold get him this mayd to wife, that is,
                  Conſent of parents
                that hee would procure Iacob her fathers conſent, and giue his owne alſo. Of which hauing ſpoken els where at large I ſtand not now. But ſhame it is for vs to be worſe then Heathens.
            
               3 This euil newes is brought to the old man euen to Iacob I meane,
                  Verſe 5.
                  
                
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                that his daughter Dinah was thus taken vp and defiled. Whoſe woe what it was for ſo great a wrong, let parents iudge that know parents hearts? Neuertheles his ſoones being with his cattel in the field, Iacob ſaith the text held his peace till they were come. Thereby declaring that a wiſe man ruſheth not by and by into actions according to his griefe, or when his affections are hote but ſtaieth himſelf, moderateth his heat, and ouerruleth his paſſions til quieter minde may better deliberate of a due courſe. This is grauitie, this is wiſdome, and this is ſtr
                  •
               ngth that greatly adorneth any which hath it. The want of 
                  ••
               is hath

cauſed great repentance when it was too late, and daunted the credit of verie many for ſtaied gouernment of themſelues. Iacob I ſay held his peace.
            
               
                  Verſe 7.
                  
               
               4 When his ſonnes came home they alſo heare the matter, and it greeued the men ſaith the text,
                  Whordom of good ones euer abhorred.
                and they were verie angry, becauſe hee had wrought villanie in Iſrael, and lien with Iacobs daughter, which thing ought not to bee done. See how wee ought to bee affected to this kinde of ſinne, which filthie fleſh ſo ioyeth in. Iacobs ſonnes abhorre it, deteſt it and lothe the verie thought of it: ſo ſhould wee, they conſider circumſtances that increaſe the foulenes of it, as that it was in Iſrael, that is amongſt a people profeſſing God, that it was with Iacobs daughter that is ſuch a noted mans daughter for pietie and religion, &amp;c. ſo ſhould wee, and euer knowing ſinne to be ſinne, yet to knowe that circumſtances make ſinnes greater and greater. This argueth loue of God, loue of vertue and feeling of ſinne, which euer are arguments of Gods holie ſpirite in vs. Compare this deteſtation and religious anger in Iacobs ſonnes againſt this ſinne, with the ieſtes and gibes that fleſhly wordlinges make of it, and with the prettie excuſes that our holie fathers in Rome doe vſe. Si non caſtè tamen caute, if not chaſtly, yet charily, &amp;c.
            
               5 From the 8. verſe to the 13. you haue Hamer his Oration or perſuaſion vſed to Iacob and his ſonnes,
                  Ver. 8 &amp;c
                to obtaine their good wil that Dinah might be married to Sychem.
               
                  A fond father ouer his childe.
                Read it and marke it, and you ſhal ſee nothing but a fond ſpeech of a fond father to ſatiſfie the luſt of a looſe ſonne, who both as he was his father, and as he was the gouernour and magiſtrate of the country, ſhould ſharply haue puniſhed ſuch behauiour in his childe. But peraduenture it was cat after kinde. Such father in his youth, ſuch ſonne in his. Howſoeuer ſurely the truth is tried, that blanda patrum ſegnes facit indulgentia nates. A mallie father, maketh a wicked childe. Read the two and twentie of Deutrenomie.
            
            
               
               6 From the thirteenth verſe to the 18. you ſee the ſubtill courſe which the ſonnes of Iacob deuiſed to be reuenged for the villanie done to their ſiſter, and in her to their whole houſe,
                  Religion made a cloake.
                their making religion and the ordinaunce of God a cloake to couer their craft, and a meanes to compaſſe their deſire by. No new practiſe you ſee, neither yet for age worne out either of memorie or practiſe in our dayes: who would haue thought ſuch deadly wrath had lodged vnder ſo reaſonable wordes, or ſuche bloudie murther vnder the ſhow of a marriage. Deepe is the heart of man wee ſee, and goodly ſhowes haue dreadfull treaſons, and cruell maſſacres often vnder them. Euen aliances therefore and offred knots of great good will beware betimes.
            
               7 The conditions agreed vppon betwixt Hamor and Iacobs ſonnes.
                  Verſe 21.
                  
                The conſent of the reſidue of the people wanted, which Hamor their gouernour to obtaine, aſſembleth them togither at the gate accuſtomed, and there by a ſet Oration,
                  Priuate reſpects couered with cloake of publicke good.
                ſhoweth them what good ſhould growe to the whole Countrie in generall, and to euerie one in ſpeciall, if they would harken vnto the condition of beeing circumſiſed, that thereby there might growe aliances with theſe ſtraungers in marriages with them croſſe either with others. Pretendyng cunningly (whiche is the thing I marke) the publike good, when wholly it was a priuate reſpect that hee had, and a particular pleaſure that hee ſhotte at. Heere is the pollicy then or rather ſubtiltie, which now in our dayes wee ſee ſo riſe. If malice poſſeſſe vs and wiſhe a reuenge, if couetouſnes haue caught vs, and would haue a benefite, or whatſoeuer it is that wee would effect, ſtill the pretence is a publicke good, thus and ſo ſhall the Church bee profited, and thus and ſo ſhall the lande bee inriched, if our deuiſes may haue place, when indeede they tende to as muche good to eyther, as this perſwaſion dyd to the Sichemites, beeyng the meanes

whereby crueltie tooke place, malice and wrath had oportunitie and the fearefull deſtruction of them all was brought to paſſe and compaſſed. Truſt not therefore ouer haſtily ſuch goodly promiſes and painted ſhowes of publike good to bring in an innouation which as this,
                  Innouation dangerou

                      often
                may haue danger vnder it and yet not doubted.
            
               8 The ſilly people conſent vnto Hamer his ſpeech, wherby we may learne how dangerous a temptation the promiſe of gaine and profit is to the ignorant multitude.
                  Verſe 24.
                  
                
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                This winneth and bewitcheth them, this gaineth and getteth them to doo any thing, yea with this both eyes bee dimmed and eares ſo ſtopped, that ſubtil men may worke their wils, and had I wiſt come euer too late.
            
               9 Marke againe what power to effect either good or ill, is in the perſwaſions of great mē to their inferiors.
                  Verſe 24.
                  
                They carry them headlong to deſtruction if ſo they wil,
                  Great mens perſwaſions.
                and they carry them comfortably vnto good if ſo they wil. Happie be the gouernours that perſwade but wel, and ſo anſwer not with their own for the bloud of many. Againe marke here what often els may be ſeene, that when the Lorde determineth to puniſh, men haue no power to foreſee the peril Iniuſtice be taketh the wiſdome from the wiſe, and counſell from the prudent.
            
               10 Thus the inhabitants being inticed to admit of circumſition for an earthly commoditie and reſpect, the third day when they were ſore, Simeon and Leuie the ſonnes of Iacob, with ſwordes drawne come vppon them and kil euerie male amongſt them. A bloudie fact and a great murther in mans eyes worthie of great blame, that for one mans fault ſo many ſhould dye, offering them recompence by admitting their condition, and ſo deeply deluded by ſo holy a ſhow.
                  Both father &amp; ſon are ſlaine, that filthie luſt may haue worthie recompence and ſweet meat ſoure ſawce.
                But altogither we may not eſteeme it by this, but ſomewhat conſider the reuenging hand of a iuſt God in it, who wil neuer ſuffer the wrongs violently offred to his choſen people to eſcape vnpuniſhed if they cleaue to him. The mightie worldlings may imagine they ſhall do what they liſt with vs, and proudly wrong vs, imboldned by their might and our weakenes, but they ſhalbe deceiued, as is ſeene to their terror and our

comfort in this example. That Simeon and Leuie were ſo forward-ſumme in nature we may iuſtly thinke of. For Dinah to them was full ſiſter both by father and mother, where vnto ſome others, ſhe was but onely by father. Leah was her mother, and the mother of Simeon and Leuie alſo. Againe wee may ſee in this example that ſaying verified, Quicquid delirant Reges plectuntur Achiui. For the ſinnes of gouernours the people often ſmart: and therefore happy people that haue a good gouernour. It is a treaſure that of many is little co
                  •••
               dered, and a bleſſing that God is neuer worthily thanked for.
            
               11 Then came the other ſonnes of Iacob vpon the dead, and ſpoiled the Citie.
               
                  Verſe 27 &amp;c.
                See therein anger how it rageth and increaſeth, being once incenſed and ſtirred vp. One man by example kindleth an other, and violence vpon violence will increaſe ſtill,
                  The rage of an offended minde.
                if we ſtay not quickly. If you marke now the ſtate of this Citie, how the children be fatherles, the women comfortleſſe, no houſe without bloudſhead, murther, and death, their goods ſpoyled in Citie and field, their bodies captiuated which remaine aliue. O heauy wo:
                  Stand in awe and ſinne not.
                would not the heart of any man or woman tremble to offend the Lorde, to feede the fleſh that ſinfully luſteth with ſuch deadly delight, and careleſſe to ſcorne what ſo fearefully puniſhed we ſee of God? How happy Hamor, if his ſinning ſonne had neuer been borne, how happy the ſonne, if hee had turned his eyes from euil, and brideled his luſting heart with vertue and honour. How happy all both old and young, both great and litle, men and women, with babes and ſucklings, if God had been feared and ſinne abhorred. This is ſinne in the eyes of the higheſt, a cryer continually for his wrath, till at laſt it come. The Lord giue a feeling, that we truly hate what hurteth &amp; harmeth in this ſort.
            
               12 Then ſaid Iacob to his ſonnes, Ye haue trobled me, &amp;c. Pitifully bemoning the danger which this deſperatenes carried with it, both to him and his, had not God been good,
                  Verſe 30 &amp;c.
                whoſe mercy in deed onely affected, that the countries about did not riſe vp in armes againſt him and deſtroy him quite. The Lord knew how Iacob abhorred this courſe, and yet how perfectly hee hated the

ſinne of his daughter, wherefore in mercy hee prouided for him, ſtaied all euil that might be againſt him, and kept both him and for his ſake, his, that might elſe haue periſhed well inough. I note it to my comfort, and the comfort of many, that maye in their houſes and ſeuerall families,
                  Faults committed in families, ſore againſt the will of the rulers.
                either by children or ſeruants, or friendes, haue that committed whiche their ſoules abhorre, and they little knowe of. God is gracious to regarde the innocent, and to turne from his faithfull ſeruantes that whiche euil committed might procure vnto them, as hee heere did from Iacob. Then marke againe in theſe ſonnes of Iacob, whether for their merites God ſo increaſed them and made them his people,
                  The Iewes not choſen for merites.
                or it onely was mercy and no merit. And remember withall, what by Ezechiel God ſaith vnto them, I meane to the people deſcended of them, and of like merite with them for this that we ſpeake of.
                  Ezec. 16.2. &amp;c.
                
               Sonne of man, cauſe Ieruſalem to know her abhominations, &amp; ſay thus ſaith the Lord God vnto thee. Thine habitation &amp; thy kinred, is of the land of Canaan, thy father was an Amorite, &amp; thy mother an Hittite. And in thy natiuitie when thou waſt born, thy nauel was not cut, thou waſt not waſhed in water to ſoftē thee, thou waſt not ſalted with ſalt, nor ſwadled in cloutes. No eye pitied thee to do any of theſe vnto thee, for to haue compaſsiō vpon thee, but thou waſt caſt out in the open field, to the contempt of thy perſon in the day that thou waſt born, and when I paſſed by thee, I ſaw thee polluted in thine owne blood, and I ſaid vnto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, thou ſhalt liue: euen when thou waſt in thy blood, I ſaid vnto thee, thou ſhalt liue. Marke you this repitition, Euen when thou waſt in thy blood, I ſaid vnto thee, thou ſhalt liue. That is, euen when thou werſt ſinful, wretched and vgly to be looked on in thy ſelfe, yet in mercy I regarded thee, turned my face from thy due deſertes, and ſayd, Thou ſhalt liue. Now if there were no merite in this firſt people, why the Lord ſhould chuſe them before all others, but that mere mercy regarded them in their blood, what merit might be in vs Gentiles wild oliues, and behind them far in circumſtances ſundry of great importance, that we ſhould ſwell and be puffed vp. Read the whole Chapter in Ezechiel, and thinke in your ſoule how much

rather the Lord might complaine of vs generally or particularly as there he doth of them. And what ſhould haue humbled them, let it humble vs, what ſhould haue made them tenne thouſande times thankfull. Let it make vs not onely that way but euerie way dutifull to our liues ende. Moſes was a Leuite, and yet hee writeth this of his father Leuie, an argument euident,

                that fleſh and blood did not rule in the writing of the ſcriptures, which hardly is drawne to laie downe any ſhame or blame of their aunceſters, but that Gods ſpirite the God of truth and veritie, guided and gouerned the penne of the writer, as beſt was ſeeming to his wiſedome.

They neuer thinke of their fathers eſtate and theyr owne in that countrey, that they were but ſtraungers there, that they were but fewe, and that extreame daunger might ariſe both to theyr father and them by this rage. No no, the heate of youth doth firſt performe, and then repent when it is too late. Whither did Cain his outragious anger carry him?

                rather then we will acknowledge that we haue done euil. Againe, how vnprofitable ſpeech is to an angry man til the mood be paſt. Anger ſo darkeneth the mind, that reaſon can haue no place. No, reaſon to a minde incenſed with anger, is like a keye to a locke that is iumbled, that is, it can do no good. And as a theefe choſeth often the darkeſt night, and the fiſher the water that is troubled: ſo ſathan to worke many miſchiefs in, chuſeth a hart when it is troubled with anger. But let thus much ſuffice of this Chapter.
         
         
            Chap. 35.
            
                The chiefe matters of this Chapter are theſe two.

                     The remoue of Iacob away from Shechem.
                     The death of certaine of his deareſt friends.
                  
               
            
            
               COncerning his remoue, the text ſaith, that then God ſayd to Iacob,
               
                  Verſe 1.
                  
                that is to ſay then, euen then when his heart was troubled and full of feare,
                  The care of the lord for his.
                for the bloudie tact of his ſonnes in Scechem. Where ſee, the vigilant care of the Lord ouer his in all their diſtreſſes, doth hee euer forſake them that faithfully and hartely cleaue vnto him? No no, hee is at hand and readie euen before the trouble happen to bee comfortable to vs, becauſe this is eſſentiall in him, and not acceſſory.
            
               
                  Verſe. 1.
                  
               
               2 Marke how he biddeth him go to Bethel and there build an Aultar vnto God, that appeared vnto him when hee fled from his

brother Eſau,
               
                  Gen. 28.
                why if you remember or looke the place Iacob there promiſed, that if God would be with him in the iourney, and keepe him, and giue him bread to eate, and clothes to put on, ſo that he might come againe vnto his fathers houſe in ſafetie, then ſhould the Lord be his God, and that ſtone which be there ſet vp as a piller ſhould be Gods houſe, &amp;c. And hath Iacob beene all this while in the countrey, and not been yet there to performe his vowe, and to giue the Lord thankes, who ſo gratiouſly had granted his deſire? O great ſlowneſſe in ſo good a man, and verye worthie blame exceedingly. See then and marke it well,
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
                how ſlacke the beſt of vs are to paye in proſperitie, what we promiſe in aduerſitie, euen with great zeale. Wee ſaye in ſickneſſe if we may recouer we will do this both to God and man, and in other perils we promiſe much: but alas, where is all, when once we are well and out of danger. Hath Iacob dulneſſe, and haue we none? thinke of it, and by his faulte in this place that muſt be called vpon, and ſpurred vp by God himſelfe: let vs amend what is amiſſe. Then marke againe in this remembrance made by God, the manner of it. Go vp to Bethell Iacob ſayth he, and make there an altar, &amp;c. This is not, why haſt thou not done it, and becauſe thou haſt forgotten me, I will forſake thee, or any ſuch like ſharpe rebuke. Sweete againe, is this if we conſider it. For Iacob was now in ſorrow, his heart being wounded both for his daughter that was defiled, and for the crueltie of his ſonnes, with the perill alſo that his whole familie was in. In which greefe of his, the God of mercie would not adde greefe vnto greefe: but ſparing him kindly, admoniſheth him gratiouſlye with ſweet words,
                  A ſweete example.
                not ſo much as once quipping him for his faulte, with but halfe a ſharpe word. A patterne euer to be followed of vs, one towards an other, that wee bruſe not the heart already broken, but too much, that we inſ

               lt not one ouer an other for ſlippes and wants, but kindely quicken vp, when a harde ſpeech woul
                  •
                cruſh too much. O ſweeteſt GOD, howe ſweete art thou to ſlagg
                  •
               ſh ſinners when they doe faull, and ſhall wee not labour to bee like them, &amp;c.
            
               2 When Iacob had receyued this woord of the Lord, hee

willeth his houſehold to put away theyr ſtrange Gods, plainlye noting that there were ſuch amongſt them. And knew Iacob this and reformed it not? Surely the beſt men then haue theyr affections, and euen good Iacob is not heere without them, Rachell his Wife is moſt deere vnto him, and for her ſake eyther he ſeeth not,
                  Good men oft haue affections too much.
                or he feeleth not with that heat, or both ſeeing and feeling he lingreth reformation ouerlong. She had ſtolne hir fathers idols as you heard before, and what others they had gotten in the ſpoile of the Cittie it is vncertaine. Prone is our nature by naturall corruption to ſuch abuſe, and if Iacobs people ſo well inſtructed, will yet be halting O what are we? This cleaueth to our bones, and the very marrow to be ſuperſtitious and delighted with euill. The Gods that be ſeene beſt like our humors, and what hands haue made we repoſe truſt in, but fie of this folly if wee bee aliue, and not dead in heart to God and grace.
            
               3 What then did God abhorre the houſehold of Iacob, and refuſe it to bee a Church? No, howbeit that familie was thus blemiſhed, and the wife of his loue that ſlepte in his boſome thus all too ſpotted: yet euer were Iacobs ſacrifices acceptable vnto God,
                  Note this well.
                and his family cared for as his Church. Note we thereby, not to loue idolatrie, or to mingle the wheat with the chaffe, ne yet to extenuate Iacobs fault, nor to followe him our ſelues in not reforming. But note wee this, and note it agayne, that particular blemiſhes in ſome of a Church not yet amended, depriue not the whole eyther of name or nature of a Church, neyther make the good thinges therein done according to the worde, (as were Iacobs ſacrifices) of no effect: much leſſe do they reach out daunger of death and damnation to all that holde fellowſhip with that Church, eyther not knowing, or no waie approouing what is euill. I could vrge the place harder if I would.
            
               4 In bidding them cleanſe themſelues and chaunge their garmentes,
                  The vſe of cleane clothes on holy dayes.
                lette vs note how outwarde ceremonies helpe inwarde duties, vſe them as helpes, and not make them our reſts, th
                  •
               nking all is doone when the outwarde thing is doone, but

knowe, that cleane garmentes call for cleane heartes much more, and cleanſed bodies, bid cleanſe our ſoules much rather: elſe are we like the Maſſing Prieſtes that waſhed theyr fingers ſo ſolempnely, and neglected theyr conſciences altogeather, or lyke the hypocriticall Phariſies, that ſcowred ſo carefully the outſide, and forgot ſo negligently the inſide.
            
               5 Then they gaue vnto Iacob all the ſtraunge Gods which were in their hāds,
                  Verſe. 4.
                  
                
               
                  Obedience to doctrine, &amp;c.
                &amp;c. where ſee a very notable example of prompt and ready obedience to the worde. Bleſſed therefore he that had them, and bleſſed they that ſo willingly hearken vnto hym. Such Iacobs to bid, and ſuch people to obey, would long and long continue theſe happie dayes of peace and freedome vnto vs, with a gratious Gouernour and Soueraigne ouer vs, in whoſe dayes wee may truly ſay, mercie and trueth haue mette togeather, righteouſneſſe and peace haue kiſſed each other. But why are they ſo zealous and ready now, hauing beene ſo dul hitherto? Surely the daunger they ſawe themſelues in, by that outrage committed, was a great meanes of it.
                  Perplexities profitable.
                And therefore well may wee marke howe profitable for vs ſometimes are feares and dangers, troubles and perplexities in this worlde. Then are wee awaked and quickened that before were heauie, and then wee both heare the worde, and obey it with alacritie and readineſſe. Take then the croſſe away, and take our great good away, as we plainly may ſee.
            But the text ſayth,
                  Exo. 32.20
                
               Iacob hid them vnder an Oke that was in Sichem: when as wee read that Moſes tooke the golden calfe that Aaron made, and burnt it in the fire, ground it to powder, and ſtrawed it vppon the waters, and made the children of Iſrael drinke of it. A zeale indeed againſt Idolatrie and ſuperſtition. For aunſwere whereunto it may bee ſayde, that good m
                  •
               n haue their wantes, and Iacob himſelfe in this was not ſo prouident as hee might haue beene. Yet with comfort wee ſee that euen this meaſure of vertue and pietie in Iacob was accepted of God, the want pardoned and caſt out of ſight. With comfort (I ſay) we ſee it, beeing thereby iuſtly incouraged to doe good, and to hate euill, ſeeing there is mercie with God in ſweete kindneſſ
                  •
               ,

to accept what is well, and to turne his face from what is wanting. Away therefore with all diſcouraging thoughts, and verye ſowre conceipts, of no acceptance with God, where any blemiſh or imperfection is. For euen in this example if we had no mo, it is prooued falſe.
            
               6 When Iacob thus had reformed his houſe, he tooke his iorney from Sechem towards Bethel,
               
                  Verſe. 5.
                  
                and the text ſaith: The feare of God was vpon the cities that were round about them, ſo that they did not follow after the ſonnes of Iacob.
                It is the Lord then that cooleth and quencheth the rage of men againſt his children, yea it is the Lord that is able to muſſell the mouthes of the Lions of this world,
                  It is the Lord that ſtaieth intents againſt his.
                whē they briſtle themſelues beſide his liking, to commit any violence or furie vpon the godly. Let him ſay nay, and they cannot ſtirre: let him ſaye I, and they runne a pace.
            The Diuels themſelues cannot touche the Swine tyll they haue leaue of him: and are porcorum ſetae: numbred ſayth the auncient father, and his choſen children forgotten? No, no, there is no power againſt the leaſt of them, except it be giuen from aboue. Therefore care away comfortably, ſing we and ſay we, Si deus nobiſcum, quis contra nos. If the Lord be with vs, who can be againſt vs. No doubt theſe inhabitants had burning harts againſt Iacob, and his familie for the murder committed, but both hartes and handes are bridled by him, that bridleth the verye diuels, and ſuch a feare is ſtricken into them by the Lorde, that Iacob goeth ſafely on his iourney, and not one dare looke out of the doores after him, to attempt any euill againſt him. O ſweete God, O deere God, direct vs aright to be thine truly, and we ſee here our ſafetie. Thou wilt defend, thou wilt protect, and mightier farre then our ſelues are, thou wilt make to feare vs for our good. Bleſſed, bleſſed be thy name for euer, and let our hearts till death be ſecure in thee, Amen, Amen.
            
               
                  Verſe. 19
                  
               
               7 The next thing I note, is the death of Rachell, the wife of Iacob,
               
                  Wordlye comforts ſubiect to change.
                deere and deere, and twentie tymes deere againe vnto his heart. Who can expreſſe the woe of this daye, and the bitterneſſe

of this loſſe to the man of God? Rachel is dead, and is ſhe dead? O death voyde of mercy, or reſpect of perſons. She dyeth vppon childe, an increaſe of greefe: ſhe calleth the childe the Sonne of hir ſorrowe, a heauie worde. But be comforted Iacob, and leaue all to God, who giueth and taketh at his pleaſure. And learne wee by thee whilſt the world indureth, to knowe worldly comforts whatſoeuer they be, to be ſubiect to change. Loue with vnfaynedneſſe, what may be ſo loued, but loue neuer too much for feare of a check.
            So loue, that wee thinke of loſſe if the Lorde ſo will: yet ſo loue, that we wiſh no loſſe if the Lorde ſo will. Let his liking moderate our affections euer, and ſo happilye ſhall wee inioye the thing liked a great deale longer. But if thou exceede, werſt thou as iuſt as Iacob, God wyll ſchoole thee as he heere did Iacob. Thy deereſt Wife, thy deereſt Childe, thy deereſt freend, ſhall feele theyr mortalitie, that thy heart may be taught, and wiſh for eternitie, crying heauily, ſighing with mournefull voyce: Vanitie of vanitie, and all is but vanitie.
            
               8 Greeuous it is alſo that we read in the 22. verſe,
                  Verſe. 22
                  
                
               Ruben the ſonne of Iacob to lye with Bilhah his fathers concubine. But ſuch bitter accidents haue in the wonderfull wiſedome of God befaullen to theſe great men,
                  The vſe of bitter accidents to the Patriarkes.
                that we poore ſoules might not be oppreſſed with greefe, when the like befall vs. Fathers and mothers can doe no more then they can doe, that is, inſtruct, exhorte, admoniſh, and teache theyr children and charge, and if that will not ſerue but contrary to it, they will wilfully and wickedly offend the Lorde, lewdly and looſely behaue themſelues, theyr burden is vpon theyr owne backes, and the God that euer was holy and pure, will paye them home, accepting the induſtrie of the parents in good woorth.
            
               Moſes expreſſeth not how Iacob greeued, when hee heard this, but onely ſayth, it came to Iſraels eares, that is was doone. Surelye the reaſon was this, that wee might thereby conceiue that the greefe was greater then could bee expreſſed to haue his bed defiled by his owne Sonne. So reade wee, the Paynter that portrayed the intended ſacrifice of Iphigenia,
               
paynted her father Agamemnons face couered, becauſe it was not poſſible to expreſſe will the countenaunce of a man ſo plunged in woe. Thinke wee then earneſtly of Iacobs ſorrowe, but know that we cannot think how it was. And what croſſing griefs the Lord ſends vs,
                  Strength againſt o
                        •
                     fences.
                let vs ſtriue to patience by theſe examples. Yea let vs growe by theſe examples to a Chriſtian ſtrength againſt worldly ſcandals and offences, not moued by them to wauer vp and downe as ſome doe, condemning truth, and iudging perſons by faults and offences that do happen. As if one ſhould ſay ſee the religion of theſe men, can it be true, can it bee good, when the profeſſors of it haue ſuch ſpottes? Simeon and Leui cruell bloudſhedders, Dinah wanton and wantonly defiled, and now Ruben an inceſtuous perſon defiling his owne fathers bed. How ſhoulde the religion of theſe men be good? Surely the idolatrous ignorance, and ignoraunt idolatrie of the Gentiles, of the Cananites, Periſites, Iebuſites, or ſuch like, was the good religion, and not the way that Iacob ſerued God by. Were this to reaſon well, or rather for the fals &amp; faults of men to condemne the truth of God, &amp; to cenſure men by their imperfections not to be what they are in deed and truth, though thus defiled? Yet this is the common reaſoning of the world, and thus dayly ſome ſtumble at mens offences. But let vs bee wiſe, and learne by this to take a ſurer courſe to iudge both of men and of religion. Iacob and his family had the true religion, though thus ſinfull fleſh offended ſometimes. All were not euil in ſuch degrees, though ſome offended too much. Bewayle the falles wee may of thoſe that profeſſe the trueth, nay bewayle them we ought with a ſighing hart, but forſake truth for them, or condemne truth to be no truth, we may not, we dare not, we ought not. Let God be true, &amp; all men lyars. Let truth be truth &amp; all men ſinfull, yea ſuch great Patriarks as theſe were not euer free. Though his iudgement ſhall be great that giueth the offence yet they ſhal not be excuſed that ſo far take the offence, as for it to forſake the way that is right. Then hauing thus profited, let vs marke againe in this example of Ruben the ſafetie of ſinners, notwithſtanding ſinne, that truely repent and forſake theyr ſinne. Ruben was not a caſtaway for euer from God hauing thus offended, but ſorrowing and ſighing (as no doubt hee did) for this

vgly tranſgreſſion, the bloud of Chriſt Ieſus beleeued of him then in time to be ſhed, as we beleeue now that it hath beene ſhed, waſhed him cleane, and procured pardon with God, that all ſorrowfull ſinners might haue fayth, and not dolefully die in deſpayring wo, if happily they ſhould fal at any time through ſtrength of fleſh of world or deuill. Thus therefore againe let vs profite by him, and deny to none that hath fallen comfort, if ſight cauſe ſorrow from an heart not fayning.
            
               9 The death of Iſaac the father of Iacob is an other thinge mentioned in this chapter, who enioyed the preſence of his ſonne Iacob to his great comfort before his death.
                  Great faith exerciſed with great croſſes
                And Iacob to all his griefes had this alſo added the death of his father. So that if you thinke of the courſe of Iacobs life but euen hitherto, ſurely his griefes were many, and his croſſes great, ſuch as we doe not indure with that patience that both we ought, &amp; he did, neyther yet with that comfort, as by this example, and others of Gods deare ones we are iuſtly incouraged vnto. God giues friendes, and God takes friends, fathers and mothers, ſiſters and brothers, or whatſoeuer, and he ſpares not any when he will, though hee loue them dearely. Abraham looſeth Terah his father, and Sara his wife: Iſaac looſeth Abraham, &amp; Iacob now Iſaac, beſide other friends whom each of them loſt in their times. This is our eſtate, we hold theſe things during pleaſure, and are tenantes at will, not otherwiſe. That the text ſayth, Iſaac dyed full of dayes, it may well teach vs that there ought to bee a contentment in vs euen with yeares, which indeede is not in too many. But we couet to liue, and ſtill to liue, and euer to liue if it were poſſible. This world ſo pleaſeth vs, as if we dreamed of no other, theſe earthly pleaſures ſeeme the ioyes we wiſh, and death, death, O how bitter is the remembrance of thee euen in very olde age. Surely olde Iſaac was not thus, and I truſt we will note it to our good, and thus much now of this chapter.
         
         
            
            Chap. 36.
            
               THe principall matter of this Chapter, is the progenie and ofſpring of Eſau, in the obſeruation whereof diuers good things may be noted, reſpected no doubt of the ſpirit of God, when hee cauſed it to bee written. As firſt it ſhoweth the trueth of Gods promiſe made concerning Eſau,
               
                  The truth of Gods promiſe euer.
                chap. 25. ver. 23. and elſewhere, and yeeldeth vs this ſweete comfort, that if the Lorde be ſo ſure to them, that are not of his houſehold and familie, but hated as Eſau was, how aſſured may wee be, that hee will neuer fayle vs in any thing promiſed, except he fayle to be God.
            
               2 When it is ſayde that Eſau remooued his dwelling, and gaue Iacob roome,
                  Verſe. 6.
                  
                were it of fauour, or were it for other profitable reſpects in the world to him, we may well note the ouerruling power and prouidence of the almightie for his euer.
                  God his ſweet care for his.
                Had they liued together, being both ſo great, as the 7. verſe noteth, in all likelyhood quarrels would haue growne, and perrillous contentions. Eſau was mightie, fierce and irreligious, and what conſcience ſuch men make, to wrong and wringe a good man, the world yet ſheweth too much. All this, God preuenteth in mercy to his Iacob, and maketh Eſau giue place. Caſt we our care then vpon God, and labour to be his, we ſhall euer bee cared for.
            
               3 Their riches were ſo great, that they could not dwell together (ſaith the text) that they could not dwell together,
                  Verſe. 7.
                  
                and the land wherin they were ſtrangers could not receiue their flockes.
               
                  Gods powrefull prouidence for his in all places.
                Let neuer then filthy feare to want in this world, what may be good for vs: wound our ſoules with diſtruſt in God. The beaſts of the field, the foules of the ayre and the fiſhes of the Sea, be all his, yea the whole earth, and all that is therein is his, as the Pſalme ſayth. If to Iacob and Eſau hee be able to giue ſuch

wealth, when went his powerfull might from him, that hee cannot do it againe to you, to me, to whom ſoeuer his good pleaſure is and ſhalbe. If in a ſtraunge country their flockes be ſo many, let my ſoule neuer diſpaire for place, but dwell where the Lorde appointeth, and with beleeuing heart remember ſuch examples as this. Yea let it go to bed with you, let it riſe with you, write vpon your hand, and print it in the very veines of your hart, what the Pſalmiſt ſaith: The Lorde God is the Sonne, and ſhield vnto vs, the Lord wil giue grace and glorie,
               
                  Pſal. 84 11.
                and no good thing will he withhold from them that walke vprightly.
                  1. Sam. 2.30.
                
               He that honoureth me him wil I honour, ſaith the Lord, and hee will not breake a promiſe to very Eſau, of any good or comfort as you ſee in this whole chapter. Be not we faithles then but faithfull.
            
               4 A ſweete comfort againe I ſee here in this, that if a man and woman feare the Lord themſelues,
                  God is often mercifull▪ euen to the euill children of good parents.
                if religion be ſetled in the furrowes of their hearts, as it was in Iſaac and Rebecca, ſurely euen vnto their wicked children, if they haue any, yet for the parents ſake, God granteth often worldly fauours, as here to Eſau: who would not then with a faithful heart loue ſuch a God He loued Iacob and hated Eſau, yet Eſau beeing the ſonne of a good father, and of a vertuous and religious mother, the fountaine of mercy, and God of all goodnes to his true ſeruants, euen the God of heauen, wil ſhew mercy to this Eſau, thus farre as in the world to make him a great one, and to giue him riches. Againe I ſee worldly ſlate,

               6 The inuention of mules ſpecified in this Chapter, ſheweth the buſie curioſitie of ſome mens natures giuen to newes and ſtraunge inuentions, not contented with ſimplicitie and plainenes, nay diſcontented with the courſe of gods nature many times. If wee praiſe this inuention, take heed wee touch not Gods former diſtinction of their kindes and ſexes which hee had created. Therefore rather blame I, then praiſe ſuch needles newes as this was.
            
               7 You ſee in this Chapter as I ſaid before, all the glory in Eſau and Iacob hath little, but hereafter theſe Edomites fall, and the Iſraelites riſe. Therefore thus let vs profit by it, as neuer with the luſtie bloods of this ſinfull world, to deſpiſe the ſlow going forwarde of the children of GOD, or the cauſe that they maintaine. Sat citò ſi ſat bene. Soone inough, if well inough, that is, faſt inough, if with Gods fauour, and better a ſtable eſtate that is in longer time atteined, then a fickle fading eſtate got in haſt. Not vnlike the graſſe vpon the wall top, that is, ſoone vp, but aſſoone withered and gone againe.
            Laſtly, for genealogies in this Chapter layd downe, I referre them to each mans diligence that liſt to ſearch them, wiſhing the Apoſtles counſell followed in this matter euer, 1. Tim. 1. Verſe 4. and Tit. 3.9. For our Pedigrees in theſe dayes as they haue an vſe modeſtly and moderately looked into, ſo ſhewe

they mens vanities otherwiſe vſed, who yet would not like to bee called vaine. Maximilian the Emperour forgot himſelfe in it, as I haue ſhewed before, and of his very Cooke hee was reprooued. Let not the wiſe man glorie in his wiſedome, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength (much leſſe in ioyned Pedigrees) but hee that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord, and that his name is written in the booke of life, and he reckoned in the rowle of the righteous. He that is ouer buſie in laying downe his aunceſtors, whilſt he ſeeketh to be eſteemed, as deſcended of them, is often iuſtly deſpiſed as degenerated from them, and not in any meaſure ſeeking to expreſſe the vertues in them. But let thus much ſerue both of this matter and of the Chapter.
         
         
            Chap. 37.
            
                The heads of this Chapter are chiefly three.

                     The hatred of the brethren towards Ioſeph.
                     Their treacherie againſt him.
                     The lamentation of Iacob his father for him.
                  
               
            
            
               THe cauſes of their hatred are ſpecified in the Chapter to be theſe: His complaining of them to his father, verſe 2. His fathers great loue to him aboue them, ver. 3. And the dreames which he had, ſeeming to note a ſuperioritie ouer them like to enſue in him, ver. 5. &amp;c. The greatnes of their malice is alſo mentioned when it is ſaid, they hated him and could not ſpeake peaceably vnto him, verſe. 4. For particulars to beginne with the firſt cauſe of their malice towardes him, becauſe he brought their euill as the text ſaith to his father, it may well teach vs, that although brethren in nature and duetie ſhould moſte kindelye loue one an other,

yet not ſo farre, as that they bolſter vp one an other in ſinne and euil. For true brotherly loue admitteth an orderly complaint of euil,
                  Rom. 1. Laſt verſe. Winking at euil.
                yea and euen requireth it. Not only they that do ſuch things ſaith the Apoſtle, but they that fauour them, &amp;c. Noting it a moſt greeuous fault to winke at ſin and wickednes, and to beare with it. Veritas odium parit, fratrum quoque gratia rara eſt. Truth gets hatred, and euen brethren to loue togither (if truth be told) is a hard thing. The ſecond cauſe of the brethrens malice was their fathers loue to Ioſeph aboue them al, an vniuſt cauſe again. For it is lawfull for a parent to loue one child more then an other, as for a man to loue one man more then an other. Our Sauiour Chriſt loued Iohn more th
                  •
               n the reſt, yet might not the reſt therefore haue hated him. Neuertheles Ambroſe his counſell is good in this matter, to wit, that parents ſhould beware, Ne quos natura coniunxit paterna gratia dixidat,
               
                  Note it
                leaſt whom nature hath ioyned,
                  Children begotten in age, loued for two cauſes
                they by their partiall loue doe ſeperate and diſioyne. There is a cauſe laid downe why Iacob loued him more then the reſt, becauſe hee begot him in his age, old men either not looking for any moe in ſuch yeares, or receiuing ſuche as they haue beſides expectation, both which are cauſes of intire loue towardes ſuch as in olde age are borne to them: ſo was Iacob towards Ioſeph. An effect alſo of this loue in Iacob is laid downe, that he made his ſonne a partie coloured coate. A thing likewiſe lawfull, that parents may attire one childe better then an other, yet ſtil wiſedome and diſcretion muſt moderate affection, for feare of ſuch hart burning amongſt children, as here we ſee.
            
               
                  Parentes loue ſhuld not be to childrens loſſe.
               
               2 Yet this childe ſo beloued, went to the field and kept cattel as his brethren did ſometimes, not finding his fathers affection vnto idlenes in him, which is a thing that may greatly profite vs in theſe dayes: wherein if in any thing we wil make a difference betwixt our children, ſurely it is in labour and trauel, and matter of fruitful induſtry for the time to come. Some ſhall be put to all hardnes, yea to all drudgery, and others whome wee fauour more, not ſuffred to do euen good things, wherby hereafter they might bee bettered a great deale, not to learne leaſt they catch cold: not to ſtudy, leaſt their wits be dulled: not to do any thing,

leaſt we want them to make wantons of. So did not Iacob, though he loued Ioſeph, but to the field he went as well as the reſt, and did what he could in that courſe. Iacob ruled his loue to his childes profite, and ſo ſhould wee, Iacob wanted his companie for his good, and ſo ſhould we. Iacob hated idlenes in his children, and ſo do not we
            
               3 The third cauſe of the brethrens wrath, were the dreams that Ioſeph had. The firſt of ſheaues, the ſecond of the Sunne and Moone, and Starres, dooing reuerence to him.
                  God without parents helpe exalteth often their children.
                Of dreames hereafter ſomething ſhall be ſaid: Now concerning his firſt dreame here, Ioſephus ſaith they were ſheaues without corne, and therefore the dreame ſhewed, that not onely he ſhould come to honour, but that honour ſhould be by forreine meanes, not by helpe of anie goods or poſſeſſions of his fathers. Surely howſoeuer the ſheaues did pretend that, ſo it was, and therefore comfortablie teacheth vs, that God is able without parents helpe (if it pleaſe him) to preferre their children euen to the greateſt places, no cauſe to make parents careleſſe, but a verie iuſt cauſe to make them not ouer carefull. And a ſweete comfort to all that either haue no parents of abilitie to enrich them, or if they haue, yet vniuſtlie are throwen off, and by ſiniſter practiſes depriued of their portion, which in nature and equitie is to bee giuen them of their parents. God is in heauen as mightie as euer he was, and as good as euer he was. Let him be my father and mother, and remember Ioſeph, &amp;c.
            
            
               4 What ſay the brethren, Shalt thou reigne ouer vs,
               
                  We rather obey ſtrangers thē our brethren.
                
               and rule vs, or ſhalt thou haue altogether dominion ouer vs, and they hated him ſo much the more. And why ſo, was hee not their brother? Is it ſo tickle to haue a brother rule ouer his brethren? yea ſurelie. So cankred is the nature of many men, that they can better endure to be ſubiect to a Turke, then to their owne fleſh and blood, And as our Sauiour ſaid, No Prophet is eſteemed in his owne Countrey, ſo may it truely be ſaid manie times, A kinſmans gouernment ouer his kinſmen

is enuied and ſpited. But it is no vertue let them vſe it that liſt. They bewray more corruption then all the water in the riuer will waſh off, and of wiſe men they are eſtéemed accordingly. Not much vnlike to theſe brethren of Ioſeph be they that had rather anie man ſhould haue a penie-woorth in what they part withall, then their friend, yea a friend may not haue it for anie thing, when a méere ſtranger ſhall haue it almoſt for nothing. The nature is nought if there be not verie iuſt cauſe of ſuch refuſall, and as dogged as here were Iacobs ſonnes.
            
               
                  Knowledge not obeyed.
               
               5 How readily they interpreted his dreames, yea and how rightly? yet they abhorred to yéeld, to them. So do many with the word of God, they perceiue what he meaneth, God I ſay in his word, and what he requireth, yet no yéelding, no ſubmiſſion, no contentment, but grudge and grieue as much to be ſubiect thereunto, &amp; to ſubmit their necks to the ſceptre thereof as Ioſephs brethren did here to there brother, albeit they geſſed and that truely, what was intended. A feareful ſtubbornnes, and a ſtifneſſe, ſtarting aſide with aſſured danger if it be not reformed. Not to ſée the Lords will is a plague, but to ſée it, and to refuſe to obey it, is death and damnation iuſt for euermore, without repentance.
            
               6 As the fathers fauour here towards his ſonne Ioſeph, was the cauſe why the reſt hated him,
                  Gods fauor to his children, cauſe alſo why they are hated in the worlde of ſome.
                ſo is the gracious fauor that God almightie ſheweth to his children often the cauſe of hatred in others towards them. If God be extraordinarie to Moſes, euen Aaron his brother, and Miriam his ſiſter will be offended: if Dauid be loued, Saul will enuie him) and ſéeke his deſtruction. So in mo, &amp; ſo in too manie if men were not wicked. The lord may not do with his owne as he wil, but our eie is ſtreight euill, if he be good. This is not well in them▪ But to vs let it be no diſcomfort: for their enuie, malice and hatred ſhall hurt vs as theſe mens did Ioſeph, that is, God ſhall turne all to his owne glorie, and our further way vnto ſuch good as in his good pleaſure is determined for vs. Beleeue

this example of Ioſeph, exalted notwithſtanding all their ſpite.
            
               The ſecond part.
               
                  HAuing heard before the hatred growen in the brethren againſt Ioſeph, in this ſecond part of ye chapter we may ſée their execution and practiſe of the ſame againſt him when they had oportunitie. The oportunitie was this.
                     Verſe 18.
                     
                   Their father ſendeth Ioſeph into ye fields to them where they kept their cattel, to ſée how they did. Whom when they ſaw in this ſort come into their hands, ſtreight they conſpired againſt him. Now that the father would ſend him, and that Ioſeph would go, hauing had ſuch notice of their diſliking of his dreames, it plainlie ſheweth the ſimplicitie of the godlie, and ſuch as haue honeſt minds, that they are farre, and often but too farre from ſuſpecting and forecaſting ſuch perils as in déed are towards them, and ſuch euill nature in others as in time ſheweth it ſelfe and burſteth out. It is an old ſaying, &amp; euen here we ſée it true, Vt quis
                        
                           
                        
                        que
                      eſt vir bonus, &amp;c. A man that meaneth truly and honeſtly himſelfe, thinketh all others to meane ſo likewiſe.
                   But it was ſo. Though olde Iacob meane no hurt, neither yet Ioſeph, the other brethren doe, and conſpire his death, when in loue ſent in loue he commeth to ſée howe they did. Though ſimple then it is good to be, yet ouer ſimple beware to be. Inter ſpinas calceatu. Amongeſt thornes haue on thy ſhooes
                   (ſayeth an other prouerbe) and it is worthie practiſe,
               
                  2 Out goeth Ioſeph and thinketh no harme then as I ſaid,
                     Vr. 16.17
                     
                   and he ſéeketh his brethren from place to place,
                     Many ſeeke one thing and finde another.
                   but he findeth blouddie enimies rather then brethren at the laſt. So fareth it dayly with manie a man. Wee ſéeke life, but wee finde death at the Phiſitians hands: Wee ſéeke iuſtice, we finde oppreſſion: wee ſéeke truth, wee finde falſehoode, and in a worde, as Ioſeph here wee ſéeke for brethren but finde farre otherwiſe in the end. So dooth ſecret ſinne couer it ſelfe euen

in the Church militant to this day. But who ſo reputed a brother, becommeth a foe, let him thinke what credite Ioſephs brethren had with God or man for ſuch hypocriſie, and who ſo is halted withall, and deceyued, as Ioſeph was, meaning no woorſe then Ioſeph did, let him turne his face from man, and clap holde of God, ſaying with the Prophet, It is good for me to holde mee faſt by God. to put my truſt in him: and what protection and ſafe garde poore Ioſeph found, when hee was here alone in the middeſt of his, no brethren, but bloudie foes, that comfortablie hope for at the ſame Gods hand, who is one to day, then, and for euer, to all that truelie cleaue to him.
               
                  
                     Gods writings and mans writings.
                  
                  3 But why ſaith Moſes ſo brodelie that they conſpired to ſlay him. This was much to bee laid in writing againſt ſuch men. No not a iote. For it being ſo in déed, the holie ſpirite of God hath taught vs notablie by it, what difference is betwixt man and God.
                     18
                   Man in his writings flattereth, and ſmootheth, and diſſembleth faults, yea often, for vice putteth in vertue, and where in deede a diſpraiſe was due, yet there extolleth to the ſkie. But Gods holie ſpirite in his writings dooth not ſo. He ſpeaketh plainly and euer truely of all degrées, whatſoeuer. Againe it ſheweth that Moſes was not directed by fleſh and bloud: for if he had he would haue couered the blemiſhes, eſpeciallie theſe great blemiſhes of his anceſtours. Thirdlie, it is a rule to direct them to doe it, and it is a warrant to them if they doe it that write ſtories, and commit to writing facts of preſent or former times. Trueth was euer without ſhame, what blame ſoeuer it getteth vnworthilie. But filthie flatterie maketh them liue with ſhame that vſe it during life, and ſhamefullie ſpoken off euen after death.

it the faſhions of the wicked, and the lot of the godlie in this world often. How differ theſe ſpeaches, Behold the dreamer: and Beholde the holy man, the holy woman, the hote goſpeller, &amp;c Surelie both are ſcoffes alike from a prophane heart, which God will viſite with a whipping rodde in his good time. Thus ſcoffed the Captaines and their fifties when they called the Prophet in mockerie, Man of God,

                   See what it is to harbor in our boſoms a diſlike of a man and a hatred, in time it leadeth vs euen to blouddie murther of the partie ſo diſliked, or at the leaſt to a willingnes to do it, if we be by meanes kept from the act. For if a brother breath death agaynſt his brother, becauſe he hateth him: ſurelie men in further degrées from vs will neuer ſtand in our handes. Then ſtoppe betimes if we feare God, and abandon hatred out of our hearts. Let it neuer lie boyling within vs and gather ſtrength. Such Patriarchs ouercome by hatred againſt their brother may teach vs whileſt we liue what hatred is

                   O blinded men, the determined counſaile of God they will ouerthrow, and by their power and practiſe they will preuent what hee will haue come to paſſe. So thought the blinde Phariſies, Prieſts, and Elders, that if they could compaſſe once the death of our Sauiour, all ſhould be well, they ſhould ſtill deceyue the worlde, the Scriptures ſhould bee falle, and whatſoeuer by Chriſt was effected, ſhoulde bee preuented. But was it ſo? or rather did not all their malice woorke to the effecting of Gods purpoſe. Herode by pollicie or crueltie open, will kill the babe Ieſus, and then

all ſhall be well, yea euen to this day fooles will contende agaynſt God and prooue him vntrue. But away betimes with ſuch dreadfull impietie. God will bée true, and his purpoſes ſhall be perfourmed, when all earthlie creatures ſhall be confounded that ſtande agaynſt him, Ioſephs dreames ſhall come to paſſe in deſpite of all ſcorners or vnnaturall practiſers to the contrarie. So let vs thinke, ſo let vs know, ſo let vs liue till life take her leaue, and all bee effected. Our fayth, our cauſe, our profeſſion and religion, ſhall ſtande being the Lordes, though thouſandes of our bodyes bee deſtroyed by raging crueltie, and all is not ſure on our aduerſaries ſide as they ſuppoſe when once they haue preuailed againſt ſome of vs. Bleſſed be God.

                        Neuer giue ſentence vpō any for one fault.
                      &amp;c. What Ruben was this? Surelie euen hee that laie with Bilhah his fathers Concubine, as wée heard in the 35 Chapter. Learne then ſayeth Caluin vpon the place, Non eſſe à peccato vno quantumuu atroci eſtimandos homines vt nobis deſperata ſit eorum ſalus. Not to iudge men peremptorilie vppon one ſinne, though a verie great one, and their eſtate to vs ſeeme verie deſperate.
                   For here wee ſee more vertue, more pietie and feare of God, though before hee had ſo grieuouſly fallen, then in all the reſt. See againe howe God will euer haue one Ruben or another, that is, one meanes or another to deliuer his out of perils and daungers, as euer ſhall ſtande with his bleſſed pleaſure. Let wicked men deuiſe and determine what they will, the Lorde hath a hande ouer all their purpoſes, and they ſhall not preuaile but as hee will. Killed to bée, God will not haue haue his ſeruant, and they can not effect it, but ſolde into Egypt hee will haue him, and therein they preuaile. So it is his will, not theirs: his counſaile, not theirs, that indeede ruleth. The deuiſe that Ruben had to ſaue his life, maie euer bee a warrant to vs to vſe good meanes and lawfull pollicyes to the good of our brethren the children of God, eyther in deliuering them

from blouddie rages of cruell aduerſaries, or otherwiſe. This was pia fallacia, ſaith a learned man, a holie deceit, to a good purpoſe, and we may obſerue it.

                     What we are grudged to haue, we are ſooneſt robbed of.
                   Greatlie they ſpited his partie coloured coate, as wee ſawe before, and what moſt men are ſpited to haue they are firſt robbed of, if their enuying foes preuayle ouer them. What they ſayde to Ioſeph when they thus ſtripped him, or what hee to them when they thus vſed him, is not layde downe. But well wee maie thinke this was dolefull intertainement to his harmleſſe heart, that came in ſuch ſort both readilie and kindelie to ſée howe they did, and to beare to his father what they wanted. Yea queſtionleſſe with wéeping eyes, and aking heart, hee cryed for pittie,
                     See chap. 42 ver. 21. the anguiſh of his ſoule.
                   calling them brethren a name of loue, mercie, and nature, remembring them of God, of nature, of their aged father at home, who had ſent him to them, and of what ſoeuer might mooue compaſſion, but it woulde not ſerue. O Lambe amongeſt Woolues if euer were anie. O Iacob at home, thou ſeeſt not this. Little dreameſt thou thy darling is in this perplexitie amongeſt his brethren. To thée hee ſhall come no more, but his coate for him. Thy ſorrowe is neare and euen at the doore by ſuch cruell children. No God, no brother, no father, no friend is regarded of them. Stonie heartes, and iron bowels are nowe where Nature ſhoulde haue dwelt. See wee then man, if the Lorde touch not, and prepare to endure what GOD ſhall ſende. Pitie or none, fauour or none, feeling or none, his will be done.
               
                  9 Then they ſate them downe 
                        •
                     o eate bread (ſaith the text) Alas they ſhoulde rather haue ſate downe to weepe for their moſte wicked behauiour towardes their innocent brother, then to eate and drinke,
                     The ſinfull ſecuritie of a dead conſcience.
                   but they felt not the ſinne as yet, and thus are mens conſciences to often lulled

a ſleepe through Satans ſubtiltie: an eſtate moſt dangerous and abhorred of God. Such a lethargie was in Dauid, in Ezechias, and others, to their great hurt. Wherefore bleſſed is the man eſtéemed of Salomon that feareth alway,
                     Prou. 28.
                   that is, that hath a feeling ſtill of ſinne, to auoyde it, and hate it, to ſigh and ſorrow for it, as becommeth a man or woman that feareth God. But whileſt thus they were eating, beholde a meanes to deliuer Ioſeph out of the pit, and to ſaue his life. They lift vp their eies and ſaw marchants comming, ſtreight they concluded by the motion of one to ſell Ioſeph to them, and ſo to be rid of him. So fitte can God make meanes fall out to ſerue his prouidence euermore. So came Rebecca ſo came Rachell fitte in their times: ſo can a thouſande knowen experiences full well declare if they be remembred. God hath his tymes, and his opportunities of tymes, to fitte aſſuredlie, and let it be our comfort. Ioſeph then is ſolde and away he goeth. But God had a purpoſe vnknowen to Ioſeph to his great comfort. Had hee knowen it, his ſorrow nothing woulde haue béene ſo great. Let it comfort vs when aduerſe thinges happen, little knowe wee what may inſue.
               
                  
                     The intire affection of parents towards their children.
                  
                  10 Finallie, the ſorrow of Iacob, ſo great and ſo grieuous, ſo long and ſo laſting, refuſing to be comforted whoſoeuer came to him, moſt plainelie and effectuallie expreſſeth a fathers heart towards a childe beloued. Iacob had indured manie great afflictions in his time, yet neuer ranne out as he did in this. Here hee is euen ouercome with griefe, and his paſſions vehement, ſhewe themſelues in a dolefull meaſure. Thus neare lie chldren to their parents hearts. Touch our goodes, or touch our owne bodies, we endure it often with great patience, but touch our children and we are gone: Iob can witneſſe it, if our daylie knowledge wanted proofe. The comming of friends to comfort him in this we full well commendeth vnto vs a kindeneſſe and duetie that is moſt commendable▪ But that his ſonnes woulde ſuffer him thus to ſorrow for their brother that liued, O barbarous

hardneſſe. Their confeſſion of the trueth, though it might verie iuſtlie haue wrought them blame, yet moſt ſwéetelie it woulde haue refreſhed the mourning heart of their aged father. But ſée our nature how it abhorreth truth, if it may ought hurt vs, and how obſtinate Nature ſtandes in a ſinne to face it out, and kéepe it cloſe. Such is our mould, and ſuch is our great corruption. They comfort their father and yet cauſe his wo, much like our Vſurers that ſpeake ſo kinde, and cut ſo déepe into a mans eſtate till he be vndone. O miſerable comforters, and ſo I ende.

               The generall heads are theſe chiefly.

                     The mariage of Iudah, to the 12. verſe.
                     The inceſt, to the 24. verſe.

               TOuching particulars, it is to be obſerued, firſt, how Iudah tooke to wife the daughter of a Cananite, which affinitie by God was vtterly condemned. And the children that hee had by ſuch mariage proſpered not. Euen therefore as it ſhould ſéeme the mariage of the father being mentioned,
                  God plagueth vngodly mariages.
                that we might know how iuſt cauſe there was why God ſhould detract his mercie and grace from the iſſue. Let men then looke vpon this example, and call to remembrance with it their owne experiences. Hath not God euer hated vngodlie matches? Hath not God ſundrie wayes plagued them euen in our dayes? by deniall of iſſue either to ſuch as ſo marrie, or to the next children of ſuch marriage, or by withdrawing his grace from them that

Let neuer then either luſting fleſh, or couetous heart, or anie reſpect vnder heauen, draw vs to the match that is not in the Lord. If ſhe be a Canaanite, or the fauourer of Canaanites vnlawfullie, let her neuer bee ours. And ſo on the womans part.

                  Conſent of parents.
                and whie ſhould this bee mentioned in this ſort, but of purpoſe to ſhew the regard that was had of parents in thoſe daies touching the mariages of their children. A thing that I haue often noted before, and can neuer note too often, ſo bolde is youth in theſe daies to take themſelues, and not to let parents take for them.

                  The end of the wicked to be ſlaine.
                Wicked, I ſay, becauſe it pleaſed not the Lorde to giue his bleſſing to the fruite of a wicked matche, and ſlaine of the Lorde in iuſtice for his wickedneſſe, that all like diſpoſed perſons might ſée in experience what firſt or laſt ſhall befall them for ſuch behauiour.

               4 Then the father willed his ſecond ſonne Onan to take his brothers wife,
               
                  An enuious mind, hated of the Lord.
                
               and to rayſe vp ſeede to his brother. A thing that after was made a lawe, as wee reade Deuter. 25.5. But what did the wicked man (for euen this ſame alſo was a wicked man that an vnlawfull mariage of the father might fullie bee puniſhed) I ſay what did he. Curſedlie and ſinfullie he ſpilled his ſéede vpon the ground. Wherefore the Lorde alſo ſlue him. Behold in this man the malicious ſpitefull and enuious nature of manie a man and woman in the worlde, who rather make choiſe to hurt themſelues, then to pleaſure another. They crie as the woman did to Salomon, Neither to me nor to her, but deuide it. But let

theſe natures beware, leſt god deale with them as he did here with Onan whom in his fierce wrath he ſlue for ſuch enuying. And concerning the fact of Onan thinke no better of it, then you do that a woman ſhould deſtroy her fruitfulneſſe, for this in man is euen that ſinne: an vglie, fowle, and filthie wickednes. Manie men are not of Onans minde, who are too ſoone intreated to raiſe vp ſeede to other men: yet I know the difference, but thus much by the way.
            
               5 Iudah had yet a third ſonne, but he was young,
               
                  Verſe 11.
                  
                
               and ſeeing both his other ſonnes thus dead, hee was afrayed to giue him to Thamar his daughter in lawe, leaſt hee ſhould alſo die as his brethren did. Wholie imputing the cauſe of his ſonnes death, not to their owne ſinfull wickedneſſe,
                  We blame readily the vnworthie of blame.
                as indeed hee ſhould, but to his daughter in lawe, nothing guiltie of the ſame. Therein teaching vs two things. Firſt howe readie it is with partiall man to blame others not blame worthie, rather then to lay the fault where in déede it ought. Secondlie, that when anie croſſe befalleth our familie, wee ſhoulde euer enter into conſidertion of ſinne, and ſearche carefullie what hath béene committed to prouoke the Lorde in ſuch ſort agaynſt vs.
                  Seeke ſin in our ſelues.
                The former he teacheth vs here by his dooing, the latter by his not dooing. Iudah I meane the father of theſe children. The father in maryage with a Canaanite, and the children otherwiſe grieuouſlie ſinned, and yet poſte it ouer to the poore woman, as though ſhee were cauſe of all. Dauid ſayde well, and hath lefte vs a good preſident when hee cryed in vnfainedneſſe, It is I Lorde, it is I that haue ſinned, and done euill, theſe ſillie ſheepe haue done nothing:
               
                  2. Sam. 24.
                
               let thy rodde bee agaynſt mee, &amp;c. to the like effect. Thus did not Iudah here.
            
               6 Then ſhee put off her widowes apparell (ſayeth the text.
                  Verſe 14.
                  
                
               
                  A kinde of mourning apparell.
               ) Therby inſtructing vs that euen in thoſe daies widows did vſe ſome graue, ſadde and ſober apparell, whereby they were knowen to bee widowes, and to carrie in minde their

loſſe and lacke of their huſbands. What it was we know not certainlie, neither if we did is it neceſſarie that all countries and perſons in ſuch outwarde and indifferent things ſhould be a like. Let it thus farre profite vs that wee may vſe ſome graue forme according to the manner of the place where we liue, and we ought not to iudge thoſe that do it.
            
               7 She couered herſelfe with a vaile, a thing that in my opinion maketh nothing againſt the vſe of women in ſome places after childbirth.
                  Womens vayles.
                For honeſtlie it may of an honeſt woman be vſed, that immodeſtlie of naughtie ones is abuſed. And ſo in men. Much more might the vaile that Rebecca caſt ouer her be vſed to approue that faſhion, then this can anie way be vrged to improoue it. But moſt plainlie this fact of Thamar teacheth, that wicked women in thoſe daies were not altogither ſo paſt ſhame, either had the Deuill taken ſuch full poſſeſſion of them, as nowe in ours hee hath of ſuch like. For then they ſinned with couered faces, as hauing ſome ſhame: but nowe with open faces as paſt all ſhame. Then ſuch behauiour ſhewed ſome féeling of it, that it was not well, but nowe bolde and bare faces, nothing bluſhing to committe ſuch ſinne, ſhewe plainelie to all men wee haue no more féeling then wee haue vayles, no more conſcience then wee haue ſhame, and that is iuſt of neyther anie iote at all. O fearefull boldeneſſe in ſo badde a cauſe, whither will it carrie vs if we take not héede.
            
               8 The reaſon is alledged, whie Thamar thus wickedlie proſtituted her ſelfe to her father in lawe.
                  The poiſon of diſcontent.
                To wit becauſe ſhee ſawe that Shelah the thirde ſonne of Iudah was growen vp,
                  Verſe 14.
                  
                and yet ſhe not giuen to him to wife, according to promiſe. Alas, and ſhall another mans fault make me offend? If Iudah breake promiſe, will Thamar forgoe pietie? Surelie this is euen the poyſon of diſcontent. It boyleth, it breweth with man and woman ſore and neuer ceaſeth vrging to ſome reuenge. Yea heere it preuayleth with her

euen to ſhame her ſelfe and to ſinne damnablie rather then not to be reuenged vpon her father in law. Diſcontent made Iudas to betray his maiſter: diſcontent made Haman ſet vp the gallowes that by Gods iuſtice ſerued himſelfe. Diſcontent made Demas forſake Paul, and imbrace the world. And what deadlie ſinne hath not diſcontent made ſéeme as reaſonable, equall and iuſt. O treaſons and treacheries againſt Chriſtian kings and gouernours, O but cherlie bloudineſſe and bloudie maſſacres that diſcontent hath greedilie drawen vnto men, otherwiſe qualified with manie gifts. Beware we then euer of diſcontent, and ſnubbe it betimes, leaſt it ouerthrow vs as it hath done manie, and here did Thamar. And if we haue anie cauſe of iuſt offence, let it neuer draw vs to vniuſt reuenge. If Iudah breake promiſe with vs, let not vs offend, God ſéeth our wrong, and God will puniſh our wrong, if we commit it to him in godlie patience. But if to puniſh ſinne we alſo will ſinne, as we looſe the benefite of Gods regard of the wrong done vs: ſo ſhall wee ſurelie taſte of his rod our ſelues for ſo offending.
            
               9 The text ſaith againe that he knew her not. Yet he talked with her and ſhe with him largelie,

                how then might it bee that he knew her not, ſhe hauing beene the wife of his ſonnes and long in his companie? Verelie God angrie with his lewd diſpoſition, had blinded him ſo that hee knew her not. And ſhall it not ſhew vs the wrath of the Lord againſt filthie concepts. If thou loueſt ſinne and wilt ſtrain thy conſcience to drinke of that cuppe, take héede leaſt in iudgement the Lord take knowledge and feeling from thée, that thou no more diſcerneſt ſinne to be ſinne, as it is, then Iudah knew Thamar to be his daughter in law, as ſhe was.
            
               10 The match being made for her ſinfull hire, and the ſin committed by her ſinfull father, the text ſaith,

                  Cole-cariers betwixt offenders.
                Such Cole-cariers the worlde is too full of, and I would their occupation were writ in their foreheads, then would there be leſſe wickedneſſe

wrought then is by much. The vertue of man or woman hath no ſuch enemie vnder heauen as theſe cariers be.

                They bring, and they ſpeake, yea they ſweare, and fowlie forſweare to worke a ſhame. What ſender cannot, theſe cariers can haue time and place to diſcourſe at full. They lie, they cogge, they face and flatter, till harmeleſſe heart rereceyue their venome. O brokers of Sathan, for ſinne and wickedneſſe what will be your ende?
                  True friendſhip is vſque ad aras, and no further.
                If the ſinner ſinning by your procurement bee damned and die, what meaſure of confuſion is due to you that haue brought it about? Spit we then euer with deſtance heartie vpon ſuch Adullamites as this was.

So ſhewing plainly what wee finde too true more in our eies to bee the ſhame of the world then the feare of God. But it is a wrong courſe if God gaue eyes: for he aboue all is to be feared and regarded, that is able not to ſhame onelie, but to kill both bodie and ſoule, and to caſt into hell fire, &amp;c.

               12 In time this whoredome draweth to light: for Thamar being with childe after thrée moneths made open ſhew, and the newes of it is brought to her father in lawe, who by and by ſtoutlie as if he had beene the honeſteſt man aliue giueth iuſtlie ſentence that ſhee ſhould be burnt. Shewing as it is thought, that euen by the lawe of nature written in mans heart, whordome ſhould be puniſhed by death, before euer the lawe written was giuen. When ſhe was brought forth to the ende to ſuffer, ſhee ſent vnto her father in law his tokens left with her when ſhe offended. Which by and by knowing, he changed his ſentence abſolued her, and condemned himſelfe, ſaying: She is more righteous then I for ſhe hath done this becauſe I gaue her not to Shelah my ſonne. So haſtie ſentence was ſoone repealed, and the caſe being altered he is

not ſo haſtie as he was. Such Iudges and iudgements haue béene ſéene, but the leſſe the better. Sinne will be ſinne whatſoeuer we doe, and God will aſſuredlie puniſh ſinne whatſoeuer we doe. Circumſtances may alter ſinne from more to leſſe, or backe againe, but circumſtance neuer can make ſinne no ſinne, and vnworthie blame. She had cauſe to complaine of wrong done her by her father in lawe, not giuing her a wife to his ſonne, but that therefore with her father in law ſhe ſhould commit inceſt, it cannot be iuſtified: but inough before of this matter. That it followeth ſtreight, He lay with her no more, it was ſome grace and token of repentance. Such as if offenders would euer ſhewe, no doubt but mercie might be found for paſſed frailtie. Regard this therefore, and obſerue it well, Iudah ſinned but he ſinned no more, &amp;c.
            Laſt of all, when the time of deliuerance came,
                  A comfort to women with childe in their trauaile.
                her trauaile was hard, yea ſo hard as it is not conuenient fullie to vtter, yet all was well in the end, both mother and twinnes too were in ſafetie. The vſe of it to women to truſt in God who is mightie, and almightie, good, and all goodneſſe, to regarde his faithfull ſeruants euer in this buſines. Let them not feare, but cleaue faſt to his gracious fauour, the rather if before they haue prooued his mercie. For though it be a fault for anie to doubt, yet it is a double fault for one that hath tried, to doe it. Neither Gods mercie nor might wax weaker with time, but he is for euer, what euer he was, and if you beléeue it, as here did Thamar receyue a good ende, ſo ſhall you. Firſt one, then another, and if there had béene mo, the Lord ſtill all one according to his pleaſure. And this of this Chappter.

               2 The Lord was with Ioſeph (ſaith the text) and he was a man that proſpered. Giuing vs to learne therein verie notablie, that the fauour of God is the true fountaine of all proſperitie. He riſeth whom God loueth, if ſo it be good, and without him no man riſeth though they burſt their hearts. Yet is not proſperitie a token euer of Gods loue, though no proſperitie come but from Gods will. But here we are tolde in this perticular,
                  Ver. 3.4.
                  
                that Ioſeph proſpered, becauſe God was with him. Which when his maiſter ſaw, he alſo fauoured him, and made him ruler of his houſe, putting all that he had vnder his hand, making by that meanes good Ioſephs pietie ſerue for his profite, but not caring for the ſame to learne it himſelfe. A daylie trick of earthlie minded men. Yet God is good to his ſeruant ſtill,
                  Verſe 5.
                  
                and bleſſeth euen the Egyptians houſe for his ſake. So

gainfull is godlines but in ſeruants. What ſhould it be in our ſelues if we alſo were right hearted with them. Should God forget to be good to ſuch a familie? no, no, he would bleſſe it certainlie verie graciouſly.
            
               3 Then did his maiſter much more truſt him,
                  Verſ 6.
                  
                taking no account of any thing that was in his houſe.
                  Partiall affection to our owne Countrimē.
                A vertue in ſome ſort, and a teſtimonie of good nature in his maſter. For there be ſome that are ſo partiallie wedded to their owne Countryfolke, and ſo doggedlie hearted towards any ſtrangers, that rather they had endure the doltiſhnes of the former, then vſe the dexteritie of the latter. So was not Potiphar. But ſéeing gods graces in a ſtranger, euen there alſo he yéeldeth fauour, and vſeth him fullie according to the ſame.
            
               4 His perſon is commended, that he was faire and well fauoured. A grace if God giue it not to be diſpiſed,
                  Beauti
                        •
                      a ſnare, &amp; our eies windowes to ſinne.
                for it maketh lightlie whatſoeuer we do to be better liked, according to the old ſaying: Gratior eſt pulchro veniens è corpore virtus. Vertue in a comely perſonage is more eſteemed.
                But ſée the malice of Sathan: though hee could not make Ioſeph abuſe this beautie, either to pride or otherwiſe, yet he tempteth Potiphars wife by it, and with it,
                  Verſe 7.
                  
                for it is ſaid ſhee caſt her eyes vpon him, and ſaid, Lie with mee. So that we ſee our verie ſenſes ſucke in our bane, if the Lord aſſiſt not, &amp; the eies eſpeciallie. In this booke before, it was ſaid, that the ſonnes of God ſaw the daughters of men that they were faire,
                  Gen. 6.2.
                and tooke them wiues. Dauid ſaw from the top of his pallace Beerſeba, and by ſight ſinned in meaſure ſtreight, and ſoone after more. Peter ſpeaketh of eies full of adulterie. Iob made a couenant with his eies yt they ſhould not offend in this reſpect.
                  2 Pet. 2. Iob 31.
                All theſe places teaching what windowes for wickednes to enter in at our ſenſes be, if God giue not grace. Well praied Dauid therfore, that the Lord would turne away his eies, leſt they ſhould behold vanitie. A carefull conſcience preuenteth much, and a careleſſe perſon is ſoone deceiued. Beware we by this wanton miſtreſſe of Ioſephs, if we feare God.
            
               
               5 Ioſeph abhorred ſuch impietie, and with moſt good and godly arguments repelleth the temptation.
                  Verſe 7.
                  
                The firſt drawen from ingratitude &amp; vnfaithfulnes in theſe words,
                  An honeſt nature, the more truſted, ye more faithful.
                
               Behold my maiſter knoweth not what he hath in the houſe with me, but hath committed all that he hath to my hand. There is no man greater in his houſe then I, neither hath he kept any thing frō me but only thee,
               
                  Verſe 8.
                  
                
               &amp;c. as if he ſhould haue ſaid, being truſted as I am, and preferred in my maiſters houſe as I am, it were ye greateſt vnfaithfulnes, &amp; the fouleſt ingratitude that might be, in this ſort to requite my maſters fauours, and ſo great fauours towards me. Therefore I may not do it▪ for I abhorre to be vnfaithfull where I am truſted, or vnthankfull where I am regarded and done for. Here then is a ſeruant of ſeruants, if we thinke of our daies, here is a iewell more worth then gold, and a pearle of price for a mans houſe. Faithfull and thankfull what wiſh we more. By theſe two vertues as it were, by two b
                  •
               nds vpon his ſoule kept from ſuch villany towards his maſter as is contrarie quite vnto them both. Liue Ioſeph, liue, though long thou art dead, for this thy grace, and liue not with God alone in his ſhining light, but in the mouths of men till the world haue end, to thy praiſe and honor moſt iuſtly deſerued, who taſt of grace wil folow thée, &amp; who offered thus, prefer their luſt, in iudging day ſhall be condemned by thée.
            
               
                  The ſecond argument.
               His ſecond argument is drawen from that mariage knot that ought to hold till death doth part. Thou art (ſaith hee) his wife, as if he ſhould haue ſaid, Such truth ſhould be in thée towards thy wedded huſband, euen becauſe thou art his wife, that if I would thou ſhouldeſt defie me, and againe ſuch ſtop to me is made by this eſtate in thee, that if we both would, yet we ought not. A maried woman muſt haue a maried minde, that as her bodie by orderlie courſe is appropriated vnto one, ſo her mind muſt be alſo to the ſame, and to none other. Being then his wife, and ſo proper vnto him, I may not conſent to abuſe this knot that God and grace would be inuiolate.
            
               
                  The third argument.
               His third argument is drawen from the nature of the ſinne it is a great wickedneſſe to touch an other mans wife: and as all wickednes ſhould be abhorred: ſo great wickednes greatlie

abhorred. A true iudgement in Ioſeph, and would God we might euer retaine it in our ſelues. The world maketh but a ieaſt of it, and at it,
                  Gen. 20.9.
                being herein behind the verie infidels and heathens, of whom many haue confeſſed and hated as Ioſeph doth. But with theſe mockers and fleſhly wretches the Lord ſhall not mocke in his due time, when that ſhalbe fulfilled in the 13. to the Heb. Mariage is honorable amongſt all men, but whoremongers and adulterers the Lord ſhall iudge.
               
                  Heb. 13.2.
               
            
            His laſt argument is drawen from the loue of God.
                  The fourth argument.
                
               Thus ſhould I ſinne (ſaith he) againſt God, which how may I do? As if he ſhould haue ſaid, I loue God who hath euer loued me, and my loue admitteth no ſuch requitall. Many and many are the ſweet mercies that I haue found at his hand, if I ſhould tell all, and how then ſhould I ſinne againſt him? Therefore ſince truſted I am and may not be vnfaithfull, ſince regarded I am aboue all in the houſe, and may not be vnthankfull, ſince thou art a mans wife, and by that knot bound to abhorre all others in ſuch reſpects, ſince the ſin is great, and therefore with great care to be auoided, and ſince I loue the lord for his loue to me, which abhorreth ſuch requitall, I muſt ſay nay, and thou muſt not ſay yea, God muſt be feared, and theſe reaſons regarded, ſinne muſt be hated and vertue preſerued in vs both. O vertue bright in a holy child of God: to ſpeake of it were to ſay leſſe then the thing deſerueth, and therefore honouring both it and him that had it, God giue vs grace euer to follow it.
            
               6 It followeth in the text that ſhe ſpake to Ioſeph day by day, and yet he refuſed.
                  Verſe 10.
                  
                Where not onelie marke her moſt vgglie vnſhamefaſtneſſe, that hauing receyued ſuch anſwer,
                  Satan tempteth againe and againe, to the ſame thing.
                would yet ſolicite: but ſée alſo plainlie, and obſerue it carefullie, how Sathan ceaſeth not to aſſaie vs againe and againe with the ſame temptation, hoping in time to win our conſent vnto the ſame, and to giue vs the foile at the ſecond or third aſſault, though ſtifly we ſtand &amp; reſiſt the firſt. Therfore once or twice hauing well fought againſt filthie aſſaults, yet be not ſecure by and by, but euen recken of your enemie yet againe, and prepare like anſwere to the ende. Ioſeph as hartily

and zealouſly as euer any did repelled the baite that Satan laid for him in his miſtreſſe, yet he giueth not ouer but ſtill worketh in his inſtrument to attempt him againe, yet doe what both he and his inſtrument could, Ioſeph ſtoode faſt in his holy purpoſe,
                  Companie to be auoyded.
                and ſaid her nay. Yea marke it with me and forget it neuer, what the text ſaith, that when he ſaw her wickedneſſe, he not onely auoided her filthie deſire, but euen her dangerous and vncleane companie. Thereby moſt notablie inſtructing all men, that if they will not burne, they may not put their fingers in the flame: that is, if they will not be euill, they may not ſtill and daylie be in euill companie.
                  Prou. 13. Syrac. 13. Pſal. 18.
                For companie cauſeth in continuance, what is not clawed off in anie continuance. Let Salomon teach vs, and manie moe. Peter in bad companie denied his Lorde, the ſkarre whereof in remembrance liueth yet. Lot in the companie of his luſting daughters is ouerreached, and committeth inceſt. Beware the woman that is vnſhamefaſt,
                  Pro. 7 from the 6. ver. to the end.
                if ſhe ſtill may haue place to continue her aſſaults. Read the ſeuenth of the Prouerbs, and marke it well, at laſt ſhe preuailed, and led him home as an Oxe that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a foole to the ſtockes for correction.
            
               7 Then on a time Ioſeph entred into the houſe to do his buſines,
                     Ver. 11.12.
                     
                   
                  
                     Impudency
                   and there was no man in the houſe. Therfore ſhe caught him by the garment, &amp;c. O ſtrange impudencie &amp; more foule and filthie then that I can ſpeake of it. Marke it &amp; hate it, lothe it and deteſt it with a perfect hatred, for ſo it deſerueth. And let it teach vs this,
                  Fulgent. epiſt. 4. ad Prob. pag. 532. de orat. &amp; compunct.
                euen to daſh the bones of filthie cōceits at the firſt whileſt they be yong. For if we harbor &amp; hatch them vp ſtil in our boſoms, their ſtrength wil be ſuch in ſhort time, that we ſhall euen with impudent faces, as here did ſhe, indeuour the accompliſhing of them to our ſhame. Qui ſemel verecundiae limites. &amp;c. Who once hath paſſed the bounds of modeſtie
                (could the heathen man ſay) he will euen ſtraight and in verie ſhort ſpace become paſſing impudent if he take not heed. Againe obſerue it diligently, how when Ioſeph is about his worke and thinketh not any thing of ſuch matters Satan aſſaulteth him

and would ouerthrow him. Beware therefore euer and be armed euer, euen in thy worke Satan will be buſie, and not let thée alone, in thy ſtudie, in thy houſe, in the fielde, and at thy plow make readie for Satan, and thinke it not ſtrange if euen here alſo thou féele his temptations. He goeth about continually ſeeking whom he may deuour. Laſt of all, in the woman obſerue it alſo, that there was none in the houſe,
                  Solitarines to be auoyded,
                and then ſhe is boldeſt of all, and bolder then euer ſhe was. So is Sathan helped, and wickednes ſtrengthned by ſolitarines and want of companie. Therfore though euill companie be euer dangerous, yet ſome companie with vs, or néere vs is much profitable. We ſee this example, and we remember alſo when Satan tempted our ſauiour himſelfe, euen when in the wildernes he was alone. Thinking ſolitarines an aduantage euen againſt Chriſt, much more agaynſt vs, and therefore to be auoyded as we may.
            
               8 This filthie woman hauing receiued a foile,
                  Verſe 13. to the end.
                when in this her ſo impudent an aſſault alſo (for Ioſeph ſtoode vertuous ſtill to the end) ſée her deuiſe. She hauing his garment which in his zealous indignation againſt her monſtrous behauiour flinging away from her, he left behind him, ſhe maketh that a meanes to couler her filthineſſe, and to accuſe Ioſeph, as you ſée in the text Therby teaching vs that where incontinence is,
                  Where incontinencie is many vices are.
                there are many vices. Impudencie, ſubtletie, ſlander &amp; treacherie, and what not? Againe teaching vs that filthie loue denied, her luſt turneth to hatred &amp; deadly hatred, not caring to worke the deſtruction of the denier. So did ſhe. Since ſhe can not haue Ioſeph as ſhe deſired, ſhe will deſtroy him if ſhe can as he deſerued not: who would think ſhe could find in her hart ſo to iniurie him whom euen now ſhe ſo affected? But thus it is, and therefore thinke we of Mantuans verſe if wee liſt, aut te ardenter amat, aut te capitaliter odit. Either ſhe loues thee hartily, or hates thee deadly:
                the mean is not found of many women.
            
               9 Not only ſhe accuſeth him to her ſeruants, which was too much, but to her huſband when he commeth home, which farre

was more:
                  Credulitie a great fault.
                ſo malice worketh in madde mindes, from worſe to worſe. Her fooliſh huſband hauing heard his wife, beleeueth all, and condemneth Ioſeph, neuer rewarding his faithfull ſeruice with due examination of the truth. A fault too common with greateſt perſons, yet a blot too blacke for ſuch eſtates. Ioſephs whole courſe had giuen occaſion of better conſcience, and ſhall all be forgotten? Shall the trueſt ſeruant and faithfulleſt heart in all that houſe lie preſentlie as open to the dart of ſlaunder as he that was neuer ſuch? What wiſdome is this, what honour is this, what conſcience is this? Dauid ſo credulous, or rather iniurious to true Mephiboſheth, whom flattering Siba falſelie accuſed, is chaulked out in no worſe chronicle then gods booke for an vnwiſe man to ſay no more. So euer were they that would meaſure true hearts no better meaſure then this. Scite &amp; ſapienter Epicharmus: Memēto diffidere, Sharply therefore and wiſely ſaid Epicharmus, Remember to be ſlow of beliefe.
                And another againe: Nerum eſt ſapientiae non temere credere.
               
                  Cicero.
                
               It is the verie ſinew of wiſedome not haſtily or raſhly to giue credite. But this is not obſerued or remembred here. All is beléeued againſt good Ioſeph, and as a man moſt guiltie to priſon he goeth. Behold ye ſeruants and be of good comfort.
                  A comfort to ſeruants.
                Not euer to be eſtéemed and delt withall according to deſert, is but the lot of a childe of God, and one that is worthie all loue and good liking, though it be not giuen him. Then paſſe it ouer as you may the wrong that ſo wringeth, god is in heauen, and in time Ioſeph ſhall out of priſon with honor againe. Such ſnubs as theſe be little cloudes, that when God hath exerciſed vs, with his ſunne of righteouſnes, he wil diſperſe and cauſe to vaniſh. But whither goeth Ioſeph to priſon in this diſpleaſure?
                  Verſe 20.
                  
                Surely ſaith ye text: to the place where the kings priſoners lay bound. O mightie prouidence of almightie God, &amp; ſweet ſweet to be obſerued. You know what after in this ſtorie fell out, when Ioſeph expounded ye baker and butlers dreames, and how by that meanes after Ioſeph was remembred as able to interprete the kings dreames &amp; ſo deliuered. This could not haue bene, if he had béene in any priſon elſe, &amp; therfore here God would haue him, as hauing determined both his deliuerie,

and the meanes. Care away then with the Lords elect. For if they go to priſon their God gouernes, and euen the place, their end is appointed in his wiſdome, and it ſhall not ſaile.
            
               10 And the Lord was with Ioſeph, ſhewing him mercy and getting him fauour with the maiſter of the priſon. &amp;c.
               
                  Verſe 21. &amp; to the end.
                To priſon he goeth, but yet to that priſon that God appointeth as a place fitteſt to his ſeruants future &amp; intended good,
                  Euen the priſon is directed by God.
                and there euen there the Lord is with him, not ceaſing to work his comfort as might bee good. In his former maiſters houſe hee wrought his fauour whileſt it pleaſed him, and now in this mans houſe when that is gone he dooth the like. So ſafe is hee euer that feareth the Lord. And ſhall he not want fauour with men neceſſarie that cleaueth to God, and defieth ſinne. Locked doores cannot lock God from vs, and that is comfort. Manie things mo might here be noted if I would be long: as that ſo long a man ſtandeth liked and regarded in place of ſeruice as God thinketh good,
                  Note theſe.
                who hath further to vſe and diſpoſe of that man. That diſgrace and diſlike by God are directed not to hurt, but euen further to preferre his faithfull ſeruants that euer ſo liued that they well deſerued fauour ſtill, though they had it not. That before a riſing goeth an humbling, as here in Ioſeph, that thankfulneſſe may be more, and experience of affliction in others, with manie ſuch, but I will not ſtand anie longer now: onelie this let vs note and ende, that the higheſt ſeruices be not the ſafeſt ſeruices for an honeſt minde.
                  A courtiers life.
                No temptations to do euill, more diſgrace when there is no euill then meaner places can aford. Yet euerie man would be climing, and pitch we do too often our deſires there, from whence we ſhall ſucke the ſowreſt ſorrow that euer wee taſted of in our liues. If Ioſephs eſtate be thus tickle, hauing ſuch vertue, and ſuch gifts: Mediocra firma, meane things be beſt things and ſureſt to continue, ſing we euer, and thinke we euer. And ſo I ende.
         
         
            
            Chap. 40,
            
                The heades in this Chapter are chiefly theſe.

                     The impriſonment of the kings chiefe butler and baker.
                     Their dreames which they had in the priſon.
                     The interpretation of the ſame by Ioſeph.
                     The effect and truth according to his interpretation.

               TOuching the firſt it is ſaid: Pharao was angry with his officers.
                     Great mens anger.
                   &amp;c. Greater men are ſooner angrie, and with more danger farre by reaſon of their power: but princes angers aboue all others are eſpecially dangerous and to bee auoided.
                  Pro. 19.12.
                
               For the kings wrath (ſaith the wiſe Salomon) is like the roring of a lion, and his fauour againe like the dewe dropping vppon the graſſe:
               
                  Chap. 16.14.
                
               yea the wrath of a king is as meſſengers of death, but a wiſe man wil pacifie it in another place. This anger of his caſt them into priſon, &amp; their impriſonment againe teacheth what I ended the former chapter withall, to witte, how dangerous high ſeruices be in compariſon of meaner places, euen to men of all conditions. The meaneſt places are often meaneſt to worke great extremities vnto men. Theſe priſoners are put in the place where Ioſeph was, and how this doth worke a deliuerance with honour vnto Ioſeph the ſequele ſheweth. So guideth Gods goodnes his childrens affaires to their good. Ioſeph alſo hath the ouerſight of them, that ſtill we might ſée how God was with him and got him fauour, though wicked miſtres, and too credulous maiſter did ſéeke his wo.
            
               
                  Of dreames
               
               2 Theſe two priſoners dreamed (ſaith the text) either of them a dreame in one night. And it might occaſion vs to thinke of

the cauſes of dreames, and matter belonging thereunto, if I would be long. As that dreames flow from ouerruling humors in mans bodie, wherby it falleth out that ſanguine conſtitutions dreame of merrie &amp; comfortable matter of loue and lightnes alſo, with ſuch like: cholericke, of wars, braules &amp; contentions, and of fire and ſuch like: Flegmatike, of water, wind and ſuch like, Melancholike, of heauie, dolefull, &amp; ſad matters, of death and dead folks, with ſuch like. So that Phiſitions obſerue our dreames verie vſually, as no ſmall helpe to diſcern what humor ruleth and troubleth vs moſt. Galen and Boetius write much of it, &amp; vſed it ſtill to their patients. Somtimes of actions and déeds done by vs the day before, according to the ſaying:

                  Omnia quae ſenſu voluuntur vota diurno,
                  Pect ore ſopito reddit amica quies,
                  Iudicibus lites, auriga ſomnia currus.
               
Sometimes of feare, according to the ſaying alſo:

                  Somnia fallaci ludunt temeraria nocte.
                  Et pauidas mentes falſa timere iubent.
               
            
            Theſe are naturall dreames, and proceede commonlie from their cauſes therein. Beſide which there are dreames ſpiritual and dreames diabolicall. Dreames ſpirituall haue euer ſome, certaine notes wherby they are knowen and diſcerned, &amp; either of the partie or of ſome others haue their true and certaine interpretations. Dreames diabolicall, are illuſions wherwith ſatan vexeth his owne eſpecially, as witches, ſorcerers, and ſuch like. Theſe dreames of the butler and baker might well be naturall being ſo touching their proper functions, and yet ſpirituall in this reſpect, that God vſing proper cauſes, had a ſpeciall drift in cauſing them, that Ioſeph might haue paſſage to the kings knowledg, and ſo to ſuch honour as after followed. Thinke of them as you will, ſure and certaine the Lordes finger was in them, and with Ioſeph to interprete them to them. So all things worke as the Lorde hath appoynted, and by one meanes or other his mercie to his children ſhall be effected.
            
               
               3 Hauing dreamed theſe dreames in the morning, when Ioſeph came in to them, they both were ſad and looked heauilie.
                  Verſe. 7.
                  
                
               
                  A good nature ſoone ſpieth others griefe &amp; comforteth them.
                
               Ioſeph ſpied it by and by, and ſaid vnto them, Why looke ye ſo ſadly to day? Thereby declaring the goodneſſe of his nature, and the fruit of affliction in himſelfe: Vincula qui ſenſit didicit ſuccurrere vinctis. He that hath bene bound himſelfe, knoweth the better what belongeth to bands.
                Neither had he an eie more to ſee, then a heart to pitie and to inquire what might be the cauſe, readie no doubt to do them the good that anie way he was able. Such vertue is commendable with God and man, when ſowre and ſterne diſpoſitions get no ſuch prayſe. A comfortable word to a heauie heart God knoweth is ſwéete, and too much we thinke we can neuer doe for ſo good a nature. They told him readily their griefe what it was, not thinking (as it ſéemeth) that he could expounde them. But Ioſeph a man inſtructed aright, anſwered againe: are not interpretations of God? As if he ſhould ſay, Can not God ſtirre vp in this your content: therefore be not ſad, but tell your dreames vnto me.
                  No certaine rules of expounding dreames. Somnia ne cures, nam mens humana quod op

                Which ſtreight they did, and receyued a true and certaine interpretation of them at his hands. But if here hence we conclude, that with vs alſo our common dreames are to be expounded, we ſhal fowlie erre, and who ſo haue done, haue made themſelues ſpectacles of follie to manie, and ſhewed no little impietie in themſelues, both in ſpeaking and printing: for there is no rule that can holde as certaine in things ſo variable as dreames bee. As for example, that euer when wee dreame of ſuch a beaſt, of ſuch a matter, or in ſuch a maner, it ſhould ſignifie the ſame thing at all times, whereof vnwiſelie ſome haue written too much. But of dreames elſewhere I haue ſayde more.
            
               4 Ioſeph hauing tolde the chiefe butler his dreame, which ſhowed his deliuerance verie ſhortly, and reſtitution to his office againe with credite, beggeth of him but this requitall, that he would ſhew mercie to a priſoner alſo as himſelfe then was, and to make mencion of him to the king that he might be deliuered. Teaching vs therein not to neglect meanes

whenſoeuer we néede, but to vſe them carefullie, referring all effect to God. The baker ſéeing his fellows dreame ſo good, telleth vnto Ioſeph his alſo. But alas the difference. Yet Ioſeph is true, and telleth him truely what it was, though it were ſo bitter. Teaching vs well that truth is to bee preſerued howſoeuer the matter is,
                  Sharpe truths muſt be told.
                and euen hard and ſowre truths to bee tolde if we bee required. Conferre herewithall for proofe and practiſe but theſe Scriptures. 2. Sam. 12. the 7. verſe. 1, King. 22.17. verſe. 2. King. 20.1. and 17. Miche. 2.11. verſe. Matth. 3.7. and Chap. 14.7. Galat. 1.10. with ſuch like. Beware we then miniſters how we conceale what the Lord reuealeth to vs.
            
               5 What is ſpoken here of Pharaohs birth-day, and in Matth. 14. of Herods birth-day,
                  Birth daies.
                ſheweth vs the antiquitie and lawfulneſſe alſo of this obſeruance if it be in meaſure. Birthdaies and mariage-daies, maie bee obſerued, if wee kéepe a courſe frée from vanitie and ſuperſtition. That Pharaoh deliuereth them both out of priſon, one to life, and the other to death, ſome haue made it a figure of Gods laſt iudgement when the like ſhall be done. But I ſtand not of it. This onely I will note and now ende.
                  Vnthankefulneſſe.
                How the butler releaſed forgot Ioſeph, a note of diſgrace to him iuſtly, and to all others that in proſperitie forget their comforters in aduerſitie. To manie, to manie hath this worlde daylie that exalted to honour, to riches and comforts, forget Ioſeph, that is, ſuch perſons as are godlie and faithfull, worthie of comfort, and yet oppreſſed by ſome ſtraunge Putiphars, who earſt haue béene of their great acquaintance.

                In this Chapter we haue theſe things eſpecialle to be obſerued as chiefe heades.

                     The dreames of Pharaoh the king.
                     The deliuerance of Ioſeph out of priſon.
                     His gouernment in the land when he was preferred.
                  
               
            
            
               
                  The company of the godly profitable to the wicked.
               
               TOuching the firſt, we ſée Pharaoh here by dreame admoniſhed of a great dearth that ſhould inſue in his land, &amp; was this think you for Pharaohs ſake? no indéed not principally &amp; eſpecially, but it was for Ioſephs ſake, yt he might be releaſed and preferred, and for Iacob his old fathers ſake, with all his familie, who were by this prouidence comforted &amp; prouided for, and brought into Egypt there to remaine an appointed time, according as was ſaid to Abraham. Sée therfore againe and againe, what profite ſtill comes to the wicked by the godly. For their ſakes they haue mercie, and manifold mercies, as here had Pharaoh and all his land, when otherwiſe the famine had deuoured moſt of them, as well wee may ſee if it had not béene told to Ioſeph by God, and he directed with wiſdome to prouide for it. The king hath two dreames, but all to one end, the doubling being onely for more certaintie and more plainneſſe. Whereby the miniſters of the worde may learne of the Lord in matters of weight that ought to be knowen, euen twice to ſpeake the ſame thing,
                  Preachers to repeate the ſame thing good.
                and oftner alſo if it be néedfull. For this is ſure, this is plaine, and this is euen the pactiſe of the Lord himſelfe. Fooliſh curioſitie auoydeth this, and vaineglorie ſuffereth vs not to ſubmit our ſelues, but who followeth the Lord he followeth the wiſeſt guide, and let others be no rule againſt him.
            
               
               2 When the morning came his ſpirit was troubled,
                  Verſe 8.
                  
                which feare was inough to teach him that theſe viſions were ſent of god, but none could interpret thē vnto Pharaoh, yt we might thereby learne, how the wiſe in the world vnderſtand not gods ſecrets, but to his ſeruants his wil is reuealed. Then ſpake his chiefe butler, and told him of Ioſeph. Better late then neuer,
                  Verſe 9.
                  
                but fie of ſuch hart that ſo long could forget ſo good a man,
                  Worldlie wiſe vnderſtand not God.
                and one that ſo friendly had dealt with him. Two yeares (ſaith the firſt verſe) ere this was done after Ioſeph ſpake vnto him. Delaies in court then, &amp; ſome Courtiers euen in honeſt ſutes &amp; very reaſonable are too old we ſee.
                  Delayes in court, old.
                But the beſt men abhorre them euer, &amp; thākful minds defie forgitfulnes of their friends: twice is it done yt quickly is done, &amp; a readie diſpatch doubleth the benefite to the receiuer, &amp; conſequently dutie to the giuer.
            
               3 Then ſent Pharaoh and called Ioſeph. Not much vnlike to manie others,
                  Verſe 14.
                  
                that euer in their néed doe ſéeke to the godlie and well diſpoſed, to receiue that comfort,
                  The wicked ſeeke to the godly in their need.
                or reape that benefit which other cannot yéeld them. But in proſperitie they contemne them, &amp; little regard either them or their vertues. That Ioſeph ſhaued himſelfe, and changed his raiment to come vnto Pharaoh, it may well teach vs with reuerence to regard the Lord much more.
                  Outward reuerence before God
                Before whom yet wee come not with thus much regard: the more is our fault, and the leſſe is our féeling aſſuredlie. The Lord weigheth not outward geſture, but inward hart, yet in reſpect of our ſelues outward geſture dooth helpe our inward heart, and ſtir vs vp rather vnto reuerence▪ as changing of garments, kneeling &amp; bowing with eies, and hands lift vp, and ſuch like, therefore to be vſed.
            
               4 Without me (ſaith Ioſeph) God ſhal anſwer for the welth of Pharaoh. As if he ſhould ſay,

                  Glorie to be giuen to God.
                though I expound thy dreame which turneth to thy good, it is yet God &amp; not I that anſwereth for thy welth. A dutifull ſpeach in a child of god, to giue god the honour that is due to him, fit for vs, and for all beléeuers euermore. For what haue we that we haue not receiued? doth not euery gift &amp; euery thing in nature good, procéed from god?
                  1. Cor. 4 7. Iam. 1.17.

then ſhould we rob him of his owne? God forbid. Herod for taking to himſelfe moſt vainly the praiſe of his well ſpeaking,

                fearfully periſhed to make vs beware. Yea Ioſeph is carefull euen before the vnbeléeuers to commit this ſin: &amp; let vs marke it. Therfore in the 28. verſe. he repeateth it againe. This is the thing which I haue ſaid vnto Pharaoh,
               
                  Verſe. 28.

                  Verſe. 35.
                  
               
               5 That Ioſeph giueth counſell to Pharaoh to lay vp, &amp;c. Beſide that it ſheweth the dutie of gods prophets &amp; miniſters, not onely to ſhew the euils to come, but alſo the remedies for the ſame. It doth alſo further warrāt as lawful &amp; good ſuch laying vp in one yeare as may ſerue for an other, either of father for his child, man for his familie, or gouernor for his place cōmitted vnto him. Only moderation &amp; order that it be kept is to be cared for.
                  Storing lawfull.
                Which moderation muſt regard circumſtances of perſon, calling, place, time. &amp;c. Therfore ſaid Ioſeph, let there be choſen a man of vnderſtanding &amp; wiſdom to do this, meaning no doubt which ſhould do with diſcretion yt which was fit. No warrant therfore this gathering thus limited &amp; for ſuch end, for thoſe ſcrapings ye greedie cormorants vſe amongſt vs, neither with meaſure, nor for good end, or any care of anie godly circumſtance.
            
               6 Then ſaid Pharaoh, can we find ſuch a man as this in whō is the ſpirit of God?
               
                  Verſe 38.
                  
                
               Thou ſhalt be ouer my houſe, &amp;c. Making this argument,
                  Gifts fit for places to be regarded.
                that becauſe Ioſeph had ſuch gifts, therfore he was fit for ſuch place, and implying the contrarie, that places ought not to go where want of gifts is fit for them. A thing that will accuſe manie a giuer in the latter day, when the lord ſhall recken. That they haue not béene ſo holy as Pharaoh of Egypt to regard gifts in ſuch men vpon whom they haue beſtowed places of charge, and moſt great charge. But what did I ſay? not regard gifs, do not giuers of places in our daies regard their gifts who muſt inioy them? How haue I erred, ſince gifts, and gifts, and nothing but gifts, and all for gifts we do what we do, Si nihil attuleru ibis Homere foras: If you haue no gifts the doore is open, and the way before you, packe you

hence.
                But O curſed gifts, and curſed they that regard ſo much ſuch kind of gifts. My meaning is plaine, and this text is plain. Pharaoh of Egypt, euen Pharaoh of Egypt, I ſay,
                  Gifts too much regarded.
                regardeth what was within Ioſeph, and not what was without, and ſhall we be all for the gifts without, and nothing for grace within? for gaine to our ſelues by ſinfull bribes, not for gaine to the Church or common wealth by ſtrength to diſcharge? Thou and thy gifts periſh (ſaid the Apoſtle once) and thou and thy gifts periſh, ſhall god ſay one day, when it ſhall ſmart. Yea thou with thy gifts that thus giueſt for ſuch gifts to an vnworthie one, and he for want of gifts that yet giueth thee theſe gifts to ſupplie his want of gifts inward in mind, and required of god if he wil haue ſuch place as requireth ſuch gifts to ye diſcharge of it. The heathens to ſhew that honour ought euer and onlie accompanie Vertue, built a Temple to Honor,
                  Panormitan. lib. 1. de geſtis Alphonſi.
                and ſo adioyned therevnto another Temple to Vertue, that by no meanes a man could get into the Temple of Honor, but onlie through the Temple of Vertue, and alas ſhall wee that profeſſe more knowledge bee woorſe in our practiſe then all Heathens? God worke with vs for his mercie ſake in this reſpect.
            
               7 Then ſaid Pharaoh to Ioſeph, Behold I haue ſet thee ouer all the land of Egipt.
               
                  Verſe 41.42.43.

                  After a fowl day cōmeth a faire.
                
               He ſet him vpon the beſt Charet that he had ſauing one, &amp; they cried before him Abrech, &amp;c. O god of comfort how art yu one and the ſame for euer to thy children, ſweet and mercifull, kind and gracious, bountifull and liberall in thy good time. Is Ioſeph now thus highly exalted? And ſhal all Egypt be ruled by him? O what are the afflictions of gods children then? are they any thing but ſuch humblings &amp; ſchoolings as the lord their god &amp; moſt gracious father fitteth them by and with, &amp; vnder to ſuch places,
                  Sweet comfort in deed in all afflictions.
                honors and comforts as he hath apointed for them either here in this life, or in yt to come? No, no, they are no matters of anger any way, but trainings &amp; leadings to other purpoſes of our ſwéeteſt god. Foule daies haue

Amen, Amen.
            
               8 That Ioſeph ſuffered all this honor to be done vnto him, and receiued it,
                  The godly may accept honours in this world, by places, titles, &amp;c.
                held it, and vſed it, doth it not ſhew that the children of God may inioy worldly places of high regard, and yet be faithfull? is pietie ſuch a ſimplicitie, that cannot abide honour in this, or like order amongſt men? No, neither yet is ſuch peeuiſhnes, pietie, that condemneth Gods bleſſings, as things vnlawfull for his children, and grindeth the téeth at the comforts of Ioſeph without a cauſe. What Anabaptiſts think and haue put in writing we know more, then we néede to regard. Their kindes were diuerſe, and their ſentences differing accordinglie. Princes and potentates in this world here on earth haue receyued honours, and giuen honour to their inferiours againe without diſlike of God, euer from their beginning, ſo that an order be kept. And to ſay that princes may not vſe any of their ſubiects ſeruiſes according to their gifts, &amp; honour them for their ſeruices accordinglie, when they haue done, is moſt derogatorie, not onelie to the princes owne honour, but alſo to his gouernement and libertie. How did Darius honour Mordecai, and how did Mordecai (a faithfull man) accept the ſame? How did Nabuchadnezzar honour Daniel,
               
and Daniell take it, vſe it, and enioy it with thankfulneſſe to God, faithfulnes to the king that gaue it,
                  Dan 2.48.
                and good great to many a one. Daniel was made a great man, ſaith the Text by the King, who gaue him many and great giftes, and made him gouernour ouer the whole prouince of Babel, and chiefe of the rulers aboue all the wiſe men of Babel, Sidrach, Miſaak, and Abednago were alſo honoured and accepted of it.

                and therefore now goe no further. Hoping that hereby wee ſee it plaine, that titles and honors accepted of Gods children, as here of Ioſeph, are no ſignes of ambition, nor forbidden as vnlawfull, ſo the minde be humble and meeke, and a meaſure kept. And immoderat it cannot truely be ſaid, which of a chiſtian Prince for iuſt cauſe is voutſafed to ye faithful ſubiect according to the cuſtome &amp; maner of the Countrey. No, rather it is to the common welth &amp; church both anornament and adiument. The contrary being ſought at this day in miniſters out of al queſtiō by ye deep malice of Satan, to the end that all they being brought into contempt, Religion with them might alſo fall, he hauing his libertie to ſpit out his venome and blaſphemies againſt it at large, not one being of authority and countenance to oppoſe himſelfe againſt him, and ſuch his dealinges of the miniſters. Who ſo would haue the foundation of an houſe and building out, may not immediatly begin to ſtrike at that,
                  A ſimilitude
                for feare all the building fall vpon his head, but he muſt begin at the top, and firſt vntile it,

then vntimber it, and ſo by litle and litle come to the foundation, which after this ſort he may take away with eaſe: euen ſo in this, which wee now haue ſpeech of, if Satan directly ſhould ſtrike at the foundation, Chriſt and his word, with religion iſſuing from the ſame, then all men eſpying his malicious drift, would oppoſe themſelues againſt him, and ſo his drift be hindered by many ſtones in the building, falling as it were vpon his head. But when he beginneth to vntile it, and to vntimber it, as I haue ſayd, that is to debaſe and diſgrace the miniſters already in it, and to hinder by their diſgraces others of any gifts to come vnto it, with ſuch like proceedinges many and wicked, in time he will haue the foundation with eaſe, that is Chriſt and his word out of the ſame, with all holy worſhip according to the ſame, placing for learning barbariſme, and blindnes, and for religion, ſuperſtition, with all the blacknes and darknes of Egypt agayne. Wherefore, if euer the comforts of learning and learned men haue nouriſhed to church and common welth ſufficient helps, and ye contrary in all ages rooted them out by litle and little till all were gone: let vs neuer greeue at the meanes that ſo happie a good followeth after, but bleſſe God hartily if the place we liue in afford them to vs, and labour to our powers euer to maintaine them. Knowing by Ioſeph, Daniel, and all theſe examples now recited, that in men of all conditions and callings in the church, and common welth, outward thinges, as wealth and riches, honors and dignities, with titles of incouragement, and gracious fauour in religious Princes may be allowed. The true children of God hauing daily learned, to abound &amp; to want, that is in proſperity to vſe what the time affordeth to Gods glory, and in aduertſity to imbrace what the Lord then alſo ſendeth without repining. If Iſrael offend, let not alſo Iudah ſinne herein: that is, if ſome offend, who ſhould not do ſo? Let not vs thus hearing, and thus ſeeing, follow their example, and offende likewiſe. But defye wee Satan and his attemptes, to our laſt day.

                     Iacobs ſending of his ſonnes into Egypt for food.
                     Their intertainment there with Ioſeph when they came.
                     Their returne againe to theyr father.
                  
               
            
            
               TOuching the firſt, in that Iacob ſendeth for food,
                  The godly afflicted as the wicked, yet to other end.
                wee ſee that euen he alſo was ſubiect to this famine: where wee may note, that the godly often times indure the ſame afflictions that the wicked doe, but far yet differing from them in the end. For vnto the wicked ſuch afflictions are the whips and ſcourges of God for their ſinnes and deſerts, vnto the godly they are tryals of faith and patience that God may be further glorifyed by them. Ieremie, Ezechiel, Daniel, with thouſandes moe may be examples vnto vs and proofes hereof. That Iacob ſent wee ſee he tempted not God, but vſed meanes &amp; we muſt doe the like. The Egyptians ſould, and wee kepe, neuer contented with the price, that our iudgement may be iuſt in the day of the Lord, when we ſhall ſmart for this greedines and want of loue. To haue trafficke alſo with ſtrangers &amp; forreners, euen with ſuch as differ from vs in religiō this ſtory warranteth with many moe. But that Iacob would not let Beniamin goe with them, wee ſee his loue, he loued the mother, &amp; he loueth the child. Beniamin is his ioy now that Ioſeph is gone, and he may not be from him. The reaſon that is alledged leaſt he ſhould die, is common to the others alſo, if he had regarded them ſo much. But indeede he did not though all were his children. Beniamin he loued, &amp; for him he feareth loue being euer giuen to feare, according to the ſaying: Res eſt ſolliciti plena timoris amor.
            
            
               
               2 Ioſeph was gouernour of the lande &amp;c. And why did not Ioſeph ſignify ſo much vnto his father all this while by letter and meſſenger ſent of purpoſe both for his fathers comfort and his owne by mutuall hearing one from another?

                  •
               ) did not God reueale vnto Iacob his beloued ſeruant what was become of Ioſeph his ſonne, and that he was liuing? &amp;c. Surely (ſaith Auſten) becauſe his good pleaſure was otherwiſe, and that thinges might come to paſſe not onely which God had decreed, but as God had decreed concerning the maner. The ſelfe ſame thing it was which gouerned and ruled Ioſeph, that he could not like to ſignify vnto his father his eſtate, but euen follow the Lordes determined way, and let all fall out as he would.
                  Gods purpoſes come to paſſe when we thinke not. Chap. 37.5.
                That the Text ſayth alſo, Ioſephs brethren came and bowed their face to the ground before him, it ſheweth vs plainly, how propheſies of God doe come to paſſe, wee litle knowing either to good or to euill. For was not this the dreame of Ioſeph, that all their ſheaues ſhould do reuerence to his ſheafe: and ſee now if it be not truly fulfilled though they litle thinke of it. They bow, and they bow to the ground before Ioſeph, litle thinking that it was Ioſeph. So did the Iewes fulfill the Scriptures concerning their dealinges with Chriſt when he ſhould come, and yet they did not thinke ſo. So doth the Church of Rome fulfill the Propheſie of the Apoſtle concerning a departure from the fayth,
                  Act. 4.
                a forbidding to marry and commaunding to abſteine from meates which God hath ordained to be receaued with thankeſgiuing of them which belieue and know the truth.
                  1. Tim. 4.1.
                Doe you remember a litle before how theſe brethren of Ioſeph ſcoffed at his dreames and ſaid: then ſhall wee ſee what ſhall become of his Dreames. Now let them ſee what is become of them, they being now with their Faces downe to the grounde before him, doing reuerence vnto him,
                  Mockers.
                as the ruler of all Egypt. So ſo ſhall all mockers ſee come to paſſe what God hath ſpoken to their iuſt confuſion, if they repent not for ſuch diſdaine and vnbeliefe. Let thoſe mockers of whom S. Peter ſpeaketh conſider this. They ſay in their iolitie, where is the promiſe of his comming,

tuſh the day of doome will neuer be &amp;c. Behold, behold yee prophane harts what is come to paſſe in Ioſeph, and what yet ſhall further follow in his time, and take vp your ſcoffes in trembling feare to prouoke his wrath, whoſe truth did neuer fayle, nor euer ſhall.

               and made himſelfe ſtrange to them, ſpeaking roughly &amp;c. Some condemne him for diſſembling, and ſay, wee may not follow him. But others excuſe it by our Sauiours dealinges with the woman of Canaan, to whom he meant in the end nothing but good, what ſhowe ſo euer he made awhile that her faith might appeare. How ſo euer ſurely the truth is knowen, that wee may conceale a truth for a time and not by and by vtter all that in time wee will. Therfore hard it is to interpret all the doings of the godly according to outward ſhowe and ſeeming for a time.

                But that Ioſeph knew them, and they knew not him,
                  A type of Chriſt.
                ſome haue made it a figure of our Sauiour Chriſt knowing, but not knowen, at diuers times. Mary knew him not being riſen till he called her by her name, yet he knew her: So againe the Diſciples going to Emans, and many moe. But the day ſhall come that he ſhall be knowen to thoſe that ſold him, and vnto all as Ioſeph in time was to his brethren.
            
               4 Ioſeph telleth them, they are ſpies, and are come to ſee the weaknes of the land. Thereby ſhewing vs how careful all good ſubiects ought to be of the ſafety of their countrey,
                  Loue to our countrey.
                and how ieliouſe that any ſhould eſpy the weaknes or nakednes of the ſame to the hurt of it euer. Far and far vnlike to ſuch vnnaturall runagates as are borne amongeſt vs, which dayly and continually are diſcouering to the enimie our ports and crekes,
                  Popiſh loue
                our men and munition, our ſtrength and weaknes, and what ſo euer wee haue or may haue that may hurt our ſelues, or profit our foes. But the reward of ſuch is with a iuſt God that euer hated it ſince he made man. And for this preſent time me thinke wee might thus profit by this place: that if rulers and gouernours be ſo carefull to keepe couered the weaknes of the Land

leaſt any aduantage ſhould be taken by the enimy, ſurely with like wiſedome, and very godly diſcretion ſhould all particular men be carefull of their priuat wantes and weaknes, their imperfections and infirmities,
                  Our owne priuat wāts to be couered.
                ether to fortify againſt them that they may ceaſe to be ſuch, or to keepe them couered and warely hidden from aduantage ſought, and to be taken by the aduerſarie. For this is fit, if we care for any thing, and no litle good it would cauſe in time to the common truth. Many are too weake and wide open, if Satan ſailing and ſeeking a port will enter there. And being thus weake and full of aduantage there is not that care that ought to be to preuent the ſame. Whereby we fall &amp; with vs the cauſe that wee ſhould more tender then our ſelues. Be warned by this and apply wee the care of Gouernours in the land to our ſelues and our amendment in this reſpect. We ſee it good and let a word ſuffice vs.

Maruell wee not then if God ſo will that ſome ſee not the truth yt is yet preſent with them and euen vnder their eies: For their darknes is deep whoſe eies are blinded in the Lords iudgement. When Chriſt ſpake to Mary, ſhe knew him ſtreight, but not before. So if Chriſt touch wee ſee full bright, but not before.

euen to make men acknowledge their faults, which otherwiſe ſlily they would diſſemble. Guiltines in the hart and conſcience is fitly compared to a body laid in the graue, for as yt ſleapeth and lyeth ſtill, but at laſt awaketh and ryſeth agayne, ſo doth guiltines &amp; ſin, it awaketh, it awaketh &amp; biteth ful ſore that earſt lay ſtil and was cleane forgotten. Proſperity lulleth and lappeth it vp, but affliction rouſeth it and vnfoldeth all. Ruben as one yt is alſo wounded, perfectly remembreth them of that which paſſed againſt their brother.

                Did not I warne you (ſaith he) not to ſin againſt ye child, &amp; ye would not heare, charging thē in words as worſe than himſelfe, &amp; yet touching himſelfe alſo very deepe, who both contented in the ende, and kept counſell with them all this while.
                  Fellowes in ſin fall out.
                So vſe fellowes in ſinne to fall out amongeſt themſelues, when filthye wickedneſſe hath touched them all. But why did hee wiſhe them not to hurte the Childe? The reaſon in him is very well knowen vnto all, becauſe nature moued him &amp; the doing was bad. But the reaſon yt I thinke of might haue bin this, &amp; as yet may be in like caſe, becauſe children in time may be men▪ when we may be reckoned withall for our doings. Then Ioſeph a child was too weak for ten,
                  Children wil be men, therefore abuſe them not.
                but now Ioſeph a mā is too ſtrong for ten. Therfore so vſe children whilſt they be yong as wel may be anſwered when they be men. There is a remembrance of the anguiſh that pore Ioſeph was in when be beſought them. A circumſtance ſure that moueth a good hart very much, and moſt hard is the hart that yeldeth nothing to teares and anguiſhe of a troubled minde. Would GOD the ſighes and greeuous grones of our perplexed Brethren mooued vs more. Wee ſhould more reſemble the GOD of pitie and leſſe expreſſe the manners of theſe ſtonie Brethren. Wee knowe the truth of the ſaying moſt ſure,
                  The petition of a minde in anguiſh ſhould moue much.
                that hee which wanteth mercie of mercie ſhall miſſe, and hee ſhall haue mercie that mercifull is. Yet grieue wee the ſoules and wring the Bodies both full hard and ſore of our Chriſtian Bretheren and Neighbours by vs. But marke theſe Bretheren of Ioſeph here how now it pincheth their verye inwardes, that euer they were ſo cruell to their Brother, eſpecially that they regarded him not, when in anguiſhe and woe hee beſought

them of fauour and better dealinges. Verily ſo ſhall it vs, if we doe ye like, cruſhing our brethren &amp; grinding their Faces whom wee can ouercome. And who knoweth the end of Gods wrath to ſuch bloudy hardnes of hart?
                  A guilty conſcience.
                Agayne, marke in theſe Bretheren the Nature of a guiltye conſcience, how it ſtill accuſeth, ſtill ſtirreth and ſtartleth within a man, and is alwayes gawling his mind with bitter remembrance of deede done. Eſpecially when any thinges doe chaunce or fall out croſſe, as here it did. Then it tormenteth vs more within, than the affliction wee doe ſuffer doth without, ſtill ſuggeſting into our mindes, that this befalleth vs for ſuch a thing. So you ſee were theſe brethren now tormented, and beware wee by them. Laſt of all, that Ruben exhorted and warned them when they did offende, and nowe iuſtifyeth his warning giuen to their Faces: may it not well remember vs of the warnings giuen vnto our ſelues by Preachers, and by Parentes, by Friendes and welwillers of ſundry degrees? Is not Gods Finger in it, that wee are thus warned? And ſhall not they alſo one Daye accuſe vs certainlye, as here Ruben doth, and witneſſe vnto our Faces, that they did admoniſhe vs, and wee would not heare? Surely they ſhall: and wee cannot bee ignorant of it any way. Happy is the man then that harkeneth willinglye to all good admonitions, and yeeldeth to them. Ioſeph heareth this wofull Dialogue of his Brethren,
                  Verſ. 24.
                  
                but little knewe they that either hee was Ioſeph, or yet vnderſtoode them: And hee turned (ſayth the Text) from them,
                  Pitie.
                that hee might weepe. Shewing thereby (what I wiſh well noted) that a man poſſeſſed with Gods Spirit, hath pitie and mercie euer within, what Face or faſhion ſo euer he bee forced to ſhewe without. Hee ſpeaketh roughly like no Brother for a time, but his affection is brotherly and moſt tender at all tymes. His wordes be rough, but his meaning ſmooth, our wordes bee ſmooth and ſofter than Oile, when our mindes and meaninges are roughe and cruell. O contrary courſe, and therefore contrary end if we take not heede from Ioſeph here.

                  Benefites done would be ſecret oftentimes.
                And why muſt the money be ſecretly put in their ſackes, and not openly giuen them to their hands? The reaſon was here that they might ſuſpect nothing, his time being not yet to reueale himſelfe. But we may truly learne by it this good leſſon, euen to ſteale a benefite vpon our bretheren, doing them good without any trompet blowen before vs. Time ſhall ſerue to reueile what God will haue knowen, and till then it is knowen to God which is inough. Wee couet too much many of vs the knowledge of men, when wee doe them good, &amp; if they ſee it not wee will tell it yea againe and againe rather than it ſhould be ſecret and vnknowen. But this marreth all,
                  Vainglory.
                and thus looſe wee loue with men of ſkill and all reward with God Almightie that hateth vaineglory. Wherefore he ſaid it well that ſaid it: Si tanto ſtudio vitia noſtra abſcondimus, ne humanam gloriam amittamus:

               quanto maiori cura diſſimulanda virtutes coeleſtem gloriam amittamus. If ſo carefully wee hide our faultes leaſt wee ſhould looſe the praiſe of men: how much rather ſhould we couer and keepe ſecret our vertues leaſt wee looſe the praiſe of God. For as wel is God loſt with vaine publiſhing of our good deedes, as man by reuealing of our euill deedes. A treaſure hidden is ſafer from theeues, and vertue couered is ſafer from Satan.

To cōclude, the hen, becauſe ſhe cackleth looſeth her egge, and cackling boaſters looſe their praiſe with God and man, which Ioſeph did not being thus ſecret in his good.

do, but ye fain euery traueller was to cary for himſelf: would God this benefit (ye leaſt of ten thouſand yt our lād affordeth vs) might ſtir vs vp to be thākful to God &amp; to preſerue ye peace &amp; proſperity of the ſame to our beſt powers. They that haue their buſines in forein countries know by experience the bleſſing that wee haue &amp; many times vtter it in our eares, if our harts had feeling of any good. If the word ſhould be vrged, peraduenture our bleſſing would greatly be amplified: for it forceth not yt they were in any Iune at all, but only abode in a place for the night ſeaſon &amp; there prouendred their Beaſtes &amp; refreſhed themſelues, hauing prouiſion giuen for both. How Iacob lodged you remember before, &amp; what a ſoft pilow he had of a hard ſtone vnder his head.

                Therfore looke we more at ye good of our countrey, where euery village almoſt yeldeth cōfortable reſt to a weary traueller. Their aſtoniſhment and feare ſtill,
                  A gauled conſcience.
                ſtill declareth ye gaule of a wounded cō
               ſcience, which being in theſe brethren great &amp; grieuous, &amp; accuſing them ſtill without any reſt made them thinke yt God would haue brougth them to ſome trouble by this money. Not to haue therefore thy conſcience againſt thee, is to haue a thouſand comforts with thee. Againe, it ſheweth how litle good a multitude doth in diſtreſſe except God giue counſell and direct to comfort.
                  Counſel in perplexity.
                For here are many, &amp; yet all amazed at a matter not great had they conſidered. Pray we therfore in all perplexities to the Lord of counſell &amp; wiſedome, and he wil direct vs aſſuredly, but truſt wee nothing in nūbers of men, for they cannot help. They feare againe wher was cauſe of comfort had they knowen all: euen ſo do others to this day ſtil, &amp; yet all is wel in the end, when God openeth matters fully. Euen in feares therefore comfort wee our ſelues hereafter, &amp; truſt in God, hoping the beſt in the end: their eye caſt vpon God in this their perplexitie, ſaying one to another: what is this that God hath done to vs, muſt make vs auoid all drowſie dreames of Lucke and Fortune, and ſee the Lordes Finger euen in our aduerſitie:
                  No fortune or lucke.
                So did Iob, and ſo haue all godly done from the beginning. The Lord it is that taketh as well as that giueth, and bleſſed muſt bee his name of vs in them both. The greatneſſe of their aſtoniſhment appeareth in this, that the reſt did not looke whether their money alſo were

in their Sackes, but as all amazed are voide of conſideration what to doe: when being come home their moneys alſo were found likewiſe: the drift of good Ioſeph was not to feare either Father or brethren, but to comfort them, and to prouide for their comming agayne, if happely money ſhould be ſcarce. But what a good man doth to a good end often by mens weaknes or waywardnes turneth otherwiſe.

Alas good Iacob, thou knoweſt not yet how God will comfort thy hart ere long, &amp; ſhew how al theſe things are for thee, but as yet the time is not. Therefore now do thou ſhew and let vs learne the pangs &amp; paſſions of naturall parents. Their children ſticke neere to the hartes of them, and with their aduerſities they cannot ieſt, would God their children requited them euer. Some feare to haue and grieue litle to looſe children, but it is not ſo with Iacob nor with any good ones.

                  Perplexitie blind a while.
                Perplexitie ſeeth not by &amp; by what is to be done, and therefore Iacob yet denyeth what after he yeldeth vnto. But why is Iacob ſo fond ouer Beniamin more than all the reſt, that if he die his gray head wil follow after. Surely the affection that he bare to the mother now dead maketh him loue aboue all the reſt the childe hee had by her. So loue to ye liuing ſheweth loue to the dead what it was when they liued. And would God it alwaies ſhewed as it ſhould, Dauid loued Ionathan whilſt he liued and for his ſake he loued others,

                  Loue to the liuing ſheweth loue to the dead.
                If want of loue to the liuing, how want of loue to the dead of whom theſe liuing came, iudge in your Hartes, without further ſpeech what liues bee written in ſome foreheades to their endleſſe ſhame, that they neuer loued whom God and dutie bound them vnto whileſt they liued. Iacob is not ſo, Dauid was not ſo, neuer will any good one

be ſo, and therefore beware that Iacob mentioneth his gray head is greatly patheticall, and telleth vs truly that all parentes are duly to be regarded, that they be not grieued, but the aged father or mother with locks like ſnow is moſt tenderly and derely to be regarded. Whoſe hart then melteth not to ſee this olde man thus making his mone, that if Beniamin die, hee will die, and his graye head with griefe and woe ſhould followe his Child to the graue that he ſo loued. God giue children ſome of this loue.

Where wee ſtill muſt marke which was noted before) how this godly patriarke with al his houſhold is alſo ſubiect to the famine, yea to this great famin, wherein, no doubt, notwithſtanding this wheat from Egypt, they were glad to eate herbes, and rootes, and beries with many a hungry meale: Yea euen in that land are they thus diſtreſſed, wherein God had promiſed to bleſſe both Iacob and his poſteritie, and was this thinke you no temptation to Iacob? Learne wee then profitably by this example to ſtand ſtedfaſt in faith whatſoeuer fall out and preparing our ſelues for the worſt euentes comfortably wayte for end ioyfull as here it was.

                wee anſwered but his queſtions of our kindred &amp; brethrē, not able to gueſſe before hand what there vpon he would inferre. Therefore ſpeaking no more than we were vrged vnto, we are not to be blamed for his illations. Truth it is, and may teach vs dayly to ſpare vndeſerued blame, that wee vſe many times to beſtow vpon men. For ſo it is, that a man ſpeaking as occaſiō iuſtly moueth him, ſomething is inferred that he neuer dreamed of againſt his wil. Wee may not lay this to the Speakers charge, but leaue it as a thing beſides thought falling out, and excuſe the guiltleſſe.

                Laſtly a damno, of hinderance that commeth by ſtaye: except wee had made this tarying, doubtles by this wee had returned the ſecond time. Then the Father yelded and ſaid,
                  Verſ. 11.
                  
                if it muſt needes be ſo, doe thus &amp;c. Where ſee and marke in Iacob a moſt Godly courſe in extremitie and danger,
                  The godly haue euer a yeelding time to euery good thing.
                namely, to vſe all honeſt meanes to relieue our feare, and yet onely to truſt in the GOD of Heauen. Iacob ſendeth the beſt fruites of the Land &amp;c. But as his hold aboue all houldes hee ſpeaketh thus: GOD Almightie giue you mercye in the ſight of the Man &amp;c. Then againe, obſerue it in Iacob here, that in time hee yeeldeth, and cannot reſiſt when GOD had decreed it ſhould be ſo. Surely ſo doe wee, and ſo muſt wee doe what wee can. Startle we may, and ſtriue a while as Iacob did here, vtterly refuſing, and vtterly diſlyking to doe this or that, but if GOD haue appointed it to be ſo, a time will come, that wee ſhall ſtriue no longer, but ſay as Iacob ſaid in this place: If ſo it muſt be then ſo be it. Happye are they yt yeeld ſooneſt and ſtriue leaſt agaynſt that good

which God hath appointed. Obſtinacie was neuer conſtancie, nor wilfulnes witte, as I haue noted before.
                  Obſtinacies not conſtancie.
                To change from euill to good, from error to truth, from darknes to light was euer pietie, when contrary courſe was ſinfull obſtinacie and the rodde of God vpon the vngodly. But O how hardly is this perſwaded. So loue wee the thing wee haue loued long, that needes we muſt cleaue to our owne damnation, and thinke it holy. So haue wee done, &amp; our fathers long: O conſtant courſe,
                  Ezech. 18.
                but you ſhall not doe as your Fathers haue done, ſaith the Lord.
            
               4 The truth of Iacob would alſo be obſerued,
                  Truth in all dealings.
                who willeth them to take double money with them, leaſt happily the former was an error. This conſcience want not onely theeues, and robbers, and open offenders, but ſome that ſeeme honeſt▪ and are not the worſt. Who can be content to make an aduantage of the error or ouerſight, or miſtaking of their neighbours. according to the common ſaying, Si ſpye, ſport &amp;c. But if you ſpie not, good earneſt, and ſwallowed vp without any remorſe at all. Thus did not Iacob, no this hated Iacob and all good men euer. God ſeeth, and God muſt iudge mee one day iuſtly according to my workes. What profiteth then if my neighbour ſee not. Beware wee then and keepe cleane handes with a good conſcience, that ſhall neuer bee aſhamed.
            
               5 Thus all thinges made ready,
                  Suſpicion.
                theſe brethren ſet on and come into Egypt before Ioſeph, who when hee ſaw Beniamin was not a litle glad: yet kept his owne Counſell, and commaunded his Stewarde to make ready for Dinner, that they might dine with him. The Steward did ſo, and now when it was time he brought the men all to Ioſephs houſe, who ſtraight were afrayde, and ſayd to themſelues: becauſe of the money that came in our Sackes are wee brought hether that hee may picke a quarrell againſt vs &amp;c. O filthye ſuſpicion, howe blotteſt thou, and ſpotteſt thou euen good men? Thus apt to miſdeeme are theſe men.

                So was euen Abraham in his time when he ſaid, I thought the feare of God was not

                As hardly doth a good man ſuſpect one to be euill, ſo hardly doth an euill man imagine one to be good. Againe, ſee how Ioſeph in a meaning ſo good is miſiudged and ill thought of by thoſe men. Then who can auoide this damnable ſuſpicion, or what can a man ſo well intend which ſome wil not conſter quite awry. The man ſo good, the meaning ſo good, yet all ſuſpected. Their God giue grace to doe but well, and God giue comfort againſt curſed miſdemers for they cannot be auoided, but will be doing.
            
               6 When Ioſeph came home they brought their preſentes to him,
                  Verſ. 26.
                  
                and bowed downe to the ground before him, where ſee the dreame againe fully accompliſhed.
                  A Glaſſe for childrē.
                Now is the yongeſt alſo with them, and all bowe. Then aſked Ioſeph of their welfare, and by &amp; by whether their Father the olde man was in health. Not forgetting I warrant you for any honour his old father. This was a child that had God in him, and this is a glaſſe for all children to behold them ſelues in, who now a dayes quickly forget their parents, if neuer ſo litle welth grow. But if honor alſo happen to come, O what ſhould wee doe with our old parentes then? Our high places may not thinke of ſuch meane people. But proud Pecocke remember thy ſelfe, and behold here a man ſecond in the kingdome to the King, a man honored with all the honour that a mighty kingdome could aford, and yet his ſecond word is for his father, his old father, his dere father, and neuer is he well till he haue him with him. Let Courtiers like or diſlyke, his frends be his frends, and he will not deny them. God giue Children ſuch hartes.
            
               7 Then Ioſeph turned to his yongeſt brother Beniamin,
               
his brother wholly by father and mother (for Rachel bare both Ioſeph and Bēiamin) &amp; Ioſeph bleſſed him with that not able to goe any further his hart ſo melted vpon his brother,
                  Gods mercy maketh a mans hart to melt.
                but turned aſide to weepe a while. See then tears by Gods mercies. Himſelfe deliuered from danger &amp; priſon, exalted highly to great honor, his father aliue and in good health, his brethren before him and Beniamin with him, what mercies are theſe? No maruell then if a good man ſeeing ſo ſweet a God, be moued to teares in a ſweet feeling. And thinke of your ſelfe. If neuer wet cie hath ſhewed feeling hart haue you not bene dull? Certainly mercy in a gracious God wringeth out tears from a feeling child, when neither fire nor ſword can get them out. The one we ouercome by faith aſſiſted, but ye other quite ouercommeth vs being ſweet and comfortable aboue all deſert. Then Lord giue feeling.
            
               8 When Ioſeph had eaſed his hart by this tender weping forth he came to dine with them.
                  A ſtate may be maintained lawfully.
                But they prepared for him by himſelfe &amp; for them by themſelues, ſaith the text: which being done to ſhew his dignity, it teacheth vs our liberty in this reſpect. What God vouchſafeth may be vſed without pride or blame, or any offence. And as great a fault to, is an abiect minde to goe too lowe as an arrogant &amp; haughty to goe to high Dauid exalted maintained his ſtate though a poore mans child.. Daniel preferred knoweth his liberty and doth the like. Eſther againe with many moe. So God be honoured as the giuer, and meaſure obſerued in his feare, haue honor and vſe honor, haue ſtate, and vſe ſtate, according to the place you liue in lawfully, behould Ioſeph here and all the reſt.
            
               9 The Egyptians might not eate bread with the Ebrewes,
                  Verſ 32.
                  
                for that was an abomination vnto ye Egyptians,

To eate or drinke with vs poore Ebrewes not at Ioſephs table, but at the Lords table were an abomination to theſe Egyptiās of whom I ſpeak, whē liuing without a vocation by other mens labors, &amp; at other mens tables, when hard and extreme dealing in buying and ſelling, when keeping commodities for a greater price as barley or mault, or the like till they be caſt away, when cenſuring Magiſtrates and miniſters with Corah his countenance, yea (ſhal I ſay all) when filthines and ſinne ſundry waies is ſwallowed &amp; accounted not ſo great an offence, as to come to church. But let theſe Egyptians know the Lord ruleth, who hath choſen theſe diſpiſed Ebrewes to be his people, when they &amp; theirs ſhall periſh in the red ſell of euerlaſting fire. Abhore we than hartely ſuch damnable hypocriſy. Say wee to no man in this prowd ſpirite,

                  1 Tim. 1.15.
                and proud Phariſies ſhall be caſt downe. But why did not Ioſeph reforme this faſhion ſo foule in the Egyptians, &amp; ſo greatly in diſgrace not onely of others. but of theſe his owne brethren and frendes? Surely becauſe he could not. And ſee here his wiſedome what hee could not reforme, he indureth without contention, being nothing preiudiciall to the piety of him or his brethren, though to their worldy diſgrace. Such wiſedome, ſuch Spirite, ſuch patience and diſcretion. O how ſhoulde it ſchoole vs, and teache vs to abhorre the contrary. Wee ſeeke not peace, nether inſew after it, when wilfully we wrangle about euery tryfle, and place life and death in euery ceremonie. Fathers of the Church haue done farre otherwiſe, if wee remember them, and euen the Apoſtle himſelfe denyeth ſuch cuſtome in a Church of God. But I haue elſewhere touched this more at large.

That is, where any mercy is vouchſafed vnto thoſe that know him not, many ſhall they haue that duly ſerue him as their God. But was Beniamins meaſſe thus increaſed more than the reſt? O how hardly then may loue bee ſmothered altogether? It cannot, it cannot, doe what you can, but one way or other it will peepe out, much like a candle that incloſed faſt in ſome houſe or priſon, ſhineth through the chinkes of the dore or walles and will not bee hid. Loue will creepe where it cannot goe (ſayth the old Prouerbe) and amongſt others it may haue euen this ſence, that wholly and fully it will not be hidden, but if it may not appeare in his full ſtrength for ſome purpoſes, yet glymmering it will be through one chinke or another, that it may be ſpyed. How then may we thinke of Chriſtian loue and charity, when naturall loue is of this kinde· Verily what nature may worke in a naturall man, Gods holy Spirite much more affecteth in the ſpirituall man Than no fruites of loue no loue, and ſmall Fruites ſmall loue. Examin wee our ſelues by this rule, our charity to our chriſtian bretheren were it any thing in vs by one way or other, it wil appeare as here did Ioſephs. Yet his brethren obſerued it not, as litle thinking he was Ioſeph: and if our loue tokens be not euer ſeene of thoſe, that thinke not of vs as wee are, it is but like this, &amp; it may not grieue vs. Ioſeph will bee knowen ere it be long, and then all theſe tokens will be remembred. So we agayne: But I goe no further, let this ſuffice.

                where wee may ſee &amp; learn, how euen good men are hardly induced to thinke wel of thoſe whoſe behauiour before they haue knowen to be bad. Therfore ſtand wee ſtedfaſt in a good courſe leaſt happily our fall make all our whole life after halfe ſuſpected. Credit, &amp; honor, and honeſty is ſoone loſt, but ſoone gayned againe when once it is loſt. The meanes that Ioſeph vſed, was a commaundement to his ſteward to put his owne cup in Beniamins ſack &amp;c. which may not be a warrant to vs to vſe any vnlawfull practiſes, ſeeing God hath commaunded vs to walke in ſimplicity, of like in Ioſeph this was ſome particular motion for which he might haue warrant.
                  A moderatiō in pomp and port of plate. &amp;c.
                It ſeemeth by the text the cup was but ſiluer, and then how that might be his honour being ſo great may be a queſtion. Whereunto we may anſwere that peraduenture that age was more temperat in plate and pompe than this of ours: againe, though it were but ſiluer, yet might the ingrauing and workmanſhip be very coſtly. What alſo if Ioſeph but newly exalted, wiſely and diſcretly moderated his courſe, leaſt ſpite and enuie (a weede in Courte growing very much) might worke him woe being but a ſtranger. Increaſe one may with credit wel, but to ſtrike ſaile with worthy mindes can neuer want ſcorne and ſcoffing taunt.
            
               
               2 That Ioſeph taketh vpon him to be a Diuiner,
                  Verſ. 7.
                  
                it ſheweth the litle ſpots that are in the faireſt faces,
                  The beſt men haue imperfections.
                and may not be followed, but let vs rather ſtande now and ſee the poore mens plea when Ioſephs Steward ouertooke them, and layd the cup to their charge. Alas ſay they, why doth my Lord ſay ſo, God forbid that thy ſeruants ſhould do ſo, &amp;c.
                  A deteſtatione peccati.
                But how doe they prooue themſelues honeſt and true? Firſt ab aequitate. God forbid we ſhould be ſuch, as if they had ſaid, it were not right, it were not good, and thy ſeruantes (though poore men) haue a care of right, and what may become them. Secondly a repugnantibus, of thinges contrarie in ſome ſort one to another. Behold (ſay they) wee brought our money againe, how then ſhould wee ſteale? &amp;c. Theſe thinges being croſſe and contrary one to another in ſome ſort. Laſtly ab incommodo, by the detriment they are content to indure. With whom ſoeuer of thy ſeruants it is found, let him die the death, and wee alſo will be my Lords ſeruantes. So ſtifly ſtood they vpon their truth, and ſo bould is truth before all men euer. But yet ſee a defect,
                  Be bould, but wary in iuſtifying your ſelfe.
                though bould they might be being true men, yet wiſe and not raſh muſt innocency make men. They raſhly ſaid, with whom it is found let him die: but they ſhould haue added being ſtollen by the partie, and of knowledge taken. For want of which warines wee ſee their danger had not thinges beene as they were. Therefore thus much let vs learne and not ſtand vpon it, that in the middeſt of our beſt integritie &amp; vpright courſe, yet we vſe no vnaduiſed Speeches, neither giue any needleſſe aduantage, but warely ſpeaking avow our truth, and ſo abide the triall.
            
               3 This offer of theirs was thus far taken of the Steward, that he with whom the cup ſhould be found ſhould become ſeruant, and the reſt ſhould be blameleſſe. then fell they to ſearching, beginning at the eldeſt, and behold, in Beniamins ſacke the yongeſt of all is the cup found. Then they were abaſhed, they rent their clothes, they laded their aſſes, and backe againe gat they to the Cittie to Ioſeph for mercy.
                  A paterne of the fading comforts of this world.
                Who ſeeth not here as it were a paterne of this brittle worlds comfort. Yeſterday theſe menne were bidden to dinner, feaſted and much made

of at the Gouernours table, yea the ſame day in the morning with comfort and gladneſſe they lade
                  •
                away and all was well: but behold now an other hue al is changed and changed greatly, their clothes rent, ther hartes heauy, and nothing but danger and death before their faces. Such is this world, and the fickle fading comforts of it. To day wee laugh, to morrow we weepe, to day wee floriſh, to morrow we fall, nay euen in the turning of a hand our eſtate is turned as theſe mens was. Poſt imbres fructus, poſt maxima gaudia luctus. Rayne bringes floods, and ioy bringes woe, ſorrow follows comfort, too oft wee ſee it ſo. Being come to the preſence of Ioſeph agayne, they fell before him with heauie hartes, wee may well thinke, and the rather may wee thinke it becauſe there is no mention of any wordes vſed by and by, by them, but onely that they fell before him vppon the ground.
                  Verſ. 14.
                  
                Surely their feare and ſorrow within bereaued them of ſpeech for a while, and ſo doth it vſe. Remember Anna whoſe hart oppreſſed, as it were with anguiſh and griefe tooke ſpeech from toung and ſpake by ſignes. Remember the Shunamite agayne falling at the Prophets feete,
                  1 Kings 4.27.
                &amp; not able to ſpeake. Such was the caſe of theſe men, by humble geſture, and falling downe they ſue for mercy not able to ſpeake: yet at laſt they ſpake, God knowes with paſſions, with teares and lamentation, with ſobbinges and ſighinges to ſee their caſe (as Luther noteth.) They ſay, they can ſay nothing, the thing is found with them and what ſhould they ſay? His ſeruantes they muſt bee and abide his pleaſure. But Ioſeph would not ſo, hauing his affection but vpon Beniamin onely. The reſt he would diſpiſe, and retaine Beniamin. Then Iudah drew neere and tolde him the whole ſtory that here you ſee, how hardly their Father parted with Beniamin, what promiſe was made to returne him ſafe, and how lamentable would be their olde fathers caſe if they ſhould faile. Therefore whoſoeuer taryeth, he muſt goe ere his Father die. For his life depended vppon the Childe: where I marke agayne the reuerence of age in thoſe blinde dayes, if their light be compared with ours. Before there was mention of his gray head, and now here is mention agayne of the ſame to moue pitie and regard in Ioſeph towards him. Let it euer be honorable

then as it ought, olde age, and let hoary head worke all regard in the beſt minde ſtill and euer. But then agayne let old men bee alſo admoniſhed to remember well the old verſes concerning this.
            
               Sape nigrum cor eſt caput album, ſed quibus album
               Et caput &amp; cor eſt, ſint in honore ſenes.

                  White heads ſhuld haue white harts.
                thoſe olde men are honorable indeede and to be regarded. The vehement affection of old Iacob to his ſonne Beniamin hath often beene note
                  •
               , and yet here agayne is layd downe in large maner, Iudah refuſeth to ſee his face any more rather than to goe without the Child, yea to redeeme the Childe that hee might returne to his father, he offreth himſelfe a ſeruant for euer in a ſtrange countrey, which neuer would he haue done, but that he knew his fathers life depended vppon the Childe. Vnſpeakable therefore is a Parents affection ſometimes where it is ſetled. Doe wee thinke Ioſephs hart was not turned vp and downe in his bodie, whileſt he heard and ſaw theſe things? Yes, yes, the next chapter will ſhew he could hold no longer. Such ſorrow, ſuch weeping, ſuch ſighing and ſobbing in all his Brethren,
                  Ioſeph not able to hold any longer.
                ſuch feare in their hartes to looſe Beniamin, ſuch mentioning of his fathers loue to ye childe of his mother that was now dead, and the rather becauſe he the other brother by that woman was accounted dead. Theſe, things I ſay were darts and daggers to pearce Ioſephs Hart, and hee could no longer hold but confeſſe his name.

               Ioſeph to bee knowen vnto his brethren.
                  Affection reſtrained if it breake out is violēt
                Wherein firſt it is ſayd Ioſeph could not refrayne himſelfe before all that ſtood by him, but cryed, haue forth euery man from mee, not that hee was aſhamed of his Kindred, but that hee would couer his Brethrens fault, then wept hee and cryed ſo aboundantly, that the Egyptians heard, and the houſe of Pharao alſo heard: Brideled then may be affection awhile but when the banke breaketh, the ſtreame is ſtrong, and who can then ſtop the courſe agayne a while. Yet ſee a care of his Brethrens name euen in the midſt of his pang, and till all were gone hee would not touch them. Such wiſedome, ſuch gouernment, and ſuch diſcretion is moſt gracious whereſoeuer it is: and would God wee mig
                  •
               t euer bee beautified with it. Let loue be ſeene, and let ſorrowe ſhew, but remember euer time and place. Then cryed Ioſeph, I am Ioſeph, I am Ioſeph, doth my Father liue? as if he ſhould haue ſayd, feare no longer my deare brethren, nether bee diſmayed, it is Ioſeph your brother that hath thus dalied with you, Ioſeph your Brother, your owne fleſh and bloud, and no other. I am

               Ioſeph I tell you, euen Ioſeph your Brother, and caſt feare away. Doth my Father liue? But his Brethren amaſed, could not anſwere a word, they were ſtarke dumbe. O mighty God what a change is here? ſuch endes to ſorrowes can God giue when it pleaſeth him, and let all fleſh giue glory to him.
            Againe, ſee a type of the Lord our God, which may be comfortable. Hee checketh vs and ſnubbeth vs, he bindeth and impriſoneth vs, that is, he impoſeth vpon vs ſundry afflictions, as Ioſeph did vpon theſe his brethren, and when hee hath tryed vs to his good pleaſure, wee thinking of this man and that man, of this malice and that malice agaynſt vs, fearing, and diſmayde almoſt altogether, in the ende hee can hold no longer, but that bottomleſſe mercie of his breaketh out, and with bowels of loue hee cryeth vnto vs, it is I, it is I, I am Ioſeph your brother, that is Chriſt your Sauiour, your God and your Lord, that haue not ſpared mine owne life, but haue geuen it for you, bee not afraid, be not afraid, but plucke vp your hartes and reioyce, your ſorrow is ended, and your tryall finiſhed,
                  Iſay 40.2.
                I will be a brother to you, and no worſe for euer. It is I, it is I: ſo ſweete is the end in time of the troubles and tryals of Gods children. Euen as vpon the Sea when he walked,
                  Mat. 14.27. Iohn 14.
                and his Diſciples feared, he cryed, it is I, be not afrayd, be of good comfort.
                  I will manifeſt myſelfe vnto him.
                Come nere vnto me ſaith Ioſeph, &amp; come neere vnto me ſayth Chriſt: Yea, come vnto mee all yee that trauell and are heauie laden, &amp; I will refreſh you. So againe in his day of iudgement. Come yee bleſſed of my Father, come, come, I am Ioſeph your brother. &amp;c. which kindneſſe in him both heauen and earth ſhall heare then as Pharao his houſe heard now of Ioſeph. So fitteth this figure to our Sauiour.
            
               2 Now therefore be not ſad, nether greeued with your ſelues, that yee ſould mee,

                  Comfortable to the greeued.
                
               for God ſent mee before you for your preſeruation, &amp;c. This comfortable ſpeaking of Ioſeph to his brethren muſt teach vs by all meanes to comfort them which are truly humbled and wounded for their ſinnes. And the aſcribing of his comming into Egypt to God teacheth vs to diſtinguiſh betwixt Gods finger and mans malice in the ſelfe

ſame action, for they differ greatly, the one being ſinfull to an euill end, the other being gracious and mercifull euer for good. In Iobs affliction God had his finger and Satan his with, but what Satan maliciouſly, God moſt mercifully directed to his glory and to Iobs good. So the crucifying of our Sauiour, and the afflictions of his children euermore. Therfore it followeth not that if we ſay ſuch things be of God, by &amp; by it ſhould be cō
               cluded, that he is author of euill. You ſee the difference, &amp; remē
               ber S. Auſten, God would neuer ſuffer euill to be done except he were able out of euill to draw good. The land of Egypt yelded this comfort, that the poſterity of Iacob according to Gods purpoſe might be preſerued in the ſame. Therefore ye Godly are not burdenſome to a countrey, but a countrey is bleſſed yt it may relieue them, and the inhabitantes inioy for them ſuch mercy, as peraduenture without them they ſhould neuer haue. So happily euen this land wherein we liue for the poore exiles of Gods flocke, and we may do well to thinke of it, to ſtay all grudging.

The Grecians deliuered but from bodily ſeruitude,
                  Plutarch in the life of Flam.
                called their deliuerer a Sauiour to them, and range it out, Sauiour, Sauiour, that the Fowles in the Ayre fell dead downe with the crye. Much more, much more than ten thouſand times, may wee call the Lordes Annointed a Sauiour vnto vs. God giue feeling which I feare wee want.

                with offer of vs, before demaunde of theirs, and all comfortable countenance vnto the ende. Yea ſee, if Ioſeph bee not euen earneſt and greedie to haue this comfort deriued to his Father from him, and verily there is no more pleaſure or ſweete comfort to a good vertuous Childe than to doe good vnto his Parents according to the power that God hath giuen. Fye of all filthy natures then too viſible: daily before our Faces in this accurſed and daungerous time, that being both riche and welthy, warme and well furniſhed with all comfortes, ſuffer not onely other frendes in kindred neere them (to ſay nothing of the naked members of Chriſt) but euen their Parents that bred and bare them to ſuffer both hunger and colde, need and miſery, to their vtter ſhame. Thus did not Ioſeph, and let vs marke it.
            
               5 Then fell he vpon his brother Beniamins necke and wept, and Beniamin vpon his necke.

               Moreouer hee kiſſed all his Brethren and wept vppon them. &amp;c. See the Bowelles of men indued with Gods Spirit, they are full of loue, full of affection, full of grace, and full of goodnes, when clubby chu

formall ſhew, but for this heat and hartineſſe, this life and power of loue that was in Ioſeph, alas it is gone, and that makes vs ſtrangers one to another: but I ſay no more. You ſee here by Ioſeph the godly be no Stoicks, nor they bee no flintie Nabals towards any, but full of affection to their friendes. Yea, though their friendes haue wronged them as theſe had Ioſeph, yet all is forgotten and blotted out when once they meete. Now the God of Loue, worke more of this loue amongeſt vs daylye.
            
               
                  Verſ. 16.
                  
               
               6 The tidinges of this meeting came vnto Pharaos eare and the text ſaith,
                  Gods power, ouer mens harts.
                it pleaſed Pharaoh well and his ſeruāts: where we ſee the power of God ſtill for his ſeruantes to giue them fauour in the hartes and eares and eies of any mortall men whatſoeuer whoſe miniſterie it ſhall pleaſe him to vſe to the reliefe, comfort, or countenance of any of them. He ruleth poore and rich, meane and mightie to his Childrens comfort when he will, yea euen the Princes haue their harts in his hande,
                  Prou. 21.
                and hee ruleth them as the Riuers of water at his will. Wee heard in the former Chapter, that for the Egyptians to eate bread with the Hebrewes was an abhomination to the Egyptians, yet ſee now euen the king and his courtiers moſt fauourably bent to theſe deſpiſed Hebrewes. So powrefull I ſay is God ouer all harts when he will, and who may not be comforted with it? Nay ſee more, not onely the King is fauourably inclined to them, but moſt extraordinarily regardeth them calling for Ioſeph, and giuing him commaundement to diſpatch his Brethren away with their lading, and to giue them in charge to bring their Father and Families wholly vnto him, and hee would giue them, not ſome waſt part of the Land, but the very beſt of the land, and they ſhould eate of the fatte of it. He furthermore willeth, that charrets be taken out of Egypt for their children and wiues, and that they ſhould not paſſe for their ſtuffe, for he would prouide for them. See therefore the power of GOD, not to prouide ſmall thinges for his Children, but euen thus farre to mooue the Kinge, that he thinketh of the very beſt of the Lande for them. And ſee in the King a moſt Princelie minde, beeing (where hee is good) moſt bountifullie good.

A vertue euer worthy great commendacion. In farre meaner perſonages it may haue his effect in a meaſure. They alſo doing good for their degrees liberally, hartily, and throughly, not ſparingly and pinchingly. Agayne wee may ſee the vſe of Charets in thoſe dayes, for neceſſity, not for pompe and pride, where the iourney is ſmall, the way eaſie, and the body ſtrong. That vſe then warranted them, and ſuch vſe now condemneth them, if it bee ſo. Let therefore neceſſity haue her lawfull helpes, but let not pride and vanitye bee cheriſhed and maintayned. Laſtly, in the King it was moſt Honourable ſo to loue his true Seruant that for his ſake hee loued all his frendes, yet not onely loued them, but thus loued them that hee would bee a Father to them and theirs in this meaſure, and in this extremitie of famine and dearth. Happy Ioſeph whoſe faythfull ſeruice found ſo gracious regarde, and worthy Pharao of a faythfull ſeruant as euer was any Prince that we may reade of.
            
               7 Then did Ioſeph carefully diſpatch them according to ye kings commandement, &amp; ſent vnto his father alſo great comforts elſe as you ſee in the text, withal which prouiſiō they come to their Father home ſafe, and well euery one of them, and as all a fire with the comfort of their tidinges they tell their Father, Ioſeph is yet aliue, ſpeaking as it ſhould ſeeme euen all together leaſt any ſhould preuent another in ſo ſweete newes. Abruptly alſo and haſtely their ſpeech ſeemeth to haue beene made, which argueth the heate of their hartes and their affections all troubled with theſe ſtrange euentes. Iacob a good man on the other ſide, hearing theſe wordes, betwixt hope and feare, is all daunted and amaſed, ſo that his hart fayled (ſayth the Text. GOD knew his Hart, when hee heard of Ioſeph to liue: and yet afeard hee is leaſt ſo ſweete a tydinge ſhould not bee true. Euen as vſually ſtill wee ſee it fall out, that happy newes are hardly credited, for feare of the Prouerbe: Too good to bee true.

                But when hee ſawe the Charrets that Ioſeph had ſent to carrye him, then the Spirit of Iacob reuiued. Such aſſurance haue deedes aboue wordes

alwayes. The Phraſe of his ſpirite reuiuing, may put vs in minde of the effect of ſorrow, euen killing as it were the harts and mindes and ſpirites of men, as alſo of the nature of comfort and ioy, to reuiue agayne what ſorrow ſo had daunted and euen ouercome.
            
               8 Then Iacob ſayd, I haue ynough that Ioſeph my ſonne is yet aliue, neuer making any mention of his honour, where a man would haue thought hee ſhould haue gloried in that. No,
                  Life more to be ioyed in thē honor.
                no, the life of his Childe is that, which chereth him aboue the whole Worlde, and therefore of that hee ſpeaketh. Teaching vs that naturall Parentes doe greatly ioy to haue their Children liuing, though they haue no honour nor dignitie in the World. Yet not vnthankefull to God, if that alſo be added, as Iacob aſſuredly was not here. Would GOD Children were in like ſort affected to them agayne, ioying in their liues and deaths more than in any honors or worldly poſſeſſions that they are indewed withall bee they neuer ſo great. Surely both dutie and nature would it, if God were in vs. Then ſaith Iacob, I will goe downe and ſee him yet ere I die. Teaching vs, the nature of faythfull Loue, it coueteth ſight,
                  Frendes ſhould meet together.
                and comfortable ſocietie in the preſence of thoſe whom in Hart and minde wee doe both loue and affecte, and contenteth not it ſelfe wholly with hearing that they are aliue. Such longe and liked abſence then of Parentes from Children, and Children from Parentes, and one Friende from another, ſheweth froſen affections is not at all dryed vp and quite decayed. Iacob was nowe aboute an hundred and thirtie yeres olde, and yet hee will take this long iourney to ſee his Child, cutting the Throte by this his example of all ſuch ſeely excuſes as wee vſe to keepe our ſelues out of one an others companie. Surely Loue will creepe, if it can not goe, and tender Affection by one meanes or other will ſhewe it ſelfe. If ſo greate an age, ſo longe a Iourney, ſo many difficulties, as might haue beene obiected in this remoue, can not hinder Iacob, what can hinder the Harte that loueth from ſometimes viſiting his affected Frendes, and bleſſing God

euen together for his giuen comfortes. Here is then a ſweet alteration of Iacobs eſtate, and euen ſodenly. So ſweete is GOD.
         
         
            Chap. 46. 
            
               Then followeth this Chapter, wherein wee haue layd downe:

                     The preparation of this old man with all his to his iourney.
                     The maner of their going.
                     The number of perſons that went.
                     And how they were all receiued in Egypt.
                  
               
            
            
               
                  THen Iſrael tooke his iorney (ſaith the Story) with all that he had, &amp; came to Beer-ſheba,
               
                  Verſ. 1.
                  
                
               and offered ſacrifyce vnto the God of his father Iſaak. Whereby hee ſignifyed, that with moſt thankefull hart hee ſaw the greate goodneſſe of God towardes both him and his, and that he kept in his breaſt the poſſeſſion of that land from whence preſent neceſſitie droue him. Yea by this example hee moſt effectually taught, that both iourneis and all other buſines whatſoeuer ſhould bee vndertaken with prayer and ſeruice of God. Since a good beginning hath a good ende following in Gods gracious bleſſing.
            
               2 Then GOD ſpake vnto him in a viſion by night, &amp;c. where we ſee &amp; learne that neuer commeth man or woman to the Lord in true duty, but he is ready to giue care &amp; to anſwer in vnſpeakeable mercy. Iacob in all likelihood had beſought GOD to proſper his iourney, and to bee his protection againſt all daungers, and the Lord is ready to aſſure him of

his deſire with moſt ſweete comfort. Followe wee then Iacobs practiſe, and expect in faith not wauering, Iacobs bleſſing.
            
               3 No ſooner had God ſayde, Iacob, Iacob, but hee anſwered and ſayd,
                  Gods childrē are ready to heare when their father ſpeaketh.
                I am here, being preſt and ready with all reuerent attention to heare what his GOD ſhoulde ſay vnto him, and to follow the ſame with all faythfull obedience. Such readineſſe becommeth Gods Children well euen at this Day in the Church where GOD ſpeaketh, and with that Hart, to come and to ſitte mee downe is a holy obedience to the Lord,
                  Thinke of this.
                thinking with my ſelfe in this ſort. O Lord, this is thyne Ordinance, by thy word Preached to inſtruct thy people of thy will. Here Lord then am I in all humble feare to heare thy bleſſed pleaſure, what this day it ſhall pleaſe thee to put in the mouth of thy Seruant,
                  Abſence frō church.
                the Miniſter by whom thou ſpeakeſt to vs, to deliuer. Lord guide him, and Lord frame mee to all profite and good in this thing: Here I am, therefore ſpeake on Lord, thy ſeruant heareth. This cannot they ſay, that dull and dead in their inward feeling eſteeme of the Miniſterie of the word, as of a matter of courſe and human pollicie to keepe people in obedience, and no otherwiſe: therefore abſenting themſelues from it, and ſeldome or neuer ſetting themſelues in this holy manner to heare the Lord ſpeake his good pleaſure to them. But let vs bee wiſe and learne of Iacob, if they will be wilfull and witleſſe both, what remedye? I am here Lord is a ſpeech for a Childe of GOD, when I am in the Fieldes with my Cattell, in my Houſe with my Cofer, or in the Tauerne with my like, is a Speech of a wicked Worldling, that ſauoureth not the thinges which are of GOD, as one day they ſhall knowe, when it may bee too late to repent their follie, and to call agayne yeſterday. That GOD that is able, rent our hartes and giue vs feeling, I beſeech him.
            
               
                  Verſ. 3.
                  
               
               4 Then ſaid the Lord, I am God, the God of thy Father, feare not to goe downe into Egypt,
               
                  The ſweet care of God for his children.
                
               for I will there make

of thee a great nation. I will go downe with thee into Egypt, and will alſo bring thee backe againe, &amp;c. Here is the mercie of a ſwéete God, and here is the ſtaffe and ſtay of all godlie hearts. Mercie, that thus ſwéetlie he would comfort his olde ſeruant now worne and wearied with a wicked world, aſſuring him of his hand, fauour, and helpe in all this iourney, then the which what could the heart of a man wiſh more. The ſtay of all men in their buſineſſe whatſoeuer, euen the Lorde,
                  The true ſtay of a man euer.
                the Lord, and none but the Lord. For marke I pray you, how God draweth Iacobs eies from looking vpon Ioſephs honour and credite in the land whither now he was going, or yet vpon the king that ſo graciouſly had commanded to ſend for them, and his heart from truſting in theſe things, vnto himſelfe and his protection, prouidence, &amp; power, ſaying, I wil go with thee, and I will bring thee thither, and backe againe in thy poſteritie: as if he ſhould haue ſayd, this is thy ſafetie, this is thy ſtay and ſtaffe that will hold, my preſence with thée, and my prouidence for thée, not thy ſonnes great honour, though in déed it be great, nor yet the kings fauour, though indeed verie gracious. If we haue eares to heare then, let vs heare, and whatſoeuer comforts God graunteth vs in this worlde, of friends, or children, yea of princes themſelues, yet let our ankerhold be the Lord, and none but he, knowing that with him theſe comforts ſhall profite vs, and without him faile vs, as moſt fickle and vncertain things, euen happily then when we would be moſt glad to enioy and haue them, I, I will be with thee, is a worde of truſt, and let it euer be looked to of vs.
            
               5 Further goeth the Lord with Iacob,
               
                  To cloſe the eies of our dead friēds.
                and telleth him that Ioſeph ſhould put his hand vpon his eies: that is, cloſe vp his eies when hee died. Where we learne the cuſtome of thoſe times to haue committed this matter to the chiefe of the kinred, or to one that was moſt deare to the partie dying. Wheras we now a dayes referre it ouer to ſome olde woman, and hard hearted keepers, voyd of loue, void of affection, and oftentimes void of honeſtie and good dealing, ether in this or other things concerning the kéeping of ſicke folkes, we our

ſelues being ſo tender, ſo weake, or rather in déed ſo wanton &amp; forgetfull of true loue and duetie, that we cannot abide to be preſent to the ende with thoſe that haue béene preſent with vs to our comfort, but giue them ouer and forſake them vnkindlie when wee ſhoulde ſhewe them our laſt loue and office with a faithfull heart, taking ſuch Chriſtian courage to vs in that reſpect as is néedefull. Wee may amende this fault by this example, and remember it euer that God maketh a matter of account of it here, that Iacob ſhould receiue this comfort alſo, euen to haue Ioſeph his ſonne to cloſe his eies. Then what God reckoneth of we may not thinke lightly of, neither wilfullie or careleſſelie withdrawe that from them whome wee ought to comfort with all due and good duties, which God himſelfe accompteth a comfort to the father, and a duetie in the childe. It is expreſſelie ſaid of yong Tobias that he buried his father and mother verie decentlie,
                  Tobit. vlt.
                comelie and orderlie, when they were dead, that euen by him alſo wee might thinke of theſe laſt dueties, and not careleſlie commit them ouer to others, whileſt we gréedilie, and beaſtlie regard their wordlie goods they leaue behind them, as too manie doe.
            
               
                  Verſe. 5.
                  
               
               6 In the Chapter followeth the maner of their going, and the perſons that went, whereof I néede not to ſtande, onelie wee muſt knowe that the perſons are numbred, and the number noted, that the accompliſhing of Gods promiſe might appeare but euen nowe noted, that in Egypt hee would make of him a great Nation. The perſons that went here,
                  Verſe. 27.
                  
                were in all but thréeſcore and tenne: the perſons that returned when God deliuered them out of Egypt, were ſixe hundred thouſand men of foote,
                  Exod. 12.37
                beſide children. Great therefore was the bleſſing of increaſe in this people, and true was the Lorde in his worde to Iacob. As true was he euer, and euer will bee in all his promiſes to his ſeruants. I come to the laſt poynt, which was their intertainment in the land of Egypt when they came Ioſeph (ſayeth the text) hauing intelligence of his fathers comming by Iudah, his brother ſent

vnto him for that purpoſe, made readie his Charet, and went vp to Goſhen to meete Iſrael his father,
               
                  Verſe: 29.
                  
                
               and preſented himſelfe vnto him. No honour then nor preferment euer ſo high can make Ioſeph forget his dutie to his aged father, but honour him he will vnto his end as a dutifull child, that by him to the worldes end all children might learne to doe the like. What was that that Salomon did to his mother, when he roſe to meete her, bowed himſelfe vnto her, called for a ſtoole,
                  2. King. 2.19.
                and placed her on his right hande, but euen a patterne of like grace and duetie in a vertuous childe. When Ioſeph was come vnto his father, O the fountains of affecton, how were they broken vp both in father &amp; ſon. There was claſping and cleauing one to another, wéeping and wringinng for ioy and comfort, that hardlie with drie eies anie preſent could beholde them. Ioſeph fell vppon his fathers necke, and wept vpon the ſame a good while not able to ſpeake, till his heart was eaſed by a ſtreame of teares. And doe you thinke the father wept not to beholde his ſonne? The ſonne of his loue, the ſonne of his deſires, whome ſo dearelie hee had bewayled, as one rent in péeces with ſome wilde beaſt, and nowe ſawe with his eyes to be aliue, and not onelie ſo, but in ſuch honour as to him and his hee might bee a father? God knewe his heart all full of affection, and what Rachell his mothers heart would haue beene if ſhee had liued to ſée this day. Well, both of them weepe out of all queſtion abundantlie, yet Iacob the father getteth the victorie ouer his paſſions firſt, and ſpeaketh to Ioſeph, but how ſpeaketh he? I warrant you, his woordes both for forme and matter ſauour of affection alſo. Nowe (ſayeth hee) let mee die, ſince I haue ſeene thy face,
               
                  Verſe. 30.
                  
                
               and that thou art yet aliue. What is this but heate, and moſt feruent loue in a kinde father. He nowe cares not for his life, hauing once he helde Ioſeph before his death. Such ſpeach vſed Simeon or not much vnlike, when hee had ſéene Chriſt, Nowe Lorde (ſayeth hee) let mee depart in peace, ſince mine eyes hath ſeene, &amp;c. Who can then tell the heartes of Parents. O that children may more and more thinke of them, and

requite them no worſe then Ioſeph did.
            
               7 Thus Ioſeph hauing done his duetie to his father, he remembreth himſelfe alſo towards the king, and telleth them that preſently he will to the king to giue him intelligence of their comming. Where we are to marke the titles which Ioſeph will adorne his kinred withall when he commeth to the king:
                  Ioſephs hū
                     ble mind not aſhamed of his kinreds meane eſtate.
                ſurelie he will tell him that they are ſheepheards: what, plaine ſhéepheards? Yea verelie no more painting and colouring will Ioſeph vſe, but confeſſe that they are ſhéepheards, and which is much more, he inſtructeth his brethren if the king ſhould call them, that they ſhould ſay, that not onlie they were ſo, but that their fathers before them liued alſo ſo. Where is this ſimplicitie nowe become in theſe proude and ſcornefull daies of ours, when euerie man almoſt if he come to anie place, is aſhamed of his parents and kindred if their condition be but meane, when we tumble, and toſſe, and rake vp old Records day and night to fetch it about, that wee may be gentlemen? Surelie it is gone, and our pride before wiſe men as ridiculous, as before a iuſt God it is ſinfull and odious. What if our parents be but meane, with others of our kindred, the more is Gods mercie and goodneſſe ſéene towards vs if we be exalted. And ſhall we grudge to the Lord the praiſe of his owne mercie in ſuch meaſure to vs, by dawbing and painting our friends out with ſuch antiquitie of bloud, ſuch deſcent and alliances, and I know not what, as may darken in ſome ſort the Lords doinge. Fie on 
                  •
               is ingratitude, and fie againe vpon this filthie pride. It is farre from Ioſephs ſpirit in whom this was vertue, neither to adorne his kinred with vaine colours, neither once to be aſhamed of them as they were. If we follow Ioſeph, wee follow him whom God loued, and euen for this his vertue in this place noteth and commendeth ſecretlie: If we follow the worlde, and vanitie of hautie minds, we take a courſe that hath no ſuch comfort either with God or good men. If a man ſée a péece of clay, know it to be clay, and eſtéeme it but as clay, doth he not wel? But if he take it to be golde, and eſtéeme it as golde, when in

deed it is but clay, is he not mad? So are theſe vanities that men ſo glorie in, of ſmal value, who ſo thinketh ſo of them, and ſo reputeth them he is wiſe, when others follies féeding but themſelues are laught at of others verie iuſtly.
            
               8 The more yet appeareth Ioſephs vertue. For euery ſheepkeeper (ſaith the text) was an abhomination to the Egyptian.
               
                  Verſe. 34.
                  
                And yet was not Ioſeph daunted with it, nor once goeth about to couer the matter. But his friends are to him ſtill as they ought to be, and the pride of the Egyptian hurteth himſelfe.
                  Proud hypocrits deſpiſe as vnholy who in Gods acceptance are holyer then them ſelues.
                What if the queſtion were aſked which of theſe two ſorts of people were the better in reſpect of Gods approbation, the Hebrues that were deſpiſed, or the Egyptiās that did deſpiſe, would you not ſay the Hebrues? Then we ſee they are not alwaies vnholie with God whom proude ſpirites eſteeme to be ſo, neither yet they ſo holie as they take themſelues, who in reſpect of themſelues eſtéeme others to be abhominable. This is but an olde trike of a tempting deuill, to make ſome people thinke both of themſelues better, and of others worſe then they ought, to eſtéeme of others as abhominable vnto them, when in déed rather they themſelues ſhould be ſo to the other. This practiſe of Satan, and power of his venom is too to manifeſt euen in our dayes, in ſuch as condemne our Church-méetings, our exerciſes of the worde and Sacraments, and whatſoeuer we do in compariſon of their owne ſuppoſed puritie. Of whom it may iuſtly be ſpoken that Auſten ſaid, Finxerunt ſe nimis iuſtos, cum totum vellent perturbare. They haue feined themſelues ouer holy, whē in this ſort they would trouble al.
                For vs who are ſo abhominable to them, let vs comfort our ſelues with the truth of our cauſe, and with this example of Gods people, whom yet God ſuffered thus to be iudged of by filthie Egyptians, knowing that in the end theſe proude cenſures ſhall hurt vs as much as this contempt in the Egyptians did the Hebrues, when it cauſed them to be placed in the land of Goſhen, which was the very beſt of the land of Egypt. Let this ſuffice of this Chapter.
         
         
            
            Chap. 47.
            
                The chiefe points of this Chapter are two.

                     The ſpeech of the king with Ioſephs brethren and father.
                     The extremitie of the famine.
                  
               
            
            
               
                  Verſe. 1.
                  
               
               TOuching the firſt it is ſaide that Ioſeph went to ye king to tell him of his friends comming,
                  Ioſephs modeſtie &amp; wiſdome.
                &amp; withall tooke with him fiue of his brethren, whom he preſented to the king, aſwell that the king might bee aſſured they were come as alſo ſée what maner of people they were. Wherein appeareth both the maieſty &amp; the wiſdom of Ioſeph that without the kings knowledge and expreſſe direction he would do nothing in this matter, though his fauor were great with the king,
                  Court flatterers.
                and verie extraordinarie, well-knowing what meaner places then Princes Courts giue▪ triall of, that manie are the whiſperers, flatterers, and maligners of them, who with anie ſpeciall fauour vſe to be regarded of the chiefe. Soone might they, and peraduenture ſoone would they haue incenſed the king, both againſt Ioſeph and his friends, if this courſe had not warilie beene taken. And what though the king before had giuen commaundement touching this matter, yet ſafe it was to haue direction againe in a matter of his owne, and of this nature to bring ſtrangers into a Princes land to inhabit the verie beſt place of the ſame. Who knowe the varietie of great mens mindes, and what mountaines priuie whiſperers can moue ſometime, when a man is not admitted to his anſwer, but condemned vnheard, will approue Ioſephs wiſedome and ſay it was neceſſarie. The king when he ſaw them aſked what trade they were of, taking it as certaine that they had ſome trade.
                  Verſe. 3.
                  
                So vnvſuall was it

then for men to be idle. But had he aſked manie a man in our dayes, there anſwer peraduenture would haue béene to ſeeke vnleſſe they ſhould haue anſwered that they vſed to walke from tauerne to tauerne with a white rodde in their hands to top Daſies withall. Theſe mens anſwere was not to ſeeke, but readily they tolde the king they were ſhéepheards, both they and their fathers, that is, men that liued by keeping and bréeding of cattell, a moſt profitable and good trade for the wealth and comfort of a land. Would God their example might worke with vs, to cauſe vs to abhorre this ſinfull idleneſſe the mother of infinite euils amongſt vs, and to buckle our ſelues to ſome profitable ſeruice to the common wealth Surely it is for the dead to reſt from their labours, and not for the liuing altogether. But many times I haue touched this matter, and therefore now no more.
            
               3 Then ſayd Pharaoh to Ioſeph, the land of Egypt is before thee,
               
                  Verſe. 6.
                  
                
               in the beſt place of the land make thy father and brethren dwell, &amp;c.
               
                  Moſt conſtant comforte to a true ſeruant
                We ſaw the kings gracious fauour to his faithful and true Ioſeph before, and now we ſée his conſtancie in the ſame. A moſt princelie vertue in him, and a moſt ſwéete incouragement to the hart of Ioſeph, as they know that wiſh and want. Bound was Ioſeph if he had had a thouſand bodies and minds to haue ſerued ſuch a maiſter with them all. Farewell Pharaoh thou king of Egypt, and liue being dead in the pennes of men whilleſt the world endureth for this clemencie. Be thou to all men a mirrour of ſweeteneſſe to faithfull ſeruants, and teach euen them that know more then thou didſt of Gods truth in this behalfe. Ioſeph praiſe thy lot alſo, and ſay thou hadſt mercie not alwaies found to ſerue ſuch a maiſter, ſo kind and ſo conſtant in fauour to the end, not onelie to thy ſelfe, but euen to all thy friends, O marueilous comfort.
            
               3 Not long after Ioſeph brought his old father alſo to ye king that he might ſée him. Who being come into preſence,
                  Peeuiſh denying to ſalute our brethren.
                ſaluted Pharaoh, or bleſſed him. Teaching vs therby how péeuiſh, not how zealous they be, that amongſt vs méeting them who

profeſſe the ſame truth, &amp; relie vpon the ſame God that themſelues ſéeme to do, yet wil not ſpeake to them a word leſt they ſhould be defiled by ſaluting thoſe that are not ſo factious (to ſay no worſe) as themſelues be. O learned ſkill. Iacob may ſalute Pharaoh of Egypt, and we may not ſay good morrow to a true profeſſor of the goſpel. But ſuch ſtraining at a gnat, and ſwallowing of a canull will one day haue his iudge, to whom I referre it with this little remembrance by the way.

Where we haue a comfort both againſt ſhorter life and more affliction then our fathers haue had if the Lorde ſo pleaſe to haue it. He dealing no otherwiſe in that with vs, then with Iacob his ſeruant. That he alſo calleth this life a pilgrimage, hath his profite euer to admoniſh vs of another place, and to plucke our affections from this ſinfull world.
                  Heb. 13.
                We haue not here an abiding citie, but muſt looke for one from aboue, ſetling our ſelues and our buſineſſe no otherwiſe in this worlde then becommeth pilgrimes that muſt along to another place. This do not many whoſe buildings and purchaſings,

               5 Then Ioſeph placed his father as Pharaoh had willed, and Ioſeph nouriſhed his father and his brethren, and all his fathers houſholde with bread, euen to the yong children. See the dutie of a godlie childe to his deare father, not to ſée him want the comfort of his abilitie anie waies during life. And ſee how cruellie Ioſeph now reuengeth his brethrens wrong done vnto him when he was yong. He nouriſheth them and theirs with comfortable foode during all the famine. Such remembrances of iniuries &amp; ſuch reuenges are in the godly ſtil,

and therefore let them weigh their eſtate that take ſuch bitter courſes as we daylie ſée, whether that ſpirite be in them that was in Ioſeph or no. Nay, are they like vnto farre worſe men then Ioſeph was for knowledge in the truth that moderateth reuenges? As vnto Antigonus, who hearing with his owne eares certain of the ſoldidurs ſpeake euil of him, neuer reuenged the matter, but patientlie endured it, and bad them either go further, or ſpeake ſofter leſt the king ſhould heare them: vnto Auguſtus Caeſar, who ſuffred one Timagenes a writer of hiſtorie, abuſing notoriouſly both him, his wife, and his whole familie, to liue neuertheleſſe, and to liue in good eſtate euen in Rome vnder him. If ſuch men as theſe thus gouerned their affections when they had wrong, may we carie the credites of chriſtian profeſſors, boiling in malice, hunting for reuenge, and euen breathing out ſlaughter againſt whome we diſlike, as we ſée at this day. What the Lorde hath ſaide againſt ſuch heates ſundry times in theſe notes I haue obſerued, and our ſelues full well know his diſlike of ſuch dealing. Nowe doe but thinke of him, that in wiſedome ſaide it. Parciús vtendum potestat

                  , quó ſemper ea vti poſsis. Sparingly ſhouldeſt thou vſe thy power that euer thou maiſt vſe it.
                That is reuenge little and liue long, &amp;c.
            
               6 The greatnes of the famine is laid downe &amp; noted by the effects of it. When it conſumed all the money in the land,
                  Verſe 13. &amp;c.
                and brought it to Pharaohs coffers: then all their cattell, being glad to giue them for food when their money was gone:
                  This famin ſheweth our bleſſing.
                thirdly all their land, and euen their bodies alſo, if he would ſo haue taken what they offered. What a ſpectacle is this of Gods power. what eaſilie he can do, and of his gratious fauour what yet hee doth not. Durum telum neceſsitas. A ſharpe dart is neede and want.
                And therefore a great mercie is plentie and ſtore. Where be our hearts to feele it, and to bleſſe God for it vſing it well to his glorie? But what when both money and cattell with land alſo were gone, &amp; all become Pharaohs? Sée then a wiſedome, and a fatherly mercie in Ioſeph. Then gaue he them ſéed to ſow their land, yeelding ye king but the fift part

and themſelues kéeping foure to their maintenance: wiſdom I ſay,
                  Mercifull dealing in Ioſeph when he had the vantage and could haue nipped.
                becauſe elſe the land ſhould haue beene waſt, and the foode as yet holding out would haue decaied: mercie, for that if ſome had had them at ſuch a liſt, they would haue rather taken foure parts and haue left them one, then quite contrarie as Ioſeph did. Mercie againe, in that he regardeth their wiues and children, &amp;c. That is, their charges, and according therevnto dealeth with them, and alloweth to them. Which is a thing they little thinke of that ſhaue to the bones,
                  A bleſſing vppon him for it.
                and grinde euen the faces of their tenants now adaies. What bleſſing alſo this kind dealing had in the hearts of the people the ſtorie noteth, when they thankefullie attributed the ſauing of their liues vnto him.

                  Verſe. 28.
                  
                and had poſſeſſions, hee liued in that lande ſeuentéene yeares, and ſawe his childrens children, he inioyed his ſonne Ioſeph in great honour, with Beniamin alſo whom he loued, yea, hee inioied them all placed about him, and liuing in vnitie, peace, and plentie. Sée then the comforts of god to his true ſeruant after many afflictions. God is not changed. Cleaue we therefore to him, and be euer ſhall diſpoſe vnto vs for the beſt. If we now weepe, he is able to make vs laugh, if we now grone vnder any burden, he is able to eaſe our ſhoulders from it in good time, and to comfort our later yéeres with a ſwéeter meaſure, as he here did Iacob. Remember the great calme that followed after their great daunger in the ſhippe.
                  Math. 8.
                Remember the wordes: you nowe are ſad,
                  Iohn. 16.
                but your ſorow ſhalbe turned into ioy. Remember the prophet: for a moment in mine anger I hid my face from thée for a litle ſeaſon:
                  Eſay. 54.8.
                but with euerlaſting mercy wil I haue compaſſion on thée, ſaith the Lord. Tobiah had his ſight againe, and ended in comfort, Iob had all well againe in the end, &amp; the lord bleſſed the laſt daies of Iob more then ye firſt.
                  Iob laſt.
                
               Dauid after manie troubles hath a crown of honor, &amp; Iacob hath his Ioſeph againe, that his ſpirit reuiueth. Ionas commeth vp againe all in ſafetie from the bottom of the ſea. Feare not affliction therefore, but refer all to God. He is not the god of theſe men alone but of vs alſo. All ſhalbe well in the Lords good time, al teares wiped away from our eies, and what he hath promiſed anie way, ſo true is he, ſo good is he, ſo himſelfe is he, and euer ſhall be. Here then might I ende, if it were not alſo worthie obſeruing how reuerentlie Iacob ſpeaketh to his ſon being in authoritie. If I now haue found grace in thy ſight, deale mercifully with me, &amp;c. Teaching hereby all parents to

for ſhewe of the ſame his vnwauering faith, and the confirmation of others, wiſhed and ſought that his bodie might thither be caried to take poſſeſſion till that tim came. Such faith in other of Gods promiſes concerning vs becommeth it vs euer to haue, and God in mercie giue it.

                In this Chapter two things eſpeciallie are laide downe.

                     The adoption of the ſonnes of Ioſeph to be Iacobs ſonnes.
                     The bleſſing that Iacob giueth them.
                  
               
            
            
               TIdings are brought vnto Ioſeph that his father was ſick.
                  Verſe. 1.
                  
                
               
                  The godlie are ſicke.
                Sicke then are the godlie when it pleaſeth God as well as others, and worne and waſted with diſeaſes and griefs, they paſſe away as other men. The Lord could do otherwiſe if it pleaſed him. But this courſe is beſt in his eies, that being as others appointed to die, they alſo as others ſhould haue theſe common meſſengers and forerunners of their death: that hereby receiuing as it were a watchworde that the time is neere,
                  The vſe of ſicknes.
                they might renounce the worlde with all the flattering and fading glorie thereof, they might lift vp their eies to the God of heauen and conſider the comfort of that companie. They might diſpoſe of their goodes and affaires of this worlde to the quiet peace of them that ſhall haue them. And laſtly, with more eaſe depart and make an end, the bodie being weakned and worne away by ſicknes that it cannot ſo ſtiffely ſtartle againſt that ſeparation. Ioſeph viſiteth his father in this his ſickneſſe, and taketh his two ſonnes with him, Manaſſes and Ephraim, ſtill ſhewing himſelfe in all things a comfortable, carefull and

obedient man towards his father, confuting alſo by his example that moſt ſinfull ſoftneſſe of ſome in our dayes,
                  Viſiting the ſicke.
                who can not abide to come at anie ſicke perſons, as though themſelues either neuer ſhould be ſicke, or being ſicke could reſt contented to lie by the walles, not comforted nor viſited of anie bodie. That with him he tooke his two ſonnes, he ſhewed that more highlie hee eſtéemed to haue his children receyued into Iacobs familie, which was the Church of God, then to inioy all the treaſures of Egypt.
            
               2 Then one told Iacob that his ſonne Ioſeph was come, &amp; Iſrael tooke his ſtrength vnto him,
               
                  Verſe. 2.
                  
                
               and ſate vpon the bed, &amp;c. Sée how the preſence of déere friends comforteth the ſick and grieued in their beds.
                  The ioye of frendes.
                It euen maketh their ſpirits reuiue, and their ſtrength to come againe, that they are able to ſpeake and deliuer matters as whole men. How may a friend then anſwer it to God or man, to denie ſuch comfort to the ſicke.
            
               
                  Verſe. 11.
                  
               
               3 Then Iacob called for Ioſephs children, kiſſed them &amp; imbraced them,
                  A moſt full feeling of Gods mercies to be wiſhed.
                and breaketh into theſe words: I had not thought to haue ſeene thy face, and behold God hath ſhewed me alſo thy ſeed. Shewing thereby what a full feeling he had in his hart of Gods infinite mercies vnto him, receiuing more then euer he could hope or looke for. Such, ſuch féeling ſhould we alſo haue in our eſtates euerie one of vs, weighing our caſe paſt weighing our caſe preſent, weighing what once was likelie, and what yet now we haue, what once we could not dreame of, and yet now by God is done, and riſing vp vpon it into all feruent feeling of a ſweete and gracious God, which hath ſo done for vs. This did Iacob here, and bleſſed he, this doe not ſome of vs, as may bee feared, and therefore ſinfull we. But now let vs amende, and write this ſaying of Iacob vpon our handes, that we maie euer ſée it. Ioſeph then tooke away his children from his fathers knees,
                  Verſe. 12.
                  
                and did reuerence downe to the grounde.
                  Reuerence to parents be we neuer ſo high.
                O dutifull childe, a verie patterne of all vertue and true affection to parents whileſt the world endureth. So great and ſo mightie, ſo honourable

and ſo high, yet to his father hee boweth, and doth reuerence euen to the ground, his father being but a ſhéepheard (as you heard before) that is, a man that liued by breeding and kéeping of cattell.
            
               4 Then Ioſeph tooke his two ſonnes,
               
                  Verſe. 13.
                  
                
               Ephraim in his right hand towards Iſraels left hand, and Manaſſes in his left hand towards Iſraels right hand, ſo he brought them vnto him. But Iſrael ſtretched out his right hand (croſſing his hands) and laid it on Ephraims head which was the yonger, and his left hand vpon Manaſſes head, directing his hands of purpoſe, for Manaſſes was the elder. Then he bleſſed them, giuing ſuch title to his father Abraham as I wiſh vs to marke, namelie that he walked with God. To teach vs not to delight ſo much either in honour, or prowes, or pollicie, or any thing in our ancetors,
                  The beſt prayſe of Anceſtors.
                as that they were religious and feared God. But this maner of his fathers hands diſpleaſed Ioſeph, &amp; he ſought to remoue them, telling his father that Manaſſes was the elder, &amp;c. Where we ſée a weaknes in good Ioſeph,
               
                  God not tied to naturall artes
                that he would go about to tie God vnto ſenioritie and naturall order, when as before that it had appeared how God diſpoſeth of his bleſſing to the yonger before the elder. As Iſmael being elder, yet Iſaac was bleſſed, Eſau being elder, yet Iacob was bleſſed, Ruben being elder, yet of Iudah came Chriſt, &amp;c. Now could Ioſeph a good man thus errs,
                  A good man deceyued.
                and thinke that amiſſe which his father did rightlie and euen of purpoſe, and may we no way be deceiued? I wiſh them then to conſider this who are ſo wiſe in their owne eyes that they neuer like of their miniſters courſe, but would gladly haue their owne deuiſes followed as euer the better. Surely it may teach them modeſtie, and humble their ſpirits if god will to thinke more reuerently of others, that for their places and diuers circumſtances are more like to ſée what is the beſt.
            
               5 But his father refuſed, &amp;c.
               
                  Verſe 19.
                  
                Then father and ſonne deuided in a matter of ceremonie, the father one way,
                  Good men diuerſly minded in a matter of ceremonie.
                the ſonne an other, yet both godlie. Let it ſchool
                  •
                vs euer to knowe what may be without breach of vnitie and common peace if men

themſelues be louers of peace. Yet remember alſo that olde Iacob had the right, and yong Ioſeph was deceiued. If father and ſonne then may differ, brethren alſo may do the like. But yet go further.
                  We oppoſe our ſelues euen to God.
                We learne not onely by this example the difference often that is betwixt men of néere coniunction, but we may take occaſion alſo by it to thinke how we differ often euen from God, ſetting our ſelues as it were againſt him, and eſteeming that better that in déed is not. As when we are gouerned in matters of ſaluation by the iudgement rather of fleſh and bloud, then by the ſpirit that ſeeth truth. If he laie the right hand, we wiſh the left hand, and if be lay the left hand, we like the right: what hee thinks good wee iudge euill, and what he makes euill we make good. Know this corruption which is too true, and then begging ſtrength let vs ſéeke to amend it. The Lord gaue Iacob a prophecying ſpirit, to declare to them what was to come. And no little accompt in thoſe daies made godlie children to be bleſſed of their fathers. What Iacob tolde alſo came all to paſſe, Ephraim was the greater, and yet both great. His name was likewiſe named vpon them,

                that is, they were taken and reputed as his children, and not he praied vnto when he was dead by his poſteritie, as moſt fooliſhlie Papiſts would reaſon herehence. His aſſurance that he giueth them of the lande of Canaan, was grounded vppon the ſundrie immutable promiſes of God, which he beléeued. That god ſhould be with them when he was dead, reſpected the promiſe that is alſo our comfort: I will bee thy God and the God of thy ſeede after thee. The portion that he giueth him aboue his brethren,
                  How ancient to make a teſtament
                giueth teſtimonie how ancient it is to make a teſtament concerning worldlie goodes when die we muſt. Finallie, that he ſpeaketh of his dying ſo comfortablie, and without anie feare, it teacheth vs the effect of a liuely faith, how mightily it expelleth all feare of death. Thus ended this conference of ſicke Iacob with his ſonne Ioſeph: and thus end we alſo for this time.

This Cignea cantio, this laſt ſweet ſong of Iacob becauſe interpreters haue ſeen to be amoſt ſingular propheſie of thinges to come, they haue thought yt they did not adorne and ſet out ſufficiently, vnleſſe they deuiſed ſome hydden myſteries, and dark matter to be drawen out of it, ſwaruing for this purpoſe from the true and naturall ſence of it in diuers thinges. I will omit theſe dreames of theirs and kepe to the Text, with ſuch matter as it properly and truely yeldeth. Praying it firſt to be obſerued,
                  The end of this prophecye.
                how by their father Iacob it pleaſed almighty God to informe theſe men of whom thouſands after were to come concerning their future eſtate, that they might

hereby know &amp; be moſt aſſured, yt God cared for them, &amp; not only ſo, but that moſt extraordinarily hee cared for them, gouerning them as his owne peculiar people choſen from the whole world &amp; made his own. If you aſke or think how could Moſes yt wrote theſe bookes know of this ſpeech of Iacob to his ſonnes being made in a priuat houſe, in a place but obſcure, &amp; about 200. yeres before he wrote. Anſwer your ſelfe with another queſtion again &amp; aſke how could he ſo cunningly and ſo particularly deſcribe the land of Canaan, bordering it, and diſtributing it vnto ſome as he did,
                  Num. 34.
                himſelfe dying, and neuer entring into it: &amp; if you muſt ſay, by Gods ſpirit illuminating, guiding and directing him he did this (as in deede you muſt ſay) why not then did the ſame ſpirit reueile vnto him being a choſen inſtrument to commit theſe matters to writing, what Iacob ſaid at his later end to his children? Yet probable alſo it is, that ſo famous a prophecie as this, and at that time made whē mens words are eſpecially marked, to wit, at their deathes, &amp; before ſo many witneſſes, was right carefully remembred, and by tradition caried from man to man, &amp; from time to time, euen vnto Moſes. It containeth in it the whole time from their going out of Egypt vnto ye comming of Chriſt, as by diligent obſeruance may appeare, not I meane euery particular accident in that time,

So noteth this repetition vſually in the ſcripture, as in the Pſalme,

in them this attention which he requireth, ye one of nature, the other of religion: of nature, becauſe he was Iacob their father, of religion, becauſe fearing God truly, &amp; ſeruing him euer, he found fauour with God euen ſo far, as to receiue from him this name of Iſrael, whereof you haue heard before the full circumſtance.

               becauſe thou wēteſt vp to thy fathers bed, then diddeſt thou defile my bed, thy dignity is gone. Comming now to particulars he beginneth with his eldeſt ſon, &amp; as you ſee often repeateth his excellēcy, making great mention of it, that he was his might, ye beginning of his ſtrength, ye excellency of dignity, &amp; the excellency of power, in the end throweth him out of all, ſaying he ſhould not be excellent, his dignity was gone. And why thus? becauſe he had ſinned agaynſt nature, &amp; defiled his fathers bed. Then al theſe repetitions of his dignity tē
               ded but to this: to exaggerat his fault and to make it appear vnto his cōſcience &amp; the poſterity euer after, how great it was and foule before God, as for which all this dignity was loſt &amp; taken away: Nothing more ſhaketh the hart of any one, not quite dead to God &amp; grace then this courſe. Therefore often God vſeth it in his word. Heare O heauēs, ſaith he by the prophet, &amp; hearkē o earth,
                     Eſay. 1.2.
                   I haue nouriſhed &amp; brought vp children, but they haue rebelled againſt me. The Oxe knoweth his owner, &amp; the aſſe his maiſters cribbe, but Iſrael hath not knowen me, my people hath not vnderſtood, amplifying their ſin by this that they had receiued this dignity to bee nouriſhed of him, and brought vp as his Children. In the fifth Chapter agayne, my beloueds Vineyarde was in a fruitfull grounde, hedged about, the ſtones gathered out, planted with the beſt plantes, a Towre built, and a wine preſſe made, yet it brought forth wild grapes:
                  2 Sam. 12 7. &amp; 8.
                To Dauid likewiſe I anointed thee king ouer Iſrael, and deliuered thee out of the hand of Saul, gaue thy Lords houſe, and thy Lordes Wiues into thy boſome, gaue thee the houſe of Iſrael and Iudah, and would moreouer, if that had been too litle haue giuen thee ſuch &amp; ſuch thinges: wherefore then haſt thou deſpiſed, &amp;c.
               
Still proouing the greatnes of ſin by grace and fauour vouchſafed before. So here Ruben being vouchſafed of God to be his fathers firſt borne, his might, the beginning of his ſtrength, the excellencie of dignitie, and the excellency of power, &amp; yet ſinning in this ſort, his fault by theſe fauours was made moſt great, and therefore his dignitie and the ſequels of his dignity moſt iuſtly tranſlated otherwiſe.
                  Gen. 49.26.

                  Note.
                Take we heede then of ſinning euer, but eſpecially when our conſciences tell vs God hath beene gracious, gracious vnto Bodye, and gracious to Soule, gracious to our ſelues, and gracious to our friendes. For this is as the dignitie of Ruben which ſhall increaſe our offence, and iuſtly plucke downe from the hand of God a verye ſure and certaine puniſhment vppon vs, and happily euen alſo vpon our poſterity as here in Rubē, whoſe whole ofſpring was depriued of honor. There is not one of vs but hath receiued mercy from heauen in verye great meaſure, if wee bee aliue within to feele it. Therefore not one of vs, but euen in this reſpect bound with a carefull hart to auoide the thing that offendeth God. And happy wee if wee will doe it, remembring Ruben here and his fearefull loſſe, his dignitie being gone, as his Father ſayth.

                  The vſe of Gods' puniſhments to the godly.
                euen to humble themſelues in themſelues, and to teach poſteritie how God hateth euill. The Papiſtes prattle of poena and culpa, that the puniſhment ſatiſfieth for the offence &amp;c. But farre otherwiſe doth the Word inſtruct,
                  Eſay, 53
                telling vs euer that puniſhment is not impoſed to make ſatiſfaction (for that onely doth Ieſus Chriſt and his ſtripes)

but to purge the hart from all hypocriſie, humbling it faythfully and vnfaynedly, and to ſtirre vp to repentance for ye time paſſed, as alſo to carefulnes for the time to come, keping both body and ſoule in a godly feare as it were with a bridle. Therfore ſaith the father as you haue heard before. Quod patimur vnde plangimus, medicina eſt, non poena, caſtigatio▪ non damnatio. That wee ſuffer puniſhment, it is a medicine not a puniſhment, a correction, not a damnation. Non enim de peccatis ſumit ſupplicium, ſed in futurum nos corrigit. For God doth not take puniſhment of our ſinnes (forgiuen) but chaſtiſeth vs fatherly for the time to come. Marke alſo in this place how fully, how plainly, how faithfully Moſes layeth downe to the world in writing ye ſhame &amp; reproch of the tribe he came of, of his father Leui:
                  An arg. of the ſcripture to be giuen by inſpiration.
                which certainly declareth the power of Gods ſpirit ruling &amp; ouerruling in theſe writinges, and that of him &amp; from him, not from fleſh and bloud they are proceeded: for fleſh &amp; nature would haue couered theſe blemiſhes in his aunceſtors.

was not Iudah alſo faulty when he lay with Thamar his daughter in lawe, as we heard before? how happeneth it then that Iacob ſo ſharpely reprouing Rubē, Simeon &amp; Leui paſſeth ouer in ſilence thus Iudah his fault and ſpeaketh of nothing but bleſſings vnto him? Surely this thing was of God yt we might therby learne that ſometimes he euen paſſeth ouer and couereth the faults of his choſen in ſweete mercy as at other times he openly toucheth them in vnblameable iuſtice. That in Iacob alſo we might take a leſſon not euer to publiſh whatſoeuer we know. The diſcretion of a man paſſeth by an offence &amp; the ſame againe at other times doth it not: there are times to ſpeake, &amp; times to be ſilent, which this guider of Iacob here wil alſo direct his ſeruāts vnto as ſhalbe fit, ye hartely in prayer &amp; for his glory beg ye ſame.

                  Craft and ſecret cunning.
                ſo that his rider ſhall fall backward, though openly and by hand ſtripes (as wee ſay) he be not able to encounter or to do any great matter. Subtill ſecret byters then and workers of their will by pollicy, craft, and cunning are hereby noted and reſembled. Outwardly and openly they doe little, but couertly and craftily they are like Serpentes by the pathe, ſo byting the heeles (not the head) of the Horſe, that in the ende the rider is ouerthrowen and falleth backwarde, as well as if openly hee had beene encountred, and peraduenture rather. So ouer-reacheth hidden guile, when a man thinketh not of it.

That is, this tribe ſhall be giuen to humanitie, to ſweet ſpeech, and by peaceable meanes rather than by force of armes to defend themſelues, and to haue their being and ſtay in the world. A courſe certainly not without great power, though it ſeeme outwardly to be weak. What more perceth thā a ſmoth tounge?

                What the Towne-clarke did in the vprore of Epheſus, we ſee in the Actes of the Apoſtles. Other examples we may remember many. The ſaying is old and true,

                If a man will catch Birdes he may not come towardes them with a ſtaffe. But Fiſtula dulcè canit volucres dum decipit auceps. The Pipe goeth ſweetly whileſt they are deceiued: what daily experience ſheweth I neede not tell. But thinke you whether the ſmiling Sunne, or the bluſtring winde, wil cauſe you to laie downe your cloake firſt,
                  Note:
                ſurely with his kinde beames he wil take both your cloake &amp; your coate from you, when the others puffes doth make you hold all harder. Great therefore is the power of a ſweete tongue. It comforteth the afflicted, it healeth the ſicke, it cheareth the poore, it ruleth the rich, it winneth the ſubiect, it appeaſeth the King, and whatſoeuer it will haue, it getteth in the ende, neither anger nor ſtrength can reſiſt the force of it. Marke therefore well the bleſſing of Nepthali here in this place, and know it to bee a bleſſing being vſed well, that hee ſhall be a Hinde let goe, giuing goodly wordes.

                  Ioſeph.
                Great and comfortable is the bleſſing of Ioſeph in many verſes, which being ſufficiently lightened with the marginall notes in the Bible, I referre you to them and pray you to marke them. Beniamin is the laſt, and of him ſaith his father, He ſhall rauine as a Woolfe,
               
                  Beniamin.
                
               in the morning he ſhall deuoure the praie, and at night he ſhall diuide the ſpoyle. Meaning that of him ſhould come a ſeede which ſhould bee giuen to ſpoyle and to liue thereby. So goeth not this bleſſing by affection and fauour, but Iacob by the ſpirite ſpeaketh what hee muſt, bee hee neuer ſo deare. So were theſe twelue Tribes bleſſed of their father with

ſeuerall bleſſings, Whereof if ſome ſeeme hard bleſſings vnto vs▪ we muſt remember, that foraſmuch as they hindred nothing the couenant, but notwithſtanding them, they were all Patriarkes, euen them that were ſharplieſt ſpoken vnto, as Ruben, Simeon, and Leui,
               
                  Croſſes be bleſſings.
                
               &amp;c. Therefore in deed and truth they were bleſſed, as daily yet it may be ſayd, that foraſmuch as the croſſes, puniſhments, and afflictions of Gods children be ſo farre from hindring their felicitie in heauen, as that vſually they be helpes and furtherances thereunto, therefore euen in the middeſt of them and in the thickeſt of them, they may be ſayd to be bleſſed, yea with them and for them, I meane for that God thus vouchſafeth to chaſten them in the world, to the end they may not be condemned with the world. Blood-letting making for health is not an euil, but a good, and ſo worldly croſſes leading to God chaunge their nature, and become no curſes but bleſſings to the godly. What a faith had Iacob here ſo farre to ſee, and ſo chearfully to hope? Let it teach vs to ſee and expect with comfort what God hath promiſed &amp; wil truly performe.

conſtantly he belieued God, that that land ſhould be giuen in time to his ſeede▪ as that dead hee would take poſſeſſion of it with his fathers, and thereby incourage his poſteritie vnto like hope, patiently paſſing on towards the time, as became their knowledge. Iacob then dieth a ſweete death: he plucked vp his feete hauing thus ſpoken and gaue vp the Ghoſt. Many were his croſſes whileſt he liued as you wel know, yet thus he endeth and endeth them Our time muſt come and who knoweth how ſoone.

But mee thinke I heare you obiect againſt this, the example of our Sauiour in the Goſpel: who ſaid to his Diſciple ſeeking leaue to goe firſt and bury his father:
                  Obiection
                follow me, and let the dead bury their dead. 
                  Answere 1 But remember there the office that then that Diſciple was choſen vnto,

               5 There went with Ioſeph to the buriall, all the ſeruants of Pharaoh, both the Elders of his houſe, and all the Elders of the lande of Egypt. Theſe for honour. Likewiſe all the houſe of Ioſeph and his brethren and his fathers houſe. Theſe for nature and aliance. Laſtly Charets and Horſemen not a fewe, and theſe for ſecuritie. So the company in all was exceeding great. And as their company ſo was their mourning alſo paſſing great, ſo that both the inhabitants of the lande wondred at it, and the place receiued a name thereof, the lamention of the Egyptians. So his ſonnes did vnto him according as he had commanded them.

See it alſo how parents liues keep many things ſtreight that either goe awry or are feared, as likely when they bee gone. Eſau wil hold while his father liueth, but when once hee is gone, haue at Iacob his brother for a reuenge. Small cauſe there is then why children ſo egerly ſhould wiſh their ends, ſince their life keepeth out much contention and euil. Their meſſage to Ioſeph was but feined, and ſo appeared ſince eaſily it might be thought, that if Iacob had feared any ſuch thing, he would haue carefully ſpoken of it to Ioſeph himſelfe in his life time. But let vs learne by it, that an vntruth wilbe peering out one way or other to ſhame vs if we vſe it, and therefore take heede. The argument they vſe to moue him to mercy would bee obſerued, to wit, becauſe they were ſeruants of his fathers God.

feare. Yea he maketh arguments vnto them, and by proofes wil haue their heartes aſſured that they neede not doubt. Am not I vnder God ſaith hee: that is, doo not I feare God and therefore cannot deale hardly with you beeing my brethren, or am not I vnder God, that is, can I or may I goe about to reuenge that which God remitteth and forgiueth being vnder him, but by the ſucceſſe of things, it appeareth that God hath forgiuen you, therfore farre be it from me to controll the doings of his maieſtie. O that I were able with word or wiſh, with ſpeech or prayer, to effect in ſome the ſequeale of this argument, wee know how many times offences grow amongſt vs, and how many times ſome being ſory for their faultes, ſeeke to ſatiſfie them whom they haue grieued, with an vnfeined hart. But it wil not be taken, Reuenge, reuenge cryeth the ſpirit of venome, and leaue him not whileſt he is woorth a groat. Would that man now beholde heere Ioſeph, might he not learne, that if he feare God hee muſt forgiue, yea he wil forgiue? Or if you take it in the other ſenſe, that in reuenging that which God forgiueth. he profeſſeth openly that hee taketh not himſelfe to be vnder God. Now what a man is ſory for and willing to make amendes for, God forgiueth, if therefore man wil not, that man proudly exalteth himſelfe aboue God, in controwling his doings, and in puniſhing that which hee remitteth: which if it bee horrible in duſt and aſhes, then let that perſon knowe that the Lorde will awake though hee ſeeme to ſleepe, and beat that bitter ſtomacke euen with yron roddes, till hee haue taught it to ſtoupe to both him and his. O looke we therfore vpon Ioſeph euer, and when ſight of miſdooing moueth the grieued neighbour or friend to ſay forgiue, then aunſwere with Ioſeph in holy wordes, Am not I vnder God? That is, my brother, my friend, I ſee by this ſorrow that God hath forgiuen, and if I ſhould keepe, I ſhould make my ſelfe aboue and not vnder God, which farre be from mee. Therefore feare not, I forgiue and forget, and all is wel. The verie bones of Ioſephes brethren reioyced at his clemencye and kinde nature, no doubt bleſſed him, and bleſſed God for him, and ſo for you if you doo the lyke. Am not I vnder God? O ſpeech of a gratious heart, I cannot make an ende to thinke of it. But I muſt be ruled. Let

me remember you therefore of his ſecond argument. Why ſaith hee ſhould I bee angry with you, ſince what you did euill the Lorde hath turned to good, and to the ſauing of many liues. No no. I wil looke vpon him and not vpon you, and his mercy ſhall blotte out your offence. Therefore whileſt that is in mine eye whiche I truſt ſhal neuer from eye, whileſt I haue an eye, feare not I may not, I cannot I wil not hurt you.

               No I will nouriſh you and your children. And this ſhalbe an argument vnto you without all doubt, that I am your brother ſtil in all loue and nature of a kinde brother. Thus did hee cheare them and euen make them to liue, who were lyke dead men before him for feare. This laſt argument is woorthie marking, namely, that by his deedes of loue to them, hee would ſhewe that he had forgiuen them. Should our forgiuenes be meaſured by this rule, would it ſhewe well? God knoweth all, and the worlde ſeeth this, that the tongue ſaying we haue forgiuen, yet our hande ho

Sweet Ioſeph then ſweet are thy words, and ſweet are thy deeds, true is thy loue and thy fauour faithfull,

So dealeth God with his choſen when he wil, and hee wil when to them it may be good. Be it therefore with vs as hee pleaſeth, and that is beſt for vs. If we liue yet he muſt bleſſe, and if we dye, yet neither hee nor that power in him dieth to be fauourable to our ſeede, and to bleſſe them in mercy when we are gone. His promiſe alſo is paſt alreadie, I wilbe thy God and the God of thy ſeede after thee: and what would we more, if our conſciences tel vs we are in this couenant.
            Laſtly, Ioſeph dieth alſo, and taketh an oath of his brethren, to remoue his bones when God ſhould viſite them by deliuering them out of Egypt, to carry them to the land of promiſe. Wher in his faith as his fathers before him did appeare, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth to the Hebrewes. Their faithfulneſſe in ſo doing, when they remoued we ſee in Exodus. Thus ended Ioſeph the renowned ſeruant of God, the faithful ſeruant of his Lord and maiſter, and the nourcing father of all his kindred, with him endes this booke, and with it my labour, which to the Lord of mercy I moſt humbly now commend, that it may finde a bleſſing with him, to the glory of his name, to the comfort of his people, and to the mouing of others: whoſe leiſure is greater, &amp; whoſe gifts be better to conſider what wanteth to a multitude in this land, and to relieue them according to their reaches. Praying thee alſo good Chriſtian reader, to whom there may be any vſe of this my poore labor to goe forward with thy holy exerciſe of reading the ſcriptures, to take thy bible into thy hands anew, and euer when thou haſt read a Chapter, to read theſe notes ouer vpon the ſame, and to conferre them with the text. And if thus both thy feeling and comfort increaſe, to bleſſe God the authour of all mercies, and namely of this, and to pray for him truly who loueth thee hartely, and ſhall ſo continue.
            FINIS.
