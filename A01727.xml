            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

            14 What auaileth it, my brethren,
though a man ſaith he hath faith, when
he hath no works? can that ſaith ſaue
him.
            15 For if a brother or a ſiſter be naked
and deſtitute of daily foode.
            16 And one of you ſay vnto them,
Depart in peace, warme your ſelues, &amp;
fill your bellies: notwithſtanding yee
giue them not thoſe things which are
needfull to the body, what helpeth it?
            17 Euen ſo the faith, if it haue no
works, is dead in it ſelfe.
            18 But ſome man might ſay, Thou
haſt the faith, and I haue works: ſhew
me thy faith out of thy workes, and I
wil ſhew thee my faith by my works.
            19 Thou beleeueſt that there is
one God: thou doeſt well: the diuels alſo
beleeue it, and tremble.
            20 But wilt thou vnderſtand, O
thou vaine man, that the faith which is
without works, is dead?
            21 Was not Abraham our Father

iuſtified through works, when he offered
Iſaac his ſonne vpon the Altar?
            22 Seeſt thou not that the faith
wrought with his works? and through
the works was the faith made perfect.
            23 And the Scripture was fulfilled
which ſaith, Abraham beleeued
God, &amp; it was imputed vnto him for
righteouſneſſe: &amp; hee was called the
friend of God.
            24 Ye ſee then how that of works
a man is iuſtified, &amp; not of faith only.
            25 Likewiſe alſo was not Rahab
the harlot iuſtified through workes,
when ſhe had receiued the meſſengers,
and ſent them out another way?
            26 For as the body without the
ſpirit is dead, euen ſo the faith without
works is dead.

               I Haue choſen this portion
of Scripture to
interpret, becauſe there
is very great vſe and
commoditie in the true
&amp; right vnderſtanding
thereof: and the doctrine therein contained,
is moſt neceſſarye for all Chriſtians
to knowe. Firſt, becauſe it doth directly
and fully ouerthrowe and beate
downe all carnall profeſſion of the Goſpell,
ſhewing that the common and dead
faith cannot ſaue a man. Secondly, becauſe
it is the principall pillar which
the Papiſts doe leane vnto, &amp; the chiefe
place of Scripture which they doe peruert
and abuſe, to proue and eſtabliſh
Iuſtification by workes, and the merits
of men, &amp; to ouerthrow the free iuſtification

we haue in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
through faith. The holde which they
take in this point, is vpon the ſpeaches
and phraſes which the Apoſtle doth vſe:
as when he ſaith, Abraham our Father
was iuſtified through works. Alſo Rahab
the harlot was iuſtified through
works. Likewiſe ye ſée ye of workes a
man is iuſtified and not of faith onely?
Héerein ye two Apoſtles of Chriſt, S.
Paul &amp; S. Iames do ſéeme to be flat contrary
ye one to the other: for wheras S.
Paule ſaith, Abraham was iuſtified by
faith alone and not by workes. Saint
Iames ſaith he was iuſtified by works.
Saint Paule ſaith and proueth by ſundrie
and inuincible reaſons, that a man
is iuſtified by faith alone without the
works of the lawe. Saint Iames ſaith
ye ſée that a man is iuſtified by works
and not by faith onely: This contrarietie
is but in appearaunce: for they
both wrote by one ſpirite which is alwaies
lyke himſelfe, and alwayes agréeth
with himſelfe. The whole
blame therefore is to lyght vppon vs
that we are ſo dim ſighted as not to ſée

how theſe two ſeruauntes of GOD
doe iumpe agrée together without anye
iarre at all. I thinke it néedefull
for this cauſe before I come to handle
the wordes of the Text as they lye in
order, firſt to take awaye this ſhewe
of diſcord: If anye man will demaunde
what cauſe there was which
made them to appeare in outwarde
ſhewe ſo contrarye the one to the other?
I aunſwere, that although there be no
contrarietie in the matter it ſelfe which
they teach, yet the diuerſitie of ye ſchollers
which they lyght vppon, and the
contrarie affection of thoſe whome they
inſtructed, cauſed them to vſe a diuers
and contrarie order of teaching.
            Saint Paule hauing to deale with
ſuch as woulde ſéeke to bée iuſtified,
partlye by Faith in Chriſt, and partlye
by theyr owne déedes, or the déeds
of the Lawe, vſeth this order, firſt,
ſhewing that wée were loſt and condempned
in our ſelues, then next iuſtified
and ſaued through the merits of
Chriſt: afterward that wée are ſanctified
in him, and muſt ſhewe foorth

the fruits of our faith in a pure and holy
life. S. Iames lighting vpon another
ſort of mē which cōfeſſed ye frée iuſtification
through faith in Chriſt, yet in
this they were deceiued, yt they did not
conſider, how al thoſe that are iuſtified,
are ſanctified, how all thoſe that are in
Chriſt Ieſus are newe creatures, that
they are new borne, and walke not after
the fleſh, but after the ſpirite: that
the true, liuely, and iuſtifieng fayth doth
bring foorth the fruites of righteouſneſſe
in a holye conuerſation. Now becauſe
this cannot be remooued or ſeparated
from the right and liuelye faith.
Saint Iames goeth as it were backwarde
and proueth, that where
this latter, that is to ſay, the fruites of
faith are wanting, there faith is wanting,
and ſo his drift is to ſhewe that
all vngodly and carnall profeſſours of
Chriſt haue but a dead faith, which in
no reſpect is able for to helpe or ſaue
them. A ſecond cauſe why they ſéeme
ſo much to differ, is héerein, that men
doe not marke well howe they handle,
not the ſelfe ſame matter, nor haue

not the ſame drifte. For Saint Paule
laboureth to proue, that the true fayth
doth ioyne vs to Chriſt, and thereby
ſaue vs. Saint Iames héere beateth vppon
this pointe, that the dead faith
which is but a bare Image of the right
Faith cannot profite a man, this ſhall
appeare in the wordes of the Text, and
alſo a thirde cauſe is, that they doe not
take this worde iuſtified in the ſame
ſence, but diuerſelye as it ſhall be prooued
afterwarde: Now will I come
vnto the Text. What auaileth it
my bretheren though a man ſayth hée
hath Faith when hée hath no woorkes,
canne the Faith ſaue him? This is his
propoſition, and the matter which hée
will diſpute vppon in the whole Text
following, thus much it is in effect, that
it doth not auaile a man to ſaye hée
hath Faith, nor it doth not profite him
to boaſt and bragge, and to make profeſſion
thereof, when hee hath no good
woorkes: the reaſon is this, becauſe it
cannot ſaue him: marke and obſerue
this well, for héere at the firſt enteraunce,
the blindneſſe of the Papiſtes

and their folly, doth manifeſtly bewraie
it ſelfe, when as they doe not ſée nor vnderſtand,
that it is not the purpoſe of
the Apoſtle in this place to diſpute vpon
this point, whether ye true faith doth
ſaue &amp; iuſtifie or not: but to ſhew that
ſuch as haue not good workes, haue not
the true faith in them, and therefore
whatſoeuer they profeſſe, they cannot be
ſaued, for he doth not propounde his
matter thus, what auaileth it though a
man haue Faith and haue not workes:
but what auaileth it though a man ſaye,
he hath faith &amp; hath no workes? Wherby
it is very manifeſt that when Saint
Iames doth attribute the name of faith
vnto this dead Image, hée doth it not
in proper, but in abuſiue ſpeach, and after
the manner of thoſe men which called
it faith, when as in very déede it is
none, but onely a certeine reſemblaunce
and ſhaddowe thereof. Thus much for
this enteraunce &amp; ſtate of his diſputation,
now followe his reaſons by which
he doth proue that this kinde of Faith
cannot auaile or profite a man, for hee
doth proue it very ſtronglye and pithely
                  •
               .

The firſt of them is taken from a
compariſon or ſimilitude which he ſetteth
downe thus, If a brother or a ſiſter
bée naked and deſtitute of daylye foode,
and one of you ſaie vnto them, depart in
peace, warme your ſelues, and fill your
bellyes, notwithſtanding ye giue them
not thoſe thinges which are néedfull to
the bodie, what helpeth it? This is the
ſumme of the matter: There commeth
vnto you a poore man or a poore woman,
which lacketh clothes and ſuſtenaunce,
you giue them gentle and fayre
wordes, God helpe ye, God ſuccour yée,
and ſend ye reliefe: but ye giue them nothing,
can this helpe the poore man, or
the poore woman? Shall they not for all
your louing words ſterue for colde &amp; die
for hunger, if euerye man ſhould ſerue
them ſo, and giue them no other almes:
why doe yée not ſée then, that as this
almes &amp; liberalytie to the poore which is
but in faire ſpeaches is colde &amp; doth not
help, ſo in like manner ye Faith which is
but in words and outwarde profeſſion of
ſpeach, although it be wc neuer ſo great
brags, is dead, &amp; thē furder why do ye not

vnderſtand that a thing which is weak
and dead in it ſelfe, can by no meanes
haue power to giue life, and to ſaue. But
obſerue it a little better, thus the compariſon
ſtandeth, if that liberalitie which
is onely in words be colde or dead, and
doth not profit the poore, nor make him
a liberall man which vſeth it: then it
followeth alſo, that that Faith which is
onely in ſpeach is dead, and therefore
cannot ſaue or profit him which hath it,
if wordes onely could profit or cauſe it
to be faith, why ſhould not wordes alſo
profit the poore man or woman which
is deſtitute? If words onely can make
a faithfull man, why ſhould not words
make a liberall man? If for a man to
ſaie hée hath faith, be of that power to
do the greateſt things, as namely to couple
vs to Chriſt, to raiſe the ſoule from
death to lyfe, to put the Diuell to flight,
and to ouercome the world? Should it
not be able to doe ye leſſer, that is to ſay,
ſo far to preuaile with vs, &amp; to haue ſuch
power in vs: as to bring forth good
works? Déere brethren, know yt if it bée
aliue &amp; do the former, it muſt néeds doe

this: if it doe not this latter, then ſurely
it is dead &amp; can do nothing to ſaue vs.
This is a moſt plaine and forcible reaſon
to proue, that the faith of a carnall
and worldly Goſpeller, is but a dead
ſhewe of faith, and therefore he is not
iuſtified nor ſaued, neyther can bée
iuſtified nor ſaued thereby: ſéeing it
hath no life in it ſelfe to worke and to
bring forth fruites, it cannot giue lyfe
vnto him, for how ſhoulde it bring that
which it hath not? To ſet it foorth more
plainly, thus ye Apoſtle addeth: but ſome
man might ſaye, thou haſt the faith and
I haue workes, ſhewe me thy faith by
thy workes, and I will ſhewe thée my
faith by my workes. He ſheweth héere
how euery ſimple man which is a true
Chriſtian, maye be able to deale againſt
the greateſt and moſt ſkilfull Doctour
that is, to proue that he hath no faith if
he hath not good workes, for when hée
ſaith, Some man will ſay, it is as much
as if he had ſaid, any man may ſay, thou
haſt faith, that is, thou makeſt thy boaſt
that thou haſt faith, ſhewe it by thy
workes: becauſe faith is an holy thing,

wrought by Gods ſpirite, and a lyuely
and mightie thing, therefore it cannot be
without holy &amp; good actions. For as a
man is knowen to be dead, when he doth
not breath, cannot ſtir, ſée, heare, and ſuch
lyke, and contrariwiſe, when he doth any
of theſe, he is known to be aliue: euen
ſo is it with faith, if it can or doe bring
forth no good workes, then is it dead, on
the contrary part, the actions &amp; ſtirring
thereof doe ſhew it to be aliue. This
is a ſtrong place againſt all thoſe which
doe not onely vaunt themſelues of a
vaine and dead beléefe, but alſo woulde
leaue no mark to know who are of God
and who are of the Diuell: Let a man
take thē tardie in any foule vice, wherin
they wallow, &amp; ſay vnto them, ye are
out of the waye, ye haue not the true beléefe
in God, ye are couetous, ye are a
worldling, ye are a drunkard, &amp; an adulterer
or ſuch like, their aunſwere is readie,
Who made you able to iudge, can
you tell how I beléeue, will you take
vppon you to ſée what is in my heart,
whatſoeuer you ſay, I haue as good a beléefe
as your ſelfe. Marke well now I

pray ye, for héere you may learne how to
anſwere ſuch fellows: ſay thus vnto thē,
faith indéed of it ſelfe is a ſecret thing in
the hart, but yet becauſe it can no more be
without good déeds, then fire can be without
heate: the Lord doth bid vs by his
Apoſtle to ſay vnto ye, ſhewe me your
faith by your works, &amp; whē your tongue
is foule &amp; your déedes are wicked, moſt
certaine it is that the hart is vncleane, &amp;
there is no right faith, for yt doth purge
the hart, as S. Peter ſaith. Act. 15. Looke
but vpon mens words &amp; outward brags
of their beléefe, &amp; ye would thinke there
were ſuch plentie of faith, yt there could
be almoſt no more, euery man doeth ſo
ſtrongly beléeue in Chriſt. But come to
this touchſtone &amp; trial which is héere giuen
vs, ſhew thy faith by thy works, &amp;
it ſhall by &amp; by carry vs ſo far on ye other
ſide, when we ſée ſuch flouds of all horrible
&amp; beaſtly ſins, yt it will cauſe vs to
think vpon this ſaieng, When ye Son of
man commeth, ſhal he finde faith vpon
the earth? For if this be true, as it is
moſt true, becauſe God himſelfe hath ſet
it downe: yt the faith which is wtout good

workes is dead, and thoſe are Infidels,
which like brute beaſts care not but for
the things of this worlde, and make no
conſcience of committing all kinde of
euill workes: Doe ye ſuppoſe that if
the Sonne of man ſhoulde now come,
that he ſhoulde finde anye great ſtore of
faith? Alas, alas, how many are the ſinfull
déedes of the moſt men, which ſhew
that they haue no faith? How fewe are
the good workes and how weake euen
in the ſmall remnaunt of the godlye,
which doth declare how poore and ſlender
their faith is? But we muſt yet
procéede further in this matter, and as
it were ſtrike it a lyttle déeper. As men
are wily to deceiue themſelues, ſo they
will héere yet finde a hole to créepe out
at, although they be neuer ſo wicked: for
thus they will ſaye. It is true, Gods
word ſaith, that faith is ſhewed foorth
by good workes, well, I thanke God,
though I haue many vices in mée, and
am full of infirmities, yet I am not altogether
without good workes: I am
not ſo graceleſſe, but at ſome times I
remember God by praier: I doe according

to my abilitie giue to the poore: I
am ready to pleaſure my friend: doe not
theſe things ſufficientlye ſhewe that I
haue faith? Déerely beloued take héed,
for héere you may ſoone be deceiued, it
is not the meaning of the Apoſtle when
he ſaith ſhew me thy faith by thy works,
that a few ſcattered ſcraps of good déeds,
among great heapes of ſinfull workes,
and as it were a few graines of Corne
in a great heape of Chaffe, ſhould be a
true witneſſe of the ſame. For it muſt
be ſhowed both in forſaking &amp; renouncing
all euill wayes, and alſo in following
after all goodnes: for it is without al
controuerſie yt thoſe which ſéeme to be
good works before men are not ſo before
God, in the man which is giuen ouer
to commit ſin: can yt which is good come
out of the ſame heart in which vngodlineſſe
raigneth: either make the trée good
(ſaith Chriſt) and the fruite good, or els
make the trée euill and the fruite euill:
A good trée cannot bring forth euil fruit,Mat. 12. 33
neither can an euill Trée bring foorth
good fruite?Luk. 6. 43. Can the ſame Trée bring
forth both good fruite and euill fruite?

Doth a fountaine at the ſame place ſaith
(S.Iam. 3. 11. 
               Iames) ſend forth both ſwéet and bitter
water?1. Ioh. 3. 7. Be not deceiued (ſaith Saint
Iohn) he that worketh righteouſneſſe is
righteous, he that committeth ſin is of
the Diuell. Some man will ſay, doth not
the moſt godly man that liueth commit
ſin, &amp; doth not ye good &amp; the bad come together
frō him? The godly are loden wt
the corruptions of ye fleſh, but yet they
doe not commit ſin, yt is to ſay, they are
not giuen ouer, as vngodly men are to
the obedience of ſin: they are ſpotted with
imperfections, but they do not take pleſure
therein as the wicked do: although
they féele a lumpiſhneſſe in them vnto
good workes, yet their whole race is applied
vnto good works: they would very
faine obey their God on both ſides, that
is to ſay, in forſaking all that is euill, &amp;
doing all yt which he commaundeth thē.
Contrariwiſe, the fleſhly Infidell doeth
with all his heart giue vp himſelfe in the
whole race of his life to that which is
filthy, if he doe any thing which is good
it is but in ſhew, being not done ſincerely,
nor comming from a good roote: but of

ſelfe loue, vaine glorie, or ſuch like. Hée
doth not any thing for the Lords ſake,
but for his own. For loue him &amp; ye ſhal
finde him ready to do ye good, ceaſe that,
&amp; his goodneſſe doth dye. Praiſe him, he
will praiſe you againe, diſcommend him
although he deſerue it neuer ſo much, ye
ſhall not come in his books, be ye neuer
ſo good. Forget not this then I praye ye
good bretheren, when God hath ſet down
ſo plain a rule to trie our ſelues by, whether
we be faithfull or Infidells. If we
finde our ſelues ful of good workes, &amp; our
heart doth beare vs witnes that we do
them euen for loue towards God: well
are we, this doth declare our faith. But
if our euill déedes abound &amp; our hart be
vncleane, it is time to looke about vs, we
are in a moſt miſerable caſe. I wiſh of
God, that we might often thinke vppon
this, and be carefull to ſhewe our faith
to the world, by our good and pure lyfe.
Be not afrayde to applye this to our
ſelues, and alſo to deale againſt the
vngodlye with it. For in this diſſolute
age, wherein iniquitie hath almoſt
gotten the vpper hande, it is

moſt neceſſary that we vſe this inſtrument
which GOD hath put into our
hands. Thou ſaiſt thou beléeueſt, ſhew
thy faith by thy workes. Now followeth
another reaſon: Thou beléeueſt ther
is one God: thou doſt well: the Diuells
alſo beléeue and tremble. Way this argument
well, and ye ſhall plainlye perceiue
that it doth nothing at all helpe a
man to ſaye he hath faith, when he hath
no good déeds: if this kinde of faith could
ſaue him, then ſhould the Diuells be ſaued
alſo, becauſe they haue the ſame beléefe:
but becauſe it is moſt certaine,
that the Diuels ſhall not thereby be ſaued,
therefore it is alſo as manifeſt, that
thoſe men who haue no other beléefe
but that which they haue, cannot be ſaued.
Let vs ſée then how farre the faith
of Diuelles doeth goe, Thou beléeueſt
(ſaith he) that there is one God, or that
God is one, and ſo thou thinkeſt this a
great matter, not to beléeue as ye vaine
Gentiles which did think there wer diuers
Gods, and indéede for ſo farre thou
doſt well: but yet marke what a great
matter thou haſt attained, the Diuells

doe beléeue the ſame, and yet haue therby
no benefit or reconciliation with God,
for they tremble when they remember
the terrible iudgement ſeate &amp; the euerlaſting
fire which is prepared for them.
This faith of the diuils is not to be reſtrained
to ſome one point, but ſtretcheth
vnto the whole doctrine of Faith.
They doe ſtedfaſtly beléeue and knowe
that Ieſus Chriſt died for the ſinnes of
the worlde: this is a ſure reaſon that
they know the doctrine of God, when
they ſéeke to deface and ouerthrow it by
contrarie errours. When a man therefore
is of a ſounde iudgement in the
Scriptures for matters of Faith, and
is able to confirme euerye point and to
ouerthrowe the contrarie errours:
though manye will ſaye, hée is a ſound
                  •
               
man, &amp; he taketh himſelfe to be as great
a Goſpeller as any other, yet if he haue
no workes, if his faith be not a liuelye
regenerating faith, he maye eſtéeme of
himſelfe what he will, but the Lorde
telleth vs that he is no more forwarde
then thē Diuelles, they are as ſounde
in the knowledge of truth as hée.
            
               
And if this common and general faith
would ſerue, they ſhould be ſaued as
well as he. But it may be héere obiected,
that there is great difference betwéene
the faith of Diuelles, and the
faith of thoſe men which beléeue, and
yet haue no fruits of godlineſſe in thē.
The Diuells indéede doe beléeue all
matters of faith to be true, but they do
not nor cannot beléeue, that they perteine
any thing at all to them, they
haue no hope of mercie: but men although
they be very ſinful, yet they are
in hope yt they ſhal be ſaued. Héere is a
great difference therefore, and the faith
of ſuch men goeth farre beyonde the
faith of Diuells. The Lorde giue vs
eyes to ſée, and heartes to vnderſtand,
for I will ſhew that the difference is.
That the faith of the Diuells is more
perfect: For what is the cauſe that the
Diuels haue no hope, and the wicked
men think they haue hope, is it becauſe
they haue leſſe faith, nay, it is becauſe
they are more wiſe, and becauſe they
giue credite to that which GOD hath
threatened againſt them. They beléeue

that he will powre out his wrath
vpon them becauſe hee hath ſayde it:
But the wicked men they are more
fooliſh, and where God hath pronounced
againſt them for their ſinnes eternall
fire, they doe not beléeue him, and
ſo indéede their Faith commeth ſhort
of the faith of diuells: they ſhould beléeue
the Lorde when hée telleth them
that all thoſe which doe not tourne
from theyr vngodlyneſſe when he calleth
them to repentaunce, ſhall bee
caſt into Hell. But they blinde themſelues,
&amp; wil ſéeme to beleeue quite contrary
vnto yt which God affirmeth: this
is not to ſhut the doore to repentaunce,
but to moue men to ſéeke for it while
God doth offer himſelfe, for they ſhall
not be able when they will: it is God
which muſt beget vs to himſelfe, and
giue vs the newe birth, and ſanctifie
vs by his ſpirite to bring foorth the
true fruites of Faith, and not to haue
ſuch a dead beleefe, which doth chaunge
vs no more then the faith which the
Diuells haue, doth chaunge them. For
there be very many at this daye, who

béeing ſtuffed as full of wickedneſſe as
euer they can hold, and their words and
déeds doe plainly ſhew that they are no
more changed then Diuells, which will
ſo bragge of their faith and the ſtrength
thereof, that if there ſhould be but ten in
the whole Countrie ſaued, they hope to
be of them: they neuer vnderſtoode the
doctrine which the Lord teacheth in this
place, God giue vs vnderſtanding that
we be not ſeduced, but that we may ſéek
at the handes of Chriſt, to giue vs a
faith which may differ from that which
the diuels haue. Héere alſo ſhall appeare
ye ignorance of the Papiſts: They would
beare men in hande that S. Iames doth
ſpeake of the ſame faith which S. Paule
doth, &amp; yt he plainly affirmeth it doth not
alone iuſtifie. But 
                  〈◊〉
                héere as he ſaid before,
what auaileth it if a man ſaye he
hath faith and hath no works, can that
faith which is but in words, or the dead
faith ſaue him? So now he telleth more
plainly what faith it is which he ſpeaketh
of, which cannot helpe a man, euen
that which the Diuell hath. Is not that
beléefe which Saint Paule ſayth doth

iuſtifie, wrought by ye holy Ghoſt? Shall
we be ſo blaſphemous as to ſaie the diuells
are pertakers of him? You maye
well perceiue therfore that Saint Iames
doth ſpeake nothing againſt that which
Saint Paule hath proued, howe Chriſt
alone is our righteouſneſſe, whome wée
take holde of onely by Faith, for hée
doth but ſhewe that the dead Picture
of Faith, doth not ſaue. Remember well
then what Faith is héere ſpoken of, and
the controuerſie is ſoone decided. The
Apoſtle now procéedeth to his laſt reaſon,
which becauſe it is wonderfull
ſtrong, he vſeth as it were a certeine
Preface vnto it, leaſt wée ſhoulde paſſe
lightly ouer it, without due conſideration.
But wilt thou vnderſtand (ſayth he)
O thou vaine man, that the faith which
is without works is dead? See howe
vehementlye hée thundereth béere, againſt
the carnall profeſſour, calling
him a vaine man, likewiſe wilt thou
vnderſtande, cannot thoſe former reaſons
ſatiſfie thée, are they not ſtronge
inoughe to perſwade thée, or plaine
inough to teach thée, I will let thée ſée

ſuch a reaſon that neither thou nor all
the world ſhall bée able for to gaine
ſaie, it is ſo ſtrong and ſo manifeſt that
it will ſtop the mouths of all the cauillers:
and force them to confeſſe,
will they, 
                  •
               ill they, that the Faith
which is without workes is dead: ſée
how meruailouſly the holy Ghoſt doth
labour to driue vs from truſting to
this broken ſtaffe, and to force vs to
ſéeke after the true and right beléefe,
it we haue any care to ſaue our ſoules.
And doubtleſſe daylye experience doth
teach vs howe needfull a thing this
is. For the greateſt number of profeſſours
thinke nothing leſſe néedful then
to ſéeke increaſe of Faith, they ſuppoſe
and they will ſaie, they beléeue wel
inough they féele no want at all, what
ſhoulde preaching doe, they canne but
be
                  •••…
               . In very déede this dead ſaith
of theirs, ſeemeth to them to be verye
ſtrong, it cannot bée ſhaken; neither is
it tryed or tempted, for to what purpoſe
ſhould the diuell much labour to ouerthrowe
it: but thoſe which haue anye
faith indéed, doe féele what néede there

is to vſe all meanes to ſtrengthen it.
But let vs come to the matter, he proueth
now by examples, that the true
faith is knowne by good workes: the
firſt example is of Abraham: thus it is
to be opened: ye know that Abraham
was an holy man, &amp; a right man indéed,
he was highly in fauour with God, the
couenant was made with him, that in
his ſéede all nations of the earth ſhuld
be bleſſed: ye wil then confeſſe that he
had the right faith, there is no doubt at
all in that. Likewiſe ye muſt néedes
graunt, yt as there is but one God, one
mediatour, ſo there is but one Faith,
whervpon it followeth, yt as many as
haue ſuch a faith, or yt ſame faith which
was in Abraham ſhalbe ſaued, &amp; none
els:Ephe. 4. 5 1. Tim. 2. 5 for although euery one of ye children
of Abraham do not atteine to the ſame
meſure &amp; ſtrēgth yt their father did, yet
they are like him &amp; haue the ſame beléefe.
Then I beſéech you obſerue wel
the ſecond parte, wherein is declared
howe the Faith of Abraham was
fruitfull, and did declare and ſhew
foorth it ſelfe by good workes, for

hée offered his ſonne Iſaac vpon the Alter.
Wherevppon it doth alſo followe
that all his children,Gen. 21. and all the ſonnes
of GOD, doe declare and ſhew forth
their Faith, by their good déedes: And
whoſoeuer they be which do not ſo, they
are degenerates and baſturdes, none of
his children nor yet pertakers of anye
bleſſing with him, for their: Faith is
dead, and therefore they are not aliue,
doe ye not ſée déerely beloued, the meruailous
force of this reaſon, and that it
is as cléere as the Sonne: Heere is no
ſtarting hole left for a man to hide himſelfe
in, nor to créepe out at, but hée is
holden faſt to this, that if hée will bée
ſaued, he muſt ſo beléeue, that he declare
and ſhew forth to the world by his good
works and holy life, how he walketh in
the ſteps of his faithfull father. Abrahā.
But why doth he chooſe this one worke
of Abraham before all the reſt? For his
life did ſhine with holy works, he was
merciful to ye poore, he interteined &amp; lodged
ſtrangers, he was peaceable wt al men,
iuſt &amp; true in al his delings: doubtles this
did excel al ye reſt, &amp; ſo farre paſſe them,

that it maye well inough be mentioned
in ſtéede of them all, it did declare a
wonderfull faith and loue towardes
God as we may eaſily ſée, conſidering al
the whole circumſtaunces of the ſtorie.
God had called him out of his-nati
                  ••
               
Countrey and from his Fathers houſe
into a ſtraunge lande: he had promiſed
him a ſonne by his wife Sara, of whom
the bleſſed ſéede ſhould come, he performed
this promiſe in his olde age, euen
when Sara was by nature paſt childe
bearing, he had no other childe by hir,
the promiſe was made in none but in
him,Gen, 21. 12 In Iſaac ſhall thy ſéede be bleſſed.
Each man ſhall now be driuen to confeſſe,
that héere was a great triall, when
God doth bid him take his onely ſonne
euen Iſaac, and goe thrée dayes iourney
to the place which he would ſhew him,
and to offer him vpon the Altar a ſlaine
Sacrifice. How great a griefe is it for
a louing father, to looſe a ſonne which he
loueth déerelye, eſpecially when he hath
no more ſonnes: then how much griefe
might this be, not onely to ſée his ſonne
ſlain, but alſo to ſlay him with his own

hands: and moſt of all that childe, in
whom the couenaunt of eternall lyfe
was made, becauſe Chriſt ſhoulde come
of him, who being dead, all hope of ſaluation
did dye with him. Al this did not
with-hold, but ye faith of Abraham caried
ſo great a loue in him &amp; feare towards
God, that he neuer grudged at the matter
nor neuer made delay, but went indéede
to haue ſlaine his ſonne, hauing
bound him vpon the woode, and hauing
taken in his hand the ſacrificing knife,
to kill him. Then the Angell of ye Lord
frō heuen did forbid him. Before ye Lord
it was as if it had bene done, becauſe
Abraham did fully purpoſe to do it, then
we ſée plainlye by this, what the true
faith is. But if any man ſhould obiect
and ſay, this example is not fit: euerie
man cannot be lyke Abraham, nor haue
ſuch a faith as he had, he was a rare
man, few or none to be compared with
him. Saint Iames doth aunſwere, If ye
thinke this example to be too high, and
that ye are not to be meaſured by it, I
will ſhew you another as lowe:: what
ſay ye to Rahab the harlot, was not ſhe

iuſtified by workes, did not hir faith
declare it ſelfe by good workes? Can ye
take any exception againſt this example?
Will ye not be aſhamed that your
faith ſhoulde not be lyke hirs? As the
faith of Abraham did vtter it ſelfe to the
world, ſo did hirs, whereby ſhe ſhewed
hir ſelfe to be a right daughter of Abraham,
although ſhe were not of his poſteritie
according to the fleſh, but came
of one of thoſe curſed Nations, which
God had commaunded the Children of
Iſrael to roote out and deſtroy, yet I ſay
ſhe was his daughter, according as S.
Paule ſetteth it forth in the Epiſtle to
the Romanes,
               Ro. 4. 12. that he ſhould be the Father
not onely of them which are of the
Circumciſion, but alſo of thoſe yt walke
in ye ſteps of ye faith of our father Abraham:
like as all his children both of the
Iews &amp; Gentiles muſt do which will be
bleſſed wt their faithfull father Abrahā.
Then we haue héere ye exāple of ye father
of all ye faithfull, with ye exāple of one of
his daughters, which had ben a poore harlot,
what excuſe remaineth, or what can
we pretende, ſhall we not bluſh, and

be aſhamed to ſay that we beléeue well,
and take our ſelues to be the Children
of Abraham and the Children of God,
when we are no more lyke him (then
as the common ſaieng is,) an Apple
is lyke an oyſter. Chriſt our Sauiour
doth vſe this reaſon againſt the Phareſies
in the Goſpell of S. Iohn. If ye
were Abrahams Children (ſaith he) ye
would doe the workes of Abraham:
               Ioh. 8. 3. but
now ye goe about to kill me, a man that
haue tolde you the truth which I haue
heard of God, this did not Abraham.
And a little after, Ye are of your father
the Diuell, and the luſts of your father
ye will do. What would we haue more
plaine then this? Euen the very ſéed and
poſteritie of Abraham, which tooke thē
               ſelues
to be the children of Abraham, 
               
                  〈◊〉
               
the children of God, yet Chriſt Ieſus
telleth them plainly they are the children
of the Diuell, and why? Becauſe theyr
workes were not like the works of Abraham,
their beléefe was not lyke his▪
but it was dead. Shall not we then as
boldly ſay at this day, nay rather, doeth
not Chriſt ſpeake as plainly as he did

and telleth vngodlye men to theyr face,
howſoeuer ye brag of your faith, it is
but dead, and howſoeuer ye boaſt and
take your ſelues to be the Children of
God, yet in very déede, vnleſſe ye returne
from your vngodly waies, &amp; ſhew forth
the fruites of a true and liuely faith, ye
are the children of the Diuell: truſt not
vnto your vaine hope and dead faith, for
it will but deceiue you. Déerely beloued
let vs not be ſo mad, when God telleth
vs this with his owne mouth, as to beléeue
the contrary and to perſwade our
ſelues we ſhall do well inough although
we continue in our ſinnes. This is a
moſt peſtilent craft of Satan, and commeth
from the roote of Infidelitie, as ye
may ſée in our great grandmother Eue,
God had tolde hir and Adam, that what
day ſoeuer they ſhuld eate of ye trée, they
ſhould dye the death, the Diuell told hir,
ye ſhall not dye, ſhe beléeued him, but beléeued
not God, ſhe thought euen as the
Diuel told hir, ſhe ſhuld do wel inough,
or els ſhe would neuer haue eate therof:
we haue ſucked this poyſon from hir
breaſts: when God telleth vs, if your

faith bring not forth good workes, it is
dead, it cannot helpe ye, if ye continue in
theſe wicked déedes, ye are the children
of the Diuell, ye muſt ſpéedelye repent,
for ye cannot when ye would: No, no,
ſaith the Diuell on the other ſide, that
is not true, your faith is good inough,
goe on, ye ſhall doe wel, God hath mercie
in ſtore, ye may repent afterwarde.
Now the moſt doth beleeue the Diuell
in this, and giue, no credite at all vnto
God: and neuer ſéeke to try themſelues,
whether they be in good caſe or not.
            When the Apoſtle, ſaith héer, that Abraham
was iuſtified by workes, and that
Rahab was iuſtified by workes, &amp;c. We
muſt note that this word iuſtified is taken
diuers waies in ye ſcriptures, which
is one cauſe (as I noted before) why S.
Paule and S. Iames ſéeme to be contrarie.
S. Paule prouing that we are iuſtified
by faith, taketh it as cōtrary to this
word condemned, for being by our ſins
guiltie, &amp; to receiue the ſentence of condemnation,
we are in Chriſt (into whoſe
myſticall body we are incorporate thorough
faith) acquit and diſcharged, which

is called iuſtification: this cannot be by
the workes of the law, becauſe there is
not perfection in the déedes of any, but
euen the moſt pure are vncleane &amp; ſpotted.
Therfore as S. Paule ſaith, they are
all vnder the curſe,Gal. 3. 10. which holde of the
workes of ye law, for it is written, Curſed
is euery one, which cōtinueth not in
al things which are written in ye book of
the law to do them: ye reaſon of this is to
be conſidered in the moſt holy and pure
nature of God, vnto whom no vncleane
thing can be coupled, no vnpure thing
(although it be but in part) can abide his
preſence, or haue fellowſhip with him.
The word iuſtifie is alſo taken in this
ſence, as when a man doth declare and
ſhew forth before men, yt he is a righteous
perſon alſo before God: &amp; that is the
meaning of the word in this place, that
looke how by faith we are iuſtified before
God: ſo by the fruits of our faith,
we are iuſtified (that is declared to be
iuſt) before men.
            For proofe that the Scripture doeth
vſe the word iuſtified in this ſence, look
vpon the ſaieng of Dauid. That thou

maiſt be iuſtified in thy ſaieng,Pſa. 51. 4 and pure
when▪ thou iudgeſt, there it can ſignifie
no more but that God might ſhew and
declare himſelfe to be iuſt. In the Goſpell
of S. Luke. chap. 16. ver. 15. You are
they (ſaith Chriſt to ye Phareſies) which
iuſtifie your ſelues before men,Luk. 16. 15 but God
doth know your hearts. In this ſaieng
it is moſt apparant, that there is a iuſtifieng
before men, which the Phariſies
in coloured hypocriſie did ſéeke for, but
Chriſt telleth them, they were neuer the
better, becauſe they were not of vpright
heart before God. The word is alſo taken
in other ſenſe, which I omit. If any
man will now demaund, how it can
be proued, that S. Iames doth vſe it in
this latter ſenſe rather then in the former?
I aunſwere, that the very place it
ſelfe and go no further doth declare this
thing: for when the Apoſtle ſaith thus,
Some man will ſay, ſhew me thy faith
by thy workes, is it not apparant, that
he ſpeketh of that which is before men,
or declared vnto men, and not of that
which is before God? In lyke manner,
when he ſaith, Abraham was iuſtified

by works, when he offered his ſonne
Iſaac vpon the Alter. Doth not ye ſcripture
ſhew, that before. God Abraham
was iuſtified long before by faith. If
it be obiected againe, yt if may alſo be
ſayd, how he was before ye time iuſtified
before men, or that he had ſhewed
by his déedes vnto men, yt he did feare
and loue God: and then what ſhoulde
hinder but that it may be taken for a
more full and perfect iuſtification, or
an increaſe therof as well before God
as before men. I aunſwere, that before
GOD a man being iuſtified, to
ſpeake properly there is no increaſe
thereof, for he is fully and wholy diſcharged
and acquite, or els it is no iuſtification.
But becauſe we haue receiued
the grace of iuſtification, but in
part and not in full meaſure, therefore
our iuſtifieng before men is more and
more declared by degrées, as good
workes doe more and more abound in
vs, and ſo Abraham was by this one
worke more iuſtified before men, thē by
all ye reſt of his déeds, &amp; therfore it may
well be ſet downe in ſtéed of al ye reſt:

we ſée héere then yt becauſe by the ſcriptures
this muſt néedes be taken for an
increaſe of iuſtification in our father Abraham,
yt it muſt neceſſarily be vnderſtood
of that iuſtification which is before
men: ye ſée now ye meaning of this text
and the drift &amp; ſcope of the Apoſtle is
laid open vnto ye, but my chiefe purpoſe
is yet behinde, and that wherin we are
to be wrought vppon yet remaineth,
which is a more particular application
and handling of this doctrine. For we
muſt not paſſe away thus with ye matter,
vnleſſe we minde to take ſmal fruit
therby. Ye will confeſſe theſe things
which I haue handled to be true, as of
neceſſity we are forced thervnto, we cā
               not
but grant ye the holy ghoſt hath giuē
a perfect touchſtone, then I am to exhort
you in the name of God, &amp; as ye tender
and loue the ſaluation of your ſoules,
to giue attentiue héede a little, &amp; not to
let this thing ſlip away from ye, do ye
graunt that the faith which is without
works is dead? And that it is no better
then the faith of diuels? And yet wil ye
ſtill ſuppoſe, that idolaters, ſwerers, railers,

adulterers, couetous worldlings, &amp;
griping vſurers, &amp; ſuch like are in good
caſe, or continuing ſuch, canne hope for
mercie? Do ye confeſſe yt ther is but one
true faith, which was the faith of Abraham
and Rahab? Doe ye alſo acknowledge
that the ſame faith in them did
ſhew it ſelfe by good déeds? And wil yée
ſtill accept it for a ſufficient proofe of a
good and ſound teſtimonie of a true beliefe,
when any man can ſay, I do hurt
no man, I liue vprightly &amp; pay euerye
man his owne, I haue alwaies ben reputed
&amp; taken for an honeſt man, what
would ye require more of me, I liue as
my neighbours doe, I truſt God will
hold me excuſed, although he haue no regarde
of any obedience to the worde of
GOD, to conſider wherein his glorye
doth conſiſt, nor yet anye care of men,
to profit either theyr ſoules or theyr
bodyes: but contenteth himſelfe with
this, if hée doe them no good, to doe
them no harme.
            I will ſhew you déerelye beloued,
howe theſe ſortes of people are deceyued
by two fowle errours, which this

text doth moſt ſtrongly ouerthrowe: the
firſt is this, that they looke but vnto mē,
and reſtraine their duetie vnto them,
whereas they ſhould chiefly looke vnto
that which they owe vnto God, &amp; then
to that which belongeth to their brethren:
the ſeconde is that they ſuppoſe
themſelues bound no further but to abſteine
from hurting, without regard of
doing the dueties of loue, wherein one
man is to profit and further another.
            As concerning the firſt of theſe
both the example of Abraham, and alſo
of Rahab, do manifeſtly conuince them:
becauſe the fruites of their faith or the
works whereby they were iuſtified, did
not ſo much reſpect man as God, for in
Abraham there appeareth onely a loue
towards God, for whoſe ſake he was cō
               tented
to forget ye affection of a father, &amp;
to ſhew that although he loued Iſaac
déerely, yet he loued God more, ſo yt if
we féele our loue to the Lord our God,
to be ſo ſmall that it cannot preuaile
with vs, to kill and mortifie the luſts
of ſinne, and vaine pleſures of the fleſh:
how ſhall we perſwade our ſelues that

we are like Abraham, which had denied
the loue of himſefe ſo farre, that he
did neuer grudge, but would willingly
haue killed his ſonne. Rahab after ſhée
had made confeſſiō what ſhe did beleeue
concerning the God of Iſrael, for the
ſame Gods ſake, for the true religion,
and for the Church or people of God,
tooke the meſſengers and did hide them,
to the hazard of her life, &amp; all yt ſhe had,
affirming to the king when he ſent to
ſéeke thē that they were departed. Doth
not this improue the faith of thoſe which
for the religion of God are ſo farre off
from hazarding their liues &amp; goods, that
they dare not be ſéene when neuer ſo
little daunger doth ariſe, wherein are
thoſe like vnto Rahab, which will turne
with euery winde, and a man cannot
tell what religion they be of, they will
be ſure to rowe with the tide, and neuer
to ſtriue againſt the ſtreame: doe
ſuch now iuſtifie themſelues lyke Rahab,
haue they ſuch a faith as ſhe had?
No déerely beloued, they are as yet verye
Infidells and loue themſelues, and
the worlde, more then they loue GOD

and his truth, this thing then is moſt
euident, yt the true beléefe doth make all
thoſe yt haue it, ready &amp; willing to looſe
their liues &amp; their goods for ye goſpel, this
muſt not ſéeme to be a ſtrange doctrine,
whē as our ſauiour telleth vs in ſundry
places yt he yt doth not forſake al, &amp; take
vp his croſſe &amp; folow him cannot be his
diſciple. Wel, we muſt therfore be ſo hot
and zealous in the profeſſion of true religion,
that it cauſe vs to forget our own
ſtate and commoditie: we muſt haue ſo
burning a loue to Gods truth, that nothing
may be able to quench the ſame:
We muſt not ſtagger and varie, becauſe
we ſhal endure trouble. Let vs conclude
this point, wherein it is proued yt they
erre &amp; are deceiued, which doe not make
account of kéeping religion pure, of louing
it before all other things, and ſo of
giuing to God his due honour. Remember
yt from hence ye are to fetch the firſt
part of ye true deſcription of a godly mā,
&amp; the triall of the iuſtifieng faith which
is but one, &amp; therfore worketh alike, in
all which are pertakers of it though not
in the like meſure, &amp; with all mark how

far ye holye Ghoſt doth differ in ſetting
forth a righteous man, from ye common
māner of worldlings: wheras he taketh
it to be ye chiefe work, which reſpecteth
God himſelf &amp; his truth: they paſſe ouer
that &amp; count it no matter though a man
be an Idolater, or ſuperſtitious, or a
ſwearer, which doth not reuerence the
name of God, ſo yt he be a friendly man
to his friend &amp; ſuch lyke, how great an
enimy he be to ye word of God, it ſkilleth
not: theſe are brute beaſts wtout vnderſtāding,
very Atheiſts, which wil ſay
plainly they can ſée no differēce betwéen
the papiſts &amp; the profeſſors of ye goſpel:
both becauſe they are not able to iudge
of doctrine, &amp; alſo yt they looke but vnto
men: now let vs come to ye ſecond thing
wherin they erre, &amp; which this text doth
confute ſharply, they ſuppoſe as I tolde
ye, ye men are to haue no farther regard,
but to this, not to hurt, paſſing by all
thoſe duties, wherin they are to do good
vnto their brethren: not duly cōſidering
how ye law of god, doth not only bind vs
to abſtein frō hurting our neighbor, but
alſo doth moſt ſtraightly tie vs to do al

good déeds vnto them, ſo that he is guiltie
before God, not onely which committeth
that which the law forbiddeth, but
alſo which leaueth the thing vndone,
which the law enioyneth. Now then becauſe
the true faith bringeth vs to haue
care to obey God wholy. S. Iames requireth
that a man ſhould ſhew his faith,
not only by leauing yt which is euil, but
alſo by the performaunce of yt which is
good: for thus he ſaith, ſhew me thy faith
by thy déeds: &amp; that faith which is without
works, is dead, héere by ye way obſerue
by compariſon, how far of are thoſe
frō grace, which ſwarme ful of vncleane
vices, &amp; their whole race is nothing but
a continual ſinning: wheras this is euidently
héere proued, yt ſuch mē as carie a
great ſhew of vprightnes, in refraining
from ſundry vices, are ſtil without teſtimonie
of true beléefe, becauſe their holy
déeds do not appeare, for when as ye holy
ſcriptures do teſtify, yt ye hart is purified
by faith, yt thoſe are borne againe in the
new &amp; ſpirituall birth, that they are new
creatures, &amp; haue a new heart, &amp; a right
ſpirit, created and renewed in them,

it muſt néedes be that they are prepared
vnto euery good worke, they haue not
onely put off the olde man with his corrupt
luſts, but haue alſo put on ye new
man, which is created in righteouſneſſe
and true holineſſe: &amp; as they haue walked
in darkneſſe, ſo now they walke in
the light. There is one ſtep yet further
in this matter, I truſt that as ye will
confeſſe this, that if thoſe do not beléeue
well, which haue no good workes to
ſhewe, although they be in ſome things
vpright, and much more the foule and
filthy liuers, which diſhonour God and
his truth, ſo ye will alſo be brought to
ſée, that thoſe miſerable men are yet further
off, which barke againſt this holye
doctrine, and cannot abide that a man
ſhould ſay to the wicked and vngodlye,
thou art in the waye to hell, thou ſhalt
dye the death, if thou returne not from
theſe euills. They may thunder &amp; raile
againſt men and ſaye they vtter damnation:
but let them looke, if they can
quench the light which the Holy Ghoſt
hath giuen in this text. Let vs retourne
to the former matter againe. We muſt

not onely abſtaine from euill, but alſo
doe good: there be many likewiſe deceiued
in this doing good, reſtraining it to
the baſer and leſſer part: they looke but
vnto the bodies of their bretheren, and
ſuppoſe they are to haue no further regard
but of them, to reléeue and eaſe the
miſeries of the fleſh, let the ſoule be neuer
ſo blinde, neuer ſo ſicke, in neuer ſo
great danger of eternall deſtruction, they
haue no pitie of that, which doth bewray
that they ſée no further then this lyfe,
they haue no true loue nor pitie in thē,
for then woulde they loue the ſoules of
men, which are ſo precious, they would
pitie the wofull miſerie that they be in.
For how abſurd a thing is this, yt one
ſhould be carefull to eaſe the calamitie
which laſteth but for a daye, and not reſpect
that which is eternall, I muſt therfore
héere againe admoniſh ye, that ſuch
as will haue proofe of their faith by good
works, muſt exerciſe the ſame as wel to
the ſoules as to the bodies of men,
and becauſe therein doth ſtand the greateſt
loue of all other, they are therein to
ſhewe themſelues moſt earneſt. There

is no more excellent note of faith, and of
the true feare &amp; loue of God, then when
a man is gréeued, and mourneth to ſée
men out of the waye to life, running
headlong in their ſinnes vnto deſtruction,
and when as he doth in loue and pitie
admoniſh them, and ſéeke by inſtruction
to draw them out of the ſnares of
the Diuell. On the contrary ſide, he can
neuer ſay he hath anye droppe of grace,
which delighteth and ſporteth himſelfe,
at the lewde and wanton behauiour of
other men. Iudge déere bretheren theſe
Cockbraines, which cannot be merrye,
but at the ſinfull and prophane ſpeaches
of vaine men: doe they ſhewe the
fruites of Faith? Thoſe abhominable
beaſts, which delight to make mē dronk,
to the intent they may laugh: are they
of God, or of the Diuell? We muſt diligently
exerciſe the contrary, labouring
to draw one another to God: and to conuert
their ſoules which go aſtray: which
is the ſpeciall and chiefe good work that
we can do vnto men. To féede the hungrie,
to cloth the naked, to viſit ye ſick, &amp;
thoſe which are in bōds, to opē as it wer

the bowells of mercie and compaſſion,
to all that are in miſery: are verye excellent
and glorious fruites of faith: &amp;
haue great promiſes of reward, in ye holy
Scriptures, yet are they not comparable
to theſe, when the ſoule is ſicke in
priſon, and in the chaines of Satan, to
viſit and reléeue it. When it is pining
away, for want of heuenly food, to miniſter
vnto it: when it is full of grieuous
ſores and deadly wounds, to giue wholſōe
medicines &amp; ſalues vnto it: to mourn
with the bowells of pittie &amp; compaſſion
for it. From hence it ariſeth that al true
faithfull hearts doe ſob and grone with
ſorrow, when they ſée men left without
inſtruction, and when they behold the deſolations
and ruines of the Church, it
doth pinch them euen at the heart, it
cauſeth bitter teares to flow out of their
eyes, when they behold any famine and
dearth of the foode of life: and when
they ſée them runne from Sea to Sea,
and from the one ende of the land to the
other to ſéeke for it. When they ſée the
young man and the beautiful virgin periſh
for thirſt, he that ſhall denie this, or

ſtand in doubt thereof, neuer knewe as
yet, what the vſe and benefit of the word
is, nor yet what that loue in the ſpirite
is, which the Lord commendeth vnto vs.
I might héere ſtand long in perticulars,
to ſhewe the crueltie of thoſe Parents,
which ſuffer their children to be without
the knowledge of God, and to periſh in
their ſins. For one of the chiefe fruites
of their faith doth ſtande in this which
the Apoſtle commaundeth,Ephe. 6. 4. Fathers prouoke
not your children to wrath, but
bring them vp in the nourture and inſtruction
of the Lord. For thoſe which
haue the riches and wealth of the world,
the Holy ghoſt ſaith,1. Ioh. 3. 17 He that hath this
worlds good, and ſéeth his brother ſtand
in néede, and ſhutteth vp his compaſſion
from him, how dwelleth the loue of
God in him? If this be true, that the
rich men of the world, do not loue God
when they wil not part with their riches,
to reléeue ye miſerable carcaſe of their
bretheren: then doubtleſſe it is a more
ſtrong argument againſt them, when as
ſo many ſoules periſh for want of good
&amp; pure inſtruction, which by their wealth

they might procure, if they did not make
more account of their riches, then of the
ſaluation of men. Gods word pronounceth
them bleſſed, which imploye theyr
goods to féede the poore, then how much
more bleſſed a thing is it when they are
imployed to the miniſtring of ſpirituall
foode, which neuer periſheth? But let vs
come to thoſe which haue the charge of
ſoules, what is the principal good work,
which they are to ſhew their faith by: &amp;
wherein they are to declare their loue
towardes Chriſt and his Church. Simon
Ioanna loueſt thou me,Ioh. 21. 15 Féede my
ſhéepe, féede my Lambes, féed my ſhéepe.
When as therefore the hireling, the idle
Drone, and the Idoll ſhepheard haue the
flocke of the Shéepe &amp; Lambes of Chriſt
and doe not féede them, or at the leaſt
doe ſo féede them, that they are neuer
the better: where is the faith which
they boaſt of, is it anye other then the
dead faith and the faith of Diuells?
Whoſoeuer therefore will haue the teſtimonie
of his faith in this callyng, he
muſt execute the office as the Scripture
bindeth him.
            
               
Is it poſſible that he can giue credit
to the word of God, and be of a right beléefe,
and not regard this? The reſt of
his good déedes whereby ſome man will
ſay he doth ſhewe his faith, are no good
déedes: for if he did them of loue towards
God and his bretheren, would he
not then doe that, wherein his loue to
both ſhould moſt of all ſhewe it ſelfe?
Can he loue God, and hate God? Can
he loue men, and hate men? Or can hée
loue God, and not regard to do his wil?
Or can he loue men, and not care for the
ſaluation of their ſoules? O my bretheren,
who cannot ſay to ſuch a man:
Shew me thy faith by thy works. Who
will be ſo blinde as to think ſuch are in
good caſe?
            I will nowe drawe towardes an
ende, onelye by this place exhorting
euerye man, while God giueth him
time and abilytie, to giue himſelfe
to the exerciſe of good workes, and the
ſeruice of God.
            And déere bretheren, what ſhoulde
make vs ſo ſlacke, conſidering howe
ſhorte our time is, and howe great

reaſons ther are to perſwade vs, as firſt
to begin with that, which is taught in
this place: is it not a meruelous bleſſing
to haue the witneſſe of our faith? Is it
not a miſerable curſe to be without the
true peace of conſcience, and to abide ſtil
in doubt? Doeth not GOD promiſe
vs alſo, although we can deſerue nothing,
but when we haue done all that
we can we are ſtill vnprofitable ſeruaunts,
that all our good workes ſhal be
rewarded,Ma. 10 42 euen to a Cup of cold water,
which is giuen for his ſake? Make yée
bagges which neuer waxe olde,Luk. 12. 33 or treaſure
which neuer faileth in heauen, &amp;c.
Shall not the promiſe of reward mooue
vs? Go further, how déere and precious
ought the name of our God to be vnto
vs, how much ought it to delyght vs
to heare it magnified, how much ought
we to abhorre to ſée it ſtayned and diſhonoured?
Is not his name honoured
when thoſe which call vppon him, are
fruitfull in good workes. Héerein ſaith
Chriſt is my Father glorified:Ioh. 15. 8 that ye
goe, and bring foorth much fruite. Alſo
he ſaith. Let your light ſo ſhine before

men yt they may ſée your good works &amp;
glorifie your father which is in heauen.Mat. 5, 16.
Is not Gods name diſhonoured by the
euill conuerſation of thoſe which profeſſe
his worde?Rom. 2. 24 Saith not S. Paule,
The name of God is euill ſpoken of,
through you among the heathen? Ought
not the Goſpell to bée déere vnto vs? Is
it not in the mouth of ye greateſt number
of worldlings, when they ſée ye euill
déeds of profeſſors? Loe theſe are your
Goſpellers, héere is their holye doctrine,
theſe are they which hunt after Sermons,
ye may ſée what they are, &amp; what
their teaching is, they haue as fewe
good works as other men, they are all in
wordes. O wretches, ſhall not theſe
things moue vs to let the world ſée our
faith and loue towards God by our good
works? likewiſe is ther any greater loue
which can be ſhewed towards men, thē
when they ſhall be moued by our good
déeds, to glorifie God in ye day of their
viſitation, when our godly deling ſhall
cauſe them to confeſſe that it is an holy
religion which we profeſſe, &amp; ſo giue
eare &amp; ioyne themſelues vnto the ſame?

Happy man which by his holy life is a
meane to drawe others from their euil
wayes: &amp; to bring thē to be ſchollers in
ye ſame ſchoole that he is. Contrariwiſe,
what a woful and miſerable wretch is
that which ſlaundereth &amp; diſhonoureth
the holy word by his ſinfull life, which
driueth other from it, and ſo thruſteth
them on headlong to deſtruction. O vncharitable
man, ſhall not the bloud of
ſuch in ſome ſort be layd to thy charge,
when thou driueſt them from the Lord
and his truth, as much as lyeth in thée,
and driueſt them headlong to deſtruction.
I might procéede to many perticulars,
but then I ſhould be ouer tedious.
The Lorde plant theſe things in our
hearts, and giue vs grace to continue
in all goodneſſe to our liues ende, to
his glorie, and our eternall
comfort.
Amen.
