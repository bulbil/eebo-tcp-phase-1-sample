            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).

               Right Honorable,
            
            
               HVNGARIE after many afflictions endured by her ſworne enemies (the Turkes) for her vtter ruine and decay: and after as many intreaties, requeſts, and earneſt petitions made to the Princes of Chriſtendome, and to diuers perſons of great reputation and authoritie amongſt them, for the aſſwaging (or rather quite ſuppreſsing, if poſsible it could be) of theſe her wofull and intollerable miſeries: doth now at laſt wander abroade, and is come into our little Iland (it being as it were in the vttermoſt confines of Europe) in ragged and mournfull habits as a diſtreſſed Pilgrime, and with like zeale doth importune your Honour to aſsiſt her with your fauour; which though her attire be plaine and ſad: yet ſuch is her magnificent and illuſtrious minde, that

vnder theſe meane and withered weedes, ſhe onely in plaine and ſyncere manner, diſcouereth the condition of her lamentable eſtate: which happely if your Honour will vouchſafe to peruſe this her pittefull diſcourſe, ſhe maketh no doubt, but that (according to your accuſtomed goodnes, whereof moſt doe taſte) ſhe ſhall with like fauour be graced as other diſtreſſed ſtrangers are. If any defects appeare in her preſence, I humbly beſeech you they may be fauorably imputed to the ignorance (not wilfulnes) of her guyde, whoſe deſire was rather ſafely to conduct her into England, then curiouſly to furniſh her, had his abilitie been fully aunſwerable to his good meaning. Yet herein to manifeſt his willing minde, he hath aduentured to preſent her to your Honour, whoſe fauour and countenance may greatly grace her. In doing whereof, Hungarie (who now waileth for want of reliefe) ſhall thinke her ſelfe highly comforted; and I, for her ſo good ſucceſſe, ſhall not onely pray for the proſperous continuance of your honorable eſtate; but ſhall alſo reſt moſt bound in all humble dutie and ſeruice at your Honours commaund.

            to the Reader, health.
            
               FRiendly Reader, after J had (for my priuate content) tranſlated ſome few notes out of this excellent Historie, J was requested by ſome of my good friends to take further paines in the whole: which J was the rather deſirous to performe, as well to ſatisfie their friendly requests, as alſo for diuers other respects. The first whereof was, for that my ſelfe had been a trauailer in this Countrie of Hungarie, and had (in regarde my aboade there was not long) but ſuperficially noted the manners and dispoſition of the people there, and ſpecially in their martiall affaires, wherein (during my reſidence there) J ſpent my time with ſome obſeruation of thoſe parts, where then J had been: which notwithstanding did now with delight draw me on to begin and proceede in the finiſhing of this Historie. The ſecond reaſon that induced me hereunto, was, in regard that it ſeemed no fiction or fabulous toy, but a Historie of grauitie and credence, as witneſſeth the memorials of Stephen Broderic Chaunceler of Hungarie, and of Caſtalde Lieutenant for Ferdinand (who was King of Hungarie) in that countrie, and diuers others: which being ſo, J rested with aſsurance that it would greatly benefit thee for thy experience in many pollitike affaires. And the third reaſon that perſwaded me to vndertake this worke, was, that J did, and alſo doe ſtill, hartely deſire that it might be, in things appertaining to vs, as a preſident and caueat to theſe parts of Christendome that now thinke themſelues as ſecure, as once the Hungars did, and they then as ſafe from the deluge of Infidels, as we doe now. But alas, ſuch was their pride and diſſention (vnhappie people) that (through their owne miſgouernment) God inflicted this puniſhment vpon them, which now as remedileſſe, and altogether in dispaire, they with wofull laments too late bewaile: for though that ſome neighboring Princes

(whom the cauſe doth alſo neerely concerne) may affoorde them their best ayde, ſomewhat to withstand and bridle the Turkes mightie incurſions; yet ſurely farre vnlikely, and more vnable they are to reconquer that which they haue lost: the reaſon is too apparant, for both in regard of multitudes of men and militarie diſcipline, they farre exceede the Christians, and it may be that thoſe who may, will not, and thoſe who would, cannot affoorde them that ſuccour which is needfull; ſo that, what betweene the one and the other, this miſerable Hungarie (which is one of the fertilest and goodliest Countries in Christendome) is more ſhaken and torne by the Turkes violence and inſolencie, then is a young Lambe betweene the VVolues iawes. Herein I must craue your patience to rest in ſilent melancholy (for mirth it affoords none) vntill the end, and lend your patient eare vnto detestable complots, impieties, and ſeditions; vnto ignominious conſpiracies, immanities and cruelties; vnto horrible maſſacres of men, women and children that be Chriſtians; vnto pitiful laments and mournings of huſbands for loſſe and forcing away of their wiues, and wiues for their huſbands; vnto violation and rapines of maydes; and to be briefe, vnto ſacriledges, burnings, and deuastations of all manner of creatures: which when all theſe things ſhall liuely be diſcifered vnto you in this Historie, then iudge of the ſtate of this poore Countrie into what an abiſme of miſerie it is fallen. J omit to write of many particulars concerning the Turkes politike proceedings, for the incroching vpon Christendome: touching all which (becauſe J would not be tedious) I refer you to the Historie it ſelfe, wherein more at large you may diſcerne their entercourſe and temporiſing with Christians, which indeede is nothing elſe, but only for their owne commoditie to make vſe of them, vntill they finde fit oportunitie to aduance their intended practiſes against them: and then adue league and all ſocietie of friendſhip: onely this J ſay, and humbly deſire God of his mercifull goodnes, to inspire Christians with that humilitie and faithfull repentance, that it may aſſure our harts of turning this iudgement from vs, which our Lord of his mercie graunt for Ieſus Christs ſake, and extirpe theſe Mahometaines, who (as our owne eyes may witnes) daily (with teares and griefe we may ſpeake it) infringe the confines of Europe with their heatheniſh and barbarous proceedings; as more at large this Historie will amplifie.

            The Authors Epistle to the people of France.
            
               TO you (French people) and to no other doe I dedicate this Hiſtorie, and I doe diuulge it to the view of the world, vnder the protection of the beſt aduiſed, to the end that it being by them receiued and defended, it may remaine ſound and perfect, and be as a mirrour to thoſe who know not themſelues; and (who being attained with a ſpirituall leaprouſie) haue no more feeling in them, then as if they had vtterly loſt all their vnderſtanding: not regarding (as vnpitifull) the teares and ſighings of the poore afflicted, happened through their occaſion: not being able to taſte the delicate fruites, which ſage and wiſe councell bringeth with it; not being able to ſent the infection and ſtinke which proceedeth from the imbecillitie of their corrupted braine: not being able by their touching to taſte what is the blood which themſelues drawe from the bottome and deepeſt of their vaines: neither ſee they the extreame miſerie wherein they are plunged, drawing with them thereinto, the ſoundeſt part of their bodies.
            To theſe doe I preſent this mirrour, that looking into it, they may the better know what is their preſent eſtate; and if they could ſee (as they may if they will) their groſſe deformities, and great defects, they ought without doubt to beleeue that they are the ſame perſons, which haue made themſelues ſuch by the corruption and groſſenes of their humors, giuing themſelues ouer to their deſires, through a contempt of the Deitie, by a priuate ambition and auarice.
            When as therefore you ſhall ſee in this Hiſtorie the diuiſion of a people fleſhed one againſt another, for ſoueraigne and regall dignitie: when for this effect, you ſhall reade herein of Townes and Caſtles forced, the inhabitants ſpoyled of their

goods and liues, the wiues at the mercie of the ſouldiour, the maydes violated, many fayre buildings burnt, the ſubiects rebelling againſt their Lords, Peaſants againſt Peaſants; you would aſluredly thinke they are acts committed in a Countrie farre remote.
            But it is you, who amongſt your ſelues, and vpon your ſelues, haue committed the like enormities: when for the like effect you ſhall finde it ſtrange that theſe miſerable and infortunate people, hauing called in amongſt them their old and auncient enemies, vnder colour for them to be reuenged one of another: and (which is yet more beſtiall) ſubmitted themſelues both of the one part and on the other, to a ſtranger. I know not then what ſound iudgement or good opinion you can conceiue of your ſelues, being attainted and notoriouſly conuinced of the ſelfe ſame fault, when you ſhall note the great ruines and deſolations of ſo goodly &amp; rich a Countrie, you may well perceiue euen at this preſent, yours reduced into the like eſtate, and if the calamitie be not in all poynts anſwerable: yet thinke that you touch it with the very tip of your finger, except the acknowledement which you may haue of your ſelues, preſerue you not, and diuertit from you. In examination of your ſelues, you ſhall finde your ſelues all kinſmen, there being neither race or linage amongſt you, which is not allyed one to another, except it be ſome ſtranger newly come in: you ſhall finde your ſelues all of one nation: you ſhall finde your ſelues all ſubiects of one Lord and Prince: and you ſeeing your ſelues to be all of kindred, allied of the ſame nation, and vnder one gouernment: and being able to obſerue theſe conditions in your ſelues, you ſhall certainly iudge, that you are culpable of all the diſorder which at this preſent is ſeene amongſt you, and that the fault happened not but from your ſelues, without impoſing it vpon a ſtranger, who by your loſſe, ſeeketh his owne aduauncement, maintaining his triumphs with heaps of your ruines, which ſerue him for many ſolemnities. This fault once acknowledged, you ſhall imbrace your ſelues, euen one another as kinſmen: you ſhall frequent one another louingly, as true countrimen: and you ſhall make your ſelues wholy obedient to your

Prince, by a mutuall and friendly agreement, remitting all controuerſies that may ſpring amongſt your ſelues, to thoſe who are admitted to execute Iuſtice: propounding to your ſelues the ſimilitude which ſometimes Menewnius Agrippa a Romane, alleaged to his Citizens, who were infected with the ſame maladie that you your ſelues are, he comparing a common wealth to a humaine bodie, which being compoſed of many members, hath neede (for the better ſubſiſtance of it) that all with one accord doe accompliſh their naturall functions the one for the other thy a mutuall and reciprocall dutie; euen as in our neceſſitie we doe naturally practiſe the ſame euery one by himſelfe. If the head doth ake and is ill, we preſently applie to it both our hands to comfort it againe, and it receiueth ſome eaſe thereby; by meanes of the feete it is carried here and there, that it may the better diuert the griefe; we cheriſh it, becauſe the loſſe of it doth ouerthrow all the roſt, and we are not ſo ill aduiſed, vpon the diſtemperature thereof, to cut it off from the other parts. That which nature doth inſtruct you, for the preſeruation of this little bodie, you ought to thinke it to be an inſtruction which it hath prepared for you to walke in the entertainement of your likes, who are vnited to you by a mutuall frequentation and ſuch as is neceſſarie amongſt your ſelues, which we name ſocietie, and from whence commeth this heape and maſſe of people, which we comprehend vnder the name of a common weale; the which, all thoſe that are borne in the ſame, ought to maintaine and preſerue (and not ſeeke the ruine and ſpoile thereof) as being all members of the bodie of it. And concerning the default that herein you commit, you may cleerely ſee the calamitie which ſhall happen to you therefore, by the example of this miſerable Realme of Hungarie, which was in former time no leſſe repleniſhed with warlike men, then you, and which was no leſſe enriched with fertilitie, riches, and all other things neceſſarie for the maintenance of life, then yours. In beholding your ſelues therfore in this, preſently marke withall that the like misfortune may happen to you, that hath ouertaken them, ſeeing the cauſe thereof is alike; and ſo labour, that in the end you may become more wiſe then they, who ſeeing

before them a like accident proceeding from the ſame cauſe in the Empire of Conſtantinople, could not make vſe of it, but haue ſuffered themſelues to fall into the fulnes of euill and miſerie. In doing of which, if the firſt and ſecond haue committed ſuch a fault as they cannot recouer, yet he not you the third which ſhould commit the like. There is not any he that is not deceiued the firſt time; being miſled becauſe he had not made proofe thereof: for the ſecond time a man may be alſo ſometime deceiued, vnder a certaine pretence of frindſhip: but there is no excuſe to the wiſe, when it happeneth the third time. If theſe firſt, if theſe ſecond of our age haue been thus deceiued and ouertaken by their owne rage and retchleſnes, ſuffer not your feete to ſtumble againſt the ſame ſtone, after you haue ſeene two of them to ſtumble before you with ſo foule a fall. Stay your ſelues a while, and giue eare to the wofull reports, which daily are made of loſſe, of ruines, of fire, of great effuſion of bloud, of captiuities, of violations, and of the execrable miſeries which are daily committed among the reſt of the inhabitants of this miſerable Hungarie, and euen by thoſe whom they had drawen ſo vndiſcreetly into their countrie, vnder the colour of ſuccour and ayde.
            And vpon this report, refraine your rage, take againe your wonted ſpirits, and indeuour that your follies may be ſo momentarie, that in euery wiſemans iudgement, they may be eſteemed better then heretofore.

               SEeing the Heauen is ſuch as it repreſenteth it ſelfe to our ſight, that is, proportioned like vnto a Sphericall or round forme: and ſith the ſame Heauen enuironeth, beſides the meane of this great concauitie  (which being betweene it and vs is filled with ayre) this wonderfull frame which wee name the world (little I confeſſe in reſpect of that which enuironeth it about, and wonderfull great in conſideration of the naturall apprehenſion which we may haue of it) it is not without cauſe that The reuolution of al things. certaine auncient Philoſophers eſteemed that all things had their reuolutions.

For ſith ſo it is, that the loweſt part of a circle is that, which is in the middeſt thereof: and that the lower parts or bodies are gouerned by the ſuperiour  (which thing alſo is found true by naturall reaſons knowne, and diligently obſerued in all handie workes and engines:) it is not without reaſon, that ſome haue inferred of this, that this world is ſubiect to the motion of the Heauens, and that we perceiue amongſt vs, the things paſſed to returne againe, and repreſent themſelues to our viewes. For Heauen being round, his period or full point is no other, but a continuall begininng againe, euen as preſt and readie as his ende: which the Aegyptians by their Hierogyphicall figures meant to repreſent vnto vs, and namely by a ſerpent holding the end of his tayle with his teeth. Now this world being heauie and ponderous of his owne proper nature, and yet (in the middeſt of this  great, ſoft, and light ayre) firme, ſtable, and immoueable by diuine diſpoſition, which is incomprehenſible to vs: this world, I ſay, receiueth by certaine reuolutions, in the ſame place and quarters, the ſame and like paſſions, which it hath once receiued from the influence of Heauen; euen as, by the ordinarie circumuolution of it, it commeth more neere vnto vs with his beames. The volubilitie which is in the one, and the ſtabilitie that is in the other, is the cauſe of the effecting &amp; bringing forth of ſuch paſſions: theſe two contraries being ſo ordained and diſpoſed of, to the end that that which is the patient might make the other to become the agent; it being not poſſible that the one ſhould ſubſiſt, except the other were in eſſence. And as the patient, to  the end it may ſuffer, ought to ſtand faſt, and not ſhake: ſo, the agent on the the other ſide is alwaies in action, being not able to ſtay it ſelfe. And if they were both alike in ſoliditie and firmenes, or of the ſame motion, their qualities would be without any effect. And for this cauſe God meaning that the world ſhould be gouerned, according to the nature of it, by Heauen, he hath created the world ſtable for the patient, and the Heauen moueable for the agent; and all this, to the end the world ſhould receiue this benefit of God by the meanes of Heauen, through certaine reuolutions of it, in as much as this great circumuolution might ſtill remaine and returne againe. Whereupon proceedeth this auncient prouerbe, which telleth vs, That nothing 
               Sentence. 
                
               is done, nor nothing ſayd, which hath not been done, or ſayd before.
            
            
               What is there now that hath not been?
               And ſhall not that, at last,
               Which is to be, receiue his being
               From that which once is past?
               That which is made vnmade ſhall be,
               And eke againe be made:
               And, being made againe, it ſhall
               
                  Be ſeene to waste and fade. 
                  
               
            
            And this is that which oftentimes vpholdeth many good ſpirits, which otherwiſe would be terrified through the innumerable euils, wherewith men are often times enuironed. For, wreſtling againſt ſuch torments, they are ſupported by a certaine hope againſt ſuch terrors, namely this, that one day good ſhall come in ſteed of euill: like as when it raineth, we ſtill hope for faire weather. Theſe reuolutions, neuertheleſſe, are not alwaies equall,

or of like perfection, by reaſon of the multiplicitie of meteores and  heauenly ſtarres, which in their ſphericall courſes haue euery one their proper motion, more ſoone or later one then the other, and that in ſuch wiſe, that thorough many ages we doe not finde two equall ſituations or aſpects of the ſame ſtarres ſtreaming vpon vs. For this cauſe the effects of ſuch reuolutions doe not manifeſt themſelues agreeable in euery circumſtance to the firſt. There be alſo ſome of theſe reuolutions, which haue not their neereſt cauſes from theſe heauenly influences, but they ſucceede onely by a 2 
               The diuerſitie of reuolutiōs. certaine combining togither, or be as a conſequence of things fore-happened; as for example, in time of warre many euils doe infallibly accompanie it, and are ingendred thereby. Other reuolutions there be which are  not natural, but proceed from the only and free will of God; &amp; theſe we may 3 name ſupernaturall, although we ſee thē to happen by the ſequell of certaine precedent cauſes, and to haue bin practiſed before in certaine worldly matters. Theſe reuolutions ſometimes fall out ſooner then the naturall courſe of the ſtarres: becauſe that Gods iuſtice (whereof they do depend) doth haſten and addreſſe it ſelfe to puniſhment, euen as the waight of the miſdeedes requireth. The two firſt kindes of theſe reuolutions may be noted to happen many times naturally in thoſe who are altogether abandoned and forſaken of God, and are by him left to the courſe of their owne luſt, as we ſee amongſt the Barbarians, and in the perſon of Pharaoh. The third kind was inflicted vpon the children of Iſraell, who haue often felt one ſelfe ſame iuſtice  and diuine puniſhment, for that their fault was the ſame &amp; equall to the former, ſuch being the will &amp; pleaſure of God, to chaſten thoſe whō he loueth.
            The calamitie happening to the kingdome of Hungarie, (whereof I vndertake to write the hiſtorie) may well bee referred to one of theſe three puniſhments. For when this countrie at an inſtant was ouerthrowne, there was not in Europe (yea it may be not in all the world) any place, where the people was more proude, effeminate, &amp; cold of courage then in this; they giuing themſelues ouer to ſuch infamous vices, through the great riches and maruelous abundance and wealth of the countrie, (which is the cauſe of all wickednes) and becauſe they did (to ſay the trueth) often make head againſt the  Turks, and many times repulſed them: from whence proceeded their pride, and from the ſame, the deſpiſing and contemning of their enemie. The ſeruice of God was not then obſerued but in pompe and ſumptuous riches. The Paſtors &amp; Prelates of the Church behaued themſelues like ſouldiours, vnder colour that it was for defence of it, againſt their enemies. Iuſtice was made an ordinarie ſale. The Nobilitie peremptorie and vntolerable. And the ſimple people, no more ſimple, but hollow, perfidious, and wicked. For theſe and ſuch like enormous vices, it is likely (conſidering that which enſued) that God (to commence and begin his chaſticement) ſent to this people a yong King, according to that wiſe ſaying of Salomon, who aſſureth vs,  
               That curſed is that countrie whoſe King is an infant. Notwithſtanding as yong as Sentence. he was, yet was he ſoone taken out of the world, leauing no certaine heires behinde him, but vnfortunate and cankered hatred, yea a deſire in the hearts of certaine Princes to raigne, which continued and perfected the vtter ſubuerſion of this miſerable Prouince.
            
               
But diſcourſing thus freely vpon ye euil of another, it may be obiected, that I haue matter enough at home, without borrowing from elſewhere, to make the like diſcourſe. There is (truly) enough, and more then we ſhould deſire:  but I willingly anſwer as the wiſeman, who ſaith, That it is unſeemely for a man 
               Sentence. 
               to be iudge in his owne cauſes, or make his owne accounts. For to write and diſcouer our vices, is a vaine fooliſhnes: and to magnifie and extoll our praiſes, is no other but meere flatterie. I had rather imitate thoſe, who vſe the good examples of others to inrich their narration, and know ſo wel to accommodate them to the ſubiect or matter which is propounded, that the auditors are more drawne by them, then by their principall and chiefe arguments. Nay, I will ſpeake boldly; as ſimilitudes are not in all reſpects alike, ſo it ſeemeth France miſerable. that we are in worſe condition, then was Hungarie: for that the miſerie  thereof did not happen but by one of theſe reuolutions, and the euill fortune which doth enuiron vs, doth depend vpon all the three, becauſe it ſeemeth rather to ouerthrow vs, then to correct vs: ſo that we know not which is more true, whether we are chaſticed for our faults by the pleaſure and will of God, as if he loued vs, or whether he doth vtterly abandon and forſake vs, as he did the Barbarians of Peru, leauing vs to our owne motiues of luſt, and by conſequence to the naturall courſe of the ſtarres: the great Coniunction of which (as hath been obſerued by the Aſtronomers) ſhould happen in this miſerable time, bringing with it nothing but a great alteration of kingdomes and eſtates, with a conſequence of a thouſand and a thouſand miſeries. At  the falling out of ſuch Coniunctions, wee reade that the Romane commonweale hath changed the eſtate vnder Iulius and Augustus: as afterward this French Monarchie did vnder Pepin, and Charlemaigne: and as, before that, Italie did vnder Romulus: and Aſſyria vnder Merodach: and before them, the like mutations happened vnder Ianus, and vnder Moſes. The miſeries that accompanied the alteration of the Romane ſtate are ſufficiently knowne. The cruelties were not ſuch vnder Pepin, as they were vnder Hugh Capet. The reuolution of diuine Iuſtice did not extend it ſelfe, but vpon the three ſonnes of Philip the faire, (for the puniſhment of their wicked liues) who ſucceſſiuely were kings of France, and dying without iſſue the kingdome was transferred  to thoſe of the houſe of Valoys. Alſo it is a neceſſary and vſuall thing, that when a good or bad State is come to his complete perfection, it preſently declineth and reuolueth, by reaſon of this circumuolution, commonly called in all ages the wheele of Fortune, to which reuolution God hath faſtned The wheele of Fortune. all humane actions, as well actiue as paſſiue, as to a faſhion or forme the certaineſt of all others: ſo that we neither ſee nor reade of any thing, but a continuall returning of good and euill, hauing his courſe or period more ſhort or long, according to the varietie of things, or diſpoſition of Gods will. When we ſee Religion, Iuſtice, or Policie to be in his full force of vertue, we may aſſure our ſelues to reſt in good eſtate and great content. But of the contrarie,  when ſuperſtition and Atheiſme, when oppreſſion and denying of Iuſtice, when tyrannie and diſorder are come to their full points, wee ought to expect for no other but great ruine and miſerie, and yet the ſame decaying and declining by little and little. I will not in particular here recite, deuotion turned to hypocriſie; the ſacred Miniſterie and the goods therof committed

to Captaines and men of warre, and conuerted to the dowries of women; vnlawfull bargaines, and fowle enormities couered with the vaile of Iuſtice,  the execution thereof committed to the ignorant, in that the ſame is valued rather at the price of money, then of knowledge; the gouernments of Prouinces and Captainſhips of fiftie men of armes brought to a ſet price: in fine, that the royall ſeate is the onely ſhop of all ruinous inuentions, and the charges and exactions of the ſimple people without limite or reaſon. The euill, which infallibly followeth ſuch like infortunate operations, proceedeth not but by diuine prouidence; who minding afterward to introduce good, muſt firſt caſt out and purge the euill by puniſhment and chaſticement, which bringeth with it ſuch miſerie. Notwithſtanding, all theſe naturall violences and iuſt chaſticements may bee mitigated and aſſwaged by  ſome other gentle and diſcreete meanes. The firſt ſort of reuolutions, being naturall, are ſubiect to ſupernaturall effects, which proceede from our immortall The immortall ſpirits not ſubiect to the ſtarres. ſpirits, which by reaſon doe ſtay or chaunge them; it falling out that a wiſeman commaundeth euen the ſtarres, not cauſing them to chaunge their naturall courſe, as ſome heretofore haue thought of Sorcerers, but in making their naturall power fruſtrate and without effect, through a good and aduiſed foreſight. Concerning ſuch chaſticements, as ordinarily fall vpon vs by diuine iuſtice for like faults, euen thoſe neuertheleſſe may bee ſomewhat ſtayed by good and true repentance, contrition, and daily praiers, ſeeing that God is altogether good and full of mercie. Alſo when ſuch vertues  faile vs, we may well be aſſured, that like faults preuailing, or ſuch comming vpon vs as draw neere to them, we muſt look for the like effects, namely, that we ſhould ſee the like celeſtiall courſes in our time, which were in our predeceſſors daies, ſince the firſt great Coniunction happened after the creation of the world. This power, which is thus in man by the permiſſion of the diuine bountie, is cauſe of the diuerſitie which wee ſee as well in diuine chaſticements as heauenly influences, although the cauſes and courſes thereof be alike: otherwiſe, wee muſt conclude that, ſuch heauenly courſes happening, theſe mutations would be vniuerſall and alike vnto euery one: and that for one and the ſame fault the like puniſhment would alwaies  follow. But now, the miſerie, which wee ſee in France, redoubleth it The miſerie of France. ſelfe and daily increaſeth: becauſe that together with celeſtiall influence, rancour, malice, and all manner of wickednes hath in ſuch ſort ſeazed and poſſeſſed the ſpirits of men, that all manner of foreſight, of wiſedome, of prudence, of humilitie and patience doth abandon it ſelfe from thence, euen as it happened at the time of the deluge: in ſo much that it truly ſeemeth that this vnhappie countrie (at the leaſt for his owne particular) is readie to receiue euen as great a fall, as then did the whole world: except ſome (in whom wee ſee ſome ſparke of wiſedome yet to ſhine) doe take the bridle in their hands to ſtay the violent courſe of this heauenly chariot, and by  their good meanes this poore ſhip (willingly expoſed to the windes and waues of a manifeſt ſhipwracke) bee harboured in ſome ſafe roade, by contemplating the euill fortune of another diuulged in this hiſtorie; we endeuouring our ſelues by their examples, as on our own behalfe to take courage, and to inforce our ſelues, as the good ſhipmen doe in a tempeſt, who then

Sith man alſo for his excellencie is endowed with amitie, (which, as I thinke, containeth Friendſhip containeth in it ſelfe all vertue. in it all vertues, eſpecially when the ſame hath relation to two things, that is to ſay, towards God and our countrie, for which we are not bound to trauaile only in all kindes of buſineſſes, but alſo to expoſe our liues, as well men as women, yea children themſelues, as it is often ſeene at ſieges and aſſaults of townes, where both the one and the other ſex doe imploy themſelues with one minde and great courage) euery one which is nobly borne, ought to endeuour himſelfe to cauſe his excellencie the more to appeare.  For elſe he ſhould ſhew himſelfe worſe then a beaſt, and he who is disfourniſhed of ſuch vertue, meriteth not any thing at all to be ranged or reckoned amongſt men. We ſee the proofe thereof by the workes of charitie, which Charitie. proceeding of naturall friendſhip is deeply rooted, and that not onely amongſt Chriſtians, but alſo amongſt Iewes and Painims, and euen amongſt the Atheiſts themſelues, which alſo maketh vs by this meanes greatly to differ from bruite beaſts. According to this wee may conclude, that it is not without cauſe that a graue perſonage ſaid, That we were not altogether borne for 
               Sentence. 
               our ſelues, but for one another: as if euery man (who hath in him any ſparke of ſuch amitie) ought according to his abilitie (whileſt he is in this life) to endeuour  himſelfe to bring ſome profit to the common-weale. For my part, I meane verely to propound to all men, as a fit medicine for the malady of this age, the accidents of a like fortune: to the end, that by the acknowledging of them, euery man may be able to fortifie himſelfe againſt the foule and cruell 1 ſhocke of common calamitie, and particularly without falling into diſpayre, which often proceedeth of vnthankfulnes and forgetting of God: and alſo to the end that others more diſcreete and aduiſed, may by another mans harme auoide the inconuenience to come, or at the leaſt may prepare themſelues 2 to receiue it in ſuch ſort, that their noiſome wound bee not to them ouer dangerous, offenſiue, or preiudiciall: and alſo to the end that thoſe who  doe manage and gouerne States, may learne by the example of others not 3 
               The preſeruation of another &amp; of his owne gouernment neceſſarie for a State. only to preſerue and maintaine their owne, but alſo to bee vigilant that the next neighbour be not inuaded by any other, leaſt that by their negligence and careleſnes, the third increaſing by the ouerthrow of another, he doe not afterwards ouerthrow their State, and in the end bring it vnder his gouernment: as thoſe who haue aſpired to great Monarchies know well how to practiſe this, and whereunto they could neuer attaine, if euery neighbour State would maintaine and aſſiſt one another, as ſometime they well doe when neceſſitie conſtraineth them, and when they are not poſſeſſed or incenſed with any mutuall hatred. But this vice not leauing them any long  time, in the end they giue place to a mightie man to ſet foote by little &amp; little within the territories of their neighbours, and then euen within themſelues: which thing alſo wee may note euen in this kingdome of Hungarie, which heretofore hath been rich and puiſſant, and at this preſent fallen into ſuch pouertie, as it is nothing elſe but euen a mirrour of perfect deſolation and miſerie: as you may vnderſtand by this hiſtorie which I haue rather taken

in hand to write of, then the hiſtorie of any other ſtrange countrie, to the end that it being Chriſtian, it may with more remorſe wound and pierce our  hearts, if we any thing eſteeme or fauour our religion: conſidering alſo that the ſame example (becauſe it concerneth vs) is ſo much the more commended to vs by God and men: whileſt it repreſenteth and ſetteth before our eyes that which our predeceſſors thought worthy to be followed, to the end wee ſhould imitate them; and alſo the euill which they did, to the end wee may auoide it: and becauſe that by occaſion thereof ſo many great perſonages (be they warriours or others) haue from time to time recorded the good and euill actions of their predeceſſors, and of thoſe who liued in their time (as the Barbarians of America vſe the like in their ſongs) to the end they A hiſtorie ſerueth for inſtruction. might leaue to their poſteritie ſome faire and large memoriall, within the  which they may with more facilitie and pleaſure behold the good which accompanied vertue, and the euill which vice bringeth with it. Now following, in this, their footſteps, &amp; for the reaſons which I haue before alleadged, I doe with an intyre deuotion preſent to the Common-weale this lamentable Broderic Chancellour of Hungarie, Caſtalde Lieutenant vnto Ferdinand. hiſtorie, collected out of the records of Broderic, the Chauncellor of Hungarie, and out of the memorials of Caſtalde Lieutenant vnto Ferdinand in the ſame countrie, and of ſundrie other writers.

Dom.of Vladiſlaus and of Anne of Candale who came out of France; after he  had loſt his father in his noneage, and his mother at his birth, was now one and twentie yeares of age, in the yeare of our Lord 1526. when Soliman Emperour of the Turkes, inuaded Hungarie with a great and puiſant armie. He, a little before his father dyed, was betrothed to Marie, ſiſter to the Emperour 1526. 
               Charles, and Ferdinand Archduke of Auſtria, whom he afterward maried Marie Queene of Hungarie. being come to yeares of diſcretion, giuing at the ſame time his ſiſter Anne in mariage to Ferdinand. Lewis was a comely young Prince, tall and well Anne Archdutches of Auſtria. The qualities of Lewis. formed, excelling any of his age, hauing a ſingular and naturall bountie, and adorned with ſo many goodly vertues, that certainely he had proued a moſt excellent Prince, if he had liued but a longer time. He was of a ſweete  and milde ſpirite, not any thing crooked or wayward, eaſilie drawne to all things which were honeſt and iuſt, being thereto naturally inclined of himſelfe. He was greatly delighted in managing of Horſes, and to beare armes, to hunt, and all other exerciſes worthie and commendable in a young man. In his words he was true and iuſt, and no way variable or inconſtant, neither would he diſcloſe any thing which had been imparted to him in ſecret. Notwithſtanding all theſe goodly vertues, he was in contempt and diſlike among the greateſt of his court, who abuſing his young yeares did pill and ſpoyle his eſtate, whileſt they liued in all exceſſiue luſt and pleaſure. 
            
            At that time the dignitie and honour of Counte Palatine (which is the Counte Palatine. chiefe among the ſeculars next to his royall Maieſtie) was in the poſſeſſion of Stephen Battor, ſonne of Andrew Battor, and nephew to Stephen Battor, 
               Stephen Battor, Counte Palatine. Iohn Zapoly, Vayuode of Tranſiluania. who immediately before him poſſeſſed the ſame dignitie, and gouerned Tranſiluania with his great honour vnder King Mathias. Iohn Zapoly Counte of Sepuſa (who afterward was King of Hungarie) gouerned then

Tranſiluania, hauing in his poſſeſſion great ſtore of wealth to be diuided with his brother George, which they had gotten by the death and ſucceſſion  of Stephen their father. He had in ſuch ſort procured the fauour and good will of all the Nobles and States of that countrie, that, euen from his youth, euery one ſet their eye vpon him, as the right inheritour of that kingdome, if it ſo happened that, for want of lawfull heyres, it ſhould be vacant. Stephen commaunded in great Walachia, which is named Moldauia, and among Stephen of Walachia. Raoul of Tranſalpina. Francis Bathian Ban of Slauonia. the Turkes Carabogdania; and Raoul gouerned the leſſe Walachia, otherwiſe named Tranſalpina; both the one and the other neuertheleſſe being ſubiect to the kingdome of Hungarie. Francis Bathian, (well eſteemed of the King, in reſpect of his continuall and faithfull ſeruice from his youth)  was Ban of Dalmatia, Croatia, and Slauonia, which three Prouinces were altogether gouerned by this onely dignitie; which dignitie we otherwiſe tearme Admiraltie, although now this word Ban may properly be applied to all gouernours eſtabliſhed in euery Prouince that is of late added to this kingdome. The low Marches, and the fortreſſe of Themeſhwar, Peter Peren gouernour of Themeſhwar. were vnder the defence and gouernement of Peter Peren, who with the Counte of Sepuſa did keepe the royall Crowne, which was left vnto him by Emeric Peren his father. Paul Tomoree a gray Friar, and Archbiſhop of Colocenſe, Paul Tomoree, a gray Fryer, and Archbiſhop of Colocenſe, gouernour of Sirmia. commaunded Sirmia, and all that circuite which is betweene the riuers of Sauus, Drauus, and Danubius. This Archbiſhop was a great perſonage,  and of like eſteeme, and one who, before he tooke vpon him the habite of Saint Frauncis, had made ſufficient proofe of his vertue in many exploits, valiantly many times fighting againſt the enemie. The Archbiſhopricke of Colocenſe being vacant, and the poſſeſſions and profits thereof hauing no leſſe neede of a good defender, then of a Paſtor and diſpenſer of ſacred and holy things, for the late loſſe of the towne and fortreſſe of Belgrade: in a publike aſſemblie of the kingdome it was by euery one importuned, that Tomoree ſhould be forced (if he would not otherwiſe) out of his Monaſterie, and by the authoritie and commaunde of the Pope ſhould take the Paul taken againſt his will out of his Couent. charge of this Church, and defend the goods and reuenewes thereof.  This man reſiſted along time their perſwaſions; but in the end he was conſtrained to obey the Kings pleaſure, with the reſt of the kingdome; and he behaued himſelfe ſo wiſely and valiantly in this charge, in euery mans iudgement, yea euen of thoſe which hated him (as excellent vertue is neuer without enuie) that he forgat nothing which appertained to a good and aduiſed Chiefetaine, and executed no more then was ſeeming the pietie of a religious man, and a godly Biſhop, not any thing changing from the auſteritie of his firſt life, neither in perſon nor in any other thing. Counte Christopher of Francapine (being certaine moneths before drawne to the Counte Chriſtopher of Francapine. ſeruice of the Realme with faire promiſes, whereupon they had cauſed him  to forſake the Courte of the Archduke Ferdinand) in ſteede of receiuing ſome preferment according to their promiſes, in the ende was rewarded with a great iniurie, and returned againe vnto Ferdinand. Stephen Broderic, 
               Stephen Broderic Chauncelor. (borne in that part of high Panonia which ſome particularly call Slauonia) after he had been Embaſſadour for the King to the Popes holines, and had a few moneths before been created Chauncelor, had more affection to a

zealous life, then to earthly things. Alexis Thurſon (a man greatly abounding  
               Alexis Thurſon Treaſurer. in wealth according to common opinion) was Treaſurer, and had in former time executed this office very diligently. The Caſtles of Poſon and John Bornemiſſa gouernour of King Leuis. Buda were in the cuſtodie of Iohn Bornemiſſa, who had ſo great authoritie with the King, that he could incline his will to which ſide he would, becauſe he had the gouernement of him from his cradle. He was alſo very well eſteemed of euery one, as well for his reuerend olde age, as for the ſeueritie which was ſeene in him, accompanied with great bountie, and for the fidelitie which he bare towards his King. Beholde here, theſe were they who then managed the greateſt places of the kingdome.
            The other Prelates and Barons gaue themſelues euery one to their priuate Laſdilas Salcane Archbiſhop of Strigonium, Metropolitaine of Hungarie. affaires, except Laſdilas Salcane, Archbiſhop of Strigonium, Metropolitane  of the kingdome, and great Chaunceler, who, whether he was not able to execute that office any longer, or whether he had a deſire to paſſe the remainder of his life in greater content and quiet, certaine moneths before hauing reſtored to the Kings hands the priuie Seale, which then was giuen to Stephen Broderic, had neuertheleſſe a good part of the ouerſeeing of all the affaires, which were for the moſt part gouerned by his aduiſe and councell. Alſo the King repoſed great truſt in him, as well for his dignitie, age, and wiſedome, as for the experience which he had, hauing a long time managed the affaires of the State. 
            
            In this ſort was Hungarie gouerned, when newes came to King Lewis, that Solimon, hauing made peace with all his other neighbours for many yeares, prepared himſelfe to make warre againſt the Hungarians by land and water, the paſſage being ſufficiently open to perfourme this, by reaſon of the townes of Belgrade and Sabaſia which not long ſince were vnder his gouernement; and the fortreſſe of Zalankemen, and all other townes on this ſide the riuer of Sauus, vnto Varadine Peter, being raced and throwne to the ground; which compaſſe or circuite of the Countrie is yet, vntill this day, called by the auncient name of Sirmia. All this ruine and loſſe gaue Sirmia. the enemie ſuch entrance into Hungarie, that it was a difficult matter for him to be hindered from any his attempts, but as often as he thought good,  he might with eaſe thruſt himſelfe into the bowels thereof. In this low Pannonia did then gouerne Paul Tomoree, who not content to haue aduertiſed The diligence of Paul Tomoree. From whence commeth this word Coche. the King, by many meſſages, of the Turkes comming into his Realme, with all ſpeede tranſported himſelfe with poſte in little wagons, named Kotcze (which beare the name of the place, from whence the firſt of them came) towards the King, who was then at Vicegrade the twentith day of March, vnto whom he gaue notice of the Turkes enterpriſe, of his preparations, and how great the danger would be, into which he ſaw the Realme might then eaſily fall, aduertiſing him of the ſmall force which he had in his gouernement to hinder them; that it was needfull to vſe all poſſible diligence;  that it was requiſite neere Belgrade to hinder the paſſage of the riuer Sauus; and that ſuch a matter, although it was difficill, yet neuertheleſſe might be prouided for, ſo that he gaue order for it in due time; and withall promiſed to employ himſelfe in that buſines, if he would giue him neceſſaries for that purpoſe.
            
               
The King being much troubled with this newes, which elſewhere in many places was confirmed for certaine and true, appoynted a publike aſſemblie  to be held vpon Saint George his day. At that time and thither repaired all the States of euery Prouince, and determined of all things which apperteined to the defence of the kingdome: and, among other things, it was concluded, that all the Princes, as well eccleſiaſticall as ſecular, and all the nobles with good ſtore of able peaſants, ſhould be at Tholne, at the feaſt of the viſitation of our Lady the bleſſed Virgine Marie, which is the ſecond of Iune, and to march all with the King himſelfe, againſt their enemies. In the meane time the King aduiſed of that which was neceſſarie for the maintenance of the warre. He ſent his Embaſſadors to the Chriſtian Princes (eſpecially to  
               Lewis ſoliciteth the Chriſtian Princes. his neighbours) declaring to them the danger and perill, which was to them imminent. By pithie and perſwaſiue letters, and by experienced men, he ſolicited the Bohemians, Morauians, and Sleſians, to ſend him what ayde they ought him, and vrged them with their promiſes and aſſurances, which they had before giuen him to the like effect. He ſolicited the Pope as much as he could, that he would encreaſe the treaſure which he disburſed in Hungarie for the leuie of Souldiours, whereby he might haue the better meanes to defend himſelfe. But he ſolicited not Sigiſmond King of Polonia his Sigiſmond King of Polonia confederate with the Turke. Vncle, for that he a little before had made truce with the Turke, minding by that meanes to chaſe out of his kingdome the ruine and loſſe of it; ſince that  otherwiſe he could not heale it, in reſpect of the many diſſenſions and quarrels which were among the Chriſtian Princes: and Lewis very well knew the integritie of this Prince, that he was an obſeruer of his faith, and did aſſure himſelfe he would affoord him no ayde againſt him, with whom he was confederate. Alſo he had the like opinion of the Venetians.
            In this aforeſaid aſſemblie, it was graunted to the King, to take a portion of the Churches treaſure (if want did vrge him to it) to ſupplie the want of The Eccleſiaſticall treaſure leuied for the warre. his owne treaſure, which was but little, his cofers being waſted by thoſe who had very careleſlie gouerned the common wealth. This permiſſion and graunt was confirmed and approued by the Pope, for diſcharge of their  conſciences. Among thoſe who were of the Kings court, two had the Chriſtopher Francapine. Nicolas Counte Salms. charge of this warre, namely Counte Christopher (of whome we haue ſpoken before that he went to Ferdinand) and Nicholas Counte Salms.
            Theſe things and many other being thus diſpoſed of in this aſſemblie, the King, after he had aduiſed with himſelf, gaue euery one leaue to retire themſelues; and for his part, he put in practiſe and executed (as ſpeedily as hee could) that which had been determined of in the aſſemblie. And firſt of all, hee writ to the Chriſtian Princes, informing them of the preſent daunger which he ſaw, demaunding ayde of all, and chiefly of the Emperour Charles, and of Francis King of France, who a little before was deliuered out of priſon.  He inſtantly requeſted them both, that they would not forſake him in ſuch and ſo great a perill. He put the French King in minde of this, that, while he was yet priſoner, he did, by his Ambaſſadour in the towne of Piczigyton, promiſe concerning the defence and preſeruation of Hungarie; for the Francis the firſt, King of France, challenged of his promiſe. which hee frankly made him offer, and aſſured to aide him with forces and ſuccours, if God did reſtore him to his full and whole libertie. Declaring to

him that the time did now preſent it ſelfe to performe his friendly promiſes,  hauing now (by Gods aſſiſtance) the authoritie to put it in execution, and the rather, he being vrged on his part ſo vehemently to importune him thervnto. He alſo ſent vnto his brother in law Ferdinand, and to other Princes of the Empire, who then were aſſembled at the Emperiall diet at Spire. He diſpatched letters againe into Bohemia, Morauia, and Sleſia. He treated with Iohn Anthonie, Baron of Bourgh, the Popes Nuntio, Lieger with his Maieſtie, to ſolicite and intreate his holines, that he would aide him with greater ſummes of money, to ſupport the burden of this warre. He gaue commiſſion to Laſdilas Macedonien to take halfe the treaſure of the Churches, who, a Laſdilas Macedonien Biſhop of the 5. Churches. little before being Biſhop of Sirmia, was choſen Biſhop of the fiue Churches,  by the fauour of the Chauncellor, and many other; and gaue charge to Nicholas Gerendi, to haue a care of ſuch ſummes of money as ſhould bee collected, Nicholas Gerendi. and to diſtribute and diſpoſe of it onely for the maintenance of the warre, with the Nuntioes conſent. Certaine ſummes of money were alſo demaunded of the Abbots, of the gouernours of townes, and of the corporations Summes of money. of Villages, who ſaid they were free: and the like was demaunded of the Saxons, the Tranſiluanians, and the Iewes. In fine, they did on euery ſide ſo ſeeke out money, the ſinewes of warre, that within few daies was collected no ſmall quantitie of treaſure.
            During this time, letters were daily brought, meſſengers came aſwell from  the Archbiſhop of Colocenſe, as frō the Vayuode of Tranſiluania, by which vpon their knowledge they aſſured, that the Turke approched neere vnto Belgrade, and that part of his armie, which marched before, had alreadie paſſed the riuer Sauus. The King and his Councell, vpon this vnwelcommed newes, haſted all things, and principally to defend the paſſage of Drauus, ſeeing the paſſage of Sauus could not now bee hindered. But ſeeing that wee muſt often make mention of the riuers Sauus and Drauus, and of other places, it is neceſſarie that we deſcribe the ſituation of Hungarie, and, amongſt others, the parts and countries by which the enemie directed his courſe againſt the Hungarians, and by which they all marched towards him, and wherein battaile was giuen. 
            
            All Hungarie (which for certaine is now held to haue receiued this name by the Hunes, or Hungers, a people come out of Scithia, who there made The deſcription of Hungarie. The riuer Danubius. their aboade) is parted and diuided in two, by the inſition of Danubius, which is the greateſt riuer in Europe, taking his originall in the forreſt of Martian, nigh the towne of Vlmes, and ſo making his ſource ouerthwart Buda the capitall towne of Hungarie. Hungarie on this ſide the riuer. Germanie. By this diuiſion Hungarie doth part it ſelf into two parts, whereof the one is on this ſide the riuer, and the other beyond; and we write it, as if we were at Buda, which is the capitall towne of the kingdome.
            That part on this ſide the riuer is anciently called Pannonia, and is ſeparated from that, which we call beyond the riuer, by Danubius, by Auſtria, Bauaria,  
               The riuer Drauus. Slauonia. The riuer Sauus. Boſnia. Raſcia. Walko. Poſegan, and Sirmia. and the skirts of the hill Cecien. The riuer Drauus ſeparateth it from Slauonia; and the riuer Sauus from Boſnia and Raſcia. For, along the riuer of Danubius, drawing towards Belgrade, euen vnto the mouth of the riuer Sauus, doe theſe three goodly countries ſtretch themſelues, that is to ſay, Walko, Poſegan, and Sirmia, which are named Counties, and which do part

Hungarie from Slauonia. The principall towne on this hither part and ſide of the riuer is Buda, which is the capitall ſeate of the kingdome. The  moſt noted townes of fame are Alberegalis, recommended in reſpect it is The towne of Alberegalis, the place of Coronation and buriall of the Kings. the place of Coronation, and ſepultures of the Kings; Strigonium which holdeth the Metropolitane place; Fiue Churches, which is a Biſhops ſeate. Beſides there are Sopronia, Iauerin, Sabaria, and Stridon: which laſt is noted to be the place where S. Hierome was borne, and in that laſt ſauing one Saint Martin tooke his birth. Beſides the riuers of Drauus and Danubius, there are Strigonium. Fiue Churches. others worthie of note. There bee alſo two great Lakes of ſpeciall note named Balator, and Freton, one of which is about thirtie miles long, but the Sopronia. Iauerin. Sabaria. Stridon. Balator and Freton two great Lakes. Slauonia. other not being ſo long hath a more large compaſſe. When you haue paſſed  and ioyned aboue Drauus, you ſhall enter into Slauonia, which in that quarter doth coaſt this hither part beyond the riuer, which of ancient time did make part of high Pannonia, going along the ſide of Hungarie vnto the riuer Sauus; &amp; paſſing yet further, it doth ſtretch it ſelfe euen vnto ye riuer of Hune, vpon which Croatia bordereth, and is adioyned vnto Dalmatia, lying along Croatia. Dalmatia. the Adriatique ſea; part whereof is vnder the obeyſance of the Venetians, and part vnder the Turkiſh gouernment, and the leſſer part thereof is ſubiect Boſnia. Raſcia. The towne of Zagrabia. to the King of Hungarie. The Boſnians and Raſcians, who in times paſt haue been called high Miſſians, doe poſſeſſe the countries which are within the ſame, and are further from the ſea. The principall towne of Slauonia is  
               The towne of Bigihon. called Zagrabia. That of Croatia is now called Bigihon, and in times paſt it was named Fumium. That part of Dalmatia, which doth obey the Hungers, The towne of Segnia. hath for the chiefe towne Segnia. Boſnia hath Iaycza. And that of Raſſia or The towne of Iaycza. Seruia. Seruia hath Belgrade. And ſuch is the ſituation of Hungarie on this ſide the riuer, and of the countries which are betweene Danubius and the Adriatique Gulfe. The towne of Belgrade.
            
            As for the other part which is beyond Danubius, that is, by the hils Carpathes, The further Hungarie. which begin aboue Poſon, and by a long ſoyle ſtretch themſelues The riuer Tibiſcus. vnto the Euxine Sea, ſeparated from Morauia, Scleſia, Polonia, and Ruſſia vnto this Prouince, which we name Maromaruſia, in which the other mountaines The riuer Zamoſſe. and forreſts, aduancing themſelues towards Seuerin, doe ſeuer it from  
               The riuer Maroſſe. Tranſiluania, and from Valachia Tranſalpina. This furtheſt Hungarie is The townes of Poſon. Tirnauia. Trincin. watered in the midſt of it by the riuer Tibiſcus, the which, of al thoſe that are in that North part, doth moſt abound in fiſh. It doth ſpring from the mountaines Maromaruſians, and, beſides many other leſſer ſtreames, he receiueth The Ile of Comar. Nitria. Biſtricia. Vacchia. Peſthe. Agria. Caſſouia. Colocia. Bacchia. Zegedin. Varadin. Debrecin. Chenadin. into him the riuers of Zamoſſe and Maroſſe, comming both from beyond Tranſiluania. In this part of Hungarie are ſeated towards the North theſe moſt noted townes, namely, Poſon, Tirnauia, Trincin nigh ye riuer of Vagus, (which glideth towards the Ile of Comar, falling into Danubius) Nitria, Biſtricia with certaine others, ſituate among the mountaines, wherein are the Mines of Siluer and Copper. Beſides there is Vacchia Peſthe which is right  ouer againſt Buda: Agria, Caſſouia, and certaine others of the Countie of Sepuſa. Towards the South are ſeated thoſe of Colocia, Bacchia, Zegedin: and, beyond the riuer of Tibiſcus, Varadin, Debrecin, the Ladies brooke, with the Mines of gold and ſiluer: Chenadin, and the Fortreſſe of Themeſuar, Themeſuar. Mines of gold, ſiluer, &amp; tinne. which is a gouernment that poſſeſſeth the third place among al thoſe

of the kingdome. Seuerin is in the ſame preciuct, where one may ſee at this Seuerine. preſent, the reliques of a bridge, built by the commaund of the Emperour  
               Traian, and many other townes, which for the breuitie of this hiſtorie The bridge of the Emperour Traian. I will omit. Tibiſcus doth mingle it ſelfe within Danubius, neere to the towne of Titulia, ſeated on the other ſide vpon the ſhore, not farre from Varadin Titulia. Peter. On the other ſide of theſe mountaines which wee haue ſaid to extend themſelues from the hils Carpathes, vnto Seuerin, is Tranſiluania, Tranſiluania. the which in former time did make a part of Dacia, and for this cauſe it was anciently called Pannodacia, a name compounded of Pannonia and Dacia, Dacia. and at this day it is commonly called by the Hungars, Ortell. The principall towne thereof is Albe-iula, ſo called of Iulius Caeſar, or rather of Hijula, 
               Albe-iula. Prince of the Huns. Beſides this towne, there bee others which are rich  and wealthie, namely, Sibinio, Braſſouia, Coloſuar, Biſtricia, and many other, Sibinio. Braſſouia. Coloſuar. Biſtricia. Saxon. Sicilians. founded and built by the Germanes, whom we call Saxons. There doth alſo inhabite in this Prouince, Sicilians, who are a people auſtere, ſtoute, and warlike; they haue not any diſtinction of Nobilitie, nor of peaſants, but they follow the ſame conditions as the Swiſſers doe. Tranſiluania is abounding in all things, principally in Mines of gold and ſiluer, and other mettals, and of The riches of Tranſiluania. Salt Mines. It breedeth couragious and excellent horſes, and bringeth forth great quantitie of wine, but not ſo excellent as that of Hungaria, or of Slauonia. It is compaſſed about with both the Valacchians, Tranſalpina, and Moldauia.  
               Valacchia. Tranſalpina. Moldauia. Tranſalpina is vpon Danubius, and Moldauia by the Euxin Sea. Theſe two with Tranſiluania, doe now comprehend this part of Europe, which by ancient writers was called Dacia. Therefore all this great circute, that is beyond Danubius, which containeth not only further Hungarie, but Dacia. alſo Tranſiluania, with both the Valacchians, is incloſed of Danubius, of the hils Carpathes, and of the Euxin Sea, but ſpecially of Danubius. And thus much for the generall ſcituation of Hungarie.
            Now wee muſt a little diſcourſe more particularly of the places, wherein happened all the force and vigour of the warre. Beneath Buda, a long the riuer ſide (beſides other villages) is the towne of Rakos, and neere vnto that, Rakos. Tholne. Batha. Mohacz. is Tholne, which is threeſcore Hungriſh miles from Buda: after that, followeth  Batha, and conſequently Mohacz, otherwiſe called Mugach, ſcituate vpon the ſtroude of Danubius. Mohacz towards the right hand regardeth the towne of 5. Churches, which before the loſſe of Hungary was of great fame; it is foure miles from Danubius, and three from Drauus. Towards Drauus is the towne Socloſia; and beyond Drauus is built the Fortreſſe of Valpo. Socloſia. Valpo. Beyond Mugach vnto Drauus is counted foure miles, and a little more. On the other ſide the mouth of Drauus, vpon the ſhoare, is ſeated the towne of Ezeck, and in the ſame quarter, in times paſt, was to be ſeene, the Monuments Ezeck. or remembrances of a certaine towne, built in the time when the Romanes enioyed the Pannoniaes, which (it may be) was a Romane Colonie.  Theſe ruines are ſeene two miles of, from the entring of Drauus into Danubius. At the place where this towne of Ezeck is, the riuer Drauus doth cloſe himſelfe narrow, giuing commodity to the Hungars to erect a bridge, where their armie paſſed ouer, when Belgrade was taken by the Turkes. After the towne of Ezeck, followeth the Caſtle of Erdunde, belonging to the Prouoſt Erdunde.
               
of Thitetie. This place is enuironed with a Forreſt, and in reſpect of the ſcituation thereof, with a little labour, it may bee made very ſtrong. Beneath  this Caſtle is Baroth, Walko, Zatha, and next Bachia, which is one of the Baroth. Walko. Zatha. Bachia an Archbiſhoprick. Wilak. Sirmia a wealthie countrie. Metropolitane townes of Hungary, ſituate in the plaine, ſo that it is naturally all the whole circuite of the countrie, which is betweene Tibiſcus and Danubius, and for this cauſe it is very commodious to breede ſtore of cattell. Along Danubius, beneath Zatha, is ſeene Wilak, with his excellent Fortreſſe, and there beginneth this fortunate and firtile countrie of Sirmia, not onely abounding in wine, the moſt commended of all the Northerne parts, but alſo in all neceſſarie things for the vſe of man: and hath been renowmed by ſo many Emperours, and from whence is ſprong a man who hath greatly adorned the Romane and Apoſtolike ſea. The countries of the ſame, yeeld  pleaſant and delightfull places; the land is fat, and fruitfull, as may bee; the ayre is ſo temperate, that it is not eaſily to bee credited: the which falleth out, by reaſon this Region is but three or foure daies iourney at the moſt from the Adriatique ſea. It had in former time a towne which carried his name, of the which, at this preſent is ſeene no more, but the foundatiō or reliques thereof. When you are paſt Wilake, you enter into this Prouince, and the firſt towne you come into is Bannomoſtra, where is the Biſhops Bannomoſtra. Varadin Peter. ſeate of Sirmia: and before you arriue at Varadin Peter we finde by the way Kamanche, a towne of good account. This towne of Varadin Peter, with Kamanche. Zalonkemen. the Caſtle, is ſubiect to the Church of Coloſence, and for the loſſe of Belgrade,  it was afterward called the place of Belgrade. After Varadin is the towne of Zalonkemen, and certaine others which haue bin ruinated by the late loſſe happened to Belgrade. On this ſide the riuer Sauus, is the Caſtle of Zemlen, and betweene that and the towne of Belgrade, is the mouth of Sauus, Zemlen. Belgrade. which in that place, by reaſon of the entrance thereof into Danubius, maketh it a large and deepe current, which is enioyed by the towne of Belgrade, ſo much renowmed for famous battailes, being fought in that place againſt the Turke, which being once almoſt ſurpriſed by the enemie, Iohn Huniades, then gouernour of Hungarie, father to King Mathias, with his brother Iohn Capistrum, chaſed out of Hungarie Amurath the Turkiſh Emperour, Iohn Capiſtrum. 
                leauing, by that valorous meanes, an immortall glorie to the name of Hungarie. The Hungars call this Fortreſſe Nandor-Albe, and ſome Albegrecque: Nandor-Albe. Albe-grecque. Taurinum. the ancients call it Taurinum, and at this day it is called Griechſuueiſneburg. It is placed vpon a ſteepe Rock, which on that ſide Hungarie is ſeene, and at the foote thereof is the towne, hauing on the one ſide Sauus, and on the other Danubius.
            And thus much for the ſituation of Hungarie, and the places wherein the Hungars haue receiued an incurable and deſperate wound. As for the riches of this countrie, to ſay the trueth, it exceedeth all the Prouinces in Europe. But we will ſay no more hereof at this time, for that it would require a large  volume: but let vs content our ſelues with the ſituation which wee haue alreadie deſcribed, to the end the reader of this hiſtorie may the better comprehend the diſcourſe following.
            And now to come to the ſubiect of our diſcourſe. The King vnderſtanding that certaine troupes of Turkes had alreadie paſſed Sauus, fearing that

they marched to Drauus, and that (before his comming) they ſhould ſeaze  vpon the towne of Ezeck, aduiſed with himſelfe to defend that place with a ſtrong garriſon. And this charge was giuen to the Counte Palatine, who at that time was remaining in a Caſtle not farre from Drauus, which belonged to his brother. He willingly receiued this commaundement, although hee was much troubled with the gowte, which a long time had moleſted him. But thoſe that ſhould haue been put into that place, or ſent their people thither, were not ſo diligent as the neceſſitie required: in regard whereof Counte Palatine could not execute that which hee deſired to performe: whereupon hee went to the King at Buda, who made recitall of the negligence and ſlouthfulnes of thoſe who had no will to aſſiſt and aide him, to  effect the charge which was committed to his cuſtodie. Whereupon it followed that he went not from the Court, but ſtaied there to accompanie the King in his iourney. In this time, and euen at the ſame inſtant, the King by letters was aduertiſed from a certaine perſon (who had ample and ſufficient knowledge of the counſell and affayres of the enemie) that there was no better policie for him, then to cauſe the Vayuode of Tranſiluania to march forward with Tranſalpina (the fidelitie and alleadgance of whom towards the King was moſt aſſured) either to aſſaile the enemie behinde (of which they nothing miſtruſted) or elſe they leauing them, to iourney into Thrace (which was naked of ſouldiours) whileſt the Turkes aduanced themſelues againſt the King. For by this meanes the enemie ſhould either bee ouerthrowne  and defeated, (being incloſed betweene two armies) or elſe forced to forſake his enterpriſe, and returne to defend his owne. This counſell at the beginning was ſuſpected for certaine cauſes, which would be too long to rehearſe: but afterward imparted to the Biſhop of Strigonium, and approued by him, the Vayuode of Tranſiluania was commanded by Vrbine Batian (who then was diſpatched to go into Moldauia) to aduiſe vpō this what was moſt expedient and behoofull to be done for the ſafegard of the kingdome. And if he eſteemed the counſell good, he was commanded to turne his forces, and thoſe of Tranſiluania, with Tranſalpina alſo towards that quarter: and this in part was a ſpeciall cauſe that the Vayuode could not be preſent at  the day of battaile. During theſe counſels, the time of the aſſemblie, and the rende vous appointed to be at Tholne, was already expired: yet neuertheleſſe they were not yet in readines, and it ſeemed that all were not plyable therevnto, but only the King: neither (ſaid they) ought they to come to Tholne, before they vnderſtood of the Kings being there.
            In the meane while the bruite of the Turkes approaching, and of his paſſage of Sauus daily increaſed, in ſuch ſort, that in the end certaine newes came, that after, hee paſſing the riuer, and hauing throwne downe certaine Caſtles, hee held on his courſe towards Varadin Peter, and did beſiege it both by land and water, though it were a towne of no great force. In the end  the King, although not any were come neither from Bohemia, nor from any other place, and though he had with him but few companies of ſouldiours, Lewis goeth into the field. yet not willing to be reproued as tardie or negligent concerning this matter of import, he departed from Buda (called at this day Ofen) the 24. of Iuly, Ofen. marching along the ſhoare of Danubius, comming by little and little to

Tholne, hoping that the other would ſhortly come to him.
            A little before the King went from Buda, Stephen Battor of Somlie was  ſent to the Vayuode of Tranſiluania, by whom hee was commaunded, that leauing the firſt aſſignements, he ſhould haſte himſelfe towards his Maieſtie with all his Tranſiluanian forces, ſeeing the ſudden ariuall of the enemie did require it.
            When the King departed from Buda he had but 3000. men as well foote as horſe, counting thoſe that did belong to Queene Marie, and the Archbiſhop of Strigonium. The firſt day that they departed from Buda, they made their nights reſt at the village of Ambroiſe Sarkan, named Erd, diſtant from Buda two miles. In that place the Kings beſt horſe, and that which he loued moſt, ſuddenly dyed, whereupon he was much diſquieted, and many diuined  it to preſage euill hap. The King hauing made his aboade there certaine daies, and no aide comming to him, proceeded on, with thoſe ſmall troupes which he had, to the next village named Erchij. There hauing ſpent many daies, without effecting any good, in the meane time there arriued Andrew Battor, one of the principall of that kingdome, with a good number of ſouldiours, and they marched along Danubius vnto Pantelee (which is a place, as we haue ſaid, of Ezeck) where is to be ſeene the remaindes of an auncient Romane Colonie. There George Baſi (comming from the Vayuode of Tranſiluania) found the King, who imparted vnto his Maieſtie that the Vayuode was in great care what he ſhould doe, in reſpect of the diuerſitie of meſſages  which hee had ſent him, hauing firſt receiued letters from his Maieſtie, and afterwards by many Curreers, and namely by Iaſpar Horuuath of Wimgard, one of his chiefe gentlemen, by which he was commaunded to come to the King; and that afterwards there arriued Vrbain Batian, who brought him certaine ſpecialties, that according to the former, he might aſſaile the enemie behinde with the Tranſalpinians: after him there arriued Stephen Battor of Somlie, who brought him the ſame and firſt commaund, but did not make it openly knowne to him, that the King did meane, that the aduertiſements ſent by Batian ſhould come to effect; and for that occaſion he was vncertaine what to doe in ſo many alterations, not knowing which to follow, being neuertheleſſe  readie and willing to doe what his Maieſtie would commaund him. And that neuertheleſſe he found not any thing of more importance, then with all ſpeede to come to the King, that it was now too late to aſſaile the Turkes behinde: and in as much as that enterpriſe was daungerous, ſo was it alſo more hard now to execute it, then at the firſt, for that the Tranſalpinian (with whom he was commaunded to ioyne himſelfe) was alreadie forced to ſend his only ſonne in hoſtage to the Turkes Campe. The King vnderſtanding the charge of George Baſi, diſlodged, and arriued the ſame morning at the towne of Felduar, ſituated by Danubius: and there conferred with his Councell of that which Baſi had reported to him. At the ſame  inſtant he alſo commanded Baſi to iourney day and night with as great diligence as he could to the Vayuode, and to tell him that the King allowed wel of his counſell, and that it was ſound and good, conſidering that the enemie had alreadie entered into the kingdome, and marched towards him: and that therefore he leauing all other determinations, he ſhould as well with all

all the Tranſiluanians, as thoſe which he met in the way comming towards  him, make haſte, and with all expedition come to the Campe, bringing with him not onely the Nobilitie and priuate ſouldiours, but alſo euen the peaſants themſelues.
            To this effect letters were diſpatched vnto the Tranſiluanians, to Iohn Gozthan, Chauncellor to the Queene, and Biſhop of that Prouince, and to the Vayuode, by the perſwaſion of George, who deſired the ſame, according to the aduice that he had receiued of the King his maſter. Theſe letters were of purpoſe framed ſharpe and ſeuere, and ſent, to the end that the Vayuode ſhould ſhew them to all, whereby to excite and animate euery one. He was ſpecially commanded by them, vpon paine of diſloialtie and treaſon, that he  ſhould day and night march to the King. To incourage euery one the more, there was ſent with George Baſi, Iohn Statile, a man of readie and quicke wit, and well ſeene in learning. He was, by meanes of their ſiſter, nephew to Peter Berizlas Biſhop of Veſprimie, and to Martin Ban, a man greatly eſteemed both in the affayres of peace and warre.
            Theſe meſſengers were not yet departed, when euen then euill tidings Varadin Poter taken by the Turkes. came of the taking of Varadin Peter, which the Hungars otherwiſe call Petrouar, after it had been valiantly defended for many daies, and all thoſe who were within it, for the defence thereof, were cruelly put to the ſword; the Caſtle being old and decayed, was the more ruinated by the force of the Cannon; and further, that the enemies did aduance themſelues by water  and land againſt other neighbour places, and were determined, amongſt others, to beſiege the Caſtle of Wylatz. The King greatly perplexed at theſe newes, gaue expreſſe commandement to thoſe who were to goe to the Vayuode, that they ſhould poſte in the greateſt haſte they could. Letters were alſo ſent to all places; Curriers were diſpatched towards George Counte of Sepuſa, who was ſaid not to be farre from Alberegalis with 5000. men. Alſo vnto Francis Bathian Ban of Croatia. Vnto Counte Chriſtopher, who was thought to be departed from Ferdinand, and to bee alreadie in Croatia with his father, vnto whom hee was firſt of all retired, with an intent to haue drawne from thence armour, horſes, and ſouldiours, that ſo he might with  better abilitie preſent himſelfe in brauer equipage before the King. Ladiſlas the Macedonian, was commanded to go with ſpeed towards the Queene, who then was at Buda. She was willed to importune her brother Ferdinand, and in his abſence the gouernours of Auſtria, to the end that it would pleaſe him preſently to ſend him aide, and eſpecially Artillerie, for which hee had been before required, and whereof the Hungars ſtood greatly in neede, and the Turkes to the contrarie were plentifully furniſhed. Moreouèr, ſhe was intreated to haſten the Bohemians with their troupes, for the leauying of whom the Queene had disburſed of her owne charges great ſummes of money to Mezericie. Thomas Nadaſdy was written vnto, that he ſhould ſolicite  
               Ferdinand, vnto whom he was ſent, and to declare to him the double linage and affinitie which was betweene them two, and the common perill like to happen; in conſideration whereof, he importuned that he would not leaue his maſter in ſuch and ſo great neceſſitie, giuing him ſufficient notice of the danger of his perſon, of the kingdome, and the loſſe of Varadin Peter.
            
               
In the meane while Paul Tomoree (who before the taking of Varadin, hauing with him 3000. men, left within the Caſtle of that towne 1000. footmen,  and certaine horſe, who were (as wee haue ſaid) all put to the ſword) eſteeming it now a great raſhnes, if he ſhould aduenture to oppoſe and affront himſelfe with 2000. horſe againſt ſo great a multitude, he paſſed to the other ſide of Danubius, and there, as much as was poſſible for him, he withſtood the enemie both by land and water: for he had vpon Danubius certaine numbers of ſea ſouldiours in veſſels, which are called Nazadies; but they were nothing to bee compared to the infinite multitude of the enemies.
            The King, after he had vnderſtoode of the loſſe of Varadin Peter, marched  along Danubius, to that place which before we haue named Rakos, where he remained two dayes, and vpon the transfiguration of our Lord, he arriued at Tholne, hauing now a little encreaſed his armie, ſo that then he could make 4000. horſe, or ſomewhat more. As his Maieſtie was neere to Tholne, Counte Palatine, with thoſe few men which were alreadie come and arriued with the firſt at that towne, went before. During the Kings abode there, from all the Prouinces (which are called Counties) Prouinces called Counties. in Hungarie, as well on this ſide Danubius, as on the other, repaired great ſtore of Souldiours to this towne. Counte George of Sepuſa was alſo there with 300. horſe good and bad, and 1200. foote, or there abouts. Thither Succours from the Pope. alſo came Hanibal Carthaginois of Cyprus, with 1300. Souldiours, leauied  at the Pope charges, beſides other companies that were there payed by his Holines. They altogether made 4000. men well appointed. Of that number there was 1500. Polanders or Pollacques, who in all that, for which Pollanders came to the ſuccour. they are helde commendable people, ſurpaſſe all the reſt, they were vnder the conduct of Leonard Gnomsky, who was ſayd to be a man very expert and ingenious to lodge and ſeate a Campe, for which experience he was choſen and allowed. At the ſame inſtant came to that towne Paul Vardagy Biſhop of Agria: Francis Peren Biſhop of Varadin, and many other, as well Biſhops as Seculars. During their abode, almoſt euery day they ſate in  Councell, to whom were aſſiſting the moſt renowned perſons then in the Campe. In this ſaid aſſemblie, the affayres of the Realme were conſulted vpon, namely, of the aduauncing and marching of the Armie, of the cuſtodie and defence of the paſſage of Drauus, ſeeing it was now no queſtion of that of Sauus, and alſo by reaſon of the loſſe of Varadin Peter, and for that at the ſame time, it was ſayd the Turkes marched to Ezek, hauing alreadie vnder his gouernment the Fortreſſe of Wylak, and ruinated all the other Wylak taken by the Turks. Caſtles which were along Danubius. The ſayd Counte Palatine was then preſently diſpatched to ſeize vpon the paſſage of Drauus, before the enemie approaced. Many of the principall men were commaunded to follow  
               The priueledges of the Barons of Hungarie. with their troupes; but many notwithſtanding repugned the Kings commaunde, vnder the colour of their priueledges and cuſtome of the Barons, which is, not to goe to the warre, but vnder the Royall enſigne: in regarde whereof this enterpriſe was omitted, although that the Palatine, notwithſtanding his griefe, did endeauour himſelfe, and gaue ſufficient demonſtration, not to refuſe any trauaile or labour. He being on his iourney to goe

before to Mugach or Mohacz, and not being followed by any of thoſe,  who were commaunded to accompanie him, alleadging their priueledges, as we haue ſayd: the King euen in open Councell, where the affayres were treated of, being moued by their vndutifull allegeance, ſayd; I ſee, quoth he, (being willing to put his words in writing) that euery one would aſſure his owne head, by the danger of mine. But as for my part, I am marched, as you ſee, euen vnto this place, and doe willingly thruſt my ſelfe into this danger, and to expoſe my perſon againſt all hazards of fortune, for the ſafetie of you and the kingdome. For feare then leaſt any ſhould excuſe his owne cowardlines vpon the ſafetie of my life, and that nothing ſhould be imputed to my proceedings in time to come, I will (by Gods grace) march to morrow with you in perſon, into that place which you would not  goe vnto without me.
            
            Theſe vehement words being ſpoken, and this ſuddaine reſolution being apprehended by the applauding of many, but with the admiration of all thoſe preſent; proclamation was preſently made of his departure the next day. Certaine of the wiſer and grauer heads, who were not ignorant of the great inconuenience which might happen of this vnconſiderate voyage, importuned to diſſwade the contrarie, but it was in vaine. The Armie being then diſlodged from Tholne, vpon the euen of the aſſumption of our Ladie, they arriued at the towne of Zeckzard, and the day following at Batha. Vpon this bruite and certaine knowledge which was had of the Turkiſh  Armie, which daily approached, commaund was giuen to gather the Hungars together (who were diſperſed in the Villages) and to repaire all to Batha. George Pauline Biſhop of Boznia, a man of good and commendable life, and well ſeene in the ciuill Law, was ſent vnto Paul Tomoree to aduertiſe him of what he knew, and that he ſhould finde the King in that place.
            They being all arriued in this towne, and the time requiring to make election of ſome one to commaunde the Armie (which was deferred vntill that day, not without great ill hap of ouerſight:) the King hauing heard the particular aduiſe of euery one, and ſeeing the greateſt part eſteemed the Paul Tomoree a graie Fryer chiefe commaunder of the Armie. 
                Frier to be ſufficient for this charge, proclaymed him chiefe commaunder of the Armie, ioyning with him for his colleague, Counte George of Sepuſa, brother to the Vayuode. Yet all of them notwithſtanding approued not this election, and chiefly they diſliked that election which was made of the Fryer: neuertheleſſe all willingly obeyed theſe Chiefetaines commaund.
            
               Tomoree knowing the pleaſure of the King to be ſuch, for his owne parte refuſed of a long time this charge, ſometime alleadging his profeſſion and ignorance, then the corporall imbecilitie which was in him, not being able to endure ſo great trauaile; ſaying further, that the King had excellent ſecular Lords, to whom this charge did better appertaine. He named the  Counte Palatine there preſent, and the Vayuode abſent, both well experienced in the conduct of Armies, and that they were the moſt practiſed and experienced in all Hungarie, to employ their commaund in ſuch actions. He alſo named Counte George, and Peren, who although they were young, yet neuertheleſſe had no defect of vnderſtanding, and men who were more

worthie to manage and conduct this armie then he. Further, he declared  the diſabilitie which was in himſelfe, to performe the due of ſuch a charge, hauing neuer ſeene the manner of ſuch warre, as now preſented it ſelfe vnto his Maieſtie: and in the end he concluded he was not able, neither would he vſe that authoritie, although the King commaunded it, no, if his Maieſtie would cut off his head.
            Hauing thus as well in publike, as in priuate, vſed theſe or the like ſpeeches, with like proteſtations in vaine: the King notwithſtanding proclaymed him Lieutenant of the Armie, giuing him (as we haue ſayd) Counte George, brother of the Vayuode, for his companion and colleague. He alſo would not haue accepted of this charge, and inſtantly deſired that his Maieſtie  would not doe him that honour. But in the end he ſubmitted himſelfe to doe therein his endeauour, with this condition, that he might haue no other companion but his brother Paul (for ſo he called him) and that ſo ſoone as his owne brother the Vayuode ſhould arriue, it ſhould be permitted him to be diſmiſſed of his charge. This was eaſily graunted him, for that alreadie it was determined at the beginning to make the Vayuode, with Paul Tomoree and Counte Christopher, commaunders of the Armie.
            After the election of theſe Chieftaines, they went together to take councell, concerning a place conuenient and commodious to incampe themſelues neere the towne of Mohacz. This towne apperteyned to the Biſhopricke  of fiue Churches, and is ſcituated vpon the ſide of Danubius, betweene The diſcription of Mohacz and the place of the battaile. Batha and the mouth of Drauus. A little aboue Batha, Danubius doth begin to open, and make two currants, of which the largeſt ſtreame runneth a long the further Hungrie, and paſſeth with a gentle calme ſource, ſtretching it ſelfe in thoſe great and large plaines. The other part watereth the townes of Batha and Mohacz. Theſe two armes of one riuer, ioyning together againe in one, and ſhutting vp beneath Mohacz, make an Iland. This borrowgh or towne of Mohacz, is ſufficiently knowen: it is enuironed on all ſides with a great plaine, which is not any thing couered either with woods or hills. Towards the Weſt, it looketh to the towne of fiue Churches, a towne of good fame  before the loſſe thereof. On the North ſide there is the towne of Batha; and towards the Leauant, it is bathed with that arme of Danubius, which we haue ſayd to be the leſſe of the two. Towards the South, it doth behold the waters of Drauus, which is foure miles from it. Betweene that and this towne, are certaine little hilles, planted with Vines and Mariſhes there abouts. In this compaſſe there is not farre from the towne a water, which ſeemed rather to be a Mariſh, then a water or riuer that did runne: and the inhabitants doe call it Kraſſo. Beneath that ſtange, Tomoree was incamped with fiue or 6000. horſe, who were part of thoſe which at the firſt were gathered together, and part of others, who with Peter Peren, and other Captaines,  he cauſed to come from beyond Danubius by the Kings commaund, to ioyne together with the bodie of the Armie.
            The place then being choſen commodious, to lodge the Armie by Mohacz, and the ſame being directed and appointed by Leonard Gnomsky, and the quarters thereof for euery companie: Tomoree went with Peter Peren to his Souldiours, who were yet incamped beyond the Mariſhes (as hath been

ſaid) to leade them, if they could, to the Kings Campe. They being now arriued  at that place, and giuing notice to the Captaines, that it was the Kings pleaſure, and his alſo, to commaund them to retire, and ioyne themſelues to the bodie of the armie, wherein the King was in perſon. Hereupon the ſouldiours began to murmure, and be angrie, ſaying, that they would make them abandon the enemie, againſt whom it was more needfull to march, and with whom it was expedient forthwith to ioyne their hands, if they would ſhew themſelues men: and in doing the contrarie, it were an imagination of flying, and not to fight: that thoſe Princes who counſelled his Maieſtie to ſuch effeminate things, were giuen much to ſlouth: that the King (ſaid they) ſhould come preſently and affront the enemie with them: the victorie is  within our hands: we ſufficiently know that they are infinite in number, and that they haue as many Cannons with them as is poſſible, but they are without armour, and not any thing exerciſed to the warre: there is not the tenth, no not the twentith of them, which hath a weapon wherewith to offend or harme vs: they further alleadged, that they were aſſured that thoſe braue and valiant ſouldiours, which the Turke had, were all dead and ſlaine at the ſiege of Belgrade, and after that at Rhodes: that the valiant and couragious Commaunders of the armie ſhould doe (ſaid they) with their companions, that which beſeemed wiſe and vertuous Captaines, and we aſſure our ſelues that all things ſhall frame to our deſires: that he would bring the King, and  withdraw him, &amp; all the other hardy combattants out of the throng of thoſe idle Prieſts, &amp; others who refuſeth the fight, who go about by their faſhions and counſels, which is cowardly and effeminate, to corrupt and diſcourage our King, who is indued with corporall beautie, and marueilous courage, and by this their idle meanes, of a fayre and well accompliſhed yong Prince, they ſhould make him anſwerable vnto themſelues.
            Whileſt theſe ſouldiours did thus vaunt themſelues, all the armie was lodged almoſt intirely together, euery man in his quarter. The King did not yet depart from the towne of Ville-neufue of the Macedonians, which is betweene Batha and Mohacz, hauing with him but a ſmall troupe, being there in great danger, if the enemie, who was not farre of, might haue diſcouered  him. But fortune reſerued the death of the King vntill ſome other time, wherein he ſhould dye more gloriouſly for the good of his countrie. In the meane while, in the night whē the King was aſleep, there arriued at the ſame time Michael Podnamisky, cōming from the Campe, and ſent on the behalfe of the Commanders, who came to giue aduertiſement, that the Turk had alreadie paſſed the riuer of Drauus, with the greateſt part of his armie, and that the reſt followed with all expedition; that the fight could not be deferred; that all the Captaines vrgently importuned his Maieſtie to come with all diligence to the Campe, and aduiſe with them concerning the battaile. 
            
            The King vnderſtanding this newes by Podnamisky, called to councell that ſmall companie that was with him, acquainting them with this buſines, demaunding of them what was to be done in ſo doubtfull and vrgent a matter. His Maieſtie then did call to minde the counſell and opinion which the Vayuode and Counte Christopher had ſent him, by thoſe who were diſpatched towards them, who certaine daies before were returned, by which aduertiſement

from them both, they greatly blamed the counſell of thoſe who had brought the King into that place ſo neere the enemy, before it was time,  and that it had been better for him to remaine at Buda, or to encampe himſelfe further frō the enemie, vntill all the forces of the kingdome were vnited together. They had alſo, by the ſame meſſengers, exhorted the King not to fight with the enemie, at leaſt not before their comming. The Vayuode particularly ſent him word by Iohn Statile, that hee would bring with him from Tranſiluania great troupes of ſouldiours, who for force and number ſhould be ſo ſecure, that the King, vpon their fidelitie and valour, might haue a ſpeciall hope of victorie. This came into the Kings minde, and he well conſidered of this counſell; and of the other part he well weighed that which the Chiefes of the armie did importune him, to whom if he condiſcended not,  the enemie being ſo nigh, and his ſouldiours hauing ſo great a deſire to fight, he well ſaw that the blame and euill of all that might happen, would bee imputed to him, and that he ſhould bee found culpable in omitting ſo good an occaſion. His minde being diſturbed with theſe difficulties, he determined (before hee reſolued of any thing) to proue his Leaders and Chieftaines of the armie, if they thought it good to attend the Vayuode of Tranſiluania, and Counte Christopher, and that if in the meane time the enemie approached neerer, or preſſed, them, whither they ſhould remoue the Campe into ſome other place of better ſafetie. For this cauſe he ſent to the Campe (euen at the ſame inſtant that Podnamisky was come) the Chauncellor (who was  then with the King) to perſwade the principall of the armie, yea the Commanders themſelues, namely, the Archbiſhop of Strigonium, and Counte Palatine (vpon whoſe opinion all the others depended) that they ſhould find out ſome good meane to retire and deferre the fight. He was commaunded further to let them vnderſtand, all which was reported to the King, concerning the Vayuode and Counte Chriſtopher, and to explaine vnto them how cleere and apparant the ruine of the kingdome was, if the King, with ſo many Princes, and the flower of all the Nobilitie of the realme, ſhould expoſe themſelues to ſo eminent a daunger. For if it happened (which we ought to be mindfull of, conſidering the multitude of ſouldiours, and the great preparation  for warre of the enemies, in compariſon of the ſmall number of his Maieſties forces which he now hath) that the King ſhould bee ouercome, who ſhould afterwards hold backe or hinder the enemie, but that with little difficultie he might enioy all Hungarie? He declared vnto them, that it was moſt expedient the Campe ſhould bee remoued into ſome other place of better ſecuritie, or to retire backe a little, if the enemie ſhould inforce them thereto, vntill the Vayuode with the Tranſiluanians, the Ban with the Slauonians, Counte Chriſtopher with the Croatians, Bohemians, Morauians, Sleſians, and other ſuccours ſhould come: that Hungarie ſhould  receiue leſſe loſſe, though the enemies ſhould ouerharrie from Mohacz vnto Poſon, putting all whatſoeuer they did incounter to fire and ſword, then that ſuch an armie ſhould miſcarrie and bee ouerthrowne by one battaile, in which the King himſelfe, and ſo many great Princes, and chiefe perſons of the realme ſhould be. For they being ſlaine, what hope of reenforcing new ſuccours, could reſt to the kingdome? But the King, with

ſo many Lords, and ſuch braue ſouldiours remaining ſafe, and preſeruing all  things in good eſtate, they may finde ſingular content and ſecuritie vnder the gouernment of ſuch a King, who both for his parentage and alliance, is reſpected throughout all Chriſtendome.
            The Chauncellor hauing the ſame night made this ſpeech, firſt of all to the chiefeſt, viſiting and talking with them apart, and after in generall to all the Councell: his reaſons neuertheleſſe were of ſo ſmall efficacie, as if he had ſaid nothing to them: ſuch was the haughtie courage of euery one, being eager to fight vnder a vaine hope of victorie, being notwithſtanding otherwiſe by a certaine feare withheld, which did hinder them from diſſwading the fight, although the contrarie was ſo earneſtly deſired by the ſouldiours. 
            
            The King then came by breake of day to his Campe, and for that the veſſels which did bring by water his Maieſties Tents and Pauilions, were not yet come from Buda, he retired himſelf for the preſent into a Biſhops houſe, which was adioyning to the towne, there to proue that, which as yet he vnderſtood not by the Chauncellor. They commaunded the Councellors of all eſtates and nations, to aſſemble before the King, which failed not preſently to viſit him with many expert Captaines and hardie ſouldiours, among whom were certaine Bohemians and Morauians, who were alreadie arriued there. In this aſſemblie it was propounded to the Councellors and ſouldiours what was needfull to be done, not any being yet come from  Tranſiluania, Slauonia, Croatia, Bohemia, nor Germanie, whereof the greater part were preſently to arriue, as was aſſuredly expected: yet notwithſtanding the enemie was very nigh, being no more then two miles from the Kings Campe, who vpon this occaſion, as it was thought, could not, nor would not, deferre the battaile vntill another time. Vpon this, their opinion was asked which of theſe two ſeemed moſt expedient, either to remoue the Campe elſewhere, and for the preſent to delay the fight, attending thoſe which daily were expected; or elſe to make triall of fortune in giuing the enemie battaile. At this councell was preſent Paul Tomoree, who Paul Tomoree aduiſeth to fight. the night before, was commaunded to come from the other Campe for the  ſame purpoſe. Hee thought it not amiſſe to fight. The King marueiling vpon what hope he had ſuch courage, would willingly haue diſſwaded him from ſuch a purpoſe, and demanded of him, in the preſence of all the Councell, of what ſtrength his forces were, and the ſtrength of the enemie. For there was no doubt but that he very well knew it, yea better then any other, by meanes of his diſcouerers and ſpials, which alwaies he ſent and had in the enemies Campe, and by reaſon alſo of many enemies which daily reſorted to him. Tomoree anſwered; touching the firſt point, in his iudgement, he thought that there were no more but 20000. fighting men, as well in the Kings Campe, as in his (thoſe two being diuided, as wee haue ſayd):  but that for certaine he knew the enemie was 300000. The ſtanders by being greatly aſtoniſhed to heare their number ſo ſmall, in reſpect of the great multitude of the enemies: Tomoree preſently adioyned vnto his former ſpeeches, that for al their multitude they were not to feare thē, in regard that their great number was for the moſt part without armour, and not any thing

acquainted with the warre. The King further demaunded, how many he thought the enemies were, armed, and in ſtate to fight. Tomoree anſwered,  that they were 70000. This number ſeemed yet to all, ouer great, in reſpect of the Kings armie, euery one affirming, that Tomoree ſaid, the Turkes had 300. great Cannons.
            In the meane time whileſt that theſe affaires were conſidered of, as well by the couſell and inſtigation of the Fryer, as by the deſire, and courage of all the ſouldiours, greatly importuning to fight (except ſuch, whowere, I know not how, poſſeſt by a fooliſh feare, that durſt not proffer themſelues, nor openly declare their opinions:) there came at that time certaine meſſengers from the other Campe, who being admitted before the Councell, ſayd, that  they were charged to impart ſome matter in the behalfe of thoſe of the other Campe, as well to the King, as to the Councell, and then being in place apart, acquainted the King with the effect of their meſſage, and after went in againe with the King to the Councell, who in the name of all the reſt which had ſent them, aduertiſed them not to diſſwade the King from fight: that they were well aſſured of the enemies force, although they were of farre greater number: that the victorie was alreadie in their hands, ſo that they would preſently ayde them with that good fortune, which God did preſent vnto them. Beſides, they encouraged all the Lords who were of the Councell, to march forward with the King, and ioyne his Campe  to theirs, which was neerer the enemie, and lodged in a place more commodious to aſſaile them. In the end, inſteed of gentle perſwations, they vſed threatning tearmes againſt thoſe, who diſſwaded the King to the contrarie, denouncing to them death, and aſſuring them, that if they would not preſently ioyne the Kings Campe with theirs, they would without delay march againſt them, and force the enemies to acquite themſelues from thence.
            Vpon ſuch ſpeeches ſo vehemently vrged in the Counell, the Kings preſence, and of all the other Lords; there being alſo thoſe among them, who were of a founder and deeper iudgement, for the good of the common  weale, and yet being greatly terrified by ſuch vnciuill threatning: they concluded to giue them battaile, without expecting that the Vayuode, Counte Christopher, or the Bohemians, could in time arriue at the day of battaile. Francis Bathian, Ban of Croatia, (who was at that time not farre from the fiue Churches with his troupes of Slauonians) gaue ſome hope to be at the Campe within two daies, as it afterward fell out. There were ſome among them (after all things being determined, and the Councell riſen) that did greatly blame the reſolution, which was determined, ſo ſuddainely to fight. Francis Peren Biſhop of Varadin was one of them, a man young, quicke, and of a braue ſpirite, who wrote and indited his letters ſo excellently  well, that not any Hungar whoſoeuer, did ſurpaſſe him in that art, except it were Thomas Zalahazy Biſhop of Veſprimia. But yet he had been farre more commended, if he had as well imployed his wit to vertue, as he otherwaies ſpent his time in ſlourh, and other friuolous matters, in the which young men of good parentage, doe too often take pleaſure in, to their owne ruine, and ouerthrow of their Countrie. He then, as it were,

diuining of that which preſently happened; ſaid to the King, and not without great admiration of all the ſtanders by: that that day which was appointed  
               Spoken merily and earneſtly. to fight (ſith their reſolution was ſuch) ſhould be dedicated vnto 20000. Hungarian Martyrs (the number of the Armie being no more) ſlaine for the religion of Ieſus Chriſt, vnder the conduct of Paul Tomoree, and that they ſhould ſend the Chauncelor to Rome, to haue them canoniſed (as men ſay) if ſo be he then eſcaped the battaile, for that he was well knowne to the Pope, and Cardinals, by reaſon of an ambaſſage which he had been vſed in, to his Holines.
            
            I would to God that this Biſhop had been a falſe Prophet. There may Reaſon perſwading vnto fight. be ſome that would accuſe the Hungarians of ouer much temeritie, for that they ſo feruently deſired the Battaile, and they ſay this hardnes ought rather  to be named raſhnes and fooliſhnes, then by the name of vertue. And ſurely I ſee not, but that they haue reaſon to maintaine at this preſent, ſuch their ſayings. But yet they may be ignorant of many things which incited the Hungers thereunto, whereby they might eaſily haue drawne vnto ſuch a reſolution, yea euen the wiſeſt and greateſt Captaines among them: and amongſt other things this marueilous and incredible ardencie (as fatall to all ſouldiours) and the hope of victorie, which euery one in his own conceite, thought himſelfe certaine and ſure of. Beſides it was thought, that Tomoree, had ſome ſecret notice, and ſpeciall practiſes with many of the Turkiſh armie, namely with thoſe who were Chriſtians, or with ſuch as were borne of Chriſtian parents,  and alſo with thoſe who had the conduct and gouernment of the artillerie, part of whom were Almaignes, and part Italians. It was alſo further conſidered, that the retraict (the enemie being ſo nigh) could not be done, without putting themſelues in great daunger, ſpecially the Turke hauing ſuch nimble and ſwift horſe to charge vpon the backe of thoſe who ſhould be in the rerewarde, in which kinde of fight they are more ſtrong and fierce, then in an incountering charge. The battaile then being thus determined and appointed, order was giuen for all things neceſſarie thereunto. Firſt of all Tomoree went to his Campe, which, as we haue ſaid, was not farre from thence, and with much a doe perſwaded his men to retyre a little backe, and  that he would ioyne with the armie of the Kings. The day following, their Campe was ioyned with the bodie of the armie, halfe a mile beneath Mohacz, neuertheleſſe there was ſome little ſpace betweene the one and the other. At the ſame inſtant came from Buda the Veſſels fraughted with Cannon, powder, and other munition for the warre. With thoſe alſo were ſent downe nine peeces of Artillerie, which came from Vienna. A little after came alſo 200. ſouldiours of Alexis Turzon with certaine Cannons: himſelfe with the Biſhop of Veſprimia were remayning at Buda with the Queene. Theſe two were appoynted for the guarde and ſecuritie of her Maieſtie, and did ſerue her at the retraict and flight, which afterward ſhe was conſtrayned  to take, and continued a long time in her ſeruice. The Ban of Croatia arriued the Sonday before the Battaile with three gallant troupes. There was of them 3000. horſe, and not ſo many of foote. He was accompanied with Iohn Tahy, Iohn Banfy, and certaine other of the principall Lords of the kingdome of Slauonia. The day following, there came alſo in the morning to the

Campe (the King being there and ranged his men in Battaile, for that it was thought the ſame day the enemie would fight) Simon Erdeund Biſhop of  Zagrabia, with his brother Peter Erdeund, bringing with them in good order and well armed, more then 700. horſe. At the ſame time came thither Stephen Azel with 300. horſe, which Iohn Bornemiſſe had ſent to the ayde of the King, with many thouſands of crownes, which was the laſt preſent, made by the father to his nurſling. About the euening of the ſame day Iohn Zerechen came with 2000. foote, which he had gathered along the riuer Drauus, aſwell in his owne territories, as in the Chapter of the Church of the fiue Churches, they being reported to be very good archers. During theſe three daies, many other came to the Campe, eſpecially thoſe who were nigh, among whom  was Philip More Biſhop of the fiue Churches, and his brother Vladiſlas More. 
               The forces of Lewis and of Solyman. This Armie being thus aſſembled together to the number of 24. or 25000. men, not counting the companies which were on the water, who ſerued not at the day of Battaile, the enemie being with his puiſſant Armie of 300000. men, no further from them then two miles: three dayes were expyred before the Battaile was begun, during which time, daylie skirmiſhes, and fine ſtratagems interchangeably paſt betweene them, wherein ſtill the Turks receiued more damage then the Hungars. In the time of their aboade, it was alſo conſulted how and in what place they ſhould fight with the enemie, and in what ſort they ſhould ordaine and range the Battaile, and in what place thereof they ſhould appoint the King to be: where and how they ſhould  range the Caualarie and Infantrie, and where they ſhould plant the artillerie, whereof the Hungars had but 24. pieces, which were little to be compared to thoſe of the enemies. Before, they determined and aduiſed, for the ſafegard The meanes to preſerue the Kings perſon in the Battaile. of his Maieſtie, ſome were of opinion, that it was conuenient for him to be a good diſtance from the Battaile, with ſome thouſands of his beſt troupes, but ſeeing the Armie could not ſpare them, and for that the ſouldiours would haue him preſent therein, (following their auncient cuſtome) it was aduiſed that ſome one ſhould repreſent his perſon in his coate-armour: but preſently they thought that the ſame could not be done without being diſcouered, and without great tumult of the Armie; the which by this deede would be  greatly diſcouraged. But in the ende it was concluded, that ſeeing the fight did ſeeme doubtfull, ſome purpoſely appointed ſhould haue the charge to preſerue the King, if euill did betide, and that then they ſhould conduct him out of the throng, as ſoone as they ſaw the Battalions ſo broken that there could be noe more hope to reaſſure and encourage them, being ſo terrified. This charge was committed to Iaſper Raskay, to Valentine Toronke, and to Iohn Kalay, moſt excellent men, and doubtleſſe very faithfull to the King. There was alſo appointed certaine ſwift and light horſes, by meanes of which the King might eſcape, if neede required. 
            
            But now to come to the order of the battaile: there were many, and amongſt The order of the Bataile. others, Leonard Gnomsky was of opinion, that it ſhould be very needfull to inskonſe the armie with the wagons (whereof the Campe was ſufficiently furniſhed) like the fight at Barriers and vpon a Bulwarke, alleadging, that by that meanes they ſhould fruſtrate and annoy the enemie from their hemming them in, which was the onely and materiall thing they moſt feared.

               Radich Boſich did well allow of this deuiſe, as alſo Paul Bacchie, who was  ſaid to haue been in three ſeuerall battailes giuen by Soliman againſt his enemies. This counſell then was accepted of, and thought good by all; the execution whereof was committed to Gnomsky, and certaine other, but it was effected more ſlowly then was needfull, for it was but thought vpon the night before the battaile: and ſo this policie, among many other, was quite neglected. The 29. of Auguſt (which is dedicated to the beheadding of S. Iohn) being the day of battaile, the armie of the Hungars was ranged and lead by thoſe (which wee haue ſpoken of) in ſuch ſort, that they aduanced the front of their armie as farre as was poſſible, to the end, they might bee the leſſe incloſed by the enemie, and after they diuided it into two battalions. In the firſt, the Commanders thereof had no certaine place of aboade, but thought  it more needful to be vigilant ouer thoſe places, wherin their preſence might ſtrengthen and incourage their ſouldiours. On the right wing of it, was the Ban of Croatia, with Iohn Tahy; and the left wing was gouerned by Peter Peren, in the abſence of the Vayuode of Tranſiluania. In the firſt battalion there was many of the principalleſt of the armie, and among them there was Anthony Poloczy, Francis Hommonay, Gabriel Peren, Thomas Zechy, Andrew Battor, Emeric Cibak, and many others. The artillerie was planted next after the firſt rankes.
            The ſecond Battalion, which we commonly name the maine battaile, and in which was placed the King, was more furniſhed with horſemen then  footmen, who for the ſmall number they had, were placed in the flankes of the horſemen. Betweene this Battalion and the other (which we will name the Vauntgard) there was no more diſtance then one might throw a ſtone. In the battaile before the rankes (wherein the King was) there was three other rankes, who all of them, for the moſt part, were gentlemen of the Kings chamber, and many Barons of the countrie, who were vnder the charge of Nicholas Tharczay, a man of good courage, and very faithfull to his Prince. There were alſo the two Controlers of the Kings houſe, Peter Korlatkey, and Andrew Trepka, Polanders. Stephen Slijk, a Bohemian, was with the Bohemians and Morauians hard by the Kings perſon, and before him. After the  three rankes followed that of the Kings, in the midſt of which was his Maieſtie.
            
               Of ſpirit, beautie, and vertue all one
               With that which is celestiall,
               Bearing a minde to his countries boone,
               But Destinies made deniall.
            
            Vpon the right hand of the King was the Archbiſhop of Strigonium, and the Biſhop of Zagrabia; and the Biſhop of Agria was ſent from Batha to Buda. Next vnto him of Zagrabia, were the Biſhops of Varadine, the fiue Churches, and of Sirmia. Thoſe of Iauarin and Vacchia, were vpon the left  hand. Behinde the Chauncellor were placed the Biſhops of Nitria, and Boſnia, and the Prouoſt of Albe; after whom were the Secretaries, and the Groomes of the chamber. On the left ſide of the King, and neere vnto his perſon, there was a place voyde for the Counte Palatine, who although he had the gowte, and not without great paine could ſit vpon his horſe, yet notwithſtanding

he did valiantly his dutie, ſometimes being in the Vauntgard, and by and by in the battaile. Whileſt the Palatine continued not in his  place, there were certaine Barons kept themſelues about the King, and thoſe two Biſhops which we haue before named; behind the King were Czetricz, Malliart, and Horuuath, Maſter of his horſe. All theſe Lords had behind them the beſt and moſt reſolute men they could chuſe for their gard and defence. In the midſt of this battaile was ſeene the Enſigne royall, which was borne by Iohn Dragfy, Marſhall of the Kings houſe, which among the Seculars is the third dignitie next to the King. This battaile was enuironed with light horſe, and certaine footmen vpon the flankes. Vpon the right wing, after the Biſhops &amp; Secretaries, were ranged theſe three rankes, in which (as we haue ſet downe) was placed the Kings perſon. The place wherein this armie was  thus ſeated and ranged in battaile, was diſtant from Mohacz one mile, and The place of the battaile. from Danubius halfe a mile, hauing neere vnto it a long and large plaine, which was not any thing annoyed with wood, buſhes, hils, or water; but only vpon the left hand towards Danubius, there was a muddie mariſh, and ouergrowne with ruſhes, within the which afterward many men loſt their liues. Before the armie, a farre off, was a little hill, which was of great length, and in forme of a Theater, behinde the which Soliman was incamped. At the foote of this hill there was a little village with a Church, it was named Feulduuar, and in that village was planted the artillerie of the enemie, with many ſouldiours, ſpecially of Ianiſaries, who on this ſide the houſes of the  village, tooke vp a large place of ground, by reaſon of their long and thicke troupes: among thoſe was Soliman, as after was knowne. This artillerie being thus planted, was as in a valley, and for that cauſe was leſſe offenſiue to the Hungars, then if it had been vpon the plaine, in ſo much that the feare thereof was more offenſiue, then the hurt. The armie being thus ranged in good order, in the morning preſently after the Sunne was vp, the day being cleere and calme, Counte Palatine lead the King out of his place, and did Counte Palatine ſheweth the perſon of the King, to encourage the Hungars. ſhew him to all the ſouldiours, riding along the rankes of the armie, as he had done the ſame three daies before, to the end, to fruſtrate the diſtruſt which ſome had, that his Maieſtie was not preſent in the battaile, openly ſhewing  him to all with his hand, and publiſhing aloude, that the King was reſolute, and readie to endure all extremities, and euen death it ſelfe, for his countries weale, for the vnſpotted religion of Ieſus Chriſt, and for their wiues and children: declaring to them, on his part, that they muſt ſhew themſelues men, and bee mindfull that they were Hungars: and to be ſuch, who oftentimes, as hardie and valiant defenders of the Chriſtian publike weale, had heretofore brought away ſo many and ſo excellent Trophees, from ſuch and the like enemies, as theſe were, who they ſaw before their eyes: that they ſhould not be aſtoniſhed at the multitude of their enemies, for that the victorie  conſiſted not in the pluralitie, but in the dexteritie and courge of the ſouldiours: that God on high would aſſiſt them, they fighting for his holy religion; that the ſafetie, not onely of their owne countrie (which the Turks would vſurpe and tyrannize) but alſo of all Chriſtendome, was now in their vnconquerable hands.
            After that the King and Counte Palatine had thus reuiſited all the rankes

of his men of armes and footmen, and vſed to all of them the like orations, the King retired to his former place. A great part of the day was ſpent in attending  the enemie, who hauing onely ſent a ſmall troupe of his people to skirmiſh, he himſelfe kept behinde the hils, imagining (as it appeared) either 1 to draw the Hungars within the ſtraights of theſe hils; or faining to deferre 2 the fight vntill the next day; he might in the meane time aſſaile them, and in the night following (they being vnprouided) to ſet vpon them in their Campe, which he might eaſily doe, as well for the infinit number of his people, as alſo for the great ſtore of Cannon which he had: or elſe that he might 3 rather moleſt them by a protracting fight. They knew not which of theſe three deuiſes the enemie would execute, but all the day the Hungars were in  great doubt of the Turkes reſolution, vntill, towards euening, they perceiued the troupes of the enemie to approach by a valley, which was on the right hand vnder thoſe hils, being onely diſcouered by the tops of their launces.
            The Frier thinking that they which now came in ſight were of the Vauntgard, to force and breake his Campe, or to enuiron his people, commaunded Iaſper Raskay, with two others, who were appointed for the gard of the Kings perſon (as is ſaid before) to diſcouer what the enemie would attempt, and force them take ſome other way. Iaſper knowing what charge was committed to him, to haue a ſpeciall eye and care of the Kings perſon, moſt honeſtly refuſed (as much as he could) that commiſſion: but in the end perceiuing  the Frier did greatly preſſe him thereto, and that the King did not contradict his commaund, diſdaining leaſt the refuſing he made vpon ſo good and iuſt a cauſe, ſhould be imputed to him as fearfull and cowardly, ſuddenly he ſet ſpurres to his horſe, and with his two companions, being followed of all the companies of ſouldiours which he commaunded, aduanced themſelues, with this hope neuertheleſſe (wherof they held themſelues aſſured) that they ſhould be able to returne in time, before the King ſhould haue need of them. They being ſet forward, although they were vncertaine whether the enemie would giue battaile that day or no, for it was alreadie three houres paſt noone: beſides, there were certaine of the principall of the armie, who being  tired with ſo long an expectation of fight, were of opinion to ſound a retraict, and retire themſelues to the Campe. The Frier hearing this ſudden Paul doth importune the fight. motion, came with his companion towards the King, and did aduiſe him in any caſe not to delay the fight, alleadging, that there was leſſe daunger to fight now with part of the enemies armie, then to ſtay vntill the next day, at which time he was to fight againſt all their armie, and as for the reſt, he needed not to doubt of victorie. At this his ſpeeches, the King incontinently commanded to ſound the alarme, and preſently all the Trumpets, Clarions, and Drummes made a marueilous and terrifying noiſe, and al the ſouldiours (following their accuſtomed manner) inuocating the name of Ieſus, made a  confuſed noiſe of crying, and at the ſame inſtant one might perceiue the enemies to deſcend the hill, which was oppoſite againſt the Hungars, ſeeming by their rankes an infinite number, among whom was Soliman himſelfe. Then they gaue the King his head-peece, who vpon the receipt thereof, looked very pale, as a preſaging of euill fortune at hand. And then the ſignall to A ſigne of euill hap to the King.
               
fight was giuen to thoſe who were in front, who very couragiouſly charged The beginning of the battaile. the enemie, and all their artillerie was alſo made readie and diſcharged. But  this firſt incounter was not greatly offenſiue to the enemies: neuertheleſſe there was more ſlaine of them, then of the Hungars, in ſo much that they were forced to retire, being ſo hardly preſſed by the Chriſtians: whether it was by the force and courage of the Hungars, or the ſubtiltie of the enemie, endeuouring by that meanes to draw them on to the mouth of their Cannon, that I know not. Then preſently Andrew Battor haſted to the King, declaring to him that the Turkes had turned their backes, that the victorie was now in him, that he ſhould not doubt but ſet forward, and that it was needfull preſently to ſecond his men, who were in chaſe of the enemie that fled.  Whereupon the King aduaunced forward in hap hazard: but when they came to the place where the firſt charge was giuen, there might you haue ſeene many bodies of the Hungars diſperſed ouer all the field, ſome maimed, others halfe aliue, yet breathing. In the meane while, thoſe of the Vandgard purſuing the enemie, and valiantly fighting, the battaile of the Hungars approached to them with as much ſpeede as armed men could make, the left wing began to bend, and many quitted themſelues and fled, being feared (which I well beleeue) with the enemies Cannon, which then began to play among them. This did not a little aſtoniſh the battaile, whileſt thoſe who were in it, did heare the continuall and horrible whiſtling  of the bullets which paſſed through their rankes, and ouer their heads: and then the King was ſeene no more in the ranke where he was; whether it was The loſſe of the King. for that he paſſed beyond the firſt rankes, which were before him, (as wee haue noted, and as was before determined vpon, to the end that he ſhould not bee too much knowne, remaining in the ſame place) or whether that he was forced from the daunger by thoſe who were behinde him, for both the one and the other might well bee. Some ſaid, that hauing gone beyond the rankes which were neere him, he thruſt himſelfe into the front of the battaile, where hee valiantly fought with the enemie: but neither dare I affirme it, nor altogether denie it. For my part I know this for trueth, that  
               Theſe are the words of Broderic, Chauncellor of Hungarie, who was preſent at the battaile. he was not found in that place, neither in the ranke wherein he was at the beginning, after the Cannon of the enemie began to play, and when thoſe of the left wing of the Vandgard were ſeene to flye. At the ſame inſtant was miſſing the Archbiſhop of Strigonium, who was ſide by ſide by the King, and alſo certaine others who were by his Maieſtie. I will not impoſe this fault of the loſſe of our King vpon thoſe, to whom he was committed in cuſtodie, nor to thoſe (which may be) carried him by force, or ill hap out of the battile; but euen to the hard fortune of the Hungars, to the end that together with the loſſe of their King, they might not onely ſuffer that which they endured of a ſtranger, but alſo endure the infinite euill which they afterward  felt, by their factious and domeſticall diſſentions, for the election of a new King, in place of him whom they had loſt; their ſinnes, no doubt, being more worthie of a greater ſcourge and puniſhment. For wee know that both the one and the other, who had the charge to reſpect the Kings ſafetie, were moſt faithfull vnto his Maieſtie, and very deſirous to preſerue his life. And concerning thoſe three, who ought to haue had a watchfull eye vpon

him, it is moſt certaine they could not returne from the enemie, againſt whom they had been ſent, before our armie was put to flight: yea one of  them was taken and ſuddenly deliuered. That which cauſeth mee to diſcourſe more particularly of this action, is, through the vehemencie of griefe which I haue, by reaſon of a certaine man, who in a praier which he ſet forth, was not afeard falſely to call the Hungars, the forſakers of their King. But ſhould one eſteeme thoſe to haue forſaken and abandoned their King, who ſhewed vnto him all the duties that good and faithfull ſubiects owe vnto their Prince, and who alſo were well neere all ſlaine in that field, wherein his Maieſtie was found dead, &amp; who alſo by their death declared, how true and faithfull they were to their King, &amp; what great loue they beare to their countrie? But this goodly Oratour, who hath couched this in writing, and who  ſo greatly iniurieth this nation, doth beſides ſo largely write ſuch a diſcourſe of this ouerthrow, that I am aſhamed of him: ſo impudently dareth he diuulge to the worlds view, the hiſtorie of a thing which was altogether vnknowne to him. But to our purpoſe.
            The battaile of the Hungars being greatly troubled by this inconuenience, as wee haue ſaid, and ſhaken in ſuch manner, that it altogether tended to a flight; neuertheleſſe they fought a long time, not in that large plaine, but euen before the Cannons mouth of the enemie, which was but ten paces from them: ſo that the Hungars, as well for the feare which they had thereof, as for the ſmoake which darkened them, were forced, for the moſt  part, to deſcend into a valley adioyning to thoſe aforeſaid mariſhes, the reſt (notwithſtanding) continued ſtill fighting before the Cannon. In the end, thoſe who were retired into this valley, being returned againe to the fight, and ſeeing there was no meanes to ſupport the violence of the artillerie, and the ſmoake which ſtill thickened; one part of the armie being alreadie put The diſcomfiture of the Hungars. to flight, they alſo were forced to turne their backes. Euery man then, as his commoditie would ſerue, began to flye, drawing for the moſt part towards that place, wherein an houre before they had paſſed in great mirth and brauings, and full of hope to obtaine the victorie, trauerſing their Camp, which was now alreadie ſacked and raſed by the enemies, wherein there was nothing  remaining, but onely their footſteps and dead bodies.
            The Turkes ſeeing the flight of the Hungars, thinking it to bee but ſome ſtratagem, or elſe feeling themſelues wearie of the fight, continued a long time at a ſtay, in ſo much that they did not purſue them, in reſpect of the night, which had alreadie couered all the earth. This partly was the cauſe, and alſo the vehement raine that fell that night, for the ſafegard and preſeruation of many. The violence of the fight endured at the moſt but an houre and a halfe, and many were ſwallowed vp and ſmothered within that mariſh. The bodie of the King (who was ſaid to haue ended his daies in that The bodie of the King found dead. place) was afterward found in a great whirle, or rift of earth, aboue Mohacz,  halfe a mile on this ſide a little village which is called Czelie, the which medow was then ouerflowed, more then it was wont to be, with Danubius: in that place he was ſtifled with his horſe vnder the water, being armed as he was at the battaile. And ſeeing wee ſhall ſpeake no more of this King, I will adde to, in this hiſtorie, one thing of him worthie the noting: and that is,

when he was newly borne, he had no skinne that couered his bodie, which he neuertheleſſe recouered by the helpe of Phiſitions, who by their art ſuccoured  and helped the want and defect of nature. We haue heretofore noted a certaine preſage of the pittifull end which ſhould happen to him, but the ſame might well haue been told him before as a deſtenie of that which afterward happened to him, during the time he gaue order for his affaires to reſiſt the enemies, according to the firſt newes which he had receiued. For he being at Buda, when he was at dinner, the gates of his Caſtle being ſhut, A ſtrange aparation. (as the cuſtome was) a certaine Ghoſt in forme and ſhape of a man, euill fauoured, with crookedlegs, came haulting and knocked at the gate, and with a loude ſhrill voyce, deſired to ſpeake with the King, to acquainte him with  things which neerely concerned both the good of himſelfe and of the kingdome. His ſpeeches being not at the firſt heard by the guard, who were at the gate, (as it is the vſe in Princes courts) hee cried lowder, and with a horrible voyce demaunded againe whether they gaue the King notice thereof. In the end certaine of the companie being moued by the importunitie of this deformed Ghoſt: they demaunded of him what he would haue; but he replying, ſayd, that he would not reueale his ſecrets to any but to the King. This meſſage was preſently carried to his Maieſtie; who vnderſtanding thereof, ſent vnto him one of his ſeruants, in the beſt and richeſt apparell, and one who was next himſelfe, faining that he was the King,  commaunding him to enquire what this fellow would ſay. This meſſenger comming before this Ghoſt, and asking of him in priuate what ſecret he would impart vnto him: the other denying that he was King (whereby he thought to abuſe him) with a high and loude voyce, he ſayd, that ſince the King would not heare him, he ſhould ſhortly periſh. Theſe words being pronounced, he vaniſhed away, to the great aſtoniſhment of all that were preſent. It is a diſcourſe ſomewhat neere vnto that of Saule; but yet different, for that which the one required was not offered to him; but this of it ſelfe, was preſented without ſeeking for it, which one may enterpret diuers waies.
            But let vs returne againe to the ſubiect of our hiſtorie. In this place where  the Kings bodie was founde, many others alſo loſt their liues. A little beyond, was alſo found the bodies of Andrew Trepka, and Stephen Azel. It is ſaid that the Frier ended his life valliantly fighting in the Vauntgard; the day following his head being cut off, was carryed vpon the top of a launce round about the enemies Campe, in token of ioy, and ſome ſaid, that it was for a time placed before the Pauilion of Soliman. The day after the Battaile 1500. Hungers who were taken priſoners, among whom were the chiefeſt of the Nobilitie, being all commaunded to be ſet in a rounde forme, were preſently beheaded, their bloud, ſeruing in ſtead of a ſacrifice to the Gods of theſe Infidels. Very few priſoners had been ſaued, if it had not been to informe  and giue them notice of ſome ſpeciall matters which Soliman, and Abraham Baſcha were deſirous to knowe. Among thoſe was Nicholas ſurnamed Hertzek, which in the Hungariſh language ſignifieth Duke, as he was indeede, and the Kings Treaſorer. Iohn Pileczky, and Iohn Maczieouusky Polanders were alſo of that number. They were gentelmen of the Kings chamber, and being returned vnto the Queene, they diſcouered many matters, which

for the breuitie of this hiſtorie we will omit to write of. Michael Fekete, and  
               Bartholmew Martine were alſo ſaued from death, and within a while after were redeemed, paying a great ranſome. Among thoſe which dyed in the fight and flight, beſides the King, were theſe: Ladiſlas Salcane Archbiſhop Theſe ſlaine in the Battaile. of Strigonium; Paul Tomoree Biſhop of Colocenſe and Lieutenaunt generall of the Armie: Francis Peren Biſhop of Varadine: Philip More Biſhop of the fiue Churches: Blaiſe Paxy Biſhop of Iauerin: Francis Gzacholy Biſhop of Chenat: George of Pauline Biſhop of Boſnia: George of Zapolia Count of Sepuſa the other commaunder of the Armie: Iohn Dragfy Prouoſt of the Kings houſe: Francis Orzag chiefe gentelmen of the Kings chamber: Peter Corlathy, and Andrew Trepka Captaines of the watch at the gate: Simon Horuuath the  chiefe taſter: Thomas Zechy: Gabriel Peren: Ambrioſe Zarchan: Anthonie Poloczy: Mathias Czethingny, Counte of Francapin: Sigiſmonde Branſy: Francis Hampo: Iohn Bathian: Stephen Slÿk a Bohemian, with certaine other Bohemians and Morauians. And theſe were the principall Barons of Hungarie. Among the Nobles and other Lords of the Countrie, there are worthie of note Francis Balaſſe: Nicholas Tharza: Iohn Paxy: Iohn Iſtuuanfy: Emeric Warday: Michael Podnamisky: George Orlouuchicz Captaine of Segin: Stephen Azel Caſtelane of Poſon: Sigiſmonde Pogan: Iohn Torualy: Iohn and Stephen Kalnay: Nicholas Forgach, and beſides theſe about 500. other. As for the foote men, there eſcaped three or foure thouſand, and they were in all 12. or  13000. There was remayning of their Captaines no more then Hanibal Cypryan. All the peeces of Artillerie as well thoſe which were planted before the Battaile, as thoſe which were remayning within the Campe, and in the boates, were all taken by the enemie; the charge thereof was giuen too late, being but the night before the fight, to Iohn Hadek, a man of good courage, and well managed in ſuch affaires, &amp; who had alwaies frequented the Kings court, of whom he was ſo loued, that few had the like fauour of his Maieſtie. The night and day after this vnfortunate Battaile, the enemies running all ouer, made wonderfull waſte and ruine of all the neighbour countries, ſet fire on all, not ſparing any perſon, hauing no regarde to ſexe nor age, nor to  any religion, executing vpon the poore people all cruell and inhumaine acts. My wit cannot ſufficiently write and bewayle the calamitie of this whole night, and the dayes following, being ſo great and intollerable for all this part of Hungarie, which we haue named to be on this ſide the riuer: that I cannot be perſwaded, that euer any barberous enemie, hath elſewhere vſed the like crueltie. Amongſt ſuch miſeries, there happened one extreame and vnnaturallaccident, the like whereof was neuer heard before, and this it was; that the poore and wretched mothers buried aliue their ſucking Infants, for feare themſelues ſhould be diſcouered by their crying, and they poore babes dyed, whilſt their mothers being in no better ſaftie, diſperſed themſelues heare  and there, to auoyde the tyrannie of the Infidels. The enemie proceeded euen vnto the lake of Balator, and in paſſing by, they fired the citie of the fiue Churches, which was all burnt, onely the Caſtell and the faire Temple reſerued. Whileſt the execution of this vnfortunate Battaile (and of all thoſe which we haue recited) was in doing: the Vayuode was almoſt at Segedin with all the forces of Tranſiluania, who not being able with all his troupes to

march with that expedition as he would, and deſiring notwithſtanding to be at this battaile, which, as he vnderſtood, could not in any ſort be deferred,  he being in a ſwift and light Coach, and followed with few men in the like wagons, went in the greateſt haſte he could to ſeeke the King. Counte Chriſtopher was alſo arriued at Zagrabia. One part of the Bohemians which came to ſuccour the King, were about Iauerine, and the reſt were not farre from Alberegalis. George Marqueſe of Brandenburg, and the Chauncellor of Bohemia named Adam Newhuis, were about the ſame quarter.

Theſe moueables, and other goods which appertained to the citizens of Buda, were rifled, and ſome of them ſtaied by Andrew Orbancz, who commaunded the Caſtle of Strigonium, which at this day is called Gran. Neuertheleſſe, he that writeth this hiſtorie, and reciteth this vile and infamous outrage, doth greatly erre, when he added to it, that certaine of his light horſemen (who are commonly called Vſſarons) behaued themſelues towards the Queenes maides, otherwiſe then their honours required, for that in a meriment they put off their ſhooes to daunce with them. 
            
            The Emperour Soliman ſoiourning there a certaine time where the battaile was fought, and after hauing reunited together all his companies, the which he had ſent here and there to ruinate and ſpoyle the countrie, ſet forward towards Buda, and there within ſixe or ſeuen nights hee arriued himſelfe, marching along the ſhore of Danubius, fiering all the townes, boroughes, Buda taken by the Turkes. and villages by the which he paſſed. He found this towne forſaken of all the garriſon, and cauſed it to bee fired, not any thing being exempted from the violence therof, but the Caſtle, and the Kings ſtables, and the houſe of wilde beaſts.
            From thence the Turke ſent many horſemen to ſpoyle and rob the countrie on this ſide the riuer. They put all to fire and ſword whom they met betweene Waſte made through all Hungarie by the Turkes.

The Caſtle (notwithſtanding) of Strigonium was cowardly left by Andrew Orbancz, of whom wee haue ſpoken before, neuertheleſſe it was valiantly defended and Places forſaken by the Captaines, and preſerued by men of meane condition. preſerued by a man of baſe and ſeruile condition, and who a little before lead to the warre the footmen of the Chapter of the great Church of the towne called Mathieu Nagh, he being retired thither with a few men. The Fortreſſe of Viſſegrade, wherein the royall Crowne was alwaies kept, was alſo ſaued by the Peaſants, and Friers, it being forſaken of the ſouldiours: ſo greatly was euery man amazed at the Turkes comming vnto Buda. Theſe  ſtrong places which we haue noted, together with thoſe of Thata, Comora, and Alberegalis, were not forced of the enemie, for that he, I know not by what counſell, did content himſelfe onely to ſpoyle the countrie, and little reſpected to aſſaile the Caſtles and ſtrong holds.
            As theſe Barbarians did exerciſe their enormious cruelties in euery corner, ſo there was no place in Hungarie where they had more reſiſtance, then

at Maroth by Strigonium. This was a fine place of retyre, and pleaſantly

Into the ſaid place certaine thouſands of Hungars retired themſelues, with their wiues and children, truſting vpon the ſtraight and narrow paſſages which were ſtrongly ſhut vp. With thoſe the enemie often came to handy ſtrokes, and alwaies they receiued the worſt, and were put to the foile. In the end, the Turks ſeeing by no meanes they could force the barracado, which the Hungars had made with their wagons, they were conſtrained to bring thither their artillerie, by meanes wherof al thoſe wagons &amp; other ſuch defences were broken &amp; ouerthwrone to the ground, and almoſt all the people  put to the ſword. The great heapes of bones, which is to be ſeene at this day, in that place, doth ſufficiently witnes the greatnes of the maſſacre, the which, as thoſe few reporte that eſcaped, was 25000. perſons one and other. And he who would account the whole number of thoſe which had bin ſlaine, violently put to death, retained priſoners, or yt remained in captiuitie, I dare well affirme (according to that which I haue vnderſtood) they were wel neere 200000.

                  AFter that the Hungarians were thus ouerthrowne, Solyman inueſteth Iohn Zapoly (who was Vayuode of Tranſiluania) in the kingdome of Hungarie, and then he returned to Conſtantinople: whereupon Ferdinand of Auſtria pretending title to that kingdome, and ſeeing he could not obtaine it by peace, entreth thereinto with a great armie, and Iohn forſaketh Buda, and retireth into Tranſiluania, is purſued by Ferdinandoes forces, and ouerthrowne, who then flyeth into Polonia, and Ferdinand is crowned King of Hungarie. Iohn ſeeketh aide of Solyman,  
                  who vndertaketh his defence: whereupon Ferdinand ſendeth to Solyman for peace, but he denounceth warre againſt him, and entreth into Hungarie with a puiſſant armie, who taketh Buda and Altenburg, and beſiegeth Vienna, from whence he is repulſed and diſcouraged by the gallant exploytes and reſolution of the aſsieged, and in the end retireth from thence. Many hoſtilities paſſe betweene Ferdinand and Iohn, and after an agreement made betweene them, Iohn dyeth, and left a ſonne named Stephen, to whom was gouernour Izabella his mother, and one Frier George. After Iohns death, Ferdinand ſent to the Queene for the yeelding vp of the kingdome of Hungarie, which now he pretended title vnto, but is denied by George, who, to withſtand him, demaundeth aide of the Turke. Ferdinand ſendeth 
                   
                  forces into Hungarie, beſiegeth Buda, and is there ouerthrowne by Solymans armie, who taketh Peſthe. Muſtafa warreth in Tranſiluania againſt Malliat, Ferdinandoes Lieutenant there. Malliat is betrayed, taken, and ſent with other priſoners to Conſtantinople, who there dyed, and the Tranſiluanians ſweare homage to young Stephen, whom Solyman greatly deſireth to ſee, who is ſent, accompanied with many of the Nobilitie, and are all detained priſoners but onely Stephen, whom he returneth againe to his mother at Buda, which treacherouſly is taken by the Turkes, and Queene Izabella diſpoſſeſſed thereof, and ſent into Tranſiluania to gouerne there. Ferdinand againe ſendeth to Solyman to demaund peace, and to be inueſted King of Hungarie by him, who returneth him a moſt ſcornefull anſwer. 
                   
                  The Queene being receiued into Tranſiluania, George manageth all things, and little eſteemeth the Queene.
               
            
            AFter that the Hungarians had receiued this cruell ouerthrow at Mohacz, wherein were ſlaine about 30000. men, with many of the chiefeſt Lords and gentlemen of the countrie; and after that Lewis their laſt King

was thus ſtifled in this Quagmire or Mariſh of the aforeſaid place, Solyman 
                not fearing any who could oppoſe themſelues againſt his forces, being now with his victorious armie arriued in the towne of Buda, (which with the Fortreſſe, without any reſiſtance, was preſently reduced vnder his ſubiection) that he might the better obſerue the ancient cuſtome of the Ottomans, 
               The cuſtome of the Turkiſh Emperours. (which is, that the Prince ought rather to repoſe himſelfe in his armie, then to be incloſed within a wall) would not therefore reſt himſelfe therein one night, but preſently retired himſelfe into his Pauilions in the middeſt of his Campe, which was hard adioyning to the towne; whither being come, there was preſented to him ſeuen Biſhops heads, and the heads of other Hungars, being of the number of thoſe who were left dead in the field,  where the Battaile was fought; among which, was that of Ladiſlas Salcane Archbiſhop of Strigonium, who for his extreame couetouſnes was greatly The cenſure of Solyman concerning the Hungariſh Lords, who were ſlaine in the battaile. blamed of Solyman, in reſpect he would neither aide the King, nor himſelfe, with his treaſure, which was found about him to be very great. There was alſo much fault imputed to George Sepuſa, brother to Iohn Vayuode of Tranſiluania, for his riches: and alſo to Paul Tomoree, Biſhop of Colocenſe, for his riches, who further was condemned for his imprudencie and raſhnes, hauing ſo fooliſhly, and without reaſon, counſelled Lewis to fight with ſo little an armie, againſt one who was eight times as great and mightie. But on the other ſide, Peter Peren Biſhop of Varadin, was greatly commended and eſteemed, for that contradicting the opinion of Tomoree, he aduiſed in any  caſe not to giue battaile, but to temporiſe and ſtrengthen his holds, and to put his people therein for ſafetie, and to fortifie the towne of Buda with a ſtrong and ſufficient garriſon: becauſe in thus doing he might the better reſiſt his enemie.
            And after that Solyman had ſeene &amp; viewed all thoſe, &amp; had giuen his ſouldiours leaue to ſpoyle and maſſacre (who failed not preſently to cut, mangle, and cruelly teare them in peeces) they preſented vnto him the pictures of Lewis and Marie his wife, vpon which caſting his eyes, and conſidering their The compaſſion of Solyman vpon the fortune of Lewis and Mary. young yeeres, he lamented their ſiniſter fortune, greatly blaming all their Councellors, who raſhly aduiſed them to fall into ſuch extreame miſerie:  affirming with an oth, that he was not come to expell him out of his kingdome, but onely to reuenge his men of the iniuries which the Hungars had done them, greatly complaining for the death of Lewis, the which had taken from him all meanes wherby in effect he might ſhew the truth of his words, the which were, that he would haue placed him againe in his fathers kingdome, vnder certaine good conditions of an honeſt and reaſonable tribute. But he now ſeeing this Realme to bee vnprouided of a King, and that there was not any of the blood, to whom it ought of right to be giuen; it ſeemed that he was willingly enclined to inueſt Iohn the Vayuode therein: alwaies prouided that he were found to be of the blood of Lewis, or at the leaſt, to be  diſſended of his race, by ſome collaterall line one or other.
            Whileſt he retayned his Campe about Buda, he ſent into diuers quarters the greateſt part of his Armie, to pill and waſt the champian Countrie and neighboring places, leading with them an infinit number of priſoners, and an ineſtimable bootie, giuing to all the Prouinces thereabouts an incredible

amazement, there being by ſo cruell and ſuddaine a ſurpriſe, taken and put to death more then 250000. ſoules. After which he minding to retire into  Thrace, he cauſed to be taken away from the Caſtle of Buda, thoſe three faire Brazen Statues caried from Buda to Conſtantinople. brazen Statues of Apollo, Diana, and Hercules, which with marueilous art and iudgement were made by King Mathias Coruin, for an ornament of that place. And beſides thoſe, he cauſed to be caried away certaine brazen Colombes, with ſome great peeces of Artillerie, (which in times paſt were belonging to the King of Boſnia) and cauſed them in token of victorie to be Solyman his returning to Conſtantinople. tranſported to Conſtantinople, and he willed they ſhould be erected in the market place, to the ende they ſhould publikely be ſeene and admired; and not long after, himſelfe arriued in the ſame Citie in great triumph. 
            
            In this time Iohn Sepuſa the Vayuode, conducting the Souldiours of Iohn Zapoly Counte of Sepuſa, Vayuod of Tranſiluania, aſpyred to the crowne of Hungarie. Tranſiluania to the ayde of the King, and being arriued too late, euen at the time they were defeated, and brought into the extremitie of miſerie: ſeeing now there was none left of the bloud royall, who might ſucceed in the Kingdome, began then in himſelfe to aſpire to that high degree: and this did he ſo much the rather, for that he found himſelfe amongſt theſe people in great eſteeme, and conceiued no ſmall hope of it, by reaſon of the victorie which he a little before had againſt the Peaſants, who did riſe againſt the gentlemen; (in reſpect whereof the principall of the land bore him ſome fauour) thus taking heart and courage to him (vſing notwithſtanding wiſe  and prouident counſell) he hoped in the ende thereby to obtaine that kingdome, and be crowned King: further endeauouring himſelfe by all meanes to win the good liking of the Nobilitie (as he did) and to draw them to his intention, perſwading them they ſhould neuer tollerate, that ſuch degree and dignitie, (which aunciently had been maintayned by the Hungars) ſhould now come vnder the gouernment of a ſtranger, and that they ſhould not obey any other commaund, then that which ſhould be appointed by their owne proper nation. With ſuch good perſwaſions, and friendly admonitions, he gayned the hearts almoſt of all: and ſo aptly did he manage all things, that at the next aſſemblie, they all in his fauour determined to negotiate  and treat of this affaire: and the abſence of Stephen Battor fell out fitly for his purpoſe, who was gone towards Ferdinand, and vnto whom (becauſe Stephen Battor the chiefeſt among the Princes of Hungarie. both in reſpect of his Nobilitie, and of his bloud, being one of the principall) the adminiſtration and gouernment of the kingdome appertained rather, then vnto Iohn. There being then aſſembled at the Dyet, held at Alberegalis, all the great Lords of Hungarie: whither was brought the dead bodie of the vnfortunat Lewis, which a little before was drawne out of the Mariſh at Mugach, to be there enterred with royall pompe, and intombed in the Sepulcher of his aunceſtors; and where (after ſuch magnificall and ſumptuous The funerall of Lewis. funeralls were ſelebrated, accuſtomably done for ſo great a King, there was incontinently publiſhed the foreſayd Dyet, and the Councell of the Souldiours  (which in their language is commonly named Rhakos) was called thither by the authoritie and diſpoſition whereof the King ought to be choſen. In this aſſemblie Iohn the Vayuode not finding any Competitour, with Iohn Zapoly Vayuode, choſen King of Hungarie. the generall conſent and good liking of euery one, was choſen King, and crowned with the auncient crowne of golde, (which then was in the couſtodie

of Peter Peren) by Paul Archbiſhop of Strigonium, and by Stephen Broderic 
                Biſhop of Vacchy, who afterward was choſen Chauncellor of Hungarie; and by theſe two he was annoynted.
            After that the feaſts and triumphs (accuſtomed to be done at ſuch Coronations) were conſummated, King Iohn made Iohn Emeric Cibacchy Biſhop of Emeric Cibacchy Biſhop Varadin, and Vayuode of Tranſiluania. Varadin, and Vayuode of Tranſiluania, diſpoſing afterward among gentlemen of other degree (according to their qualities) martiall preferments, and in like ſort with great diſcretion and indifferencie, in generall towards the people, and eſpecially towards thoſe who were at his Coronation, and who were the principall cauſe and meanes for him to aſpire vnto that puiſſant dignitie of ſuch a kingdome. Of the number of thoſe were Stephen 
                
               Verbetz, Nicholas Gleſſe, Gregorie Peſchen, Paul Artand, and all the Colonels, Captaines of ſouldiours and men of warre, who were come out of Tranſiluania, and many other. Whileſt he was intentiue to confirme and ſtrengthen his forces in this his new inueſtiture of the kingdome, by all good and vigilant meanes, Ferdinand, who not long ſince as heire of Ladiſlas (who by the deceit of George Pogghy Bracchy, aſpiring to ſuch a Seigniorie, was vpon The pretences of Ferdinand of Auſtria to the Crowne of Hungarie. the day of his mariage poyſoned) ſetting before him his reaſons (notwithſtanding the ancient ſtrife which had been betweene Mathias Coruin and the Emperour Frederick his great grandfather) was choſen King of Bohemia, and perceiuing himſelfe to waxe great, and more puiſſant and mightie,  by the forces which he was able to leauie from that kingdome, began now to thinke vpon the conqueſt of Hungarie, which appertained to him by the right of Prince Albert of Auſtria, and of Anne his wife, ſiſter to the late King Lewis, wanting not thereto the ayde of many great Hungarian perſonages, who being alreadie pricked with new alterations, and extreame greedines of nouelties, and beſides, for the ſecret enuie they bore to King Iohn, were retired to Ferdinand, inſtantly inciting him to make warre vpon Iohn, aſſuring him alſo that he was created King more tumultuarily, then legitimately, by the common people, being deceiued therein by his craft and ſubtiltie, there being (beſides Battor) many other within the  Realme, more noblie borne then he, vnto whom in right it alſo appertained to be King, as well as to Iohn: and namely, thoſe were Balthaſar Pamphille, Iaſpar Sered, Paul Bacchit, Ference Guena, Valentine Turky, Stephen Maillat, and Iohn Salle, beſides many other whom they named not. At the vehement perſwaſion Ferdinand entereth Hungarie with a great armie. of thoſe, Ferdinand (who of himſelfe was willingly inclined therevnto) gathering together a great armie, as well foote, as men of armes of Bohemia, Auſtria, Germanie, and other places, drew himſelfe directly towards Buda. Vpon his arriuall, Iohn finding himſelfe enuironed with extreame lacke of all neceſſaries, was greatly troubled, wanting ſufficient forces to reſiſt the mightines of his enemie: and ſeeing all things in a feeble and weake  eſtate for his ſuccour and aide, by reaſon of the lightnes of that nation, who naturally are inclined to ſuſpition; and hauing no leiſure nor time, for want of money, to leauie any ſouldiours, determined with himſelfe not to attend his enemie at Buda, but to tranſport himſelfe with all his people to Peſthe, Iohn forſaketh Buda, and retireth himſelfe into Tranſiluania. and there (as the ſhortnes of the time ſerued) exhorted and deſired his Captaines, not to forſake him during theſe turbulent broyles, in the midſt whereof

they ſaw himſelfe deeply plunged: and thus in great haſte they flying, paſſed the riuer of Thyſſa, anciently called Tibiſcus, and lodged in a Caſtle  named Thoccay, ſituate almoſt vpon the riuers ſide, in a large and ſpacious plaine. The newes of this retraict being poſted to Ferdinand, incontinently he cauſed his armie to enter and poſſeſſe the towne of Buda, who without the loſſe of any one man, was maſter thereof. He ſtayed not there long, but the Councell aſſembled together, to know whether they ſhould follow King Iohn, or no. Among the diuerſitie of opinions, it was thought beſt that at all aduentures they ſhould purſue him, before he migth bee able to encreaſe his forces, and to admit him no time to repoſe himſelfe in any one place, nor to expect for any ayde out of any place, and to performe that euen now, while he was disfurniſhed of men and counſell, and in a manner put to  flight. According to which reſolution, Ferdinand gaue leaue to his people to follow King Iohn, as farre as they thought it conuenient: whereupon they preſently ſet forward on their iourney, and with great trauaile, without any delay, arriued at the riuer of Thyſſa, which they paſſed with boates that they brought with them vpon wagons, and they in camped by King Iohn, before he was aware, who, for the little or no inckling he had of them, neuer dreamt of ſo ſudden a thing. Being aſtoniſhed at ſo preſent an arriuall, he began now to conferre with his people, what courſe was beſt to be taken. They anſwered, that they would fight, and that he ſhould withdraw himſelfe from the danger thereof, that if it ſhould fall out ill, he might haue ſufficient time to  ſaue himſelfe: and on the contrarie, if it ſhould alter and fall out well, hee might with his preſence, ayde and ſuccour them the better; and ſo by that meanes he ſhould in euery caſe finde himſelfe ſafe and in good ſecuritie. At that time among all his Commanders, he had one whoſe name was Ference Bode, a man of great reputation and well eſteemed, to whom (for his vertue, Ference Bode a valiant Captaine. fidelitie, and experience) King Iohn had committed his Standard royall, and the Lieutenantſhip Generall ouer his armie. He foreſeeing the miſerable ſucceſſe which might happen of this warre, did deliberate and reſolue with himſelfe to dye, rather then to flye or forſake his King by a cowardly and diſhoneſt flight. And among many opinions and aduiſes which were propounded  before the King (and the ſame it may be more neceſſary, then profitable) this Captaine turning himſelfe towards the King, ſaid: Moſt excellent Prince, the vertue and force which may come by counſell, is not then neceſſarie, when the effect thereof muſt goe before mens opinions. For this cauſe (ſince our enemies are ſo readie to fight) it is in like ſort conuenient, and that for two cauſes, that we alſo prepare our ſelues to the combat. The one 1 is, that wee ought to preſerue your Maieſtie ſafe and ſound: and the other, 2 that wee may maintaine our honour and reputation; for it would bee imputed as a baſe and ſeruile thing, for vs Hungars (who are borne and alwaies  accuſtomed to manage armes) now to flye, or refuſe the battaile which the enemie offereth vs. And for this reſpect it behoueth vs both with bodie and courage to fight with our inuincible forces, and eſpecially now, ſince the commoditie of further aduiſe is taken from vs, (the which would greatly haue beſteaded vs in this affayre) conſidering that either a memorable victorie muſt happen to vs, or elſe a glorious death to all: 
               and ſo much the rather

alſo, as the neceſſitie of this war doth take away all benefit and commoditie of the time, by the ſuddaine arriuall of our enemies: and yet more then  that, conſidering that there is nothing leſſe thought of, thē the intereſt which the one and the other pretendeth to the gouernment and rule of this kingdome, which cannot acknowledge two Lords, and indeed demaundeth but one. For theſe cauſes, although the enemies far exceed vs in number, it is neceſſarie that euery one fight for the glorie and renowne of his Countrie, and for the good and quiet repoſe of the publike weale, to the ende that it may not bee thought that we would flie the burthen and daunger of a Battaile, and alſo we ought this day, for the benefit and commoditie of euery one, rather to hope for a memorable victorie by the point of the ſworde, then to ſaue our ſelues by a cowardly flight: and if fortune be fauourable to vs,  we ſhall gaine a perpetuall peace; or elſe in dying, obtaine an honorable end, conſidering the cuſtome of fortune is ſuch, that among thoſe who fight couragiouſly for the preſeruation and defence of their Countrie, ſhe doth rather fauour them, whoſe number is but ſmall, then thoſe who are followed by thouſands of ſouldiours.
            
            Theſe ſpeeches being ended, preſently he began to forme and order his Battaile, committing the right &amp; left wings to the Tranſiluanian ſouldiours, The appointment of the Battaile. and to ye Caualary of the ſame Countrie, as repoſing greater affiance in them, then in the other, and he impaled himſelfe in the midſt of the Hungariſh and other ſouldiours, newly gathered together. Oppoſite to theſe Battalions: the  Captaines of Ferdinand ordained their ſquadrons in forme of two wings, giuing the right to the ſouldiours of Auſtria, and to the horſemen of Bohemia, and the left wing to the ſouldiours of Stiria, &amp; to the horſemen of Carinthia, and Valentine was placed in the midſt of all with the royall Standard, enuironed and followed of all the Hungars, and Paul Bacchie (a man expert in feates of war, being wel acquainted with Turkiſh deceites) with a good cōpanie of Vſarons (who are like our light horſemen) withdrew himſelfe into a ſecret ambuſh, where he might (as he did) ſuddainely aſſayle the hinder part of the Armie of King Iohn, and according to the accidents of fortune, annoy him. At this inſtant the ſouldiours, aſwell on the one part as on the other (without  being requeſted thereunto by their Captaines) were inflamed to fight, and began now couragiouſly to march one againſt the other, and after the Artillerie had interchaungeably played, not being greatly offenſiue to either part, they incountred in ſuch rude and fierce maner, that the Stirians could not ſuſtaine the violence of the Tranſiluanians, but begā to turne their backes, and their Caualarie to diſperſe here &amp; there. But on the otherſide, the Carinthian men of armes bore the ſhocke &amp; force of Ference Bode his ſquadrons (who were but freſh-water ſouldiours lately leauied) and paſſed through them, and brake their arraies. In the meane while the Hungars aſwell on the one part as on the other, valiantly fought with equal art and induſtry, force and courage,  (none being able to iudge on which ſide the victory would fal) and that with ſuch obſtinacie, that there was ſinall or no difference at al betwixt them, in reſpect of their valour &amp; courage. Neuertheleſſe, al the Hungariſh Battalion of King Iohns, was broken and ouerthrowne by the Bohemian armed men, who came in to the skirmiſh. At this alteration offortune, Bode inforced himſelfe

to reunite certaine companies which were diſperſed, and againe to make head againſt the enemie, and to purſue the battaile: in executing of which,  he was ſuddenly ſurpriſed and enuironed by the light horſemen of Paul Bacchie, who, vntill then, held himſelfe in couert, and there Bode was the ſecond The ouerthrow of King Iohns armie. time broken, and himſelfe taken priſoner, and all his armie defeated and cut in peeces, and the royall Enſigne of Iohns taken, with all the Artillerie and baggage. King Iohn ſeeing fortune incline to Ferdinand, and to bee oppoſite to him, and all his armie ouerthrowne; and that there was now no more hope left vnto him of any good, tooke his flight towards the confines of Sarmatia, Iohn flyeth into Polonia. (which wee at this day call Polonia) and the Conquerors ranging all ouer the countrie, reduced Tranſiluania, with the reſt of Hungarie, vnder  the obedience of Ferdinand, to whom was ſent Ference Bode, with all the Enſignes wonne in the battaile, and many other perſons of note, whereof he receiued great content: and cauſing the fidelitie of Ference Bode to bee ſounded, to ſee if he would forſake Iohns part, and ſweare alleageance to him. But not being able to draw from him in any ſort that he had a meaning to breake his oth and promiſe, which he had giuen vnto Iohn, he was in the end, by his commaund, ſent priſoner to a Caſtle, where, in great penurie, and not without a pitifull example of fortune (and to the great ignominie of him, by whom he was impriſoned) he ended there his life, hauing been a man of ſingular vertue and wiſedome, who well might haue been compared to any The death of Ference Bode one of the ancient or worthie Captaines; and one might iuſtly iudge, that  ſuch calamitie was farre vnfitting ſuch an excellent and worthie man.
            
               Ferdinand obtaining this victorie, and publiſhing at the ſame time a Diet of the Hungars, to be held at Alberegalis, was in like ſort, after the ſame manner, as Iohn was, with Anne his wife, crowned King of Hungarie, and that Ferdinand crowned King of Hungarie. by the hands of the ſame Archbiſhop of Strigonium, and of Peter Peren, who had forſaken King Iohn, who being brought into poore and meane eſtate, was retired into Polonia, he being entertained by Hieromic Lasky, a Hieromic Lasky receiueth Iohn. mightie man both in poſſeſſions, and alſo well followed in thoſe countries, who exceedingly reioyced at the arriuall of ſo great a perſonage, and receiued  him very curteouſly, and did greatly comfort him for the paines and miſerie, whereinto hee was ſo deeply fallen, and entertained him in ſuch friendly ſort, that it well appeared he wanted nothing elſe, but onely the dignitie and ſtate of a King, &amp; did ſo much honor him as was poſſible. But Lasky being of a haughtie ſpirit, and a man who with deepe iudgement had often managed affayres of great import, as well in the warres, as in the peaceable gouernment of a kingdome, and other publike Eſtates: perſwaded Iohn that he ſaw no other meanes more behoofull to redreſſe and reduce this preſent extremitie of his affayres into better order, nor none more proper nor conuenient for the recouerie of his kingdome, then that which might befall him by the ayde and helpe of Solyman the Turkiſh Emperour. And therefore  inſtantly aduiſed him, not to forſake the meanes and oportunitie, but to vſe it in his neceſſitie: for that he aſſured him, in reſpect of the extreame ambition, glorie, and couetouſnes, to increaſe the limits of his Empire, and in hope to make himſelfe a greater Monarke, he would by no meanes faile or omit to giue him ayde and ſuccour: ſo as himſelfe would offer and vow to

hold his kingdome of him by faith and homage, as depending vpon the Ottoman houſe, and to pay him ſome reaſonable tribute, ſuch as Solyman himſelfe  would impoſe vpon him. Which being concluded and determined I asky practiſeth at Conſtantinople to obtaine ſome ſuccour for Iohn his gueſt. betweene them, Lasky deſiring greatly to fauour and ayde the cauſe of his friend, and receiuing of Iohn the ſumme and charge of an Ambaſſage, he ſet forward to goe towards Conſtantinople with a good traine, where at the length being arriued, he preſently endeuoured himſelfe, by gifts, to win the fauour and grace of all the Baſhaes, and of the Captaines of the grand Seigniours Port, and of all other principall perſons of his Court, who with his preſents he in ſuch ſort gained, that they ſerued him as a ladder to mount to the top of his deſires, who being at laſt admitted to the Turkes preſence, and after humble reuerence to him made, was by him (according to the cuſtome)  ſent againe to the Baſhaes, among whom, Luflefy and Abraham had the moſt authoritie, commaund, and credit, the one being alied to the grand Seigniour, becauſe hee had maried his ſiſter, and the other being a Viſir, Viſit. which is the chiefe of all officers, and one that keepeth the Turkes ſeale, and ſigneth all expeditions, or diſpatches, Lasky gained, and that beyond all expectation, theſe mens amitie, by meanes of their wiues, whom he had poſſeſt and corrupted with rich and coſtly preſents, with whom alſo hee diſcourſed ſo familiarly in the Slauonian and Turkiſh languages, as if hee had been naturally bred and brought vp among them. His fayre and good ſpeeches cauſed him to be gratious and amiable to all, and by ſuch pleaſing courſes,  he began with all his endeuour to treate of the affayres of King Iohn, ſpecially tending to this purpoſe, that hee might bee reſtored againe to his kingdome, being vniuſtly chaſed out of it by the forces of Ferdinand, and by the enuie and wickednes of certaine Hungars, being before by them iuridically choſen, and crowned King; for the recouering of which, he did offer (beſides a reaſonable tribute) to acknowledge and hold it of the grand Seigniour, and to be called the ſubiect of the Ottoman houſe; and in token of true fidelitie and alleageance, and for the perpetuall memorie of ſuch a benefit, he would yeeld himſelfe to bee his ſubiect. Lasky further declaring, that it was better for Solyman to haue King Iohn, with a weake force, for his neighbour  and friend, then Ferdinand, who becauſe he was brother to the Emperour Charles, and King of Bohemia, and Archduke of Auſtria, and Lord of many other countries, would make ſhew rather to be feared and redoubted by his neighbours: and he further declared, that if he would not liſten therevnto, it might poſſible be, that one day he would vex and diſturbe him more, then he now preſently thought of. And beſides that, he ſhould doe in this, as beſeemed a magnanimious and vertuous Emperour, in ayding thoſe, who by others are wrongfully oppreſſed and iniured, and to fauour the iuſt cauſe of him, who for euer ſhould remaine his bounden and loyall ſubiect. Theſe reaſons being heard by the Baſhaes, and reported to Solyman (who by a ſecret  window had alreadie vnderſtood all that paſſed). did ſo ſet him on fire with the glorie which hee hoped for by ſuch an expedition, that incontinent he Solyman vndertaketh the defence of Iohn. reſolued to vndertake it; with ſuch conditions notwithſtanding, that King Iohn ſhould obſerue from point to point, all that which he had cauſed to be promiſed him.
            
               
In the meane time, Ferdinand not without cauſe miſtruſting (the which indeede happened) that Iohn might ſeeke ayde of the Turke againſt  him, did deliberate (thinking to preuent the deſeignes of his enemie) to ſend to the grand Seigneor, to demaund of him truce, and to confirme the amitie Ferdinand ſendeth to Solyman. and friendſhip that Ladiſlas and Lewis, Kings of Hungarie, had in former time ſworne with the houſe of Ottoman, and the which truce the King of Polonia then enioyed, not doubting but he would willingly condiſcend to his demaund, if he would ſufficiently apprehend his reaſons. For this cauſe he ſent his Embaſſador Iohn Oberdanſch to Solyman, to practiſe and negotiate this confederacie. He being diſpatched, with good expedition arriued at Conſtantinople, and was honorably entertayned as was fitting for an Ambaſſadour.  But publiſhing the occaſion of his comming, he well perceiued the rigour of Solyman, and the little credit he had amongſt his people, and hee manifeſtly knew that King Iohn had alreadie preuented his purpoſe. And receiuing his aunſwere, that the grand Seigniour would not by any meanes accept into friendſhip, them who in former time had been ſuch and ſo great enemies to his houſe, and by whom his people had receiued infinite outrages; and eſpecially conſidering his Maſter had ſo vniuſtly vſurped that kingdome, which he poſſeſſed not, but onely by force expulſing the true King; the iuſt titles and allegations of whom, being before from him concealed by the late victorie which his Maſter obtayned againſt him,  and being afterwardes better acquainted with the cauſe, by the information of credible people, he was forced by pittie and Iuſtice of his ſworde, to reinueſte the ſayd Iohn in his true and lawfull poſſeſſion. For theſe cauſes Solyman 
               Solyman denounceth war againſt Ferdinand ſpeaking to his Ambaſſadour. abſolutely denyed Ferdinand all his demaundes, as vnworthie of his frendſhip, and inſtead of peace, he denounced open war, commaunding preſently his Ambaſſadour from Conſtantinople; who with all expedition departed, and within a ſhort time came to Vienna, imparting to the Kings Counſell what was the iſſue of his Ambaſſage. The councellours giuing no credit to his words, but iudging his reporte to bee falſe, ſent vnto Ferdinand, who then was at the diet at Spire, and when he heard it, he was greatly  aſtoniſhed thereat.
            The Spring time approaching, Solyman cauſed to be proclaimed, that al his The Armie of Solymans in Hungarie. forces of Europe and of Aſia ſhould reſort to Andrionoplis, where he would make a generall muſter, and preſently after with great diligence to march to Belgarde (which is in Hungarie) with all his forces where he ſo iourned not long, but incontinently King Iohn with a great companie of the Hungarian Nobilitie, which he brought with him, came to kiſſe his hands, and to Iohn kiſſeth the hands of Solyman. acknowledge himſelfe to him, as his ſubiect and tributarie. He found him ſitting vnder a Canapie where hee made no great countenance to moue himſelfe at the reuerences which he made, but ſhowing a great Maieſtie,  he gaue him his right hand in ſigne of amitie, the which he kiſſed, and after ſome courteſies, Solyman ſaid to him; that he doubted not but with eaſe to reconquer all that which vniuſtly had been taken from him, and that by the iuſtice of his forces, which being done, he would liberally render it to him againe. King Iohn departing from Solyman, went to viſit Abraham Baſha, whoſe friendſhip he had alreadie obtayned, (as is ſayd before) by meanes

of Lasky, who alſo was the onely cauſe to procure him ſuch fauour with  
               Solyman, and drew to him Lewis Gritty, who was the ſonne of Andrew Gritty, 
               Lewis Gritty a Venetian, with the fauour of Solyman, ayded Iohn. then Duke of Venice, and who eaſily and friendly ruled Abraham, and ſo familiarly alſo, that it ſeemed he could not liue without his companie. Alſo Lasky, as hauing intelligence of the Baſhaes affayres, and with the Lords of Solymans Court, had ſpecially practiſed the friendſhip of the ſaid Gritty, for by the induſtrie of him (by meanes of Abraham Baſha) he obtained of the grand Seigniour that which he deſired. And King Iohn had in this ſo good ſucceſſe, that he found in this armie the aforeſaid Abraham.
            
            After that Solyman had repoſed himſelfe with his armie certaine daies at Belgrade, he marched directly to Buda, which was forſaken by the citizens,  as ſoone as euer they heard of the report of his comming; and ſo it came Buda taken by the Turks. vnder the gouernment of the enemie, without any reſiſtance: only the Fortreſſe was kept by 700. Germanes, who very couragiouſly for a time did their endeuour to defend it. The Turkes ſeeing they could not ſo ſoone be maſters thereof as they thought, began to myne and ſap it, whereby they might make the defences and wals ſaultable, and hauing throughly performed it, the fire and the thicke ſmoake which darkened the element, aſcended euen to the noſes of the aſſieged, who greatly feared to be deſtroyed therein, and ſeeing their companions alreadie begin to flye in the ayre, cauſed them (maugre Nadasky their Captaine, who commaunded that place) to ſound a parley and treatie of a compoſition with the Turkes, conditionally,  that in deliuering that hold, they might in ſafetie depart with their baggage, and retire themſelues into ſome place of ſafetie. Which being accorded and concluded, they rendred vp the Caſtle and departed. In the meane time it being reported to Solyman, that this compoſition was onely made by the ſouldiours, without the agreement of Nadasky their Captaine, he preſently ſent after them, in the way towards Poſon (to which place they would make their retraict) his Ianiſaries to put them to the ſword, as vnworthie to liue, hauing alreadie ſuffered them too long to breathe.
            This towne and Fortreſſe being thus taken, the armie marched directly towards Vienna, all the Campe reſting in the way before Alteburg, which  was a towne defended by the Bohemians, who at the firſt manfully withſtood certaine aſſaults; but ſeeing that in one of thoſe aſſaults their Captaine had loſt his life, they began then to loſe their courage, and waxe faint, and feeling themſelues wearie, for that they were continually at the fight, and finding themſelues more ſtraightned then before, and aſſailed with greater furie, they forſooke the Rampiers and gaue place to the enemie, who with Alteburg taken by the Turks. ſuch a furie entred the towne, that they put all to the ſword. This towne being wonne, the grand Seigniour was aduertiſed, that he ſhould not now find any hinderance neither in townes nor field: whereupon he ſent before the Accanges to the quarters of Vienna (which are, as in former times, like the Accanges. 
                aduenturers of France, and not much vnlike our Scottiſh borderers) to fire and ſpoyle all the countrie. Theſe people ſerue not for wages, but in time of warre are leauied among the peaſants (as the Ayduches in Hungarie are): they are not paid any wages, neither are they taxed, but of the bootie which they get, they giue the tenth part thereof to the grand Seigniour, as they do

of all their goods beſides. They now following the commaund which was preſcribed them, executed incredible cruelties, bearing away with them all  kinde of bootie. After that, they made towards the fiue Churches, where they committed no leſſe outrage to the inhabitants of the countrie, then they did to the other, who fearing ſuch and the like deuaſtations, and enormious cruelties, forſooke their houſes, ſeeking by diuers meanes to ſaue themſelues. In this ſort the Accanges continuing their pilling, robbing, and maſſacring, at laſt arriued before Vienna, by the riuer of Lints, where they were no more mercifull, then in other places.
            
               Ferdinand along time foreſeeing theſe euents, had put into Vienna all that little ayde which then he had, cauſing new Rampiers and fortifications to be built, and fearing worſe would afterward enſue, he trauailed to al the townes  of Germanie, not as a King, but as a Poſt or meſſenger to demaund ſpeedie ayde. At the requeſt of whom, and vpon the bruite which was diſperſed of the taking of Buda, all the Germanes with one accord ſent the Counte Palatine Counte Palatine of Rhene entereth into Vienna. with 20000. Launſquenets, and 2000. horſe, to the end himſelfe, with many other Captaines of marke, might enter into Vienna, to take poſſeſſion and defend it, and hinder the Turkes further proceedings, as it was an eaſie matter for him to doe. Among other voluntaries, there went William Roccandolph, Comptroler of King Ferdinands houſe, Iohn Gazianer a Slauonian, Hector Ranſach, Nicholas Salm, who was at the taking of the King of France at Pauia, Leonard Velſch, and Nicholas Turian, and many other renowned  through Germanie for their vertue and proweſſe: they put into the citie 100. peeces of great Artillerie, and about 200. leſſer, all which were in good order planted about the towne.
            In the meane while, the enemie not being able to march ſo faſt as was requiſite for them, in reſpect of the great ſtore of raine that fell in the moneth of September, and eſpecially by reaſon of the paſſage of Danubius, which was then ouerflowed; in the end they arriued before Vienna, vpon the 13. day of the ſame moneth, who with al their army enuironed it, diuiding their The Turke before Vienna. Campe into foure quarters, the circuite of which was ſo great, that one could not ſee nothing but the ground couered with Tents and Pauilions  for foure miles compaſſe. Abraham Baſha was incamped vnder a hill right ouer againſt the citie, that he might the more commodiouſly obſerue 1 and take view therof, himſelfe being lodged in a little ruinated Caſtle which was thereby, where alſo was lodged all his people, as well foote as horſe. On the otherſide, towards the Port of Purgatorie, right ouer againſt S. Vlderios Church, was the Beglerby of Natolia, with the choiſeſt ſouldiours of the armie. 2 The third ſiege was towards Saint Vit, vnder the conduct of Micalogly, within the village of Smireng, aboue the which, vpon the deſcent of the hils, 3 was lodged a ſtrong ſquadron of ſouldiours. The fourth was towards the Scottiſh Port, where were many Aſapes, (who are Archers very expert) and  
               4 amongſt them were alſo ſome Ianiſaries, along the riuers ſide of Danubius. Thoſe of this ſide ſuffered not any within the towne to appeare vpon the wals, but ſtraight they were brought to the ground, and ſometime they ſent ſuch an hayle of arrowes into the citie, that thoſe who walked in the ſtreetes, were grieuouſly annoyed &amp; wounded, except they had on ſome head-piece

for their heads, or armour for their bodies. The laſt ſquadron, which was the moſt warlike, and valianteſt of all the armie, and wherein was Solyman 
               5 
                himſelfe, was lodged right ouer againſt S. Markes Church, within a great cloaſe, walled with bricke, where was fixed the Turkes chiefe Standard. On that ſide, the Aſapes began to remoue the earth, that ſo they might ouerthrow the wals into the ditch, by meanes of their mynes and other inuentions: but hauing no Artillerie to batter, their trauell and labour did not greatly profit them.
            During theſe approaches, as another part of Solymans armie came in boates rowing vp Danubius, Wolfang Oder (who was then Gouernour of Poſon) being Wolfang Oder defeated the Turkiſh veſſels vpon Danubius. aduertiſed thereof, cauſed a good cōpany of Launſquenets, with certaine peeces of Artillerie, and ſome few horſemen, to lie in Ambuſcado vnder the  banke of Danubius, in a place ſecret and commodious for that purpoſe, where ſuddenly he aſſailed the Turkiſh armie, who were vnprouided, and ſo throughly did he effect it, that he ſunke many veſſels fraught with Artillerie and Munition, ſtaining the water with the blood of a great number of ſouldiours and Turkiſh Captaines, who were there ſlaine, cauſing alſo ſuch diſorder and confuſion in that army, that euen through the feare of their Artillerie they were ouerthrowne and broken: which victorie was a ſpeciall cauſe of ſauing Vienna. In this ſurpriſe and canuiſado, the enemie loſt the gallanteſt and moſt eſteemed men among them, and Wolfang in this victorie not loſing any one of his owne people, retired himſelfe with his companie  ſafe and ſound to Poſon. The remnant of thoſe that eſcaped, proceeded on their iourney to Vienna, and at their arriuall, they brake all the bridges of the Iles, which was made ouer Danubius before the towne, to go &amp; come more commodiouſly in and out of the citie: which being done, they placed themſelues before the Caſtle, to the end none by this place ſhould neither go nor come without great daunger, either to be killed, or taken priſoners: euen as it happened to the companie of Iohn Ardech, who ſallying out on that ſide to skirmiſh with the Turkes, had ſuch ill ſucceſſe, that it little wanted that they were not wholly ouerthrowne by the thick ſhot of the Accanges &amp; Ianiſaries; he who bore the Cornet was taken, and after ſent backe (not without  ſome ſuttle deuiſe) clothed in a gowne of gold &amp; ſilke, after the Turkiſh habit, with an intent, that by ſuch outward ſhewes &amp; diſſembling fauours, he might the better perſwade the Viennians to yeeld themſelues. But the conſtancie The conſtancie of the citizens of Vienna. and courage of euery one was ſuch, that they had all rather dye, then heare of any ſuch diſloyall matter: hauing this firme hope, not onely to warrant the towne, but alſo to effect incredible damage (as they after did) to Solyman. The citizens ſeeing that the greateſt violence of the enemies (being depriued of Artillerie) did conſiſt in mynes, began to looke well to that, and with diuers inſtruments to diſcouer the places where they were made, and to this end they vſed baſons full of water, dice vpon a Drumme,  and many other inuentions, by which they might know where the enemie myned, and by that meanes they might preſently remedie any inconuenience The meanes to diſcouer a myne. which might happen, by making countermynes, which would fruſtrate the other, and make the enemies labour friuolous and to no effect; and fortifying behinde the wals with counter wals of rootes and trees, in ſuch

forcible manner, that the aſſaylants ſhould receiue more loſſe and damage then the aſſayled; and with ſuch dexteritie they rampired behinde, that they  thereby preuented the determination of the enemie, as it afterward happened. For they ſetting fire to the mynes, and a great part of the wall falling, they thought by that ruine, without any great daunger or loſſe to giue the aſſault. And vpon this imagination, they ran preſently with great fiercenes and courage to aſſaile the breach. But the Viennians being well fortified and retrenched within, contrarie to the opinion and expectation of the enemies, they receiued thereby an incredible loſſe, tumbling them downe from the top to the ground, and inforced them with a great ſlaughter and ſhame to recoyle backe, and acknowledge the valour and courage which was in the hearts of the aſſieged. Euen almoſt at the ſame time, towards Saint Clares 
                Church, did alſo fall a great canton of the wall, ſo large and wide, that the enemie did eaſily ſee the Germanes well ranged in Battaile to maintaine the aſſault, which incontinent was giuen by the Turkes, with a merueilous deſire to make themſelues maſters of the towne, contemning all the ſiniſter accidents which were preſented to them, forcing themſelues by all violent meanes to enter, and to incounter thoſe ſouldiours whom they ſaw ſo well martialled. But their courage was quickly abated, for they were valiantly repulſed by thoſe who defended that breach, giuing them iuſt cauſe to buie their bolde attempt at a deare rate. And although this multitude of aſſaylants were as it were almoſt without armour, yet were they ſo audacious  and bolde, that ſcornfully diſdayning our people, and fooliſhly fighting, they did in the ende force them ſometimes to retyre, although that they were ſlaine ſo thicke, that bodie couered bodie, and in place of thoſe who fell to the ground and were ſlaine, others ran to poſſeſſe their roomes with incredible furie, and with ſuch dexteritie, that their rankes neuer ſeemed naked nor emptie.
            In this manner both the one part and the other, with great effuſion of blood did often fight, and amongſt others at the Port of Carinthia, where was alſo fallen downe a great part of the Courtian; at the fall whereof, the enemies preſently gaue the aſſault, onely with ſword and target, hauing forſaken  the harquebuz and bow, they running to it in ſuch a multitude, as if they had been graſhoppers, and began an aſſault mort cruell and bloodie then the former, where on both parts they fought with ſuch hatred and deſire of victorie, that both the one and the other encountring ſo rudely together, weare often repelled, this being one of the bloudieſt aſſaults that euer was heard of; but in the ende, the force and courage of the Germanes increaſed, the Turks being conſtrayned to yeeld, notwithſtanding the admonitions, prayers, exhortations, and threatnings of the Sangiacs, and other Captaines, who with blowes of their Semitaries, forced them to returne againe  to the aſſault, not being able otherwiſe to ſtay them from turning their backes. Thus while the ayre reſounded, and the earth ſhaked, by reaſon of the wonderfull thunder the Artillerie made, and by the noyſe, and ſound of bels and drums, the enemie with greater obſtinacie then before, returned to the aſſault, which was long and couragiouſly maintayned, more then foure houers continually, not without great ſlaughter on both

ſides. During which aſſault, there was ſlaine (with Ambuſt Ottinge a valiant Colonell) many Captaines and men of ſpeciall marke: and of thoſe without,  many Captaines of the Ianiſaries, and of the Aſapes, and many Sangiacs, who for their vertue and renoune were greatly eſteemed among their Nation. Theſe being prouoked with furie and courage, put themſelues on foote with their ſword and target only, to animate and encourage others the more to the fight. In the ende the Turks not being able any longer to reſiſt the proweſſe and valour of the aſſiedged, abandoning all ſhame of diſhonor, and diſpiſing all iniurious vpbrayding, not reſpecting the blowes which they receiued of their Captaines, they tumbled downe through and from the ruines and breach of the wall, flying directly to their lodgings. Solyman throughly vexed to ſee ſuch a bucherie of his people, vrged by a kinde of  deepe reuenge, did purpoſe to put in execution his laſt endeauored violence, wholy to deſtroy the towne. And to that effect he cauſed all the Captaines and principals of his Armie to come before him, who ſeuerely and with ſharpe ſpeeches reprehending them in great choler, that they ſo villanouſly and infamouſly, and by a more then womaniſh cowardlynes, hauing almoſt the victorie in their hands, ſuffered now themſelues to be depriued thereof, and put to flight, commaunding them within a ſhort time, to make themſelues readie and renew the aſſault with greater courage; euery one either reſoluing to die there, or elſe to regaine the victorie euen as it behooued them more then any other nation. At this cruell commaund, which was pronounced  to the extreame feare of all, euery man furniſhed himſelfe with armes, and with all neceſſarie things for fight, and the prefixed time being come to begin this horrible aſſault, which was the 13. of October, Anno 1529. the The generall and laſt aſſault giuen to Vienna. Anno 1529. Turkes with all their force and laſt endeauour in diuers places, and eſpecially by the Port of Carinthia, began again to aſſaile the towne with ſo great a multitude and furie of the ſouldiours, that it ſeemed the world would preſently haue ended, thinking by their ſhouting and fearefull cries, to enter the towne, and darkening the day by the great cloudes of arrowes, with which they filled the ayre. But the Germanes who held themſelues gallantly aloft, were aduaunced before the inſolencie and boldnes of the enemie, oppoſing  their thicke ſquadrons againſt their force and multitude, and by ſuch valarous meanes, fruſtrated their violence, making with their Cannon and handy ſtrokes a great butcherie of them; which would cauſe great maruaile and amazement in thoſe, who could beholde the infinite number of them that were ſlaine and wounded: notwithſtanding, the Turkes abated nothing of their courage, but to the contrarie, abandoning all feare of death, more hardie, raſh, and more inflamed with pride then before, redoubled the aſſault, and ſo fiercely they perſiſted in their obſtinacie, that many times our men were conſtrained to yeeld a little backe. But at laſt, by the vollies of the harquebuziers, and the violence of the Artillerie (which by  good diſcreſion was diſpoſed about the walles, eſpecially where they ſaw the greateſt force of the Turkes fighting) the enemies were forced to retire, miſerably falling in heapes by the ruines of the breach, making themſelues a pittifull ſpectacle; the ditch being filled with the dead bodies of theſe Infidels, and the ſtones ſtained with their bloud. Thus hauing loſt all their courage

and hope of winning the towne, and no more dreading the threates and menaces, nor the blowes of their commanders, of two extreames, they choſe  rather to be killed of their Captaines, then by thoſe of the towne, whereupon tumultuouſly they retired themſelues in great confuſion from that terrible aſſault, flying in great hurly burly to their lodgings. By this confuſed retraict, behold how this bloodie fight that day tooke an end, which did very deere and infinitly coſt the Turkes, by the death of his braueſt and valianteſt Captaines. Wherefore Solyman ſeeing fortune contrarie to him, and conſidering the vallour of the aſſiedged; not willing to attempt any more ſo cruell a loſſe, determined to packe vp and depart. And before his departure, he cauſed certaine priſoners to be apparaled in robes of Veluct and  cloth of golde, who liberally were ſent home againe into the towne, whereby they might informe the Citizens, that his intent was not to take Vienna, but onely to be reuenged of the iniuries which he had receiued of Ferdinand, and ſpecially, becauſe hee meant to poſſeſſe thoſe kingdomes which were not his; and further, that he was ſo much the more diſpleaſed that his enemie was retired into the midſt of Germanie, and had not attended him in Hungarie, that there he might be reuenged the better of the iniuries offered to Kind Iohn his friend: and that if they would yeeld to him, hee aſſured them, that he would not enter into their towne, but leaue them in full libertie, promiſing to the ſouldiours who were within, that they ſhould retire themſelues to any ſecure place where they would, and that afterward  he would incontinently returne againe. Theſe ſpeeches being by the priſoners recited, in the aſſemblie of all the people and ſouldiours, gaue notice to them that the forces of the Turkes were greatly weakned, and by that they iudged the loſſe which he had receiued, and that he vſed this deceite, but onely to win them to his lure, and ſo nothing but laughing at it, they made account of his words as they deſerued, knowing well by reaſon of the winter which was at hand, that the ſiege could not long continue. And ſo within two dayes after, which was the thirtieth day of the ſiege, the Turke rayſed his Campe from before Vienna, deuiding it into  
               Solyman departeth from Vienna. three partes, (and hee tooke the way towards Conſtantinople) one part whereof marched by Strigonium, the other by Gran, and the third by Boſnia. And in order, with ſuch an innumerable quantitie of ſpoyle and priſoners, Solyman retired himſelfe from Vienna, and Abraham Baſha remained in the rerewarde, to defend that none ſhould charge or aſſaile the ſquadron of the grand Seigniour marching along Danubius; vpon the which alſo ſoftly floted another part of the Armie, to giue reliefe of victualls, munition, and of men, to thoſe who were on land if neede ſhould require it.
            At the departure of ſo great and puiſſant an enemie, all Germanie and Hungarie greatly reioyced. But when newes was brought how the Turkes lead captiue more then 60000. priſoners, that all the villages and houſes in  the champion were burnt and ouerthrowne, their ioy was preſently turned into ſadnes, beholding with great compaſſion all the fields to bee disfurniſhed of men, 
                  •
               eaſts, trees, and houſes, not any remayning to till the ground, which miſerable ſpectacle gaue occaſion to euery one to lament and ſigh bitterly.
            
               
The great Turke being arriued at Buda, and willing to performe his promiſe  
               Iohn confirmed King of Hungarie by Solymon. which he had made, confirmed Iohn King of Hungarie, with priuiledges written in letters of gold, and inueſted him in his kingdome, calling him his friend and vaſſall of his houſe, leauing with him Lewis Gritty to aduiſe and ayde him in all neceſſarie things, and to be an aſſiſtant to him in his kingdome. Gritty remaineth with Iohn. And after proceeding on his way with tedious iourneys, by reaſon of the vehemencie of the winter (which with ſnow and froſts was alreadie at hand) at length he arriued at Conſtantinople, where with great reioycings and triumphs, he was as well receiued of his ſubiects, as if he had conquered all Auſtria.
            Now after that Lewis Gritty had ſoiourned a certaine time with King Iohn, 
                in the adminiſtration and gouernment of the kingdome of Hungary, he was called home by Solyman. He attained to this honour by the meanes of Abraham Baſha, 
               The ſauour of Solyman to Gritty. (a ſpeciall friend of the Duke his father) through whoſe friendſhip he was ſo conuerſant with the grand Seigniour, that one day he inuited him to a feaſt at his houſe, vnto whom the ſaid Seigniour vouchſafed him the fauour to go, the rather in reſpect of the haughtie ſpirit, and deepe iudgement in all things, which he knew was naturally grafted in him: in regard of which, he had oftentimes ſent him to execute great enterpriſes, as this was one, wherein he vſed ſuch marueilous wiſedome and great expedition, and carried himſelfe ſo indifferent to all, that his greatnes was not enuied of any  one. Now the cauſe of his calling to Conſtantinople, was only to diſcourſe Gritty called to Conſtantinople, and after ſent into Hungarie againe. with him of many matters, which were of no ſmall importance, which when they had aduiſed vpon, he was preſently diſpatched againe into Hungarie to his charge, with ample commiſſion and great authoritie; being, among other things, commanded to remaine at Buda, and with his vttermoſt abilitie to maintaine in thoſe quarters, the glorie and renowne of the Ottoman houſe; charging him to bee continually preſent at all the Councels, which ſhould bee held, as well for warre as for peace; the grand Seigniour furthermore not minding that they ſhould alter any thing in that kingdome, whileſt he was abſent in making warre againſt the Perſians. Moreouer, he was commanded to enquire if the report which was bruited, were true: namely,  that Iohn (at the inſtance and requeſt of the Hungars) would accord with Ferdinand, and haue peace with the Germanes and Bohemians, who continually made incurſions into his countrie, vpon theſe conditions, that as long as he liued, he ſhould peaceably enioy all Hungarie; and that after his death he ſhould leaue the poſſeſſion, and all ſuch right as he could any way pretend therein, to the children of Ferdinand, as we ſhall hereafter more at large treate of.
            At the time when Solyman went into Armenia, Gritty arriued in Valachia, hauing for his conuoy certaine Turkiſh horſemen, and companies of Ianiſaries, and thoſe of the grand Seigniours guard ſufficiently tried, with ſome  of his owne familiar acquaintance, and other Italian companies, who of their owne accord, being well armed, followed him, and he had alſo with him two famous Hungarian Captaines, namely, Vrbain Batian, and Iohn Doce with their companies, they in all making about 7000. men, as well horſe as foote. He was beſides, in outward ſhew for warre, well furniſhed with Camels,

Mules, Horſes, cattell, and other munition for the ſeruice and reliefe of his Campe. And with this traine (which rather ſeemed an armie) he cauſed  great ſuſpition as well among his friends as his enemies: and before he departed from Valachia, he made peace with Peter, Vayuode of Moldauia, Peter, Vayuode of Moldauia, friend to Solyman and Gritty. (who before was made Solymans friend) he hauing ſent vnto him many rich preſents, to requeſt his fauourable aſſiſtance for his going into Hungarie, and to ayde him with men and victuals, and with all other neceſſaries which he ſtood in neede of, vntill he had accorded the ſtrife of Ferdinand, for the loue of whom he vndertooke this voyage. This league being confirmed by oth of either ſide, Gritty thinking himſelfe to be ſufficiently ſtrong in thoſe parts, to manage ſuch affayres at his pleaſure, entered preſently into Tranſiluania,  
               Gritty entereth into Tranſiluania. cauſing open proclamation euery where to bee made through all the prouinces of Hungary, belonging to the Emperour Solyman, that all the townes, Comminalties, and Lords of that kingdome, ſhould haue recourſe to him, as an Arbitrator and Lieutenant for all the prouinces of Hungarie, for the grand Seigniour, and as the ſole Iudge of all their debates, ſtrifes, proceſſe, and diſcords. But this did not greatly pleaſe King Iohn, and it was afterward the cauſe of Grittys fall.
            At this time liued Emeric Cibacchy Biſhop of Varadin, and Vayuode of Emeric Vayuoyde of Tranſiluania and Gritty were enemies. Tranſiluania, a man who for his noblenes, puiſſance, and vertue, was very famous among his people, being (in regard of his calling) the ſecond perſon  next the King. Againſt him, Iohn Doce bore ſpeciall hatred and open malice, for receiuing a blow of him with his fiſt vpon the noſe, about a certaine queſtion and controuerſie moued betweene them. He vpon the bruite of the comming of Gritty to Breſouia, made no ſuch haſte (it may bee) as Gritty expected he ſhould haue done, in reſpect of the honour he looked for: but making ſlow ſpeede, it thereby ſeemed that he little regarded thoſe whom the grand Seigniour had ſent, which made him odious and diſpleaſing to Gritty, who ſought nothing more, then to increaſe the authoritie which he had, and to make it appeare how greatly, aboue others, the Tranſiluanians had honoured and reuerenced him. Vpon this, a common opinion went,  that Emeric vſed this manner as beſeemed a good Chriſtian, being greatly diſpleaſed in his heart to ſee the Turkes in his countrie, where they neuer came before, and that he ſhould conſent to open to them a paſſage, whereby they might haue more ample knowledge of the ſtore of townes, boroughs, and villages; of the infinite number of horſes, of the fertilenes of the land, and the fat paſtures which are therein, by the which they might bee inticed in time to make themſelues maſters thereof. But all ſuch opinions were in the end found falſe, for that without any ſuſpition he went as a friend to receiue and viſite him. When Gritty was alreadie arriued at Breſouia, and that from thence he meant to goe to Megeſt, where he was by many meſſengers informed, that Emeric would come to ſee him, and that he marched well accompanied,  being lodged but fiue miles from him with a great companie, and furniſhed with many troupes of Caualarie, all the chiefe of the prouince being come to him, to honour him the more in this voyage, as was fitting to their Vayuode and ſupreame Biſhop, and eſpecially vnderſtanding that this was to goe before Gritty. Theſe men, together with Emerics traine, ranged

in the middeſt of a field, ſeemed in a manner a good armie. This wonderfully  moued the tyrannicall ſpirit of Gritty, who ambitiouſly aſpired to haughtie attempts, and probably to the vſurpation of that Countrie, conſidering that the authoritie of that Biſhop might moleſt and fruſtrate the greateſt part of his deſeignes; and imagining that it was neceſſarie to parlie with him in the plaine field with an appointed battaile, as it were againſt his profeſſed enemies. For this cauſe, after Gritty had dined, not being able any longer to ſmother the vehemencie of his cholor &amp; arrogancie, he tooke his hat off his head, which was agglated and made of Martens Sables, after the Turkiſh manner, and with a ſwelling pride caſt it on the ground; ſaying, That that hat could not ſerue for two heads, ſince it was ſo neceſſarie that but one alone  ſhould haue the vſe thereof: and threatning all thoſe who would not obey to his commaund, he put it on his head againe. By theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches, Iohn Doce incenſed Gritty againſt Emeric. 
               Iohn Doce tooke occaſion to reuenge himſelfe vpon Emeric, and anſwered him thus: Truly Seigniour Gritty, a man cannot better applie this which you haue ſaid to any thing, then to this Realme, which by no meanes can tolerate two Lords, nor two gouernours. And I aſſure you by the liuing God, that you can neuer vſe your puiſſant and magnificall authoritie ſo maieſtically, as long as Emeric ſhall remaine aliue, againſt whom you ought this day to maintaine the authoritie and royaltie of Solyman, and your ſelfe. I now perceiue by this his inſolencie, which I haue long before knowne, what this cruell beaſt Emeric is, the boldnes and pride of whom (if you pleaſe) ſhall  ſoone bee abated, and I will make him lie full low, as he well deſerueth, for that he ſo peremptorily refuſeth obedience to Solyman, and that dareth to deſpiſe thy name, manifeſting thereby, that he rather aſpireth to make himſelfe an abſolute King, then to maintaine the dignitie of a Vayuode. Therefore it is neceſſarie by ſome deuiſe to make him away, whereby euery one may be freed from his inſolencie and pride. This counſaile was ſpecially praiſed by Gritty, who incouraged him to execute it. And the better, and in more ſafetie to attaine to the period of his enterpriſe, he cauſed to bee giuen vnto him, by Vrbain Batian, a good troupe of Hungariſh horſe. And although it is ſaid that
Gritty commaunded not Doce to kill Emeric, but onely  to take him priſoner, and that afterward he might ſend him chained to Conſtantinople to the grand Seigniour, minding to create in his place Hierome Lasky Vayuode (who then was with him, and by whom, as wee haue before recited, the affayres of King Iohn was greatly furthered) neuertheleſſe, the Lasky aſpyred to be Vayuode of Tranſiluania. common bruite was, that Gritty, by enuie and the falſe ſuggeſtion which was reported to him, gaue commaund to Doce to kill him, feining of his part an intent but to goe and viſite him. Thus Doce ſecretly in the night diſlodged, and came on a ſudden to the Campe of Emeric, being a little before aduertiſed by his ſpyes, that Emeric was without guard, or any feare, being  lodged in the fields vnder the ſhadow of trees, to auoyde the heat which then was, and that he was accuſtomed to lye alone in his Tent, onely with the groomes and pages of his chamber, and all the reſt of his people diſperſed in cōmodious places, as euery man found it moſt profitable to himſelfe, little diſtruſting any treacherie, thinking that they ſhould the next morning haue time enough (conſidering the diſtance of places) to aſſemble themſelues,

before they ſhould encounter with Gritty. This little miſtruſt of Emeric, increaſed the courage of Doce, and gaue him good hope to execute his  diuelliſh enterpriſe. Whileſt that Biſhop Emeric dreamed not on ſuch vnhappie and miſerable fortune, which by the wickednes of another, vntimely happened to him, he was layd vpon his bed to take his reſt, when ſuddenly Doce and his ſouldiours were within his Tents, who, before himſelfe, orany of his houſehold were awaked, or before any noyſe or neighing of horſes were heard, ſeized preſently on his bodie, without hauing any reuerence Emeric Vayuode of Tranſiluania ſlaine by Doce. to the qualitie and condition of his calling, and forgetting all Chriſtian pietie, he cut off his head, afterward giuing leaue to thoſe Turkes, who had accompanied him in this murther, to ſacke and pill all the moueables and baggage of this poore Biſhop, and to leade away his horſes. All the reſt of  this goodly companie, being greatly aſtoniſhed at this deteſtable accident, betooke themſelues to flight. This being done, Doce retired himſelfe to Breſouia, carying the head of Emeric hanging by one of the eares, and preſented it to Gritty, who laughing, did behold it with Hierome Lasky, who Lasky moued at the death of Emeric. was then with him. This man ſtirred vp with ſo vilanous and infamous an act, conceiued in him a great indignitie, at the miſerable fortune happened vnto ſo venerable a man. But diſſembling ye griefe, which touched him at the hart, and which of a friend made him an enemy, made ſemblance as though he little cared therefore. Gritty turning himſelfe to him, ſaid: Seigniour Lasky, doe you know this ſhauen head? beleeue me it was the head of a great  perſonage, but yet beſides ambitious and proud. At theſe ſpeeches, Lasky oppreſſed both with anger and griefe at one time, anſwered, that it was then at no hand like to that which he had ſeene when it was aliue ſtanding on his ſhoulders. Theſe words neerely touched Gritty, who preſently replied, as one repenting himſelfe of that deede, and that he could not containe himſelfe from ſhame, in reſpect he was ſo vniuſtly put to death, and that he gaue no ſuch commaund that he ſhould be ſlaine, but onely taken priſoner. After he cauſed certaine Hungariſh and Turkiſh horſemen to ſeaze vpon a Caſtle, which was reported to bee the place where his treaſure was. By this time the iſſue of this pitifull and lamentable death, was diuulged into the  eares of euery one, in reſpect whereof, all the nations of that prouince, as Saxons, Sicilians, Tranſalpinians, and Podolians (who are vpon the confines The Tranſiluanians in armes for the death of Emeric. of Polonia) with all poſſible diſcontent felt themſelues greatly outraged with griefe, and aſſembled together againſt Gritty, to reuenge the death of ſo honourable and reuerend a man, and within few daies they were about 40000. men, they hauing for their Commaunders Gottart a Saxon, and Stephen 
               Gottart. 
               Maillat, who alwaies bore great affection and honour to Emeric, and in Stephen Maillat. their publike Diet condemned this foule act and deteſtable crueltie, iudging Gritty worthie of any kinde of infamouſe death, and his adherents as murtherers and theeues, ought to bee purſued and punniſhed with death. Gritty 
                vnderſtanding this tumult of the Tranſiluanians, and the great aſſemblie of ſouldiours, and preparations which were determined of againſt him, was greatly troubled therewith, and withall being vncertaine what to doe in his defence, with great expedition retired himſelfe to the towne of Megeſt. The inhabitants whereof diſcouering a farre off the Turkes following Gritty retired himſelfe to Megeſt.
               
him, and that his companie might amount vnto ſome 4000. men, they ſhut the gates againſt him: but in the end, by the intreaties and perſwaſions of  
               Doce and Batian, they condiſcended to lodge them below in the towne, reſeruing to thēſelues the aduantage of a hill, where they had a large Church, walled about, and well furniſhed of houſes, into the which they all retired with their richeſt moueables, fortifying themſelues within as well as they could. And as afterward they vnderſtood when Gritty tooke the way to this towne, he had an intention to ſeize vpon that hill, and to fortifie it, as wel as the ſhortnes of the time would permit him, there to defend and keepe himſelf, vntill ſome little aide ſhould come to relieue him, by meanes whereof he might for a time ſaue himſelfe, either by a little brooke which ran not farre from thence; or by the riuer of Alute, which doth paſſe vpon the left  hand, and from thence doth caſt it ſelfe vpon one ſide into Moldauia; or of another into Valachia, which countries he might eaſily winne, without any feare of the Turkes power. Whileſt his braine was buſied vpon ſuch vrgent neceſſities, he ceaſſed not from fortifying himſelfe very ſtrongly, and incouraged thoſe who were with him, to labour and employ themſelues in all affayres, which ſhould bee thought fitting for ſo preſent a neceſſitie, ſending letters and meſſages to all parts to ayde him, as neede ſhould require. But the Tranſiluanians, who deſired to preuēt him, being ſtirred vp through a deepe reuenge, by a iuſt indignation, to ſee their Vayuode ſo cruelly murthered, and the Turkes (their capitall enemies) in their countrie, into the  which they neuer yet before entered; came with ſuch great diligence, that he beheld himſelfe rather aſſailed, then enuironed: notwithſtanding ſo ſudden an attempt, he loſt no courage, but animating his people, he ſo couragiouſly defended himſelfe, that he forced his enemies to retyre, a great number of them being ſlaine, or wounded by the arrowes and harquebuziers of the Ianiſaries. Maillat and the Saxon ſeeing the aſſault to be too hard and ſharpe for them, gaue ouer, and would attempt it no more, and willing to proue better fortune, cauſed their people to retire from the towne, and intrenched themſelues ſo cloſely about it, that none could neither enter nor ſally forth. During this ſiege, Gritty daily expected that he ſhould haue ſuch  ſuccour ſent him, as he demaunded: but ſeeing his hope to bee fruſtrate and none came, and that victuals began to faile them, and the forces to defend the towne were weakened, and that the inhabitants declared themſelues to be his enemies, began to fall into extreame deſpayre, &amp; although he had not then his health very perfect, notwithſtanding he omitted no meanes to attempt, by gifts and promiſes, to appeaſe the mindes of thoſe who did beſiege him. But he laboured in vaine, for the furie and rage which fomed in their courages for the premiſed matters, was ſo great, that by no meanes they would hearken to any ſuch inticements. But ſeeing himſelfe forſaken of Solymans officers, (who ſaid it was not in their power to ſend him any ayde,  without ſome commiſſion or authoritie from their Maſter) and being alſo abandoned of King Iohn, (who in his heart reioyced to ſee ſuch a tumult) of the Moldauian (of whom he more relied then of any other, for the aliance and peace which he had made with him) and withall being forſaken by Vrbain Batian, (who fearing likewiſe that which happened, ſaued himſelfe by

flight, by meanes of certaine Hungars his friends) he ſecretly by a poſte practiſed with the Moldauian, that he ſhould commaund his people, who were  in that ſiege with the Tranſiluanians, to let him paſſe, and that they ſhould endeuour to ſaue him, when he attēpted to come forth. He aſſuring himſelfe in vaine vpon ſuch an vncertaine promiſe, and being conſtrained by his fatall deſtinie, euen as ſoone as all the citizens of Megeſt were riſen in armes againſt him, and had opened one gate to them without, he was forced to open another, from whence deſirous to paſſe through the Moldauians (as had been accorded) he ſaw no perſon that ſhewed him any fauour: but on the contrarie, (anſwerable to the faith of a Barbarian) denying vnto him all promiſe Gritty taken by the Tranſiluanians, and afterwards executed. and ſafetie, did maſſacre his people, and as it were by a publike edict condemned them to death, ſuffering him to fall directly into the hands of  
               Micola, Francis Chendy, and Maillat, couſin of Counte Thomas Nadaſdy then Palatine of Hungarie, before whom being brought, that cap which he did weare of Martens Sables, made after the Turkiſh maner, being from his head caſt down to the ground, he was by a generall conſent left in the cuſtodie of Chendy, to ſee him executed. Being lead all about the Armie, he was in the middeſt thereof ſtayed: and being demaunded for what cauſe he willed Emeric to be ſlaine; he anſwered, that he commaunded no ſuch thing: but in the end he was made a preſident to all the world (according to the example of Polixena, ſacrificed vpon the tombe of Achilles) for an oblation to appeaſe the ghoſt of Emeric; and in cutting off his head he ſpoke nothing elſe  but theſe words: Ah our Ladie, to what point am I now brought vnto? In memoriall of ſuch a reuenge, euery one dipped either his helmet, or ſome The cuſtome of the Tranſiluanians. Iohn Doce torne in peeces. peece of his harneſſe in his blood. With the ſame coyne was alſo Iohn Doce payed, who was not onely beheaded, but, as a ſauage beaſt, was torne and drawne in peeces, in ſuch pitifull manner, as though he had neuer bin in the world. He which executed them, vnclothing Gritty, found within his skarlet breeches, which he was wont to weare, a purſe full of pretious ſtones, as Rubies, Diamonds, and Emeraulds, which, by eſtimation, were worth 25. or 30000. Duckets, and thoſe afterward were giuen King Iohn. This being performed, Chendy Ference, one of the principalleſt and richeſt Lords among the  Hungars and Tranſiluanians, who was among the other at the death of the ſaid murtherers, cauſed preſently his people to march on, and at laſt aſſayled the ſonnes of Gritty, remayning at Segheſuar with 500. Turkes, which did alwaies accompanie them, who being aduertiſed of their fathers lamentable death, and how Chendy Ference did purſue them, began with all diligence to ſearch the meanes to ſaue themſelues: but in the end they were intrapped and taken in a plaine, ſaying one to another; Wee greatly miſdoubted our ſelues of the Turkes, and now we ſhall dye by the hands of Chriſtians. And they were preſently, without any compaſſion, beheaded, and all thoſe who The children of Gritty beheadded. accompanied them ſlaine. Behold the miſerable end of Grittyes intolerable  pride, who by his euill gouernment loſt that within a moment, which in many yeeres he endeuoured himſelfe to aſpire vnto. Many were of opinion (yet I hold it falſe) that Grittyes returning into Hungarie, by the appointment of the grand Seigniour, was permitted him by the meanes of Abraham Baſha, 
               The deſeignes of Abraham Baſha. who determining to haue ſlaine Solyman, and made himſelfe Emperour of

Conſtantinople, had alreadie acquainted Gritty with part of his determinations,  whereby he might the rather conſent vnto his practiſes: becauſe ſuch a matter falling out, he thought by the force of his Armie to haue held all Hungarie in peace: and therefore it was ſaid, that this was the occaſion that moued Gritty, to put all thoſe to death whome he eſteemed great in reputation, and ſuch who might oppoſe themſelues againſt him, and ſomewhat impeach his enterpriſes. But often it is ſeene that humaine practiſes, although they be not periudiciall to any, doe ſeldome happen according to the deſire of the partie who manageth them. And therefore how much leſſe ought thoſe to ſucceede to a wiſhed end, which are wicked and deteſtable? which for the moſt part light vpon the backes of thoſe who inuent them, to  their great ſhame and confuſion. King Ferdinand of Aragon ſaid, That euill 
               Sentence. 
               councell doth for the moſt part bring more damage to him who giueth it, then to him who doth execute it: as it happened to theſe two, far from that which their ambitious mindes forethought vpon, for one of them died miſerably, as hath been ſaid, and the death of the other needed not to be any occaſion of enuie to the ſuruiuour: For that not long after, Abraham Baſha was accuſed by an Eunuch, verie domeſticall with the great Turke, to whom he diſcouered his intention, thinking he could not execute his practiſe without his aſſiſtance: and vpon this accuſation (although it was then ſaid, that it was for negligent gouerning the martiall affaires of Perſia) or as ſome ſay,  for a certaine Carcanet of precious ſtones which he bought for his wife, for enuie whereof, Roſa, Solymans concubine, was greatly incenſed againſt him; ſaying that this was done in contempt of her, in that ſhe would firſt haue bought it, before it was ſhowne to him, he was in the night ſtrangled as he ſlept in one of the grand Seigniours chambers, who alſo preſently commaunded Abraham Baſha ſtrangled. all his goods to be confiſcat, leauing his wife in great care and diſtreſſe for want of the benefit and commoditie of her dowrie.
            
               Gritty being thus defeated, the Tranſiluanians determined not to admit into their kingdome any of thoſe two Kings; namely King Iohn, and King Ferdinand; but to maintaine themſelues Neuters, electing a Captaine, who ſhould rule and gouerne them, vntill it might be determined which of  thoſe two ſhould be their lawfull King; and thus they gouerned a certaine time. But King Iohn within a while after, reduced them vnder his obedience. In the meane time, theſe two Princes did daylie make war one vpon the other, fortune being now fauorable to one, and immediatly to the other, and neuer any intermiſſion was of their quarrels, vntill it was concluded betweene them, that Iohn as long as he liued, ſhould enioy all that then he poſſeſſed, and after his death, all ſhould ſucceed to Ferdinand, 
               The agreement betweene Ferdinand and Iohn. or to his ſucceſſors, with ſuch conditions neuertheleſſe, that if Iohn left any children legitimat, Ferdinand was bound to giue them in recompence, ſo much of the reuenew of his patrimonie in townes and caſtles,  which ſhould be conuenient, honorably to maintaine their eſtate; and beſides, The death of Iohn King of Hungarie. Stephen the ſonne of Iohn, alſo called Iohn. the Vayuodſhip of Tranſiluania. Within few dayes after, occaſion preſented it ſelfe to execute theſe agreements, by the death of King Iohn, who left one only ſonne, borne eleuen daies before his death, named Stephen, who afterward by the commandement of the Turke, was alſo called Iohn, in

memorie of his Father. This Infant was borne of Queene Izabella, the Izabella daughter of the King of Polonia, and mother of Stephen. daughter of Sigiſmonde Kind of Polonia, who was his gardian and gouerneſſe  of the kingdome with George, who commonly was called the Frier, for ſo he was by profeſſion. This George was a Croatian borne, and diſcended of a noble family, but in great pouertie, and brought vp in the houſe of Iohns Mother, where he was employed in ſeruile and meane affaires, George the Frier, tutor of Stephen ſurnamed Iohn. A diſcourſe of the life of George. and he neuer had, during his youth, a more liberall imployment then the carrying of wood and coales to offices, and making fires. He ſeeing by this kinde of life, he could attaine to no higher promotion, being vrged with diſpaire, or incited by deſtinie, (which may be did prouoke him to doe it) became a Frier, of the order of Saint Benedic, in the Monaſterie of Saint Paul 
                by Buda; in which place during the firſt yeares, he had no better office, then in diſtributing the almes to the poore at the Abbey gate: and as he himſelfe ſome time ſaid, he beſtowed the better part to his friends, rather then to others. But he being of a liuely ſpirit and haughtie courage, knowing this his preſent fortune not to be ſufficient to attaine to any honor, or to be ranged amongſt worthie men, imagined in himſelfe, that certainely he ſhould neuer be aduanced to any place of eſteeme, as long as he was in ſuch obſcure eſtate. For this cauſe deſirous to put in practiſe his deuiſes which were impreſſed in his thoughts, he ſtudied to write faire, and to learne as much latine as would ſerue him to ſing a Maſſe. Which hauing  now ſufficiently obtained for his content, by meanes whereof attayning to the degree of a ſinging Prieſt, he endeuoured himſelfe ſo much, that he was entertained into the ſeruice of King Iohn, whileſt he was in Polonia chaſed from his kingdome; for whoſe affaires he trauailed into many places, and alwaies returned againe with quicke and faithfull expedition, ayding himſelfe greatly with his habit, vnder the colour of which he freely paſſed through euery place, for none ſuſpected, that vnder that habite he could performe ſuch waightie affaires, and it helped him much to eſcape from many great daungers and trauailes. After Iohn was returned into Tranſiluania, and that he had recouered his kingdome, he was then mindefull of  the ſeruice which the Frier had done him, and conſidering he had been ſo faithfull to him in his aduerſities, and knowing that all the daungers which he was often ſubiect vnto, and all the troubles which he had endured for his ſake, proceeded not but of a great loue and good affection, began now ſpecially to fauour and to accept of him to be neere about his owne perſon. And although that at the beginning, King Iohn gaue him not ſo great meanes, as willingly he would haue done; yet neuertheleſſe by his diligent ſeruices (being a man who well could temper himſelfe, and who had a paſſing ſubtile wit, and who naturally in his minde aſpired to great things) gayned the fauour of the King in ſuch ſorte, who noting in him ſuch great prudence and excellent wiſedome, made him of his counſell, and gaue him the  Treaſurerſhip: and not long after he was choſen Biſhop of Varadin. By ſuch dignities he came to ſo high authoritie, that he was in generall, greatly eſteemed and honored of all. And thus continuing his dutifull ſeruice, King Iohn drawing neere his end, not ſeeing any about him that was more prouident and circumſpect then Frier George, left him to be his ſonnes gardian,

and coadiutor in the adminiſtration and gouernment of his kingdome,  with Queene Izabella his wife. But he (who was of a turbulent and ſubtile conceite; and one who would not be ſatisfied with a little) diſpoſed of the affaires in ſuch cunning manner, that within few daies he had them all in his gouernment, and nothing was diſpatched without his conſent and appointment. Thus the affaires of the common weale being directed by his onely Councell, Ferdinand had now ſent to the Queene to demaund that part of the kingdome, which ſhe yet poſſeſſed in the name of her ſonne Stephen, the lawfull inheritour of Iohn, offering to giue him of his patrimonie, all that which in his fathers life time he promiſed him, and to performe all the couenants which was concluded betweene them. The Queene with  good will receiued theſe offers; ſaying, ſhe was content to ſatisfie all that which had been agreed vpon betweene him, and the King her husband. But Frier George, as Protector, would by no meanes conſent thereto, for that George hindereth the performance of the agreement which was betweene Ferdinand and Iohn. he would not loſe his reputation wherein he now was, conſidering that he ſhould not ſo eaſily ſtrip his puple of ſuch a kingdome, and alſo ſeeing that by ſuch a ſurrender, he ſhould greatly abate his owne eſtate and dignitie. Wherefore he retired himſelfe with the Queene and her ſonne into Buda, entertayning Ferdinand with delatorie words, and euery day alledging to his Ambaſſadours new excuſes, and in the meane time, gaue notice to the George demaundeth aide of the Turke againſt Ferdinand. Turke of all that which had paſſed, requeſting of him preſent ayde, foreſeeing that the end of this buſines could no wayes be determined, but by  warre. Ferdinand ſeeing how with vaine hopes he was delayed from day to day, in prolonging the time, and knowing all theſe things to be wrought by the ſubtiltie of the Friers inuention, would no longer temporize in the matter, but aſſembled 40000. men, and 40. great peeces of Artillerie, vnder the conduct of a Germane Lord, called William Roccandolph, high ſteward of his houſe, (who, as is a foreſaid, was with Counte Palatine within Vienna, when William Roccandolph Lieutenant for Ferdinand in Hungarie. it was beſieged by the Turkes) and ſent him as his Lieuetenant generall with this Armie, to aſſaile the towne of Buda, commaunding him to doe all that was poſſible to take the Frier who was within it, and to ſend him vnto him  to be reuenged of the mockeries which he vſed towards him. Roccandolph being departed, marched with his Armie directly to Buda, where being Buda beſieged by Roccandolph. come, he beſieged it on all ſides, making two batteries where the Artillerie did deſperatly batter, finding the towne well repaired, and otherwiſe then it was in former time. For Iohn by the arte and induſtrie of an ingenious Boullenois, had ſo ſtrongly fortefied it with Bulwarkes, inuironed it with walls, and incloſed it with deepe ditches, that it ſeemed verie hard for thoſe to win it, that did beholde the difficultie thereof. Towards one ſide of the towne there was a hill of ſome little height, as high as the walls, hauing a little valley which pleaſantly reached vnto the ſide of the ditch of the fortreſſe of the towne. Vpon the top of that hill was built a Church, named  Saint Girrard, from whence one might ſee the roofes of the Kings Pallace, and the gilded porches. Vpon that hill, Roccandolph (the more to amaze and terrefie the Queene) cauſed there to be planted certaine peeces of Artillerie, wherewith he battered the Pallace, and eſpecially a towre, which he ſo greatly ſhaked, that it was like to haue line on the ground (if the day following

he had continued his batterie) by the fall whereof it had broken and greatly ruinated the Palace. But fearing the loſſe of ſuch a worke, he cauſed his batterie  to ceaſe, reſpecting the infinite charges it would haue coſt in reedifying of it againe. And in the meane time he ſent to the Queene to incite her to keepe and performe the couenants, and to flie from the peſtilent aduiſes of Frier George, who vnder the colour of an ouerſeer and gardian of his Ward, aymed at no other thing but her ruine and vtter ouerthrow, aſſuring her (in the bountie of Ferdinand) that he had appointed a goodly principalitie for her &amp; her ſon, where they both ſhould liue in great pleaſure and friendſhip with their neighbours; declaring to her, that if ſhe was not determined to accept of theſe honourable conditions, he ſhould be forced preſently to plant greater batterie againſt the towne, and to ouerthrow and ruinate all  the fayreſt buildings which were within it. To theſe perſwaſions, Frier George made anſwere, that the Queene ſhould ſhew little iudgement, to change a kingdome for a Sepuſian principalitie, and from the royall dignitie of a Queene, to become an ordinarie Ladie. Thus the Frier deriding Roccandolph, did ſo ſpite and prouoke him, that he ſwore he would deſtroy and vtterly ruinate the towne, and cauſed all the force of his Artillerie to be brought to the place where the Iewes were buried, towards the Iewes Port, lying betweene the Eaſt and South, by the gate of Sabatia, where was the ſtrength of the Hungars, and good ſtore of Bohemians, vnder the conduct of Peren, and commaunded that without any intermiſſion the Cannon  ſhould play; and he with his Germanes made another batterie at the Port of the Iewes towards the Caſtle wall, behinde the which were the Queenes gardens. This batterie was maintained with ſo great violence, that the greateſt part of the Curtaine fell within the ditch, which ſo amazed the beſieged, that they thought rather to yeeld, then defend themſelues. But the night being come, Frier George ſeeing the Germanes retired, and that they prepared Frier George a diligent Captaine. themſelues the next morning to giue aſſault; during the night, he cauſed certaine trenches and rampiers to bee caſt vp behinde the breach, ſufficient to hinder and annoy the victorie of Roccandolph, which fortune had preſented to their ſight. When the dawning of the day was come, the Germanes  with their ladders ranne to the breach, and gaue the aſſault, the like being done on the other ſide at the Port of Sabatia by Peren, againſt whom thoſe of Buda gallantly oppoſing themſelues, they behaued themſelues ſo brauely, that they conſtrained their enemies to retire, who loſt at that aſſault about 900. men, and 2000. were wounded. By this diſgrace, Roccandolph being greatly incenſed, cōmanded that all violence ſhould be vſed to conquer the towne by art and cunning, ſeeing that by force he could not effect his purpoſe, wherefore he began to apply himſelfe to mynes. But the Budians being aduertiſed of this practiſe, tooke ſuch diligent care thereof, that all their  worke and labour turned to nothing.
            There was at that time within Buda a Hungar very wealthie, named Bornemiſſe, who harboured a ſpeciall hate againſt Frier George, for ſome iniurie which he pretended he had done him. He, to bee reuenged, cauſed ſecret Bornemiſſe a traytor to the Budians was executed. notice to bee giuen to Francis Ryuall his friend, who was in the Campe of Roccandölph, that if he liked thereof, he would in the night deliuer into their

hands the Port, which was by the Church of the Germanes, called S. Marie. 
                
               Roccandolph vnderſtanding of this complot by Ryuall, well allowed thereof, and hauing concluded betweene themſelues touching the manner that ſhould be obſerued therein: the ſame night, vpon which they had agreed of amongſt themſelues, Bornemiſſe failed not to open a poſterne which was in the wall, by which the enemie entered into the towne. But the watch walking the round, perceiuing this ſurpriſe, began to make an alarme, ſo that euery man had ſpeedie notice thereof. At this bruite and tumult, Vrbain Batian, and Peter Vicchy (who for that night were Captaines of the watch) ran preſently to the place, where the one part and the other were fighting with great obſtinacie: but in the end the Germanes were forced to turne their  backes, and ſaue themſelues by the ſame port wherein they entered. In the throng there was taken certaine priſoners, among whom were knowne ſome of familiar acquaintance with Bornemiſſe. Thoſe, after due examination, diſcouered the treaſon of Bornemiſſe, who was preſently attached, and all his goods ſeazed and confiſcate, who after, by diuers torments, confeſſed all the fact, and was by the commaund of Frier George cruelly tormented and executed as a Traytor to his countrie. Roccandolph ſeeing all his purpoſes came to no effect, and that fortune hourely did chaunge from proſperitie to aduerſitie, determined with his Captaines to auoyde the occaſions of handy ſtrokes, and onely by a long ſiege to attempt that, which by force of armes he could not performe. 
            
            In the meane time, Solyman vnderſtanding the euill entreatie which was vſed to the Queene, and how greatly Ferdinand forced himſelfe to take that kingdome from him, which he had giuen to her husband; after ſetting his affayres in order, which he had againſt the Perſians, leauing Archane an Eunuch in Meſopotamia, to make head againſt them, if they attempted any thing, ſent Mahomet Baſha to ayde the Queene with all his Europian ſouldiours, Mahomet Baſha came to ſuccour Queene Izabella. who among the Turkes are commonly called Rumilar, or Rumiler, and vulgarly Vrumilar, of this word Romania, which they call all Greece.
            
               Izabella not being aſſured of any ſuch ſuccors, was brought into great feare and extremitie, not knowing well what might betide her in this behalfe:  knowing alſo all their doings would but badly ſucceed, and neuer come to good iſſue, if they were intangled by armes: and eſpecially ſeeing that Ferdinand, for former matters, was grieuouſly offended, and that he conceiued of this matter at the heart againſt her, which alſo did not a little trouble her, becauſe ſhe knew that ſhe maintained an vniuſt cauſe, in not obſeruing the conditions made with him, during her husbands life. Vpon theſe conſiderations ſhe was often incited to render the towne, and eſpecially knowing Ferdinand to be a Prince ſo meeke and curteous, that he would commit no act which ſhould be any thing derogating from her honour, ſhe determined  to yeeld her ſelfe into his hands. But Frier George would by no meanes conſent thereto, for that he daily expected ſuccours from the Turke, who at laſt hauing notice of their comming, he then thought that theſe matters were not ſo ſlightly built, but that his affayres would be well ordered, as they had been alreadie begun.
            Thus during the ſiege, Solyman came to Andrionopolis, to be more neere

if need required it, retaining with him Roſtan Baſha; and he ſent Mustafa into Muſtafa Baſha ſent into Trā
                  ſiluania. Tranſiluania againſt Maillat, and commaunded Peter, Vayuode of Moldauia,  that he ſhould ayde him with all ſuch ſuccours, as Mustafa ſhould haue Forces of Mahomet. neede of. Peter with all expedition, after he had receiued this commaund, failed not in his fauour to furniſh him with 30000. horſe. Mahomet, whileſt Peter Vayuode of Moldauia. 
               Solyman came to Andrionopolis, and Mustafa drawing towards Tranſiluania, haſting on his voyage with the greateſt expedition he could, got to Belgrade, in which place he ioyned with the Sangiac of that prouince, who alſo was called Mahomet. Among them hee found ſufficient men of warre of Boſnia, of whom Oliman a Perſian was Sangiac. This name of Sangiac, or Oliman a Perſian. Sanzac, doth properly ſignifie an Enſigne of warre, made of a round peece  of copper guilt ouer, and fixed vpon the top of a ſtaffe, from which there hangeth downe in great treſſes of long haires, or horſe tailes, &amp; vpon the top of that round peece of copper, there is ſometimes faſtned a halfe Moone. Mahomet being together with all his troupes, made a good armie, &amp; marched in great iourneys towards Buda. Vpon his comming, the Germanes of Roccandolph being therof certified, began amōg themſelues to take aduice what was beſt to do. Some counſelled to forſake the ſiege, and others to incounter and giue battaile to the Turks. After ſuch and like opinions, that of Roccandolphs was followed, which was, that it was more expedient to preſerue the armie whole and ſafe, then ſo raſhly to aduenture it, and to doe an act which  might afterward be found diſhonourable to them all. According to this opinion he remoued his Campe from the other ſide of the towne to the foote Roccandolph remoueth his Campe. of S. Gerrards hill, hauing the riuer Danubius on the one ſide, and on the other ſide towards the Eaſt a great plaine, where he was well intrenched, being firſt poſſeſt of the top of the ſaid hill, where he well furniſhed himſelfe with Artillerie. And in this manner he attended his enemies, with this determination, that if they ſhould aſſaile him, he would fight with them, and moleſt them with his Artillerie from the top of that hill, and if hee ſhould be the weaker, or in any perill, he would retire himſelfe to the riuer, where he had many boates for that purpoſe, to goe and come to Peſthe, from whence  with more men he might reenforce his Campe, and entertaine the Turkes with little skirmiſhes, and in the meane time by a long ſiege to annoy the towne. Roccandolph being thus buſied, the Turkes began to approach, and Mahomet had ſent to view the ſituation of his Campe, and what courage his people were of. Roccandolph performed the like by Mahomet, who approched ſo neere him, that his Tents were no further from the Germanes then halfe Mahomet incamped by Roccandolph. a mile, cauſing all his Campe to bee enuironed by the Aſapes with a trench, and certaine rampiers. The other Mahomet of Belgrade was lodged vpon the next hils which compaſſed that plaine, where Roccandolph was incamped, and lodged himſelfe right ouer againſt S. Gerrards hill, neere vnto the Hungars of Ferdinand, who were lodged in that quarter. After that the  enemies were thus ſeated, the two Mahomets ſent their Ambaſſadours to ſalute the Queene, and preſented her with a great quantitie of Sheepe and Preſents ſent to Queene Izabella by Mahomet. Lambes, which they had brought along with them out of the countrie. Theſe Ambaſſadours entering into Buda, greatly admired at the diligent preparations and defences which they ſaw made in the towne, for the defence

thereof, greatly commending the force and conſtancie of the Budians,  that had ſo gallantly reſiſted the forces of Ferdinand, ſaying vnto them, that they alwaies bore them ſpeciall good will, and that they came for no other intent, then to reuenge all the wrong and iniuries which was offered to them. And hauing conferred with the Queene of all that which was giuen them in charge, they returned againe, receiuing preſents double as rich as thoſe which they brought with them, being honourably and pleaſantly entertained. The Turkes, by many aſſaults, ſuffered Roccandolph to take no reſt, whileſt on both ſides he was hindered by prouiding boates and barkes to keepe firme before one part of the Turkiſh armie which came vp Danubius, and was alreadie arriued at an Iland called Chep, nigh vnto the banke ſide,  which, if he had followed the aduice that the Hungars preſcribed, ſhould haue been fortified and well planted with Artillerie, before the enemies had been maſters thereof, for by that meanes they might haue endamaged their armie, and eaſily defended that they ſhould not haue incamped there, by reaſon they ſhould haue been conſtrained (maugre their wils) to forſake that plaine, and retire backe, conſidering that from that Ile, the Cannon might ſcoure the plaine in any part whereſoeuer. But wicked and aduerſe deſtinie, willing that Buda ſhould by any meanes whatſoeuer fall into the hands of Solyman, and that the armie of Ferdinand, by the careleſnes of the Commaunders, ſhould bee broken and ouerthrowne, blinded Roccandolph 
                that he had no care to fortifie it, but onely with certaine ſouldiours, and a few field peeces. Mahomet, who was not in any thing negligent, perceiuing another hill, which was by the Iland where the Germanes had the guard (being very drowſie and ſluggiſh in their charge) did deliberate with himſelfe to aſſaile them on the ſudden, whileſt in another place he cauſed the alarme to be giuen to the whole bodie of Roccandolphs Campe. Following this determination, before the dawning of the day he commaunded his veſſels to ſaile before the Ile, and giue the aſſault vpon thoſe of Roccandolph, which were alſo by the Ile, and againſt the bridge, which he cauſed to bee built, that vpon any occaſion he might ſaue himſelfe and retire to Peſthe.  The Ianiſaries entring ſuddenly within this Ile, began to cut the throates of The Ile of Chep taken by the Turks. the ſouldiours who had the guard thereof, and of whom before they were wakened from their dead ſleepe, and that they were ſomewhat ſafe from the feare that had before poſſeſſed thē, there remained ſlaine vpon the place well neere 600. The bruite of this alarme being ſpread abroad, our ſouldiours, who were on the other ſide, putting themſelues in order, began to diſcharge certaine peeces of Artillerie, which were vnder the couert of a wood, lately cut, by the riuers ſide, and ſo greatly annoyed the armie of the Turkes, that they were very rudely diſordered: and if thoſe of Roccandolphs armie had that day acquited themſelues of their vttermoſt deuoire, they had quite ouerthrowne  all their enemies, who in the end, by the diſorder that happened amongſt ours, and by the dexteritie of the Ianiſarie harquebuziers, remained victorious, all the veſſels of Roccandolph being taken and broken, the greateſt part of the bridges cut off, and the Ile vnder the Turkes command. At the ſame inſtant Mahomet commaunded that the reſt of Roccandolphs Campe ſhould be aſſailed in two places, which then by the proweſſe and valiantnes

of the Bohemians and Hungars, and certaine Germane Captaines, they held good, and for that time maintained firme and ſure footing. But  the tediouſnes of the fight was an occaſion that the forces of Ferdinand waxed faint and wearie: and to the contrarie, thoſe of Buda, by reaſon of the Turkiſh ayde, increaſed their courage.
            
               Solyman being aduertiſed of all that which paſſed vntill then, departed Solyman entereth into Hungarie. from Andrionopolis in great iourneys with 200000. men to come to Buda, and marching with great diligence, gaue notice to Mahomet of his departure, which being alſo knowne to Peren, who was one of the chiefeſt of Roccandolphs armie, cauſed preſently the Councel to aſſemble, perſwading them inſtantly to retire to Peſthe, and not to attend the arriuall of all the Turkiſh  force. To this opinion Roccandolph anſwered, that he could not depart without the commaund of Ferdinand: and vpon that reſolution, Salm was diſpatched to goe towards Vienna, and whileſt within a Brigantine he went a long Danubius, feare and neceſſitie in the end conſtrained Roccandolph to raiſe and retire himſelfe to Peſthe, beginning in this manner to march with Roccandolph raiſeth his Campe. his people. Firſt, he ſent before all the Hungars with the great Artillerie, waggons, and other baggage, which ſhould any thing annoy his armie vpon the way: after thoſe, all the Germane and Bohemian Caualarie marched, with a good troupe of infantrie: and in the rereward marched all the footmen, with the reſt of the baggage. Euen now the Vauntgard and battaile  were alreadie (by the obſcuritie of the night) arriued at Danubius, cauſing bridges of boates to be made. When the two Mahomets were aduertiſed thereof, by two Vſaron horſemen (who fled from Roccandolphs Campe) they preſently aſſembled together, and cauſed their people to march in two places, ſending the Ianiſaries of one ſide, with a good troupe of Caualarie: and on the other ſide, the remainder of al the horſe, with all the infantrie that The ouerthrow of Roccandolphs armie. remained. The beginning of their aſſault was with cryes and horrible ſhrikings directed vpon the Germane quarter, which they preſently fired. The Germanes and Bohemians, who alreadie were at the riuers ſide, were greatly aſtoniſhed at ſo ſudden a charge, endeuouring themſelues to diſſemble  their flight, they began valiantly to make head. But all the reſt of the armie in the Tents was out of order, and eſpecially thoſe a long the ſide of Danubius, where euery one, without order or ſhame, endeuoured to ſaue himſelfe by preſſing into the boates, and neither by blowes, threates, nor intreaties, were any able to draw them back, much leſſe to make them ſtand and turne their faces: ſo great was the feare they were poſſeſt withall, and the more, in reſpect of the aſtoniſhment which the fearfull thundring of the Cannon made that night in euery place, and euery one was ſo degenerated and diſcouraged, that neither Roccandolph nor his commaunds were of any force or authoritie to ſtay them, who alſo, beſides the incomparable griefe which greatly oppreſſed him, was ſore wounded, and by his indiſpoſition, the reſt  of the ſouldiours, who were appointed to fight, being aduertiſed of this generall feare, retired themſelues by little and little, ſeeking by flight to ſaue themſelues as well as they could. Thus all in the end went to the ſpoyle and ruine of fortune. The ſouldiours of Peren were the firſt that were charged by thoſe of Belgrade; and the Germanes, who kept S. Gerrards hill, were

ouerthrowne by the Ianiſaries and Turkiſh Caualarie, and with great  ſlaughter were throwne headlong downe. The Budians ſallying forth by the Port of the water towre (ſo called for that it was continually beaten vpon with the waues of Danubius) and taking a couert way, which was made before by King Iohn, charged vpon the flankes of the Bohemians, ouerthrowing all thoſe who were before them. The Turkes who were at the guard of the Ile of Chep, vnderſtanding of this tumult, cauſed their veſſels to flote vp againſt thoſe of Roccandolphs, vnder the charge of Caſſon their Captaine, who after a long fight againſt their enemies, and ſeeing the diſgrace of fortune (which vpon all ſides was poured out againſt our ſouldiours) vnlooſing themſelues from the hands of the Turkes, and being more  light and ſwift then they, began to cut the water with the force of their oares, and with a ſpeedie ſwiftnes ſaued themſelues in the Ile of Comar. Frier George in the meane time, in another part ſet fire on the Kings ſtables, which were poſſeſſed by Roccandolphs people, and which was full of hay, which burnt ſo cruelly, that the light thereof was ſeene in Peſthe, and by the vehemencie thereof, it ſeemed all Danubius had been on fire. By ſuch an vnlooked for alteration of fortune, all the reſt of Roccandolphs Armie hauing loſt both courage and men, they fled in great route, and 3000. ſouldiours of ſeuerall nations, (who flying the crueltie of the enemie, retired themſelues into the Church of Saint Gerrard) were all cut in peeces, not ſparing the life of any, but thoſe which they could ſell or keepe for ſlaues. Caſſon 
                with his people and veſſels purſuing them that did flie, and arriuing by Peſthe, gaue ſuch a feare to the ſouldiours and Citizens, and to thoſe who Peſthe taken by the Turkes. were newly ſaued, that preſently forſaking their habitation, they left him to be Maſter of the towne, without any further impeachment. Vpon his entering into this towne, he committed the moſt horrible maſſacres amongſt the poore inhabitants, that euer was heard of, and ſo generall was the ſlaughter, that the bloud ran downe the ſtreetes like a little brooke, not ſparing any of what degree of ſexe ſo euer.
            
               Roccandolph now ſeeing his Armie to be wholly diſcomfited, was conſtrained to take a Brygantine, and ſaue himſelfe in the Ile of Comar, where  within few dayes after, he ended his life in the towne of Samar, leauing to The death of Roccandolph. the Turkes, with great loſſe of his nation, victorie, in which defeature, beſides the loſſe of 36. great peeces of Artillerie, and 150. leſſer, there was ſlaine 25000. men, not counting the infinit number of thoſe who were made ſlaues. Solyman (who greatly deſired to giue ſuch a checke) vnder the colour to aide the Queene and the Frier, marched with as great diligence as he could, and made verie great haſte; but firſt conceiued with himſelfe, to be ſecure of the ſuſpition which he had of Stephen Maillat, (who at that time gouerned Tranſiluania in the name of Ferdinand) againſt whom (as we  haue ſayd before, not willing to leaue behinde him ſuch an enemie) he ſent Muſtafa. This man aſſiſted with 30000. horſe by Peter, Vayuode of Moldauia, with the Vayuodes of Tranſalpina and Valachia, and with the Muſtafa warreth in Tranſiluania. men of Achomet, who was Sangiac of Nicopolis, together with this Armie, which beſides the infantrie, amounted to 50000. horſe, ſet forward againſt Tranſiluania, whereinto he entered by Sicilia, notifying to the Tranſiluanians,

that he was not come with any intention to ſpoyle or deſtroy them, but only to negotiate and treate of certaine important affaires with Vayuod  
               Maillat: againſt whom notwithſtanding he cauſed his people to march. Maillat ſeeing himſelfe enuironed with ſo great a multitude of enemies, Maillat Lieutenant for Ferdinand in Tranſiluania. and finding himſelfe in feriour both in men and other forces, and being out of hope to haue that aide which Ferdinand promiſed him, (by reaſon of his late ouerthrow before Buda) doubting of that which afterward happened, determined with himſelfe to retire to Fogar (a Caſtle in Tranſiluania) which by reaſon of ſcituation and art, being marueilous ſtrong and defenſible, was preſently enuironed by Muſtafaes Armie, and furiouſly battered Fogar beſieged by Muſtafa. with Artillerie. But the enemies ſeeing neither by 1000. aſſaults, which in vaine they had attempted, nor by any force they could win it, aduiſed with  
               Achomet, to vſe ſome cunning and deceit, to effect his enterpriſe; whereupon they ſent to Maillat, perſwading him by all effectuall reaſons, that he ſhould yeeld himſelfe to Solyman, and to ſeeke this reputation and fauour, rather to be in the number of his friends, then of his enemies, and from whom he could not chuſe but hope for infinite clemencie and many great fauours; they further aſſuring him that he would freely leaue him the degree of Vayuodſhip, with the whole ſeignorie of that prouince, and that he would demaund of him no other thing, but a certaine reaſonable and honeſt tribute: and beſides they perſwaded certaine Tranſiluanians, to goe and negotiate with him about this buſines, if they would haue peace and quietnes  betweene them; and aboue all they ſhould endeauor that he might come to parley with them, becauſe if he did otherwiſe, they would with fire and ſword, in the worſt ſort they could make war vpon them. Theſe meſſengers endeauored ſo far, that they entered into Fogar, and conferred with Maillat of all that which they had incharge, greatly importuning him with earneſt entreaties, that if he reſpected the loue and good of the whole countrie, he would not refuſe ſo honeſt and large conditions of peace, nor yet contemne the friendſhip which in the name of Solyman, was liberally offered to him. Maillat although he repoſed no truſt in the words of Muſtafa and Achomet, in reſpect of their inconſtancie, nor in thoſe of the Moldauian, who  ſeemed to be the onely meanes; neither in like ſort in the offers which were offered to him: thought notwithſtanding not altogether to diſpiſe the conditions of peace, and promiſed to come forth, and offer himſelfe to Muſtafa, if Achomet would giue his ſonne for pledge. But it was refuſed by Achomet: ſaying, that he had alreadie giuen him to Solyman, and that he was not now in his gouernment, therefore he could not diſpoſe of him without his commaundement; but in place of him, and that he ſhould thinke himſelfe well ſatisfied, he would giue him foure principall Captaines of his Caualarie for hoſtages and performance of his faith; which offer Maillat refuſed. But the earneſt entreaties of the Tranſiluanians, (who perſwaded him  to goe) tooke ſuch effect in him, that like a good Captaine and faithfull to his Countrie, careles of all future miſhaps which might befall him, for the generall and common good of all, he was content to accept of this offer, and he (good man) as one ignorant of the ſiniſter fortune, and treaſon which was wrought againſt him, after he had receiued the hoſtages, went forth

with a goodly companie to the Turkes Campe, he being conducted to Muſtafa 
                and Achomet, of whom he was honourably receiued. And for the more commodious treating of ſuch things as ſhould bee concluded vpon betweene them, vpon the conditions which were offered to him, the parley was deferred vntill another day, and vpon that day the Moldauian inuited him to dinner, and he in the meane time returned to Fogar. The appointed day being come, the Moldauian cauſed a ſumptuous banquet to bee prepared, and commanded thoſe who ſhould be preſent, that at the ſitting downe at the table, they ſhould propound certaine pleaſant and facetious ſpeeches, and that from them they ſhould proceede to outragious words, and after that to armes, and that vpon this tumult they ſhould ſeize vpon Maillat, and  take him priſoner. Which from point to point was fully performed, as had been before determined of. For Maillat being come to the Tent of the Moldauian, was by him entertained with great mirth, and cheerefully. And dinner time being come, he placed him at the table with all the other inuited: who, after they had exhilerated themſelues with pleaſant diſcourſes, performed that ſo well which they had in charge, as taking armes in hand, they would needes offer violence to Maillat, who in ſuch an act minding to Maillat areſted priſoner among the Turkes by treaſon. crie out treaſon, and to defend himſelfe (being a very ſtrong and ſtout man) and to accuſe the Moldauian of that infamous deede, he was preſently ſeized vpon, and bound, and ſpoyled of the richeſt things he brought with him, he exclaiming that he had thus vilanouſly, and vnder pretence of friendſhip,  ſo treacherouſly deceiued him. Achomet came in, who, faining bitterly to reprehend the Moldauian for ſuch a diſhonourable act, aduiſed him not to violate that faith, for confirmation whereof, pledges had been giuen, and that he ſhould not be an occaſion of the death of thoſe Captaines which were ſent to Fogar. To whom (in manner of diſdaine) the Moldauian made anſwere, that he cauſed him to bee apprehended for certaine iniuries which he had receiued of him, and that he would keepe him aliue, and ſend him to Solyman, who afterwards ſhould iudge whether hee were iuſtly taken or no. 
            
            This being done, the Caſtle of Fogar (after the pledges were ſet at libertie) by the treaſon and wickednes of thoſe who commaunded it in the abſence of Maillat, was within a while after yeelded to the Turkes: although ſome ſay that it was for the deliuerie of Maillat, and thoſe of his traine. By Fogar taken. this meanes Maillat, and (as we ſhall hereafter ſpeake of) Valentine alſo (who were the two principalleſt of the Hungars, and who alone were remaining of the ancient Huns) vnfortunately happened at one time vnder the tyrannie of their enemies, who cauſed them to dye in priſon at Conſtantinople: and not being able otherwiſe to vanquiſh them by armes, they were in the end ſubdued by the deceit and treacherie of Peter the Moldauian. 
            
            
               Mustafa and Achomet hauing the poſſeſſion of Fogar, and not ſeeing The Tranſiluanias ſweare fidelitie to Stephen. any who oppoſed themſelues againſt them, cauſed all the Tranſiluanians to ſweare fealtie to Stephen, the ſonne of King Iohn, vnder whoſe gouernment euery one liued peaceably, hauing been, before that, thirtie yeeres in ſubiection to his father, vnto whom they were very affectionate and faithfull ſubiects.
            
               
Theſe things being thus pacified in Tranſiluania, the two Mahomets tooke their way towards Solyman, who trauailing in great haſt, receiued  newes of the victorie which the two Mahomets obtained at Buda, which was the cauſe that afterward he marched more ſlowly, and performed his iourney at his owne eaſe, and with great pleaſure. In the end, at the beginning of Auguſt, Anno 1531. he arriued within two miles and a halfe of Solyman arriued neere vnto Buda, Anno, 1531. Buda, where he lodged his Campe, being come, not ſo much to reſtore the Queene and her ſonne to their firſt eſtate and tranquillitie (as to euery one hee bruited abroade) as to reduce this towne vnder his tiranny, and to ſettle himſelfe there, without any great expence, knowing the commoditie and ſuccours that he might receiue thereby in his warres, which he hoped to commence againſt Ferdinand. The Armies of the two victorious  
               Mahomets being ioyned to his Campe, he did highly commend them; and alſo Muſtafa and Achomet, becauſe without effuſion of blood, they had with ſuch good expedition, brought the affaires of Tranſiluania to ſo wiſhed an end: and after that, they preſented to him Maillat as a priſoner, who within Maillat ſent to Conſtantinople. a while after was ſent to Conſtantinople with Valentine Turkey. Afterwards there were brought before him, and before the Sangiacs and Baſhaes, all the other priſoners who were taken at the ouerthrow of Roccandolph, and were bound with long cordes foure and foure together, being about 800. amongſt whom were certaine Captaines of marke, namely Baltaſar 
               The maſſacre of priſoners executed by the Turkes. 
               Pocan, Taiſch, Burſicchy a Bohemian, and others, whoſe liues were ſaued  at the inſtance of the Queene, and all the reſt (as thoſe who contemning the peace and friendſhip, which by his Ambaſſadours he offered vnto them) were by him condemned to die, which preſently was performed by the Ianiſaries, in ſuch ſort, that in an inſtant they were beheaded; which certainly was a miſerable ſpectacle.
            This being done, Solyman ſent three fayre horſes to King Iohns ſonne, furniſhed Preſents of Soliman to Stephen, and to the Hungariſh Lords. with golden harneſſe, pearles, pretious ſtones, and rich plumes, apparell, and cloath of gold. He alſo ſent to other Hungariſh Lords, and the chiefe men of his Court, certaine fayre long gownes after the Turkiſh manner, and chaines of gold. His Ambaſſadours being admitted to ye Queenes preſence,  preſented, in the name of their Lord and Maſter, to euery one the preſents which they brought, and courteouſly intreated the Queene to ſend her ſon with the chiefeſt of her Court to Solyman, who greatly deſired to ſee him, Soliman requeſted that Stephen might be ſent him. and that ſhe would not diſtruſt any thing; aſſuring her, that all ſhould fortunately ſucceede to her owne content; this being his vſuall manner, not only to maintaine and increaſe the kingdomes and eſtates of his friends, but alſo to defend and preſerue them: and that for that cauſe hee deſired to know and imbrace his ſonne, who had been ſo great a friend vnto him, and in token of perpetuall amitie, to be acquainted with him: and in reſpect of her, that he bare no leſſe regard and honour vnto her, then if ſhe were his owne  daughter or childe: and that he would willingly haue come to viſite her, if it were not forbidden him by his law, and that alſo to preſerue her honour, and to auoyde all ſuſpition, he would by no meanes that ſhe ſhould come and viſite him in his Pauilion, contenting himſelfe to haue the child ſent him with his Nurſe. Solyman made this requeſt, to the end that he might with

more eaſe get poſſeſſion of the towne of Buda, (as within a while after by a certaine deceit he did) and alſo to ſee if this childe were a ſonne or daughter,  for that it was bruited to bee a daughter, and the rather ſo ſuſpected, becauſe the Queene would not ſuffer any to ſee it, and therefore ſhe had it priuately nurſed, and to know the certaintie thereof, he was deſirous that ſhe ſhould ſend the child to him. The Queene being greatly troubled by ſuch a demaund, would willingly haue made a reſolute anſwer to the contrarie, that ſhe would doe nothing therein: but preſently Frier George interrupted her, and praied her that for the auoyding of doubt in the mindes of the barbarous Stephen, by the perſwaſiō of George, is ſent to Solyman. Turkes, ſhe would not faile but ſend him, offering to accompanie him himſelfe, and to bring him backe againe ſafe and ſound. By ſuch ſpeeches the Queene was ſomewhat appeaſed, and cauſed her ſonne to be richly  apparelled, as beſeemed the maieſtie of a King, and ſent him in a faire Coach richly gilt, hauing with him his Nurſe, and certaine Ladies; and in this equipage ſhe ſent him, accompanied with all thoſe who had receiued preſents from the Turke. He approaching nigh the Turkes Campe, certaine troupes of horſe, in excellent good order, and followed of many bands of Ianifaries, were ſent before to meete him, and doe him all honour, and he was placed in the middeſt of them, and conducted with this pompe to Solyman, who, with all lenitie and curteſie, friendly receiued him as a Vaſſall of his houſe, and ſonne of a King, which had been his great friend, being alſo willing that his children, Selim and Baiazet, (borne of Roſa his wife) ſhould doe him the like  honour. Theſe two children onely were in the Campe with their father: Muſtafa his eldeſt ſonne, and borne of Cercaſſa his firſt wife, was then ſent into Amaſia, vpon the frontiers of Perſia, by the ſubtiltie of the ſaid Roſa, who aſpired to exalt her owne children, and debaſe and ſuppreſſe the other. Solyman hauing curteouſly entertained this childe, and making ſhew to him of all poſſible good will, commaunded the Baſhaes to inuite all the Hungariſh Lords to dine with them, and that they ſhould prepare a bountiful banquet, furniſhed with all ſorts of daintie cates. Afterward he commaunded certaine Captaines, that (during this feaſt) they ſhould faine themſelues to goe and ſee the towne of Buda, and alſo finde the meanes to ſeize thereon without  
               Buda taken by the Turkes with deceit. any bruite or tumult, making ſhew, that as ſome entered, others ſhould come forth, to the end that the Budians might not diſtruſt this matter, which was wiſely performed. For many entered by troupes by the Port of Sabatia, with ſemblance onely, as though they had been ſtrangers deſirous to be hold nouelties and the ſingularitie of a towne: but few came forth, and many of them remained within, in ſo much that for one of them that came out, there entered ſeuen. And by this policie (when they thought themſelues of ſufficient number) they ſuddenly forced the guard of that Port, who nothing diſtruſting ſuch a treacherie, were content to yeeld, and theſe being ſeized thereof, they gaue thereby enterance to a good troupe of ſouldiours,  who were not farre from thence ambuſhed, attending the iſſue thereof. They being now maſters of the towne, they preſently paſſed to the place and Palace of the King, and the Captaine of the Ianifaries made proclamation through the towne, that none ſhould come out of his houſe, but that euery one ſhould peaceably ſtay therein, and that if the citizens would liue in

quiet, they ſhould render vp their armes into his cuſtodie, which was preſently done; and in token of their fidelitie, euery citizen tooke a Turke into  his houſe to lodge, and they all carried themſelues ſo mildly, that it ſeemed The marueilous obedience of the Turkes. there was neuer enemie entered into the towne, nor any Turke whoſoeuer durſt giue his hoſt a foule word.
            
               Solyman vnderſtanding that Buda was taken, and all things quiet therein, (although it was almoſt night) ſent the Queene her ſonne againe, retaining Stephen ſent back to Buda, and the Hungariſh Lords were ſtayed. with him all thoſe Princes and Lords who accompanied the King, namely, Frier George Biſhop of Varadin, Peter Vicchy, neere kinſman to King Iohn, and one whom the Queene greatly reſpected, Batian Vrbain, Gouernour of Buda, Stephen Verbetz, great Chauncellor of Hungarie, and Valentine Turky, 
                Lieutenant generall of the Kings armie, with many other. The Queene ſeeing by this craft and deceit her towne taken, and thoſe great perſonages who accompanied her ſonne, to bee detained priſoners by thoſe, of whom ſhe thought to finde ayde and comfort, knew not for the preſent what to do, being as much as was poſſible, ſurpriſed with a feare of the worſt, &amp; with a certaine griefe which happened by ſuch an vnexpected aduerſitie: ſhe, duly conſidering of theſe premiſes, fearing leaſt the reſt ſhould alſo be taken away frō her, writ very humble and ſubmiſſiue letters to Solyman, inſtantly requeſting him not to violate or offer iniurie to the fidelitie, which ſhe had repoſed in him, &amp; which he confirmed vnto her by many his Letters patents, and  that in like ſort he would be mindful of his accuſtomed clemencie and magnanimitie on the behalfe of his childe, who of his owne accord made himſelfe the friend and Vaſſall of his houſe: and that it would pleaſe him to releaſe thoſe Lords, which he detained as priſoners, who had ſo well ſerued and defended her, during the paſſed warres, conſidering that vpon his faith and royall promiſe ſhe had ſent them with her ſonne. This letter being ſent, was ſufficient to mollifie the outragious furie of the Turke, who, vpon the receipt thereof, held a Councell to conſult thereupon. And opinions A Councell held vpon the deliuerie of the priſoners. were different, and did not agree together. Mahomet, Gouernour of Belgrade, with many other, would that all thoſe Lords that were priſoners  ſhould be beheaded, and that they ſhould ſend the Queene and her ſonne to Conſtantinople; that hee ſhould place a Baſha in Buda, with a good and ſtrong garriſon to gouerne and defend it againſt the aſſaults of the Chriſtians. On the other ſide, Rostan Baſha (vnto whom the Queene had ſent rich preſents) refuted the opinion of Mahomet, and of his adherents: ſaying, that if Solyman followed their aduice, he would greatly blemiſh the reputation of his renowne, and that his faith and promiſe would not bee any whit at all eſteemed among other nations, when they ſhould ſo apparantly ſee that it was not obſerued, eſpecially to thoſe, vnto whom at their owne requeſts and intreaties, he had giuen it for ayde and ſuccour; and that the example of Buda conſidered, neuer any would afterwards call him to ſuccour  them, fearing that the like ſurpiſe would happen to them: and therefore he thought it better to ſuffer the Queene to enioy her ſtate in peace, with ſome augmentation of tribute, and by that meanes he ſhould auoyde the infamie of infidelity, whereinto euery one of them ſhould fall with euerlaſting ignomie. By meanes of ſuch diuerſitie of opinions, the Baſhaes could not agree,

               Solyman not determined of any reſolution, diſſolued the Councel, ſeeing the  time was come wherein (according to his law) he ſhould offer ſacrifice to God, which was the 30. of Auguſt: and to that end he ſent into Buda his Sacrifice made by Solyman in the great Church of Buda. Prieſts, to conſecrate for him the great Church, according to the Mahometaine manner. And they ouerthrew all the Aulters, and pulled downe all the Images, clenſing and hallowing the Church after their cuſtome. That being done, Solyman with his Sacrificers entered into the towne, taking therevpon occaſion to diſmiſſe the Councell, and would not execute any thing, concerning that which his Baſhes had counſelled him vnto. But taking a more milde and pleaſing courſe, hee gaue notice to the Queene, that ſhe Solyman ſent Queene Izabella and her ſonne Stephen to gouerne in Tranſiluania. and her ſonne ſhould preſently depart the Caſtle, and that ſhe ſhould retyre to Lippa, which is beyond Tibiſcus, to gouerne the kingdome of Tranſiluania,  where ſhe might liue in better ſecuritie and content, then at Buda, and where ſhe ſhould be a neighbour to the kingdome of Sigiſmond King of Polonia her father, and there they ſhould remaine vntill her ſonne ſhould come to age, and be able to gouerne and rule that kingdome, of which he offered himſelfe to bee an ouerſeer and protector, promiſing to make reſtitution thereof vnto him at that time; alleadging for his excuſe, that it imported her ſonne no leſſe to haue ſufficient and carefull ouerſeers to gouerne Hungarie, then of other perſons able to defend and preſerue it for him. Whereupon he nominated Peter Vicchy to be Gouernour of the County of Themeſuar, &amp; of Peter Vicchy Gouernour of Tranſiluania. the neighbour countries bordering thereon, and willed that Stephen Verbetz, 
                a man in yeeres, wiſe, and prouident, ſhould remaine at Buda to execute Iuſtice, and to haue reſpect to the Hungars. And to encourage her the more to depart, and beginne her iourney with beſt conuenience, hee offered her waggons and horſe, as many as ſhould bee ſufficient to carrie her baggage, and other moueables, and beſides, he appointed her a ſufficient conuoy of Caualarie, and Ianiſaries to accompanie her vnto Tibiſcus, he hauing (notwithſtanding thoſe his fained promiſes) another ſecret intention in himſelfe, that within a while he would make himſelfe abſolute Lord, not only of Tranſiluania, but alſo of all Hungarie, which was on the other ſide of Danubius towards Vienna, not being able at that time to proſecute ſo difficult a  matter, in reſpect of many occaſions &amp; impediments, which did then greatly hinder him from it. Afterwards he named King Stephen his Vayuode, and George with the Queene ouerſeer of Stephen. confirmed the Queene to bee his gouerneſſe, raigning in Tranſiluania, and made Frier George her coadiutor &amp; Treaſurer, following therein the laſt will of King Iohn, bequeathed to him by his Teſtament, of which he ſaid he was and would be an executor. The Queene hauing vnderſtood this cruell and vnlooked for commaund, and bathing her face with teares, did extreamely blame and grieuouſly crie out againſt the naturall impietie of ſo damnable and faithles a Lord, who (againſt his vowed faith) depriued her both of her kingdome, and of all that which ſhe held moſt deere: but ſeeing no remedie,  ſhe patiently yeelded to fortune her enemie, and left the Fortreſſe (out The Queene departeth from Buda. of the which the Turkes would not ſuffer her to take any Artillerie nor munition, but onely her moueables) and tooke her iourney out of the towne of Buda, with ſuch prouiſion of waggons and horſe, as Solyman would appoint her.
            
               
Vpon her departure, the Turke preſently ſet at libertie all thoſe Lords The Hungariſh Lords ſet at libertie. which he kept priſoners, except Valantine Turky, who, as hath been ſaid, was  ſent priſoner with Maillat to Conſtantinople, where within a while after they both dyed. The other, although they were greatly offended to ſee The death of Maillat. themſelues ſo fraudulently depriued of their lands and goods, yet were they exceeding ioyous, ſeeing themſelues free and ſecure of their liues, whereof they ſtood in great dread. They being thus at libertie, they preſently went to the Queene, who, together with them and the Frier, and certaine other of her houſehold, tooke their way towards Tranſiluania, being often conſtrained for want of horſes, to draw her Coach with oxen, which ſhe notwithſtanding endured with an inuincible and noble courage: alreadie very well The conſtancie of the Queene. perceiuing that her affayres were in a manner declining; and beſides, ſeeing  her ſelfe (according to womans nature) to bee a weake and tender woman, not able to reſiſt ſo ſad and heauie blowes, which fortune began alreadie to torment her with. But being now fully reſolued to make ſmall account of al misfortunes that might betide her, took notwithſtanding alwaies good heede (during theſe aduerſities) to preſerue her authoritie and royall gouernment, in ſuch decent and diſcreete manner, that during her life ſhe was greatly honoured therefore, as her dignitie well merited.
            In the meane time while the Queene with theſe complaintes and griefes drew neere Tranſiluania, Ferdinand hauing receiued vnder the conduct of Roccandolph this bloudie ouerthrow, and wonderfull loſſe of people,  Artillerie, Munition, and ſpeciall townes of importance, diſtruſting the Turk would amaſſe together all his Armie before Vienna, preſently diſpatched Leonard Velſh to the Ile of Comar, (after the death of Roccandolph) to reallie Ferdinand ſent to Solyman to demaund peace. the remnant of his Armie, and with all ſpeed to conduct them to Vienna, and to fortifie the ſaid Ile with the beſt defence he could. And ſeeing on the other ſide his brother the Emperour Charles ſo buſied in the affaires of Germanie, that he could not then ſend him any ſuccours, did deliberate with himſelfe by Ambaſſages to require peace, and to proue how Solyman was affected towards him. To this end he ſent an Ambaſſage by Nicholas 
               Rich preſents ſent to Solyman by Ferdinand. 
               Salm, and Sigiſmond Liteſtan with rich and excellent preſents to him, among  which was a cup of golde, beautified and enriched with pretious ſtones of great valew, furniſhed with a couer, vpon the which was a diall, that did not onely containe in it the courſe of the howers, Moone, and Sunne; but alſo of all the other Starres and Planets. It was a worke made with ſuch excellent and marueilous art, that it ſeemed a miracle of nature to them, who could ſeriouſly contemplate of the rarenes thereof; and it came by ſucceſſion from the Emperour Maximilian. Theſe Ambaſſadours arriuing at the Turkes Campe, firſt preſented themſelues to Roſtan Baſha, and afterward to Baſha Caſſon, who lodged them in honorable tents, and the day following,  they dined with the Baſhaes at their owne table. The feaſt being ended, they tooke from them their weapons, and alſo their kniues, (according The manner to preſent an Ambaſſadour before the Turke. to their cuſtome) and were by the Baſhaes (euery one of them betweene two Baſhaes that lead them arme in arme) preſented before Solyman, whoſe hand they kiſſed, and after offered him their preſents, which greatly pleaſed him, and eſpecially the veſſell of golde, that bore this admirable

dial, which he ſo curiouſly beheld, that he could not therewith ſufficiently  ſatisfie his greedie ſight (ſo often did he view &amp; reuiew it, both within and without) by meanes of him who vſually kept it, who purpoſely came with the Ambaſſadours, curiouſly demonſtrating vnto Solyman the exquiſitnes thereof, and cauſed him to ſee the excellent workemanſhip that was with in it, and how wonderfull the worke was. Solyman after hee had ſufficiently peruſed this rare iewell, gaue audience to Nicholas and Sigiſmond. They demaunded Ferdinand demandeth to be inueſted King! of Hungarie by Solyman. that he would giue to Ferdinand, together with Buda, the kingdome of Hungarie, with the ſame charges and conditions, vpon which before he had agreed with Iohn, promiſing that the Emperour his brother, for his greater ſuretie, ſhould ſend Ambaſſadours to be compriſed in the ſame peace, and that he would yeeld to the conditions that ſhould be mentioned  therein, whereby he might more liberally and without ſuſpition, by force of armes, enlarge the limits of his Empire towards the Eaſt. And the rather to perſwade him vnto it, they declared to him, how Iohn acknowledging to poſſeſſe that kingdome vniuſtly, had in the time of his life, of his owne accord compacted with their Maſter, that after his death, it ſhould be rendered to him, allotting to his ſonne ſuch a reuenew as ſhould be conuenient to maintaine his eſtate, he knowing himſelfe to be choſen King, rather by the fauour of fortune, then by his owne demerits. Therefore they beſought Solyman to accept into that kingdome, rather their Maſter for his friend and Vaſſall, then for his neighbour and enemie, conſidering he was  alreadie created King of Bohemia, and elected by the Germanes King of the Romanes, and that he was by the Hungers themſelues, rather deſired to be their King then any other.
            
               Solyman hauing well vnderſtood their demaunds, and greatly commending their preſents, aunſwered them that within three dayes they ſhuld know further of his pleaſure. When two dayes were expired, he cauſed Roſtan Baſha to impart vnto them his whole intention, who tolde them, that Ferdinand ſhould render all the townes which had been in the poſſeſſion of King Lewis, which he did enioy, and that he ſhould vtterly renounce the kingdom of Hungarie; and that Solyman for the iniuries which he had receiued of  him (by reaſon whereof he was often forced to take armes) was content notwithſtanding to pardon him with a light penaltie; to wit, in paying tribute for the Countrie of Auſtria for the time to come. Vpon ſuch conditions, Roſtan ſaid that Solyman was content to entertaine peace and friendſhip with their Maſter, or elſe if he would not accept thereof, that then he would not ceaſe to make continuall warre vpon him, and would preſently ſend to deſtroy, and wholly to ruinate all the Countrie of Auſtria.
            The Ambaſſadours ſeeing they could not obtaine any thing worthie their comming, and that all theſe their proceedings would diſſolue into  winde, demaunded reſpite to anſwer this ſo vnworthie anſwer, ſo farre out of peaceable tearmes, and withall to ſend vnto Ferdinand; which was not granted to them. They thought verely that the Turkes in denying all that they demaunded, would eaſily notwithſtanding entertaine truce, conſidering that the winter approached, and that to auoyde the inconuenience thereof, he ſhould bee forced to take his iourney towards Conſtantinople.

But theſe Ambaſſadours made ſhew as though they vnderſtoode it not, and in ſtead of propounding other matters, they tooke occaſion to demaund  
               Balthaſar Taiſh, who was taken at the ouerthrow of Roccandolph, and put in chaines among other ſlaues. Roſtan anſwered them, that he ſhould be reſtored without any ranſome, when the premiſed conditions of peace ſhould be entertained; or if warre happened, that then occaſion would bee offered to exchange him for ſome of their owne. Thus they being excluded from all agreement, and depriued of all hope of concluding peace, they in this ſort returned to Ferdinand.
            
            Whileſt thoſe were in their way to Vienna, Solyman after he had fortified all the frontiers, diſlodged from Buda with his armie, taking the way towards Solyman returneth to Conſtantinople. 
                Conſtandinople, leauing within the towne of Buda a ſtrong garriſon, vnder the commaund of a Hungar named Solyman, who was turned Turke, and who for martiall affayres ſhould defend and gouerne the towne; appointing beſides for the executing of iuſtice (willing thereby to gratifie the Budians) Stephen Verbetz, whom they all knew to bee a man of ſincere life.
            As theſe affayres were diſpatched at Buda by Solyman, the Queene trauailed continually vntill ſhe approached neere vnto Tranſiluania, when ſhe was aduertiſed by all the principall of the kingdome, that they would not ſuffer her to enter thereinto, leaſt by the like deceit it ſhould happen to them,  as it fortuned to thoſe of Buda: whereupon ſhe was conſtrained after ſo long a iourney, to repoſe her ſelfe at Lippa, where being arriued with her ſonne, ſhe preſently ſent to ſeeke Frier George, that by the friendſhip and fauour of The Queene was receiued into Tranſiluania by the fauour of George. certaine of the chiefeſt, who were ſpecially affected to his part, and many other of his friends, ſhe might by their good liking enter peaceably into the kingdome. George, by the helpe of his friends, effected ſo much, that the Tranſiluanians were content to receiue her as their Queene, and vſe obedience to her ſonne, with no leſſe dutie, then if he had been Iohn his father, allowing him as their King, &amp; his mother as his gouerneſſe. Beſides, the Frier managed the affayres ſo well, that he was againe elected and confirmed by  the countrie, great Treaſure, and generall gouernour of that prouince: and within a while he returned to the Queene, who preſently after his arriuall, ceaſed not to iourney vntill ſhe came to Tranſiluania, leauing to Peter Vicchy the gouernment of the Countie of Lippa, and Themeſuar, in reſpect of the confidence ſhe repoſed in him, to the end that he receiuing ſo large a commaund of her, ſhe might haue more confidence that he would hold and defend it in her ſonnes name and to his vſe. But this gouernment did, together with the time, ſo puffe vp his heart with pride, that he durſt aduenture to poſſeſſe thoſe places as his owne inheritance, and not as things moueable, or depending vpon the Crowne of that kingdome; and yet notwithſtanding he did not this but by ſome ſecret conſent of the Queene. She being arriued  in this countrie, began now to take the rule and adminiſtration of the kingdome, in ſuch manner, that ſhe had onely but the name and title thereof, all the puiſſance and authoritie being in the hands of the Frier, who, vnder the colour of his eſtate of Treaſurerſhip, receiued into his cuſtodie all the reuenewes of the kingdome, and ſo little did he diſtribute and allow to the

Queene, that much adoe ſhe had wherewithall to ſuffice her owne wants. George vſeth the treaſure of the kingdome and beginneth to gouerne, and little reſpecteth the Queene. 
                And hee determining to rule all things, ayded himſelfe by all the ſuttleſt meanes, which he thought could any way profit him, to commaund ouer the mightieſt of the kingdome, endeuouring himſelfe in the beginning, by infinit curteſies, to draw all the gentlemen to his part, and make his faction great, who, after hee had wonne and intiſed them to his diſpoſe, then vſed them like ſlaues: and if it happened that they at any time complained thereof, preſently he excuſed and cleered himſelfe, ſaying, that it was not needfull to vſe ſuch curteſies and ceremonies with thoſe who were his familiar and kinde friends, but rather to ſuch who were not in any ſort bound to him by ſo ſtrict and faithfull a league. And if he had notice of any one who would  not be allured and wonne to his faction, but rather was enclined to the ſeruice of the Queene, he ſtraight purſued them with all violence euen vnto death. All this behauiour of the Friers was well knowne to the Queene, in regard whereof ſhe deeply maliced him: and although ſhe could hardly ſupport the griefe and diſcontent of ſuch a burdenſome yoke, yet neuertheleſſe ſhe endured all his arrogancie and peremptorie behauiour with incomparable patience, ſtill hoping that time (according to cuſtome) would remedie all: all Empires, eſtates, riches, honours, pouerties, glories, triumphs, and all proſperous and aduerſe things, being ſubiect continually to inconſtant alteration, and there being nothing vnder the concauitie and cope of  heauen, which continueth long in one and the ſame eſtate, but is forced within a ſhort time to chaunge the forme, habit, and colour, and which ſheweth not the inſtabilitie of humane actions to bee conformable to the naturall chaunge of her courſe.

            THE THIRD BOOKE OF THE HISTORIE OF HVNGARIE.
            
               THE ARGVMENT OF THE THIRD BOOKE.
               
                  THe Queene complaineth to Solyman of George; he ſeeketh the fauour and ayde of Ferdinand; of which the Queene hauing notice, aduertiſeth Solyman thereof; whoſe puiſſance George fearing, he retireth and fortifieth himſelfe in Saſſebaſſe, and the Queene leauieth forces againſt him. Solyman ſendeth a Chiauſs into Tranſiluania in fauour of the Queene: the Tranſiluanians forſake her, and incline to George, who accordeth with the Queene for feare of the Turkes power marching towards him; againſt whom George taketh armes, and forceth them to retire, and he ſtill vſeth the Queene after his accuſtomed manner: ſhe incenſeth the 
                   
                  Tranſiluanians againſt him: whereupon he vniteth himſelfe to Ferdinand, who maketh Iohn Baptiſta Caſtalde his Lieutenant, and ſendeth him into Hungarie. The Queene publiſheth a Diet, and George interrupteth and diſſolueth it. Caſtalde beſiegeth the Caſtle of Dalmas, which is yeelded to him. The Queene accordeth with George, and Albe-iula is yeelded to him. Many ſuſpitions paſſeth betweene Caſtalde and Frier George, and the Queene yeeldeth her ſelfe to Ferdinand: but George ſeeketh to fruſtrate that agreement, who in the end is made Vayuode of Tranſiluania, and created Cardinall. The Queene reſigneth all the royall ornaments to Caſtalde with the Crowne, which are ſent to Ferdinand, vnto 
                   
                  whom the Hungars ſweare homage. The Queene departeth out of Hungarie, and George ſeeketh againe the fauour of the Turkes, who lye in waite for the Queene trauailing to Caſſouia.
               
            
            
               QVeene Izabella ſeeing the affayres betweene her ſelfe and Frier George ſucceede from worſe to worſe; and alſo diligently obſeruing his bad and euil demeanour, which was more then her patience could digeſt or tolerate; and that notwithſtanding ſhee knew not any meanes how to withdraw him from his obſtinate wilfull courſe, being highly offended therewith: had no  other recourſe or helpe of redreſſe, but writ to the Turke, greatly complaining her ſelfe of the bad entreatie which he vſed towards The Queene complaineth of George to Solyman. her; deſiring him that ſince he was content to appoint and leaue her in poſſeſſion of that kingdome, that in like ſort he would vouchſafe to aſſiſt and ayde her out of ſuch a miſerable ſubiection, wherein ſhe was now fallen

into, ſpecially in ſuffering the cruell tyrannie of the Frier, which was more  burdenſome to her, then the iniurie of her profeſſed enemies; and if it were not ſpeedily preuented, it might in time bee the cauſe of ſome ſiniſter and ominous fortune: wherefore wholly relying vpon his fauour and clemencie, ſhe effectually prayed him to relieue her againſt ſo great a calamitie, whereby ſhe might quietly enioy the ſame peace, which many times he had promiſed her, with a faithfull and ſincere affection.
            
               Solyman vnderſtanding theſe complaints, made no other ſhew at that time for the redreſſe of them, but onely writ to the Frier, that he ſhould vſe the Queene as was fitting and anſwerable to her calling; and that ſo much the rather, for that ſhe was recommended to him: and if he did to the contrarie,  he would teach him how to behaue himſelf, yea it might be, he would make him an exāple to others, to take better heede for the like preſumption. Theſe letters, in ſtead of cauſing him to alter his peremptorie behauiour towards her, confirmed him the rather in a more malicious and obſtinate will then before. He now notwithſtanding ſeeing all his actions were diſcouered to the Turke, and that it was behoofull for him to liue more neere and priuate to himſelfe, determined (perceuering ſtill in his peremptorie reſolution to vſe the Queene after his accuſtomed manner) to aſſiſt himſelfe, by the fauour George ſeeketh againe the fauour of Ferdinand. of Ferdinand, who was alreadie crowned King of the Romanes, with an intention to be able by his meanes (at euery aſſay that might be offered)  to reſiſt and onely defend himſelfe againſt the Turke; and the rather being induced thereunto, through a continuall vexation which he receiued of Solyman, demaunding of him oftentimes (beſides the yeerely tribute which was payd him) ſometimes victuall, ſometime munition, and other extraordinarie ſubſidies which were infinit, by reaſon whereof, not being able to ſatisfie his greedy ambitious minde, the treaſure was in the end ſpent and conſumed, in ſo much that there remained little or nothing thereof; ſo that he to content his barbarous appetites, was conſtrained to impoſe vpon the kingdome new taxes, and tributes, whereby he procured the diſlike and hate of euery one. 
            
            In this time was Counte Nicholas Salm Lieutenant generall for Ferdinand 
               Nicholas Salm Lieutenant generall for Ferdinand in Hungarie. Tocchay. in Hungarie, who (as hath been ſaid) was ſent vpon an Ambaſſage to Solyman, to treate of a peace with him. Long before, Frier George deſired conference with him in the Caſtle of Tocchay, where King Iohn (as wee haue ſaid in the firſt booke) was ouerthrowne by Ferdinands Lieutenant, where (by the meanes of a riuer) Hungarie doth diuide it ſelfe from Tranſiluania. But there neuer falling out any oportunitie to ſee one another; one day (as they both deſired) it happened (they nothing thinking therof) but either of them minding to goe ſome other way, that they met in the middeſt of a way The conference between George and Counte Salm. comming from Hungarie to that place, the Frier continually ſoliciting the  Counte, that he might come to him and ſpeake with him for the Kings ſeruice; and hauing inſtantly vrged him thereto, the Counte would neuer ſeeme to hearken thereunto, as not repoſing much truſt in him, knowing that he was mutable, inconſtant, and a friend not much to bee truſted. Notwithſtanding, ſetting at that time before his eyes the great and often ſolicitation which he daily vſed, to cauſe him to come to parley; and ſeeing himſelfe

well accompanied with ſufficient bands of footmen, and troupes of Caualarie, refuſed not to hearken to the Frier: whereupon he went to lie at Tocchay  with George, who all the whole night continued together in priuate, with long conference concerning his purpoſe, ſaying, that hee had notice that Peter Vicchy, Gouernour of Lippa and Themeſuar, had intelligence with the Turke, and vnder colour to giue vp theſe countries (into which he had inueſted himſelfe, as if it had been into his owne inheritance) vnder the Crowne of King Iohns ſonne: and to comfort and ayde the Queene the more, he would wholly take away the care &amp; adminiſtration of the kingdom from him, and reduce it into extreame calamitie, and transferre it (as already he ſaw ſome likelihood thereof) vnder the gouernment of the Turke: which did not much diſpleaſe him for his owne particular, as for the great damage  which all Chriſtendome ſhould receiue thereby, this being manifeſt that Tranſiluania is the Port that giueth large enterance to annoy it, which being vnder the hands of ſo puiſſant an enemie, Ferdinand might then with griefe eaſily diſcerne what preparation and meane this would bee, to enter into his countrie of Auſtria and Germanie, which he could by no meanes hinder: conſidering the weakenes of his forces, and his brother the Emperour Charles greatly incombred by the diſſentions of Germanie, in regard whereof, he could by no meanes ſend ſuch ſuccour as was needfull for him; and that for his part he ſaw him alreadie to be old and ſickly, and without meanes to defend this countrie, againſt the mightie puiſſance of ſuch an enemy, who  not onely by force, but alſo by deceit and ſubtiltie would not ceaſe, vntill he had reduced it vnder his gouernment: And that vpon this occaſion, before he would ſee ſuch an indignitie, and receiue ſo great a loſſe, and eſpecially not being able, by reaſon of the great bonds wherein he was obliged to King Iohn, to doe otherwiſe then procure that this kingdome might remaine free and peaceable to his ſonne Stephen, hee had aduiſed and determined with himſelfe, to haue recourſe to the maieſtie and princely regalitie of Ferdinand, deſiring his helpe to fruſtrate &amp; diſſolue ſuch enterpriſes, importuning the Counte to recite amply this waightie matter to him, praying him hee  would not faile to fauour a deede ſo holy and iuſt: the iſſue whereof would not onely bee profitable to the ſeruice of God, and to the good of all Chriſtendome, but alſo a ſpeciall profit and commoditie to his Maieſtie, in whoſe royall fauour he offered to doe him all poſſible ſeruice, to the end that that which hee alreadie had negotiated with the Queene, might take effect, to wit, in perſwading her to relinquiſh that State, according to that which King Iohn had by his laſt will and Teſtament decreed; excuſing and acquiting himſelfe by ſuch like offers, of al diſlikes which before had paſſed, promiſing to doe him faithfull ſeruice in time to come, and to obſerue and entertaine inuiolably, whatſoeuer it would pleaſe his Maieſtie to commaund  him.
            Counte Salms made him anſwer, that he would very willingly vndertake to aduertiſe Ferdinand of all which had paſſed betweene them two. And to animate and confirme him the more in this his good purpoſe, he promiſed him to performe it, both by word and deede, aſſuring him that Ferdinand would not faile but condiſcend to all that which he had demaunded: neuertheleſſe

with this condition, that he ſhould ſtill perſeuer in his faith and promiſe,  and effectually obſerue all which he had promiſed him. With this concluſion they both departed, the Frier taking his iourney towards Tranſiluania, and the Counte towards Vienna, to impart vnto Ferdinand the whole diſcourſe which had paſſed betweene them.
            This conference was not ſo priuate, but the Queene had preſent notice thereof: and well knowing that the Frier ſounded all the meanes to doe her the greateſt miſchiefe and ſpite he could, ſhe vnderſtood that he ſecretly practiſed to accompliſh fully his thoughts, and put her to all trauaile and paine, which hee thought good and meete to chaſe her out of her kingdome: ſhe well knowing that for this end, and not to doe him ſeruice, nor for any other occaſion, then that which he falſely and wickedly pretended,  practiſed to ioyne with Ferdinand, and take part with him: and knowing her ſelfe to be a Queene of weake force, and a woman without the ayde of any Chriſtian Prince, and euen of Ferdinand himſelfe, by the friendſhip and fauour of whom ſhe hoped to preuaile in her neceſſities, being depriued therof by the ſubtilties and crafts of the Frier; ſhe was conſtrained that ſhe might not behold a man (to whom ſhe wiſhed ſo much ill) to triumph ouer her and her ſonne; rather to ſerue her preſent neede with the promiſe and offer of the Turke, eſteeming it better for her to endure all that which ſhould happen to her, by the violence of this great diſaſter, then the euill (although it would proue but little) which might betide her by the Friers wicked policies  and practiſes. Vpon this reſolution, ſhe preſently diſpatched Iohn Solanze (a man of good eſteeme, and greatly renowned in thoſe countries, The Queene ſent to Solyman, aduertiſing him of the Friers practiſes. and who was very much deuoted to her) to goe to Conſtantinople, and acquaint Solyman with the practiſes that Frier George wrought againſt her. He trauailing with good expedition, arriued in ſhort time before the Turke, to whom he imparted all the effect of his Ambaſſage. Solyman, who by his owne people had beene alreadie aduertiſed of all the affayres which were done in Tranſiluania, and namely of the Friers proceedings, was at this new information, prouoked and incenſed the more, and ſent preſently one of his Chiauſes to the Baſha of Buda, with expreſſe commaund that he ſhould  either take the Frier aliue or dead; he alſo writing to the Tranſiluanians, that they ſhould fauour and aſſiſt his Chiauſs in all things which he might neede from them: and charged him that if he did ſee that they could not execute that which he would, that then he ſhould ſhew them other Letters Patents, by which he depriued the Frier of all his degree, dignitie, and ſtate, and commanded them all no longer to obey him, but to oppoſe themſelues againſt him, and according to the manner of that countrie, that they ſhould endeuour to kill him as a traytor, and theefe, and if any refuſed to execute this commaund, he ſhould threaten them all with death, and ruinate and  quite ſubuert the whole countrie. He writ in like ſort to the Vayuodes of Moldauia, and Tranſalpina, and to the Baſha of Buda, that as often as the Queene required them, they ſhould preſently take armes and ayde her againſt the Frier, with the greateſt force they could.
            The Chiauſs was ſcarcely departed from Conſtantinople, and theſe commaunds diſpatched by Solyman, but Frier George had preſently ſecret and particular

notice thereof by many his friends. Vpon which occaſion, being well aduiſed, he retired himſelfe from the Queenes Court, to a towne of  good ſtrength called Saſſebeſſe, which he preſently cauſed to be well victualled George retireth and fortifieth himſelfe with Saſſebeſſe. and fortified, putting therein a good ſtrong garriſon, clenſing and deepning the ditches, heightning the rampiers, repayring the wals where they were decayed, and furniſhing it with Artillerie, ſufficiently to ſuſtaine the brunt of a ſiege; &amp; in the meane while, he forgot not by the beſt meanes that he could deuiſe, and particularly by good words, to cleere himſelfe to the Turke. During this time, whileſt hee was carefull with expedition to effect this matter, yet neuertheleſſe (as being very vigilant) he omitted not to practiſe on the other ſide what was fitting for him, that he might not be ſurpriſed. Therefore he called together all his friends, and eſpecially the Sicilians  (who are the warlikeſt people in that kingdome) and from amongſt them he tooke into his pay 4000. firſt cauſing them to ſweare that they ſhould bee faithfull to him. By theſe and others, he ſo encreaſed his forces, that he began to be feared neere and farre off.
            The Queene vnderſtanding of all theſe preparations, and certainly knowing, by ſuch intelligence as was brought her, that the Frier made full account to poſſeſſe all, and that then for the preſent ſhe had no other meanes but take him by force, and fearing withall that ſhe ſhould bee chaſed out of her kingdome, before any ſuccours could come to her ayde; writ with all ſpeede to the Baſha of Buda, and to the two Vayuodes, that according vnto the ordinance  which they had receiued from the grand Seigniour, they ſhould ſend The Queene gathereth forces againſt George. her preſent ayde, ſhe ſpeedily aduertiſing them in what eſtate the Friers affayres were. They not omitting any time, cauſed their people to be in a readines, and in the meane time, while they were in comming, the Queene leauied 7000. men, and ſent them to beſiege the Caſtles of Brancich and Vincky, which Frier George had built from the ground, vpon the riuer ſide of Maroſſe.
            
               Peter Vicchy vnderſtanding of all that paſſed, as well on the Queenes part, as on the Friers, aſſembled as many men as he could in his gouernment of Lippa and Themeſuar, and through his perſwaſions drew to his partie Serpietre 
                
               Vicchy, who was a Ratian, and one of the greateſt of his country, &amp; who before time expected to haue been King: he brought with him 8000. Ratians, and ioyned himſelfe and his forces with Peter Vicchy, and they went to Peter Vicchy beſiegeth Senath. beſiege the Caſtle of Senath, which was belonging to ye Biſhop of Varadine, ſituated in the lower Tranſiluania, which was kept for the Frier, Biſhop of Varadine, by Iaſper Peruſicchy a Captaine of his, who failed not valiantly to defend it, vntill he was relieued by Thomas Varcocce, although Serpietre vſed all his skill to winne it by batterie. This man being particularly certified of the eſtate and manner of this ſiege, was ſent with all expedition by the Frier  into the Biſhopricke of Varadine, to make a preſent, leauie of as many perſons as could bee found able to beare armes, to relieue Senath. Varcocce hauing diligently ordered all things, and hauing gathered a ſufficient number of foote and horſe, as well hirelings, as others bound to performe that ſeruice, and ſeeing himſelfe no leſſe gallant and forward to fight, then his emies, as a valiant and prudent Captaine, that would not through his negligence

let paſſe any fauourable occaſion of fortune, after a thouſand deliberations, and as many premeditations, reſolued vpon the ſudden to ſet vpon  the Ratians in many places, and by the vertue and dexteritie of himſelfe, and fauour of the aſſieged, to make a direct and quicke diſpatch to the victorie. Vpon this reſolution, he ſent in the night certaine Spies, diligently to view and conſider the order and martialing of his enemies Campe, the guards, watch, and number, and in concluſion their qualitie and condition, whether they were hirelings, or of the number of thoſe who were to performe ſuch a dutie, and whether they were more of foote or horſe, and in what place, and how they were lodged, to the end, that as occaſion ſerued, he might more commodiouſly fight with them, without preiudice of his owne people. Theſe Spies in the night entering into the Campe of the Ratians, perceiued Thomas Varcocce defeated the armie of Vicchy. 
                nothing elſe amongſt them but diſorder, and that aboue all very great careleſnes, in ſo much that they were of preſent opinion, that Varcocce might with great facilitie ouerthrow and defeate them. They hauing with good vigilancie ſuruaied this drowſie leager, returned againe to Varcocce, acquainting him with all that they had ſeene and knowne. This increaſed his courage, and redoubled his deſire to giue them battaile: and in the meane time giuing notice to thoſe of Senath, of that which he determined to doe, martialed his ſquadrons in three parts; placing in the firſt good ſtore of Caualarie, with many Infantrie; and in the other (which was towards a little hill) making a left wing thereof, he placed the reſt of his Infantrie, which were flanked with  a good troupe of horſe, to the end, that as the firſt ſquadron ſhould charge vpon the flankes of the enemie, this ſhould ſpread it ſelfe in forme of a Creſſant, and with one of the hornes thereof to beare in vpon the taile of the enemie, and with the other to force the left flanke; and as for himſelfe, with the beſt horſe and foote he had, was placed in the middeſt, and purpoſed to aſſaile the enemie before. Diſpoſing of his people in this manner, one morning two houres before day, he marched with ſo great ſilence, that his arriuall was ſooner felt, then they had any inckling of his comming, and arriued euen by day breake among the Ratians, who thought themſelues ſecure, and charged them at one inſtant in three ſundrie places, with ſuch courage  and furie, and with ſo great a noyſe of Trumpets, Drummes, Phifes, and cryes, that it ſeemed the world would haue turned topſie turuie. The Ratians ſeeing themſelues (contrary to their expectation) to be aſſailed in three places, and furiouſly charged, they could not ſo ſoone, as neceſſitie required, put themſelues in battaile for their defence, but began wholly to bee diſcomforted, and ſought their priuate ſafetie by an ignominious flight, which they bought deere at Varcocces hand, who thereupon made a great butcherie and ſlaughter of them, purſuing them euen to their homes, and ranging the countrie as victorious, and in his retraict led with him 4000. priſoners, with great and rich ſpoyles of his enemies, of whom he put to the ſword  2500. Hauing by this ouerthrow reduced the countrie to his true and ancient obedience; and hauing aſſured it from the aſſaults of warre, and infranchiſed this Caſtle from ſuch an extremitie, he victoriouſly returned to Varadine.
            
               Nicholas Serpietre, chiefe leader of theſe Ratians, eſcaping halfe naked

from this tempeſt, retired himſelfe ſafe and ſound into a Caſtle of his owne,  where his wife was remaining, to whom (almoſt with teares) he ſorrowfully recounted all the ſucceſſe of his diſgrace, vnfortunately happened to him, imputing to fortune the loſſe of his people, which indeede happened by his euill and negligent gouernment. His wife hearing this diſcourſe, in ſtead of condoling and comforting his hard diſaſter, began, not as a woman, but as a man of courage, reſolute to vpbraide and reprehend his womaniſh ſpirit: ſaying to him, that he ſhould for ſhame returne, and recouer the honour of The marueilous courage of a Ratian wife. his blood and houſe, which chieſly he had loſt, otherwiſe, that ſhe would neuer conſent to bee called the wife of him, that was worſe then the baſeſt and cowardlieſt woman whoſoeuer, and that he deſerued not to haue an  heire of his linage, ſince ſo baſely he ſhewed himſelfe in ſuch an act. The husband would willingly haue replied and alleadged ſome excuſe for himſelfe, whereupon ſhe more inflamed with ire then before, added preſently: I would to God (ſaid ſhe) that thou hadſt rather beene brought to me in a thouſand peeces, if thou hadſt dyed in glorie and renowne, rather then to liue in health, as I now behold thee, bringing with thee nought but diſhonor and ignomie: knowing well that thou neuer tookeſt this reproachfull example of thy forefathers, who neuer yet fell into ſuch vnſeemely cowardlines, whereinto thy ſelfe art now deeply plunged. And who of our time is he, that by ſo baſe &amp; vile a courage hath committed ſo foule and enormious a fault? and who hath euer left vnto his heires ſo great and infamous an outrage,  without being reuenged, as they ſelfe? Doeſt thou not thinke that it would rather haue reioyced and contented me, if thou hadſt with thine owne hands ſlaine our enemies, and that my ſelfe, euen with my mouth might haue ſucked their blood, then to ſee them ſo cruelly murthering ours, and to ſucke the blood of mine? And neuertheleſſe, thou leauing all thine dead in the place, dareſt now preſume to come crying before me as a little girle, euen as ſound and whole as when thou didſt depart from thy houſe. Auoyde infamous man, and cauſe that mine eyes doe neuer behold thee, for they ſhall haue as great ſhame to ſee thee to bee my husband, as my ſelfe to  behold my ſelfe to bee thy wife, ſince the condition and noblenes of my blood abhorreth the indignitie of thy perſon, whom (if it had pleaſed God) I would in regard of ſo ſhameles a fact, I had neuer knowne thee, and ſo I would eſteeme my ſelfe more proud and ioyfull, then now I am, and in ſtead of life, I ſhould not bee ſo vrged, as now I am, to deſire death. She hauing ended theſe words, inflamed with ire and great indignation, departed from him, being many daies and moneths before ſhe would once vouchſafe to ſee him againe.
            Whileſt fortune in this ſort fauoured the affayres of Varcocce, the Frier went to Megeſt, not in reſpect he miſdoubted the ſtrength of Saſſebeſſe, but onely to be more neere vnto the Sicilians, vpon whoſe forces he greatly repoſed  himſelfe, there being the principall of the kingdome ranged on the The Chiauſs of Solyman in fauour of the Queene threatneth the Tranſiluanians. Queenes part, to whō they were very fauourable, vntill the Chiauſs (of whō we haue before ſpoken) being without hope any longer to delude the Frier, or obtaine him by any ſtratagem, did diuulge to them the Turkes commaund, telling them, that if all of them did not preſently take armes againſt

the Frier, he would procure the Baſha of Buda, and the two Vayuodes of  Moldauia and Tranſalpina, to chaſtice and handle them, as the deſerts of diſobedient perſons merited, deſtroying all their townes, and ruinating the whole countrie, as they were wont to doe. But theſe threatnings little profited the Queene, but to the contrarie, ſo incenſed the hearts of thoſe who were adhearing to her part to ſuccour her, that ſeeing the Turke began to take vpon him to ayde her, they wholly diſmiſſed themſelues from her ſeruice, in reſpect of the naturall hate which they bore to the Turkes. Vpon this occaſion the Frier omitted no oportunitie, but thereby did the better The Tranſiluanians forſake the Queene. ſhadow his ambitious proceedings, imparting to thoſe Lords, that if they any longer fauoured the Queenes part, they might be well aſſured, that it  would be the manifeſt ruine and vtter ſubuerſion of their countrie, ſeeing it was apparant, that vnder the colour of ayde, ſhe endeuoured to bring the Turkes in among them, who once knowing the Fortreſſes and difficult paſſages, the condition and fertilnes of the countrie, and prying by all deuiſes into their commodities, and their other actions, they might within ſhort time finde the meanes to patronize themſelues of all Tranſiluania, euen as by the like facts they tyrannouſly haue made themſelues maſters of all Greece.
            By theſe and ſuch like perſwaſions, the Lords were drawne vnto his faction, abſolutely leauing the Queene, and they amaſſed and vnited themſelues  with the Frier, that within few daies he aſſembled a good armie, and incamped before Albe-iula, where for the moſt part the Queene made her George incamped before Albeiula. abode, with ſuch few men as ſhe had of the countrie, the chiefe and Captaine generall of whom was Peter Vicchy. Both parties being thus certaine daies without performing any memorable act, the one againſt the other, the Sicilians began to mutinie; ſaying, they would returne home againe, and that they would no longer remaine in that place againſt the Queene. The Frier not knowing the cauſe of this mutinie, armed himſelfe with his Curaſſe, and being well mounted, went into the middeſt of the mutiners, who vnderſtanding the cauſe that did thus moue them to this tumult, anſwered them in this ſort; that they ſhould not bee aſtoniſhed at ſo great  a delay, the which was not done without ſpeciall aduice and benefit to the whole countrie, and that thereof, there ſhould proceede great good and quiet to euery one, for that now in the meane time an agreement was laboured betweene himſelfe and the Queene, which was almoſt well brought to paſſe. And for that cauſe he prayed them a while to haue patience, not doubting but this buſines would effect to good end, and that afterward they ſhould returne with great content and quiet. By ſuch and many other ſweete perſwaſions (which he well knew at pleaſure how to vſe both in time and place) he appeaſed all this tumult, yet not without great trauaile and labour. But ſeeing it was no eaſie matter for him to entertaine  them with words, but that he muſt in the end conclude by deedes, for that theſe diſſentions were like to continue long, and end by warre and battaile, (which the Sicilians by no meanes would endure) he began (knowing it greatly imported him, in reſpect the Baſha of Buda, the Moldauian, and the Tranſalpinian were comming againſt him with three armies) diligently

to ſeeke an agreement betweene himſelfe and the Queene, who alſo was The agreement between the Queene and George. greatly inclined to peace, (for that ſhe doubted no ayde would come from  the Turke) and ſhe preſently accepted of the conditions which the Frier offered her; and the rather, in regard ſhe was disfurniſhed of neceſſaries for the maintenance of warre, as of men, money, fauour, and forſaken (as ſhe thought) of the Turke, in whom ſhe repoſed but little truſt. And being a ſole woman, not hauing any whom ſhe might aſſure her ſelfe to relie vpon, ſhe thought that the continuance of this peace would be very momentarie; notwithſtanding of two euils ſhe determined to chuſe the leaſt, and the rather accepted of this agreement which was concluded betweene them; and both willingly diſmiſſed all their forces. 
            
            Whileſt Frier George and the Queene were in tearmes of reconciliation, the Baſha of Buda on the one part, and the two Vayuodes on the other, being carefully ſolicited by the Queene, were alreadie in their way, whileſt theſe broyles were in motion, and euery one of them brought a ſufficient armie to relieue her: and although ſhe was aduertiſed thereof, yet in ſtead of comming forward, ſhe writ vnto them that they ſhould retire, becauſe the Frier and her ſelfe were now accorded and in tearmes of agreement, and that their comming would bee little profit or commoditie to her. But neither the one nor the other would hearken thereunto, for that they determined among themſelues, before their retraict, to enter into Tranſiluania. The Queene imagining nothing leſſe, then of the euill which might enſue of  their proceeding forward, and fearing that it would happen to her, during the peace, which had not chanced to her during the time of warre, to wit, to bee abſolutely depriued of her kingdome; ſent with all expedition to the Frier, to informe him, that he ſhould vſe ſome preſent meanes to preuent this inconuenience, and to endeuour himſelfe with all expedition, that theſe forces might returne into their countries, and that ſhe might not neede to ſend them any preſents, whereby they would the willinger retire. The Frier little reſpecting her requeſt, did not greatly buſie himſelfe about it, but anſwered The arrogan cie of the Frier coldly, that they ſhould cauſe them to returne, who were the cauſe of their comming: and as for preſents, he was not accuſtomed to ſend any to  the Turkes, but onely to Chriſtians. And although he made ſo ſeuere and obſtinate an anſwere to the Queene to vexe her the more, (ſhewing his peruerſe nature) yet neuertheleſſe did he not omit, although it was in vaine, to attempt that which the Queene had commaunded him. But neither the Baſha, nor the Vayuodes made no great account of his words nor gifts, but ſtill came marching on, deſirous with their armies to enuiron and ſubdue the kingdome. Vpon ſuch obſtinacie of theirs, Frier George ſeeing it was not George taketh armes againſt the Turkes. behoouefull for him to omit any time, preſently leauied his people at Torde and Egneth, which are two great townes of Tranſiluania, and inſtantly thervpon  gaue commaund to all the prouinces of the countrie, that euery one ſhould betake himſelfe to armes, for the common good and defence of the countrie, for that the Baſha of Buda, the Moldauian, &amp; the Tranſalpinian, would euery one enter vpon that ſide next adioynant to him, and ſpoile and ruinate the countrie. He ſo diligently applied this buſines, that within few daies he had gathered together 50000. men, with whō he went to Saſſebeſſe,

that from thence he might march againſt the Baſha of Buda, of whom (by  reaſon he was a good ſouldiour, and experimented in the warre, although he had fewer men) he had more dread then of both the other, who were not reputed to be ſo expert ſouldiours. This Baſha arriued with his Campe almoſt at Deua, a Caſtle of good ſtrength, ſituated vpon the riuer of Maroſſe, which Deua. is one of the principalleſt riuers of that countrie. When the Frier diſlodging from Saſſebeſſe &amp; began to march againſt him, he diſpatched vpon the way Iohn Chendy (a man of good regarde, and of a noble houſe among the Hungars) with a good troupe of horſe and foote againſt the Tranſalpinian, Chendy, Lieutenant of George, defeareth the Tranſalpinians. to defend and ſtop the paſſages, whereby he muſt of neceſſitie paſſe, if hee would enter into Tranſiluania, and alſo to hinder him that he ſhould not  ioyne with the Baſha. Chendy diligently proceeding on his iourney, and gathering together of the next townes (beſides the number which he brought with him) almoſt 4000. men, arriued priuately with them, hard adioyning to the enemie, where they were (as they thought) ſecurely incamped without any feare: and being aſſured by certaine Spies, what forme and order they held, he appointed his companies to bee ſtretched forth at large, and ſo gallant was the ſhew, that they appeared to bee infinit; and about day breaking, he began to aſſaile the Tranſalpinians with great noyſe of Trumpets and Drummes, that with the number of men, whereof they were greatly afeard, and the long troupes of their enemies which deſcended from certaine hils, ranging themſelues in battaile, they ſeemed thrice as great as they were, they  verely thinking the Frier had been there in perſon with his whole armie: whereupon their hearts preſently fainted, and they by no meanes would attend the iſſue of the battaile, but disbanding themſelues they began to flye, and with ſuch diſorder, that Chendies ſouldiours taking courage and following the victorie, purſued them ſo nigh, that in this confuſion of ſlight, they killed more then 5000. and tooke as many priſoners, bringing with them from their chaſe 3000. horſe, and many Enſignes. By this victorie, Chendy ſo terrified the Tranſalpinian, that flying from this ouerthrow, through the cowardlines of his people, he druſt not in a lōg time after take armes againſt the Tranſiluanians. The enemie being thus chaſed on this ſide the countrie,  he incontinently returned backe to Frier George, inriched with many priſoners, and ſo great ſpoyle, as it was a woonder to ſee. The Frier after he had diſpatched Chendy againſt the Tranſalpinian, at the ſame inſtant commaunded the Sicilians, with all expedition they ſhould repayre to defend their moſt important townes, which they thought the Moldauian would aſſaile; that they ſhould fortifie the paſſages, which naturally by the fauour of the ſteepy mountaines, were very inacceſſible, and ſuch that they might well defend with few men. The Sicilians, who naturally are ancient enemies to The Sicilians and Saxons naturall enemies. the Saxons, being continually catching the one from the other, ſeeing they muſt paſſe by Saſſebeſſe, a principall towne of the ſaid Saxons, and from  thence with violence to proceede through their countrie, leauing that honeſt regard which they ought to haue had, for the defence of their countrie, they proceeded on to a reuenge, in ſuch ſort, that as ſoone as they arriued at Robet, they began to ranſacke all the houſes which belonged to the Saxons, burning and ruinating the townes they paſſed by, inſomuch that they did

not a little waſte and endamage that people, carrying with them all the bootie which they got. 
            
            Whileſt they were thus occupied in ſuch enormious cruelties, they gaue leiſure to the Moldauian to enter into their countrie, and without any impediment, to ruinate and pill their townes, and in deſtroying and burning all their villages, to turne all topſie turuie, which thing (to ſay trueth) was iuſtly permitted of God, to the end, that in reaſon they might endure from their enemies the ſame calamities and miſeries, which ſo vniuſtly they had cauſed thoſe to ſuffer, who in conſideration of common ſafetie, ought then at the leaſt to haue been reputed their friends. Whileſt the Sicilians and Moldauians practiſed theſe cruell exploites, Frier George with tedious  iourneys aduanced his Campe againſt the Baſha of Buda, hauing ſent before Thomas Varcocce into the County of Varadine, to gather what force he could, as well Infantrie as horſe, with intent, that if the Baſha would perhaps attempt to paſſe the riuer of Maroſſe, being receiued at the halfe paſſage, he ſhould aſſaile and fight with him before and behinde, or elſe that hee ſhould bee forced to retire halfe broken and ouerthrowne. But the Baſha alſo diſtruſting The retraict of the Baſha of Buda. the ſame, and being aduertiſed that the Frier came in perſon to fight with him; and fearing that if he proceeded any further, he imagined he might be (as he well conſidered thereof) ſurpriſed in the middeſt, and charged in the rereward, by the companies that were vnder the conduct of Varcocce, aſſuring himſefe that he was deceiued by the Queene: whereupon  in the greateſt haſte he could, paſſing a little arme of Maroſſe, he retired, and iournied as farre in one day, as he marched before in ſixe, and went againe to Buda, not without the loſſe of 300. horſe, who were defeated by Turchy Iohn, the which before his Vauntgard diſlodged, he had ſent into the countrie Turchy Iohn. of Deue, to range as well for victuals, as alſo to diſcouer if there were no ambuſhments to hinder or annoy his retraict. This Turchy was ſent by the Frier to preuent him of the paſſage, and to annoy him in his rereward: but the quicknes of the Baſha cauſed that hee arriued too late, and tooke away from him all occaſion of being able to ioyne with Varcocce, much leſſe to  endamage his rereward, which might eaſily haue been broken and defeated, if theſe two had been vnited.
            The Frier being now aſſured by theſe two, that the Baſha was retired in the greateſt expedition he could, turned his Campe againſt the Moldauian, who (as we haue ſaid) ſpoyled and burned the countrie and townes of the Sicilians, and went forward with a vehement reſolution, cruelly to bee reuenged of the iniurie, which he eſteemed more intolerable, then any that euer he receiued. But the Moldauian hauing notice of the Friers intent, and knowing beſides what had happened to the Tranſalpinian, found it good The retraict of the Moldauian. by the aduice of his Councell, not to attend his comming: whereupon, after great ſpoyle made in the countrie, he ſpeedily retired himſelfe with his  people, as well horſe as foote, who were about 30000. leading with them a great bootie of moueables, and beaſts, with more then a thouſand priſoners, who were taken by a Chiauſs of the Turkes, that, in reſpect of the loue and kindnes he bore to him, came thither with certaine troupes of Turkiſh Caualarie.
            
               
After that Frier George had thus chaſed all the enemies out of Tranſiluania, he retired towards the Queene, where with conſent of all, in reſpect of  his valour and proweſſe (which vndoubtedly was very great) the peace was The peace confirmed betweene the Queene and George. againe confirmed betweene them two, with ſuch conditions which ſhould like them both: among which he importuned, that the Queene would write to the Turke, and acquite and cleere him of all ſuch matters, whereof before he had been accuſed. Which requeſt, though it was contrarie to her diſpoſition (for women like not to countermaund their owne proceedings) yet notwithſtanding ſhe preſently did it. But the Turke being well informed of the veritie of the cauſe, and of all that which paſſed; and withall ſeeing how mightie and puiſſant the Frier was, and that the greateſt part of the kingdome was fauourably addicted to his part; he ſmoothly diſſembling  the matter, reſerued the chaſticement thereof, vntill better oportunitie, and made ſhew to the Frier as though he held himſelfe ſatisfied with his fidelitie, and that he very well knew, he of his part was not faultie in any of the late broyles. Whereupon hee ſent another Chiauſs with Letters Patents Solyman ſendeth to the Tranſiluanians that they ſhould obey George. directed to all the kingdome, by which he commaunded that euery one ſhould obey and reuerence him, as being againe confirmed in all his former honours and degrees. But yet the peace laſted not long, for the Queene in the end ſeeing the Frier reſpected not any thing which he had promiſed by the laſt agreement, omitted no time, but by the occaſion of his abſence, (being then in his Biſhopricke of Varadine to recreate and ſolace himſelfe)  ſhe began priuately and vnder hand to raiſe and incenſe the greateſt Lords of the kindome, with intent to aſſiſt her, to chaſe the Frier out of that prouince, The Queene incenſeth the Tranſiluanians againſt George. and eſpecially thoſe whom ſhe reputed moſt faithfull and affectionate to her, and moſt oppoſite againſt the Friers proceedings, manifeſting to them how his naturall diſpoſition was inconſtant and cruell, and how he vſed her badly, not willing to keepe nor obſerue any lawes, couenants, promiſes, nor faith, but aſpiring to the vniuerſall tyrannie of that countrie, he did thus wickedly demeane and behaue himſelfe towards her, with this intent to chaſe both her and her ſonne out of the kingdome, and to remaine ſole and abſolute Lord himſelfe; aſſuring her ſelfe, that for the loue and fidelitie  which they in former time vſed to King Iohn her husband, and alwaies maintained the ſame (notwithſtanding all ſiniſter fortune) in the behalfe of Stephen her ſonne and her ſelfe; in regard whereof they would neuer endure this iniurie, nor tolerate ſuch a crueltie farre ſurmounting all other practiſed againſt her perſon, in falling from ſo high and eminent dignitie of a Queene, to become an ordinarie and poore Ladie, and their King of Tranſiluania to become a ſeruant: eſteeming it of greater moment, that they ſhould rather deſire to haue the ſonne of him and their naturall Prince, for their Lord and Patrone, then a Frier voyde of all faith and honeſtie, and onely gorged with ambition. 
            
            By ſuch like demonſtrations, ſhe ſo awakened the ſpirits of euery one, that all in generall (not willing to ſubmit themſelues to any other Lord, then to King Stephen and her ſelfe) concluded to take armes againſt the Frier, with intent to expell him the kingdome. George hauing notice of this, and of all their other proceedings which was practiſed againſt him, and ſeeing himſelfe

weakened of men, and depriued of ſuch forces, which were neceſſarie to reſiſt the ſcourges and aſſaults of ſuch vnlooked for fortune; after he hauing  long pondered vpon theſe affayres, determined vpon this reſolution, to George agreeth and vnited himſelfe with Ferdinand. accorde and linke himſelfe with Ferdinand, and to conclude with him the practiſes, which oftentimes without effecting, he before had acquainted him with, he being induced and in a manner conſtrained thereunto by his extreame ambition and troubleſome minde (the enemie of quiet repoſe) it being tolde him, that if by that meanes he could expell the Queene, he might eaſily compaſſe his intention; which was, to ſee himſelfe abſolute Lord of Tranſiluania, which he ſo much eſteemed, that he would often ſay, he cared neither to be Pope nor Emperour, and that he would neuer goe out of it. By  theſe deuiſes one might manifeſtly diſcerne the inſatiable deſire of his ambitious nature, which tended to no other end, then to the ſole gouernment of this kingdome.
            Now, Counte Salm being dead (with whom hee had alreadie begun to treate of this affayre) and knowing not how to effect his determination, finding himſelf now neerely driuen, reſolued to negotiate this buſines by Ambaſſadours, ſending ſecretly to Ferdinand one of his gentlemen, by whom he gaue him to vnderſtand, that he greatly deſired that either one way or other, they would put in practiſe that which he before time had giuen him notice of by Counte Salm, inſtantly praying him againe, that he would not faile to  ſend ſpeedie ſuccours, and that it would pleaſe him to commit this charge to ſuch a one, that was ſufficient and able to withſtand the Queene, who had againe begun to bandie againſt him. And further he ſhewed him, that if he did not allow &amp; ratifie of his former motions, he ſhould in ſhort time ſee all Tranſiluania vnder the Turks gouernment: alſo willing him, that in the meane while he would ſend ſuch a man as might bee capable, and haue authoritie to manage ſuch affayres, becauſe it might ſo fall out, that that which he had often deſired might be effected; to wit, that Queene Izabella ſhould wholly and intirely yeeld to him the poſſeſſion of that kingdome: but with this condition, to obſerue ſuch couenants as he had before offered, and concluded  with King Iohn: which if he did execute and performe, then he did not onely promiſe, but alſo liberally offer (giuing him quiet poſſeſſion of all the places and Fortreſſes which were in his gouernment) to vſe ſuch meanes, that he ſhould be thereof abſolute Lord and King: and ſwearing not to faile him in this, he greatly importuned him that he ſhould quickly reſolue.
            Now Ferdinand (although he knew well the mutabilitie of the Friers diſpoſition, and that he might not repoſe any great credence in his words) well remembring how many times before he had cunningly deceiued him: and that he apparantly ſaw that he was not moued to doe him ſo good a deede for that purpoſe which he propounded vnto him, but only for his owne priuate intereſt and commoditie, and that hee might mount to the top of that,  which he alreadie had imprinted in his circumuenting braine, and execute his deſeignes: neuertheleſſe, ſeeing on the other ſide if he did not take hold and credit his words, hee ſhould let him ſlide out of his hands, in reſpect whereof he would by no meanes contradict him, eſpecially holding it alwaies for a thing commendable in himſelfe, not to bee reproached nor blamed

of any, for not doing his vttermoſt abilitie, which belonged to a true  and Chriſtian King, to hinder and withſtand that the kingdome ſhould not come vnder the Turks gouernment, and that they ſhould not report of him, that by his fault or negligence, he ſhould leaue the ports open to Infidels, and bring into ſeruitude, not only Auſtria and the reſt of Hungarie, but alſo ruinate and burne Germanie, with other Prouinces.
            Thus vpon theſe conſiderations he tooke vpon him the charge of this honourable and godly enterpriſe, and reſpecting not the inconſtancie of Frier George, but the trauaile and perill which might circumuent him, if he deferred time, preſently ſent to the Frier 1000. Hungariſh horſe, payed for foure Ferdinand ſendeth ayde to George. moneths, and certaine peeces of Artillerie, to maintaine and defend himſelf,  vntill he might ſend him ſuch a man with a puiſſant armie as he demanded, aſſuring him that there ſhould bee no fault nor want of any thing, which before he had promiſed and offered, willing him to perſeuer in his good opinion which he had manifeſted to the world.
            Behold now the ſtate wherein this poore and miſerable Tranſiluania was, which (as a man may plainly perceiue from the death of King Lewis, vntill now) was tormented with ſo many diſcords, ciuill warres, and aſſaults, that it was ruthfull for any Chriſtian to behold, ſeeing of the one ſide the Turke, and on the other ſide Ferdinand, and the Lords themſelues of the countrie (bandying themſelues with one, and then againſt the other) continually practiſed al manner of crueltie in it, vſing againſt it ſuch rigour and violence,  that oftentimes one would iudge it to be almoſt loſt and quite ouerthrowne by her owne euill misfortune; not counting the great loſſes and damages which ſhe receiued in euery vaine and corner, as well in the fauour and behalfe of Iohn, as in that of Ferdinand, as it oftentimes happeneth in ſuch broyles, where ſurely the fauour that men beare to the victorious, is no leſſe hurtfull and offenſiue to either part, then the diſgrace into which he vanquiſhed falleth: becauſe that neither the one nor the other receiueth any thing, but with the loſſe and damage of the very inhabitants and naturals of the countrie. 
            
            
               Ferdinand with a reſolute determination, willing to prepare a remedie for ſo many miſchiefes, and to vnfold and vntagle himſelfe from thoſe who had been the cauſe thereof, and not to omit the occaſion which fortune ſo fauourably preſented vnto him, for the conqueſt of that kingdome (which iuſtly by ſucceſſion, by election, and by an agreement appertained to him) determined to vndertake this enterpriſe, and therein to employ his vttermoſt endeuour with all his skill and force. And for that this expedition required a man that ſhould bee very wiſe and circumſpect, and one who had good experience in martiall affayres, and who ſhould be vigilant and warie in reſiſting and appoſing himſelfe againſt the Turkiſh ambuſhments, and be  able to auoyde and preuent them as occaſion ſhould require, and ſuch an one alſo as ſhould be able to behaue himſelfe with that circumſpect modeſtie in this buſines with the Frier, that he ſhould giue him no occaſion of any new inuention to practiſe his inconſtant wickednes. And beſides, ſeeing that at that time he had none ſuch with him, as the Frier demaunded, he determined to write to his brother the Emperour Charles the fift, that it would

pleaſe him to aſſiſt, and not to faile him in this ſo important buſines, and withall to ſend him ſo ſufficient a man, who could with good diſcretion conduct  this warre to a glorious and happie end, as he deſired, well knowing he had many a famous and renowned Captaine with him. He hauing reſolued vpon this concluſion, diſpatched one of his gentlemen with letters, and beſides commaunded his Ambaſſadour, who was at Auſpurg at the Emperours Court, that he ſhould throughly acquaint him with the diſcourſe of this warre, and whatſoeuer elſe ſhould be giuen him in charge. The Ambaſſadour, as ſoone as the genleman was arriued, diligently performed his Maſters commaund.
            The Emperour vnderſtanding at large this enterpriſe, and conſidering of what importance this warre was of, and regarding the diſtruſt which he had  of Frederick Duke of Saxon, and of Philip Lantgraue of Heſſe (whom as yet he held priſoners) he could not of a ſudden ſo well determine what to doe, not willing to forſake thoſe Commaunders, whom he knew in all ſtirrings and tumults to be neceſſarie for him: and further vnderſtanding of certaine motions of warre, that Henry King of France intended againſt him: and beſides, the diſlike of Duke Maurice, whom he had in great ielouſie, for that he would not deliuer his father in law, obſeruing the promiſe which he had made to him before, which was a thing that within ſhort time after (as in place conuenient wee ſhall at large more ſpeake of) procured him ſuch hate and toyle, as neuer in all his life time he endured the like. Hauing well conſidered  and weighed all theſe things, and willing to helpe his brother in his neceſſitie, ſpecially againſt the Infidels, determined in the end to ſend to him Iohn Baptiſte Caſtalde, Counte of Piadene, whom he a little before created Iohn Baptiſte Caſtalde choſen to goe Lieutenant into Hungarie for Ferdinand. Marqueſſe of Caſſan, and who at that time was Maſter of his Campe, and of the Councell for warre, a man ſufficiently experienced in all the former warres vnder the old Marqueſſe of Peſcara: who being called to him, he commaunded that he ſhould prepare and employ himſelfe in the expedition of his brother Ferdinand, making him Lieutenant and Captaine generall to his nephew Maximilian King of Bohemia. 
            
            
               Caſtalde gratiouſly accepted this charge which the Emperour had impoſed vpon him, and being well furniſhed with good ſtore of horſe and armes, which were beſtowed vpon him by many Lords of the Court, of whom he was well beloued and fauored. And among others of the Duke of Alba, the Biſhop of Arras, the Marqueſſe Iohn of Peſcara, and of the Duke of Seſſa, he put himſelfe in good equipage: and taking his leaue of the Emperour, he ſet forward towards Vienna: where being at laſt arriued, with a reaſonable companie, he was receiued of Ferdinand, and with great mirth &amp; ſports by the King Maximilian, with whom ſpending certaine daies, he was inſtructed by them of all things which were needfull for this warre, and of the manner which he ought to vſe towards the Frier, and how he ſhould gouerne and  commaund this Prouince, and the meanes to entertaine in loue and kindnes the Lords thereof. After that, Ferdinand promiſed him yeerely 8400. Florins of gold, to maintaine his eſtate, beſides the rewards that ſhould particularly bee giuen him to diſpoſe among men of marke and authoritie who followed him. And to the ende there ſhould bee no default for the true

payment of this money, he made him a more ample and ſure aſſignation.  He hauing thus confirmed his eſtate and authoritie, he ſpecially commaunded him that he ſhould peaceably &amp; friendly manage his affayres with Frier George, according to his nature, but with ſpeciall diſcretion, whereby he might at the beginning the better know and enter into his conditions; according to which, and to the experience and practiſe of things, which daily would preſent themſelues to him, he might gouerne and behaue himſelfe, and not to contradict him in any thing, but agreeing to all reaſonable matters which he demaunded, he ſhould alwaies ſhew himſelfe towards him liberall, milde, and gratious, knowing well that he was ambitious and couetous: that being the onely way whereby he muſt walke and temper with him. He alſo commaunded him that hee ſhould make a memoriall of all  ſuch things which were neceſſarie for this warre, as well for the commoditie and defence of footmen as horſemen, whereby there might bee prouiſion made therefore, and all things to be in a readines by that time he ſhould ſet forward on his iourney: which was preſently done, and preſented to his Maieſtie, according to the articles which here follow.

That in like ſort all the other officers of the Campe, of what nation ſoeuer, ought to receiue from the foreſaid Generall his ordinances  and commaundements, and to execute them in their quarters, whereby all things may proceede in their right and due courſe, not at any hand tolerating the retaylers to lodge within the Campe, for feare of famine, and bringing of them to neceſſitie, or victuals or other marchandiſe to be heigthned in their price, vpon which things they ought to haue ſpeciall care.
                        2 That he muſt haue a generall Comiſſarie ouer victuals, one that hath A generall Comiſſarie of victuals. experience therein, who hath the charge to diſtribute them; and to haue Bakers to make and bake bread; Butchers to giue euery one a ſufficient quantitie of fleſh; Victulars, Tauerners, Hoſtlers, and others who are accuſtomed  to carrie wine, fleſh, poultrie, egges, ſalt meates, cheeſe, rice, ſalt, pulſe, and other ſuch marchandiſe: for which neceſſaries there muſt bee conuenient roomes, and market places; to make euen meaſures, waights, and to moderate their prices, ſeuerally chaſtiſing thoſe who ſhall exceede and infringe the ſaid edicts, or offer violence, or ſhall inhaunce their marchandiſe

And that to the ſaid Secretarie and Comiſſarie, he ought to allow as many officers and clarkes to bee vnder them, as they ſhall neede, to the end euery man may bee furniſhed of their due; and that vpon any occaſion  they may be readie at hand according to their charge.

                        7 Beſides, he ought to appoint a ſufficient guard for the Artillerie, as well footmen as horſemen, vnder the charge of two Captaines, who ought The conduct or guard of Artillerie. to haue a ſpeciall care often to viſit and ouerſee them, to the end that they be not choked, and that the munition be not fiered.
                        8 That the Canoniers ought to bee lock Smiths, black Smiths, Carpenters, Canoniers. and Maſons, becauſe ſuch men are neceſſarie for a Campe, to ſhooe the Artillerie and horſes, when neede ſhall require, to build bridges, Bulwarkes, wals, and other engins vpon any occaſion.
                        9 And becauſe that oftentimes it happeneth vpon the way, that the Artillerie,  
                           Ingins to mount and diſmount Artillerie. by default of the wheeles and carriages, doth breake and faile, by which inconueniences it doth much hinder the ſpeed of an armie: therfore to auoyde ſuch lets, he ought alwaies to haue (in ſuch neceſſitie) other inſtruments and engins which are fit and neceſſarie to mount and diſmount the Artillerie.
                        10 The manner being, that after the Artillerie, the munition and inſtruments

                        12 And conſidering that it is well knowne what profit Pioners bring to Pioners. a Campe, to make trenches, rampiers, mynes, and countermynes; to make plaine and mend the bad waies, to ſappe the walles, and holds of townes, or Caſtles that are beſieged; to cut trees, and neceſſarie wood for the fortification of any place; to digge pits for the commoditie of ſouldiours, as well to haue water, as alſo to throw thereinto all the filth and ordure of the Campe.  For theſe occaſions he ought to be prouided of as many as he can, to whom he muſt appoint a Captaine and other Commaunders, ſuch as it behoueth to haue ſome knowledge and art to fortifie a Campe, and to make baſtions when occaſion ſerueth: which kinde of people are moſt neceſſarie for a Campe.
                        13 That he ought to chuſe a Captaine who may haue the care and charge Captaine of the Spies. of the Spies, and another to haue regard to the Guides, they both being very neceſſarie, and among other things to conduct the Interpreters. Theſe two Captaines ſhall haue the charge to diſpatch all the Spies and Guides that they will employ, to enquire and know by their voyages and trauailes, that  which the enemie intendeth to enterpriſe againſt their King and Lord. Vnder theſe, the Spies (which the Lieutenant generall would keepe by himſelf) muſt not be compriſed.
                        14 In like ſort he ought to ordaine and appoint certaine officers to clenſe Officers to clenſe the Campe. the Campe of the filth and excrements, which is done as well by men as beaſts, (which oftentimes cauſeth a great mortalitie) for that the ayre ſhould not bee corrupted, nor the ſouldiours fall ſicke, and they ought to carrie it by waggons or carts to the riuer, or to throw it into deepe ditches made for that purpoſe. 
                        
                        15 That hee ought alſo to make prouiſion of good ſtore of waggons, Waggons or carts to carrie victuals. drawne either with horſe or oxen, furniſhed with coffers for bread, bisket, meale, ſalt fleſh, ſalt fiſh, cheeſe, oyle, pulſes, and other kinde of victuals: with wine, vineger, and ſalt, to vſe as occaſion ſerueth, and alſo to carry prouender.
                        16 He ought alſo to haue carts to carrie piles, ſtakes, pickaxes, hatchets, Carts to carry implements and tooles. ſawes, pincers, and other inſtruments fit for Pioners; and good ſtore of

helues for piles, ſtakes, and other iron inſtruments, as occaſion ſhall ſerue in  time and place to vſe them.

                        18 That he ought to be furniſhed with boates and bridges portable; of Boates and bridges. beames, boords, cords and cables to binde them together; which things he ought in like ſort to haue carried vpon the carts, whereby he may bee the better able to paſſe any riuer, ditch, bogge, or any bad paſſage. 
                        
                        19 He ought alſo to make good prouiſion of Pikes, Launces, Caliuers, Pikes, Launces, Caliuers, &amp;c.

                           A Maſter of the Poſt. and ſtill hourely with diligence to carrie the aduertiſements and anſwers which come to his hands.
                        22 And to the ende that the ſouldiours doe not of a greedie minde Prieſts. robbe and ſpoyle others, it is neceſſarie that they forget not what appertaineth to good Chriſtians. Therefore he ought to make choiſe of Prieſts to follow the Campe, with their Veſtments and other ornaments, fit publikely to ſing Maſſe, whereby they enclining and addicting themſelues ſomewhat to religion, may vndertake the warre for honor and glorie, and not for ſpoile, or to inrich themſelues vniuſtly by the goods of their neighbours: ſeeing that in euery armie, the feare of God, the reſpect of religion, and the obſeruation  of iuſtice, are the true foundations and pillers of all commendable vertue.
                        23 That the ſaid Prieſts ought to haue the charge of the Hoſpitall, which That the Prieſts haue charge of the poore and ſick louldiours. for the common good of the poore ſouldiours, ſhall be ordained in three or foure Tents, at the Kings coſt and charges, and the Campe to bee prouided of Phiſitions, Surgions, and Barbers to heale thoſe who are ſicke and wounded: and that they alſo bee prouided of ſeruants ſufficient for their turne. And if any of the ſicke bee at the point of death, the Prieſts ſhall be readie at hand to confeſſe them, and miniſter the Communion and al the Sacraments to them, as is fitting for good Chriſtians: and if they dye, to be buried with as great honour as may be. 
                        
                        24 He ought alſo to giue commaund to certaine officers, not to ſuffer Commaunds that none diſbandeth themſelues. any to disband themſelues out of their ranks, and eſpecially when the campe marcheth, and that they may haue authoritie to puniſh them accordinglie.
                        25 And laſtly, he ought to make choiſe of a Captaine for the baggage, A Captaine of the baggage.
                           
who ſhall conduct them vnder an Enſigne, but in ſuch ſort, that by the way he doe not intermeddle himſelfe with the armie. 
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            I haue hither vnto written more amply of this note, to the ende it may ſerue to all Kings and Princes who would manage and exerciſe martiall diſcipline, whereby they may know how to prouide and conduct their armies in their iourneys. And whoſoeuer hath a deſire to ſee more of this ſubiect, I referre them to the fiue treatiſes that the Lord Aſcagne Centorio hath made of warre, wherein hee ſhall more at large ſee all things diſtinctlie written.
            Theſe Articles being finiſhed and preſented to Fredinand, he gaue ſpeciall order to execute them, if not in all places, yet at leaſt in as many as for that time they could conueniently. And whileſt they were buſie in theſe  affayres, Frier George fearing, that by too long a delay of ſuccours, which he daily expected, the Queene ſhould aſſemble ſo great forces, that the preparation of Ferdinand would bee in vaine, and to little effect to ayde him: wherefore he ceaſed not by meſſenger vpon meſſenger to ſolicite and vrge him, that his armie ſhould march towards him with as great expedition as was poſſible, becauſe that in temporiſing and deferring time, hee feared the loſſe of ſo fayre an occaſion in the conqueſt of the kingdome. Ferdinand being aduertiſed of this, and iudging it beſt not to omit any time; after the accompliſhment and deliuerie of the ſaid Articles which they preſented vnto him, and perceiuing that it was beſt that Caſtalde ſhould depart with ſuch  men and munition, as for the preſent he then had, he cauſed to be diſpatched to Caſtalde a very large Commiſſion, by which he gaue him power &amp; authoritie to cauſe him to bee obeyed, and to commaund euery one, not onely in Hungarie, and Dalmatia, but alſo through all Croatia, and euen to the other parts of Slauonia, and lower Auſtria, minding that he ſhould be chiefe in all the Councels and aſſemblies which were held in thoſe countries: and hee commaunded him that before he went to the Campe, he ſhould viſit the Ile of Comar, and other holds, and enquire in what eſtate the frontire places were, that ſo hee might diligently prouide what was neceſſarie for them; becauſe that they were then but meanly munitioned, through the ſloth and  careleſnes of thoſe who had the commaund of them.
            Following this commaund, the firſt day of May Anno 1551. Caſtalde departed Caſtalde goeth into Hungary An. 1551. from Vienna, and tooke the way leading towards Agria, where the ſouldiours were that he ſhould leade into Tranſiluania, firſt going himſelfe to the frontier places (as we haue ſaid) which he commaunded to be repaired the beſt hee could, foreſeeing that a time would ſhortly come, which would manifeſtly declare how profitable it might be, not to haue been ſlothfull and negligent in theſe things, which in ſemblance are thought little and of no validitie, and yet afterward doe coſt very deare: for beſides the loſſe of honour, men many times loſe for them, both State and life it ſelfe. Caſtalde 
                being arriued at Agria, he found there Bernard Aldene, Campe maſter of ſeuen Companies of Spaniards, which Ferdinand at his coſts and charges entertained in thoſe quarters, and thoſe to attend him were lodged by the towne. He ſpent there certaine daies, vntill hee had gathered all his ſouldiours together, and in the meane time he laboured to furniſh himſelfe of all

neceſſaries, which was behoouefull for a battaile. And he ſeeing this towne Caſtalde cauſed Agria to be fortified. to bee one of the moſt important of Hungarie, and that it was neither  ſtrong by ſituation nor rampier, and that there was no induſtrie nor art vſed for the remedie thereof, and that the walles (ſuch as they were) were not yet very well flanked, being rather built after the ancient manner of fortification, then ſuch as of our time: for the remedy of ſo many inconueniences, he committed the charge therof to Eraſmus Teufl to fortifie it, and (by the commaund of Ferdinand) not to omit nor deferre the fortifying thereof, vntill he had fully finiſhed it.
            Hauing gathered together all his armie, and ſeeing that in expecting the Cannons (which by the negligence of thoſe who had the charge to ſend them, were not yet arriued, and which might bee the cauſe of ſome  inconuenience) he determined neuertheleſſe to depart without them, giuing notice to Ferdinand, that he ſhould cauſe them to bee ſent with as great expedition as could be. Reſting vpon this determination, he departed from Agria the 26. of May, appointing his armie to march in this manner. Hee placed in the Vauntgard ſeuen Enſignes of Spaniards, who were in number 1200. and 500. Hungars, called Aiduchs, and 1000. of light Hungariſh horſemen, named Vſarons, who after the Turkiſh manner fought with Targets, Aiduchs. Vſarons. Turkiſh Launces, Maces of iron, Sables, and Murrions: they were vnder the The armie of Caſtalde. conduct of a Lord of Sleſia, named Captaine Chriſtopher, and after them followed 4. field peeces. The Battaile was led by Counte Felix of Arco, and  Counte Iohn Baptiſta of Arco, they had vnder them one Regiment of 3000. Almaines, all good experienced ſouldiours and well armed, with 4. other field peeces, and two ſmall Culuerins, with 400. horſe, whereof were 300. of Launces, and 100. Piſtoliers. He cauſed to march in the Rereward, the Hungariſh Infantrie, with 300. light horſe, and the baggage with three field peeces, the whole armie making 5700. ſouldiours, and 1700. horſe. With this ſmall armie, Caſtalde proceeded on his iourney to conquer Tranſiluania, againſt ſo puiſſant a Prince as the Turke. And hereof may bee ſaid, as King Tygranes ſcoffingly ſaid of the Romanes armie, which came to incounter  him, vnder the conduct of Lucullus: That they were too many for Ambaſſadours, and too few for fighters, for that they ſeemed but a handfull of men, in reſpect of his which were 250000. Caſtalde being arriued in this Militarie order at Tiſſe, anciently called Tibiſcus, which is a large and deepe riuer, which taketh The riuer Tibiſcus or Tiſſe. The hill Carpatus. his beginning in Poland, at the foote of the hill Carpatus, and thwarteth Hungarie, and ſtretcheth it ſelfe towards the South, vntill it entereth into Danubius betweene Belgrade and Cenedin, where then it loſeth his name. It is in ſome places eight miles broade, by reaſon of Quagmires, and Mariſhes which it maketh, as it findeth the ground there flat and euen, and it glideth ſo ſoft and ſmooth away, that one can ſcantly ſee it moue. The water  thereof is very fayre and cleere, and greatly abounding in fiſh. Caſtalde by this riuer a while repoſed his Campe, and willing himſelfe the firſt to paſſe it, the better to encourage his Captaines and ſouldiours: ſome ſay that vpon the ſhore of this riuer he made to them this or the like ſpeech.
            
               If I had not knowne (my braue and valiant ſouldiours) that your ſpirit The oratiō of Caſtalde to his ſouldiours. and courage deſireth rather the glorie and renowne of God, then your own

proper ſafeties, I would neuer haue ventured my ſelfe thus farre vnder your  affiance and valour. And for that I well know the renowne and fame of your predeceſſors, who haue obtained in this countrie ſo many victories, will ſtirre vp in you (my louing companions) courage to follow their ſteps and honourable endeuours, and that the memorie of their exploites and glorious acts may be as preuailent in you, as they haue been in your predeceſſors, in cōſidering the things which may now eterniſe you, I doubt not at any hand but you will cauſe your valiantnes and vertues to appeare through the world, and ſpecially in theſe quarters, where we may ſee more ſtore of enemies then friends, and where in reſpect of the common enemie, we muſt with the edge of the ſworde make our paſſage, being now in a Prouince which wee haue neuer ſeene nor ſought after; where is no great ſuretie  to repoſe any confidence; where it is a noueltie to ſee a new kingdome erected; and where infinit daungers doe abound, neceſſitie forceth, and the warres which now alreadie are prepared againſt the Infidels threatneth vs; which are motiues (albeit they ſeeme very fearfull) of which wee ought to make our benefit, to cauſe our prudence, wiſedome, and dexteritie of ſpirit to bee knowne, (which are vertues more deſired then any other) in that thereby men ſhall ſee the boldnes and courage of you (my louing ſouldiours) and the faith and end of that inuiolable oth which we all haue made to our King. Behold we are here vpon Tibiſcus, the paſſage whereof ſhould  cauſe vs all to reioyce; wee our ſelues being now out of Italic, you out of Spaine, and the other forth of Germanie, not to follow corporall and effeminate pleaſures, which make a man weake, ſickly, effeminate, tender, and bleakiſh: but, to aſpire to honour, riches, and victorie, and to haue the reward of our honourable deedes, ſuch as ſhall bee yeelded to vs by proſperous fortune, which I doubt not but it will bee ſuch towards vs, that ofterreſtriall men, it will make vs celeſtiall, and ſound in the ayre ſo honourable a bruite of our worthie names, that neither time, nor death ſhall obſcure nor rake it vp in obliuion, but wee ſhall liue time out of memorie, yea eternally. And for that wee are now to deale with people, who are diuerſe from our cuſtomes and manner of liuing, of whom it behoueth vs to winne their loue  and liking by policie and diſcretion, and to whom, to the end our manner of life and eſtate ought to bee an example and myrrour: it ſeemeth to me not to be vnfitting or vnworthie, but rather neceſſarie and commendable (diſcourſing of this with you, and reducing the whole to the firſt glorie of true Militarie diſcipline) to aduertiſe you, that after we haue paſſed this riuer, and begun to enter into the countrie, (which by vs, in the name of our King, ought to be defended and conquered) to draw the hearts of the inhabitants (which are diuided into three Prouinces; namely, the Sicilians, Saxons, and Subalpinians) to our deuotion, will, and friendſhip, we muſt bee with all of  them very modeſt, temperate, and quiet, and muſt baniſh auarice, deſpiſe voluptuouſnes, and contemne the pleaſures of the body, and aboue all, muſt flye all idlenes; which how hurtfull it is to an armie, and how many euils it bringeth with it, you ſufficiently conceiue. Beſides, we muſt auoide robberies, preſerue the honour of women, reſpect ancient perſons, haue care of poore children, to liue amongſt your ſelues as obſeruers of true religion, to

fauour the friends thereof, and purſue the enemies: and thinke that wee being in a ſtrange countrie, and in another mans houſe, to doe but that which  you would doe at home: wee ſeeing by experience that euery beaſt, though neuer ſo little, being in his denne becommeth as a Lyon, in defending himſelfe from the iniurie and oppreſſion which is offered him: and iudging thereby how much more they ought and will become couragious and hardie in their owne houſes, if they ſee or feele themſelues outraged by vs. Beſides, ye ought in all your actions to haue God alwaies before your eyes, for the loue and honour of whom we ought to expoſe our bodies and liues; and thereby manifeſting our ſelues meeke and curteous one to another; and towards our enemies, fierce, bold, horrible, fearfull, prompt, and  hardie, to cauſe others to know that wee are couragious without feare, wiſe, and full of vnderſtanding, that by ſuch meanes you may alwaies haue together with health, a high way to vertue ſet open before you, and that euery one of you may with me carrie into his countrie renowne and eternall memorie: not refuſing any paine or trauaile, for that no wearines nor any incommodities, or croſſes, can, or ought euer to enter into ſuch vigilant or heroicall ſpirits, whereby to darken or deface the deſire and earneſt affection which proceedeth from true honour and glorie: and ſpecially, I being with you, not as a Commaunder amongſt you, but as a father, brother, and companion as well in aduerſitie as in proſperitie. And to the end you may aſſure  your ſelues that it is true which I haue ſaid, my ſelfe will be the firſt that will paſſe ouer this water, and will not refuſe the firſt danger that may befall me; to the end that by this example, euery one of you may learne rather to eſteeme honour and reputation, then his owne proper life, and preferre an honourable death before a vile and diſhoneſt life.
            
            Hauing thus ended his ſpeech, he preſently paſſed to the other ſide of the riuer, cauſing alſo the reſt of his armie to follow, which was eight daies in Caſtalde entereth into Tranſiluania. paſſing, in reſpect of the largenes of the riuer. After they were all beyond the water, they continually marched in battaile, vntill they came to Debrezen, Debrezen. a ſmall towne of no great ſtrength, where they found Andrew Battor, and  
               Thomas Nadaſdy, who were the greateſt and richeſt Lords of Hungarie, and Andrew Battor. ſuch who alreadie had obtained great reputation through the whole countrie. Thomas Nadaſdy. One of them was Generall of the Hungariſh Caualarie, and great Comiſſarie; and the other was Lieutenant generall. Theſe two were in this towne with 500. horſe to receiue Caſtalde, and to conduct him into Tranſiluania, according to the meanes and experiences which they had in that kingdome. Caſtalde knowing that they would at their entrance into the towne, obſerue and note what number his armie might be of, commaunded the Sergeant Maior, and Campe maſter, that they ſhould preſently cauſe the armie to march in the beſt order and forme they could, and ſo, that it might ſeeme hee had more men, then in trueth hee had. This preſently was done  with ſuch dexteritie and iudgement, that thoſe Lords eſteemed the armie to be of farre greater number, then indeed it was, and ſeeing all the ſouldiours well ordered and marching with a graue and ſettled countenance, they highly commended their ordinance. The armie being certaine daies refreſhed in this towne, they all together continued on their iourney, vntill

they came to Zalnoch, which is a Caſtle enuironed with water, where, for Zalnoch. the guard and ſafetie thereof (before he departed) he left 50. Spaniards. 
            
            During the march of this armie, and that they haſted to arriue at the place The Queene cauſed a Diet to be held at Egneth. where Frier George was, the Queene had publiſhed a Diet to bee held at Egneth, (which is one of the greateſt townes of Tranſiluania) there to deliberate and aduiſe what meanes was beſt to chaſe and expell the Frier out of that Prouince. He at that time (as wee haue ſaid) was at his Biſhopricke of Varadine, and vnderſtanding the drift of the Queene, and to what purpoſe ſhe laboured, omitting all things, which then he was greatly buſied about, called for his Coach, and in the greateſt haſte he could, tooke the way that lead towards Chereſuania. Vpon the way, paſſing a little brooke which runneth by a valley, it happened that his Coach ouerturned in ſuch dangerous  manner, that if hee had not inſtantly been helped by his men, he had there been drowned. Certaine gentlemen of his traine, ill interpreting this accident, aduiſed him to returne from thence: but hee ſmiling, made them this anſwer: That ſuch diuinations as were grounded vpon Chariots, were exceeding miſerable; knowing that they had in heauen another Chariot, which by his influence would warrant him: minding by his pleaſant countenance to inferre, that the Chariot of Erictonius placed in heauen, ſhould among other ſignes ſtand him in ſtead of a guide: and ſo with expedition continuing on his iourney, within ſhort time he approached neere to Torde, from whence hee wrote to all the Lords, who were with the  Queene, and ſpecially to his friends, that if they would ſee the ſafegard and defence of their countrie, and that the whole kingdome ſhould not bee ouerthrowne and loſt, and fall into the puiſſant commaund of the Infidels, George diſſolueth the Diet at Egneth. they would not faile, but preſently come to the place where hee was, and where hee daily expected them, that they might ſpeedily prouide for the common good of all. Within a while after, there came to him certaine bands of ſouldiours and companies of horſe, which hee cauſed to come from Varadine, which being come together, made a good number of men, with whom he determined to goe to this Diet, ſhadowing his intent, that they came with him for no other cauſe, but onely to bee a guard for his perſon.  Thus againſt the opinion and liking of all, he came from thence to Egneth, where being arriued, he ſo throughly diſſolued and brake off the Diet, that not any (ſo great and mightie was hee) durſt ſtay there any longer, leaſt the Frier ſhould ſtomacke and malice them: and by this meanes he ouerthrew all the Queenes deſeignes, which vaniſhed into ſmoke. She vnderſtanding the arriuall of the Frier, and ſeeing ſhe could come to no better end of that, which to her great charges and trauaile ſhe had alreadie begun, ſuddenly diſlodged from that towne with her ſonne, and retired her ſelfe to Albe-iula, with ſuch force as ſhe had, of which Peter Vicchy was Captaine  generall, who cauſed the towne to be well fortified. But after fearing to be beſieged therein by the Frier, leauing there as many men as was thought neceſſary for the defence therof, ſhe thought it better to make her retraict to Saſſebeſſe, (a place for the ſituation farre ſtronger then Albe-iula) where ſhe determined to ſtay and expect what would be the iſſue of her fortune. The Frier being aduertiſed of all this, and alſo vnderſtanding certaine newes, that

the forces which Ferdinand had ſent were alreadie on their way, and that Caſtalde came with no ſmall ayde, preſently determined vpon this occaſion to  
               George beſiegeth Albeiula. beſiege Albe-iula, thinking that if he were able to be maſter thereof, he had effected the greateſt part of his deſires. Being there arriued, with this reſolution he very ſtraightly beſieged and battered it in many places with great ſtore of Cannon. But thoſe within being nothing poſſeſt with feare, valiantly defended themſelues, and more couragiouſly then the Frier expected. He now ſeeing the conſtancie and reſolution of the beſieged to bee ſuch, and that Caſtalde made but ſlow ſpeede, although euery day by letters and Poſts vpon Poſts, he willed him to haſten on his iourney, and ſo much the rather becauſe he beſieged this towne, which defended it ſelfe ſo gallantly, that it  was greatly needfull for him to haue the helpe of his forces; hee againe thought it ſitting to ſeek out meanes once more to accord with the Queene. Whileſt theſe matters were treated of, Caſtalde arriued at the confines of Tranſiluania. But ſince it now very fitly falleth out, I will for a while leaue the continuation of this hiſtorie, and will largely deſcribe the ſituation, the inhabitants, the ſtrength, the qualitie, and fertilitie of that countrie.
            Tranſiluania is a Prouince of the kingdome of Hungarie, making a part The deſcription of Tranſiluania. thereof, enuironed on all ſides with high mountaines, reſembling a well walled towne, hauing all his entries and paſſages very difficill and narrow, which maketh me thinke that it tooke his name thereof, being anciently named  Dacia, of King Docus, who was Lord and King thereof. Towards the North it boundeth vpon Polonia, and of one part of Moldauia, hauing in the midſt the hils Carpates. Towards the Weſt it doth confine vpon Hungarie: and towards the Eaſt it ſtretcheth it ſelfe to the ſhores of Danubius, and taketh his ending againſt Walachia: the inhabitants whereof are called Walachians, Walachia. anciently diſſended of ſome Romane Colonie, ſprung from the familie of the Flacchians, who were ſent to ſubdue that countrie, of whom that Prouince afterward tooke the name of Flaccia, which at this preſent is corrupted into the name of Walachia, which alſo containeth in it Moldauia, being Moldauia. two ſeuerall Prouinces, which now are ſeparated, compriſed in time paſt vnder  the name of Flacchia. Towards the South it neighboureth vpon the Tranſalpiniās. Tranſalpinians, and Seruians named Slauons, and the Raſcians, vulgarly called Rhatians, who in a manner are as naturall Walachians, for that they all Rhatians. liue vnder one law and cuſtome: they are Chriſtians, and obſerue the decrees and ceremonies of the Greeke Church, they obey the Patriarke of Conſtantinople; they vſe the Italian language, but ſo corrupted, that it is hardly vnderſtood to be the ſame; they vſe armes like to thoſe of the Turks; they haue been and are yet a warlike nation, cruell, and endureth trauaile and wearines of warre more then any other people, for that they are naturally very ſtrong. Within Tranſiluania there is a Prouince in a manner linked to a mountaine, which ſeparateth it from Moldauia, which is named Ceculia,  and the inhabitants thereof are called Ceculians, and at this day they are called Ceculians. Sicilians, who are of the Hungarian nation, and of the ſame qualitie and Sicilians. diſpoſition, liuing according to the lawes and cuſtomes of Hungarie. The other part of the kingdome, which is the greateſt, is inhabited by the Saxons, Saxons. who euer ſince the time that Charlemaine ouerthrew them, by meane of

that great battaile which hee obtained againſt them nigh the mountaine of  Ouege, haue alwaies remained there. For Charlemaine defeating them, cauſed a good number of them to be led into Gaule, and forced the other who would not obſerue and obey the lawes (which he would haue eſtabliſhed) to goe ſeeke ſome other habitations. Of theſe a great part entered into Tranſiluania to conquer it, and making themſelues maſters thereof by force of armes, they there ſet vp their abode, and built ſeuen townes or Caſtles, whereof for a long time that Prouince tooke the name, which continueth vntil this day, and in reſpect whereof, it is called in their language Sibemburgen. Theſe liue after the Germane manner, and obſerue their cuſtomes, ſpeaking the ancient Saxon language; they are affable people, and of great  trueth and fidelitie. They are not alwaies in league with the Hungarians, neither will they ſuffer them to build in their townes. Their mountaines are inhabited by the Walachians, to whom the Saxons (who are of the greateſt authoritie and rule in that kingdome) would not permit them to build any of their houſes with chalke and ſtones, nor haue nor poſſeſſe much about them. And therefore they dwelt in little houſes and cottages, which they made themſelues, without any Maſon or Carpenter, and are but thatched with ſtraw and ruſhes. They labour not nor till the fields in hope of any gaine, but onely to gather together ſo much as is neceſſarie to nouriſh and ſuſtaine their familie, and the Slaues which they get. This kingdome greatly aboundeth in corne, wine, fleſh, veniſon, and all manner of fruites, and  breedeth very many ſtrong and goodly horſes. There is found in many of thoſe mountaines, mynes of gold, ſiluer, iron, and ſalt is fetched from thence in ſo great abundance, that moſt part of Hungarie and Polonia are ſerued therewith, which is an exceeding rich commoditie, and bringeth great profit to the King. Theſe mynes are not farre from Iſembergh, Clauſemburgh, and Saltzburgh. Victuals are there ſold ordinarily at ſo cheape a rate, that it is a thing incredible. The Marchants of this Prouince, during the peace and truce, might trafficke with their marchandiſe through all the Turkes dominions, and continually haue entercourſe with Germanie, Hungarie, Pololonia, and Italie. The ayre is many times intemperate, by the extreame cold,  and exceſſiue heate, which often is felt there: the cold though neuertheleſſe it bee terrible and ſharpe, yet it dureth not long, and happeneth not but at certaine times, which being paſt, the heate preuaileth more then the cold. All the countrie is vneuen or hillie, and the greateſt part is like to Tuſcane, or hillie Spayne, and is full of great forreſts, which yeelde ſtore of wood, as well to build, as for other priuate commodities. There be two great riuers which be nauigable; the one runneth through the middeſt of the kingdome and is called Maroſſe, which ſpringeth from the mountaines of Moldauia towards The riuer of Maroſſe. the North, and runneth from one ſide to another of that countrie, vntill it entereth into Tibiſcus, neere the frontier townes of Lippa and Themeſuar,  which are two ſtrong holds, and ſo named, for that they are ſituated beyond the mountaines towards the Weſt. The other is named Alto, and The riuer of Cheres. at this day the inhabitants call it Cheres, which ſpringeth at the foote of Mount Carpatus, about the place where it ioyneth with the other hils of Moldauia. There is alſo other ſmall riuers, wherein are found amongſt the

grauell, many graines of gold of great value and price. Towards the South dwelleth certaine people named Rhatians, which were relikes of the ancient  
               Rhatians. Raſcians, who remaine vntill this day, ſince the time they were chaſed foorth of their natiue countrie of Macedonia, by Lyſimachus. They are to bee hired of any who will giue moſt: one while they take part with Ferdinand, and then againe they are in the Turkes pay. They are vnconſtant people and of little faith; they are Chriſtians, and liue after the Greeke Church; they are poore, hauing no townes peculiar to themſelues, and they are in great diſlike with all other nations for their inconſtancie and perfidiouſnes. They dwell among the Bulgarians and Seruians in two places of the kingdome, and on the other ſide among the mountaines by the Tranſiluanians,  which ſtretch themſelues towards Walachia.
            This kingdome of Tranſiluania, after it was reduced to the faith of Ieſus Chriſt, was ſubiect to the Crowne of Hungarie; for the gouernment and rule whereof, one of the principalleſt of the Court was deputed and nominated with the title of Vayuode. The capitall towne is called Sibinium, taking Sibinium called Hermenſtat. Preſſouia called Cronenſtat. that name of a riuer which paſſeth by it. This towne is named by the Germanes Hermenſtat, others call it Preſſouia, alias Cronenſtat, and it is of great trafficke. Thither is brought great ſtore of marchandiſe from Greece, which from thence is diſperſed throughout Hungarie. There are many other townes, as Corone, Torde, Caſſouia, and Albe-iula, which was built by  
               Corone. Torde. Caſſouia. Albe-iula. the Romanes, and eſtabliſhed for one of their Colonies. This Prouince had no abſolute King but Iohn, who raigned after the death of Lewis King of Hungarie; and after that, Stephen poſſeſſed it, (who for the preſent is King) Stephen King of Tranſiluania called Iohn. who alſo was called Iohn in memorie of his father, and by the Turkes fauour and aſſiſtance enioyeth it peaceably: and from hence forward wee will call him Iohn, and not Stephen.
            
            
               Caſtalde (as a little before hath been ſaid) being arriued in Tranſiluania, ſent Andrew Battor and Thomas Nadaſdy before, to foreſee and ſuruay the paſſages of the mountaines, by which hee muſt of neceſſitie paſſe, giuing them a good troupe of horſes, with other ſouldiours. Which being well foreſeene by the Queene, ſhe ſent the Marqueſſe of Balaſſe, a great Lord of  Hungarie (who a little before was entertained into her ſeruice, through The Marqueſſe of Balaſſe. ſome diſgrace offered by Ferdinand, for that hee had thruſt him out of certaine Caſtles ſituated in Hungarie, vnder the colour of rebellion, which was ſaid to haue been pretended againſt his Maieſtie) to poſſeſſe thoſe paſſages with 700. horſe, and a good troupe of ſouldiours. Caſtalde being aſſuredly informed of this, was by the aduice of two (although it was a thing very tedious and difficult) conſtrained to ſeeke other paſſages and waies, which being in the end found, he commaunded them to bee repayred the beſt they could, which aſſuredly was a worke long and tedious: but neuertheleſſe  they laboured ſo diligently and commodiouſly, that by the ſame way, all the Artillerie might paſſe without any great labour. Whileſt the Marqueſſe kept the moſt frequent paſſages, Caſtalde by that new vnaccuſtomed way, entered with all his armie into Tranſiluania, without any diſturbance, and the day following marched in battaile, and was forced to paſſe by a Caſtle of Dalmas beſieged by the people of Ferdinand. the Queenes named Dalmas, ſeated in the way vpon the top of a mountaine,

from when he was ſaluted with the force of the Cannon: hee being  not willing to tolerate ſuch a brauado, went himſelfe to view the place, and to ſee if he could take it by aſſault, with intent to leaue nothing behinde that hereafter might annoy him. But he ſeeing it was more ſtrong then he tooke it to be, and that it was of no ſmall importance by reaſon of that paſſage, and being needfull to haue Cannons to batter it, whereof hee was altogether vnprouided, was forced, without doing any other thing, to depart, leauing there Counte Felix, and Counte Iohn Baptiſta of Arco (who then led the rereward) to continue the ſiege with their Germanes, and to batter it with foure field peeces, and two ſmall Culuerins which they brought with them, with intent to proue them, if through feare they would yeeld. Which thing  the Counte performed, by ſtraightning the beſieged, and battering it as he was commaunded. Whileſt Counte Felix was thus buſied about this place, Caſtalde proceeded on his iourney with the reſt of his armie, and lodged by a towne named Coloſuar, from whence he ſent to the Counte 300. Haquebuziers of Spaniards, to be at the ſiege of Dalmas.
            The Queene being perſwaded by the Frier to accord with him, refuſed The Queene accordeth with George. not any agreement, ſpecially after ſhe vnderſtood that there ſhould come to his ayde 10000. Spanyards, and great ſtore of Caualarie from many places: euen as Fame (a meſſenger as well of falſe as of true matters) is accuſtomed to increaſe and multiplie in the mouthes of men, ſometimes ſtretching things beyond the compaſſe of trueth. And knowing that he was alreadie  arriued in her kingdome, and that her Caſtle of Dalmas was beſieged, ſhe was by this newes greatly troubled, ſeeing her ſelfe disfurniſhed of ſouldiours, and fearing to be expelled forth of her kingdome by the Frier, and to loſe that which ſhe held moſt deare, falling from the dignitie and maieſtie of a Queene, to the ſtate and condition of a miſerable Ladie, being aſſured that Albe-iula (wherein were her Iewels, and moueables, and the Crowne of Hungarie, which aboue all things was ſpecially deſired of the Frier, and alſo greatly eſteemed of her) could no longer hold out, ſhe willingly accepted of ſuch an agreement as was offered her; and gladly inclining thereunto, commaunded thoſe of Albe-iula to ſurrender the towne, Albe-iula yeelded to George. 
                conditionally the goods and the reſt of any worth that was therein to bee ſaued; whereunto her people obeyed the Frier in all things that he would. Whereupon hee permitted not that any ſouldiour ſhould enter into the towne, vntill all the Queenes moueables were carried out: and to the end they might be carried to the place where ſhe deſired, he prouided them of many waggons for the more commodious carrying of their baggage.
            Preſently vpon the taking of this towne, hee failed not ſpeedily to ſend aduertiſement to Caſtalde of all that which had happend vntill then; and withall ſent to him a certaine Comiſſarie to guide and direct him through  the paſſages of the countrie, and to march with his armie towards Egneth, where hee might at pleaſure commodiouſly lodge and refreſh his Campe certaine daies, the place being very pleaſant and abounding in victuals. Caſtalde 
               Caſtalde at Egneth. being there arriued, hee was lodged with the Spanyards within the towne, and diſpoſed the Caualarie and the reſt of the ſouldiours in places conuenient thereabout, whereby they might keepe euery man in the greater

ſecuritie, attending there a certaine time, to finde the meanes to ioyne with the Frier, who after the taking of Albe-iula, went to ſee the Queene, and  gaue her notice of the comming of Caſtalde, further perſwading her to commaund thoſe of Dalmas, that they ſhould yeeld to him, and not hold out any longer againſt them which did beſiege it, nor againſt the Artillerie which greatly endamaged them; eſpecially conſidering that ſhe very well knew, that granting to their accord, this Fortreſſe ſhould become hers. The Queene conſented to it for two cauſes: the one, that ſhe might not ſee thoſe within the Caſtle ſo greatly oppreſſed for the loue and affection they bore to her, and the place to fall in decay and ruine: the other, to the end that the Counte (for the hope which the Frier gaue him) might not by the loſſe of  his people receiue any detriment, and for that reſpect hee might not ſhew himſelfe too cruell towards her people. Thus by reaſon of ſuch feare, ſhe gaue commaund to all the ſouldiours of Dalmas to yeeld. They following Dalmas yeelded to Caſtalde. this commaund, failed not to ſurrender the place into Counte Felix poſſeſſion, euen at the ſame inſtant when a myne was almoſt finiſhed to haue blowen it vp, in ſtead of the Cannon; and withall to haue giuen a fierce aſſault.
            As this Caſtle was yeelded, and Caſtalde remained at Egneth, the Frier came to conferre with him, who although hee was councelled to come vnlooked The meeting of George and Caſtalde. for into the place where he was lodged, yet was it not done ſo ſecretly, but it was diſcouered halfe an houre before his comming. Caſtalde hauing  notice therof, preſently went forth of the towne well accompanied to meete him, the Frier comming in his Coach, drawne with eight great horſes, as he was vſually wont to ride, there being in his company for his guard more then 400. horſe, the moſt part of whom were Gentlemen and Knights, and of the principall and chiefe of the kingdome, hauing beſides 200. Harquebuziers. In this equipage the Frier approaching Caſtalde, preſently deſcended his Coach, and mounted vpon a well paced horſe, which alwaies he cauſed to beled with him, and comming to Caſtalde, he imbraced him very kindly, manifeſting what infinit content he receiued at his comming, there paſſing betweene them a thouſand ſpeeches full of curteſie, and ſhewing exceeding  honour one to another. After which ſalutations betweene them, the Frier turning himſelfe towards Aldene Maſter of the Campe, and other Spaniſh Captaines who alſo were there preſent, entertaining them with many friendly and kinde ſpeeches, hee made it knowne to them what ſingular comfort he receiued, in ſeeing them ſo ſafely arriued and conducted thither. After all theſe friendly ſalutations, they entered together into the towne, and went directly to Caſtaldes lodging: where after they were refreſhed, and had diſcourſed together of many important things, Caſtalde ſhewed him the letters of Ferdinand, acquainting him with the authoritie and commaund that his Maieſtie would he ſhould haue in managing theſe affayres of the kingdome;  
               The ſubtilties betweene Caſtalde and George. in the adminiſtration and rule whereof, he was expreſſely charged to obey and ſubmit himſelfe to his iudgement, conſidering that for the time to come, all things ſhould paſſe through his hands, as alreadie they had vntill then done; yeelding to him all authoritie to diſpoſe of things at his pleaſure, knowing that ſuch was the will of Ferdinand, from whom hee had expreſſe

commaund, to content and gratifie him in any thing which ſhould pleaſe  and ſatisfie his liking. Whereof the Frier was exceeding glad, and thought himſelfe well apayd, as well in reſpect of Caſtalde himſelfe, as alſo for the honour which was done him, and of the fayre words which (in the name of Ferdinand) was reported to him. For being by his naturall diſpoſition of a proud and haughtie ſpirit, and puffed vp with honour and renowne, would by no meanes endure that any ſhould bee his ſuperiour. And conſidering the great authoritie and commaund that Caſtalde (as Lieutenant generall for the King of Bohemia) had, and the reuerence, honor, and ſubmiſſion which neuertheleſſe he made ſhew to vſe towards him, hee eſteemed it a good beginning to continue his pride and greatnes, and that in all the affayres of the  kingdome he might commaund and diſpoſe thereof according at his owne pleaſure. Deſirous then to enioy (according to his accuſtomed manner) ſuch preheminence and authoritie, and to ſhew the commaund and greatnes which he had through all Tranſiluania (two daies after that he was departed from Caſtalde) he preſently ſeized vpon Albe-iula for himſelfe to lodge and remaine in, not acquainting Caſtalde therewith, ſaying, that that place was the moſt commodieſt and fitteſt to finde him, when neede ſhould require, and the neceſſarieſt to treate of all buſineſſes that might fall out. That being George went to the Queen. done, he poſted to the Queene to Saſſebeſſe, to informe her of all which had paſſed betweene him and Caſtalde. 
               
            
            During the time the Frier was on his way, the Queene (who nothing was idle nor ſlept) had by one of her Lords, who was a Polonian, a man of good eſteeme in his countrie, ſent another way to viſit and ſalute Caſtalde. By him, and by the offers which ſhe made to him, Caſtalde did prognoſticate what the iſſue and euent of all the affayres of that countrie would ſort vnto, and principally of thoſe which concerned the Queene, he wel knew they would ſucceede to his deſire, and haue ſuch ending that Ferdinand ſhould thinke himſelfe well apayd therewithall. Certaine daies being paſſed before any newes was heard of the Frier, in the ende there arriued a meſſenger from him, who gaue notice to Caſtalde, that hee ſhould not faile the 6. of Iuly to finde him at Albe-iula, to conferre together vpon their affayres. The time  being come, Caſtalde without any guard, onely accompanied with certaine Caſtalde went to ſeek George of his owne houſehold, went to the place appointed. The manner of this departure was againſt the counſell of Andrew Battor and Thomas Nadaſdy, and many other, who thought it not conuenient ſo ſlightly to repoſe himſelfe in this man, who becauſe they knew him to be ſo mutable in his opinions, and ſo variable in his doings, might bee able within a ſhort time after, vnder the colour of any occaſion whatſoeuer, to inuent and ſtirre vp ſome new matter, and be more hardie and bold to execute the ſame, ſeeing Caſtalde alone, then otherwiſe he would be, if his forces were with him: and for that cauſe they perſwaded him, that he would not depart but with a good troupe. But Caſtalde 
                conſidering, that although he ſhould haue all his people to guard him, yet was it little and to ſmall purpoſe to reſiſt the Frier, in caſe he would vſe any treaſon againſt him: wherefore hee iudged it much better to goe ſo priuately, whereby he ſhould outwardly manifeſt the great and ſpeciall truſt he repoſed in him, rather then by a ſtrong guard to giue him ſuſpition and occaſion

to ſtand vpon tearmes, an act which in no ſort he found to bee conuenient for the beginning of ſuch affayres, and ſpecially ſeeing hee had to negotiate  with a man ſo giddie brained, who was almoſt of a childs condition, that for the leaſt toy whatſoeuer, would bee offended and alter his opinion; reſoluing that if he did otherwiſe, he would eaſily eſcape his hands, and all his purpoſes ſhould be ouerthrowne.
            But proceeding on his determinate iourney, in the end he arriued at Albe-iula, where (according to the foreſaid aduertiſement) hee found not the Frier, for that he was yet at Saſſebeſſe with the Queene, vnto whom he was gone, without giuing him any notice thereof. Whereupon thoſe of his companie thought it not amiſſe (ſince the Frier and the Queene were yet together)  that he ſhould goe thither to them, where he might more commodiouſly, and with quicker diſpatch, eſtabliſh many important matters, and ſuch which had neede of preſent and ſudden reſolution: wherefore they counſelled him to goe to Saſſebeſſe, where hee arriued about the third houre of Caſtalde went to ſeeke the Queene, and to declare his charge. the night, finding the Queene accompanied onely with thoſe of her Court, for that a day before, Peter Vicchy (ſeeing he could not conclude any league with the Frier) retired himſelfe to his commaund of Lippa and Themeſuar, with all the men of warre, leauing thus the Queene alone at Saſſebeſſe, in which place two daies after, Caſtalde ſate in councell with Frier George, and many other great Lords of Tranſiluania, where he declared the occaſion of his comming, which was tending to this end; that the Queene ſhould reſtore  that Prouince to Ferdinand, according to the articles concluded with King Iohn her husband, he himſelfe being readie to accompliſh all which his Maieſtie had promiſed, declaring that vpon the accompliſhing of theſe couenants, it could not happen but (beſides the generall contentment that euery one ſhould receiue thereby) all things would ſucceed better and more expedient, and ſpecially to her ſelfe profitable and commodious then to any other, if ſhe would duly conſider with what trauaile and ſorrow ſhe poſſeſſed thoſe countries, and with what ſuſpition and doubt ſhe was maintained amongſt them, onely depending but vpon the Turkes good liking,  who when he thought good might diſpoſſe her, and ſo in fine to bee alwaies in danger to loſe both the one and other. And that therefore knowing Tranſiluania to be the key and bulwarke of all Chriſtendome (as by apparant effect was to be ſeene) which if it were loſt, not only the vtter ruine of the reſt of Hungarie and Auſtria would follow, but alſo of Germanie, and of all other Chriſtian countries. Wherefore for theſe reſpects ſhe ought to deſire, that this Prouince ſhould fall into the gouernment and rule of a Chriſtian Prince, great and puiſſant, as Ferdinand was, who might at all times be a curb againſt the force and violence of the Turke, and might hinder him from further proceedings: and the rather, that ſhe ought to haue ſuch a deſire, for ſo much as ſhe ſaw her ſelfe (though a Queene) yet of no force nor commaund  for ſuch an enterpriſe, neither was ſhe able to promiſe her ſelfe any defence, to maintaine that kingdome, without ſhe craued ayde of others. Therefore all theſe things duly conſidered, it were much better for her to accept of Ferdinands offer, as the moſt ſure and peaceable for her, although it were leſſe, then remaine in continuall danger and trauaile, and to raigne

in a kingdome, which was not in her power to preſerue nor keepe. Beſides  theſe foreſaid agreements, Caſtalde for the more aſſurance and confirmation Offers made to the Queen by Caſtalde in the name of Ferdinand. of both parties, offered the Queene in the name of his Maieſtie the Infanta Ioane his youngeſt daughter, with 100000. Crownes for a dowrie, and to giue her in mariage to her ſonne Iohn, and to enter into bonds to ſatisfie her in euery thing which he promiſed her, and to pay all the intereſt which ſhe could pretend, and in like ſort to ſatisfie all the debts which were found to be due ſince that time. Theſe offers ſeemed generally good, and reaſonable to all, and ſpecially to Frier George, who alſo made ſhew to bee well pleaſed therewith. And after many aduertiſements, it was concluded that he ſhould cauſe the Queene to vnderſtand thereof, and bring an anſwere from her.  This charge was committed to the Frier, who willingly accepted thereof; and being come to the Queene, he recited to her all which had been propounded in the Councell. She being attentiue, and vnderſtanding what had paſſed, and withall conſidering the offer of Ferdinand, and that it was a meanes for her to wade out of that ſubiection, wherein the Frier ſo peremptorily held her: ſhe preſently anſwered, that whatſoeuer he did, ſhe eſteemed it greatly beneficiall to her, committing all her actions and affayres into his hands; of which particularly and by peecemeale they conferred together by the ſpace of fifteene daies. But the Frier continued ſtill without reſolution, now ſaying this, then that, apparantly ſhewing that he had no other reſpect  but to his owne proper commoditie, which he ſhadowed by this, that he fained that herein he aymed at nothing, but that which particularly concerned the Queene and the good of her ſonne, whom he proteſted he loued more then himſelfe, in reſpect of the indiſſoluble bonds of gratitude that forced him to it, which oftentimes hee had receiued from his father King Iohn, who was his raiſer and maker, and of whom depended all which he poſſeſſed in this world, being raiſed by him of nothing, and exalted to this high degree of honour wherein he was now. And thus cunningly did he diſſemble and draw backe the moſt he could.
            As theſe affayres proceeded on in this manner without any reſolution, it happened one day the Queene, without the Friers knowledge, found oportunitie  
               The Queene conferreth with Caſtalde, and complaineth of George. to haue ſome priuate conference with Caſtalde, and in ſuch a conuenient place where ſhe might freely diſcouer and impart the conceptions of her owne minde; aſſuring him what ſingular contentment ſhe receiued, in that Ferdinand King of the Romanes, had ſent ſo ſufficient and worthie a man as hee was, to negotiate in theſe affayres; the vertue and renowne of whom, ſhe had before heard an exceeding good report of, and ſhe thought her ſelfe thrice happie of his comming, greatly commending the choiſe that was made of him, and the iudgement of the King, in giuing him that abſolute authoritie to diſpoſe of things in his name as he thought good of, thinking thereby ſhe ſhould haue occaſion ſpeedily to bring her miſeries to an  end, which vntill then had held her wrapped vp: effectuouſly importuning him that he would giue faith and credit to the integritie of her heart, which had alwaies deſired and endeuoured her ſelfe to doe his Maieſtie ſeruice. And afterward ſhe earneſtly deſired Caſtalde, that for her diſcharge he would amplie aduertiſe his Maieſtie, that for the time paſſed ſhe was not of her ſelfe

withdrawne from the agreements betweene them, but that all proceeded through the Friers ſubtilties, who neuer would agree nor conſent that they  ſhould proceed to the execution of them; but to the contrarie intreated her ſo badly (as ſtill he did) that finding none to whom ſhe might haue recourſe in ſuch neceſſities, ſhe was conſtrained (as being in deſpayre) to demaund ayde of the Turke, of whom ſhe had been many times importuned and incited to leaue that kingdome peaceably vnto him, in exchaunge of another great eſtate, which he offered her, eſpecially ſeeing it was in his power (as he ſaid) to thruſt her out of it. And although ſome great feare might giue her good occaſion to thinke ſeriouſly thereof, yet neuertheleſſe ſhe meant not for all that to offer that diſpleaſure to Ferdinand, eſpecially conſidering  that ſhe was a Chriſtian borne, and that it was not conuenient for her to yeeld to any agreement with a Heathen Prince, ſhe being greatly ſorrowfull for that which was paſt.
            Thus to releaſe her ſelf out of the Friers ſnares (which ſhe reputed a worſe and more intolerable ſubiection, then that of the Turkes) as ſhe had been before conſtrained peaceably to depart from one part of her kingdome, ſo for The Queene yeeldeth her ſelfe to Ferdinand. the like effect, ſhe would now willingly forſake the other, with a reſolute determination to deale with him ſo, that beſides the conſideration of the ſeruice which ſhee meant to performe to Ferdinand, hee ſhould finde great contentment freely by her meanes, thus without any condition to ſurrender  this Prouince, which by force of armes ſhe would neuer haue yeelded to any. And yeelding all things into his Maieſties hands, ſhe would intreate him that he would haue regard to her ſonne, who was a King, a child, and an orphane, for which reſpects he ſhould not refuſe to be a Lord and father to him, and eſteeme of him ſo in regarde of the time to come, as if hee were his naturall ſonne, hauing that particular reſpect and care of him, as ſhe would, and ought to haue of him her ſelfe: and ſpecially acquainting him with the paines and torments whereinto ſhe was fallen, yet withall hauing patience to ſee her ſelfe brought to that low ebbe, that of a great Queene (as in former time ſhe ſaw her ſelfe to be) ſhe was now forſt to become a poore  Lady and a begger, hauing neuer ſince the time ſhe was expulſed Buda, with her ſonne in her armes, and accompanied with a ſmall traine (leauing that towne (by the Friers iugling) in the gouernment of the Turke) receiued any comfort, vntill now that he gaue her occaſion of exceeding conſolation, ſeeing her ſelf now readie to depart out of Tranſiluania, which ſhe would leaue vnder the gouernment of ſuch a King as Ferdinand was, who no doubt would defend it, and neuer loſe it; and who might repute it for no ſmall good fortune, ſeeing ſo voluntarily ſhe ſuffered her ſelfe to bee by him depriued of her kingdome, with ſo ſmall a number of men &amp; Artillerie, of which others with great armies could not diſpoſſeſſe her. Caſtalde in Ferdinands name anſwered her, that hee accepted of her good and ſincere affection,  which ſhe manifeſted in theſe proceedings, more then any rich kingdome whatſoeuer; promiſing her that in all fidelitie and ſinceritie, he would performe all that had been treated of from point to point, and he firmely aſſured her (gaging his word) that his Maieſtie from thence forward, would haue ſuch reſpect to King Iohn, as to his owne children. And for his owne

particular, he offered in all her affayres to remaine her obedient and faithfull  ſeruant, and protector of her cauſe, deſiring no leſſe to ſatisfie her expectation and to pleaſe her, then Ferdinand himſelfe who ſent him thither.
            After ſuch like diſcourſes, they tooke leaue one of another, the Queene retyring to her chamber, and Caſtalde to his lodging. In the meane time the Frier began to practiſe a diſſoluing of all the agreements which already were The deuiſes of George to diſſolue the agreements of the Queen and Caſtalde. but lately propounded, and miſtruſting the diſpoſition and humour of the he Queene, to bring that to better effect which he deſired ſhould happen, would neuer conſent to any concluſion, but deferring it from day to day, buſied his braine about no other things, then trifeling delayes. And that his purpoſe might not bee fruſtrate, and to the end alſo that he might not bee  thought he preſſed ſo much for his owne particular commoditie, as for the good of the Queene and her ſonne; he would that before any other thing, The ſecond agreement betweene Ferdinand and Queene Izabella. they ſhould begin to treate of that which concerned them, that ſo he might at the length perceiue what concluſiō he might make, minding alſo that before any act of renouncing the kingdome to Ferdinand ſhould paſſe, his Maieſtie ſhould be firſt bound to giue and performe to Iohn the Queenes ſonne, a yeerely reuenew of 25000. crownes, to him, his heires, and ſucceſſors, euen as had been alreadie promiſed him, and that out of ſuch eſtates which were free, peaceable, and ſure. Which was preſently accepted of by Caſtalde, and promiſed (notwithſtanding that when ſuch offers were made, Buda was not then loſt, nor other principall places of the kingdome, for the loſſe of which  the Crowne was ſhrodely weakened) there ſhould bee giuen and aſſigned the Dutchie of Oppolia and Rhatibor, which are two pleaſant and fertile countries, abounding in all things which can bee deſired, and are within the Prouince of Slecia. The Frier thinking himſelfe ſatisfied for that point, inſtantly propounded another motion; which was (beſides the agreement offered and decreed vpon for the good of King Iohn) he ſhould pay to the Queene the 150000. crownes, which for her dowrie was impoſed vpon King Iohn her husband: and vntill ſhe was fully ſatisfied and payed it, Ferdinand ſhould be bound to giue her ſome towne in pawne, whither ſhe might retire with her ſonne, and remaine there vntil ſuch time they had performed  all, and put them in poſſeſſion of the aforeſaid States, and diſcharged the ſaid ſumme, with reaſonable intereſt therefore, and in like ſort the reuenew of 25000. crownes which was promiſed. This demaund was alſo agreed vpon, and immediatly ſhe was appointed the towne of Caſſouia, which is one of the greateſt and richeſt in that countrie, wherein ſhe might for her owne commoditie remaine, vntill an abſolute accompliſhment ſhould bee, of all that which had been promiſed.
            After they had concluded and decreed in this manner, of all which appertained George Vayuode of Tranſiluania. to the Queene and her ſonne, the Frier began to negotiate and practiſe for himſelfe, and demaunded that they would beſtow vpon him the  Vayuodſhip of Tranſiluania, with the ſame condition that King Iohn was wont to giue it, which was 15000. crownes by the yeere; which requeſt was graunted him, neuertheleſſe with this condition, that he ſhould haue for his copartner and companion Andrew Battor. But by no meanes he would admit thereof, alleadging that he had alwaies been accuſtomed to commaund

and rule alone, and not accompanied, neither would he receiue into his gouernment an equall, in reſpect it would rather be a charge and burthen to  him, then an honour. In the end, not to diſcontent him in any thing, he had his full asking. He hauing obtained this dignitie, he yet demaunded the Treaſurerſhip, which in former time he executed with ye ordinarie wages of 4000. crownes yeerely: and beſides that, his demaund was that they ſhould allow him aſwell in peace as in warre 1500. horſe for his guard and the countries: 1500. horſe for the guard of George. and further, he deſired to haue the Salt pits at Torde, which were exceeding profitable, and he at that time was in poſſeſſion of them. He motioned this laſt demaund with ſuch craft and ſubtiltie, that he thought thereby to finde ſome iuſt cauſe to fruſtrate the former conference, aſſuredly thinking  they would neuer agree vnto it. But herein his expectation failed him, The cuſtome and maner of Princes. and diſcretion would he ſhould haue credited the contrarie, in reſpect himſelfe was often wont to ſay; That it was requiſite for him who would raigne and gouerne, although he had not the gift to accompliſh them, yet to giue fayre words and promiſes to euery one, and to performe but a little thereof: which well hee might imagine to be practiſed vpon him by Ferdinand, ſince hee ſaw that ſo readily they condiſcended to all that he demaunded. He hauing now obtained all which he deſired, yet could he not thus ſuppreſſe the great thirſt of his couetous and greedie minde, but altering euery houre from the purpoſe, he often repented himſelfe euen in a moment of that which hee had  done, not ſuppoſing that his inconſtancy was any ſhame or diſcredit to him. Caſtalde being one day with him, marueiled greatly at his vncertaintie, and that he was ſo changeable in his proceedings, telling him that he was greatly aſtoniſhed at this his mutabilitie, for that hee ſaw his nature was to ſpeake of one particular matter, at one time this, and another time that, by this meanes cauſing euery one to bee doubtfull, and without any reſolution he deferred the time, vntill he found the occaſion ſuch as hee deſired, and ſeemed fauourable for his affayres.
            Whileſt theſe affayres were thus trauerſed betweene them, one day hee acquainted Caſtalde, that hee greatly deſired to be a Cardinall, and deſiring  him greatly for that purpoſe hee would ſolicite Ferdinand to write to the Pope concerning it. Caſtalde promiſing him his beſt endeuour, ſpeedily aduertiſed his Maieſtie thereof, giuing direct intelligence of the Friers ambition, and of the ſpeciall deſire he had of the Cardinals hat. Ferdinand hauing notice hereof, loſt no time, but preſently diſpatched a meſſenger, writing Ferdinand intreateth the Pope to make George a Cardinall. to Pope Iuly the third, that it would pleaſe his holines to receiue Frier George into the Colledge of Cardinals, amply reciting to him his vertue and proweſſe, and how for many yeeres with his owne forces and induſtrie, hee had defended and maintained the kingdome of Tranſiluania againſt the puiſſance of the Turke, whom he had often foyled; greatly praiſing him, that from an vncredible pouertie (although hee was diſſended of a noble  houſe) he had by his vertue and wiſedome attained to theſe high degrees of honour, wherein he was now inſtalled, in oppoſing himſelfe for the generall good of Chriſtendome againſt the Infidels (as appeared to all the world) as a prouident and valiant Captaine; ſhewing thereby to his holines, that in conſideration of ſuch commendable acts, he well deſerued to be admitted

to that dignitie. He alſo writ to his Ambaſſadours who were at Rome, to vſe the beſt meanes they could to further this ſuite, and to haue anſwer of the  Pope according to his deſire.
            Whileſt this matter was negotiated at Rome, the Archbiſhop of Strigonium George made Archbiſhop of Strigonium. died, by whoſe death the Biſhopricke was voyde, which was yeerely worth 150000. crownes. The Frier omitted no time, but preſently made ſuite for it, which was as readily graunted by Caſtalde in Ferdinands name, to whom hee writ with all ſpeede, praying him that with like diligence hee would ſend him the confirmation thereof, ſeeing they had to deale with ſo variable and inconſtant a man, it was therefore requiſite to make a briefe concluſion, for that in prolonging time to beſtow it of him, and not to yeeld to that which he demaunded, was too much to aduenture and hazard the preſent  affayres. In the end, there remained not any thing for him to demaund more, but onely to bee King, thinking he had now well effected all his affaires, was at laſt content to allow and ratifie the articles made betweene them. Now to conclude or repent that which he had done, was all one to him, inſomuch that euen at the ſame inſtant, he went to the Queene to perſwade George diſſwadeth the Queene from the agreements made with Caſtalde. her, not ſo eaſily to paſſe theſe articles, which were alreadie accorded, telling her ſhe might doe it without bringing her honour and name in queſtion; in ſaying, that ſhe would not depart out of the kingdome, vntill Ferdinand had accompliſhed all that which hee had promiſed: for the reſt hee  would afterwards take it vpon himſelfe, aſſuring her to finde the meanes to diſmiſſe Caſtaldes armie out of Tranſiluania, and to deliuer her out of that ſubiection wherein ſhe was, promiſing her by fayre words, that he would alwaies be faithfull to her, and neuer contrarie her in any thing, further perſwading her, that this kingdome becauſe it was iuſtly come by, did appertaine rather to her ſonne Iohn, then to Ferdinand. Whereto the Queene made no great ſemblance neither with yea nor nay, giuing him thereby to vnderſtand, that it was neither iuſt nor lawfull to halt and diſſemble ſo often in his words: and on the other ſide ſhe told him, that ſhe had committed all her affayres into his hands, from which ſhe rather deſired to be deliuered  then from the Turkes. The Frier not perceiuing himſelfe deceiued by her ſuttle fetch, and conſidering that hee could not worke ſo with Ferdinand, as he had effected with the Queene, and that he ſhould not bee any more of that great commaund in thoſe quarters, as hee had been, began to manifeſt exceeding great contentment of that which in priuate they had agreed vpon, faining afterward, that the Queene would neuer condiſcend to ſuch agreements. But the Queene much doubting that the Frier would not faile to practiſe moſt cunningly that which hee had ſaid to her, cauſed Caſtalde 
               The Queene accuſeth George to Caſtalde. once againe to come and ſpeake with her, aduertiſing him of all which had paſſed betweene her and the Frier ſince the time of their two meetings; plainly telling him, that thoſe whom Ferdinand had choſen for arbitrators in  this buſines, were the moſt oppoſite to his proceedings that poſſible could be, and eſpecially Frier George, who brewed new inuentions to diſſolue all that which had been concluded amongſt them, acquainting him with ſome particulars of his diſpoſition, and inſtructing him of that which was requiſit for him to doe in time to come, that ſo he might the better treate of theſe affayres

with him, againſt the next Diet; becauſe beſides that which he vnderſtood alreadie touching his condition, deceits, and ſubtilties, hee ſhould yet  the further hee went on perceiue more and more: but yet not ſo well as others, who by their experience they haue had of him, haue diſcouered ſuch his deceits. In fine, the Queene for concluſion added, that by no meanes he ſhould repoſe any confidence in him, becauſe that by how much the leſſe he ſhould thinke thereof, by ſo much the more he ſhould finde himſelfe to bee deceiued and ſold.
            The Frier ſeeing his deuiſes ſucceeded not to his liking, was in the end The agreements decreed. content to accept thereof, and conclude all the articles contained in their parley: that is to ſay, that the Queene among other points ſhould depart  out of Tranſiluania within ſixe daies, and retire her ſelfe to Caſſouia. The premiſes being thus determined, notice by writing was giuen to Peter Vicchy, that the Queene would forſake the kingdome, and that alſo ſhe would leaue to Ferdinand the low countries, wherein Lippa and Themeſuar are ſituated, and that they would in recompence therof, giue her in Hungarie, or in ſome other places, ſo much as would ſatisfie and content her. And to the end that this buſines might with better expedition be diſpatched, there was ſafe conduct ſent him, that he might with more ſecuritie, and without any ſuſpition come himſelfe to the Court. Vicchy miſtruſting that it was a traine of the Vicchy repoſeth no truſt in George. Frier to get him into his clutches, and not thinking that the Queene would  ſo ſoone aduance the King of the Romanes, and renounce and depriue her ſelfe of her owne kingdome, (which vntill then ſhe had with many trauailes and cares defended and preſerued): and not daring to come himſelfe in perſon, hee ſent two Ambaſſadours to know in what eſtate and condition the Queenes affayres were. They being come to Saſſebeſſe, they vnderſtood of all the occurrants which had paſſed vntill that day: and it was concluded with them, that ſeeing Peter Vicchy would not otherwiſe come, for his greater ſecuritie, and alſo ſpeedily to remoue all diſtruſt, Andrew Battor ſhould bee ſent to manage thoſe affayres with him. Thus they went together from thence, and Andrew Battor notwithſtanding led with him 2000. horſe for  his guard; and alſo becauſe they vnderſtood that Vicchy daily expected ſuccour from the Turke (to breake all this agreement) who preſently after, as he had aduertiſement of that which the Frier practiſed with Ferdinand, gaue commaund to the Baſha of Buda not to faile, but ayde him. And truly if theſe ſuccours had been arriued before Battor had ſpoken with Vicchy, this peace had neuer been made, neither had they ſpoken any more of it.
            
               Battor being now arriued at Lippa, whileſt he conferred with Vicchy concerning Battor and Vicchy conferre together. the effect of his charge, there departed from Saſſebeſſe a French gentleman, who was called Monſieur de Santon, whom Ferdinand had ſent to be entertained amongſt the Spaniſh companies, he being recommended A French Spie in the armie of Ferdinand, who aduertiſed the Turke of the occurrents of Tranſiluania. to him by the Emperour Charles his brother. This man (as it was reported)  had been a Captaine in France, whither (he ſaid) he would not returne, vntill hee had reuenged certaine iniuries which was offered him; in memorie whereof he wore his haire ſo long, that it reached to his ſhoulders, and ſayd, he would neuer cut it off, vntil he had firſt ſatisfied himſelf with reuenge. Caſtalde had great diſtruſt of him, thinking (as it proued) he was a Spie for the

Turke, and ſent thither by Henry King of France, to the end that hee might  take notice of all occurrances which paſſed in Tranſiluania, to aduertiſe the Turke thereof. And although he liked not, that one whom he ſo much diſtruſted, ſhould bee ſuffered to practiſe and bee familiar amongſt his ſouldiours, yet neuertheleſſe would he not in any ſort diſturbe him, for that he was greatly recommended to him by Ferdinand. Within a while after hee was departed from Saſſebeſſe, it was certainly knowne that hee was a Spie, and what diligence ſo euer was vſed to recouer him, yet hee could not bee found; and at the ſame time came commaund from Ferdinand, that his head ſhould bee cut off, being aduertiſed by the Emperour that he was a Spie for the Turke. In the meane time, while they expected newes of him, hee ſaued  himſelfe at Lippa with Peter Vicchy, to whom he was ſent. Vicchy vnderſtanding the decree, and the proclamation that was made againſt him, and how they ſought him in euery place, gaue aduertiſement to Caſtalde that he was arriued at Lippa, and that if hee ſo pleaſed, hee would ſend him to him: but during this meſſage, he cauſed him ſafely to be conducted with a good guard to Belgrade, from whence he tooke the way directly to Conſtantinople, to aduertiſe the Turke of all which was done in that countrie.
            At the ſame time the day came that was appointed for the Diet to be held A Diet held at Coloſuar, where the Queene reſigned all the royall ornaments to Caſtalde. at Coloſuar, where ſhould haue been all the principall of the kingdome, and where (as it was determined) the Queene ſhould renounce and reſigne to Ferdinand the kingdome, and acknowledge and approue himſelfe King  thereof. After all the Deputies of thoſe Prouinces and townes were arriued, the Queene the 28. of Auguſt departed from Saſſebeſſe, accompanied with all the Knights and Gentlemen of the countrie, and alſo with Frier George and Caſtalde, the one riding on the right hand, the other on the left. Two daies after they were departed, they arriued at an Abbey, diſtant from Coloſuar eight miles, where they lodged; and there it was concluded betweene them, to execute all that which before had been a greed vpon. And the beginning of this ſolemne reſignation, was by the royall ornaments, which were, a Crowne made of plates of gold, mounting on high in forme of a The ornamets of the King of Hungarie. high crowned hat, inriched with ſtones and pearles, and hauing a little croſſe  of gold on the top. The next was a Scepter of Iuorie, garniſhed with gold, and a Mantle of cloath of gold, after the ancient habite in manner of a Veſtment, beſet with many ſtones, but of ſmall value. A gowne, and a payre of ſhooes of gold, which in reſpect of the worke were like to thoſe made for the Apoſtolike Sea. Among all thoſe Iewels, the Frier demanded of the Queene that ſhe would commit the Crowne into his cuſtodie and keeping. Which requeſt ſhe abſolutely denyed him: ſaying, that ſhe would neuer giue her conſent, that a Frier ſhould bee King of that kingdome, whereof ſhe diſpoſſeſſed her ſonne; but ſhe would that they ſhould bee conueied to him, to whom in right that Prouince belonged. And cauſing them to bee brought  before them all, ſhe tooke the Crowne in her hand, in the preſence of the Frier, and many great perſonages, and after great effuſion of teares, from her owne eyes, and from her yong ſonne (who was preſent at the whole action) The ſorrow of Iohn, ſeeing his mother giue ye Crowne to Caſtalde. turning her ſelfe towards Caſtalde, ſayd in Italian, ſuch or the like ſpeeches.
            
               
               Although inconſtant Fortune following her cruell alterations, cutting off and confounding at her pleaſure the affayres of this world, hath in ſuch  ſort ſubuerted mine, that now both my ſonne and my ſelfe are forced to forſake this kingdome, this Crowne, and all theſe other royall ornaments, which in times paſt were belonging to my deare Lord and ſpouſe King Iohn of moſt happie memorie (but now vnhappie that wee bee) and to reſigne into the hands and protection of others: yet notwithſtanding ſhe ſhall not for all this hinder me, but that at the leaſt in my troubles and anguiſhes, I may take this onely contentment, ſeeing them to fall into the hands of a Prince, who is not only a Chriſtian, but alſo ſo puiſſant and benigne, as is the King of the Romanes, whom I repute for my Lord and father, who alſo ſhal  know with what zeale and affection they are giuen him, and whom by our good liking we reeſtabliſh in this State, praying God yt he may enioy it with greater tranquilitie and longer time, then we haue done. And thus Seigneur Iohn Baptiſta Caſtalde, I preſent them into your hands, with intent (of my part) they may bee ſent to his Maieſtie, giuing him to vnderſtand, that wee yeeld him not this kingdome and Crowne, vnder the bond of any condition or couenant whatſoeuer, but freely. And we, my ſelfe and my ſonne, caſt our ſelues into his mercifull armes with all our fortune, beſeeching him he would haue regard of our miſerable deſtinie, which, beſides that wee are Chriſtians, hath cauſed vs to ſpring of royall and princely blood. And that  it would pleaſe him (following his accuſtomed bountie, which maketh him beloued of all the world) to receiue and account of vs for his children, and not denie vs the reliefe, fauour, and protection, which wee hope and expect from him, and which you your ſelfe many times in his name haue promiſed vs.
            
            After theſe ſpeeches of the Queene, her ſonne being yet but young, and Iohn yet a childe manifeſteth not to conſent to the Queene his mother. knowing notwithſtanding how greatly it imported him, to ſee himſelfe depriued of his eſtate, and of that wherwith his father ſometimes was crowned, making ſome reſiſtance, he ſhewed to the Queene his mother the little contentment which he conceiued of this ſurrender, and appartly manifeſted  that he would not conſent thereto.
            
               But the Queene turning her ſelfe towards him, ſayd: Since (O Iohn my deare and tender ſonne) that I know thy fortune and mine is not ſufficient and able to defend this kingdome, without the ayde and helpe of others, by occaſion of the great number of thoſe, who either by enuie, or of ſome certaine malice, or by ſome wicked diſpoſition, make themſelues maſters of others, continually ſearching with the loſſe of the ſame, our ruine and deſtruction: Thou oughteſt not to conceiue ill thereof, if hauing a care rather to publike good, then to our particular profit, which wee cannot maintaine againſt the Turkes power, who by the daily prouocation of our enemies  doth moleſt vs, and in a manner depriue vs of all. Therefore in the middeſt of ſo many aſſaults of miſerie, which fortune hath bequeathed vs, I haue choſen this to be the beſt meanes, to giue and reſigne this kingdome to the King of the Romanes, who will defend and deliuer it from the Turkes violent attempts, and who in recompence will aſſigne thee ſuch eſtates, as he hath promiſed me, for the renouncing which I haue made to him; to the

end that thou maiſt (at the leaſt) yet liue as a great Prince, if thou canſt not  liue like a King: and I haue the rather yeelded to this, as not minding with common loſſe, to bee obſtinate in warre, and to leaue and omit the certaine for the incertaintie in the diſpoſition of Fortune: conſidering alſo the inconſtancie and mutabilitie of her tickle gouernment, which is accuſtomed raſhly to rule and gouerne Kings houſes, which are fallen in diſgrace and contempt with the world, &amp; who oftentimes imprudently and without thinking thereon, ſuddenly doth depriue them of their kingdomes, and ſendeth them into perpetuall exile. Therefore that on my part I may not behold ſuch infelicitie, and not to fall into ſuch an indignitie and miſerie (being forſaken of all ayde and helpe) with the loſſe of the kingdome, I am  eaſily perſwaded with a comfortable hope, to reſerue thee to a perpetuall and quiet repoſe, with a leſſe eſtate and condition, and to take thee out from ſo many troubles, amongſt the which I doe not yet deſpayre, that for a kingdome which thou doeſt now leaue, it may bee in his power that taketh it from thee, to giue thee another, and happely of greater commaund. Let it not ſeeme ſtrange to thee to leaue this kingdome wherein thou wert borne and nouriſhed, being a thing which happeneth to many: but bee aſſured, that by the fauour and dignitie of vertue, a noble courage ſhall neuer be ſo much reiected of fortune, that he ſhall want any States or kingdoms. Therefore for the deliuerie of the poore people, which are afflicted and deſtroyed by our warres; for common repoſe, and for the preſeruation of our  faith, thou oughteſt not to withſtand or gainſay it, but confirming all that, which for thy good I haue yeelded vnto, conſent that theſe princely ornaments bee ſent to his Maieſtie. And although I haue good cauſe to mourne in giuing ouer this Mantle, this Scepter, and chiefly this royall Crowne, (which not long ſince adorned thy fathers head, and which alſo ſhould haue been ſet vpon thine) yet ſhall I not for all that faile but greatly comfort my ſelfe, ſince they fall into the puiſſantnes of a King, who will embrace thee as his owne perſon, and maintaine thee againſt thoſe enemies, who ſecretly (in reſpect of the alienation of thy eſtate) will now reſt ſatisfied, and who (it may bee) in time to come, would notwithſtanding thinke themſelues but  little eaſed thereby, receiuing at the leaſt from God in another world, beſides iuſt puniſhment, that chaſtiſement which they receiued not here, euen as notwithſtanding they had well deſerued by their iniquities and wicked trecheries. Therefore whileſt we are floting in the middeſt of this turbulent ſea, it is requiſite we ſaile with aduiſed patience, as fortune will appoint the winde, and conforme our ſelues to Gods omnipotent pleaſure, ſince that there is no felicitie durable to mortall men, nor any kingdome, nor principalitie permanent.
            
            Hauing ended theſe penitrating ſpeeches, which were of that efficacie to haue mollified a ſtonie heart, and could not be ſpoken without being interrupted,  with many deepe and lamentable ſighs, great comiſſeration and teares of thoſe who were preſent, and eſpecially of Frier George, ſhe gaue the Crowne and the other ornaments to Caſtalde, who kindly and with good words gaue her infinite thankes, as well for the good will he perceiued in her, as alſo for the magnanimitie which ſhe had declared, and for the bountifull

liberalitie by which ſhe did giue vnto Ferdinand this Crowne, and the abſolute entering into this kingdome. And applying comforts to her aduerſities,  he perſwaded her not to attribute the renounciation of this kingdome to her misfortune, ſince ſhe could by no meanes properly ſay, that ſhe loſt it, leauing it to Ferdinand, whom ſhe drew and bound to be a continuall friend, and father vnto her, who would neuer forſake nor leaue her in all her needfull affayres; and incouraging her the more, hee aſſured her that he would intirely and religiouſly keepe it for him, and that he would performe to the vttermoſt all whatſoeuer he had promiſed her. And with this doubtfull hope, the poore afflicted Queene departed to goe towards Coloſuar. 
            
            
               Caſtalde hauing in this manner receiued the Crowne, cauſed it to be carefully kept, being aboue all things by the Kings of Hungarie highly eſteemed, in reſpect of the vulgar opinion which is held thereof in that countrie: the report being, that an Angell brought it from heauen to S. Ladiſlas King The common opinion which is held in Hungarie of the royall Crowne. of Hungarie; and that the King which doth not poſſeſſe it, cannot bee the true nor lawfull King, nor iuridially gouerne the people, nor execute iuſtice to them. Men doe yet ſay further, that if by chance this Crowne ſhould by ſome caſualtie be loſt, and found by any whoſoeuer, although hee were the pooreſt in the world, preſently without any other triall, he ſhould be created King, and they ſhould ſweare fealtie and homage to him, as to their lawfull and vndoubted King. But whether this be true or no, I know not; yet vpon  this opinion, the Turkes haue a ſpeciall deſire to get it within the compaſſe of their cuſtodie, as alſo Frier George had. All the Gentlemen and Lords who were preſent at the deliuerie of this Crowne, iudged that which the Queene had done, was of no ſmall importance, eſteeming the validitie of the Crown to be of equall price with the kingdome it ſelfe.
            For this reſpect Caſtalde cauſed it continually to bee kept in his chamber with great vigilancie, vntill with a good conuoy he ſent it to Ferdinand, by The Crowne of Hungarie ſent to Ferdinand. the Lord Iohn Alpohnſe Caſtalde Peſcaire, his nephew. The Queene being arriued at Coloſuar, Caſtalde alſo arriued there within a while after, where he remained certaine daies, attending thoſe who ſhould be there, and that were  called to the Diet, to know what their affection was to the King of the Romanes, and to confirme them in their good deuotion, and to ſatisfie the Queene of that which was promiſed her; to appeaſe all the tumults which was amongſt them, and to incite them to take armes againſt the Turke, and chaſe them from thoſe parts, vnderſtanding they would once againe attempt to enter thereinto. And after they were all arriued and aſſembled together, Caſtalde acquainted them with all the paſſed proceedings, whereof euery one was well contented. And if peraduenture there were ſome, yea, and of the chiefeſt, to whom it ſeemed not good what the Queene had  done, yet durſt they not make ſhew to the contrarie, for that Ferdinands part was then the ſtrongeſt. And thus they all with one accord did ſweare fealtie The Hungarians ſweare fealtie to Ferdinand. to his Maieſtie, manifeſting great ioy to ſee themſelues returned vnder the gouernment of their natural Lord and King, to whom of right that kingdome belonged. And although Caſtalde diſcouered the affections of many (who rather inclined to the amitie and league of the Turke, then to that of

the King) yet faining notwithſtanding to reduce and bring all to his deuotion,  and to ſhew them the inconuenience of the amitie and friendſhip of the Turke, and how hurtfull and preiudiciall it would bee to them, with a ſpeech as eloquent, as his countenance and cariage was graue, hee vſed to them this oration.
            
               I haue alwaies eſteemed it (Lords, and chiefe Commanders of this kingdome) to be a thing very conuenient and neceſſary, not to ſpeake at any time for any grace or friendſhip, which we haue purchaſed from other men; nor for the fauour which wee haue, or hope to receiue from them; nor for any inſtinct which we haue towards any: but only ſincerely to explaine and declare what we take to bee good and praiſe worthie, as well for the particular, as publike benefit; and not at any time to perſwade any thing which is not  both reaſonable, iuſt, and holy, as well before God as men; which I for mine owne part haue practiſed as much as hath bin poſſible for me, and (by Gods aſſiſtance) will alwaies do it, chuſing rather the good and glorie of the King (your Lord and mine) and the publike and generall quiet, then my owne proper life, as this day I meane to manifeſt to you, not minding to doe any thing, but that which ſhall bee ſitting for the office of a louer of peace and publike tranquilitie, who ought not to omit vnſpoken any ſpeech, that may bee neceſſarie for the good and ſafetie of this countrie and kingdome, although with his owne proper blood, he ſhould not faile to ſuſtaine and aſſiſt it. Now, conſidering the preſent eſtate and condition into which you  are fallen, by the ſecret hatreds which raigne amongſt you one towards an other, and by the diſſentions ſprung amongſt you, and your former Lords: by occaſion whereof you haue called the Turke to your ayde, and haue brought him into this countrie, with the ruine, not onely of the vulgar people, but alſo of your ſelues, and haue ſhewed him an open high way for the time to come, in a moment to be maſters of you, he practiſing towards you that which he did to the Paleologians, Comins, Buccals, and other of the principall of Greece, who for their conceiued hatreds, thinking by the Turkes ayde wholly to baniſh and expulſe their Emperour, did not only ruinate the Empire, but alſo loſt their owne goods, honours, themſelues, and liues, the  Turkes being allured with the goodlines and fertilitie of the countrie, and faining to fauour or ſupport the diſcords of one faction or other, learning to make war after their maner, &amp; hauing therewith in ſuch diligent obſeruance, noted the ſituation and paſſages of their countrie, that with little labour they thruſt in vpon them, with ſuch multitude and force, that after they had ſeene their young infants, their deare ſiſters, their beloued wiues and kindred to be prayes and ſlaues enchained; their townes burnt and deſtroyed, the countrie harried, and the common people made ſlaues, and they forced to flye and ſeeke other Prouinces to inhabite, wherein liuing in calamity they were forced to end their miſerable life; of Lords to become ſeruants, and of libertie  to be in the thraldome of ſubiection, which is the greateſt miſerie and calamitie of all, and ſurely which in all the world hath not his like; being too painfull and intolerable a burthen, that a free man, fortunate, and rich, ſhould become a ſeruant, miſerable, afflicted, and begging to ſatisfie his neceſſitie. All which miſchiefes had aſſuredly happened to you, if Gods goodnes, and

the bountie of the King had not foreſeene it, opening the eyes of your vnderſtanding, to remember the paſſed glorie and renowne which your Kings  haue vndoubtedly atchieued, by the victories and triumphs obtained againſt the Turkes. Conſidering, I ſay, this your poore ſtate, and knowing that you are not ignorant with what abilitie and force I am come hither, and how his Maieſtie hath ſent me with an armie, to take care and charge of this Prouince, and to ſuccour and aſſiſt it in her afflictions, and by your friendly ayde to deliuer it out of the hands of Infidels, our common enemies; I haue eſteemed it neceſſarie to declare vnto you, that you ought to ſweare fidelitie to Ferdinand your King and Lord, with ſuch homage as you are bound to performe, and to perſwade you, that you ought ſo much the more to ſettle  your ſelues in his fauour and clemencie, who will imbrace you not as his ſubiects, but will place you in his boſome, as his naturall and deare children, in ſuch affectionate manner, that you may ſay, you haue rather gotten a father, then a Lord, who will not faile to aſſiſt you in your neceſſities, nor forſake you in all chances of fortune, counting himſelfe happie if they be ſuch: and on the other ſide, deeming himſelfe wretched with you, if it ſhould ſucceede otherwiſe (which God defend it ſhould) ſeeing the fortune of men is variable and more mutable then the waues of the ſea, and ſubiect to infinite hazards. But he eſteeming you as deare as his owne members, it behoueth not you therefore to giue any credit to the diſſembling promiſes of  Infidels; nor to the inticing perſwaſion of thoſe who little affect your good, and leſſe your quiet; nor by the inſtigation of thoſe, who ſecretly practiſeth your ruine, and would ſeparate you from the bodie, of which depende the common health and life: but rather, it is needfull that you vnite and incorporate your ſelues into one reſolute minde, and by that meanes valiantly redoubling your forces, you may ſhew your ſelues ſuch, that in oppoſing your ſelues couragiouſly, you may bee able to chaſe out of this kingdome, thoſe enemies who violate our Religion, diſhonour your Churches, force your Virgins, and with as much poſſible wickednes as they can imagine, defame your wiues and children, neuer obſeruing any faith. After this your  manifeſt and couragious fidelitie, it behoueth that you deliberate and conſult with me for the publike libertie (although it bee a thing that ſeemeth daungerous) to denounce warre againſt them, which being iuſtly and diſcreetly managed, will promiſe to vs victorie, and immortall glorie with them that ſhall ſucceede vs, who learning of vs to eſteeme honour and glorie, (more deare then their liues) will freely chooſe rather to die fighting for faith and libertie, then to bee as prayes to theſe inhumane Barbarians, liuing in continuall diſhonour. And if theſe reaſons are not ſo perſwaſiue, nor yet of that force to moue your courages, yet ought they at leaſt to make them tremble, by reaſon of the horrible cruelties you ſhall receiue when the Turke ſhall become your Lord: for aſſure your ſelues you ſhall not for all  that enioy any great content or quiet, but euen daily your ſorrowes and griefes will be redoubled with great and tedious impoſitions, for that he will not ſatisfie himſelfe with an ordinarie and reaſonable tribute: but with an abſolute commaund hee will take away the deareſt of your children, forcing them to denie our faith, and to forget both the father and mother,

who haue begotten, produced, and brought them vp; and will nouſle them  among his Ianiſaries, to increaſe by that meanes their wicked and heatheniſh opinion, and ouerthrow and ſuppreſſe ours, which is grounded vpon the blood of our deare Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. And beſides, if you haue a fayre yong daughter, who is of ſeemely and well fauoured countenance, and enriched and adorned with vertue, ſhe ſhall preſently bee taken from you, and put into the Serraile, to ſatisfie the vnſatiable luſt and incontinencie of this abominable Tyrant, who cōtinually will aſpire to no other thing, then wholly to extirpate and ruinate you, and to make you in the end to become his ſeruants and perpetuall ſlaues, purloyning from you the beſt of whatſoeuer you haue, and the remainder of all which ſhall be left vnto you by your anceſtors:  neither can you ſay any thing in defence of your ſelues, nor contradict them, which if you do, or make any ſhew of diſcontent, then ſhal you be ſtraight in preſent danger of your life. Conſider by this and firmly impreſſe it, what theſe calamities are, and how horrible and grieuous the effects be. Awake, awake therefore, I ſay, your drowſie ſpirits, and waite not vpon a vaine deſire, &amp; vpon a ſwelled pride, ſo willingly to yeeld your ſelues vnder ſo miſerable a ſeruitude, yea much worſe then death it ſelfe: but valiantly oppoſe your vttermoſt abilities againſt ſuch enterpriſes, and giue not occaſion to others to call you tyrants: for ſurely not onely he is a Tyrant, who is the cauſe of another mans ſeruitude, but alſo he who is able to oppoſe himſelfe againſt the violence of another, and yet maketh no reſiſtance. Call together with  you all the Sicilians and Tranſalpinians, making a league with your neighbours, and with thoſe of whom in time you may hope for ſuccour and ayde, and in defending your ſelues, offend the enemie; this being no diſhoneſt thing nor worthie of blame, for defence of your ſelues, to enter into league with any ſtraunge nation whatſoeuer. And reſolue and vnite your ſelues quickly in one, conſidering that in the occurrances and aduentures of warre, too long remiſſenes increaſeth more detriment then profit. And by ſuch a ſudden determination, doing that which in reaſon and courage ought to be done, you ſhall manifeſt to your King a quicknes of ſpirit, and declare how much your hearts are cleere and cleane, as well in proſperitie as in aduerſitic,  thoſe onely meriting to bee reputed truly couragious, and of a firme reſolution, who perfectly diſcerning troubleſome things, and things that are pleaſant one of them from another, not doubting at any hand any perill, nor withdrawing themſelues from the ſeruice of their Lord, as I aſſure my ſelfe you will not doe; making full account of this, that hauing before your eyes the pregnant experience of euils paſſed, and deeply thinking on the preſent labours, you will rather make choiſe to loſe your liues by a iuſt and honourable warre, then liue with a vile peace and an infamous quiet.
            
            Theſe ſpeeches animated Frier George, with all the reſt and chiefeſt of Tranſiluania, preſently to yeeld themſelues (knowing the veritie of the  cauſe) to the Kings ſeruice, and he offered himſelfe with them altogether to his deuotion, acknowledging him for their true Lord and King. The firſt who did ſweare fealtie, were the Saxons and Sicilians, neuertheleſſe with this condition, that he would confirme and obſerue their priuiledges. Their chiefe Commaunder among them, named Ladiſlas Endef, was then greatly

recommended, becauſe hee had induced them to ſuch their acknowledgement. And they deliberating together vpon the warre, that they meant to  take againſt the Turke, (who, as it was ſaid, would come and aſſaile them) it was concluded that they ſhould ſend (as they had alreadie done through all the Prouinces) and publiſh that euery man ſhould be in a readines vpon the firſt ſommons that ſhould be giuen them, to march againſt the common enemie. During this time, and whileſt theſe things were diſcourſed of, Ferdinands 
               The ratifying of Ferdinand vpon the agreements. packet of letters arriued, by which hee confirmed and ratified all that which Caſtalde had promiſed and agreed vpon with the Queene and Frier George. And beſides, gaue thereby further authoritie to Caſtalde, that if poſſible it could be done by a Proctor or Deputie, to celebrate the eſpouſals betweene the Infanta Ioane his daughter, and Iohn the Queenes ſonne; which  
               The betrothing of the Infanta Ioane the daughter of Ferdinand, with Iohn the ſonne of the Queene. within a ſhort time euen in the very ſame place was after performed, with great ioy and contentment of all the kingdome, being the generall opinion, that this new aliance and agreement made betweene theſe Kings, would bring forth among them a perpetuall quiet.
            Theſe affayres being thus decreed and concluded, the day following, which was the 9. of September, the Queene departed from Coloſuar, with a conuoy of 400. Hungarian horſe, which Caſtalde ſent with her, accompanying The departure of the Queene out of the kingdome with teares and ſorrow. her himſelfe from that place two miles, which maketh foure French. The Queene being thus accompanied and in a Coach with her ſonne (who was very ſicke) and trauailing on her iourney, ſhe that day plainly manifeſted the  great ſorrow and extreame diſcontent which ſhe felt, to ſee herſelfe depriued of her kingdome, and by agreement to leaue her owne, and to ſearch after another mans, which was very apparant to euery one, by the mournfull plaints and deepe ſighs which ſhe powred out, together with abundance of teares falling from her eyes (true witneſſes of her ſorrow and diſtreſſe). They being all come to a way which led on two hands, the Queene and her ſonne tooke leaue of Caſtalde, not without great redoubling of ſorrow and teares, the one returning towards Coloſuar, the other proceeding on their iourney towards Caſſouia. 
            
            Scarſe was the Queene departed, but newes was brought her that Peter Vicchy had agreed with Andrew Battor, into whoſe cuſtodie he had alreadie Vicchy yeeldeth the low countries to Battor. yeelded Lippa and Themeſuar, with Becch, Becherech, and Chinad, and all the other Caſtles which were vnder his gouernment, not being willing before to come to this agreement, vntill hee was acertained by the Queenes letters, of all which had paſſed vntill then. And after he had thus yeelded his whole commaund, hee ſet forward on the way towards the Queene, to accompanie her to Caſſouia. Whileſt he was proceeding on his iourney, Battor entered into the ſaid townes, and taking ample and ſure poſſeſſion of them, furniſhed thē with a garriſon of ſuch ſouldiours, as he had drawne out  of certain Fortreſſes, and who for that purpoſe he had brought with him, being 800. Aiduchs, who are footmen bearing Halberts, Curaſſes, Bowes, Arrowes, Crosbowes, and Sables, and 300. horſe. With this warlike companie he greatly aſſured the countrie, ſpecially becauſe the Caranſebanſſes, the Lugaſiens, and the Rathians (people very puiſſant) were reduced vnder the obedience of Ferdinand, and had declared that they were content to liue vnder

his Maieſties deuotion, and to ſerue him in all occaſions of warre which  ſhould be offered.
            The affayres of Lippa and Themeſuar being thus with diligence diſpatched, Caſtalde thought then he had fully effected his moſt important buſines; becauſe that whileſt theſe two Fortreſſes were not yet vnder the gouernment of Ferdinand, men thought, that that which he had negotiated before, was to little or no purpoſe, for that thoſe two places were of great importance, Lippa and Themeſuar townes of importance. and ſpecially Lippa, which was eſteemed and reputed the key and port of all Tranſiluania. The ſame, beſides it was of great importance, was exceeding profitable and commodious, and therefore neceſſarie to be more carefully maintained and kept, in reſpect of the great reuenewes which come  from thence, becauſe it is the Port where al the veſſels of ſalt are laden, which is tranſported by the riuer Maroſſe through all Hungarie, and is a marchandiſe of the beſt and greateſt trafficke diſperſed into all thoſe countries. Frier George demanded this toll of the King, importuning that his Maieſtie would giue it him: but afterward the King vnderſtanding it was yeerely worth 300000. Florins, hee would not intirely giue it him; but yet hee had it at a reaſonable rate, although the other would not ſo accept thereof: and becauſe he was not willing to giue him any occaſion to complaine of him, hee liberally George had the third part of the toll of ſalt. gaue him the third part thereof. All Tranſiluania being reduced vnder the obedience of Ferdinand, and the Marqueſſe of Balaſſe, and Francis Chendy, men of ſpeciall authoritie and credit in their countrie, being alſo entered  into amitie with him: Bernard Aldene Campe-maſter of the Spanyards, deſired Bernard Aldene a Spanyard, ſent to to commaund Themeſuar and Lippa. 
               Caſtalde, that ſince hee would ſend other Captaines for the defence of Themeſuar and Lippa, that it would pleaſe him to ſend him thither, being the rather deſirous to goe, for that he vnderſtood he would ſend Spanyards thither. Caſtalde was therewith well content, and preſently diſpatching him, he gaue vnto him 300. Spanyards, and ſent with him Captaine Rodrigo Vigliandrando, who then was come to the ſeruice of Ferdinand, during this expedition, and who was by the ſame Aldene, earneſtly deſired to haue him in his companie, and that to the end that he might aſſiſt him both by his vertue and good aduice in any Martiall affayres, for that he was a man of truſt, experienced,  and very deſirous of honour. Being thus diſpatched, hauing with them two peeces of Artillerie, they ſet forward on the way from Coloſuar, drawing towards Themeſuar, which according to the iudgement of all, was of greateſt importance, taking with them diuers Ingenors, to fortifie and repayre the other places which were of leaſt ſtrength. On the other ſide they cauſed to fortifie and ſtrengthen Sibinio, Albe-iula, and Saſſebeſſe, which are townes ſituated vpon little hils in the middeſt of great plaines, and which with little coſt would bee made impregnable. Caſtalde cauſed theſe fortifications to bee repayred, to no other end, but onely to ſtop the Turkes incurſions, in caſe he would enter into the kingdome; and that in the meane time  he might make other prouiſion and haue commoditie, to expect the ſuccours which Ferdinand ſhould ſend him, if need ſo required. And for that in the late Diet of Coloſuar, the Tranſiluanians being for that particular cauſe required to ayde Ferdinand with certaine ſummes of money, they had excuſed themſelues in reſpect of the great pouertie of the countrie, which was an

occaſion they could not contribute thereunto: therefore by the commaund The reuenews of the Biſhopricks employed to the fortification of the countrie. of the King it was ordained, that all the reuenewes of the Biſhoprickes in  Tranſiluania, with the Biſhopricke of Agria, ſhould bee employed for the charges of ſuch fortifications.
            Whileſt theſe things were thus in doing, the Frier made ſemblance as though he had been very glad thereof, but eſpecially becauſe he had thruſt out the Queene before him: and thinking that his purpoſes had at the beginning taken good effect, hee hoped (as it many times chaunceth to men who often deceiue themſelues in their owne affayres) that alſo the middeſt and the end would ſucceede fortunately, as his owne conceits had alreadie promiſed him. Now the Frier knowing that hee had greatly offended the  Turke, in bringing Ferdinand into this Prouince, hee endeuoured by all meanes to cleere himſelfe thereof, and againe to creep into his former grace George ſeeketh againe the fauour of the Turke. and fauour. Thus by his ſubtilties thinking to hold Ferdinand in one ſleeue, and the Turk in another, and to content them both, he meant now to kindle that, which afterward in the end hee could not extinguiſh. And to execute this his intention, he departed from Coloſuar to go to a Caſtle of his owne, which he had built from the ground, named Wiuar. He had giuen order that there he would meete the Chiauſs, which the Turke ſent to receiue the tribute which that Prouince yeerely payed him, to the end they might liue in peace. The Chiauſs was alreadie arriued at this Caſtle, whileſt they negotiated  all the premiſed affayres. And the Frier cauſed him to be ſo priuately, yet well entertained, that none could ſpeake with him, which he did in this reſpect, for feare that any ſhould aduertiſe him of what had paſſed. For this cauſe he appointed him to bee lodged and friendly vſed in this place as the moſt commodious, being more ſolitarie and leſſe frequented of waies, then any other in the kingdome. The Frier being arriued at this place, preſently cauſed many ſports and rich preſents to bee ſhewed and giuen to this Chiauſs, with ſumptuous entertainment, and after he ſent for Caſtalde, who preſently came thither, and by their generall agreement and conſent, he payed the tribute to the Turke, the time being almoſt expired, in which the ſaid tribute  ſhould be payed; and the truce yet continued, during which, it ſeemed Tribute payd to the Turke by the Tranſiluanians. not good to Caſtalde (and ſpecially at that time) to giue the Turke any other occaſion to infringe or breake it, then that he had alreadie done, which was, in lifting him out of Tranſiluania; which he meant not to doe for many reſpects, and ſpecially becauſe he had a purpoſe with ſpeede to prouide for the fortifications of the places before mentioned; and becauſe that in the meane while hee meant to gaine the good wils of the ableſt and mightieſt men in the countrie, and to increaſe himſelfe both with men and money to maintaine and keepe it: but fortune would not ſuffer that he ſhould long enioy his deſire. For being one night at ſupper with the Frier, newes was brought The Turkes in field to take the Queene. him, that by the commaund of Achmeth Baſha, there was gone out of Buda  3000. horſe to aſſay to take the Queene, her ſonne, and the Crowne of the kingdome, which was ſent to Ferdinand, aſſuredly thinking that ſhe would carrie it with her as a precious Iewell. But ſhe (as good fortune was) tooke the way towards Caſſouia, going in the pooreſt habite and painfulleſt trauaile The miſerie of Queene Izabella. that could bee imagined, not any thing diſſembling the extreame

griefe which ſtill heauily oppreſt her. To her vttermoſt abilitie ſhe manifeſted  this her immeaſurable affliction, which hourely gnawed and ſorely diſtempered her minde. Inſomuch that one day paſſing a mountaine, which ſeparateth Tranſiluania from Hungarie, and going downe the ſide thereof, which was very rough and tedious, by which ragged way her Coach could not paſſe, ſhee was conſtrained (during a great ſhewer) to goe on foote, and downe that ſide with her children and Ladies, and that not without great labour. Walking in this ſort, ſhe greatly complained her ſelfe of her aduerſe fortune, who not contenting to be contrarie and oppoſite to her in great and waightie things, would yet afflict her in ſmall and meane matters. And attributing this ſorrow and diſcontent of minde, which vntimely happened  to her, to the wickednes of her deſtinie, ſhe tooke a knife, and with the point thereof (to eaſe a little her vntolerable griefe) writ in the barke of a great tree (vnder which ſhe was retired to repoſe and ſhrowd her ſelfe from the raine, which powred downe amaine) theſe Latin words; Sic fata volunt, 
               So the Deſtinies will haue it, Izabella the Queene. and vnderneath it, Izabella Regina, which is as much to ſay, Ainſi le veulent les Deſtinées, Izabella Royne. After ſhe had engrauen theſe words, ſhe againe preſently tooke her Coach and proceeded on her iourney, and arriued in The Queene arriued at Caſſouia. ſafetie at Caſſouia, making by that meanes the Turkes ſallie out of Buda vaine and friuolous, who knew not what to doe, for that ſhe tooke another way more vnuſual and leſſe frequented, and quite differing from that which they were of opinion ſhe would take: but the Queene being exceeding  prouident and of good iudgement, preuented the Turkiſh ſubtilties, eſcaped their ambuſcadoes, and fell not into their hands. And thus (by Gods prouidence) altering her way, ſhe diſgraced Achmeths friuolous enterpriſe, and his followers found little contentment of their laborious deſires.

            THE FOVRTH BOOKE OF THE HISTORIE OF HVNGARIE.
            
               THE ARGVMENT OF THE FOVRTH BOOKE.
               SOlyman prepareth an army to inuade Hungary, and George (Vayuode of Tranſiluania) leauieth forces againſt him. Themeſuar ſummoned by the Turkes, and diuers townes with Lippa is yeelded to them. Themeſuar beſieged by the Turk, but he raiſeth his forces and retireth from thence. George is vehemently ſuſpected by Ferdinand, who ſent aduertiſements to Caſtalde to kill him. The towne of Lippa beſieged and taken by Caſtalde, but the Caſtle held out, and George endeuoureth to ſaue Oliman, who was Gouernour thereof, who in the end vpon compoſition departed in ſafetie from thence: but was ſet vpon by our men, who were ouerthrowne by him. Aldene made Gouernour of Lippa. The conſpiracie of George, his death, who was ſlaine at Buiſe; his buriall, and his moueables ſeized vpon to Ferdinands vſe, for whoſe death the Sicilians began to mutine: but were appeaſed by Chendies wiſedom.
               
            
            
               AFter that the agreement paſſed betweene Ferdinand King of the Romanes, and Queene Izabella was ended and concluded, and that the Queene peaceably leauing the kingdome, was wholly freed out thereof; the Tranſiluanians for two cauſes thought happely  to liue a long time in a peaceable tranquilitie, and to haue brought to fortunate iſſue, the bitter afflictions which they in former time, with many perturbations, ſorrowfully endured. The firſt whereof was, becauſe they ſaw the ſonne of King Iohn in league with the now preſent King, and to haue taken in mariage the Infanta Ioane his daughter, which aliance and amitie did indifferently miniſter to euery one an aſſured expectation of a perpetuall and quiet repoſe, and that in time, by meanes of Ferdinands clemencie and bountie, the way ſhould not altogether be taken from Iohn one day, to reenter againe into that kingdome. The other was, that for the late ſuſtentation which by theſe new  agreements happened to them, they thought themſelues ſo ſufficiently aſſured in abilitie, that the Turk for feare of the puiſſant authoritie of Ferdinand, and of the Emperour Charles his brother, durſt neuer more, or at the leaſt not ſo often as hee had done, moleſt and ſpoyle them: but on the contrarie, in

conſideration of this he would greatly feare and doubt them: ſo that by this  meanes they ſhould haue time and leiſure to fortifie and ſtrengthen the paſſages, and furniſh the low countrie townes in ſuch warlike manner, that they ſhould neuer hereafter ſtand in dread of the Ottoman violence.
            But fortune not minding to ſatisfie their expectation, vnhappely ſhuffled all the cardes in their hands, and altered that ſweete deſire of peace, into a trembling feare and ſuſpition of warre. For this Frenchman (of whom wee haue before ſpoken) being arriued at Conſtantinople, declared how he fled from Saſſebeſſe, vpon ſuſpition that he was a Spie for the King of France; and being retired to the grand Seigniour, informed him of all that which had paſſed betweene Ferdinand and the Queene. Solyman now knowing Solyman prepareth an armie to muade Hungarie. 
                that to bee true, which vntill then hee would not beleeue, commaunded with expedition to leauie an armie to ſend into Tranſiluania, vnder the conduct of the Belerbey of Greece, to whom hee gaue commaund, that with all diligence hee ſhould with 12000. horſe repayre vnto Belgrade, where the whole armie ſhould bee ioyned and vnited together, which ſhould bee ſent him by the Sangiacs lying there about, and that hee ſhould enter and aſſaile this Prouince on both ſides: on the one ſide by the helpe and aſſiſtance of the Vayuode of Moldauia; and on the other, by the ayde of the Baſha of Buda, and that he ſhould with his vttermoſt abilitie endeuour himſelfe to conquer it, and leauie ſuch a maſſe of his people, and ſo continually imploy  them, that Ferdinand ſhould haue no time to preuent it, norfortifie himſelfe there.
            
               Caſtalde hauing notice of this by ſpeciall aduertiſement, in the greateſt haſte he could, muſtered his men of warre, and began to perſwade with the Frier, that he ſhould prepare his forces to incounter the enemie, and giue preuention the beſt he could to the ſiniſter chances which ſhortly might enſue, becauſe that they were not able to prouide for the time. The Frier greatly dreading the Turke, in reſpect hee was vehemently incenſed againſt him, for his former proceedings: anſwered (diſſembling his thoughts) Caſtalde, that hee would not faile him in any furtherance. But on the other ſide hee George negotiateth with the Baſhnes. cunningly practiſed his attonement with the enemie, to whom faining to  write for the good and behalfe of Ferdinand, he onely writ for his owne ſafetie and commoditie, and ſending certaine preſents to Roſtan Baſha, and to him of Buda, to draw and allure them to his friendſhip, he aſſayed as much as he could to ſhake the blame from himſelfe: ſaying, that if the Turke ſhould ſend an armie into Tranſiluania to conquer it, becauſe they had put the King of the Romanes into poſſeſſion thereof, that for that purpoſe he neede not ſend thither, ſeeing that all was done by the Queene, and not by him; who had alreadie maried her ſonne Iohn with Ferdinands daughter, to whoſe Lieutenants alſo ſhe had freely, and from the perſwaſion of her owne opinion, intirely relinquiſhed her countrie and crowne, and her ſelfe was retired  to Caſſouia: and that for theſe reaſons it was to no great purpoſe to ſend an armie to deſtroy the kingdome and ſpoyle the poore inhabitants, who were vtterly ignorant and guiltleſſe of the ſaid facts: and promiſed that hee would herein ſo carefully trauaile, that he would chaſe from thence all thoſe

ſouldiours and men of warre which Ferdinand had ſent thither, and that he would continually pay the ordinarie tribute, and that according to ſuch order  as before was promiſed, and as they had alreadie begun to pay it: and further writing many other reaſons for his excuſe: and alſo to confirme this his deuice, he cauſed likewiſe certaine of the principalleſt of the kingdome, priuately to write to the ſaid Baſhaes to approue all that which he had ſaid. Yet would it not induce the Belerbey to deſiſt from marching on with his The Turks armie in Hungarie. troupes, which he brought with him from Conſtantinople. He being arriued at Belgrade, he began to muſter and aſſemble his Campe, and after hauing prepared certaine bridges ouer Danubius, he paſſed to the other ſide, and went to lodge by the riuer Tibiſcus, vpon which he alſo cauſed likewiſe another bridge to bee made, and from thence paſſing on a long, he came  neere to a Caſtle named Becche, ſituated almoſt vpon the riuers ſide. In the next plaine he pitched his Campe, and from thence gaue aduertiſement to all the neighbour Prouinces which were ſubiect to the Turke, that they ſhould not faile, but preſently ſend him men and horſes, ſuch as they are bound to ſend in the like affayres.
            Whileſt the Belerbey buſied himſelfe to gather the reſt of his Campe, Caſtalde commaunded Aldene the Maſter of the Campe (who then was in the low countries for the defence and aſſurance thereof) that Stephen Lozonſe, a famous Knight among the Hungars, ſhould with George Sotede enter into Lozonſe Lieutenant for Ferdinand at Themeſuar. Themeſuar with 600. horſe, for the guard and defence thereof. And further,  for the better aſſurance of the ſame, he commaunded that Aldene himſelfe ſhould enter thereinto with all the Spanyards which he had, making Lozonſe Gouernour of thoſe countries, and Generall ouer all the warlike affayres. He with Aldene cauſed Themeſuar and other places to be fortified with the beſt defences they could: and knowing that the enemie was alreadie in the field, they daily laboured to fortifie the towne with Rampiers and Bulwarkes of good ſufficient ſtrength, giuing aduertiſement of all things which he heard or they did to Andrew Battor, who was then at Lippa. Battor ſeeing the neceſſitie of the time that vrgently preſſed euery one, began to leauie as many Battor at Lippa. men as he could, inſtantly ſoliciting all the people of his Prouince, and admoniſhing  them, that euery one ſhould ayde him againſt the common enemie. He alſo drew to him the principall Lords of the Rhatians, not in reſpect to aſſiſt him with their powers, but for that they ſhould not bee inuited to the ſeruice of the Belerbey, knowing their inconſtancie to bee ſuch, that they would affect and take part with the ſtrongeſt. And hauing thus by all good meanes drawne them to him, and cauſing them to ſweare fealtie to Ferdinand: that he might yet winne their good likings the more, he entertained 4000. of them into pay, with many Captaines, who voluntarily offered to be alſo entertained into Ferdināds ſeruice, as the others were. And hauing  with great diligence leauied 15000. men, who were moſt horſemen, he preſently with theſe troupes put himſelfe into the field, and went and lodged beneath Lippa, expecting there what the enemie was determined to doe, who alſo was incamped betweene the two aforeſaid riuers. Caſtalde at the ſame time diligently ſuruaied and munitioned the fortifications, and ſpecially

the frontier townes of Tranſiluania, as he ſaw was moſt needfull. And  being acertained yt the Belerbey would come to Themeſuar, he ſent another companie of Spanyards thither, and money to pay the Rhatians, whom hee knew were variable and inconſtant, and ſuch as were needfull to be entertained with many and often payes, which happely would procure them from reuolting. On the other ſide, he vſed his beſt labour to prouoke Frier George, 
               George, Vayuoyde of Tranſiluania, raneth his armie againſt the Turks. that inſtantly (as being Vayuode) hee ſhould aſſemble all the ſouldiours of the kingdome, to march with them and relieue Themeſuar, commaunding Andrew Battor that he ſhould ſend to Lozonſe as many men as he could, wherby he might hinder and withſtand the Belerbey from the paſſage of Tibiſcus. The Frier was very ſlow, and fearefull to leauie the inhabitants of the  countrie, hauing before commaunded that none ſhould ſtirre, without his appointment &amp; expreſſe command, aſſuring them that the Belerbey would not paſſe Tibiſcus, and that it was not needful of ſuch an aſſemblie, which he the rather aſſured himſelfe of, in regard of the letters which he had alreadie ſent to the Turk and Baſhaes. But after hauing certaine notice, that hee prepared two bridges vpon Tibiſcus, hee went preſently to Deua, leauying thereabouts 3000. horſe, and with thoſe hee incamped in the field, and preſently writ to all the townes, that they ſhould with all expedition ſend ſuch men as they were bound by their cuſtome to furniſh, which was willingly executed with great celeritie. 
            
            Now when they would by the authoritie of the ſuperiour Lords raiſe amongſt The cuſtome of Tranſiluania to leauie the ſouldiours of the countrie. them ſuch Infantrie and Caualarie, as euery towne is bound to furniſh, and that ſpecially for generall defence; the cuſtome of this Prouince is, to ſend one Launce and a Sword ſtained with blood, and borne on horſebacke by one of the principalleſt officers of euery towne or place, and carrying them on high (in token of great and preſent neceſſitie) ſheweth them to all thereabout, with another man on foote, who goeth crying; The common enemie commeth againſt vs all, let euery houſe prepare a man for generall good, and ſend him ſpeedily to that place which is appointed you. At this crie euery one cauſeth ſpeedily to depart, all thoſe who are apt and able to beare armes, and ſendeth them to the rende vous. And thus within a  ſhort time they aſſembled a great number of men, as well foote as horſe: the care that Caſtalde had thereof, greatly aſſiſting them in that buſines, who ſpecially haſtened the men, which hee cauſed to bee leauied through the kingdome, George ſuſpected by Caſtalde. and ſo much the rather, becauſe hee had vehement ſuſpition of the Frier, who continually ceaſed not to his vttermoſt, to driue him out of thoſe countries, whereof he was well aduertiſed by meanes of one who was very familiar with the Frier, and acquainted him with all ſuch occurrants. Yet Caſtalde diſſembling the matter, vſed Frier George in the greateſt kindnes as was poſſible, and indeuoured himſelfe by al meanes to gaine his good liking, and  the rather, for that hee knew him to bee fickle and inconſtant, and ſtood in much awe of the Turke, hauing continuall diſtruſt that for his inconſtancie, he would exchaunge the fauour of his friends, to follow the ambitious wiles of his enemies. In reſpect whereof, he confirmed him generall Treaſurer, States confirmed to George. with 4000. Florins by the yeere, and alſo Vaynode of the kingdome, with

15000. Florins by the yeere, as he had requeſted, and with authoritie in time of neceſſitie to haue 800. horſe, and 500. foote for his guard; and beſides, 200.  other horſe which he ſhould maintaine at Deua, and at Gherghe, two ſtrong Caſtles and places which was giuen him to keepe. Being by ſuch bountifulnes wonne to a diſſembled fidelitie, he came to the Diet at Sibinio, (which a little before was appointed) where euery one being arriued, they required all the Prouinces of the kingdome; to wit, the Sicilians, Saxons, and Tranſalpinians, to contribute ſome money to maintaine the charges of the warre; which was agreed vnto by the moſt. And whileſt the Frier by all good outward offices ſhewed himſelfe ſeruiceable to Ferdinand, yet hee omitted not The inconſtancie of George. ſecretly to practiſe with the Turke, to accord with him, and in recompence  of the good which was done him, he ſtill cauſed ſuch ſouldiours whom hee moſt truſted, to reſort to him, with whom vnder the colour to chaſe and expell the Turke, hee endeuoured to thruſt out of the kingdome Ferdinands people.
            About that time came newes, how Maximilian King of Bohemia, was Maximilian eſpouſed Marie daughter of Charles the Emperour. returned out of Spaine, with Mary daughter of Charles the Emperour, &amp; that hauing paſſed through Italie, he arriued at Vienna, where, by reaſon thereof, was made him great feaſts and ſports: and how ſome brought letters from Rome to his Maieſtie, by which (in the firſt creation of Cardinals) the Pope promiſed to include and create Frier George in the number. 
            
            
               Ferdinand vnderſtanding that the Baſha of Buda laboured thus that hee might increaſe his armie, did (beſides the people which he ſent into Tranſiluania) reenforce the garriſons which were on the frontiers of Hungarie, for feare that the Baſha turning his courſe on that quarter, yet ſhould he not bee ſo ſoone maſter thereof as he imagined. Whereupon he diſpatched Andrew 
               Succours ſent by Ferdinand to Caſtalde. 
               Branday with a Regiment of 3000. Germanes, and Charles Seheretin, a Lord of Sleſia, with 400. horſe, the moſt part whereof were men of armes, and the reſt Piſtoliers, all vnder the conduct of the Marqueſſe Sforce Palauicin, who then was Comiſſarie generall of the Campe. Being all arriued at Varadine, they ſoiourned there a time, attending that which Caſtalde would command  them. He ſeeing that by no meanes he could depart out of the kingdome, without giuing the Frier great ſuſpition of him, ſent to tell the Marqueſſe Sforce, that with the people which hee brought out of Germanie, hee ſhould come and ioyne with him where he was; and in the meane time, he leauing in Albe-iula one companie of Germanes, another at Saſſebeſſe, and two at Sibinio (it being the greateſt and moſt important towne of Tranſiluania) with thoſe fewe Spanyards which hee brought with him, and the reſt of the Germanes, he departed to goe and ioyne with the Frier. And then he vnderſtood that the Belerbey had alreadie paſſed Tibiſcus with a great armie of 80000. men, as well Infantrie as Caualarie (as the Spies, and thoſe who ſecretly had knowledge of his Campe, reported): and that hee brought  with him 50. peeces of Artillerie great and ſmall for batterie, and with this warlike traine, hee held on his courſe to Themeſuar. The Belerbey hauing thus paſſed Tibiſcus, preſently commaunded Lozonſe, that hee ſhould without Themeſuar ſummoned. any further delay, in the name of the Grand Seigniour, preſently yeeld

this towne to him, and that if he would not, he proteſted to race it ſtone from  ſtone, and alſo both himſelfe and thoſe who were with him, to bee put to the ſword, and that he would execute this according to the expreſſe command which he had thereof, without any mercie or fauour. And on the contrarie, that if liberally, and of his owne good will, he would yeeld it into his hands, beſides the guerdon and aſſured recompence which hee ſhould finde, hee would vſe all curteſie and fauour, which according to fayre warres, was accuſtomably vſed to valiant and gallant ſouldiours: and by that meanes hee ſhould aſſuredly winne the friendſhip of the Grand Seigniour, whoſe fauour he ſhould neuer want.
            
               Lozonſe at this proud ſummons anſwered him thus: That that towne belonged to the King of the Romanes, and that in his behalfe hee would vndoubtedly  keepe and defend it to the death, acknowledging no other rightfull King, nor Grand Seigniour of that Prouince, but he: and that it were farre better diſcretion for him to retire backe againe, then to proceede with this crueltie to deſtroy the poore commons and countrie which were none of his, and ouer whom he had not any mite of intereſt: and therefore hee held it ſafeſt for him and his traine quietly to depart, and let thoſe liue in peace, who did not any thing offend or annoy him. The Belerbey ſeeing the gallantnes of Lozonſe, he made him no other anſwer, but onely ſent to him by writing theſe foure verſes taken out of Virgil. 
               
            
            
               Ante leues ergo paſcentur in aethere cerui,
               Et freta deſtituent nudos in littore piſces,
               Ante pererratis amborum finibus exul
               Aut ararim Parthus bibet, aut Germania Tygrim.
            
            Minding thereby to demonſtrate, that Harts ſhould rather bruze in the ayre; the fiſhes forſake the ſea; a baniſhed man ſee the ende of the world; a Parthean drinke vp the riuer Saone; or a Germane, the riuer Tygris, rather then Saone, or Sagona, a riuer in France. hee would returne from his intended courſe. And ſo proceeding on his iourney, he came before a little Caſtle which ſtandeth almoſt vpon the paſſage of the riuer, and is named (as is aboue ſaid) Becche, and there in camped Becche taken by the Turks. himſelfe before it, and ſeeing it would not yeeld, he began ſo rudely to  batter it with tenne Cannons, that the greateſt part of the wall fell to the ground. Whereat the beſieged being greatly aſtoniſhed, and perceiuing themſelues caſt away, becauſe the whole Caſtle was broken downe and layd open, they preſently yeelded to the Belerbey, with this condition only that their liues might bee ſaued, who obſeruing no promiſe towards them, were notwithſtanding ſlaine by the Ianiſaries, who after they were come forth, of 200. men left not one aliue, the Captaine excepted, whom the Belerbey with great difficultie ſaued. Going from thence with one part of his armie, and two double Cannons, hee came before another Caſtle named Becherech, Becherech taken. which being aſtoniſhed at the late misfortune happened to Becche,  without induring the force of the Cannon, they preſently yeelded. This Caſtle being thus rendered, the Belerbey ſpeedily with all his armie marched directly to another Caſtle named Senath, otherwiſe Chinath, before which he made a ſtand with al his ſquadrons, to ſee if they would yeeld: and

whileſt he was occupied about theſe attempts, the Rhatians of Ferdinands part, ſeeing the Turks Campe approched with great force and violence, and  thinking Ferdinands power deferred too much time before they came into the field, they all perſwading themſelues, that it was neither ſhame nor diſhonour The Rhatians reuolt from Ferdinand, and incline to the Turkes. to breake their words and othes which they ſwore to the King (although they had receiued pay) they wholly retired to the Belerbey, ſending to him for his greater aſſurance, their wiues and children, and that becauſe the Turkes are not accuſtomed to repoſe ouer much truſt in them, knowing their extreame inconſtant diſpoſitions. After he had entertained theſe Rhatians, he cauſed thoſe of Senath to bee tempted to ſome agreement, promiſing them that if they would yeeld, he would preſerue both their honours and liues, and he would permit that peaceably euery man ſhould enioy their  owne proper goods. Vpon which condition they yeelded, and the Caſtle Senath yeelded to the Turkes. came vnder his commaund, and leauing therein a good garriſon, he ſpeedily marched towards Lippa, which was tenne miles diſtant from thence, leauing behinde him Themeſuar, which then he would not beſiege, but reſerued that enterpriſe vntill better oportunitie, and performed no other thing, but diligently obſerued the ſituation and commodities thereabouts, and after that proceeded on his iourney.
            Euery one was of opinion that hee meant not to enterpriſe any thing againſt this towne, becauſe that hee was certainly informed there was a ſtrong garriſon within it, and that it was ſufficiently munitioned and fortified,  inſomuch that hee eſteemed the exployte very difficult, and perhaps he ſuppoſed he ſhould neuer get it. Thus leauing the ſiege thereof, vntill a more commodious and fit time, he thought it more profitable to take from him all the Fortreſſes thereabouts, and eſpecially Lippa, (which was the direct paſſage by which Caſtalde was forced to ſend all the ſuccours that were neceſſarie for him) and that afterwards hee ſeeing himſelfe depriued of all hope, hee made no doubt, but that either by force or compoſition he ſhould carrie it. He being now within one daies iourney of Lippa, preſently ſent his Vauntgard, to know and ſuruiew the Campe of Andrew Battor, who was ſuddenly aduertiſed thereof by his Sentinels, which hee appointed  in certaine places, to bee aſſured when the Belerbey approched. They with all expedition in the beginning of the night brought newes to Battor (who was then at Lippa) that the Turkes drew neere to that towne, Battor confuſedly quitteth Lippa. and that they had already diſcouered the Vauntgard. Battor vpon this newes euen the very ſelfeſame night retired ſo confuſedly with his people, yt all his Campe was in a manner quite defeated, becauſe that euery one for his owne part ſought the meanes how by flying he might ſaue himſelfe. Diſlodging in this confuſion, he left in the Caſtle Captaine Pete a Hungarian to gouerne it, a man of good reputation as well to manage armes, as alſo for other politike affayres, with 300. horſe, and certaine Aiduchs, who are (as wee before  haue ſhewed) footmen, who in their armes and manner of fight, imitate the Turkes; and commanded him with his people to defend both the towne and it, the beſt they could. Scarſe was Andrew Battor departed, when in the morning the Burgomaſter of Lippa (who is the principall officer of the

towne, and euery yeere one is choſen and created, for the adminiſtration and The Burgomaſter of Lippa yeeldeth the towne to the Turkes. 
                gouernment thereof) went to ſeeke Pete, plainly (yea and like a iolly ſtoute Burger) telling him, that he would yeeld the towne to the Belerbey, ſince he ſaw no forces left to defend it, it being forſaken by Battor, and that there was not one citizen that would hazard the loſſe of their children, wiues, ſiſters, and reuenewes, all of them being well aſſured, that if they ſhould ſtand vpon their guard, the Belerbey would without mercie put them all to the ſword, and that for this feare, neither they, nor the other Rhatians who were remaining in the towne, would aduenture that, which within ſhort time was probable to bring them to vtter confuſion, nor fooliſhly hazard ſuch a miſerable end which now was eminent, if they ſtood vpon defenſiue tearmes, well  knowing that they had neither force nor prouiſion ſufficient to reſiſt him: and that for theſe conſiderations he was reſolued to preſent the keyes of the towne to the Belerbey; and as for him hee might doe with the Caſtle as hee thought good. Pete ſeeing the cowardly reſolution of this Burger, and aſſuring himſelfe, that the Turkes being in the towne, hee could not poſſible defend the Caſtle, eſteemed it better and more profitable for the ſeruice of Ferdinand, in preſeruing thoſe ſouldiours which he had with him, to retire with ſafetie, then to expect and aduenture the loſſe of all. Vpon this deliberation he forſooke the Caſtle, and the greateſt part of the towne, and ſo departed out of it with all his ſouldiours. And of the other ſide, the Burgomaſter  went preſently to ſeeke the Belerbey, vnto whom he yeelded the towne keyes, with many ſubmiſſiue demonſtrations of obedience; in recompence whereof, the Belerbey receiued it with kinde thankes, ſhewing him many pleaſant ſports, and alſo beſtowing many preſents of him, and preſently after went accompanied to Lippa with the ſaid Burgomaſter, where hee lodged with all his armie, and ſoiourned there tenne daies, greatly reioycing himſelfe, that without the loſſe of his people, all things were quietly yeelded to him: and ſuppoſing with himſelfe that all the other places would doe the like, he endeuoured with his vttermoſt abilitie to take a little Caſtle, yet very ſtrong, named Solimos, which was ſituated vpon a mountaine, diſtant from Solimos defended againſt the Turks. Lippa onely but a Culuerine ſhot. The ſouldiours who were within were  Hungars, and little regarding the Turkes Campe, valiantly defended themſelues, hoping that within ſhort time Caſtalde would relieue them (as for certaine he did) and ſhewing their valiantnes and courage, which was exceeding great, they daily made ſallies out vpon the enemie, and endamaged and annoyed the Belerbey as much as they could, ſo that hee ſeeing neither by promiſes, good words, nor by more then reaſonable offers he could winne it, he was forced in the end to depart, and let them liue in peace, perſwading himſelfe that he ſhould in the end haue it either by a long ſiege, or of their owne good will. 
            
            Thus leauing within Lippa 5000. horſe, and 200. of the beſt Ianiſaries which were in his Campe vnder the charge of Oliman Bech a Perſian (who a little before for ſome indignation which hee conceiued againſt the Sophy, was come from Perſia to one Turkes ſeruice) departed with the reſt of his armie to beſiege Themeſuar, thinking that vpon the conqueſt thereof, hee

ſhould not leaue any thing behinde him which was not firme and aſſured to him, and that hee ſhould not haue any more occaſion to conceiue any feare  or doubt to be ſtaied by the ſuccours which was hoped to bee ſent by Ferdinand: and for the better notifying of this towne of Themeſuar, I will make a briefe deſcription thereof.
            Themeſuar is a little towne enuironed with the riuer Themes, whereof Themeſuar. the towne taketh his name. The halfe whereof is incloſed with a mud wall, and built vp with wood in forme of a Rampier, and before it are great Ditches, Mariſhes, and Quagmires full of water, in regard wherof it maketh the towne in that place ſo ſtrong, that by no meanes it can bee battered, and much leſſe beſieged. The other halfe is incloſed with a wall of quarters after  the ancient manner, which when they heard that the Belerbey would come to beſiege, they preſently began to repayre it, making within it a long Trench of 150. paces, and of bredth and depth a pike broad and deepe, with his trauerſes and neceſſarie defences, and below at the foote of a tower (which was in the middeſt) was made a Caſemet to defend the Ditch of either ſide, which was alreadie fortified with flankes, fit for the ſhot to play out of.
            This towne being thus fortified, they got thereinto all the victuals which were in either of the Suburbes, and fiered the greater of them, for that the enemie ſhould not finde commoditie to lodge therein; and the other part  which was enuironed with two armes of the riuer, remained whole vntill they ſaw where the Belerbey would incampe himſelfe, with intention to defend it, as well for that it was of it ſelfe naturally very defenſible, as alſo for the commoditie which they receiued thereby; and all of them determined to keep and defend that towne againſt the furie and force of the Barbarians, or elſe to make an honourable and glorious end. They being generally of Themeſuar beſieged. this firme reſolution, behold the Vauntgard of the Turkes arriued the 14. of October, to peruſe and ſuruay the place: and whileſt they were buſied and attentiue about their view, Lozonſe ſallied forth with 400. horſe, ſomewhat againſt the liking of the Maſter of the Campe, Aldene. Captaine Vigliandrando 
                alſo iſſued forth with 50. Harquebuziers to skirmiſh with the enemie, and ſo effectually did hee purſue it, that that day hee performed the acts of a valiant and couragious Leader: as for the ſame valour there was renowned and commended a Spaniſh Knight, named Alphonſe Perez of Saiauedra, to whom a little before Ferdinand had giuen a companie of Hungariſh horſe. Lozonſe on the other ſide with his horſe performed as much that day, as was poſſible for a man of experience and valour to doe againſt his enemie, ſo that being well ſeconded by the vigilancie and dexterie of the Harquebuziers, he forced the Turkes (which were 2000.) mauger their braueries, to retire themſelues to their maine ſquadrons. And this skirmiſh continued vntill the Maſter of the Campe ſent to them, with commaund to retire, fearing  that by their too much forwardnes, there might befall them ſome ſiniſter fortune, becauſe the Turkes were a great number, and conſidering alſo that they had giuen the enemie ſufficient notice of their pr
                  〈…〉
               esse. Obeying this commaund, they retired without the loſſe of any one of their men, although they

were very hotly charged euen to the very enterance of the Suburbes, where  
               Vigliandrando well foreſeeing the euent, had placed certaine Harquebuziers to relieue them, when they ſhould make their retraict. And this preuention ſtood them in ſingular good ſtead, and greatly endamaged the enemie, who for feare of the ſaid ſhot, were forced to make a ſtand, and in the end retire
            The day after this skirmiſh, the Belerbey preſented himſelfe before the towne with all his Campe in a well ordered battaile, who (by reaſon of the Rhatians that had forſaken and disbanded themſelues from our part, and were linked to the Turks) was growne to the number of 90000. men, whereby he thought to amaze our people onely with the ſight of their armie: and  minding to begin to take ſome knowledge of the place, was by the ſallies of the aſſieged ſo ſharply annoyed, that he could not at that time poſſibly performe what hee went about. The Maſter of the Campe in the meane time placed 100. Harquebuziers within the Suburbes to defend it againſt the Turkes, vntill the munition which was therein, was gotten and had into the towne, the better thereby to ayde themſelues during the ſiege. The ſecond day after, the Belerbey in the night time cauſed his batterie to be placed, and on that ſide which Lozonſe and the Maſter of the Camp had begun (as good fortune was) to fortifie. Which thing when our men had vnderſtood (by the confeſſion of certaine priſoners, whom they had taken in their ſallying  forth) they preſently cauſed with all expedition that night, to lengthen the Trench which they had begun fiftie paces, and ſo diligently did they labour, that the next day they thought themſelues ſufficiently ſtrong. The enemie hauing viewed the place, began at dawning of the day to batter with two Cannons, two Culuerines, and other ſmall peeces, with which he battered againſt thoſe defences to beate them downe. Our men ſeeing ſo weake a batterie (although that Aldene had alreadie ſent to Caſtalde, to certifie him that if within 20. daies he was not relieued, he ſhould be forced to render the towne) eſteemed as nothing the Turkes violence, for that they aſſuredly thought, they were well able to maintaine the defence of their towne, vnleſſe perhaps they ſhould be ſo battered with a great number of Artillerie,  that by maine force the walles on all ſides ſhould be broken downe and laid open, whereof they had ſome diſtruſt, fearing that the Belerbey would haue brought thither ſeuen other double Cannons, which they ſhould bring from Belgrade for this warre, euen as they had vnderſtood by the foreſaid priſoners.
            Now whileſt theſe things paſſed thus at Themeſuar, Caſtalde hauing firſt furniſhed all the Fortreſſes with Germane garriſons, and after that he had appeaſed the diſorder which was at Breſſouia by the ſouldiours (who were A tumult at Breſouia. riſen againſt the citizens, and had offered them great outrage: and to appeaſe  which mutinie, he was forced to vſe ſeuere iuſtice againſt thoſe who were authors thereof, and to manifeſt thereby an example vnto others, to liue more peaceably and in duer obedience: for ſome of them were executed, others baniſhed, and others condemned for a certaine time to priſon): After (I ſay) that Caſtalde had ſet in order theſe affayres, he came and ioyned

with the Frier, who with great diligence and promptnes had already leauied The armie of Caſtalde. as well horſe as foote an armie of 70000. men, which daily increaſed, and  namely by the arriuall of the Marqueſſe Sforce Pallauicin, who came thither with 3000. Germanes, and of Charles Scerettin with 400. horſe, and laſtly by the arriuall of Andrew Battor with 10000. men, who after his retraict from Lippa, had thus redreſſed and reunited his armie, which ſo timerouſly and by ſuch a confuſion was disbanded and fled. By this augmentation Castalde and the Frier had in their Campe well neere 90000. men, as well thoſe of his owne pay, as alſo thoſe which were ſent him by others, and 50. peeces of Artillerie. But although the number was great, yet were they of little abilitie to performe any matter of moment, for that they were men of ſmall experience,  
               The Tranſiluanians for the moſt part are ſouldiours of ſmall actiō. and ſuch as were ſent of euery houſe, (as the cuſtome is in this kingdome alwaies to ſend vpon ſuch neceſſitie) meanly armed, and meerely ignorant of any warlike diſcipline: ſo that they are more fit to moue trouble and flie, then to fight or purſue the enemie. For theſe reſpects Caſtalde had no great affiance in them, but only vpon a few men which were in the Kings pay, of whom, and of no other hee made ſpeciall account for any important ſeruice, which number might amount vnto 15000. horſe and foote of all nations: but ſpecially he repoſed ſingular confidence in 500. Spanyards which continually hee had with him, in whoſe quarter, as well in the field, as elſewhere, he alwaies pitched his Tent and lodged. And becauſe that among ſo  many nations, which from diuers parts were come thither, men could not perceiue any great order or obſeruation of Militarie diſcipline amongſt them, but rather, by reaſon of the hatreds, quarels, priuate and publike enmitie, which they had one againſt another, they might behold an extreame confuſion, becauſe that one Prouince would not ioyne and conſort with an other, but euery one would muſter and range himſelfe a part, the intreatings and perſwaſions of their Captaines and Officers nothing auailing: Castalde ſeeing the inconuenience thereof, and endeuouring to abate and ſuppreſſe all their particular diſſentions, and to reduce and vnite them into one attonement, that he might not by the meanes of ſuch tumults and diſorders, cauſe  to grow the hope of the enemie, and weaken Ferdinands forces; cauſed the principall and chiefe men of marke among them to aſſemble before him, and vſed to them this or the like perſwaſiue admonitions.
            
               My louing and friendly fellowes in armes, your famous predeceſſours in Caſtalde his oration. times paſt floriſhed by good and commendable cuſtomes, and abounded in all excelling vertue, and ſpecially in warlike affayres; where in former time they vſually attained to the period of eternall glorie: yea, and in ſuch famous ſort, that they thereby were greatly admired of all Nations, Kings, and Prouinces. But ſince, this path of vertue hath been left by their poſteritie, and that it hath been couered on all ſides, and darkened with innumerable vices;  this brightnes and light of true glorie (there being laid a part ancient Militarie diſcipline) remaineth ſo obfuſcate amongſt you the reſt of the Dacians, that it hath ingendred in this Prouince a moſt infamous loſſe and markable damage. In conſidering of which, I now eſteeme it no leſſe neceſſarie then commendable to reforme this armie, and reeſtabliſh it in that eſtate and renowne,

which our ancient cuſtome and obſeruation requireth: which is vnpoſſible  to be done, without your aſſiſtance. Therefore I am very deſirous to admoniſh and exhort you, that leauing all couetouſneſſe, forſaking all pleaſures, auoyding all corporall delights; and aboue all, excluding the ſlothfulnes mixt with your priuate hates and diſſentions, you would endeuour to reduce and ſubmit your ſelues vnder obeyſance and good order (vnder which, your anceſtors with vnſpeakable fame were wont to liue and manage armes: to the ende that following this infallible rule, by the helpe of your forcible armes, you might haue an open and free paſſage to a bliſfull and moſt quiet repoſe, and that you might (being all vnited together) bring into your country (by the defeature &amp; flight of the Turks) memorable triumphs,  and not by the meanes of your preiudiciall hatreds, increaſe their puiſſance. In performing of which, you may aſſure your ſelues, I will not be to you as a Captaine and Generall: but, as an affectionate father and deare companion, as well to comfort my ſelf with your good and fortunate ſucceſſe, as alſo patiently to take part with any euill (which God defend) that ſhall betide you.
            
            By vertue of theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches, al the people which before were ſo diſordered, did now vnite themſelues louingly into one, hauing more reſpect to the perſon which did thus ſpeake, then regard of their owne particulars, and were content to be ordered and muſtered with the other. 
            
            This done, Caſtalde and Frier George with this armie and Artillerie, began to march with great iournies, deſirous in time to relieue Lozonſe and Aldene, who were beſieged at Themeſuar. In the continuance of their marching, the Frier would alwaies leade the Vauntgard, hauing all his people with him. But when he approched the enemie, Caſtalde tooke the conduct with the beſt and approued ſouldiours which hee had, leauing the battaile to the other. And marching in this manner, hee himſelfe appointed the quarters for the armie to lodge, alwaies chuſing the places of moſt ſtrength and commoditie, whereby his people ſhould not receiue any detriment, continually cauſing his Campe to march in good order, although it was with ſome difficultie, for that the armie was great, and the way where they ſhould paſſe very  narrow and tedious, and ſpecially in ſome places which they found betweene the mountaine and the riuer, they being ſometime 12. or 13000. in length, where they were ſo ſtraightly crouded together, that very hardly a Coach could paſſe. In reſpect whereof the iournies were little, which did much trouble Caſtalde, ſeeing that thereby the ſuccours which he determined ſhould enter into Themeſuar were ſlackened, which he knew to be violently battered by the Belerbey.
            Now whileſt the Campe marched, the Commaunders of the armie diſcourſed A conſultation held among the Commanders of Ferdinands armie. among themſelues, whether they ſhould goe to Lippa or Themeſuar: and after many and ſundrie opinions, it was thought fitteſt that they  ſhould direct their courſe to beſiege Lippa, and others were of opinion to proceed on and ſuccour Themeſuar, and that afterward they would returne and aſſaile the other. Againſt which opinions, Frier George firmely oppoſed himſelfe, ſaying, that it was much better directly to goe to Lippa; alleadging

for his reaſons, that the Belerbey to relieue Oliman, would raiſe his Campe from before Themeſuar, and that hee would aſſuredly come to them; and  by this meane they ſhould auoyde a tedious and cumberſome iourney; and that afterward they might commodiouſly ſend ſuch ſuccours as they would to the beſieged at Themeſuar.
            
               Caſtalde tooke theſe opinions not to bee good, and prouing his ſpeeches by diuers reaſons, in the end perſwaded euery one to determine vpon this reſolution, to leaue a Campe before Lippa, which ſhould bee ſufficient to maintaine a ſiege there, and ſo to hinder Oliman that he ſhould not by ſallies be greatly offenſiue to them, neither eſcape himſelfe: and with the reſt of his people (ſince he had ſufficient) he would march on towards Themeſuar,  and that he would take the way which leade towards Caranſebeſſe, which is a Caſtle ſituated in the confines of the Tranſalpinians, not farre from Themeſuar, from whence he might within few houres ſend ſuccours to Lozonſe and Aldene, and that if he did otherwiſe, it would redound to ſmall profit; and this enterpriſe could bee ſubiect to nothing elſe, but to inconſtant fortune, voyde of all reaſon.
            After (I ſay) ſuch aduices diſcourſed and determined of, the Frier at the ſame inſtant called to him Battor, that he might bee preſent at that which he would ſpeake; and ſaid to Caſtalde, that he had altered his minde, and that he thought it not good to goe with this armie to relieue Themeſuar, being aſſured  that this armie compoſed rather of people muſtered together, who were but badly armed and vnexperienced, then of good and trained ſouldiours, (whereof the Turkes no doubt would bee aduertiſed) it would bee ſuddenly incountered by the enemie, and that theſe two armies rudely ſhocking together, our Campe without doubt would be broken and ouerthrowne, by the good order, practiſe, and long experience of the enemie. And thus publiſhing to them many other friuolous reaſons, hee concluded in the end (appartly ſhewing) that he was mutabilitie it ſelfe, and that his diſpoſition was not to bee long firmely ſtayed vpon one reſolute purpoſe. 
            
            
               Caſtalde anſwered him, that he had reaſon to be as he was, eſpecially in important affayres, in which it was behoouefull to take good counſell, and vſe a conſideratiue foreſight, it being commendable for him ſometimes to change his opinion from good to better; but onely he now meant to perſwade him to goe to Lippa, where (according to the euent of things) they would agree amongſt themſelues either to aſſaile Lippa, or relieue Themeſuar. The Frier replied, ſaying, that he well knew Themeſuar to be a place not very ſtrong, and that by a Polacque, (whom he had of purpoſe ſent thither; and after that hee had diligently conſidered all that which was done there, as well within as without, hee was againe returned to him) by whom he had alſo notice that the Turkes expected more Artillerie to be ſent them,  and that the beſieged, although they were couragious (and had good deſire to fight) yet were they not able any longer to endure the ſiege, in reſpect of the intolerable and laborious toyles, which day and night they endured, in digging and fortifying with ſtraw. Caſtalde hearing theſe things, with other

more colourable reaſons, ſtrengthening ſtill his owne, tolde him he ſhould  remember that which vſually hee was wont to ſay; that except Lippa were recouered, Tranſiluania would bee loſt, and that it might pleaſe him not to deceiue Chriſtendome of that ſpeciall hope, which it had conceiued of him, and of that glorie which it ſhould get, by the recouerie of this towne, and by the retraict of the enemie, being very well content that in this matter he himſelfe ſhould abſolutely commaund, and that he would obey him as a priuate Captaine. By theſe reaſons he endeuoured to perſwade the Frier to march to Lippa, and ſpecially becauſe the time approched that hee ſhould relieue Lozonſe and Aldene, as they had demaunded, hauing proteſted, that if during the limited time of twentie daies, they were not relieued, they  could no longer hold out, but be forced to yeeld to the Belerbey. The Frier, whether it were that he feared to giue battaile to the Belerbey; or that it was for ſome conſideration of the practiſes which hee had with him, that by his meanes he might reconcile himſelf againe to Solyman; or elſe that he thought not his Campe to be ſufficiently furniſhed of ſuch men, vpon whoſe valour he might aduenture the hazard of a combat, I know not, but for theſe reaſons hee would not vpon had I wiſt, neither aduenture his perſon nor the kingdome, nor march any further, and leſſe relieue Themeſuar. But in the end he manifeſted with an euill will to goe towards Lippa, and thinking to eſcape from thence (ſince otherwiſe he could not doe it) he held on his pace  with ſlow ſpeede, not without ſuſpition, as it ſeemed, to giue leiſure that Oliman might retire himſelf, for that he thought he would neuer aduenture nor attend him within ſo weak and vnfortified place. Thus the Friers idle excuſes was not without ſome conſiderations beſt knowne to himſelfe. And whileſt ſome were diſputing to proceede on, and others to make no haſte, newes was brought how the Belerbey, after hee had battered Themeſuar eight whole daies together, was now retired; notwithſtanding there was brought The Turke retireth from Themeſuar. him more Artillerie and munition, eſteeming it to bee his beſt ſafetie not to attend there any longer, vnderſtanding that Frier George and Caſtalde approched neere with a great armie. And thus vpon the day that our men thought to receiue the aſſault, at the dawning of the day, they perceiued the Turkes  had forſaken and quitted their Trenches, and left them disfurniſhed of their accuſtomed guards, and that they had drawne their Artillerie into thoſe Caſtles which they had wonne before, and were in the night diſlodged with ſo great a noyſe and tumult, that our men thought they yet planted other Artillerie to endamage them the more. Lozonſe and Aldene being aduertiſed of this departure, would not that any ſhould yet goe out, fearing the enemie was not wholly retired; but cauſed certaine Aiduchs to goe forth to ſuruiew the Trenches, and diſcouer the occaſion of ſo ſudden a remouing. Theſe being abroade, ſaw that the Turkes were aſſuredly retired, and that in  ſuch great haſte and diſorder, that in token thereof they had left in their Trenches more then 200. iron bullets for Artillerie, which preſently were taken into the towne by our men. The Frier taking courage by this diſlodging, made ſhew to be very ioyfull thereof, and cauſing the day following an aſſemblie of the Councell, it was concluded then among them, more expedient

to aſſaile Lippa, (and not leaue it behinde) then to follow the enemie. The army proceeding on in this courſe towards Lippa, they had notice how  
               Oliman determined reſolutely to defend it, and as they marched (being alreadie within foure miles of Lippa) there arriued the 20. of October in the night, a Currier, who brought newes, that Pope Iuly the third, at the requeſt George made Cardinall. and inſtance of Ferdinand, had created Frier George a Cardinall, and brought him the red Hat, with many Cardinals letters, who not knowing him, but being onely induced thereunto by the good and commendable reports which were ſpoken of him, ſent to him this newes, with great and magnificent ſalutations, aduertiſing him with what good affection of all their Colledge, the Hat was beſtowed vpon him, aſſuring him alſo, that not onely this  dignitie was due to his worthie merits, but alſo an honour farre more renowned, for a man of that ſincere Chriſtianitie, and religious protector of the Romane faith, defending this kingdome with ſo great trauaile and induſtrie againſt the Turkes, whereof they generally receiued a ſingular contentment.
            As theſe and Ferdinand had written to him theſe particulars, and that according to the great information which was reported of his vertue, greatnes, and courage, hee ſeeing ſuch commendations to bee greatly to his renowne, could not ſo much containe himſelfe within the bounds of temporance, but that hee apparantly declared to all men great tokens of ioy in his  countenance, conſidering that euery where men made ſo ſpeciall an account of him, yea, and euen at Rome it ſelfe, whither all the world reſorted. But on the other ſide he was much diſquieted, fearing that the Turke, vpon aduertiſement of theſe honourable fauours which he daily receiued of Ferdinand, ſhould in reſpect thereof, and in time to come greatly ſuſpect him, and vpon theſe reaſons might haue iuſt occaſion not to repoſe the like truſt in him, as he before, euen vntill that time, had done. By reaſon of theſe two contrarieties which he had in his minde, there were contrarie ſhewes in him: for vnto them which did little knowe and vnderſtand his practiſes, hee made ſhew as though hee little regarded the Hat: but to others who were of a deeper reach, hee to vaile their iudgements, endeuoured himſelfe by many inuentions  to make it apparant to them, what ſingular pleaſure he conceiued of it. The ſame night, in token of reioycing, Caſtalde commaunded that a Salue ſhould bee made with all the Artillerie, to the end that the Frier being throughly prouoked with ſuch ſignes of honour and ioy, he might reſolue himſelfe wholly to follow Ferdinands part, and that with ſuch ſinceritie as he ought, and that hee would wholly giue ouer himſelfe to his ſeruice, and not haue ſo many Irons in the fire. But all this was done to ſmall purpoſe. For with his deceits and ſhifts, he ſtill continued to maske his falſehood, little regarding any perſon of what qualitie ſoeuer; which was a thing that greatly  diſpleaſed as well Caſtalde, as all the other Commaunders who were adhearing to the Kings part. This, and the ambitious deſire of power and great The cauſe of the hate that Caſtalde had againſt George. places, were firſt the cauſe of the hate which was ingendred againſt him, and in the end procured his death, becauſe that all the Commaunders ſeeing he did not any thing eſteeme nor fauour them, but on the contrarie held them

in diſdaine and contempt, began to apprehend a ſuſpition of being betraied,  and in ſome place or other, when occaſion ſerued, to be maſſacred.
            Now while Frier George by his malice, in concealing his purpoſes, diſſembled one thing, Caſtalde with as great policie and wiſedome fained another, alwaies ſhadowing his intention with ſuch diſcretion, that none had any perſeuerance of the diſlike which he conceiued in his heart againſt him; and hauing before noted the Friers deceitfull proceedings, as it was ſaid, he repoſed no truſt in him at all, but continually had a vigilant and ſuſpitious eye ouer his actions. As theſe affayres proceeded on in this ſort, two daies after Aduertiſement from Ferdinand to Caſtalde, to kill George. there arriued with Caſtalde a gentleman of Ferdinands retinue, named Iulius Salazar, who was come poſt from Vienna, with letters of credence, which  imported, that if Caſtalde was not then departed out of Tranſiluania, hee ſhould not now ſtirre from thence, but reſolue to keepe and maintaine himſelfe there ſo ſtrongly, that the Frier ſhould finde no deuiſes to expell him out: and that he ſhould inuent the beſt meanes he could preſently to haue him ſlaine, for that he perceiued not onely by his owne letters, but alſo he vnderſtood for certaine, by ſpeciall aduertiſements from thoſe who were come from the Turkes Court, and from the King of Polonia, and ſome of his Secretaries, that he intended to enter league with the Turke, and to ſeeke the deſtruction of him and of all his armie, and thereby to make himſelfe abſolute Lord of Tranſiluania: and that before he ſhould put in practiſe his determination, he aduertiſed him to haue a ſpeciall and vigilant eye of his proceedings,  and that he ſhould in ſuch ſort doe it, as though there were no ſuch intended practiſe to intrap him; and that hee referred to his wiſedome the meanes which hee ſhould vſe to effect it, skilfully endeuouring to deliuer himſelfe from the danger in which he might behold his perſon and people at that time. Caſtalde then vnderſtanding Ferdinands pleaſure, he thought it no new or ſtraunge thing, becauſe that hee alreadie very well perceiued that the Frier vſed but little ſinceritie and true dealing in thoſe affaires which concerned the Kings ſeruice, which poſſeſt him in a confirmation of the diſtruſt, which he not without cauſe conceiued of him. Now to fruſtrate his iealous braine from ſuſpecting any intended practiſe againſt him, hee by  ſome new deuiſes, for his better ſatisfaction, diſſembled the Kings meſſage: and his temporiſing with him was ſo diſcreete and wiſe, that hee neuer gaue him the leaſt occaſion to ſuſpect him, imparting to him what deſire Ferdinand had to ſee a good ende of this warre, and what ſpeciall hope he had of his valour and integritie, to obtaine by his meanes ſome renowned victorie, attributing all the glorie which ſhould be gotten thereby, to his vertue and proweſſe. With ſuch colourable fictions he continually entertained him, vntill that time which then ſhould preſent vnto him the meanes to execute his enterpriſe, euen as hee well hoped it would come to  effect, without any danger or loſſe, and after ſuch manner, that by the execution of it he ſhould neither hazard that kingdome nor his armie: which he knew ſo well to conduct and manage, and that with ſuch ſuttletie and ſecreſie, and to bring it ſo to end, that the Frier ſhould neuer haue any ſuſpition or coniecture of it, which might haue giuen him any trouble in his minde.
            
               
In the meane while the Campe approched very neere to Lippa, and then the Frier for that day would needes leade the Vauntgard, which Caſtalde by  no meanes would denie, but gratified him in any thing he demaunded. The Frier being arriued at a place where hee lodged that night, found the paſſage George and Caſtalde diſagreeth for the conduct of the armie. to be exceeding bad for the Artillerie, the way being very narrow, by reaſon of the mountaine and riuer which fronted each other: but yet not ſo rough that it ſhould bee any occaſion to hinder or ſlacke that which hee deſired to doe; yet did the Frier finde it to be a ſufficient ſubiect, to execute his wauering intention. Thus he now ſeeing it was time to accompliſh that which he had imprinted in his braine, hauing ſuruaied the paſſage, declared to Caſtalde that he thought it would bee impoſſible for the great Artillerie to paſſe that place, and that he was of minde that it was good to leaue it there, notwithſtanding  with ſuch a guard of horſe and foote as might defend it, and that himſelfe alone with the field peeces would proceede on the iourney. Caſtalde not liking of that which the Frier aduiſed him of, went himſelfe to view the ſaid paſſage, and ſaw it was not ſo bad, as that it ſhould ſtay or hinder the Artillerie from paſſing: and thinking the Frier was not ſo ſimple, but that he knew this paſſage might eaſily be fitted, iudged in himſelfe that he ſet before them theſe difficulties to no other end, but to ſlacken the deſeignes of Ferdinand. Vpon which conſideration, Caſtalde cauſed good ſtore of Pioners to bee ſet on worke, and made them bring many pickaxes, who within a ſhort  time ſo repayred and enlarged the way, that two horſes might goe in front with a wagon, and ſo by little and little they cut ſo much of the Rocke, and made the paſſage ſo large, that the Artillerie might well paſſe without any inconuenience. Caſtalde with the other Captaines to bring the worke to an end, began themſelues to ſet to their hands, and there they laboured ſo long, till it was farre in the night, in reſpect whereof he was forced there to lodge his Battaile and Rereward, and commaunded certaine Spaniſh Captaines who were then with him, that although it was not yet day, they ſhould march with the Artillerie the reſt of the night, notwithſtanding it was then time rather to repoſe and reſt themſelues, in reſpect of the former daies wearines;  and himſelfe, not being perceiued of any, with his owne guard departed ſecretly out of the Campe, and went from thence priuately to the place, where two miles from Lippa the Frier was lodged, and being entered into his Tent, accompanied with ſundrie Spaniſh and Italian gentlemen (among whom was one Iulian de Carleual) he ſaid to him, that he ſhould not be aſtoniſhed, although they came to him at that time of the night, and in that manner (as hee ſawe) to ſpeake with him, for it was for no other purpoſe, but to knowe the cauſe that moued him without any occaſion, to wiſh him to leaue the great Artillerie, being ſo nigh the enemie, againſt whom notwithſtanding couragiouſly marching, they ſhould be ſure to get vncredible  honor, and making themſelues maſters of Lippa, to obtaine ſo great and honorable reputation, as they might well hope for, from all this warre: and ſo much the rather, for that the enemie had raiſed his Campe from before Themeſuar, vpon the bare bruite of their comming to relieue the beſieged, which vndoubtedly had alreadie purchaſed to them ineſtimable honour,

and great aſtoniſhment to the enemie. The Frier anſwered him; that the occaſion which moued him to come vnto that place with the armie, was, for  that hee thought the Belerbey would intirely retire himſelfe: but, ſith hee vnderſtood that he had not yet paſſed Tibiſcus, it gaue him to ſuſpect ſome further matter, ſeeing that Oliman bouged not from Lippa, but reſolued to withſtand all the inconueniences and hazards of a ſiege, not beleeuing that ſuch a reſolution did proceede from any other thing, but onely of the confidence which the ſaid Oliman repoſed in the neere aſſiſtance of the Belerbey, and that if it were ſo, he could ſee no aſſurance to proceede any further, for that heretofore he neuer incountered with ſo great an armie, compoſed of ſo many warlike ſouldiours, as that of the Turkes was, and that for this occaſion,  and alſo for the regard and care which they ſhould haue of thoſe ſouldiours which were vnder his commaund, hee was very confident that hee was not able to reſiſt them, nor to reconquer the half of that which the Turks had inuaded and gotten, and that therefore hee would not ſo inconſiderately aduenture his perſon and the kingdome together, and that he thought it more expedient to make ſome truce with the enemie, without remouing from the place where they were, conſidering it was to their more aduantage, and that it could not chuſe but bee greatly to the honour and reputation of them all.
            
               Caſtalde tolde him, that ſpecially they were to conſider the foule offence which would be greatly imputed to them, if they retired without ſome iuſt  cauſe, it being reported through the world, that they two were in the field with ſo puiſſant an armie, as that was which they had conducted to this place, with a reſolution to expulſe the Turks out of that kingdom, and that in retyring and leauing Lippa in the enemies poſſeſſion, it might be iuſtly ſaid to bee done, not without ſome ſecret practiſe and conſpiracie which wee ſhould haue with them: and ſpecially the ſame being a towne of great eſteeme, and knowne to be the moſt important key of all Hungarie and Tranſiluania, and conſequently of all Chriſtendome, which being in the Turkes commaund, he might continually make incurſions from thence, with returne of great ſpoyles and robbings, and by many inconueniences endamage  all the whole countries and ſubiects of Ferdinand. Therefore to auoyd that ſtaine of diſhonour, hee moſt inſtantly prayed him, that at the leaſt he would goe to Lippa, and (by Gods aſſiſtance) he would promiſe him to deliuer it into his hands within ſixe daies. In the end he purſued his perſwaſions ſo effectually, that he was content to goe as farre as Lippa, although he often alleadged the great inconuenience which might befall them for want of Artillerie, which by good fortune, and by the diligence of the Spaniſh Captaines, arriued that day at the Campe, to the great admiration of the Frier, who aſſuredly thought they could not bee there in eight daies. This animated Caſtalde preſently to troupe on with 3000. Hungariſh horſe, and  400. men of armes to view Lippa, which of one ſide is ſquare, and of the other Lippa. keepeth the circuite of an ouall forme, ſo that it is more long then broad. The length thereof is 720. paces, and the bredth 380. being of one part (for that the riuer Maroſſe watereth it) very ſtrong, and of the other it ſeemeth

very weake, by reaſon of a mountaine which doth greatly commaund and annoy the defences thereof. It is altogether mured with a wall after the ancient  manner, without any defences and few turrets. There is in the lower part of the towne a little ſquare Caſtle, garniſhed in euery corner with a tower, and is compaſſed about with a deepe Ditch full of water. Preſently vpon Caſtaldes approaching, he lighted from his horſe and walked on foote, and paſſing through certaine gardens, accompanied with Iulian Carleuall, and two other Spaniſh Captaines, he went to peruſe the Ditch, hauing firſt ſent a good troupe of thoſe which he had brought, to dare the Turks to skirmiſh, who by no meanes would aduenture forth to fight, imploying themſelues from the wall wholly to annoy our men with the harquebuze, and hinder  that none ſhould haue a view of the towne. Caſtalde hauing well and diligently viewed all, and after he had cauſed his men to retire, the ſame night he returned againe to the Campe, where he found the Captaines Roderic Vigliandrando, and Francis Henry Teſcieda, who were come forth of Themeſuar to bee at the aſſault of this towne. He fully learned of them the aduentures which had paſſed in that place, and the manner of the Belerbeys retraict, hauing not before vnderſtood any thing for certaine.
            Vpon this newes, the 2. of Nouember they all marched to Lippa, where Lippa beſieged by Caſtalde. all the Campe being arriued, Caſtalde martialled all his battalions and Artillerie before the Turks, with a marueilous crie and confuſed noiſe of all thoſe barbarous nations, and continuing there a certaine time in ſuch apparance,  they tooke poſſeſſion of the Mountaine, and the Frier incamped with his people on the otherſide towards the Caſtle. Caſtalde poſſeſſing all the hill, (which commaunded in manner of a Caualier) quartered thoſe higheſt who were entertained by Ferdinand, namely the Spanyards, Germanes, and Hungars, and cauſed his Tent to be erected in the middeſt of them. Whileſt the Campe lodged there, the Turkes came forth to fire one of the Suburbes, which was well prouided of victuals, and ſpecially of wine which groweth in that quarter, as good as could be deſired. Caſtalde vnderſtanding hereof, commaunded Captaine Iohn Vilioa that preſently he ſhould take 100. Spaniſh  Harquebuziers, and ſo force the enemie to retire: and that after hee had quenched the fire (which alreadie began violently to burne &amp; to ſpread it ſelfe vpon the houſes) he ſhould endeuour as much as he could to ſaue the victuals, for the better reliefe and prouiſion of the Camp, and that he ſhould hinder that they might not bee ſpoyled by thoſe nations. But they could not ſo well bee kept, neither take ſo good order, but that the Friers Aiduchs came and tooke their pleaſure and fill of the wine, in ſuch ſort, as the ſuperfluitie thereof ſo chafed and ſtirred vp their courages, that 500. of them being pricked with that Bacchinall furie, they ranne inſtantly to aſſaile the towne, without ladders or any order, thinking by their brauing tearmes  to ſubuert and ouerthrow the walles. By this ſudden attempt, happened an alarme to the whole Campe, euery man thinking that the Turkes had made ſome ſallie forth to skirmiſh with our men. On the other ſide, the Turkes alſo aſſuring themſelues by this horrible bruite and noyſe, to be aſſailed both with ſcallado and batterie, they preſently ſtood vpon their defence,

couering the walles with men, and with their harquebuzes they made a great ſlaughter of theſe Aiduchs, who like beaſts were eaſily diſcouered;  and graſping the wall, attempted to leape vp, vttering to the Turkes many iniurious ſpeeches (as their manner is) who being couert and attentiue behind the wall, ſhewed them by their defences that they were in double ſafetie, ſo that they at pleaſure ſlew whom they liſted, vntill they were wearie of killing them. On the otherſide, certaine horſemen ſtinged with the ſame mad humour, ranne with their Sables drawne in their hands euen to the Ditch, brauing and menacing the Turkes, who in the end ſeeing their order to be but diſorder, made a great maſſacre of them, as well from the wall as within the Ditch, and with maine ſtrength cauſed them to retire backe. But this retraict was preſently ſtaied by the courage which their companions gaue them,  who offering themſelues to the like perill, ſeemed not any thing to ſhrinke from the daunger. This diſorder had proceeded further then was imagined at the firſt, if the Frier had not hindered it, who ſpeedily thruſt in amongſt them, and cauſed them to retire. And this was the end of this drunken alarme that proceeded of wine, which in the end being appeaſed, the armie was then quietly lodged.
            During this time, there arriued at the Campe a Hungariſh Lord named Patocche a Hungarian Captaine. 
               Patocche, with 400. horſe and 600. foote, which he leauied and brought with him at his owne proper charges, to be imployed in the ſeruice of Ferdinand, during this warre of Lippa. He alſo brought with him foure good peeces  of Artillerie, with which paſſing by a Caſtle that held for the Turkes, not farre from Lippa, he thought good to trie his fortune, and to ſee if he could by any meanes take it by force. Thus arriuing on a ſudden, he aſſailed it with ſo great courage, and with ſo good order, that during the batterie his people behaued themſelues ſo valiantly, that winning one port, and ſetting fire on another, they entered it, killing and vanquiſhing as many Turkes as they found therein, not ſparing any, but onely the Captaine. This place being thus ſacked and burnt, Patocche with his people proceeded on his iourney, leading priſoner with him the Captaine, by whom vnderſtanding of what qualitie and condition he was of, he determined to giue him to Caſtalde. But  neither the one nor the other did long enioy him, becauſe that vpon the day following, as this Captaine marched in the middeſt of the troupes, one of the ſouldiours who was at his taking, vnderſtanding that he was of that qualitie and reputation, that hee might well pay a large raunſome, and that he ſhould haue nothing thereof, for that Patocche had taken him from him: whereupon being poſſeſt with deſpayre, he ſuddenly diſcharged his peece againſt him, betweene his ſhoulders, and ſo mortall was the wound, that he ſuddenly fell dead to the ground, he not minding that any other ſhould poſſeſſe that, which himſelfe could not enioy. This Captaine, as it was afterward knowne, was of ſuch qualitie and parentage, that if the line of the Ottomans 
                had failed, the ſucceſſion of the Empire belonged to none but to him.
            
               Patocche being arriued at the Campe, was honourably receiued by Caſtalde, and great mirth and ioy was made for the good ſucceſſe and taking of

this Caſtle; and not without cauſe, ſince voluntarily and at his owne expences, without any particular hope of profit, but onely in regard and expectation  of honour, he was voluntarily come to ſerue his Prince. The ſame day they had newes alſo, that vpon the Belerbeys retraict, were gone forth of Themeſuar 200. horſe, with 26. Harquebuziers mounted, to cut of the ſtraglers and thoſe who were disbanded from the Turkes Campe, and that theſe returning without performing any thing, they came by a Caſtle named Gala, poſſeſt by the enemies: againſt which preparing themſelues to ſee whether Gala a Caſtle taken by the Hungars, diſguiſed in Turkiſh apparell. they could winne it, they enuironed it, who being diſcouered by the Sentinels, and perceiuing that the Turkes made not any ſhot of Cannon againſt them, nor no other ſhew for their owne ſafeties, they were determined to giue an aſſault to it, and force the Port, and aſſay if by that meanes  they could ſurpriſe it. Which did as fortunately ſucceed as they themſelues deſired: for that the Turkes (in a happie time for our people) expected that day certaine men, which they had ſent to demaund of the Belerbey, power and ſuccour to maintaine themſelues againſt Ferdinands armie, which they knew ſhould preſently march againſt Lippa: and they ſeeing our men comming, did verely thinke that they had been the ſame which they expected, inſomuch that they were not any thing moued or feared therewith, and the rather in reſpect of their habits, who were apparelled after the Turkiſh manner, which they had gotten of thoſe who were dead in the Campe: and being by this traine deceiued, and thinking our people had come to their ayd,  they did not any thing furniſh their guards with more men, but gaue place and commoditie to our ſouldiours to approach neere the Caſtle, and peaceably to enter into it by the Port: the guard of which Port, before that they were knowne, were diſcomforted, and afterwards the enemie perceiuing the deceit, and taking weapons in hand valiantly to defend themſelues, our people were conſtrained to force the reſt of the Caſtle by maine force, and carie the victorie not without great paine and hazard, compelling the Turkes (mauger their wils) to retire to the end of a ſtreete, where, not being able any longer to deſend themſelues, were in the end ouercome by the Spanyards and Hungars, who were on foote, killing as many of them as they could  incounter, without receiuing any damage to themſelues, but by the death of two Spanyards, who at the firſt incounter were ſhot with the enemies Harquebuziers: and after this execution they ſet fire on all, leading all the inhabitants priſoners, and then they retired to Themeſuar. The taking of this Caſtle, although it were of ſmall moment, yet it gaue ſpeciall contentment to euery one, and greatly encouraged the Captaines; not in reſpect of the importance of the thing, as to ſee fortune ſo fauourable, and incline to them in euery place.
            After ſuch ioy and mirth, the night being come, it was decreed that during  the ſame, ſome ſhould bee ſent to ſuruiew Lippa, to approach more neere, and plant the batterie. Of one ſide thereof was ſent Captaine Iohn Viglioa, Don Antonie Azinetta, and Thomas Varcocche. To another part were diſpatched Captaine Vigliandrando, and the Alferus of Lewis Barientos. And Andrew Lopes Sergeant Maior, Iulian de Carleuall, and certaine other Spaniſh

Captaines, had the charge of another quarter. The diligence was great  of euery one to haue knowledge of the towne, and report thereof being made to Caſtalde, he cauſed the very ſame night certaine peeces of Artillerie to be planted vpon the hill which was aboue the towne, neere to the place of Iuſtice, with which the day following he made many a ſhot, to hinder and annoy the enemie that he ſhould not fortifie himſelfe, and to force him to quit the ſtreetes and paſſages about the walles, which from that hill might eaſily be diſcouered. The ſecond night being come, Caſtalde commaunded to begin the batterie on that ſide which Vigliandrando had viewed, as it was generally thought to be the weakeſt and leaſt defencible of any part thereof. That being done, after the vapouring away of the fogge (which towards the  morning doth vſually riſe vpon the riuer) they began vpon the 4. of Nouember to batter the towne with foure double Cannons, &amp; two ſmall Culuerines, with which it was battered al the day long, both in the night following and the morrow after. Caſtalde ſeeing that the Artillerie had ſufficiently effected his purpoſe, was determined the ſame day to giue the aſſault, and not ſuffer the Turkes to haue ſo much leiſure to fortifie themſelues any better, and not minding to impart it to all, he tolde it notwithſtanding to ſome few, in whoſe friendſhip he greatly affied for all that which he purpoſed to doe. But vpon this determination they diſcouered the Fort which the Turks had erected within, inſomuch as they were forced to alter their opinions, and commaunded the Canoniers to increaſe their batterie and ruinate it,  ſaying, that he would not loſe his people at the furie of an aſſault, but would preſerue them for a battaile. The batterie being reenforced with two Cannons, they began to batter ſo terribly againſt theſe Rampiers, that in euery mans iudgement they thought it to be quite ouerthrowne.
            Whileſt they continued their batterie, and that Caſtalde was gone to Frier George, to giue order for that which ſhould be fitting for an aſſault, fiftie Spanyards (who then were out of their quarters, within the Trenches for the guard of them, and to ſee what was done by the batterie) began to diſcourſe and conferre among themſelues of it: the breach ſeeming good &amp; commodious to giue the aſſault: theſe men taking reſolution, becauſe they onely  would haue the glorie to goe thither firſt, were of this minde, that firſt they muſt view it, and that finding it to bee ſo as they verely beleeued, they preſently would haue marched to the breach, without any other companie to aſſiſt them, if it had ſo pleaſed Caſtalde that they ſhould haue gone alone to the aſſault. As they diſcourſed of this enterpriſe among themſelues, a priuate ſouldiour greedie of glorie, offered himſelfe to goe and view it: but he ſo badly viewed it, that he was afterwards the cauſe of great diſorder (as wee ſhall preſently declare) for he reported that it was very reaſonable, not any thing perceiuing the Trench which the Turks had made within, halfe a pike in heigth, and a whole in breadth, raiſed vp with two rankes of baricadoes  one vpon the other full of earth, and well furniſhed with neceſſarie defences: vpon the which they had planted two ſmall peeces of Artillerie, hoping thereby to warrant themſelues from the aſſault which they hourely expected. At the report of this ſouldiour, the fiftie Spanyards being greatly incouraged,

were attentiue to the ſignall which ſhould bee giuen, for that they  would be the firſt which ſhould ſhew themſelues vpon the breach.
            While Caſtalde was with the Frier, accompanied with all the Colonels, Captaines, principall Lords, and many other ſouldiours of the armie, it was concluded to goe to the aſſault, and generally incouraging euery one, and promiſing to them liberall rewards, he ſpake vnto them after this manner.
            
               If it bee true (as the trueth is ſo) that Gods goodnes neuer faileth thoſe, Caſtalde his oration to encourage them to the aſſault of Lippa. who for the maintenance of infallible faith, for iuſtice, and for the good of many, imploy their vttermoſt endeuours: I make no doubt (my ſouldiours) but that this day, fighting for the defence of our Religion, the iuſt cauſe of the King our maſter and Lord, for the deliuerie of Lippa, and for the recouering and preſeruation of this kingdome, that wee ſhall not onely receiue  of God this preſent victorie, which voluntarily prepareth it ſelfe fortunate to vs, but alſo after our death an euerlaſting felicitie in the world to come. And this will be the day (although it ſeemeth ſomewhat perilous) if we fight couragiouſly, which will crowne vs with infinit honour, and infuſe ſuch a feare and terror into our quailing enemies, that increaſing our reputation, it will cauſe the other to tremble, as well at our very names, as at our preſent warlike exploytes. Therefore let euery one of you diſpoſe and prepare himſelfe couragiouſly for the aſſault, and conceiue neither feare or horrour thereof. For it is neceſſarie to all thoſe who are deſirous of glorie, to oppoſe and thruſt themſelues into difficill and daungerous attempts, and not to bee  daunted by any baſe repulſe. O ſouldiours, what a ſhame would it bee to you, hauing in time of peace accuſtomed your ſelues to martiall exerciſes, and in time of warre to ſubdue and conquer, to bee now vanquiſhed and ouercome by the force and proweſſe of the Turks, whom you now ſee alreadie full of feare, through the batterie and ruine of their walles? Therefore I promiſe to thoſe who ſhall be the firſt that this day mount vpon the wall, or that ſhall performe a ſufficient proofe of their valour, to prize and reward them, as their commendable acts doe proclaime them worthie. Thus you being confirmed in a reſolute courage, feare not to goe to it, for that you ſee God is on our ſide, and oppoſite to our enemies, who alreadie begin to feele  his anger, which is manifeſtly ſeene to come vpon them by their broken and defaced walles; by the fearefull ſiege which they painfully, and with great horrour endure, in reſpect of the famine which they piningly ſuffer; by our warlike ſquadrons which we cauſe to march againſt them; and by the death which they within few houres ſhall receiue, to their perpetuall damnation: whereas we dying with valour, ſhall liue eternally. And whileſt wee ſee the occaſion fauourable to vs, euery one ſhould aſſay to ouercome, all of vs animating one another: it being alwaies a commendable thing, that good and valiant ſouldiours in haughtie enterpriſes and difficult attempts, ſhould exhort and encourage one another valiantly to performe his deuoire, to the  end, that through negligence, miſſing of the victorie, it bee not imputed to their diſhonour: and by this meanes, euery one ſhould bee in daunger of blame, if at the leaſt once, he made not triall of his vertue and proweſſe againſt the enemie. And you Hungarian ſouldiours, whom this ſiege doth

more import then any other, valiantly endeuour your ſelues this day to ſhew your vttermoſt vertue and courage; becauſe that in this day you may in the  blood of the Turkes (our common enemies) reuenge the death of your parents, ſlaine and moſt horribly murthered by them, and take reuenge for the rauiſhment of your daughters, the taking away of your ſonnes, the ruinating of your Temples, and the prophaning of your Moneſtaries. I doubt not but bearing your ſelues valiantly, you will carrie away the victorie, and that by the ſlaughter of your enemies, you will ſecure the liues of your countrimen, and reconquer the loſt honour of your townes. Now then, you being all vnited and linked together with one like friendly league of amitie, refuſe not theſe honourable perils, which may make you thrice happie, and of ſubiects make you free; ſince (I aſſure my ſelfe) you haue courages ſo much eſtranged  from feare: and know this, that only to haue a couragious and willing heart in great perils, giueth great hope vnto them to ſaue themſelues; who deſpiſing death, count it all their glorie and renowne to die in an honorable battaile.
            
            Preſently after he had ended theſe ſpeeches (and hauing heard the report of this Spanyard who had viewed the breach (as wee haue aforeſaid) who had alſo certified that with little labour they might eaſily mount to aſſaile it) and that euery one had offered himſelfe, either to winne it, or elſe there honourably to end his life; hee appointed the Enſignes ſhould march to the Trenches, which he commaunded to be made in euery place, that the Turks  by no meanes ſhould either ſaue themſelues, or yet receiue any ſuccours of any ſide. They being all come thither, he cauſed to be proclaimed, as well of his owne behalfe, as alſo of Frier Georges, that whoſoeuer ſhould firſt enter into Lippa, if hee were a gentleman, he ſhould haue giuen him in recompence The meanes to incourage ſouldiours to an aſſault. 200. Duckets of yeerely reuenew, and 200. ſlaues: and if hee were meanly diſſended, that the King would make him noble, and giue him 100. Crownes of yeerely reuenew, with 100. captiues. Vpon this proclamation, thoſe who were in the Trenches, ſeeing the Enſignes to march towards them for the aſſault, deſirous to winne glorie, and to bee the firſt, began directly to march to the breach. The others who came after with the Colours,  ſeeing thoſe Spanyards to iſſue out of their Trenches, thinking that thoſe by a certaine dexterie would carrie that honour away from them, did preſently double their pace to ioyne with them: and thus both the one and the other confuſedly in haſte and without any order ran to the aſſault, the Captaines not being able to remedie it, nor ſtay thoſe who were the firſt that went out of their Trenches, and who arriued there ſomewhat before the other. The Vauntgard being now come thither, Don Antonie de Enzinellia, and Captaine Vigliandrando, without further reſpect of the qualitie of the place, approched to the batterie, and thruſt themſelues in, and hauing with them 30.  approued ſouldiours, they perceiued how the Turks were retrenched within, and how ſtrong their new fortification was, which hindered them from further proceeding; and duly conſidering their Rampiers, they knew that the Turkes had forſaken their Artillerie, and ſhot many arrowes with vollies of Harquebuziers againſt thoſe who firſt attempted to enter. And of all

this they would willingly haue giuen notice to Caſtalde, to renue and ſtrengthen the batterie with more Artillerie, and make the breach more large and  ſaultable, at what time Captaine Aldene arriued there with his Enſignes, with whom (not giuing reſpite to thoſe to execute that, which they not without cauſe had aduiſed vpon) ſuddenly he began to renue the aſſault, and with certaine Hungariſh gentlemen (who to be knowne from others in fighting, had faſtned to their caskes certaine markes) reſolutely entered with the Colours into the breach, couragiouſly forcing themſelues vpon their enemies, it being bruited that theſe were the firſt who mounted vpon the wall: but among the Spanyards and Germanes, the honour thereof was giuen to Iulian de Carleuall to be the firſt that vaunted himſelfe vpon the top of the ruines,  and euen vnto him Caſtalde gaue the due honour and promiſed reward. But the Frier would haue attributed the praiſe thereof to the Hungars. At this aſſault there began a horrible and bloodie fight, with great loſſe of our people, and aduantage to the Turkes, who were 3000. only to defend that little breach, and who alſo fought ſo couragiouſly, that they often durſt ſally out of their Fort or Baricadoes, to fight pell mell amongſt our men, and that euen hand to hand. They firſt ſlew Captaine Aldene, and Don Antonie de Enzinellia, and many other valiant and expert ſouldiours. Captaine Vigliandrando was wounded in the foote with a ſhot, which forced him to fall downe among the dead, and he preſently was ſtriken with a greater bullet, which tooke away the creaſt of his murrion, and if a ſouldiour had not by  force drawne him from thence, he had in like ſort ended there his life among others. They alſo ſlew a Sergeant of Captaine Peter de Auila, named Ferrant Botto, who in the abſence of the right Alferus, that day bare the Colours, which alreadie he had fixed on the top of the Turks Fort, and a Turke cauſing him to fall with a harquebuze ſhot, and minding to pull it out of his hands, he neuer could doe it, vntill aſſiſted by others, he cut off his head, lifting vp by that meanes his Enſigne all tainted with his blood, ſprinkled vpon the Colours which were azure and ſables. They alſo within a while after ſlew the Alferus of Captaine Aldene, and wounded thoſe of Captaine Diego Velez, and Mendoze, out of whoſe hands they violently pluckt away  their Enſignes. The which thoſe ſeeing who were had out of the throng, the wounded were forced to retire themſelues, and after their retraict, the Turks ſallied forth and cut off the heads of Aldene and Antonie, and of certaine others whom they thought to be of the principalleſt, either for that they ſaw them valiantly to fight, or elſe, in that they were better ſet forth in armes and abiliments then the other. And ſeeing they had wonne 4. of our Enſignes, they became by this victorie ſo peremptorie and proude, that they aduentured to come forth of the breach to fight with our people, and ſo ſhamefully to chaſe them from their walles and Ditches, with ſuch a ſlaughter, that it  was incredible, and ſtill they carefully kept their rankes. Whileſt Ferdinands people were thus miſerably beaten, and the Turkes ſo couragiouſly reſiſted their aſſaults, Castalde aduiſed and reſolued that this night Lippa ſhould be taken, how deare ſoeuer it coſt him, in reſpect to auoyd the perill which might afterward enſue, vpon the comming of the Belerbey, who

was ſaid to be on his way to relieue Oliman. Vpon which aduertiſement, calling all the Captaines into his preſence and the Friers, reprouing their cowardiſe,  and incouraging them to renue the aſſault; with ſuch words thus deliuered, he put courage againe into them.
            
               If euer the memorie of high exploytes and glorious acts of any whoſoeuer, hath had the force to moue the hearts and courages of men, and to prick Caſtalde his oration to encourage the ſouldiours to the aſſault at Lippa. them forward to a like commendable deſire; it is euen this day, and that by a more vehementer reaſon (my ſouldiours) by the vile &amp; infamous retraict, that againſt all expectation, you haue vntimely ſhewen, which ought now to haue power and commaund ouer your. For which I ſee you, with an vnlooked for loſſe, ſo much diſcouraged, that hardly (containing my heart from breaking) can I with patience endure to behold you. And although that we  cannot alwaies haue in our power our owne deſires and fortune vnited together, yet ought wee not for all that to ſuffer, that that courage which in vs ſhould be inuincible, ſhould remaine ſuppreſſed by this fortune, for any aduerſitie whatſoeuer. Truly whoſoeuer now ſhould ſee theſe ſhamefull things in you (who alwaies heretofore haue been victorious, as if to vanquiſh were to you peculiar) I know not what they ſhould cenſure, but that, conſidering your former victories, they might imagine that you haue rather wonne them by ominous fortune, then by your owne proper vertue; ſince that by ſo great diſhonour you haue ſuffered your ſelues to be ſhamefully ouercome, and in the middeſt and furie of the fight, like women and children  to be beaten away by the Turks. You may well thereby thinke that the glorie of your precedent feates of armes, which (vntill now) appeared to the world by your great triumphs, is now darkened and obſcured by this ignominious repulſe, with which incouraging theſe enemies, whom ſo often you haue ouerthrowne and ſubdued, you are the only cauſe that in time to come they will not any more feare you, ſeeing your courage, your force, and agilitie is decayed. It ſeemeth to me a wonder and a great infamie, that the victorious dreadeth the vanquiſhed. And beleeue me (ſouldiours) there is not in the world a greater ruine and confuſion, then when an armie debaſing it ſelfe, by giuing courage to his enemie, leaueth it ſelfe ouercome by puſalinimitie.  For then, in what diſaduantage ſoeuer, it muſt diſſolue and diſperſe it ſelfe, for that it often happeneth in warres, the valour and reſolution of the minde, profiteth more then that of the bodie. If this day, and during theſe aſſaults, you duly conſider of the honor and end of this warre, you will manifeſtly ſee it a ſufficient motiue to incite you to recouer your firſt loſt proweſſe, and conceiue that ſubtiltie and wiſedome nothing auaileth, where is an apparant defect of courage and valour. Therefore preſent neceſſitie doth vrge and conſtraine you this day, to ſhew your ſelues valiant and vertuous ſouldiours, for that you ſhall not now fight for a toy of nothing, but for life it ſelfe, for the countries good wherein you were nouriſhed and brought vp,  for your wiues and children, for your ſiſters and kindred, and finally for all diuine and humane things, and for your goods: which if you remaine victorious, they remaine yours as they haue been before; and on the contrarie, they muſt bee a ſpoyle for the enemie if you will loſe your ſelues. You alreadie

know how the Belerbey of Greece, and Baſha Achmeth are on the way with an huge number of horſe and foote to relieue Lippa; If they ſhuld  arriue, and wee not haue taken the towne, what might then become of vs? Therefore if you deſire (as it is moſt requiſite you ſhould doe) to auoid theſe imminent dangers with an honourable victorie, to increaſe your reputation, and not to interre or obſcure it; valiantly endeuour your ſelues to ouercome, and fight with an aſſured and manly courage, ſtill bearding and facing the enemie: for thoſe who are deſirous of victorie, doe neuer turne their backes. And doe you thinke, that ſeeking the ſafetie of your liues, to finde it by flying? No, no, you haue alreadie ſeene by experience the contrarie, that more haue been ſlaine by flight, then fight. Aſſure your ſelues then, that if you doe not with your beſt abilities, endeuour your ſelues to ouercome, you  will neither finde place, mountaine, nor forreſt which can preſerue you in ſafetie, but all things ſhall be contrarie and aduerſe to you, and in the end you ſhall leaue as a pray to your enemies, thoſe things which you moſt dearely eſteeme of: which neuertheleſſe by meanes of victorie, winning this towne, you may preſerue; and there is no doubt but the enemies wil be faint-harted and begin to humble themſelues, and in their retiring they will giue you ſpeciall meanes to recouer that, which hath been loſt and poſſeſſed by euill hap; and to purchaſe with a glorious name (fruſtrating them from al hope euer to bee maſters of you againe) this libertie, this quiet repoſe, and this happie  peace which you ſo much deſire and long for, vnchaining your ſelues from the perpetuall ſeruitude, in which for preſent example, you may to your griefes beholde your neighbours. For there is not any thing that doth more aſtoniſh and terrifie an enemy, then a ſudden onſet and gallant charge; nor nothing which doth more animate a friend, then to recouer a deſpairing victorie, as this day may happen to you, if you will. Returne then (my ſouldiours) to the aſſault, with a prefixed deſire to carie the victorie from thence, and not to flie at any hand, and rather aduenture to die honourably for it, then in loſing, to ſuruiue with ſhame; conſidering that to die is common to all, but to die with reputation is bequeathed but to few. And I aſſure my ſelfe, that if you more reſpect that which I haue ſaid vnto you, then the liberall  offers which I haue made you, you ſhall within few houres remaine victorious to your great glorie, and to the exceſſiue loſſe of our enemies, and you ſhall in the end ſee that no corporall force can euer ſurmount the vertue, which this day will make both you and me to be eternall.
            
            This ſaid, hauing firſt reenforced the batterie with more Artillerie, he preſently cauſed an alarme in the whole Campe. At the bruite whereof, they all in good order went to the wall with ladders and other engines to mount vpon it, and to obtaine the breach, which now was ſomewhat inlarged, enuironing the towne with more then 40000. men. There was within it only  for the defence of the breach 3000. Turkes, and 100. Ianiſaries, and in all with the people of Oliman, there was ſome 5000. men appointed in places conuenient. Thus they began cruelly to fight as well within as without, and very fiercely with ſo great cryes of thoſe barbarous nations, and ſuch a thunder of our Artillerie, ſounding of Drummes and Trumpets, that it ſeemed

the world would preſently haue ended. And the great diſorder which  was committed in many places of the aſſault, being reported to Caſtalde, he preſently cauſed all the men of armes and Caualarie to march with him, appointing both the one and the other where they ſhould attend with their ſquadrons, conſidering that there was leſſe perill and daunger in ſuch diſorder, then to cauſe his men to retire, vpon whoſe retraict he iudged greater inconuenience would enſue. And approaching nigh the breach, he ſaw that Oliman had appointed 600. horſe in a place by, and very neere to them, well foreſeeing the end which would betide him, who had appointed them there not onely to ſuccour the breach, but with a reſolute purpoſe alſo to ſaue himſelfe with them, ſeeing alreadie he could not any longer reſiſt, nor withſtand  our men from entering by force into the towne, perceiuing that he was forſaken of the ſuccours which hee expected from Buda: and with thoſe horſe, for the ſame reſpect, he had mixed certaine bands of Ianiſaries. Caſtalde perceiuing this, and the more to expell Oliman from all hope of ſafetie &amp; ſuccours, he ſent Iohn Turky with 4000. horſe, and Charles Scheretin with his 400. men of armes to poſſeſſe the other ſide of the riuer Maroſſe, by which paſſage might come the ayde which he expected from the Baſha of Buda and the Belerbey, and by which place alſo he might haue ſome hope to ſaue himſelfe. And thus ioyntly with the Frier (who that day performed the acts of an expert and valiant Captaine) he prouided for all things which George a valiant Captain. were neceſſarie, now riding on this ſide, then on the other, as one that perfectly  vnderſtood the proceedings of martiall affaires, who failed not to conſider of all accidents which might befall him in any reſpect whatſoeuer, thinking on fit meanes to remedie the ſame. On the other ſide Oliman loſt no time, but animating his people, he effected that the beſieged fighting couragiouſly, endured a very ſore aſſault, which was for foure houres very bloodie on both ſides, in which the Turkes did not any thing yeeld to our people. Certaine Captaines of thoſe who were the firſt that mounted vp the breach with Iulian de Carleual, ſeeing the Turkes ſo brauely defended themſelues, and that it was now growing late, and not minding to ſee ſo many as they had alreadie loſt, to be caſt away, aduertiſed Caſtalde that their  aduice was to ſound a retraict, ſeeing the fight had ſo long time endured, and that therein the Turkes had made a great ſlaughter of our people. Caſtalde returned them preſent anſwer, that they ſhould firmely maintaine the fight, and that they ſhould remember, that the aſſault which in former time they had giuen to Dure, had in like ſort continued foure houres; and that by any meanes howſoeuer, they ſhould not faile but that the towne might bee taken that night: and if they entered not that night, (beſides the loſſe of their reputation, which is a thing of ſpeciall importance in feates of warre) they ſhould put themſelues in daunger, to leaue there that glorie  with loſſe of their liues; which (in reſiſting) would aſſuredly ſhroud them from ſuch ſiniſter accidents: and that further he plainly ſaw, how the retraict would be farre more dangerous, then the entering.
            At this time Frier George (couered then with a greene caſſocke, by which he hid his habit, for feare of being knowne by the enemies) and Counte

               Thomas Nadaſdy came together to the aſſault, and to the quarter where the Germanes and Spaniards were mingled with other nations, who animating  them, ſaid, that they ſhould couragiouſly force themſelues to enter into the towne, to reuenge the blood of their friends, who yet freſh before their eyes had been cruelly ſlaine and wounded, and in many places pitifully ouerthrowne by the Turkes. Whileſt theſe two on the one ſide animated the ſouldiours, Caſtalde on the other ſide perceiued that the Caualarie, which Oliman had ordered in a ſquadron by the breach, began to recoyle and retire backe, which was a likelihood they could not any longer reſiſt, and that they ſhould be either forced to flie, or preſently to yeeld. He taking hold of this oportunitie, commaunded preſently that the 200. men of armes of Oureſtolf 
                ſhould diſmount from their horſes, and that one part of them taking the Target and Cutlace, and the other the Pike, ſhould force the breach. He had alſo before appointed, that all the ſtraglers of the Campe, only armed with the Hatchet, a la Hungreſque, ſhould goe to that hill which commaunded the towne, in forme of a Caualier, and that there with ſome brauing ſhew, they ſhould make a view and front of ſouldiours, whereby the Turkes ſeeing them, they would iudge them to be ſouldiours indeede, who came to aſſaile that part of the wall which was oppoſite to them: theſe people made a ſhew of an infinit number of men. Caſtalde then preſently ſent to the Captaine that commaunded them, that inſtantly when hee ſhould ſee the aſſault renued, that then he ſhould deſcend from the hill with all his people, and with  the cries and ſhrikings, vſuall to that nation, he ſhould directly march to the wall of the towne, to giue (although not effectuall) yet at the leaſt, in ſhew, a feare of a cruell aſſault. That done, he went where he had cauſed thoſe men of armes to diſmount themſelues, who were readie to goe to the breach, and ſaid to them, enter, enter my companions, the houre is now come which will make vs, together with this victorie, very glorious. Theſe ſpeeches ſo kindled the heart and courage of euery man, that the Turkes, when they expected our men would haue retired, ſeeing them come with greater courage to the breach then before, and alſo perceiuing the others, who at the ſame  inſtant with great cries deſcended from the hill directly towards them, they began ſo faintly to abate their courage, that preſently loſing all heart and valour, they ſuffered our people to enter into the towne, ſome at the breach, and others in other places, with a great throng and preſſe of our Vauntgard, which then was conducted by the Marqueſſe Sforce Palauicin, who at the Sforce Palauicin. ſame time alſo behaued himſelfe valiantly in the fight, as in all other his former actions he had done, diſcharging the Artillerie ſo effectually againſt the towne, that it was an incredible thing. Captaine Iohn Viglioa was the firſt that mounted vpon the wall, and preſently he was ſeconded by Francis de Salcede who bore his Colours, and who was onely remaining, all the reſt being taken away at the firſt aſſault by the Turkes. Carleual was alſo one of the  firſt vpon the breach, and in like ſort entered many of the Hungars, and other Lippa taken by aſſault of Caſtalde. ſouldiours who were the firſt that aduanced themſelues at the breach, vpon which was ſeene more then 1200. dead Turkes. All the Ianiſaries, who were the laſt that ſhronke or retired, and the other who remained aliue with Oliman,
               
began with ſuch feare and ſo tumultuouſly to flie to the Caſtle, that it was a marueilous thing to ſee thoſe men ſo vilely forſake and diſperſe themſelues,  that had before ſo gallantly defended their liues, by the ſpace of more then fiue houres. Ferdinands people being entered into the towne, they found not any Turke who durſt lift vp his ſword againſt them, but ſuffered themſelues to be beaten downe like beaſts: and the noyſe was ſo great both within and without, that nothing elſe was heard but grieuous ſighings and groanes of thoſe who gaue vp the ghoſt, and ſuch a confuſed medly of others, who not finding any to incounter withall, &amp; crying victoria, victoria, kill, kill, did runne vp and downe through all Lippa like mad men, and afterwards ſacked the towne. The Turkes who were on horſebacke thinking  to ſaue themſelues, forſooke the towne, and they fell into the ambuſcado of thoſe horſes, which (as we haue aforeſaid) were for that purpoſe ſent by Caſtalde to guard the riuer, and there by theſe horſemen they were miſerably diſordered, and the greateſt part of them ſlaine. The remainder willing to auoyde this bloodie perill, fell into another the like or more great, and for one death receiued two; becauſe, that venturing into the riuer to ſaue themſelues by ſwimming to the otherſide, the Hungarians, Germanes, and Bohemians ſetting themſelues againſt them, pearced both them and their horſes with their Launces on euery ſide, inſomuch that he who died not by dint of the ſword, was forced pitifully to end his life in the water and to drowne  himſelfe, a long time ſtayning the water with their blood. The other ſeeing their companions thus badly intreated, and returning vpon the ſpurre to the towne, with hope to ſaue themſelues in the Caſtle, were by our men in all parts ſo cut off and ſlaine, that not a man could ſaue himſelfe. Oliman (who alſo had forſaken the towne with a good troupe of horſe, with intent to ſaue himſelfe) ſeeing what was done to others, tooke for the laſt refuge, which fortune that day alotted to him to ſaue his life, (wherein moſt of his people loſt their liues) a reſolution to ſaue himſelfe in the Caſtle. Flying thither a pace, he found there a great throng of his people, that as yet remained ſafe from this furious and bloodie tempeſt, who for the great preaſe to ſaue themſelues from ſlaughter, endeuoured to enter in, many falling from the  railes of the bridge into the Ditch ſorely bruſed and cruſht in peeces, and by this time there was more then fiftie horſe and men ouerthrowne therein, who with their maſters there periſhed. Oliman being alſo arriued at that time, mixt himſelfe with this throng, although he often ſaw himſelfe almoſt troden downe by this multitude, and entered into the Caſtle vpon the bridge, whereon there was alſo ſome of our people mingled among them: and if then they had bin well aduiſed to haue throughly charged thē on that ſide, they might eaſily that day (which was the 6. of Nouember) haue taken the Caſtle, and Oliman had neuer been ſaued. But the deſire and couetouſnes  of gaine (which too vſually happeneth in ſuch caſes) ſo blinded euery one, as it was omitted, and not any thing thought of. Now all the towne being ſacked, (wherein was gotten great ſpoyle) and the night come, Castalde cauſed all the Caſtle to bee enuironed, and placed about it good and ſtrong The Caſtle of Lippa beſieged. guards, for feare leaſt the enemie, by the obſcuritie and fauour of the night,

occaſion to bee incenſed againſt this countrie, onely contenting themſelues with this that they had alreadie done againſt him, in taking this towne by  force, and hauing killed therein ſo many valiant ſouldiours of his, and forcing the Belerbey to retire with ſhame: and on the contrarie, it was now more expedient to ſweeten and temper his crueltie by milde courſes; to effect which, he thought it good to let all thoſe freely and in ſafetie paſſe, who were retired into that little Caſtle. Castalde replying, ſaid vnto him, that by no meanes he would ſuffer ſuch a ſtearne enemie as Oliman was to ſcape, ſeeing they now had him in their hands, and that none but God ſhould free him thence: and that vſing ſuch rigour and ſeueritie in his proceedings, he ſhould begin to abate the pride and boldnes of the Turk, and by no meanes  he would ſuffer ſuch fauourable occaſions to ſlip away, which of a long time they found not ſo happy and fortunate to them as now; and that they ſhould not haue (it might bee) in time to come ſo proſperous ſucceſſe, as this which was now offered by this good occaſion. The Frier neuertheleſſe ſtill contradicting him, and maintaining that it was needfull to ſaue Oliman, and the end at which he aymed being manifeſt to all the Campe, as that alſo which the Slauonian had confeſſed (who a little before was taken) he was in the end forced to diſcouer his wicked intent, and plainly to tell Caſtalde, that for no mans pleaſure hee would not become enemie to the Turke, but that hee meant to ſet Oliman at libertie, and permit him freely to depart with his  armes, horſe, and all his people who were with him, and that if this could not be done, he muſt be forced to defend him againſt any who would withſtand it. Caſtalde anſwered him, that ſince he had determined to doe ſo, this was his aduice, that before hee would conclude any other thing, hee would cauſe all the principall Lords and Captaines of Ferdinands armie, and them of Tranſiluania, to bee called together in a publike aſſemblie, to the end that euery one might ſpeake his opinion thereof, and that by this meanes they ſhould haue no occaſion to complaine, that they were depriued of that honour and profit, which they had dearly purchaſed with their owne blood and with extreame paine, without giuing them to vnderſtand ſome good  matter therefore, and that they ſhould not haue any occaſion to complaine of them two. The Frier liked very well of this motion, aſſuring himſelfe that none neither would nor durſt contradict his will. And thus being in his Tent, accompanied with Caſtalde, Andrew Battor, Thomas Nadaſdy (who not long before was made Palatine of Hungarie) Perein Peter, Iohn Turky, the Marqueſſe of Balaſſe, and other Lords and Captaines, as well Hungarians and Bohemians, as Spanyards and Germanes, and with them all the Deputies of townes and prouinces of the kingdome, Frier George in the preſence of them all began thus to ſpeake in Latin:
            
               My louing Lords and friends, I perſwade my ſelfe you are not ignorant, Frier George his oration. how much the force and terrour of the Grand Seigniour is to be redoubted  and Feared, in reſpect of his imperiall rule and command, which I know hath been by experience too ſoone proued by you, to your vnſpeakeable detriment, by the ruinating of your townes, and death of your deare friends and kindred: and in like manner you know of the enormious cruelties, which at

his pleaſure and in his furie he knoweth iuſtly or iniuſtly to vſe againſt men  and women, ſparing neither children nor virgins, vſing fire and ſword not onely againſt you, but alſo againſt your Temples, houſes, and laſtly the very trees, plants, and beaſts themſelues, are not any thing warranted from the furie of his barbarous ire. For this cauſe I eſteeme it to be more then neceſſarie, that wee wilfully draw not more hatefull indignation vpon our ſelues, then that which alreadie his people naturally are poſſeſt withall againſt our Religion, and former iniuries: but on the contrarie, that wee endeuour our ſelues by all meanes and manners to appeaſe him, and to make him mild and mercifull, that in time to come, he contenting himſelfe with the accuſtomed tribute, he may ſuffer vs to liue in peace, &amp; quietly poſſeſſe our goods, without any  dread of warre. To accompliſh which, I am of this minde to imploy therein this Oliman Bech, now ſtraightned by you in this Caſtle of Lippa, to whom and to his people giuing libertie ſafely to depart, ſhall recite to the Grand Seigniour our good and friendly intention, who, in reſpect of ſo friendly a deliuerance, will rake vp in obliuion the reuenge, which otherwiſe he would violently vſe againſt vs, for the wrongs which he hath receiued by vs in this warre, and no doubt he will let vs poſſeſſe this tranquiltie and peace, which is ſo vehemently deſired of euery one. Therefore I earneſtly deſire you, that well conſidering of my words, you would follow my counſell, and imbrace this my good intention, which is ſincerely ſpoken for  the publike good, and that you would not through any ambition ſeeke to put Oliman and his people to death, or retaine them priſoners: becauſe that when you haue put them all to the ſword, yet can you not cleere your ſelues neither of hate nor further trauaile, conſidering that the Grand Seigniour hath no want of other men and forces, hauing fifteene miles from hence more then 40000. men, readie to reuenge their deaths; and as I am certainly informed by a friend, (which euen at this time is come to me from their Campe) that the Belerbey and Baſha of Buda, will within a ſhort time come to aſſaile vs: which if it proueth to be ſo, what then ſhall become of vs? what hope of kindnes can we expect, hauing not vſed any curteſie towards their  people? Therefore we iudge it better for vs not to bee found beſieging of them, knowing this, that beſides all kinde of horrible and cruell death, they will reuenge vpon our heads, and deare friends, their mens blood which we haue ſhed. We may auoyde and ſuppreſſe theſe cruelties, by our clemencie and milde proceedings, and may thereby make him of an enemie, to become gentle, tractable, and gratious, there being not in this world any glorie more extolled and recommended then that, which is gotten in hauing compaſſion of an enemie, who feeleth himſelfe reduced to the extreamitie of his honour and life; neither is there any magnanimitie more illuſtrious, then to pardon thoſe, whoſe liues are in the victors power to diſpoſe of. 
               
            
            At theſe ſpeeches of the Frier, Gaſtalde (as the chiefe and principall man among them) made this effectuall replie: It was not needfull that you (moſt Caſtalde his reply, reuerend Sir) ſhould haue ſent (not few moneths ſince) to the Emperour Charles the 5. to promiſe him vpon your faith, that you would alwaies be as well fauourable to the Chriſtians, as on the other ſide a cruell and mortall

enemie to the Turkes: neither was it in like ſort neceſſarie, that you ſhould deſire Ferdinand King of the Romanes to ſend you ſuccours, and deliuer  this kingdome of Tranſiluania, from the tyrannicall oppreſſion of the common enemie, if you would haue vſed theſe courſes, which now with a diſhonourable reputation I ſee you practiſe. And although that Ferdinand did not any thing doubt of your inconſtancie, hauing before too truly had experience thereof: yet neuertheleſſe not taking regard to this your ſudden alteration, he was willing to aſſemble this armie together, and againſt the opinion &amp; counſell of many to ſend it to your ayd. And this force hath been ſuch, that not onely it hath holpen this kingdome, and you your ſelues from the tyrannie of Infidels; but alſo it hath recouered a great part of the countrie,  which by force and treacherie was vſurped by them. Now what occaſion moueth you, being victorious, and hauing put your enemies to flight, wittingly to bring your ſelues into thraldome, and with ſhame procure that wee, and all you the reſt, ſhould bee ſubiect to thoſe which wee now detaine priſoners, and are conſtrained to yeeld themſelues to our diſcretion, and to intreate vs, that we ſhould recommend our ſelues to him who is the capitall enemie, not onely of our libertie, but alſo of our holy and inuiolable faith: and to manifeſt ſo great cowardlines by fearefull words to thoſe, who to our great glorie (manifeſting our couragious hearts) we haue ouercome and tamed; and eſpecially at this time, who as it were quite caſt away, betake themſelues  to ſuch infamous compoſitions, that they ſhew themſelues vnworthie of life, as aſſuredly they would eſteeme of you, if you had bin vanquiſhed by them, manifeſting thereby, that they are not worthie to be heard of ſo noble and honourable perſonages as theſe Lords here preſent, and all theſe nations which are about vs, who not long ſince for their countrie, honour, life, libertie, and freedome from ſo horrible captiuitie, haue ſhed ſo much blood, that Maroſſe ranne coloured of another hew? What ſhould auaile this famous reputation, which with ſo many trauailes, ſo many hazards, and with the death of ſo many valiant perſons hath been atchieued, if now by a cowardly compoſition you would let it be loſt? Doe you not ſee that in yeelding to  thoſe who are you priſoners, you will wholly loſe your boldnes hereafter to dare the enemie to the fight, neither ſhall you bee able at any time to make warre vpon them, for that they will alwaies preſume to hold you in ſo great ſubiection and little eſteeme, that tenne of them will not feare to aſſaile an hundred of you, in which you will the rather aſſure them, in reſpect of your fearfulnes; and ſo the concluſion will be, that of vanquiſhers, you are like to become vanquiſhed. I would gladly know what doth incite and incourage ſouldiours, if it be not glorie and reputation, and to gaine therewith by their trauaile and induſtrie, honour, renowne, and recompence? And now, that with great admiration you haue atchieued it, and brought to happie end  this warre, would you with your great ſhame and loſſe, leaue to the enemie this triumphant victorie and reputed fame, which in euery place will raiſe you vp to the heape of all honour and praiſe? What will the Chriſtians mutter among themſelues, if not, but that you haue been fearefull to ſee the Turkes in your power, and that you rather haue fled away, then had the

courage to detaine them priſoners? Doe you not thinke, you Hungarians,  Saxons, and Sicilians, that the palme of victorie ſhall be giuen to the Spanyards, Germanes, and Bohemians, and that in ſtead hereof you ſhall be noted of infamie, ſuffering ſo ſhamefully the enemie to depart, and to haue accepted of ſo cowardly a compoſition which they demaund of you, cleerely thereby manifeſting to euery one, the feare which you conceiue of him? Alas (my Lords) remember your fathers, children, brothers, and kindred, who haue been miſerably ſlaine, or faſtned in chaines by theſe Turkes, and thinke vpon your wiues, which not without your great diſhonor, haue been violently carried away and rauiſhed by thoſe, whom you now hold in your ſeruitude: and if for the premiſed cauſes you will not vſe to them the rigour  of iuſtice, eitherin killing, or detaining them priſoners, as at this preſent they hold your children, brothers, and friends; yet at the leaſt make them acknowledge that their liues, liberties, their armes, horſes, and Enſignes are at your mercie and diſpoſe, which if you will needes graunt them theſe things, yet let them acknowledge by ſpeciall grace and fauour to haue receiued them of you, and not by a forced conſtraint, or by ſome certaine feare. And neuer reſpect any falſe or fained aduertiſements, nor threats which are bruted of the Baſhaes and Belerbeys comming, for that he flying, hath alreadie paſſed Danubius with all his armie: and though he ſhould returne againe, you ſhall manifeſtly ſee that our ſouldiours, taſting of the happie former ſucceſſe,  will be more diſpoſed to fight with him, then we expect for; inſomuch that both in the one and in the other, we may frankly promiſe our ſelues certaine victorie; and that ſo much the rather, becauſe that courage is wanting in him (in regard of the diſcomfortures which he hath receiued) and will be increaſed in vs, by reaſon of the victories which wee happely and valiantly haue performed and atchieued againſt them.
            
            Vpon this declaration, all thoſe of the Councell began to looke vpon Frier George, and to chaunge their opinions, ſeeing it was an infamous and foule fault, to let Oliman eſcape vnpuniſhed for his wickedneſſes and cruelties, as the Frier earneſtly importuned. And the concluſion was, that by no  meanes he ſhould haue any libertie, but that they would ſo diſpoſe of him, as he would doe of them, if they were in the like tearmes. Frier George ſeeing that neither in priuate nor publike hee could performe that which hee greatly deſired, and that his reaſons were not allowed of, preſently ſaid in great choler to Caſtalde; that although he would not graunt it, yet notwithſtanding, in conſideration of the publike good and tranquilitie of Tranſiluania, he meant to ſaue Oliman. Caſtalde would make him no anſwer, but increaſed in himſelfe the hatred which he bare againſt him, and the great deſire he had to haſten on his death, he manifeſtly knowing how much he fauoured the Turks affayres, and held thoſe of Ferdinands in diſgrace. Preſently when the Councell was riſen, the Frier diſpatched a meſſenger to Oliman, 
                to informe him that he ſhould preſently ſend two of his principall Captaines, to treate with him of the compoſition which he demaunded, he hauing determined and concluded to ſaue him. They being come, the Frier obſeruing the accord which alreadie he had ſecretly made with them, gaue

them ſafe conduct to come foorth and depart with their armes, horſes, Enſignes, and baggage, accommodating them of waggons to carrie the wounded.  And that they might march with more ſafetie, he demaunded that Caſtalde would giue them ſome other ſafe conduct, wherby that Oliman ſhould not in any ſort bee diſturbed by theſe nations which he commaunded. To which Caſtalde would by no meanes yeeld; and thereof excuſing himſelfe ſaid vnto him, that hee would vpon no condition giue him words for payment, nor ſatisfie that his demaund, in reſpect of the cruell enmitie which he knew to bee naturally betweene the Turkes and his people, who thought it not good to let Oliman ſo ſecurely depart, and that he diſtruſted it would be impoſſible to withſtand them from following him. In the end the Frier preſſed him ſo farre, that he was forced to promiſe for all thoſe who were in Ferdinands 
                pay, after which he gaue a good conuoy to Oliman, to conduct him to the place of ſafetie. He at laſt came out of the Caſtle with 1000. Turkes, Oliman departeth in ſafetie from Lippa, by the meanes of George. Vercherez. which remained of 1300. who were ſlaine by the Artillerie, and cauſing all the baggage and wounded to bee martialled in the Vauntgard, they began to march towards the Caſtle of Vercherez (where that night the Belerbey was) and being lodged twelue miles from Lippa, he priuately came from thence in the night to ſee the Frier, who had ſent before him a 1000. horſe to conduct him with more ſafetie, and being in conference foure long houres together in the Friers Tent, he in the end tooke leaue, and retired himſelfe where his people attended him, and remaining there the reſt of the night, at  breake of day (in the beſt manner he could) he raunged his Turkes in battaile, and ſo departed thence, proceeding on his iourney towards the Belerbey.
            At the ſame inſtant that Oliman departed forth of Lippa, the Marqueſſe of Balaſſe ſecretly went out of the Campe with his 200. horſe, not acquainting any perſon therewith. With him alſo ioyned 2000. horſe more, who ſtole forth of the armie, for the deſire which they had to maſſacre theſe Turkes, becauſe that they did not a little complaine for the agreement which the Frier had made, in ſuffering them ſo ſafely to depart, and warranting them  from the furie of theſe nations, who had receiued by them cruell burnings, irrecouerable loſſes, and infinit inconueniences. For the ſame exploite alſo went out of Themeſuar 200. other horſe, with whom was Alphonſe Perez de Saianedra, who ioyned himſelfe with the Marqueſſe. They being all in this manner aſſembled, and ſwiftly riding on, ouertooke Oliman in a plaine field, where was neither tree nor buſh which hindered them from being diſcouered. When he perceiued our men, he began to march more cloſely together, the moſt part of his people being on foote, hauing in the middeſt of his ſquadron foure or fiue waggons, about which with the wounded he placed 35. Harquebuziers, that of the reſt remained aliue vnto him. The Marqueſſe  (the better to ſet vpon him) preſently ordered his people, and when he perceiued himſelfe to draw neere Olimans ſquardron, he by good ſpeech prouoked his owne people, placing himſelfe in the fore ranke, thinking at this firſt ſhocke to force the Turkes, who not to ſpend their ſhot in vaine, made no great haſte to diſcharge their Harquebuzes, but ſo effectually they

ſhot, that at the firſt vollie the Marqueſſe was wounded, and his horſe ſlaine,  ſo that he fell to the ground. His followers ſeeing him fall, fearing the horſes would runne ouer him, opened and diuided themſelues in that manner, that of one ſtrong ſquadron, they made two weake ones, and running with more furie then diſcretion againſt Oliman, not being able to reunite themſelues againe, the one bare in vpon the Vauntgard of the Turkes, and the other vpon the Rereward, leauing the battaile of Oliman ſecure, and not any thing broken. The Turkes taking courage of this their vnlooked for aduantage, and ſeeing Oliman fought ſo gallantly, carefully endeuoured themſelues ſtill to march cloſe together, and all the way they fought ſo brauely, that our men neuer durſt returne to aſſaile them, but quietly ſuffered them to  depart to the place where the Belerbey expected them.
            After that Oliman was thus departed from Lippa, they began from the The meanes that Caſtalde vſed to intrap George. next day after to permit thoſe who were ſent from the kingdome, to returne againe, and Caſtalde alſo demaunded of the Frier, that thoſe who were of Ferdinands pay ſhould be lodged in Tranſiluania. But the Frier would not that any of theſe nations ſhould enter into thoſe countries, but that rather they ſhould be lodged in the Countie of Varadin, excuſing himſelfe by the charges which alreadie that kingdome had been at, and that in biliting his ſouldiours within that countrie, (it being now peaceable and quiet) would bee a beginning to ruinate and ſpoyle it, he thinking it farre better that they ſhould be in garriſon in places of his Biſhopricke, where (in his iudgement)  they ſhould liue more commodiouſly and profitably, it being a plentifull countrie, and neighbouring vpon the frontiers of the enemie, rather then to place them in Tranſiluania, where Ferdinand had not ſo much to doe, as in the foreſaid places. Caſtalde ſeeing this ſpeech did greatly diſcouer him, and being needfull for him to manage theſe affayres with more policie, then before he had done, ſaid to the Frier, that he thought it good and conuenient that they ſhould ſend backe the Artillerie into the kingdome, from whence it was brought, and that with ſo good a guard, as belonged to a matter of ſuch moment. The Frier was well content therewith, but with this condition, that there ſhould bee no more then one hundred Germanes to  conduct it: which Caſtalde agreed vnto, and preſently ſent word to his Captaines, that they ſhould cauſe the Artillerie to march, before the Frier knew thereof, and that therewith ſhould goe fiue Enſignes of Germanes, hauing charge to put one part within Albe-iula, and the other in neighbouring places by. And in the meane time, he with his beſt skill declared to Frier George, that it was very neceſſarie to leade the ſouldiours into the kingdome, not ſo much for the aſſurance thereof, as to recreate them, in recompence of their trauailes which they had endured, and for their exceeding valour which they had manifeſted at the aſſaults of Lippa, as he himſelfe had ſeene: and alſo to the end that they ſhould ſhew them ſome ſigne that they had good  regard of them, and were alſo mindfull of them. The Frier at theſe ſpeeches was content to yeeld thereto, perſwading himſelfe, that they being ſo ſmall a number, they ſhould not bee able to diſturbe that which he had ſecretly plotted in his minde.
            
               
Whileſt the Artillerie was thus on the way, the Frier and Caſtalde began to giue directions for the affayres of Lippa, cauſing the dead bodies of the  Turks to be conuaied away, which were thickly ſpread in the towne ſtreetes, within the Ditches, and at the breaches, and ſpecially at the Caſtle, commanding that the walles ſhould bee repayred the beſt they could. And becauſe in this towne were many perſons, who willingly, or by compulſion of the Turkes, had taken armes for their defence againſt Ferdinands Campe, the Frier depriued them all of their goods, and beſtowed them in recompence vpon many his Captaines and ſouldiours. Among which was in like ſort beſtowed the goods of a certaine Marchant, who was ſlaine at the taking of Lippa, a man of good ſufficient wealth, and one who had a wife, who beſides  her beautie and youth, was alſo vertuous and of good reputation, as any was A vertuous wife. in that countrie. This woman ſeeing ſhe had loſt, by the ſacke and ſpoyle of the towne, her whole ſubſtance, and that nothing was left her, but her apparell which ſhe then did weare, and that alſo they had taken all her poſſeſſions from her, and that the Frier had diſtributed them betweene two of his Hungarian Captaines, who vnkindly had expulſed her out of her owne houſe; ſeeing her ſelfe very poore and beggerly, and not knowing what courſe to take, was counſelled to make her complaint to Caſtalde. Vpon this ſhe went, and being come to his Tent, and preſſing to goe in and ſpeake with him, was ſtayed and enquired by the Guard what her buſines was. She anſwered,  that ſhe would no other thing, but ſpeake with the Lieutenant generall. The Guard ſeeing her very faire and ſeemely both of face and bodie, thought that ſhe came for no other thing but to make ſhew of her beautie, and ſale of her honeſtie, and the rather, conſidering the ſeaſon which was ſomewhat late, and approaching towards night: whereupon they ſuffered her not to waite any longer, but let her preſently goe in: who approaching the preſence of Caſtalde, ſhe heauily explained the cauſe of her comming, humbly intreating that hee would not ſuffer that ſhee ſhould ſeeke her reliefe among charitable people: ſorrowfully telling him, that although her husband was found with an ill wil to be at the wall of Lippa againſt him,  he had alreadie payd dearely for it, euen the price of his life: and that therefore ſhe being a woman, and a Chriſtian, ſhe could not in any ſort be found culpable thereof, neither beare the offences of another, being of her ſelfe cleerely innocent of that fault: and that therefore it would pleaſe his Excellencie to haue reſpect vnto her condition and honour, and that he would not permit, that for the inriching of two, who had no neede of her goods, ſhe ſhould bee vtterly ſpoyled, and bee forced to paſſe the remnant of her mournefull daies in perpetuall miſerie, whereof he ſhould receiue but ſmall honour. She vttered theſe ſpeeches with ſo good a grace and ſeemely behauiour, well fitting the ſubiect of her diſcourſe, that ſhe manifeſted to be no  leſſe adorned with an inward vertue, then outwardly appeared in her countenance and bodie. Vpon which her pitifull complaint, Caſtalde cauſed preſently theſe two Captaines to bee called for, to whom giuing as much and more of that which belonged to Ferdinands part, in recompence of this womans goods, he commaunded them that inſtantly they ſhould reſtore al that

which they had of hers: which they willingly did, and one of the two, who  had offered her the greateſt wrong, within a while after tooke her to his wife, in reſpect of her ſingular beautie and vertue, which he ſaw that naturally ſhe was inriched with.
            In this time the Campe-maſter Aldene, required Caſtalde to beſtow the gouernment of Lippa vpon him, with ſuch conditions as he had in charge to Lippa committed to the cuſtodie of Aldene a Spaniſh Captain. beſtow it vpō any other: which was preſently granted him, &amp; left there, with his companie to gouerne it, &amp; he was commanded to fortifie it, and repayre the Caſtle, he recommending that place to him, as a thing of great importance to all the countrie, and eſpecially becauſe it was the only Bulwarke and Key of that kingdome, and therefore that for this cauſe he was to repayre it into ſuch ſtate, and as ſtrong as it was before, and that he ſhould giue order,  that the inhabitants who were fled from thence, ſhould returne thither againe, and that he ſhould haue a ſpeciall care to vſe all his neighbours friendly, vſing the like to thoſe about the Caſtle of Solimos, within which he was to place his Enſigne, vntill the Caſtle of Lippa was well repayred and fortified; and leauing him good prouiſion of victuals, yea ſuch as by it he might maintaine himſelfe for many moneths: Caſtalde on the other ſide to prouide for Themeſuar, ſent thither Don Iaſper Caſtelluio, with his companie of Spanyards, Iaſper Caſtelluio Gouernour of Themeſuar. raiſed of thoſe who at the aſſault of Lippa had loſt their Captaines, (as aboue is ſaid, whereof Ferdinand not long before had prouided him) and gaue him ſpeciall charge to fortifie this towne, and to take ſuch order  that it might not want any thing, that might bee neceſſarie for any occaſion.
            Hauing ſufficiently prouided for theſe two townes, he lodged his whole armie within the precinct of Varadin: and hauing well accommodated them, he cauſed the Spaniſh and Germane companies to march on the one ſide of the riuer Maroſſe, and on the other ſide (not to giue the Frier any ſuſpition) he went himſelfe alone with him, onely but with 25. Harquebuziers on horſebacke for his guard, cauſing to march on the other ſide 2000. horſe, and 500. Harquebuziers, and in this manner they began to diſlodge, they both (for the more aſſurance and leſſe diſtruſt) like good friends riding in  one Coach.
            Now the time approached wherein he thought to kill Frier George, and ſo Ferdinand importuneth the death of Frier George. much the rather, for that he was earneſtly ſolicited thereto by Ferdinand: who alſo at that time had ſent another meſſenger from Vienna, that he ſhould vſe expedition in this attempt, and bereaue him of life, and ſpecially becauſe he vnderſtood by Caſtaldes letters what he had done to and with Oliman. And to the end that the Frier ſhould not diſtruſt any thing vpon the comming of this new meſſenger, he told him that Ferdinand was very ioyfull for the taking of Lippa, and that he gaue him infinite thankes for the ſeruice  he had there done him, whereof he would neuer bee vngratefull to requite his loyaltie, hoping by effect to ſatisfie and recompence him ſo, that during his life he ſhould thinke himſelfe well ſatisfied.
            Whileſt by ſuch diſguiſed maskes he couered theſe his ſtratagems, Caſtalde 
               Binſe where George was ſlaine. in the end arriued with the Frier at Binſe, a Caſtle which was built by him

in reſpect of the pleaſant ſituation of the place. There Caſtalde obſerued, that the occaſion he waited for and ſo greatly deſired, was now come, in a manner  aſſuring himſelfe that it was alreadie performed. And although that many times he had an intent openly to maſſacre him in the plaine field as he trauailed through the kingdome, yet neuertheleſſe he thought it not conuenient, and that he might not put himſelfe nor his people inconſiderately vnder Fortunes pleaſure, he did defer this execution vntill the Frier was come to this Caſtle, which hee eſteemed the moſt fit and commodious place of any other to practiſe his death with the leaſt danger. After then that they were both lodged in this ſaid Caſtle, Caſtalde ſeeing the Spaniſh Infantrie arriued not ſo ſoone as he deſired, (without which he could effect nothing to  the purpoſe) and ſpecially ſeeing the ſhort time the Frier would there abide, who thought to depart from thence within two daies: writ with great expedition, by a truſtie meſſenger, to the Marqueſſe Sforce Palauicin, and to all the other Spaniſh Captaines, that in what place ſoeuer they were, they ſhould preſently diſlodge with their ſouldiours, and without ſtaying in any place, repayre to Binſe. If the diligence of the meſſenger was great, that of the Captains was nothing inferiour, marching as farre in one day, as they could hardly haue done in two. This day Caſtalde behaued himſelfe very pleaſantly, finely entertaining the Frier with ſoothing and familiar diſcourſes, who dreamed not of any thing but of his departure to go to a Diet, which he cauſed  to bee aſſembled at Waſrael, in which he was determined to treate and conferre with thoſe of the countrie, concerning the meanes which ſhould bee vſed to expulſe Caſtalde and all his armie (which were in Ferdinands pay) out of the kingdome, and euen to the end (as might bee vehemently ſuſpected) to defeate and cut them in peeces, imagining that thereby he ſhould bee able to make himſelfe abſolute Lord of all thoſe countries. The Frier was lodged in his Caſtle, as he was vſually accuſtomed, as often as he came thither, and in like ſort Caſtalde. And in the towne by the Caſtle was lodged the Friers guard. And as they were there accomodated, the Spanyards arriued the ſame night, whom the Frier commaunded ſhould be lodged in the  other towne, ſituated on the other ſide of the riuer, which runneth betweene theſe two townes, being not very broad nor deepe, but yet as cleere as Chriſtall, it is called Sebeſſe, and a little beneath it caſteth his ſtreames into Maroſſe. The riuer Sebeſſe. This riuer hath a bridge of wood, for the commoditie of the Caſtle, paſſing from one of the townes to the other. Theſe ſouldiours being thus lodged, Caſtalde required the Frier that he would appoint the place where the Germanes ſhould winter, which by no meanes he would reſolue vpon, not willing that any great companie of them ſhould lodge in one place, but diuided into houſes and villages, to wit, twentie in one place, fortie in another, and ſo conſequently according to the proportion and receit of the  place: to the end, that (as Caſtaldes Courtiers ſaid, and as afterward was vnderſtood by them) euery towne taking his armes, might eaſily at the prefixed time kill all the ſouldiours they found therein; which was not concealed from Caſtalde by ſome who were about the Frier. But with great diſcretion he bore all patiently, diſſembling in his countenance that which he had inwardly

purpoſed, he employed al his care (as being greatly deſirous thereof)  to effect that execution, which many a moneth before he had reſolued vpon, for the generall good of them all, might come to good end; knowing that if this exploite did well ſucceede, all his people might be well and commodiouſly lodged ſecure from any ſecret treaſons. Hauing then vpon this point reſolutely determined in his heart, he cauſed to come to him the Marqueſſe Sforce Palauicin, with whom he had expreſſe commaund from Ferdinand, to conferre about this deed, which he vntill then concealed from him, and reciting to him that which he was to doe, and ſhewing him the meanes that muſt be obſerued therein, he told him in his Maieſties name, that it was neceſſarie that he himſelf ſhould be an actor in a fact of ſo great importance,  and ſpecially the time being now come, in which they were not to goe back, neither was it to bee omitted; and fortune alſo had offered the occaſion, which of a long time he expected, the Frier being in the Caſtle (forth whereof he would by no meanes that he ſhould come a liue) and he told him, that although he ſaw this enterpriſe exceeding difficult, (the end whereof could not well be iudged of) yet neuertheleſſe ought he not for the ſeruice of Ferdinand to refuſe it, it being more then neceſſary, that ye night following without delay it ſhould bee effected. The Marqueſſe readily offered his owne perſon, and all his power, yea and with ſuch a deſire as could be expected in ſuch a perſon, not contradicting any thing which was ſaid to him; and anſwered Caſtalde, that he would appoint what he ſhould doe, and as for that  which concerned his owne action, he would not in any thing faile of performing his vttermoſt: whereupon taking ſpeciall care of this, he preſently departed, and went to prouide for that which was neceſſarie therefore. And then Caſtalde, vnder colour of aduiſing touching ye placing of his ſouldiours in ſome garriſons, went to ſee the Frier, whō he found readie to heare Maſſe, and ſuffering him to go quietly to his deuotions, ſtayed himſelfe in another roome by, to conferre with certaine there. There ſome of them that were preſent came &amp; told him, that the Prieſt being at the conſecratiō of the bleſſed Sacrament, forgetting to take the Hoſt, he tooke the Chalice and eleuated it, Preſages of George his death. which was a preſage of the Friers death, and of the blood which hee  ſhould ſhed on the ground. This ouerſight was well perceiued by euery one, but not by the Frier himſelfe, and none did diuine any thing thereby, but did rather attribute it to the negligence of the Prieſt, then as to a ſigne ſent from God. The Maſſe being ended, they withdrew themſelues to conferre together, and in the end not agreeing of places for garriſons, euery one withdrew himſelfe to his owne lodging: whereupon Caſtalde preſently ſent for Captaine Andrew Lopez, to whom he imparted, that this night of neceſſitie the Frier muſt be ſlaine, and that it was the Kings pleaſure it ſhould bee inſtantly performed; and that for the good regard that he had of his perſon,  he made ſpeciall choiſe of him, with Captaine Monin, Cheualier Campegge, 
               The actors of George his death. and the Marqueſſe Sforce, that with all expedition this exploite, ſans faute, ſhould be put in practiſe, for that in omitting it, beſides that the King ſhould wholly loſe both that kingdome and his reputation; all they themſelues alſo ſhould bee in daunger to bee ſlaine: and on the contrarie in executing it,

there could not poſſible betide of it, but ſingular good: and although that there might bee daunger by meanes thereof, to ſee ſome alteration among  the Tranſiluanians, yet he hoped to prouide therefore a prompt and fit remedie: aſſuring him further, that Ferdinand would gratefully accept thereof; and inſtructing him how he ſhould carrie himſelfe therein, he commaunded him that out of all the Spaniſh companies, he ſhould onely make choiſe of 24. Harquebuziers, the moſt reſolute amongſt them, and leſſe knowne of the Friers men, and that at the opening of the Caſtle gate, he ſhould finde the meanes, as wiſely as he could, to bring them in, and that being once entered, they ſhould ſeize on foure towers, diuiding ſixe to euery one, and that there they ſhould keepe themſelues quiet, vntill they were  commaunded to performe that which they ſhould doe. On the other ſide, he called for Captaine Peter d' Auila, and commanded him that foure houres before the baggage was readie to march, he ſhould goe to the Port of Saſſebeſſe, to gather without ſound of Drumme or any noyſe, the ſouldiours who were within, and that afterwards vpon day breake, they ſhould preſent themſelues before the Caſtle gate of Binſe, with their Colours diſplayed and ranged in battaile, and that there they ſhould attend the charge which ſhould be giuen them: which was preſently done.
            Now the night being come, which was very clowdie and darke, during which the element would demonſtrate ſome ſigne of the Friers death. For  in that night the windes were ſo horrible, and the tempeſt and raine ſo ſtrange, that in mans memorie the like was neuer ſeene. Nothing was heard but vnaccuſtomed ſounds in the ayre, clapping of doores and windowes through all the Caſtle, and that ſo terrifying, as though the world would preſently haue ended. In ſumme, as well in the ayre, as in ye vallies, this ſupernaturall tempeſt made ſuch rude hauock, as though all the Furies in hell had been there vnchained. The tempeſt being ceaſed, and day light appearing, which in reſpect of the diſtempered night paſt, ſeemed not very cleere, and that the Frier was then vpon his departure; that day the Aiduchs, who were of the guard of the Caſtle, opened the gate ſomewhat before the accuſtomed  time, to let his waggons go forth. At the very inſtant Captaine Andrew Lopez performed to the full of all that which was commanded him, cauſing very ſlily thoſe 24. Harquebuziers to enter in, ſo that as well for the comming forth of the waggons, as alſo for the deſire to diſlodge, not any tooke regard to them who entered in, they being all apparelled in Turkiſh habits in long and large gownes, which they had gotten at the taking of Lippa, and with theſe robes they couered their armes and harquebuzes. They being thus entered, Lopez diſpoſed of them in places conuenient where they ſhould keepe; and preſently after, he went from thence to the place where Castalde expected him, with the Marqueſſe Sforce, who was the chiefe actor in the enterpriſe, and certainly knew the determined order which he ſhould  obſerue therein, hauing with him foure Italian gentlemen: one of them was named Captaine Monin, the ſecond Cheualier Campeggio, the third Scaramuccia, and the fourth was called Piacentino, men of an approued reſolution, and of as great confidence: &amp; to be ſhort, ſuch were theſe men, as in a whole

world could not be found their like to effect ſuch an attempt. Beſides theſe,  there were yet foure other Spaniſh ſouldiours, which Lopez amongſt many had culled out to bee the moſt valiant. With theſe, the Marqueſſe Sforce about day breake went towards the Friers chamber vpon the 18. of December, and the Friers Secretarie who perceiuing the drift of this rumour, went to giue him notice thereof, but he was turned againe by theſe conſpirators. Before them all went Caſtaldes Secretarie, named Marc Antonie Ferraro of Alexandria, with certaine letters and fained patents in his hand, with intent to ſhew them to the Frier, and to requeſt him to peruſe the one, and ſeale the other, telling him that it was for the Marqueſſe Sforce, who that day ſhuld depart to go to Vienna, and who would not go without knowing  his pleaſure, whither hee would commaund him any thing to Ferdinands Court. This Secretarie was accuſtomed early and late to haue free acceſſe to the Frier vpon any affayres, yea, and euen at vntimely houres, and the Frier bore him good affection, and alwaies vſed him familiarly, affoording him great fauour and many rich gifts, and repoſed a ſpeciall truſt in him. For theſe reſpects he was ſent with them, that the more colourably and with leſſe ſuſpition, the groomes of the Friers chamber might open his doore, they knowing the good affection that their maſter bore him, and that the ſaid Secretarie not foure daies before, about the ſame houre was come to him to negotiate ſome important buſines. Caſtalde had expreſſely ſent him at ſuch  an houre before, to the end, that when time ſhould come to execute this enterpriſe, no ſuſpition ſhould grow by his comming, and that he might be the man who ſhould kill him.
            They being all thus arriued neere the Friers chamber, they preſently locked in the guard of the Aiduchs into a hall thereby, who little ſuſpected any ſuch matter, for that they were all cluſtering about the chimney to warme them, and to refreſh themſelues, by reaſon of that troubleſome night which they had endured. And after the Secretarie knocked at the doore, and being reported to the Frier who it was, he cauſed him preſently to come in; the Marqueſſe Sforce following him, whom the groome would not let enter in,  but told him that he ſhould attend him at the doore. The other thruſting his foote and knee betweene both, hindered that the groome could not ſhut it. The Marqueſſe keeping himſelfe firmely there, the Secretarie in the meane time approached Frier George, who was in his ſhirt and night-gowne, he vſing no other circumſtances to apparell him, but onely came preſently out of his bed, and leaning then on the table, vpon which he had a little Clocke, a Breuiarie, and a booke of his notes, with an Inkehorne by. The Secretarie told him, that the Marqueſſe Sforce was to goe to the Court of Ferdinand, and before his departure he was come to kiſſe his hands, and would know his pleaſure if he would commaund him any ſeruice: that being ſaid,  he put into his hands the letters and patents (aforeſaid) to ſeale them. After that the Frier had peruſed them, and taking penne and inke to ſubſcribe his name, the Secretarie not omitting any time, with a poynard (which ſecretly he had) he gaue him a ſtab betweene the throate and the breaſt, but not ſo deepe that it was mortall. The Frier being greatly amazed herewith, and

comming to himſelfe againe, and ſaying Virgo Maria, he pulled the dagger out of his breaſt, and for that he was a man of great ſtrength, and of a bolde  reſolution, he made the Secretarie retire to the end of the table. The Marqueſſe being very attentiue, hearing this bruite, entered preſently into the chamber, and laying hand vpon his ſword, gaue him ſo great a blow vpon the head, that he cleaued it. Whereupon all the reſt entering with Captaine Lopez, diſcharged their Harquebuzes vpon him, which the Frier ſeeing, ſaid no other thing but theſe words in Latin: What meaneth this my friends? The laſt words of George. and ſaying, Ieſus Maria, he fell dead to the ground.
            Behold now the end of the proudeſt and inſolenteſt man in the world, and the greateſt and cloſeſt Tyrant that euer liued, God permitting that he ſhould in that very place end his daies, which he had cauſed to be built vpon  the foundations of an ancient Church and Moneſtarie of religious perſons, which for that occaſion he cauſed to be defaced and pulled down, &amp; for the The death of George was foretold him. ruine whereof, his death was foretold vnto him by the Abbot of that place. And neither could his authoritie, wiſedome, nor great wealth protect him from the action of ſo miſerable an end, whereinto (his daies being almoſt come to a period) he ſuddenly fell. The bruite ranne, that this death inflicted on him, was rather by the enuie and malice of thoſe who hated him, then by any act which he was culpable in: for that the defence which he vndertooke for Olimans protection and ſafetie, tended to no other end (as was afterward perceiued, and as wee ſhall hereafter more at large treate of) but  that by ſuch curteſie vſed to Oliman and his people, he might pacifie the Turkes furie, and cauſe them to abſtaine from further oppreſſion of Tranſiluania, and ſuffer euery one to liue peaceably. This wee are ſure on, that all thoſe which were actors of his death, in time fell into great misfortunes. The Marqueſſe Sforce within a while after was ouerthrowne and taken priſoner by the Turkes, who inflicted great torments vpon him. Captaine Monin was Reuenge from God againſt the murtheres of George. beheaded at S. Germanes in Piemont. Marc Anthonie Ferraro in anno 1557. was alſo beheaded in Alexandria, by the Cardinall of Trent his commaund. Another was quartered by the Frenchmen in Prouence. Cheualier Campeggio in anno 1562. was in the preſence of the Emperour Ferdinand mortally  wounded with a Bore in Bohemia. And the concluſion was, that in the end Tranſiluania remained not long vnder the obeyſance of his Maieſtie, but returned vnder the gouernment of yong King Iohn: ſo that the death of Frier George was more offenſiue and preiudicial to the Chriſtians, then profitable, as we will hereafter in his due place mention.
            Returning then to the purſuite of our hiſtorie: whileſt theſe were buſied about their execution, Caſtalde was walking vpon the Caſtle wall to giue colour to their proceedings, and there to expect the iſſue of this bloodie enterpriſe. Being now aſſured that the Frier was dead, he preſently came downe  and went to the Caſtle gate, where ſuddenly with his ſouldiours which were entered into it, and other gentlemen which he had with him, he cauſed all the Aiduchs (who then were appointed for the guard of it) to goe foorth, who hearing the bruite which was within, and ſeeing the Spanyards in battaile without, and that the Frier their Lord was dead, they ſo ſuddenly were

amazed, that without betaking themſelues to armes, they moſt willingly  fled; and departing in this manner, aduertiſed the Friers guards, who were at the bridge on the other ſide of the Caſtle, of what had happened. This exploite being now finiſhed, Caſtalde doubting that many of the Friers friends would depart: whereupon he preſently went forth to finde Francis Chendy 
               Francis Chendy. 
               Ference, who was alreadie in his Coach to bee gone, and taking him by the hand, he deſired him to ſtay. And ſurely if hee had not then at that inſtant ſtaied him, he would haue fallen into a great daunger, for that he was one of the greateſt friends Frier George had, and hee was of that might within the Realme, as he could ſtirre them vp againſt the ſouldiours of Ferdinand, to be reuenged of the Friers death. Hee hauing thus ſtaied him, brought him to the place where the Spanyards and Germanes were, among whom  he placed him to ſee what would become of this tumult, that the gentlemen and ſeruants of the Friers would make, and ſpecially his guard, who mounted all on horſebacke, and gathered together in the field, hauing for their Captaine Paul Bancchy, who at the ſiege of Lippa was the Friers Lieutenant. Paul Bancchy. They being thus all ranged in battaile in a plaine, began among themſelues to deliberate what was beſt to bee done, and being acertained of the Friers death, made no other ſemblance againſt Caſtalde, doubting they could not make their partie good, in reſpect he had an infinit companie of men with him, and that this murther was not done without great intelligence: for  which cauſe, eſteeming they could not greatly preuaile, but rather receiue more loſſe and damage, they reſolued for the preſent to obſcure this reuenge in ſilence, and reſerue the chaſtiſement thereof, vntill a more conuenienter time. And ſo this aſſemblie was diſcomfited, euery man taking his neereſt and ſafeſt way, leauing their maſters dead bodie to bee a pray and ſpoyle, and vnburied. It remained there many daies aboue ground all naked and The buriall of George. without light, there being not any who reſpected to couer or burie him, being ſo ſtiffe with cold, that he ſeemed as a man made out of Marble, hauing in the head, breaſt, and armes many wounds, vpon which was yet remaining the blood all frozen: which to ſay truly, was an obiect worthie of compaſſion; and on the other ſide, it was very execrable and enormious, to ſee ſo  great a perſonage ſo vily left without buriall, by thoſe who (God knoweth for what cauſe) had practiſed his death. In the end, by ſome of his friends he was conuaied to the Church of Albe-iula, where Caſtalde, at the charges of Ferdinand, cauſed him to bee buried in a Tombe of ſtone, in the middeſt of the new great Church, by King Iohn Huniades Coruin. Theſe Aiduchs and other of the Friers people being thus retired, Caſtalde ſeeing that in theſe alterations of fortune, there would not befall vnto him any great diſturbance nor tumult for the death of the Frier, came on foote before the Spaniſh ſquadrons, hauing Francis Chendy by the hand, and began with him to ſet forward  to Saſſebeſſe. He was not yet farre on his way, but a meſſenger came and told him that the Caſtle of Binſe was rifled by thoſe who were left in cuſtodie thereof, and that the Friers Secretarie was taken by Iohn Alphonſe 
               The moueables of George ſcazed. 
               Caſtalde, and warranted from death, and how that in the Friers chamber there was found a little Cabenet, within which was 12000. Hungariſh Duckets,

which Captaine Andrew Lopez, with foure other ſouldiours, had taken and broken vp, and parted ſhares according to their qualities, reſeruing the  greateſt quantitie for himſelfe. He vnderſtanding this newes, preſently ſent Captaine Diego Velez to pacifie this diſorder, and take the money againe from them who had thus ſtollen it, and to cauſe them to reſtoreal the moueables of the Frier, and eſtabliſh them in the former eſtate, waiting till he ſhould ſend a Comiſſarie, who ſhould receiue all the Friers treaſure to the vſe of Ferdinand. By this meanes he cauſed the pillage to ceaſe, and recouered againe much money, and other things to the value of 80000. Duckets, which was all committed to the charge of his Maieſties Treaſurers. And marching thus along, very diſcontented with thoſe who had rifled the Friers  chamber, within ſhort time after hee arriued at Saſſebeſſe, from whence he preſently ſent to the Captaines and Gouernours of ſuch Caſtles and Forts, as were at the Friers deuotion, that they ſhould yeeld to Ferdinand, threatning them, that if they would not obey his commaund, he would preſently ſend his armie and Artillerie to ſubdue them. Among which places there was one called Wyuar, where the Frier had his treaſure, and there hee alſo Wyuar. priuately kept an Ambaſſadour of the Turkes, which Caſtalde, preſently after the Frier had yeelded vp the ghoſt, ſent Captaine Diego Velez to apprehend and bring the ſaid Ambaſſadour to him whereſoeuer he ſhould be, to ſee if any matter of moment could bee learned out of him touching the Friers  proceedings, and whether there had been any intelligence and practiſe betweene them againſt Ferdinand, as was vehemently ſuſpected, and ſpecially in reſpect of the Diet of Waſrael, where they looked for the Sicilians, and in which (as the common bruite and ſpeech amongſt our people was) they ſhould haue diſcourſed of the meanes which ſhould be vſed to expulſe Caſtalde out of Tranſiluania, with all the Spanyards, Germanes, Bohemians, and Hungars, who ſhould be at that time found in it, and were payd by Ferdinand. This Ambaſſadour being vnder Caſtaldes commaund, and diligently examined, they could neither know nor finde in him any matter as they deſired, but onely certaine letters of credit written in the Turkiſh language,  directed to Solyman, Roſtan Baſha, the Belerbey, and to certaine other of ſpeciall credit in the Turkes Court, and ſealed with the ſeale, which the Frier was wont to vſe in all the affayres concerning the kingdome, which letters he had diſpatched, without imparting any thing thereof to Caſtalde. He remained at Saſſebeſſe one whole day, that by the meanes of Iulian de Carleual, he might aduertiſe Ferdinand of all that which happened, and writ to all the townes to acquaint them with the enterpriſes and death of the Frier, and to pray them to remaine in a loyall deuotion to the King. The day following, fearing the Sicilians (being ſpeciall friends to the Frier) would riſe againſt him, and that it was not in his power to auoyde the tumult, which he alreadie  ſaw ſtirred vp, determined to goe to Sibinio, for that it was a towne of Sibinio. good ſtrength and moſt faithfull to Ferdinand, and leſſe affected to the Frier, among all thoſe which were in that quarter, in which he thought to temporiſe, while he might, together with his ſecuritie, ſee what end theſe matters would haue: whereupon he left good garriſons of Germanes in Albe-iula,

and at Saſſebeſſe, and he left alſo at Binſe Captaine Diego Velez with his Spaniſh  companie, and went himſelfe to Sibinio, where being arriued, he lodged the reſt of his armie without the towne: but ſo neere at hand, that vpon any neceſſitie and firſt ſigne giuen, within foure houres he could bring them into the towne, onely retaining with him 50. Harquebuziers for his guard. There he was very friendly receiued of the citizens, who greatly reioyced with him, for that he had deliuered them from the ſubiection and feare of this ſtearne and proud Frier, promiſing not to faile him in all proſperous and aduerſe accidents whatſoeuer, and offering him all that which ſhould be any way neceſſary for him. Caſtalde gaue them many kind thanks, and was exceedingly pleaſed, for that hee found the Sibinians in ſo good an humour, and  ſuch aſſured friends: and minding afterwards to depart from thence and go to Segheſuar, that ſo he might be more neere to Waſrael (where the Sicilians The Diet at Waſrael. were aſſembled, expecting the Friers arriuall) and alſo the better to vnderſtand and know of them what their purpoſe might be: and whether after they vnderſtood of the Friers death, they would continue in the friendſhip and deuotion of Ferdinand. The inhabitants of Sibinio would by no meanes permit him that he ſhould goe out of their towne without a good guard, telling him, that to goe to ſuch a Diet, it was very neceſſarie he ſhould leade with him more men then he had, and that by no meanes he ſhould repoſe any truſt in the Sicilians, vntill he ſaw how they would take the Friers death, vrgently perſwading him not to go to that Diet with leſſe then 15000.  men. Vpon theſe conſiderations, Caſtalde ſent to ſeeke the men of armes of Charles Scerettin, and certaine Spanyards and Germanes to the number of 1800. and went from thence with this troupe to Segheſuar, ſtill hauing in Segheſuar. his companie Francis Chendy, whom he now had wonne, and by offers and kind vſage (although it might bee thought it was more by compulſion then loue) had drawne to the ſeruice of Ferdinand. They being arriued in this towne, they repoſed themſelues there the firſt day: and the day following Caſtalde ſent Chendy to Waſrael, where alreadie were met the principall men The Sicilians mutinie for the death of George, and are appeaſed by Chendy. of Seculia, deuiſing together of the meanes which ſhould be vſed to reuenge the death of the Frier. Chendy being now preſent, before them all, in Caſtaldes 
                name, ſaid vnto them, that they ſhould louingly and faithfully embrace Ferdinand, of whom they ſhould receiue more pay, rewards, and curteſies in one houre, then they had receiued of the Frier in 20. yeeres, whoſe death fell vpon him in regard of his bad demeanour, hauing abſolutely determined to bring the Turkes into theſe countries, and to make himſelfe ſole Lord of Tranſiluania: which would haue been not onely their particular ruine, but alſo an irreparable damage to all Chriſtendome. With theſe friendlie ſpeeches, and other plauſible reaſons which he alleadged to them, he wonne that abilitie ouer them, that he conuerted them from their former malice, to ſweare all obeyſance to his Maieſtie, and to offer him to be faithfull and readie  hereafter in all his affayres, performing whatſoeuer Caſtalde ſhould commaund them. The principals among them within a while after came together to viſit Caſtalde at Segheſuar, to manifeſt vnto him in his preſence the aſſurance of that true fidelitie, which in words they had by Chendy promiſed

vnto him. Caſtalde receiued them with infinit ioyes and demonſtrations of kindnes, promiſing large penſions to thoſe who were at the Friers pay, and  giuing honourable titles and liuings to others: and beſides, at Ferdinands charges, he beſtowed as well vpon the poore as rich many preſents; to ſome, horſes, robes of ſilke, apparell of cloath; to others, money, entertaining euery man with good loue and curteous words: and aſſuring them with great and ample hopes of a future and preſent acknowledgement of their ſubiection, hee made them in a manner ſo fauourable vnto him, that hee verely thought he might well truſt them, and aſſiſt himſelfe with them, in any enterpriſe whatſoeuer. Obſeruing herein the cuſtome of the ancient Romanes, who by meanes of curteſie and liberalitie, made all ſorts of men, how proud  or inſolent ſoeuer they were, to be tractable and louing friends, and by force of armes and feare, to become ſubiect and obedient.
            The Sicilians being exceeding well ſatisfied by theſe ſpeeches, ſhewed themſelues ſo well contented with this new friendſhip, that it was an incredible thing &amp; hardly to be beleeued, conſidering how within ſo ſhort a time this barbarous and rude nation was wonne, and who (in all iudgement) was to bee greatly miſtruſted. By ſuch managings men may eaſily ſee how forcibly the induſtrie and gouernment of men are; and how greatly the prudence of Francis Chendy ſerued to reduce thoſe, who for our deſtruction were purpoſely vnited together, and who alſo had ſworne to deſtroy all Ferdinands 
                people, and to driue Caſtalde out of thoſe regions: and alſo how great and excellent his foreſight was, in ſo wiſely tempering that people, that from that time forward they alwaies ſhewed themſelues to be Ferdinands ſpeciall friends. After then that theſe nations were thus appeaſed, Caſtalde began to diuide all the companies into commodious places of the kingdome, to the end that his ſouldiours, by the benefit of their ſafegards, might in part begin to reſtore themſelues from their trauailes, which they had endured: and that after they were refreſhed, they might prepare and finde themſelues better diſpoſed to the future warre, which alreadie was diſcerned to come from the Turkes. And although that all tumults ſeemed then to be pacified  and extinct, yet neuertheleſſe there wanted not ſome, who ſecretly kindled the fire in many places, and practiſing with inward hatred many things, (according as time fitteth we ſhall write of) brought great detriment to Ferdinands affayres, and great paines and hatred as well to his people, as to the particular quarters of that kingdome.

               IN the beginning of this yeere 1552. Ferdinand and his Lieutenants thought by the death of Frier George, to haue procured to Hungarie and Tranſiluania a long repoſe and perpetuall peace, ſeeing that ſome of thoſe who were vehemently ſuſpected, did not any thing oppoſe themſelues, nor made any ſhew of inſurrections: inſomuch that they imagined that Fortune by that meanes had brought to euery one a happie life,  and ſweete tranquilitie: euery man applauding the preſent time, and extreamely blaming the time paſt, not any manner of way conſidering that which might happen. Thus continuing in this their hope of a better life, it was not long, but that Fortune (according to her naturall inclination) gathered

together ſo much poyſon, and ſpread abroad ſo many perturbations, that ſhe gaue vniuerſall notice, of how many miſchiefes ſhe had been the  cauſe. Then, after the diſcontent of the Sicilians was appeaſed, and that euery one was departed from the Diet of Waſrael, Caſtalde returned to Sibinio, when all the Caſtles and Fortreſſes (which in the Friers name for a time held out) they ſent to him in the name of Ferdinand, and offered vnto him all obeyſance, All the places of George acknowledge Ferdinand. and yeelded vp all the treaſure which was found therein, that in any ſort appertained to Frier George. In the end hauing accepted their offers, and reeſtabliſhed the ſame Captaines in the ſaid places, he preſently certified Ferdinand thereof, to the end that with all expedition, he ſhould diſpatch certaine Comiſſaries, to receiue by account, all that which was found  in thoſe places to haue been the Friers, and afterward to diſpoſe of them as it pleaſed him.
            Whileſt hee expected theſe Comiſſaries, and that hee was at Sibinio, certaine newes came daily by Marchants of Tergoniſta, (a principall towne of Tergoniſta. the Tranſalpinians) concerning that which was done at Conſtantinople, and touching the great preparation that the Turke made, (being exceeding The Turke prepareth to make warre vpon Ferdinand. angrie and enraged for the death of the Frier) and cauſed to bee leauied two great armies to ſend them againſt the Tranſiluanians, with which he determined at one inſtant to aſſaile this Prouince on two ſides, on the one ſide by the Moldauian, and on the other by the low Mariſhes.
            Vpon this newes, Caſtalde both by letters and meſſengers vrgently preſſed  
               Ferdinand for preſent reliefe, and that he would in time prouide himſelfe Caſtalde ſoliciteth for ſuccours. of ſufficient men, and other fit neceſſaries, which ſhould bee needfull for the warre, and that he ſhould draw from the Emperour Charles as many Spanyards as he could. He alſo ſent to his Maieſtie the Marqueſſe Sforce, to the end he ſhould acquaint him with all the particulars, and that it would pleaſe his Maieſtie to giue him meanes to leauie ſome force of Italians, and that with ſuch expedition, as he might bee able, before neede ſhould require, to returne into Tranſiluania: and ſpecially to tell him, that he ſhould ſend good ſtore of great Artillerie; for the conduct of which, there ſhould not be vſed ſuch detracting of time, as was in ſending the other, to the end that by ſuch  ſuccour and preparations, they might be able to reſiſt ſo puiſſant an enemie, who aſſuredly would make no ſhew of any ſloth or negligence, to prepare for the ruine of this countrie and poore miſerable people.
            The Marqueſſe being now arriued at Vienna, he preſently acquainted Ferdinand with all the occurrants of Tranſiluania, as alſo of that which was committed to his charge. His Maieſtie being attentiue thereunto, and duly conſidering of theſe vnwelcomed nouelties, preſently diſpatched him into Italie, to leauie 4000. Italians, and to bring with him as many Spanyards as he could: and afterward writ to Caſtalde, that he would not faile to ſend him  ſuch ayde as he demaunded againſt that time he required, hoping to ſend him no leſſe then 50000. men: namely, 5000. men of armes of Bohemia, 20000. Hungariſh horſe, 20000. Launſquenets, and more then 5000. Spanyards and Italians, which ſhould make vp the ſaid number and more, of which he ſhould alſo compoſe a good ſtrong armie vpon Tibiſcus, for the defence

of the paſſages, and of all thoſe places, and that all theſe people ſhould bee  payed for foure moneths: the which if Ferdinand had done, Hungarie for that time might haue been in good eſtate. But this good intended preparation could not ſort to effect, in reſpect of the aduerſe accidents that happened, and particularly that Duke Mauris brought to Germanie, by occaſion whereof he was conſtrained to bee carefull ouer the affayres of his brother Charles the 5. which were in ſome hard tearmes, and to lend his aduice to appeaſe that diſcord, happened for the not deliuering of the Lantgraue, and the Duke of Saxonie, being greatly buſied on all ſides by ſuch vnlooked for broyles, which brought ſo great diſcommoditie to him, that he could neither ſend money, nor men ſufficient for ſuch an enterpriſe: which default  was partly the cauſe of the vnfortunate ſucceſſe which happened this yeere in Tranſiluania, farre different from the former.
            In the meane while, Caſtalde with the greateſt expedition he could, cauſed the fortifications of Themeſuar, Lippa, Coloſuar, Sibinio, and many other places to be reered, and he omitted no time, but ſtill carefully imployed his beſt endeuour to that which concerned him. During which imployments The treaſure of George committed into the cuſtodie of the Comiſſaries. about ſuch munitions, the Comiſſaries arriued, which Ferdinand at his inſtance had diſpatched to receiue the Friers treaſure, which after his death was committed to ſafe keeping for his Maieſties vſe; Caſtalde not willing to defile his hands therewith (although the bruite was that he had the tenth  part of the goods) knowing that ſuch affayres were daungerous, and apt to giue occaſion to ſlanderous tongues to accuſe and detract euery man, yea although he ſhould carrie himſelfe therein a thouſand times more ſincerely then Iacob himſelfe, and ſpecially when any colourable occaſion doth prouoke them to it: in regard whereof, and to auoyde all ſuſpition, he altogether abſtained, and by no meanes would haue them in his owne cuſtodie.
            His Comiſſaries being come, he cauſed them to receiue it by Inuentorie, opening with his owne hands certaine places which were yet faſtened, as the Frier had left them, which vntill then were not opened, and which for the greater ſuretie he cauſed to be nailed vp and ſecurely preſerued. There  was found amongſt them in wedges and ingots ſo much gold, as amounted to 1744. markes, and of ſiluer 4793. markes; 1000. ancient Meddals of Lyſimachus, euery Meddall valued at three or foure Duckets; twentie ſtones or peeces of gold which were found in the riuers of Tranſiluania, which were valued to be more worth, then if they had bin altogether gold, and weighed 34. markes; 934. markes of ſiluer wedges of the myne; ſixe very great veſſels of ſiluer and guilt; certaine chaines of gold which in all weighed ſixe markes and a halfe; 32. cups of ſiluer guilt ouer after the Hungariſh faſhion, wrought with faire and curious works; 60. gold rings, ſet with many precious ſtones; a faire coller of gold made in manner of a Croſſe, inriched with faire Rubies  and Diamonds; 36. great ſiluer cups double guilt, ſo that one of them made two; twelue guilt Baſons and Eures, great, and of a large receit; an infinit companie of ſiluer drinking cups, great and ſmall diſhes, bowles, ſpoones, trencher-plates parcel guilt, and ſome not guilt; 1534. of Hungariſh Duckets; many bundles of Martine ſable skins, there being in euery bundle 80. or 100.

skinnes: many other bundles of diuers skinnes of great value; certaine Saphirs and other Iewels inchaſed in gold; diuers ornaments of cloath of gold  and ſilke, and other goodly moueables for houſehold, as clothes, Tapiſterie, and Arras of incredible eſtimation. He alſo had a race of 300. Horſes and Mares, and in his ſtables were found good ſtore of Turkiſh Horſes and others, and of Mules, which afterward were all giuen by Ferdinand to his ſonne Maximilian King of Bohemia, and in his name deliuered into the cuſtodie of Andrew Battor: and beſides all theſe, there was found great ſtore of victuals and munition, ſo that all things together (not counting that which was purloyned at Binſe, at Varadin, at Wyuar, at Deua, and at other places by the Captaines, which was eſteemed to bee worth more then 50000.  crownes) was valued at 250000. crownes.
            Whileſt theſe things were thus deliuered by Inuentorie, Queene Izabella writ to Ferdinand, that it would pleaſe him to commaund Caſtalde, that hee Izabella demaunded of Ferdinand the moueables of George, and alſo requeſted the accompliſhment of that which he had promiſed her. ſhould reſtore to her all the gold and ſiluer which was King Iohns her huſbands, that was found amongſt the Friers treaſure, which he had purloyned and vſurped by force, and in like ſort a portion of the Mares, and that hee would cauſe them preſently to be deliuered her. And further, that he would obſerue and performe all that which was promiſed to her, vpon the yeelding vp the kingdome of Tranſiluania. Ferdinand anſwered her, that for his part there ſhould be no fault: whereupon he commanded Caſtalde, that  he ſhould reſtore whatſoeuer might be found to belong to her, which was preſently performed, and there was giuen to her of the breede and other things the halfe. Ferdinand alſo commaunded the Comiſſaries that they Caſtalde and the murtherers of George, recompenced with Georges moueables. ſhould giue to Caſtalde 200. markes (to the end he ſhould haue part of the ſpoyle of Frier George) in ſuch veſſels of the guilt plate, the beſt wrought that he would chuſe, and eight guilded cups of the Hungariſh faſhion, and certaine great diſhes of thoſe which were found at Varadin, foure bundles of Martins skinnes, and other moueables: and beſides, 400. golden Meddals of Lyſimachus, whereof he was alreadie poſſeſſed, beſides the 1000. which were in the hands of the Comiſſaries. He alſo cauſed to bee giuen to the  murtherers of the Frier, ſo good a portion of his moueables and ſiluer, that with it and the reuenew which he gaue them during their liues, they held themſelues well contented and ſatisfied. The bruite went that the Frier had infinit treaſure, but in the end it proued not ſo much as was reported, yea and it neuer amounted to the third part of that which was eſteemed, and the iſſue proued, that the report exceeded the ſubſtance, and the fame thereof was much more then the effect it ſelfe. The Comiſſaries being diſpatched, returned well contented, hauing in their cuſtodie all theſe riches, and a good part of the money which was found at Binſe in the Friers chamber, which were recouered by good diligence that ſome vſed therein, there being (by  occaſion thereof) apprehended Captaine Andrew Lopez, Guydo Gozio, Maſter of Caſtaldes houſe, and certaine other ſouldiours, who afterward were conſtrained to reſtore all that which they had taken, and to ſubmit themſelues vnder Ferdinands mercie, who meant not, according to the ſeueritie of iuſtice, to chaſtiſe them, but with ſweete and milde clemencie did pardon

them. Now for that the ſouldiours were to be payed a twelue moneths pay  for their content, they cauſed to be coyned all that golde and ſiluer which was found in wedges, and by that meanes they were payed the greateſt part of their due, and they retained their affections vnder the oath of all fidelitie, which for want of payment were daily readie to mutinie and depart. As this payment was made, newes was brought that our forces had taken Zegedin, Zegedin ſurpriſed from the Turkes. which is a towne of Hungarie, not far from Lippa, containing about it 1000. houſeholds, and is furniſhed with a ſtrong Caſtle built vpon the ſhoare of Tibiſcus, neere the place where it entereth into Danubius. This towne is rich and of great traficke, and much frequented by occaſion of theſe two riuers: the maner in taking of it, was thus. 
            
            At the time that Castalde was incamped before Lippa, there came then to ſpeake with him, in the preſence of Andrew Battor, a Hungarian, named Ottomiall, (who at that time was Burgomaſter of Debrecen, a towne in Hungarie, Ottomiall. hauing been alſo Burgomaſter of Zegedin, before the Turkes were maſters thereof) and he tolde him, that if he would vouchſafe him his conſent and ayde, he would finde the meanes to ſurpriſe Zegedin, the Chriſtian inhabitants being at his diſpoſe, who alſo had conference with him about it: and beſides had at his deuotion the neighbouring places, who deſiring nothing but to vnwinde themſelues from the Turkes ſlauerie, would at no hand faile him in his enterpriſe: he hauing alreadie receiued letters from them, by which they gaue him to vnderſtand, that if he had the courage to  put in practiſe this exployte, he ſhould not doubt, but that approaching to them with a good troupe of men, they would put the towne and Caſtle vnder his commaund. Castalde well conſidering hereof, and knowing of what great ſtrength this place was, ſuppoſed this motion to be but a mockerie: neuertheleſſe, not minding to repell him, but with good and friendly ſpeeches, ſeeming to imbrace his aduice and councell, gaue him many heartie and intire thankes for his good affection in the attempting of ſo waightie an enterpriſe, and intreated him to continue the attempt of this practiſe, well hoping after the iſſue of Lippa, to furniſh and prouide him of all whatſoeuer he demaunded, and that then he ſhould not want of what ſuccours he  would himſelfe: and with this anſwere they departed.
            After that Lippa was taken, Ottomiall returned againe to Castalde, to demaunde of him that which to fore he had put him in minde of. Castalde ſeeing he perſeuered in this reſolute opinion, and with ſo ſincere affection, in offering his dutifull ſeruice to Ferdinand, as before he had made ſufficient proofe thereof, and that he ceaſed not both by words and deedes, to ſhew himſelfe very forward in all things, (although that at the firſt ſight, he was not ſo entertained as he perſwaded himſelfe he ſhould haue been) he tolde him, that he ſhould haue as many men with him, as ſhould be neceſſarie to  performe this exploite, aduiſing him, that if in caſe he got the towne, and that notwithſtanding he could not get the Caſtle, that by no meanes he ſhould loſe any time for the batterie thereof, but hauing ſackt the towne, he ſhould ſet fire thereon, and afterward retire with the bootie, to the place where he ſhould be, for feare of being charged by the Turkes, and that together

with his life, and the liues of his ſouldiours, he ſhould not loſe that which painfully he had gotten, eſteeming the ſurpriſe, and the worthie managing  of this enterpriſe of no ſmall importance. Ottomiall obtaining this ſuite, and hauing taken his leaue, aſſembled the ſouldiours which was appointed him at Lippa, to the number of 2000. foote, and 500. horſe, and concealing from them the cauſe which led him thereto, offered to euery footeman foure crownes the moneth, and to euery horſeman ſixe: and hauing thus payd them, he cauſed their rende vous in a place commodious not farre from Lippa.
            The Campe-maſter Aldene, who (as is aforeſaid) was remaining for the defence and gouernment of Lippa, vnderſtanding of this aſſemblie, and not  knowing the cauſe, gaue preſent aduertiſement thereof to Caſtalde, who returned him anſwer, that he ſhould not diſturbe him, nor enquire any further of the occaſion, ſince what he did, was for the ſeruice of Ferdinand. Vpon the receit of this anſwer, Aldene went preſently to Ottomiall, of whom vnderſtanding the particularitie of the enterpriſe, perſwaded ſo much with him, that if it ſhould fortunately ſucceede, he would giue him preſent notice thereof, to the end that he himſelfe might come in perſon to relieue him. Ottomiall hauing ſet them all forward, and the one halfe of Zegedin being at his diſpoſe, gaue ſecret notice to the inhabitants of the ſaid towne, that hee had well commenced and proceeded in this attempt, and that they ſhould at  any conuenient time ſend him word, when they would haue him to come vnto them. The townes-men preſently preſcribed a determined day to effect this practiſe. The time approaching, one day before he cauſed his people to march the whole night, and the day following he held them ambuſhed within a wood, and within two nights hee arriued ſo ſecretly, that his comming was neuer diſcerned: and comming before Zegedin at the prefixed houre, about day breake, he of one ſide diſpoſed the greateſt part of his people in ambuſcado in the next by woods, and by another way he ſent certaine ſouldiours to giue an alarme to the towne. Which being vnderſtood by the Turkes, preſently many of them ſallied forth of the Caſtle and towne  to view the occaſion of this alarme: and ſeeing ſo ſmall a number of theſe ſouldiours, and being ignorant of the ambuſcado, they boldly went forth againſt them; which when the other ſeeing, faining fearfully to retire, yet ſtill fighting, vntill by little and little they trained them within the compaſſe of their ambuſcado, where preſently they were ſo enuironed, and on euery ſide beaten downe, that they had no meanes to defend themſelues; and deſirous to make a retraict to the towne, euery one made haſte who ſhould bee there firſt. But the inhabitants well vnderſtanding this ſtratagem, hauing alreadie taken armes, they ſhut the ports againſt them, and ioyning with Ottomials men, they made ſuch a ſlaughter amongſt them, that of all thoſe who were  gone forth, there remained not one aliue. The Turkes who were remaining for the guard and defence of the Caſtle, ſeeing this ſlaughter, retired themſelues and ſtood vpon their guard, and drew vp the bridge, aſſuring themſelues within it, giuing diligent order the beſt they could to preſent neceſſitie. Our people being entered into the towne, and not being able to take

the Caſtle in this manner, determined to ſacke all the Turks houſes, and ſpecially  of the Marchants, who were very rich, there being come thither many Conſtantinopolitans to dwell there. Thus ſeazing vpon all their moueables, wiues, and children, and committing them into a great houſe, that afterwards they might ſhare them amongſt the ſouldiours, Ottomiall made himſelfe maſter of Zegedin, who afterwards being deſirous to aſſaile the Caſtle, found that the Turkes within would brauely defend themſelues. For the place of it ſelfe was naturally very ſtrong, and beſides, well furniſhed with Artillerie, and it was in ſuch ſort defenſible, that it cauſed Ottomiall to come ſhort of his conquering purpoſe. Therefore ſeeing he could by no meanes winne it without other forces, he writ preſently to the Camp-maſter Aldene 
                of all that he had done. He receiuing this newes, without expecting other Aldene relieueth Ottomiall. commaund from Caſtalde, calling to minde the promiſe which he made to Ottomiall to relieue him, determined with at ſpeede to goe to him, and taking two hundred Spanyards out of Lippa and Themeſuar, and foure field peeces, he began with all expedition to march towards Zegedin, perſwading himſelfe that with this ſupplie of men and Artillerie which he brought with him, hee might vpon reaſonable tearmes get the poſſeſſion of this Caſtle.
            Whileſt he iournied on, he acertained Caſtalde of this good newes, and how he marched thither, and deſired him that he would not faile to ſend after him with all ſpeede men and Artillerie, for that Ottomiall might not be  left deſtitute, and to the hazard of fortune, ſeeing he was now maſter of the towne, and aſſured him, by the meanes of ſuccours which he demaunded, eaſily to get the Caſtle. Before this aduertiſement from Aldene, Caſtalde had alreadie receiued newes thereof, by thoſe which he ſent with Ottomiall, that they ſhould preſently aduertiſe him of all the occurrants that ſhould happen, hauing in the meane time prepared a good number of men, and of all other neceſſaries which ſhould bee fitting, if in caſe the Caſtle were taken, that then he would preſently ſend ayde. But vnderſtanding that it was yet in the Turkes commaund, and that but onely the towne was taken, which he thought vnpoſſible to keepe without the Fortreſſe; ſent to Ottomiall that he  ſhould fire the towne, contenting himſelfe with that which he had alreadie done, and ſparing thoſe who were friends, he ſhould preſently retire with the bootie which he had gotten, reputing it a great vanitie to loſe his time in an opiniatiue iudgement for the conqueſt of impoſſibilities (and ſpecially not being able to ſurpriſe it ſuddenly) which would require a greater armie then that which he had, not being able to furniſh, together with foote and horſe, more then 4000. men, neither he hauing any peeces of batterie to ſend him: and in the end he commaunded him that he ſhould deferre no longer time in that place, for that if he did not ſpeedily diſlodge, he had  ſome doubt that the Turkes (by the ſuccours which they prepared) would come in the meane while to charge them, they not thinking thereon, and ſo by that meanes to loſe at one time both that which they gotten with their honour and liues.
            As he had diſpatched this commaund, came Aldenes Courier, by whom

he vnderſtood that he was departed from Lippa, with ſuch a number of men and Artillerie, as wee haue ſaid, to relieue Ottomiall. By this Courier he inſtantly  intreated that he would ſend him more men and Artillerie, aſſuring him that the taking of this Caſtle was very eaſie. But Caſtalde by no meanes could be induced to credit it, hauing been ſufficiently informed of the qualitie and ſituation of this ſaid Fortreſſe, and that within there were yet 500. Turkes remaining of thoſe who were ſlaine at the ſurpriſe of the towne; that it was well furniſhed with good ſtore of Artillerie, and that the walles were very large and thick, and rampierd behinde with as much earth as they were high, inſomuch that hee ſaw no poſſible meanes that the purſuite thereof could reſt victorious to our people. And although he apparantly knew that  to ſend men thither was much time loſt, eſteeming it vnpoſſible to take the Caſtle in this manner, yet he determined at all aduentures to ſend them ayde and Artillerie, as Aldene requeſted. Which he was the rather content to performe (although he-eſteemed it a friuolous thing) for that the fault ſhould not bee imputed to him if they did not take it, and that they ſhould not ſay that this fauourable occaſion was loſt, for not ſending them in time ſuch ayd as they demaunded. And thus in the greateſt ſpeede that could be (although it was ſtill contrarie to his liking) he writ to Thomas Varcocce, that hee ſhould preſently take two Cannons out of Varadin where he was, and two out of Albe-iula, with certaine field peeces, and with all ſpeed ſend them with their  munitions and other neceſſaries to Aldene, who was at Zegedin: which preſently was commodiouſly ſent, by meanes of the riuer Maroſſe. And afterwards commaunded Oureſtolph (who then was in garriſon in the Countie of Varadin) that he ſhould preſently march with the men of armes to ſuccour Ottomiall and Aldene. In like ſort he ſent to Peter Vicchy (who was Colonell of the Infantrie, and who alſo at that time had his garriſon at Varadin and Albe-iula) that he ſhould march with Oureſtolph. At this commaund, the one hauing with him 2000. foot and horſe, and the other 200. men of armes, they proceeded on towards Zegedin, without permitting their troupes to repoſe themſelues any time. 
            
            After that Caſtalde had giuen directions, according as aforeſaid, he alſo An offence to disfurniſh a garriſon. writ to Aldene, reprouing him for the fault which he had committed by leauing Lippa and Themeſuar, becauſe he had withdrawne from thence the garriſons, greatly marueiling at his folly, how he ſhould be drawne to ſettle himſelfe vpon ſo vaine an enterpriſe, which by all likelihoods could not fortunately ſucceede; and to thinke that with ſo few men hee could take that Caſtle, which in reſpect of the ſituation and ſtrength thereof, would require ſixe times as great a power: that hee had ſent them thoſe ſuccours that hee demaunded, which he would not haue done, but onely to the end that none ſhould accuſe him, that becauſe he had not ſent them, this Fortreſſe could  not bee wonne, further aſſuring himſelfe that time would witnes his iudgement true, and make the detriment to appeare, which was very probable would happen thereupon: and this he was ſo much the rather perſwaded of, for that then he ſaw himſelfe to bee in want both of men and money, ſo that in loſing thoſe which he had now ſent him, he ſhould finde himſelfe out of

hope, vpon any occaſion to reunite ſo many againe. This done, he departed  from Sibinio, and went and ſeated himſelfe in Albe-iula, that ſo he might be more neere vnto Zegedin, and in the middeſt of the kingdome, to the end that hee might the better prouide for all places; and if happely the affayres ſucceeded well, that hee might preſently tranſport himſelfe thither, and giue both by his preſence and by the ayde of the reſt of his ſouldiours (which he had lodged about Albe-iula) vigour and courage to the enterpriſe. But hereof there was not any neede at all: for within a few daies after newes was brought, that all thoſe who were at the expedition of Zegedin, were quite ouerthrowne by the Baſha of Buda, without knowing the particular trueth how things had paſſed. Caſtalde although the diſpleaſure which  he conceiued of this defeate was exceeding great, yet did he not entertaine this report as any noueltie, for that from the beginning euen to the end hee well foreſaw what would happen, and the rather being induced thereunto, in reſpect of the abſurditie which was committed from the firſt, which was not likely to effect any other end then ſuch as it had. Now after that, beſides he had more aſſured newes, that for certaine all his people were defeated and loſt: for feare leaſt the loſſe of Lippa and Themeſuar might not follow, (which Aldene had left both disfurniſhed of ſouldiours and of a Commaunder) he ſent in poſt to Captaine Roderic Vigliandrando, commaunding him that he ſhould goe to Lippa, and that he would ſend him ſo many men  as was needfull for the defence thereof. He alſo commanded Diego Velez de Mendoza, that he ſhould go to Themeſuar with his companie, leading with him beſides 300. Germanes, and 300. Hungariſh horſe, and of that troupe he ſhould ſend a good part thereof to Lippa, and that he ſhould be very vigilant vpon all that quarter.
            Theſe now marching on with tedious iourneys, met many people of diuers nations, who fled from about the townes of the low marches, for the feare which they had of the crueltie, which (as they vnderſtood) the Baſha of Buda had vſed in maſſacring an infinit companie of people: vpon which bruite they retired in great confuſion and tumult towards the mountaines.  But they ſeeing there were ſuccours ſent to the quarters from whence they were fled, ſtaied their fearefull courſe, and by little and little regained their courages againe; and being perſwaded by theſe Captains to expell all feare, and to returne againe to their houſes, they ceaſed their ſlight, and taking hart returned with them, and others went to Lippa and Themeſuar: where being The defeate of Ferdinands people at Zegedin by the Turkes. all arriued, they vnderſtood how Aldene ſaued himſelfe, with all the Spanyards and Oureſtolphs men of armes, with a true relation of all the diſaſter which happened in this ſort:
            It was now alreadie eight daies that Aldene had been about the Caſtle of Zegedin, and had enuironed it with a large trench, (expecting the arriuall of  the Artillerie, which approached with all ſpeede) when a day before, Peter Vicchy arriued with thoſe 2000. ſouldiours (as is aforeſaid) and when alſo arriued from Canoth 100. Germane Harquebuziers, 30. Spanyards, and 100. horſe. The tenth day Aldene early in the morning cauſed all his people to be muſtered in a field, and he found his number to be 3000. horſe, 230. Spanyards,

100. Germanes, and 2000. Hungarian footmen, beſides the 200. men of armes of Oureſtolphs, who at the ſame time arriued. Whileſt that Aldene was  buſied to diſpoſe and lodge them, and before they were ſeated, the Turks appeared in a plaine by Zegedin, at the ſight of whom the alarme was preſently giuen in euery place, and our men ſarried cloſe vp together. They ſent foorth ſome to take a view and notice of them, who diſcouered a ſquadron of 1500. horſe, and many Coaches, within which they might alſo diſcerne men, and it was the Baſha of Buda, who purpoſely came with ſuccours to attempt the enterance into the Caſtle, and not to fight with our people, being not ſufficiently accompanied for ſuch a purpoſe: but he thinking he was alreadie diſcouered, made a ſtand in that place where our people  might well perceiue them, and of his whole troupe he made two ſquadrons, the one greater then the other, cauſing all the Ianiſaries to mount vp into the Coaches, with which vpon the left hand he made a defence, among whom and with the greateſt ſquadron he placed himſelfe, and the leſſer he ſet on the right hand, cauſing thoſe Coaches and Waggons to couer and defend both the one and the other in manner of a Rampier: and being come but onely to relieue and ſuccour his people, and not to fight with our men, he ſtaied there to ſee what we would doe. Our men ſeeing the Turkes thus ranged in battaile, made a ſquadron of their Hungarian light horſe, and Oureſtolph made another with his men of armes, right oppoſite to that of the Baſha. Ottomiall and Aldene made another ſtrong bodie of all the Infantrie,  which they placed by the towne, without giuing them charge to fight, or any other directions what to doe.  As theſe ſquadrons of Caualarie were before the enemies, and a good diſtance betweene them, Peter Vicchy ſaid to Aldene: 
               What ſhall we now doe? Aldene anſwered him, that in reſpect hee knew not the manner of the Hungars fight, he would commit all to him, to doe what hee thought fitting. Afterwards Peter Vicchy ſaid; Since you know not our manner of fight, let me alone. 
               Oureſtolph ſeeing that Aldene (Generall of the armie) doubted not a little of that which he had to doe, being deſirous of honour, and couetous not to bee the ſecond that ſhould  charge the Turkes, without further conſideration of the matter, ſpurred on amaine with his men of armes againſt the Baſhaes great ſquadron: but becauſe thoſe who were in the front tooke more vpon their left hand then on their right, they did not ſo fully incounter the ſaid ſquadron in the middeſt, but made as it were a touch alongſt the ſide of the ſquadron, but yet ſo forcibly, that they ouerthrew all thoſe yt they incountred withall. The Hungars did ſecond them, and charged but in the ſame place where the men of armes before them had attempted, without diſordering any. This ouerſight was the beginning of their diſorder, indiſcreetly preſſing and incumbring one another, and ſeeing many Turkes dead on the ground, who not by them  (the Hungars) but by the people of Oureſtolph were ſo ouerthrowne, and many horſes courſing about the plaine, thinking that they had alreadie wonne the victorie, and not reſpecting the other ſquadron which was yet whole with ye Coaches, they ſeemed careleſſe any more to fight or expect the iſſue of the battaile, ſo that many among them diſmounting from their horſes, began

to rifle the Turkes which were remaining on the place either hurt or  ſlaine. The Baſha perceiuing this which was done at the firſt incounter, began to deſpayre, and thought the victorie inclined to the Chriſtians: wherevpon he began to retire his ſquadrons and waggons to ſaue himſelfe: but afterward ſeeing that none followed him, and that the Hungars did not orderly manage in the field, but with confuſion thwarting one another without any diſcipline, being more attentiue to the ſpoyle, then to the purſuite of victorie, and conſidering that a good part of his ſquadron was yet intire and whole, determined to make head and returne to the charge, commaunding firſt to aduance 300. Turkes, with certaine Ianiſaries and other ſouldiours which ſhould enter into the Caſtle, (which they eaſily performed  without any hinderance) and after they kept cloſe with their other ſquadrons in a ſtrong battalion, and began with great courage and nimblenes to giue in among the Hungars, who alreadie were disbanded and diſperſed euery where, to whom they gaue the greateſt mate that could be imagined, putting all to the ſword without any pitie, ſo that there were more horſe ſeene ſtraying vp and downe, then men running away, the plaine being ſo harried, that they could not finde any place to hide and ſaue themſelues. The men of armes in the meane time reunited themſelues into a ſtrong ſquadron, and deſirous againe to charge and thwart the Turkes, perceiued how the Hungars by their beaſtlines and couetouſnes of ſpoyle were all ouerthrowne and ſlaine, and the reſt that were remaining were put to ſlight.  In reſpect whereof, not willing to indaunger themſelues to the euent of fortune, ſo ſlightly to aduenture a ſecond charge, thought it more expedient to goe and ioyne with the Spanyards, who not once remoued from the place by the towne, but were ſtill raunged in battaile all vnited together, and who now began with good ſpeede to retire themſelues to other places of more ſtrength and ſecuritie. The Baſha of Buda ſeeing now the victorie to be his, &amp; greatly marueiling that that which he neuer thought of, was happened to him, could not eaſily be induced to beleeue it; but without pauſing he boldly ranged ouer the field as victorious, not ſparing the life of any which he incountered, commanding the like to be done in the towne by the Turks who  were in the Caſtle, and by thoſe which he had ſent for their ayd, who therein imployed themſelues ſo bloodily, that amongſt thoſe whom they knew their profeſſed enemies, they ſo tyrannouſly dominered, that they neither ſpared men, women, nor children, cauſing all pitifully to end their liues by the edge of the ſword. The Baſha afterwards gathering all his people together againe, and making of them a great ſquadron, raunged the plaine all the reſt of that day, and purſued the remainder of thoſe ſouldiours that Ottomiall had brought with him, of whom he defeated &amp; left vpon the ground there, more then 1500. dead and wounded, inſomuch as for that day, as well without  as within the towne, there was more then 5000. perſons that periſhed: and afterwards reſting himſelfe, as one tyred in ſhedding ſo much blood, and to ſee whether any thing elſe would offer it ſelfe vnto him, he deſcried a farre off to come towards the towne 300. Aiduchs (who are footmen) who two daies before that our men had receiued this ouerthrow, went to ſeeke their

fortunes in the Turkes countrie for ſpoyle: which they well performed with  great ſlaughter of the enemies, and returned from thence well laden, thinking to finde all things as they left them, not any thing dreaming that in ſo ſhort a time and ſo miſerably, Fortune had brought them to ſo vniuerſall a ruine. Thus ioyfully continuing on their iourney, and haſtning themſelues to Zegedin, as though they had been to goe to their owne homes, they diſcouered the Baſhaes ſquadron, whereat they were greatly aſtoniſhed, doubting whether they were enemies or no: neuertheleſſe perſwading themſelues they were of our people, who were there placed for ſome good purpoſe, they reſted aſſured, and began againe to proceede on their way: they marched not much further, but they were perceiued by the Baſha, who knowing  them to be of our Aiduchs, and a ſmall number, and that they had no woods to ſaue themſelues, but only a little Church, which was not farre from them, they began to prepare towards them, who ſeeing themſelues ſo ſuddenly aſſailed and enuironed, contrarie to their expectation, were not any thing amazed thereat: but euery man taking the courage of a lyon, began ſo fiercely to fight, continually retyring towards the Church, that although there did not any one of them eſcape, yet neuertheleſſe they ſold their liues ſo deare, that there was not any one of them ſlaine, but firſt he killed a Turke or two, and many three or foure, and theſe did twice as much endamage the Baſhes people, as all thoſe which Ottomiall had brought againſt them, beſides his  3000. horſe.
            Theſe being thus defeated, the Baſha remained entire Lord both of the field and towne: where being entered, he gaue in token of victorie to all his people, as well in money as in apparell, what he himſelfe thought good. And after hauing thanked Fortune for ſuch happy ſucceſſe, he addreſſed himſelfe to the repayring of the towne, and to mend vp that which our people had ſpoyled. Whileſt the Baſha was imployed in the defeate of theſe Aiduchs, Aldene retyred himſelfe with his Spanyards and men of armes with ſo great haſte and ſpeede, as if the Baſha had been at their backes, or all the Turkiſh Caualarie had purſued them, himſelfe being the onely cauſe of this ouerthrow,  in reſpect of his negligence and ſmall iudgement, becauſe he had not cauſed theſe Aiduchs to ſtay and fight. Thus retyring and flying from Zegedin, he trauailed in one day and a night 16. miles, which maketh 32. French miles, and retyred himſelfe to a Caſtle named Cornoch, not farre from Cornoch. Lippa.
            During this ſaid battaile, there happened a ſtrange accident to a ſouldiour, which I would not let paſſe in ſilence, eſteeming it worthie of memorie: and this it was. When Aldene paſſed Tibiſcus to goe to Zegedin, he left a Corporall The cowardlines of a Spaniſh ſouldiour, who in the end killed himſelfe. of a ſquadron, named Higueras, with certaine ſouldiours, who was eſteemed a man of good ſufficiencie, and very valiant, and he was left there to keepe the boates in which he had paſſed the riuer, to the end he ſhould continually  haue them in readines, &amp; as it were for any neceſſitie which might happen. Now this ſouldiour being in perſon at the guard of the paſſage, vpon the day that the defeate aforeſaid happened, ſeeing a multitude of men to come towards him flying, and demaunding of them what was happened,

and for what cauſe they ranne ſo haſtily. They anſwered him: that all our  people were quite defeated and cut in peeces by the Baſha of Buda, and that to warrant themſelues from his victorious hand, they fled in the greateſt haſte they could to ſaue themſelues. This ſouldiour hearing this, without any other inquirie or information of the ſurpluſage, aſſuredly beleeuing that the Spanyards were alſo defeated, vnlooſed all the barkes for feare of being purſued, &amp; preſently paſſed to the other ſide of the water. Theſe other ſouldiours who were with him did the like, and entering a wood together, they tooke the way towards Themeſuar, the Corporall of the ſquadron hauing a boy with him who came ſomewhat behinde: and trauailing along with others a good while, he preſently recalled his ſpirits to him, thinking of that  which cowardly hee had done; and ſet before his eyes the little eſteeme which euery man would haue of him, in ſo vily forſaking thoſe boates which Aldene had giuen him in charge, without making further inquirie how all things were paſſed at Zegedin: and further conſidering, that if happely the Spanyards were ſaued, he could neuer haue the courage to look thē in the face: &amp; on the other ſide, if they were loſt, that thoſe that ſhuld ſee him come ſo ſound &amp; ſafe, might demand of him the occaſion and manner how his companions were ſo ouerthrowne, to which he could neither ſatisfie nor anſwer thē; he began now to turmoyle his braine vpon theſe conſiderations, and being plunged into the depth of ſhame for this his vile flight, ſo farre was he growne into horror thereof, that he reſolued to kill himſelfe: and  drawing out his ſword for that purpoſe, he was in good time preuented by his boy, who fearing that his maſter would continue in his wicked purpoſe; to aſſure his life, hee tooke away his ſword and poynard from him, which the other willingly ſuffered him to doe, diſſembling that which gladly hee would haue executed. The boy not thinking of any other thing, and aſſuring himſelfe of his maſters life, by reaſon of his weapons which he had taken away, tooke no further care nor reſpect to him. But this ſouldiour perceiuing the little account that his ſeruant made of him, faining to repoſe himſelfe a little out of the way, commaunded that he ſhould there attend. Whileſt the boy had no other regard of him, it was not long but, that he fell  on ſleepe, being drowſie and wearie of his iourney. And when his maſter ſawe himſelfe alone, hee preſently charged his harquebuze, and ſet the mouth of the peece againſt his ſtomacke, and diſcharged it with his foote, which ſhot him quite through, ſo that within a ſhort time after he gaue vp the ghoſt; and ſo long as his life laſted, he did no other thing but inſtantly deſire his boy (who at the noyſe came running thither) that he would finiſh the killing of him, it being not fitting (ſaid he) that a man ſhould liue, who ſo diſhonourably was fled, and eſpecially being meerely ignorant for what cauſe, and vpon what occaſion hee had ſo done: and with theſe words the  ſoule departed out of his bodie. Behold here the tragedie of this vnfortunate iourney, (which wee haue before deſcribed) which was the beginning and an vntimely forewarning of al the future and miſerable accidents which happened in this yeere 1552.
            About this time the newes of Frier George his death was brought to Rome,

by occaſion whereof Pope Iulius the third, and all the Cardinals, made great  complaints againſt Ferdinand, and thoſe who had ſlaine him, excommunicating The Pope excommunicateth the authors of George his death. them in the higheſt degree that could be. And although his Maieſties Ambaſſadours directly informed the Pope of the cauſe, for which he was put to death, his Holines notwithſtanding for all that would not be appeaſed, demaunding whether Frier George was of that bad diſpoſition as they deciphered him, and wherefore did their maſter write in his behalfe, for him to be a Cardinall, and being one, why did he tolerate him to bee ſlaine: and furthermore, for that he aſſured all the Colledge of Cardinals of his goodnes, fidelitie, and endeuour which hee had manifeſted againſt the Turkes, to the profit and commoditie of Chriſtendome: for which good and commendable  reports, he could by no meanes be induced to beleeue that he was now fallen into that crime, whereof he was accuſed: but rather that he was ſlaine by enuie, and to rob him of his treaſure and moueables, which were more worth then 300000. crownes: which in reſpect he was a Cardinall, The moueables of a Cardinall dying inteſtate, belong to the Pope. and dying inteſtate, they did of right belong to the Apoſtolike Sea. Moreouer, the Pope and Cardinals could not be ſilent concerning this, that with ſuch ignominie had laid hands vpon the blood of a Cardinall, which by no meanes they could ſupport or digeſt, in reſpect of the reuerend degree and honour due to that calling, and to giue example to others not to attempt the like enormitie. Thus they grieuouſly being incenſed againſt Ferdinand, the  Pope by no meanes would ſuſpend the excommunication: yet in the end, at the earneſt inſtance of his Ambaſſadours, he was contented and agreed, that three Cardinals with the Deane (who was the Cardinall of Trany) ſhould enquire and take notice of this fact, and ſhould ſee whether the death of Frier George had been vniuſtly proceeded in or no, and that they ſhould ſend appointed men to Vienna, and into thoſe countries, to informe him of the offence; and that in the meane time the Friers moueables ſhould be ſeazed in the name, and to the vſe of the Apoſtolike Chamber. Againſt this laſt demaund of the Pope, the Ambaſſadours obiected, that Ferdinand had alreadie diſpoſed of the ſaid moueables, as well to pay his ſouldiours, as for  other neceſſarie occaſions concerning the warre which daily he had againſt the Turks, and that they were not of that great value, nor ſo goodly and rich as was ſaid, but farre inclining to a meaner proportion. This accord being thus concluded, there were preſently ſome diſpatched to iourney to Vienna, to informe and inquire out the cauſe, and to proceede therein. To theſe Commiſſioners, his Maieſties agents failed not to manifeſt the infidelitie of the Frier, and how hee would haue accorded with the Turke, and purloyne Information of George his death. Tranſiluania from Chriſtendome, and make himſelfe abſolute Lord thereof, in paying tribute to the Infidels, and (as happely it was diſcouered by many of his letters writ to diuers Lords of the Turkes Court) to maſſacre all  thoſe who in his Maieſties name were vnder the conduct of Caſtalde. And to agrauate the matter the more, they produced many horrible facts, and the death of certaine perſons.
            Againſt ſuch accuſations, the Pope in defence of the Frier obiected many things, and among others produced certaine letters of the Grand Viccar

of Albe-iula, and of certaine other perſons, who aſſured him that he was ſlaine by the enuie and wickednes of Ferdinands Captaines, who doubting  that he meant to reeſtabliſh in the kingdome King Iohns ſonne; and not being able to tolerate that he was ſo plauſible and popular; and that they were in ſo little eſteeme with him; and that hee diſpoſed of all things as abſolute Lord of the countrie, without conferring with them of the particularities; to thruſt him out from among them, and to vſurpe his poſſeſſions, that abſolutely they might haue the commaund, they accuſed him to Ferdinand of treaſon, who too lightly repoſing credit in them, conſented that hee ſhould be thus cruelly ſlaine, it being afterward very apparant, that this treaſon was not inuented, but only to ſpoyle him of his treaſure and moueables,  there neuer yet falling out any matter, which could in any thing blemiſh or obſcure his honour.
            Whileſt vpon theſe particularities many aſſemblies were in the Deanes houſe, and that the Comiſſaries went to Vienna to inquire the manner of this ſaid fact, Andrew Battor was created Vayuode of Tranſiluania, and Stephen 
               Andrew Battor, Vayuode of Tranſiluania. 
               Loſonze Counte of Themeſuar, who would not haue taken the charge of that towne, except Ferdinand would graunt him a ſufficient companie of Spaniſh ſouldiours to remaine there with him: which was preſently graunted. Loſonze, Counte of Themeſuar. And for that they were not in the kingdome, but in the confines and frontiers of the enemie, they were preſently ſent for: and they being arriued,  
               Loſonze went from thence with them to Themeſuar, to repayre the fortification of that towne; and the Vayuode tooke regard to the affayres of the kingdome.
            Now it was alreadie diuulged in all parts, that Solyman had made Mahomet Baſha (his Lieutenant generall) to come and beſiege the townes of Themeſuar Mahomet Baſha commeth againſt Tranſiluania. and Lippa, and that he was onward on his way at Belgrade, where he amaſſed together a great armie to inuade that countrie. It was alſo euery where certainly bruited, that the Vayuode of Moldauia prepared the like to enter into the kingdome about Braſſouia. About the ſame time arriued in Tranſiluania the Counte of Helfeſtaine with 4000. old Germane ſouldiours,  bringing with him tenne peeces of Artillerie. By him Ferdinand writ to Caſtalde, that very ſhortly he would ſend him 1500. men of armes, and 7. companies more of Germanes, and that the Marqueſſe Sforce Palauicin ſhould alſo within a ſhort time bee with him with 3000. Italians and 2000. Hungarian ſouldiours, and with as many Caualarie as poſſible he could ſend him. Whileſt theſe preparations were directing on the one partie, Caſtalde and the Vayuode on the other made a decree, by which it was commaunded that all the gentlemen of the countrie ſhould aſſemble at the towne of Torde, and A Diet at Torde. there to aduiſe and determine for the defence of the countrie, vnderſtanding that Mahomet determined to enter at the ſame time in diuers places with  two armies: to wit, with his owne armie by the low Marches; and with the Moldauian armie by Braſſouia. All the Nobilitie being (according to this commaundement) aſſembled, order was giuen for neceſſaries, for the preſeruation of the publike weale; and it was concluded that the townes of Lippa and Themeſuar ſhould be well furniſhed with men and victuals, and that the

fortification ſhould with all expedition be preſently reared, for that the enemie might finde it well defended, and that the greateſt force of the kingdome  ſhould be aſſembled together, as the ancient cuſtome was in ſuch neceſſitie, and that they ſhould be mingled with thoſe who were in Ferdinands pay, and that of all they ſhould make but one armie, with which they were to march directly againſt the Moldauian, to hinder him from entering into that quarter, where there was not any ſtrong place to withſtand him, but only Segheſuar, which neuertheleſſe was not of that force that it could reſiſt Segheſuar. nor hinder him, but that at the firſt vollic of the Cannon he muſt needes alſo be maſter of Braſſouia, which was a towne of as great importance as any other Braſſouia. in Tranſiluania; and that likewiſe he ſhould not burne the Prouince of Seculia, poſſeſſed by the Sicilians, and in the middeſt of the kingdome. This  bruite and feare, although it had not brought with it any other inconuenience then a fabulous report, yet was it ſufficient to infuſe a dreadful amazement into the minds of the inhabitants, inſomuch that euery one with great loſſe did alreadie begin to retire to ſome other aboades, and abandon their owne homes and goods. And for that Torde was a place ſtrongly ſituated, Torde. commodious and abounding in all manner of victuals, it was concluded that there ſhould bee the Rende vous for the armie, and that thither ſhould come the Vayuode to receiue the ſouldiours according as they came thither. The gentlemen of the countrie being ſpeedily departed, with charge  and commiſſion to bring as many men as euery one was rated at: and being now arriued amongſt their people, with great expedition (obſeruing their commiſſion) they performed their charge, and began to march with their people to be there at the prefixed time and place.
            Whileſt they were thus aſſembling, there happened a memorable accident, which I would not omit to ſpeake of. There was at Torde an ancient cuſtome, and which yet continueth; and that is, that if the husband findeth his wife in adulterie, he may cauſe her there to bee publikely executed, in manner as I will ſpeake of: and alſo on the contrarie, if the wife finde her husband in the ſame fault, ſhe may purſue that againſt him, which he would doe againſt her. It happened then at that time, that a certaine Tayler who  
               The cuſtome betweene the husband and wife touching adulteric. was of Varadin, named Paul, found his wife in bed with one of his companions, and purſuing the cuſtome of the ſaid towne, he accuſed her of adulterie: and hauing proued the offence, it was permitted him to haue the courſe of law, to cut off her head with a Sable in the middeſt of the market place. She being brought thither by her husband, and by the courſe of Iuſtice, and the appointed houre being come for this execution; ſhe with teares and ſighs kneeling downe before him, began pitifully to deſire that hee would pardon her notorious fault, faithfully promiſing him, that from that time Forward, ſhe would hold his honour moſt deare, and that he ſhould neuer  hereafter haue any occaſion to bee offended againſt her; and that it would pleaſe him to giue her her life, in regard of the kinde affection which he alwaies bore her, during the time ſhe liued in good reputation, and that ſhe would euer after ſerue him, not as a husband, but as her Lord and maſter. (Good) Paul being ſurpriſed by theſe her wofull ſpeeches, and moued

by a (natural) kindnes to pitie, was content to pardon her, exhorting and perſwading  her to become a dutifull and louing wife: whereupon he abſolutely remitting all her hainous offence, tooke her to him againe. When within a while after it happened that this (dutifull) wife found her ſaid husband Paul in adulterie with a young wench: whereupon ſhe accuſed him to the Iuſtice, who cauſing him to be apprehended, appointed that he ſhould bee put into his wiues power, to execute him according to the foreſaid manner. She hauing brought him with officers to the deputed place, hee kneeled downe, and there (good kinde Paul) pitifully intreated her that ſhe would pardon him his offence; thinking that ſhe would neuer bee ſo vnkinde or cruell to him, but that ſhe would vſe the like counterchange of mercie, as he before in his owne behalfe had done to her. But by no meanes ſhe would  once vouchſafe to hearken to his complaints, but like an vngrateful monſter, Saue one frō the gallowes, and he will ſeeke to hang thee. forgetting all loue, and the fauours which ſhe had receiued of him, not moued with any loue or pitie, but followed the extremitie of the law of the place, lifting vp her arme on high, hauing a Sable in her hand, wherewith ſhe gaue him a blow vpon the necke, and like an inraged Bitch ſhe killed (kind) Paul. For this his death all the towne was greatly incenſed againſt her monſterous ingratitude, cenſuring her to be very cruell, for ſo requiting the former good deede which ſhe had receiued of her husband: and if ſhe had not preſently fled from thence, ſhe had receiued ſome ſiniſter and condigne inconuenience. And this ſeemed to many ſo vile an act, that the inhabitants  endeuoured to aboliſh this foule and infamous cuſtome. But by no meanes it could bee done, for that it was of long continuance in that place.
            In the meane time, Caſtalde ſent Counte Iohn Baptiſtad' Archo, in place of Iohn Baptiſta of Archo cō
                  maundeth within Braſſouia. of Counte Felixd' Archo, with a companie of Launſquenets to Braſſouia, to take the gouernment of that towne, in which vnder his charge hee alſo commaunded Charles Scerettin to goe with 200. men of armes, and another companie of Germanes, commaunding them that they ſhould not bouge from thence, vntill hee arriued there with his Campe, expreſſely charging the ſaid Counte, that with another companie of Germanes he ſhould ſeaze  vpon that Fortreſſe, which he had commaunded to bee made vpon the top of a little hill that maſtered the towne, and which not farre from it, within which he ſhould afterwards place the great and ſmall Artillerie, with as many people as he ſhould thinke to be neceſſarie to be able to defend it againſt the Moldauian, and to annoy him that he ſhould not incampe about it; becauſe that if he performed it, it would be the preſeruation of the towne, and the manifeſt ruine of the Moldauian, who (becauſe by that meanes there ſhould be taken from him the commoditie to lodge in that plaine) ſhould be forced to march through the mountaines, among which he ſhould endure  great incommodities, and trauaile much to paſſe through the ſame, and yet poſſibly he might be forced to retire.
            While theſe things were in doing, Sibinio (the capitall towne of the Saxons) offered to Caſtalde all the ſuccours and victuals which he ſhould need of againſt the Belerbey, yea, both of ſouldiours and money: for which their

kindnes he gaue them many heartie thankes, and entertaining their offers, he  willed them to bee in a readines, vpon any neceſſitie which ſhould bee offered.
            Thus as Fortune at her pleaſure ouerthrew the decrees and enterpriſes of Ferdinands Lieutenants and Captaines, with extreame daunger: ſo did ſhe in like manner play her part worſe in Germanie, where then was the Emperour Charles the 5. and Ferdinand King of the Romanes in the towne of Iſpurch. Duke Mauris of Saxonie (an Elector of the Empire) incenſed againſt Duke Mauris of Saxonie confederate with the King of France, raiſeth forces againſt the Emperour Charles. the ſaid Emperour, for that he would not deliuer the Lantgraue his father in law, who with Duke Frederick of Saxonie were detained priſoners, thinking that they had not performed their words, and finding himſelfe to be greatly iniuried, he was determined, in ſome ſort whatſoeuer, to ſet them at libertie,  being the rather incited thereunto, for that his ſaid father in law was come to the Court, vnder the ſafegard of his word, crediting the Emperours fidelitie, in promiſing to ſet him at libertie within a while after: who ſeeing it was not performed in a yeere, nor many moneths after, and finding himſelfe to bee thus mocked and abuſed: before hee came to that, which afterwards he was conſtrained to accōpliſh, he went to ſeek Ferdinand at Lintz, to intreate him that it would pleaſe his Maieſtie to negotiate with the Emperour ſo much, that he would not derogate from his faithfull promiſe, but ſet his father in law at libertie. Ferdinand was for the ſame occaſion come to Iſpurch, and conferring with the Emperour his brother about the requeſt of  Duke Mauris, he could by no meanes draw any other thing from him, but onely a good hope of a ſpeedie deliuerie. But Mauris eſteeming of this as of a vaine hope, preſently practiſed with William, the ſonne of the ſaid Lantgraue, and with the Duke of Mechelburge, and other Princes and kinſmen, as well of his father in lawes, as of the ſaid Duke of Saxonie: with whom making a firme and reſolute confederacie, ſeeing by loue and fayre intreaties they could not ſet theſe priſoners at libertie, but to deliuer them by force of armes, he made (by the ayd &amp; aſſiſtance of his confederates, and other ſecret enemies of the Emperour) a good ſtrong armie, hauing firſt negotiated and compacted with Henry King of France, that the ſaid King ſhould enter into  Germanie, to vphold and maintaine his affayres. According to this agreement, the King of France deſirous to aſſiſt the Duke, and greatly aſpiring to the Empire, failed not to bee preſent at the promiſed time with great forces. And on the other ſide, Mauris couertly brought his Campe to a little towne, which was but a mile from Spire, from whence with all diligence he departed towards Chiouze, and towards the Caſtle of Ambergh, which belonged to Ferdinand, and by the mountaines and other difficult paſſages, rude and vnknowne in the night time, in great ſilence he marched ſo farre, that then he thought he had the meanes and oportunitie to come in vpon the backes  of the Emperours people, and to cleere the way that might hinder and withſtand his ſafetie. Thus being arriued on the ſudden at Chiouze, he ſeazed on the gate thereof, which is betweene two mountaines in a deepe vallie, from whence hauing beaten the guard, he meant alſo to poſſeſſe the Caſtle. But being brauely defended by thoſe within, he could not make himſelfe

maſter thereof: whereupon leauing certaine people before it, hee went with  incredible diligence to Iſpurch, where was the Emperour and Ferdinand, who being aduertiſed of this ſudden noueltie, and greatly aſtoniſhed, not knowing what to doe in ſuch an vnlooked for accident of fortune, ſeeing themſelues diſarmed of forces, determined for his better ſecuritie to retire towards Carinthia. And thus the Emperor departing in the night in a Litter, ſomewhat ſickly, with Ferdinand, by Torch-light, he took the way of Villach, a towne ſituated vpon the riuer of Drauus: where being arriued, they ſoiourned there certaine daies, to ſee what courſe Duke Mauris tooke: who being now arriued in Iſpurch, and not finding the Emperour there (who the night before was fled from that place) would not that any ſhould offer violence  there, nor to no other place belonging to the King of the Romanes. Being a little from Iſpurch, there came to him a gentleman of Ferdinands retinue, to know the occaſion that incited him to take armes againſt the Emperour, and what his meaning was, and for what occaſion he poſſeſſed certaine places of his, and entered into them as a publike enemie, and not as a friend. To theſe demaunds Mauris anſwered him, that he was not come to offend the Emperour, nor to withhold any of his townes or Lordſhips from him, neither had he taken armes againſt him, but onely againſt his enemies and aduerſaries; among whom were the Biſhop of Arras, the Duke of Albe, and certaine other Councellors of the Emperour, who were ſaid to be in that quarter, and whom he would purſue and take, if it were poſſible: and that concerning  his ſacred Maieſtie, he had no other meaning but a good and ſincere affection: and if he could not meete the ſaid enemies by the 25. of May next inſuing, hee would retire his armie, without offending him in the leaſt thing whatſoeuer, and that hee would haue reſpect to his ſubiects, as to his owne, and that afterwards he would bee at the Diet, which his Maieſtie had publiſhed, hoping (that being there, with many Princes and States) there might be made ſome good peace and reconciliation betweene the Emperour and him.
            Whileſt this accord was treated of betweene Ferdinand and Mauris, the  King of France ſtill aduanced himſelfe to further the proceedings of Mauris, 
               The King of France compelled to forſake Germanie. when newes was brought him that Martin Roſtan was entered with a great armie into Piccardie and Champagne, where he made great ſpoyle &amp; waſte, and had fiered three townes, and burned almoſt twentie Caſtles, putting all to fire and ſword, and that with great iourneys he marched towards Paris. By occaſion of this newes, the King was conſtrained (maugre his liking, and for all Fortune ſeemed to ſmile on him) to returne backe and defend his owne. Thus he who thought to make himſelfe maſter of anothers, was in danger to loſe his owne: and hauing left and retired from Germanie, hee forced Roſtan to returne and leaue his countrie at libertie, which was alreadie  greatly aſtoniſhed, yea and euen Paris it ſelfe, which (for feare) was in great diſorder. Mauris hauing gotten little of his deſired intendment, departed from Iſpurch, and from the Countie of Tyroll, with his men: and leauing Chiouze went to the Diet, where Ferdinand himſelfe was incontinently after. In this Diet were treated many important things, but eſpeciallie the

peace of Mauris with the Emperour, which at the intreatie of Ferdinand, and many other Lords, it was concluded in this manner: that the Emperour  
               An agreement betweene the Emperor and Duke Mauris. willingly and freely ſhould deliuer the Lantgraue to Mauris, and the Duke of Saxonie to his children, and that Mauris ſhould bee bound to goe and ſerue Ferdinand againſt the Turke with 12000. Lanſquenets, and 3000. horſe all the whole ſummer. This concluſion ended, with many other articles, Mauris diſmiſſed his ſouldiours, and the Lantgraues children went from thence with their people againſt a Captaine named Henſtain, who in the Emperours name was entered into the land of Heſſe, and who had defeated and ouerthrowne in battaile the Counte of Odemburg, who was in the field with 16. Germane Enſignes. But in regard of that ouerthrow, the Lantgraues  children were forced to retire to their places of more ſecuritie; and Duke Mauris ſent the reſt of his armie to raiſe the ſiege from before Magdebourg in Saxonie, which was beſieged by the Marqueſſe of Brandeburg and the Duke of Brunſwick. Vpon the approaching of Mauris his people, the ſiege was preſently raiſed, the towne remaining at libertie vnder certaine conditions, and then the Duke of Brunſwick, and the Marqueſſe Albert tooke the Emperours part, with Counte Mansfield, and came to ſerue his Maieſtie againſt France with 15. Enſignes of Lanſquenets, 500. men of armes, and other light horſemen.
            Behold the end of theſe tumults, which greatly blemiſhed the renowne  and glorie of ſo great an Emperour, inſomuch that it may ſeeme almoſt impoſſible for him (who would but conſider his puiſſance, and the victories which he before had gotten) to beleeue that he ſhould bee forced to flye to Villach. But men ſhall not neede much to maruaile at it, if they will duly conſider the effects of mutable Fortune, which effects oftentimes cauſe ſuch ſtrange aduentures, and very often bring to paſſe that men fall into ſuch labyrinths, for that they eſteeme not of any other mans force: and ſuch a man is accounted moſt happie, who can well gouerne and temper himſelfe therein.
            All theſe diſcords being thus appeaſed in Germanie, there began others to  ſpring vp in Tranſiluania, no leſſe troubleſome and daungerous then the former. For Queene Izabella complaining her ſelfe againſt Ferdinand, becauſe that the promiſes and conditions to her graunted in the agreement which Izabella complaineth of Ferdinand. was made vpon her rendering the kingdome of Tranſiluania, were not in any reſpect kept nor performed, did greatly ſolicite the King of Polonia, and the Queene Bonna her mother, to require the performance of them, and incited the principalleſt of the Prouince to this, that her ſonne might bee inueſted into his kingdome: exclaiming of him that he had not giuen her free poſſeſſion of the Dutchie of Oppolia, of Monſterberg, and Ratibor, with 20000. crownes of yeerely reuenew, as was promiſed her: and the better  to make vp this ſumme, they meant to reckon to her certaine reuenewes which conſiſted in woods, fowles, and the fiſhing of certaine Pooles and Lakes, which ſhe eſteemed vncertaine, and ſubiect to the hazard of times: ſhe further complaining of them, that he had not paied her 150000. crownes for her dowrie and debts, for which Caſſouia was ingaged to her: and vpon

theſe ſaid complaints ſhe ſent Matthias Lobosky to Ferdinand, to ſolicite the laſt expedition. By him Ferdinand gaue her to vnderſtand, that his meaning  was alwaies to ſatisfie her, according to that which hee had promiſed, and to giue her and her ſonne more then was concluded vpon in their agreements: and if ſhe had not the Dutchie of Rhatibor, and the reſt giuen her in full poſſeſſion, the fault was not in him, but rather proceeded from the Marqueſſe Iohn of Brandeburg, who was vnder the wardſhip of the Electors of Saxonie, and of Brandeburg, of Marqueſſe Albert, and of the Duke of Pruſſia, without whoſe conſent there could bee nothing done, and the rather in reſpect of the far diſtance of their aboades; and alſo becauſe that the troubles which lately happened by Duke Mauris, had ſlackned this buſines, in regard whereof it were neceſſarie that ſhe ſhould a while expect; and that if ſhe  would not haue this patience, hee would then alot her other Dukedomes and Demaines to her liking, with ſuch reuenewes as was determined vpon in their agreement: greatly maruailing at this, that ſhe was not contented with the reuenew of the Dutchie of Oppolia, and that with that ſhe made no account of the fowle and fiſh, which he eſteemed one of the greateſt reuenewes in the whole countrie, for that they were wont to bee yeerely farmed at tenne or twelue thouſand Dollers, the ſaid ſumme amounting to tenne thouſand crownes, or there abouts. As for her dowrie, he aſſured her it ſhould be ſatisfied, in giuing him ſome reſpite, and that in the meane time hee would allow her ſufficient conſideration for it, as vpright men ſhould  thinke meete: and that beſides, he would eſteeme her as his ſiſter, and would account of her ſonne, as of his owne begotten, perſwading her with good and friendly ſpeeches to liue contentedly. With this anſwer Lobosky returned, more inriched by a future hope, then a preſent effect. In the meane time, the King and Queene of Polonia ceaſed not to endeuour themſelues for her ſatisfaction, and ſecretly in her behalfe practiſed, that ſhe ſhould remaine a Ladie and Queene as before.
            It was then that the bruite greatly increaſed of the Turkes huge preparation: Caſtalde ſoliciteth Ferdinand for ſuccours. for feare of which, Caſtalde conſidering the ſmall force which was in the countrie to reſiſt this common and tyrannicall enemie, gaue notice to  
               Ferdinand of the preſent neceſſitie he was in, deſiring him he would not faile to ſend him the 50000. men which hee promiſed, and to cauſe Palauicin to haſten himſelfe, that he ſhould with all ſpeede come vnto him, with the people and Artillerie which he could gather. Ferdinand returned him anſwer, that for that time he could not ſend him the ſuccours which hee had promiſed, in reſpect of diuers lets which of late he had in Germanie: but that hee would ſolicite Palauicin, that hee would bring his people into Tranſiuania, and would alſo ſend others, as the commoditie and neceſſitie of the time would permit him, and that he hoped that Duke Mauris would very ſhortly come himſelfe in perſon to this warre with 12000. Launſquenets,  and 3000. horſe, according to the tenour of his Obligation: and in the meane time he exhorted him to doe his beſt endeuour to redreſſe the difficulties of that Prouince, which he wholly recommended to him, and that relying vpon his care and wiſedome, he aſſured himſelfe that he would giue

order when and where neede ſhould require, and that he would prouide for  all neceſſaries, as was fitting for a prouident and expert Captaine, ſuch an one as he eſteemed him to bee, commaunding him that he ſhould aſſiſt himſelfe with the reuenewes of the Churches of that kingdome which were vacant and without Paſtors: and for the notice whereof, he had deputed the Biſhop of Veſprimia, and George Veruery, who ſhould make a role of their values, and ſend the ſame to his Maieſtie to make an equall deuiſion thereof: and further, commaunding him to render to all the officers and ſeruants of Frier George their moueables, and ſpecially thoſe which were found at Zaluoch, and that of the other he ſhould cauſe to be made an Inuentorie: and further, that hee ſhould pay the 400. Vſſarons (who are light horſemen,  mounted and armed a la Hungreſque) who were in the Friers ſeruice while he liued, for feare they ſhould goe and ſerue the enemie, and that they ſhould be vnder the commaund of Operſtolph, who was the principall Captaine of Operſtolph. the Caualarie in Tranſiluania, and who not long ſince was entertained on his Maieſties part: all which was preſently performed.
            
               Loſonze being at Themeſuar with 600. horſe, and hauing with him Don Gaſper, &amp; the companie of Diego Velez, which was 300. men, (ouer whom the Loſonze commandeth Themeſuar, &amp; furniſheth it with men. Enſigne commaunded) and 300. Bohemians, and two companies of Germanes, they in all making 1600. men, beſides the inhabitants, who were apt and able to beare armes, who might amount vnto nine hundred men. Caſtalde ſent him one moneths pay for all the ſouldiours, and two hundred other  Germane Harquebuziers, ſending him word by a Spanyard, that he ſhould not faile to get into the towne the greateſt ſtore of victuals he could, to maintaine a longer time all the ſieges, which vpon a ſudden might happen to him: and beſides, he ſent him ſo much Artillerie and munition, as was ſufficient for him to withſtand all the aſſaults the Turkes ſhould offer him. In like ſort he did aduertiſe him by Don Gaſper, that he could not then ſuccour him any more, in reſpect of the few men himſelfe had, with whom he could not goe into the field againſt ſo puiſſant an armie as Mahomets was, for that he was diſappoynted of the ayd he expected frō 
               Ferdinand, by reaſon of the late troubles happened in Germanie, and that he had no other Infantric vpō 
                whom he might truſt, but a few Spanyards who remained vnto him, with 4000. Germanes which lately were come to him, and 1000. men of armes: therefore he willed him that he ſhould rampier and fortifie himſelfe the beſt he could, and prepare himſelfe for the defence of that towne, which in the end would be the onely fountaine and cauſe of all his glorie and reputation: and that he ſhould not expect to bee relieued by thoſe of the countrie (who ſhould preſently be aſſembled) for that they were not eſteemed ſuch that any truſt was to be repoſed in them: and therefore he ſent him word, that it was requiſite that in any caſe hee ſhould make of neceſſitie a vertue, and that  ſo much the rather, becauſe he ſaw himſelfe conſtrained to march with thoſe few men which he had, againſt the Vayuode of Moldauia, who would enter into Tranſiluania by Braſſouia, where he had not any Fortreſſe to ſtay him; thoſe of the countrie ſuppoſing that the damage which they ſhould receiue on that ſide would bee greater, then that which Mahomet could bring vnto

him about Themeſuar, by reaſon of the ſtrong places which were in that  quarter, and for the commoditie which was there to reſiſt him: for which conſiderations he was forced to march againſt the Moldauian, to withſtand him from entering into the countrie, and from the poſſeſſion of that towne, and to goe into the field with as great force as he could, and that beſides he was conſtrained to doe this, except he would ſee the kingdome vtterly loſt, and becauſe of the little content which he perceiued in the hearts of euery one, whom he ſaw more inclined to a reuolt then a defence: and alſo becauſe he knew that this quarter was more commodious and fit for aduantages to keepe the field with a few men, by reaſon of woods, mountaines, and other hard paſſages, then was that about Lippa or Themeſuar: for which difficulties  and aduantages, he not any thing feared the Moldauian, much leſſe his Caualarie, which he doubted not but with his Infantrie to defeate and force them recoyle. And whereas he could not come to relieue him, without a like armie to that of Mahomets, that he and Don Gaſper ſhould doe their vttermoſt deuoyre to defend themſelues, and valiantly to reſiſt the enemie in that quarter, whileſt he of his part ſhould make reſiſtance againſt the Moldauian, aſſuring him, that if his enterpriſe did fortunately ſucceede, (as hee truſted in God it would) he would preſently come to ſuccour him with as great an armie as hee could: and although hee might not come neere vnto Themeſuar, for that the enemie was very ſtrong, yet he would lodge neere to Lippa, where, cauſing a trench to be digged, going from thence to Solimos,  he would not (by reaſon of that Fortreſſe) feare the Turkiſh armie, thinking aſſuredly to ſeate his Campe in ſuch a ſure place, that the ſituation thereof ſhould be able to defend him againſt the violence of the enemie, hauing on the left hand the riuer Maroſſe, and on the right the high mountaines; from whence he well hoped to be ſo offenſiue to the enemie, that he would either conſtraine him to retire, or elſe ſomewhat neglect the ſiege, inſomuch that he ſhould be able to relieue and preſerue it: earneſtly importuning them both to be of good courage, and in like ſort to perſwade all the Spanyards whom he intreated, to remember what they were, and to thinke vpon that which  they were wont brauely to performe when they were in ſuch wars as theſe, which through all the world had gained to them the name of valour, which they ought now to maintaine without ſpot or blemiſh, eſteeming this ſucceſſe no leſſe glorious to them, then the former on his owne part; aſſuring himſelfe that they would no leſſe vertuouſly performe that now, then that which they had alwaies performed in ſuch honourable exploytes. Beſides, he ſent them certaine aduertiſements very profitable and neceſſarie, how they ſhould behaue and gouerne themſelues in fights and aſſaults which ſhould bee offered them: and for that they were young and of little experience, he intreated them continually and onely to thinke vpon this, that he who fighteth couragiouſly to the end, doth maintaine his life in defending  himſelfe.
            Whileſt theſe directions were giuen on the one ſide, Aldene on the other informed Caſtalde that hee was in meane eſtate, and that hee could not any Aldene fainthearted. longer remaine at Lippa to take charge thereof, and that he ſhould ſend another

in his place to take that charge. Caſtalde conceiued of this with great ſorow, for that the time was ſo ſhort that hardly he could make prouiſion therfore,  conſidering that this was to incourage the enemie, and quaile his owne people, ſeeing before their eyes ſuch a Chieftaine to forſake that Fortreſſe, and that another ſhould come thereinto for defence, conſidering that ſuch a worthie man for his owne honour was come to keepe and defend it. Neuertheleſſe he returned him anſwer, that if he thought not himſelf ſure within Lippa, for feare of the Baſha (although it was now ſomewhat late) hee ſhould giue him notice thereof, for that he would ſend ſuch an one thither, who ſhould defend it. Aldene remembring himſelfe of the fault which he had committed, and chaunging his opinion ſent him word, that ſeeing he  was now reſident in the towne, he doubted not but to defend it. Theſe things thus concluded on, Caſtalde preſently departed from Torde and went to Coloſuar, there to aſſemble the ſouldiours that were in Ferdinands pay, and which were ſent him, in like ſort giuing aduertiſement to the Counte of Helfeſtaine, that he ſhould ſpeedily repayre to him with his Regiment of 4000. Germanes, ſending him two payes of foure which they ſhould receiue. He alſo ſent to Zena (Generall of all the ſouldiours in that countrie) that he ſhould preſently and with all ſpeede he could come to him, becauſe he waited for no more but him, that ſo he might march into the field.
            As theſe preparations (which we haue ſpoken of) were in hand in Tranſiluania,  
               Mahomet in the meane time (leauing Belgrade behinde him) was The armie of Mahomet Baſha. now betweene the two riuers, and had alreadie erected a bridge vpon Tibiſcus. He had in his Campe 100000. men, and 60. peeces of Artillerie, among which were thirtle double Cannons. With him alſo came the Belerbey of Greece, who the yeere before was Lieutenant generall in that countrie for the Grand Seigniour, and he brought with him vnder his conduct 20000. horſe. He had alſo another great Captaine with him named Caſſombaſſa, who likewiſe conducted 15000. horſe, and 2000. Tartars, who anciently were called Scythians, which are a warlike people, cruel, and greatly redoubted Tartars. by theſe nations, and they fight on horſebacke with Bow and arrowes,  Sable and Mace.
            The enemies being in this place, the ſouldiours of the kingdome were in a manner aſſembled altogether, when Counte of Helfeſtaine arriued with his Germanes, being halfe in a mutinie, and they were that night lodged in one of the Suburbes of the towne, which were very great. The day following, Caſtalde minding to depart, theſe by no meanes would diſlodge; but mutining, they ſeazed on the Artillerie, (as their cuſtome is, not willing to take one pay for two, which was due to them, which alone ſhould then haue bin payed them) and after they imbattailed themſelues to poſſeſſe and ſacke the towne. And vpon this reſolution they began to batter on the top of the  
               Coloſuar battered by the Germane mutiners. walles. Which Caſtalde ſeeing, and that this was not done counterfeitly, he ſent to the inhabitants that they ſhould defend themſelues. Whereupon they betaking themſelues to armes, and comming to the walles, they began to diſcarge their Artillerie and good Harquebuzes among the Germanes, making a great ſlaughter of them: who ſeeing themſelues put into diſorder,

they determined to take Caſtalde: whereof being aduertiſed, hee ſpeedily retired to Torde; ſending them word, that if they would not be appeaſed,  
               Caſtalde conſtrained to retire to Torde, to auoide the daunger of the Germane mutiners. he would preſently ſend his armie (which was alreadie at Torde) againſt them, to hew them in peeces, and after commaunded that the Caualarie ſhould draw into the field, and made a ſhew to march towards Coloſuar to ſuppreſſe the Germanes: who vnderſtanding of this newes, and knowing they were in a place where they could neither helpe nor defend themſelues, The mutinie appeaſed. and that this ſedition was not any thing profitable to them, but to the contrarie very pernitious, and full of certaine daungers, they preſently appeaſed and quieted themſelues, without any further motion or ſoliciting them, and leading the Artillerie along, with their Enſignes diſplayed, came to  Torde, where (for all their mutinie) they got no other thing, but onely that the Counte did caſheere fiftie of them: ſo that beſides the death of many who were ſlaine at Coloſuar, they receiued this condigne chaſtiſement, which they worthely deſerued for their rebellious temeritie.
            Behold how in this yeere began the diſcord amongſt vs, as though the comming of two ſuch puiſſant armies againſt vs, was not ſufficient to counterchecke our turbulent ſpirits, but we of our ſelues by another warre, worſe then the firſt, muſt ouerthrow and make hauocke of one another.
            
               Caſtalde being buſied at Torde, in aſſembling his men to march againſt the Moldauian, who had alreadie paſſed the mountaines with 40000. men, The armie of the Moldauian. and entered into the countrie of Braſſouia, newes was brought him how  
               Mahomet hauing paſſed Tibiſcus, not without great difficultie, was alreadie incamped with all his armie before Themeſuar, and that from S. Iohns day Themeſuar beſieged by Mahomet. vntill that preſent, he did batter it in three places with 70. peeces of Artillerie, and that thoſe within did brauely defend themſelues with great reſolution, and that it was alreadie twelue daies ſince the batterie neither ceaſed day nor night, and that it ſtill continued. This newes was brought to him by a Spanyard, conſorted with a Rhatian ſouldiour, being both apparelled after one manner, and were in the night departed from Themeſuar, being commaunded to come to Caſtalde, to demaund a new ſupplie of men,  for that the Artillerie had ſlaine many of them. Caſtalde vpon this report preſently diſpatched a meſſenger for Ottomiall, who then was at Iula, (a very Ottomiall. Iula, or Giula. ſtrong towne enuironed with riuers) and deſired him that with 400. Aiduchs he would endeuour to enter into Themeſuar, promiſing him that if he could finde the meanes to relieue it with theſe ſuccours, he ſhould ſo well be rewarded, that during his life he would thinke himſelfe well contented. This done, himſelfe ſet forward againſt the Moldauian, hauing no more in Caſtaldes armie. his Campe then 12000. men, as well horſe as foote. The Moldauian was alreadie incamped in a paſſage two miles from Braſſouia, where Counte Iohn Baptiſted' Archo entertained him with braue and fierce skirmiſhes, and bearded him ſo, that he ſuffered not any ſouldiour to disband himſelfe from Iohn Baptiſte d' Archo ſtayeth the Moldauian. 
                his battalion, but preſently he bought it with the price of his life: and ſo much did he annoy him, that he neither could nor durſt for his life march any further, nor ioyne himſelfe with the Baſha; which was a thing of no ſmall importance, in reſpect of the miſerie and trouble of the time. The

Counte had ſo well ordered his people, and thoſe which were left him of Counte Felixd' Archo (who in Ianuarie laſt was gone to Vienna) that as often  as the enemies ranged in that place, they ſuffered not any of them to returne aliue, and he continuing ſtill victorious, and valiantly fighting, gaue them ſo many routes and ouerthrowes, that they ſcarcely any more durſt ſo ſuddenly aſſaile our men, as they were wont. And among other ouerthrowes which the enemies receiued, there was one which partly happened through the Countes prowes, for that the Moldauian retired himſelfe behinde: and it fortuned in this ſort. Counte Iohn Baptiſte was aduertiſed that a troupe of Moldauians (among which were 300. Turkes, and as many Tartars) would goe and diſcouer Braſſouia, and that they ſhould goe by certaine paſſages, which of the one ſide had many mariſhes, and of the other  certaine hils very rough and tedious: among which hee appoynted an ambuſcado of Germane Harquebuziers, and certaine Caualarie, who after that the Turkes were paſſed, they ſhould make in vpon them at their returne, when they vnderſtood that thoſe of the towne were ſallied forth to skirmiſh with them. This multitude then of Barbarians preſenting themſelues vpon theſe paſſages, and hauing paſſed them, they managed and ranged about the towne, and were preſently aſſailed by a ſtrong troupe of horſe and foote, who ſallied foorth to skirmiſh with them, and were ſo hotly charged, that they were forced to retire more then ordinarie: and comming to thoſe places, of which I haue ſpoken, they were in ſuch ſort aſſailed behinde, without  thinking thereupon by thoſe who were in ambuſcado, that being incloſed betweene them, they were ſo throughly beaten, that there remained neither Moldauian, Tartar, nor Turke aliue, nor any who could carrie newes to the Moldauian of their ouerthrow, they being all either ſlaine or taken priſoners in the ſtraites: and in token of this victorie, thoſe of Braſſouia ſent three waggons laden with thoſe heads (who were ſlaine) to Caſtalde, who was neere approached to the Moldauian, and ſo boldly, that the enemy thought he had more men then was reported vnto him, not being able to perſwade himſelf, that a man of that qualitie (as was Caſtalde) durſt appeare in the field, except  his armie were of more ſtrength, or at the leaſt equall to his. Vpon this opinion he was not ſo hardie to attend him, but ſpeedily and with ſo great diſorder retired, that he loſt many men in his retraict, and had loſt more in making The retraict of the Moldauian. paſſage for his Artillerie through the mountaines, if happely Counte Iohn Baptiſte had had more men to haue followed him, ſeeing 500. horſe which onely purſued him, had been ſufficient to haue put him in diſorder and into ſuch hazard, that little would haue wanted but he would haue abandoned all his Artillerie to the chance and hazard of fortune. And if the Sicilians had then done their deuoire, and ſhewed themſelues ſuch as they ſhould haue done, moſt certaine that day was come wherein the Moldauian  had loſt his armie, his kingdome, together with his life, and Tranſiluania had been no more moleſted on that ſide: and this defeature might haue been a happie preſident for others neuer to attempt the like inuaſion. Vpon the newes of this retraict, it was reported that Caſtalde would diſlodge from Segheſuar, where he remained, vnderſtanding that the enemie had not diſſolued

his Campe, but that he with his people were incamped on the other ſide  of the mountaines, by reaſon whereof he was conſtrained to ſoiourne certaine daies in that towne, and there to expect what the Moldauian would doe: for that if he ſhould then depart from thence, the other would preſently returne againe into Tranſiluania, (as for certaine he vnderſtood) and in reſpect of that feare and ſuſpition, he durſt not yet depart, ſo that he could not march to the reliefe of Themeſuar.
            Being thus ſtayed, continually there came aduertiſements to him by the way of Caranſebeſſe and Lippa, that the affayres of Themeſuar were in bad Themeſuar in bad termes. tearmes, in reſpect of thoſe who were within, who had parlied with the Turkes, who told them that the ſuccours of the 400. Aiduchs, which Caſtalde 
                had ſent them, vnder the conduct of Ottomiall, were defeated and cut in Ottomiall defeated by the Turkes. peeces by them. Vpon this newes Francis Henriquez was preſently diſpatched to Lippa, that vpon his returne he might make recitall of the veritie of the fact, and in what ſtate Themeſuar ſtood, and how euery thing was there, and whether it could defend it ſelfe any longer: and alſo to informe him of the ſtate, and condition of Lippa, to the end he might prouide therefore, in ſuch ſort that it might remaine intire and ſafe from being attained of Mahomets furie. At the ſame inſtant newes was brought that the Turkes had ſlaine Captaine Don Gaſper, whoſe companie was giuen to Roderic Vigliandrando, with command to endeuour himſelfe to enter into Themeſuar, conſidering they were in danger to periſh, and for no other cauſe then that there  was not any to gouerne them. They ſent thither alſo with him Captaine Andrew Lopez with his companie, and 200. Germane Harquebuziers, to whom Caſtalde ſaid, that he well knew this enterpriſe was difficult, ſpecially conſidering the enemies being very vigilant to hinder that no ſuccours could enter into Themeſuar: and that they were very glad that thoſe Aiduchs, which Ottomiall brought vnder his conduct to the reliefe of that towne, paſſed by the edge of the ſword: and that neuertheleſſe whatſoeuer hee ſhould doe in this behalfe, was to no other purpoſe but that hee might faithfully diſcharge his dutie, &amp; not giue any occaſion to detracting tongues to cenſure hardly of him: and that to that end to relieue this towne (either  by one meanes or other) he ſent them, greatly relying himſelfe in the good eſteeme which he conceiued of their manhoods; aſſuring himſelfe that they would to the vttermoſt endeuour themſelues to enter therein, and that either of them would now vſe this commendable wiſedome, which euen vntill this preſent was worthily noted in them, promiſing them, that within ſhort time with as great force as he could leauie, he would come and lodge by the Caſtle of Lippa, to the end, that if the affayres of Themeſuar did badly ſucceede, thoſe of Lippa ſhould at the leaſt be preſerued, and that towne (which ſo much imported the good and commoditie of euery one) ſhould  bee maintained and kept. Theſe Captaines thus diſpatched, departed with their people. But the diligence and care of Caſtalde ſerued to ſmall purpoſe at that time: for vpon the ſame day in which they tooke leaue of Caſtalde, Francis Henriquez (who a little before was ſent to ſee how Lippa was victualled, munitioned, and fortified) arriued with newes of the taking of Themeſuar. Themeſuar taken by Mahomer.
               
The loſſe whereof made euery one very grieuous and heauie, as well for the loue and regard they bore to thoſe valiant and excellent ſouldiours  who were within, as alſo for that it vntimely happened by the negligent gouernment of the Captaines. Vpon this griefe of minde, Caſtalde did indifferently comfort himſelfe, vnderſtanding that Aldene ſhewed himſelfe to haue good courage valiantly to defend Lippa, and that the ſouldiours deſired nothing more, then that the Baſha would come and ſalute them, that they might make him vnderſtand what their valour and courage was, and the deſire they had to winne honor and renowne againſt him, and that they were all reſolued to dye within it, rather then to ſee themſelues brought to ſuch an end, as was happened to thoſe of Themeſuar: the loſſe whereof  I will here ſet downe.
            
               Loſonze being Commaunder within this towne, with ſuch a number of The deſcription of the ſiege of Themeſuar. men, as before is ſaid, and imploying himſelfe the beſt he could for the fortifying thereof: which for the contrarieties and hatreds, proceeding from the concurrence of qualities, and from ſome other precedent cauſe, could not be ſo well munitioned as it was neceſſarie; for that Aldene (for the foreſaid occaſion) had conuerted all the money to the affayres of Lippa, leauing this other Fortreſſe vnder the mercie and protection of Fortune. As one day at the riſing of the Sunne he walked about the towne to viſit it, Mahomet (the 24. of Iuly, which was dedicated to the feaſt of S. Iohn Baptiſt) then preſented  himſelfe with his Vauntgard, which was 15000. horſe, conducted by Caſſombaſſa. He preſently cauſed to take notice of the ſituation of the towne, wherein was built fiue Bulwarkes of earth, ſome whereof were alreadie mounted to the heigth of the wall, but that which was lower was raiſed no higher then the length of an Halbert and a halfe: and of all theſe there were two very defencible, and the other were but in a meane. There was with Mahomet the Belerbey of Greece, who was greatly practiſed and perfect in that countrie. As they were thus arriued within the ſight of Themeſuar, he ſaid to Mahomet; behold a part of the towne, the Spanyards who are within will ſhew you the reſt: and marching about it, Alphonſe Perez de Saianedra 
                preſently ſallied forth with 400. horſe, and 100. Spaniſh Haquebuziers, and began to skirmiſh with the Turkes, entertaining them vntill they themſelues were forced to retire. Vpon the 27. day following, all the Campe arriued with ſo great cryes, neighing of horſes, clattering of armour, ſounding of Drummes and Trumpets, that it ſeemed the world would haue turned topſie turuie, and preſented themſelues before our people in ſtrong and fearfull ſquadrons, with great ſtore of Artillerie: whereof thoſe within ſeemed to make little account of, but receiuing them with a bloodie ſallie, they gaue them ſufficient notice of the little eſteeme they conceiued of their proud and contemptuous puiſſance: but for all this their gallant reſolution, Mahomet deſiſted not to incampe, lodging his people round about the towne, and  ſo ſtraightly enuironing it, that not a man could enter in, to their reliefe, but onely by certaine mariſhes, where it could not ſo well be beſieged, but that our people might enter in thereby. Vpon their approaching our people oppoſed themſelues with a gallant reſolution, and for the ſpace of ſixe daies

they made continuall ſallies vpon the enemie, not without great effuſion of  blood, during which time they aſſured the Suburbes. But in the end Mahomet vrged them hard, and cauſed thirtie great peeces of Artillerie, and many other leſſer, to batter the defences, and made three batteries, one againſt the Caſtle, another againſt the towne-gate, which was not walled, and the third againſt the Bulwarke: which for that it was of leaſt ſtrength, was defended by the Spanyards. They in this ſort battered the towne eight whole daies, and not any of the beſieged making ſigne of faintnes, and ſo long vntill they appertly ſawe the great ruine which the Artillerie had made, and that the towne in many parts was as it were all open, and that they had loſt many a braue ſouldiour in two aſſaults which the Turkes had giuen  them, of whom were remaining within the Ditch more then two thouſand, and many wounded. Lonſonze knowing then they could not long hold out, and that all the towne was ſorely bruſed and battered by the Cannon, and that a good part of the Bulwarks, which maintained and defended the wall, were beaten to the ground, called to him all the Captaines, imparting to them the daunger wherein they were, and how within a ſhort time they were likely to fall vnder the edge of the ſword, or mercie of the enemies. And he told them, that before Mahomet had paſſed Danubius, the Vayuod of the Tranſalpinians on his part wrote to him, that the Campe had not come into thoſe quarters, if Ferdinand had meant to haue payed Solyman the tribute, which Peter Vicchy was wont yeerely to pay him for the Countie of  Themeſuar; to whom he would giue no anſwer, nor aduertiſe Caſtalde thereof, he beleeuing they were deuiſes and brauadoes of the Baſha, as he was accuſtomed to doe, thinking with himſelfe that he would not come thither with ſo great force, to content himſelfe with that which another declared vnto him. But ſeeing himſelfe deceiued in his opinion, and conſidering vnder what a miſerable condition they were like to fall into, if the batterie continued, he ſaid to them: that he was of opinion, they ſhould ſend to the Baſha to obtaine truce of him for foure daies, during which time they might aduertiſe Caſtalde of all the accidents, and ſolicite him to conſent to pay the  yeerely tribute to the Turke, vpon condition he would raiſe his Campe and retire: and ſo by that meanes happely they ſhould giue remedie to their diſtreſſed fortunes. This aduice was approued by ſome, and refuted by many others, as vſually it happeneth in councels, where is daily ſeene ſome contrarieties among opinions, in reſpect of the reaſons and arguments which are alleadged either of the one part or other: in regard whereof, they could determine nothing that day.
            The 3. of Iuly the Baſha on the Caſtle ſide and towards the towne-gate, cauſed to be giuen an hot and fierce aſſault, which endured foure long houres, with the death of more then 1500. of the aſſailants, and about ſome  150. of thoſe within. In this aſſault Loſonze with the other Spaniſh and Germane Captaines valiantly defended themſelues, and forced the enemies to retire to their Tents. After this retraict, and that all our people were dreſſed of their wounds, and ſomewhat refreſhed, all the Captaines were againe aſſembled in councell to determine vpon the foreſaid buſines, and then there

were more then before of Loſonzes opinion. Thus he perceiuing many to be of his minde, without expecting any more, ſent by a truſtie meſſenger to acquaint  the Baſha with his intention: to whom he returned anſwer, that the Tranſalpinian had truly managed and conferred of this buſines by his commaund: but he ſhould haue conceiued, that this accord ſhould haue been accepted of, before hee had aſſembled his armie, and paſſed Danubius and Tibiſcus, and not at this preſent, he being now in the field and incamped before the towne: in conſideration whereof, he would not that this expedition ſhould haue any more reſpite, nor otherwiſe conſent to raiſe the ſiege, nor depart from thence before he were maſter of the towne and Caſtle.
            
               Loſonze vnderſtanding this anſwer, and perceiuing no meanes of agreement,  not willing to ſubmit himſelfe to the diſcretion and mercie of the Baſha, ſet vp his reſt to fight it out to the laſt man. Whereupon the Turkes began to renew the batterie more fiercely then before, without any intermiſſion of daily aſſaults, and to doe the worſt they could: and thinking that the great quantity of Artillerie which they had was not ſufficient to ſatisfie their miſerable crueltie, one night they put into the Ditch more then 2000. Pyoners, who began to myne the Bulwarke which the Spanyards kept, which was in ſuch ſort indamaged and impayred, that one might eaſily mount to the top of it by the ruines: for that all the defences and flankes which might annoy and withſtand them, were all broken and throwne to the ground.  The Spanyards ſeeing this imminent daunger, &amp; to giue redreſſe thereunto, with all ſpeede they made within the ſaid Bulwarke a Caue ſufficiently large and deepe, in which they erected certaine defences, where in euery one of them eight Harquebuziers might be commodiouſly placed, without being impeached or indangered by the enemie. Theſe (whileſt that the Pyoners were moſt buſie in their labour, and euen as they were readie to giue fire) began ſo effectually to diſcharge their ſhot amongſt theſe Deluers, that it was a marueilous thing to behold, they falling one vpon another in ſuch heapes, that the dead bodies hindered the reſt of the liuing, in regard whereof they were forced to giue ouer the worke and be packing, without daring once to  returne thither againe. Inſomuch that the Turkes ſeeing this deuice of the Chriſtians, and that by this meanes they could not come to the concluſion of their intended purpoſe, gaue that ouer, and purſued another; daily ſounding them by promiſes, aſſurances, and perſwaſions, that it were beſt to yeeld to them. But ſeeing in the end they could not bring them to yeeld, neither by letters, nor by gifts, nor by any other great offers, and that all their labours were to ſmall purpoſe, they made vpon the Caſtle ſide two great Caualliars of Carpenters worke, in bignes tenne fadome, as any man would iudge, and brought and ſet them right ouer againſt the Bulwarke where the Spanyards were caued: vpon which they mounted certaine peeces of Artillerie, by reaſon whereof not any could be in ſafetie vpon the ſaid Bulwark, nor remaine  vpon the defences, inſomuch that the Spanyards were conſtrained to retire from one place to another, ſecretly to make Trenches and certaine Rampiers to couer themſelues withall, when they ſhould defend the towne, which Don Gaſper Caſteluio ſlaine. then was very open. Don Gaſper at this inſtant was ſlaine with a ſmall ſhot,

which ſtrooke him in the forehead and pearced him quite through, and ſo  hotly did they ſhoot and neerely marked our men, that there were few Spanyards, Germanes, and Hungars left: yet neuertheleſſe thoſe which remained loſt not any courage, but reſolutely defended themſelues, as though they had been a great number. But the Turkes for all their brauerie ſlacked not their endeuours to enter into the towne, and our men did no leſſe then gallantly oppoſe themſelues for the defence thereof. Thus both the one and the other tooke greater heede to themſelues, continually indamaging one the other with diuers conflicts. But Mahomet diſtruſting himſelfe, that he was not able to conquer this towne by force of armes, determined one day to haue ſome ſpeech with Loſonze, and to ſeeke him out to parley with him,  that ſo he might perſwade him to ſome compoſition, which Loſonze meant not to refuſe: but the others not willing to conſent thereto, were the cauſe that of the ſaid conference proceeded no effect at that time. The Turkes neuertheleſſe ceaſed not from daily aſſaults, which they alwaies renewed with greater force then before, hauing no want of able men more freſh and luſtie then our people were, of whom they had few ſound amongſt them, &amp; many cruelly wounded; and ſpecially by meanes of thoſe two miſchieuous engins which they had made, who alſo cauſed more to bee made like vnto them, in place where our Bulwarkes and walles were, by the violence of their Artillerie ruinated: and the rather they were incouraged, becauſe that victuals and munition greatly abounded in their Campe, whereas our men daily wanted  all: as it often happeneth after a long and tedious ſiege.
            The Baſha wearie (as I well beleeue) to ſee ſo great a ſlaughter of his people, and that he muſt fight ſo continually, earneſtly deſiring that our people would yeeld themſelues to him, practiſed this deuice following. The day before, Ottomiall was defeated with his 400. Aiduchs, which hee brought with him to put into Themeſuar (as is aforeſaid) and they were by a ſtrong ſquadron of Turkiſh Caualarie alſo cut in peeces, that not any one man of them eſcaped, the fight being perceiued by the Sentinels of the towne. The day following this ouerthrow, the Baſha for the foreſaid reaſons, the more  to amaze and terrifie our people, cauſed 100. of theſe Aiduchs heads to bee moſt vily deformed, and to be ſet about the walles, with inſcriptions that ſignified, thoſe were the ſuccours which came to them, and that they ſhould not hope of any other, for that they would vſe the like to al thoſe who would attempt to come. Preſently vpon this ſauage deuice, certaine of the towne came forth, and beholding this horrible ſpectacle, and ſeeing that their preſent affayres were in deſperate tearmes, had an apprehenſion of feare to fall into the like miſerable end, as theſe poore Aiduchs were. The night following two Spanyards came foorth, one whereof had his wife and children at The treaſon of two Spanyards. Conſtantinople, where he was maried, after that he was taken at Caſtelnouo  and had denied his faith: and the other was a Moreſque borne in Granado. Theſe halfepeny fellowes hauing but faint hearts (by reaſon of the feare which doth ordinarily raigne in ſuch baſe perſons) louing rather to preſerue their liues with a ſhamefull and miſerable ſeruitude, then to loſe it vnder an honeſt libertie, with a glorious death (as it is the guiſe of valiant and

magnanimious mindes, to finiſh their daies with the loſſe of their deareſt blood) they went to the Baſha, and acquainted him with the whole eſtate of  Themeſuar, aſſuring him there were few men within it, and that their courages were cooled; and although they fought valiantly, yet were they greatly aſtoniſhed, and that the towne was in diuers places ſo open, that it was impoſſible they could longer maintaine it, if they continued the ſiege and their aſſaults, but that they muſt of force yeeld. This aduertiſement gaue ſome courage and hope to the Baſha to winne this place, although he had commaundement from the Grand Seigniour to withdraw his Campe from thence to Belgrade, ſeeing it was ſo long in taking, and that he had loſt ſo many men before it: whereupon it was ſaid, that Solyman was ſomewhat incenſed  againſt Mahomet: which if thoſe within had had but ſome inckling thereof, and had been able to maintaine it ſixe daies longer at the moſt, they had neuer taſted of this aduerſe fortune, which within few daies after happened to them with ſo great effuſion of blood, and the Baſha had retired with his armie, as it was afterward certainly knowne. But Loſonze ſeeing that Mahomet obſtinately perſeuered to moleſt him day and night, conferred with all the ſouldiours to yeeld; conſidering how they were all greatly wearied and timerous, by reaſon of the laſt aſſault which they receiued ſince the departure of the two Spanyards (who were fled from thence): during which, towards the Caſtle ſide they ſaw themſelues in very great danger, the Turks  being entered in, who had poſſeſt and made themſelues maſters of that place, if certaine Spanyards and Germanes had not preſently been ſent to ſuccour that breach, who vpon their arriuall forſt them to retire, and purſued them euen to the entrie of their Trenches, making a great ſlaughter amongſt them. Which being vnderſtood by all the nations there, euery man fauoured Loſonzes opinion to yeeld, his life, armes, and baggage ſaued, except the Spanyards, who ſaid; that according to their iudgement, they ought not to ſeeke for any accord, but to be well aduiſed how they might eſcape in the night by the mariſhes adioynant to the Caſtle, which if they could paſſe, they ſhould preſently finde woods which would procure them ſafe paſſage  vnto Lippa, and that there was not any who could hinder or annoy them from going foorth, and from arriuing at that place: and this ſhould bee ſo much the more eaſily performed, becauſe that towards that ſide there was not any perſon lodged, by reaſon of the great mariſhes which were in that place, which was a thing they might eaſily compaſſe, and which was farre better for them, then to repoſe any truſt in the Turkes faithleſſe promiſes, euery one knowing by too many preſidents, that very ſeldome or neuer they obſerue or keepe them, which aſſuredly they will now much leſſe performe, for that they will remember that our people halted in their promiſes to Oliman when he departed out of Lippa, this act being not any thing  concealed from the Baſha, nor yet ſlipped from his memorie, whereof they thought good to aduertiſe them, whereby they ſhould be the leſſe deceiued and ouerthrowne. Loſonze anſwered them, that they ſhould not any thing doubt, but that they ſhould giue him leaue to proceede therein; and that he would ſo order the matter, that his compoſition ſhould bee ſo cleere and

euident, that euery one ſhould ſecurely depart with his honour: which was  liked of many, ſaying, that 27. whole daies they had couragiouſly fought, and were continually annoyed by the Artillerie, and receiued ſo many aſſaults, and ſlaine ſo many Turkes, that they might well with their great honour and commendation yeeld. Vpon this reſolution, Loſonze made ſigne againe vnto the Turks that he would parley with them, and tolde them that Loſonze capitulateth. he was content to yeeld the towne, and that he would ſend a ſouldiour and an Hungarian to treate with them of an agreement. Mahomet was very glad to heare of this, for that he greatly diſtruſted his owne power, and was alreadie reſolued not any more to thruſt his men to the imminent daunger of ſlaughter, but rather to truſſe vp his baggage and depart: and by them he returned  anſwer to Loſonze, that he would ſincerely from point to point obſerue whatſoeuer he would demaund of him, and he ſent them back againe apparelled in certaine long ſilke robes after the Turkiſh manner, which was by theſe ſouldiours taken for a good ſigne, with which they were ſent backe, ſo deceiuing themſelues, as it is incident vnto men to abuſe and flatter themſelues in their proper and particular affayres, oftentimes thinking that in their buſineſſes all things ſhould wiſhedly ſucceede: yea, and ſo much doe they blind themſelues, that they cannot diſcerne the euill which often doth befall them, for want of due conſideration. Theſe ſouldiours being returned into the towne, they openly recited the large promiſes and fayre offers  that the Baſha had made them. Loſonze too lightly giuing credence therevnto, writ in a paper all the conditions which he eſteemed to bee either neceſſarie or meete for him to demaund; which were theſe.
            1 That it ſhould be permitted him to carrie away all the Artillerie which was within Themeſuar, and ſafely to conduct it, without any impeachment, The Articles of agreement. to the place he thought good.
            2 That all the ſouldiours ſhould goe forth with their armes, and Enſignes diſplayed, with all their baggage, and that the Baſha ſhould giue them ſafe conduct to ſome ſecure place.
            3 That the towne ſhould be held in ſome regard, and that there ſhould  not any of the inhabitants bee moleſted: and to conclude, as well in comming forth, as in going on their iourney, there ſhould not any bee annoyed or indangered by his armie.
            All theſe articles were very willingly accepted of by the Baſha, and accorded by oth to bee ſincerely performed, and returned them to them againe ſigned and ſealed, without contradicting any of the demaunds of Loſonze, eſteeming (as he that was determined to obſerue neither faith nor promiſe) theſe couenants of ſmall validitie, and to promiſe and deceiue of one conſequence. Now theſe negotiations being diſpatched, and agreements concluded, the 24. of Iuly, being the vigill of S. Iames, two daies after, about eight Loſonze leaueth Themeſuar to the Turkes. 
                of the clocke in the morning, they began to ſet forward their baggage and Artillerie, and Loſonze followed after with all the Caualarie, among which marched the remnant of the Infantrie which was left, marching all in battaile with their armes and Enſignes diſplayed. In their comming forth, they perceiued two great ſquadrons of horſe &amp; foot, amounting to ſome 50000.

keeping and ſtopping the way where they ſhould paſſe, which was a little hill on both ſides. The Spaniards who marched laſt, perceuing ſo many men  in their way, and conceiuing hardly thereof, preſaged what was like preſently to befall them: whereupon they ſent to tell Loſonze that they would not forſake the towne, except the Baſha would cauſe thoſe ſquadrons to retyre out of their way: whereof the Baſha being aduertiſed, anſwered them, that vpon paine of his head they might ſecurely come forth, without receiuing any preiudice, and that he ſent theſe troupes into that place to no other end, but onely that his ſouldiours ſeeing them goe forth of the towne, they might by them take example vpon the like and future occaſion, to carrie themſelues valiantly, conſidering that ſo few men had ſo wonderfull well  defended themſelues againſt ſuch an infinite multitude; and ſeeing they all profeſſed armes, &amp; were men that liued by war, it was neceſſarie they ſhould be inſtructed therein, according as occaſion ſerued. Vnder the protection of this aſſurance they all came forth, and began to march through the midſt of theſe ſquadrons, being diſtant from the towne ſome 300. paces, which they had no ſooner performed, but the treacherous ſignall was giuen with an harquebuze ſhot, as Mahomet had appoynted. At the report whereof one Loſonze and all his people ouerthrowne. part of theſe ſquadrons preſently enuironed the Artillerie and thoſe who marched before, and the other part enuironed the reſt, and ſo compaſſing thus our people in the midſt of them, they began to execute their barbarous  tyrannie in maſſacring them, and ſpecially thoſe who offered to defend themſelues, and who loued rather a famous libertie, honorably to dye fighting, then to remaine ſlaues during their liues, vnder ſo wicked a nation. Of this number were the moſt part Spanyards, and ſome Hungars, and Germanes, and thoſe who would not defend themſelues were preſently forced away and lead priſoners, and among others Loſonze was taken and conducted to the Baſha. In this maſſacre there happened an accident which I will 
                  Loſonze taken.
                  A ſtrange accident.
                recite, although it ſeemeth fabulous, and worthier to be regiſtred in the bookes of Romancers, then in a true hiſtorie, being ſo incredible that a ſole man could make paſſage and eſcape through ſo many thouſands of men:  and yet neuertheleſſe it was a true thing.
            As the Turkes attempted to hewe our men in peeces, and to perfourme that, they began their accuſtomed high clamors. Captaine Alphonſe Perez de Saianedra a ſtrong and able man, being mounted vpon a good horſe, tooke preſently his ſword in his hand, and at the firſt bruite and clamour of the enemies he thruſt in among them, and with maine force he made himſelfe place and way through the midſt of the throng: and as ſome were buſied in the ſlaughter of the other, he ſaued himſelfe without touch of wound, running towards Lippa, being well armed and mounted vpon a horſe, which ran exceedingly ſwift. The Turkes ſeeing that one man alone had thus ſtoutely made himſelfe paſſage and was ſaued, paſſing in deſpight  through ſo many horſes, being incenſed with ſhame and anger, there purſued him more then 500. and although their horſes were no leſſe ſwifter to run, than his, yet neuer could they once come neere him. But in an ill houre as this Captaine was in his ſpeedie courſe (almoſt out of danger) hauing little

               Castalde hauing ſpeedie newes of this loſſe, preſently departed with great  iournies, to be more neere, and to prouide that the reſt might be better defended and kept. He perceiued by the way that all the Hungarian Knights and nobilitie, who then followed him, were very penſiue and diſmayed, inſomuch that leauing all at randome, to the pleaſure of Fortune, they ſeemed careleſſe of any thing: whereupon turning himſelfe towards them, he modeſtly reproued them with ſuch milde ſpeeches as he thought good, and gaue them ſome heart and hope that this loſſe ſhould ſhortly be recouered by Ferdinands power (which daily was expected) &amp; by their own force and vertue, exhorting them to defend the reſt: hee ſo effectually perſwaded them, that he expelled from them all feare &amp; diſpaire, and cauſed to increaſe  in them courage and boldnes, and to thinke more vpon the reuenging of Loſonzes death, and the death of his Captaines and ſouldiours, then euer they had done. But Fortune (which is not alwaies permanent, but at her pleaſure cutteth off the deſſignes of men in the moſt flouriſhing time of their Aprill, and doth raiſe and abate humane actons as ſeemeth good to her) would that Aldene ſhould not perſeuer long in this his braue reſolution, in which vntill then he was reſolute in the defence of Lippa, againſt any ſtrong and puiſſant armie whatſoeuer, the ſame being vnto Ferdinand of as great importance as the loſſe of an armie or kingdome, as we ſhall hereafter further ſpeake of.
            During the time that Mahomet beſieged Themeſuar, and that he was vpon The carleſnes of Aldene. 
                the point to capitulate with Loſonze, Aldene perhaps thinking that this towne would neuer be taken, was nothing prouident to vſe that diligence which was requiſite for the due of his charge, neither yet did he imploy any ſpies to aduertiſe him: and now foure of fiue dayes were alreadie paſt, Spies neceſſarie. that he knew nothing of the enemies proceedings, neither had he any other newes then by the Rhatians or others, who by chaunce brought him a certaine Turke priſoner, who imparted to him as much as he deſired: and when a Captaine of the Vſſarons, named Demetre Vzarenky, exhorted him to vſe greater diligence, and tolde him that he would accomodate him with ſuch perſons that ſhould faithfully ſerue him in ſuch affayres: he made ſleight regard  thereof, neither did he endeauour himſelfe to retaine them with giftes or rewards, nor yet ſo much as with any good words, ſo that the affayres of Lippa daily proceeded from euill to worſe. In the end newes being come that Themeſuar was reduced vnder the Turkes commaund, and of all other occurrances which paſſed there; Aldene thought that Mahomets campe The cowardlines of Aldene. would preſently viſite him, and thinking that the Caſtle was not ſo ſtrong, as gladly he would haue had it, to reſiſt his victorious enemie, and ſeeing the occaſion conformable to his conceite; and perſwading himſelfe that the little hope which he had to defend himſelfe (both by reaſon of the weakenes of the towne, and alſo of the Caſtle) would be a ſufficient excuſe to diſcharge  him of ſo vile and infamous a thing as this which he pretended to doe, he reſolued in himſelfe to leaue it. And to the end the Turkes ſhould not ayde themſelues by the Caſtle, he determined to fire it with all the Artillerie and munition, without acquainting any therewith, but onely at the

inſtant when he would execute his enterpriſe, (as he did) although he ſaw  not the Baſhaes campe approaching, and notwithſtanding that ſome tolde him that Mahomet ſhould ſtay, that ſince Themeſuar was ſo tedious to him, (although it was a place of no great ſtrength) he would not now march towards Lippa, aſſuring himſelfe that he ſhould doe no good there, knowing the exceeding diligence and care which had been vſed to fortifie it, and the reſolute ſouldiours of all nations which was within it, and the quantitie of Artillerie and munition that Caſtalde had cauſed it to bee furniſhed withall, and the great care which he had for the defence thereof: for all which reaſons duly conſidered, he was in deſpayre that he ſhould neuer be able to take it. This report neuertheleſſe could not any thing diuert Aldene from his  wicked reſolution, although he well perceiued that Iohn Turky and Bartholmew Coruatte made not any ſemblance to bouge from that place where they were, which was an Abbey of Monks, ſituated three miles from the enemie, where (during the ſiege of Themeſuar) they daily with 1000. horſe annoyed and endamaged the enemie as much as was poſſible for them. Which to him who had no eyes, it muſt needes ſerue for a ſufficient argument to make him diſcerne, that the Baſha was not determined to come againſt him: for that alſo ſome of our people, who were lodged foure or ſixe miles off, neuer once offered to remoue or retire, hourely expecting what the Baſha determined to doe. Notwithſtanding all that, Aldene ſtill perſeuered in his infamous and ſhamefull fantaſie. And as puiſſance and rule cannot long continue where  feare and cowardiſe preuaileth, ſixe houres before hee meant to depart, he declared his conceit to certaine old Spanyards, who greatly blamed this aduice, telling him that in no caſe he ſhould not remoue or diſioyne himſelfe from thence, before they ſaw whether the Baſha would come or no, and that he ſhould duly conſider in what eſteeme he ſhould bee, if hee forſooke this place (at the leaſt before he ſaw the enemie) which was recommended to him, in regard of ſpeciall truſt repoſed in his worthines; and that if in this he would not haue reſpect to his owne reputation and honour, yet at the leaſt he ſhould haue regard to the credit of his nation; and that ſith neuer any  Spanyard, vntill now, had committed ſo cowardly an act, that he would not be the firſt, into whoſe hart ſhould fall an infamie ſo ſhamefull and villanous, which aſſuredly would equally redound vpon all, and ſpecially in ſuch a place, where honour ſhould more preuaile, then any fearefull deſire which was in him, in reſpect from being noted of puſillanimitie and cowardiſe among theſe barbarous nations, with a perpetuall and infamous blot. But theſe admonitions were not ſufficient to withdraw him from his baſe determination: but continuing therein, other ſouldiours had notice thereof; and among others, Captaine Paul of Zaraz, a Germane Colonell, who went to ſee Aldene, deſiring leaue that he might enter into the Caſtle with his ſouldiours, and other Spanyards, who were more deſirous of glorie then  of life, and that he might cauſe all neceſſaries to bee put therein before the bridges, which were made for the bringing in of prouiſion needfull for the Rampiers, ſhould bee broken. Aldene anſwered him, that he ſhould enter therein when time ſhould require. The ſouldiours ſeeing this diſorder, began

to murmur, and ſay, that before they entered they would know what  quantitie of victuals there was within. The next day in the morning, they intreated him to goe vnto the ſouldiours (and as their Chiefe) to appeaſe them, and to take an oth of euery one of them to liue and die in the ſeruice of God and Ferdinand, as by dutie they were all bound thereunto; and neuer to depart from Lippa, before the Turkes were gone from thence. Which being done, and the oth taken, certaine ſouldiours entered into the Caſtle to ſuruey the munition and victuall, whereof was found good ſtore: by reaſon of which they were incouraged, and they againe redoubled the ſaid oth, and after that, euery man retired to his lodging, where they were not long, but that they vnderſtood the commaund that Aldene (the Camp-maſter) cauſed to be publiſhed: which was, that euery one ſhould be readie with his armes,  and prepare himſelfe to march. Whereupon all the nations who were in the towne began to ſet forward, not without ſome little mutinie, and Captaine Paul of Zaraz went againe to Aldene, to diſſwade him from the performance of ſuch a diſhonourable fact, telling him, that neither he, nor none of his did euer thinke to commit ſuch a miſchieuous treaſon againſt Ferdinand, and that if he would needs goe, he might, but as for himſelfe he would with his people defend the Caſtle againſt Mahomet, or elſe he would there end his daies. All the Hungars aſſured him alſo that they would doe the like. To whom he anſwered, that they vnderſtood him not, and that he well knew what he meant to do, and that the King ſhould receiue more ſeruice by that  which he had determined to do, then by all yt which they had propounded. Vpon this the Spaniſh ſouldiours began to bee of diuers factions and opinions among themſelues, the greateſt part eſteeming it a foule fault to diſlodge themſelues from thence, as Aldene had commaunded; and the fewer ſort were of opinion to doe that which he determined, perſwading the other to take part and goe with them, and not remaine to caſt away themſelues: which the Germanes and Hungars by no meanes thought conuenient, and gaue notice thereof to Aldene, who ſaid to them, that he knew not what to doe therein, but hee would thinke thereon, and prouide for it. Now, there  was about Lippa ſome 10000. Hungariſh and Rhatian waggons, within which they carried their wiues, children, and their beſt moueables, theſe being fled after this manner from their townes and houſes, then when the Baſha paſſed Tibiſcus, and were come thither to ſaue themſelues in Tranſiluania, and by the fauour of this ſtrong place, beneath which they were lodged in a champion vnder their Tents and Pauillions in manner of an armie, expecting the iſſue of Themeſuar. The principall of them vnderſtanding that Aldene would forſake this towne, and remoue with his people from thence, went preſently to him, to deſire him not to depart, and importuned him, that if hee were reſolued to forſake the Caſtle, yet that hee would not  race it, but rather deliuer it into their cuſtodie, and that they would with their beſt endeuour defend it, or elſe reſolutely to die within it. But all theſe intreaties, admonitions, and proteſtations had not any force to remoue him from his diſhoneſt thought, but commaunded that all ſhould bee in a readines to march at the firſt ſound. The Germanes and Hungars perceiuing

the wicked and baſe intent of Aldene continued, ſaid to him, that although  there were many inclined to obey him, yet they would not for all that ceaſe from giuing him to vnderſtand, that they determined to remaine and defend it, that ſo they might ſhunne and auoyde the ſhame, which without all doubt they ſhould condignely receiue in diſlodging ſo vily: whereupon Paul of Zaraz reenforcing the guards, tooke charge of the towne, through which walking in the night ſeaſon, he ſaw many ſouldiours (who by Aldenes oppointment were with their horſes ſadled) readie to troupe on with their armes and baggage, to whom giuing incouragement, and perſwading them not to bouge, hee went from thence to Aldenes lodging, whom hee found vpon his bed, and conferring with him, he deſired to know why he  had commaunded that the Spanyards ſhould be in ſuch readines. For that, (ſaid he) he had receiued newes that the enemies were alreadie approached within two miles of Lippa, with fifteene peeces of Artillerie, and that vpon this occaſion he was reſolued, that he would not at any hand attend them, becauſe the place was not ſtrong enough, he hauing before hand concluded preſently to depart. To which, Paul replied, that he would ſtay, but vntill he had ſent to know the certaintie thereof. And he did ſo much, that three houres before day hee preſently diſpatched two horſemen towards Themeſuar, to diſcouer whether the Vauntgard of Mahomet approached or not. Theſe ſouldiours poſting with good ſpeede, arriued at the place where were lodged Iohn Turky and Bartholmew Coruatte, and ſeeing them to  be at quiet, and not fearing any trouble of the enemies, they returned backe againe with great ſpeede, to declare vnto Aldene that there was not any bruite or newes that the Baſhaes Campe was riſen from about Themeſuar.
            During the time that theſe two horſemen made this diſcouerie, Aldene cauſed all the Canoniers to come to him, commaunding them to charge the Cannons euen to the mouth, with intent to breake them, and that they ſhould put the reſt of the powder into the vautes and ſellers of the towers and Bulwarkes, to blow them vp when neede ſhould require: and being afterwards  to expect the returne of theſe two ſouldiours, who ſhould bring certaine newes of all, a Sentinell (which was in the top of one of the towers at Sunne riſing) diſcouered two horſemen who came ſpurring on amaine. Theſe were the two ſouldiours, which we haue before ſpoken of, who rode in great poſt, thinking that if they deferred any time, Aldene would ſet fire on the Caſtle before they returned againe: and on the contrarie, the certaine newes which they ſhould bring, would expell this wicked determination out of his cowardly mind, and this was the cauſe of their ſpeed. Another Sentinell at the ſame inſtant, being not farre from the other, diſcouered a farre off a great duſt in the ayre, which was raiſed by a number of Cowes,  which ranne wildly together in the fields without any keeper, and theſe two ſouldiours were neere the towne, crying with a loude voyce (although they could not perfectly be vnderſtood) and ſaid, that they ſhould make ſtay, and not fire the munition nor Caſtle. The other ſouldiours crying (by the aduertiſement of the Sentinell) that this duſt was raiſed by ſome great battalion Baſe mindes ſuſpitious of feare.
               
of the enemies, and that theſe two ſouldiours came poſting before to giue notice thereof: they went preſently to aduertiſe Aldene, who was the  
               Lippa forſaken and burned by Aldene. firſt that mounted vpon a good horſe, and ſent to Captaine Paul of Zaraz, that he ſhould open the towne-gate, and let the waggons forth that were full of his moueables, and of certaine Marchants. It being opened, the Spaniards began ſoftly to march, euery man ranging himſelfe vnder his Colours, and preſently vpon it he commaunded the Canoniers to giue fire to the Caſtle, and to all the Artillerie: wherein they vſed ſuch haſte, that giuing fire to the vaults of the towers, two among them (blinded with feare and ſmoke) remained vnder it burnt and conſumed. By the violence of this fire, two great towers (which were at the enterance of the Caſtle) were blowne vp into the  ayre, and there were fiue or ſixe peeces of Artillerie which were diſcharged againſt the walles, being laden euen to the mouth, and the Caſtle began to burne on all parts, and in like ſort the towne, which cauſed a mournfull pitie among all thoſe nations, who not without iuſt cauſe cōplained for ſuch a loſſe, worthily blaming ſo vile an act, inueighing with great bitternes againſt the Spanyards and Germanes, deeply curſing Caſtalde that had placed them there, not knowing now where to diſpoſe or turne themſelues, or what might betide them by this lamentable inconuenience, they being with great cries and laments diſ-vnited and ſeuered from thence, and with the greateſt confuſion and diſcontent that could be, they began to lode their waggons  with their wiues and children, and of thoſe commodities which they had then with them, and to proceede on their iourney whither Fortune would guide them; and endeuouring to ſaue themſelues, ſome went to one place, and others to another, and Aldene leauing Lippa behinde him (which miſerably burned like a ſecond Troy) tooke his way with his ſouldiours towards Tranſiluania, marching with ſo great ſpeede, that not any taried to expect his companion; euery one ſpeedily labouring for his owne ſafetie, and amongſt them he was eſteemed to be moſt valiant and ſure, who better then the other could nimbly vſe his legges, and their iourney was no leſſe diſordered, then their departure was inconſideratiue, and in ſuch ſort it was performed,  that the peaſants, who inhabited among the mountaines, for the diſpight which they had of ſo foule and execrable a fault, tooke courage to aſſaile and kill many of them, and to rob many Marchants of Lippa: ſo that they were in a manner all loſt and periſhed, ſome remaining dead, others wounded and ſore hurt: and this happened to them in reuenge of the ruine and loſſe of Lippa.
            
               Bortholmew Gornatte (who as we haue ſaid) was foure miles from Lippa, ſeeing the great fire which (as he thought) proceeded from this towne, was greatly aſtoniſhed at the ſight thereof, not being able to imagine what it could be, rather ſuſpecting ſome other caſualtie, then that which happened to be true: and preſently mounting on horſebacke, ſpurred on to the place  from whence this flame came; and arriuing neere to Lippa, hee could not conceiue what the occaſion ſhould be of the burning thereof; and not able to thinke who ſhould be he that had cauſed ſo great a loſſe, nor by what peruerſe accident it ſhould happen, he vehemently miſtruſted ſome treaſon,

by meanes whereof he thought Aldene with all his ſouldiours might haue been  conſumed in that fire. And demaunding of ſome that went wandring about the towne, who had comitted ſo vile an acte, they preſently made relation to him of the whole matter as it was done, which he vnderſtanding, and not minding (as a wiſe and prouident Captaine) to neglect any thing which ſhould concerne the ſeruice of his Prince, and the noblenes of his owne minde, without being conſtrained by any commaund, but moued onely by a true compaſſion for ſuch an vnſpeakeable calamitie and ſuddaine ruine, began in the beſt ſort hee could to giue order to cauſe to be retyred that Artillerie which remained whole from the violence of the fire, ſeeing he could not remedie any other thing, for that all was fallen to a marueilous  ruine. He remained within Lippa three dayes, and vntill he had ſeene all the Artillerie (which was diſperſed in the towne that remained whole, to the number of fifteene peeces) conducted in ſafetie, of which there were ſome ſound, and many broken and crakt, and with thoſe and all his people he retyred to Iula, firſt cauſing fire to be ſet in euery place of the towne that remained vnburnt, to the end that the enemy might not in any ſort reliue himſelfe tierewith. Which being done, he preſently gaue aduertiſement thereof to Caſtalde, who alreadie vnderſtood of this miſerable ruine, which was exceeding diſpleaſant to the armie, and to all Tranſiluania, and ſpecially to the Spanyards, whoſe reputation it touched more then any other, conſidering  that he was a Spanyard which committed ſo infamous and diſhonourable a thing; in regard whereof, they were alwaies held in contempt, and derided by all the nations of that Prouince, they being not able to alleadge any colourable reaſon for their excuſe, which procured great diſcontent and irkſomenes to Caſtalde, for that he repoſed all his hope vpon this Fortreſſe; thinking, that in well defending it, all the Baſhaes force would not haue been ſufficient to haue wonne thereof one thumbes bredth of ground. And although he eſteemed the kingdome, together with his armie and reputation to bee in a manner loſt, yet was he not troubled, nor made any ſemblance of feare in his heart of ſo great a loſſe: and although the cowardiſe of another had thus euerted his deſeignes, and that ſudden and raſh attempts commonly  bring more trouble and amaze, then thoſe which are foreſeene by an aduiſed conſideration; yet neuertheleſſe hee did not omit to aduertiſe Ferdinand of all theſe accidents, and preſent daunger wherein he was, for that the Port of the countrie being by the careleſnes of another opened to the enemie, to enter into that countrie, he being not able to withſtand him, without another armie anſwerable to that of Mahomets, or at the leaſt halfe as ſtrong. In like ſort he gaue aduertiſement to Roderic Vigliandrando, and to Andrew Lopez, that they ſhould march no further, becauſe (as is aboue ſaid) they were ſent, who by ſome meanes or other they might enter into Themeſuar;  and he commaunded Captaine Lopez to enter with his companie into the Caſtle of Deua, which next vnto Lippa was the ſtrongeſt Fortreſſe in that quarter, and of the moſt importance for the enterance into the kingdome; Deua. commaunding in like manner Aldene, that he ſhould remaine in that towne with the companies which he brought from Lippa, and that vntill he

knew further of his pleaſure. The towne of Deua is very fayre and rich,  and ſituated in a place which participateth of a plaine and hill, hauing a Caſtle of good defence, neere vnto which, a few yeeres paſt, was found (by ſuch meanes as we ſhall ſpeake of) great ſtore of treaſure by the peaſants of the countrie, vnder an old ancient Caſtle or Palace all ruinated and decaied. The raine continuing a long time, and the water running in great abundance with a forcible currant, by violence thereof there was diſcouered an infinit companie of golden Meddals, vpon one ſide of which was coyned the image of Lyſimachus, and on the other ſide a victorie, euery one weighing Money of Lyſimachus. two or three crownes. The ſtorme and rage of the water being paſt, and the Sunne ſhining vpon theſe, they made a marueilous gliſtering: which being  perceiued by certaine peaſants of the countrie, and they running to ſee what it might bee, they remained rauiſhed with ioy, conſidering ſo great a quantitie of the golden Meddals, and offering to take them vp, they alſo Treaſure found. found a golden Serpent, which afterward Caſtalde ſent to Ferdinand, hauing had it at the death of Frier George, with a part of theſe ancient Meddals: this being an ancient cuſtome amongſt thoſe who buried their treaſure, to place Serpents there, in token of a faithfull keeper. And after that theſe peaſants A cuſtome of the Ancients. had taken no man knew what, others tooke from thence more then twentie thouſand Duckets, and the report was, that they might haue taken more then 100000. for that this place had ſometimes been Lyſimachus aboade: whereof Ferdinand had (as wee haue ſaid) 1000. and Caſtalde about  300. which coyne remained in this place from Lyſimachus his time. Among other notable antiquities that was found, there were two Meddals of gold, the one was of Ninus, and the other of Queene Semiramis: which two were Meddals of Ninus and Semiramis. ſent to the Emperour Charles the 5. And there was not any man in all that Prouince, of what authoritie or reputation ſoeuer, which had not ſome of theſe Meddals: ſo infinit was found this ſumme to be.
            Now, Caſtalde hauing taken order for the moſt important affayres of the kingdome, he went from thence with the Vayuode of Tranſiluania to Segheſuar, from whence afterwards he went to Saſſebeſſa. And being there arriued, he lodged in the beſt manner he could within the towne, it being ſeated  in the midſt of the countrie, where he haſtened the fortifications of thoſe townes which were alreadie begun to be fortified, and into which places he determined to place garriſons, to defend them againſt the Baſha, knowing he had not the force to incounter him in the field, and writ againe to all the townes that they ſhould ſend him more ſouldiours, certifying them of the bad fortune which was lately happened to the low countries: and although they ceaſed not to ſend vnto him, yet could they neuer leauie but 16000. men.
            In this time arriued 1500. men of armes, which Ferdinand had promiſed to Caſtalde, 1000. whereof were vnder the conduct of Fabian Schinach, and  the other 500. remained with the Marqueſſe Sforce Palauicin, who brought with him 3000. Germanes, and as many Italians, with certaine troupes of Hungariſh horſemen, and ſome Artillerie, to ſuccour Caſtalde, and marched with great iourneys, hauing alreadie paſſed Papau, which is a Fortreſſe vpon Papau.
               
the confines of Hungarie, neere to Veſprimia, and he marched very ſpeedily.  There is found vpon the way (which is neereſt out of Hungarie into Tranſiluania) a Caſtle named Drigal, ſituated iuſt in the way, which then Drigal. was kept by the Turkes, ſo that they could not conueniently paſſe that way, which was farre better, and the ſureſt to conduct an armie into the countrie. Whereupon to finde ſome meanes to winne this Fort, Ferdinand commanded the Marqueſſe Sforce, that arriuing neere vnto the ſaid Caſtle, he ſhould with all his power make ſome ſtay there, and endeuour himſelfe by all meanes poſſible to get it. Which Caſtalde vnderſtanding, and knowing by many reports the ſtrength of that place, by reaſon of the few men the Marqueſſe had with him, he writ preſently vnto him, that he ſhould not at that  time ſtay about that enterpriſe, vntill they were vnited together, becauſe that they two ioyning in one, happely they might attempt ſome fortunate ſucceſſe: which on the contrarie they could not poſſibly obtaine, if they were ſeparated: for that one was not ſufficient to make that conqueſt, but their vnion was likely to bee the cauſe of ſome good euent, and the time ſhould not be loſt in vaine (as it might happen) if he himſelfe would onely bee opinionated to ſtay there, with daunger to loſe it. Beſides, aduertiſing him, that if in caſe he would perſiſt in this enterpriſe, and that he ſaw the Baſha of Buda attempted to ſuccour that Caſtle, yet by no meanes he ſhould fight, for feare of loſing the battaile: but that he ſhould endeuour himſelfe to retire the beſt he could, it being now no time to hazard his men, ſeeing he very  well knew the great and preſent neceſſitie which himſelfe had thereof. He alſo writ to Ferdinand concerning the ſame, deſiring him that hee would cauſe Palauicin to depart from Drigal, and that hee would commaund him preſently to march and ioyne with him, it being more neceſſarie then the taking of this Caſtle. This reaſon although in it ſelfe it was ſound and true, yet was it not ſo apprehended by Ferdinand, nor receiued by ſuch due obedience of the Marqueſſe: ſo that, for not inclining to this counſell, he fell into ſuch calamitie, as we ſhall hereafter ſpeake of.
            
               Mahomet (who had not the heart to goe to beſiege Lippa) knowing it  was very ſtrong, and that the garriſon was of Spanyards, Germanes, and Hungars, all choſen and approued ſouldiours, hauing at this inſtant had newes, that the maſter of the Campe (Aldene) had forſaken it, and ſet fire on the Caſtle; and not beleeuing that a Spanyard would commit ſuch an indignitie, and ſo vnfit for him, ſent (the ſame day that Bartholmew Coruatte had drawne out the Artillerie) to know the certaintie. The Turkes who went thither, approached ſo neere vnto it, that they perceiued that the towne and The Turkes ſeazed on Lippa. Caſtle had not receiued very great damage, and they began as well as they could to quench the fire, and preſently aduertiſed the Baſha that this fire had procured no great detriment to that which was newly fortified, and that although  the Caſtle was broken and rift in many places, the Bulwarkes and Curtaines neuertheleſſe were ſound and whole, and very defencible: onely that there was two old towers fallen downe, but not any thing of that ruinated which was fortified within, and that the Caſtle it ſelfe might eaſily be reduced into his former ſtrength, and made ſufficient to defend it ſelfe. The

Baſha vpon this aduertiſement was ſo well content, as if he had conquered the moitie of Tranſiluania, and preſently diſpatched Caſſombaſſa with 5000.  horſe to goe and enter into Lippa and defend it. Preſently vpon this Captaines arriuall there, he commaunded certaine Turkes to goe and view Solimos, thinking for certaine that he ſhould ſpend more time in taking of it, Solimos left to the Turks. then he did, and that it might proue ſo ill an neighbour to him, that he ſhuld ſcarcely hold Lippa in peace, becauſe that although that Caſtle was very little, yet it was inexpugnable: for that it could neither bee battered by the Cannon, nor yet aſſaulted: and there was within the ſaid Caſtle a Corporall of Aldenes ſquadron with 25. Spaniards, and about ſome 100. Hungars, which number was ſufficient to defend it againſt all the world, they hauing victuals  for two yeeres, and of Artillerie and munition as much as ſhould ſuffice them. But feare had alreadie poſſeſt euery mans heart, inſomuch that newes being come that Caſſombaſſa was within Lippa, the Corporall fearing the enemie would come directly to the Caſtle, did reſolue to leaue it to the hazard of fortune, thinking that the former fault of others would excuſe him from the reproach of any diſhonourable act: vpon which reſolution, he perſwaded all the ſouldiours who were within to depart, who alreadie were ſo diſcouraged for the paſſed accidents, and for the faint-heart which they perceiued in him who commaunded them, that they were preſently induced (without any vrgent perſwaſions) to credit his ſayings: and began to goe  forth at the inſtant, when Caſſombaſſa had ſent 200. horſe to ſummon them to yeeld: who being arriued before the Caſtle, and finding it open (although The cowardlines of the Spaniſh ſouldiours. they ſuſpected ſome deceit) yet they boldly entered in, and without any reſiſtance made themſelues maſters thereof: and conſidering that the garriſon could not be farre off, vnderſtanding that the night before they were within, preſently they ſet themſelues forward to follow them: and they had not gone farre, but that they ouertooke, and ſo intrapped them with ſuch an aſſault, as wolues commonly giue to amazed ſheepe being in flight, and put them all to the ſword, except the Corporall, whom they led priſoner to Caſſombaſſa: and thus was the deſert of their ſhamefull cowardiſe duly rewarded,  yea euen at the time when ſeeking their owne ſafetie, they then found death: which then had not ended their daies, if they had remained within the Caſtle, and valiantly employed themſelues for the defence therof, which men expect for at the hands of reſolute ſouldiours: for thus in keeping Solimos, they might thereby with good ſecuritie haue defended Lippa.
            
               Caſtalde at that time alwaies remained about Saſſebeſſa, with that ſmall force which wee haue ſpoken of, daily expecting the arriuall of the Marqueſſe Sforce, and aſſuredly beleeuing that the Baſha would not omit to attempt the enterance into the kingdome (and that ſo much the more boldly, becauſe he ſaw himſelf Lord, without any impeachment of the place, which  he eſteemed of moſt importance) he was attentiue to ſee what he would determine of, becauſe that vntill then he could neuer vnderſtand the drift of his intention, but onely then when he was at Themeſuar, he heard that hee durſt not enter into Tranſiluania, becauſe it was reported that Caſtalde was therein with a good number of men, and that daily he expected more, and

that if he ſhould then enter there, he could not ſo eaſily retire himſelfe as he  would. This opinion of the Baſha was grounded vpon certaine policies and ſtratagems, which Caſtalde, Andrew Battor, and Thomas Nadaſily had vntill that time vſed, deceiuing thereby his Spies, cauſing his people daily to bee newly muſtered, and ſtretching their ſquadrons at length, to the end that they might ſeeme double as great as they were, adding thereto very great The policie of warre. Salues of the Artillerie and Harquebuziers, hauing cauſed their Campe to be largely lodged, to the end that it ſhould ſeeme greater then it was; further reporting that daily they expected ayde, and that Duke Mauris would ſhortly arriue with 20000. men, and Ferdinand in perſon with a great armie. By ſuch and other like inuentions, Caſtalde greatly helped himſelfe in the neceſſitie  wherein he then was, ſupplying therein by his owne induſtrie, that which he knew was wanting, by reaſon of the ſmalnes of his armie; and not being able therewith to reſiſt the power of the Baſha, he endeuoured to oppoſe himſelfe againſt him, and to delude them by the ſubtelie of his fained ſhewes; which Mahomet ſuppoſing to be true, was in doubt what to doe. But at the laſt Caſtalde hauing vnderſtood, that one day he would vpon a ſudden enter into Tranſiluania, and ſend the Belerbey of Greece before with 25000. horſe, to giue remedie to that, leauing the Vayuode Battor, with all his ſouldious of the kingdome in the ſame place, to the end he ſhould maintaine the reputation of a Campe; and to the end alſo that that might alwaies appeare to bee true which the Spies reported to Mahomet, who vntill  then (in regard of the report, as we haue declared before) had put him into ſome feare and doubt, he departed with his Infantrie and men of armes, with this reſolute determination, to meete the Belerbey, and to fight with him: and although it ſeemed an expreſſe raſhnes, yet leauing the iſſue thereof in the hand of God, he was not any whit amazed or diſcouraged, but determined reſolutely, either to ouerthrow the Belerbey, (and by that meanes to giue iuſt occaſion to Mahomet; not to attempt any more the enterance into the kingdome) or elſe gloriouſly there to end his happie daies. For that if it happened that vnfortunately he ſhould loſe this battaile, yet for all that he would not cenſure himſelf to be vtterly ſubuerted, but as fierce as at the firſt,  becauſe hee ſhould leaue behinde him another armie, anſwerable vnto that which he met the Turkes withall.
            As theſe things were thus a brewing, he went to take view of a lodging between Deua and Saſſebeſſa, which he found very conuenient for his purpoſe, and commodious to fortifie with great aduantage for the ſafetie of his Infantrie, which he might well accommodate and lodge vpon certaine little pleaſant hils, which would be as a Caualliar againſt the Belerbeys horſe, and afterwards appointed a garriſon at Deua, wherein he placed Counte Helfeſtin, and two Spaniſh companies, with Vayuode Battors Caualarie, to the  end that as occaſion ſerued, they ſhould make in vpon the Rereward and flanks, he being with his men of armes ſo well accommodated, that he might well offend and annoy the enemie, without any detriment to himſelfe. But all theſe inuentions and troubleſome conceits, which daily hammered in Castaldes braine, proceeding rather by neceſſitie then of free will, tooke no

effect, for that the Baſha altering his determination, reſolued of ſome other courſe, and went towards Hungarie, he being aduiſed, that if he tooke the  ſtrong places thereof, Tranſiluania would then bee wonne with leſſe paine and daunger, and without hazarding his armie, as then hee ſhould hazard them, if he entered into that Prouince. And truly it was a work of God, that the Baſha remained ſo blinded, and that he could not diſcerne ſo eaſie a way to conquer that countrie, becauſe that Caſtalde not being of ſufficient force to maintaine the field, it was neceſſary for him to retire his forces into ſtrong holds, conſidering that all the gathering together of the powers which they could make out of all the countries of the kingdome, was not ſuch as they might affront this barbarous tyrant: and yet though it had been ſufficient  to incounter him withall, yet for all that they knew not how, neither at the enterance, nor at the retraict of the enemies Campe, to auoyde in that countrie very great deſolation and ruine, which as well by reaſon of the one as of the other ſhould haue happened, and ſpecially if ſuch an armie had made long aboade therein, it being compoſed of more then 90000. men, beſides aduenturers, and other ſtraglers, who to rob and ſteale doe vſually follow a Campe.
            Whileſt that Mahomet was determined to enter into Hungarie, and that Drigal beſieged by the Palauicin. the Caſtle of Drigal was now beſieged, and ſorely battered by the Marqueſſe Sforce, and Eraſmus Teifel, contratie to the liking of Caſtalde (as is aforeſaid)  and being not yet taken, Achineth (Baſha of Buda) vnderſtanding of this violent battering, and that this ſiege was maintained againſt the aduice and liking of Caſtalde, he determined to relieue the aſſieged, and commaunding that all the Caualarie (which were vpon the frontiers) ſhould make their Rendevous in a place by him appointed, who in the end were 15000. horſe, with whom he marched towards our people, and at the dawning of the day he arriued neere to the Marqueſſe his Campe, ſending before 500. horſe to giue the alarme, and he with the reſt of his troupe paſſed towards another ſide of the Caſtle, not being perceiued of any, to giue in vpon the Rereward of our men, if they would offer to come out of their Trenches to fight with  thoſe who ſhould giue the alarme. At the ſight of theſe 500. horſe, our men began to make ſome ſallies and charges vpon them, and by little and little the alarme waxed ſo warme, that the greateſt part of our people, either by neceſſitie or deſire to fight, went out of their Trenches, and ranging themſelues in battaile, they ſo fiercely charged the Turkes, that they ſlew moſt of them, and put the reſt to a ſpeedie flight, ouerthrowing many in the purſuite. And as it often happeneth, our ſouldiours thinking by the defeate of theſe few men they had the victorie aſſured in their owne hands, not foreſeeing what might happen, they began to disband themſelues and purſue the Turks, one getting a horſe, another ſpoyling the dead; when to this medley the Baſha  
               The Palauicin defeated by Achmeth, the Baſha of Buda. (after that he ſaw the occaſion to be ſuch as he deſired) came with ſuch great furie and rage, that our people could not really themſelues, nor reſiſt ſo violent a charge, as well for that they were in diſorder, as alſo becauſe they ſaw themſelues out and farre from their Trenches, which might haue warranted them from this crueltie. The Germanes of Eraſmus Teifel, who made the

battalion, and were about 3000. were ſo at an inſtant ouerthrowne, as if lions  had entered into a parke of ſheepe. The Marqueſſe Sforce, who was armed before the battalion of the Italians, ſeeing that our Caualarie and men of armes were all fled, and that alſo all the Germanes were defeated, and that on that ſide all was loſt and ouerthrowne; like a prouident Captaine would not indanger the reſt of his men, but would haue conducted them into ſome ſecure place, and cauſed them to take a wood which was there by, hoping by that meanes to ſaue them, his enterpriſe was by the Baſha ouerthrowne, who cut off his way, and forced him in ſpight of his teeth to fight. Who ſeeing he could not remedie it, he in the beſt manner he could ordered his people in battaile, and incouraging the Captaines, and the Captaines the ſouldiours,  as a valiant and reſolute Leader he placed himſelfe in the moſt daungerous place, and began the fight, which ſcarcely was begun, but his men (by reaſon of the multitude of the enemies horſe) were ſo diſordered, that by no meanes they could not any more reunite themſelues to fight, but tooke ſo deſperate a flight, as though their onely ſafetie had conſiſted therein, notwithſtanding the menaces and intreaties of the Marqueſſe did no good, and many Captaines (forgetting all ſhame) leauing their companies fighting on foote vnder their Enſignes, mounted vpon the firſt horſes which by chance they found before them, (as there were many in the field disfurniſhed of their maſters) and therewith leauing their ſouldiours as a pray, they did in ſuch ſort flie, that there were ſome of them that neuer looked backe nor  ſtayed, before they arriued at Vienna. The Marqueſſe Sforce ſeeing himſelfe thus alone and forſaken of his people, although he had as good meanes to ſaue himſelfe as others had, yet hauing a generous and a noble minde, did rather chuſe to dye there with honour and glorie, then in flying to ſaue himſelfe with ſhame and infamie. Wherefore ſeeing hee could not eſcape this certaine daunger, he determined to ſell his life to the Turkes as deare as he could, and valiantly fighting he would neuer yeeld, although in many places he was very ſore wounded, killing and hurting many of thoſe who enuironed him: and as he was in reaching at the necke of one, another hurt him in the right hand, ſo that he was forced to let his ſword fall, and ſo conſequently  his courage decreaſed, that he was forced rather to yeeld his bodie, then his minde. He being thus taken priſoner, hee was preſently led to the The Palauicin taken. Baſha, not without the great admiration of all thoſe who had ſeene him fight ſo brauely, being much aſtoniſhed at his valour and proweſſe, which moſt reſolutely they had ſeene him performe, not being vntill then euer knowne to bee Generall, but onely for a man of ſome good reſpect and authoritie, and for ſuch an one he was held by the Baſha. As ſoone as Eraſmus was taken, and knowne to bee a man of no ſmall qualitie, hee was preſently ſent to Conſtantinople, where at his arriuall he had his head cut off. There  dyed in this ouerthrow many perſons of marke, and among others the Biſhop of Vaccia, who was Comiſſarie generall, and many other Germane Captaines. The priſoners were Hyppolitus Palauicin, Captaine Albert de Caſtello, a Boulonian, Captaine Bambino de Carpi, Captaine Maria de Tiuoli, Captaine Vincent Antiuory, a Florentine: and of the reſt which fled I will not

make any mention of, in regard they deſerue not commendations. 
            
            After this route, the Baſha at pleaſure relieued thoſe of Drigal, and hauing effected this vnfortunate iourney, which happened the 8. day of Auguſt, anno 1552. he ſent to Buda all the pray and ſpoyle which he had gotten, and returned Anno 1552. another way to ioyne with Mahomet, who had willed him to come, that he might diſcourſe with him vpon that which he deſired to doe againſt Hungarie, for that Achmeth had the more knowledge in the diſcouery &amp; paſſages of that countrie. Caſtalde in the meane time hourely receiued news, touching ſome bad chance (becauſe he was not beleeued) of the ſuccours which he expected in this great neceſſitie wherein he was: &amp; during certaine daies, he aſſuredly beleeued that the Marqueſſe Sforce was ſlaine in battaile, but afterwards  he knew that he was liuing, and vnder the Baſha of Buda his command, The Palauicin ranſomed for 15000. Duckets. frō whō certaine moneths after he was ranſomed for 15000. Duckets.
            Now Achmeth being come to Mahomet, (who was determining to march into Hungarie, but yet with a colde reſolution, conſidering with himſelfe that this yeare he had performed ſufficiently in conquering of Lippa and Themeſuar) he exhorted and perſwaded him earneſtly to follow on his firſt determination, with a reſolution of conqueſt, promiſing him within few dayes to render the Caſtle of Zaluoch and the towne of Agria to him, poſſeſſing him that the greateſt part of the townes of that Prouince would aſſuredly yeelde to him, in reſpect of the feare which was bruited in them, by the taking of the foreſaid townes, and by the ouerthrowe of Palauicin, and  that by this meanes he ſhould get infinite renowne and glorie, and ſuch as he could not hope for, and that to that purpoſe he ſhould be now incited, for that he ſaw Ferdinand buſied in the Germane affayres, and oppreſſed by many reuolutions and garboyles, and by the loſſe of men and horſes, which he apparantly ſaw was happened to him, and which he could not preſently renew, being in extreame neceſſitie and want of money: ſo that by theſe incommodities which he knew to be moſt true, he had now all the meanes that might bee to make himſelfe Lord of many townes, without any impeachment or danger to him, and to leade away infinite priſoners, and get ineſtimable bootie. Mahomet greatly incouraged by ſuch hopes, preſently  tooke the way to Zaluoch with all his armie, marching with tedious iournies. This Caſtle is very ſtrong, and about ſome three yeares paſt it was reared Zaluoch beſieged by Mahomet. and built by Ferdinand from the ground, in reſpect of the commoditie of the place, which by cauſe of the naturall ſituation, and by the ſhoares and bankes of Tibiſcus, ſeemed as though it had been erected by hand. Ferdinand the rather was incited hereunto, becauſe he knew that Solyman ment to poſſeſſe himſelfe of that place for the ſame purpoſe, and for the fertillitie and pleaſure of the countrie. And thus he preuenting the determination of his enemie, firſt poſſeſſed himſelfe on this ſeate, and eſteeming it worthie of a  Fortreſſe, procured with great diligence to builde that Caſtle, which certainely was eſteemed inuincible, and one of the faireſt workes that was in that kingdome, hauing about it fiue great Caualliars very high, watered on the one ſide by Tibiſcus, and on another ſide enuironed with another riuer named Zagiua, and in two other places there was a ditch very deepe which

was filled with water from thoſe two riuers; and there was within it a large  place to range or embattaile fortie thouſand men: to be ſhort, this place was reputed one of the ſtrongeſt Forts that was in all Hungarie, and ſuch a one Ferdinand did eſteeme it, and alwaies maintained therein a ſtrong garriſon of men, Artillerie, victuals, and all ſorts of munition for ten yeares. To anſwer which with like correſpondence, if it had then been as well furniſhed of reſolute ſouldiours, as it was well munitioned of other things, it ſhould not haue come to ſuch an vnfortunate end as it receiued, by the cowardiſe of thoſe who were in garriſon there. Beſides theſe aforeſaid preparations, Ferdinand had cauſed there to be kept 50. long narrow boates, with which they might vpon thoſe riuers fiſh and fight if occaſion ſerued; and within he had cauſed  to be placed at that time for an ordinarie garriſon 300. Germans beſides their Captaine who was abſent, 100. Bohemians, 200. Aiduchs, and 50. Spanyards, beſides 200. Hungariſh horſe, who in all amounted to 850. men.
            
               Castalde vnderſtanding that Mahomet marched towards Hungarie, certainely perſwaded himſelfe (as afterward was ſeene) that if then he retyred from Themeſuar, he ſhould not haue the like occaſion and commoditie to enter into Tranſiluaniaas he had: and although he was glad to ſee him out of this Prouince, yet was he greatly perplexed in his minde, fearing that he would march directly towards Agria, becauſe that that was a towne of little ſtrength, but yet of great importance: notwithſtanding he had a ſpecial hope  of this, that Mahomet would firſt (before he came to Agria) make ſome ſtay before Zaluoch, for that he would not leaue it behinde him; and he thought that this Caſtle would defend it ſelfe from his crueltie, becauſe it was ſo well munitioned, &amp; impregnable: ſo that he aſſured himſelfe that Mahamet ſhould conſume the greateſt part of his forces during the ſiege there, &amp; that if thoſe within it would ſhew their vttermoſt deuoire, he ſhould be forced rather to retire with ſhame and loſſe, then remaine there with profit and honour.
            Before that Mahomet approached Zaluoch, he ſent 2000. horſe to ſcoure and diſcouer the plaine, and gather what victuals they could for his armie, which ſtoode in ſome diſtreſſe, for that they had paſſed ruinated and diſpeopled  Countries, from whence to auoide his tyrannie, all the people were fled into diuers places of ſafetie. Some of his Vaun-currers preſenting themſelues before Zaluoch, and being knowne to be ſuch as they were, our people ſallyed forth to skirmiſh with them, and tooke ſome of them who were ſcattered from their companie, by whom they vnderſtoode that Mahomet would preſently come and beſiege them with all his armie. It happened the ſame day, that the Turkes Vauntgard arriued, a certaine Germane bruſing in his lodging a little powder, fire tooke holde thereof and burnt the houſe, and almoſt all the Caſtle, becauſe that the flame being carried with the winde (which then was very great) diſperſed it ſelfe into all parts, and  ſuddainely flamed, for the greateſt part thereof being built of wood, and filled with ſuch other things which drew fire to it from a farre, and if they had not with great expedition ſlaked it, ſurely all had been conſumed into aſhes: and euen as the Vauntgard wherein Achmeth Baſha was arriued, the fire was quenched, and then al thoſe within put themſelues in battaile and good order about the wals, and with the force of Artillerie &amp; Harquebuziers, they

began to ſalute the enemy with ſuch violence, that they brake that ſquadron, inſomuch that he was forced to retire from approaching any neerer: and  forthwith ſallying out, they made a great murder amōgſt the Turks. The day following arriued Mahomet himſelfe with all the reſt of his campe, lodging a good diſtance off, and in a place where the Artillerie could not offend him, and preſently with a ſtrong troupe of horſe he went to view the Caſtle on the two ſides that were not enuironed with water, but onely with drie Ditches, and the day following he cauſed all his armie to approach before that place, quartering them on theſe two ſides, and they were ſo many in number, that all the ground within that compaſſe was couered with them: and afterward he ſent by ſome of his people to certifie him who commaunded  within, that he ſhuld for certaine vnderſtand, that that place where the Caſtle was built, appertained to the Grand Seigniour, and that Ferdinand erected it in a place which was none of his: and for that cauſe he commaunded them to yeeld it vnto him, offering vpon that condition ſome reaſonable rewards, and that he would permit him, with all his ſouldiours, ſafely to depart with their armes and baggage; further admoniſhing him not to be obſtinate, leaſt he ſhould plant the Artillerie: for if he expected that, he had ſworne and proteſted not to make any accord with him at all, but the contrary, putting all to fire and ſword, he would without mercie murther all thoſe who fell into his hands. The Caſtellan made him this anſwer, that being borne Ferdinands 
                ſubiect, and by him placed in this Caſtle, and hauing ſworne to him fidelitie, and giuen him aſſurance to keepe and defend it (which alſo he purpoſed to doe) he could not yeeld it to him: but if he would be maſter thereof he ſhould winne it by force, and that he ſhould not ſolicite him any more with the like friuolous meſſages, for that he had no dread nor feare of his words, and as little eſteemed he of his deedes, but that he ſhould doe his vttermoſt, and he for his part would alſo doe what he could to defend and maintain it, deſiring rather to die Ferdinands ſeruant, thē liue Solymans friend.
            The Baſha vnderſtanding of this reſolute anſwer, the day following he cauſed the Trenches to be made hard by the Ditches, on thoſe two ſides of  which we haue ſpoken, and that not without great labour, for that the Pyoners were forced to carrie the earth very farre, becauſe the place was drie and ſtonie, and very vnfit for ſuch a purpoſe. And after they had finiſhed their worke, one morning before day-break, he cauſed his Artillery to be brought into them, and planted it againſt the Caſtle, and began very violently to batter: but the Cannon did no great harme, for that the Caſtle was well rampierd and enuironed with earth and faggots, which preſently did quallifie the force of the bullet. About three daies after that the Turks had continued their batterie, the Germanes aſſembled together, &amp; ſpake vnto the Captaine The cowardlines of the Germane ſouldiours. of the Spaniards, and to certaine other ſouldiours, telling them, that the moſt part of the Hungars were alreadie on horſeback, and that when they thought  leaſt of it, they would in the night depart and forſake them, and that if they did ſo, euery one might cleerely diſcerne, that they were not of ſufficient ſtrength to maintaine and keep it againſt ſo great an armie, as was that of the Turks: and that for that cauſe this was their counſell, that all ſhould diſlodge and endeuour to ſaue themſelues, perſwading this Captaine to ſpeake of

this matter vnto him who commanded the place, and was the Caſtellan, who for that he was his friend would not refuſe to hearken to him, and it might  be would yeeld to his opinion. The Spaniards replied, that as yet they ſaw no occaſion that ſhould moue them to depart from thence ſo vily, and they told them that they ſhuld not vſe any more ſo diſhoneſt and infamous ſpeeches, but rather they ſhould haue the courage to die honourably, then commit ſo cowardly an act; and that for their parts they would doe that which ſhould ſeeme good to them, not being willing at any time to lend their eares to ſuch vnfitting diſcourſes. The Germanes then ſeeing that the Spaniards reſpected not their motion, went to the Bohemians to acquaint them with their determination, and there they cauſed it to finde ſuch good entertainment,  that they eaſily drew them to their opinions: whereupon they altogether went to the Caſtellan, to tell him in few words that they would depart, for that they ſaw the Hungars had truſſed vp their baggage in their wagons, and their horſes were readie ſadled, of which they knew not the meaning, except it were to begon, and leaue the reſt as a pray to the Turkes: for that if they departed, who were the greateſt and ſtrongeſt part, it was not in their power to warrant &amp; withſtand the aſſaults of Mahomet, and to defend themſelues againſt ſo puiſſant a force; in reſpect where of they thought it better to depart and retire in ſafetie, then to remaine in danger of ſo apparant a loſſe, which euery man might ſee readie to befall them with a cruell death. The Caſtellan willing to appeaſe them, told them that the Hungars had not loded  their baggage, neither were their horſes ſadled to any other end, but onely for feare of the fire, which in that extremitie they might more conueniently tranſport them from place to place, and that if they thought otherwiſe, they deceiued themſelues, and if they were of this opinion, hee himſelfe would be the firſt that ſhould burne their baggage, and maime all their horſes, and would cauſe that the Hungars ſhould euery one execute the like in his owne The braue reſolution of the Caſtellan of Zaluoch euen to the end. behalfe, promiſing to recompence them in the end according to their deſerts: and this he did to the end that they ſhould be the more willing to put fire thereto, aſſuring them, that before he would depart from this Caſtle, he was reſolued rather to die within it. The Germanes ſeeing that by this means  they could not compaſſe their drift, they preſently replied, that they would not remaine, except they might haue their pay which was due to them. The Caſtellan made liberall promiſe to them thereof, and ſounding the bottome of his friends purſes, he got ſo much money as was needfull to ſatisfie them all that was their due.
            In the meane time the Baſha ceaſed not from continuall battering: but it was to no great purpoſe, for that the Cannon did little good; in regard wherof our people in ſtead of taking courage, they hourely ſeemed faint-hearted and more diſcouraged: and this batterie hauing dured 8. whole daies, they determined one night ſecretly to depart, and by the meanes of boates to ſaue  themſelues on the other ſide of the riuer. Which the Spaniards perceiuing, they preſently aduertiſed the Caſtellan thereof, who told them, that he had cauſed the boates to be ſunck, for that they ſhould not haue that meanes to flie, they being not able to goe forth at any other place, becauſe the enemie had wholly enuironed them, who would hinder their paſſage; which they

found not true, and the Spaniards in the night time walking the round, about the Caſtle, and viſiting the Sentinels, ſaw the Germanes in armes with their  baggage readie to depart, and comming to the Port, they met the Hungars (who were all on horſebacke) and the Caſtellan that vrgently intreated them that they would not depart, and leaue this Fortreſſe with ſo great ſhame and infamie to their nation, and with ſo great a loſſe to K. Ferdinand: by which ſpeeches they in like manner ſaw that they preuailed not much with them, in their behalfe, for that they opening the Port by force, they all thruſt themſelues forth. The Turks who were for the watch within their Trenches, hearing firſt the bruite which was within the Caſtle, and preſently after hearing no more therof, and not perceiuing any ſigne or token of any watch (as they  vſually perceiued it euery night before) went preſently to breake open the Zaluoch cowardly left to the Turks. Port, which was oppoſit to that part which the Hungars &amp; Germanes went forth at: and entering in, and not finding any perſon, they greatly marueiled thereat, and looking about them, they found the Caſtellan alone by the Port, who begā to ſhut it after his people, not meaning at any hand to depart with them, but rather to remaine and die therein, or elſe to be made a ſlaue, before he would commit ſo ſhamefull and diſloyall a fact to his Prince. The Turks preſently tooke him priſoner, and hauing bound him, they led him to Achmeth, Baſha of Buda: who after he had vnderſtood how all things had paſſed, he ſhewed him great honor, and entreated him curteouſly, eſteeming it to be  a thing no leſſe vertuous to vſe clemencie towards his enemies, then kindnes to his friends; yea although a man hath power to ſuppreſſe or raiſe them vp, and ſpecially when it is in the behalfe of thoſe who haue not committed any diſhonourable or vnworthie act, but on the contrarie haue performed that which was agreeable to their honour and reputation.
            So ſoone as the Germanes were out, they went towards the boates, which becauſe they were halfe on land and halfe in the water, they found very farre ingaged, and before they had drawne them out of their Docks into the water, they ſo filled them with their implements and their own perſons, that they could by no meanes wagge them: and thus loſing the time (whileſt on  another ſide the Hungars ſaued themſelues in paſſing the riuer with their horſes at a foord) the Turks ſet vpon them as they were thus buſied, and put them all to the ſword, ſo that not a man eſcaped aliue. Whileſt that the Turks inflicted this puniſhment vpon theſe miſerable men (which they iuſtly deſerued) the Spaniards were almoſt al ſaued, ſome by water, &amp; others by land
            
               Mahomet hauing in this ſort won this Caſtle with leſſe paine and trauaile then he expected (not conquering it by force, but by the cowardiſe &amp; treacherie of the Germanes and Hungars who were there in garriſon, and who rather deſired to flie and forſake their King, then remaine fighting &amp; get hohonour and glorie, being well able to make reſiſtance without their loſſe or danger) repoſed himſelfe with his armie certaine daies in this place, and afterward  leauing in it a ſtrong garriſon, he tooke his way towards Agria, with intention to beſiege it, thinking that thoſe who were within, would doe as thoſe of Zaluoch and Lippa had done. But God as an enemie to thoſe who truſt more in their forces, then in his aſſiſtance, would that all whatſoeuer we eſteeme impregnable, ſhould be loſt: and againe, that all that which we think

vpon very good reaſon to be feeble and weake, forſaken of all helpe, and not  anything fortified by any humane induſtrie, ſhould gallantly maintaine and preſerue it ſelfe: as appeared by this towne which the Turks found ſo ſtrong, that they had iuſt cauſe to bewaile that they were ſo euilly intreated there, as if they had receiued ſome bloodie ouerthrow in open field; this being an incredible thing how this towne could preſerue it ſelfe, and ſo exceedingly endamage the enemie.
            The loſſe then of Zaluoch ingendered in Ferdinands campe a great admiration, and generally no leſſe aſtoniſhment to all, becauſe this was a place (as we haue ſaid) inuincible and impregnable, except by ſuch a manner wherewith it was loſt: and Castalde bare inwardly in his heart, in finit griefe and ſorrow  for it, although outwardly he inforced himſelfe to ſhew very exceeding valour; and knowing that amongſt humane actions there commeth not one miſchiefe alone, but that it is accompanied with another euen hard at the heeles, this being the qualitie of Fortune, neuer to begin her ſports for a little while, he diſtruſted that this diſgrace would be accompanied with another, and that ſo much the rather, becauſe he ſaw ſo puiſſant an enemie, readie not onely to the ruine and ſubuerſion of Tranſiluania and Hungarie, but alſo of all Chriſtendome; and he ſuppoſed that he had done no ſmall matter, if he could maintaine himſelfe in ſuch eſtate as then he tooke himſelfe to be in, hauing but weake force &amp; a very ſmal armie, which alſo then he could not pay, and daily ſeeing the Fortreſſes to be abandoned, &amp; moſt cowardly left in the  Turks power; and on the other ſide, continually perceiuing war to approach vpon him, and that euen by them from whom he hoped to find moſt fauour and ayd to maintaine Ferdinands part, and to aſſure theſe countries vnder his obeiſance, who on the contrarie wrought a dangerous reuolt, and ſecretly practiſed to depriue King Maximilian of al this prouince, to render it to King Iohns ſon, &amp; to reinueſt the Queene his mother into her firſt &amp; royall dignity, they being not able any longer to ſupport the wars, &amp; other inconueniences which daily afflicted thē, labouring with al their skill to effect their purpoſes.
            In reſpect of theſe vehement ſuſpitions, Caſtalde was in great vexation and heauines, fearing that that would ſhortly happen to him which he had alwaies  before ſuſpected, ſpecially becauſe he knew the nature of the Tranſiluanians to be much inclined to nouelties and alterations, and that more then any neighbour Prouince whatſoeuer; and that alreadie oftentimes the principall perſons among them, vnder the colour of diuers vrgent occaſions, retired into ſuch places, where they gaue more ſuſpition of reuolting, then aſſurance of true amitie; all this notwithſtanding he omitted not to conſult and deliberate with the Vayuode and others, touching all that which was neceſſarie, and to prouide for it accordingly, not minding that any fault ſhould be attributed to him by his negligence or indiſcretion, nor to be reproued for  that he had not as a skilfull Captaine foreſeene euery inconuenience; as he very wiſely managed matters, which thing hereafter we ſhall more amply treate of in his proper place.

               WHileſt Castalde was buſied to redreſſe theſe caſualties of  fortune which alreadie paſſed through the kingdome, and that Mahomet marched with his victorious armie towards Agria: Queene Izabella ſeeing that nothing Queene Izabella complaineth of Ferdinand. was performed of that which was promiſed her in the behalfe of Ferdinand, and that ſhe could draw nothing from them but words, being greatly offended thereat, complained of Ferdinand to the King of Polonia her brother, and to Queene Bonna her mother, of the wrong which ſhe receiued, and how by too credulent a beliefe ſhe was cunningly lifted out of her eſtate, and in this ſort deceiued and depriued of all humane helpe;  and alſo that they denied for wife to her ſonne, the Infanta Ioane, and the eſtates which was offered to her, and the payment and disburſing of her ioynter and dowrie. For which reſpects ſhe would not that the agreement and reſignation compacted about Tranſiluania, ſhould be any further proceeded in; ſaying, that ſhe was not bound to obſerue any condition with him,

who performed not any of his promiſes to her, and that it was reaſonable for  her to breake with him, that had ſo often failed with her. With this choller and griefe ſhe practiſed the meanes to ſet footing againe into this Prouince, and to draw the principalleſt States thereof to fauour the cauſe of her ſonne, minding to aſſiſt her ſelfe with the offers which Mirce (Vayuode of the Mirce, Vayuode of the Tranſalpiniās. Tranſalpinians) had made her, promiſing to ayde her both with men and money, and beſides to performe, what poſſibly he could, to reinueſt King Iohn into his former dignities. And before ſhe diſcouered any the leaſt inckling of her determination, ſhe had cauſed Solyman ſecretly to bee intreated, Izabella again ſeeketh the Turkes ayde. that it would pleaſe him to fauour her cauſe, inſinuating to him how great and vnfained had been the amitie and affection which King Iohn her deceaſed husband bore him, and the great confidence that after his death ſhe alwaies  had in him, and that he would vouchſafe not now to denie her his ayd in ſo great neceſſitie, which for the preſent ſhe was in, and eſpecially ſeeing ſhe was ſpoyled of all her goods, becauſe ſhe repoſed too great truſt in another: and that if for her ſake he would not doe any thing, yet that at the leaſt he would haue a princely regard of pitie to her ſonne Iohn, who was a child and orphane, and expulſed from his owne inheritance, whom ſhe committed into his armes, knowing that from the bountie of his princely diſpoſition, ſhe could not but hope of a remedie worthie of his excellent magnanimitie, there being not any thing more commendable among Princes and  Monarkes, then to defend the iuſt cauſes of afflicted widowes and poore orphanes, as ſhe and her ſonne were, in whoſe defence he ſhould greatly inrich his renowne with perpetuall glorie, and adde to thoſe his royall dignities, the ſurname of a pitifull and iuſt protector of thoſe, who vniuſtly are oppreſſed by the wickednes and intruſion of others: it being more expedient and behoouefull for his affayres, to haue them for his neighbours and confederates, then Ferdinand, from whom he could expect nothing elſe but continuall warre and perpetuall trouble.
            By theſe ſpeeches and other like reaſons which ſhe cauſed to be alleadged to him, ſhe (by the meanes and fauour of Achmeth Baſha) crept ſo into the fauour of Solymans liking, that preſently he writ to the Vayuode of Moldauia,  
               Stephen, Vayuoyde of Moldauia. named Stephen, that at all times, and as often as he ſhould bee requeſted by the Queene of Tranſiluania to ayde her, he ſhould not faile with the greateſt force he could make, to doe her all poſſible fauour: and the like he alſo commaunded to the Baſha of Buda.
            
               Caſtalde (during theſe practiſes) had alreadie intelligence how Chendy Ference 
               Vicchy and Chendy for Izabella. (one of the principall Peeres of the countrie) went often to viſit Peter Vicchy, who made his aboade in one of his Caſtles, ſituated in the confines of Polonia, and that they were accorded and vnited together, and that alreadie they had leauied forces, with intention to enter into the kingdome, and to reduce it vnder the Queenes command, alleadging for their reaſons,  that Ferdinand had obſerued nothing of that which was promiſed. Which truly they publiſhed, not ſo much for the intereſt &amp; fauour of the Queene, as to reuenge the death of Frier George, the which (and the authors thereof) Peter Vicchy thought much of, and meant to reuenge it vnder the fauour and

power of Chendy, who after the death of the ſaid Frier, was growne puiſſant  in that countrie. And being thus vnited together, and ſtrengthened with many gentlemen, who ſecretly retired to them, they purpoſed greatly to trouble the affayres of the kingdome, by reaſon of the ſuccours which they aſſuredly hoped from the Moldauian, who as yet had not diſmiſſed his armie, and who alwaies (by Mahomets commaund) entertained it in the field, concluding with him, that they would at one inſtant enter into this Prouince: further alſo that they had agreed with the Vayuode, that cauſing all the countrie to reuolt againſt Caſtalde, he ſhould with al the other ſouldiours which were then with him, aſſaile thoſe of Ferdinands part, and cut them in peeces in the ſame field where Caſtalde ſhould be incamped. But Caſtaldes diligent care and vigilancie, vaniſhed theſe deuices into ſmoake, ſo that this  conſpiracie could take no effect; and ſpecially becauſe of the death of the Vayuode, which happened in the wiſhedeſt time that could be deſired, the ſame being practiſed many daies before: and which was as here followeth.
            
               Caſtalde being at Segheſuar then, when he went againſt the Moldauian, there came to him at that time a Moldauian gentleman, a man of good The enterpriſe to kill the Vayuode of Moldauia. countenance, well graced, and full of diſcretion. This man withdrew himſelfe from Stephen the Vayuode, miſdoubting to bee ſlaine, in reſpect he greatly fauoured him who was the rightfull inheritour of this Prouince, which was by the ſaid Vayuode tyrannically vſurped. This gentleman  brought with him about ſome twentie horſe, with which hee offered his ſeruice to Ferdinand, whereupon he was receiued into pay: and theſe which ſerue in this manner, and with ſuch a number of men, are called in Moldauia, Bugerons. Within a while after this Bugeron found the meanes to haue Bugerons. long diſcourſe with Caſtalde, concerning his affayres, to whom making an ample recitall of his eſtate and qualitie, ſaid; that the Vayuode had not yet wholly diſſolued his Campe, and that he yet entertained the greateſt part thereof, vpon opinion once againe to enter into this kingdome, vpon any occaſion when he ſhould ſee it moſt incumbred and oppreſſed by the neceſſitie of warre; and that if he would promiſe him his fauour and aſſiſtance,  he would aduenture to kill him; with this condition neuertheleſſe, that if in caſe he performed it, that then he ſhould bee a Captaine of 200. horſe in Ferdinands pay. Vpon this offer Caſtalde made him liberall promiſe thereof, and more then he demaunded, aſſuring him that beſides his promiſe, he would beſtow in reward of him 1000. crownes, if he returned hauing performed this enterpriſe. The Bugeron nouriſhing himſelfe with this hope, returned into Moldauia, where he attempted many times to execute his enterpriſe: but yet could he not at that time attaine to the effect and iſſue thereof, for being diſcouered, hee was conſtrained to flie into Polonia, from  whence he writ to Caſtalde of all what had paſſed, and that if he would that this conſpiracie ſhould proceede, that then he ſhould write to two of the Vayuodes houſehold ſeruants, who were very familiar with him, without whoſe meanes this enterpriſe could hardly take any effect: and that the contents of the letters which they ſhould write vnto them, ſhould bee to

requeſt them to haſten and performe that which they promiſed to him, and  of which they talked together, and that if it ſucceeded well, he promiſed to giue them all which he had offered, and a larger recompence then they expected, and that they ſhould aſſure themſelues he would not any thing diſſemble or faile, in that whereof they ſhould haue need.
            This Bugeron meant that this letter ſhould be ſent ioyntly to them both, he practiſing by this policie to bring them in ſuſpition, (although indeede they were innocent thereof, neither were they imbrewed with any ſpot of this treaſon) and by this deuice to make them enemies to the Vayuode, and to incenſe them againſt him. This counſell was preſently practiſed, and that in ſuch ſort, that the Vayuode was as ſoone aduertiſed thereof, as Caſtalde 
                had written to theſe two familiar friends of his, who could not keepe cloſe this letter, becauſe it was deliuered to them in the preſence of many. It alſo happened that when this letter was brought them, they were (as fortune would) both together, and preſently opening and reading it together, and remaining (by reaſon of the contence and nouelties thereof) wonderfully aſtoniſhed; and ſo much the more, becauſe they vnderſtood not what the letter meant, as men that had not any correſpondence with him who wrote vnto them: and afterwards thinking with themſelues what this might meane, and holding this letter ſtill in their hands, by chaunce there was by them a young youth alied to the Vayuode, who for that he was young, they had not any ſuſpition of him. This youth hauing neuertheleſſe well vnderſtood  the ſumme of their conference, went preſently to the Vayuode, and in order recited to him what hee had heard and ſeene. Whereupon theſe two were preſently ſent for, and the Vayuode commaunding them to ſhew the letter that Caſtalde had writ to them, he interpreted it according to his owne minde; and ſo tooke them as traytors, and cauſed them preſently to bee depriued of all their honors and dignities which they had in his countrie, with reſolution to behead them, and wholly to extirpate their houſes and goods; that by the horrible example of theſe, it might bee a iuſt preſident for others hereafter to bee better aduiſed from attempting ſo miſchieuous and vile an  act.
            As the Vayuode was inquiſitiue about theſe practiſes, the Bugeron came from Polonia; and hauing vnderſtood that this letter of Caſtaldes had produced ſuch effect as hee deſired; and that thoſe to whom it was written were greatly incenſed againſt Stephen the Vayuode, becauſe that by him (beyond all limits of reaſon) they were very cruelly abuſed and falſely accuſed of treaſon; and that they could not tolerate this indignitie; and that they ſecretly conſpired a cruell reuenge thereof: and ſo knowing that the things would ſucceede according to his deſire, he meant not to omit this occaſion, which Fortune ſo fauourably offered to him, but willingly imbracing it, he ſpeedily writ to theſe two, that if they would ioyne with him to reuēge the wrongs  which were done them by the Vayuode, hee would gladly conſort with them, and eſpecially knowing betweene them how the other had moſt iniuriouſly wronged them, and with what crueltie hee had much perſecuted them euen to death: diſcouering to them, that it was farre more conuenient

to make him away by ſome deuice, then to looke for this that he ſhould take  away their liues. Theſe two greatly ioyed at this vnexpected offer, and determined to performe that vpon him, which vniuſtly he had impoſed vpon them, and to reuenge themſelues of the honours which were taken from them, and of the ſhame and obloquie, which vndeſeruedly they had receiued againſt all right and reaſon. Many of their friends and kinſemen (who thought not wel of that which was done againſt them) conſpired with them, as alſo many others who were kinſemen to him, who lawfully ſhould haue been Vayuode. Theſe altogether complotted with the Bugeron, concerning the meanes that ſhould be vſed to put their conſpiracie in execution: which was, that they ſhould ſuddenly aſſaile their enemie and kill him; as within  ſhort time they performed it, entering furiouſly one day into the Vayuods Tent, who was laid vpon his bed to repoſe himſelfe, imagining that neuer any durſt haue the face to offend or diſturbe him; they gaue him ſo many The Moldauian murdered. ſtabs with a poynard, that they cauſed him preſently to giue vp the ghoſt, and afterwards by the meanes of them that followed them, they ſet vpon 2000. Turks and Tartars, which he continually had for his guard, cutting and hewing them all in peeces, electing him for Vayuode, who indeed ſhould be he: which being performed, they conuerted their furie againſt the Tyrants kindred, killing his mother, children, and friends (as the manner is in that countrie) not leauing aliue any of the contrarie faction, from whom afterwards  they might haue any occaſion of miſtruſt.
            This death ſeemed to all very profitable, and ſpecially to the Tranſiluanians, who by meanes thereof ſaw themſelues deliuered from very great dread and feare of being at any other time aſſailed by him: and on the contrarie, they ſaw this new Vayuode to make ſome ſhew to imbrace the amitie and friendſhip of Ferdinand, which poſſeſſed them with a ſpeciall hope of a long and quiet repoſe. But all theſe vaine hopes in the end proued contrary, as wee ſhall more commodiouſly in another place ſpeake of: for that this new Vayuode of Moldauia did not long continue in this league, which he brake within a ſhort time after, that he might bee in the Turkes grace and fauour.  Alſo this death was the ſpeciall cauſe which hindered the conſpiracie that was wrought in Tranſiluania againſt Caſtalde; and alſo becauſe that at that time it came to be diſcouered, inſomuch that euery one knew all them that were actors therein, and who had promiſed him to enter thereinto: which made Peter Vicchy and Chendy to be greatly doubted, as all thoſe likewiſe who were compacted in this conſpiracie; of which number Caſtalde would not puniſh any therefore, knowing it was then no time, being on the one ſide withheld in regard of the feare and ſuſpition of the future warre: and on the other ſide ſeeing himſelfe more troubled then euer he was, by the vexations and diſcontents which his owne people hourely gaue him,  which farre exceeded thoſe that he receiued by the enemie. For the Germanes in reſpect they were not payed, committed the greateſt outrages that The Germanes muitnie. were poſſible, ranging and ſpoyling all the plaine countrie, killing the inhabitants of villages, and doing incredible things without any regard, committing vnworthie exceſſes, and ſuch as are vnfit for a Chriſtian, who is bound

rather to yeeld a rule and forme of an exemplarie and modeſt life, then of  wicked or infamous liuers, ſeeing that by the one they might gaine much, and by the other loſe infinitly. From theſe ſo execrable extortions, proceeded the ſpeciall cauſe that afterward incenſed all the inhabitants of the kingdome The Tranſiluanians begin to reuolt from Ferdinand. to reuolt, and ſpecially the Nobilitie, who ſeeing that their firſt enterpriſe taken in hand, vnder pretext of doing good, yet came to no effect, propounded one day before Caſtalde, that it was expedient (ſeeing they were all then in the field) to goe with all their people to beſiege Lippa, and vſe ſome ſtratagem or force to take it, it being reported that Caſſombaſſa had few men within it, hauing ſent from thence the greateſt part of the garriſon to Mahomet to the ſiege of Agria: importuning him that he would not omit this occaſion and commoditie, whileſt it ſhewed it ſelfe fauourable, fearing that  neuer after the time would bee ſo conuenient for ſuch an enterpriſe: all of them very willingly offering themſelues to this warre. They ſpake this with a diſſembling heart, to deuiſe ſome meanes to worke Ferdinands armie out of the kingdome, with an intent (they being once out) not to ſuffer them to reenter againe. But Castalde (who well vnderſtood theſe deuiſes, which they ſhadowed with a pretence of good, and which in effect had an outward appearance of trueth) would by no meanes conſent to their perſwaſions: but diſſembling and poſſeſſing them with hope to graunt their requeſts, deferred as much as he could their demaunds; and that ſo much the rather, for that he knew how greatly it imported him to remaine in that place where  he was then reſident, from whence he might with good aduantages prouide for all diſtreſſed parts, and ſpecially for the neceſſities which daily might happen, as alſo to conſider the end to which Mahomets affayres againſt Agria might tend.
            In this time there arriued at Vienna the Popes Nuntio and Comiſſaries, Information vpō the death of George. with articles drawne and propounded by Cardinals deputed thereto, touching the information of Frier George his death, vpon which they were to examine witneſſes, and to bee informed by them, if it were true, that hee practiſed treaſon againſt Ferdinand, in fauour of the Turkes: and namely, to  cauſe him to loſe and be depriued of the Realme, and ſo accordingly to cenſure, if the death of Frier George was iuſt or no. Hereupon Ferdinand and King Maximilian writ to Caſtalde, that he ſhould ſend them the examination of the witneſſes, which he had cauſed to be heard and examined, as well in Tranſiluania as elſewhere, to the end that thereby they might cenſure of the offence, as the qualitie and condition of the fact required. Caſtalde receiuing this meſſage, cauſed to be examined one Emeric the Friers Secretarie, and an other that was his Chancellor named Adam, who depoſed certaine things which might giue ſome ſhadow and colour of ſuſpition: but in their examinations they were quite different the one from the other, and the ſaid Emeric 
                vpon ſome diſpleaſure which he conceiued againſt the Frier, was not accounted an vnblameable witnes. Caſtalde was greatly troubled to finde any who could verefie that which was imputed againſt the Frier: yet within certaine moneths after there were ſent to Vienna certaine proceedings which they had paſſed touching that point, and afterwards they were preſented to

the Comiſſaries, who with ſpeede carried them to Rome. As theſe perſons  departed from thence, Ferdinand being throughly informed of the vile and infamous loſſe of Lippa, and how it happened by Aldenes cowardlines: to the end therefore that this ignominious fact ſhould not remaine vnpuniſhed, he commaunded Caſtalde that Aldene ſhould bee committed to priſon, and that by the conſent and aduice of the Vayuode, his proceſſe ſhould bee Aldenes triall vpon life and death. made againſt him; by meanes whereof he meant to make him vnderſtand that he would puniſh him rigorouſly, to the end that others by his example, ſhould learne more valiantly to maintaine their owne reputation, then hee had done. According to this commaund Aldene was examined, and demaunded vpon what occaſion he fiered the munition and victuals, and why  (without ſeeing any enemie) he ſo cowardly left this Fortreſſe, and cauſed it to bee burnt. In anſwer of which demaunds, he alleadged for his excuſe, that he was forced thereunto, by reaſon the moſt part of the ſouldiours were fled from thence, and that becauſe he had not time commodious to carrie out the victuals, Artillerie, and munition, he commaunded them to be burnt after that manner, chuſing rather to conſume them ſo, then ſuffer them to be a ſpoyle to the enemie, and that for the ſame conſideration he had performed the like to the Caſtle and towne, thinking that the Turkes ſeeing ſuch an apparant ruine, they would neuer afterwards make account of it, nor regard to fortifie it; he for his part purpoſing, that after they were departed thence, he would returne thither againe, and eſtabliſh it in the former  eſtate, and fortifie it ſtronger then before: and that for theſe reaſons he was incited and conſtrained to doe that which he did. But more fully to know the trueth of all theſe matters, and to the end he ſhould not any thing complaine of iniurie that might bee done him, certaine Iudges were deputed to know and vnderſtand his cauſe, and to examine the ſouldiours who had been with him in Lippa.
            During all theſe proceedings which were managed at Vienna, concerning Frier George his death, and in Tranſiluania vpon Aldenes fact, Mahomet ſeeing how all things did euen vntill thē proſperouſly ſucceed with him, and how much Fortune did fauour him in his conqueſts, which he achieued  with ſmall labour; and how beſides ſhe had wonne him that honour and glorie, which he neuer expected to haue, perceiuing himſelfe by ſuch euents to be greatly redoubted and feared, did not one mite eſteeme the towne of Agria, perſwading himſelfe to haue wonne it eaſier, then he had done the other townes: and in the end (although he was greatly vrged thervnto) he marched thither, diſmiſſing a good part of his armie, aſſuring himſelfe he ſhould little neede ſo many men, nor ſuch a power of Caualarie, as vntill then he had, knowing this place to bee of no ſtrength, nor ſuch that it could long reſiſt his forces: whereupon he ſent the Baſha of Buda before  with certaine troupes of horſe to view the countrie, and to aſſure the frontiers thereof, hauing had aduertiſement that Duke Mauris was arriued at Duke Mauris of Saxonie arriued in Hungarie with 15000. men for Ferdinand. Iauarin, where he was lodged with 10000. Lanſquenets, and 5000. horſe, according to the promiſe which he made to Ferdinand, to whom he had aſſured that he would performe in Hungarie ſome profitable matter for the generall

good, as it was alſo accorded at Iſpurch betweene the Emperour and  him. This Duke had alreadie cauſed a bridge to bee built ouer Danubius, bruting it abroad that he would march to beſiege Strigonium. But although that at the beginning the Turkes had ſome feare and doubt thereof, yet this ſiege in the end was found to be nothing elſe but a particular ruine of this prouince, and it was the cauſe of a thouſand inconueniences and griefes to Ferdinand, and made him to conſume and ſpend all that treaſure which he had leauied to pay the armie which he entertained in Tranſiluania: and that was the cauſe alſo yt neither on the one ſide nor on the other, could any good be done. In the end the Baſha of Buda preſented himſelfe before Mauris, not with intent to fight (for his force was then but weake) but onely to diſcerne  his countenance, and whither he would march, that he might ſpeedily relieue that place, and in the meane time ſomewhat to bridle his proceedings.
            Whileſt theſe two expected each others attempts, in ſuch ſort as you haue Mahomet beſiegeth the towne of Agria. heard, Mahomet incamped himſelfe about Agria with 60000. men, and 50. peeces of Artillerie. This towne was in a manner all open, with a Caſtle after the ancient fortification, without any defences or Bulwarkes, but onely certaine towers, and it is commaunded by a hill, the deſcent of which commeth within a ſtones caſt of the wall. This default of Rampiers and other weake meanes, was ſupplied by the inuincible courages of thoſe that were within, who were Hungars, to the number of 2000. of whom there were  500. gentlemen well diſſended, and no leſſe eſteemed in the countrie for their vertue and proweſſe, who were retired thither with their wiues, children, and moueables, hauing no other place of ſtrength in the countrie but that, where they could finde any ſafetie for their goods and liues. Theſe, with the inhabitants of the towne and other ſouldiours, ſwore and proteſted The reſolution of the Agrians. among themſelues, that not any one vpon their liues ſhould aduenture to ſpeake of any agreement, nor yeeld vpon no compoſition, nor yet to make replie to the enemies ſpeeches, but onely with Harquebuze and Cannon: and in caſe that by the length and tediouſnes of the ſiege, they ſhould  bee brought to extremitie of victuals, they ſhould firſt eate one another, rather then cowardly to yeeld. And that daily (after interceſſion to God, and hearing Maſſe) both men and women, without intermiſſion, ſhould labour the ſtrengthening of the Rampiers and fortifications: and to auoyde all treaſon, they did expreſſely prohibit that none ſhould aſſemble aboue three or foure in a companie. Beſides, they ordained that all the prouiſion, as well for the munition as for the particular houſes, ſhould equally bee diſtributed by weight, and ſo much for a day: and that the Doues, Hens, Capons, Pullets, and other like victuals, ſhould ſafely bee kept and reſerued for the ſicke and wounded: and that all the ſpoyles which ſhould be gotten vpon the enemie, ſhould be put into a place apart, to make equall diuiſion therof among thoſe  who had beſt defended their countrie (comprehending therein the women alſo) who daily were marked and obſerued by a certaine Preacher, who during that ſiege ſhewed himſelfe valiant and reſolute in fighting, and was the ſpeciall cauſe (by his exhortations) of this great effect, that thoſe of Agria

brauely indured thirteene moſt cruell and bloodie aſſaults, and that they  ſhewed themſelues ſo gallant as they did, as preſently we ſhall ſpeake of. Being all of this reſolution, rather to dye, then yeeld themſelues vnder the faithleſſe mercie of the Baſha, they kept themſelues in continuall readines, to anſwer him with like armes to thoſe wherewith he ſaluted them.
            
               Mahomet (before he enterpriſed any thing againſt the towne) ſent to thoſe of the Caſtle, that if they would yeeld to him, he would then vſe them curteouſly, and with fayre warres ſuffer them to depart in all ſecuritie with their baggage, and he would yeeld them ſuch recompence, that they ſhould haue good occaſion to thinke well of him: and if they ſtood out and performed the contrarie, he aſſured them he would put them all to death, and pitch them vpon ſtakes, if they fell into his hands. But thoſe within would giue no  eare to this ſummons, neither would they make any anſwer, but onely by ſigne, cauſing a beare or coffin, couered with blacke, to be faſtned vpon two Launces, and in this ſort to be ſhewed ouer the wall to the Trumpetter who ſpake to them, they not ſpeaking any one word to him, thereby giuing him to vnderſtand, that that Caſtle ſhould bee their ſepulcher, rather then they would yeeld it to them; it being then a cuſtome to vſe ſuch a ceremonie, when they would not accept of any conditions of yeelding, but rather die in libertie, then liue vnder the commaund of their enemies.
            
               Mahomet vnderſtanding of this their determination, and ſeeing in vaine he ſought compoſition with them, ſent that night to view the Caſtle, and  afterward appointed two batteries, the one towards the Church, and the other towards the hill, and in each batterie he planted 25. peeces, which continually played the ſpace of 40. daies. All the top and heigth of the Caſtle was wholly ruinated and ſo open, that the aſſieged could not any longer bee in ſafetie, in reſpect the Artillerie did greatly endamage them, and ſpecially that which was vpon the hill; which to warrant themſelues from the violence thereof, they within made a large and deepe Trench along the walles, where they rampierd themſelues, and in the night kept good watch without being farre from it, neither to eate nor ſleepe vntill the others were come thither to relieue them, which euery ſixe houres they carefully performed. 
            
            Preſently after, Baſha Achmeth and Mahomet cauſed in one day to be giuen three aſſaults in diuers places, in which they loſt 8000. Turkes, who were climed vp to the top of the walles, and mounted vpon the breach, with many of their principall Commanders, for whoſe deaths the Turkes were more inraged and incenſed then before, and yet they ceaſed not without intermiſſion, to trie the aſſieged with new aſſaults and reenforcing of Cannons: and one day they gaue in foure places one of the horribleſt aſſaults that euer was heard of, to which ranne all the men and women of the towne, who with no  leſſe courage then the men themſelues deſperatly fought like Lioneſſes with The courage of the women of Agria. weapon, ſtones, and skalding water, making ſo great a maſſacre of the enemies, that it was a dreadfull and moſt horrible thing, and worthie of commiſeration to beholde. During theſe aſſaults they performed many notable acts, and worthie to bee regiſtred in all volumes, of which the firſt was,

that the mother, the daughter, and ſonne in law fighting vpon the wall, the  husband of the ſaid daughter was killed, and the mother with compaſſion ſaying to her daughter, that ſhe ſhould goe and burie him: ſhe replied, that it was now no time to vſe obſequies, nor to attend vpon funerals, but rather to performe ſome cruell reuenge: whereupon taking her husbands ſword and his target vpon her arme, ſhe thruſt her ſelfe into the place of the dead, where ſhe ſhewed incredible valour, and by no meanes ſhe would depart from thence, before ſhe had reuenged the death of her husband by the defeate of three Turkes: which being done, ſhe withdrew herſelfe, and tooke the bodie of her dead husband in her armes, and carried it to the Church, cauſing him to be buried according to his degree. 
            
            It happened alſo in another place, that a woman carying a great ſtone vppon her head, with intent to throw it downe from the wall vpon the Turkes, a Cannon bullet ſtrooke off her head, and falling dead at her daughters feet, who taking that ſtone vpon her head all bloodie as it was, without omitting any time to bewaile the death of her mother, ſaying, that her death ought not to bee vnreuenged, and that it was not fitting for her (being her daughter) to liue, without reuenging her death vpon another: and thus being inflamed, and as it were inraged, ſhe ranne thence with great furie where the greateſt throng and preaſe of Turks were, and killed two of them, and wounded many other, imitating a true Amazon, or woman of Lacedemonia, and beſtirring her ſelfe from one place to another, ſhe exhorted euery one to  performe their vttermoſt valour, putting them in minde of the oth which they had taken, and the glorious reputation which before God and the world they ſhould obtaine: and by this meanes ſhe preuailed ſo farre, that the enemies were ſhamefully repulſed and forced, maugre their brauerie, to retire &amp; forſake their Artillerie, in ſuch ſort, that there was two of their greateſt peeces lipped. The courages now of the aſſieged was marueilous great, and ſpecially of the women, who with their husbands, fathers, children, and brothers, fought ſo couragiouſly, that they feared not any danger how great ſo euer it was. And as one day the Turkes gaue an aſſault to the towne (they being, as commonly they were wont to be, vpon the wall, armed with dead  mens armour) it happened that a ſhot of Artillerie brought three or foure of thoſe to the ground, who were the formoſt and moſt readie to throw ſtones vpon the enemie; and although the blood and peeces of thoſe did much hinder the trauailes of them that were their companions, yet notwithſtanding they made not any ſemblance or token of feare, but rather in ſtead of hiding themſelues, they more inraged then before, preſented themſelues to the fight to reuenge their companions, and taking the ſame ſtones, all beſprinkled with their blood, they mounted vpon the top of the wall, performing incredible valour. 
            
            By theſe heroicall acts, we may eaſily conceiue how great is the loue of our natiue countrie, and what commaund it hath ouer vs, ſince it incourageth for the defence thereof, a thing ſo feeble and weake as is a woman, appertly manifeſting to euery one, that there is not any thing in the world more deare or pretious, then our natiue countrie: for the good and preſeruation

of which, we are bound with our goods, honours, and liues to defend and preſerue. 
            
            Thoſe of Agria remained in this ſort ſo conſtant in their defence, (not willing at any time to ſpeake or lend their eare to any Turke, notwithſtanding they were greatly importuned thereto) that in the end they put Mahomet and the Baſha of Buda in deſpayre for euer getting them vnder their puiſſance. And thus theſe two Commaunders of the Turkiſh armie, ſeeing the aſſieged would by no meanes yeeld, and that by ſtrength they could not ſubdue them nor force the towne, by reaſon of the loſſe which they had made of their people at the former aſſaults, and that the time now was againſt them, for that the cold weather being now well forward, and the  ground often couered with ſnow, and their Campe ſorely infected with great mortalitie of men and horſes, they determined to diſlodge and ſpeedily to retire. According to this reſolution, Mahomet one night (being the Mahomet raiſeth his ſiege from before Agria. 18. of October 1552.) raiſed his whole Campe, and permitting Achmeth Baſha to march towards Buda, he himſelfe tooke the way of Belgrade, diſcharging by this meanes the enterpriſe of Agria, not without great ſhame and diſhonour. The aſſieged not ſatisfied to ſee themſelues at libertie by ſuch a departure, the ſame day that the Baſha diſlodged, they cauſed to ſallie out of the Caſtle 1000. men, that charged thoſe in the Rereward, that kept not cloſe together, and killed many of them, and afterwards they returned  loden with Turkiſh apparell, bringing with them many Camels and other beaſts loden with ſpoyle, and many priſoners, which was as a Trophie of their countrie, which they had well defended, and a glorie which worthely they achieued, meriting a glorious renowne, and an eternall memorie of a moſt excellent preſident to others, who may by ſo vertuous and honorable an act imitate them, cauſing to themſelues at the end of their honorable endeuours, a like triumph, as happened to thoſe of Agria, and a generall praiſe amongſt all liuing people.
            Whileſt Agria was thus battered by the Turkes, Caſtalde aduiſed Ferdinand, to commaund Duke Mauris that he ſhould with his armie of the one  ſide march againſt Mahomet, whileſt he with his people would aſſaile him on the other, aſſuredly thinking by this meanes to purſue and chaſe him, conſidering the poore and weake eſtate wherein he then was, by reaſon of the great loſſe of men which he had receiued at the aſſaults of Agria, and of the ſorrow and griefe which was among thoſe that remained, by reaſon of the famine that was in his Campe, it being brought into ſuch ſtate, that the ſcarcitie increaſed more and more; inſomuch that for theſe conſiderations it would be very eaſie for Caſtalde and Mauris ioyned together, with the aſſiſtance of the beſieged, to obtaine the famouſeſt victorie in the world, and in ſuch ſort to haue weakened the Turke, that for many yeeres after they ſhould liue ſecurely from receiuing any damage by him. But this counſell  was not ſo followed as it ſhould haue been, whereby they loſt one of the fitteſt oportunities that euer valiant Captaine could deſire. For Caſtalde was not onely readie to aſſaile the enemie, but then had he the meanes to giue him battaile in the field, for that Ferdinand had ſent him a good troupe of

light horſe: for want of which it hindered Mauris and Caſtalde to giue battaile,  not willing raſhly to be ſubiect to the hazard of fortune.
            In ſtead of this counſell, it was commaunded to harrie the countrie of Alberegalis and Veſprimia, with intent to diuert the ſiege from Agria, which could not be executed for the contrarietie of the times.
            During the time that Mahomet was incamped before Agria, the gentlemen of the countrie and all the townes, with the conſent of Caſtalde, had ſent The Hungars ſeeke peace with the Turk. to Ferdinand, that by his permiſſion they might (by meanes of Aly Chiauſs) treate of a peace and agreement with the Grand Seigniour. This Chiauſs was then with Mirce, Vayuode of the Tranſalpinians, and was come thither in Solymans name, to pacifie the people who were reuolted againſt their  Lord. Ferdinand was well content at this requeſt, and willingly conſented to them; alwaies prouided it ſhould be with the accuſtomed conditions and articles, and with the ſame tribute that he had before times made peace with K. Iohn, &amp; alſo with charge that they ſhuld reſtore the townes, Caſtles, &amp; places of Veſprimia, Drigal, Lippa, Themeſuar, Zaluoch, &amp; others which were taken by the Turks. He demaunded this, to the end that the truce or peace which was treated of, ſhould bring more honour then infamie to his reputation. This commaund being come, Caſtalde permitted them to negotiate whatſoeuer ſhould ſeeme behoouefull for them, forbidding them neuertheleſſe, to name Ferdinand or himſelfe after any manner in this treatie, eſteeming it not conuenient to the reputation of his Maieſtie, nor himſelfe being  of that qualitie, as then hee was. The Deputies of the kingdome being thus diſpatched, they went to ſeeke the Chiauſs, to whom they manifeſted the effect of their comming. Aly hauing vnderſtood the ſumme of their demaund, anſwered them, that willingly he would negotiate this affayre with the Grand Seigniour, and that at the furtheſt they ſhould haue anſwer the 25. of October, and full reſolution of the whole: and that for that occaſion they ſhould all then aſſemble at Waſrael, and not depart from thence vntill he made returne, or vntill ſuch time as he ſent to them.
            At the ſame time Caſſombaſſa leauied as many men about Lippa as hee  could, aſſembling all the frontier garriſons, with intention to make incurſion into Tranſiluania to ſpoyle the countrie, and to erect a Fort vpon the way betweene Lippa and Deua, that hereafter it might make his proceedings more eaſie to him, by meanes of a ſtrong garriſon which he would maintaine therein. Caſtalde to withſtand ſuch an enterpriſe, thought of many plots: and willing to reenforce the garriſon of Deua, he commaunded there ſhould goe thither three Enſignes of Germanes of Andrew Brandis Regiment. But for want of three payes which was owing them, they did mutinie: whereupon aſſembling altogether, they ſeazed on the Artillerie, and The Germanes mutinie. the moſt part of them came and ſacked the Spaniards lodgings, and namely  that of Caſtaldes, giuing them to vnderſtand that they would keepe him priſoner and detaine him, vntill all the Germanes were fully ſatisfied their due. Caſtalde being aduertiſed of this tumult, mounted vpon a good horſe and went into the field, ſending after to them Counte Iohn Baptiſted Arco to appeaſe them. He being now come to them, ſharply reproued them for that

they meant to commit ſo infamous an act, ſpecially for this that all were equally  fallen by meanes thereof into the like ſuſpition; and ſeuerely blaming the authors of that ſedition, he ſo farre preuailed that he appeaſed them, and procured their former obedience; neuertheleſſe aſſuring them that they ſhould receiue money, which preſently was payed them. Yet for all that they would not march on, ſo that they were conſtrained to ſend thither three other companies of Counte Helfeſtaines Regiment, who were better diſciplined in obeying their Commaunders. With theſe were ſent 400. Piſtoliers, and they altogether marched to Deua, where Iohn Turky and Paul Banchy attended them with 500. horſe of their owne, and other companies which Caſtalde had alreadie ſent thither: and hauing made one bodie of all  theſe ſouldiours, they marched towards Lippa, with a full reſolution to incounter Caſſombaſſa, and they proceeded on euen to Perias, which is a ſtrong Caſtle kept by the Turkes, ſituated eight miles from Lippa, harrying all the countrie, ruinating this new Fort which the Turkes had vndertaken to erect betweene Lippa and Deua, killing all thoſe they found within; and proceeding yet further, they perceiued not any enemie whatſoeuer: for that Caſſombaſſa hauing vnderſtood that Caſtalde was not any thing ſleepie or careleſſe for the ſafetie of this Prouince, durſt not enter any further, fearing to be cut off at the retraict, diſtruſting himſelfe that the boldnes of thoſe who were ſo forward vpon his borders, was nothing elſe but ſome traine to delude and intice him to proceede on, that afterward they might circumuent and intrap  his deſeignes. For theſe reſpects he proceeded no further, and our men returned againe from thence without any other profit, but onely endamaging their friends poſſeſſions, conſuming their victuals, &amp; ſpoyling them of thoſe little goods which they had, leauing to theſe poore villages (by this diſorder) a perpetuall memorie of the euill effects of warre.
            They being now all returned, the Captaine generall of the armie of the countrie would ſtay no longer in that kingdome: whereupon hee went to demaund leaue of Castalde, who by no meanes would permit him to depart, ſaying, it ſhould bee ill done of him to forſake him in ſuch a manner, being now alone in the field with ſo few men, ſpecially then becauſe it was certaine  that the Baſha was not yet wholly retired; deſiring him to haue patience and expect a while, vntill the ſaid Baſha was at the leaſt further remoued from that quarter, from whence he was aſſured that he muſt ſhortly bee forced to depart, by reaſon of the Perſian warre which Solyman had determined to make againſt the Sophy, to recouer the countries which were taken from him; and to warrant himſelfe from his eldeſt ſonne Muſtapha (of whom he had great miſtruſt) fearing that he would make himſelfe Lord and maſter of his Empire. But all theſe perſwaſions and intreaties were of no force to keep him there: for that thoſe reaſons which Caſtalde vſed, thinking thereby to  hinder him from going, did alſo ſerue him to haſten his departure, as he did at the end of eight daies, all his Caualarie following him, not any thing reſpecting all the proteſtations which Caſtalde could vſe, to diſſwade him therefrom. Notwithſtanding all this, Caſtaldes determination was not to remoue out of the field, neither to depart, before he had heard certaine newes that

               Mahomet was paſſed Tibiſcus and Danubius, becauſe that ſince the raiſing of his ſiege from before Agria, he had aduertiſement that he vſed long and tedious  iourneys to paſſe them. And expecting this iſſue, Caſtalde endured great diſcommodities, and extreame colds, for the high and deepe ſnowes which daily fell in great abundance, which made the ſouldiours paſſionate, and ſpecially for that they were not payed. Being then largely certified that Mahomet was entirely out of that part of Hungarie, he preſently licenſed all the ſouldiours of the kingdome to depart, and lodged the Germanes and Spaniards by Sibinio, and reenforced the garriſon of Deua, ſending thither a certaine number of Aiduchs to bee mingled amongſt the Germanes, and with the Caualarie that was therein, to the end that the one for the loue of the other ſhould bee more vigilant and carefull for the defence thereof, and  he gaue the commaund of all the horſe to Iohn Turky, and the gouernment of the towne and foote to Paul Banchy. Hee alſo ſent certaine horſe to Branchich, and commaunded that Deua ſhould be wholly enuironed with a wall made of earth and wood mingled together by equall diſtances, to the end that the Caualarie ſhould not ſo eaſily approach thereunto, and that the Infantrie ſhould not offend them.
            Now he ſeeing that all the people of Tranſiluania began greatly to murmur for the taxes which they daily paied to maintaine the burthen and charges of the warre (and both that he might giue time to his people to fortifie themſelues, and to reſiſt ſuch tumults, and alſo that he might certainly know  whether the Turke would enterpriſe the warre of Perſia) cauſed (the better to temper and mollifie the hearts of euery one) to bee publiſhed, that all the principall Peeres of the countrie ſhould aſſemble at Waſrael, to attend there the anſwer of Solyman, and to know if he would be content to accept (with the foreſaid conditions) the yeerely tribute of 20000. Duckets, and ſo to Tribute which was payed to the Turke by the Hungars. make truce with them, which he did thinke would be more expedient and behoouefull for Ferdinands affayres, then for the benefit of that people, matters being full of ſtirres and doubtfulnes, and ſpecially for that he ſaw himſelfe disfurniſhed of men and money, and out of hope to haue any ſuccours; further conſidering, that though the ſame would not ſerue to any other end,  but to bring with it a great commoditie of gaining time, that in the meane while he might cauſe to be aduanced and finiſhed the fortifications begun about the townes; yet neuertheleſſe it would be a ſpeciall cauſe of great profit to Ferdinand, as well to accommodate and negotiate his matters in Germanie, as alſo to demaund ayde both of men and money, and likewiſe to remedie the great neceſſities which then were diſperſed through all the parts of that Prouince, which now tended rather to reuolt, then maintaine obedience and former faith giuen to Ferdinand. According to theſe conſiderations, he by the meanes of ſundrie perſons ſolicited, that this buſines might take effect, yet he would not be openly ſeene therein himſelfe, for feare leaſt  the Turke ſhould conceiue in him ſome relenting, and ſhould ſee the neceſſities which enuironed him on all ſides. But on the contrarie he made an outward ſemblance, as though he no whit at all feared his enemie, vſing this courſe, to the end that the Turke fearing they would ſpoyle the countrie,

whileſt he ſhould bee buſied in the Perſian warre, which was farre from this countrie, he would the more willingly bee inclined vnto peace. After this  publication he went and lodged at Albe-iula, from whence he might more commodiouſly prouide for all places, hauing for his guard 500. Spaniſh Harquebuziers, and one companie of 200. Aiduchs, to put into garriſon in that towne.
            At this very ſame time there was brought to Rome the proceedings taken The Popes abſolution in fauour of Ferdinand for the murther of George. touching Frier George his death, and vpon the continuall ſoliciting of Ferdinands Ambaſſadours, the Cardinals (appointed for that purpoſe) aſſembled to giue a finall ſentence of this fact, this cauſe being alreadie very grieuous in the Court of Rome: and notwithſtanding that they found many  things and allegations worthie of good oppoſitions, yet neuertheleſſe not to ingender more grieuous inconuenience, and for many other reaſons beſides, which I will not write of, they ceaſed not (conſidering it was a deed which could be no otherwiſe then done) to abſolue Ferdinand, with all the conſpirators, adding notwithſtanding this clauſe in their ſentence; that if the defences and allegations propounded by Ferdinand were true. Which the ſoliciters of his Maieſtie liked not of, who ſo much importuned the Pope, that in the end they had it abſolute without limit of any condition. And although the Pope refuſed to abſolue the complices of this death, yet in the end at the earneſt intreaties of the ſaid Ambaſſadours, this matter was ended,  and the abſolution for them all was ſent to Vienna. Which was not performed but with Ferdinands great content, who vntill then was prohibited to heare Maſſe, and all other diuine ſeruice, yea and he was forbidden to enter into the Church.
            During this ſeaſon there happened a thing, which I will not forget to make recitall of, although it doth ſomewhat eſtrange it ſelfe frō the ſubiect of this my diſcourſe. It happened in former time that one Raoul, a gentleman of Tranſalpinia, was diſpoſſeſſed from the Vayuodſhip of the Tranſalpinians, Raoul expulſed from his Vayuodſhip of Tranſalpinia by Mirce: he recouereth it, and diſcomfiteth Mirce. which before his time was maintained and kept by his father, and which by right of ſucceſſion the office belonged to him. This man ſeeing himſelfe  expulſed by force and treacherie from that kingdome, by the crueltie and wickednes of Marc (which in their language is called Mirce) an arrogant and proud tyrant, who had made himſelfe Vayuode, and who had conſtrained Raoul ſhamefully to flie away, and to ſeeke elſewhere how he might maintaine his life, leauing his houſe and poſſeſſions vnder the commaund of his mortalleſt enemies: and thinking in himſelfe many thoughts concerning this his miſerable fortune, and apprehending a thouſand deliberations in his minde, that he might bee able to reenter againe into his poſſeſſions, and imagining that there was not any of ſufficient ſtrength to ayde him thereto; in the end he reſolued to preuaile (if he could) by the meanes and fauour  of Caſtalde, to whom he was alreadie retired, and had ſerued him during the paſſed warres, with fiue or ſixe ſeruants onely, and ſome few horſes: and although he was held in good regard, and entertained as well as might be, yet was it nothing in compariſon of his paſſed greatnes, being reſpected and hohoured as a King; ſo that he eſteemed of this ſmall entertainment, no otherwiſe

then of a certaine miſerie: which cauſed a great commiſeration among  all the nations, ſeeing a man that had gouerned and managed a kingdome, euen as his owne, to bee brought (by the crueltie of wicked Fortune) into ſuch extreame pouertie, as to haue ſo few ſeruants, to whom oftentimes he could doe no more but prouide them foode. And euery man ſeeing this his miſerie to continue ſo long, they eſteemed him a man of ſmall reſolution, and ſuch an one as could not haue in himſelfe any aſpiring thoughts. But in the end, feeling himſelfe ſpurred on with ſuch a ſhame, and he being informed of the good ſucceſſe happened to Stephen, Vayuode of Moldauia, tooke courage by this preſident, and began to thinke how he could make away his enemie: and intreating Caſtalde for a certaine number of footmen  and horſe, and that he would further him with his meanes in the enterpriſe which hee would execute touching the death of Mirce, not being able any longer to tolerate this pouertie, which by hard fortune he was fallen into: and comming one day vnto him, he began in this ſort to ſpeake.
            
               Sir, it is ſome yeeres ſince that I haue been out of my hereditarie eſtate, expulſed from thence by the fraud and treaſon of that cruell and tyrannicall Mirce, who now by the ſupport and fauour of the Turkes poſſeſſeth it, daily vſing therein monſterous cruelties, farre vnfitting all humane proceedings, and which indeede farre exceed all barbarous cuſtome, hauing a while ſince (for feare I ſhould bee ayded to recouer that which I haue loſt) put to death by diuers torments, more then 3000. men, beſides an infinit company of women,  with moſt horrible crueltie, not minding euer to eate before he had ſatisfied his crueltie in cutting off the head of ſome great Lord. And with ſuch tyrannous behauiour he dominereth ouer that my poore and miſerable people, who for feare of loſing their liues, are conſtrained either to abandon their naturall homes, continually roming here and there, or elſe contrarie to their likings to doe that which he commaundeth them. Now conſidering theſe wicked and deteſtable actions, I not being able to containe my ſelfe any longer within the bounds of patience, I am determined to aſſaile my fortune, which I truſt will yeeld me mine owne eſtate, or elſe I will depriue my bodie of this mortall life, which is not able any longer to tolerate this his inſolencie.  And in regard thereof, I earneſtly entreate you by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt (according to which we liue, and in which my enemie beleeueth not, but rather vtterly deſpiſeth) that you would not forſake me in this neceſſitie, but aſſiſt me with what ſuccours you can, to the end that by the meanes thereof I may be able to recouer my kingdome, and reuenge the blood ſhed of ſo many noble gentlemen, as for my ſake haue been moſt vily and againſt all equitie cruelly maſſacred. And if the victorie happely inclineth to my part, it ſhall be for the generall good of all Chriſtians, and ſpecially for Ferdinands ſeruice. And if it ſucceedeth otherwiſe (which God defend) I  had rather die fighting within mine owne countrie, then to liue in this exile, expulſed by the treacherie of this cruell monſter Mirce.
               
            
            
               Caſtalde comforting and exhorting him to purſue this enterpriſe, anſwered him, that conſidering the iuſt cauſes which he alleadged, and of which he was ſufficiently informed, he need not to doubt to haue good iſſue thereof,

by reaſon of the ſuccours which he promiſed him, and ſpecially by the aſſiſtance of Ieſus Chriſt, which was the moſt ſure and certaine helpe, becauſe  he was worſhipped by him, and not by his enemie: and ſecondly, that ſupport which he might get by the force and vertue of his owne arme, and by the valiantnes of his combattants: and for the laſt, he offered him a good number of ſouldiours, and ſummes of money, exhorting him to haſten this expedition, whileſt the Turk was buſied in the Perſian affayres, and that he ſhould not loſe this occaſion which ſo fauourably preſented it ſelfe: for that before the Turke could come to giue any reliefe to Mirce, he ſhould bee more then a yeere ſetled and poſſeſſed of the Seigniorie, and ſhould haue the meanes ſo firmely to aſſure and reeſtabliſh his forces there, that he would  bee well content to haue him for his friend. He gladly condiſcended to all that which he demaunded, and rather by reaſon of the compaſſion which he had of him, then that he thought he could become victorious in ſuch an enterpriſe. Whereupon he gaue him 700. horſe, and 1500. Aiduchs, the beſt ſouldiours that he had, and who had very well witneſſed their valour during theſe warres, they being continually employed about Themeſuar, keeping Mahomets Campe ſtill in larums, and many times put them to ſhamefull foyles. The Captaine of which companie was named Nicholas, a moſt gallant and reſolute man in fight, although very often he would bee drunke, according to the cuſtome of thoſe nations. Raoul hauing obtained his deſire,  tooke leaue of Caſtalde, and with his ſouldiours, and others his confederates that were adhering to him, he reſolued either to conquer, or dye.
            As theſe marched on, Mirce had notice of the forces that Raoul leauied in all parts, and how he came to ſeeke him, and with what intention. Which being duly conſidered of, he preſently cauſed (by the meanes and aſſiſtance of his friends) to leauie as many men as he could, making an armie of 24000. men, with whom, and with 36. peeces of Artillerie, he went into the field, lodging about Tergouiſta, with reſolution there to attend his enemie, for that the place was moſt commodious to diſpoſe and range his people in battaile. Raoul on the other ſide, notwithſtanding all his attempts and diligence,  could leauy no more (euen with Caſtaldes people) then 12000. men, although he had many friends, and was generally the beſt liked of among all the Tranſalpinians. For none durſt ſhew him any fauour, ſeeing he was of ſo weake a force, and his enemie ſo braue and gallant; euery one fearing that the iſſue of this enterpriſe would not ſucceede to his honour: and to fall into the danger of Mirces diſpleaſure, whoſe horrible and execrable crueltie euery one greatly feared. With theſe few men neuertheleſſe he deſiſted not from marching to incounter his enemie, who had for his Vauntgard 600. Turkes on horſebacke: and being reſolued to giue him battaile, and not to bee amazed at any hand with the great preparation of his enemie, he being one morning by dawning of the day arriued vpon certaine hils, was diſcouered by  the Sentinels of Mirce, who then ſuddenly cauſed his people to bee ranged The battaile betweene Raoul and Mirce. and ordered, ſeeing he could by no meanes refuſe the battaile, and knowing that his enemies were reſolutely determined to fight: and although it was ſo that he might haue auoyded it, yet would he not retire, although he had

ſome doubt and ſuſpition to fight, being aduertiſed that Raoul brought with  him both Spaniards and Germanes which Caſtalde had giuen him, aſſuring himſelfe that thoſe few ſouldiours which were with him were moſt valiant and expert, and not eaſie to bee ouercome; yea and hee did alſo diſtruſt of ſome other ſuccours. While ſuch thoughts were in hammering, Raoul in the end made two ſquadrons of his armie, each ſquadron being of 5000. foote and 1000. horſe, the moſt part of which were Harquebuziers; and cauſing thē to march within harquebuze ſhot, they made a ſtand vpon a hill, cauſing them in ſuch ſort to be ſtretched out, that they made ſhew of 14. or 15000. men. Which being perceiued by Mirce, and eſteeming that number to bee greater then they ſhewed themſelues before, he began to diſtruſt himſelfe of  ſome deceit, and that he had not at the firſt certaine intelligence; commaunding his people to ſtand more cloſe then ordinary, when the Harquebuziers of Raoul, more confuſedly then diſciplinarily, without expecting any other commaund or ſignall to fight, were reſolued (as before they promiſed) either to ouercome, or die, and gaue ſo furious a charge vpon one of Mirces ſquadrons, as wolues vſually doe amongſt a thouſand flocke of ſheepe, and breaking the firſt rankes, and quaſhing many a Turke (who as the moſt reſolute men were in the fore rankes, and vpon whom Mirce repoſed his greateſt confidence) the others began preſently to recoyle, and in flying they committed ſuch diſorder, that there was none amongſt them who thought not flying to be his beſt ſafetie. Raoul on the other ſide at the ſame inſtant with  his Infantrie and Caualarie, moſt fiercely entered into another ſquadron of his enemies horſe, with no leſſe courage then the ſaid Harquebuziers did, and breaking the firſt rankes, he forced the other to turne their backes, being on all ſides gaulled and pearced with the thicke haile of the Harquebuziers, who made not any ſhot in vaine. This flight was of ſo great efficacie for Raouls good, that Mirces ſquadron ſeeing theſe two thus quite defeated, being poſſeſt with feare, without further expectance of the enemie, bequeathed themſelues ſo to flight &amp; confuſion, that happie was he that could beſt Mirce ouerthrowne. flie, and he eſteemed himſelfe moſt fortunate, who ſuppoſed that he ſhould  be ſaued rather then others: this ouerthrow thus happening, becauſe that the greateſt part of this armie was compoſed of men ſent by the townes and Lords of the countrie, who are rather fit to make a number and ſhadow, then to winne a victorie.
            Thus wee often ſee that multitudes of ſuch who are thus rawly ſent, are for the moſt part ouercome and ſubdued by a leſſer number of ſouldiours, well diſciplined and practiſed in warre, who to obtaine honour, refuſe neither perill of ſword, fire, nor yet death it ſelfe: and by this wee may iudge how dangerous and peſtilent, feare and cowardiſe is in an armie; and how much on the contrarie, vertue and valour, and the proweſſe of a noble and generous courage, ioyned with the force and dexteritie of the bodie, are extolled:  by which commendable qualities, wee may auoyde the detraction and infamie of this world, and purchaſe this true glorie, which beautifieth and adorneth euery one, and which raiſed Raoul to the type of honour, winning ſo eaſily thereby this victorie, that it ſeemed it was a true miracle of Ieſus

Chriſt, who to puniſh this tyrant (an enemie of his faith) iuſtly permitted  this ruine to befall him.
            The ſouldiours of Raoul ſeeing then that Mirces armie was quite ouerthrowne, and that there were not now any who oppoſed themſelues againſt them, forbearing the execution and ſlaughter of their enemies, they began to ſearch and ranſacke thoſe who fell into their hands, and they performed ſo much for their owne profit, that euery one of them became very rich thereby. All thoſe of Mirces faction who were aliue, preſently ranged themſelues vnder the Victors Enſigne: as it is alwaies the cuſtome of the vulgar ſort to follow new fortunes, and daily deſire new Lords. And making together a great army, they determined to purſue Mirce, who ſaued himſelfe with  the reſt of the 500. Turkes, which before is ſpoken of, and had now paſſed Danubius. There died in this battaile about 7. or 8000. men of Mirces part, and Raoul loſt about ſome 700. Raoul thus achieuing this notable victorie, he preſently got poſſeſſion of all the moueables of his enemie, which were ſaid to be more worth then 200000. Duckets, with which he bettered his former neceſſitie, and recouered all his kingdome: the principall Peeres thereof, with all his kindred and friends, came to receiue and acknowledge him for their true and liege Lord, and after that they conducted him with pompe to Tergouiſta, where friendly and willingly they all ſwore fidelitie to him, and Tergouiſta the capitall towne of the Tranſalpinians. did him all the honours as was fitting for them.
            Behold here the mutations and changes of fortune, with which ſhe exalteth  and abaſeth whom it pleaſeth her, and giueth example to Potentates of the world, after what ſort they are to diſpoſe of their actions, and how little they ought to truſt in her; becauſe that throwing them to the ground, they cannot eſteeme any thing firme and ſtable. A Bugeron followed Mirce, and incountring with another Bugeron, who was well apparelled and richly armed, he killed him, verely beleeuing it had been Mirce himſelfe; and reporting this newes, it cauſed generally euery one to reioyce. But preſently after it was knowne not to bee true, and that he was ſaued in manner as wee haue ſaid.
            Certaine daies after, Raoul hauing pacified all the troubles in his kingdome,  diſpatched his Ambaſſadours to Caſtalde, to giue him heartie thankes for all his former fauours hee had ſhewed him, and for the ayde that hee gaue him, with which hee wonne this victorie, which had yeelded him his kingdome, and preſerued his life: whereupon he entirely offered himſelfe vnto him, aſſuring him to bee alwaies readie vpon any occaſion whatſoeuer to accompanie him: and beſides, ſwearing to him all fidelitie, and that for his owne part and his countries, he would continually obſerue good peace and amitie with him.
            Whileſt he was in this diſpatch, there arriued at Waſrael the Chiauſs,  who ſhould negotiate this peace between Ferdinand, Solyman, and the Tranſiluanians, as a little before is recited. He being returned from Conſtantinople, and come to this place, he found there aſſembled (according to the former order) moſt of all the principall States of that countrie, who attended him with great deſire and hope of peace. This negotiator was very honourably

entertained by them, and after he had repoſed himſelfe one day, he  was conducted into the aſſemblie, where in ſtead of peace and truce, hee The anſwer of Solyman to the requeſt that the Hungars made for peace. brought ſuch feare and aſtoniſhment into the mindes of euery one, that it was an incredible thing: for that in ſtead of accepting the tribute, he ſpoke to them all in the name of Solyman, that his pleaſure was they ſhould receiue King Iohns ſonne and Queene Izabella his mother as their true and lawfull Lords, and ſhould expulſe Caſtalde out of Tranſiluania, and cut all the ſouldiours in peeces which were payed by Ferdinand, and that then he would receiue the ordinarie tribute, and would eſteeme them worthie of his grace and fauour: and if they otherwiſe did, that hee would then cauſe them to know what his indignation would bee, and that his abilitie and Maieſtie  had the power to reuenge himſelfe againſt them all, putting all to fire and ſword, trampling and pacing his horſes ouer their bodies, reducing their countrie into a miſerable deſtruction. And hauing thus ſaid vnto them, he gaue them a letter written in Latin, directed to Vayuode Battor, and to all the other Lords and Peeres of the kingdome, which verbatim I haue truly written, without altering or corrupting any thing therein contained. It was written in parchment, ſhining like glaſſe, in letters of gold after the Turkiſh manner, in legible Latin. The ſuperſcription whereof was thus.

                     THE MANDATE OF THE INVINCIBLE EMPErour of the Turks, to Lord Andrew Battor, Captaine in Tranſiluania, and to all the other Lords and Peeres of that countrie.
                  
                  BY the authoritie and expreſſe commaund of our greatnes and highnes, you ſhall vnderſtand (you faithfull in the faith of Chriſt Andrew Battor, wiſe and knightly Lord amongſt all the Chriſtians inhabiting in Tranſiluania, and all you the reſidue of our louing Lords) how that many times wee haue made knowne to you (ſince that Frier George our Treaſurer was cruelly and by treaſon murdered, before he could chaſe out the Germanes, which  you by your diſſentions vntimely haue brought into the kingdome) that you your ſelues, and all the reſt of the Lords of Tranſiluania, ſhould by common conſent and mutuall ayd, expulſe the ſaid Germanes out of your countrie, according to the fidelitie which you owe to our Port and ſtatelines. Which not being as yet performed by you, wee were very carefull now to incite you to doe it, pardoning you of all the former offences and faults, which vntill now you haue committed againſt vs, and promiſing to giue it you againe, and to preſerue all the libertie which heretofore you haue had in that kingdome of Tranſiluania: and you our Lords and ſubiects ſhall alwaies be vnder our protection and ſafegard, and we will hold you in ſuch regard,  as ſhall be fitting for you. And concerning the kingdome of Tranſiluania, as vnder the gouernment of King Iohn, and of his ſonne our faithfull ſubiects, it was in peace and freedome: euen ſo wee will ordaine that at this preſent it ſhall ſo continue: and we aſſuredly promiſe you, that the ſaid ſonne of King Iohn ſhall raigne and gouerne amongſt you. For ſo long as King Solyman for Queene Izabella. 
                     Iohn (our Vaſſall and ſubiect) ſerued vs faithfully and ſincerely, we neuer ſuffered that any ſhould moleſt or trouble you: but further after his death, wee of our ſingular grace and clemencie, gaue to his ſonne (being yet in minoritie) his fathers countrie and that kingdome, and then Tranſiluania was alwaies quiet. But after that you had called in the Germanes amongſt you, great diſſentions were ſtirred vp betweene you: in reſpect whereof, and to  reeſtabliſh King Iohns ſonne and his mother, and to deliuer Tranſiluania from her naturall enemies; we by the grace of God, haue commaunded to leauie a very great and puiſſant armie. It behoueth you therefore, in conſideration of your loyaltie, that your care and diligence bee, with force of armes to expulſe out of your kingdome the Germanes, and whileſt that King Iohns ſonne bee reeſtabliſhed in his place and dignitie, that you elect a generall Captaine in that kingdome, to whom you may all obey, and not ſuffer any longer your naturall enemies to bee amongſt you, but by a common conſent to baniſh from thence, thoſe, who are the cauſe of ſo many garboyles  amongſt you, and that euery one of you endeuour himſelfe (according to his abilitie) well and diligently to gouerne the kingdome of King Iohns ſonne your Lord. And if we receiue from you this marke and token of fidelitie and obedience, you ſhall not onely obtaine of vs your ancient libertie in this your kingdome of Tranſiluania, but alſo receiue further from

our imperiall Maieſtie, ſpeciall honour and fauour. In the meane time wee will entertaine our mightie armie for the affayres of that kingdome, and for  the ayde and aſſiſtance of King Iohns ſonne; and we haue alreadie commanded that it ſhould preſently march for the deliuerie thereof, from out of his enemies hands. For wee will by no meanes tolerate, that his enemies ſhall raigne and gouerne in this Prouince. And being ſufficiently aſcertained how much King Iohn our Vaſſall hath been to vs a faithfull ſeruant, and alſo his ſonne, wee haue determined to reinſtall him into his kingdome, and to cauſe him to raigne in it by our meanes, and afford him ſuch ayde, that (by Gods permiſſion) he ſhall bee able to ouercome and ſurmount his enemie. To this intent (by Gods aſſiſtance) wee haue cauſed to march the magnificall  and puiſſant, our obedient ſubiect and faithfull ſeruant to our Highnes, the moſt illuſtrious Achmeth Baſha, ſecond Councellor to our excellent Maieſtie, and many other our ſubiects and Courtiers, with a great number of Ianiſaries of the moſt mightie and inuincible Port of our greatnes and highnes, hauing alſo commaunded all our generall Captaines and Sangiachs to cauſe to come from Greece and Buda a great armie, inſomuch, that with our ſaid Councellor, we ſhall haue an armie of 200000. men well appointed, before wee march in perſon againſt our enemie. And further, wee haue commaunded the moſt excellent Prince of Tartaria, the Vayuodes of Vallachia and Moldauia, with all the Sangiachs which are in thoſe countries on this  ſide and beyond Danubius, that with all their Infantrie and Caualarie they ſhall ioyne with our ſaid Vizir. And it is alſo neceſſarie that you obey (according to your fidelitie) the ſaid Baſha, and that you ſend your Ambaſſadours as well towards our royall Port, as alſo to him. But if you perſeuer diſobedient to our mandate, and that you accord and adherre to our enemies, then aſſuredly thinke, that the ruine, loſſe, and crueltie which the kingdome of Tranſiluania ſhall endure, ſhall not enſue but by your demerits. For by the grace of God the almightie Creator, wee hope to giue ſufficient teſtimonie to Chriſtians, and to the kingdome of Tranſiluania, what our indignation and puiſſance is. And if the Tranſiluanians (we affoording them our ayde)  will not returne to their ancient obedience and loyaltie, they ſhall neuer be on any ſide ſure or ſafe, but ſhall endure through the world the iuſt puniſhments which they haue merited. For wee haue ſworne to God almightie, that there ſhall not remaine in Tranſiluania one ſtone vpon another, that all the men ſhall be put to the ſword, the women and children ſhall bee led captiue, and wee will that all be throwne downe and leauied with the ground: whereof wee thought it fitting, firſt to aduertiſe you, as it belongeth to a moſt inuincible and victorious Emperour, to the end that the loſſe of ſo many ſoules ſhould not bee imputed to vs. We haue before times ſent you the like Edicts, which you haue neglected. But if to this laſt Mandate you  are not tractable and obedient, attribute to your ſelues, and not to vs, the crueltie and ruine which in ſhort time ſhall be inflicted vpon you. Aduiſedly then conſider in time on all things, for wee leaue the reſt to bee duly examined by your wiſedomes.

This Letter did ſo much daunt the mindes of euery one, that it little wanted  
               The Tranſiluanians aſtoniſhed at the letters of Solyman. there followed not a generall reuolt, as well for that Vayuode Battor was not there in perſon (he being abſent in reſpect of ſicknes) as alſo by reaſon that there was a ſpeech of the returne of King Iohns ſonne and of his mother. Caſtalde, who was yet at Albe-iula, (where he was lodged, the better to paſſe a good part of the winter) hauing receiued letters, by which he was certified of all this matter, and aduiſed to come with all ſpeede to take order therefore: further intimating vnto him, that the Tranſiluanians did no longer affect him, and that the moſt part of them would adherre to the Turke, and recall Iohn to bee their King: he preſently departed from Albe-iula the 2. of December, not reſpecting the rage and violence of the winter (which  then was extreame) and with great iourneys came to Waſrael, arriuing the ſame morning that the Diet ſhould haue been concluded, and that euery man ſhould haue deliuered his opinion. His arriuall greatly troubled the minds of the principalleſt amōg them, and ſtayed them a little for that time, hindering that the concluſion was not ſo preſently performed (which neuertheleſſe was alreadie wholly reſolued among them) and counſelled them to thinke further thereon. The day following, the better to expell from them this feare, and to reaſſure and confirme them in the deuotion and amitie of Ferdinand, he reproued the pride and vanitie of this ſaid letter, cauſing them all to be called to the Diet: and he ſpake to them in this ſort. 
            
            
               I know not (O you Lords and Peeres of Hungarie, Saxonie, and Sicilia) The oratiō of Caſtalde to thoſe of the Diet of Waſrael. vpon what occaſion you are ſo ſuddenly aſtoniſhed, and ſo much amazed, that I cannot but extreamely maruaile thereat, ſeeing that if for ſuch vaine boaſting words, you are ſo diſcouraged, and in a manner halfe dead; what I ſhould thinke of you if it happened to come to deedes: for dread of which you can doe no worſe: and for feare of the miſchiefe which the Turk denounceth to you, you ſhould with ſuch cowardlines, yeeld your neckes ſubiect vnder the yoke of his tyrannicall Empire, minding vpon ſo light an occaſion to defraud your ſelues of this glorie, which partly hath been ſeene to bee achieued by you vntill this preſent, and which in many armies hath ſhined euery where: not conſidering that ſome will boldly ſay, that your  feare hath been in part the cauſe, that ſuch iniurious writings and horrible menacies, ſhould haue the force with you to kill you, and cauſe you to dye, as men without ſeeing any ſword. But if it be your minde that men ſhould not ſo thinke of you, and that indeede you would not giue any occaſion thereof; why like women or children doe you ſuffer your ſelues to bee ſo amazed? Are you not men like vnto them? Haue you not the like equall courage, force, and vigour which they haue? Or what (I pray) haue they more then you? What maketh you thus ſo ſuddenly to feare, you whom in times paſt haue ſo many times beaten and ouerthrowne them? Doe you  not manage and beare the ſame armes? and ride you not on the ſame horſes, with which you haue often forſt them to many labours and toyles: ſo that they haue more occaſion to feare you, then you thus to loſe your courage in reſpect of them? What blame and diſgrace will this be to you, I ſay, who ſo many times haue been victorious, and often haue defeated and chaſed

the Turke out of this kingdome, to agree now to him, by reaſon of the brauado of a ſimple vaine letter, which by force of armes you would neuer  heretofore haue condiſcended vnto, and thus ſillily like ſimple lambes to throw your ſelues into the wolues mouth? Shall not this (trow you) bee a perpetuall diſhonor to you all? It behoueth you therefore to haue this conſtant opinion, that before you fall into this great indignitie and calamitie, that you expoſe your owne liues for your religion, countrie, children, brothers, wiues, ſiſters, and kinſefolkes, rather then remaining aliue, you ſhould become a laughing ſtocke to all the world. For thoſe ſhall alwaies be eſteemed glorious, and worthie of all praiſe, who fighting for the libertie of their countrie, and common good, ſhall not refuſe an honourable death, to auoyd  a miſerable and diſhoneſt life. It is apparant to you that the Turke hath alreadie ſounded all violent meanes, and not being able to ouercome you by force, he now goeth about by theſe his other ſubtelties to ſubdue and bring you vnder, to the end that you might proue by this his horrible crueltie, that which his owne naturall children are fallen into. And beleeue me, he that is cruell againſt his owne fleſh and blood, cannot bee milde and mercifull to others, as aſſuredly he will not be towards you at any hand: but he will carrie himſelfe ſo (ſeeing the diſſentions of you all not very well accorded amongſt your ſelues) as he and his predeceſſours behaued themſelues then, when they ſaw the diſſentions betweene the Chriſtian Princes, which haue thus increaſed this Empire vnto them, as with griefe too apparantly is ſeene  at this day. And aſſure your ſelues he will doe with you, as he hath done in Greece, which for her laſt refuge took a like reſolution to this of yours, the end of which, ought to be more manifeſt and euident then euer heretofore, by reaſon of the experience you haue had of former miſerie. And on the contrarie, if you will conſorte in a good and friendly vnion, theſe loftie and furious ſpeeches cannot any way hurt you. For a generall vnion and ſetled concord, doth alwaies feare and terrifie the enemie; and on the contrarie, diſcord and diſſention giueth him hope to ouercome: whereas by the meanes of a mutuall vnderſtanding and amitie among your ſelues, you may  bee aſſured he ſhall not haue the power to fleſh himſelfe in your blood, nor glut himſelfe amongſt you with all kinde of incontinencie, as his predeceſſors haue done in the principall houſes of Greece. Now, ſeeing it is naturally giuen to all, to be more inclined to chuſe of the worſt, rather then the beſt, I haue thought it fitting to aduertiſe you, with the beſt and pleaſingeſt perſwaſions that poſſibly I can, that you haue no need thus to neglect your former force and vertue, for brauadoes which are but forged and full of winde. Conſidering in what repoſe and quiet you now are, enioying your full libertie, and the ſame peaceably, and that vnder the wing and protection of your King, who is ſo milde and iuſt, that not any whoſoeuer may be compared to him: and imagining on the contrarie, that you ſhall neuer finde reſt  or ſafetie vnder the gouernment of this cruell and barbarous Lord; holding it for moſt certaine, that it is a vaine conceit for ſtrangers (ſuch as you are eſteemed of him) once to thinke that they are able to finde any clemencie and pitie in him, who towards his owne naturall children hath manifeſted himſelfe

moſt cruell. Therefore you ought to animate, defend, and ſupport your ſelues with a firme and ſtoute aſſurance, worthie of your former proweſſes,  againſt theſe accidents of Fortune, that ſo you may gaine a glorious life: for things that haue bin done by like tyrants, ought to be tolerated as miſchiefes, which ſuddenly proceed from nature. And ſtay your ſelues vpon the King my Lord and maſter, who will neuer faile to ſend you what poſſible ayde he can, with which he is alreadie become maſter of Albe-iula, Ahnas, Engedin, and Lippa, &amp; hath forced the Turk to recoile &amp; raiſe his Campe from before Themeſuar, conſtraining him in great haſte to auoide this kingdome (which vndoubtedly hee meant then to haue reduced to a miſerable and perpetuall bondage) and preſeruing you in this liberty, in which through his grace and  fauour you liue, and for which both your ſelues and children ſhould be for euer bound to him. And conſidering the aduertiſement that ſhall be giuen to our King of all theſe affayres, expell and baniſh from your idle fancies theſe feares and momentarie conceits, and doe not any whit dread theſe theeues and robbers, which with ſo great furie they menace to ſend vnto you. Beleeue me their armies haue no wings to flie, neither can they ſo readily aſſemble themſelues as they haue writ of. And as once (to our great glorie) wee haue chaſed them out of this Realme, with ſo great loſſe of his people, as cannot well be recounted: ſo I aſſuredly hope, that for the time to come we ſhall againe performe the like, and that with our farre greater praiſe and renowne; and then he in good earneſt taſting of your reſolution, and  ſtoutnes of courage, and inuincible vertue, he leauing you there in peace, will chaunge his intention like fortune, plainly knowing that he hath not to manage warre with effeminate or cowardly people, but with men experienced as well in warre as in peace, and who through the world ſhall yeeld a deare account to him of their perſons, while they doe as reſolute mindes are wont to doe, who being vniuſtly iniuried, and feeling the outrage that they haue receiued, doe for peace willingly imbrace warre.
            
            All the Lords preſent being reanimated by theſe ſpeeches, ſent to tell the The Tranſiluanians reanimated againſt the Turkes. great Turke, Achmeth Baſha, the Moldauian, and the Belerbey of Greece, that they ſhould come no further, becauſe that they were reſolutely determined  to reſiſt them as much as they could, hauing determined together to die in battaile, rather then to liue vnder their lawes. They alſo anſwered the Chiauſs, that they were content to pay him the ordinarie tribute, if ſo it pleaſed the Grand Seigniour to accept of ſuch as was offered him: which if he would not accept, that then he ſhould preſently depart.
            The Chiauſs receiuing this anſwer, and ſeeing he could then accompliſh no other thing, accepted of the ordinarie tribute, which was yeerely 20000. crownes, and ſo retired to Belgrade, and from thence to Conſtantinople, leauing the kingdome free of a great feare and ſuſpition. 
            
            
               Caſtalde hauing thus (though not altogether) gained the hearts of the Tranſiluanians, and confirmed them in the league and deuotion of Ferdinand, retired againe to his accuſtomed aboade at Albe-iula: where he had not been long, but that he had newes how Achmeth (Baſha of Buda) writ

a familiar letter full of a thouſand kind and liberall offers to Patocchy, containing  certaine hidden and ſecret words, as if there had been ſome great intelligence and correſpondence betweene them two. Which the Baſha purpoſely practiſed, to the end that Ferdinand and Caſtalde ſhould vpon that occaſion, iuſtly conceiue ſome miſtruſt againſt him. But his former proceedings being ſufficiently iuſtified, hee was alwaies held and reputed by them very loyall and faithfull, and they committed vnto him the Caſtle of Iula, with the gouernment of the towne, that he might keepe it (as in former time hee had done) faithfully, and therein to remaine his wife and children.
            The Caſtles of Iula, Panchotto, Varadin, and others began to bee in ſome diſtreſſe for want of victuals, and it was moſt neceſſarie to make prouiſion  for them: which was not done without great diſcommoditie, for that they were conſtrained to employ thereupon the money which was appointed for the muſters, and payment of the ſouldiours: ſo that the time to muſter being come, and this ſaid money ſpent in theſe affayres, it was not poſſible to recouer or get any more: and that was the cauſe (as hereafter we ſhall ſpeake) of great tumults, and ſpecially becauſe Vayuode Battor by his indiſpoſition, or for that it ſo pleaſed him, would no longer execute the office of Vayuodſhip, and requeſted that they would prouide themſelues of another therefore, although Caſtalde inſtantly deſired him to continue in this office, which greatly troubled him. 
            
            During theſe troubles, letters came from Ferdinand, by which he commanded them to begin a trial and proceed therein againſt Aldene the Campmaſter, The purſuice againſt Aldene. who was ſtill priſoner, and yt afterwards he ſhuld be ſent to him, with all the proceedings againſt him. Aldene reprouing (as ſuſpected) certaine of the Iudges, required his Maieſtie that his triall might bee referred to others: which being granted him, they began to examine many witneſſes, and concluded his triall, by which in the end he was condemned to die, and euen by the depoſition of many who did proue againſt him the great treacherie and cowardlines which he vſed in abandoning Lippa, he being well able to defend it, who alſo ſet open and declared the great loſſe and damage which he  had committed againſt Ferdinand, in cauſing the Caſtle and Artillerie and all the munition to bee conſumed with fire, which were the materiall cauſes that he was condemned to death for. His triall being thus fully concluded, he was ſent to Vienna with the ſentence of the Iudges: which being allowed by his Maieſtie, declared that he ſhould be ſent vnder a ſure guard, who preſently after, according to that commaund, was ſurely conducted in chaines to Vienna, where hee remained priſoner ſo long, that the continuance thereof in the end was the cauſe (as hereafter wee ſhall ſpeake) of his libertie. Queene Izabella practiſeth her returne into Tranſiluania. Peter Vicchy and Chendy for Izabella.
            
            In the meane while, Queene Izabella was not any thing idle, but practiſed  all the meanes ſhe could to reenter againe with her ſonne, greatly aſſiſting her ſelfe by the meanes and fauour of Peter Vicchy, and Chendy Ference, and other principall men, who ſecretly affected her cauſe. And although Ferdinand
               
writ to her, that he was readie at all times to performe that which he  promiſed her, and beſides to giue her the Dutchie of Monſterberg, yet ſhe would by no meanes accept any whit thereof, ſaying, that ſince within the preſixed time the premiſed bargaines and agreements were not of his part performed, ſhe for her part meant no leſſe to obſerue and keepe them, and that ſhe was determined againe to haue her owne. Vpon which, there was newes that the Sicilians intended ſome treacheries with the Turks in her fauour, and that they had ſent ſome priuately to her, to reſtore Iohn into his kingdome. By occaſion of theſe tumults there was a Diet aſſigned at Poſſouia, wherein the people of the kingdome of Tranſiluania greatly cōplained Euill intreatie cauſed the rebellion of the Tranſiluaniās againſt Ferdinand. of the griefes and wrongs which they daily endured, as wel by the warre and  fortifications, as alſo for the inſolencies which they receiued by Ferdinands ſouldiours, importuning to haue redreſſe thereof, and not to taske them with ſuch impoſitions; promiſing if he did ſo, not to faile his Maieſtie, but willingly to take armes againſt the Turkes, and valiantly to defend themſelues againſt them, and ſincerely to maintaine the dutie and homage which they had ſworne to his Maieſtie. Vpon theſe complaints and demaunds, Ferdinand cauſed them to bee anſwered, that he would not faile as much as he could, to eaſe them of that burthen, and that he would cauſe it to appeare vnto them, that his pleaſure was no other but alwaies to ayde and defend them againſt the violence of the common enemie; againſt whom they ſhould not for all that faile to take armes, as he for his part would not bee  wanting to ſend them forces, and to come in his owne perſon (if neceſſitie did ſo require it) for their deliuerie, or elſe to ſend them the King of Bohemia his ſonne; that preſently he would giue order to all thoſe inconueniences of which they complained, and that in the meane time they ſhould not omit to perſiſt in the faith and deuotion wherein they had vntill then continued, and that there ſhould be no fault in him, but that he would vſe them as moſt loyall and faithfull ſubiects. Whereupon euery one held himſelfe well contented with theſe promiſes. Yet for all that, theſe humours ſlided not out of their braines, but increaſed more and more, ſpecially becauſe it was manifeſt that Bartholmew Coruatte (who had the guard of Iula with two Germane  companies) badly behaued himſelfe in this towne, ſpoyling, murthering, and killing the poore inhabitants thereof, preaching to them the Lutheran religion, with which opinion he was infected. To remedie which, Caſtalde was conſtrained to depute Paul Banchy in that quarter for Vice Vayuode, and commaund Coruatte to depart out of Iula, and ſent him farre off, leauing the charge of this towne to Francis Patocchy, who bore himſelfe ſo familiarly amongſt the inhabitants, that they found themſelues greatly reioyced and comforted therewith.
            If on this ſide Ferdinands ſouldiours did miniſter exceeding griefe and  diſquiet to Caſtalde, they yet on the other ſide gaue him daily more and more for want of pay, he being greatly tormented by Duke Mauris for the payment of his ſouldiours that was due to them, from the time that the ſiege was raiſed from before Agria, he neuer hauing receiued any ſeruice from

them, but rather great damage and infinit ruine through the whole Realme.  For the redreſſe and diſpatch of which (although the winter was come) he Duke Mauris diſmiſſed. meant indeede fully to content him, and to diſſolue his armie, which was diſmiſſed from Iauerin, and there was put therein another garriſon. This was the cauſe, that he being deſirous to keepe his word with this Duke, he could not then ſatisfie with pay his owne Campe which he had in Tranſiluania, of which, for that it was compoſed of the vaſſals and ſubiects of his king and that countrie, he had more aſſurance in their patience, then in the other which were ſtraungers and not ſubiect to him, who at their departure, although they were well payed, yet for all that they deſiſted not from committing great inormities. And although Caſtalde did what poſſibly he could  to keepe his ſouldiours in peace, prouiding them of good lodgings, and cauſing to bee diſtributed through the countrie ordinarie victuall, more then was ſufficient, yet could he not ſo farre preuaile with them, as to cauſe them to deſiſt from, or giue ouer their mutinies, conſpiracies, or other horrible miſchiefes, which did not onely hurt in particular, but alſo in generall: becauſe that the inhabitants of the countrie receiuing ſuch iniuries, hated and abhorred them greatly, and they ſpake of nothing elſe, but that occaſion would offer it ſelf for them to take armes, and giue them cauſe to vnderſtand their fault, by the maſſacring which in time they hoped to execute vpon them, all of them earneſtly deſiring (that they might the better wade out  of ſuch calamities) the returning of Iohn into his kingdome. By reaſon of ſuch miſchiefes, many Captaines and principals of the countrie, who in former time had been Ferdinands friends, became ſecretly his deadly enemies, and raunged themſelues on Queene Izabellaes partie, not a little increaſing her forces and faction, which procured to Caſtalde infinit diſcontent.
            Now, as Fortune in this quarter managed the actions of mortall men, ſhe (in better manner then men could think for) diſpoſed of them about Deua, becauſe that thoſe who were in garriſon in this towne, hauing intelligence The garriſon of Deua put in route ſome Turkiſh companies. that by the commaund of Caſſombech, two companies of Turkiſh horſe were  departed out of Lippa, to enter, harrie, and ſpoyle in Tranſiluania, they put themſelues in order for an ambuſcado, and to fight with them as they ſhould paſſe through difficult places. And hauing thus diſpoſed of their people, the Caualarie of Caſſombech preſented themſelues with a greedie deſire to pill and burne ſome neighbour places: and being now arriued at the paſſage, where they were expected, it was ſuddenly charged on all ſides, and they all fighting a certaine time, not knowing who ſhould haue the beſt, in the end the Turkes finding themſelues in the middeſt of the other ſouldiours (who vntill then kept themſelues cloſe) began to retire themſelues, and to leaue the victory to thoſe of Deua, who omitted not to purſue them euen within ſight  of Lippa, and ſlew of them 300. and tooke many priſoners. Our people being incouraged at this good fortune, and not ſatisfying themſelues with that which they ſo happely achieued, paſſed further with incurtions into the enemies countrie, ſacking ſome villages, &amp; pilling all which came to their hands,

performing ſuch warlike exploits, that beſides the conqueſt of the priſoners,  and bootie which was not ſmall, they put all that quarter in ſuch a dread, that the Turkes a long time after durſt not come to doe iniurie to the Tranſiluanians: for that they ſtill diſtruſted themſelues of ſome intended ſtratagems. By this defeate (which was all the good that happened this yeere 1552.) the arrogancie and raſhnes of the enemy was bridled: but not that of Ferdinands ſouldiours, which daily increaſed, hauing no reſpect neither to Generall, Colonels, Captaines, nor any diuine or humane thing, minding by their diſloyaltie to make themſelues maſters of their phantaſies, and to goe euery where, without expecting the appointment and commaund of his Maieſtie, or the leaue of Caſtalde, as more  amply we ſhall treate of in the ſucceſſes which happened in the yeere 1553.

                  THe Tranſiluanians ſolicite Queene Izabella to returne into Tranſiluania, and Caſtalde (for the remedie thereof) appointeth a Diet at Coloſuar. The Spaniards mutinie, and ſeeke to depart Tranſiluania. Aldene is brought to Vienna, whither Caſtalde (by Ferdinands appointment) alſo commeth: vpon whoſe departure out of Tranſiluania, the Tranſiluantans riſe in armes in the behalfe of the Queene. Aldene condemned, but is ſaued by fauour. Caſtalde leaueth the ſeruice of Ferdinand, and returneth againe to the Emperour Charles. The hiſtorie of the death of Muſtapha, eldeſt ſonne of Solyman.

               THe winter was now alreadie in a manner at the extreameſt, &amp; towards the end of Februarie in the yeere 1553.  when the Peeres and Lords of Tranſiluania not minding Anno 1553. any longer to ſuffer the Germanes and Spaniards amongſt them, nor hauing now no more meanes to victuall them, as vſually they had done; they began ſecretly to ſend Ambaſſadours to Queene Izabella, to negotiate with her concerning her returne into this Prouince: The Tranſiluanians ſolicite Queene Izabella to returne into Tranſiluania. whereunto Peter Vicchy, Chendy, and others were greatly aſſiſting. Caſtalde hauing notice of all this, and being thereof well aſſured, gaue preſent aduertiſement thereof to Ferdinand, who alſo preſently did not forget on  his part to vſe all diligence to withſtand and preuent theſe practiſes, ſending Alphonſe (nephew to Caſtalde) to the King of Polonia, and to Queene Bonna her mother, and to Queene Ioane, to intreate them to vſe ſpeedie meanes to diuert theſe clowdes which were thundring in the ayre. Ferdinand alſo

ſent letters from Vienna to Queene Izabella, by which he offered her to performe  all that which was accorded betweene them, and ſpecially certaine other articles or demaunds made by her, to which his Maieſtie before would not accord. And the better to effect this buſines, he writ againe to Francis Chendy, and to Thomas Varcocchy, deſiring them to importune the Queene ſo much, that ſhe would content her ſelfe with that which was agreed vpon, ſince that whatſoeuer was done, was not but to the profit of her and her ſonne Iohn, and to the increaſing of both their commodities. Theſe two Lords made ſemblance as though they allowed it, and faining to ſhew their vttermoſt abilitie for Ferdinand, did altogether to the contrarie. And the Queene on the one ſide gaue good words, and on the other ſhe haſtened  her affayres as well as ſhe could; the Turke hauing alreadie commaunded the Vayuode of Moldauia that he ſhould prepare himſelfe with all his beſt meanes to enter into Tranſiluania, and to Caſſombech to doe the like, leauing as many men as he could in the low countries, and to fauour and aſſiſt the Queenes affayres, and to vſe their vttermoſt abilitie to reinſtall King Iohn into his kingdome, adding to his commaund, that if he could not compaſſe the effect of this enterpriſe, yet at the leaſt he ſhould vſe the meanes to increaſe in this Prouince his Sangiacſhip, promiſing him ſuccours from Buda.
            
               Caſtalde being aduertiſed of all theſe deuiſes, that he might the better remedie them, and not ſuffer them to take further footing, appointed that the  principall Lords of the kingdome, ſhould vpon the 15. of March next, bee at the Diet of Coloſuar, to acquaint them with that which Ferdinand had commaunded them. Before the meeting of this Diet, Andrew Battor (who againe was confirmed in the eſtate of Vayuod, and withall was made Counte of Zalmar and Zalboc) hauing aſſembled a good troupe of men among the neighbour townes and Caſtles, and hauing vnderſtood that certaine companies of Turkiſh Caualarie made ſome incurtions, pilling and burning all the villages, and minding to expulſe them, hee cauſed his people to goe into the field, and to march towards the enemie. But in the end comming to handie ſtrokes, not farre from Agria, he was ſo hotly charged, that  ſome of his people quitted the place, and others remained there either ſlaine or taken priſoners: and amongſt others, ſome of his houſehold ſeruants and familiar fauourits were taken; to redeeme whom, Caſtalde was forced to giue to the Baſha of Buda a Chiauſs, &amp; a Mahometaine Prieſt, who were taken at the death of Frier George, and detained priſoners in the Caſtle of Wiuar, and to exchange them (by Ferdinands commaund) with the ſaid fauourits, who by this meanes recouered their libertie.
            By reaſon of this diſorder, the Vayuod intreated Ferdinand that he would giue him the meanes and inable him to entertaine 1000. light horſe, of the number of thoſe which he payed in Tranſiluania: which was wholly granted  to him, and beſides 1000. foote, that ſo he might be the better able to affront the Turkes forces in thoſe quarters. Ferdinand alſo gaue him charge to conclude an end of a diſcord among the people called Cumans, who hauing been vnder the iuriſdiction of Zaluoch, would not (ſeeing that this

Fortreſſe was reduced vnder the Turkes puiſſance) be vnder that of Agria,  but rather vnder that of Varadin. In the end, by the diligence of Caſtalde and the Vayuode, they were content to be obedient to Agria.
            Now whileſt that the Turke was greatly buſied by the Sophy, and that he conuerted his forces for the defence of Amaſia, into which the Perſians were entered, they began againe (by the meanes and interpoſing of Haly 
               The renewing of the procuring of peace. Chlauſs) to negotiate the truce betweene Ferdinand and Solyman, there being ſafe conduct graunted both from the one and other, to ſend Ambaſſadours to either partie. There being for this purpoſe ſome appointed on both ſides, it was in the end perceiued, that nothing elſe was done, but to entertaine the Tranſiluanians in ſome hope, whileſt that the Turkes ſhould diſpatch their other intangled affayres, that afterwards they might aſſaile them,  according to their accuſtomed manner. For they had aduertiſement how Caſſombech (at the inſtance of the Queene) had aſſembled about him many Sangiacchs, and that with the troupes which daily came to him, hee meant to march directly to Deua, to reuenge himſelfe of the loſſes which he had receiued of our people, and withall to make himſelfe maſter of that place, to the end that ſo he might not haue any impeachment that might croſſe his proceedings. Hereupon Caſtalde cauſed the Diet to be ſolicited, and earneſtly to perſwade all thoſe that ſhould be preſent thereat, to giue order that euery one ſhould take armes, and ayde this towne and others, and ſpecially to march to the frontiers which diuide Polonia from Tranſiluania, where it  was ſaid, that there were 12000. Pollacques well armed, whoſe enterpriſe was knowne to be no other, but onely that they were there for the ayde of Queene Izabella.
            
            The appointed day then for the Diet being come, Caſtalde was preſent at A Diet at Coloſuar. Coloſuar, where he found al thoſe who were called thither, except the Vayuode, who in reſpect of his ſicknes was excuſed, and there (by the expreſſe commaund of Ferdinand) hee demaunded of the Tranſiluanians ayde of men, to ſuppreſſe all theſe tumults, which couertly were diſperſed in euery place, and to defend Deua and other places: he alſo demaunded money and victuals, to make at the leaſt a reaſonable armie, and ſuch, that with his people  which then he had, he might bee able in many places to reſiſt his enemies. Beſides, he demaunded of them Pioners, to finiſh the fortifications of Sibinio, Albe-iula, and Saſſebeſſe, admoniſhing them to attempt it, whileſt the meanes were on foote, to obtaine ſome truce of the Turke.
            Vpon which demaunds, he was thus anſwered: that becauſe the kingdome was by a long warre ſorely afflicted and diſtreſſed, and euery man reduced to extreame miſerie, they could not ſuccour him with money, nor victuals, becauſe that in the laſt winter they were all ſpent and conſumed by the ſouldiours: and as for the ayde of men, they would aſſiſt him therewith as farre as they could; notwithſtanding it being neceſſarie that Ferdinand 
                ſhould ſend ſome other ſuccours from Germanie or Hungarie to reſiſt the Turke: for that this Prouince was not of it ſelfe ſufficient to withſtand ſo great an aſſault, which on euery ſide would be giuen, and ſpecially towards Lippa, Braſſouia, and Hungarie, where in euery place it was very requiſit to

haue a great armie, infinit heapes of money, and great ſtore of victuals to entertaine  them: which by no meanes could not be found in this countrie, by reaſon of the extreame pouertie thereof, and ſpecially of labourers, which in regard of the continuall warres were either dead or fled. And as concerning that which they were able to do, he well knew that all was in his power to commaund; they beſides not iudging it vnfit to giue ſome repoſe to this diſcontented people, to imbrace truce with the Turkes, whereto they willingly offered themſelues, and they promiſed on their parts to chuſe Ambaſſadours to treate thereof with the Grand Seigniour, by the meanes of the Vayuode of Tranſalpinia, who for the ſame effect had many times offered himſelfe to them. And as for the fortifications of thoſe places alreadie begun,  they would ſpeake thereof to the Burgomaſters of thoſe townes, that they would do ſo much, that they ſhould ſend ſo many Pioners as was needfull for the finiſhing of them.
            With this reſolution this Diet ended, when the Spaniards for two payes which they ſhould haue receiued, were more moued and mutinous then before, The Spaniards mutinie. and that in ſo ſtrange a manner as the like was neuer heard of. For refuſing the payment, and not minding to ſtay that they might bee ſatisfied in that kingdome for all that which was due to them, they tooke by force the Enſignes from thoſe who bore them, and with them took their way towards Vienna, paſſing through Hungarie, where they performed infinit euils, committing the greateſt riot in the world. And although that Castalde (that he  might haue brought this warre to an end) was daily vpon his departure out of Tranſiluania, yet he neuer could, neither by entreaties, nor by offers, or perſwſions ſo farre preuaile with them, as that they would attend him but twentie daies, to the end that he might not leaue the kingdome vnprouided, and that for the time to come he might giue order to thoſe places which had neede of garriſons, and generally to doe before his departure, all whatſoeuer appertained to the preſeruation of that countrie.
            But without reſpect to their Generall they diſlodged, and paſſed by Coloſuar, threatning to ſacke this towne, who were greatly afeard thereof, although that Caſtalde was within it. And being arriued at the riuer of Marque,  
               Ferdinand was exceedingly offended thereat, and meant to ſend the Marqueſſe Sforce Palauicin (who was alreadie redeemed from the Turkes for 15000. Duckets) with all his people to haue cut them in peeces, and ſeuerely to chaſtiſe the authors of this ſo great a ſedition. But he being appeaſed by by ſome, ſent to tell theſe Spaniards, that they ſhould repayre to Papau, where they ſhould bee ſatisfied of all their pay, as within a while after they were.
            A little before that Aldene was conducted to Vienna, and was impriſoned Aldene brought to Vienna. in a tower, Ferdinand minding that his condemnation ſhould not be executed vntill Caſtaldes comming, to whom he had giuen licenſe to depart out of  this Prouince, and to come from thence to Vienna, or to Sopronio. Whereto Caſtalde retired out of Tranſiluania, and returned to Ferdinand. he was very willing, leauing this kingdome in the moneth of Aprill, and arriued at Vienna in the end of May, where he was ioyfully receiued by Ferdinand and K. Maximilian, to whom afterward he made a large recitall of all

what was paſſed, to their great content. And becauſe vertue and glorie haue alwaies enuie attending on them, ſome perſons bruited amongſt the greateſt  of Ferdinands Court, that Caſtalde had heaped together a great quantitie of Caſtalde wrongfully accuſed. gold and ſiluer, and that he was not a little inriched by Frier Georges treaſure, and by the preſents which the Tranſiluanians had beſtowed on him, and that he had ſent great ſtore thereof from him. This bruite did greatly grieue him, for that it was come to Ferdinands eares; and yet further for this, that ſome ſaid that he had detained and kept backe penſions and wages which his Maieſtie had granted to certaine that were his truſtie ſeruants, and who had faithfully ſerued him during this warre. Vpon this bad and falſe ſuggeſtion, there was added many other vile and infamous things. By writing and ſpeeches he endeuoured to expell theſe falſe ſuggeſtiōs from Ferdinands conceit,  and from all the principall of his Court, who in reſpect of ſuch an obiect, deferred the recompence which was iuſtly duly to him, for the paine and labour which he had taken in diſcharge of his office: yet ſo it was that in the end he was rewarded with 3000. Florins of gold of yeerely reuenew to him and his heires, with certaine conditions to call them backe vpon ſome reaſonable ſummes.
            Preſently after the departure of Caſtalde out of Tranſiluania, they had newes, that one Clement Athanaſe had (with a good troupe of men aſſotiated with him) by night taken the Caſtle of Tocchay (which by the ſituation  
               Tocchay. thereof and art is very ſtrong) and that he durſt attempt with ladders to ſurpriſe The Tranſiluanians riſe in the behalfe of Queene Izabella. the towne of Agria, from whence he was repulſed by the inhabitants, in ſuch manner that he could not enterpriſe any thing vpon it: this being attempted by the commaund of Queene Izabella, and her ſonne Iohn. They had alſo newes how Peter Vicchy was accorded with the Turkes, and how he being accompanied with all his adherents, he tooke the way towards Lippa, with intention (in the Queenes name) to ſurpriſe the towne of Deua and Iula, and doe his vttermoſt endeuour in this, that it might returne to her, and that ſhe might reenter into the kingdome. This man had great meanes, and vnder his colour many great matters were practiſed, which gaue ſufficient  occaſion to Ferdinand to thinke deeply thereof, who was ſufficiently informed how all the Realme inclined to the Queenes part. The Saxons to haue ſome ſhadow to remoue their houſehold, cauſed to bee demaunded of his Maieſtie the Caſtle of Aluins, which, they ſaid, did (according to their priuiledges) belong to them, and they requeſted that it might be confirmed to them by him. That he might not diſcontent them in this their demaund, but rather to hold them aſſured to him in ſome ſound fidelitie, and that hee might not giue them occaſion to mutinie, he yeelded to their demaund; and preſently they of Iula, Agria, and other places were commaunded, that they ſhould be vigilant and carefull, and not ſleepie or ſlothfull, for feare of being ſuddenly ſurpriſed by the Queenes partie, who ceaſed not to performe  her vttermoſt endeuour, that euery one ſhould take armes againſt the Officers, Gouernours, and Lieutenants of Ferdinand.
            
            During theſe proceedings, it was ordained that the proceſſe of Aldene 
               Aldene condemned to death, &amp; ſaued by fauour. ſhould be renued, and that the ſentence ſhould haue his full and entire effect,

if the accuſations were found true. This reuiuing being at a certaine day ended,  the firſt ſentence, was by this ſecond confirmed, and by conſequence Aldene condemned to haue his head cut off. The preſcribed day being come to end his life, he was in the ſight of all Vienna led chained betweene two Friers (who did comfort him) to the place of iuſtice, hauing the executioner by, and was there vpon a ſcaffold to be beheaded. Mary Queene of Bohemia, and daughter of the Emperour Charles the 5. becauſe he was a Spaniard and ſubiect to her father, preuailed ſo much with the King her husband, that he requeſted pardon of Ferdinand for him, with this condition neuertheleſſe, that he ſhould alwaies remaine priſoner. This fauour being thus granted, Aldene had his life ſaued, and within a while after by the ſame meanes  was wholly ſet at libertie, againſt Caſtaldes liking, who (to the end he might giue example to others, and to cauſe them learne by the negligence and cowardlines of Aldene, how they ſhould be hardie, reſolute, and couragious, imitating Torquatus) ſolicited that he ſhould be publikely puniſhed.
            Now whileſt Caſtalde recreated himſelfe with Ferdinand, ſometimes being with him in hunting, ſometimes purſuing the Harts along Danubius, (which to ſaue themſelues from the dogges, tooke ſoyle therein) letters came to him from the Emperour Charles, by which he commaunded him, that ſeeing the Tranſiluanian warres were ended, he ſhould preſently depart from Vienna, and iourney into Flanders (where he was greatly troubled by the people of King Henry of France) that ſo he might vſe him in this warre. The  Emperour alſo writ to Ferdinand, how he had taken Hedin from the French Hedin taken by the Emperour Charles from the French. King, which is a place ſituate vpon the confines of Artois in the Low Countries, againſt which he had brought a puiſſant armie, and had enuironed it with his Campe, and battered it on all ſides, and that in the end he had taken it, notwithſtanding the marueilous defence of the aſſieged, making a great myne, wherein was buried Horatius Farneſe Duke of Caſtres, and that he had cauſed it to bee ruinated and defaced, euen to the foundations, there being priſoners with him the Duke of Bouillon Marſhall of France Lieutenant in the ſame for the King, the Lord of Riou Gouernour, the Counte of Villars, the Lord of Prye, the Baron of Culan, and many others; there being beſides  ſlaine, the Lord of Magny, the Vicount of Martigues, the Lord of Moninuille, the Lord of Cizieux, the Lord of Dampierre, the Seneſhal of Caſtres, and many others. For this newes, and the taking of Terouanne, which a little before was beſieged, were great fires of ſolemnitie made at Vienna, and many ſuch-like exhilerations: at the end whereof, Caſtalde (to obey the Emperour) tooke leaue of Ferdinand, and after being greatly honoured by Caſtalde returned to the Emperour in Flanders. him with many priuiledges, and inriched with many gifts, for the great valour which he had ſhewen in Tranſiluania againſt the Turkes, he trauailed towards Germanie, at the time that the warre of Sienna began to ceaſe, by  meanes of Pope Iulius the 3.
            In the Eaſterne parts Solyman was no leſſe inflamed to the warre, then was Charles the 5. againſt France. He (as wee haue ſaid) in the yeere 1552. The hiſtorie of the death of Muſtapha, Solymans eldeſt ſonne. cauſed euery where to be publiſhed (to get Muſtapha his eldeſt ſonne into his hands) that the Perſians were entered into Amaſia and Syria, and had

ſacked many townes, and ſpoyled a great circuite of the plaine countrie, leading with them priſoners the poore inhabitants, and ruinating al which they  incountred. Vpon theſe newes he cauſed to be diuulged that he ſhould be forced to goe in perſon into Amaſia, and to ſend Roſtan Baſha with a ſtrong armie into Syria, to force them to retire. But this deuice was to no other end, but ſpeedily to haue the ſaid Muſtapha into his commaund, and to aſſure himſelfe of his Empire and life, by putting him to death. But before wee come to this narration, it is neceſſarie that I recite ſome things of time paſt, that I may the more orderly deſcent to that which commeth now to be treated of, and to cauſe men better to vnderſtand the cauſe that moued Solyman ſo cruelly to hate ſo vertuous and magnanimious a ſonne. 
            
            
               Solyman then hauing had this Muſtapha his eldeſt ſonne, by a ſlaue of Circaſsia, 
               Muſtapha the eldeſt ſonne of Solyman. he gaue him the gouernment of the Prouince of Amaſia, the better to maintaine himſelfe and his mother. This yong Prince daily increaſing with corporall abilitie, and with vertues of the minde, gaue of himſelfe great expectation to all thoſe who ſaw him, aſſuring themſelues that one day he would proue a moſt valiant Captaine and couragious Lord. This infant being departed from Conſtantinople, and arriued in this Prouince, the Grand Seigniour began to be enamoured of another of his Slaues, named Roſſa, ſo Roſſa beloued of Solyman. hotly, that with the daily conuerſation he had with her, he ſaw by her foure children, the one named Mahomet, who had the Prouince of Carmania; the  other Baiazet, to whom was giuen Mechoreſia; the third Selim, who after the Mahomet, Baiazet, Selim, Zeangir, children of Solyman by Roſſa. death of Mahomet had Carmania; and the fourth Zeangir, otherwiſe called crookbacke, by reaſon of two knobs he had vpon his ſhoulders and breaſt, and he was of an excellent ſpirit. He had alſo a daughter named Chameria, who was giuen in mariage to Roſtan Baſha, who after the death of Abraham 
               Chameria daughter of Solyman maried Roſtan Baſha. Baſha was principall Viſir. This man made himſelfe very odious to all the world in this office, becauſe had cut off the pay of the Ianiſaries, the wages of the officers of the Grand Seigniours houſe, the charges of armies, and the eſtate of Sangiachs; all theſe charges being very burdenſome and exceſſiue. But in ſtead thereof he was very well liked of Solyman, and much in his fauour,  for vſing ſuch frugalitie, and not in the fauour of Muſtapha, of whom he did greatly diſtruſt himſelfe for the traine which he had, and for the loue which the ſouldiours bore him. This diſtruſt and feare were the cauſe that he enterpriſed a conſpiracie with Roſſa his mother in law againſt the life of Muſtapha, by the deceit and treacherie which wee ſhall now ſpeake of. This Roſſa ſeeing how dearely ſhe was beloued of the great Turke, to aduance her children by a policie, and vnder a fained colour and zeale of religion, ſent to Muplety (properly called by the Turkes Muphty, who among the Mahometanes Muplety an arch Presbiter of the Mahometanes. is, as the Pope is among the Chriſtians) to ſignifie to him, how ſhe had a marueilous deſire to cauſe a Temple to bee built, and an Hoſpitall alſo for the poore pilgrimes, to the honour of God and of their Prophet: but by no  meanes ſhe would vndertake this worke, vnleſſe that firſt ſhe were aſſured Gods reward for charitable workes done by Slaues, appertaine to their maſters. from him, that ſuch workes ſhould bee beneficiall for her ſoules health and agreeable to God. Muplety anſwered her, that this enterpriſe would bee well pleaſing to God, but not for her ſaluation, for that ſhe was a Slaue of the

Grand Seighiour, who was maſter and Lord of all that ſhe had, and in regard of which his power, all whatſoeuer ſhe ſhould do in this, ſhuld ſucceed to the  good of him, and not of her. Vpon this anſwer ſhe ſeemed very penſiue, and to carrie in her heart extreame griefe, inſomuch, that (ſhe manifeſting in her minde to bee greatly afflicted) the Turke had notice thereof, who moued with the loue he bore her, and with the diſpleaſure of her griefe, ſent her word that ſhe ſhould be of good cheere, aſſuring her that within ſhortime he would giue her occaſion to comfort her ſelfe: whereupon cauſing a letter to bee written for her libertie, he ſent it to her. This ſubtile and craftie woman Roſſa made free. receiuing this gift, well knowing to take fit time and occaſion, gaue him many kinde thanks, and preſently employed workmen about her buildings, abſtaining her ſelfe from carnall copulation with him. While ſhe thus ſpent  the time, the Grand Seigniour had a great deſire to lie with her, commaunding that the night following ſhe ſhould prepare her ſelfe to lie with him. Whereupon ſhe cauſed word to be ſent to him, that though he were the only Lord of her life, of her goods, and of her bodie, he ſhould yet looke well to this (ſeeing he had made her free) that he did not contradict the law, nor To vſe a free woman is ſin. commit a ſinne; it not being lawfull for him to vſe a free woman, as more at large he might know of Muplety. This anſwer was greatly offenſiue to the Grand Seigniour. For louing her extreamely, the more ſtrict the prohibition was, the more his deſire increaſed to be with her, and gnawing his heart with a thouſand imaginations, ſent to ſeeke Muplety, of whom he demanded  whither he might carnally vſe a Slaue that was made free. The other made anſwer, that he might not, except he would take her for his ſpouſe: for that doing otherwiſe he ſhould commit a great ſinne, by reaſon of the law, which willed it ſhould bee ſo. This difficultie yet further increaſed a deſire in the Turke to enioy his Roſſa. And by that meanes, not being able any long to tolerate the paſſion which tormented him, he determined to ſatisfie, not his reaſon, but his appetites, and reſolued to take her for his ſpouſe, as publikely Roſſa made the ſpouſe of Solyman. he did, giuing her by the contract of mariage 5000. Duckets of yeerely reuenew for her dowrie, to the great maruaile of all, who knew that to be againſt the cuſtome of the Ottomans, who becauſe they would neuer haue any companion  
               The Turkiſh Emperours neuer marrie. in the Empire, doe neuer marrie, but in place of a ſpouſe, they vſe women Slaues who are very fayre, which from all parts of the world were brought to them, and they are ſhut vp within the Seraile (according to the cuſtome of the Turkiſh Lords) where they were bountifully vſed and inſtructed in diuers vertuous things: and by theſe the Grand Seigniours haue their children, and thoſe by whom they once haue had children, are more honoured and better ſerued then the other, and afterwards are married to Grand Seigniours of their owne ſect and religion, as are the Baſhaes, Sangiachs, Belerbeys, and ſuch like. Now this Roſſa from a Slaue (by the fauour of heauen and the benefit of Fortune) being become the wife of ſo great a  King, ſhe determined of no other thing, then to inuent the meanes that one of her ſonnes, after the death of Solyman, ſhould remaine inheritour and ſucceſſor of the Empire.
            The greatnes and valour of Muſtapha was much oppoſit to her deſeignes,

and to abate this inconuenience, ſhe thought that it was needfull to aſſiſt her  ſelfe by the helpe of Roſtan Baſha her ſonne in law, as of one that would rather Roſſa practiſeth the death of Muſtapha. deſire that his brother in law might be Lord, then Muſtapha, who bore him an euill grudge, for that he had cut off the reuenew which he was wont to haue out of his Prouince: by reaſon whereof he could not but doubt, that when the Turke dyed, and this man ſucceeding in his place, he would not onely depriue him from the dignitie of a Viſir, but alſo of his goods and life.
            Hauing then drawne him to her deuotion, and being accorded together, ſhe effected ſo much with the Grand Seigniour, that her ſonne in law had Roſtan Baſha conſpireth with Roſſa, the death of Muſtapha. the managing of all the affayres and expeditions of that Prouince where Muſtapha commanded, impreſſing afterward in the minde of Solyman, with  a fit and ſubtell inuention, a great diſtruſt to loſe both his ſtate and life, eſpecially by reaſon of Muſtaphaes greatnes, &amp; the good wil which euery one did beare him. For confirmation of which, Roſtan commaunded all thoſe who were choſen to goe into the Prouinces, and ſpecially thoſe who went into Ionia, a neighbour Prouince to Amaſia, that for the contentment of the Grand Seigniour, they ſhould write and make knowne particularly the proceedings of Muſtapha, and his honours, to the end that he might take pleaſure therein, and that they ſhould highly commend him in certifying all the good they could of him. Which they did (not knowing the deceit) very willingly and often alſo: ſo that by their letters they cleerely diſcerned the  deſire which the ſouldiours had, that one day he might for his liberalitie become their Emperour. Roſtan after he had receiued ſuch letters, gaue them to Roſſa, to the end, that according to the oportunitie and occaſion of the time, ſhe might ſhew them to the Turke. She in ſhewing them theſe letters (as a ſubtell and malicious woman) made great ſhew to be exceedingly contented at the generoſitie and valiantnes of Muſtapha, and to be very reſpectiue of his life and health: and then on the other ſide, as being carefull of the preſeruation and puiſſance of her Lord and ſpouſe, by wilie and ſubtell meanes ſhe propounded to him the example of Selim, who by the like craft and induſtrie, depriued his father both of his Empire and life, deſiring him  to finde the meanes to diſcouer the deſeignes of Muſtapha. But for this time her deuices tooke no great effect in Solyman, and ſhe ſeeing that they came to nothing, thought to make him away by poyſon, and ſending him in his fathers name certaine preſents, gaue charge to ſome to carrie them to him. But for that the houre of his death was not yet come, he would at no hand taſte thereof, vntill the bringer had firſt made an aſſay, who preſently fell downe ſtone dead: for which cauſe he made them to bee caſt away, and ſo eſcaped the death. This treacherie falling out contrarie to the deſire of Roſſa, yet for all that ſhe loſt no courage, but inuented another, deſiring her Lord that he would doe her this fauour, that ſometimes one, and ſometimes another of  his children might come to the Court to ſee him, and after that returne againe into their gouernment, thereby the rather to continue a reciprocall amitie betweene him and his children. This deuice tended to this end, that Muſtapha comming thither, ſhould with better commoditie bee diſpatched

by ſome maner of meanes whatſoeuer, and not comming thither he ſhould  be ſent for. For the eldeſt ſonnes of the Turkiſh Emperours are not accuſtomed The eldeſt ſonnes of the Turkiſh Emperours remaine not at the Court. to depart out of their Prouinces to come to Conſtantinople, except they bee ſent for to bee made Emperours with a ſtrong and puiſſant armie: which they are not wont to doe, ſo long as the father liueth. Neuertheleſſe ſhe obtained that two of his children ſhould come thither: and thus alwaies was one or two with Solyman, either in the towne, or in the armie, or in ſome other place where hee was. Zeangir the crookbacke, was oftner there then any of them, for that he was pleaſant and merrie, and one that could fit all humours well, whereat the Grand Seigniour tooke great pleaſure.
            Now certaine yeeres after, Fortune (enuious of Muſtaphaes magnanimitie, and fauouring the wickednes of this woman) cauſed a letter to bee  brought from the Baſha the gouernour of Muſtapha and of Amaſia; it being The inſtructiō of the Turkiſh Emperours ſonnes. the cuſtome, that when a ſonne of the Grand Seigniour goeth into any gouernment, to giue him a Baſha to inſtruct him in Militarie diſcipline, and a Doctor to teach him the liberall Arts, and other good erudiments. It was imported by this letter, that a mariage ſhould bee treated of betweene the ſaid Muſtapha and the daughter of the King of Perſia, whereof this Baſha did diligently aduertiſe the Court and the Grand Seigniour, to the end that not any thing ſhould be imputed to him, as if he had participated in this affayre. This letter being come into the hands of Roſtan, eſteeming that this was a ſubiect very fit for him to ouerthrow Muſtapha withall, acquainted  
               Roſſa with all the matter, with whom he hauing conferred of that which they ſhould doe, they went both together to the Turke, ſhewing him the ambition of Muſtapha, and that he had a purpoſe to inueſt himſelfe in the Empire, and by the affinitie contained in this letter, to ioyne the Perſian armies with his, that ſo he might the better expulſe him from Conſtantinople, adding at the end the little faith which was to be hoped of the Ianiſaries, becauſe they were corrupted by his great bountie. Theſe ſo euident reaſons were with words full of ſuch great efficacie pronounced by them, that they ſo moued Solyman, that to aſſure his kingdome and life, he determined to put his ſonne to death, and according to this reſolution he cauſed Roſtan Baſha  to march before with a great armie towards Syria, with commaund and expreſſe charge (vnder the colour to driue away the Perſians) to ſeaze vpon the perſon of Muſtapha by ſome ſubtell dexteritie, and to conduct him to him. Roſtan being come to the enterance of this Prouince, and Muſtapha hauing vnderſtood of his comming, preſently marched towards him with 7000. of the valianteſt ſouldiours that he had. Roſtan ſeeing that then his enterpriſe could take no good iſſue, bruiting it abroad that he found all things in good tranquilitie, returned without any further expecting the comming of Muſtapha, or without ſeeing the duſt of his ſouldiours, and returned from  thence to Conſtantinople with more then ordinarie ſpeede: where being arriued, he recited to the Grand Seigniour all that which was happened to him, and giuing colour to that which hee had alreadie practiſed with Roſſa, he cauſed him to redouble his feare, telling him, that hauing found the armie which he led with him into Syria moſt readie and willing, and at the

deuotion of Muſtapha, and they deſired no other thing, but only that he were  abſolute Lord; he by this occaſion meant not to truſt them to giue him any battaile, nor hazard any thing, by reaſon of the incredible good will which all the Ianiſaries bore him, but that he thought it more expedient to returne from thence, and ſubmit all vnder the aduice and iudgement of his Maieſtie, as he did. Theſe ſpeeches ingendered in Solymans heart a moſt great indignation, and were the cauſe to bring to end that treaſon thus wrought againſt this innocent yong man.
            This then being the yeere 1553. he commaunded that all the ſouldiours Anno 1553. ſhould aſſemble, and that Achmeth Baſha of Buda, with all the prouiſion of Hungarie, ſhould march towards Amaſia, to bring to end the Perſian warre, it being expreſſely euery where bruited abroad, that the Perſians were afreſh  entered into Syria, with many great troupes, Solyman ſet himſelfe onward on his iourney with all his armie: and being there arriued, he preſently cauſed letters to be writ to Muſtapha, that he ſhould come to him at Aleppo; and endeuouring to conceale the hate, which through others malignitie he bore to his ſonne, yet could he not ſo well diſſemble it, but that Achmeth Baſha, as of better iudgement then the other Baſhaes were, did perceiue it, and conceiuing great diſpleaſure that the father ſhould be thus incenſed againſt his ſonne, becauſe he was too generous, ſecretly aduertiſed Muſtapha, that he ſhould looke well to himſelfe and his life, and not be too ſecure. This did greatly aſtoniſh the poore yong man, and the rather, conſidering the comming  of his father with ſo puiſſant an armie into that countrie, without any reaſonable occaſion, the Perſians being then with them quiet and in peace; and he entering into great ſuſpition, was many daies greatly tormented: in the end, although he was extreamely troubled in his minde and bodie, aſſuring himſelfe vpon his innocencie, that he had neuer offended his father neither by deede, word, or thought, he was reſolued (although he knew his death very certaine) with all obedience to performe the commaund of his father, iudging his death would be more glorious and honourable, dying obedient, The diuine reſolution of Muſtapha. then ending his life in rebellion, and contrarie to him. And hauing thus determined with himſelfe, his Doctor being by him, after many  thoughts, he demaunded of him, which were beſt for a man to chuſe, either the Empire of the whole world, or a happie life. This Doctor anſwered him, that he who with an vpright eye could contemplate the Empire of the world, ſhould finde that it would bring with it no conſtant fidelitie, but only vaine ſhewes, and that hee ſhould continually liue therein with infinit trauaile and diſtruſt, and be conſtrained to commit diuers inſolencies, murthers, deſtruction of townes and cities, and ruines of many miſerable perſons: for which miſchiefes a man ſhould loſe a happie life. But in chuſing a bleſſed life, a man ſhould auoide all theſe diſaſters, and to thoſe (who haue this grace to know humane frailtie, and the breuity of our life, in renouncing  the vanities of this world) God had prepared in heauen (as for his well beloued) a ſweete and delectable place, full of all immortall ioy, where they ſhould remaine perpetually with the bleſſed.
            This anſwer greatly contented this yong man, and within a while after, in

great diligence he arriued where his father was, who was incamped three daies iourney from Aleppo, in a large field. By this ſo ſudden arriuall of Muſtapha, 
                
               Solyman was the more perplexed, and had a greater diſtruſt, not thinking that he would haue come ſo ſoone. Roſtan vpon this occaſion failed not againe, and commaunded by ſignes the principals of the armie, and the Ianiaries to goe before Muſtapha, and to doe him honour. Theſe men being (according The Ianiſaries obeying the ſignes of then Commaunders. to their cuſtome) well diſciplined, and obeying their Commaunders, (by whoſe ſignes onely they are conducted and gouerned) went in troupes (thinking to doe that which would bee agreeable to the Turke) to ſalute Muſtapha, and to doe him reuerence, and to performe this, all the Campe remoued. Roſtan ſeeming to bee greatly aſtoniſhed at this, went to Solyman, to aduertiſe him how all the Ianiſaries, and principals of his armie,  without his leaue, were gone to ſee Muſtapha, and to receiue him, with great acclamations and exceſſiue ioyes, and that there reſted to him nothing elſe, but to be Lord; deſiring he would haue care of himſelfe. Solyman changing his colour, and becomming all pale, went out of his Pauilion, and apartly ſaw that to be true, which Roſtan had told him. Many ſay that Muſtapha three daies before his death, had in his ſleepe this viſion a little before the riſing of the Sunne: He thought that a Prophet, apparelled with habits ſhining as the The viſion of Muſtapha prognoſticated his death. Sunne beames, tooke him by the hand, and conducted him into a moſt pleaſant and delightfull place, where was a rich and ſumptuous Palace, with a moſt faire garden, and that then that Prophet ſaid to him, that there they did  remaine and perpetually inioy theſe delights, who were oppoſit to vices, had auoyded iniuſtice, and vertuouſly diſpoſed of all their actions: and afterwards turning him to another ſide, he thought that he ſhewed him two very great riuers, whoſe waters were of the colour of iron and pitch, and it ſeemed that they boyled, within which there were an infinit companie of men which deſcended to the deepe, and after riſing againe, cried pardon, and that then he further ſaid to him, that there were thoſe puniſhed, who whileſt they were liuing, had alwaies vſed iniuſtice and fauoured the wicked, and that he ſhould know that thoſe which he had ſeene there, were Princes, Kings, and great Emperours. And this being ſaid, the viſion vaniſhed away. And becauſe  that the Turkes are the moſt ſuperſtitious men in the world, and ſpecially the Muſulmans (who neuer drinke wine, and giue more credit to dreames, then other men doe) had interpreted by this viſion, that ſome great danger ſhould happen to Muſtapha: and he hauing imparted it to his Doctor, he ſaid to him, after that he well conſidered of the matter, that he greatly diſtruſted of his life, and that therefore he required him to looke well to himſelfe. This yong man neuertheleſſe aſſured, made him anſwer: Wherefore ſhould I ſuffer my ſelfe to be vanquiſhed by a vaine feare, and by the illuſion of a dreame, and not to goe to ſee my father, he hauing cauſed me to bee called vnto him with ſo great mildnes, and hauing had (as it is fitting, and as my  dutie requireth it) alwaies his Maieſtie in great reuerence, and neuer hauing turned my face, but to the part where his inclined, and neuer hauing offended him in any thing, nor aſpired to his Empire, but only when it ſhall pleaſe God to take him to himſelfe, and that the armie ſhall eſteeme me worthie

thereof, and capable to enioy his greatnes with my brothers in perpetuall  peace and euerlaſting concord, contenting my ſelfe, that though by this voiage I ſhould die, to end rather my daies by innocencie and martyrdome, then liuing many yeeres in the Empire, to remaine diſobedient to the will of my father; becauſe if I goe not to him, I ſhall by the enuious perſons of his Court bee condemned as a rebell, and by my enemies infinitly noted and marked.
            
            With this deliberation he arriued neere the Pauilions and Tents of his father, with his traine, and cauſed his people to ſtay there; and clothing himſelf in a new white habit, in token of true fidelitie, and hauing put into his boſome certaine letters and writings, and laying apart all manner of weapons from about him, that ſo he might take away all occaſion to vſe them againſt  his father, he proceeded to goe and kiſſe his fathers hands; and entering into the firſt hall, he was very gratiouſly receiued by the Eunuches, &amp; not ſeeing therein but a place only dreſſed and prepared, he began to be pale and moued, and being a while in ſuſpence, demaunded where the Grand Seigniour was, and it was anſwered him, that he ſhould preſently ſee him. At that inſtant he ſaw enter by another part the ſeuen Muets, who continually are about Seuen Muets executors of the Grand Seigniours pleaſure. the perſon of the Grand Seigniour, and only vnderſtanding by ſignes, they executed his ſecret commiſſions. Muſtapha ſeeing ſuch perſons to come directly to him, began greatly to bee afraid, and turning himſelfe towards them, he ſaid: Behold my apparant death. And minding to flye thence,  hee was as well by theſe Muets, as by the Eunuches, ſtaied without the Pauilion, and brought in againe, where the Muets put a cord of a Turkiſh bow about his necke to ſtrangle him: but he being very ſtout and ſtrong, defended himſelfe as well as he could, in throwing ſometime one, and ſometime another behinde him, pitifully intreating them that they would ſuffer him to ſpeake but two words to his Lord and father. Whileſt that the one ſort endeuoured to take his life from him, and he on the other ſide aſſaied to defend himſelfe, the moſt cruel and abominable father (who was on the one ſide of the Pauilion, very attentiue to ſee the end of ſo horrible and inhumane a tragedie) putting forth his head, ſpake with choler to theſe executioners:  
               Haue you not yet taken away the life from this Traytor, who for certaine The cruell words of a Tyrant. yeeres together hath not ſuffered me to ſleepe in quiet? At theſe words the Muets and Eunuches taking courage, threw him on the ground, and by force drawed and ſtretched the corde which ſtrangled him, there dying in Muſtapha ſtrangled. this manner the moſt liberall and magnificent Lord that euer was of the Ottoman houſe, a man truly both of minde and bodie very noble, and who by his vertuous qualities merited not to haue giuen to others ſo horrible a ſpectacle of himſelfe, as hee gaue by the deceit and treacherie of his enemies. 
            
            This cruell act being thus committed, the Turke cauſed preſently to bee taken the Baſha of Amaſia, and a Venetian, of the houſe of Michely, who was taken a child in the iourney of Preueſa, and who then with great credit bore the Colonels Enſigne, and preſently cauſed their heads to be publikely cut off, calling afterward to him Zeangir the crookbacke (who yet knew nothing

of this enormious crueltie) to whom he commanded to goe ſee his brother Zeangir killed himſelfe, ſeeing his brother dead. who was in the Pauilion, and who was but lately arriued. He hauing vnderſtood  of his brothers arriuall, ranne with a pleaſant countenance to goe and imbrace him, and entering where the poore vnfortunate Muſtapha lay thus euilly intreated, ſtrangled on the ground, beholding him with great teares, Solyman ſent preſently to him that he ſhould take the Treaſures, Tents, and Pauilions, and the Prouince of Muſtapha, beſtowing them on him for a gift. But in ſtead of thanking thoſe which brought him this meſſage, he ſpake vnto them theſe words.
            O curſed treacherous dogge, not a father, but a moſt cruell Tyger, enioy thou rather the Treaſures, Moueables, Pauilions, and the Prouince of Muſtapha, ſeeing this is fallen into thy inraged heart to put to death ſo vertuous  a ſonne, and of ſo great hope, and ſuch a one as there was neuer his like, neither yet ſhall be in the Ottoman houſe, I pray God that I poore crookbacke liue not, that thou maiſt doe the like to me. Whereupon drawing a little poynard which he had by his ſide, he thruſt it into his owne breaſt, &amp; ſo preſently he died. The King vnderſtanding of this vnexpected newes, fell into extreame ſadnes. And this was the trueth of the crookbacks deed, although the world might not be filled with ſo vile an act, and for the reuerence of the Ottoman houſe, the Turkes ſay that he thus ſuddenly died of a Squinancie. 
            
            The Grand Seigniour hauing afterward commaunded that the Pauilions and moueables of Muſtapha ſhould bee carried with his, while they whom he had commaunded to doe it went about to execute it, many were moued and oppoſed themſelues againſt it, thinking that they meant to ſacke them, A great tumult in Solymans armie. theſe valiant ſouldiours not yet knowing what was happened to their Lord; and ſeeing a great number of men to come towards them, fearing ſome ſudden inſolencie, put themſelues in armes, repulſing thoſe backe who were the formoſt, not without great ſlaughter. Thoſe of the Kings Campe perceiuing the rumour which hourely increaſed, running to ſuccour their fellowes, and the other part doing alſo the like, both Camps reenforcing themſelues, with a terrible bruite they put themſelues in armes, and gaue a great  aſſault, where remained ſlaine vpon the place more then 2000. men: and this skirmiſh had not thus ended, if Achmeth Baſha (a graue man, and of great authoritie, for his renowned vertue generally knowne, and greatly eſteemed among the ſouldiours) had not cauſed the Ianiſaries to retire; and if turning himſelfe towards the ſouldiours of Muſtapha, he had not vſed to them ſuch like gentle ſpeeches.
            
               What (my brethren and children) will you be of ſo bad a diſpoſition, and ſo bold to reſiſt the commaund of the Grand Seigniour, whoſe pleaſure is, that his ſonnes treaſure ſhould be taken out of his Pauilions, and carried to his? I cannot beleeue that you who ſo long haue knowne your ſelues to be  the moſt valiant and good Muſulmans (as truly you are) would now ſhew your ſelues ſo inſolent and perfidious to our common Lord, hauing ſo long a time with ſuch fidelitie warred amongſt the Ottoman armies, without being ſtained or defiled of any infamie for his preſeruation, as by your vertuous

actions for his ſeruice you haue declared through all the world, he being  your Lord and mine? Therefore now lay downe your weapons, which are but too much ſharpened for ſo vile an occaſion.
            
            Theſe ſpeeches of this couragious Baſha had ſuch force ouer them, that they were appeaſed, and as very obedient, they ſuffered to bee carried to the Turkes Tent all whatſoeuer was in Muſtaphaes. But his death being within a little while after knowne amongſt the Ianiſaries, and bruited through the Campe, the occaſion thereof, and the diſtruſt of him, and becauſe it was impoſed vpon him, they all tooke armes againe, and making a great tumult, mingled with infinit teares and weepings, they approached very nigh to the Grand Seigniours Pauilion. This ſecond commotion put him into ſuch a maze, that loſing his ſenſes, he would gladly haue fled: but being ſtayed by  his people, not without great daunger to bee maſſacred in this furie, he reſolued (conſtrained by neceſſitie) to doe that, which in an aſſured place hee would not haue done, and ſtanding at the entrance of his Pauilion, although he was greatly pale, yet he boldly ſpake to them. Tell me (quoth he) what tumults are theſe here? What commotion is this? What inſolencies do you thus inconſideratiuely offer to me? Doe you not peraduenture know me? Am I not your Lord, and he that ought to rule and gouerne you? Certaine of them anſwered him, that they well knew him to be ſuch a Lord, who had a long time been choſen by them, whom they had reuerenced, and whoſe Empire they had by their vertue ſo greatly inlarged; to this end notwithſtanding,  that he ſhould rule ouer them with iuſtice, and not without occaſion ſo inconſideratiuely and cruelly ſhed the blood of the good, and cauſe the innocent to bee ſlaine, and that theſe armes were iuſtly by them taken, ſharply to reuenge the death of Muſtapha, and to purge themſelues from that treaſon which was imputed vpon them; and that they would neuer lay them downe, vntill the accuſers ſhould bee brought to iudgement, and he conuicted them to be culpable; and that then with all humilitie (if it ſo fell out) they promiſed (as worthie of ſeuere chaſtiſement) to ſubmit their liues to the moſt cruell and ſhamefulleſt death that could bee found, and that for a finall reſolution they meant that that ſhould bee auerred in the ſame  field.
            Theſe ſpeaking ſo ſtoutly, by reaſon of the griefe which they felt, left not for all that to bathe their cheekes with bitter teares, and their friendly affectionated mournings conſtrained the Grand Seigniour (who for the feare Solyman in danger of his perſon. which he had receiued, and for the horrour of the deede, was almoſt beſides himſelfe) to promiſe them with ſweet and inticing ſpeeches, that he was readie to ſatisfie whatſoeuer they would demaund, and by that meanes appeaſed a great part of this tumult: neuertheleſſe, all the armie with weapons in their hands omitted not to keepe carefull watch, for feare he ſhould ſteale out of the Campe, and that they ſhould bee deceiued of his promiſe which  he had made them of a deſired iudgement.
            
               Roſtan (after he had by the commaund of the great Turk committed the ſeale into the hands of Achmeth, and that himſelfe was depriued of the office and ſtate of Viſir) wholly poſſeſſed with feare for theſe tumults, fled to

the Pauilion of Achmeth, deſiring him as his inward friend, and with great  inſtance, that it would pleaſe him to aduiſe him what he thought fitting to doe in ſo ſudden a daunger. Achmeth anſwered him, that he ſhould take counſell of the Grand Seigniour, and follow his pleaſure, and not of any other. This pleaſed Roſtan, and ſuddenly by a ſufficient meſſage he executed the counſel of his faithfull friend: and receiuing anſwer from the Seigniour, who commaunded that preſently he ſhould retire himſelfe from him; he againe cauſed to bee told him, that he could not depart nor retire without his Pauilions, without commiſſion, and without money. The Turke cauſed to be replied, that the neceſſitie required neither Pauilions nor money. Vpon this reſolution hee mounted on horſebacke with eight of his faithfulleſt  friends, and in three daies he iournied ſo farre, as if in eight he could haue done by poſt, and retired to Conſtantinople, where he remained in great trouble and feare for theſe miſaduentures. The Grand Seigniour afterward endeuoured wiſely to appeaſe the cholor of his ſouldiours; and not being able to achieue the ſame by reaſon of their obſtinacie, and perceiuing himſelfe depriued of hope, and in doubt of his perſon, ſought three times with a few of his people to ſaue himſelfe from their hands. But it was not poſſible for him, but on the contrary with very great inſtance and inſolencie, they demaunded that their Lord ſhould ſhew himſelfe in this field, and that iudgement ſhould be giuen, and iuſtice not delayed, and that they would not permit to ſaue himſelfe either in townes or Fortreſſes, they not minding at any  hand to endure, that without cauſe they ſhould thus falſely maſſacre the innocent, imputing to them ſlanders, &amp; vniuſtly charging them with treaſon, whereof neither Muſtapha, nor they did euer ſo much as thinke: furthermore obſtinately perſeuering in this, that they would not by any meanes depart from thence, except they were reuenged for the innocent blood, and that they might haue iuſtice. The Grand Seigniour ſeeing that after he had publikly and ſecretly practiſed with them all kinde of experiments, yet could he not for all that content them; and that there were alreadie many dayes paſt; and knowing their mindes to be more kindled to reuenge then before; and ſeeing that by his authoritie he could doe no more, meant yet further to  make triall of the graue wiſedome of Achmeth, who knew ſo aptly to handle them, that he ſo farre preuailed in paying daily 1000. Aſpres to euery ſouldiour Solyman eſcapeth from his mutinous ſouldiours. for three dayes to 4000. ſouldiours of the Port, they were agreed to accompanie their Lord to Aleppo, which was three daies iourney from thence; the Turke notwithſtanding hauing giuen them his inuiolable promiſe and faith to chaſtiſe the falſe accuſer, and to reuenge the innocent blood of Muſtapha. With theſe conditions he retired to Aleppo, cleering himſelfe from the hands of his ſouldiours, hauing before hee departed from his Campe, taken order for the bodies of his children, and commaunded they  ſhould be carried to Burſia, where are the ancient Tombes of the Ottomans. 
               Burſia a towne where is the ſepulture of the Turkiſh Emperours. Thoſe who had the charge thereof, vncloathing this miſerable Muſtapha, found the letters (which, as wee haue ſaid, he had put into his boſome, when he went from his Pauilion to go kiſſe his fathers hands) and preſenting them to the Grand Seigniour, he would not then open them. But after theſe tumults

were a little appeaſed, he cauſed them to bee brought vnto him, and read them, and found that from point to point were diſcouered therein, the  
               The innocencie of Muſtapha diſcouered. deſeignes and wicked practiſes of Roſtan and Roſſa againſt Muſtapha: wherevpon he was ſo ſtroken at the heart, that for many daies he was ſo ſurpriſed with griefe, that he would not ſpeake to any man; and if he had not had a reſpect to the ſtate and ordering of things, as then they ſtood, he would not thē haue put Roſtan to death, as he deſerued, but would haue giuen him aliue to bee deuoured of the dogges. But that which he did not then, he reſerued vntill another time: and ſince the fact was remedileſſe, he altered his minde to fauour and aduance Mahomet the ſonne of Muſtapha (which he had by a Ladie of Boſnia) of the age of 14. yeeres, who (during this tumult) was  brought vp by the mother of Muſtapha in another countrie, fearing that the furie of the Grand Seigniour ſhould alſo fall vpon him. And he preſently recalled a certaine Captaine, whom he had alreadie diſpatched to goe and kill him, and he hauing found this childe, cauſed him to bee brought vnto him, he gaue him for his entertainment the Sangiachſhip of Burſia. After that he departed from thence and marched towards Hieruſalem, and being but foure daies iournie from thence, for ſome other accidents happened, he was conſtrained to returne to Aleppo, that he might prouide for the affayres of Syria, and euen then it was that he was alreadie freed from the mariage of Roſſa. 
               
            
            There was there a Chiauſs who with all diligence departed from the Campe, thinking by the death of Muſtapha, to bring good newes to Selim, who then was in Carmania. But Selim was ſo ſad for this death, that he meant to leaue to the world a perpetuall witneſſe thereof, cauſing the head of this Selim killeth him who brought the newes of his brothers death. meſſenger to be cut off, in ſtead of the good recompence that he expected: which truly was a famous act worthie to be recorded, and not worthy of this man who is enemie of our faith, whom if it had pleaſed God to haue conuerted him to his holy faith, aſſuredly he might haue been compared with any other, as well ancient as moderne.
            About this time Peter Chendy was found culpable concerning the inſurrection Chendy excuſeth himſelfe to Ferdinand concerning the inſurrection of Tranſiluania. of the kingdome of Tranſiluania, as hauing put his hand thereto: and  minding to diſcharge himſelfe thereof, he writ to Ferdinand about it, excuſing himſelfe, and aſſuring him that he neuer meant any ſuch matter. His excuſes (according to the neceſſitie of the time) were receiued. But within a while after the Queene deſirous to recouer that which of her owne will ſhe had left, effected her purpoſes ſo well, that cauſing a tumult among the people of the kingdome, within a ſhort time ſhe ſaw her ſelfe Ladie thereof, and chaſed from thence Ferdinands people; there increaſing at the ſame time ſo horrible a plague in this Prouince, that it continued vntill the yeere 1555. whereof died ſo many men, horſes, and other beaſts, that it was an incredible thing. 
            
            Vpon the occaſion of this loſſe, the Turks being incouraged, tooke armes againſt Ferdinand, and entring into that countrie beſieged Albe-iula, againſt Albe-iula yeelded to Queene Izabella, and all Tranſiluania. which they built a Fort, and the aſſieged being at the end of their victuals, were conſtrained to yeeld to the Queene, who in ſauing them, ſhe was by

that meanes made Ladie of that towne, and within a while after (in her ſons  name) of all the reſt of Tranſiluania, and there reſted no more for her to conquer, but certaine Caſtles, ſituated in the confines of the Biſhopricke of Varadin, and that of Tocchay which is very ſtrong. And expecting a commodious time to goe and beſiege them, ſhe did no other thing in the meane while, but aſſure the minds of the principals of the kingdome in the deuotion of her ſelfe and her ſonne, cauſing for this purpoſe to be publiſhed a generall Diet at Sibinio for all the nations of the countrie, wherein ſhe ſhewed the wrong which ſhe had receiued by the officers of the Emperour, becauſe they had not kept with her the conditions and capitulations accorded betweene them, and the loſſe and ruine which had happened vnto them, becauſe  they would take part with him: and on the contrarie, the good and profit which they ſhould receiue in being retired to her, ſhe aſſured in ſuch ſort her forces in this Prouince, that all wholly refuſing the amitie of Ferdinand, and imbracing that of Iohns, as of their naturall Lord, all neuer ceaſed vntill they had cleanſed Tranſiluania of the remainders of the Emperials, the Queene being for this purpoſe fauoured of the King of Polonia, and of the Queene Bonna her mother, who ſecretly (beſides the Turke, who feared that Ferdinand ſhould ſet footing in this countrie, and that in time he might greatly annoy him in that quarter) would not faile to aſſiſt her with all counſels and ſuccours, which they ſhould thinke neceſſarie and profitable for her, according to the condition of the time. She recompenced thoſe  who had not abandoned her part, and (as a ſage and prudent woman) ſhe reſerued to another time the commoditie to reuenge her ſelfe of the iniuries which ſhe had receiued of thoſe who ſo many times rebelled againſt her, and had been the occaſion of all theſe inconueniences. And being confederate with the Vayuodes of Moldauia and Valachia, and by the expreſſe commaund of the Turke, hauing made a perfect alliance and friendſhip with the Baſha of Buda, the Sangiach of Boſſina and Belgrade, ſhe began to giue order to the affayres of the kingdome, and to receiue the accounts of the reuenew thereof, to acquit her ſelfe, and pay thoſe who had aſſiſted her to enter thereinto, and alſo to giue preſents to thoſe who for diuers cauſes did  merit recompence, making her ſelfe by this meanes delightfull to euery one.
            About this time her brother Sigiſmond King of Polonia, hauing refuſed for wife one of the daughters of the King of the Romanes, being inamoured of a gentlewoman his ſubiect, who was yong, and indowed with ſingular beautie, he tooke her to wife and ſpouſe, and married her againſt the will of the Queene his mother, and of all the principals of his kingdome: for which occaſion it happened, that the mother was long time incenſed againſt him, vntill the death of this new Queene, who ſuddenly died, not without Sigiſmond the 2. King of Polonia in diſgrace with his mother and Polanders for his wife. ſuſpition of being poyſoned, and by her death all the diſſentions of the kingdome  were appeaſed, and the King was reconciled to Queene Bonna his mother, who hauing before greatly laboured to haue leaue to retire out of Polonia, and goe and repoſe her ſelfe in Italie, and to finiſh the remainder of her daies in her Dutchie of Barry, ſituated in the kingdome of Naples, ſhe

was in the end (by meanes of the Emperour Charles, and of Ferdinand King The Queene of Polonia retireth into Italie. of the Romanes) licenſed by her ſonne: and in iourneying into Italie, ſhe  paſſed by Venice, where (by this Common-weale) ſhe was receiued within the A rich Barge wherein the Venetian Seigniorie expatiat themſelues in the Adriatike ſea, neere to their citie. Bucentaure with great pompe, and honoured by all the gentlewomen of the towne, who gorgiouſly attired, and dreſſed with ſtones and Iewels, preſented themſelues to her, and conducted her to the Palace of the Duke of Ferrara, vſing to her the greateſt curteſies which could be imagined, ſhe being further continually viſited by euery one. And after being accompanied with certaine armed Gallies, which were giuen to her by the State of Venice to conduct her in ſuretie, for feare of Saala Rays the Pyrat, who then skoured thoſe ſeas: and with a good winde ſhe arriued at the Port of Barry, where  ſhe liued not long, not being held in any good reputation, nor gaining a good name, by reaſon of one Pappacoda, to whom (forgetting her ſonne and Pappacoda entertained Bonna the Queene of Polonia. daughter, ſo great is the fleſhly deſire of this world) ſhe left all the good things that ſhe had, remaining infinitly blamed for this act, and little commended among the liuing.
            This happened then, when betweene the Emperour Charles, and Henry 
               A truce betweene the Emperour Charles and the King of France. King of France, there was accorded (after many diſputes and controuerſies betweene the Commiſſioners) a truce for fiue yeeres: which was publiſhed in France, in Italie, and Flanders. And that they might the better reioyce and congratulate vpon the occaſion thereof with theſe two great Princes, the Pope ſent to the one of them for Legate, the Cardinall Mottola, and to  the other, the Cardinall Caraffa.
            
            The Emperour laying aſide armes, by occaſion of this truce, with hope Charles the Emperour renounceth the Empire, to the end that Ferdinand might haue it. that it in the end would ingender a good peace, was reſolued wholly to renounce all the affayres and pompes of this world, inſomuch that according to this reſolution, whileſt he was at Gaunt, he diſpatched certaine Lords to the Electors of the Empire, and to Ferdinand his brother, by whom he declared to them his determination, ſending by them to Ferdinand the Crowne, Scepter, and the other Emperiall ornaments. By theſe he writ to the Cardinall of Mentz an Elector, the letter which followeth. 
            
            
               My Lord Cardinall, ſeeing it hath pleaſed God to ſhew me ſo much grace at the end of my daies, as to graunt me reſt, by the truce which I haue made with the King of France, the fruite whereof I hope for a good peace, betweene the ſubiects both of the one part and other, I am reſolute to end the remainder of my yeeres with a life more ſweete and fuller of tranquilitie; by meane of which I may applie my ſelf to the contemplation of diuine things, from which (to my great ſorrow) I haue been more diſtracted then I would haue bin, by the affayres which I haue had vpon me euen from my youth in ſo great abundance, that if diuine clemencie had not aſſiſted and comforted me, I know it had been impoſſible for me to vnfold my ſelfe therefrom. The acknowledgement which I haue thereof, beſides other benefits receiued frō
                  aboue,  hath more excited me to make this retraict, then any other conſideration I could haue had: to which neuertheleſſe I had not permitted my ſelfe to goe, if I had ſeene that my preſence, and the adminiſtration committed into my hands, could yet haue brought any commoditie to the Commonweale.

But after ſo many victories which God (notwithſtanding I was vnworthie  of them) gaue me, I more eſteeme this grace which he hath ſhewed me, to haue fauoured me ſo much as to cauſe me to ſee a peace, or at leaſt a generall truce, not onely among my ſubiects, and other Princes my friends and confederates: but alſo with thoſe who ſay themſelues to be my enemies, leauing now euery one in quiet, and in ſuch patience, that not any hath need of my helpe. Conſidering this great fauour of God, and the imbecilitie which old age hath brought vpon me, and iudging that both the one and the other doe eaſily exempt me any longer to gouerne the rudder of this Chriſtian Common-weale, I haue preſently reſolued with my ſelfe, vtterly alſo to forſake all other leſſer affayres and pleaſures of this world: and to employ this little time, which yet I haue here vpon earth, in ſpirituall contemplations,  that ſo I may by the meanes thereof, wipe away the faults which (it may bee) I haue committed againſt and beſides the will of his diuine Maieſtie, euen as they who haue the like charge that wee haue, doe ſo much the more fully fall, as the burthen which they beare vpon their ſhoulders is great and weightie. I am not ignorant but that (as we are ſubiect to bee abuſed) I haue giuen occaſion to ſome to be diſcontented with me, inſomuch that this is not ſufficient for me that I am willing by my retraict to appeaſe the diuine anger, (which I haue drawne vpon my ſelfe) except on the other part I endeuour to ſatisfie thoſe that might complaine of me. This my affection hath pricked me forward to condiſcend more eaſily to the accord, which I haue  made touching the conuentions ſet downe by the truce, by which I haue releaſed to the King of France, not onely more then he demaunded, but alſo more then he hoped for: and how alſo my Commiſſioners (by my commaund) haue done towards his Holines, minding thereby firſt to content ſtrangers, and after to haue regard of my ſubiects; whom the better to ſatiſfie according to my abilitie, I haue ſent the moſt part of the Lords (who are now here with me) to giue them to vnderſtand this my good will, to the end that they not being ignorant thereof, might freely declare vnto me whatſoeuer they eſteeme good for the accompliſhment thereof: hauing alſo ſent for my ſonne to execute in this countrie of Flanders and Bourgundie, whatſoeuer  they ſhall diſcouer vnto me, for the comfort of my conſcience, whileſt that my ſelfe, after being arriued in Spaine (by Gods helpe) I hope to do the like there, and alſo in my other kingdomes. I ſhould bee very glad if I were able to come into Germanie, and at a Diet there my ſelfe to make this my declaration, for the honour which I owe to ſuch a Prouince. But the winter which approacheth, hindereth me from going thither. And ſince neceſſitie cōſtraineth me, I deſire you to appoint the Diet to be held at Franckfort, and to call thither all the other Electors and Princes of the Empire: and you being there, to declare to them all (in my name) the indiſpoſition of the approached  time, which doth not permit me to execute that good will which I had to come and meete them there, that ſo I might againe thanke them for the honour that they, or their predeceſſors haue done to me, in electing me to bee their Emperour, and withall to ſet out the good affection which their forefathers haue alwaies ſhewed by effect to thoſe of our houſe, euen as alſo

I would they meant to continue it in the election which afterwards they  made of my brother, conſtituting him K. of the Romanes, and which good affection I intreate them to maintaine. And alſo I would haue you to declare vnto them, that my intention is (ſince all things are now in peace) to commit into the hands of my brother (now King of the Romanes) the Crowne, and all the other Emperiall ornaments, to the end that he taking wholly vpon him the care and charge of the Empire, my abſence ſhould not be the cauſe that any trouble ſhould grow there, deſiring them all that they would aſſiſt him, and that they would liue peaceably with him, and as true naturall brethren. And further that you would giue them to vnderſtand, that this my departure from them (although it be farre off) yet is it not with intent to leaue or forſake them: but on the contrarie, they ſhall alwaies finde  me furniſhed and prouided of ſo good an affection towards them, as euer I had. And if there be any ſubiect of the Empire, who can complaine that I haue vſed any iniuſtice againſt him, I haue deſired my brother to giue redreſſe thereunto, to whom for ſuch complaints euery man may repayre. And for the laſt care which here I can haue touching the good of this Empire, I deſire you to perſwade them that they would accept of and ratifie the dimiſſion which I make, and that to bee ſhort, they would crowne for their Emperour him whom they haue alreadie choſen King of the Romanes, to the end that this great Prouince may ſee it ſelfe prouided of a head, who may haue an eye in euery place, as euery one hath alſo an eye vpon him, and  that by this meanes you may ſhut the Port againſt enterance of new enterpriſes, which may ariſe for want of the preſence of the head who may bee able to reſiſt them. Alſo further I deſire them, that they would not faile my ſaid brother of ſuccours, for the conſeruation of his kingdome of Hungarie, which is the Bulwarke of all Germanie againſt the common enemie. And in particular I deſire you (moſt reuerend Cardinall) to ſet your hand thereto: as alſo more particularly I recommend vnto you (againſt ſome enuious perſons) the defence of all that which I haue done and negotiated amongſt the Electors, Princes, and Lords of the Empire, and Emperiall townes, knowing that you are not ignorant with what ſinceritie I haue behaued my  ſelfe in my actions, whereof I will alwaies yeeld good account both before God and men: although I will not denie, but that there hath been ſometime mingled therewithall ſome things of humane frailtie, not minding to attribute to my ſelfe ſuch perfection, that I haue been exempted from naturall vice. But the one being ballanced with the other, I am aſſured that the wiſer ſort will not vſe any ſeuere iudgement againſt me: and commending to your wiſedome the vpholding of this my cauſe, I will not make to you any longer diſcourſe thereof. And to conclude this preſent matter, I deſire you to beleeue, that whereſoeuer I am, I will alwaies be mindfull and carefull to employ my ſelfe, and that towards my friends, in all that which I ſhall  know to be neceſſarie for you, whereof I deſire you not to feare to aduertiſe and ſolicite me. In the meane time I recommend my ſelfe to your good fauour and prayers, and humbly deſire God to keepe you my Lord Cardinall in long health and happie life. From Gaunt the 2. of September 1556.
            
            
               
According to the contence of this letter, Philip the only ſonne of the Emperour  
               Philip came to ſeeke his father the Emperour. came to his father at Scuebourg in Zeland, whither from Gaunt he was come to imbark himſelfe to ſea. There the father inſtructed him how he ſhould gouerne the affayres of his States, and how he ſhould carrie himſelfe to his ſubiects, and his confederates: after he had giuen him his bleſſing, and imbraced him for the laſt time, and diſmiſſed all the Princes, Ambaſſadours, Gentlemen, and Captaines who were there preſent, his Maieſtie the 14. of September, a little before the sunne riſing, went aboord vnto a veſſell prepared for him, together with the two Queenes, Elinor and Mary his ſiſters: and being accompanied with 60. ſaile, directed his courſe towards Biſcay, where, with a fauourable winde, he arriued within few daies, hauing before paſſed  the ſea ſixe other times. He diſimbarked at Larede, a Port of that Prouince, and there he was receiued with great honour by the Lords and Spaniſh Charles arriued in Spaine. gentlemen. Some ſay, that as ſoone as he ſet foote on land, he kneeled downe, thanking God for that in theſe laſt daies of his life he had ſhewed him this fauour to conduct him into this countrie, which aboue all others he held alwaies moſt deare, and by meanes whereof he was come to that high degree of the Empire, attributing to it (next to God) in a manneral his victories and honours, vſing theſe words: As naked I came out of my mothers wombe, ſo naked doe I returne to thee my ſecond mother, and in recompence of many merits which thou haſt vſed to me, I not being able for the preſent to beſtow any other thing on thee, I giue thee this my ſicke bodie,  and theſe my feeble and weake bones. After he had vſed theſe words, notwithout ſhedding ſome teares, he very kindly ſaluted all thoſe Lords which were come thither to doe him that honour which they owed to him: and after being put into his Litter, he was conducted to the towne of Valladolid, Valladolid. where was the Prince Charles his yong ſonne. In this towne (which next to that of Tolledo, is the principall towne of Spaine) his Maieſtie was reſident The Emperor Charles inſtructed his little ſonne Charles. a while, during the which, he exhorted this yong Prince to imitate the footſteps of his predeceſſors, and charily to obſerue and keepe the Chriſtian and Catholike religion. After that, he went from thence into the Prouince of Eſtremadure, to a Moneſtarie of S. Hieromes, called the Heremite Friers, ſituated  
               The place where the Emperour Charles retired himſelfe to end his dates. in a very ſolitarie place, and commodious to leade a holy life. Hauing in this place giuen leaue to the two Queenes his ſiſters to depart, and ſent them backe to Valladolid, this great Emperour chuſed there his laſt aboade, and there ending the reſt of his daies, with few domeſtike officers, giuing himſelfe ouer to continuall contemplation of diuine things, and forſaking all the affayres of this world, he paſſed the reſt of his time in prayer, almes deedes, and other charitable workes.
            In the meane time, Ferdinand King of the Romanes, after he had receiued by the hands of the Prince of Orange the patents of the Emperour (by which  in his fauour he renounced the dignitie of the Empire) the Scepter, and Crowne, with the Emperiall Mantle, he went to the Diet of Franckfort, accompanied Ferdinand crowned Emperour. with the ſaid Prince, with George Sigiſmond Sille Vice-chancellor, and Wolfang Haller Secretarie of the Empire, about the moneth of March. At this Diet were all the Electors, and the ceremonies accuſtomed in ſuch ſolemne

acts being accompliſhed, his Maieſtie with all his Princes went to Aix, where he was crowned Emperour, notwithſtanding the refuſall, which  Pope Paul the 4. made to ratifie this election; alleadging that it was not lawfull, for that the Heretike Electors (as he ſo called them) intermedled therewithall. But this no otherwiſe proceeded not from his Holines, but by an occaſion of a certaine deuice betweene him, the King of France, and others, altogether againſt the houſe of Auſtria: according vnto which the Duke of Albe was euen now come to blowes with the Captaines of his Holines: and The truce broken betweene King Henry of France and Philip King of Spaine. within a while after followed the breach of the foreſaid truce, vpon which occaſion happened to the French this great loſſe which they ſuſtained vpon S. Laurence his day, in the moneth of Auguſt, by the towne of Saint Quintins. 
            
            About this time the Grand Seigniour declared to the Queene of Tranſiluania, that he vnderſtood that certaine ſects were crept into the religion Commaund from the Turk to Queene Izabella, to chaſe out of her kingdome the new ſects. which ſhe held, which by no meanes he would ſhe ſhould tolerate, if ſhe would remaine in his fauour, knowing that ſuch nouelties would bring nothing to her but tumult and loſſe of her kingdome, and to him much trauaile: and for this cauſe he commaunded her vtterly to extirpite them who were authors thereof, and in ſuch manner to extinguiſh them, that there ſhould not be any mention of them. This command was not without cauſe. For the Heretikes were alreadie neſled in this kingdome, and by their preachings had ſowed their darnell, and withdrawne many from the vniuerſall  Church: and if this commaund had not put them in great feare, all the kingdome had been repleniſhed with them. But according to the will of the Turke, and obeying thereto, they were preſently baniſhed and chaſed from thence. By which wee may ſee how much a ſudden and readie foreſight (which is vſed with wiſedome, in things ſtirred vp beſides and againſt ancient cuſtome) may infinitly profit in general, &amp; at no hand preiudice in particular. If this had been obſerued in Germanie, when the hereſies there budded out, this Prouince had not ſo much bin giuen to troubles as it was, with the loſſe and damage of all Chriſtendome. 
            
            In this ſame time Charles King of Spaine, and not long ſince Emperour, The death of the Emperour Charles. being fallen ſicke in the Moneſtarie of the Hieronimite Friers, after he had receiued all the Sacraments of the Church by the hands of the Archbiſhop of Tolledo, named Bartholmew Miranda, and not without the teares of thoſe who were there preſent, the 21. of September he yeelded his ſoule to God, putting by his death an end to his great triumphs and victories, and leauing this perpetuall memorie of him, that of long time before him there was not any Emperour more valiant, couragious, wiſe, and fortunate then himſelfe. His bodie was intombed in the towne of Granado, in the place where ordinarily are buried all the Kings of Spayne. His ſonne Philip (onely heire of all his kingdomes and ſeigniories) after he vnderſtood of his death, he made  
               Sumptuous funerals made at Bruxels by Philip King of Spaine, for the Emperour his father. a ſumptuous preparation for his funerals in the Church of S. Iula at Bruxels. And among other magnificences, there was a great Ship which was made to goe through the ſtreetes by art, which was round about filled with goodly tables ſhewing his victories, there was vpon the right ſide writtten theſe

words: Africke ruinated, Gelders taken, the ſea cleered, Tremiſan reeſtabliſhed, Solyman chaſed. Vpon the left ſide were read theſe words: The new  world diſcouered, Millan recouered, Germanie and Bohemia appeaſed, Moron and Coron forced, Tuniſe taken and reſtored, and the captiues brought backe againe, the Chriſtian Faith planted in India. After this great Veſſell followed two Collomes placed vpon two Rockes, being crowned and drawne by Tritons. In one of them was written theſe verſes.
            
               Take thou well for thy deuiſe
               The Herculian pillar of large ſize.
            
            And in the other were thoſe which here follow:
            
               Taming the monſter in this ſeaſon of thine,
               
                  As Hercules did in his time. 
                  
               
            
            And after were carried all the Enſignes of his kingdomes and ſeiguiories, which were followed by the gentlemen of his houſe in good order, of which I will make no large diſcourſe, to auoide the tediouſnes which the reader may take, in reading againe a thing which others by ſpeciall writing haue alreadie heretofore expoſed to the eyes of euery one. Onely I will ſay that in this ceremonie marched King Philip, the Duke of Sauoy, and all the other Knights of the Golden Fleece, with the Ambaſſadours of all the Potentates of Europe. In the ſaid Church was ſeene both of one ſide and other, that which followeth, written in faire and great letters. 
            
            To the Emperour Caeſ. Charles the 5. Religious, Happie, Aug. of the Gaules, great Lord of the Indies, of Tuniſe, of Africke, of Saxonie, mightie, victorious, and triumphant ouer many nations. Although that the things by him done by ſea and land, his ſingular humanitie, his incomparable wiſedome, his moſt feruent zeale, are ſufficiently knowne to the world: neuertheleſſe the Chriſtian Common-weale, for the memorie of his iuſtice, pietie, and vertue, hath dedicated this Ship vnto him: Becauſe he diſcouered to our world, a new world; and added to the name of Chriſt many ſtrange nations, and inlarged the Empire of Spaine with many kingdomes and Prouinces. For that he preſerued Germanie againſt 30000. horſe, and 100000. footmen, with which Solyman the Turkiſh Emperour meant to haue inuaded  this Region: Becauſe he entered with a ſtrong Nauie into Morea, and tooke Patras and Coron Turkiſh townes: For that he ouercame the Tyrant Barbaroſſa in battaile by Carthage, who was accompanied with 200000. footmen, and 60000. horſe. Becauſe he put to flight 200. Gallies, and many other veſſels of Pirates, and tooke the Fort of Goleta, with Tuniſe, and Hippo the new, and Hippo the royall. For that he tooke the kingdome of Tuniſe, and by it ſpoyled the Empire of Libia, and reſtored it to the lawfull King, and cauſed him to pay tribute to the Crowne of Spaine. Becauſe he brought from thence free into their countrie 20000. captiues. For that he yeelded the kingdom of Tremiſan to ye right King, after he had tamed the Mauritanians:  Becauſe with a ſtrong Nauie he won Africk, the moſt renowned port towne of Barbaria, with the townes of Suſa, Monaſtaire, &amp; Clupea, with other ſeatownes, and cauſed the Lords of them to pay tribute. For that he ouerthrew neere to Mauritania, and by the Ile of Sicilia, twice two Turkiſh Fleetes

ſcouring our ſeas. For that he made the ſea peaceable againſt the continuall courſes of Pirates. Becauſe he reduced the Common-wealth of Genes to  her ancient libertie. Becauſe after he had ſixe times chaſed the enemies fleetes, and thrice in battaile defeated the enemies, twice reunited the Dutchie of Millan to the Empire, and once reſtored it to the D. Becauſe with incredible celeritie he forced the towne of Dura, and ruduced vnder his puiſſance the Dutchie of Guelders. For that he ſuppreſſed many Princes of Germanie, and Prouinces which ſtirred the countrie to tumult and ſedition, forcing their townes and Caſtles, and for that after he had taken the heads of their armies he pacified Germanie. For that he being Emperour paſſed the riuer of Albis, and after he had ouercome in battaile his enemies, and reduced  their townes vnder his puiſſance, and tooke their Commanders captiues, from thence he returned victorious. Becauſe that of his owne good will he tooke armes againſt the enemies of Chriſtendome, and neuer againſt the Chriſtians, but by conſtraint, and to warrant himſelfe from their outrages. To the moſt puiſſant, Catholike, and excellent Prince, this Chriſtian Common-weale moſt affectionate to his Maieſtie, hath erected theſe Titles and Trophees, adding to his Tombe the marks and Enſignes of his kingdomes, and the Tables of conquered nations: and to our Lord Emperour Caeſ. Charles the religious, happie, Aug. King of many kingdomes, triumphant ouer many nations, victorious ouer the Indies, Libia, Maur. Turkie; Deliuerer of Germanie, of Italie, of the Sea, of captiues; Pacifier of Germanie,  Italie, Spaine, and of the Sea; Reeſtabliſher of many Princes, Arbitrer of many Princes, and to the moſt glorious Prince of Catholikes, the Chriſtian Common-weale hath dedicated this for the example of Iuſtice, of Clemencie, and Valour, to his moſt religious ſonne. Moſt gratious God, and moſt mightie, one and alone in Trinitie, the Chriſtian people doe conſecrate vnto thee theſe Titles and Trophees, for the memorie of the acts of Charles, Caeſ. Aug. whom thou madeſt Emperor of the Romanes, and King of many kingdomes, whoſe Pietie, Iuſtice, Clemencie, Prudencie, Magnanimitie, and Valour, is admired throughout the world: he by thy conduct hath augmented  this Empire, and his kingdomes, leauing the one to his brother, and the other to his ſonne, with an example of his vertues, which he dying ſurrendereth to thee againe.
            This great Emperour did well deſerue, that ſuch and ſo great honours ſhould bee done him, there not being any ſince Charlemaine, who in force, puiſſance, and happines ſurpaſſed him. Within a while after died his ſiſter Mary, who was married to Lewis King of Hungarie, ſlaine in the battaile of Mohaze.

               THE ARGVMENT OF THE EIGHT BOOKE.

               THe Emperour Ferdinand, brother to the deceaſed Emperour, about the very time &amp; the death of his brother, had aduertiſement that the Baſha of Buda and the Moldauian, beyond all expectation, would come into the field, whileſt his Maieſtie held the Diet in the towne of Ausbourg, in which were preſent all the Electors, and almoſt all the Princes of the Empire, as well for his own Ambaſſadours of France at the Diet of Ausbourg. affayres, as to giue audience to an Ambaſſage ſent from  the King of France, of which were chiefe the Biſhop of Vienna named Marrillac, and the Lord of Bourdillon, which was vpon the 28. of March, the Emperour being in the great hall of Ausbourg in his Emperiall throne The ſeate of the Emperour and Princes of the Empire in the Diets. vnder the cloth of Eſtate, hauing on his right hand the Biſhop of Mentz, the Ambaſſadour of the Biſhop of Coullin, the Archduke Charles, the Biſhop of

Saltzbourg, the Grand Maſter of Pruſſia, with many other great Lords. Vpon  his left hand was the Biſhop of Treuers, the Duke of Saxonies Ambaſſadour, the Ambaſſadour of the Counte Palatin of Rhein, the Marqueſſe of Brandebourg, the Duke of Bauier, the Counte Palatin not the Elector, the Duke of Michelbourg, the Duke of Wirtemberg, and the three Marqueſſes of Baden, with other Lords. Before this great and renowned companie were honourably placed the Ambaſſadours of France. They offered in the name of their King all his abilitie and friendſhip for the ſeruie of the Empire, and they ſought a perpetuall confederacie with him and the Electors. Anſwer was made them, that when they ſaw effects correſpondent to his words, by reſtitution of the towne of Mets, they would then aſſuredly  thinke that their Maſter would bee their friend; and alſo that then they would be all readie to confirme good amitie him.
            This Diet ended, the Emperour for feare of the daunger which might happen in his kingdome of Hungarie, vpon the ſaid aduertiſement, had preſent recourſe to the ayde of his eſtates, and of the Empire. Bohemia, Morauia, Succours graunted to Ferdinand againſt the Turke. Stiria, and Carinthia offered vpon euery thouſand crownes of value, twelue crownes to ſuccour his Maieſtie. And the Empire offered him men, horſes, and money, if in caſe the warre ſhould further proceede: and in the meane time while they could ſee what way theſe rumours would take, they yeelded to his Maieſtie 600000. Dollors for three moneths, to be employed where his Maieſtie thought good. Theſe rumours were not in vaine. For  the warre betweene Ferdinand and King Iohn (otherwiſe called Stephen) was greatly inflamed: King Iohn hauing alreadie taken from the Emperour the ſtrong Caſtle of Tocchay, and many other, minding continually to aſſay the Tocchay taken by K. Iohn from Ferdinand. recouerie of the ſurpluſage of his kingdome, and to reuenge himſelfe of the wrong which he thought he had receiued in this, that the Emperour held not promiſe with him touching the Infanta Ioane, whom he had promiſed vnto for ſpouſe, with a dowrie conuenient to her greatnes: and with ſuch reaſons, being fauoured of the Hungars, who complained themſelues to bee ſorely oppreſſed by the Emperour: and hauing by the ayde of the Turke amaſſed  a great armie, he poſſeſſed a large countrie, and had become maſter of all Hungarie, if the Emperour had not before ſent a ſufficient Campe to reſiſt and hinder them from further proceeding; notwithſtanding the forces of the Baſha of Buda, who was come into the field on his behalfe. But at the inſtance of the King of Polonia, &amp; other Princes, who offered themſelues to Debatement of peace betweene King Iohn and the Emperour Ferdinand. be mediatours of ſome good accord, for the deſire which they had to quēch that fire, for feare that the Turke vnder this occaſion ſhould not faſten himſelfe further in this quarter, hee cauſed his armie to retire, as alſo King Iohn did, who by the aduice &amp; perſwaſion of the ſaid mediatours, was reduced to this point, that he would ſend Ambaſſadours to the Emperiall Maieſtie, to effect their accord, and to demaund one of his daughters in mariage, which  he did: and his Ambaſſadours being arriued at Vienna, and audience being graunted them, being about to ſay that Iohn King of Hungarie and Tranſiluania had ſent them vnto him; the Emperour would heare them no further, ſaying, that his Vayuode ought not to call himſelfe King of Hungarie, that

kingdome being his inheritance, not vſurped, as it had been by the father of him who ſent them: and that if they would haue audience, they ſhould no  more call Iohn King of Hungarie, nor Tranſiluania, but onely Vayuode of that Prouince. The Ambaſſadours not minding to accept of theſe conditions, preſently diſpatched Couriers into Poland and into Tranſiluania, to giue the King notice of all this. Vpon this difficultie, the K. of Poland was of opinion, that the King of Tranſiluania his nephew ſhuld not for that time name himſelfe K. of Hungarie, but only of that which he poſſeſſed: ſeeing it was not likely that he could iuſtly denie him the title of K. of Tranſiluania, he being thereunto called by the conſent of all the people, and reinſtalled by force of his armes, after that he had not kept, nor obſerued the couenants and promiſes made as on his behalfe, betweene the Queene his mother  and the Emperour, in the time that Caſtalde was there. The Ambaſſadours following this aduice, alleadging the reaſons of the King of Poland, and ſpeaking of Caſtalde, they complained greatly of him, ſaying, that the Queene had been more deceiued by his perſwaſions and vaine ſpeeches, then had been the dead King her husband by thoſe who had crowned him K. of Hungarie, and thoſe who were reuolted againſt him. The Emperour not minding to agree to this title of K. of Tranſiluania, but only of Vayuod, receiued notwithſtanding thoſe Ambaſſadours, who, treating of their charge, were not much content. They demaunded, that the Emperour ſhould relinquiſh all that which he pretended in Tranſiluania, and that he  ſhould make peace with their King, in giuing him his daughter in marriage with 100000. crownes, and vpon this condition, that all that which is ſituated beyond Tibiſcus ſhould bee his, and that which was on this ſide ſhould remaine to his Maieſtie: and that in the warres which might be betweene him and the Turke, he ſhould be reputed neuter, not willing in this caſe to forſake the amitie of the Grand Seigniour, not to faile in the fidelitie and homage which he had done vnto him: neither was he willing to be bound to ioyne with his Maieſtie, whenſoeuer the Turke would make warre in Hungarie. They alſo further demaunded, that concerning that which the Emperour poſſeſſed of the reſt of Hungarie, he ſhould ſatisfie the dowrie and  debts of Queene Izabella, which ſhe pretended from the time of the death of King Iohn her husband. To theſe demaunds the Emperour conſented in part, and in part alſo meant not to conſent to thoſe which moſt imported him, and ſpecially concerning the alliance, that he might not ſeeme thereby willing to yeeld vp his pretended right of Tranſiluania, and hoping that himſelfe or his childrē one day ſhould be able to recouer it: and he preuailed ſo farre, that the enterpriſe of the Poliſh Ambaſſadours, and of other Princes came to nothing: and by that meanes the Ambaſſadours of Tranſiluania returned without any reſolution. Which was a cauſe within a while after of great warre betweene him and the King of Tranſiluania, vnder the fauour  of the Turke: vpon which occaſion he well knew what loſſe and damage it was to him, for that he would not then agree.
            A certaine time after the Vayuode of Valachia was aduertiſed, that another Vayuode went about to diſpoſſeſſe him of his eſtate, being aſſured of

ſuccours from Ferdinand; and of the fauour of the nephew of that Lasky, who  
               Albert Lasky. laboured the friendſhip which was betweene Solyman and King Iohn. This nephew was alſo named Lasky. He for ſundrie matters whereof he was attainted, was before conſtrained to forſake the kingdome of Polonia: vpon which occaſion he was retired vnder the protection of his vncle to the Turk, of whom he was ſo well receiued, that he was made a Colonell of certaine Turkiſh troupes of horſe and foote. But ſometimes after forgetting all theſe honours and fauours, he forſooke that part, and tooke that of the Emperour Ferdinands, in whoſe ſeruice he then was, when he practiſed this ſubteltie, and enterpriſed without the knowledge of Ferdinand, againſt the Vayuode of Valachia, for the profit and commoditie of another, in whoſe fauour he had alreadie amaſſed 2000. horſe, which he ioyned with the armie of the other  Vayuode, which was of 8000. footmen, and 4000. horſe. Theſe altogether marched with great ſpeede, thinking to take the Vayuode vnprouided, and were alreadie arriued very neere him, attending the night which was fit to maſſacre them, and to ſeaze vpon his eſtate, in a pleaſant &amp; weake village, wherein for the preſent he then was. But the Vayuode being alreadie vpon his guard, &amp; according to the firſt aduertiſements, hauing aſſembled very ſecretly, to the number of 40000. men foote and horſe, attending the iſſue of this enterpriſe, being aduertiſed of the place where his enemies were lodged, he cauſed that night all his people to march with ſpeede, and in ſuch manner ſo ſurpriſed his enemie, that he had neither leiſure nor commoditie  to range himſelfe in battaile, ſeeing himſelfe aſſailed on all ſides ſo ſuddenly and furiouſly, that he was conſtrained with his friend Lasky, to flie to the confines of Polonia, and to leaue the victorie to the Valachians, who with little loſſe of theirs, and great of their enemies, inriched themſelus with the ſpoyle &amp; bootie of this man: Lasky afterwards remaining diſpoſſeſſed of many townes and Caſtles which he had by Caſſouia, being depriued of thoſe by meanes of the ſaid Vayuode. And by this ill fortune ſo inconſideratiuely happened to him, falling into the indignation of Ferdinand, who diſmiſſed him from his ſeruice, he retired into Moldauia, for that he would not fall into the hands of the King of Polonia, the Emperour, or of the Valachian;  theſe Princes not minding by the ſuffering of ſuch an act, to draw vpon them any more the forces of Solyman, who neuertheleſſe on his ſide, was not to demaund of them therefore any greater ſatisfaction, he hauing then a great diſtruſt of the Gouernour of Egypt, againſt whom he had ſent a great number of Ianiſaries and other ſouldiours of his Port, fearing ſome commotion in that Prouince: and from other places he had ſome aduertiſements of the enterpriſes of Baiazet his ſecond ſonne, who (ſome ſaid) meant to inuade Syria, Solyman in trouble and doubt by Baiazet his ſon. with the ſuccours and ayde of the Sophy, ſo that Solyman was againe conſtrained to ſend new garriſons into that quarter. 
            
            Vpon the occaſion of theſe troubles, he himſelfe had great deſire to ſeeke peace and truce with Ferdinand: although that his Lieutenants of Buda and of Boſſina, with the Vayuodes of Valachia, Moldauia, and of Tranſalpina, in fauour of King Iohn, brought great damage to the Emperour, harrying and ſpoyling Hungarie, bringing into their hands many places thereof, his Maieſtie

not being able to draw any ſuccours from the Lords of that countrie, neither for the fortifications of the places, nor for the entertainment of his  ſouldiours: and if it had not been for the new garriſons which he put in better places, by the ayde of his ſubiects of Auſtria, the loſſe had been farre greater in that countrie. Solyman, notwithſtanding the gaine which his people had in Hungarie, conſidering the perill whereinto he might fall, if he at one time had to doe againſt ſo puiſſant enemies as the Emperour and the Sophy were, reſolued rather to ſeeke peace with the Chriſtians, then with his ſubiects.
            To this end (while they were at a Diet which was held at Franckfort, there Maximillian ſonne of Ferdinand choſen King of the Romanes. was celebrated the ſolemnitie of the election, that the Electors had made of the perſon of Maximilian King of Bohemia, the eldeſt ſonne of Ferdinand, 
                to bee King of the Romanes, and of his Coronation, after the accuſtomed promiſes by him made to be an obedient childe to the holy Church, according to the vſe of his predeceſſors) an Ambaſſadour ſent from Solyman was preſented in this great aſſemblie, who offered a preſent to Ferdinand of certaine Solyman ſeeketh peace with Ferdinand. rich habiliments, and of ſtraunge beaſts: and after hauing ended ſome differences with his Maieſtie, which imported Hungarie, the truce was concluded betweene them: and in conſideration thereof, this Ambaſſadour cauſed to bee releaſed and ſet at libertie many priſoners taken in warre, who by no meanes before could be redeemed for any money, nor exchaunge of others who were vnder the power of Ferdinand. 
               
            
            After this truce, Ferdinand perceiuing himſelfe to grow old and vnweildy of his bodie, yeelded the kingdome of Hungarie to his ſonne Maximilian, 
               Maximilian made King of Hungarie. with conſent of all the Barons and Lords of the countrie, in acknowledging of which, all the Lords were gratified by Maximilian in all that which hee could doe. Whereupon ſome little while after, Ferdinand ſurpriſed with a great ſicknes, ended his daies, hauing been a Prince of ſingular bountie and valour: and had not his example and wiſedome been, Germanie (which The death of Ferdinand. was greatly eſtranged from the Catholike Church) had been wholly diuided from the vnion of the faithfull, and Eccleſiaſticall ceremonies. This man although he was the ſonne of Philip Duke of Burgongne, Counte of Flanders,  and Archduke of Auſtria, and of Ioane Queene of Spaine, and of other kingdomes: of al his fathers inheritance he had no more then the Archdukedome of Auſtria, with the Eſtates which are ſituated in Germanie: which was the ancient patrimonie of his houſe, the lawes of Spaine being of ſuch qualitie, that the eldeſt haue onely the entire ſucceſſion. Neuertheleſſe, by meanes of his vertue he increaſed the inheritance of his houſe, adding thereto the kingdomes of Hungarie and Bohemia; augmenting by the addition of them, the greatnes of it farre more then it fell vnto him by his predeceſſors. By theſe actions he alwaies made it apparant, that he was endued with great conſtancie, eſpecially towards religion, whereof he became protector,  in ſuch ſort, that laying aſide all his other particular intereſt, he had ſpeciall regard to the people which were committed to him, endeuouring himſelfe to preſerue them againſt hereſies: and indeede not omitting any occaſion or meanes to reduce thoſe to the true knowledge, who were ſtrayed from the

ancient Religion; his good diſpoſition was ſo great towards all the Princes of the Empire, that with a reciprocall amitie he was ſo well affected of them,  that euen thoſe who had important buſines to negotiate with the Emperour Charles his brother, feared not to take him to arbitrate betweene his brother and them: ſo greatly did diuine iuſtice ſhine in him, which comprehendeth in it ſelfe all other vertues.
            Alſo, not without cauſe of his good deedes, as well in generall, as towards particular Princes the Electors of the Empire, continued their election in his familie from the father to the ſonne, almoſt making by this doing this ſucceſſion, not as election, but as it were hereditarie. It is not to be doubted, but that his deceaſe brought great griefe to the hearts of euery one, as it very euidently  appeared by the bewailing, which vniuerſally was made for his death.
            His ſonne Maximilian (who alreadie was choſen King of the Romanes) ſucceeded him in the Empire. This man after he had taken the Crowne, Maximilian made Emperour. the Mantle, and other Emperiall ornaments, was confirmed Emperour by Pope Pius: and ſeeing himſelfe aduanced by this goodly and great dignitie, with augmentation of goods and meanes, hauing of a long time nouriſhed in himſelfe a mortall hatred againſt King Iohn of Tranſiluania, he meant ſuddenly to vndertake the reuenge of many wrongs and loſſes receiued from him: and to doe this, he reſolued to aſſaile him on a ſudden. And for this purpoſe hauing amaſſed a great number of footmen vnder the conduct of  
               Maximilian made warre vpon K. Iohn. 
               Melchior Ballaſsi, and cauſing them ſpeedily to march towards Tranſiluania, he ſuddenly poſſeſſed certaine Fortreſſes. Iohn mightily prouoked at this, that againſt the compoſitions made with Ferdinand, he was ſo wronged by a new King, cauſed alſo his people very quickly to come into the field, and without delay, tooke the direct way againſt Sachmar, a ſtrong place belonging Sachmar taken by Iohn. to Ballaſsi, who had not well prouided for it, miſtruſting rather any other enterpriſe then this. This place was taken by a ſtratagem: Iohn hauing ranged all his people nigh to it about night in an Ambuſcado ſo couert, that without being perceiued, they had commoditie to place themſelues at the  Port, as they opened it to receiue in the Heardſmen, who from the fieldes brought their heards of beaſts into this towne. Ballaſsi vexed at ſuch a loſſe, went from thence and put himſelfe into a great towne (yet not very ſtrong) named Debrezen, in which ordinarily aſſembled many Marchants of diuers countries, and thereunto hauing put fire, he ſpoyled all there about. Debrezen burned by the Emperials.
            
            In the meane time, the King of Tranſiluania hauing reenforced his army with 4000. Turkes, that the Baſha of Buda ſent him by the commaund of Solyman, came to force the towne of Hadao, and by compoſition he alſo made himſelfe maſter of Atauiar: and leading about many priſoners, went Hadao and Atauiar taken by Iohn. and beſieged the place of Vngar. The Emperour not ignorant of this that his enemie was ſuddenly fortified, with the ayde which was ſent him from  Buda, had alſo diſpatched a great number of Lanſquenets, and ſome Caualarie, vnder the charge of Purchaſtaler, Captaine and Gouernour of Vngar. A good part of theſe troupes were alreadie entered into this place, when Iohn arriued there with his armie: and this ſuccour came thither in ſo happie

a time, that the enemie (notwithſtanding all his endeuour) was forced to  raiſe his ſiege, hauing loſt there 4000. men at one charge, which Purchaſtaler came and gaue him, while he was not attentiue to any thing, but to the beſieged: this Captaine hauing vſed this policie, that planting his Cannon vpon the flanke of the enemy, &amp; couering it with his people, becauſe he would not haue it diſcouered when they came to hand-ſtrokes: at the firſt ſignall his people (as it were flying) retired themſelues from before their Artillerie, which then being fitly diſcharged, made a great butcherie of his enemies, and put them into ſuch diſorder, that the Germanes had a great hand of thoſe who were come out of the trenches of the Campe to fight with them. All this ſerued to no other end, but the more to kindle the fire betweene theſe two Princes, both the one and the other being willing to reuenge  themſelues, whileſt Iohn being ſuccoured by the Turkes, who liked it better to haue a weake neighbour for their friend, then a neighbour who was ſtrong and puiſſant. Maximilian alſo thinking, that thereby he loſt much of his honour at the beginning of his Empire, did daily make new leauies of ſouldiours: and ſeeing he had to doe with a partie more ſtrong then he thought for, made Lazare Schuendy (an ancient and very expert Captaine) his Lazare Schuendy Lieutenant generall in Hungarie for Maximilian. Lieutenant in this warre, and one who had attained great experience by the paſſed warres vnder the Emperour Ferdinand, in the ſame countrie of Hungarie, as wee before haue written. For the reſt of the yeere, Schuendy could not enterpriſe any thing vpon Tranſiluania, becauſe that he was come too  late into this armie, winter being alreadie come vpon them: ſo that the cold conſtrained him to lodge his people in garriſons vntill the Spring time, furniſhing himſelfe in the meane while with neceſſarie things for the next warre.
            
               Sigiſmond King of Polonia, vncle to Iohn, by reaſon of his ſiſter, conſidering that ſuch preparations would bring but a deſolation to Chriſtendome, and deſiring (for the auoyding of this euill) to pacifie theſe two Princes, enterpoſed himſelfe to treate of an accord betweene them two: and for this effect ſending his Ambaſſadours both to the one and other, he laboured his beſt to reduce them to a peace: but they being both greatly moued, he could  effect nothing. Therefore the Spring approaching, Schuendy (Lieutenant generall for the Emperour) drew his people out of garriſon, and came into the field with an army, drawing towards Tranſiluania, to the end to aſſay the taking of the Caſtle of Tocchay, which is a Fortreſſe very renowned, ſituated vpon the frontire of Hungarie, betweene the riuers Thiſſa and Wodrog, which could not bee very eaſily beſieged, except theſe two riuers were frozen, as then they were. This place was before taken by Cazzianet for the Emperour Ferdinand, who at the perſwaſion of ſome, had giuen it then to a Hungarian Baron of the familie of Scheredy, for recompence of certaine good and great ſeruices which he had done his Maieſtie. This Lord being  deceaſed left one ſonne, who for that he was of yong yeeres, was kept in this Caſtle vnder the gouernment of Francis Nemethy, who of a Tutor became a Nemethy a Tutor ſpoileth his pupil of Tocchay. Tyrant; and vſurping the place for himſelfe, forſooke Maximilians part, and adhered to Iohn. This man being well aſcertained that they would come

and beſiege it, before the enemie preſented himſelfe, he cauſed to bee tranſported  all his moueables, his wife, and pupil, giuing order to that which belonged for the defence of this Fortreſſe. This is built after the manner of the greateſt number of thoſe of Hungarie, not hauing for all the Courtaines The ſiege of Tocchay by the Emperials. but one long rampier of earth flanked with certaine towers, with a good and large Ditch full of water, which then (and for the ruine of the place) was all frozen, and with ſo thicke an ice, that vpon it they might march to the aſſault as vpon plaine ground, and winter being not altogether paſſed, but hauing then his courſe yet very vehement, by reaſon that this countrie is of cold temperature: and when Schuendy made his approaches it was the 4. of Februarie. He had ſuch ſtore of Cannon, that therewith he ſo made his batterie, that on all ſides the towne was battered. But this furie had not any force  againſt the ground, ſo that he was forced vpon the ice to come to the ſap. Whileſt this continued, the aſſieged ſallied forth, and they ſo couragiouſly charged their enemies, that they laid 100. of them dead vpon the ground. But the great number ſurpaſſing their courage, they were conſtrained to retire: and ſeeing their rampiers broken, &amp; the feare to loſe them, cauſed them to parley &amp; promiſe to yeeld themſelues vpon ſome conditions, which (for that they were too much profitable for them) Schuendy would not agree vnto: but cauſed to reare the ladders, by meanes whereof the rampier was wonne, and the towne forced: and with great celeritie the Caſtle was aſſailed. Nemethy not forgetting any thing which might bee for the defence of  the place (as he was a braue ſouldiour, and a valiant and couragious Captaine) by his valour maintained a long time the violence of his enemies, vntill that going and comming here and there, to incourage his people, he was ſhot with a Harquebuze, which threw him dead to the ground. This death cauſed Nemethy ſlaine. preſently his ſouldiours to loſe their courage, who yeelded vpon this agreement, that euery one of them ſhould haue his ſword, and one ſuite of apparell. The Emperials being entered into this place, inriched themſelues Tocchay yeelded. with good bootie, and there they found a quantitie of good and delicate wine. Schuendy ſent the bodie of Nemethy to his wife, who was retired to a Caſtle of his, named Serentſchin, which without any ſtroke giuen, became  vnder the Emperours puiſſance. Within a while after, the Emperials of the garriſon of Agria being aduertiſed that the Turks were gone out of Zolnok, (which was not farre from the Campe) prepared for them a baite and an Ambuſcado, which came ſo well to effect, that 300. Turkes remained there priſoners. On the other ſide, the garriſon of Iauerin being abroad, cut as many in peeces.
            
               Iohn ſeeing how all ſucceeded to the aduancement of his enemie, and that not any profit or commoditie could come to him in retaining the Caſtle of Sachmar (which alreadie had been taken and retaken twice) commaunded  
               Sachmar burned. thoſe within to fire it, and to retire themſelues by priuate and ſecret waies, while Schuendy paſſed Thiſſa (otherwiſe Tibiſcus) with his armie. This paſſage did ſo much aſtoniſh thoſe who kept the Fortreſſe of Eiden, that being Eiden yeelded to the Emperials. only beſieged by ye ſpace of one day, they yeelded without any defence, Ferdinand hauing in former time vſed al his force to get it, by reaſon of the great

reuenewes and profits which come thereof. This good fortune of the Emperour,  was greatly fauoured by the inundations and ouerflowings of Danubius, and of other riuers of Hungarie, and by the rigour of the winter, which in that yeere was ſo vehement, that the birds were found dead vpon A great winter. the ground through cold, and the peaſants were taken lying vpon dunghils in great number halfe dead, who being brought to the fire, recouered their naturall ſpirits. And at the end the raines were ſo abundant, that the ice melting, all the countrie was in a manner drowned, in ſuch ſort, that on all ſides, except the hils, one could ſee nothing but water, and the earth ſeemed to be conuerted to the great Ocean ſea. Theſe marueilous accidents were greatly incommodious for the enterpriſes of Iohn, becauſe that the ſuccours, which  on all ſides were readie vpon the borders of the Turkes prouinces, and of thoſe of his tributaries in the towne of Buda for him, were greatly ſlackened by theſe inconueniences.
            
               Solyman, who was determined to ſuccour and ayde Iohn, both with men and money, and euen with his owne perſon; neuertheleſſe vpon theſe diſcommodities willing to entertaine Maximilian, ſent to him an Ambaſſadour named Marc Libinieſa, a Tranſiluanian reneged Chriſtian, who before time had been at Vienna in the ſame dignitie. His charge was openly to exhort Debatement of peace betweene Maximilian, Solyman, Iohn, &amp; Sigiſmond. the Emperour, to preſerue the pactions and agreements of the peace ſworne by his father. He had alſo there with him for the ſame effect George Bathor 
                Ambaſſadour of Iohn: and for the ſame occaſion the King of Polonia had alſo ſent thither his Ambaſſadour.
            In the meane time, Schuendy vpon theſe Ambaſſages, more then once, aduertiſed the Emperor, yt he ſhould well aduiſe with himſelfe before he made any concluſion tending to an agreement, for feare of being deceiued by the Turkes, vnder a pretence of an accord. Maximilian himſelfe doubted the ſleights of the Turke, knowing that it was but ſome policie to deceiue him. Neuertheleſſe, that he might not ſeeme to haue a minde to diſturbe this treatie of peace, he commanded that the frontier garriſons of Hungarie ſhould not moleſt the Turkes, although that of their part ſuch patience were not vſed, as it was not. For whileſt that at Vienna they treated of pacifying the  differences, and aſſaied to grow to ſome reaſonable agreement, the Turkes greatly endamaged Slauonia, and in Hungarie towards Iula, they made many incurſions, being in the field with the Gouernour of Themeſuar, who had with him 6000. men, two great peeces of Altillerie, and eight Faulcons: he ſpoyling all the countrie thereabouts. With theſe peeces this Gouernour battered and tooke the Caſtle of Pancor, alſo making himſelfe maſter of two other named Seua and Deonec, ſituated by Iula, minding by thoſe to further the ſiege, with which he pretended to enuiron the ſaid place of Iula, towards which were marched 8000. Turkes by another way. 
            
            During theſe treaties at Vienna, it happened that the ſouldiours of the garriſon of Sighet went foorth vpon 200. Rhatians, which they put to the ſword, and tooke two Agaes their Captaines: and as they returned to their garriſon with their priſoners, there ſet vpon them 200. horſe, who enuironed and charged them in ſuch ſort that they brake them, and purſued them ſo

fiercely, that of 600. which they were, there was no more but 200. ſaued.  This happened in the abſence of Captaine Nicholas Eſdrim Counte of Serin, Nicholas Eſdrim Counte of Serin. who then was gone to the Court about ſome vrgent affayres of his own: and it is to be thought that his preſence would haue hindered ſuch diſtaſter. As for Sachmar, which was halfe burned, and altogether abandoned by the Sachmar reeſtabliſhed. Tranſiluanians, Schuendy cauſed it to bee repayred, iudging that that place would bring him ſome commoditie for many conſiderations. In the meane time, whileſt his ſouldiours did daily labour to make it defencible, the enemies came towards that quarter to take a Caſtle thereby, and which was a very fit place greatly to annoy thoſe of Sachmar. Againſt thoſe, the Germanes of the ſaid place of Sachmar going forth with great ſilence, ſuddenly charged their enemies, and they tooke from them 7. Enſignes, after they had  maſſacred the greateſt part of them, and the reſt being almoſt drowned in the riuer, into the which they threw themſelues headlong inconſideratiuely by heapes to ſaue themſelues.
            Sachmar being reeſtabliſhed, and Eraſmus Meiger left there within to commaund, Schuendy tooke the way to Caſſouia, hauing ſome diſtruſt that the Turkes would come thither to beſiege it, as there was ſome apparance thereof: and ſeeing that the forces of the Turke daily increaſed, he importunately ſolicited the Emperour to ſend him new ſuccours, not finding himſelfe furniſhed of that which was needfull for him to the entertainment of ſuch a warre, and againſt ſo puiſſant an enemie. The Emperour ſent him fiue Enſignes  of footmen, of whom was Colonell Iohn Bernard Rothman, with fiue peeces of Artillerie, all the horſes being marked with the letter M. to the end A complot againſt the cō
                  ductors of the Artillerie. that the waggoners &amp; conductors thereof ſhould not by deceit (as it is their cuſtome) ſell the good ones, or to vſe them to ſome other purpoſe. In the meane time, the Turkes (who ouerranne all the countrie, and made there great ſpoyle) determined to take the Fort of Erdeu, neere to Sachmar, which then was in the commaund of Schuendy: and there hauing placed their ſiege Erdeu beſieged by the Turkes. in the beginning of Iune, they made there many a ſhot againſt it, and finally they reared the ladders to enter by force. The aſſieged defended themſelues valiantly, and often repulſing their enemies, they killed more then  800. of them: and fiercely ſallying forth vpon them, they brought away two peeces of their Artillerie. Neuertheleſſe, the Turks not any thing aſtoniſhed thereat, but continuing the batterie more obſtinately, in ſuch ſort that before the powder failed them, they made a great breach in the wall. Captaine Laubemberg, who commaunded in this place, ſeeing the obſtinacie of the Turks, ſent many times to demaund ſuccour of Schuendy. He diſpatched towards him 300. ſouldiours: and conſidering it was not poſſibly that they could enter without great daunger, willing neuertheleſſe to aſſay ſome meanes which he had inuented to put them in, at what price ſoeuer, he commaunded them  to march all the night ſpeedily and without noyſe vnto a forreſt, which was not farre from Erdeu, and where were placed the guards of the Turkiſh Campe: and as for himſelfe, marching with the like diligence, he came to another quarter, from whence ſuddenly he gaue the alarme to the enemies Campe, who preſently were frighted at this vnlooked for comming: and

vpon this rumour the Turkes failed not readily to raunge themſelues vnder  their Enſignes, drawing all to that place from whence came the noyſe of the enemies Drummes and Trumpets: and in the meane time by this ſtratagem, the ſuccour which was vpon their watch, had commoditie to enter into the place. This ſuccour being entered, the aſſieged were more couragious, and regarded nothing, although that the ſiege continued more then a moneth. The Turkes notwithſtanding hotly purſuing the ſiege, procured much trauaile to the aſſieged, and there amongſt others was wounded Laubemberg. A little before there entered a valiant and very expert Captaine named Weller, to ſecond Laubemberg, and to commaund in his place, if any miſhap ſhould befall him. With Weller there was alſo entered Captaine Goſſel, 
                who, in fighting valiantly there dyed. Theſe couragiouſly defending themſelues, maintained it a long time againſt the enemie, who alſo continuing the ſiege with a like courage, daily came to the walls to giue aſſaults: and hauing one night filled the Ditch with faggots, vpon the day following to mount more eaſily to the breach, the aſſieged did carefully lay good ſtore of Cannon powder vpon and vnder the wood. The morning being come, the Turkes comming into the Ditch, with a hope to carrie the place at that time, and the fire alſo ſuddenly taking hold of theſe faggots, by the meanes of certaine ſulphured Darts and burning Lances amongſt the powder, with which this wood was ſeaſoned, preſently was ſeene in the ayre a great flame, which wholly broke the enemies enterpriſe, thoſe remaining there burnt,  who thought to haue gotten the firſt honour, or beſt bootie, and were come thither too ſoone for themſelues. The others retired to their Trenches, but not from the ſiege: but on the contrarie they were ſo ſelfe-willed, that cauſing their batterie to continue day and night, the Fortreſſe was ſeene all open without any defence, although the aſſieged did all their endeuour. In fine, theſe ſeeing themſelues a pray, and certainly iudging that there was no more hope to maintaine themſelues, as well for want of victuals, as men, as alſo by reaſon of the infection and horrible ſtinke which proceeded from the fleſh of the Turkes dead bodies that remained in the Ditch, they came to parley, and the 4. of Auguſt they yeelded to the enemies, the Captaines remaining  priſoners, who alſo preſently were conducted to Buda, and from thence to Erdeu yeelded to the Turkes by compoſition. Conſtantinople. Captaine Weller ſeeing they ſpake to yeeld, choſe rather to dye fighting, then to come vnder the puiſſance and diſcretion of the Turks: this his reſolution was followed by many other ſouldiours. The Emperour hauing had newes of this loſſe, and ſeeing that the treatie of peace which was on foote produced not any good, commanded Schuendy that he ſhould well munition all the places, for feare of being ſurpriſed. And for this effect his Maieſtie ſent him other troupes, as well Caualarie as Infantrie, while in the meane time at Vienna, he cauſed to be celebrated the funerall pomps in honour of Ferdinand his father, where was the Duke Alphonſe of Ferrara.  After which, he cauſed to bee throwne amongſt the people certaine peeces of ſiluer, and other things of value, in token of largeſſe, vſing many other curteſies to the people.
            And his Maieſtie being now diſcharged from theſe ceremonies, his mind

was altogether attentiue to the warre which the Tranſiluanian made againſt him, being furthered and ſuccoured by the forces of the Turkes: and to remedie  it, he cauſed then to be aſſembled all his men of warre, and particularly the Caualarie at Theſchin, cauſing them to march from thence to Schuendy, whom he found at that time buſied againſt the inhabitants of Debrezen the Emperour ſubiects, being greatly moued againſt thoſe, becauſe that for feare of the Turke they had many times giuen victuals to the enemies. To chaſtiſe them from ſuch cowardlines, without giuing notice thereof vnto Debrezen burned by the Emperials. them, he marched towards them with his armie: and hauing ſurpriſed them, he firſt cauſed the towne to be ſacked, and after that he fiered it, reducing all into aſhes. The veſſels and ornaments were carried to Tocchay, from thence  he tooke his way towards Moncat, belonging to Iohn. About this place the Emperours armie many times was badly intreated, the garriſon therof boldly ſeazing vpon the Sutlers of the armie, whom they pilled, robbed, and lead away. Schuendy to reuenge himſelfe vpon them, laid an Ambuſcado, and after faining a skirmiſh, drew them to the fight, and by little and little retiring thence, he cauſed them to fall into the place where he deſired they might be, and by this meanes he had ſome reuenge of them, the moſt part of them remaining dead in the field, the leſſer part being ſaued by flight. Schuendy victorious with the ſpoyles of his enemies, retired to Sachmar. In which place, by reaſon of diuers accidens, there happened ſo many maladies among the  ſouldiours and inhabitants, that daily increaſing, they were conſtrained to goe into the fields and forſake the towne. Vpon this occaſion Schuendy went and incamped by Tibiſcus, fortifying himſelfe with many Trenches. But he was not long in this lodging, before he was ſurpriſed with a very ſore feauer, which tormented him many moneths, not without great diſquietnes to the Emperour, who greatly loued him, hauing iuſt cauſe ſo to doe, repoſing himſelfe wholly vpon him, for the experience which he knew to be in him for the affayres of warre.
            Notwithſtanding that in Tranſiluania the warre proceeded on in this ſort, the treatie of peace was alwaies managed at Conſtanſtinople. But  the Emperour well foreſeeing that this negotiation was but onely to hold him in ſuſpence, while the Grand Seigniour in other places diſpoſed his affayres: and being further aſcertained by Cornouuicchy (who was but come from the Turkes Court, that gentleman alſo aſſuring that they ſhould not hope for any peace, although that after his departure there was giuen him ſome hope thereof) his Maieſtie commaunded that his armie might be prepared, and appointed that 5. Enſignes of Germane Infantrie ſhould muſter at Lepanto, and 300. Vallachians at Poſſon, and 300. Hungariſh horſe about Iauerin. All theſe companies were newly leauied. Theſe (after muſter was taken of them) were charged to march into the field: to which did alſo goe Captaine Adam Iula, and Romer a Knight of Malta, with fiue other Enſignes  of foote. To theſe ioyned foure Enſignes of Germane horſe, and Captaine Derſsi with 300. other ſouldiours. With this ſupplie was furniſhed all the principal places. Within a while after there arriued 600. Germane horſe, and other 500. vnder the conduct of Hoſchirher. Alſo there went to Vienna

Counte Gonther Schuartsbourg, Counte Otting, and Counte Mansfert, Chriſtopher 
                
               Liechtenſtain, and many other great perſonages, who offered their ſeruice to his Maieſtie to be employed in this warre.
            The ſicknes of Schuendy gaue in the meane time commoditie to the Turks more freely to harrie the countrie, then before time they had done, and they Newſtat inriched with mynes of diuers mettals. greatly ſpoyled the countrie about Sachmar, and that of Newſtat (called the Ladies brooke) where is ſeene the mynes of diuers mettals.
            During ſuch courſes, King Iohn, and the Gouernour of Themeſuar approaching very neere to Sachmar, were almoſt ſtriken with an Artillerie bullet, euen as theſe two Lords rid ſide by ſide. The Turkes not yet content to commit ſuch ſpoyle, tooke courage to goe in the night and aſſaile Schuendy 
                in his Campe. But he hauing notice of this attempt, prepared for them an Ambuſcado, which was lodged ſo ſecretly in a forreſt by, that the Turks not doubting any thing thereof, came iuſt vpon it, and being ſuddenly charged, they preſently put themſelues in route, there remaining notwithſtanding in the place no leſſe then 4000. not without daunger alſo that all had been loſt there, if the night had not fauoured the ſlight of thoſe who were beſt mounted, as alſo it greatly ſerued to the Emperials to make their retraict ſafe and ſound into their Campe, after ſuch a checke giuen.
            The Turkiſh Caualarie paſſed further, and preſented themſelues before the walls of Iauerin, and for that it was yet night, it was not permitted to thoſe within to goe forth: but the day being come, and the garriſon ſallying  out of their ports, the Turkes preſently retired. While theſe skirmiſhes and enterpriſes were attempted one againſt another, Graſſuen (a Captaine of 100. Hungariſh horſe) encountring 1000. Turks, and both the one and the other betaking themſelues to their hands, 200. Turkes loſt there their liues, among which was the Gouernour of Lippa, called in their language Beg. Thoſe who were wounded with the ſhot of the Harquebuze, being conducted to the Campe, could not auoyde death, for that the bullets were beſmeared Bullets annoynted with fat cauſe death. with larde. In the meane while the Saxon ſouldiours hearing this skirmiſh, were deſirous to goe forth: but their Generall would not permit them, but hindered them with much adoe. Theſe were onely arriued at the Campe,  well armed, vnder Colonell Henry Glaſenthal, who had for his companion Don Sibotendorf, both men of valour and incomparable boldnes. Betweene them there were 1026. horſe, which were payed by the Elector of Saxonie for fiue moneths. To theſe were ioyned 350. horſe, who followed the Camp at their owne charges. The two armies were incamped no further one from another then a mile, the Emperials being lodged vpon Tibiſcus by a village named Kizar, ſituated vpon the ſhore of the riuer, in the houſes wherof were lodged the principals of the Campe, the whole being fortified with ſtrong Trenches. That of the Turkes was planted beneath the ſaid riuer, and they  had made a bridge vpon the riuer Somos.
            At the ſame time Charles the Archduke of Auſtria being in Stiria, had his people in the field againſt the enemie, who had committed great ſpoyle in the countrie, if that Prince had not remedied it. On the other ſide, the Baſha of Boſſina, the Gouernour of Boſchegne, and the Berbatberg being one day

aſſembled to ouerrunne Slauonia, and to carrie away the countrie people,  hauing encountred Peter Eborce Ban, which ſignifieth Gouernour, the charge was ſo hot, that the Turkes were put to ſlight with great ſlaughter of them, which was ſaid to haue been 5000. and the Berbatberg was there ſore wounded.
            In another place 320. Turkes minding in the night to aſſaile Thrin, the Caualarie of Iaques Sach, with certaine Hungariſh footmen, being gone forth to meete them, killed vpon the place 60. of them, and tooke 65. others of them priſoners.
            During theſe rough skirmiſhes, on the other ſide they treated of peace at A continuation of the treatie of peace. Vienna, there being yet the foreſaid Ambaſſadours. And the Emperour cauſed to be called thither the gentlemen of Hungarie, to conſult with them  vpon the points of agreement which were propounded. And whereas Schuendy could not be rid of his ſicknes, the Emperour ſent to him Paul Veidner a Doctor of Phiſicke, an excellent man in his profeſſion. This man of a Paul Veidner a Phiſition, of a Iew became a Chriſtian. Iew became a Chriſtian. Schuendy notwithſtanding his want of health, forgot nothing of that which appertained for the entertainment of his armie, ſeeing that the Turkes deſiſted not from their courſes, and to prouoke ours to fight with new iniuries. The Emperials on their behalfe did no leſſe. Vpon this occaſion there was betweene them and vs a fierce encounter, wherein were many Turkes ſlaine, and of the principall of the enemies, of whom the bodies were fauourably rendered by Schuendy to thoſe who to demaund  them, were ſent to him by the enemie.
            At another time, as certaine ſouldiours were gone with waggons to forrage to bring ſtraw and oates, they were taken by certaine Turkes who encountred them. This robberie was then done, when a Chiauſs was arriued at the Campe, who was ſent by the Turke to continue the treatie of peace begun. Schuendy requeſted him that he ſhould procure to be rendered vnto him his ſouldiours and baggage which the Turkes had taken, telling him further, that this kinde of dealing did not manifeſt any ſignes nor effects of peace. The Chiauſs anſwered him, that he ſhould preſently ſend ſome troupes after to recouer that which was taken, it being not the intention of  his Prince to breake the agreements of peace. Vpon this anſwer, Schuendy cauſed preſently to mount on horſebacke Captaine Ruebert with his companie of light horſe, to buſie and entertaine the Turkes, and to doe ſo much, that they might not retire vntill he were ſeconded by others which ſhould follow him. The diligence was ſo great both of the one and of the other, that hauing ouertaken the enemies, they had all their waggons which were on this ſide the bridge: but thoſe who had alreadie paſſed the bridge, ended their voyage in ſafetie. This recouerie ſo braue and ſuddenly executed, cauſed the Turkes to remoue their Campe, which was neere to the Emperials,  who alſo did the like, marching towards Caſſouia, that they might more commodiouſly haue victuals, which began to faile in their Campe: beſides that, the ſouldiours were greatly troubled by diuers ſickneſſes: and amongſt other, with bloodie fluxes and peſtilent feauers. A little before the Tranſiluanian alſo was retired, and hauing put his people to winter in garriſons, he

retired into his kingdome, where hauing found that ſome of his ſubiects  and inhabitants ſecretly fauoured Maximilian, he cauſed them all to bee hanged.
            At that time was releaſed from Vienna his Ambaſſadour (who was retained Ambaſſadours are not to be retained for and in place of priſoners taken in the warre. there longer then he was willing) at the inſtance of Ballaſsi, who continually importuned the Emperor not to ſuffer him to depart vntil he had his wife and children, who were carried away at the taking of Sachmar. But this Ambaſſadour complaining of his detaining, his Maieſtie meant not that he ſhould be any longer detained againſt his liking, ſaying, that that would be a breach and violence offered againſt the law of nations, it being not reaſonable to vſe ſuch reuenge for priſoners taken by the right of warre. For  the ſame conſideration was alſo ſent backe Alexander Kendy Secretarie to King Iohn, who iournying towards his maſters Ambaſſadour, was taken in a skirmiſh made againſt certaine Tranſiluanians, who conducted him and endeuoured to bring him into ſome place of ſuretie, and who being thus taken, had been led to Vienna by Iohn Wolgazen.
            
            In the meane time, Schuendy vigilant in his charge, did not ceaſe to ſolicite the Emperour to this, that it would pleaſe him to appoint new companies and ſupplies, although the enemie laboured peace, ſhewing him by liuely reaſons that the practiſes of the Turke were onely but in appearance, and to couer his enterpriſes and deſeignes, knowing that he daily made new leauies of men, to aſſaile the armie of his Maieſtie with the greateſt force hee  could. The Commaunders of the Turkiſh armie knowing the diſtruſt that this great Captaine had of their ſubtelties, writ to him a letter, by which they ſent him word, that they greatly marueiled at him that he would trouble the peace, which was treated of betweene theſe two moſt puiſſant Emperours, which would bring to them both great commoditie. But Schuendy alſo giuing as little credit to their words as to their ſubtelties, ceaſed not (with the principals of the armie) to embrace all the occaſions that might be offered, for the ſeruice of his Prince.
            Vpon this reſolution, Counte Ecchia of Salm (a moſt renowned Captaine) ſeeing himſelfe to haue command ouer a good number of ſouldiours,  was departed from Iauerin the 12. of October, and tooke the way to Alberegalis, Counte Salm enterpriſeth vpon Alberegalis. named in the language of that countrie Stulweijſſuburg, diſtant eight Germane miles from the place from whence he came, being certainly aduertiſed that in this towne there was few men for the defence thereof, thinking by this want eaſily to take it. And as he was but three miles from thence, came a Courier ſent from the Emperour, bringing him expreſſe commaund to returne with his people to Iauerin. The Counte ſorie at the heart, left his voyage, with great diſcontentment of all thoſe who followed him, for the good opinion which they all had to ſee themſelues at ye top of that enterpriſe,  by reaſon of the few ſouldiours which they knew to be in this towne. A ſecret intelligence which the Counte had with the Iudge of this place, gaue them an aſſured hope of victorie, and the rather becauſe that the Iudge (for aſſurance of his faith) had giuen his wife and children in hoſtage, he hauing giuen order that in the night one part of the Artillerie ſhould be remoued,

and the reſt choked, to the end that the Turkes ſhould not therewith at  neede ſerue themſelues, and in the morning as they droue the cattell forth to paſture, the Counte with his people ſhould giue the aſſault to the ports of the towne, and if the Turks (who were but few in number) ſhould put themſelues in defence, the citizens preſently ſhould bandie againſt them, and by that meanes the towne ſhould haue been taken without any great reſiſtance. This exployt being thus giuen ouer by the commaund of the Emperour, there was a good occaſion loſt to recouer this place, which was of ſo great importance. The Iudge ſaued himſelfe at Pallota, fearing his perſon, ſeeing the Emperials had failed in their practiſe. The Turkes hauing diſcouered this enterpriſe, cauſed 40. inhabitants of the towne to bee pitched vpon ſtakes, among which were compriſed many innocent of the fact. This execution  was hindred, becauſe that at that time was earneſtly treated the peace with the Ambaſſadours, who for that purpoſe were come to Vienna: and indeede his Maieſtie had ſent to the Grand Seigniour for Ambaſſadour George Hoſſute, Councellor of the King in the chamber of Hungarie, a man George Hoſſute Ambaſſadour for Maxilian to the Turke. of good vnderſtanding, and conuerſant in the affayres of Princes. Vpon occaſion whereof, it ſeemed not good to the Emperour to raiſe any trouble, vntill it was ſeene what end theſe things would take, which euery one looked vpon in hope of agreement: and for the ſame conſideration, he had alſo commaunded that not any ſhould moleſt the Turkes, and that onely they ſhould reſt themſelues vpon their defence. This Ambaſſadour departing  from the Court, led with him 20. Turkes of good regard, who had been taken in the warre a little before, and were priſoners in the cuſtodie of diuers Hungariſh Lords. Being all arriued at Buda, the Baſha receiued them with much honour, and great ſports, and gaue them ſafe conduct. This negotiation of peace was the cauſe that Augustus the Elector and Duke of Saxonie countermaunded his Caualarie, ſince that vpon the firme hope which was had of the peace, he ſaw that it ſerued to no purpoſe in Hungarie. In like ſort many other Captaines and Germane ſouldiours were diſmiſſed by his Maieſtie, thinking that they ſhould not haue any more to doe. But within a while after ſuch companies were greatly deſired againe, the neceſſitie being  come to make new leauies of men: for that the Turkes deſiſted not from their ordinarie courſes, and greatly to endamage the countrie, daily increaſing new forces. A good part of theſe came and laid ſiege before Newſtat, Newſtat taken by the Turks. and incloſed thoſe who were within, in ſuch ſort, that the Captaine, named Gleſmuner, appointed for the guard of this place, ſeeing he could not defend it, did yeeld it to the enemie, departing foorth with his ſouldiours with a white ſtaffe in his hand. By and by after this place was regained againe by the Emperials, and againe loſt, and finally recouered: ſo that at this day it is in the Emperours commaund. The Turks of another part forraging euen to  Iauerin, led 800. head of cattell, which preſently was recouered by the garriſon. Dersfi (Gouernour of Nitria) ſeeing the Turks ouerrunning the countrie, and to approach nigh him, went forth, and affronting the enemie, on a ſudden cut many of them in peeces, and led with him in his retraict two Agaes priſoners, which are two of the principall Captaines of the Ianiſaries.

A little before was alſo taken a Turke by Sighet, who was come to ſpie this and other places of the countrie. This man being brought before the Archduke  
               Charles, among other things aſſured him, that his Lord would come in perſon into Hungarie, and that within a little time Sighet and Iula ſhould be by him beſ

               d, and that his armie would bee of 600000. men, without counting thoſe which rowed at the ores. Counte Salm had alſo taken certaine other Spies, which aſſured him the like. Another Turke named Scafir Vayda, chiefe Councellor of the Baſha of Buda, and well knowne among all the Hungars to bee a man of ſingular vertue in the managing of warre, was taken, and diſcourſing with Francis Peſthy, had confirmed the ſpeech and confeſſion of the others: ſo that he ſaw not any more hope of peace or truce, but all appearance of warre. And that which made them the more to beleeue  
               Peaſants paying cuſtome to both parts. it, was, that the peaſants (who are remaining vpon the frontiers betweene the Emperour and the Turk, who were wont to pay the tribute both to the one and to the other) had expreſſe commaund, vnder grieuous penalties, not to pay any thing to the Emperials: there being alſo taken by the Caſtle of Papa 80. of our ſouldiours by the Turkes, who did no other thing but daily forrage about Iauerin, and other places of Hungarie, doing infinit miſchiefe: which was an euident ſigne that the hate daily increaſed, and that all hope of peace was cut off. Maximilian aduertiſed by diuers waies of all theſe accidents, and of the great preparatiōs which were appointed at Conſtantinople, gaue order that Iauerin ſhould be fortified, as being of great importance,  and in which place he would make head of all his people. And through all Auſtria he cauſed to be publiſhed, that not any ſhould ſell either wine or corne out of the countrie, and that which was alreadie ſold, and yet not being tranſported, ſhould be retained. He ſent to Sighet for the defence of that place certaine Bohemians and Hungars, with 600. ſouldiours, of whom were Captaines a Vicount of Millan, and a Germane Lord. He alſo diſpatched commiſſions to Captaines to leauie new companies of ſouldiours. And further, conſidering the puiſſance of Solyman, in compariſon of which all theſe preparations of warre could not long ſtand him in ſtead, if he were not ſuccoured with the forces of the Empire (as in ſuch caſes his predeceſſors  had been): for to remedie ſo great a danger, he publiſhed a generall Diet of all the Empire in the towne of Ausbourg, to obtaine of all neceſſarie ſuccour in ſo imminent a perill. The publication hereof was made through all the prouinces of Germanie, the more to haſten the conuocation.

Theſe haue alſo ſome particular offices in the Emperours ſeruice. The Palatin is the firſt of all, and carrieth vp meate to the table. The Duke of Saxonie is the ſoueraigne Iudge  of the Court, and he hath beſides the title of Mareſhall: and the Marqueſſe of Brandebourg is high Chamberlaine. To theſe doe ioyne many other great Princes, who are diſſended from the houſe and race of the Electors, as the Duke of Bauier, with the other Palatins, who are of one familie. The Dukes of Saxonie, the Marqueſſes, and the Burgraues of Brandebourg, and The Elector of Saxonie and the Duke of Bauier the richeſt of them all. then the Dukes of Brunſwick and Lunenburg, very noble and of the moſt ancient houſes of Saxonie, with many other Dukes, Marqueſſes, Lantgraues, Burgraues, Countes, and Barons. Of all theſe the richeſt in reuenew is the Elector of Saxonie, hauing more then 500000. Dollors of yeerely reuenew, and is able to raiſe in his countrie 6000. horſe, and 15000. footmen. After him, the Duke of Bauier is noted, hauing a large countrie, furniſhed  with goodly townes, out of which, beſides the ordinarie reuenew, he draweth 600000. Florins. There is yet the Duke of Cleue, a very puiſſant Prince, who heretofore made warre vpon the Emperour Charles, vncle to Maximilian.

Theſe townes haue gotten their freedome, buying their libertie by money, and bettering their condition by the fauour which they were able to draw from the Emperours, or Princes who ruled them: in ſuch ſort that the citizens thereof, by their induſtrie, trafficke, and bringing into their townes new arts, buying neighbouring Caſtles and Lordſhips, and performing ſome ſpeciall ſeruice to their Lord, haue not onely inlarged t

Other townes haue alſo ſuſtained great warres, as that of Breme, Noremberg, and Lubec, which is ſituated vpon the Ocean, and is ſo puiſſant by Lubec wealthie. ſea and land, that it hath alwaies in a manner at pleaſure, chaſed and repulſed the Kings of Denmarke. There is alſo beſides theſe, many other townes very famous, as Collon, and Ausbourg. Which laſt hath the richeſt citizens that are in Germanie. There is alſo of this number, Spire, Vormes, Ausbourg rich. Vlm, Roſtoc, Ratisbone, with many other great cities, which for breuitie I omit. There is yet of others, which for the preſent are diſmembred from the bodie of this great Prouince, and poſſeſſed by other Princes, or neighbour  States, as Metz, Thoul, Verdun, Baſile, Geneua, Lucerna, Roteuilla, Moluze, and Cambray, which are vnder the dominion of the French, Spaniards, and Swiſſes. The towne of Danzic (ſituated at the mouth of the riuer Viſtula within the Ocean ſea, and being the Staple of the greateſt part of Danzie. the North) and the towne of Eluine are reduced together with Pruſſia, ſince the yeere 1525. vnder the Crowne of Polonia. Conſtance is vnder the King of the Romanes, and many other vnder diuers Princes. All theſe Eccleſiaſticall and Secular Princes, and free townes, appeare at theſe Diets publiſhed by the Emperours commaund, who, in that he cannot abſolutely command them, procureth theſe aſſemblies, to the end that in them he might aduiſe what were profitable and beneficiall for all in generall. At theſe Diets as  there is three Eſtates, who are there, ſo alſo doe they make three ſeuerall The policie which is held at the Diets. Councels. In the firſt come none but the ſixe Electors: into the other both the Eccleſiaſticall and Secular Princes: and into the third, among all the Abbots of the Empire there entereth no more but two, and among all the Counts and Barons two others: and alſo there enter thereinto the Deligates of the free townes. To all of them is propounded by the Emperour, or by the King of the Romanes, all that which he thinketh of to be decided: and euery Councel diuided and retired apart, determineth vpon that which hath been propounded. It is true that the townes ſpeake not their opinion, but by the voyce of the Councell, not hauing any voyce for reſolution. 
            
            All theſe States were thus aſſembled by Maximilian in the towne of Auſbourg, to the end to draw from them in ſo great and vrgent occaſion, the ayde and ſuccours which hee thought neceſſarie for generall good, and as his predeceſſors had obtained and gotten in time paſt vpon like occurrances. And to the end that by his example all the aſſembled ſhould vſe more diligence, he was the firſt that went to the Diet, well knowing that ſlacknes herein would bring imminent daunger, and that the Turk with great promtitude prepared his forces to come and charge him. And although it was  hardly to be beleeued that Solyman being ſo old and diſeaſed, would himſelf in perſon execute this enterpriſe: yet neuertheleſſe the great preparations which he made, were ſuch, that they gaue ſufficient occaſion to think that there was ſomething in hand. Therefore dutie and neceſſitie required, that Maximilian ſhould at leaſt be prepared to defend himſelfe from the violence

of his enemie. Being then arriued at Ausbourg, he ſolicited the Electors  and other Princes and States of Germanie to make ſpeede to come thither. But at the beginning, theſe Princes alleadged ſome lets, which hindered and retained them backe. The principall excuſe was grounded vpon the warre which was betweene the Kings of Denmark and Sweden, by meanes wherof Warre betweene the Kings of Sweden and Denmarke. there were brewed in the confines of the territories and countries of the one and of the other, many practiſes. And it ſeemed that vpon this occaſion this Diet ſhould either be wholly diſſolued, or at the leaſt deferred vntill an other time, without ordaining any other thing.
            Theſe tumults of warre were a little before ſtirred vp betweene two brothers, Dukes of Michelbourg in Saxonie for the towne of Roſtoch, which being poſſeſſed with great forces by the eldeſt ſonne, was beſieged by the  yonger. The one was fauoured by the King of Denmarke, for that he was of his alliance, and the other was ſuccoured by the King of Sweden, who with fayre promiſes and money entertained theſe Princes in warre, with policie alwaies to hold the Prouince in trouble. The Emperour ſeeing that theſe warres brought great hurt to his enterpriſes, and great preiudice to the Empire, ſent to theſe two Princes certaine Lords of his Court, to ſignifie to them that they ſhould grow to agreement. This negotiation was ſo well managed, that within a little time all was pacified, to the praiſe of his Maieſtie, and to the good and quiet of the countrie. This accord ſucceeding thus to effect, the Emperour alſo purpoſed to accord theſe two Kings. He of  Sweden thanking his Maieſtie, for ſo good an affection which he manifeſted The King of Sweden referreth himſelfe to the Emperour Maximilian. to the peace and vniuerſall tranquilitie, offered to ſubmit himſelfe to all honeſt and reaſonable conditions. And for this effect he diſpatched to the Emperour the Duke of Pomeraine, and Duke Iohn Frederic of Saxonie his vncle by the mothers ſide, to whom he committed all his rights and titles to decide them with Maximilian.
            
            The other difficultie (which held certaine Princes Electors not to come to this Diet) was by reaſon of a certaine contention ſtirred vp betweene two other brothers Dukes of Viuaria, ſonnes in law to the Palatin, becauſe of the diuiſion of their ſtates and lands, and ſpecially for certaine ſtrong places,  which were in the gouernment of the eldeſt ſonne, with euident loſſe of the yonger: for that of three brothers the laſt being dead, the other two, which were Iohn Frederic, &amp; William, being accorded, now the eldeſt hauing begun to manage the eſtate of him that was dead one whole yeere together one after another, and gouerned by the ſpace of the limited time, would not neuertheleſſe yeeld to his brother, being moued with the ſweetnes of commaund. The Elector Palatin was greatly buſied to accord them, as alſo was the Elector of Saxonie, who had been requeſted thereunto by the Palatin: and to accompliſh it, they did meete together at Lipſia, where the  younger brother was preſent. And for that in their allegations there were ſhewed many difficulties, which could not eaſily be reſolued, the whole was remitted to the Diet. On the otherſide, Philip Lantgraue of Heſſe excuſed himſelfe that he could not be at this aſſemblie, becauſe of the nuptials of one of his ſonnes with the Duke of Wirtembergs daughter. This very ſubiect

hindered 13. other Proteſtant Princes from being there, inſomuch that for this occaſion the beginning of this Diet was proroged. They celebrated  theſe nuptials at Maſpurg, and by reaſon of the aſſembly of ſo many Princes, Proteſtant Princes in rumour againſt Count Palatin, for that he had changed his religion. the Emperour was greatly troubled to know what diſcourſe they would vſe therein, fearing leaſt ſuch a reſort would bring ſome alteration in the affayres of religion, which would hinder his proceedings againſt the Turke. That which made his Maieſtie moſt of all to diſtruſt, was, that euery one knew wel enough that all theſe Princes had done their beſt endeuour to reduce the Count Palatin (who leauing the Confeſſion of Ausbourg, had taken the religion of Geneua) not preuailing any thing with him thereby. Theſe Princes were Philip Lantgraue of Heſſe, with William and Lewis his children; Philip 
                Duke of Hulſt; Herneſt Duke of Brunſwick; Chriſtopher Duke of Wirtemberg, father of the married, and two of his children, and two of the Count Palatin; Wolfang Palatin Duke of Bipont, with his ſonne; and Iohn George ſonne of the Marqueſſe of Brandeburg, who for the indiſpoſition and ſicknes of his father returned preſently to him.
            Theſe affayres held the Emperours minde in great ſuſpence, in vaine expecting theſe Princes at Ausbourg, hauing none with him but the Empreſſe, the Duke of Bauier with the Dutches, and Ferdinand her ſonne: and ſo much the more did it torment him, for that he daily heard the bruites to increaſe of Solymans preparation: and alſo he had certaine notice that the Tranſiluanian leauied men, in ſuch ſort that he was out of all doubt, but that  the next yeere he ſhould haue all the warre vpon his ſhoulders.
            The Princes of Germanie vnderſtanding this newes, and ſeeing they could not be at the Diet ſo ſoone as their dutie required, ſent their Deligates to the Emperour, with entire authoritie to negotiate in their name, vntill they could finde the meanes to come themſelues in perſon to the Diet. But the Emperour would not begin any thing, deſiring the preſence of their perſons in ſuch important affayres. For this cauſe he often ſent to them meſſenger vpon meſſenger.
            They negotiated at the ſame time with his Maieſtie an alliance with the A negotiation for the mariage of Charles the 9. King of France. King of France, and for the proſecuting of this, there came to the Court the  Biſhop of Remes, who hauing left there his Agent and Secretarie, he returned into France, with determination to returne very quickly.
            As the Emperour ſearched all the meanes to defend himſelfe from the enemie, Sigiſmond King of Polonia on the other ſide endeuoured to make an Sigiſmond King of Polonia hindered by the Duke of Muſcouia from making peace betweene the Emperour and King Iohn. accord betweene him and King Iohn his nephew. But this good worke was diſſwaded and drawne backe, to the great damage of Chriſtendome, this Prince being conſtrained to employ all his thoughts for the defence of his countrie againſt the Duke of Muſcouia, who notwithſtanding the peace made betweene them, had taken away a part of Liuonia. The Bohemians and Hungars in the meane while by their King ſolicited the Emperour, offering  to ayde him in this warre, according to the neceſſitie and their abilities. As much alſo did the Kings of Denmarke and Sweden promiſe him, who had referred all their differences into his hands.
            By theſe practiſes his Maieſtie alwaies diſpatched ſomething tending to

the end of his intention, expecting the execution of this Diet, which he deſired to be confirmed by the preſence of all the Orders and States of the Empire:  for which neuertheleſſe there was not any thing done of a long time; during which, Shrofetide was come. Many Lords of the Court (to make it appeare that they were not amazed for the newes which ranne of the Turks menaces) forgot not to ſolemnize this day (after the accuſtomed manner) with mummeries and pleaſant ſports. In the end, the Lords began to ſet forward to the Diet, and the firſt that came thither was the Marqueſſe of Brandebourg: but he againe falling ſicke by the way, was conſtrained to returne, The Princes of the Empire arriued at the Diet. and ſent thither his ſonne George, and his nephewes with 300. horſe, with commiſſion not to ſtirre from the Court, vntill ſome new commandement.  There alſo arriued the Elector of Mentz, whom the Emperour went to meet halfe a mile out of the towne, and very curteouſly accompanied him euen The Emperor went to meete the Elector of Mentz. to his lodging. At the ſame time came thither Cardinall Commendon, he being come thither in poſt ſent from the Pope: but in the ſtate of a priuate man at the firſt, vntill ſuch time as within a while after there came thither Iohn Andrew Calligny his Auditor, with the Croſſe, and authoritie of Legate. This man was very well receiued and entertained by the Emperour, there being no other in the Popes name of ſuch qualitie, although two other Cardinals were there preſent, to wit, he of Ausbourg, and he of Altemps, who were there as Princes of the Empire. 
            
            In the meane time the Emperour conſidering the importance of this warre, beſides the ſuccours which he hoped from the Empire, meant alſo to haue obtained ſome other of the Pope: and to accompliſh it, he gaue commiſſion therefore to Rumiler his Chamberlaine, whom he ſent to Rome to congratulate with the Pope, who was newly come to the Pontificall dignitie, and in like manner to require ayde and ſuccours for the warre of Hungarie. The Pope very willingly promiſed him all fauour, aſſigning him 50000. Succours frō the Pope to the Emperor. crownes by yeere, and then ſending him two payes, whereof the laſt was carried by the Lord of Billy, who went towards his Maieſtie, in the place of a Nuncio. 
            
            During this Lent, Maximilian often going to Sermons and Maſſe, according to the example of his predeceſſors, gaue proofe that he was very Catholike. Going to theſe deuotions, the Proteſtants forebore not to accompanie The manner of Proteſtant Princes accompanying the Emperour to ye Church. him, but at his entrie they retired apart, attending vntill Maſſe was ſaid, to conduct him againe in his Palace: in which he often feaſted them with royall banquets, there being aſſembled the Eccleſiaſticall and Secular Princes, and being there together, they were ſet euery one at the table according to their degrees and qualities.
            Seeing this falleth out ſo fitly to our purpoſe, it ſhall not bee a ſtrange, but rather a pleaſant thing for the beautifying of the hiſtorie, if I write the manner The place and office of the Electors in publike acts. of the placing of theſe Electors at ſuch feaſts, and eſpecially in thoſe  which are ſolemne, and doe depend of great Emperial ceremonies, in which the Emperour, or the King of the Romanes, ſolemnely holding their Court, the Princes Electors are to execute their offices and charges. In this caſe the order is thus. The Emperour, or King of the Romanes ſitting in his Emperiall

throne, the Duke of Saxonie beginneth firſt to execute his office in this  ſort. Before the erection of the Emperiall ſeate is laid a great heape of oates, of ſuch heigth that it may touch the breaſt of the horſe, vpon which the Duke ſhall be mounted, he holding in his hand a ſiluer ſtaffe, and alſo a meaſure of ſiluer, they both weighing 12. markes, and vpon his horſe there is ſet (taken from this heape) a meaſure of oates, and is giuen to the chiefe groome of the ſtable, who muſt bee preſent: and that being done, and he fixing his ſtaffe within the heape, his Vicemarſhall of Papenhein (or ſome other executing this charge in his abſence) being Marſhall of the Court, diſtributeth the reſt of the oates. The Emperour, or the King being entered into his hall, and there ſet at the table, the Eccleſiaſticall Electors being ſomewhat below,  and ſtanding before it, with the other Prelates, muſt (according to their accuſtomed manner) ſay grace, euery one according to his place: to wit, euery one according to the antiquitie of his conſecration in the Archiepiſcopall dignitie. One alone neuertheleſſe ſaieth grace for that day: &amp; the day following (if the ceremonie continueth) the ſecond that is conſecrated to that honour doth it: and on the third day, the third bleſſeth the table. Grace being ended, theſe three Archbiſhop Electors take the Emperiall ſeales from the hand of the Chancellors of the Court: and he (in the Archchancellorſhip of whom this ceremonie and ſolemnitie is vſed) going in the middeſt, and the two other being of each hand, they all three raiſe with their hands a ſtaffe, at which are hanging the Seales, and in this ſort they reuerently carrie  it before the Emperour, laying them vpon the table. The Emperour, or the King doe preſently redeliuer them to them againe, and he who then is in his Archchancellorie taketh the greateſt of theſe Seales, and keepeth it till dinner be done, hanging it about his neck, vntill he returneth to his owne lodging. The ſtaffe with which they carrie theſe Seales is of ſiluer, and weigheth twelue markes. The price thereof, as well for the ſubſtance as for the faſhion of it, is at the charges of the three Archbiſhops, and is giuen within a while after by them with the Seales to the Chancellors of the Court, to doe therewith what they pleaſe. He of thoſe three that ſhall carrie to his lodging the great Seale hanging about his necke, ſhall preſently ſend it backe by one of  his ſeruants to the Chancellor of the Court on horſeback, which horſe ſhall remaine to the ſaid Chancellor for a gift.
            After that, the Marqueſſe of Brandebourg (great Chamberlaine) commeth riding, carrying in his hand ſiluer baſons weighing twelue markes, and water, with a fayre towell: and afterwards lighting from his horſe, he offereth the Emperour or the King to waſh.
            Count Palatin of Rhein doth in like ſort enter on horſebacke, holding in his hand foure ſiluer diſhes, euery one weighing three marks, wherein there is meate, who being diſmounted, he ſetteth it vpon the table before the Emperour.  Afterwards alſo commeth on horſebacke the King of Bohemia the chiefe Taſter, carrying in his hand a napkin, and a ſiluer cup couered, weighing twelue markes, full of wine mixed with water: and after being deſcended from his horſe, he preſenteth it to the Emperour to drinke. Now concerning all theſe ſiluer veſſels, the office being ended by theſe Secular Lords,

the Vicechamberlaine of Falkenſtein hath the Marqueſſes horſe and baſons  which he preſents: the maſter of the kitchin of Noremberg hath the horſe and the diſhes of the Count: the Vicetaſter of Lymbourg hath to his vſe the horſe, and the cup of the King of Bohemia: the Vicemarſhall of Papenhein hath the horſe, ſtaffe, and the meaſure of the Duke. The Emperiall table is raiſed higher by ſixe foote then the other: and thereat (during ſuch ſolemne daies) no man doth ſit but the Emperour. Neere his is that of the Empreſſe lower then the Emperours by three foote, and three foote higher then thoſe of the Electors, for which there is 7. cubbords, to wit, three on the right hand of the Emperours table, and three on the left hand, and the laſt is right againſt the Emperour. At thoſe alſo doe not any ſit but the Princes Electors: and euery one of thoſe ſtand before his owne table, vntill all  haue accompliſhed that which they ought to doe by their office, as we haue ſet downe, and then afterwards euery one ſitteth downe at his owne table. The Archbiſhop of Treuers hath for his table that which is before the Emperour. The firſt table on the right ſide is for one of the two other Archbiſhops, in whoſe Archchancellorie this ſolemnitie is performed. The ſecond of the ſame ſide is for the King of Bohemia: and the third is for the Count Palatin. The firſt of the other ranke (which is on the left hand) is for the other Archbiſhop: the ſecond is for the Duke of Saxonie: and the third and laſt belongeth to the Marqueſſe of Brandebourg. And although it bee lawfull for one of the Electors that is kept backe by ſicknes, or ſome other  lawfull inconuenience, to ſend an Ambaſſadour, with full commiſſion in ſuch ſolemnities and aſſemblies, neuertheleſſe he who is ſent doth not ſit in the ſeate, nor in the place of his Maſter. Theſe ſolemnities ended, the Maſter of the Court hath for his part all the building and preparations of wood, which hath been erected for the Emperiall ſeate. Dinner being ended, and graces ſaid by him who bleſſed the table, and all theſe Princes riſing vp to conduct the Emperiall Maieſtie, the Archbiſhop of Treuers goeth alone before the Emperour, and between him and the Emperour the Duke of Saxonie holdeth his place. On the right hand of the Duke is Count Palatin, and on the left is the Marqueſſe of Brandebourg. Of the two other Archbiſhops  he which is in his Archchancellorie, is placed on the rightſide of the Emperour, and the other is placed on the left: and behind the Emperour immediatly goeth the King of Bohemia. This manner of going amongſt the Electors, is onely when in ſuch ſolemnities the Secular carrie the markes and Emperiall Enſignes, to wit, the Duke of Saxonie the Emperiall or royall Sword: Count Palatin the Globe: and the Marqueſſe of Brandebourg the Scepter. But when theſe Emperiall Enſignes are not borne, the Duke of Saxonie goeth not betweene the Emperour and the Archbiſhop of Treuers, who then immediatly preceadeth and goeth alone before his Maieſtie. And  in this caſe the other Seculars go in the ſame order which we haue ſet downe in their place. This order of placing them is ordinarily kept at the feaſts and banquets which Maximilian made to the Electors and other Princes of the Empire: but not the foreſaid ceremonies. And this order is ſo exactly obſerued, that what King ſoeuer ſhould happen to arriue in the Emperours

Court, he ſhall in no ſort be permitted to goe before the King of Bohemia. 
            
            Now to returne to this Diet of Ausbourg: After the Archbiſhop of Mentz, there came thither he of Colon, and alſo preſently after he of Treuers. The Duke of Cleueland came after, and the Archbiſhop of Saltzbourg, and certaine other Princes. After theſe followed the Duke of Saxonie, who arriued honourably accompanied. After came the King of Denmarkes ſonne, the Dukes of Holſtain, and Litters, with about 900. horſe. Then came thither George Frederic of Eniſpach, followed with a goodly troupe of horſe, euen then when the Emperour, at the inſtance of the Elector of Saxonie, cauſed to be impriſoned Albert Roſemberg, a ſeditious man,  and a companion of Grompach, who was baniſhed the Empire. Duke Iohn William of Venimarch, ſonne in law of the Palatin Elector, and Count Francis Philip of Rhein, with a great traine of horſe arriued there. There came afterwards the Cardinall of Ausbourg, and Count Palatin Elector, who was followed with a great troupe of horſe. William Gonzague Duke of Mantua, well accompanied, came to this Diet to ſee and ſalute the Emperour, who The Duke of Sauoy and the Duke of Mantoa came to the ayde of the Emperor. gaue him very great entertainment: as alſo came thither Emanuell Philibert Duke of Sauoy, who offered himſelfe to the warre which ſhould be in Hungarie. Alſo there arriued the Abbot of Kempt, a Prince of the Empire. The Emperour gaue them all great entertainment, minding to gratifie them, to the end that they ſhould all ayde him freely in this warre. 
            
            They thus all appearing in this Diet conformable to his deſire, his Maieſtie the 26. of March cauſed them to aſſemble, and expoſed to them the neceſſitie which conſtrained him to arme himſelfe againſt the Turke, who making great preparation of all ſorts of ſouldiours, was determined to come into Hungarie with the greateſt armie they had yet euer ſeene, with intention to beſiege Vienna, for which (becauſe it was the Emperiall ſeate, and of very great importance to all the Empire and Germanie) it behoued him neceſſarily to prouide: becauſe that beſides the damage which might thereby befall, and would proue ineuitable to euery one, they ſhould receiue infinit ſhame, when this ſhould bee deliuered vnto poſteritie, that Germanie  being ſo puiſſant, did not in ſo imminent a daunger employ it ſelfe to giue remedie thereto in ſeaſon, and before the time of the ruine thereof. To remedie which, his Maieſtie had cauſed all them to bee called at this preſent in a generall aſſemblie. And for this cauſe he exhorted them to lay apart all paſſions, and onely attend to the preſent neceſſitie, and to giue a briefe reſolution vpon this point, which now preſſed them more then any other. Afterwards the Duke of Bauier (in the name of the Emperour) propounded to the Electors and other Princes the articles which here follow.
            That they ſhould treate of the meanes which they ſhould keepe to chaſe Demaunds of the Emperour in the Diet. out the hereſies not compriſed in the peace of the Religion, and which by  it had been prohibited. That the ſuccours demaunded againſt the Turkes aſſaults ſhould be 8000. horſe, and 40000. footmen, payed for 8. moneths; and that the halfe of them ſhould be payed afterwards for 6. whole yeeres: but the whole ſhould be disburſed in money, that it might be employed afterwards

according to the vrgent affayres of the warre. That they ſhould aduiſe  touching the reformation of the Emperiall Chamber, which is eſtabliſhed at Spire, and to cauſe to be wholly obſerued all that which ſhould be there reſolued vpon. That they ſhould procure the entertainment of peace, and the impoſitions of money, and to accord the differences which were betweene certaine Princes concerning their places: and beſides, that they ſhould cauſe to be brought to effect the commaund giuen in the name of the Emperour to his ſubiects, that they ſhould vtterly lay aſide their armes: and for execution thereof, there ſhould bee ſent to them one of his Maieſties Councellors, with the Captaine of Trent. This laſt article was openly executed, and according thereunto they diſpatched Doctor Parthin Councellor to the Emperour. Of all the ſaid articles, the moſt important and the  moſt neceſſarie, was that of ſuccours againſt the Turke. To this demaund it was thought, that of all the Princes there preſent, Count Palatin Elector Offers of ſuccours made to the Emperour by the Princes of the Empire. would moſt oppoſe himſelfe for certaine conſiderations, depending vpon the end which might bee concluded touching the firſt propoſed article, which expreſſely touched him very nigh, by reaſon of the change which he had made in his religion. But euery one found himſelfe deceiued in his opinion. For this Prince was ſo readie to conſent to theſe ſuccours, that preſently he made offer of all his power and meanes. According to his example many promiſed to march in perſon to this warre: and all the Princes made anſwer vpon this article, that they would graunt the Emperour for this expedition  three Romane ſuccours for eight moneths: to wit, 12000. horſe. The Emperour contenting himſelfe with this offer, required onely that in ſtead of the laſt ſuccours for two yeeres and a halfe, he might haue them for three yeeres, taking eight moneths for euery yeere; deſiring them to graunt the halfe of three ſuccours before the time came. This was very willingly graunted to his Maieſtie: for which he greatly thanked all theſe Princes, and promiſed them alwaies to remember their kindnes. The other articles were alſo concluded on, and there reſted nothing elſe, but to treate of Religion. But conſidering the time and the neceſſitie of the Empire, it was reſolued  to deferre this article vntill another time more commodious.
            After that, they ſpake of the agreements of the Kings of Sweden and Denmarke, and commaundement was giuen to them both vnder grieuous Commaundement from the Emperour to the Kings of Sweden and Denmarke. penaltie to lay aſide armes, and it was alſo ordained that not any other Prince of the Empire ſhould giue them ſuccours. Vpon this ordinance the King of Sweden (who ſo willingly had promiſed to obey the Emperour) went back from the accord, they both preparing more egerly then before for new warre.
            There was alſo foure Ambaſſadours who came thither on the behalfe of the 13. Cantons of Switzes, and of thoſe foure 3. were Catholikes, and the other The Switzes ſend to the Diet of Auſbourg. 
                was of the countrie of the Griſons, ſent by the towne of Coire, who was in contention with the Biſhop of the ſaid place. The ſubiects of the Marqueſſe of Final were in like ſort heard, who endeuoured that the Marqueſſe might be depriued of his Marqueſſhip. The Duke of Mantoa alſo required the Emperour that he would end a controuerſie which he had with the

Duke of Sauoy, by reaſon of Caſal ſituated within the Marqueſſhip of  Montferat. All theſe controuerſies partly ended, his Maieſtie ſolemnely gaue to certaine Princes the inueſtitures of their fees or ſeruices, as by them he was required. The Cardinall of Conſtance was one of them, and the Inueſtiture is giuen by the Emperour, and of that which is due for it. Lantgraue of Heſſe, who receiued them by their Deligates. The Abbot of Kempt being there preſent, receiued them from his Maieſtie in his owne perſon: as alſo did the Marqueſſe Iohn Frederic of Eniſpach, and the Prince of Anhalt. The Duke of Saxonie alſo tooke his with the accuſtomed ceremonies, making a magnificall and ſtately ſhew, being accompanied with 1500. horſe, well prepared and richly furniſhed, cauſing to be borne 13. Enſignes. Count Palatin Elector (with many other Lords) receiued the like  inueſtitures, as alſo did the Ambaſſadour of the Duke of Viuaria in the name of his Princes: they all taking by this meanes confirmation of their priuiledges. Thoſe who take ſuch inueſtitures, if they bee Electors, they ſhould pay nothing to the officers: but if they be others, they ought euery one to pay 63. markes of ſiluer, which are diſtributed by the Comptroller of the Court to the officers, in this ſort: He firſt retaineth for himſelfe 10. markes, and after that giueth 10. others to the Chancellor of the Emperiall Court; to the Maſters, Notaries, and Doctors, 3. markes; to the Taſter of Limbourg 10. markes; to the Maſter of the Kitchin of Noremberg 10. markes; to the Vicemarſhall of Papenhein 10. markes; and to the Chamberlaine of Falkenſtein 10. other markes: prouided that ſuch officers be then preſent at the  Court executing their charges: and in their abſence thoſe which doe their office take this profit. The horſe, or ſome other beaſt vpon which he is mounted who requireth his inueſtiture, is due to the Duke of Saxonie, if he be preſent, or to the Vicemarſhall, if he be there: and in abſence both of the one and other, it is due to him who then doth execute their office. All theſe things being diſpatched in this Diet, the Emperor gaue order at ye end thereof, that all that which had been determined vpon for the warre, ſhould preſently be in a readines. And after hauing diſmiſſed euery one, and taken leaue of all, he went to Vienna, where he appointed a Diet to the ſubiects of his other Eſtates to bee held the 23. of Aprill. In it, his Maieſtie being there  preſent, it was ordained that euery houſe ſhould pay a florin: that a gentleman Ordinances made in Auſtria to draw ſuccours againſt the Turkes. who had more then 100. florins of reuenew by the yeere, ſhould keepe a good horſe readie at his owne coſts and charges: that the peaſants ſhould bee ſent by certaine bands and daies to Vienna to fortifie it: that not any ſhould receiue a ſeruant without teſtimonie of his life, and that from his laſt maſter: that for euery houſe, the 5. the 10. the 30. (if there were ſo many therein) ſhould be inioyned to go to the warre: that throughout the whole countrie of Auſtria, Morauia, and the confines of Hungarie, all ſhould be prohibited to take pay of the enemie: and that all the citizens and inhabitants of  Vienna, ſhould prouide themſelues of victuals for one yeere, and that he who had not the meanes ſhould depart the countrie.
            The Archduke Charles, brother to the Emperour, for the ſame occaſion aſſembled another Diet at Poſon in Hungarie, in which he found all the Hungarian Barons and Lords ſo diſpoſed, that they offered him all the ſuccours

which he demaunded, and promiſed to march all in perſon to this warre, when the Emperour, or any of his brothers ſhould there bee preſent. 
            
            We haue before written that Count Palatin the Elector was thought to be of opinion, that very hardly he would accord to the great ſuccours which Maximilian demaunded. The intereſt which he might haue to this, that ſuch Occaſion which might cauſe Count Palatin to diſtruſt ſo great a preparation for warre. forces ſhould not bee vnited together by the conſent of all the States of the Empire, was as in regard of his own particular fact, he fearing leaſt this aſſemblie of Princes, and this armie might bee to his preiudice, vnder colour and falſe newes of the Turks enterpriſes: or that he changing his determination, becauſe he ſaw himſelf hindered by the Sophy, or from ſome other place, or  by the meanes of ſome peace or truce made with the Emperour, would containe himſelfe from aſſailing Hungarie, he ſaw then all theſe forces might turne vpon himſelfe, becauſe that he againe had changed his religion, which was conformable to the Confeſſion of Ausbourg, and had taken that which followed the opinion of Zwinglius and Caluin: which was an act formally contrarie to that which was before ordained and concluded on in the yeere 1555. in the towne of Ausbourg by the States of the Empire, in the preſence of Ferdinand the laſt deceaſed Emperour, who then was there aſſiſtant, as King of the Romanes, and as Lieutenant of the Emperour Charles his brother. Ordinance made in Germanie vpon the diuerſitie of religion. This ordinance was made the 24. of September: and the tenour thereof  is this.
            The Emperour and King Ferdinand, by reaſon of the doctrine, religion, and faith, depending on the Confeſſion of Ausbourg, and the other Princes and Eſtates, ſhall not conſtraine nor force any ſubiect of the Empire to forſake their religion, their ceremonies, and lawes, which in their territories they haue alreadie inſtituted, or ſhall hereafter inſtitute, being aſſociated to that Confeſſion: and by any commaunds, or other way not to force them to doe it, and not in any thing to contemne them. But ſhall freely permit them this religion, with their goods, faculties, tributes, tols, poſſeſſions, and rights, in ſuch ſort that they may enioy them peaceably. The controuerſie  which is for religion, ſhall be compoſed with milde, amiable, and peaceable reaſons. Thoſe who follow the ſaid Confeſſion, ſhall in like ſort beare themſelues towards the Emperour, King Ferdinand, and other Princes and Eſtates (confederated together in the ancient religion) as well Eccleſiaſticals as Seculars, and towards all the other Eccleſiaſticals, and their Coleages, into what part ſoeuer they are gone to make their abode: ſo that they well and duly procure the miniſtrie therof, as afterwards it ſhall be ſet down. To theſe ſhall they permit in all libertie their religion, ceremonies, lawes, poſſeſſions, tributes, and al other rites: and by any meanes ſhall not hinder them, but that they may enioy them peaceably. 
            
            All the ſuites, differences, and quarels which might riſe betweene the one and other, ſhould be ended, according to the vſe, cuſtome, and lawes of the Empire. Thoſe who are not either of the one or other religion, are not compriſed in this peace. This reſtraint was made to withſtand new troubles, which eaſily enſue vpon the introduction of a new religion. That neuertheleſſe

of Zwinglius being fuller of libertie, and further from the ancient faith  was afterwards more imbraced: and notwithſtanding this ordinance, it hath found place in the countries and territories of the Palatin Elector, as alſo it hath done in Polonia, in Switzerland, in England, in Scotland, and in France: although that the ceremonies thereof are not in all alike, and that there is diuers opinions amongſt the Doctors of it. And although that in Spaine there is great ſeueritie vſed for the preſeruation of the ancient faith, yet neuertheleſſe ſo it is, that about this time in this Prouince certaine were apprehended, who were conuicted by their Confeſſion to hold and follow The opinion of Zwinglius or Caluin diuulged in Spaine, and the puniſhmēt of ſome Sectaries thereof. this new doctrine of Zwinglius: and the puniſhment which was inflicted vpon them, being accompanied with great ceremonies that they adde therevnto,  for a greater terror to the aſſiſtances. I am willing to write the order thereof, although it be from the diſcourſe of this hiſtorie: but ſeeing it falleth out ſo fit to our purpoſe, and that in another place (it may be) I ſhall not haue the like commoditie nor occaſion to ſet it downe in writing I deſire the reader to take this in good part, and to thinke that I adde, and ſometimes entermixe ſtrange diſcourſes, the rather to recreate his minde, then to content my ſelfe, euen as the eye doth more delight it ſelfe to ſee in a fayre medow diuerſitie of flowers, then one onely kinde of colour in a corne field.
            This exemplar puniſhment was performed in the towne of Valladolid, in which for it there is appointed a great Scaffold by the Councell houſe, The notable ceremonie touching the execution which is done in Spaine againſt Heretikes. and another adioyning thereto, wherein the Princes muſt be. About this  place were alſo raiſed other Scaffolds, vpon which muſt bee preſent the Councellors and perſons of qualitie, officers of iuſtice, and Gentlemen not onely of the towne, but almoſt of all the realme. The abundance of people that was there was ſo great, that in mans memorie the like was not heard of. About ten of the clocke the 21. day of May, the Princeſſe Ioane, Gouerneſſe of Spaine, and the Prince Don Charles went forth of the Palace, accompanied with the Archbiſhop of S. Iames, the great Conſtable and Admirall of Caſtile, the Marqueſſe of Aſtorgne, of Denigne, and of Sarmia Comptroller of the Princeſſes houſe, and the Counts of Miranda, of Orſen, of Nieua,  of Modecgne, of Sardeigne, of Zibadea, of Andrade, of Don Garzia of Toledo Gouernour of the Prince, and of many other great perſons. Before them marched two Vſhers with their Maces, two Heraulds with the armes of Spaine, &amp; the Count of Bondie carrying the Sword in his hand: and all this companie conducted the Princes to the lodging which was prepared, adioyning to the ſaid great Scaffold. Vpon the Scaffolds were alreadie the Archbiſhop of Siuill, generall Inquiſitor with thoſe who were of the Councell of the Inquiſition, Roderic Biſhop of Ciuidad, the royall Councell, the Inquiſitors, the Biſhop of Oran, and the Biſhop of Palence. The Princes being preſent at the windowes of their lodgings, they began to carrie a Croſſe couered  with blacke, with the Enſigne of the Office of the Inquiſition: and after marched the Clergie, and priſoners who had bin receiued to penance: and after them thoſe who were condemned to death. This proceſſion departed from the Inquiſition houſe by a high raiſed way made of purpoſe going vnto the ſaid Scaffold: where being all arriued, and euery one ſet therevpon,

Frier Melchior, who afterward was Biſhop of Canaria, being of the  Iacobins Order, began a Sermon: and that ended, the Archbiſhop of Siuill riſing vp, went to the Princeſſe and Prince, and cauſed them to make vpon a Croſſe ſuch an oth as followeth.
            
               It being ordained by the Apoſtolicall decrees, and by the holy Canons, that the Kings ought to ſweare to carrie all fauour to the Catholike faith and Chriſtian religion, you conforming your ſelues to this holy ordinance, your Highneſſes ſweare in the name God, in the name of S. Marie, and by the holy Euangeliſts, &amp; by the ſigne of the Croſſe, vpon which you haue put your hands, to yeeld all fauour, and giue all neceſſarie helpe to the holy office of the Inquiſition and miniſters of the ſame, againſt Heretikes and Apoſtataes,  and againſt all thoſe who fauour and defend them, and againſt all manner of perſons who directly or indirectly hinder the progreſſe of this holy office: and to conſtraine all your ſubiects to obey and obſerue the conſtitutions and Apoſtolike letters, giuen and publiſhed for the ſafetie and defence of our holy Catholike faith, againſt Heretikes, and againſt thoſe who beleeue them, receiue, or defend them.
            
            Vpon theſe ſpeeches the two Princes made anſwer, that ſo they would ſweare. And the Archbiſhop added theſe words. Becauſe of your holy oth, our Lord proſper your royall perſons, and the Eſtates of your Highneſſes for many and long yeeres. By and by after one of the Regiſters, who is there preſent, demaunded of the companie whether they did not ſweare the like  oth. They all made anſwere, I. Then they began to reade the condemnations and iudgements giuen againſt them all, and eſpecially againſt thoſe who were condemned to the fire. And theſe were, Doctor Auguſtine Cazagia, his Maieſties Chaplaine and Preacher, Francis d'Viuero, Dame Betrix d' Viuero, Dame Elenor de Viuero, Alonſo Perez a Prieſt, Antonio Herrezuolo a bachelor, Chriſtopher de Occampo a Licentiate, Francis de Herrera a Licentiate, Iohn Garzia, Chriſtopher de Padillia, Izabella de Straba, Ioane Velaſques Gonzala Vaes a Portugall, Catherin Roman, and Dame Catherin d'Ortegua. Theſe, aſſoone as their iudgement was read, were throwne into the fire. But it being The forme of the Spaniſh Inquiſition. not poſſible but that ſome would deſire to know what manner of proceeding  this Inquiſition is, I (minding therein to ſatisfie euery one, principally in that which may bring ſome vtilitie with delight to the reader) will here write of it as it is practiſed in Spaine, ſeeing it is leſſe knowne then the name thereof in other kingdomes.
            This office was firſt inuented by Ferdinand King of Aragon, who after he had chaſed, or at leaſt ſubdued the kingdome of Granado, which (as almoſt all the reſt of the kingdomes of Spaine) was for many yeeres in the hands of the Mores or Sarazins, who had tamed Spaine from the time that Count Iulian called them thither to reuenge himſelf of the rape and forcement, wherof  K. Roderic of Spaine (of the Gothiſh religion) had vſed againſt his daughter Cana. Ferdinand hauing by ten yeeres warre reduced this kingdome vnder his puiſſance, and permitting the inhabitants thereof to liue in their Mahometane religion, afterward fearing (following the aduice of his wiſeſt Councell) that this permiſſion would bring ſome annoyance to the Chriſtian

religion, by the frequent fellowſhip that theſe inhabitants ſhould haue  with his other ſubiects, reſolued himſelfe intirely to purge this kingdome either by preachings, or force. Some of them chuſed rather to paſſe the ſea and retire into Africke, then to chaunge their religion. Others by effectuall reaſons, or elſe preferring their ſafetie before their religion, were baptized. This charge to conuert them was giuen to the Iacobins. Theſe imployed their time therein with great care. But ſeeing that their paines ſeemed vnprofitable to many, they found a way to ſearch out the meanes, hoping that by feare they ſhould keep them in the obſeruation of the Chriſtian faith, which otherwiſe they did not greatly regard. This way was authoriſed by the King, and confirmed by Pope Sixtus. After that the King himſelfe hauing  vnderſtood that theſe Friers vſed too ſeuere rigour, and that they indeede committed a great abuſe therein. This finding them out, otherwiſe called an Inquiſition, comming of this word enquire, was taken from them, and committed into the hands of the moſt ſufficient Eccleſiaſticall Seculars. To theſe if any be preſented as thinking ill of the faith, he is preſently ſummoned by a Sergeant, whom they call a Familier: and appearing at the day, (whereof he muſt not faile) if he auoucheth nothing of that whereof he is accuſed, he is ſent backe againe: but there is charge ſecretly giuen to a Spye to haue an eye of him, and to note his doings, and know what talke he vſeth in companie. If there be diſcouered againſt him any thing of euill, preſently  the report thereof is made to the Inquiſitors, who againe laie vpon him a new aſſignation. When he appeareth, the informour is hid behinde a tapiſtrie, to acknowledge whether he be the accuſed, and being acknowledged, whether he freely confeſſe yt wherof he is accuſed, or whether by ſubtell interrogations ſomething is drawne from him: if he be a ſtraunger, he is retained: but if he be of the countrie, he is often ſent back againe. After that, they call for the Curate, becauſe that they would not further enterpriſe againſt the ſheepe without the knowledge of his Paſtour, to whom they ſhew the information. Vpon which, all, or at the leaſt three Inquiſitors, ordaine vnder their ſignes a Habeas Corpus. If the accuſed flieth, there is ſent after him a Sergeant of the Inquiſition, to whom they deſcribe the age, ſtature, face,  haire, and ſuch other circumſtances. This Sergeant, if the accuſed be of qualitie, &amp; whoſe doctrine is feared, will follow him through euery place, and he will vſe ſuch diligence that he will attach him. Againſt the other the purſuit is not ſo hot. The accuſed being taken, he is preſently diſpoſſeſſed of his keyes, and they are giuen to a Sergeant and a Notarie, who goeth into his houſe to take an Inuentorie of all his moueables, papers, iewels, and ſuch other things, which they ſequeſter and commit it into the cuſtodie of one of their richeſt neighbours, to anſwere it at the end of the cauſe. All theſe moueables are confiſcated, if the accuſed bee conuicted. The Iaylor  putting this poore infortunate perſon in priſon, ſearcheth whether there bee any thing about him, and taketh from him all but his outward garments. He remaineth there eight daies, and vntill that the Iaylor ſpeaking vnto him counſelleth him to demaund audience. Being before theſe Lords, he is by

them intreated to acknowledge his fact, to diſcharge his conſcience, and to confeſſe his wickednes, promiſing him all fauour, ſo that he doe repent. If  he confeſſeth, they forbeare not to proceede in proceſſe againſt him: if he ſaith nothing, he is returned to priſon, admoniſhing him to thinke well of his fact. There is giuen to him at his requeſt many ſuch audiences without other effect: neither doe they acquaint him with that whereof he is accuſed, for that they had rather conuince him by his owne mouth, if by chance among ſo many interrogatories, it might fall out that he did diſcouer without thinking thereupon ſome matter of his fact. If they can draw nothing from him by this meanes, he is called, &amp; they threaten him to ſend the Fiſcall to him (and this is he whom we call the Kings Attourney) to pleade againſt  him, and that they will proceede againſt him by all direct courſes of law. Beſides theſe threatnings, they preſent to him the Crucifix, and a Miſſall, to cauſe him to ſweare thereupon. If he ſweareth not, he is conuicted: and if he ſweareth, then they demaund of him of what countrie he is, of his kindred, and companions, and ſuch other things, from whence they thinke to draw ſome arguments and preſumptions. Thoſe that be moſt ſubtell, and know their manner to proceede, doe not anſwer but after they haue ſeene the information againſt them. In the end they communicate vnto him the accuſation to anſwer thereto; and he chuſeth a Proctor and an Aduocate to doe it, who taketh his defence in hand, and ſetteth it downe in writing, adding  thereto reaſons and teſtimonies of law: and after giueth them to the Inquiſitors, who peruſe them during three daies together, and afterward cauſe to come before them the accuſed, and the Aduocate who counſelleth him to ſpeake the trueth. If he ſaith nothing, he is againe committed to priſon. Afterward at his requeſt is read to him the information: but it is without naming of any witneſſes, whom if he would take exceptions vnto, he muſt geſſe, if hee will except againſt them. In which often happeneth that which they ſeeke for: which is, that he minding to purge himſelfe he nameth and chargeth others, with whom he had communication of the faith. Thoſe of the wiſer ſort demaund a coppie of the information, and  time to anſwer thereto. Two eye witneſſes are ſufficient to conclude his death, and the Iaylor alone. One ſufficeth for torture, and euery one may accuſe him. The Kings Attourney is a partie, and the informers are witneſſes. Three daies after that he hath had a coppie of his information, he ſhall be called forth. His Aduocate diſcouereth to him the greateſt offences, the ſtrongeſt depoſitions, thoſe which agree, and thoſe which doe not: he telleth him that if he would take exceptions to his witneſſes, he muſt geſſe at them: whereupon they giue him certaine daies, during which he calleth to minde who are his enemies. Enmitie is receiued for ſufficient exception: and the contradiction which is betweene theſe witneſſes: and alſo if the partie accuſed proue, that hauing often reſiſted (ſpecially as in regard of the  deed whereof he is accuſed) the ſame thing againſt him, that hath accuſed him. Theſe daies being paſſed, he deſireth the Iudges to ſee if ſuch and ſuch his enemies are not thoſe who haue informed againſt him. If hee ſurmiſe

amiſſe, he is conuicted: but if he geſſe well, they will not allow it: his Aduocate  onely (who dareth not ſpeake to him but before them) will demaund of him what exceptions he can take againſt thoſe whom he hath nominated. The Aduocate ſhall ſet downe the exceptions in forme: and further demaundeth of him whether he haue any meanes to purge himſelfe by contrarie proofes; as that he hath alwaies been a friend of the Churchmen, obſerued the ceremonies of the Church, heard Maſſes, to haue been at Confeſſion, reuerenced the Croſſe and Images, and done ſuch other deedes. This proofe which is graunted to him, to wit, when he hath no ſtrong and concluding proofe againſt him, muſt bee made within nine daies: and his counterwitneſſes being heard, they conclude the triall after the Kings Attourney  hath taken his concluſions, and before iudgement be giuen, the Diuines (which in this reſpect examine very curiouſly the matter) muſt confirme the doctrine, and declare that the faith of the accuſed is conformable to the Catholike Church: and if the proofe be good, he is abſolued. Neuertheleſſe, for the ſuſpition (which cannot eaſily be taken away) they agrauate, or mitigate the iudgement according as it remaineth: and notwithſtanding his abſolution, he is kept ſtill in priſon vntill after the act of the faith: and all this is done to the end that no man ſhould thinke that the officers of the Inquiſition had cauſed him to bee taken without occaſion. But if the accuſed doe not ſufficiently iuſtifie himſelfe, he is condemned to torture:  afterwards with his Curate or Viccar, they cauſe him to enter by many wickets into a certaine place vnder the ground, very obſcure and hidious, wherein he findeth the Iudges placed. There incontinently is preſent ye executioner, couered with a long blacke linnen robe very ſtraight, like a ſacke, hauing his head and face couered with a blacke hood, hauing but two holes before his eyes. This is done the more to amaze the patient, like as if a diuell ſhould preſent himſelfe to him for the puniſhment of his miſdeedes. Then theſe Iudges perſwade him to tell the trueth, otherwiſe they proteſt that if they breake him or diſioynt ſome member, or if his life yeeldeth to the violence of torments, that the fault thereof ſhall not redound but vpon himſelfe.  That done, he is vnclothed all naked, except the priuie parts, and by ſignes the Iudges notifie to the executioner what torments he ſhould vſe. During theſe, he is often admoniſhed to ſpeake the trueth: and if he will confeſſe nothing, they ſometime martyr him more then two houres. In the end they carrie him to priſon againe, where they haue a Surgeon, who while he applieth phiſick to him, threatneth that he ſhall endure the next day farre greater paines. Oftentimes they put Spies with them in priſon to diſcouer their actions, and euen they enquire of other priſoners if the accuſed hath diſcouered nothing to them of that whereof he is accuſed, promiſing them in caſe they would declare it, that they ſhall not bee puniſhed for their miſdeedes,  for which they haue been committed priſoners. If this accuſed perſon bee of qualitie and note, or that if he take vpon him to preach and to inſtruct, or that he hath learning, theſe officers doe cauſe this bruite to be ſpread abroad, that he hath declared on the torture all his complices, and others

who hath conferred with him concerning the faith: yea they cauſe to bee  witneſſed by the neighbours of the priſon, how they heard him crie in his torture. And vpon this deuice his confederates willing to preuent, and thinking to haue a more light puniſhment, (as the Inquiſitors promiſe to thoſe who voluntarily confeſſe their offence) come to accuſe themſelues. And while theſe priſoners are thus detained, if any among them fall ſicke, they carrie him to the Hoſpitall, which is appointed for thē, where he is well vſed, vntill that afterwards hauing recouered his health, he is then brought backe againe to priſon. And for feare they ſhould bee wronged, the Inquiſitors goe twice the moneth with the Iaylor and a Notarie, to viſit them in priſon, to informe themſelues of their vſage, and to ſupplie their neceſſities,  and doe puniſh the Iaylor if he ſtealeth from them their victuals, or if he incomber them in any thing. In the end the ſolemne day being come, wherein they pronounce and execute their iudgements, naming this the Act of the faith, the night before they cauſe them who are repentant to be confeſſed, after that two daies before that they had declared vnto them what good things they haue in this world; and they cauſe to be clad at the dawning of the day appointed for the execution with the Sambenita thoſe which are to be put to death, which is a yellow robe without ſleeues, painted all ouer with blacke diuels, and vpon their heads they put a paper Miter made in forme of a tower, vpon which is figured a man burning, and diuels about him putting fire to him, and they gagge them with a pegge of wood to hinder  their ſpeech, and with a ſtrong corde they tye their necke and hands. Certaine amongſt them, although they are not of that number which are condemned to death, ceaſe not to weare the Sambenita according to the rigour which ſometimes is vſed againſt them, only to ſhew that their life hath been ſubiect to the Inquiſition, and not to death. Theſe condemned being thus apparelled, they are conducted into the place, as wee haue aboue ſaid. Theſe Iudges haue no other iudgements, but to pronounce the ſentence of curſing and irregularitie. And for this cauſe after they haue pronounced their iudgements, if it bee againſt a conuertite they adde theſe  words; that for ſo much as they doubt that he for feare maketh a good ſhew, and that he is but faintly conuerted, fearing to leaue a wolfe vnder a ſheepes skinne, notwithſtanding his conuerſion they leaue him in the hands of Secular power, whom they pray to vſe mercie towards him, not to breake any member of him, neither to draw from him any one drop of blood. If it bee againſt an obſtinate perſon that they haue pronounced their ſentence, they ſay beſides that ſince it is thus, that their puniſhment hath not ſerued to conuert him, they deliuer him vnto the Secular power to puniſh him according to law, whom they pray neuertheleſſe (if he acknowledge himſelfe) to bee mercifull to him. Theſe Iudges dare not appoint the torture againſt perſons  of marke, and the King of Spaine ſheweth fauour to all puniſhments which are not vnto death.
            By this diſcourſe which I haue made you of this Inquiſition, ſome louing libertie aſwell in their actions, as in their ſpeeches, finde this manner ſtrange;

others would that it were yet more rigorous, deſirous that euery one ſhould  be auſtere like themſelues. But if the one and the other would duly conſider the dangerous euents which further the ſubuerſion of an Eſtate, by the altering of things eſtabliſhed for the maintenance of religion, (which ordinarily doth maſter and exceede all humane paſſions, and doe draw them vnto it with a marueilous vehemencie) they ſhould finde that it were moſt expedient for to keepe themſelues free from ſuch an Inquiſition, to be ſilent, and not to diſpute nor ſpeake by forme (no not ſo much as onely of talke) of precepts, which wee ought to follow by commaundement: which the ancient Common-weales haue wel knowne to put in practiſe at Rome and Athens: and as it is yet obſerued vnder the dominion of the Grand Seigniour, not  without a great eſtabliſhment and maintaining of his Empire, it not being ſo much as permitted in all his territories and Seigniories to any, bee he Turke, Chriſtian, or Iew, to preach or teach, but onely to liue in his law: as the Common-wealth of Venice by ſecret tradition doth keepe and obſerue. It is not my ſubiect to wander further in ſuch politike diſcourſes, but I muſt returne to the purſuite of my hiſtorie.

               THE ARGVMENT OF THE NINTH BOOKE.
               
                  KIng Iohn endeuoreth to ſtir vp the Hungars againſt Maximilian. Solyman marcheth into Hungarie with a great armie. Pallota well defended by Tury againſt the Turkes. Succours come to the Emperour from forraine Princes. Solyman arriueth in Hungarie and beſiegeth Sighet, before which he dyeth, whoſe death was concealed vntill Selim, Solymans eldeſt ſonne was choſen Emperour. The laſt aſſault giuen to Sighet, where Countie Serin gouernour of the towne in ſallying forth, 
                   
                  brauely endeth his happie dayes, and then Sighet is taken. A Diet in Auſtria in which was graunted ſuccours to Maximilian for the war of Hungarie. Peace betweene Selim and Maximilian, who after the death of Iohn King of Tranſiluania, pretendeth title to that kingdome: but Stephen Battor (by the Turkes fauour) is choſen King thereof. The manner and coronation of a King of Hungarie, and namely of Rodulph ſonne to Maximilian. Truce expyred betweene Maximilian and Selim and the death of him, Amurath his ſonne ſucceedeth. Betweene whom and Rodulph (who after the death of his Father Maximilian, is choſen Emperour) a truce is concluded.
               
            
            
               WHileſt the Emperour Maximilian prepared to defend  himſelfe againſt the iniuries of which he was threatned by the Turke, King Iohn alſo carefully fortefying King Iohn drew the Hungers to him. himſelfe, daylie encreaſed his armie, aſwell by new leauies of ſouldiours, as with many Hungarian Lords and Tranſiluanians, who came and voluntarely offered themſelues to ſerue him in this war with good ſtrength. Iohn had thus gayned many of them by particular letters ſent to euery one: and to draw them the more to him, he cauſed letters to be publiſhed, in the name of the King of Hungarie directed to all the Nobilitie and people of the countrie, by which he endeauored  himſelfe to proue that his cauſe was iuſt, and exhorted them to follow his part, adding that which here followeth.
            
               The moſt puiſſant Emperour of the Turkes our moſt mercifull benifactour hath commaunded vs by his letters, and by Zeuſic his Ambaſſadour,

that we ſhould exhort al the eſtates of our Realmes and countrie to be faithfull  vnto vs, and yeelde vs that obedience which they owe vs: he hauing certified vs that that would be to him verie pleaſant and agreeable, when he ſhould know the Hungars to imbrace one another with a ſincere affection, and to be deſierous amongſt them ſtrictly to preſerue it. Therefore if you feare to diſpleaſe him who with infinit puiſſance is able to chaſtice them who prouoke him: and if you haue in any regarde the fidelitie which you owe to vs, we would councell you all to acknowledge vs for your King and Lord. In doing this, it will be a meanes to preſerue and maintaine this kingdome ſo much afflicted, to reſtore vnto peace all the States thereof, and to giue particularly to euery one an aſſured aboade in his owne houſe: all of  vs cutting off the occaſion which ſo often moueth Solymon to bring an armie into the fielde to ruinate them; and to come himſelfe in perſon to make this waſte with infinit coſt, without reſpecting paynefull, long, and tedious iourneyes which it behoueth him to doe. For this cauſe you ought all to take good heede to your ſelues whileſt the time and ſeaſon is yet fit, before you haue vpon your ſhoulders this his great armie, which alreadie is departed from Conſtantinople. For when you ſhall ſee your fieldes harried, your houſes burnt, your children captiues, and you ſeperated by violence from your wiues, you may then in vaine deſire peace. To auoyde this miſerable ruine, we haue been very willing to cauſe you expreſly to vnderſtand the will of the Grand Seigniour, and thereupon to ſhew in generall to all, what  is the preſent eſtate of publike matters, and to deſire you in conſideration thereof, to haue regarde to the peace and repoſe of euery one, and by that meanes to deliuer your ſelues from the perill of war, and of the daunger preſent, and to come, which hangeth ouer the heads of euery one.
            
            By theſe and many other reaſons, Iohn endeauored to ſtir vp the Hungars to follow his part, and to be himſelfe at the Diet which he had appoynted in the towne of Torde in the moneth of March, in which place ſhould aſſemble all the ſtates of his kingdome, to aduiſe together of that which was neceſſarie for the preſeruation of it. Theſe letters being bruited abroade, and the knowledge thereof being come to Schuendy, who then was at Vnghar  with his armie. He preſently fearing that theſe letters would alter the affection of ſome, and that the menaces of the Turkes greatnes compriſed in them, ſhould not poſſeſſe others with feare, cauſed theſe heere in his name to be publiſhed the fourth of March, directing them to the Barons and Lords of Hungarie.
            
               My Lords, there is ſent me from diuers parts the coppie of a letter diuulged vnder the name of Iohn Vayuod of Tranſiluania, full of apparant cullers, and of notorious and euident deceites, with which hee endeauoreth to aſtoniſh the Emperours ſubiects, as if Solyman were very curious of the  good and preſeruation of the Hungars, whom theſe 100. yeares together he and his prediceſſors haue labored with all their power wholly to ruinate, aſwell by their forces and armes, as by their deuiſions and ciuill warres which he entertaineth amongſt you. And although I make not any doubt but that by your fidelitie, wiſedome, and for the greatnes of the neere and

imminent daunger, you cannot but conſider whereto tendeth ſuch ſubtilties  and deceites. Neuertheleſſe to lighten you the more therein, I could not but aduertiſe you, that the Emperour with all diligence and induſtrie hath ſought nothing more then peace with the Turkes and Prince of Tranſiluania; of which he hoped for a good end, to the content of you all, if the negotiation thereof had not been hindred by the falſe reports and continuall hatred of the Vayuod. And to make proofe thereof vnto you, it behoueth you to remember that this laſt winter his Maieſtie commaunded that the truce ſhould be ſo exactly kept, that for to take away all breach thereof, he cauſed to rayſe the ſiege from before certaine Caſtles and Fortreſſes, which by our people were alreadie neerely driuen, and meant not that Tranſiluania ſhould be forced by our armes; all this he did for the repoſe  and good of this kingdome. Now though the peace which was yet treated of with the Turkes, could not be effected, you ought not for that inconuenience to doubt, that the Emperour will not vndertake your defence, conſidering that the forces of the Empire, and of many other chriſtian Princes (zealous of your good) will not fayle him no more then, I beleeue, you would fayle to the obſeruance of that which dependeth on your fidelitie towards his Maieſtie, in whoſe name, you doing that which belongeth vnto you, I can aſſure you of a peace and future repoſe: deſiring and exhorting you rather to purſue that which is equall, then ſuffering your ſelues to follow (as little children doe) deceitfull amazements, you ſhould imbrace  that which is built vpon a foundation erected againſt all right and reaſon: all of you ſetting before your eyes, that God in puniſhing the vniuſt, and fauoring the iuſt, will aſſiſt you, ſince that in this warre, beſides the maintenance of that which appertaineth by lawfull ſucceſſion to Maximilian, it is alſo a queſtion for the entertayning of his religion, and of our libertie, which we ſee to be aſſayled with ayde from the Turke, by thoſe who falſely would beare the name of Chriſtians, who repoſing themſelues hitherunto in their armes, ſhall finally haue a miſerable and tragike ende, according to their demerits. With theſe I pray you haue no communication, yea, I forbid you in the Emperours name to haue with them any intelligence,  and not to ſend to the Diet which the Vayuod pretendeth to cauſe to beheld at Torde, vpon paine to incurre the puniſhment due to thoſe who ſhew themſelues rebellious to their Prince.
            
            About this time the Captaine of Ainathſchen being gone about his Ainathſchen taken by the Turkes. owne affayres in the towne of Agria, and hauing taken with him for guide the beſt ſouldiours of his garriſon, the neighbouring Turkes being aduertiſed thereof by their ſpies of the Captaines departure, the day following which was Saint George his day, by dawning of the day, they were with ladders vpon the wall, and entring by force into this Fortreſſe, killed all thoſe  whom they found within. At the ſame time the Turkes thinking that the Counte of Serin was alſo abſent from Sighet, came and laide ſiege to that place: but he being retourned from Vienna, whether he was gone to conferre with the Emperour of many things, concerning the fortification of this Fortreſſe, the Turkes found greater reſiſtance there, then they thought

for: and being come to handie ſtrokes, they weare ſo hotly repulſed, and  with ſuch ſlaughter, that among them there remayned two wagons loaden with heades which weare carried to Sighet: and at the bruite of ſo fierce an incounter, thoſe who were at the 5. Churches vnderſtanding of the great loſſe happened to their partie, began to flie and forſake the place. Daylie the Turkes enterpriſed ſuch attempts now againſt Iula, then againſt Iauerin and other places of Hungarie, committing infinite euils.
            In the meane time the Emperour had certaine aduertiſments that Solyman was departed from Conſtantinople to march in perſon to this warre, and Solyman marcheth into Hungarie. that in great iourneyes with 70000. men he was come to Sophia, and by Miſia into Bulgaria, cauſing Portau Baſha to march before with one part of  the Armie, and many Sangiacchs: and that further he had commaunded the Belerbey of Natolia to paſſe by Galipoli, and to come and ioyne himſelfe with him: and that alreadie he was marched almoſt to Buda, where the King of Tranſiluania was gone to meete him with 50. Coaches, 500. horſe well armed, and 300. harquebuziers on horſebacke, carrying with him goodly and very rich preſents in iewels and ouches.
            When Solyman arriued in Hungarie with this equipage, Schuendy held the Forte of Huſte beſieged, which he had ſtraightly ſhut vp, minding to preuent the Turkiſh endeauours; and on the other part in the moneth of Iune, the Baſha of Buda being in fielde with 8000. footemen, and 25. peeces of Artillerie went to be ſiege Pallotta, which is ſituated by Alberegalis 8. miles  from Ianerin. The batterie was ſo furious for the ſpace of 8. dayes, that all Pallotta well defended by Tury againſt the Turkes. the wals were throwen to the ground, the aſſieged remayning in extreame perill. George Tury a couragious Captaine, and of ſingular proweſſe, Gouernour of this place, marching about it to repaire the breaches, and to giue ſuch order thereto as neede required, was ſtrooken on the ſide with a ſhiuer of a ſtone broken with a Cannon bullet: and the ſtroke was ſo violent that he there thought he ſhould loſe his life, whereof would haue been a great loſſe, he hauing many times ſuſtayned and repulſed the violence of the enemie, as a little before this ſiege he had done, when purſuing the Turkes of the garriſon of Alberegalis, together with the Beg, he had  beaten them euen to their towne gates, and in ſuch ſort conſtrayned them, that the Gouernour thereof was forced to throw his Turbant away to ſaue himſelfe, he being ſcarcely knowen. Now although that the wound was daungerous, neuertheleſſe he was within a little while after cured thereof, and while this ſiege laſted he made many ſallies vpon the Turkes, who (after that they had giuen 6. aſſaultes) did nothing elſe but play with the Cannon: and they played ſo much with it while this ſiege laſted, that they gathered vp together within the towne 700. bullets. The Inhabitants were almoſt as a pray to the enemies, and whileſt they thought they could  no longer reſiſt, incontinently and as it were at an inſtant they ſaw themſelues deliuered from that daunger, by reaſon of 12. Enſignes of foote newly arriued at Iauerin vnder Collonel George of Helfenſtain, who the day after his arriuall, cauſing 90. wagons to goe forth, with 900. footemen marched to enter into this place. The vauntcourers of the Turkiſh Armie diſcouering

this troupe, and iudging it to bee farre greater then it was, by reaſon of  waggons which poſſeſſed a large roome among the ſouldiours, who couered and incloſed them, they ſent certaine amongſt them to aduertiſe the Baſha thereof. Theſe by their report making the daunger a great deale more then it was, preſently the Baſha taking an apprehenſion of feare, cauſed his people to retire, fearing to loſe his Cannon. Neuertheleſſe he left one cracked and broken peece there with 40. barrels of powder, and 40. ſackes of meale. There alſo remained a great number of Tents and baggage. This was drawne into the towne. The breaches were ſo large, that ſcarcely a harquebuze would ſhoote from one ſide to another. At the raiſing of this ſiege the Turkes incamped by Alberegalis, and in the meane time the ſuccours  entered into the towne. To repayre the breaches thereof, and to aduiſe vpon the conſequence, they ſent Ingenours thither to iudge of it, if it might be repayred, or whither it would be more expedient to forſake it, and to conclude to throw it all downe to the ground.
            Theſe accidents daily arriuing in Hungarie, cauſed the Emperour in the greateſt diligence he could to haſten all the preparations of warre, according to which, he had there for that purpoſe 5. Regiments of Launſquenets. The firſt was vnder the conduct of Remer: the ſecond was led by Balderdun: Claus of Hogaſt commaunded the third: the fourth was led by Count George of Helfenſtain: and the fifth marched vnder Polbel. He alſo had there 20000. Reiſters, and 4000. Hungars. 400. Harquebuziers on horſeback were come  
               Succours come to the Emperour from forraine Princes. from Sauoy to ſerue the Emperour in this warre: as alſo were thither come a great number of Lords and Knights from many places of Chriſtendome at their owne charges, and for the loue they bore to Chriſtian religion. His Maieſtie receiued them very curteouſly, and commaunded all his Barons and other Lords of his armie to vſe the like in their places, conſidering how all theſe (for the onely affection to doe him ſeruice) were come to ſeeke ſo farre countries, without any reſpect had to the charge and trauaile.
            Many Princes and Common-wealths of Italie ſent him ſuccours. The Succours of Italie. Duke of Mantua, Gennes, and Luca aſſiſted him with money. The Duke of Florence ſent him 3000. footmen payd. The Duke of Ferrara (beſides that he left vnto him the dowrie and mariage of his wife the Dutcheſſe his Maieſties ſiſter, which was 150000. Florins) went himſelfe to ſerue him with a choiſe companie of 400. Gentlemen, 300. Harquebuziers on horſebacke, 100. Murrions, and 100. armed men: and there was not any one of theſe Gentlemen who brought not with him three or foure good ſouldiours. Alexander Bailon with foure Captaines came to his Maieſtie. After him arriued Iohn Alphonſe Caſtalde with his troupes. A little before alſo were preſented to his Maieſtie to doe him ſeruice, and to winne renowne amongſt ſo many nations, certaine Lords and Engliſh Gentlemen: amongſt whom was Engliſhmen Maſter Smith, Richard Greinuile, Henry Champernon, Philip Budſhall, Thomas 
                
               Cotton, and William George a Captaine of ſingular proweſſe. From all parts men might ſee this armie to bee increaſed, by the arriuall of ſo many Lords and Gentlemen. Albert Lasky a Polonian, by reaſon of many Caſtles which Polonians. he poſſeſſed in Hungarie, meant not to be wanting to ſo fit an occaſion. He

brought with him twelue Coaches, and 3000. Pollacques, all apparelled a la 
                
               Hungreſque, that he might not thereby preiudice the King of Poland, who was in league with the Turk (if they were knowne in the habit of their owne countrie). The Duke of Wolfang Palatin of Nuberg, and Richard his kinſman Germanes. came thither with 600. horſe. The ſecond ſonne of the Duke of Bauier brought thither with him 400. Proſper Colonne, Ange Caeſis, and certaine other Lords of Italie incontinently followed thoſe who were come thither on the behalfe of the Duke of sauoy, conducted by the Duke of Camerin, as Sauonians. alſo did Count Nicholas Gambara, hauing in his traine twelue Gentlemen. On the behalfe of the kingdome of France was Henry of Loraine Duke of Guize, Count de Briſſac, the Lord of Lanſac, the Lord Strozzy, and many other  
               Frenchmen. French gentlemen all well armed, who were departed from France and were come to Malta in fauour of the Religion, for that from many places it was aſſured that the Turkiſh armie would returne thither. But theſe bruites being found falſe, theſe Lords after they had ſeene Italie tooke their way towards Hungarie, that they might bee in this warre, and ſalute his Maieſtie, who made them great demonſtration of the pleaſure which he receiued by their comming.
            
               Maximilian had prepared a nauall armie vpon Danubius of 12. Gallies, and 30. Nazadies, with other great boates, ſo well accommodated, that the A nauall armie vpon Danubius. ſouldiours who were within, might well warrant themſelues from their enemies arrowes. In theſe veſſels there was many peeces of great Artillerie,  with neceſſarie powder and bullets, and 3000. men, the moſt part Italians. Blach Allemand a Kight of Malta a valiant man, and greatly experienced in ſea affayres, commaunded this armie. The land armie marched along Danubius towards Iauerin, in which place the bodie of the whole armie ſhould ſtay to diuert the Turke from Tranſiluania, and to put him in doubt to loſe Strigonium and Buda.
            The Emperour at the ſame time commaunded all the Nobilitie of Auſtria to mount on horſebacke, and to march to the warre at their owne expences, preparing himſelfe in the meane time to be in perſon in his Campe,  ſince that Solyman (although he was old) was in his. As this great concourſe of men and of all munitions made, the Turkes who were in the field towards Alberegalis and Sighet, (where they expected the Beglerbey of Armenia, who ſhould come to beſiege this place, as afterwards he did) ouerran all the countrie. Againſt theſe went forth Count Salm, who commaunded Iauerin, and with as many men as he was able to bring into the field, he went directly to Pallota: and hauing put thereinto victuals, and refreſhed the garriſon, he marched with a good troupe of Caualarie towards Veſprimia, which Veſprimia taken by Count Salm from the Turkes. is a great towne, and not very ſtrong, two miles from Pallota, making great ſpoyle all about, not ſtaying any whit at all vpon any bootie, vntill his Infantrie  approached. The Turkes who were within, minding to prepare and defend themſelues, and for this effect readily giuing order to many things, as they diſplaced two Cannons to place them elſewhere in a more commodious place, a pane of the wall fell to the ground. The Count being aduertiſed thereof, taking this for ſome good ſigne, and as if God ſhould open the

paſſage to him, diligently prepared his people. Theſe arriued about night, and the batterie was deferred vntill the day following. In the meane time  the Turkes laboured to repayre the happened ruine: and preſently when day light appeared, the Count hotly aſſailed the towne on all parts, putting fire to the ports, and ladders againſt the walls, by meanes whereof (in repulſing the enemie) they threw fire vpon the couerings of houſes, which for the moſt part are but of wood, according to the common manner of the countrie: and ſome entring by the breach, and others boldly leaping from off the ladders, forced the enemies, and they cut the greateſt part of them in peeces; the principall amongſt them retiring into the Caſtle: but for all that they were no more warranted then the others were. For minding to parley, they  were ſuddenly forced and ſlaine. At this ſurpriſe was taken aliue the Gouernour of Alberegalis, who was ſent to the Caſtle of Poſon. There was alſo taken about this towne fiue Turkiſh Spies. This being done, the Count knowing that within Pallota were entered for the garriſon thereof certaine Germane companies, left in this to command therein George Tury, who had ſo well defended the other, giuing him a ſufficient companie of men to keep it: and afterwards he retired to Iauerin, while the Baſha of Buda departed from Alberegalis, and retired himſelfe to Buda to aduiſe of his affayres. On the other ſide, the ſouldiours who were in garriſon within Leuante (ſituated at the foote of the mountaines) going into the field to aſſaile the Turks, were  by them badly entreated, and there were many amongſt them who remained priſoners there, and amongſt others was Bartholmew Horuatte, a man of great valour.
            Fiue miles from Iauerin, and two from Comar is the Fortreſſe of Tata. From thence the Emperiall ſouldiours, which were in the neighbouring places, daily receiued great loſſes, this place being wel munitioned and kept. Count Salm deſiring to raſe this Fort, departed with his people from Iauerin early in the morning the 21. of Iuly, and arriued about euening before Tata, with a reſolution not to depart from this enterpriſe without conqueſt Tata taken by Count Salm from the Turkes. thereof. Being there arriued, he ſent for to come before him (after faith  pledged) a Turke whom he knew. He (by the permiſſion of his Captaine) came to him, and the Count deſirous to perſwade him that all his companions ſhould doe well to yeeld themſelues; promiſing ſafetie of life to all of them: this Turke anſwered, that they had rather a good deſire valiantly to defend themſelues, being otherwiſe aſſured that the Baſha of Buda would not faile to come and ſuccour them if neede were: that neuertheleſſe he thanked him of this friendly offer which he made him, whereof he would aduertiſe his companions, and promiſed him to returne within one houre, if they were determined to yeeld, deſiring him in the meane time not to vndertake any thing, aſſuring him that by thoſe of the towne he ſhould not receiue any damage. With this mutuall promiſe the Turke being returned into  the towne, and the houre being paſſed, the Count ſeeing not any perſon to come to him from thoſe of the towne, cauſed his Artillerie to be planted to begin his batterie, againſt which the Turks hauing 14. peeces of Cannon, ceaſed not to ſhoote one againſt another vntill night: and during this, the

Count cauſed to be remoued ſixe peeces into a commodious place to make  his breach, and betimes in the morning he cauſed them ſo furiouſly to play, that incontinently a gap was laid open in the wall. But the Turks with exceeding diligence in ſuch ſort repayred the damage, that they gaue no commoditie to our people to come to the aſſault. Neuertheleſſe the Count appointed Colonell Villardun with his companies to goe to the breach, commaunding all the reſt of the armie to raunge themſelues in battaile. A 1000. ſouldiours ſhould giue an aſſault with ladders in paſſing the water euen vnto the girdle, and 1000 others were appointed to goe to the breach, whileſt that altogether they boldly aſſayling it, the Count with other 2000. aſſayled the Caſtle gate. The Turkes going to the defences, as well at the breach, as againſt  thoſe who were in the ditch, valiantly for a time defended themſelues againſt them. But the port was battered downe, and the Count entering in by it, the Turkes performing the dutie that hardie and bold ſouldiours could doe in ſuch neceſſitie, were all by him cut in peeces, except 50. who being retired into a Tower, yeelded themſelues vnder certaine conditions. Amongſt theſe was the Captaine of Tata, and he who commaunded laſt at Veſprimia, and a kinſman of the Baſha of Buda, all three greatly eſteemed. Theſe were ſent to Vienna. This ſurpriſe and that of Veſprimia greatly reioyced the Emperour.
            The Count continuing in ſo fortunate ſucceſſe, cauſed his people (without  ſtaying in any place) to march to the Caſtle of Gheſtez, from whence Gheſtez and Vithain taken from the Turkes. the Turkes perceiuing the Vauntgard, they preſently fled, abandoning with the place all their munition and Artillerie. For the like feare, thoſe who were within the Caſtles of Vithain, Iſcholchin, and other villages, took their flight, and retired to Strigonium, after they had ſet fire on their munition, for feare the enemie ſhould preuaile thereby. The taking of theſe Caſtles, for that they were ſituated vpon the way which goeth from Comar to Strigonia, brought great profit to Maximilians affayres, becauſe they might eaſily aduance themſelues euen to this towne, without leauing behinde any place which was in the enemies hands: and ſpecially becauſe that in theſe high ſituated places ordinarily retired a good number of Martelots, who are peaſant  
               Martelots wicked peaſants. theeues, and without faith, who by their robberies ruinated all that countrie: theſe people being of ſo ſtrong force, that in reſpect of their courage they care not for any paine, trauaile, or daunger.
            The Emperour (who yet was not gone into the field ſo ſoone as he determined) as well by reaſon of the preparations to which he daily gaue order, as for that the appointed troupes through all the Emperiall States were not yet arriued, and alſo for that he was afterward aſcertained that the Turk was not paſſed Belgrade, and that there he ſhould ſoiourne, attending the reſt of his armie, conſidering that the goodlieſt ordinances that might bee are fruſtrate,  and that men trauaile in vaine to defend their townes, except God preſerued them; for this conſideration he ordained that they ſhould pray to God without any intermiſſion, commaunding vnder great penalties, that at certaine nominated houres at the ſound of a bell, euery one in Vienna ſhould kneele downe, and pray to God for the good and preſeruation of

the publike weale, in ſuch ſort that all the Lords of what degree or qualitie they were of, ſhould not faile to deſcend from their horſes at the ſound of  the ſaid Bell if they were then in the towne. Beſides he cauſed to be prohibited all manner of ſports and pleaſant paſtimes; exhorting euery one to indeauour by good workes to appeaſe the wrath of God.
            In the meane time the Emperials deſiering to execute the enterpriſe of Strigonia, and ſetting this matter before the Councell to be conſidered of, they ſent to Maximilian to know of him his aduiſe. The anſwer and reſolution was, that he ſhould not prepare himſelfe with ſo ſmall an armie to a towne of ſo great importance, and which was no leſſe ſtrong and alſo well furniſhed then Buda. On the contrarie, the Emperour ſent to Count Salm,  that becauſe Tata was a place farre diſtant from Danubius, and not eaſily to be victualed, or to conduct victuals thither, he ſhould directly retire himſelfe from thence, right ouer againſt Comer along the riuer, and there to expect him, hoping within a while to come and ioyne with him.
            The Turkes thinking on nothing elſe ranne ouer all the Countrie, and at Carpon (where was Captaine Bruſchitty) they tooke and led away 40. peiſants, who were reaping corne, and were taken by the Caſtle gate as they were drinking and taking their repaſt. The Captaine moued to ſee ſo bolde an act done before his eyes, preſently ſallied forth, and tooke three of thoſe Turkes, and had ſtayed the reſt if the ſouldiours would haue followed him.  But the loſſe which they receiued by the Counte of Serin without compariſon was farre otherwiſe. He hauing had aduertiſement by his ſpie, that Halla Sangiach, and the Gouernour of the 5. Churches were come neere vnto Sighet with their troupes, yet he not knowing their determination, and that there they were incamped, he preſently went into the fielde to incounter them: and finding them drowſie he aſſailed them on the ſuddaine, and the Turkes not being able ſo inſtantly to range themſelues in battaile, the greateſt part of them were taken priſoners, and the other throwen into the water, and of thoſe who were ſlaine, were caried to Sighet 94. heads, with 16000. Ducats, many faire harneſſes, many Camels, Mules, ſiluer veſſell, tents, and other ſpoyle. The Sangiach there valiantly defending himſelfe  loſt one of his hands, and was conſtrained to yeeld himſelfe.
            In the end the Emperour hauing receiued the ſuccours which he expected, Ferdinand Lieutenant General in the armie of the Emperour Maximilian his brother. publiſhed Ferdinand (Arch Duke of Auſtria) his brother his Lieutenant generall in this Armie, to whom was Lieutenant Count of Schuartzemburge: and committed the charge of the Artillerie to Paul of Zara; and the 12. of Auguſt his Maieſtie departed from Vienna with the Emperiall Enſigne, which was commaunded by the Lord of Arach, hauing vnder him for his Lieutenant the Marſhall of Vnghemad, and the Guidon was caried by the Duke of Pomerania. His Maieſtie marched towards Attemberg diſtant two miles from Iauerin while al the horſe of Bohemia came  to Poſſon, which conſiſted of 7. Cornets, and beſides there was 1000. horſe Bohemians, Morauians, and Sleſians in the Emperours ayde. marching at their owne charges vnder the commaund of Teufel, and 1200. other conducted by Count Gonther of Schuartzemburg. The Morauians, Sleſians, and Luſatians made beſides the reſt a good ſhew of horſe. Vratiſlauia
               
ſent 300. horſe. All theſe troupes with others who followed Maximilian, 
                made to the number of 10000. horſe, beſides thoſe who alreadie were at Iauerin, and at Comar. All the Armie being aſſembled at Altemburg, the Emperour marched to Iauarin, there being at the ſame time arriued at Comar the Nauale Armie which came a long Danubius. Preſently there paſſed many skirmiſhes, in which for the moſt part the Emperials had the better. The more to ſtrengthen the Armie, his Maieſtie cauſed the other troupes to come which were at Comar, hoping to enterpriſe vpon Strigonium, and by the taking of this towne, to diuert the ſiege (which was feared ſhould be made by the enemie) before Sighet and Iula. For to giue battaile, (although neceſſitie ſeemed ſo to require) it was not requiſit, leaſt they might hazard  the whole eſtate of the Empire in one battaile, which is alwaies vncertaine and doubtfull: and on the other ſide, the Emperour had not ſuch forces that he could aſſure himſelfe of victorie. The enterpriſe neuertheleſſe of Strigonium was yet then deferred for ſome good reſpects.
            Vpon this, newes came that Solyman was paſſed the riuer of Tiſſa, and that Solyman arriued in Hunagrie. of Danubius, and that alreadie he was on this ſide Sighet, hauing with great diligence, cauſed to be made in this towne a bridge vpon Drauus for the paſſage of his Armie: for performing whereof, he ſent before 25000. men. This bridge was erected in 16. daies, although it was in length 5500. fathum, and 14. broade: and for the building whereof, they vſed an infinit companie of boates, bound with Iron chaynes in place of piles, which they could not  vſe by reaſon of the deepenes of the riuer. Certaine dayes before, Solyman 
               Solymans ſiege before Sighet. had giuen the charge of the ſiege of Sighet to the Baſha of Boſſina, and to him of Armenia: but hauing vnderſtood the loſſe of Tata, and of Veſprimia, he ſent them to the ſuccours of the Baſha of Buda, and gaue the conduct of this ſiege to the Beglerbey of Armenia. He readily marched thither, and incamped himſelfe within a mile of the Fortreſſe. Solyman within a while after came himſelfe. This towne is ſituated in Hungarie vpon the confines of Croatia, in the middeſt of waters and mariſhes, which enuiron it on three ſides for the ſpace of more then a mile, and on the ſide of the firme land it  hath but one entrance, which is defended with two great Bulwarkes made of earth and wood, well combined and bound together. It is compoſed of two townes made in frame of a Fortreſſe, with a Caſtle cloſed in with foure Courtaines in a ſquare forme. Betweene the one and other there are good deepe ditches full of running water. In this place commaunded for the Emperour Nicholas Eſdrin Count of Serin, of whom we haue often before Nicholas Eſdrin Count of Se-rin commaunded at Sighet. ſpoken. He was Nephew to the Lord Torguat by reaſon of his ſiſter, and there was giuen vnto him the office of Banambt in the kingdomes of Croatia, Dalmatia, and Sclauonia, which is as much as Bailife or Seneſhall: and beſides he was Mundſchencken of Hungarie, that is to ſay, great Butler:  and Captaine generall for the Emperour about Danubius. He was preſent at the ſiege of Vienna, which heretofore we haue deſcribed in the former bookes: and for his valour which in this ſiege was knowen and obſerued by euery one, he was recompenced with a faire horſe and a chaine of golde. He was alſo ſufficiently made knowen at the ſiege of Peſthe and Buda. This

Captaine (a Hungar by birth) had in this place 1200. ſouldiours to defend it. The Turke (greatly to annoy Maximilian, beſides the beſieging of this  place) ſent 35000. men, as well Tartars as Turkes, to beſiege Iula. But the waters hindered them to doe it: and at their retraict thoſe within ſallied forth, and charged them behinde ſo hotly, that many of the enemies remained there.
            Certaine daies after, the Turks being returned thither, they beſieged this place very ſtraightly, battering the towne with great peeces: but they cooling their fury, and ſeeming careleſſe, thoſe within ſeeing their countenance, in the night ſallied forth: and thus ſurpriſing the enemie, killed many of them, and cauſed the other to retire, in ſuch ſort, that they remained maſters  of their Artillerie, which they choked and rammed vp, the enemie not being able to carrie it away. The Tartars (who at that time might eaſily haue aſſailed Schuendy, who then had not many people with him, and who for that occaſion daily importuned the Emperour to haue freſh ſuccours) hauing taken ſome countrie men, and knowing of them by ſuppoſed ſpeeches that Schuendy had with him 20000. men: vpon theſe words they were ſo daunted, that ſuddenly they raiſed the ſiege: and ſpoyling the countrie all about, they fiered fiue villages, vſing a marueilous crueltie euery where, without reſpecting any ſexe or condition, but following their barbarous cuſtome they put all to fire and ſword. 
            
            In the meane time the Turkes (after the batteries and breaches made at Sighet, by meanes of high Forts which Mahomet Baſha (commaunding all the armie) had cauſed to be raiſed) had giuen eight furious aſſaults: and the 29. of Auguſt they gaue thereto a generall aſſault, which continued 24. houres. But the beſieged defended themſelues ſo couragiouſly, that after they had killed a great number of the enemies, and taken the Captaine of the Ianiſaries, they alwaies valiantly repulſed them. The ſtinke of the dead bodies was ſo great, that Solyman was forced to recoyle foure miles off. Serin ſeeing he had loſt in theſe aſſaults many of his people, cauſed the towne to bee fiered, and retired himſelfe to two other Forts. This retraict gaue occaſion  to the Turkes to giue yet another aſſault vpon the day of the beheading of S. Iohn, Solyman truſting in this day, which he eſteemed very fortunate for him in all his battailes, hauing on yt day obtained this notable and memorable victorie which he had againſt Lewis King of Hungarie, and hauing on the ſame day wonne the townes of Rhodes and Buda, and defeated in battaile the armie of the King of Perſia. This fortune neuertheleſſe failed the Turkes at this time, and they were yet valiantly repulſed. The day following, which was the 30. of that moneth, they yet againe returned to the aſſault with greater furie, and with ſuch courage, that their Enſignes were ſeene vpon the Rampiars: but neuertheleſſe they were repulſed euen with great ſlaughter of them. Solyman conſidering the tediouſnes of this ſiege,  and the valiantnes of Serin, cauſed to bee offered to this Captaine a very good offer, if he would yeeld to him. But theſe offers could nothing moue the faith which the Count had ſworne to Maximilian. Notwithſtanding, if the Emperour had had good Spies who would haue informed him of the

trueth, or if at leaſt he had credited the reports which was made him, it is  without all doubt that with proſperous ſucceſſe he ſhould haue finiſhed this warre: for that then was taken a Turke of good qualitie, who after he had requeſted libertie, ſwore and affirmed vpon his head that Solyman was dead: the which was confirmed by other demonſtrations. The Emperour notwithſtanding would not beleeue any thing hereof, iudging that if ſuch a thing were happened, it could not be poſſible that the Turkiſh armie ſhould bee in ſuch quiet, nor ſo well gouerned. But the prudence and marueilous induſtrie of Mehemet Baſha (a moſt wiſe Lord) knew ſo well to manage this matter, that not onely he concealed the death of his Lord: but yet further, aſſured the Empire vnto him to whom it belonged: and (which is of  no leſſe conſequence) contained ſo great an armie in militarie obedience, repreſſed the furie and ſedition of the Ianiſaries, preſerued the treaſure, and obtained a notable victorie.
            
               Solyman was come into Hungarie with a puiſſant armie of 150000. men, which he diuided into many parts, whereof one was towards Iula in the confines of Hungarie adioynant to Tranſiluania, and another towards Sighet vpon the marches of Croatia. In this was his greateſt force, and there was himſelfe in perſon, to the end that his preſence ſhould the more encourage the ſouldiours to the taking of this towne. But being now of the age of 66. yeeres, and being crazed, in reſpect of the labours of ſo long a voyage, and perhaps hauing his courage abated to ſee his people in ſo many aſſaults The death of Solyman. 
                repulſed, with ſo great a butcherie of them: and it may bee this accuſtomed valour of minde being no longer in him, with which he before had happely brought to end ſo many goodly enterpriſes, the humours of his bodie being corrupted, a bloody flux troubled him, which within few daies took him out of this world. And thus the prognoſtication (which in the moneth of May before going, had been made touching the anuall reuolution of this Prince, by thoſe that had been curious to know that which heauen did promiſe touching this warre) fell out to be true. This prognoſtication contained The prognoſtication of the death of Solyman. that the Emperour of Turkes ſhould dye there, if peraduenture he was not ouerthrowne and defeated by the Chriſtians, notwithſtanding the great  leauie of people which he made againſt them.
            
               Mehemet Baſha ſeeing his Prince dead, and Sighet yet vntouched as it The marueilous prudencie of Mehemet Baſha. were, and in poſſeſſion of the Chriſtians, preſently thought that it was expedient to keepe this death ſecret, as well for the continuance of this ſiege and taking of the place, as for the preſeruation of the armie and treaſure; as alſo to inueſt the new Sultan Selim in the poſſeſſion of the Empire, to whom of right it belonged. Vpon this reſolution he readily diſpatched a meſſenger to the Baſha of Conſtantinople, to aduertiſe him of the fortune which was happened, and he ſent him word of that which was neceſſarie for him to  doe. Then with a ſingular ſubteltie, knowing that the ſouldious would bee offended if they ſaw not their Lord, he cauſed the bodie to be clothed with his accuſtomed habits, and ſetting him in a high place within his Pauilion, cauſed him a farre off to bee ſhewed to all, without that any of them could know that he was dead. This being thus well inuented, Mehemet went forth

of the Pauilion, and taking occaſion thereupon began to encourage the Ianiſaries, exhorting them to performe their laſt endeuour to the aſſault of Sighet.  But while he was ſpeaking, and calling to minde that his Lord was dead, he could not for the griefe which he felt in his minde refraine from weeping. And as this paſſion was pricking, his wiſedome to couer it was alſo very readie, in ſuch ſort, that preſently remembring that his teares gaue to the ſouldiours ſome apprehenſion and aſſurance of the death of their prince, vpon ſome little bruite which alreadie was ſpread in the Camp, vſing a braue ſtratagem in wiſely diſſembling his inward griefe, added to his ſpeeches, that he wept not for the death of his Lord, as it ſeemed they iudged, who (thanks be to God) was liuing and out of all daunger. But that he wept for the miſerable and pitious condition of all the armie, for that their Prince had made  an inuiolable oth, laying hand on his breaſt and head, that if within few daies Sighet were not taken, he would put them all to death without remiſſion, with a cruell and ſtrange kinde of death. Mehemet by theſe ſpeeches and many others, animating euery one, a ſingular deſire of fight, and alſo preſently to returne to the aſſault, poſſeſſed all the ſouldiours, and aboue all, the Ianiſaries being all obſtinate to performe therein their laſt endeuours, or elſe to end their liues there. Vpon this reſolution, after he had giuen order to that which appertained to ſuch an aſſault, all the ſouldiours running with great furie to the breach and skaladoe the 6. of September, they were neuertheleſſe repulſed with great loſſe both of the one part and other. But the enemies  hauing meanes to refreſh them, and continuing their blowes, came againe for the laſt time the day following to the breach, with a marueilous furie and a greater force then they had yet euer made, and the one and other fighting betweene hope to ouercome and feare to dye, there was ſeene a terrible conſlict now on this ſide, then on the other. Count Serin performing then the dutie of an aduiſed and moſt valiant Captaine, encouraging his people, ranne here and there, not being wanting either to himſelfe or to his ſouldiours, appeared greater then himſelfe. He ſeeing that the Artillerie of the enemie had ſet fire in the Fortreſſe, and being aſtoniſhed thereat, cauſed  the port to bee opened, and hauing planted a Cannon (charged with many little bullets) at the enterance of it, and giuing fire thereto, more then 100. Turkes were layd on the ground by that ſhot, and preſently the Count aduanced himſelfe vpon the bridge with his Courtlaſſe and Target, being followed of his people, who of 1200. were reduced onely to 500. and they all thronging in amongſt the enemies fought valiantly. Serin would neuer yeeld himſelfe, although the Turks deſired him to doe it, willing to haue him aliue into their hands: but alwaies fighting couragiouſly in the middeſt of the enemies, increaſed in himſelfe an incredible valour: and thus managing his hands with extreame courage, was thruſt into the breaſt with a pike. But he fearing to abate the courage of his people, concealed this wound as  much as he could, vntill in the end he was greatly wounded in the head with The death of Count Serin. a blow which killed him. And although that the ſouldiours deſiſted not, yet could they not make ſuch reſiſtance as they did before: ſo auaileable in ſouldiours hearts is the Captaines preſence: from whence it happened that Sighet

was preſently taken, and all thoſe who were taken, within a few daies after  
               Sighet taken by the Turks. were all cruelly maſſacred by the Turkes. The head being cut from the bodie of this valiant Count, it was ſent by the Baſha of Buda to Count Ecchia of Salm, wrapped in a peece of blacke veluet, with letters, by which he declared vnto him, that hauing vnderſtood that this braue warrier who had ſo faithfully maintained the part of his Emperour, was his kinſman &amp; friend, he was willing to ſend him his head, to the end it ſhould bee a beginning of an obligation of mutuall friendſhip betweene them, ſending him word that he had cauſed his bodie to be honourably buried. Some beleeued that the Baſha did this more to poſſeſſe him with griefe and ſome aſtoniſhment, then for any office of humanitie or curteſie that was naturally in him. This head  was carried by a peaſant to Comar, and from thence to Iauerin to the Emperours Campe: to whoſe Maieſtie then came one of the ſonnes of Serin, and proſtrated himſelfe at his feete, to deſire him that with his good fauour he might hold his fathers place, &amp; of all his familie. The Emperour raiſed him with his hands, and promiſed to be to him a good Tutor, and as a father to all his houſe. This ſonne after he had taken leaue of ye Emperor, being followed with a good number of gentlemen, went to the Fortreſſe of Iskachaturn, and cauſing his fathers head to bee conducted thither, made it honourably to be buried with great pompe. The towne of Sighet came in this ſort into the enemies hands, it being opened on all ſides by the violence of the Artillerie.  The Emperour loſt there to the number of 100. peeces of Cannon, which Serin ſeeing that he had no more hope, cauſed them to bee charged euen to the mouth, and put fire thereto, ſo that they were all cleft and broken. If this Count had had ſufficient of ſouldiours, he had neuer ſeene it reduced to this point, hauing neither want of armes nor victuals. Of 1200. ſouldiours which he had at the beginning of the ſiege, there remained no more the 110. when he was wounded to death. By this loſſe the port was opened to the Turkes to moleſt the reſt of Hungarie. For from this place they might runne without any impeachment vnto Sopron, called Odembourg, and euen to the walles of Poſon. Amongſt the moſt of marke who dyed in Sopron called Odemburg. 
                this ſiege of the Turkes part, was noted Alipartu Baſha, who for Sea affayres was held to bee very expert, and for one of the valianteſt of all the Turkiſh Captaines.
            After the taking of this place, the Turkes diſperſed themſelues by incurſions through all the countrie, and euen in ſight of the Emperour, who was greatly diſcontented for this loſſe, and the death of Serin. By theſe excurſions the countrie was greatly endamaged, Fortune being altogether ſo fauourable to the enemy, that ſhe not being content to haue brought him ſuch happie ſucceſſe, added yet thereto the winning of the towne and Fortreſſe of Iula, which in the ſame weeke was reduced vnder the Turks commaund,  although this place was iudged inexpugnable. Captaine Ladiſlas Cheretsken commaunded there. He ſeeing himſelfe beſieged by a long and dangerous Ladiſlas Cheretsken Gouernour of Iula. ſiege, and moued by diſtruſt from being able to ſuſtaine it any longer, or rather (as it was ſaid) for the great promiſes which Portau Baſha made him, he rendered it to him vpon ſuch compoſition, that he might retire himſelfe

with his armes and baggage ſaued, with hoſtages for aſſurance of the capitulation,  who ſhould accompanie him and his people vnto ſome place of ſecuritie, Giuſa taken by the Turks. and that the Turkiſh Artillerie ſhould be diſplaced and turned into ſome place, where it could not endamage them. Vpon ſuch conditions the Captaine being come forth, he was lead before the Baſha, and in the meane time that the others marched, being not yet 1000. paces off, two great companies of Turkes aſſailed them. They ſeeing themſelues thus deceiued, ranged themſelues altogether within their waggons, and for a while valiantly defended themſelues, and ſpecially the Germanes who with their harquebuze ſhot killed many of the enemies. But in the end being ſurmounted with a great number, they were conſtrained to yeeld to the enemie who almoſt cut them all to peeces, except ſome who ſaued themſelues, amongſt  which was Bernard Rotenau a Germane Captaine, who afterward being preſented before the Emperiall Maieſtie, accuſed Cheretsken of treaſon, he hauing made an accorde without the knowledge of his companions. Neuertheleſſe by the reporte of an Hungarian ſouldiour, who afterwards came to the Campe, they knew that the Captaine had conferred of this ſurrender with the Germanes, and that thoſe for certaine would not yeeld at the firſt: but that afterwards ouercome by the promiſes and great perſwaſions of the Turkes, they conſented thereto.
            Neere to Alberegalis there was 20000. Turkes incamped and fortified with good trenches, who made many attempts towards the Emperiall  Campe. The Emperour willing to ſuppreſſe this inſolencie, choſe out certaine of his armie, and with a few of his ſouldiours ſent them to diſcouer. Afterward hauing firſt ſent to the Turkes certaine ſpies to know how the enemie behaued themſelues there, they marching before, and meeting with thoſe who were of the guard, and ſeeing them well armed returned to make recital of that which they had ſeene, &amp; might diſcerne by the enemies countenance. The Emperials notwithſtanding all other difficultie, being gone forth, marched towards them, and going with good ſpeede they ſurpriſed them, and aſſayling them on the ſuddaine put them to flight, killing ſome of  them who were gone a forraging. This newes being carried to the Emperours Campe, the Hungars, Burgunnians, and Auſtrians, couragiouſly put themſelues into the field, and purſuing the Turks who fled, they killed ſome and tooke others. George Tury hauing knowne amongſt them the Sangiach of Alberegalis, a great Councellor of the Turkes, (whom he might verie well know, becauſe that while he was at Pallota he had been his neighbour, and had perſued him oftentimes to take him) he boldly thruſt himſelfe into the middeſt of them all, &amp; followed him ſo neere, that although his horſe was ſlaine vnder him, yet being readily remounted vpon another, he tooke him a liue and brought him priſoner to the Emperour, at whoſe hand for  ſo valerous an act he was knighted, and the Sangiach was conducted to Vienna, where he remained a long time priſoner.
            At another time 1500. horſe being, gone forth of the Campe to encounter certaine Turkes, they made forward as farre as Iſcocaky belonging to the enemies, two miles from Alberegalis. But they did not any exployt,

there paſſing nothing betweene the two Camps but light skirmiſhes, in  which George Tury more then once gaue chaſe to the enemies, and brought from them good ſpoyle. At the ſame time, the Arch Duke Charles being at Bubolca, defeated a Baſha with 4000. horſe by the riuer of Sleuua, and without doubt he had taken him, if the armie that was at Sighet had not been ſo nigh, he retyring himſelfe to the Caſtle of Carotua, a very ſtrong place which is ſituated in an Iland which Drauus and Murus maketh.
            All theſe excurſions greatly increaſed from the time of the taking of Sighet, and the Turkes pilled, burned, and waſted all euen neere vnto Sabar, diſtant two miles from the Emperiall Campe. By theſe excurſions many Captaines experienced in the manner of the Turkiſh warre, beleeued that  
               Solyman would retire to Conſtantinople, and that ſomuch the more, becauſe they vnderſtoode that in his armie was a great dearth of victuals, and that there was ſome taken from Buda and Alberegalis to ſend thither. Beſides they heard that Solyman was dead, and that the Baſha giuing this laſt ruine to the Countrie, would depart with his accompliſhed victorie. Neuertheleſſe it ſeemed that is would be a ſtrange thing, if there happened not ſome ſedition in this armie, knowing that in like caſes the Turkes are verie eaſily moued to mutine. But Mahomet entertained, and that with great care, theſe courſes to ſtay his owne armie and that of the enemies, he daylie expecting the comming of Selim their new Emperour, and Solymans ſonne, to whom he had ſent, that in the greateſt ſpeede he could, he ſhould depart from Conſtantinople.  When Selim receiued the newes of his fathers death, he was in Selim the ſonne and ſucceſſour of Solyman. the plaine of Saraiſſa, three dayes iourney from Conſtantinople, in a place called Chiefredy, which belonged to Sinan Baſha. He hauing in this place receiued the letters of Mahomet, ſubſcribed with the Captaines Aga and with the principall Phiſitians hands, departed the 17. of September to goe to Conſtantinople with all the people which for that time he could haue with him, and being arriued at Scutari, Boſtangy Baſha chiefe Gardner, who had the keeping of the Kings Pallace, went before with a Brigandine ordained for the perſon of the Grand Seigniour, it being verie well and Ceremonies at the receiuing of the Grand Seigniour into Conſtantinople. richly trimmed, and accompained with many goodly young men ſumptuouſly  apparelled. Selim had firſt ſent many Ianiſaries to Scander Baſha, Gouernour and Lieutenant of Solyman in Conſtantinople, to aduertiſe him to prepare all things neceſſarie for his entrance. And being aborde this Brigandine, he arriued at Conſtantinople, and deſcending into the Serrail, Boſtangy tooke him by the hand, and conducted him into the vſuall chamber aunciently deputed for all the Kings, and there he being ſeated in a chayre dedicated to the Ottoman Emperours, made proclamation through the towne, with the ſame words which they ordinarely vſe in the election of new Emperours: ſending within a while after in great diligence the ſame proclamation  through all his Empire, to the end that the death of his father ſhould no ſooner be diſcouered, then his eſtabliſhment in the Empire. Afterward going out of his Pallace, he ſhewed himſelfe in the towne to all the people, going to the ſepulcher of Iob, which is a place adioyning to the wals, where the Kings and Grand Seigniours are accuſtomed to make their ſacrifices,

offering ſheepe and other beaſtes, which afterward are diſtributed to the  poore in remuneration of the graces receiued of God. And hauing offered there a great ſumme of monie, and ſaid his prayers, he returneth in great pompe and pleaſure to his Palace: from whence he departed the 26. of September to goe to his Campe, making great iournies, and without ſtaying in any place at laſt he arriued at Belgarde hauing made this voyage in great ſpeed, and ſo ſecretly that the people marueiling to ſee him, knew not the occaſion of his comming but onely after his departure: which cauſed that not any tumult happened, whereof euery one greatly marueiled, knowing afterwards how all was paſſed. And being departed from Belgrade, and alreadie two dayes iourney on his way, by the letters of Mehement he retourned  backe, for that this Baſha ſent him word that he ſhould come no further, for that the Armie was not any whit moleſted: and in auoyding the tediouſnes of ſo long a iourney, Mehemet deſyred him to attend at Belgrade.
            Thus his Maieſtie ſoiourned in that place, attending the Armie which was conducted by a deade bodie, carried in a cloſe couered Coach, euery one beleeuing that he was liuing: becauſe that he being in this his olde age for certaine yeares together ſubiect to the goute, he was accuſtomed to be carried into the fields in this ſorte.
            Vpon the daie that this bodie or corps ſhould enter into Belgrade, Selim 
               Ceremonie for the funerall mourning of the Turkiſh Emperours. put vpon his head a verie little Turbant, and being decently apparaled  with a blacke cloth cloake mounted on horſebacke, hee went before the bodie of his father euen to the Porte: this bodie being accompayned with diſplayed Enſignes, trumpets, and other ſuch ſignes of a tryumphe. The couer of the Coach being lifted vp, Selim diſmounted, and began to mourne ouer the bodie. All the Baſhaes, the Cadiliſchiers (who Cadiliſchiers. are the principall perſons for Iuſtice) with all the chiefe of the Campe, after lighting from their horſes, tooke alſo little Turbants, and in token of ſadnes all the Enſignes through the whole Campe were reuerſed the point downeward: and there was a wounderfull ſilence made  for the ſpace of a quarter of an hower. After this ceremonie, a white Turbant being brought, enriched with precious ſtones, it was put vpon Selims head, and hee being clothed with ſtately and magnificent habits, hee mounted vpon another horſe, and all the others doing the like, the Coach of the dead was againe couered, and the Enſignes rayſed, all the ſouldiours making great acclamations in the name of their new Emperour. In this manner they accompayned him to the Palace, and there the deputies of the Empire, according to their degrees, went and kiſſed his hands.
            Preſently Selim gaue order to the gouernment of Iuſtice, and performed  the accuſtomed larges to the Ianiſaries, and giuing to euery one two Larges dew to the Ianiſaries by the new Emperour. thouſand Aſpres. At the ſame time it was decreed, that the bodie of his deceaſed father ſhould be conducted to Conſtantinople, to be buried in the Sepulcher which hee cauſed to bee built in his life time, named by The Sepulcher of Solyman. the Turkes, Marata, which is as it were an Hoſpitall for the poore. Some

ſay that this Tombe is the moſt ſumptuous that is to bee found at this day, it  being in the great Moſquee. He gaue the charge of this conduct to Hamant Baſha, who had married one of his Neeces, and to Ferrat Cap Aga, commaunding that this corps ſhould beſides be accompanied with all the Ianiſaries, who were then in the Campe, with many other perſons of note, carrying with them the Emperiall Enſigne.
            
               Selim remained at Belgrade with the reſt of the armie to march afterward more commodiouſly. The bodie of Solyman entered into Conſtantinople The entrance of Solymans bodie into Conſtantinople. the 22. of Nouember, there being firſt gone foorth to receiue him Muphty, otherwiſe called Muplety, who is the ſupreame of their Prieſts, and one who (they ſay) was diſſended of the line of Mahomet, he being followed of all  the Doctors of their law, that then were in the towne. Scander Baſha Gouernour, with all the Treaſurers, and other Lords of qualitie who were remaining at Conſtantinople, with an infinit number of other ſorts of people came alſo before him. They were all clad in blacke, with little Turbants of wooll on their heads in ſigne of ſorrow. Theſe hauing drawne the bodie out of the Coach, the principals of them tooke it and lifted it vp vpon the palmes of their hands, carying it thus raiſed on high through the towne, in changing it from hand to hand, and bearing it by turnes; the Doctors of the law marching before, and reading with a high voyce euen vnto the Sepulcher, wherein he was put, with all the ceremonies and accuſtomed ſolemnities  due to ſuch Princes. Vpon the Sepulcher was put a cloath of very fine Chamblet with his Cimetrie, to notifie that he had ended his daies in the warre; and at the very top of it there was a Turban, like to that which he was wont to weare in his life time.
            But now to returne to our diſcourſe: the Emperour Maximilian knowing for certaine the death of Solyman, and coronation of Selim, (which was ſeuen weekes after) it being ſent to him from Venice by Guy of Noremberg his Ambaſſadour, reſident in the Seigniorie of Venice for his Maieſtie. All the Captaines were greatly aſtoniſhed thereat, conſidering how and with what prudence theſe barbarous people were able to keepe ſo ſecret ſuch a  notable accident, in ſuch ſort that their owne armie neuer knew any thing thereof. Which thing (if it had been diſcouered) had without all doubt bin an occaſion that the ſouldiours mutining to ſacke the treaſure, had opened a way to the Emperour to attaine to a moſt euident and ſingular victorie. But Baſha Mehemet in his owne iudgement foreſeeing all the diſorder, and knowing that of his Lords life depended the good of all the armie, meant to prouide for it in time: and for this cauſe he concealed the death of Solyman, to the end that the armie ſhould not perceiue it ſelfe depriued of their Lord, and that in diuiding it ſelfe it ſhould not by that meanes open the way of a notable victorie to the enemie. 
            
            After then that the Turkiſh armie was departed out of Hungarie, there happened a new diſaſter at Iauerin, (where was the force of the Emperiall Iauerin burned by chāce. Campe) there being the laſt of September fire ſet on the lodging of a Hungarian Lord, by negligence of his Cooke. This fire by little and little increaſed ſo farre, by meanes of a great winde which blew from the Weſt, that all

the houſes being made of wood (after the manner of that countrie) not any  houſe was exempted from burning, except the Palace and Church which were built of ſtone, and about ſome 17. little houſes: and it was a great chance that this fire pearced not euen into the Church, wherein was all the munition: which if it had happened, it had brought a great misfortune, for that the towne (although it be litttle) was ſtored and filled with ſouldiours, and of all other ſorts of people who had followed this armie: and for feare of this inconuenience, the Emperour mounted preſently on horſebacke, and with great ſpeede retired farre from the towne. That which was not conſumed by the fire, ſerued as a pray to the ſouldiours, ſome of whom moſt wickedly put fire to certaine houſes, that they might more freely get pillage,  as they did. The Emperour was ſo ſad for this misfortune, that he neuer felt any ſuch griefe in all theſe warres, hauing alwaies reſerued this place for the ſuretie of his armies: and ſeeing that therein all the neighbours did vſually retire their goods and perſons, and ſpecially of all the countrie thereabouts, his Maieſtie commaunded that this place ſhould bee reeſtabliſhed by the ſouldiours and peaſants. And the winter being come, and the enemie retired, Maximilian diſmiſſeth his armie. he diſmiſſed his armie, and moſt affectionatly he thanked all the Lords, who ſo willingly were come to ſuccour him: and this done, he retired to Vienna, leauing at Iauerin a good and ſtrong garriſon of the braueſt and valianteſt ſouldiours of the armie, as well foote as horſe vnder the charge of  Count Salms. He preſently cauſed the place to be repayred, by the money which the Emperour had ſent him from Vienna. The troupes of Auſtria were ſent to Odemburg to reſiſt the ordinarie incurſions of the Turkes. In Caniſa (a Fortreſſe very nigh to Sighet) was ſent to commaund there Captaine Thay, with 1000. horſe, and as many footmen.
            In the meane time the Emperour called the Eſtates of Auſtria into the towne of Vienna, to aduiſe of new preparations for the yeere following, as well in Hungarie as in Tranſiluania, where alwaies continued the warre betweene him and King Iohn, for whoſe ayde remained Portau Baſha with many Tartars, who ſurpaſſing ours in multitude and crueltie, maſſacred all thoſe that they encountred, not pardoning any ſexe, and without any diſtinction  
               The barbarouſnes of the Tartars. of age, cutting the infants in the middeſt, whom they afterward roſted and eate.
            The Tranſiluanian hauing in the former yeere loſt Tocchay, which Tocchay taken by Schuendy from the Tranſiluaniās, and beſieged by King Iohn. 
               Schuendy had taken from him with 30. peeces of Artillerie, and great ſtore of munition which he found there, and willing to get it againe, came with his Tartars to beſiege it, making a batterie with nine Cannons. The aſſieged valiantly behauing themſelues, did not any thing faile in their defence. Schuendy (although then he was very ill) willing neuertheleſſe not to be ſlacke in the office of a prudent and diſcreete Captaine, ſent for ſuccours to the Emperour,  not any thing doubting but he would be well able to chaſe away the enemie. The Emperour preſently ſent him 1000. horſe, conducted by Henry Stampir, with ſixe Enſignes of foote, and with them he ſent his chiefeſt Phiſition to cure Schuendy. He alſo ſent 50. waggons laden with victuall, and coyne to pay the ſouldiours.
            
               
               Iohn being with his armie before Tocchay, where alreadie he had been  eight daies, and hoping to come to the end of his enterpriſe, he was informed that 10000. Tartars, who warred with the Turkes in his fauour, being mutined and departed from the Campe, were diſperſed in his Prouince, committing infinite outrages, and burning many townes. Iohn vpon this newes raiſed his ſiege: and hauing ſent to theſe mutiners, that they ſhould A mutinie betweene the Tartars and King Iohn. quietly retire themſelues, he vſed all the meanes not to meddle with them by fight. In the end, ſeeing that intreaties and all perſwaſions ſerued him to no purpoſe, and that continuing their crueltie, they would by no meanes deſiſt, moued by a iuſt choller he aſſailed them on the ſudden, and cut in peeces more then 6000. of them. Thoſe who remained, and the Turks ioyned  with them, deſirous to be reuenged for their companions, came and beſieged Iohn at Varadin, which is a place of ſmall ſtrength, and where they might haue taken him aliue, if they had had any peeces of Artillerie. Neuertheleſſe Iohn fearing the worſt, and not willing to haue the reproach to be beſieged by ſuch raskalitie, ſecretly auoyded the towne, and retired to an other place of more ſtrength. There hauing gathered a greater armie he againe aſſailed them, and hauing made a great butcherie of them to the number of 20000. beſides the wounded who were in great number, he ſaued Tartars defeated by King Iohn. from their hands many thouſands of ſoules, who they led into miſerable ſeruitude. Among theſe were many gentlewomen, which they had taken from the Caſtle of Beregras, to which they were retired for the greater ſuretie,  all that countrie remaining in the meane time (which is towards Caſſouia) ſo deſolate, for the great and horrible cruelties which theſe people had vſed, that it was not poſſible to endure any more.
            During ſuch mutinies, 400. Ianiſaries paſſed very neere to Filech, a place neighbouring to Sepuſa, committing where they paſſed infinit outrages, and vſing acts altogether barbarous and cruell: and hauing taken out of the mountaines more then 8000. ſoules, they gaue a great amazement to all the neighbour people of Danubius, of Vagne, and of Arabon. The Turkes a little before had taken two Forts (ſuch as they were) named Comar and Calambach, Comar, Calambach, Gheſtez, and Vitan taken by the Turks. as alſo thoſe of the garriſon of Alberegalis had done the like, ſeazing  themſelues by forces of Gheſtez, and Vitan: and thus daily increaſing, there was at Palota, Veſprimia, and at Tata a great doubt of the enemie. The Tartars after the ouerthrow which they had receiued of the Tranſiluanian, ioyning themſelues a new with other Turkes, among which there was a good companie of Ianiſaries, and many Valachians, who robbed and ſpoiled through all Roſſia and Podolia, which are countries belonging to the King of Polonia, vſing all acts of hoſtilitie, fiering all the villages and Caſtles, maſſacring the old and impotent perſons, and making ſlaues of more then 100000. ſoules: finally, attempting to beſiege the Palatin of Roſſia in a Tartars defeated in Polonia. Caſtle, he making many ſallies vpon them, with a good number of ſouldiours  he n a manner put them all to the ſword, and taking from them 12. peeces of Artillerie, they were forced to retire.
            The Emperour being at the aſſemblie of his Eſtates of Auſtria, whom he A Diet in Auſtria, in which was granted ſuccours to Maximilian. cauſed to bee called thither (as wee aboue haue written) propoſed to all the

Prelates and principall of the Nobilitie, what neede he had of ſuccours to withſtand the violence of the enemies. And for this effect he demaunded  of them the ſame ſuccours as was graunted the yeere before, which amounted to little leſſe then 300000. Florins for the entertainment of 900. horſe, which they were bound to furniſh. And beſides he demaunded of them, that he who had 100. Florins of reuenew ſhould pay for a horſe, and he who ſhould haue more, ſhould alſo furniſh one for euery hundred. And becauſe that although his Maieſtie would march in perſon to the warre, he would not that the Nobilitie of the countrie ſhould goe thither with him, and in ſtead of ſuch a perſonall ſeruice, he demaunded of them that they would furniſh him with the pay of 1000. horſe, and 5. companies of foote. And beſides,  he would that vntill 6. yeeres were compleate, euery one ſhould come to labour at Vienna ſixe daies in the yeere.
            To theſe demaunds, as very exceſſiue, the Auſtrians not willing to condiſcend, were wilfull in their opinions, deferring for many daies to make an anſwere, giuing others openly to vnderſtand, that firſt they ſhould permit them the exerciſe of the Confeſſion of Ausbourg. The Emperour not being able to containe himſelfe from anger, cauſed to be declared vnto them that he had not propoſed any article concerning the faith and religion, and that therefore they ſhould anſwer to his demaunds, if they would not incurre his indignation. In the end they againe aſſembling together, yeelded  to theſe articles: to wit, that they were content yeerely to giue him 138000. Florins, and 300000. for the fortification of Iauerin: that he who had 100. Florins of yeerely reuenew, ſhould entertaine at his owne charges for the ſeruice of the warre one horſe for three moneths: that he who had a greater reuenew ſhould alſo furniſh more: that if his Maieſtie would march to the confines of the Prouince for the affayres thereof, they ſhould bee bound of fifteene perſons to furniſh him with one: if he departed out of the confines, they ſhould giue him one of euery thirtie. This laſt offer was in ſtead of 1000. horſe, which he demaunded to ſerue him in place of the Nobilitie. After theſe accords, the Auſtrians minding to renew againe the article of the  Confeſſion of Ausbourg, being not content with the deniall which the Emperour had made them thereof, meant againe to replie. But he gaue them The exerciſe of the Confeſſion of Auſbourg denied to the Auſtrians. to vnderſtand, that thoſe who would not liue nor beleeue as himſelfe did, might ſell their goods and depart the countrie: and by this concluſion he made them ſilent.
            In the meane time, endeuouring himſelfe to aſſure his countries againſt the incurſions of the Turkes, who remained with the Tranſiluanian from the death of Solyman, he laboured nothing elſe but to make peace with the Turkes, knowing that Selim (after being come to the Empire) had confirmed peace with the Venecians, who among ſo great warres which his father had, would neuer take armes againſt him, although they were often required  thereunto.
            The Princes of Italie endeuoring themſelues to bee well liked of with The Pope, and Turkes of Florence, Ferrara and Mantua, ſent ſuccours to the Emp. 
               Maximilian, ſent him new ſuccours, among others Coſine de Medicis eſtabliſhing the more by this meanes his owne Eſtate. The Pope, the Duke of

Sauoy, and he of Ferrara did alſo ſuccour him with good ſtore of men. His  Maieſtie had before time ſent to the Grand Seigniour for Ambaſſadour George Hoſſute, thinking by him to negotiate ſome peace with Solyman, whom George Hoſſute. he thought to be yet liuing. But this Ambaſſadour vnderſtanding for certaine vpon the way the deceaſe of the Turke, returned towards the new Emperour Ambaſſadour of the Emperour ſaw Selim. 
               Selim, at the ſame time that he went to Conſtantinople, after the bodie of his father, as wee haue ſaid before. At this meeting it was permitted him to ſee his Maieſtie, but not to entertaine any talke of peace with him: Mehemet Baſha ſhewing to him that he had been ſent towards the Maieſtie of the deceaſed Solyman, and that ſeeing that he was dead, he was not to treate with his ſucceſſour; and that therefore if his King would any thing  with Selim, he ſhould ſend another, or elſe himſelfe. This Baſha did particularly counſel him to demaund peace of Selim, and that otherwiſe there could not but euill happen to Maximilian.
            
            When that Hoſſute arriued at Belgrade, Cheretsken (in times paſt Captaine and Gouernour of Iula) was there with bolts on his heeles. This man made great promiſes to the Turke who conducted Hoſſute, to bee permitted to ſpeake to him: but he could neuer obtaine it. And not being able to attaine Excuſes by writing of Cheretsken for the yeelding and loſſe of Iula. this fauour, he writ a long letter, by which he ſent him word of all that which he endured at Iula, and how he had been deceiued by a vaine hope of ſuccours; alleadging among other things, that he had maintained the ſiege for 70. daies, that one day he had ſeene 14. Turkiſh Enſignes vpon the wall: and  beſides there was happened to him during this ſiege a great and daungerous ſicknes: that with all this, after he had a long time expected the ſuccours which was promiſed him, which neuer appeared, he was conſtrained to accept of compoſition. In the end he deſired all his friends to make ſuite for him to the Emperours Maieſtie, ſignifying that he might bee ſet at libertie ſo ſoone as the Sangiach ſhould be deliuered in exchange of him: and being at libertie, he offered to remaine in ſuch a priſon as it would pleaſe his Maieſtie, there to attend the iudgement which ſhould be giuen vpon his cauſe, not perceiuing himſelfe culpable in any thing. Cheretsken writ to Hoſſute concerning all theſe things, to the end he ſhould report them to the Emperour. 
            
            In the meane time it was held for certaine in the Court, that the Lord of Arrach might ſet at libertie the Sangiach of Alberegalis, whom he held priſoner in one of his Fortreſſes named Zetipont, to redeeme Cheretsken, there hauing been made (before this bad fortune) a treatie of mariage betweene them, this Lord hauing promiſed to Cheretsken one of his daughters. But a while after fortune being no way fauourable to this poore priſoner, there was heard of him a miſerable end. For many complaining to Selim, for hauing receiued by this Captaine many cruell iniuries, ſome hauing by his  commaund loſt their noſe, others hauing had their eares cut off, others their mouth, and all alleadging againſt him ſuch like cruelties, Selim moued with ſuch a report, gaue him vnto them that accuſed him, permitting them to take what reuenge of him they would. Theſe taking a Tunne nayled within full of great nayles, whereof the points were inward, and carrying it to the top

of a high hill, incloſed Cheretsken within, and after they caſt him headlong The cruell death of Cheretsken. from the top thereof to the foote, and by this cruell and horrible paine they  cauſed him to dye. The Lord of Arrach receiued great diſpleaſure at this death, for that he could not relieue him, and within a while after he had 50000. crownes for a ranſome of the Sangiach: and although that he ſhould remaine debter of another great ſumme, the Emperour neuertheleſſe would that he ſhould be ſet at libertie. He being ſet on his way, accompanied with Iohn Suizen a Councellor of Hungarie: and being arriued on the frontier, Suizen at his returne reported marueilous things of ioy and mirth that the Turkes made for the returne of this Lord. Beſides the money by him diſburſed, they gaue libertie to Captaine Gorger, who was taken at Iula, and  who for his ranſome was taxed at 40000. crownes.
            
               Schuendy being now growne to good health from ſo long a ſicknes, and receiuing good ſtrong troupes, went into the field with his people, and beſieged the Caſtle of Zatmar, well furniſhed with all things, except men. This belonged to Bec the Emperours capitall enemie, and the principall author Zarmar taken by Schuendy. of the enmitie and diſcord which was nouriſhed betweene his Maieſtie and King Iohn. He ſeeing they came to beſiege him, he ſecretly departed from this Fortreſſe, which being out of hand ſtraightly beſieged, in the end the ſouldiours within yeelded, their liues and baggage ſaued. This taking was vpon the 14. of Ianuarie, and in that place was gotten great ſtore of bootie:  and Schuendy freely ſetting at libertie the Becs wife, with all his moueables, retained onely for himſelfe all the Artillerie.
            
               Maximilian was in the meane time to continue the Diets of his Eſtates, and hauing been alreadie at Bruna, and after at Troppa, to goe from thence to Prage in Bohemia, in which places he made his demaunds: and at Bruna it was concluded, that in ſtead of the Nobilitie they ſhould giue him 1200. horſe, which his Maieſtie ſhould ſend whither it pleaſed him: and beſides that, the Nobilitie ſhould be bound to keep the limits of the countrie, when there ſhould bee neede thereof. He being arriued at Prage, he made his entrie thereinto very ſolemnely, being receiued by the Citizens vnder a Canapie, with great pompe and magnificence. From thence he ſent the Duke of  Bauier, and Doctor Inuch his Councellor, with certaine other, to the Diet of Ratisbon. The Bohemians at the Diet held at Prage, accorded that the ſuccours before graunted for three yeeres ſhould bee reduced into one onely The Bohemians, Sleſians, and Morauians doe graunt ſuccours to the Emperour. payment, ſeeing that the appointed money for this effect ſhould be committed to cuſtodie into a certaine place, and that theſe ſhould not come into his Maieſties coffers, except they were imployed againſt the Turke. Beſides, all the Eſtates graunted during the ſpace of two yeeres the ſuccours which followeth: to wit, that all the houſes being vnder the precinct of fees belonging to Princes, Barons, and Gentlemen, as well Spirituals as fenditaries, ſhould pay for one yeere halfe a Dollor, except the publike Bathes, the houſes  of Paſtors, and the ſhops of Artiſans: that the towne of Prage, and the other ſubiects to the Emperour, and thoſe who make the third eſtate of the kingdome, ſhould pay three Dollors for euery houſe. All the cities, boroughs, and villages euery one, gaue 100. Duckets, the labourers 9. the ſeruants

and mercinaries a white groſhe: thoſe who put mony to intereſt aſwell  ſpirituall as ſecular, payed ſo much to his Maieſtie which the intereſt came vnto by their bargaines: but if the Emperour ſhould goe in perſon to the warre againſt the Turke, they ſhould be bound hauing 10000. dollors at intereſt, to entertaine in the warre a horſeman well armed for foure moneths: and that the poorer ſorte ſhould contribute rate for rate of their goods: and the ſame ſhould be practiſed if they had neede for the defence of the 15. Dukedomes of Bohemia; to wit, in entertayning one horſeman 15. Dukedomes in Bohemia. well armed for euery reuenew of 6000. dollers, and 10. footemen for a 100. ſubiects which ſhould be vnder his fee. By this meanes the Emperour was ſuccoured from all parts with men and monie, to preuent any more a ſuddaine  ſurpriſall by the enemie, when at any time he would againe make incurſions into Hungarie.
            On the other ſide Schuendy after one ſiege, had yeelded vnto him by compoſition Mourach taken by Schuendy. their liues and baggage ſaued, the Caſtle of Mourach ſituated in Tranſiluania. All theſe preparations, and this loſſe gaue the Tranſiluanian ſufficient matter to thinke of: for that this Fortres was of great importance to him, being on the way betwixt Polonia and Ruſſia, from whence by this occaſion he could not draw any more ſuccours, except with a long compaſſe by Moldauia, which was a very teadious and daungerous iourney. After this taking, Schuendy went to beſige Huſt a place of no leſſe importance then the other. 
            
            Theſe enterpriſes and executions gaue vehement ſuſpition, that betweene the Emperour and the Turke would neuer be any accord, although afterwards both the one part and other treated thereof: conſidering that in precedent yeares, by reaſon of the ſame place of Mourach, all the negotiation of peace was broken betweene Ferdinand and Iohn: it being verie likely that the Tranſiluanian for the loſſe of theſe two places, would declare to the Grand Seigniour the abſolute loſſe of all Tranſiluania, and with all excite him to giue him ayde, as it appeared incontinent. For the Baſha of Buda fayled not to ſend to the Emperour that he ſhould cauſe Schuendy to retire from Huſt, and in the meane time tooke councell with his people to aduiſe  for needfull ayde for King Iohn, giuing order to the affaires of the warre.
            In this time Edward being in returne from Conſtantinople, who the Emperour had ſent thither to treate of a peace, brought newes that the Turke had geuen charge to Portau Baſha, and to the Belerbie of Greece to prepare themſelues to march into Hungarie: but the ſame Turke hauing vnderſtoode for certaine, that the Emperour would ſend his Ambaſſadours to negotiate with him, and to determine the peace, he had hope that theſe would not haſten their voyage. Theſe Ambaſſadours were Antonie Verance 
               Ambaſſadours of the Emperour to Selim for peace. 
                Biſhop of Agria, who had remained fiue yeares in Solymans Court in the quallitie and condition of an ordinarie Ambaſſadour, and Tijffempach Councellour to the Emperour, both of them men endewed with good vnderſtanding, and hauing the knowledge of diuers languages. Theſe with a great companie departed from the Court to goe to Conſtantinople, the

Emperour not omitting for all that to continew his Diets, to the end that  he might alwaies hold himſelfe more readie for defence againſt the enemie.
            Then was celebrated that of Poſon, in which after many complaints made by the Hungarian Barons againſt certaine Captaines of garriſons, in the end it was determined by common conſent, that for this yeare they ſhould pay the Emperour 150000. Crownes, which ſumme ſhould not be Succours graunted by the Hungars to the Emperour. drawen from any others, but of the families of peaſants, in paying for euery one two Dollors: and beſides euery familie ſhould be bound to labour 12. dayes in the frontier places: but in the yeare when any Diet ſhould not be held, the taxe ſhould at leaſt be reduced to the halfe: that the Emperour  ſhould ſend Comiſſaries, part whereof ſhould be Hungars, and part Germanes, on this ſide, and beyond Danubius, to informe him of the goods and poſſeſſions held by the Captaines and officers of the Emperour, to the end to reſtore them to their firſt poſſeſſors: that they ſhould chaſtice all thoſe who had committed robberies, and that they ſhould giue order that theſe robbers ſhould not any more moleſt the labourers, that they ſhould adnihilate the grieuous and extraordinarie impoſitions layd vpon them by Schuendy, aſwell of wine as of beaſtes: that the Hungars not being receiued into the Countrie of Auſtria, nor into the other prouinces, might redeeme the Caſtles and townes engaged before by the King of Hungarie: that the  Emperour ſhould graunt the Prelateſhip, and other eccleſiaſticall dignities onely to Hungars, and other perſons capable: that if his Maieſtie would retaine to himſelfe the recouered goods from the poſſeſſion of the Tranſiluanian, which before appertayned to the Hungars, he ſhould then giue in recompence thereof ſome others: that the gentleman who had 100. villages vnder him, ſhould according to the ancient cuſtome, furniſh 10. horſes and 8. footemen, when the Emperour ſhould goe in perſon to the warre, and leſſe by halfe when he ſhould ſend thither his Lieutenant, all amounting vnto 10000. horſe and 8000. footemen: but in time of peace they ſhould be bound to furniſh but three horſes for defence of the frontiers.  All this was decreed in the Diet of Poſon, whereof the Emperour was verie well content. And to appeaſe euery one he maintayned Iuſtice in the Countrie, and cauſed to be chaſtiſed many Captaines of garriſons who purloyned the pay from the ſouldiours, and beſides ſhewed to all great demonſtrations of frendſhip: which greatly contented all the people, &amp; ſpecially for the affection which he cauſed to appeare by hauing a deſire to ſee them liue in peace, which he inſtantly purſued, hauing the better to attaine thereunto, ſent by the ſaid Ambaſſadours many goodly preſents to the principall of Solymans Court.
            Theſe Ambaſſadours arriued at Conſtantinople the 22. of Auguſt, and within few daies after viſited the Baſhaes of the Port (which we aboue ſaid  call amongſt vs Court) to wit, Mehemet, Portau, Pialy, Achmat, and Mahomet: and the fourth of ſeptember, (being againe gone to ſee Mahomet Baſha ſuperintendant of all the Empire) they went with him vnto Andrionopoly, where then was the new Emperour. In this place the conditions

of peace were propounded, and after ſundrie diſputations thereof, in the Peace betweene Maximilian and Selim. 
                ende it was concluded with the ſame conditions, with which before it had been decreed betweene Ferdinand and Solyman.
            
            The Ambaſſadours being returned to Vienna, they releaſed and quitted many things both of the one part and other, and new borders were limited betweene the countrie of both parts. And vpon this deede the Emperour ſent Schuendy with many other deputed to ſee the differences which might be vpon thoſe limits; beſides giuing him charge to finde the meanes to hinder the incurſions and inſolencies which the Turkes made without any reſpect of the truce lately decreed. George Tury Captaine for the Emperour prouoked with ſuch courſes, after he had made complaint to the Baſha of  Buda, in the end he twice put himſelfe into the fielde, once by Caniſa, and an other time by Iauarin, and in ſuch ſort aſſayled the Turkes, that hauing checked their fooliſh temeritie, they durſt no more trouble the countrie.
            In the meane time the Emperour for ſome ſuſpitions conceiued againſt ſome of the principall of Hungarie, cauſed the Hungars to be required (to diuert the practiſes, which Iohn vſed in their behalfe to draw them to him) to this, that they would contribute to the pay of 5000. horſe for the preſeruation of the countrie: but they expreſſely denied this contribution, being moued at this, that the vacant goods were no more ſolde amongſt them,  but were giuen to their enemies and to ſtrangers, making inſtance that ſince he could not any more aſſiſt them in his owne perſon in all important affaires of the kingdome, hee would nominate Lieutenant generall for his Maieſtie, the Palatin, and Archbiſhop of Strigonia Primate of the kingdome. The Arch Biſhop of Strigonia Primate of Hungarie. The Emperour then for that time diſſolued this Diet, and retired vntill another time. On the other ſide the Tranſiluanian ſought to the Baſha of Buda, thinking to demaund ayde of him, and to haue of him meanes to recouer that which was taken from him by his enemies, of whom he then thought to haue better commoditie, for that they were buſied in the wars of Germanie, and deuided amongſt themſelues. The Baſha aunſwered him that he could not doe it without the expreſſe commaund of his Lord, exhorting  him in the meane time to remaine in peace. But Iohn continuing his determination recouered certaine Fortreſſes: and hauing drawen to him Guilaſſa a Hungarian Baron, who was malecontent with the Emperour, he had of him Huſt, a verie ſtrong Caſtle, ſituated amongſt the mountaines of Salem, not being able to induce the Turke to breake truce with the Emperour.
            His Maieſtie (hauing vnderſtood that Selim had ſent an armie towards Muſcouia, by Podolia, and Kiania (Prouinces of the kingdome of Polonia) againſt the Duke of Muſcouia, who hindered the cutting which the Turke  would haue made in (the riuer of Huſt yeelded to King Iohn. 
               This cutting was of this riuer Volga, within it of Don, called Tanais, the better to bring the commodities which come by that riuer by the ſaid riuer of Don, euen vnto Conſtantinople by the great Sea. Volga) fearing that vnder falſe intelligence it might turne againſt himſelfe, ſent an Ambaſſadour of his to Conſtantinople, by him to giue Selim to vnderſtand, how the Tranſiluanian, againſt the articles of truce, was in armes, and cauſed it to be bruited abroad that he would aſſayle Hungarie: and vpon this he deſired his greatnes not

to cenſure hardly of him, if he defended himſelfe, aſſuring him that though he had not giuen any conſentment to ſuch new enterpriſes, yet he had giuen  ſufficient order and as much as was needfull, for oppoſing himſelfe againſt Iohn: but if this enterpriſe was done with his conſent, he not knowing of his Maximilian complaineth to Selim of King Iohn. part any occaſion thereof, he deſired him that he would at one word tel him, to the end he might iuſtifie his cauſe, or elſe freely to accept of warre. Selim anſwered him, that he had neither aduiſed nor conſented thereto, neither for the one nor other; and promiſed him if the Tranſiluanian or Moldauian were in armes to offend or diſturbe him, that both the one and other ſhould be by him puniſhed.
            The Emperour ſatisfied by this anſwere, afterwards laboured to doe ſo  much to effect this, that certaine of the principall of the Hungars (who were diſcontent with him, for that they were not in ſuch eſteeme with his Maieſtie, as they thought they had well deſerued) ſhould not proceede any further in rebellion, which alreadie began to be on foote towards Caſſouia and Tocchay, theſe Lords being prouoked thereto by the Tranſiluanian (as afterward was knowne) who did ſolicite them with fayre promiſes, making on his part great preparations, the better to ſeaze himſelfe of certaine other important places. But the Turke writ to him that he ſhould deſiſt, and threatned Selim threatneth K. Iohn. to depriue him of his eſtate, if in that time he enterpriſed any thing againſt the Emperour. The Hungars being thus remoderated and pacified  with their King, gaue order to repayre their Fortreſſes.
            In this time the Emperour would neuer condiſcend to the perſwaſions of Maximilian ſolicited by the Pope and Venecians to make warre vpon ye Turke. the Venecians or Pope to make warre vpon the Turke, ſaying, he well knew that in time matters would bee pacified, and he alone ſhould remaine charged with the burthen of the warre. The cauſe which moued the Venecians to ſtirre vp as well the Emperour as other Chriſtian Monarches, was, that they might preuaile againſt the Turke, who had ſent to them a Chiauſs to demaund the kingdome of Cypreſſe, as depending on the Eaſt Empire: and well knowing that they had not forces ſufficient to withſtand ſo great a Lord, they did ſolicite the Pope that he would giue them ayde, and in like  ſort to employ his Holines to all the Princes for the ſame effect: for which, they had diſpatched to his Emperiall Maieſtie Iacques Soranze a Venecian, a man greatly eſteemed, with charge to goe further to the King of Polonia. But the goodly and apparant reaſons of this man could effect nothing with Maximilian, for the onely conſideration which we haue ſaid: and faining himſelfe ill at eaſe, diſmiſſed Soranze, breaking all hope to ioyne Germanie in this league. Selim on the other part hauing ſome doubt that the Tranſiluanian would accord with the Emperour, (although he was well aſſured of Maximilian, by reaſon of the truce and many other buſineſſes diſpatched together) cauſed the towne of Buda to bee fortified, and other his places of Hungarie. The Pope not minding to be directed with the firſt word, by the  declarations that Maximilian had made, to the diſcourſes and perſwaſions which his Nonce had vſed to his Maieſtie: the Emperour to pleaſe his Holines, cauſed a Diet to be called at Spire, where hauing cauſed very largely to bee layd out the demaunds of the Pope and Venecians, with many offers

made to his Maieſtie by the Leaguers: after many aduices, it was reſolued  that they would doe no other thing therein, although they had certaine knowledge of more then one perſon, that there were there many of the principals of the aſſembled, who freely and liberally would accord to the Popes demaunds, they being aduiſed that it was an excellent occaſion to preſerue Chriſtendome, and ſpecially Germanie and Hungarie from ſo many imminent perils as enuironed them.
            With this reſolution the Diet was diſſolued, in which no other thing was Maximilian reſigneth the kingdomes of Hungarie and Bohemia to his ſonne Rodolph. done, but the voluntarie yeelding that the Emperour made to his ſonne Rodolph of the kingdomes of Hungarie and Bohemia, with the conſent of the Lords of both the kingdomes: in regard of which, they made at Vienna and  Iſpurch great feaſts and triumphs.
            Within a while after Sigiſmond King of Polonia ſent his Ambaſſadours to the ſaid Rodolph, to congratulate with him for the honours which he had receiued of his father: and within a very little while after this King (who was of the ancient houſe of Iagellons) departed this world. This man was the The death of Sigiſmond King of Polonia. ſonne of Sigiſmond the firſt of that name, and of Bonna the daughter of the Duke of Millan, and had no other brothers, but onely foure ſiſters. He maried one of the daughters of the Emperour Ferdinand, who being dead, he maried for his ſecond wife one of his ſubiects, a gentlewoman endued with exquiſit beautie and incomparable grace, by whom he had not any children.  He cauſed not his warlike deedes ſo to appeare againſt the Turkes, Muſcouits, and Tartars as his father did: but neuertheleſſe he knew well to maintaine his kingdome in peace. For default of iſſue begotten by him, the Princes, and Lords of the kingdome (who haue authoritie for the election of a new King) aſſembled themſelues to chuſe another, there being remaining of the Iagellons but one ſiſter of the laſt deceaſed, not yet maried. The ſucceſſion of this kingdome doth not ordinarily fall to the kindred of the dead, but commeth ſometimes by election, for which is made a great aſſemblie, tearmed amongſt them and the Germanes a Diet. In this there are preſent The manner of the election of a King of Polonia. fifteene Prelates of the kingdome: to wit, the Archbiſhop of Gneſna chiefe of all, and Legat natus for the Pope in Poland, the Archbiſhop of Leopolde,  the Biſhop of Carcouia, he of Vratiſlauia, the Biſhops of Chelmen, Polocen, Varnia, Clunem, Preſmilia, and of Cameneren, which ten Biſhops are of the kingdome. There are foure other of Lituania who alſo haue their voyce at ſuch Diets: to wit, the Biſhop of Samogithie, of Vilne, of Chronien, and of Lutturienſa. After theſe Prelates there are preſent the gouernours of Caſtles, amongſt which the moſt noted is he of Cracouia, who is the moſt fauoured of the King, for that he hath in his cuſtodie the life of his Maieſtie. This man goeth before the Palatins of Poland, which are thoſe of Cracouia, Poſnania, Coloſenſe, Siradienſe, Breſten, Lanticienſe, Ruſſia, Innonbleuia, Iublinenſe, Belcenſe, Plocen, Rauenſe, and he of Maſſouia.  With theſe came the ſeuen Palatins of Lituania: to wit, he of Vilne, Kioky, Samogithia, Trocenſe, Vitilienſe, Polocenſe, and he of Nouograde. The Palatins haue many Prouinces vnder them, and euery Prouince ſendeth thither two meſſengers. The Chauncellor, Vicechauncellor, Treaſurer of the

kingdome, and he of the Court haue in this aſſemblie places in the firſt rank.  All that which is reſolued vpon in this Diet by the greateſt part of thoſe that are there, is held firme and ſtable. And if therein be treated any matter which belongeth not to the election of a new King, it may be reſolued in this aſſemblie, although it bee againſt the Kings will. And from thence it commeth that the Kings are leſſe warlike in action, then in courage, becauſe that they cannot vndertake any warre, if it bee not graunted to them by ſuch aſſemblies.
            This Diet whereof we now write, for the election of a new King, was appointed at Varſouia. To it were come many Ambaſſadours from the greateſt Princes of Europe, ſome requeſting and ſuing for their Maſters, and others ſoliciting in the behalfe of thoſe whom they would recommend. From  
               Charles the King of France there was firſt come thither the Lord of Lanſac, Ambaſſadours from the King of France purſuing in Polonia the election of Henry D. of Aniou. well vnderſtanding the Slauonian tongue, and greatly experienced in theſe Northerly countries; and after there came thither the Biſhop of Valence, of the houſe of Monluc, a good Oratour, as alſo the Lord of Rambouillet. Theſe men by reaſon of their goodly ſpeech and fayre promiſes, ſetting out alſo the great reputation that the Duke of Aniou (brother to Charles) had alreadie gotten through all the world, by the great armies which alreadie he had conducted in thoſe yong yeeres wherein he was, did ſo well, that he for whom they ſpake was choſen King of Poland: and the election publiſhed, preſently there was diſpatched a Lord of Poland to the ſaid Duke of Aniou,  who then (as Lieutenant generall for King Charles) held the towne of Rochell beſieged. This Prince hauing receiued this gracious newes, (which The ſiege of Rochell. tended nothing elſe but to the encreaſe of his glorie, becauſe he ſaw that it was extended to the vttermoſt parts of the world, as well by the proper nature thereof, which is to flie with renowne from one Region to another by paſſing the ſeas, as alſo by reaſon of ſo many Northerly Princes, againſt whom contrarie to all mens opinions he carried away the credit and honor, to be reputed the moſt valiant and warlike Prince of all) conſidering that this ſiege, by reaſon of the ſtrength of the towne, and valiantnes of the ſouldiours who were within, was to continue ſo long a time, that it might bring ſome  preiudice to his new eſtate, and alſo being pricked forward by this Poliſh Lord who was come to him, who had been thereto ſolicited by them that fauoured the aſſieged: his Highnes praied the King his brother that he would giue him leaue and diſmiſſe his armie, after he had made ſome accord with the Rochellers, to the end to aduiſe vpon his particular affayres, and to haſten his voyage into Poland. He being come to Paris, and by the perſwaſion of the King hauing accepted this election, and ſworne betweene the hands of the Ambaſſadours, who were alreadie arriued in this towne, (appointed by the generall aſſemblie of the kingdome of Poland) to keepe and  
               Henry trauaileth into Poland. obſerue the conditions with which he had been choſen, and the lawes of the kingdome, without preiudicing neuertheleſſe his ſucceſſiue right to the Crowne of France, if it ſhould ſo fall out; after he had amaſſed great ſtore of money, to the ſumme of two millions, as well to content thoſe who had choſen him, as to make his voyage, he departed from the Court, accompanied

with the Queene his mother, and with many other Princes and Lords  of France, whereof ſome and the greateſt part accompanied him vnto Polonia. Paſſing through the countrie of the Count Palatin, he there receiued The indiſcretion of Count Palatin of Rhein. ſome diſcourteſie by this Lord, in ſhewing him the picture of the deceaſed Admirall of France, called Coligny, otherwiſe Chaſtillon, ſlaine with many other Lords of the pretended reformed religion in the towne of Paris the 24. of Auguſt the laſt precedent yeere, the which Admirall was alwaies aſſiſted by men of warre and counſell, ſent by the ſaid Lord to the warres, which for the ſpace of tenne or twelue yeeres were maintained in France for Religion.
            As this man thought to braue this Prince, on the other ſide the Duke of  Saxonie was aſtoniſhed at the comming of this new King paſſing through his countrie, ſeeing neere him the Polonians in armes. In the end, Henry at Henry receiued King of Polonia. the beginning of the yeere entered into his kingdome, he being receiued thereinto with great applauſe: and after hauing againe ſworne the obſeruance of the countrie lawes, he receiued the tokens and royall Enſignes, according to the ancient cuſtome.
            Almoſt about the ſame time, yet a little before Stephen, otherwiſe called Iohn, ſonne of Iohn the Vayuode, and King of Tranſiluania, departed this world, without any lawfull iſſue. By reaſon of this deceaſe there began to The death of Iohn King of Tranſiluania. breake forth new troubles in Tranſiluania, becauſe that the Turke procured that this Prouince (which was commodious to him for the paſſage into  Hungarie) ſhould maintaine it ſelfe in league with him, and vnder the ſame confederacie which was betweene him and Iohn. On the other ſide, Maximilian aſpired to this kingdome, as well by the right and inheritance of his Pretences of Maximilian to the kingdome of Tranſiluania. deceaſed mother, who had ſucceeded King Lewis her brother, as alſo by reaſon of Stephens will and teſtament, who at his death had named him his heire, and ordained that this kingdome ſhould bee yeelded to him, pricked thereto perhaps by remorſe of conſcience, or elſe fearing that it ſhould fall into the Turkes hands, who made to him great ſuite therefore: which could not happen but to the great damage of all Chriſtendome. But the Barons of the countrie did not ſo preſently reſolue vpon that which they ſhould haue  done, becauſe that on the one ſide they ſeared the Turkes forces (who would not faile to endamage them) if they ſhould giue themſelues to the Emperour. On the other ſide they feared worſe, if they ſhould elect a King at his deuotion. Vpon ſuch feares many moneths paſſed without any reſolution. Certaine men of note fearing the iuſt anger of the Emperour againſt them, becauſe (during the life of King Iohn) they banded againſt his Emperiall Maieſtie in manner of hoſtilitie, firmely reſiſted thoſe who fauoured Maximilians part, and who demaunded that the teſtament of the dead ſhould bee put in execution. Theſe feares engendred amongſt them great diuerſitie, which was an occaſion long to delay their laſt reſolution. But  within a few moneths after it was finally concluded amongſt them, that they ſhould particularly chuſe a King of their nation, minding thereby to preſerue their kingdome, and that they might remaine in peace with the Turke they would pay him the accuſtomed tribute, and that he who ſhould be

choſen King ſhould maintaine himſelfe in peace with the Emperour, they  all iudging thereby that the Turke would haue occaſion to content himſelfe with them, and that the Emperour ſhould not be ſo much offended againſt them. For this conſideration they choſe for their King Stephen Battor, the Stephen Battor choſen King of Tranſiluania. principall Baron amongſt them.
            About this time the Emperour publiſhed the reſignation which he made of the kingdome of Hungarie to the profit of his eldeſt ſonne Rodolph, who the yeere before he cauſed to come out of Spaine, where he had ſoiourned a certaine time with the Catholike King his vncle. The crowning of him with many magnificent and ſumptuous ceremonies was made in the towne of Poſon. And for that ſuch things are notable and worthie to bee knowne  for thoſe who deſire to pleaſe themſelues in the knowledge of that which is The crowning of a King of Hungarie. ſtrange to them, I purpoſe to recite and write them in this hiſtorie.
            The place of Poſon (which anciently was called Piſonium, becauſe it was built by Piſo a Romane) being appointed for this pompe, all the States of Poſon called Piſonium. the countrie were called thither. Theſe being aſſembled, the day before their enterie into the towne, the Emperour and Empreſſe entered by night into the towne in their Coaches with many lights and torches, accompanied with the Prince Mathias and Maximilian their yonger ſonnes the 20. of September, not minding no more then did the other Lords of their Court, to enter therein publikely in the day time. The day following departed from Ambourg (otherwiſe called Sopron) Rodolph, accompanied with his  brother Erneſtus, and many other Princes and Lords. Before him departed Ambourg called Sopron. out of the towne (a league off) his two other brothers Mathias and Maximilian, in whoſe companie was the Archbiſhop of Strigonium Primate of the kingdome, who had with him ſixe Biſhops followed of other Lords, of the Nobilitie and Caualarie of Hungarie. At the meeting, the Archbiſhop (to whom belonged this charge) with a briefe and elegant oration in Latin, after he had prayed to God that it would pleaſe him to make this his entrance and comming proſperous and fortunate for the peace, and comfort of his ſubiects, he promiſed to him in the name of all the kingdome obedience and fidelitie. The Prince anſwered him with a modeſtie mixt with a ſweet kind  of grauitie, that he thanked the kingdome for ſo good an affection in his behalfe, and that he prayed God that he would giue him that grace in ſuch ſort to beare this charge, that his diuine Maieſtie might be well ſerued therein, that it would pleaſe him to make him ſuch an one that all the Prouinces and people of the kingdome might neuer haue occaſion to repent themſelues to haue obeyed him: but rather that they would bee very well content with his election, promiſing to employ all his forces to the good, preſeruation, and augmentation of all the kingdome as well in generall as particular. This ſaid, they began to proceede on towards Poſon with this pompe;  the Hungariſh Caualarie marching before to the number of 3000. horſe, diuided vnder 42. Enſignes, with ſo goodly an order and ſo well guarded, that it was a marueilous thing to ſee, becauſe that theſe ſouldiours did weare vpon their heads moſt goodly and gliſtering head-peeces inriched with gold, and fayre workes ingrauen vpon them, and vpon the front they had great

plumes made of white Peacocks feathers, that couered all the bodie which  they had armed with bright Curaſſes, or Shirts of maile. Vpon the left arme they carried Targets after their manner, certaine whereof had about them three hemmes or borders of the ſame feathers, and in their hands and at the ſaddle bow they held Launces, Sables, Clubbes, and Maces of iron. They were all mounted vpon very good horſes, which made them the more worthie to bee regarded, for ſo much as their harneſſes was inriched with gold, and their head-peeces furniſhed with great plumes, with many precious ſtones and pearles of great value, in ſuch ſort that it ſeemed that this people carried with them all their worth, which is a meanes to incourage and defend themſelues more couragiouſly againſt the enemie. That which made  this Caualarie ſeeme yet more proud and gallant, were the skinnes of Beares and Tygers which the horſemen did weare vpon their ſhoulders, and mane of their horſes. After this ordinance marched all the gentlemen of the traine of the Princes, of Bauier, of the Archduke of Auſtria, of the two yonger ſons of the Emperour, and many other of his Maieſties houſe, ſo nobly apparelled, and their horſes ſo trimly decked, that they made this pompe very magnificent, they all hauing chaines of gold about their neckes. The Prince Maximilian marched after theſe, hauing on his left hand the Prince of Cleueland. After him marched Prince Erneſtus, who had his brother Mathias on his left hand, and Prince Ferdinand of Bauier on his right. Behinde came  Prince Rodolph in the middeſt of the Archduke of Auſtria his vncle, and of Prince William of Bauier. After theſe Princes was to be ſeene the aforeſayd Archbiſhop with his Prelates in the middeſt of the Emperours guard. This new King with this pompe was receiued without the bridge by the Germane Infantrie, which was ranged in battaile to the number of 5000. and of others 500. ſouldiours who were for the guard of the Port, and in like ſort of all the people, who of all ſorts of age and condition were gathered together to ſee and receiue this new King with great applauſe, and to conduct him to the Archiepiſcopall palace which was prepared for him. He went about euening to kiſſe the hands of the Emperour and Empreſſe, who imbraced  him very louingly. The 25. of September the neceſſarie things for his coronation being prepared, the Emperour went to the Cathedrall Church in great pompe with his Emperiall habit, accompanied with his Heraulds, being carried in a chaire, by reaſon that then he was troubled with the gowte which did daily moleſt him. Before him marched the great Marſhall of the Empire, hauing in his hand the naked ſword. After followed the Ambaſſadours of Princes, and the gentlemen of his Court. His Maieſtie being placed on the top of the quire, where his ſiege was prepared vnder a Canapie and that of the Empreſſe: on his right hand ſat the Archduke Charles, Prince William of Bauier, Prince Erneſtus, Ferdinand of Bauier, Maximilian, Mathias, and the Prince of Cleue. On the left hand was placed Iohn Dolfin the Popes  Nuncio, the Ambaſſadour of the Catholike King, and he of Venice. After arriued the new King, accompanied with the Princes which wee haue named, and of all the Nobilitie of Bohemia and Hungarie. Theſe Princes being entered into the Church, and hauing made reuerence to the Emperour,

tooke their places appointed for them. But Rodolph entered into the Veſtarie,  from whence he preſently after came out bare headed, being apparelled with a white robe, which they ſaid ſometime was belonging to S. Stephen the firſt King of Hungarie, and before him went tenne Hungarian Barons ſumptuouſly apparelled, each one carrying a Standard in his hand, wherein were repreſented the tenne Prouinces ſubiect to this kingdome, although the moſt part of them are poſſeſſed at this day by the Turke. Theſe are they, Hungarie, Dalmatia, Croatia, Sclauonia, Seruia, Galiſia, Raſcia, Bulgaria, Boſnia, and Lodomiria. After theſe tenne followed fiue other Barons, the one of which carried a Relique in token of peace, ſet in a round forme of gold. The ſecond carried a Sword vndrawne in a crimoſin veluet ſcabbard  trimmed with ſiluer. The third had the Scepter in his hand. The fourth held a little Globe of gold. And the laſt carried the Crowne. All theſe Iewels (as it is ſaid) belonged to the ſaid S. Stephen, and are among the Hungars held in ſuch regard, that they eſteeme him not for lawfull King who enioyeth them not. Theſe fiue Barons were followed by the new King, who had vpon his right hand the Marſhall of the kingdome, who held in his hand the naked Sword. With this traine and companie the King comming to the quire, two Biſhops came before him into the middeſt of the Church, to wit, he of Agria, and Zagrabia, who after a few words conducted him (being in the middeſt of theſe two) before the Archbiſhop, who was ſolemnely apparelled. At the feete of him Rodolph kneeling, the Archbiſhop gaue him his bleſſing,  and annoynted him with the accuſtomed ceremonies. There the Epiſtle being ended, the Archbiſhop girded his Sword about him, cauſing him to draw it out of the ſcabbard, and to lift it vp on high three times, demonſtrating thereby that he ſhould be bound by armes to defend the faith of Ieſus Chriſt againſt Infidels and Heretikes. Then the Archbiſhop demaunded with a lowd voyce of the people (who are preſent at the ceremonies) if they would accept this Prince for their King. Then euery one with infinit acclamations cried, that they deſired and would haue him for their King. Vpon this the Archbiſhop taketh his oth, and putteth the Crowne vpon his head, and the Scepter in his hand. The King raiſing himſelfe, they  take the Sword from his ſide, which they giue to the Marſhall of the kingdome, to carrie it alwaies before his Maieſtie. Then the Archbiſhop leadeth the King (wearing his Crowne on his head, and holding the Scepter in his hand) into his Throne. At all theſe ceremonies the Archbiſhop vſeth certaine prayers and admonitions appointed for that purpoſe. After that the Archbiſhop ſitteth downe by the King while they ſing Te Deum: which ended, the Archbiſhop returneth to the Aulter to end the Maſſe. That done, the King in the ſame habit goeth out of the Church, cauſing peeces of gold and ſiluer to be throwne to the people, and newly coyned vnder his name:  and from this Church with the ſame companie he went to the Cordiliers, in which he made many Knights as well Hungars as ſtrangers: and from thence he went mounted on horſebacke richly decked (although he did earneſtly lament) two miles from the towne, to accompliſh certain ceremonies depending vpon the oth which the Kings ought to make in ſuch ſacred

things. In the meane time the Emperour after he had moſt affectionatly  thanked the Ambaſſadours for their aſſiſtance, and had permitted them to depart, he was brought backe to the Caſtle. The Saterday following they made many feaſts; and vpon the Sunday 100. braue gentlemen performed an excellent Tourney. Amongſt theſe (according to the iudgement of the aſſiſtance) the two princes Maximilian and Mathias behaued themſelues valiantly; the one of them fought againſt a Spaniard the ſonne of the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour, and the other againſt a Duke of Poland. At night the Emperour made a moſt rich and ſumptuous ſupper for all the Princes, who all for reuerence of the Emperour were bare headed, except the King and Archduke Charles, who went before the King being placed by the Empereſſe.  Two dayes after they preſented an aſſault giuen againſt a towne made of wood, for defence of which were certaine Knights greatly eſteemed.
            This ſame yeare ended the truce betweene Selim and Maximilian. The The truce betweene Selim and Maximilian expired. Emperour perceiuing no more ſtrength to bee in him, ſuch as before it was, and knowing his ſmall forces, or elſe for ſome other conſideration, Selim ſought to obtayne of him a prolonging of the truce. But Selim not ſo readily condiſcending as Maximilian deſired, the truce in that time expired: and preſently the Turkes of the next garriſons fayled not to put themſelues into the field, and to harrie and aſſaile the frontiers, carying away with  them great ſtore of bootie. Rodolph, with Maximilian his Father, determined to erect a Fort betweene Poſon and Alberegalis, to reſtraine ſuch incurſions. The Turkes well foreſeeing that which might happen by ſuch a building, reſolued not to ſuffer to bee finiſhed before their eyes, a place which ſhould be to them of too great importance, and by the ſame meanes to hinder the deſeignes of Rodolph. For this end hauing amaſſed together their forces, which might amount vnto 20000. men, they ſuddenly aſſayled this Fort in a maner finiſhed: &amp; entering in by force, they killed the garriſon and all the labourers who worked there: and after they had reuerſed all that edifice, they lead with them from thence ſtore of artillerie and other munition of warre. Rodolph ſent to Conſtantinople to complaine to Selim for  ſuch an enterpriſe made by his people daring the time of the treaty of peace, and without there being of either partie any other former declaration of warre, redemaunding that which was taken from him at this Fort. But the aunſwere was a deniall of all that which his Maieſtie demaunded, and to which they added threats if he perſiſted in ſuch demaunds. The Emperour (notwithſtanding his voluntarie yeelding which he had made to his ſonne Rodolph of the Crowne of Hungarie) hauing no leſſe care of this kingdome then he had before, &amp; conſidering how greatly the loſſes which the people receiued by theſe incurſions were damageable, and that by this occaſion,  neceſſitie conſtrayned him to take armes to defend it from the violence of his enemies, and to recouer that which they tooke from him, cauſed to be publiſhed a Diet at Iſpurch, calling thither all the Princes of Germanie; and there propoſing to them the perill imminent to all their nation, and how little they ought to truſt the promiſes of Infidels, exhorted them to take

armes with him for the defence of the whole nation. The Princes moued by his perſwaſions, concluded to vndertake this warre with him, they all  
               Succours granted to the Emperour by the Germanes. iudging that it was more expedient to make open warre, then to remaine alwaies in ſuſpence and doubt. And vpon this concluſion they gaue order for neceſſaries thereto.
            In the meane time Charles King of France a long time vexed with ſuch continuall troubles in his kingdome, or elſe becauſe he had vſed too much The death of Charles King of France. exceſſe in his ordinarie exerciſes, in which too violently he paſſed the time, or elſe by reaſon of ſome poyſon, as ſome ſaid, dyed within a few daies, euen then when his life was moſt neceſarie for France, not leauing after him but one legitimate daughter of him and his wife, named Elizabeth, daughter of  the Emperour Maximilian. Henry his brother King of Polonia being aduertiſed Henry King of Polonia ſtealeth away, and commeth into France. of his death, made preſent inſtance to the Lords of Poland to permit him to goe into France to take poſſeſſion of ſo great a kingdome, and to ſet things in order there, promiſing them to returne againe within few moneths. The Pollacques would not willingly graunt to him that which he demaunded: neuertheleſſe they aunſwered him that they would conſent thereunto, if ſo be that for that effect a Diet ſhould be aſſembled, without which they could graunt him nothing. In the meane time his Maieſtie gaue order to locke vp his beſt implements and Iewels, and to depart ſecretly with all ſpeed: and after he had ſent away before the Ambaſſadour of  France, vnder coulour that his authoritie was expired by the deceaſe of his Maſter, and ſeeing that to attend any longer the reſolution of this Diet (which the Pollacques delayed from day to day of purpoſe to detaine him) and being reſolued to depart, he cauſed to be written in his name by the Lord of Pibrac a letter in Latin to the Senat of Poland, by which his Maieſtie aduertiſed them, that the occaſion more then apparant, and the neede of France forced him to depart from their kingdome ſooner then hee thought for, without further expecting the iſſue of the Diet, he being ſolicited by meſſengers vpon meſſengers to doe it by the Princes and Lords of France, and eſpecially by the Queene his Mother, without further expecting  the iſſue of the Diet. Hauing left theſe letters vpon his table, and as the ſaid Lord of Pibrac had ended them, his Maieſtie departed in the night from Cracouia out at a ſecret poſterne, of which he vſually had the keyes to goe on hunting: and being mounted on horſebacke, he made ſo good ſpeed, that within a ſhort time he was out of the limits of the kingdome of Poland: and being come to the confines of the Emperours territories, he was receiued by his Emperiall Maieſtie, and by his children with all demonſtration of great amitie, and by them conducted to Vienna, where he was honored and vſed with all manner of honorable reſpects. From thence hee went to Venice, where the Seigniorie prouided for him a magnificent enterie. After that he paſſed by Ferrara, Mantua, and Turin, being  greatly entertayned by the Princes of Italie. An Ambaſſadour of Poland met him at Ferrara, who greatly complayned himſelfe of his Maieſtie, and proteſted that if hee returned not within a ſhort time, the Polonians were reſolued to make choiſe of a new King, for that this kingdome could not

remaine without the preſence of a King. His Maieſtie deſired him to ſtay  this reſolution, promiſing him to returne within a ſhort time. From Turin within few daies he arriued in France, at the ſame time that the Hungars giuing order to their affayres, and fortifying their frontier places againſt the Turkes, prepared for the warre: and this they did ſo much the more willingly, for that they already ſaw amongſt them many diſorders, and that in Tranſiluania there was declared King (by the commaund of the Turke) Stephen Battor, a man of great experience, of whom they had ſome feare, and not without cauſe. Vpon ſuch diſtruſts and with ſuch preparations they began both of the one part &amp; other greatly to be indamaged. But during ſuch feares as the Hungars had, by reaſon of the Turke, he alreadie preparing to deſtroy  all Chriſtians, and feeling himſelfe marueilouſly puffed vp with glorie, by reaſon of the happie ſucceſſes which betided him in Africa: and thinking to take away from the Venecians the Ile of Candie, as he had done that of Cypreſſe, he dyed within few daies after. He was a Prince aboue all other The death of Selim. of his time greatly periurious, barbarous, and wholly fraughted with treacherie, he being not come to this Empire but by deceits and falſehoods, hauing induced his father to cauſe all his brethren to be maſſacred, as it was afterwards auerred: and hauing thus filled his houſe with homicides and murthers, he obſerued not any law or religion, but was drowned in all filthie and vilanous vices whatſoeuer. This death happened then when the Polonians  (ſeeing that their King Henry was peaceably poſſeſſed of the Crowne of France, and that the time by him prefixed, was expired many moneths alreadie paſt) began to treate of the election of another King. Henry being aduertiſed of their intention, deſired the Electors and Barons of the kingdome that they would attend vntill a certaine time, in which ſpace he promiſed to returne to them, or elſe that hee would ſend them full commiſſion to chuſe another, ſuch as they would think to be more commodious for them. To this requeſt (being ioyned the threats of Amurath the Turke) the Polonians contented themſelues to ſtay vntill the prefixed time. This paſſed, and at the laſt expired, the Diet was appointed at Cracouia. 
            
            The Emperour Maximilian after that he was aduertiſed that the intention of the Polonians was not to remaine without the preſence of a King, began to negotiate with them to cauſe himſelfe to bee choſen King amongſt them. On the other ſide, Amurath (who ſucceeded Selim) hauing vnderſtood Amurath the ſonne of Selim ſoliciteth the Polonians to chuſe Battor for their King. the ſuites which the Emperour made, ſent to the Pollacques, and aduiſed them to doe nothing in that affayre which was diſliking to him, and that he would they ſhould chuſe for their King one amongſt them, or elſe Stephen Battor King of Tranſiluania. And the more to aſtoniſh this negotiation of Maximilian, he writ vnto him by a Chiauſs, that he and his brothers the Archdukes ſhould pay him tribute of all whatſoeuer they poſſeſſed, otherwiſe  that he would march into Hungarie and Auſtria with a puiſſant armie to put all to fire &amp; ſword; threatning him in the end, that if for him or any of his he ſhuld practiſe the getting of the kingdom of Polonia, he would make him repent it. Notwithſtanding theſe threats, the Emperour (by meanes of thoſe who were of his partie) was choſen K. of Poland, againſt the King of Maximilian choſen King of Polonia.
               
Tranſiluania and Duke of Muſcouia, which two perceiuing themſelues  greatly diſdained, determined to endamage with all their forces that kingdome. Maximilian being aduertiſed thereof, and foreſeeing that he ſhould draw vpon himſelfe ſo many and ſo puiſſant enemies, and conſidering that he had not ſufficient forces to oppoſe himſelfe againſt them, and eſpecially againſt the Turk (who prepared to thruſt himſelfe into Poland, being offended with this, that the Polonians had ſo ſlightly regarded his aduertiſements and meſſengers) fearing to trouble himſelfe in a warre too daungerous for him and his, from whence very hardly he could vntangle himſelfe, made no great ſhew of reioycing at this election: but laying aſide the care which he ought to haue had of it, fained as though he knew nothing thereof, prolonging  by that meanes the taking poſſeſſion of that kingdom, vnder a hope that after the firſt aſſaults of theſe Princes there would not thereby happen to him in the end any other thing. Neuertheleſſe the Polonians fearing the puiſſance of the Turke, who prepared himſelfe to armes, would not perſiſt in this election, vſing for their excuſe the long delay which Maximilian made. Thus the Biſhop of Cracouia, many Poliſh and Lituanian Lords fearing the Turke, and other Princes their neighbours, made choiſe of Stephen Battor for their King, hoping by this election to appeaſe the Turke, the Muſcouite, and other Princes, who hated the greatnes of the Auſtrian houſe: Battor choſen King of Polonia. and on the other ſide this Battor was a Prince of great valour. To this new  election Albert Lasky Palatin would neuer conſent, nor performe the homage which he ought to this new King, and chuſing rather to abandon his countrie and goods, he retired out of the kingdome, with all thoſe who fauoured the Emperiall partie.
            Now Battor knowing that he was choſen, went from thence preſently into Battor receiued into Poland. to Polonia, and after he was crowned, he ſent into diuers Prouinces to notifie his election, and namely to the Emperour Maximilian, ſending him word that if in former time he had been to him a friend, and fauoured his actions, that for the time to come he would yet honour him more, and that he would reſpect him both as a friend and Emperour, and that he ſhould not take diſpleaſure  that this Crowne was fallen into his hands, who had beene alwaies fauourable vnto him, deſiring that ſince through the diſſentions of the Barons and Electors of Poland, and by ſome wicked ſolicitations of ſome Princes (who enuied the greatnes of the houſe of Auſtria, and who by diuers meanes had hindered his election) he would bee contented that this kingdome was come to ſuch a perſon as reuerenced his Maieſtie, and greatly loued him, and ſpecially conſidering that this laſt election would bee the cauſe to quench many troubles, which might be an occaſion to ouerthrow the Eſtate of that kingdome.
            
               Maximilian (for all theſe goodly reaſons and kinde offers) would not be appeaſed: but entering into choller, made ſufficient apparance that this election  greatly diſpleaſed him: adding, that he would make the Polonians repent it. Vpon this diſpleaſure, the Muſcouit and Denmarke being ioyned The King of Denmark and the Mulcouit make warre in Polonia. together, with certaine of the Emperours forces, greatly endamaged by ſea the riuers of Liuonia, and hauing ſet foote on land at Pleſcouia, ranne very

farre into the countrie. Battor notwithſtanding being receiued and crowned  King of Poland, cauſed to be publiſhed a Decree, by which he permitted all thoſe who were retired forth of the kingdome for fauouring the Emperours part, to returne home to the ſame Eſtates, dignities, and prerogatiues which before they had: and if in caſe they would not returne and ſweare ſuch oth of fealtie to him as they ought, they ſhould be proclaimed rebels to his Maieſtie, and enemies to the Crowne.
            In this time of the election of Battor, the Emperour appointed a Diet at Ratisbone, to aduiſe of meanes by which they might hinder that his people ſhould not be thus daily expoſed to the mercie of the common enemie, who continually moleſted Hungarie. Afterwards his Maieſtie demonſtrated to Maximilian demaundeth aide of the Germanes to make warre vpon the Polonians. 
                the Princes who were preſent therein, and to the Ambaſſadours of them who were abſent, that he was choſen King of Polonia, and that by that meanes Liuonia and Ruſſia were fallen vnder the Empire, and that the Polonians for feare of the Turke had varied in their election, and afterwards choſen another, whereof he was exceeding heauie: further declaring to them that his intention was not to bee ſilent therein: and for this cauſe deſired them to aſſiſt him, to the end that by meanes thereof he might preſerue theſe two great countries to the Empire. And that he might the better obtaine their forces, he exhorted them all to maintaine themſelues in peace one with another, commaunding them that for the time to come they ſhould not any  more ſuffer their ſubiects to goe and ſerue ſtraungers in their wars. This Diet Succours granted to Maximilian. was transferred to Ausbourg, in which he did ſo much, that the ordinarie ſuccours for warre was continued to him. The Bohemians offered him beſides the ordinarie, 1500. horſe; and the Hungars 300. Piſtoliers, and 400. Harquebuziers on horſebacke: and the Sleſians 600. horſe, 100. Piſtoliers, and 800. Harquebuziers on horſebacke. To theſe ſuccours, offered themſelues the King of Denmarke, the Duke of Saxonie, Pomerania, and of Brandeburg. And in the end there was concluded a league betweene the Emperour, the Kings of Denmarke and Swethland, the Duke of Saxonie, A league againſt the Polonians. the Duke of Muſcouia, and the Dukes of Brandebourg and Pomerania, for defence of the Empire, and inuading of Polonia, all theſe complaining for  the election of Battor, who, that he might aſpire to the Crowne of Poland againſt them all, had preſumed ſo much vnder the protection of the Turke. Beſides, they feared that he in regarde of the bond which he had to Amurath, would take armes againſt the Emperour: who not content with this Maximilian ſent to ſolicit the Sophy againſt Amurath. league, ſent as well in his name, as in the name of the King of Spaine, his Ambaſſadours into Perſia, to excite the Sophy King of Perſia, to make war vpon the Turke. This word King is called in the Perſian language Scach, and the Turkes ſurname it Sophy, which we commonly thinke to proceede of this Greeke word Sophia, which ſignifieth wiſdome, which in the  Turkiſh language ſignifieth wooll. And the Turkes vſed this ſcoffe againſt Iſmael heretofore King of Perſia, for that he following his opinion or hereſie, would teach that he muſt couer his head with wooll, becauſe it was more vile and baſe then linnen, whereof the Turkes make their Turbans. Battor hauing diſcouered the voyage of theſe Ambaſſadours, cauſed them to be

ſurpriſed in their iourney, and to be maſſacred: and ſent to Amurath their  letters of credence and inſtructions, by which there were diſcouered vnto him the diſeignes of his enemies: which being reported to the Emperour, he was greatly diſpleaſed thereat, and cauſed the Ambaſſadours of Battor to be areſted, and many other Pollacques who then were in Germanie and at Vienna: and ſent to all the chriſtian Princes to require ayde of them, ſeeing the Proteſtants of Germanie denied him ſuch ayde as the imminent perill required, for that his Maieſtie would not condiſcend to the demaunds which they made to him for the affayres of Religion.
            In this Diet notwithſtanding the reclamation and hinderance of ſome Electors of the Empire, his Maieſtie cauſed to be declared his ſonne Rodolph 
                
               Rodolph the ſonne of Maximilian declared King of the Romans. Emperour after him, and cauſed to be impoſed vpon him the title of King of the Romans. This was then when the Muſcouite Ambaſſadours arriued at the Court to confirme the league made with his Emperiall Maieſtie, their maſter being greatly incenſed againſt the Polonians, for that he was by them thus diſdained. Theſe hauing preſented to the Emperour many goodly preſents, offered in their maſters name to his Maieſtie, all his abilitie to ſubdue Polonia. Maximilian accepting theſe offers, thanked the Ambaſſadours for the good affection of their Prince, reſeruing power to vſe his ayde vntill time ſhould require it.
            Whileſt he was in prouiding for all that which concerned the eſtate of the next warre, (his Maieſtie being ſuddainly taken with a vehement trembling  
               The death of Maximilian. of his members, and with a great panting of his heart) he ended his dayes. He was a Prince who well knew to preſerue his Emperiall dignitie and the greatnes of his houſe. Hauing receiued the adminiſtration of the Empire, his father liuing, the care which he alwaies had in his minde, was to keepe Germanie in peace, and in ſuch ſort to effect it, that it ſhould not any more feele the former calamities whereinto it was fallen. For this cauſe ſome ſeeing Germanie in ſo great repoſe, had a ſiniſter opinion of him, as though he had too much fauored the Proteſtants. But theſe men did not conſider that amongſt ſo many diuiſions and hazards as were alreadie in France, Flaunders, &amp; other countries, it was not profitable for the Catholike partie to adde Germanie thereto, for feare leaſt the reſt of the Catholikes might not be in  like perill. This Prince in his young yeares was very hot of the warre. He greatly loued the profeſſours of the liberall arts, and eſpecially handicrafts men. Hee had a delight to pleaſe euery one. Hee ſpoke moſt familiarly many and diuers ſorts of languages, ſo that it ſeemed he was borne with them: and although he had a ſubtile and fine wit, oftentimes hauing an intention contrarie to his actions, yet neuertheleſſe he was indued with many other vertuous qualities.
            To this man ſucceeded in the Emperiall dignitie, Rodolph ſecond of that name his ſonne, King of Bohemia and Hungarie, a moſt Catholike and religious  Prince. He in the ſame Diet of Ausburg in which he was choſen King of the Romans was receiued for Emperour whileſt that the Diet continued. Rodolph receiued Emperour. Preſently his Maieſtie commaunded (the better to take away all hopes of change from all his ſubiects in his hereditarie eſtates) that they ſhould liue

Catholikely: and cauſed to be made ſeuere executions againſt thoſe who  would vndertake to preach any other doctrine but Catholike, and by his example &amp; ſpeeches perſwaded all the Princes, Catholikes and Proteſtants, carefully to obſerue Gods commaundements. So ſoone as he was proclaimed Emperour, he cauſed the Poliſh Ambaſſadours to be releaſed, and ſent to Amurath to demaund truce, which without any great difficultie was accorded Truce betweene Amurath and Rodolph. to him; becauſe that the Turke hauing had aduertiſement of the war which the King of Perſia prepared againſt him, and of the reſolution of the Germanes, who had made a great leauie of ſouldiers and money vpon euery eſtate of the Empire, to maintaine warre againſt him, could not any whit aſſure himſelfe to be able to make reſiſtance in ſo many places, his Empire elſewhere  being ſorely weakened by the iuſt puniſhment of God, with plague, war, and famine: in regard of which, he very eaſily granted the demaunds of Rodolph. At the ſame time all the Chriſtian Princes ſent to his Maieſtie to congratulate with him his new promotion in the Emperiall dignitie: and amongſt others, Battor not long before choſen King of Poland alſo ſent his Ambaſſadours thither for the ſame effect, knowing the releaſe that Rodolph had made of his Ambaſſadours while he beſieged the rich town of Danzit, ſituated at the mouth of Viſtula vpon the ſea of Pruſia, being of the demains Danzit beſieged by Battor. of Polonia, which then held of Maximilians part, the inhabitants then knowing nothing of his death: but as ſoone as they were aſſured thereof, they capitulated with their new King and yeelded to him vnder condition, that the  towne ſhould not be ſpoyled, and that the penaltie ſhould be conuerted into monie. They beſides gaue him 12. peeces of great Artillerie with other leſſer, and certaine amongſt themſelues for hoſtages, to the end the more to aſſure his Maieſtie of their fidellitie towards him. This done Battor preſently cauſed his Armie to make head againſt the Muſcouit, to recouer the places that the Duke had taken towards Liuonia.
            During this buſines he omitted not to ſend to the Pope to acknowledge him as ſoueraigne Prelat of the catholike Church: and by the ſame meanes Battor ſent to acknowledge the Pope, and to ſeeke for learned men in Italie. ſought through Italie for many Captaines of valour, and other men of knowledge, offering them great penſions and rich recompences, as he manifeſted  to many, who both of one and other vocation went to him: this Prince being as much giuen to armes as hee was indued with the knowledg of learning and ſciences, and eſpecially in diuinitie and hiſtories, hauing paſſed his youth in the exerciſe of armes and learning in Germanie and Italie. Within a ſhort time hee recouered all that which the Muſcouits and Tartars had vſurped vpon him; and tooke many places from them, hauing Battor bringeth the Muſcouits and Tartars to require peace. ſo many times beaten them, that he conſtrayned them in the end to ſeeke peace of him, euen as Demetrius Duke of Muſcouia for this effect ſolicited thereto Pope Gregorie the 13. of that name, vſing him as a meane to this Prince, to the end that he might obtaine it. 
            
            The Hungars for all this were neuer a whit the more at reſt. For notwithſtanding the truce, Amurath (as theſe Princes are barberous, proud, &amp; couetous) cauſed to be ſtayed at Conſtantinople the Emperours Ambaſſadour, who at his new arriuall brought not to him the accuſtomed Preſent. Rodolph
               
willing to reuenge himſelf of this iniurie, commanded his people who were  in Hungarie, to make incurſions vpon the Turkes, and to enterpriſe ſome thing vpon ſome of their places in ſtead of two Forts that theſe had taken in Croatia. The Hungars deſirous to attempt ſomewhat vpon certaine Caſtles by Alberegalis, were in the way intrapped by the Turkes, and moſt of them cut in peeces. The Emperour conſidering that theſe skirmiſhes might in the end ingender a greater war, cauſed a Diet to be called in Bohemia, ſoliciting therein the Bohemians that they would ſuccour him againſt the Turkes, who, without regard of the truce, ran &amp; ſpoyled continually the frontiers of his countries. Theſe accorded to him a good ſumme of monie. For the ſame effect he alſo called the Hungars to Poſon, and not being able to be therein, for his indiſpoſition, he ſhewed to them by the Prince Erneſtus his brother,  the neceſſitie which conſtrayned him to ſolicite them to haue regard to the common defence againſt the Turkes, by whom daylie they receiued ſo many oppreſſions. But his Maieſtie could then draw nothing from them at that time, minding that he himſelfe ſhould be in perſon at the Diet and warre. In the end notwithſtanding they daylie perceiuing the effects of the violence of their enemies (who notwithſtanding the warre of Perſia, in which Amurath was greatly combered, ceaſed not neuertheleſſe greatly to moleſt them, and procured them much trouble) graunted to the Emperour the greateſt part of his demaunds, and they all taking courage oppoſed themſelues ſo valiantly againſt the Turkes, that many times they conſtrayned them to retire from them, and euen to forſake a great part of the Countrie which they  vſurped. Rodolph notwithſtanding ſo happie ſucceſſe of his people, ceaſed not to ſend to Amurath to complaine of the great timeritie of the Turkes, who had not any reſpect to the truce concluded betweene them two. Amurath ſeeing himſelfe to be greatly combered with the Perſian, accorded with Rodolph, that of the one and other partie Truce confirmed betweene the Emperour and Amurath. ſhould be deputed ſundrie perſons to take counſell how they might pacifie thoſe differences which might ariſe betweene them vpon their frontiers, touching the extention of their bounds.
