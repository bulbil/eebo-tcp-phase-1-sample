            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            ¶ Imprinted at London, nigh vnto the three Cranes in the Vintree, for Andrew Maunsell, dwelling in Pauies Church-yard at the signe of the Paret. Anno Domine. 1577.
         
         
            
            To the most reuerend Fathers in Christ, Edmond by the permission of almightie God, Archbyshop of Canterburie. &amp;c. and Iohn Byshop of London, Thomas Rogers wisheth the true felicitie of this lyfe, and eternall happines by the comming of Christ.
            
               IT was the saying of Cambyses, (reuerend, and in Christ most honorable fathers) that Cities would floorish wel in prosperitie, if the inhabiters of them were watchful, and still imagined their enemis to be at hād. That which he said for the prosperous estate of a commō weale,Matth. 14.25. Mark. 13. Luk. 21. dyd our Sauiour saye, for the happye successe of all Christians. And both tende to shewe, that, whether wee respect the safetie of our bodyes here on this earth, or the saluation of our soules in the kingdome of Christ, wee may not be in our callings either idle, carelesse, or secure. But yet, such is our nature, wee rather obey the woordes of Cambyses, for temporall prosperitie, than the warnyng of Christe, for eternall happynesse. W
                  •
               ereby it comes to passe, that we haue commonly

fayre bodyes, but deformed soules: much goodes, but litle goodnes: and glorious wee seeme in the sight of men outwardly, but odious inwardly in the eyes of God. For it is harde to finde a man (saith Aristotle,
               Aristot lib. 2. Rhetor. ad Theodecten. cap. 10.) which in prosperitie is not proude, disdainful, and arrogant, of which sort are they, whom strength, whom riches, whō clientes, whō authoritie, whō fauour of mē hath exalted. And so inioying their harts desire, they are of this mynd, that no aduersitie cā hurt them. And what is that, but as Dauid said, The vngodly hath saide in his hart, tushe,Psalm. 10. I shall neuer be caste downe, there shall no harme happen vnto me. But the fayrest Oke is soonest cut down: the fattest Oxe is readyest for slaughter:Prouerb. 1. and the felicitie of fooles, is their owne destruction. For how sodainely doo they consume, vanishe,Psalm. 73. and come to fearefull ende: yea, euen as a dreame are they, when one awaketh.
            As our Sauiour thought the doctrine against securitie, most profitable for his Disciples, and all mankynde: So hath his faythfull seruant the Author of this booke, supposed the same moste necessarye to bee spoken of, in these miserable dayes. And this was the cause and ende wherefore this Treatise was first written, namely, that by reciting the signes and tokens of dangers imminent, and of the worlds destruction, he might draw the wicked from securitie, and driue them to a care of godlynesse and vertue. A godly,

zealous, and learned woorke, and gratefull, no doubt, to all good men. Hippocrates forewarned the Grecians of a greeuous plague, which was nigh at hande, and for his good admonition he was honoured as Hercules, and obeyed as a god. The Athenians for telling them the perils which they were like to fall into,Cardanus de rerum varieta
                     •
                  e. erected to Berosus a goodly Image with a golden tongue. The Grecians to Hippocrates, and the Athenians to Berosus were neuer so bounde, as all Christians to Schelton, for this learned booke. For herein the tokens of the ruine, not of one Citie, as of Athens: nor of one Countrie, as of Greece: but of all the worlde, are set downe. And here may be seene the wayes to preuent the destruction, not of body alone, as were those of Hippocrates and Berosus, but of body and soule from euerlastyng paine in the pyt of hell. So that more cause haue Christians to be thankfull to this author, than were the Athenians and Grecians to both them. Notwithstanding he desireth not (though his deserts be vnspeakeable) to be honoured with the rites of Hercules (suche idolatrie he abhorreth) nor to be kept in memorie with a glorious Image (such memoriall he misliketh) he only craueth that Christiās would weigh what is said, and looke to them selues: he seeketh the saluation of all, not his owne glory. But howe soeuer he be esteemed of others, I trust your Lordships wyll like of this woorke: and so like it, that ye wyll allowe it: and so allowe it,

that yee wyll both against the euyll woordes of the enuious, and the captious tongues of malicious persons, willingly protect it. It pleased the Author, to chuse for Patrons, at the first, two noble Earles: but mee thinkes none so meete for defence thereof, being a Spirituall Discourse, as Spirituall men: and because it tendes to the cutting away of securitie, who better Patrons than they, whose office is to be vigilant, whereof they haue their names? And among Bishoppes, who fitter than they, whose authoritie is such, as none may better, and zeale so great, as none wyll sooner seeke, and promote the glorye of God? Wherfore I trust, both because it is diuine, your Lordships wyll vouchsafe: and because it was wel accepted by two worthy men, but yet Temporal, your honours wyll much more willyngly allowe the same, being Spirituall. And that you may doo so, God, for whose glory it was first made, and is nowe translated, put into your myndes.
            
               Your Graces, and Lordships most humble, at commaundement, Thomas Rogers.

                  . 8. and fauours thee with all his hart. And yet it greatly greeues thee that thy glory which thou wishest for, thy comfort, which thou hopest for, and thy King and bridegrome for whom thou so lokest, and longest for, is so long from thee: And no maruel, for it is the property of a faythfull louer, not quietly to beare the absence, but ardently to desire the presence, the pleasaunt speeche, and louing, embracings of her beloued.

And yet most of all it greeues thee to see the shamelesse boldnes of that abhominable strumpet the whore of Babilon, which blusheth not to call her selfe the onely spouse of thy Christ: and to call thee an harlot: to boast of her externall beautie, and to cast in thy teeth thy outward deformitie: to bragge of her antiquitie, fame and glorious estate, and to tell thee of thy noueltie, pouertie, and miserie. Hence it commeth, that thou art no where in quiet from such taunts and chidings, nor thy mēbers any where safe frō her bloodye persecution. Hence it is, that before the world, which is the Sonne of this naughtie houswife, thou art contemned, hated, and afflicted: and she as the Queene of heauen is adored, loued, and aduaunced: with her haue all nations committed fornication, and the Kings of the earth haue become frantike with Idolatrous wyne of her poysoned doctrine. And hence commeth thy deepe sighes, thy mournfull countenaunce, and the intolerable vexation of minde which thou art in. Hence it is that thou canst not be mery. But comfort thy selfe, faint not (thou beloued of Christ) for thy husband for thy sake hath made her naughtines to be knowen,Apoc. 17, and she which was so loued is now hated, and was glorious for her externall fairnes, is nowe become odious to many, for her spiritual filthines. Haue pacience therefore but a little whyle, and thou shalt see her, to be of none accompt: for thy louer in whom thou delightest, shall bring her to such shame, as she shall not be able to showe her head out of hell, when thou shalt be in glorye with thy beloued. Nowe will I make thee priuie, with whom this naughtiepacke (which now is many wayes knowen to all the world) hath had to do a long whyle since, first shee lefte to fauour the, and began to fancie the wicked doctrine of the Gentiles: her baude, &amp; thy sworne enemy.

               andes, and most familiar with him, Iohn in his Reuelation dyd foretell, that immediatly (after he had seene an Angell flying thorowe the midst of heauen, crying with a loude voyce, Woe, Woe, Woe, to the inhabitants of the earthe, from the other voyces of those three Angels, which were yet to sounde, the fift Angell dyd first sounde, and he sawe a starre falling vppon the earth, which was the fall of the Popes holynes, from celestiall, to earthly thinges, and hauing the keyes, not of heauen, nor of Peter, (as he dooth vainely boast) but of the bottomlesse pit, the pit of hell, Which when he had opened there came out great aboundance of Locustes into the earth, and had for their King one whose name was in Hebrue Abaddon, in Greeke Apollyon. To this wicked king did that whoore of Babylon plight her fayth, ioyne her selfe, and altered the name of the Empire, so that at length the flourishing estate of the old Empire vanished, and he became the chiefe among al Christian kings. But what happened afterward? These Locustes, to wit, that infinite and horrible crewe of idle prelates, Priestes, and Friers, with their abhominable king, the Pope of Rome, whom Paule dooth call 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , the sonne of perdition, ascended from hell, and brought with them not the pure doctrine of Gods worde, but the poysoned lessons of diuels, and so by the filthie smoke of false opinions, obscured the Sonne of righteousnes, and infected the wholesome ayre of Christes Gospell. But now would you haue them better described? Forsooth they are for theyr intolerable pride, and threatnings, lyke vnto horses, prepared to the battaile, womens heare they haue, because they are in dealinges light, in behauior wanton: Lions teeth, for their crueltie, shieldes as it were of iron, to note their obstinacie▪ In wordes they seemed courteous, and therefore they

had the faces of men, but in deede they prooued villanous, and therefore they had in their tailes the sting of Scorpions. These made a noyse as it were of manye winges, which noted the fame of the Popes holinesse. And these had power to hurt, and yet not all thinges, but onely men, and yet not all men, but those which had not the marke of God in their foreheads. And yet they could not plague at their pleasure, but in certaine monthes: and those not in Winter, but in Somer. So thou seest O daughter of Siō pure, &amp; vnspotted Virgin, to whom this vile st

            Now marke I beseech thee, and call into mynde the woordes of thy beloued, which gaue his Apostles to vnderstand, that before his comming (meaning before he celebrates his marriage in the kingdome of his almighty father) the sounde of the Gospell as it were by a Trumpet,Matth. 24. should be heard throughout all the world, that so, both the number of thy friendes might be greatly multiplyed &amp;, this child of perdition by the final end of al thing

Which things to thy comfort thou mayst perceaue to be com to passe already euen about the sixt houre or midle of of the sixt day, or six thousand yeare of the worldes creation. Thou seest how the voyce of the Gospell hath sounded in al quarters of the world, thou seest how that son of perditiō with the whore of Babylon sitting vpō a purpled and bloodye beast, is by the breath of Gods woorde confounded: thou seest also (which is most to thy glory, and their perpetuall prayse) how the Kings of the

earth (which were sometime the tenne hornes and vpholders of that beast, by whom shee receyued both such aucthoritie that shee myght persecute, and such titles, that shee was honored as a Goddesse, and reuerenced as the Queene of heauen) thou seest I say, whom they did honour as a Queene, how they doo hate for a Queane: and whom they did reuerence like a Goddesse, how they renounce as the greatest enemye to godlines: and whom they did by an ignorant zeale enrich with all things that myght cause her to be in the eyes of all mē glorious, how they worthily impouerish, &amp; endeuour by all meanes to make her odious. So that the number is great which know, &amp; confesse thee to be the true and faythfull spouse of Christ. Which, God graunt as they in mouthes confesse to fauour thee, so in manners they may expresse Christianitie, and as they speake well, so at no tyme they may be seduced either by the vayne pleasures of this world, or by suttle snares of the diuel frō louing thee.

Wherefore of these may certaynly be gathered that none of them beleeue eyther the sweete promises of God, or seuere and horrible threates, which stubbornly resist his commau

               dements, and do not obey them. For it cannot be that either beleeuers should lyue after the flesh,
                  Rom. 8. Luc. 16. or lyuers after the flesh, should be beleeuers: because, not beleeuers, but lyuers after the flesh, shall dye. And of this we haue a manifest example in that rich man, crauyng of Abraham, that he would send Lazarus to his fiue brethren, to warne them, least they came into that place of torment. By which no doubt he would signifie, that they would more esteeme the aucthoritie of Lazarus commyng from the dead, then Moses and the Prophetes. And therefore what marueyle if he contemned charitie, when he cared not for faith? That when he flowed with such abundance of all things, yet nothing at all fauoured poore Lazarus lying miserably before hym? And therfore, because he was without fayth and charitie, beyng departed from this world, was cast headlong into hell. And as this vnbeliefe is the very spring of sinne, and of all vngratiousnes the gulfe, in which, all vnregenerated

are drowned: so contrarywise, true and Christian fayth (by which we haue a sure trust to Gods mercy, and free remission of our sinnes, promised to vs through the merites of Christ the sonne of God) is the liuely fountaine in Christ, by the helpe of the holy ghost, of loue both of God and our neighbour: and it is (at one woorde) the cause of all spiritual good, which follow her as necessarily (as heate doth fire.) Because it is meete (if beleeuers liue after the spirite) that the holy ghost stirre in them like motions, to hym selfe. But yet alas, great infirmitie and weakenesse is in the faithfull, although regenerate, so that not seldome they stande in doubt of Gods promises, and therefore haue great neede of proppes, to keepe them from falling: for we are more delighted with apparant and present things, than with future and inuisible. For naturally those things which are obiect vnto vs, doo more moue our senses,
                  Hebr. 11. than those which are of faith, which is the substance of things to be hoped for, an argument of things not appearing, whose litle sparke sometyme appeareth in vs, and is much to be raised by the woord of God, that it may the more increase, and quicken our dead members with the heate of the holy Ghost. Also in our greatest temptations, and most cruell persecution, the Diuell, togeather with our vile fleshe, bring great doubts into our myndes, of the promises of God, especially when we behold the vngodly to liue in this world in al pleasure to their hartes desire, ioyfully: which thing that kingly Prophet Dauid in his Psalmes dooth at large and plainly teach vs.
                  Psal. 73▪
                And therefore the miseries of this lyfe are the more easily borne, when we doo as it were behold the ende of them before our eyes. Of which it commeth, that to the godly (truely thinking them selues to wander in this world, not to liue in their owne countrey) the remembraunce of these euylles is pleasant, and is a great comfort in all miseries, to thinke by death, in that last commyng of Christ, at the length that they shall haue a most free entrance into that celestial Hierusalem, sweete, and eternall Countrey, of which, in a most assured hope by fayth, they knowe them selues citizens.
            
               Wherfore I haue thought it very expedient, by certaine arguments, to set against all infidelitie, the doctrine of the Prophetes and Apostles, concernyng the last commyng of Christ to the vniuersall iudgemēt, before which, in the ruine of this wretched world, shall in a moment appeare the resurrection of the flesh, and a sodaine change of all men liuyng. So that all mistrust and vnbeliefe, the Quagmyre of all maner of wickednesse (in which many men lye t

               ised, our hope of attaynyng an happy life, and deliuerance from all troubles, may be nourished, and we the more vigilant, least vpon a sodaine that great day of the Lord (horrible to the vngodly, but to the godly comfortable) vnawares oppresse vs, and the spouse find vs sober, wise, and prepared to the feast, not without oyle in our Lampes. For his commyng in this last age of the world, without doubt is not farre, and maketh great hast, and wyll not (as many suppose) linger.
            Wherfore, in this litle woorke, I haue determined by some euident places of the Scripture,
                  The argument of the booke.
                first to proue, that there shal be one day a generall destruction of this world and an vniuersall and last iudgement of our Lord Iesus Christ the sonne of God, in which all the promises of God shall to the vttermost be fulfilled, and his great threates shall take effect. Then by the testimonies of holy Scripture we wil shew, that the age of this world shall not be more then sixe thousand yeres: &amp; that the sixt thousand (in which we now liue, whose tyme is more than halfe past) because of intollerable wickednesse, and shamelesse securitie of men, shall not be fully finished. And to this shalbe added certaine singuler signes by course of tyme, and yeares woonderfully agreeing with the inclinations of the Starres, (if credit may be geuen to Mathematicians) which things notwithstāding I referre to the iudgement of the Church, and doctors of more discretiō. Last of al, certain proofes out of Scripture shalbe brought of the maner of Christ his commyng, and of the effect of the last iudgement: with an exhortation to watchfulnesse, for that most ioyful commyng of our bridegrome.
         
      
      
         
            
            ¶That there shalbe a destruction of this worlde, a resurrection of the fleshe, and a generall iudgement of all mankynde.
            
               ESpecialy (setting apart al other darke significations of the world, which in holy Scripture are to be founde euerye where) in this place talkyng of his destruction, we take the same (as Aristotle dooth in his booke of the World) for a knittyng togeather of celestiall and inferiour bodyes disposed by Arte, which dooth containe liuing creatures, and all other things which are ingendred and remaine in euery part. And because in the same is to be seene a wonderfull shewe, therfore doo the Latines very well take his denomination from fayrenes, so that they cal the world, as the Grecians doo, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , a goodly shew, or ornament, from the perfect excellencie therof, as Plinie writeth: which woonderful peece of woorke (as appeareth by the manner of his creation, and holy Scripture dooth plainly and sufficiently auouch the same) was only to that ende buylded, that it should be a house or dwelling place for mankinde. For when our most mighty and eternall God by his woord of power, had created of nothing, all things, as wel senslesse, as hauyng life, at length he made Adam, whom he appoynted Lord of al creatures, and possessor of Paradise, situated in the mydst of this goodly

and glorious world: and fashioned him also vpright, and innocent (according to his owne likenesse) that the Lord God of him might worthely be worshipped. Here the vnspeakeable loue of God towards mankind is most diligently to be considered. For if the Lorde God for our sakes h
                  •
               th erected this famous and excellent peece of woorke, to be an abiding place for mankynd, of which he would gather to hym selfe a perpetual Church: howe fayre and glorious shal we thinke that euerlasting Temple to be, which he hath prepared for his elect in Christ, and for his heauenly and celestial warriours? In which place we shall enioy the sight of our euerlasting God, and shal knowe hym in maiestie and glory euen as he is. Truely no comparison of excellencie betwene these can so much as in imagination be conceyued, although the beautie of this world and vniuersitie be such, as mans wit cannot sufficiently thinke of the same. Because as betwene the creature and the creator there is no equality, so great is the oddes betweene visible things created, and supercelestiall to vs altogether inuisible, where the sonne of God wyth all Sainctes, in the circuite of all Angels with God the father hath his eternall seate and continuall abiding. But all men through the fall of Adam are become vnworthy of that place which was appoynted for Adam being pure from sinne and vnspotted. Neither had the world any more borne him according to this immutable sentēce of God (at what tyme thou shalt eate of the tree of k

And therfore if the world haue hitherto, and as yet shall continue, it is onely done for

their sakes which are chosen in Christ: whose number being full, the world must of necessitie fayle, and fall downe flat: for which cause the Lord hath a certayne tyme of the worlds destruction: because by the sinne and wickednes of vngodly men being marueilously polluted, and accursed, it dooth together wyth all other creatures (as Saynt Paule sayth) subiect to the same corruption, desire a deliuerance from euil.Rom. 8. And therefore that this vniuersall world maye be brought to his former integritie, it must of necessitie be consumed, and burne with fyre in the comming of the Lord, as Esay witnesseth, saying: Beholde,
               Esay. 66. 
               the Lorde wyll come in fire, and his chariot shalbe like a whyrlewynde, that he may render his indignation in heate, and his correction in flames of fire: because the Lord wyll iudge in fire. And S. Peter saith: The day of the Lord wyll come like a thiefe,

Yes vndoubtedly: so that he shall put all kingdomes of this world vnder hys feete, and shall hewe them lyke a stone, which is cut from the mountaine. He appeared vnto King Nabuchodonozor without handes to bruse that great Image which offred it selfe vnto the King in his sleepe:Daniel. 2. vnder which according to the interpretation of Daniell, were fygured all the Empyres of the worlde.Daniel. 7. And the same heauenly Prophet by the same spirit dyd foretell that God would rayse vp an euerlasting, and perpetuall kingdome, which all the Sainctes of God after iudgement shall possesse world without ende. Nowe what let is there? Why by lyke certayntie those things shall not be fulfilled which haue been spoken afore, of the destruction

of this world, and eternall gouernment of Christ. Sith that kingdome is perpetuall, and not to be ouerthrowen, prepared for the Sainctes of God from euerlasting, as fayth and Christian Religion do confirme. And from the same spirit of truth are these things vttered: Gods prouidence also is certaine.

Where of those things none except either a mad man, or possessed with some wicked spirit, can raise any doubt.

               hed, and with all miseries ouerwhelmed: but the wicked are with delicious fare nourished, with goods enriched, with offices preferred, and for aucthotitie honored. As Dauid in these woordes dooth bitterly complayne: My feete were almost gone,
               Psal. 73. 
               and my treadings had welnigh slipt. And why? I was greeued at the wicked, when I sawe them in such prosperitie: For they are in no perill of death, but are lustie and stronge: They labour not lyke other men, neyther are they plagued lyke other folke: And therefore pryde compasseth them as dooth a chaine: and they haue put on the garment of crueltie: Their eyes are swollen with fatnesse, and they doo what they lyst: They marre others, and speake marueilously, yea they blasphēe the most hyghest. And a little after. Behold, these vngodly prosper in the worlde, and enriche themselues greatly: and I sayde, then haue I

clensed my hart in vaine, and washed my handes in innocencie: All the day long haue I been punished, &amp; chastened euery morning: yea, and I had almost sayd euen as they: but loe, then should I haue condemned the generation of thy children. And therefore there must of necessitie be another lyfe after this, in which, according to the iuste iudgement of God, euery man must receyue eternall and woorthy recompence for their woorkes be they good or bad: eternall glory, or eternall infamie. Euen as Dauid also in the same Psalme to the comforting of himselfe and the Church, telleth vs in these woordes: Then thought I to vnderstand this, but it was too harde for me, vntyll I went into the sanctuarie of God, then vnderstoode I the ende of these men. Namely, howe thou hast set them in slipperie places, and wilt make them fal downe into desolation. O how suddainely doo they consume, vanish, and come to a fearefull ende: yea euen as a dreame are they, when one awaketh: Lorde when thou raisest the dead, thou wilt dispise their image. And besides especially it agreeth to the diuine iustice (after all good woorkes, or bad committed in this body) that all bodies knit with their soules, doo rise, and receiue that which they haue deserued.Esay. 66. Which thing Esay most plainly dooth signify in this maner: All fleshe shall come to worship before my face, sayth the Lord: And they shall come foorth, and see the dead bodyes of men, which haue done wickedly against me: there worme shall not dye, and their fire shall not be extinguished, &amp;c.

Then (as Esay writeth) shal death be vtterly deuoured,

And therefore all those things which by the Prophets and Apostles through the instinct of the holy Ghost he hath reuealed touching the end of the world, the Resurrection of the flesh, the last iudgement of Christ, and the eternall lyfe of the godlye, and the eternall death of the wicked which is to come, shall so certainely come, as nothing ought to be more certaine vnto vs, notwithstanding that mans reason, and the doctrine of the Philosophers cannot sufficiently conceaue the same. For if he be truth, how can he lie? Or, sith all which hath been spoken afore of Christes comming in the flesh, of his death, and resurrection, of alteration of Empires, be sufficiently fulfilled: How can we otherwise thinke, but that these things which of the ruine of the world, and of Christes eternall kingdome, reuealed vnto vs of our most mightie and blessed God, must lykewyse come to passe? Especially syth all which hath been spoken, was to no other end spoken, but to proue this: and the summe of Christian religion consistes in these things.
            Which demonstration going before, and true testimonies of holy Scripture, in my iudgement maye suffice both to the strengthening of our faith, and cutting of all doubting of that noble coming of Christ our Lorde to iudgement, of the ende of this sinfull world, of the glorious exhortation of his Church, and of the vtrer damnation of the reprobate. Wherefore now I will endeuour by testimonies of diuine Oracles, probable reasons and coniectures, to shewe that the world cannot passe the time of sixe thousande yeares.

                      12. booke agaynst Mat. and manie moe of antiquitie, together with moste learned men of our tyme, and my masters, excellentlie seene in all things Philip Melancton, and Regner Predin a man of ripe lerning and iudgement, Moderator of Groningane, haue been of this opinion, that that Prophecie of Elias concerning the worlds continuance sixe thousande yeres, is without all doubt true, and to be credited. Notwithstanding that Prophecie is not to be read in the holy scripture, but in the books of the Rabines, as in the firste Chapter, and firste booke Abodazara: also in the fourth part of the Thalmudician work, in the Sanhedrin book, and last Chapter of the same and other places, where that is alledged of the Rabines for the true saying of Elias. The words are these:Elias prophesie. Two thousande vaine, Two thousande the Lawe, Two thousande Christ. And for our sinnes which are manie and marueilous, some yeres which are wanting shall not be expired.
               By which saying the world is notably deuided into three ages, or especiall courses, and doth shewe both whē Christ should come, and how long the state of this

world should continue. Two thousande yeres was the world without any lawes, ordeined expressely by the worde of God, which being finished, Circumcision, and afterward the Lawe was giuen, and a certaine gouernment, and true manner of woorshipping of God, was instituted by the worde of God. But about the middle age of the world, when as three thousande yeeres were past, to wit, in the time of Iosaphat King of Iuda, and Achab King of Israell, did this diuine Prophet vtter this Prophecie, by which he did signifie the true and certaine tyme of Moses gouernmēt, and of the cōming of the Messias or sonne of God, which should manifest himselfe, preach, and be crucified of the Iewes. And he shewed, that almost a thousande yeeres did remaine, before Christ should come and the Gospell begin to be preached: &amp; about two thousād yeres after his cōming, the world should perish and come to nought. Nowe sith according to this Prophecie of Elias, the euent hath proued two thousande yeeres to haue beene past before Circumcision, and manifesting the lawe, and two thousande also to haue passed when Christ came, (for vntill the thirtie yeere of Christes age, at which tyme Iohn did prepare the way to the Lord, and Christ began to accomplish the will of his father, did the fourth thousande continue) it is to be thought vndoubtedly, that nowe in the olde age of the world, the euent will answeare to his prophecie, and that as in the middle, and flourishing state of the world, God carried Elias by a firy chariot into heauen, so in the ende and vanishing tyme thereof, he wil exalt vs with him self into the celestial habitatiō, of which no doubt Elias was a figure cōstituted of god. But (as Elias saith) some yeres shalbe wāting. For the Lord God, because of wickednes, shall hasten his cō
                  ming, so that six thousand yeeres may not fullie be expired. Which prophecie was vttered by Elias, through the

holy ghoste, and is no fiction of the Rabines, as are manye things in those Thalmudician bookes, and may in my iudgement, be cōfirmed by the answeare of Vriel the Angell vnto the demaunds of Esdras, although Hierome, and those which followe him, doubt hereof. But Theodore Bibliander in the explication of Esdras his dreame, doth say,4. Esdras. 4. that Hierome did rather imitate the rashnes of the Iewes, than probable reason.The iudgement of Bibliander concerning the fourth booke of Esdras. And proueth by many moste plaine arguments, this fourth booke to be Esdras owne booke, Prophetical, &amp; diuine: and saith: That marueill it is not though this diuine booke (bycause it moste plainly telleth of the raigne, and cheifest, lawfull, and euerlasting kindome of Iesus Christ, and also of the refusall of the Iewes, and conuersion of the Israelites vnto Christ the Lorde) be despised of the blinded synagog of the Iewes, which do wilfully set themselues against their sauiour: And also addeth that this booke is yet extant in the Hebrue tongue,The answeare of Vriell to Esdras. and was translated out of the same. To this Esdras (demaunding of Vriell the Angell, whether the time past, be greater than the time that is to come, or whether that which is to come, exceede the tyme past?) the Angell doth answeare by two similitudes. And doth shewe vnto him first a burning fornace, and afterwarde, a watrie cloude, and saith, Marke whether the fire do ouercome the smoke, and the showre the drops? or otherwise? To whom Esdras sayth: I see Lord, that a very great smoke doth passe away, I see also a great showre to come powring downe: but afterwarde I perceiue the flame to ouercome the smoke, &amp; the drops the showr. Then saith the Angel. Now iudge of the continuance of the world. Euen as first the smoke vanquished the fire, and the drops the showre: so the yeeres of the tyme past, shall exceede the tyme which is to come. But nowe, according to the computation of yeeres, it is euident that

For euen as God in sixe dayes made all things, and rested the seuenth: so by the ministerie of his worde in this lyfe within the compasse of sixe thousande yeeres he will gather his Church, with which in the seuenth he will celebrate and keepe holy his euerlasting Sabboth. Caspar Peucerus thinkes Orpheus to haue been of this opinion, whose words Plato did thus recite:

               Although in all the sacred scripture there be no place as touching the determination of any certaine tyme, more agreeing with Elias Prophecie, then that answeare of Vriell vnto Esdras: yet will we proue the same to be moste true by things alredie paste, by the state of things present, &amp; other tokens as hereafter in their place orderlie shalbe showen.

                  ing life, his force and sting being lost, he shal vtterly be abolished. To which thing Iudas in his Epistle had respect, which saith, that this Henoch the seuenth after Adam, dyd foretell of the last iudgement. Which iudgement is giuen of Elias,
                  Elias. that he should be a type &amp; figure of his owne prophecie. And it is said, that as Henoch in generation, so Elias in cōputation of yeres, was the seuēth after Adam. For it is reported, that next vnto Adam, was Methusalah: next to Methusalah, Sem: to Sem, Iacob: to Iacob, Amram: to Amram, Ahia: and to Ahia, Elias the Prophet. Now if this accompt of Elias be altogether true (as many do coniecture) there is no doubt but the Lord God, would in his wonderfull woorks declared to his Saintes and chosen, haue many secret mysteries, that in the consideration of them, we might be inflamed with desire of the celestiall and most blessed life. Here let vs cōsider, that before the seuen

               Finallie also the Euangelists and Apostles, call the

tyme from Christes incarnation vntill the ende of the world,1. Peter. 1. the laste howre, or laste tymes. Saint Peter saith: Christ was manifested in the laste tymes. And to the Hebrewes Paule writeth:Heb. 9. Christ once was offred in the ende of the world. Neither is this tyme of the Apostles therfore called the last, bycause that certainly the ende of the world is at hande: but because, according to Elies distribution, it is the laste of the three ages of the world (which without all doubte they respected.) Neither is it to be deemed, that this prophecie was vnknowen to them, but rather that by reuelation of the holy Ghoste, it was singularly renued: and therefore in deede they call this last age of two thousande yeeres, (in the beginning of which all prophecies and visions, by Christ were to be fulfilled) the laste tymes, and howre. These nowe be the testimonies, and coniectures, by which I haue studied to proue, (and haue satisfied my selfe) that this world shall not continue aboue the space of sixe thousande yeeres. Nowe followe those things, by which I meane to shewe, that the sixt thousande yeere shal not be expired.
            
            
               That the world shall not endure sixe thousande yeeres.
               
                  NOwe that the sixt thousand yeere shalbe shortened, it is apparant, and maye be prooued for order sake, firste, by those woordes of Elias the Prophete, aboue recited, in this manner: And for our sinnes which are many, and marueylous, some yeeres which are wanting, shall not be expyred.
                  
VVhich words do not much disagree frō those of Christ, where he saith: And except those dayes were shortned,
                  Math. 24. 
                  all flesh should perish, but for the elects sake, they shall be cut of. And although there peraduenture the Lorde doth properly talke of the ruine, &amp; ouerthrowe of Hierusalem (as may easely be gathered by the circumstances of that place) yet may it seeme, that he would speake the same of the vtter destruction of the world, because in that place he giueth certaine and moste euident signes thereof (of which hereafter more at large) and also dooth foretell both of the ouerthrowe of Hierusalem, and by a certaine confusion of wordes, of the worldes destruction: so that for the perfect vnderstanding thereof, greate iudgement is to be required. And bycause the former is a figure of that which is to followe, I perswade my selfe, that as well by the woordes of Christ, as by the prophecie of Elias, it may be gathered, that for the electes cause, those miserable dayes of the vtter ouerthrowe, and ending of this wicked world shalbe shortened, and cut of.Coniecture from the constitution of the Sabboth. Others by probable reason endeuour to proue the same through consideration of the Sabboth daie, which is a true figure of the eternall Sabboth. For in the Lawe it was prescribed, that about the euening of the sixt day, the Sabboth should take his beginning. And therefore their coniecture is not vnlike to be true, which thinke that the eternal &amp; superexcellēt Sabboth of the Lord shal begin, not at the end of the last thousande yeere, but a litle before.
               Here be some other coniectures brought foorth, which willyngly I passe ouer, and the rather, bycause I know them to be of no great force.The preaching of the Gospell, the chiefest signe of Christs comming to iudgement.
               
               But those tokens are dilgentlie to be marked, which Christ did foretel should goe before the cōsummatiō of the world: that by them we may the more certainly thinke and perswade our selues, (tyme present, and tokens

foretolde being compared together) that the ende of the wo

                     •
                  r signes (in my iudgement) the preaching of the Gospell is not the least, but moste cheefely to be noted, as rhat by which all other tokens both going before, and following, in those wordes of Christ are knowen to bee true tokens of his comming. The wordes of Christ telling vs howe to knowe when the Gospell is preached, are these:Math. 24. And this Gospell of the kingdome shalbe preached through the vniuersall world, for a witnes to all nations, and then shall the ende come. By which words the sonne of God Christ doth playnly teach, that about the time of the worlds destruction, the true doctrine of Christ should be preached. By which is gathered, that the same was obscured, defaced, and almost not spoken of, by reason of false prophets, before that tyme. And Christ saide, that in those dayes should arise many false Prophets, and by saying themselues to be Christ, should seduce many. Nowe what is more euident in these our dayes? Hath not the true and sincere doctrine of the free pardoning our sinnes by Christ, lien hid these many yeeres, and vnder the tyrannie of Antichrist maruelouslie been obscured? And the Pope arrogantlie vaunted himselfe to bee Christ, or at leaste his vicar? What promising of pardoning sinnes, and redeming soules out of their fained purgatorie, by theire wicked Bulies, and blasphemous Masse? what idolatrie in woorshipping, and impietie in receiuing Christ in the sacrament? Finally what diuers and diuilish supe

                  ames ouer all nations. And

therefore what other things shall we looke for, but as Christ did foretel, a sodaine downfall of this wretched world? For if we reade eyther the holy Byble of God, or historicall bookes of prophane men, we shall finde that God hath alwayes followed the example of a ryghteous iudge,God doth first accuse before he condemne. which before he condemne a man for his offences, will first accuse by witnesse: so God, before he send plagues and punishment for our transgression, dooth first put vs in minde of our wickednes by preaching of the Gospell, and declaring his diuine pleasure: that by consideration of our disobedience, we may turne to the Lord by repentance and lyue. First we haue a notable example here in Noes preaching,Gen. 6.7. by which the Lord God dyd first accuse the world of disobedience, before he drowned the same for lacke of repentance. So lykewise he dyd not bring the tenne Tribes of Israell into captiuitie,4. Reg 17. before he had sent Esay, Osee, and other Prophets to call them from iniquitie. The lyke a hundred and foure and thyrty yeeres after happened to the Iewes,4. Reg. 24.25. when by the preaching of Ieremie, Ezechiel, and other Prophets of God, they would not beware of disobeying Gods maiestie. At the length, many ye

But they were so farre from beleeuing them, that theyr preaching they lothed, Iohn they beheaded, Christ was crucified, and the Apostles eyther by shamefull death cruellye murdered, or at least, by ill intreating miserably tormented.I

And hytherto also dooth that doctrine of Paule tende, teaching that the wicked sonne of perdition should be discouered, and by the spirit of the month of God defaced, and afterward, by the glorious comming of the sonne of God, vtterly destroyed. Nowe who is that same desperate sonne sitting in the tēple, as God himself, it is easie to be knowen: and how he by the preaching of the Gospell hath been discouered, experience doth shew: and we hereafter at large will prooue, that he is, and hath of long tyme continued, the Byshop of Rome. Now sith we behold his doctrine, and authoritie by the force of Gods word to be so ouerthrowen, (as they are iudged almost mad mē, which seeme any way to fauour him,) what other thing can follow, but that God is ready to come vpon vs, and standes at our doores? And that not only his hauty courage shalbe abated, and his execrable crueltie altogether abolished, but also that the whole and vniuersall world, for all sinnes committed since the beginning, be accused, &amp; so condemned to eternal tormentes: because wickedly they haue cōtemned the grace of God offred vnto them continually, and wilfully refused to tast the sweetnesse of the Gospel, and forsake their sinnes and wickednesse by repentance.

All which we do not onely see to haue been done, but also to our paine feele them, besides more greeuous things not yet heard of, but more to be feared, and circumstances bring vs to that mynd, to thinke that more intolerable things are prepared to vexe vs, both of Turke and Papist. And that also in the same place (as appeareth) the Lord vnderstoode the last preaching, not the beginnyng of his Gospel, thereof it is euident, because by and by he adioyneth, That the Gospell beginnyng to shine euery where, a visitation shal come, and end of all thyngs. Otherwise, if this place were to be vnderstoode of the first openyng of the Gospel, by the Apostles, no doubt this ende had been come many hundred

yeares agoe. Besides, the Euangelist returneth to the former question of the Temples, and Hierusalems destruction, from whence he digressed. Peraduenture also the Euangelistes haue confounded these two, that not by the same wordes they might finish nowe that, now this particularly: because peraduenture they were of this opinion, that they thought, that after the subuersion of Hierusalem, should immediately follow the destruction of the world: whose ende (as Christ said) should be so sodaine, as nothing coulde be more. But Christ our Lorde coulde of his owne accorde disioyne those things, to make them darke for a tyme, which he would not haue to be knowen, and could make them manifest, when it were for his glory, and our profite, at a tyme conuenient.
               But to make of these tokens foretold of Christ, any long discourse, it were a great labour, and peraduenture tedious to the Reader, because the thing it selfe, and experience do sufficiently proue, these signes after the manifesting of the Gospel, to haue been fulfylled, except onely those in the Sunne, and Moone, and other Starres, as yet haue not appeared, whiche Christe doth tel, should eyther shew them selues a litle before, or in his very comming. The Mathematicians and Astronomers iudgement notwithstanding is, that in many hundred yeeres past, were neuer seene so manye Eclipses in the Sunne and Moone, nor yet so strange copulations of Planets as wyll appeare within fewe yeeres, which no doubt are to threaten vnto vs daungers and miserable dayes, as hereafter shalbe shewed. Here I will not speake of the prodigious Comets, and Meteores, which many tymes haue been marked in this our age. Neyther wyl I call to mynde the iudgement of Astronomers, and chiefest Diuines vpon that Starre, whiche within these three yeares, shewed her

selfe certayne monethes togeather, as the very messenger, and warner of Gods comming to iudgement: and the rather, bicause it seemed to be of the same nature and qualytie wyth that which foretolde the birth of Christ the king of the Iewes, vnto the wysemen. Also I will in silence passe ouer the straunge earthquakes, which in our dayes haue happened in manye places (as of late at Ferraria in Italie) and in Friseland, the nature of which Soyle is left subiect to the same. But (I beseech you) let vs call to our remembraunce, all those euils, which as yet we doo as it were beholde and haue tasted, not heard of, doo see with our eyes, and to our great griefe suffer them continually. What a greeuous pestilence and plague these many yeeres, both with vs and in other places hath reygned, and tyrannically dooth exult ouer all persons, and bring very many to their graues, and according to the iudgment of the learned (which are in opinion that it will and must continue yet moe yeeres) will dispach many moe? What a long dearth of Corne, and great scarsitie of all things? What a multitude in the cause of religion, haue suffred the losse of life and lyuing? What theft and robberyes on al sides, both on sea and land? What an infinite company haue in cruell fight been miserably slayne and murdered in Fraunce, Flaunders, and Friseland?
               
               But I am troubled, and that greatly, to think on and recite the calamities which Frisela

The other chaunced in a more dangerous and woorse tyme, three

dayes before the Feaste of Saint Bartholomewe, in the yeere of our Sauiours incarnation. 1573. the which in many places brought more hurt to many men, than the former, because by the same, all corne on the grounde, and other fruite perished miserablie, by reason whereof, great dearth and penurie ensued. So that in those Coūtries, it might wel be said that those wordes of Christ were fulfilled, saying: The people shalbe at their wittes endes,
                  Luk. 21. 
                  at the roring of the Sea and salt Waters. Wherefore let vs giue credit vnto those words of Christ, and let them be vnto vs for most certayne tokens of the suddayne commyng of our Sauiour to iudgement.
               There are besides these, other signes of the oldnes of the world, and of his ouerthrowe: because we playnlie perceyue al things dayly to waxe woorse and woorse, and decrease in their vertue. The aire is oftentimes corrupt, sometime with vntimely showers, sometime with vnprofitable drinesse, now with too much colde, now with extreame heate. The fruitfulnes of the feilde is not such as it hath been aforetime: Riches and substance we see consumed: The Progenie of great and Noble men, we perceiue dayly to be multiplyed, but their patrimonie is no whit encreased, but impayred by discorde. By which it commeth to passe, that many great men and Lordes, bend all their cogitations to the oppressing of their poore Tenantes, and by often fines, and exactions, bring honest men to beggerie,

               Another great argumēt of the worlds consummation, is, because all good artes, &amp; learning, haue these fewe yeeres been so contemned, and Vniuersities and schooles, and scholasticall discipline (which are the causes &amp; fountaines of knowledge) almost in euery place come to decay. For God in this last age hath shewed his singuler and marueilous goodwil towards mankynd: especially (in that so great barbarousnes of our Predecessors, when all artes and liberall learning was hid, and knowen to sewe, the Latin tongue polluted, smal cunning in the Greeke:) by raysyng vp some Vall

                  , or almost beggery, that their wiues and children must be inforced to liue vppon almes. But what is the cause of this miserie? Is not that intollerable tearyng, and spoyling of Church goodes the chiefest? Is it not to be imputed vnto those Magistrates, whose care is such ouer Ministers, that they will not allowe them abundance of worldly wealth, least happely by possessing much, they tast of couetousnes the roote of all mischiefe, and so desire more? or els fall into ryotousnesse, and so become Epicures? Or if that be not in their minde, they doo imagine them selues to be such Lords of body and soule, as was of late that Romish Tyrant. This may very well without offence be coniectured, although it may be that their insaciable desire of worldly promotion, which by ryches without vertue may be gotten, is the roote from which so diuelish fruite dooth proceede. How much better were it if in these things a meane were obserued, and that Churche men had wherewithall to lyue honestlye, wyth keeping hospitalitie, and if that whiche were thought too much for them, were Christianly bestowed

either on those which liue in pouertie, or carefully reserued to some other good vse? For as plentye brings pride and hautines of mynde: so pouertie ingendreth contempt, not onely of Ministers, but of the Ministrie also, which being disdayned for lacke of preferment, mens cogitations are so turned, that rather they had to bynd their sonnes to some seruile occupation, then bring them vp in liberall instruction: by which, must needes followe not onely the great scarsitie of learned men,Contempt of the ministerie. but also greeuous want of godly Ministers, and so consequently, the miserable estate and ouerthrowe of the Church. Now what remayneth but that we certaynly perswade our selues, that rhese are playne and euident signes and testimonies of Gods great displeasure agaynst vs for dispising his Ministers, whose contempt he neither can for his holines, nor will for his iustice suffer any time, as the the manifold miseries &amp; plagues that be euery where, doo shewe vnto vs. And as the sonne of God Christ sayd before, that after the preaching of the Gospell, destruction should follow, I hope the time is so farre from being differred, that it will spedely come vppon vs. For it cannot be but that the prophecie of Christ should be true: which could not be, if those dayes of barbarousnes and ignorance of true religion (which we are lyke to fall into) were not by his speedy comming preuented.
               Moreouer, we should thinke the worldes foundation to be worne out, and the same to be falling vpon our shoulders, when we sensiblye perceiue our selues to liue in those dayes, wherof Christ foretold, saying:Math. 24. 
                  The comming of the sonne of man shalbe as were the dayes of Noe. For then were men eating, drinking, marrying, and were married, vntill Noe entred the Arke. And they perceiued nothing vntill the flood came, and ouerwhelmed

them all: and such shalbe the comming of the sonne of man. By which no doubt the lord would signify,Securitie of lyfe. that in the latter dayes there should be a marueylous securitie, wherby there should arise not only vnspeakeable wickednes agaynst God, but also a lamentable disorder &amp; confusion in common weales, for lacke of discipline. Now, if we wil compare tyme present with that which is past, and set the manners of all men before our eyes, we shall perceyue wickednes to haue come to his ripenes, and to raigne almost without controlment. For, (notwithstanding that God through his vnspeakeable mercie in these latter dayes hath giuen vs his Gospell, whereby we should frame our affections according to his will, and liue in vnitie and peace with all men according to his word,) what desire of righteousnes, or zeale in religiō is there to be found? Yea who is not in Christianitie eyther cold, or carelesse? Many desire to be religious, and thinke they are so, if only for a fashion they frequent Sermons, and come to ordinarie seruice and Ceremonies, supposing themselues in doing so, to be sufficiently religious, although their hartes doo burne with desire of transitorie things. &amp; they swel through the poyson of al vngodlynesse. Many also thinke they do marueilous wel, in making the doctrine of loue, peace, and vnitye, the occasion of stryfe, contention, and heresie. And suppose they do serue God very wel, if, knowing some of a contrarie opiniō, though not in the chiefest poynt of Religion, they doo with wordes condemne them, and with curses commit them to the Diuels punishment: themselues in the meane while, in a certaine spirituall pride gotten through a vaine opinion of learning puft vp, doo, resting vpon the auctoritie of others, not with arguments answering to Gods word,

take hart of grasse, their aduersaries oftentimes defending the better part, and more agreable to the pleasure of the high

Some there be also which thinke well of themselues, and woulde be numbred among good Gospellers, because they haue learned, without knowledge busily among theyr pottes, to inueygh agaynst the papisticall superstition, themselues beyng vniust, theeues, oppressors, and most wicked rouers: such as at this day men call the Guisians, worse (speaking after the manner of men) then ciuill Papistes. What should many wordes doo? We plainly now perceiue greatest vice, for chiefest vertue to be counted: and those men, through a fained shewe of simplicitie to be most commended, which of all other for impietie, ought most to be dispraised. For craftie and deceiptful, are wise: couetous, good husbandes: prodigall, liberall: and riche men are deemed the best men.

               Those and the like vices haue Poets and Philosophers in their dayes, when wickednesse dyd but spring, (as themselues haue testified) reprehended. And therfore is our Lord God earnestly to be desired, that all these euils by his speedie comming may take an ende. For although al maner of wickednesse in this age, haue ascended marueilous high, yet are they not so come to the top, but that more straunge vngraciousnes, and wonderful deceiptes, and more horrible confusions in common weales through euil gouernment of them, may to the griefe and vexation of good men be seene, then euer were. For we see continually that many through their cogging, prating, pride, and flatterie, without all honestie, learning, or Christianitie, in hope of profit, and preferment, prickt thervnto, beate their braines, and bende al their studyes, to be gratious in their eyes, which sit in chiefest place aboue other men. By which it commeth to passe, that for a time they are well accepted euen of the best: but good Princes can

smell them out, and wil banishe them their companie, perswading themselues that that friendship is not of continuance, whose ende and grounde is not the setting foorth, and encrease of vertue. Wherefore it is to be wished, that al Christian Princes would carefully commit these wordes of Christ to continuall remembrance, saying: You shall knowe them by their fruite.

How can it be, Sith vnto a vile nature not regenerate with Gods holy spirit, a wicked custome and delight, as it were another nature, is adioyned? Is this mixture commendable?

For if then he shall espie his beloued sheepe (of which if but one be found which was lost,Luc. 16. the whole troupe of Angels do reioice) by your negligence and fault, to be committed as a pray to wolues and wicked beastes, euill shall it be with you, and then without all doubt in his rage, hee will cast you headlong into hell and extreame darkenes.

Amen.
               Finally also out of the seuenth Chapter of Daniell, a notable coniecture of the suddayne comming of the sonne of God, may be taken: For in that Chapter, be described foure Monarchies of the world, and where, in what Nation, they shal be from tyme to time, vntill the resurrection of the dead. By which, the endes of the ages of this world may after a sort be noted. But these Monarchies being destroyed, there shall spring (sayth Daniell) a mightie kingdome, myghtier than those, immediatly before him, &amp; shall change the religion of Christ, and shall haue wonderfull successe, and shall wage battayle with holy men. Now what kingdome he vnderstandeth, it is apparant by the euent, which is the Turkish Empire. But (as the Prophet sayth) Putabit quod possit mutare tempora &amp;c. He shall thinke that he is of power to alter tymes and lawes:

doo playnlye yenough declare, that an alteration sodaynly shalbe in those dayes, when the Turkish Empire dooth come to the highest, and promiseth himselfe an euerlasting dominion ouer all the world. And strayght way shall that most comfortable daye shewe it selfe, in which the sonne of God shall rayse the dead, and render to his Church life, and eternal glory: but the wicked he shall cast headlong into euerlasting tormentes. With this prophecie let vs compare the times of our predecessors, and our owne together, and we shall euidently perceiue the Turke to haue preuailed mightily against the Christians, and to possesse not onely all Asia, but also a great peece of Europe.

               Also what successe within these few yeeres he hath had, it is well knowen. A great part of Hungarie he enioyeth, from the Venetians
                  ▪ he hath taken Cyprus: now from the King of

And therefore we doo playnly perceyue, the state of these tymes marueilously to aunsweare vnto the Prophecie of Daniell. And it appeareth (if by probable reasons any thing may of lykelyhoode be gathered) that the Turke thorough the ciuill dissentions of people, and continuall warres of Princes, to the ouerthrow of the Gospell by the Popes setting on, will subdue all kingdomes.

But (I trust) the Lord God by his speedie comming, will bring to naught these endeuours of Turke and Pope agaynst his Church, and will cast that beast with the litle horne, which hath mightely encreased, and all those vngodly and dragonish kingdomes arising from the sea, and that false Prophet, into that fornace which burneth with fire and Brimstone.
            
            
               Many reasons and probable coniectures from the course of tyme.
               
                  HEtherto by meane diligence I haue recited those fore tokens of the induring of times, which Christ hath taught vs. And also I haue showē other signes and coniectures out of Gods worde and condition of the tyme that now is, by which we may know the oldnes, and sodayne finishing of tymes, to which when they come to passe, the Lord commaundeth vs to looke backe, and lyft vp our heades. For in that the Lord God declareth his most ardent goodwill towardes vs, in that he would not signify the day and hour, but foreshewed the tokens going immediatly before the same. And therefore sith by these it is manifest, that it is the expresse will of our Sauiour, that out of the written word of Christ we should with all diligence search out the last tyme of our redemption: I doubt not but I shall doo a good deede, and gratefull both to God and his Church, if I vtter foorth some cogitations of myne,

                   holy Scripture, for the proofe of the opinion about the speedye conclusion of tyme. Not that I am in that mynde that I thinke these to be Demonstrations which through a necessitie of that which is to come must needes be, but as probable things so long to be imbraced, tyll we learne more certayne. And therefore in these and the lyke things, I submit my selfe to the better iudgement of the Church and of the learned: and I perswade my selfe that these and other singuler Prognostications which followe, whereby somewhat

                  igher I approch, than as yet I haue doone to shewe the sodayne comming of the Lord, shalbe so farre from terryfying of the godly, that the consideration of these things will be most pleasaunt and comfortable. But yet I take not vppon me (as before also I haue protested) to know the day, which Christ sayth himselfe he dooth not know, (as he lyke a man beareth the office of an Apostle.) For the signes foretold we may know, but not the day and houre: not the very moment of his comming, but the tokens of that moment doo we search out, as farre foorth as it is lawfull for man so to doo.
               The holy Scripture euery where maketh some collation between the first Adam the sinner, &amp; the sonne of God Christ our Sauiour,Rom. 5. 1. Cor. 15. the second Adam: also betweene the floud, the vtter ouerthrowe of the world, euen as Christ dooth signifie in these woordes: Et erit sicut in diebus Noe, &amp;c. And it shalbe as in the dayes of Noe,
                  Mat. 24. 
                  &amp;c. Wherefore I fell first into this consideration, and afterwardes, from one to another, into those which ensue, whether the tymes past in equalitie of the same nomber aunsweared alike. For the Lord God hath ordayned all things by a singuler and euerlasting wisdome, and experience dooth teach, by a

certaine concurring of the Starres, that in such things, e great lykenes of tymes is woont oftentymes to happen: as in the birth of Isaac, and of his offering, which is a figure of Christ, there is a great concent of the tyme. For from Isaac vntill Christ, were two thousand yeeres fully expired. But, when from Adam orderly vntill the floud, we doo consider the yeeres of the generations of all the fathers, and gather them all into one summe, (laying aside the false computation of Eusebius, and others following the Greeke translation of the seuentie Interpreters) from the first yeere of the worlds foundation to the floud, are iudged to be a thousand, sixe hundred, fifty and sixe yeeres. From this number, the yeeres of Christes birth, vnto this present yeere a thousand, fiue hundred, seuentie and fiue, doo differ eightie and one yeere, if truly that number were filled. But I doo not thinke the world shal continue so long, that the latter time should in number exceede the former, for many coniectures which follow: but what may come to passe, the Lord knoweth.
               Lykewyse, Moyses is a figure of Christ, that marueilous deliuering of Israell by Moyses out of the handes of Pharao, is a figure of the victorie of Christ, which in our behalfe he hath by his death on the Crosse, and resurrection from the dead, obtayned agaynst the diuell, and death: and the whole gouernment of M
                        •
                     yses, is a shadowe of Christes kingdome: His destruction, and the Iewes, is no doubt a token of the worldes ouerthrowe. And here we shall see a wonderfull concente, and agreeing of tymes, that so by things past, we may looke for the euent of things to come, vndoubtedly by the singular prouidence, counsayle, and ordinance of God. For no other reason can I render, sith I cannot perswade my selfe, that

these things, can by chance so wonderfully agree togeather. First, by the true accompt of yeeres, it is playne, that from the comming out of Aegypt, and publishing of the lawe, vnto the Natiuitie of Christ, are numbred a thousand, fiue hundred, and nine yeres. Now if the yeeres from the Natiuitie of Christ, vntill this time, in which Christ began agayne to be borne to the world, and to be brought into the light as it were through the preaching of the Gospel, by Luther, and other famous men, were numbred, they are in summe, a thousand, fiue hundred, and seuenteene. Agayne, from the departure out of Aegypt, vntill the death of Christ, the yeeres are accompted to be a thousand, fiue hundred, fortie and two. And this number also dooth marueilously agree with that generall Persecution in Germanye made by Charles the fift, and the Pope, which happened in the yeere a thousand, fiue hundred, fortye and seuen. So that these numbers of yeeres beyng compared togeather, wilbe found not much to differ in quantitie of number.
               But from these poore mentions, I will goe higher to those things, which especially doo agree to our purpose. It is manifest, that Moses gouernment, vntyll the last destruction of Hierusalem by Titus, did stand in all, one thousand, fiue hundred, eightie &amp; three yeeres. Neyther is it to be doubted of any, but that that destruction, and wasting (of Hierusalem) is a manifest figure of the last ruine of this world. And therfore doth our Lord speake of these things together, and sayth: those dayes were the dayes of Noe in respect of manners, and the securitie of mans lyfe. Nowe at length, what shall we gather of these things? That the terme of the worlds destructiō should agree with the former number of yeeres of Moses gouernment? Which

not the sonne of an Emperour, or chiefest Monarch, as was Ierusalem: but the sonne of God much mightier than all Emperours, an euerlasting king, can bring to naught.Melancthonin vita Vaspatiani. Which thing Melancthon seemeth plainly to point at in the lyfe of Vespasian in his Chronicles: and the like reason is here, which is in the former comparison of nūbers, if things to come may be gathered by things past already. The figure doth altogether in this place agree, &amp; the chiefest signe of Christes comming, to wit, the preaching of the Gospel hath gonne before, and we to sticke in the midst of all the other foretolde calamities, and euery yeere expect more miserie.
               Finally also, the Astronomers write (if euery skilfull man in his owne facultie is to be credited) that the starres in the beginning of the thousand, fiue hundred, eightie &amp; foure yeeres, (which almost altogether doth agree with the number aboue mentioned) doo threaten very fearefull and horrible things, eyther a greeuous alteration of Empires, and other wonderfull things: or els an vtter destruction of this world.

                     iunction of Planes. a most excellent Mathematician, in a certaine booke of Prognostications for twentie yeeres, from the yeere sixtie foure, to the eightie foure, be these: Anno Domini .1583. mense Maio. &amp;c. Which is, In the yeere of our Lord 1583. in the moneth of May, there shall happen a great coniunction of the superior Planets in the last ende of Pisces, after which straightwayes in the yeere eightie foure, shall ensue a wonderfull mixture of all the Planets almost in Taurus, about the ende of March, and beginning of Aprill. And which is more: a little after that shalbe seen, an Eclypse of the Sun in the twentie degree of Taurus, about the head of Algol, a most cruell and hurtfull fixed starre, gouerned by Venus, which shalbe linked to fiue Planets in Aries, tending toward the twelfe. Here (sayth he) must we watch: and I thinke it

meete that all earthly cogitations be cast of, least we be destroyed beyng vnreadie: for this great coniunction is of all the la

                     t, which shall happen in the ende of watrie Trigon, and watrie Trigon shall perish, and be turned into fire. Neyther any more it the space of eyght hundred yeeres the end of watrie Trigon shall be nigh. But because about the ende of watrie Trigon this Monarchie shall begin, it is likely, that the same also in the ende of the same 
                        •
                     rigon shall haue an ende, sith the sonne of God himselfe Iesus Christ our Lorde euen in the ende of watrie Trigon tooke vppon him the nature of man. For sixe yeeres before his most glorious Natiuitie, the same verie coniunction in the extremitie of Pisces, and in the beginning of Aries happened. Neither came the lyke from since that time, but when Charles the Great helde his Empire, which was in the yeere of our Lord seuen hundred, eightie and nyne. And now the second tyme, such a great and straunge coniunctiō shal come, which vndoubtedly doth foreshewe the other comming of the sonne of God &amp; man, in Maiestie of his glory, at which time wee must render an accompt of our lyfe and conuersation. And a little after he sayth: But vnder Charles the great the ende of the world could not be, because at that tyme, fiue thousand yeeres were not expired. But now the operations of this great coniunction continuing, the number shall tende to sixe thousand yeeres: which agreeth with the holy Prophet, affyrming, that this world should stand sixe thousand yeeres, of which summe of yeeres the sonne of God shal take somwhat, saying: the last time for the elected of God shalbe shortned. But if there remained yet another coniunction of the former Planets like to the first, then should there be required almost eight hundred yeeres moe: which added to the tymes of this great coniunction, do make the nūber of sixe thousand, &amp; almost foure hundred yeeres, which is plainly against that prophesie. These coniectures howsoeuer they are I thought good to recite, which doo agree with the learned Prophesies

of most auncient Astrologers. Hytherto Cyprian: which also by his Latine verses doth showe that old and common prophesie turned into Germanical Rhythmes by Iohn Stoffler, which also aboue nineteene yeeres agoe I haue heard recited by Melanthon. The wordes in the Germane tongue be these:

                     Tawsent fnuffhundert achtzich acht.
                     Das ist das Iar, das ich betracht.

               The Latine verses are thus

                     When after Christes birth there be expirde
                     Of hundreds fifteen, yeeres, eightie and eight,
                     Then comes the tyme of daungers to be ferde,
                     And all mankind with dolors it shall fraight.
                     For if the world in that yeere doo not fall,
                     If sea and land then perish ne decaie:
                     Yet Empires all, and Kingdomes alter shall,
                     And man to ease himselfe shall haue no way.
                  
               
               Now by this it appeareth, howe the number of yeeres of Moses gouernment, which endured a thousand fyue hundred eyghtie and three yeeres, and of this yeere a thousand fyue hundred eyghty and foure, in (whose beginning that prodigious coniunction of the Planets in the ende of watry Trigon dooth happen,) agree togeather: so that the quantitie and number

of the tymes foretold, the signes and starres seeme to agree togeather, and without all doubt to pretend the same thing. In lyke manner may we bring foorth other comparisons of tyme, which by reason of lyke euentes, agree togeather wonderfully. Of which this one is not of least wayght: To witte, that same tyme from the natiuitie of Christ vnto the ouerthrow of Hierusalem, is almost equall with that, when Luther first of all set himselfe agaynst rhe Popes Indulgences, and began to preach the Gospell to this yeere eyghty and eyght, in which or about the same, by this marueylous ioyning togeather of Planets, which shalbe foure yeeres before, by the singuler prouidence of God, so direful destinies of the world shall meete togeather. For from the byrth of Christ vntyll the destruction of Hierusalem, are numbred seuentie and three yeeres: and from the tyme Luther and others first began to preach Christ and his Gospell, vntill the eyghtie and eyght yeere, are acompted seuentie and one. The number is iust with that before, (and speaking allegorically,) thē may Christ be sayd to be born againe, when as his doctrine, so long by Papisticall dreames darkened, &amp; fond illusions so deeply buried, is as it were borne anewe, and doth clearely shine among vs. But if those yeeres from the birth of Christ vntill his preaching, and suffering of death, with that generall persecution done by Charles the fifte and the Pope: and againe those yeeres from rhe death of Christ vntill the destruction of Hierusalem, wyth these yeeres, which came since that general persecution, vntill the eightie and eight yeere, were compared: we shall see also that in number of yeeres they doo not much differ. For between Christes birth and his preaching, there was thirtie yeeres: and so to his death .33. yeeres, and somewhat more. But from that seuenteene

yeere, when the Euangelicall doctrine began to shine againe, vntill the fortie and sixe yeere in all, when Charles the Emperour began to arme himself against the states of the Empire, so to abolish the doctrine of Christ, are numbred twentie and nine yeeres. Againe, from the death of Christ to the ouerthrowe of Herusalem, there was fortie yeeres. And from that generall persecution, which happened in the fortie and sixe yeere, vntill the eightie and sixe yeere, are accompted fortie yeeres: which is the middle yeere between the eightie foure, when that exceeding straunge vniting together of the Planets shall appeare, and the eyghtie eight, about which that coniunction shall take his full force.
               Moreouer, I find, that these tymes, in which those two wonderfull coniunctions dyd appeare, sixe yeres before the byrth of Christe, and in the dayes of Charles the Great, and the thyrd, and last, which shal happen before the ful expiryng of sixe thousand yeres, the thousand, fiue hundred, eighty and foure beyng at hand, do fyll the same number. For Cyprian Leouitius doth write, that that other vnityng of Planets in the tyme of Charles the Great, chaunced in the yeare, seuen hundred, eighty and nyne, after the natiuitie of Christ. If to this number so many moe were added, the yeares would be, one thousand, fyue hundred, seuenty, and eight. Nowe, if to these were added, those sixe yeares before Christ was borne, when the first of these three coniunctions happened, there shall aryse, countyng from the Natiuitie of Christ, as it were from an effect of the former coniunction, the same number of yeares in full quantitie agreeing with that dreadfull yeare, eighty foure, aboue a thousande fiue hundred: onely that first, from this last, which is to come, differyng those sixe yeares before Christes byrth.
               
                  I confesse my selfe not to be skilfull in Astronomie, although I do greatly esteeme that Arte (if it be soberly vsed, and not vainely abused) which some, because they are not acquainted therewith (as commonly it happeneth) doo not onely despise, but also with euyll wordes, because it is abused of some, deface. But if the writyngs of Leouitius, and which was a great while before his tyme, Iohn Stoffler, and other Astronomers iudgements, of those rare coniunctions of all the Planets in the end of watry Trigon, be true: (as certesse I beleue, and verily perswade my selfe) I say plainly, it is a thyng greatly to be marueyled at, that those collations of tymes (in which the Lord God eyther hath bestowed singuler benefites vppon his Church, and also wyll bestow, or altered kyngdomes, and wyll alter) by such a certaine wonderfull equalitie, and quantitie of number should answer between themselues, euen as those causes of Astronomers in euery respect haue doone. Of which it is most euid
                     •
                  ntly gathered, that the Lord God, by a singuler prouidence, and eternal Counsaile, dooth guyde and gouerne all thyngs. And also it is plainly to be seene, that he hath made the Starres, and the course of them to be as it were Clockes of his eternall counsaile, and gouernments of such things in his Church,Prayse of Astronomie. Gen. 1. and common Weales, euen as the Lord God also dooth witnesse hym selfe, that those lights in the Firmament of heauen, should be for Signes of tymes, and dayes, and yeares.
               And therefore from these thyngs doo cunnyng Astronomers fetch their coniectures, bycause through a certayne order which the Starres doo keepe, they haue by long vse obserued very many thyngs, that so, from a true obseruation of principles, they may bring foorth generall coniectures, whose euents doo marueylously agree togeather. And that there is a certaine order, or

a true course of the Starres, that wonderfull agreeyng togeather of yeares, continually in great alterations of Kyngdomes, and Religion, which hath beene marked, is a great proofe: as by that which is already spoken, shal more plainly appeare. Truely, as oft as I consider these things, I am not only exceedingly troubled in mynd, but as it were compelled to beleue, that that especiall tyme of the end of this world, is nigh at hand: because the Lord among other things also hath gyuen as certayne tokens, these to wyt: that before his commyng, there shalbe a darkenyng of the Sunne and Moone, and that the qualities of the heauens shalbe troubled. By which woords no doubt he would signifie, that the whole Firmament of Starres should be altered, and as it were threaten a destruction.

                  THerefore, in my iudgement, herein is conteyned a woonderfull Mysterie, yea greater then may be vttered by any man, in that our mercyfull father (if any credit may be gyuen to Mathematicians) to these three tymes, betweene those two thousand yeares of the last age, which (according to Elias Prophesie) were appoynted to Christ, hath annexed the same coniunction of all the Planets, vnder

the same Signes. Because, if these Mathematicall obseruations, togeather with that agreement of tymes already spoken of, were compared with the Prophesies of the Prophetes, of Christe, and of Paule, we shall fynd a marueylous concent of al these thyngs. Which thing by the Prophets, by Christ, and by the Apostles (the Starres signifying the same, through the vnspeakeable loue of God towards his Ch
                     •
                  rch) is therfore doone, that these three tymes, as it were by a most necessary obseruation, should be marked: to wyt, about what time Christ tooke vpō him our nature, also about what tyme, by the comming of Antichrist, the true doctrine of Christ was obscured, and that sonne of perdition obteyned the chiefe place in the Church, and Empire of the world: and finally, about what tyme that glorious commyng of the sonne of God to iudgement, is to be looked for. But that we may the better open these things, let vs consider, after what manner the euents of those two former tymes haue happened, in which the same constellation of the Starres, accordyng to the opinion of Cyprian Leouitius, dyd come, that of those two past, we may the better iudge of that most ioyfull commyng of the sonne of God, to all his elect, and may certainely perswade our selues, that he wyll make hast, and come shortly, and with speede: and also let vs consider that tyme, in which the same constellation shall appeare againe, which was twise before, &amp; in multitude of yeres (as is aboue sayd) is like these past.
               
                  Of the comming of Christ into the flesh,When the godly about Christs time did see the gouernment should be taken not onely from the stocke of Dauid, but also from the Iewes, and translated to strange rulers, to wit, to the house of Antipater the Idumite, no doubt they supposed that Christes comming into the flesh was then at hand: and the rather they did so thinke,Gen, 49, because Iacob, the Patriarch had

               Lykewyse Saint Paule did foretell a most certayne argument of the comming of the sonne of perdition. For in the tyme of Paule there were some in so wicked an opinion, that they thought the comming of the Lord euen then to be nigh at hand,2. Thessa. 2. which Paule endeuoreth to bring frō that error, teaching that the lord should not come, before that wicked man an enemie to God, were first reuealed, and that he should not be reuealed, except first that auncient and present Empire of Rome were vtterly abolished. Which thing he dooth signifie in these wordes, saying: He onely which keepeth, let him hold presently, vntill he be taken awaye, and then that wicked man shalbe made open. Hierome followed the same sense, wryting vnto Algasia in this manner: Quae causa sit, &amp;c. That is: You knowe very well, what the cause is, that Antichrist now pres

                     reof it is that according

to Iohns Reuelation in the forehead of that purpled Harlot, there is written a name of blasphemie, of euerlasting Rome. For if he had playnly sayd, Antichrist shall not come, except first the Romane Empire be abolished, a iust cause there might arise of persecuting the East Church which then was. And a litle after he sayth: The Romane Empire, which now keepeth all Nations in subiection, must be ouerthrowen, and then shall Antichrist come the fountayne of iniquitie. The same sense dooth Tertullian, in his treatise of the resurrection of the flesh, and Lactantius treate of, in his seuēth booke, &amp;. 25. Chapter of Institutions.
               
               But if we would compare the Prophesie of Paule, with the deedes of Charles the Great, we shall fynde that prophesie in those dayes marueilously to haue taken effect, and then the auncient Empire of the Romanes altogether to haue come to naught, and the title of the Empire, which was the image of the Beast, to be translated to the Frenchmen, and Germans, and afterwardes by little and little especially to haue come to the Pope of Rome, which at that time begā plainly to shewe himself to be very Antichrist, and that damnable childe.Platina.

So the power and malice of the Byshops increasing by little and little, the whole world came vnder their subiection, and all Emperours, Kings, and Princes became as it were their Clients, or (as I may say) their Vassalles: and they yet in name the seruantes of Slaues, but indeede as it were chiefe Monarches of all Kings, seruing at their beckes.

That is, Those Babylonian Priestes desire to raigne, equals they cannot abyde: they wyll not leaue of, vntill they haue troden al things vnder their feete, and sit in the temple of God, and be exalted aboue all that which is worshipped. The desire of riches, and thirst for preferment is vnsatiable. The more you giue to a couetous mā, the more he gapes. Shewe your singer, and he will desire the hand.

He is in feare, least he be compelled to giue an accompt of those things which dayly he dooth more and more against the lawes. He speaketh wonderfull things, as if he were God. Newe deuises are in his minde, whereby he may impropriate the Empire to himselfe. He chaungeth lawes, his owne he establisheth, he abuseth he spoyleth, deceyueth, slayeth. This man of perdition which is called Antichrist, in whose forehead it is written, I am God (and cannot erre.) He sitteth in the temple of God, and beareth sway farre and wyde.

Heare what his most impudent fauourers on his behalfe haue reported: The Pope (say they) is called as it were wonderful, from Pape the Interiection of woondring, because he is Christes Vicar and Gods, whose the fulnesse of the earth is. And Iohn Andr. vpō this woord Pope, in the Proeme of Clement, speaketh thus: Papa dictus est quasi pater Patrum. &amp;c. The Pope is called as it were the father of all fathers, hauyng onely the fulnesse of power.

The Popes wyl is said to be a heauenly wyll, and therfore is of power to chaunge the nature of things, to apply that vnto one, which belongeth to another, and of nothyng, to make somewhat.

And as the Occidentall Empyre of the great Pope, in the tyme of Charles the Great, was diuided from the Orientall: so likewise the Empire at Constantinople, which sometyme was called also the Orientall Empire of Rome, afterwards was greatly diminished by the great Turke &amp; Sarasins, whose power afterward increased more and more, and that mightily. Afterward, a litle before the raigne of Carolus Caluus, Cousin to Charles the Great, the Tartarian Turkes, by occasion they were requested to assist the Persians against the Sarasins, obteyned all Asia: and these embracing the Mathematicall sect, at the length came to be of greatest power. So that these two wicked and Antichristian kingdomes tooke their beginnyng, when the Romane Empire in Phocas tyme and Heraclius was impayred: and in the raigne of Charles the Great, the Empyre almost subuerted, they dayly more and more mightily increased, in this weake and diuided kingdome, whose feete were become partly of yron, and partly of earth. Afterward, by lyes, backslidings, and slaughter (which are the properties of the Antichristians) their rulyng and Religion

was confirmed, and the Saintes of God, by myngling earthly with heauenly things, were vexed: as Historiographers, and the Chronicles of Iohn Auentine euery where do witnesse. And therfore both of them by the glorious commyng of the Lord, shall be abolished, and shal receyue one, and the same destruction.
               If therfore to the consolation of all the godly, and confirmation of our faith, the holy Ghost hath had a great care to d

And therfore hath the holy spirit of God been the more diligent to shew to the Church, many and manifest signes of the Lords commyng to iudgement, that so he might driue vs from all securitie of this lyfe, and wake vs out of the deepe slepe of our deadly sinnes, least by the speedy commyng of the Lord to iudgement, we sodainly perish: and that in all afflictions, with which the Church is continually vexed, we might haue a sure trust and confidence in the mercy of God. And therfore the sonne of God him selfe, in the last preaching before his death, through a great goodwyll gaue vs many signes, and earnestly charged vs, taking his parable from the Fyg tree, that beholding those tokens imminēt, we should carefully and readily, attend the commyng of our Brydgrome. For that commyng to all the godly and chosen of the

Lord, shalbe ioyfull and comfortable. In which the Sonne of God shall appeare in power mighty, in glory woonderfull, and shew hym selfe to his foes terrible, to vs comfortable: to them seuere, gentle to vs: to them a Iudge and condemner: to vs an Aduocate and Redeemer: to them an enemy and destroyer, to vs an assured friend and defender: so that he shall recompence them with fire continuall among the Diuels, but vs he shal reward with his fauour perpetual, in the societie of Angels, and celestial habitation. And therfore doth Ioel cal that day of the Lord, a great day,Ioel. 2. and terrible (to the wicked) when all from the worlds creation, shall be made to stand before the tribunall seate of God.
               Aboue I haue shewed, that the chiefest signe of the comming of the sonne of man was the preaching of rhe Gospell, which Paule termeth the spirit of the Lords mouth: also I haue declared how that signe is euident in these dayes, and that Antichrist by the breth of the mouth of the Lord is ouerthrowen, and strangled with lynnin, as Sebyl Erithraa speaketh (that is with interpretations of holy Scripture imprinted in Paper made of linen) it is manifest to all godly,Lib. 8. and men instructed in true religion. Now what what other thing remayneth? But the consummat

                  on of the world, and that glorious comming of the Lord, by which that wicked and damned sonne shalbe abolished, according to Christes woordes. Hytherto that coniunction of all Planets which was a litle before the birth of Christ, and in the time of Charles the great in the beginning both of the Turkes tyrannicall dominion, and rhe Popes Antichristian religion, which shal ensue very shortly, dooth belong. As if the Lorde would say: Behold the chiefest signe of my comming, according to my promise, the preaching of the Gospell

is come already, you see the power of Antichrist my sworne enemie is greatly weakned, now shall you see the very signes in heauen, which foretold my former comming in the flesh, and the comming of my aduersary, by which you may gather my commyng, wherby I wil vtterly abolish his vsurped gouernment, and abandon him from the godly, to that bottomlesse pyt of hell. And therefore take you heede, and be circumspect, for the tyme of your deliuerance is at hand. Neither can we doubt (sith the Starres are of the Lord God created for signes vnto vs) but that marueilous coniunction of the Planets, doth foreshew a wonderfull and incredible alteration of all things. And what other change may we looke for, I pray you? But euen the vtter destruction of the world, and the triumphant appearing of the Lord. For the sixe thousand yeere, which is the last daye, draweth to the euening, course of tymes, and their foretold agreement, declare the end to be at hand: the preaching of the Gospell shineth, the Pope of Rome by the breath of the Lord perisheth, and we are in Religion colde, carelesse, and contemne his preachers, which the Lord God cannot suffer long to go vnpunished. Also this fearfull inclination of the Starres, the dayly talke of warres, the direful ciuill contentions, the cruell dissention in Religion, the great plagues, the miserable hunger, the straunge tempestes, the woonderfull risings of the Sea, and other signes, which many tymes haue come after the preaching of the Gospell, and dayly do more increase, are out of doubt the euident signes of the worldes speedy ouerthrow, and hasty commyng of our Lord Iesus Christ the sonne of God, to iudge the quicke and the dead.

It is well knowen to all the learned, and not doubted, but that all gouernments, according to the Princes of Philosophie Platoes and Aristotles doctrine, haue their certaine conclusions, and it may be for truth; that euery fiue hundred yeares there happen wonderfull alterations both in Religion and common Weales, as there appeared three in Moses Kingdome. For from the comming out of Egypt vnto Salomon, there was about fiue hundred yeares, from thence vnto the captiuitie at Babylon, other fiue hundred: and from the returning vnto the last subuersion, fiue hundred moe: which last periode doth greatly agree with those seuē weekes of Daniell, because they are in number foure hundred foure score, and tenne. And therfore by a briefe marking of the tymes and things brought to passe, we will make it euident, that the last fiue hundred yeares from the Apostles tyme, fully shalbe expired in this Monarchie of the Pope, which now threateneth a great ruine

and perchance an vtter downefall about the eightie eyght, and ninetie three yeere, the former inclinations of the starres and other ensuing, foreshewing dyrefull thinges euen vntill the sixe thousand and a hundred yeere.Apo. 13. Which Monarchie is called of Iohn in his Reuelation, the image of the beast, by reason of a certaine likenes it hath wyth the olde Monarchie, which by a like tyrannie against the Christians, and manner of gouernment by their ecclesiasticall Senate, and by the secular power (as they saye) to the satisfying of their myndes in oppressing the Christian veritie through all the world, they doo exercise. So that by a great and infallible supposition it may be gathered, that the noble comming of the Sonne of God is nygh at hande: sith the preaching of the Gospell now goeth before, by which this Monarchie hauing his aucthoritie from the Dragon, at the length ruinous beginneth to stoupe, but cannot vtterly be abolished, according to Paules doctrine, vntyll the Lord come for altogether. For by histories we know, Iohn the Euangelist to haue lyued longer time than any of the Apostles, &amp; to haue written his Gospel at Ephesus, and afterward when as none of the Apostles were,

               Now these hundred yeares from the birth of Christ vnto the tyme of Traian beyng expired, so straunge

things and myraculous both in the Church and common Weales happened, as from the beginning of the worlde such and so great neyther haue, neither shall come to passe, except onely in the last comming of the Lorde, at what tyme he shall call the dead before hys tribunall seate, that so the whole vngracious worlde may be brought vnto perpetuall shame, and the vertuous to euerlasting glory: for first o
                     •
                  r Lord and Sauiour Christ was borne of a virgin, perfect man, the Messias promised to the Patriarches, the sonne of one substance with his eternall father, by whom God hath made of nothing, al things both in heauen aboue, and in earth belowe, and redeemed mankynd which was fallen, from sinne, and wickednes: for in the behalfe of vs all, he hath suffred a most reprochfull death of the Crosse, to that ende, that death, and the Diuell beyng vanquished, he myght rid all beleeuers from eternall death, and the intolerable yoke of Satan. He hath also rysen lyke a conquerour in glory from the dead, and ascended into heauen, that he myght prepare a waye for vs to his almightie father, whose anger by his righteousnes he had appeased, and reconciled him vnto vs.
               Finally also, at the feast of Penticost, God miraculously and without meane (according as it was long before promised by the Prophetes) did powre out his holy spirit full of all grace, and goodnes vppon his Apostles, that in all Nations they myght be able to glorify God, and by euery speache declare their message of glad tydings: as also Mangre the diuel and his Adherentes the same (notwithstāding the outragious cruelty of Nero and Diomitian,) was preached &amp; published throughout all the world.
               Lastly, what wonderfull things haue happened from the byrth of Christ vnto the hundred yeere after the same, at which tyme Traiane fyrst receyued the

Emperiall Di

                     deme? I mynde not to prosecute euery thing particulerly, least by that meanes contrary to my purpose I proceede. Amongst other things, those woordes forespoken of Christ and the Prophets, teaching the ouerthrowe and vtter destruction, of the Iewes and Hierusalem, take effect: and also vnder Traiane the Emperour there happened a great alteration in religion. For although the Empyre was of Rome, yet was not the Emperour a Romane borne but a Spaniard, and adopted to that dignitie, of Nerua which was a Romane. And therfore by these it plainely doth appeare, that the Apostles beyng dead, there was now a new face of the Church, and that nothing so beautifull as the former, and also new state of Empire presignifyed of Iohn in his Reuelation. Because that Traian was the eyght from the seuenth who was Nerua, which was the seuenth from Nerc the last of the stocke of Caesars, from whom Iohn beginneth to number the seuen Kings, which were the seuen heades of the Beast. And therefore he sayth:Apo. 17. 
                  Bestia quam vidisti, fuit, &amp; non est, that is, The Beast which thou sawest, was, and is not, that is, the Romane Empire is, but not such an Empyre, as that was which came of the stocke of Caesars, and decayed, when Nerua dyed. And now i

And cum venerit, opportet eum breue tempus manere, nec diu imperare: whē he commeth he must tary a short tyme, and gouerne but a whyle: which also came to passe, because he raigned but one yeere and three monethes. But Traian was the eyght, a Spaniard no Romane borne, and adopted by the seuenth. Wherefore to the purpose sayth the Angell to Iohn in this maner: Bestia que erat, The beast which was, to wit, the Romane Empire, &amp; non est, and is not the Romane, but a Romanspanish

About which time Boniface the third was confirmed vniuersall Bishop of all the world, and manifested the forerunner of Antichrist, as likewyse Gregorie the great not many yeeres before had pronounced of the Patriarch of Constantinople, which ambitiously sought to be Priuate, or chiefe Byshop of the rest. About this time, the Romane Empire was much weakened, and the Turke began to be of power. This first periode, may well be referred to the Church of Christ, in whose beginning (as it were) shee suffered most greeuous persecution of the Romane Empire, that cruell and blooddie beast, and had many godly and learned men, which entred most dangerous and continuall conflictes for the ouerthrowe of heresies: and yet notwithstanding by litle and litle many Ceremonies were brought into the Church, by which at length shee was marueilously polluted: the chiefest bringer of those ceremonies into the Church, was Gregorie the great, vntill Boniface by the helpe of Phocas, did playnly declare himselfe to be Antichrist in deede.
               From this time vntil the raigne of Henry the fourth,The second

and in the tyme of Henry, that impietie came to ripenes, euen as also afterward did the Turkes tyrannie and blasphemie. Before about a two hundred and fiftie yeares numbring from Phocas the Emperour, which also haue their ende, to wit, in the dayes of the Emperours, the Pope of Rome was licensed to be a ciuill Magistrate, receyued his chiefe aucthoritie from Pipine; and afterwardes from Charles the Great, and Lodouike the Godly, and was endued with many Prouinces, and adorned with double power, or with both Swordes both of ruling the Spiritualtie (as they saye) and Laitie: which he obtained vnder the pretence of Religion: and therefore Iohn in his Reuelation gyueth to this Beast two hornes like vnto the Lambe.Apo. 13.

So that, that diuine Reuelation of Iohn, dyd fully take effect: bicause that Image of the Beast with two hornes, dooth exercise al the power of the former beast, and calleth al kings his sonnes and slaues, and earnestly dooth keepe the manner of the Gentiles in all kynd of Idolatrie, only hauyng altered the names of things. Lastly also to this Image of the Beast by the Dragon (bycause he speaketh like a Dragon) that power is gyuen, that he may quicken the other image of the Beaste, that is, this Germanicall Empire, which rather ought to be termed a shadowe of the old Empire, than an image of the same. For the Pope did giue life to the image of the Beast by his election. For vnlesse the Pope did confirme the election,Apo. 13. none was worthy of the name of an Emperour. Therfore vnder the pretēce of the keies of the kindō of heauē, this vngratious felow hath marueilusly abused this power of the Dragon, which power now by the preaching of the Gospell, through the grace of God doth threaten an vtter and last destruction: whose longest terme of fiue hūdred yeres, about the yere a thousand,

sixe hundred, (or there about) is fully finished. Wherefore (sith this damnable childe, and the image of the Beast with the Dragon in that perfect wickednes must be cut of, and cast hedlong into hell) a great and infallible argument is it, and agreeing to Gods word, and to the course of time, that this certaine computation of yeeres doth signifie the Lords comming to be very nigh at hand.
            
            
               ¶ Of things past already, things to come are marueilously gathered,
               
                  BY that which hath ben spoken, as wel as a briefe annotation of tymes, and thyngs that haue been done, could shewe, it after a sort appeareth, how, after the death of Henry the fourth, the Pope became the chiefe Monarch of all the worlde, ruled all kyngs, and obteyned all authoritie of chusing Bishoppes. Also howe that third Periode of fiue hundred yeares, about the yeare of our Lord, one thousand and sixe hundred should be fully perfect, that so without all doubt we may looke for a new Metamorphosis of these things, if things to come may well be gathered of things past already. And what other (I beseech you) can we looke for, but euen that which was seene, and heard of Iohn in his Reuelation, from hym which sate on the Throne among the foure and twenty Elders, saying; Behold, I make al things

new, a newe heauen, a newe earth: behold the Tabernacle of God with men, and he shall dwell with them,
                  Apo. 21. 
                  and they shalbe his people, and he shall be a God with them, euen their God. But when those vngodly Decrees and blasphemies, which the Romanes frō the fifty seuen, vnto the thousand one hundred yeare (in all the tyme that Henrie the fourth raigned) by litle and litle brought in, are considered, and withall compared with our dayes, we shall find all those things continually to haue had (as it it were peculiarly) their fiue hundred yeares a peece. Wherefore, in my iudgement, by the tymes past, and state of things present, I am the more confirmed to thinke the full and perfect end of all vngodlynesse, to be very nigh at hand, after which shall ensue that perpetuall and euerlasting world, in which the Lord God shall raigne and rule in iustice, truth, and mercy, for euer.
               In the tyme of Henry (as out of histories we gather) these Decrees of the Bishoppes were published: first,

                   that the Emperours shoulde haue no aucthoritie to chuse Bishoppes, nor Pope: for which cause the Senate of Cardinals, to whom was geuen that power, was instituted and preferred to great honour: then also they tooke vppon them to chuse, and refuse Emperours at their pleasure, as plainly appeared by Hildebrandes electing of Rodolph, and displacing of Henry. Moreouer vnder this Emperour, that horrible Idolatrie of the woorshippyng and carrying about of the bread, came into the Church.
               Lastly, in the yeare one thousand, nyntie, and three, al the lawes of Popes were gathered &amp; set forth by one Iuon B. of Carnot. And therfore no doubt, but the Lord God also at his certayne tyme, wyll bri

and wickednes, which the Diuell by his ministers, to the reproch of God, hath caused, increased, and confirmed. For we haue examples both in the people of the Iewes, and Gentiles. For when as their superstition, and obstinate vngodlynes was come to the top, then sprang vp the true doctrine, and preaching of the Gospell, by which their false doctrine was reproued, yet in the meane while, through the iust and horrible displeasure of God against them, most greeuously were they plagued, euen as also happened to the Iewes, by Ierusalems destruction, and also to other nations, and lastly to Rome, in the miserable spoyling of the Gothes and vandolles.

So doo I perswade my selfe: thinke you what you will, at your pleasure, and yet take heede ye rhinke not falsly. But if in other places I erre, the matter is not great. For it is certayn out of the word of God, that this errour shall not long continue. For Christ is the very truth, and cannot erre. But let vs note what hath happened, and dayly dooth happen among Christians in this our age, and playnly and euidently, we shall see all things (forespoken) to haue, and daily to come to passe, about this very tyme of fiue hundred yeeres. For we haue a notable example hereof in the Electors, and states of the Empire, which in the yeere one thousand, fiue hundred fiftye and eight (which was about the fiue hundred yeere after the Popes began their tyranny ouer Kings and Princes) did chuse Ferdinandus the Emperor maugre the Pope,

By which no doubt it is euident, that that space of fiue hundred yeeres in which the Cardinals bare the swaye, is now passing, and will shortly be expired, euen as the other peeuish, and idolatrous doctrine of the Papistes is well, and to their perpetuall prayse banished out of the Dominions of manye good Kings and Princes.An admonition to P

                   which afterwarde by Iuon Byshoppe of Carnot (after whom Gratian followed) in the yeere of the Lord one thousand nintie and three, at the commaundement of the Pope was

truly collected into one booke, as it were by imitating Iustinian the Emperour, which by the ayde of Tribonianus and other noble men, gathered the Ciuill lawe into an order, and made thereof a newe booke. But how with absurdities in number infinite, &amp; blasphemies not to be vttered, those decrees of the Pope doo filthily deface the woord of God, none of a ryght iudgement is ignorant. And yet alas these haue had more aucthoritie now many yeares, than the very immutable worde, and will of God. Which things although they doo agree very well together, yet for the sakes of the ignorant we will proue the same both by a Canon of holy Scripture, and the Popes decrees, manifestly contrarie between themselues. Paule sayth to Timothie:1. Tim. 4. 
                  Spiritus disertè dicit, fore, &amp;c. That is, The Spirit saith plainly, that in the latter tymes some shall depart from the fayth, lystening to false spirites, and to the doctrine of Diuels by the hypocrisie of vayne speakers, whose conscience is marked with a hot iron they forbyd to marrye, they commaund to abstaine from meates, which are created of God to be eaten of the faythfull, and of those which knowe the truth with thankefulnes.1.

To these woordes of the Apostle, the decrees of Popes are cleane opposit, which doo forbyd Byshops, Priests, and all the Clergie to marrie, with this interdiction, that if they doo so, they must be remoued from the Ecclesiasticall calling, and, which is more, if they haue alreadye contracted Matrimonie, without any respect of irregularship they must be seperated, and shalbe compelled by the Ordinarie, and remedies of excommunication to refuse their wiues. &amp;c. By which it is apparant, that the Papistes are those, which in the latter dayes should depart from the faith, and by the Diuels prouoking vnder hypocrisie,

                  arly commend: and also receyuing of certaine meates, which (as Paule dooth witnes) God hath created for the faithfull to be eaten with thankesgeuing. And yet notwithstanding these, as I said before, decrees of Popes, although they be cleane contrarie to the wyll of God, haue had more aucthoritie among men, than the eternall woord of God. Bycause those, although in deede wicked and vngodly, yet haue been called holy, and Catholike, and they which haue been conuersant in them, our chiefe masters, and doctors were counted, to whom the sacred Scripture was most vnsauerie. So that to take an honest woman to wyfe (which Paule commaunded his Byshops to doo) was dishonestie, and more dishonestie than either openly to vse a concubine, or secretly to commit adulterie. Also on the Friday to eate flesh, was a great sinne and heresie: and yet on that day to follow drunkennes and carnalitie, was no shame, but highly commended. Likewyse to heare the blasphemous Masse, to reuerence an Idolatrous peece of breade, and to carry the same about with a pompous Procession, was no impietie but good Religion, and yet to celebrate the Supper of the Lord soberly according to his institution, was no godlynes, but great abhomination. At a woord, the doctrine of Christ, a good and godly conuersation, was of them suspected, as erronious: &amp; yet forsooth their deuilish decrees, and damnable doctrine was holy, and nothing pernicious. Their impuritie, great pietie: their hypocrisie, great holynes, their damnable ceremonies, was the diuine seruice of God. So that all Christian Religion was vtterly banished, and no token of the true seruice of God could be seen. But now in

the yeare of the Lorde a thousand fyue hundred ninetie and three after Christes birth, which is the fyue thousand, fyue hundred, and fiue yeare after the world was made, that expiring of fyue hundred yeares draweth nygh, in which these decrees of Popes gathered together by publike aucthoritie to the great defacing of Gods woord, and the merites of Christ, shall haue theyr ende. Wherefore a woonderfull and vndoubted hope of things to come may be conceyued of things past, that about that tyme shalbe that vniuersall destruction of all the worlde, and glorious comming of the Lorde. by which all these Popishe decrees shall come to naught, and by the iust iudgement of God, as erroneous, and blasphemous, be cast into eternall fire, because they haue wickedly burned all the true interpretations of the Propheticall, and Apostolicall scriptures, and cruelly martyred the learned ministers, and true professors of Christes Religion. Vndoubtedly that number of fyue hundred yeeres in lyke manner as the others spoken of before, doo presage the same lyke thing: the Prognostications of the starres (as may be gathered by that which is spoken) take their effect about the same tyme: The preaching of the Gospell, and other tokens mentioned of Christ is gonne before: and the Iustice of God especially dooth exacte the same.

               And (that we may returne to Plato) he sayth in another place very well:De re pub. lib. 2. That God is an eternall spirit and cause of all goodnes in the world. Because in the creation of good things he shewed his vnspeakeable power, wisedome, and goodnes: and i

Forsooth euen such, as through contemplating of heauenly things, should rather seeme to liue without, than in the body, and rather to God, than themselues, and be delyghted in him alone. But that we may go higher, to the manifesting of that which I am about, Let vs behold how all things in the world do stand, and we shall find them in a certayne order, measure, and number, to be so

linked togeather, that they cannot be seperated. The Heauen, the Planets, and the Starres keepe their certayne order, and tyme, and they appoynt the certayne course of euery thing: and cause the change and alterations in the bodyes both of men and beasts, and in his due time euery hearbe, is brought forth. Al which things are so apparant in our eyes, as of them we can not doubt. And yet all these things, by the incomprehensible wisedome and prouidence of almighty God, are kept in their certaine measure and number. For God by a certaine measure (as it were) hath placed the earth, like a round Globe in the myddle (so that no way it can fall) the which the whole Firmament of heauen dooth compasse, and in the space of twenty and foure houres is carryed rounde about the same. Also he hath appoynted a certaine and iust number of all things: to wyt, the foure seasons of the yeare, and their monethes, dayes, the certaine houres of euery day, the minutes of euery houre, and lastly the certaine endes of tyme, by a certaine incomprehensible consent of the Starres, and numbers among them selues. Not as though the Starres and numbers without the first cause, can bring any thing to passe, but because in their gouernment, and second operation of the Starres, they represent before our eyes, 
                     •

                  fusion, that he can doo all things at his pleasure, by a certaine inordinate affection as men do: but he is a God of order, a keeper of order in his things created, from which he dooth not rashly digresse, although he tyeth nor hym selfe therto, that he wyll not, or cannot alter it (when his glory by his secret counsaile, and the safegard of the Church, requyre the same.) For in the staying and goyng backe of the Sonne in the tyme of Iosua, and Ezechias kyng of Iuda, and by other diuine

myracles, he sheweth the contrary. And yet without all controuersie, the eternall prouidence of God, and Predestination hath appoynted by a certaine measure and number, from the begynnyng of the world, to the end of the same, as it were by rule, certaine termes in the course of the Starres, by which, great habilitie is gyuen to a skilfull and learned man, to iudge of things to come, euen as by a Dyall made by a woorkman in proportion and nūber, things to come are foreseene, because Arte, as nigh as may be, imitateth God and nature.

So that I trust, that the commyng of the Sonne of God to iudgement, wyll shortly ensue, in which, all impietie, lying, and dooing of wrong, through the tyrannie of Antichrist, the Diuell, and his members, shalbe taken awaye: and the euerl

               But that more playnly these things may be vnderstoode, it must be knowen what we call Arithmeticall proportion, and Geometricall, according to iustice: and also how these two proportions are perfectlye contayned in this yeere of the .5555. which in the yeere .95. ensuing,The definitiō of Arithmetycall proportion. shalbe the the yeres since the worlds foundation. Arithmeticall proportion is, when as three, or moe numbers being set, all without any respect of proportions doo differ by equall ods, as .1.2.3.4.5. Here continually one number differs from the other but in vnitie, as also .2.4.6.8.10. in which one differeth frō another, but the nūber of two.Melant. in Epit. mo. Phi. And therfore we see in the fifth number which is the last, an Arithmeticall proportion to be contayned, because it hath in it this excellencie, that it comprehendeth in it selfe, and that fitly, all vnities, of which all other numbers doo consist, be they euen or odde, to the which no naturall, be he neuer so talkatiue, can attayne by numbring. This Arithmeticall proportion, Aristotle ascribeth to the exchangeable iustice. For euen as euery number playnly doth differ from other in equall summe: so a great equalitie, there must be between the ware, and the price, least while one is iniured, the other by his losse and dammage become riche. The Geometrical proportion is,Geometrical proportion whar, when as three or moe summes being set, we consider not the difference of numbers, but marke the equalities of proportion. For euen as fiue referred to .50. hath the proportion of quantitie, so hath .50. to .500. and as .50. to .500. so .500. to .5000. all which are in the proportion of tenne. But Plato said, that this Geometricall proportion can doo much,In Gorgia. both betweene God

and man: and that the state of a common weale is then best, when it consisteth of a Geometricall equalitie, which appointeth persons, and ordaineth offices according to the greatnes and worthines of giftes, and bestoweth rewardes to worthy persons, whereof it is well called of the Philosophers a distributiue Iustice. For examples sake, as in the gouerning of a ship, the ruling of the same is not committed to any man, but vnto him which is skilfull, and for his cunning, and well guiding therof he receyueth a better stipend than other which are vnskilful: so also to a vertuous, cunning, iust, constant, and graue person, the administration of the common Weale is to be committed, and withall a woorthy honour: least by a gouernment, which is rude, wicked, and tyrannicall, the common weale be brought to destruction. Also in the affaires of priuate persons, this Geometricall equalitie is to be obserued. For a greater honour and reuerence is due to the Magistrate, than to an other man, to our parentes than to straungers: to an old man, than to a yong, to a learned, than to an ignorant. Also we ought more entirely to loue our wyues and children, than other folkes, as likewise according to the doctrine of Paul,

because they are good Citizens. For godlines, humanitie, bounteousnes, fidelitie, vprightnes and true religion, stretche farder than doth outward behauiour the rule of the lawe, and hypocrisie.A true Christian For the true disciple of Christ being of one minde and meaning wyth his master Christ, will be so farre from enriching hymself by empouerishing another, and hyding that which may hurt his neighbour, that by no meanes he wyll preferre his owne priuate prosperitie, before the common profit.
               And rather will forgoe life, and liuing, then doo that which is not seemely for any man, much lesse for him which is by calling holy, and by professing a Christian. Good God, how farre from this mynde and purpose are most of our buiers, and sellers estranged? For as yet we talke not of those which are well knowen to deceyptfull, faithlesse, abhominable, and common vserers, but of such as in the sight of al men seeme and be accompted honest, and good Citizens. For euen these doo perswade themselues that they deale vprightly, if onely they giue true measure for their money, not considering at all, that to take excessiue gaynes, is to doo wrong, and altogeather agaynst iustice: not considering, that it is all one in respect of equalitie (from which all iustice dooth spring) to set too great a price, and to sell by false waightes and measures, by which reason the vnequalnes of price and and ware, may well be called false measure: for if it were demaunded of them, whether it were meete to bring him into the right way, which is out of the way? or to shewe him the ready way, which is altogeather ignorant of the same? or if he were not much to be blamed which seeing his neighbour goe astraye, will without calling him backe, let him goe on forward? I am sure they wil confesse, both him to be a noughty

man, and this no honest man, for his labour. And yet forsooth, is it a false opinion which we are in, when frō a general propositiō, we come to a particular contrary to their minds: in deede it is more agreeable to iustice, not to hurt a mā by the purse, or losse of goods, than to shew him the ready way, which knowes it not. But I pray you, what is the cause of these sinister opinions? sith the reason is alone, and nothing more agreeing with iustice. Truely selfe loue, couetousnes, and an ouer great care of this lyfe, from which Christ earnestly dooth call vs. But let vs thinke that saying of Cicero, to be most true: Quum quid quispiam sciat, &amp;c.

And moreouer he sayth: Si vituperandi sunt qui reticuerunt, quid de his existimandum est qui orationis vanitatem adhibuerunt? That is. If they are to be dispraised which keepe a thing close, what shall we thinke of those which haue vsed vaine woordes? And therfore sayth Syrach very well:Syrach. 27. 
                  As a naile in the wall sticketh fast betweene two stones, so dooth sinne sticke betweene the buyer and the seller.
               
               Likewise, much lesse is the Geometrical proportion kept in this wicked world. For the wicked &amp; vnlearned beyng in face impudent, and in behauiour egregious Parasites, are exalted to great honour, &amp; glorious offices, when as men famous, as well for learning, as Religion, be eyther in Court cōtemned, or of Sycophants defaced, or vnworthely disgraded, for some light offence: as happened to Beliserius, who by Iustinian lost his eyes: For darknes cannot abyde the light, and bold ignorance through her marueilous impudencie, doth set her selfe against learnyng and knowledge. For as

                  Quintilian dooth witnes, Quo quisque minus valet, hoc se magis attollere, et dilatare conatur: The least of power,
                  Quintil. lib. 2. Cap. 3. 
                  the most vaineglorious. And againe: Quo minus sapiunt, minus habent pudoris: The more foole, the more impudent. Nowe therefore, sith among the learned, or (as Plato saith) among Philosophers, the contrary dooth happen, no marueyle if the vnlearned haue them in contempt. Yet Plato woulde haue it otherwise in his common Weale,Plato de Ropub. lib. 5. where either Philosophers shoulde beare the sway, or those which ruled, should be learned in Philosophie, or (which we doo adde) at the least haue such about them, whose counsaile they might vse and folow. Moreouer, sith the Lord God, for his electes sake (for whose cause all things are kept) hath created all things, it foloweth out of the woorde of God, and his diuine Iustice, that al things in the world are due vnto the elect and godly, not to the wicked and reprobate. But it falleth out farre otherwise in the world, where the wicked doo flourish in riches, and are preferred: but the godly doo perish with pouertie, and are left as a pray to their enemies. Also Christ the onely begotten sonne of the euerlastyng God, which is the maker both of heauen and earth, and Lord of Lords, hath witnessed of hym selfe, that in this world he had not where to hyde his head, but was before the world, a very abiect,Matth. 8. and made away by a most odious death, euen the death of the Crosse: Yet notwithstanding his aduersary, that sonne of perdition, sitteth (as God) in the temple, ruling with two swords: flourishing with riches, power, and glory, and is with all reuerence called our Holy father, and worshipped as the deputie of Christ him self. And therfore by these we plainly perceyue, that in this world no Geometricall equalitie according to the distributiue iustice (which is the best) is any where obserued, But yet

(sith God is iust) all kinde of iustice necessarily to all must be extended, so that to the worthy, all things must be giuen, but from the wicked, all things which falsely they haue taken to themselues, and abused to the molesting of the godly, shall vtterly be taken away. Wherefore needes must there be another lyfe after this, and therfore for those reasons alledged we set downe, that the Lorde God dooth foreshowe to the studious, by this dubble proportion or equalitie of numbers, a certaine finishing of things with an vtter destruction of this wicked world, and withall, he vndoubtedly dooth giue vs to vnderstand, and signifies the beginning of the building anewe of the eternall kingdome of Christ, which with vpright iudgement, and by equalitie in euery respect, he will establish perpetually, and make it endure world without end.
            
            
               ¶ Of the number of fiue, the fiue-folde forme, and of the Greeke letter χ.
               
                  SIth by that which is vttered we haue showen, that euen fyue hundred, and euery 50. yeere, there doo commonly happen some singular alterations in the Churche, and common Weales, it followeth very likely, that the eightie eyght yeeare nowe at hand, which is the yeere of the world .5550. shalbe fully perfect to which if but fiue were added, it commeth to passe (as a little before

it is sayd) that the whole number, in the yeare .93. will be proportionable, according to Arithmeticall and Geometricall equalitie. And therfore they doo seeme to presage vnto vs a golden world in deede, and euerlasting to come, in which all the iustice of God shalbe fulfilled, and haue her full strength, and vertue. Yet I do not denie, but it is my saying, that the lowest number of fiue from the first and last, doo offer vnto vs many things agreeing very well to our purpose: especially sith which hath been sayd so meete in one, and many things els both in the Byble, and Sibillian Oracles are to be founde lyke vnto them: all which we plainly see are grounded in the perpetuall ordinance, and prouidence of God, not by chaunce.
               Of the number of fiue is termed the fiuefold forme, which of all other,Quintil. lib. 8. cap. 3. (as Quinctilian recordeth) in setting of trees, maketh the fayrest Orchard, and is such, as howsoeuer one behold the same, it is direct and and strayte. Then is a thing sayd to be fiuefoulde, or of fiue manner of wayes, when the disposition thereof is such, as two partes thereof togeather with the third of another sort, opposit to themselues by equall space, doo seeme (howsoeuer you turne your selfe) to haue the forme of fiue, or this letter V, by which the Latines doo note fiue. But if fiue in number were set downe by other figures, or by the same, in like order vnderneth, they doo represent the Greeke letter χ. and the lattine χ, which dooth signifie tenne. From thence I thought, sith in the fore mentioned proportionable number of yeares, the number of fiue is lowest, and besides dooth represent these two letters, from which also by an equalitie of Geometricall proportion, it goeth foreward by the distance of tenne, I thought I say, whether this also did signifie any singular thing worthy to be marked? For the Greeke

letter χ. is the first letter in the name of Christ 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  :Of the greeke letter. χ and Iohn in the Reuelation by 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , commaundeth all of vnderstanding to count the comming of the Beast rising from the earth, and hauing the two hornes of the Lambe, which are .666. yeares, so significant are these Greeke letters. But in the explications of this place Bullinger teacheth, that the account of .666. yeares must begin, when Iohn sawe his Reuelation about the ende of the raigne of Domitian, which was from the byrth of Christ the .97. yeare: so that to the filling of the first hundred yeare from Christes natiuitie three yeeres be wanting. If therefore these yeares were added to an hundred, and they added to the number of the Beastes name .666, and three yeeres were taken from the first hundred, we shall haue the yeare of the Lord to be .763. which was the .13. yeare of Pepines raigne: about which tyme Pepine graunted vnto the Pope, his chiefe power and aucthoritie, contrarie to the minde of Leo Isauri

                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                   or enemie to images. Therfore by these letters we know the time of the comming of the beast with two hornes like vnto the Lamb: euen as Henry Bullynger dooth prosecute the same more at large, and prooueth the same by Sibyls Oracles. Moreouer when we count all markes of the letters in this name 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  ,Of the woord 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                   if (as it is in Sibyls verses) E. be added, we shall plainly finde that in these also the beginning of the tyme when the kingdome of Christ should be preached, and also the beginning of the fall of Antichrist also in the former his comming was signifyed. All the Greeke letters in this name, expresse this number .1485.
               Now if the yeares, which come from that yeare, in which Iesus, by his resurrection from the dead, and ascention

into heauen, he had declared hym selfe to be Christ the king of the Iewes, and the sonne of the eternal God, were compared to this tyme, when Luther and other learned men did by the pure Euangelicall doctrine of the free remission of sinnes in Iesus Christ, driue away the grosse darknes of papisticall ignorance, and made the sonne of righteousnesse Iesus Christ our Lord, to shine againe, we shall euidently perceiue this tyme rightly to be comprehended in these numbers. For if to this number .1485. the yeares from the Natiuitie of our Lord, to his resurrection, which were .33. were added, then shall the yeare of our Lord, a thousand, fiue hundred, eighteene arise, in which, and afterward, many learned men began to set them selues against the darknes of Papistes. Now because this lowest number of fiue, a perfect Arithmeticall, to that Geometrical proceeding by a fiuefold, and very goodly forme, dooth as it were in colours, place before our eyes, the Greeke Letter χ. which is the first Letter in the name and office of our eternall king, and also being a litle turned, representeth the Crosse, that is, the badge and noble signe of Christ, whose last letter of the Nominatiue case is X: by those things I fall into this consideration, that about these tymes foretold, the commyng of the Lord to iudgement, is presignified, by which he shall shew hym selfe to all the world, to be Christ the sonne of God, promised to the fathers, afterward seene of the Iewes, whom they dyd abhorre, and at length crucifie, whose token (according to the iudgement of the Fathers, and Sibylles prophesies) also in the commyng of the Lord to all the faythfull, shalbe like a comfortable Trumpet, but in the sight of the worlde a 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , or stumblyng blocke to the world. That this is no vaine imagination, although it be no certaine demonstration, many

such like reasons and examples cause me to thinke. For in many places of the Scripture, we often find, that the Lord hath been greatly delighted in geuyng them, either by plaine wordes, or secret prouidence, fyt and proper names, by whom it hath pleased hym, for the glory of his name, to bestowe vppon his Church any great benefite. Hereof is Abram called of God, Abraham, and the forerunner of the Sonne of God, is called Iohn, and the Sonne of God hym selfe receyued a name from the Angell, and was called Iesus, that is, a Lord, and Sauiour, redeeming the worlde from sinne: which afterward receyued a name, according to his office▪ and was called Christ, that is, Annoynted, annoynting vs with his holy spirit, that so we might acknowledge him to be our Christ. Wherfore let it not seeme straunge vnto vs, if those letters, by the diuine prouidence of God, doo containe many and great mysteries within them. For the Lorde God by a certaine incomprehensible prouidence, not according to mans wisedome, or foreknowledge of things to come, doth gogouerne the thoughtes and tongues of men, that many men, and Cities, in which the Lord God wyll shewe eyther his singular fauour, and marueilous woorkes of mercie, or his anger and heauie displeasure, should receyue fatall names accordingly. And therefore by this reason it came to passe no doubt, that king Dauid, which signifyeth well beloued, should receyue a proper name: as also the Prophet Daniell his, signifying the iudgement of the Lorde. Because in him the Lord God dyd shewe foorth his singular kindnes manye wayes, and in this his secrete iudgement concerning the Empyres of the world, and their endes, and of the two commings of Christ, the first vyle in the fleshe, the second victorious, to iudgement. So likewyse Babylon, receyued a fit name, but in a diuers respect, not onely

because that in her there was made a confusion of tongues: but especially because of the confounding of manners, and wickednes, of Religion, and Idolatry together. Wherefore at the length it vtterly came to naught, and there is become a meere confusiō in deed of all beastes and serpents. By a contrary ende Ierusalē tooke her name, because she should see the peace of God in Christ, which afterward she dyd furiously dispise, I haue heard moreouer of Melanthon, which also in a certaine booke he dyd publish, that that name Emda, a towne of the Orientall Frisia, and my natiue countrey, hath her d

               So that this number of fyue in the threefold, according to Arithmetike, may seeeme the most perfect, and by many figures as it were to represent those three alterations of tyme, of which, before we made mention, whose end in a iust quantitie of numbers, perfectly set of God hym selfe, ought certainly to be looked for. Neither can any doubt, but that this figure contaynyng a marueilous equalitie, and agreement of numbers, in a very great inequalitie (as it may seeme) doth

signifie some great mysteries, as well Diuine, as Philosophical, the which, (least in these which may perchāce seeme more darke, then many of Platoes numbers, I be ouer tedious to the Reader) I leaue to the consideration of the studious. But (that we may somewhat returne to that we haue in hand) although the circular and round figure, be of all others, in sight most fayre, yet (as is the whole world) is it very vnstable, subiect to alteration, and full of troubles. But the square forme is firme, constant, and stable: and howe soeuer it be placed, is alwayes one and the same. And therefore dooth Aristotle compare the same to a good and honest man,Arist. li.

Mat. 21. Apo. 21. onely excepted: but in the lyfe to come, wee shall be such with Christ hym selfe. And therefore dooth Iohn describe the holy Hierusalem, descending from heauen, to be foure square: in which, her perfection, constancie, and continuance,,Apo. 21. is noted. Because by no yll fortune it shalbe weakened, there shalbe no lamentation, no sorow, no death: but perfect ioy, great myrth, and a lyfe endued with all spirituall riches, and euerlasting, of which the faithfull, in the commyng of the Lord, shalbe partakers. Whose most ioyful comming about those notable tymes aboue mentioned, we looke for, and long exceedingly for our redemption.

                     esTo these may be added, that in the yeare .88. which is the yeare of the world, 5550. such a yeere shall ensue, as it is from the creation of the world, by seuens, as it were by degres &amp; steps we may ascend: as also the yere before that, 87. which is the yere .5549. to which number auncient writers haue ascribed much: partly because it is a square number, of which aboue it is spoken,

partlye also, because it ariseth of seuen, seuen times dubbled. But experience, and the assertion of the learned, proues, that euery seuen yeere from their byrth, to their death, is very daungerous, contrary to noble wits, and notable men of the best nature by a certaine agreement they haue with their maker. For sith all that is made hath been created by the wonderfull wisedome of God, and by a certaine secret power ingrafted, tendes to his natural conseruation, &amp; seekes that is best for his good estate, it very likely appeares, that famous men, haue a more affinitie with theyr second byrth, the most artificiall nature beyng made of God, than eyther beast, or beastly men: and therefore that they are of God more tyed wyth nature her self to a certaine tyme. But these are counted especially climacterian yeeres, which by seuenfolde ascend, as is the 21. yeere, which dooth consist of three times seuen. such be .42. and 63. yeeres, counting aswell by nynes, as by seuens, and therefore be they iudged to be very hurtfull to notable fellowes. For in that yeare of their lyfe dyed Luther, Melanthon, Martyr, and other excellent men in all ages: as also Erasmus is thought to haue left this world in the 70. yeare of his age. But whether the lyke yeeres be fatall to all the worlde as they are to particular men, we leaue it to the iudgement of others. Yet if these things mentioned for a certaine lyke proportion of members, do include any secrete reason, bycause (as Plinie sayth, harmonia rerum naturā sibi ipsam congruere cogit:
                  Libr. 2. ca. 10
                        •
                     . the concente of things makes nature to agree to her selfe: it is credible and lykely, that the last ende of the world and of all mankind, dooth consist of lyke proportion of numbers, as dooth a part. Because man is in deede a part of the world, and therefore is rightly called of the Philosophers 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  : Againe of thinges past, thinges to

come are gathered since the course of tyme, the inclinations of the starres, the circuite of fiue hundred yeares, and that singuler proportion of numbers, in the number of fyue (of which hetherto we haue spoken) come to passe about the same tyme altogether, and consist of one reason. All which (to speake the truth) were coniectures of no waight, and could proue nothing, did not Christ and Paule in plaine woordes signifie vnto vs, that the worldes ende, together wyth the glorious comming of the sonne of God to iudgement are at hand: and as it were at our doores, when we shall plainely perceiue the Gospell of the kingdome of Christ to be preached throughout all the world, and the sonne of perdition by the spirit of Gods mouth to be so confounded, that nothing shal seeme to be behind, but his vtter defamation: and to this purpose finally doo serue other coniectures, as is aboue declared.
               Here by reason of numbers, one thing more worthy to be marked, because it agrees with that aboue mentioned, comes into my mynde, the which was told me by an honest man, skilfull in Astronomy, and Geometrie, and of good credit. For he sayd, that in the .1568. when Ericus King of Suethland (which then was in armes) had by force taken from the Liuonians, a certayne Castle situated in the Iland Osila, called Sonenborch, he by good fortune, was lodged with a certayne noble Astronomer,Of the golden number. with whom by reason of their studies he was very familiar. Being in talke one day, he brake out into these words, and said, O miserable, and hotrible dayes, which from the yeare .1570. now at hand, shall ensue, and continue many yeares. His guest asked him how so? He aunsweared: Because, when the number of the yeares of Christes Natiuitie dooth containe within it, for certayne

yeares the Golden number of euery yeare, which is seldome seene, then it hath of long tyme been obserued, and histories doo witnes the same, that infinite calamities, and intolerable troubles haue chaunced. But now from the 70. yeare now at hand, vntill the yeare .77. there shalbe among the yeares of the birth, of Christ, and between the golden number of euery yeare such an agreement: as .1.5.7. which being ioyned togeather by addition, do make .13. Now this number .13. is the Golden number of the yeare 1570. &amp; in the six other immediatly ensuing. And therfore he did affirme that in that yeare the watrie Element should gouerne, and should presage great ouerflowings of water. But in the yeare 73. which is the middle of these seuen, the Earthy Element, for some notable cause, should lose of his vertue, by reason whereof, a wonderful scarsetie of all things should ensue, as afterward it came to passe. Moreouer, he said, that in .76. yeare, the aire should be corrupt, and the plague should be in euery place. After which should succeede three yeares, the first of which .1577. dooth by the fore sayd reason comprehend in it twentie in number, and if from this number .19. which is the chiefest goldē number, and the golden number to the yeare going befor
                     •
                  , were taken away, then one, which is the beginning of the number, and the golden number of thys yeare dooth remayne, and so in the other two following, and no further. And therefore in the yeare .77. the firie Element shall trie his force, and breede discention and warres, and agayne in the yeare .78. a greeuous pestilence shall dispatch verye many. And in the yeare .79. agayne shall come great scarsetie of all fruit. Finally he sayd, because .19. is the highest golden number, it shalbe found that that number from the .70. yeare (when this first agreement

began (counting .19. shall as it were by a finger, poynt vnto the .88. yeare. For from the .70. yeare to the .88. so many yeares come betweene: about which tyme (according to the opinions almost of all Mathematicions) verie dyreful, and miserable things shalbe come to passe. Because by good experience, he boldly sayd, that the Lord God maker and keeper of all order, did orderly by a certain number, measure, and aspect of the starres, rule and gouern the whole Firmament of heauen.
               And therefore, because of these things which haue ben spoken we do wel ynough, and sufficiently know, that the kingdome of God is at hand: let vs lyft vp our heades to heauen, let vs contemne all worldly things: let euery man cast away securitie and desire of pleasure, by whose inticementes, the mind is suppressed: let euery man frame himselfe to learne what is good, and godlines: let hym prepare himselfe to the Crosse, let hym profit in good woorking, in true calling vppyn the name of the Lord, and put on the armour of righteousnes, that if the aduersarie challenge vs into combate, we may by no flaterie, by no force, by no terrour, by no tormentes be drawen and pluckt away from Christ. The almightie God be present with vs continually with his diuine asistance, and defende vs euermore agaynst all the inuasions of the diuell by which he would bring vs from our faith, driue vs out of hope, and so bar vs from our kingdome which is in heauen.
            
            
               
               ¶ Of the manner and effect of the Lordes commyng to iudgement, with an exhortation to watchfulnes.
               
                  HEtherto by diuine testimonies it hath ben shewed, that certainly the world must be destroyed, and also by Oracles, and probable reasons and coniectures it hath been proued, that the glorious comming of the Lorde is at our doores and cannot be farre of, although we knowe not the certaine yeare, daye, and houre of hys commyng. It followeth therefore, that both for the edifying of the Churche, and refourming of our manners, that we alledge testimonies out of holye Scripture both of the manner of the commyng of the Sonne of God to iudgement, and of the effect of the same. After that the Sonne of God Christ our Lorde and Sauiour, by the secrete counsayle of God the Father, had determyned for our saluations, and satisfying the wrathe of God, to suffer death, he tooke vppon him the shape of a seruaunt, was in the worlde poore and miserable, tooke paciently all tauntes and mockes, and suffred himself to be condemned though vniustly, and shamefully to be crucifyed: but in his seconde commyng he shall not onely appeare lyke a chiefe Monarch of thys world, but shall shewe hymselfe to be a King

since the begynning of the worlde, and him which cast the myghtiest from theyr seate of Maiestie, and exalted the humble,Daniel.

Also he shall declare himselfe to be the Sonne of God, coequall in dietie wyth God his eternall Father: so that then the course of things shall be chaunged, for he in that daye shalbe iudge, and iustly condemne those, of whom he was iudged, and against all equitie together wyth his members condemned, and which haue obstinately and wythout reason persisted in impietie. For the wordes of Christ in the .25. of Matthew, by which accordyng to the capacitie of man, the last iudgement is depainted, are these: Cum venerit silius hominis in maiestate sua, &amp; omnes angeli cum eo, tunc sedebit super sedem maiestatis suae, &amp; congregabuntur ante eum omnes gentes (Nemo enim qui vnquam vixit,
                  Math. 25.

                        •
                     , possidete paratum vobis regnum à constitutione mundi, &amp;c. Et his qui à sinistris, dicet: Discedite à me maledicti in ignem aeternū, qui paratus est Diabolo &amp; Angelis eius. That is, When the sonne of man shall come in his maiestie, and all his Angels with him, then shall he sit vppon the throne of his maiestie, and all Nations shalbe gathered tegether before hm, (for none which euer was, is, or shalbe, from this iudgement shalbe exempted) and he shall separate them, euen as a shepheard doth segregate the sheepe from the goates and shall place the sheepe on his right hand. Then shall the King saye vnto those which are on his right hand: Come ye blessed of my Father, possesse the kingdome prepared for you, from the beginning of the world. &amp;c. And to those which are on his left hand, he shall say: Depart from me ye accursed into euerlasting fire, which is prepared for the Diuell, and his

Angels. Because these haue doone no deedes of charitie, but haue continually rebelled against God: but these haue doone much better, because by reason of their fayth, they haue fulfylled all woorkes of mercies and haue been with one minde with God.
               In which Sermon, Christ dooth applie himselfe to mans capacitie, and borroweth his similitude from an vpright King and Iudge of this world, which dooth pronounce lawfull sentence, whether it be of absolution, or condemnation, according to our woorkes be they good or bad, and by and by dooth execute the same. Lykewyse Paule dooth shewe the manner, how Christ in his last comming shall appeare to al the elect which euer were, or shalbe, in these wordes. Hoc enim vobis dicimus in verbo Domini, quiae nos qui viuimus, quiresidui sumus in aduentu Domini, non praeuentemus qui dormierunt. Quoniam ipse Dominus in iussu &amp; in voce Archangeli, &amp; in tuba Dei descendet de caelo, &amp; mortui qui in Chri

                     o sunt, resurgent primi. Deinde nos qui viuimus, simul rapiemur cum illis in nubibus, obuiam Christo in aera, &amp; sic semper cum Domino erimus. This we say vnto you in the word of the Lord,
                  1. Thes. 4. 
                  that we which liue, and are the remnaunt in the Lordes comming shall not goe before thē which sleepe. Because the Lord himselfe, in the cōmaundement and voyce of an Archangle, and in the trumpet of God; shall descend from heauen, and they which are dead in Christ, shall first arise. Afterwarde we which doo liue, shall togeather with them be caried in the Cloudes to meete Christ in the the ayre, and so shall be with God for euer. Also Paule teacheth: that in a moment, in the twinckeling of an eye, in the last sound of the Trumpet the dead shall ryse vncorrupt,1. Cor. 15. and those which are liuing shall vppon the suddayne be changed to incorruption, and immortalitie.Apo. 20.

whyte Throne in the sight of God, and the bookes to bee opened, and the dead to be iudged out of that which was written, according to their woorkes. And he which was not found written in the booke of lyfe, was cast into a burning lake. But Sybyll Erithraea in in her verses called Acrostichides,

               Now I hope these testimonies alledged, may suffice to proue vnto vs, the manner of the commyng of the Sonne of God, and of the worldes ouerthrow. For it is not for man to speake more of the same, then he

hath learned out of holy Scripture. Yet somewhat longer wyll we tarry in the greatnesse of an happy life, and paynes of the vngodly: and yet no further wyll we goe, then the holy Scripture dooth leade vs to consider. Certayne it is, and without all controuersie, that nothing can be imagined of greater happinesse, and better estate, than is God the chiefest good: and that that felicitie which is in God, is as great and insearchable, as is his omnipotencie, by which he created both heauen and earth of nothing, by his woorde alone. And therfore it foloweth, that those which are of one mynde in Iesu Christe with God, be also partakers of those goodes which are in God, be also as beloued children in Christ, and heyres of all their fathers riches, which are infinite and incomprehensible. And therfore Paul saith out of Esay:
                  1. Cor. 2. Esay. 64. 
                  That the eye hath not seene, nor the eare heard, nor hath it entred into the hart of man, what God hath prepared for such as loue hym. But those celestiall and inuisible are not so apparant, and shine before our eyes, as do earthly and visible thyngs, to which we are too too greatly addicted, and therfore the holy Ghost by Iohn in his Reuelation, helping the weaknesse of our iudgement, dooth liken the kingdome of God to a certaine great and large citie, which he dooth call the holy Hierusalem,
                  Apo. 21. whose gates are of precious stones, and whose walles and streates are of pure golde, then the which nothing is more excellent in the sight of men. And he dooth also call that citie, (of the which all the elect shalbe perpetuall citizens) Tabernaculum Dei cum hominibus, &amp; habitabit cum eis, &amp; ipsipopuli eius erunt, &amp; ipse Deus cum eis erit: The Tabernacle of God with men, and he shall dwell with them, and they shalbe his people, and he shalbe their God. Finally, that there is the fulnesse of all felicitie, where God is all in all, in which place we shall know hym perfectly

euen as he is. And therfore true is that voyce, which Iohn in his Reuelation heard from heauen: Beati mortui qui in Domino moriuntur: Blessed are the dead which dye in the Lord: or those are blessed, which the Lord at his commyng shall finde vigilant, wise, and sober.
               Now, if nothing be more happy (as in deede nothing is) thē to inioye the sight of the euer liuing God, and to be inheritours of eternall lyfe: certainly by a contrary, nothing can be imagined more wretched and miserable, then with Diuels to be cast for euer out of the sight of God, into eternall torments and paines of hell, at whose very remembraunce, the Diuell hym selfe in an horrible rage dooth quake and tremble. For sith God is altogeather infinite, and his iustice incomprehensible, and sinnes be cleane contrary to his vnspeakeable iustice, it must needes folow, that they also must be punished with eternall paynes. And that this is true, our heauenly father sheweth most plainly in his only begotten sonne, which for our sake he sent into the flesh, that he might take vpon hym the forme of a seruaunt, and suffer death for our offences. For the iustice of God, for our sinnes in our flesh, dyd exact sufficient satisfaction, and his diuine pitie an infinite mercy towards all the elect. And therfore the Sonne of God, of one substance with his eternall father, and clearenesse of his glory, was almost compelled to subiect hym selfe vnder hym, that so he might pacifie Gods anger, and publish his vnspeakable mercye towards al mankynd: especially towards al them which would with a liuely faith take hold, and imbrace hym. Now that the mynd of man might conceiue the greatnes of Gods displeasure, agaynst our sinnes, the holy Scripture fetchyng similitudes from sensible things, dooth liuely set the same before our eyes, that so if our fleshly and flexible harts geue any credit to the manifest

woord of God, and be not hardened like stones, we might conceyue the greatnes of the same. For Christ dooth compare that eternall casting out of his fauour,Math. 25. Lucae. 13. M
                        •
                     tth. 13. Apo. 20.21, 22. to a very darke prison, to euerlasting fire, and vnquenchable, to extreme horror, with perpetual gnashing of the teeth: And Iohn in his Reuelation sayth, that the vngodly shalbe throwē into a fiery lake, full of Brimstone, in which they shalbe continually for euer tormented:: than the which, mans mynd can thinke nothing more horrible, more intolerable. All which Sibyl in her Oracles comprehended in these verses translated out of Greeke.
               Nec erit modus vllus eorum
               Ploratus, neque vox tristes distincta querelas
               Diuersas referet: verum sub nocte profunda
               Tartarea nigra, laniante dolore, profundum
               Clamorem tollent: atque in regione profana
               Ter tantum soluent, quantum fecere malorum,
               Igni confecti multo: tum dentibus omnes
               Stridentes, acri tabescent vique, sitique
               Optandum mori dicent. fugientque vocantes,
               Non iam mortis enim requiem, non noctis habebunt.
               Multa quidem frustra supremi numina Patris
               Orabunt: sed eos tunc auertetur apertè.
               O that blyndnes of mans mynde, and that madde doubting of these diuine promises of eternall lyfe: O that hardned and flintie hart of ours, which is not mooued, no not wyth these horrible threates of Gods heauie displeasure, but continuing securely in all impietie, neuer asketh pardon for such wilfull offending, and amendeth: euen as though the scripture were but lyes, and these diuine Oracles &amp; prophane fables. For by those things which haue come to passe, and by true demonstrations of Gods holy spirit, it is apparant, that nothing is more certaine than that the end of all

things hāgeth ō our shoulders. Truly great is the force of sinne, and marueilous is the rage of Satan in these latter dayes, he endeuoureth by all meanes that possibly he can to bring the whole world into a desperate securitie of life, that so he may haue many partakers of his tormentes in hell, from which there is no redemption. But how much better had it been, we had eyther neuer been borne, or at the least been voyde of reason with beastes and serpentes, or els been dispactht as soone as we were borne, if either we enioy not that place, for which we were created, or come not to the celestyall Paradyse, and to the marryage of our Spouse our Lord and sauiour Iesu Christ, where shalbe the ful abundance of all delightes, and perfection of all pleasure.
               Wherefore let vs cast from vs, both our carelesse securitie, and mistrust of the promises of God,An exhortation to watchfulnes. let vs renounce the diuell, and all the woorkes of the flesh, which are not sufferable by the word of God, &amp; let vs listē to the friendly admonitiō of our Sauiour Christ,Lucae. 21. warning vs in these wordes. Take heed, least at any tyme your mindes be ouerladen with surfetting, and dronkennes, and cares of this life, and so the suddayne day of the Lord take you vnawares: for euen as a snare, it shall come vppon all which sit vppon the face of the earth. Be ye watchfull therefore at all tymes: (and as Matthew addeth,Math. 24. 
                  because ye knowe not the houre in which your Lorde wyll come) praying, that ye may escape all these things which are to come, and may stand before the Sonne of man. For if the comming of theeues and stealers of our earthly goods be to be feared, with how great care, with how great diligence and watchfulnes, should we seeke to escape those enemies which would spoyle vs of our eternall riches, and kingdome of heauen. Here we vse great heede and wisedome to preserue our mortall

bodyes from hurt and daunger: but to saue our soules which are immortal from eternal paynes in hel, we are altogeather carelesse, nothing circumspect. And yet more would it beseeme the children of lyght, to be more carefull in seeking and keeping those things which are celestiall, than are wordlings paynfull in enriching themselues with such things as they are neither sure to enioy while they are aliue: nor can assure them of any ioy when they are dead. Yea let vs thinke and perswade our selues, that in the sight of God it is not shamefull, but abhominable, that the elect or chosen people of God which should be wise and circumspect, shall in this care be surpassed of wicked worldlings, and the more hyghly we displease our god, by how much the things which we so litle esteem, are more excellent than that which they so hunt after, betweene which (so surpassing is the treasure prepared for the godly) that there is no comparison. This exhortation though it pertayne to all men at all tymes, yet now especially in these daungerous dayes, in which, euery where we see so many by suddayne and strange endes to be taken out of this world. and because euery man shall dy (though the certayne houre and daye none dooth knowe) and shall either woofully be sent among the diuels in hell, or ioyfully be receyued into the felowship of the faythfull in heauen.
               Wherefore sith the spirit in the faythfull is willing, but the flesh very weake, and blinde in heauenly things, we are to beseech our heauenly father in continuall prayers, that by his holy spirit he would dayly more and more encrease, and strengthen our weake and feeble fayth. And therefore we hartely desire thee O eternall father, that thou wilt not vtterly breake vs, though we bowe not as we should, neither deale with

iustice, though we doo not our duties, according to thy wyll: but keepe vs good God in thy welbeloued sonne, illuminate our myndes with thy holy spirit, by which we may be prepared to all good workes, in true holines, &amp; newnes of life: that so with Paule we may desire to leaue this world &amp; to be with Christ, and so in the cōming of the Lord, being found ready with oyle in our Lamps, and adorned with our wedding garmentes, we may find entrance to the Lordes mariage, which thou for thy son, &amp; his beloued spouse the holy church hast prepared, and appointed, from the beginning of the world. To thee therfore O heauenly father, to thy only begotten sonne, and to the holy Ghost our comforter, be all prayse, honour, and glory, for euer and euer. Amen.
               FINIS.
