            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               TO THE MOSTE NOBLE VICTORIOVS AND redoubted prynce, HENRY the. VIII. by the grace of God, kynge of Englande, and of Fraunce, defendour of the faythe, Lorde of Irelande, and in erthe Supreme heed immediatly vnder CHRISTE, of the churche of Englande, Richarde Morysine his most humble and faithfull seruant, wyssheth all welthe, all honour, and triumphaunt victorie ouer all his ennemyes.
            
               
                  MOSTE HYGE excellente, and myghtye Prynce, mooste dere and dradde souerayne lorde, if the loue, whyche your hyghnesse beareth vnto this your noble empyre, stylle enforceth your graces harte, not onely to bestowe the better parte of all dayes, but of all nyghtes alsoo, in deuysynge in tyme of peace mooste godly lawes, statutes, and proclamations, for the tranquillitie and quietnesse of your subiectes sowles, in

tyme of warre, plattes, blocke howses, bulwarkes, walles, castelles, with other munitious, ingins, and fortresses, for the safetie and surenes of their bodies: if no so wernesse of peyne canne amoue your gracis thoughtes from contynuall trauayle, Can I without my great shame, not be styred to worke somewhat for my parte? He hath lyttell wylle to trauayle, lyttell loue to his countrey, that seeth before his eies, your hyghnesse thus occupied: and yet is nothynge pricked, to do that he thinketh may serue his countrey. Wyse writers feyne, that fond loue hath wynges, and seldome abydeth longe in a place, beynge hyther and thyther ledde by folye, and phansy: I can nat but also thynke, that discrete loue hath his wynges, and flyeth fast, where he seeth good may be done. Loue hath no leaden heles, and as he is quicke, so is al labour light, where loue hyreth the workeman. The fethers of his wynges are so softe, that if they lye betwene our shulders, and the burdeyn, the weight is lytel felt, though we beare neuer so heuy. Loue easily entertayneth

all powers of the harte, and withoute force compelleth theym all, to doo that, that duetie maye by any title chalenge of them. Your hyghnes welle declareth, that where occasion is, Loue can not be ydell. Lorde, howe may al englyshemen reioyce, that your grace neyther spareth, to vysite with your owne eyes, ye ruinous places of the see quostes, by whiche our enemies myght sodeynly inuade vs, neyther yet letteth, to worke with your own handes, continually manegynge tooles, continually inuentyng newe sortes of weapons, newe kindes of shyppes, of gunnes, of armure. As god helpe me, I can not see, whyche waye to wysshe greatter pleasure, greatter comforte, to all englyshe men, than that they all myght se, howe your grace spendeth all the hole day. I haue sene it, and nowe nothyng wonder, though traytours, ennemies to your hyghnes, haue bene atte their departure, compellyd to say so moche honour by your grace, as they haue sayde. I see, albeit Malyce maketh men in their lyfe tyme, to swarue, to saye and

doo moche otherwyse, than Trouthe is, that yet, the presence of deathe, feare of god, &amp; force of conscience, dryueth them to confesse trouthe, whan lyes wyll serue no longer, whan vyces appere to be as they are. Coulde syr Nycolas Carowe, haue fallen into treason, yf he hadde thought well vpon that in his lyfe tyme, whyche he confessed to be trewe, at his deathe? But I muste by youre gracis fauour, leaue of that, whyche I am fallen into by the way, and intreate of that, whiche I purposed to speake of. I haue longe sythens, bene moche desyrous, to dedicate some thynge of myne to youre hyghnesse, but fyndynge all my tryfles, farre to base, to meane, to humyle, to go abrode, vnder the name of soo noble and hygh a prince, I haue rather doone that becommed me, than folowed that I most desyred. but nowe, not withstandynge, that this my labour is full lyke the reste, rude, vnperfecte, and rather begun than fynyshed: yet perceyuynge youre grace, euen to thyrste the safetie of your people, the defence of this youre moosle noble

royalme, I coulde not, but for a season, a courtayne drawen betweene my weake eies, and the resplendent beames of your most clere maiestie, folow feruent desire, and humblye offer vnto your hyghnesse, this my rude translation, not doubtynge but as noble Xerxes thankfully receyued an handfull of water, of a poore manne, that so youre princely goodnesse, wolle take in good parte, this myne, what soo euer be, borne, and brought vp vndoubtedly, in good wylles howse.
            It hath ben somtyme moued, whether in warre, Polycy of mynde, or Strength of body, shulde do more. but longe experience, hath put this thyng so out of question, that in all battayles, the specialle prayse or disprayse remayneth to the Capitayne. Yea some men are not affrayde to affirme, that it is moche better to haue an armie, where the Capitayn is a lyon, and all the hoste fearefull dere, than to haue a dere the capitayne, and al the host lyons. Aiax was stronge, Ulysses wise: Homere gyueth moche more praise to the laste, than to the fyrste. Aiax was hardye

and valyant in fyght: but Ulisses knew the time &amp; place, where hardinesse might preuayle. Strength stryketh, but Policie prouydeth, that the stronge be not ouermatched, and that they bestowe strokes in a ryghte place, and at tyme conuenient. Many mo fieldes haue ben lost for lacke of polycie, than for wante of strength. many townes wonne by sleightes, whyche a longe season easilye were kepte ageynst greattest myght, strength, and force. Wherfore seinge present occasion requireth martiall feates to be knowen, and strength of bodye to be armed and anymated with wytte and polycie: I entendynge here to serue my countreye, founde nothynge so fytte, for thaccomplyshement of this my purpose, as to set out the Strategemes, sleightes, &amp; craftes, vsed by the noblest capytaynes, that all antyke hystories treate of. By redyng and reasonynge wherof, your gracis capitaynes shall not only increase and noryshe their imagination, inuention, and derteritie, in vsynge lyke sleightes, but easily escape al trappes, gynnes, and imbushementes,

layde for them. They shal also hereby perceyue, many swete baytes to couer sowre hokes. They shall lerne there to escape danger, where gret aduaÌ
               tage is offred. The noble capitaynes of England, haue oft declared, that they lytell nede any instructions, any bokes, to teach them to towse their enemies: &amp; yet it can hurte no man, to see those thynges practysed, by auncient capitaynes, whiche may gyue good occasioÌs, both warely to inuente newe polycies, and wysely to vse the olde. Noble hartes, vndoubtedly can not but desyre, to here of noble feates, and take pleasure in seinge, howe wytte with smalle force, ofte tymes worketh wonders, where excedynge greatte strength can nat auayle. If men be not wery, to playe a thousande tymes at one game, where eyther Fonde pleasure, or Uile gayne, or (whan it is best) helthe of body is sought: can any gentyll man be lothesome, to refreshe his mynde, to help his memorie, to kendle his courage with honeste delyte, of redynge or herynge suche thynges, as appertayne to thesafegarde

of body and goodes? to the purchasynge of honourable victories, fame, and renoume? The infirmitie of mans nature is suche, that bothe the senses of our body, and also the powers of oure mynde decay, and go to ruine, onles they be dayly refresshed and holpen. The eie is continually holpen, with clere lyghte, with freshe and comely colours, the smel with holsome ayre, and odours delectable, the taste asketh in his meates and drynkes, a dewe temperature. And as it is here, soo is it in the better parte of man, wytte, vnderstandynge, Memorie, and Inuention, with all the reste, qualities and ornamentes of the mynde, must be holpen with continuance of redynge, herynge, and reasonynge of mattiers, withoute whiche, they waxe rustye, they canker, and decaye. There is a tyme for al thinges, as Salomon wisely writeth. Whan tyme requyred peace, we talked lyttell of warre. Newe occasyons bryng matters, not thoughte vppon, in place. Tyme maketh euyl thynges not only coÌ
               parable with good, but good also. Whan

tyme is to pull downe, it is very folye to buylde. Whanne tyme byddeth slee, it is nothynge so good, to heale the diseased, as to kyll them that be not sycke. Whan tyme byddeth spende, sparynge is great waste. Loue is lewdenesse, whan tyme biddeth hate. Peace is to be refused, whaÌ tyme forceth men to warre. Wherfore, I haue besydes this my traÌslation, in an other tryfle of myn, exhorted al my contrey meÌ, peace laid aside, to prepare for warre, yt if nede constrein them to it, they may be redy to entertayne false frendes, worse thaÌ enmies, accordyng to their desertes. I kepe your highnesse to longe with my rude talke, wherfore moste noble prynce, pardon craued, I wolle make an ende, moste humbly besechynge your maiestic, to accepte this cuppe of troubled water, a tyme maye comme, that good wyll, enstrengthned with your hyghnes fauour, may fynd some clerer veyne, and so serue your gracis thirst, with right delectable lyquour. Our lorde longe preserue your highnes, to the settyng forth of his glorie, to the coÌfort of all your subiectes, to the destructioÌ, &amp; deth of al popery.

               SCipio, conucyinge his hoste oute of Italy into Aphrike, in landynge, by chance slypte and cought a fall and perceyuynge that his souldiours were therat abashed, with greatte constancye and bolde stomake, tourned that, whiche cau sed feare, into comforte, sayinge, Harke what I saye my souldiours, I haue fallen vpon Aphrike, and oppressed it.
               Whan C. Cesar, takynge shyppe, hast to falle, he sayd, I perceyue O countrey, what thou meanest. By whiche interpretation he broughte to passe, that they all beleued he shulde safely retourne from whence he departed.
               
                  
Â¶ Sempronius Gracchus consule, his hoste beinge ranged in battayle ayenste the Picentes, and bothe partes beynge confounded with a sodeyne erthe quake, comforted and couraged his men to inuade theyr ennemyes, beinge superstitiousely amased, and by this exhortation he ouercame his ennemyes.
               Whan Sertorius sawe, that the outesyde of his horsemens tergates, and the horses breastes sodeynely, as it had bene by some wonderfulle prodigie, appered blouddye, he by and by expounded it to be a playne token of victorie, bycause those partes of the shieldes and horses, are wont to be sprinkeled with the bloud of theyr ennemies.
               Â¶ Epaminundas perceyuynge that his souldiours, were sadde and sorowfull, bycause that the banner clothe, was blowen of by a great wynde, and caryed in to a graue, where a Lacedemonian had ben buried, sayd, Be not afrayde my soudiars, this sygnifieth the deathe of the Lacedemoniens, for sepulchers be adorned with funerals.
               
                  
The same Epaminundas, seynge his souldiours were afrayde with a flaake of fyre, that fell from heuen in the night, sayd, Surely god sheweth vs this light, in token of comforte.
               As he an other tyme, beinge redye to fyght ageinst the Lacedemonians, wold haue sytten downe, by chance his chayre fell vnder hym: wherof his souldiours were greatly abashed, saying, that commonly suche chaunce betokened greatte mysfortune, No not so, quod he, but here by we be warned, that it is no time no we to sytte.
               L. Sulpitius Gallus, knowynge that the Eclyps of the mone was at hand, lest his souldiours shulde take it for a heuye token, warned them therof before hand, declarynge vnto them al the reason, and causes of the eclyps.
               Lykewyse dyd Agathocles Siracusanus in warre avenst the Penians, what tyme the eclypses happened, the day before they shulde fyght, expounded all the reason therof vnto the armie, leste they shulde take any conceite therat, &amp; taught

them, that what so euer chanced there, it was by course of nature, and not appertayned to theyr affaires.
               Whan on a tyme there fell a great and terrible flushe of lyghtnyng in Pericles campe, and made his souldiours greatly afrayde, he callyd them togyther, and in all theyr syghtes with two stones beaten togyther, strake oute fyre, shewynge them, that lykewise the vyolent dashing to gyther of coutrary elementes, and brekyng out of the cloude, caused the lyghtnynge, wherby he alayde all theyr trouble and feare.
               Whanne that Timotheus of Athens shulde fyght by water ayenst the Corcireens, and the shyppe saylynge forthe to encounter their enemyes, the shyp mayster hearynge oone of the rowers snyse, was going backe, than said Timotheus vnto hym, What, arte thou amased to here that oone of so many thousandes hath caught colde?
               Whan that Chabrias of Athens shuld foght by see, and perceiued that his souldiours were soore amased with a lyghtnynge,

that flashed out euen before the nauie, as a prodigiouse fortoken of some mysaduenture, he sayd, Nowe syrs is the chief time to encounter with our enmies, whan Iupyter the great God hym selfe, sheweth his power to be present with vs.

                  THE exaumples that instructe and teache a capitayne, what he ought to doo, and howe to behaue hym selfe before the battayle, are in myne opinion sufficiently declared in the fyrste boke, nowe I wolle shewe you, what is wont to be done in the self battayle, and what after the fielde is done.

                     WHAN Publius Scipio in Spayne knewe that Hasdruball capitayne of the Penians had ranged out his armye earely in the mornyng, before they

brake theyr faste, he kept in his, vnto the vii. houre, coÌmanding theÌ to syt at rest, &amp; take their repast. and whan his enemyes with hungre, thyrst, and longe taryenge, were nowe tyred in theyr harneys, and beganne to recule to their campe, sodenly he ranged forthe his hoste, and gyuynge battayle, ouercame them.
               Whan that Metellus Pius warred agaynste Herculeius in Spayne, and that this Herculeius by and by at the sprynge of the day, had raynged out his army euen vnto Metellus campe, the season of the yere beinge moste feruente and hote, he kepte his in vnto the. vi. houre of the daye, and so his men beinge fresshe and lusty, ouercame easelye the other weryed with great heate.
               Whan the same Metellus ioyning his power with Pompeius agaynst Sertorius in Spayne, had ofte ranged out his armye, his ennemie euermore refusynge to fyghte, bycause he thoughte hym selfe not able to matche them bothe: after on a certayne tyme, he perceyued, that Sertorius souldiours were greatly encouraged

to fyght, valyantly exercising feates of armes, chargynge and dischargynge their speares, thought it best to forbeare for a tyme, tyll that theyr heate and courage were abated: and so reculed his armye, &amp; caused Pompeius to do the same.
               Posthumius in Sicile laye with his host. iii. myles from the Penians, the dictatours wherof ranged out their army dayly euen before the Romayns campe, the whiche he resisted with a lytell bende of men, and smal skyrmyshes, standing euen before the trenche. Whiche custome the Penians nowe despisyng, he keping the residew within his campe, freshe and redye, after his olde wonte, with a fewe susteyned thassault of his ennemies, and kept them skyrmyshyng longer than he was accustomed. And thus they weried, and sore an hungred, after the. vi. houre, beganne to recule, whome Posthumius with his army freshe &amp; lusty, vaÌquished.
               Forasmoche as Iphicrates of Athens had knowledge, that his ennemies, continually vsed to eate at a certayne tyme, he commaunded his men to take theyr

repast more timely, and ranged them out in battayle, and settynge vpon his ennemies, he soo dalyed with theym, that he neyther wold gyue them batayle, nor yet suffer them to departe. nowe whanne it drewe towarde nyghte, he reculed backe agayne, kepynge his men neuer the lesse redy in theyr harneys: and whan his ennemyes beinge weryed, not onelye with standynge at theyr defence, but also with longe fastyng, made hast to refreshe their bodyes, and to take theyr repaste, Iphicrates againe brought forth his army, &amp; set vpon his ennemys being vnredy and out of order.
               The same Iphicrates warringe ayenst the Lacedemonians, kepte his campe a longe space, harde by his ennemies, and both parties went forth at certayn dewe tymes a forragynge. On a certayne day he sente abrode aboute theyr busynes the slaues and drudges of the armye in souldiours apparell, kepynge the souldiors stil within: and whan his ennemies were scatered abrode for lyke busines, he wan theyr campe by assault, and the vnarmid

retornynge vnto the rore, and noyse, here and there with theyr burdeyns, he easely eyther slewe, or toke prisoners.
               Whan Uirginius consull sawe afar of, his ennemies racynge out all abrode, he commanded his to pitche theyr dartes in the grounde, and reste them: then with his army lusty and fresche he sette on the other nowe almost breathelesse, and put them to flyghte.
               Fabius Maximus knowinge, that the frenche men &amp; the Samnites, were most valiant at the fyrste brayde and that the courage of his men grewe and encreased more and more as the fyghte continued, commaunded his souldiours, that they shulde be content at the fyrste encountre to susteyne and forhere, that so with tarienge they myght wery theyr ennemyes, the whiche thynge succedynge, he sent in socour vnto them, &amp; with al his strength in the vawwarde, oppressed and subdued his ennemies.
               Philip at Cheronea, remembryng that he had warryours hardened with longe vse and exercyse, and that the Athenienses

were quicke and fyerce, but vnexercised, and onely vyolent at the fyrste brayd, he of pourpose prolonged the battayle, and anone after, the Athenienses fayntinge, he auanced his baners more fierce ly forwarde, and slewe them.
               Â¶ The Lacedemonians, beinge certified by theyr espyes, that the Messenians were set on suche a rage, that they came to battayle, with theyr wyues and chyldren, differred to fyght.
               When Cesar in the cyuill warre, had enclosed the hoste of Affranius and Petreius within a trenche, he pyned theym with thyrste, in so moche that they therby erasperated, distroyed all that withstode them, and profered to fyght: Cesar kept in his men, supposynge it no mete tyme for battayle, whan yre and dispayre had inflamed his ennemies.
               It is playne, that Iugurthe, hauynge wel in mynd the puissance of the Romaines, vsed alway to gyue battayle to ward nyghte, to the entente, that if his menne shulde be put to flyght, they myght haue the oportunitie and succour of the nyght

to hyde them.
               Lucullus in warre aienst Mithridates and Tigranes in Armenia the greatter, at Tigranocerta, whan he hauynge but xv. thousande men, and his ennemys an innumerable multitude, whiche therfore were vnrulye, toke this aduauntage, to inade his ennemies oute of araye and order, and so forthwith disparpled them, that the kynges them selfes were fayne to caste away their cote armure, and flee.
               Claudius Tiberius Nero, in warre ayenst the PaÌnoniens, seing the fierce bar barous felowes come forth in aray early in the mornynge, kepte in his, and suffered his ennemys to be beaten with the myste and rayne, as it chaunced the wether to be very foule that daye. and after whan he perceyued their courage faynted, and their bodies were soore weakened with the rayne and longe standyng, the token of battayle gyuen, he assayled and ouercame them.
               Whan Cesar in France had perceyued, that Ariouistus kyng of the Germayns, had an ordynaunce in maner of a lawe,

not to fyghte in the wane of the moone, than chiefly he ioyned batayl with them, and ouercame his ennemies, entangled and lette with their superstitious obseruynge of the tymes.
               Uespasian the emperour, on the saboth day, whan it is not lauful for the Iewes to do any ernest busynesse, assaulted and ouercame them.

               MArcus Curius perceyuynge, that kynge Pyrrhus armye, beinge at large, myght not be resysted, dyd his indeuour to fyght in strayte places, where they thronged togyther, myght be a lette to them selues.
               Â¶ Cn. Pompeius in Cappadocia chose a hygh place, and theron pight his tentes, where the stypyng of the hyll holpe the couragious settynge out of his souldiours, and so he easily ouercame Mithridates, euen with the violent decours and descendynge downe from the hylle.
               Â¶ Whan C. Cesar fought against Pharnaces, Mithridates sonne, he ordeyned

his aray on a hyll, the whiche thyng got hym spedy vyctorie. For the dartes throwen from aboue, vppon the barbarouse people, that came vnderneth, forthwith put them to flyght.
               Â¶ Whan Lucullus shulde fight ageinst Mithridates, and Tygranes in Armenia the gretter at Tygranocerta, he toke quyckely the playne toppe of the nexte hylle, with parte of his armie, and froo thens rushed downe vpon his ennemies vndernethe, and inuaded their horsemen on the one syde, and puttynge somme to flyght, some oute of araye, so pursewed them, that he retourned with ryght noble vyctorie.
               Uentidius agaynst the Parthians moued not once his armye, before his ennemyes were within halfe a myle of hym, and then with a sodeyne race he marched so nere them, that theyr arrowes, whiche dyd good seruice a farre of, coulde nowe do hym no harme nere hande. By which policie, and with a lustye bolde courage, as thoughe he mystrusted nothynge, he quickely vanquysshed and subdued the

barbarous people.
               When Anniball shulde fyghte ageynst Marcellus at Numystron, he fensed his armye on the one syde with holowe broken wayes: and vsynge the naturall sytuation of the place, for a fortifycation and defence, he ouercame a ryghte worthy capitayne.
               Â¶ Whan the same Anniball at Cannas knewe that the brooke Uolturnus, farre passynge the nature of other ryuers, sent out in the mornynge excedynge ayre and wynde, which reysed and blewe vp sand and duste, he so ordered his battayle, that all the vyolence therof, shuld be on their backes, and in the faces and eies of the Romaynes: by the whiche incommodities wonderfully greuing his ennemies, he opteyned that famous and notable vyctorie.
               Â¶ Whan Marius shuld fyght on a day appoynted agaynst the Cymbriens, and Deuche men, he fyrste strengthened his souldiours with meate, and than caused theym to reste before the campe, to putte theyr ennemyes to the more peynes, in

trauaylynge the space that laye betwene bothe hostes. and whan he had put them to this labour, he added thervnto an other incommoditie, that is to say, he soo chose his grounde, and ordred his aray, that the wynde, the duste, and contrarye sonne laye in the face of his ennemies.
               Epaminundas capitayne of the Thebans, rangynge out his army ageynste the Lacedemonians, commaunded the horsemen to race out before, and to reyse vp a greate duste in his ennemyes eies, pretendynge as thoughe he wolde haue set vpon them with the horsemen, conducted the fote men from that parte, where the horse men were, and came behynde on theyr backes vnwares, and slewe theÌ.
               Thre hundred against an innumerable multitude of the Persians, kept the strai tes of the hil called Thermopylas, where mought but like nomber of men mete together to fyght, and by that meanes, as touchyng the meting together, they were equall in nombre with the barbarouse alyens, and beinge moche more valyaunt in warre, slewe a great nombre of them.

neyther had they ben ouercome, excepte the traytour Ephialtes had led theyr ennemys about, and oppressed them on the backe syde.
               Â¶ Whan Themistocles capytayn of Athens perceyued, that it was moste profytable for the Grekes, to trie the matter agaynste Xerxes multitude, in the straytes of Salanes, and could not perswade the cities therto, by polycie he broughte to passe, that his enemies compelled the Grekes to do accordynge to his aduyse: dissemblynge with Xerxes, as though he wold betray his contrey, sent him word, that the Atheniens intended to flee, and that it wolde be a very harde thynge for hym, to lay siege to al their cities. Wherby he perswadid the barbarous host, whi che was disquieted, with lyenge out all nyght in watche, to fyght with the Atheniens, fresh and lusty, euen in those straites, that he desyred, where in no wise Xerxes coulde vse his greatte noumber of souldiours.
            
            
               
               To order the arraye. Cap. 3.
               VUhan Cneus Scipio in Spayne agaynst Hanno, at the towne named Indibilis, perceyued, that the army of the Carthaginenses was on this wise ordered, that in the right wyng were the Spanyardes, a sturdy kynde of souldiours, the whiche not withstandyng had nowe in hande an other mannes matter: and in the left winge were the Aphriens, not all thing so sure in strength and man lynes, but of moche more constant mynd and purpose: he brought backe and with drewe the lefte wynge of his armye, to the ryght wynge, whiche he furnysshed and besette with most valyant warriors, and so assayling the weakest of his ennemies, with the strongest of his army, and vanquyshynge the Aphriens, he easilye constrayned the Spanyardes, whiche stode as though they had ben lokers on, to yelde them selfe.
               Artaxerxes, in battail agaynst the Grekes, for as moche as he had the greatter nombre, deuysed his araye to be spreade broder, then the host of his ennemys, and

set the horse men in the fore frunte, and the lyght harneysed in the wynges, &amp; so caused the mydward to procede somwhat softer for the nons, wherby he inclosed the host of his enmies, and so slew them.
               Â¶ Contrary wyse Anniball at Cannas, somewhat withdrawyng the wynges of his hoste, and aduancyng forth the midwarde, at the fyrste brunte and metynge droue the Romaynes backe, but whan they were nowe ioyned in fyght, the winges at a certayne watche word comming forwarde, the mydwarde gyuynge somwhat backe, enclosed their enmies, whiche gredily folowed the mydwarde: and so pressed them on bothe sydes, and slewe them, vsynge the polycie of the olde and longe taught armye. For this maner of order and aray, scasely any man may easily put in vre, but namely he, that is an experte warriour, redy at all poyntes.
               Â¶ Asdrubal in the second warre of Carthaginenses, sought meanes to auoyde the necessitie of fyght, and therfore conducted and lay with his host on a rough rocky hylle behynd vynes: Liuius Salinator,

and Claudius Nero brought all their power vnto the syde wynges, leauynge the fore frunt voyde, and soo settynge vppon hym on bothe sydes, ouercame hym.
               Â¶ Xantippus capitayne of the Lacedemoniens in Aphrike, ageynste M. Attilius Regulus, sette his lyght harneysed in the forwarde, and in the rerewarde the chiefe and strengthe of all the hoste, and coÌmanded other his souldiors, after they had flung their dartes, yt they shuld giue place to their ennemies, and as soone as they were come agayne into their order and araye, by and by they shulde rounne forthe on eche syde, and breake out agein from the wynges, and so gette behynde their ennemyes: that whan their ennemies were no we come, and receyued of the stronger warde, they myghte inclose them rounde aboute.
               Â¶ Sertorius vsed the same feate in Spayne ageynste Pompey.
               Â¶ Cleandridas a LacedemonieÌ against Lycaonos set his host very thicke thronged togyther, that it myght muster moch

lesse than it was, and his enemies therby takynge the lesse regarde, euen in the very fyght, he opened and deuyded his order and arraye into syde wynges, and so inclosng his enemys, distroied them.
               Â¶ Whan Castronius of Lacedemonia came to succour the Aegyptians against the Perseans, knowynge that the Grekes were the better menne of warre, and more dreade of the Perseans, theyr armure and apparell chaunged, he set the Grekes in the forefrunt, and whyle they held the PerseaÌs hard, &amp; egally matched them, he sent to theym a bande of the Egyptians armed lyke Grekes, the Perscans, whiche were scante able to resyste the Grekes, whom they toke for Aegyptians, no we perceyuynge an other multitude come vpon them, whome they beleued to be Grekes, were vtterly dismaied, and fledde.
               Â¶ Cn. Pompeius in Albania, perceyuinge that his ennemyes were stronger bothe in nombre, and of horse men, commanded his horse men, that in the straites, nere vnto a lyttell hyll, they shoulde

couer theyr helmettes, lest by theyr bright nes they myghte be sene: Then to march forth on horsebacke, and as it were to go forthe before the fotemen: and charged them also, that at the fyrste assaulte, they shoulde gyue backe, vntyll they came to the fote men, and thenne flee out in syde wynges: the whiche thynge doone, the place beinge dyscouered, the battayle of the fote men appered sodenly in the middes, &amp; inclosyng his enmys, slewe them.
               Â¶ Whan Anniball in Aphrike agaynste Scipio, had furnyshed his army of Penians and other that aided hym, For he had in his host straungers not onely out of dyuers partes, but also of Italye: next to. lxxx. elephantes, whiche he hadde set in the forewarde, to trouble and breake the arraye of his ennemyes, he sette the frenchemen, Genowayes, Baliares, and the Mauritans, to the intent they shuld not flee, the Penians beinge at theyr backes: and beynge set ageynste his ennemies, if they dyd none other hurte, yet at leaste they shulde wery theym: then his owne and the Macedons, freshe &amp; lusty

to encountre with the Romaynes weried, he set in the myddell warde: and laste of all he ordred the Italians, whose fidelytie and faynte courage he mystrusted, bycause he had brought many of theym out of Italy ageynste theyr wylles. Scipto, ageynste this order and arraye, set the strengthe of his legion, ordred in thre batayles in the front, the speare men and the chiefe and strongeste souldiours: he ioyned not his cohortes to gether, but lefte a space betwene them, through whiche the elephantes dryuen by theyr ennemyes, myght easely passe without troublynge or breakinge the order of his battayles: those spaces betwene he fylled with souldiours in lyghte harneys, that the arraye shulde not be sene or shewe open: whiche had in commaundement, that at the violent commynge of the elephantes, they shulde eyther recule backe, orels go a syde. farther he ordeyned, that the horsemen shoulde be in the wynges: and ouer the Romayne horsemen in the ryght wynge he appoynted Lelius, and Masinissa ouer the Numidians in the

lefte wynge: whiche prudente order, no doubte, was cause of the victorie.
               C. Cesar, by the same meanes, that is to saye, with stakes, kepte of the hoked chariottes of the frenche men.
               Whan Alexander at Arbela, was in drede of the multitude of his ennemies, and yet neuerthelesse had good affyance in the manlynesse of his souldiours, he so ordered his battayles, that they might tourne them selfe euery way, and fyghte on euery syde, if they chaunced to be enclosed of their ennemies.
               Archelaus ageynst L. Sylla, set chariottes, armed with hokes lyke sythes, in the fronte of his battayle, to trouble and breake the array of his ennemies, in the seconde battayle he sette al the foote men in array after the facion of Macedons: in the thyrde battaylle, as the Romaynes vsed, he sette them, that came to ayde hym, myngled with fugitiues, that were fledde out of Italie, whose constancy he moche trusted: the lyght harneised he set vttermooste of all. Than to inclose his ennemies he ordred his horsemen in two

wynges, of whome he had a great number. Agaynst these ordinaunces, Sylla lette caste a brode diche on eyther syde of his campe, the heedes of whiche he fortified with bastiedes or fortresses: to the intent he wolde not be inclosed of his enmies, and assayled on all sydes with the number of fote men, and namely of the horsemen, whiche were very stronge.
               Than he ordered his foote men in thre battayles, leauynge spaces for the lyght harneysed, and for the horsemen whome he sette vttermoste of all, that whanne nede requyred, he myghte sende theym forthe. Farther he commaunded theym, that shuld defende the standerde, whiche were in the seconde battayle, to driue stakes in the grounde thycke together, bytwene the whiche, whan the waynes armed with sythes, approched, he receyued his armie. Than at laste makynge all a great shoute togyther, he commaunded the souldiours, that were lyght harneysed, to throwe their dartes, whiche done, the enemies waynes armed with sithes, eyther combred with the stakes, or feared

with the clamour and noyse, or greued with the dartes, tourned agayne vppon their owne host, and disturbed and brake the array of the Macedones: whiche reculynge backe, and Sylla pursuing, Archelaus sette to incountre hym, his hors men, the whiche the horsemen of the Romaynes put to flyght, and acheued the vyctorie.
               Whan that C.

a manifeste token, that they had eaten corne and other vittailes, they supposed that those men muste nedes haue greatte plentie of suche thynges, wherwith they fed theyr beastes, and therfore they brake vp theyr syege and departed.

With whiche benignitie he not only bounde hym, but also the commons (by whome they were moche ruled) to be faythefull and true to hym euer after.

               Anniball by lyke policie was reuenged on those that forsoke hym, and fledde to his ennemies. For whan he knewe, that certayne of his souldioures were fledde the nyght before, and wyst wel yt his ennemies spies were in his campe, he pronounced openly, that those runnagates, whiche were gone forth by his commandement, to harken and spye what his ennemies dyd and intended, shoulde not be callyd counnynge and witty warriours.

               Â¶ Of discipline of warre. Cap. 1.
               
                  
                     PVBLIVS SCIpio at NumaÌtia, redressed the army, which was corrupted with ye slouthe and idelnes of the capytaynes that had ben before hym, dismyssynge a greate number of the slaues and drudges, brynging the fouldiours by dayly exercise, to do theyr

duetie: whiche he caused to make many iourneys, and to beare on theyr backes, as moche vittayles as shulde serue them many dayes: so that he accustomed them to suffer colde and sharpe showres, and to wade ouer waters a fote. Nowe and than he imbrayded them of fearefulnesse and cowardise, breakynge such vesselles in pieces, whiche they vsed more of delycacie, than for nede in theyr expedition. In this behalf, the reproch, that he gaue to the capitaine C. Meuius, is right notable, to whome he sayde, To me but a whyle, to thy self and to the coÌmon weale thou shalt euer be lewde &amp; vnprofytable.
               Q. Metellus in the warre Iugurthine with like seuerite restored the Discipline, that was decayed and neglected amonge the souldiours: and further prohybited them, that they shuld vse none other flesh but rosted or sodde.
               It is written, that Pirrhus shulde saye to hym that toke vppe souldiours, Chose thou those that be gret, and I wol make them stronge.
               Â¶ Whan Scipio Aphricanus sawe a

souldiour beare a targate galyardly decked and trymmed, sayde, He maruailed not, that he had so curiousely garnysshed his tergate, wherein he had more truste than in his sworde.
               Â¶ Whan Philyp had prepared his armye to go forthe, he commaunded, that no man shulde haue any carte, or other thynge vsed for cariage with hym, nor a horseman to haue but one page. x. foote men one slaue, whiche shulde beare quirnes and cordes: whan they wente forthe in such places, as they lay in the sommer, he commanded theym to beare on theyr neckes meale for thirty dayes.
               Caius Marius, somewhat to ease the armie in carieng their traficke and baggage, wherwith they were greatly loded, deuysed their vessels and vittayles into fardels laide vpon staues, vnderset with forkes, whiche made their burthen lyghter, and they myght more easily rest vnder it. Whervpon they were called in pro uerbe, Marius mules.
               Whan Theogenes of Athens ledde his hoste towarde Megara, and was inquered

howe the army shuld be ordered, said, He wolde euen there order his battayles. Than priuily he sent forthe the horsmen, and commaunded theym lyke ennemies to retourne and fiersely sette vpon theyr felowes. Whiche thynge doone, he permytted the battayl to be thus ordred, that they that remayned with hym, as it were prepared to encouÌter with their enmies, shulde take euery manne what place he wolde, and whaÌ the faint harted felowes drewe backe, the stronge and valyaunt, boldly stepte forth into the forefront: and as he founde theym standynge, so he aduaunced them in the order of chiualry.
               Â¶ Lysander of Lacedemonia corrected a certayne man, bycause he strayed from his company. And whan the man sayde, he strayed not from the army to robbe or steale any thynge, he answered, I wolle that thou shewe no spece or lykelyhod of robberye.
               Whan Antigonus hard, that his sonne had taken vp his lodgyng in a womans house that had three verye fayre doughters, he sayde: My sonne, I here say, ye

be to straytelye lodged, where be many masters in the house, take a larger Inne. Thus he beinge commanded to remoue and go thense, Antigonus caused to proclayme, that no man vnder the age of fifty yeres, shoulde lodge in the house of a sole woman.
               Â¶ All be it that N. Metellus cons. was let by no lawe, but that he mighte contynually haue his sonne in his companye, yet wolde he rather haue him wynne wages in warre.
               Whan Publius Rutilius cons. mighte accordynge to the lawe, haue his sonne always in his company, yet he made him a souldiour in the legion.
               T. Scaurus forbad his sonne to come in his syghte, bycause in the foreste Tridentine he gaue place to his enemies, the yonge man pressed with shame of that re proche and infamy, slewe hym selfe.
               The auncient Romaines and other nations dyd constitute and make theyr tentes and pauilions throughe the hole bodye of thyr army, lyke rounde cotages: where as the olde worlde knewe none other,

but walled townes.
               Pirthus kynge of the Epirotes, was the firste, that ordeyned to lodge his hole armye within one trenche or bulwarke. After whan the Romaynes had ouercomen hym in the fieldes Arusine, nere the citie StatuentuÌ, and had got his campe, markynge and obseruynge howe he ordered his armye, by lyttell and lyttel they came to this maner of pitchynge of tentes, and lodgynge their armye, that is nowe vsed.
               P. Nasica lying with his army in their wyntryng places, ordeined that his souldiours shulde falle to buyldyng of shippes, though the vse of them was to hym nat nedefull: leste they shulde be corrupted with slouthe and idelnes, orels by reson of leysure, hauynge nothynge to do, wolde imagyn and commytte some iniurie ageynst those that were confederates and frendes to the Romaynes.
               Clearchus, chieftayne of the Lacedemoniens, sayde to his armie, The capitayne ought rather to be dredde, than the ennemie: sygnifienge that they, whyche

The feare of whose commynge so bashed his ennemies, that he ouercame them.

their forefete reysed vppe on hyghe, and whan they sought to haue their naturall wonte and standyng, they trauersed and flonge with their heles vntil they swette.
               Â¶ What tyme the barbarous aliens pro mised Cato men to conducte hym in his iourney, and also a garrison to ayd him, so that he wolde gyue them a great some of money, he stacke nat at the matter, to promyse them largely, bycause he might other paye them obtaynynge the victory with the spoyles of his ennemies, or by their deathe be lowsed of his promyse.
               Â¶ Quintus Maximus commaunded to calle vnto hym oone Statilius, a noble man of armes, &amp; approued in dede, whiche intended to flee frome hym vnto his enemies, and made an excuse vnto him, that through the enuye of his felowes, he neuer knewe vnto that day his manly qualities: than gyuynge to hym a horse and money: he opteyned, that this man, whiche came vnto him feareful, his conscience accusynge hym, departed chierefull.

               Whan Phylyp hard, that one Pithias, a valyant warriour of his, had withdrawen his good wyl from him, bicause that he had scante to susteyne his. iii. doughters, and was nothynge relieued of the kynge, certayne men warned the kynge, to take hede and beware of hym. What quod the kynge, if I had a parte of my body diseased, shoulde I rather cut it of, than heale it. Afterwarde he priuily called Bithias vnto hym, and perceyuyng, howe poore and harde a life he lad, gaue hym money largely, and so euer after he founde hym more trustye, faythfull, and better than euer he dyd before.

               After the gret losse and dyscomfiture at Cannas, the hartes of the Romaynes were so dismayde and discomfited, that a great parte of them, whiche were lefte alyue, toke counsell with the nobles, and determyned to forsake Italye, Publius Scipio beinge yet a very yonge manne, broke vyolently into the same company, where as these thynges were reasoned, and playnly protested, that he wolde slee hym with his owne hande, whiche so euer of theym wolde not take an othe, to stande and abyde by the common welth, and whan he had fyrst bounde hym selfe with an othe, he drewe his sworde, thretnynge to slee hym, that was nexte hym, if he made not the same oth. thus by fear he compelled hym and the other by his example, to sweare the same othe.

And whan he had preuented them, &amp; replenysshed the walles with harneyssed men, the Perseans thynkynge the number of the Athenians to be great, and that the battaylle at Marathon was foughte with one armye, and the walles kepte with an other, made about streyght way with their nauy, &amp; toke their passage ageyn into Asia.
               Â¶ what time Pisistratus had taken the Megarenciens nauy, wherin they came to Elewsis by nyght, to haue rauysshed the women of Athens, beinge as than occupied in the sacrifyce of Ceres, and had wel reuenged their grefes, in sleinge a gret number of the sayd Megarenses, he manned the same shyppes, that he had taken of theirs, with souldiours of Athens, settyage oute in syghte aboue the hatches, certayn women ordred lyke prisoners: at the which syght the Megarensians beinge disceyued, and scatteringe out to mete them, as though they had beÌ their owne companye, whiche after their enterprise luckely achieued, had returned

The Perseans bycause they knewe the shyppes and the apparayle of them, whiche stode aboue the hatches, toke no hede to theym selfe, and so they beinge sodeynly oppressed, were in one selfe day, vanquished in battayle bothe by see and on the lande.
            
            The ende of the fourth boke.
         
         
            Â¶Bycause the pages shulde not be vacant, we haue added these generalle rules of warre, taken out of Vegetius.
            
               IN all battayles of expedition this is a sure rule, That what so euer is profytable to the, is hurtefull to thyne aduersarie, and that, that helpeth hym, hyndreth the. Therfore after our ennemies

mynd and intent we shuld nothing do, or dissemble, but do that onely, whiche we iudge profytable for vs. For than thou begynnest to do agaynste thy selfe: whan thou folowest that that he wolde faynest thou dyddest. Ageyne, what soo euer thou enterprisest for thy profite, shal be agaynst hym, if he woll folowe it.
            He that in warre moste laboureth and exerciseth his souldiours in trauayles, that longe to the warres, shall alwayes susteyne leaste perylle and daungier.
            Neuer range out in the front of the battayle, a souldiour, of whome before thou haste had none open profe.
            It is better to vanquyshe thyn ennemy with neede, with sodeyne inuasyons, or with terror, thaÌ with fyghtyng in playne battayle: in the whiche Fortune is wont to beare a greatter stroke than vertue.
            Those counsayles are beste, whyche thyne aduersarie knoweth nothynge of, tyll they be done in dede.
            Occasion or sodeyne happe in battayle helpeth more than vertue or strength.
            In solycitynge and receyuynge of ennemies,

whiche faithfully flee vnto the, is great truste: for the fleers from thyne ennemye to the, are to hym more harmefull, than they that thou sleest.
            It is better to kepe many stronge wardes behynde the forefront, than to sprede to wyde thy warriours.
            It is harde to ouercome hym, that can truly iudge his own strength, and what power his aduersarye hath.
            More auayleth vertue and strengthe than multitude.
            The well chosen place, dothe often tymes more auayle thaÌ vertue or strength.
            Nature bringeth forth few strong men, but wel diuised ordinance maketh many.
            The armye with labour profiteth, with idelnesse, waxeth dull.
            Neuer brynge oute thy souldyours to fyght a battayl, except thou se them hope to haue the vyctorie.
            Sodayne dedes of warre affrayeth the enmies, the vsual featis ar not regardid.
            He that with his people disparpled, pur sueth his enemies vnwisely, may happe to gyue to his ennemie the vyctorie, that

he before had gotten.
            He that prepareth not before, wheate and vyttayle necessarie for his hooste, is vanquyshed without weapon.
            He that hath mo people, and is stronger than his ennemie, let hym make his forewarde foure square: whiche is the fyrsie maner of assaylinge.
            He that is febler than his foo, lette hym set his ryght wynge ageynst his enmyes lefte wyng, whiche is the seconde maner.
            He that feleth hym selfe strongest in the lyft wynge, let him assayle his ennemies ryght winge, which is the thyrde maner.
            He that hath in bothe wynges stronge souldiours, and well exercised, lette hym sette on bothe wynges at ones, whiche is the fourthe maner.
            He that can beste rule his lyght harneised, lette hym inuade eyther wynge of his ennemies, settynge the archers in the forefront, whiche is the fyfte maner.
            He that trusteth neyther in the number nor in the strength of his souldiors, and must nedes fyght, let him with his right wynge assayle his ennemies left wynge,

stretchynge out the reste of his army like a spyt or broche. whiche is the. vi. maner.
            He that hath fewer and weaker souldiours, lette hym so pytche his fielde, that he haue on his one syde a mountayne, a citie, a see, a ryuer, or some other thynge, and this is the seuenth maner.
            He that trusteth in his horsmen, let him ordeyne his fielde in a playne, and let the burthen of the battayle reste mooste on the horsemenne.
            He that trusteth in his footemen, lette hym pytche his felde on a knap or highe grounde, and lette the burthen of the batayle reste most on the foote men.
            If thou suspect, that a spye of thyn ennemye lurketh in thyne hoste, command, that euery man be in his owne lodgynge by day light, &amp; anon the spy is perceiued.
            Whan thou wottest, that thy counsaylle is discouered to thyn enmies, than it behoueth the, to chaunge thy purpose.
            Treate thou with many, what oughte to be done, but what thou wylte doo, disclose that to fewe, that ar most faithfull, or els kepe it secrete to thy selfe.
            
               
Peyne and drede chastyseth souldiors whan they lye styl, in settynge forwarde, hope and mede maketh them better.
            Good capitayns neuer fyght in a pight fielde, excepte they be dryuen thereto by sodeyne happe or great nede.
            It is a gret wise policy, rather to greue thyn enmie with huÌger, thaÌ with wepon.
            Let not thyne enmie knowe, with what ordinaunce, in what maner wyse, or how thou intendest to assayl him, lest he pÌpare ordynance to withstand or distroy thyne.
