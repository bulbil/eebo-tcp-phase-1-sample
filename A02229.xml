            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

before his face: Lo (ſaid he) nowe Belzabub calleth mée to a feaſte, ye ſhall perceiue mine ende to approache, to the example of many, that the iudgement and iuſtice of GOD, maie openly be declared vpon me. And when he had thus ſaide, he turned his face awaie from vs, turnyng himſelfe on the other ſide, then ſaide the reuerende father Vergerius. Ah deare maſter Francis, turne your face vnto vs. I would wee praied to God togither, and ſaie. Our father. &amp;c.
            Then he turnyng him, began to ſay the lordes praier in his mother tongue, with ſuche grauitie and deuotion, that all wee did wonder: and this vttered, hee added theſe woordes. I haue ſaide it with my mouth, but my hearte is cleane from it. God hath taken all his grace from mee. My heart is vtterly hardened: Ye labour in vaine. And when we had ſpo

               ken with hym all theſe wordes, and many other, we had hym farewell. And ſo departed all thence with the Lord Vergerius, to pray vnto God for hym, entendyng to returne on the morow, if the bleſſed God woulde voucheſafe to ſhew hym his mercie.
            The next daye we came to the wretchedThe ſeconde daies worke.
               
man, ſaluting him as the maner is, to whom the reuerende lorde Vergerius ſayde. Right welbeloued Maiſter Francis, is it any better with you, by the grace of GOD? haue ye receiued no comforte in your hart? haue you conceyued any good hope? to whome he aunſwered nothing at all: but rather cōtinually worſe, and worſe. Then began we to demaunde of him many queſtions, and eſpeciallye what time he fell firſt into that cōfuſion and deſperation, and when that vnquencheable worme did firſte begin to burne his conſcience, then recited he vnto vs the whole order and proceſſe of his firſt and ſeconde abiuration: as we haue declared in the beginning. Which abiurations made, by and by he perceiued himſelfe to be ſmitten wyth the mightie hād of God, not with any affliction or infirmitie of the body (which he right gladly would haue acknowledged for the chaſticement and correction of ſinne, and would not vtterlye haue caſt away hope and truſt:) But the moſt wretched felow from that houre, and that ſodainly, parceyued himſelf to be ſtricken in heart, ſpirite and conſcience, for God from that

houre, ſente into his harte a gnawyng worme, an vnquencheable fire, that ſodainely he might be filled with errour, confuſion and deſperation, which worme and fire, neuer ſince forſooke hym: in ſo much that hée confeſſed himſelfe to be in farre worſe eſtate, than if his ſoule were deuided from his body, and he with Caine and other dampned perſons, deſiring rather to be in the place of any deade and damned ſoule, than ſo to lyue in his body, and that death ſhoulde be much more welcome to him.
            Then wéeping he began to declare vnto vs horrible viſions, how that he perceyued ſince that time cōtinually Deuils to come to his chamber, yea, to his bed, making a noyſe and buſineſſe, putting him in feare and ſheauering, ſticking pinnes in the pillow vnder his heade, and ſayde, that he cōceyued not theſe thinges by a falſe or corrupt imagination, but euen as truely as he ſawe vs all aliue, and ſpeaking with him.
            Then ſayde the reuerend Lorde Vergerius. Ah deare Maiſter Frauncis, yo
                  〈…〉
                ſpirite vtterly corrupt, repreſenteth 
                  〈…〉

imaginations. But returne a while vnto the ſpirite of truth, and direct your hart with hope and affiaunce vnto the bleſſed God, mercifull, and full of goodneſſe, and without doubt he will be good and mercifull vnto you, he wyll caſt from you all horror and confuſion, haue ſure cōfidence ſwéete M. Francis: we all haue good hope of you, through the infinite mercye of God: and (if it pleaſe you) let vs ſaye togither from the heart the Lords prayer.
            Then ſayde he in Latine the whole prayer, with plētifull teares, ſo deuoutly and grauely, and wyth ſuch inwarde affection, as we thought, that all we that ſtoode by, did wéepe wyth hym, And when I behelde both the teares, the repentance and contrition of the man: I ſayde Maiſter Frauncis, the bleſſed God be prayſed.

mortall lyfe, whether he bée worthie the hatred or loue of God, through the righteouſneſſe of workes. And when we earneſtly exhorted him, that in no caſe he ſhoulde fall from all hope and truſt, and that euerie man that is borne (althoughEccle. ix. he had committed all the ſinnes of the whole worlde) ought yet to haue ſome hope of the fauour and mercy of God, whoſe goodneſſe &amp; mercie is muche more plenteous, than mannes vnderſtandyng can perceyue: and that if any of vs were fallen into ſuche miſerie, yet ſhoulde he not diſpaire of the mercie of the high and good God. To the which hée aunſwered: I knowe all this, and I beleue that the infinite mercy of God, doth farre ſurmount all the ſinnes of the worlde, and that euerye man that beléeueth and hath fayth, eaſtlye obtayneth pardon of all the ſinnes of the worlde. But this hope, thys faith, is the gifte of God. And this oneFaithe is the gift of God. thing wante I, that I can neyther hope nor beleue of the fauour and mercie of God towardes mée.
            And I would God that he would graunt me this one thing, that I coulde conceyue neuer ſo little hope and beliefe

of forgiueneſſe and pardon.
            But this is euen as poſſible as to take the whole water of the ſea, in one ſpoone, and to drinke it vppe at a draughte. If Salomon had bene in ſuche caſe as I am, and had ſome what knowne thoſe thinges, which I prooue nowe by manifeſt experience, hee woulde neuer haue vttered that Sentence. But I doe beléeue (and this I knowe moſt aſſuredly) that there was neuer any man that had more manifeſt experience in his lyfe, of the hatred, wrath and indignation of the righteous god againſt hym, then I haue.
            I would I were in the place of any damned perſon. You that are in bleſſed eſtate ſuppoſe thys an eaſie thing to be done, that a ſinner reknowledging his fault, may lift vp himſelfe to hope and faith towards God▪ and therefore ye exhort me, for as much as ye ſée me repentaunt and ſorowfull, that I would conceiue ſome hope and truſt to riſe againe▪ The helthfull hath no néede of a Phiſ

But it can not chooſe, but that ſome of the broth muſt néedes fall downe by his gaping into the iawes and palace of his mouth, and ſo thence into his ſtomake. And thus with much a doe, he is

            The thirde daie came wee vnto hym,The iij. dayes woorke. with the reuerend Father Vergerius, and did ſalute hym as the maner is: and began againe to comfort him: Notwithſtandyng, he ſaide nothyng, but ſhuttyng his eyen like one a ſléepe, with pain gaue aunſwere. Then came there a certaine aged man, from the place of Citadell, aſkyng hym whether hee knewe hym his friend: whom the wretched man beholdyng with his eyen, did ſcarce acknowledge.
            Then ſaide he: Maiſter Frauncis, I am Anthony Fontanina Prieſt, who was with you, the ſame day that ye came to Venis: about ſeuen or eight monethes paſt. Then ſaide Frauncis with pittifull grone, and ſighings. Alas that curſed daie. Alas that curſed daie. I would I had neuer gone thyther, or elſe had dyed at that preſent.
            Then began we to demaunde him many queſtions, ſpecially of his olde fayth, and whether hee had at any tyme, any

Certes, I did beléeue that Chriſt was the ſacrifice that appeaſed Gods wrath towardChriſt onely iuſtifieth. vs, and that it was he only, by whom we did attaine ſaluation and righteouſneſſe, neither doubted I at any tyme in this.

            Then roſe there vp one that was there preſent, a man excellently learned, and long exerciſed in holy Scripture, and ſaid Maiſter Frauncis, we doe not altogether allowe this your exhortation, wheras ye councell vs not ſo muche to yelde to the faith of ye Goſpell: but that we ſhould alſo embrace and commende the affiaunce of works. For we know that there are two kindes of righteouſneſſe, outward and inwarde. Outwarde righteouſneſſe, whiche

is of workes, and which the worlde doth commend, the ſame iuſtifieth not before God, neither auaileth to ſaluation. For Socrates, Cato, and Areſtides, right well perfourmed that righteouſneſſe: wherby they gate muche prayſe and glorie in this worlde. But the inwarde righteouſneſſeThe rightuouſnes which is in Chriſt, iuſtifieth. is of God, whiche doth regenerate vs by grace into hope, faith and charitie: and by this faith fréely graunted vnto vs, doe we liue and are iuſtified, and God imputeth not oure ſinnes vnto vs, without the whiche, neuertheleſſe, we can not be, as the ſcripture ſaith: if we ſaie we haue no ſinne, we beguile our ſelues. But bleſſed is hee to whom the Lorde imputeth not ſinne, and whoſe ſinnes are couered.
            Wherefore, there is no cauſe that ye ſhould ſende vs to outwarde workes, as to the Anker and refuge of ſaluation and righteouſneſſe. Than ſaide I: Sir, Mayſter Francis words are not to be taken ſo preciſely or exactly, as though he would compare the outwarde righteouſneſſe of workes, to the faithe of the Goſpell, and inward righteouſneſſe: But he exhorted the yong men after this ſort: bicauſe the moſt parte doe wickedly turne the libertie

But his two ſonnes that were alwaies by him, tooke him ſodainely by the hand, and plucked the knife from him: wherby we maye plainly knowe what we maye vndoubtedly thinke of that demaunde whiche we aſked him the day before, of kylling him: to the which he would make

Lorde God of power turne vs? ſhewe thy face and we ſhall be ſaued. Here we be taught firſt to deſire remiſſion of ſynne, that we may be at one with God: and after that to haue hys wrath, and the tokens of the ſame taken away. But whenſoeuer we deſire to be deliuered or to be eaſed of the croſſe that preſſeth vs, we muſt alwaye annexe this addition. Thy wyll (O heauenlyMatth. 5. Father) bee fulfilled.
            Neyther knowe wee ſo well what is profitable vnto vs. Neither can we ſo well prouide for our ſelues as our moſt louing heauenly father. Whiche is both of infinite power, and alſo of incomprehenſible wiſedome, whiche neuer turneth his eyes from vs, whiche careth cō

                  Becauſe we are iuſtified by faithe, weRoma. v. are at peace with god the father, through our lorde Ieſus Chriſt, by whō we haue awaie in through Faithe, to that grace wherein wee ſtande, and reioyce in hope of the glorie of God.
               God ſetteth out his loue that he hath to vs, ſeyng that while we were yet ſynners, Chriſte died for vs, muche more now, ſeyng we are iuſtified in his bloud, ſhall wée bee ſaued from wrathe through hym: for if when wée were enemies, wee were reconciled to GOD by the death of his ſoonne, muche more ſeeyng wee are reconciled, wée ſhall bee preſerued by his life.
               Not onely ſo, but we alſo ioye in GodRoma. v. by the meanes of our lorde Ieſus Chriſt, by whom wée haue now receiued the attonement.
               Eternal life is the gift of God, throughRoma. vj. Ieſus Chriſt our Lorde.
               There is no dānation to them whicheRoma. viij. are in Chriſte Ieſu, whiche walke not after the fleſhe, but after the ſpirite.
               We knowe that all thynges woorke for the beſt, vnto them that loue God, and them whiche be appointed before them,

he alſo calleth, and whiche he calleth them he iuſtifieth, and whiche he iuſtifieth, them alſo he glorifieth.
               What ſhall we ſay thē to theſe things, if God be on our ſide, who can be againſt vs, whiche ſpared not his owne ſonne, but gaue him for vs all, how ſhall he not with him giue vs all thinges alſo.
               Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods choſen, it is God that iuſtifieth, who then ſhall condemne, it is Chriſte whiche is dead, ye rather whiche is riſen againe, whiche is alſo on the right hande of God, and maketh interceſſion for vs.
               If thou ſhalt knowledge with thy mouth that Ieſus is the Lorde, and ſhalt beléeue in thy harte, that God rayſed him vp from death, thou ſhalt be ſafe, for the beliefe of the harte iuſtifieth, &amp; to knowledge with thy mouth maketh a mā ſafe.
               Chriſt is the ende of the lawe, to iuſtifieRoma. x. all that beleue.
               None of vs liue vnto himſelfe, if we liue we liue vnto the Lorde: and if we die, we dye vnto the Lorde, whether we lyue therfore or die, we are the Lordes, for Chriſt therfore died and roſe againe, and reuiued, that he might be Lorde both

of quicke, and dead.
               Sainct Paule ſayth: Chriſte Ieſu ofCorrin. i. God is made vnto vs wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemptiō.
               We are waſhed, we are ſanctified, weCorin. vj. are iuſtified, by the name of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; by the ſpirite of our God.
               Chriſt died for our ſinnes, agréeing toCorin. xv. the Scriptures, he was buried and roſe againe the thirde daye, according to the ſcriptures.
               As by Adam al die, euen ſo by ChriſtCorin. xv. ſhal all be made aliue.
               Death is ſwallowed vp in victorie, death where is thy ſting, hell where is thy victorie, the ſting of death is ſynne, and the ſtrength of ſynne is the lawe: hut thankes be vnto God, whiche hath giuen vs victorie through oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte.
               Therefore my deare brethren be ſtedfaſtCorin. xv. and vnmoueable, alwayes riche in the workes of the Lorde, for as muche as ye knowe, as your labor is not in vaine in the Lorde.
               By faith ye ſtande.Corin. j. Corin. iiij.
               
               According as it is written in the 116. Pſalme. I beleue &amp; therefore haue I ſpoken:

we alſo beleue, and therefore ſpeake, for wee knowe that he whiche rayſed vp the Lorde Ieſus, ſhall raiſe vs vp alſo by the meanes of Ieſus, and ſhall ſette vs with you.
               God hath made Chriſt to be ſynne forCorin. v. vs, whiche knewe no ſynne, that we by his meanes ſhoulde be that righteouſneſſe, whiche before God is allowed.
               A man is not iuſtified by the déedes ofGala. j. the lawe, but by the faithe of Ieſus Chriſte, and therfore haue we beleued on Ieſus Chriſt, that we might be iuſtified by the faythe of Chriſte, and not by the déedes of the lawe, becauſe that by the déedes of the lawe, no fleſhe ſhall be iuſtified.
               For the lyfe whiche I nowe lyue inGala. ij. the fleſhe▪ I liue by the faith of the ſonne of God, whiche loued me, and gaue himſelfe for me, I diſpiſe not the grace of GOD, for if righteouſneſſe come by the law, then dyed Chriſt in vaine.
               Abraham beleued to God, and it wasGala. iij. counted to him for righteouſnes.
               The ſcripture ſawe before hande, thatGala. iij. God would iuſtifie the Heathen through faith, and therefore ſhewed before hand

                   whiche are of faith, the ſame are the children of Abraham.
               Chriſt hath delyuered vs from the curſe af the law, and was made accurſſed for vs.
               That we might receyue the promiſe of the ſpirite by fayth.
               The ſcripture concludeth all thinges vnder ſynne, that the promiſe by the faith of Ieſus Chriſte, ſhoulde be giuen to them that beléeue.
               We are all the ſonnes of God by the faith whiche is in Chriſte Ieſus.
               We be all one in Chriſte, Iewe, Gentle, bonde, and frée man and woman.
               If ye be Chriſtes, than are ye AbrahamsGala. v. ſéede, and heires by promiſe.
               Ye are gone quite frō Chriſt, as manyGala. v. as are iuſtified by the Lawe, and are fallen from grace, we looke for and hope in the ſpirite, to be iuſtified through faithe.
               God forbidde that I ſhoulde reioyce inGala. vj. anything, but in the croſſe, death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt

                  .

               By Chriſt we haue redemption thorowEpheſi. j. his bloude, euen the forgiueneſſe of oure ſynnes, according to the riches of his grace.
               By grace are ye made ſafe thoroweEphe. ij. faith, and that not of your ſelues, for it is the gifte of God, and commeth not of workes, leaſt any man ſhoulde boaſte himſelfe.
               We are made nie vnto God by theEpheſi. ij. bloud of Chriſte, for he is our peace, and hath broken downe the wall that was a ſtop betwene vs, and by hym we haue an open waye in one ſpirite vnto the father: nowe therefore we are no more ſtrangers, but citezens with the ſaintes.
               By Chriſte we haue boldeneſſe and entrance, with the confidence whiche we haue by faith in him.

                  In Chriſte we haue redemption thoroweColoſ. j. his bloude, that is to ſaye, the forgiueneſſe of ſynnes.
               In Chriſte dwelleth all fulneſſe, andColoſ. j. thorowe the bloude of his Croſſe, are all thinges reconciled to God the father, &amp; ſet at peace both in heauen and earth.
               We whiche were deade in ſynne, hathColoſ, ij. Chriſt forgiuen vs all our treſpaſſes: and hath put out the hande writing that was againſt vs, contained in the lawe writtē: and that hath he taken out of the waye, and hath faſtned it to his croſſe, and hath ſpoiled rule and power, and hath made a ſhewe of thē openly, and hath triumphed ouer them openly in his owne perſone.Timo. j.
               
               This is a true ſaying, by all meanes worthye to be receyued, that Chriſte Ieſus came into the worlde to ſaue ſynners.
               There is one God, and one MediatorTimo. ij. betwéene God and man, whiche is, the man Ieſus Chriſt, whiche gaue himſelfe a raunſome for all men.
               The power of God hath ſaued vs, andTimo. ij. calleth vs with and holy calling, not according to our deedes, but according to hys owne purpoſe &amp; grace, whiche grace

was giuen thorowe Chriſte Ieſus before the worlde was, whiche hath put away death, and hath brought lyfe and immortalitie vnto lyght, thorowe the Goſpell.
               God hath not ſaued vs for the deedesTitus. iij. of righteouſneſſe, whiche we wrought, but of his mercie hath he ſaued vs.
               Chriſte in his owne perſon hath purgedHebre. j. our ſynnes.

               Chriſte is an euerlaſtyng Prieſthoode:Hebre. vij. wherefore he is able alſo euer to ſaue them that come vnto God by him, for as muche as he euer lyueth to make interceſſion for vs.
