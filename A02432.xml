            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               GOD in tymes paſte,Heb. i. a diuerſlye &amp; many waies ſpake to the fathers by prophetes, but in theſe laſt daies hath he ſpoken vnto vs, as S. Paule ſayeth, by his ſonne, whō he hath made heyre of al thinges, and by him hath he now declared his moſt godlye will vnto vs, that we might obtain life in him: whoſe moſt excellent cleare brightnes hath long time been darkened,Apoc. 6.
                and as S. Iohn ſaieth, hid as with a ſackeclothe made with

heare, yt is to ſay with a fayned ryghtuouſenes grounded vpō naturall wyſdome and carnall reaſon, inuented and ſet fourth by man: So that the bright ſhynyng beames of goddes truth cōteyned in the holy ſcriptures might in no wiſe appere (by reaſon of that dark vaile or cloud) to the eyes or mynde of men, whiche is not yet wyth all men taken awaye.
                  1. Cor. 3. c Neuertheleſſe, when they tourne to the lorde (ſaith Paul) the vayle ſhalbe taken awaye, for no doute, ſaithe he, ye lord is a ſpirit, and where the ſpirite of the lorde is, there is lybertie. And ſeyng that god which is ryche in mercy, hathe once againe put downe ye great power of the enenemy, broken down his braſen gates, and by

vyolence taken the praye (as a ſpoyle) frō out of the mouth of the Lyō, yea victoryouſly hath he delyuered his truth ye longe time hath of his enemies be holdē in bōdage &amp; captiuitie, &amp; we haue herd and ſene theſe thinges, obeyed &amp; do beleue. Therefore am I not aſhamed to teſtyfye the truthe vnto the worlde becauſe it is the poure of God vnto ſaluation,Roma. i. to all them that do deleue. And as Sainct Ihō ſaythe,Ihon. i. i. Ihon. i. the onely trewe lyghte whiche lyghteneth all menne that come into the worlde, our handes haue handeled of the worde of lyfe, for lyfe hath apered, ſaith he, and we haue ſene and beare witnes, &amp; ſhew vnto you lyfe, that is euerlaſtynge whiche was withe the father, &amp;

hath now apered alſo vnto vs. And ye tidyngs which we haue heard of him (as Ihon ſaith) declare we vnto you, that ye may haue felowſhip with vs, &amp; oure felowſhyp may be with the father and with his ſonne Ieſus Chriſte &amp;c.
            ¶For as moche as, it hathe pleaſed the eternall god, which ſeperated me frō my mothers wombe, to lighten the inward eyes of my mynde withe hys grace, and thorowe the knoweledge of his word and working of his holy ſpirite, to worke a perfect repentaunce in me, and amendmente of my formoure lyfe, loue conſtraynethe me too wyl you (good bretheren) to be partakers of this greate benefyte. And for this cauſe, I haue

thought it neceſſary, as well to declare vnto you the daungerouſe harmes that ſynne bryngeth to ſuche as delyte and continew therein, as alſo the vnſpeakeable reward of the righteouſe whiche god hath prepared for thoſe that withe their h

I wyll not withhold frō you, good brethren, that which god hath wrought in me, to incourage the weake ſtomakes, of them that now waxe faynte herted and ſhrynke backe, that I may ſay wyth the Prophete Dauid.Pſal. 39.
                Lord I do not hide thy righteouſenes in my herte, but my talkynge is of thy truthe &amp; ſauynge health, all ye day long.

Therefore tourn not thou thy mercy from me (o lorde) but let thy louyng kyndnes and truth alwayes preſerue me. &amp;c.

She ſhyneth from and out of the boſome of ye higheſt, for her clearenes doth farre excede the brightnes of the ſōne, whiche lighteth the whole erth with her ſhine. Therfore O ye

ignoraunte, geue a diligēt eare to the voice of wiſedom, which daily cryeth vnto you in ye high places ſtretes, and wayes, and before the holy citie, and in the gates where mē go out and in.

the lorde be angry, leaſte thou fall a ſlepe againe in ſynne, and ſo periſhe vtterly by thine own folly. How can theye be made hole that wyll not knowe they be ſicke, or howe can ſuche obtaine that refuſe ye right way? Thou thinkeſt thy ſelfe well al redy, becauſe thou haſt a name that thou liueſt.

                Tuſhe I am riche and increſed with goodes, and haue nede of nothynge, &amp; knoweſt not how thou art wretched and myſerable, poore, blynde, &amp; naked: thou haſte a name that thou liueſt, but thou art deade, for by ſynne art thou ſubdued, and thruſt downe by thyne enemies euen to the brinke of hell. O named Chriſtianytie, thou

waft rolde vp in extreme darknes and myſery, yea ſolde and ſolde again waſt thou for thine offences, to be a bonde ſeruant whereof thou art not yet delyuered, for ignoraunce holdeth the in captiuitie, and bringeth the a ſlepe, that thou neyther ſeeſt nor feleſt thye harme,Eſaye 29.
                but lyke an hongry man dremyng that he is eatyng, &amp; wakynge hath nothinge, or lyke a thyrſty man yt dreameth that he is drinkyng, but when he waketh he fyndeth nothynge to refreſh hym ſelf, ſo doth ſynne deceiue the, and thou not ware. Awake awake oute of thy heauy ſlepe thou Chriſtianitie, harken to ye loud voice and trompe of god which in theſe laſt daies is now blowen amongeſt you. I mean

the preachyng of the gloryouſe goſpell of Chriſt, which is dayly preached vnto you, and yet ſoundeth in youre eares. O folyſh people, why ſtop you youre eares ſo longe from the truth: and as it were, ſtyll geue youre ſelues to vanitie? Why ſeke ye ſuche frendſhyp of the worlde, whiche hath nothyng to recō
               pence, but extreame myſerye? Why ſekeſte thou reſte, where none is? Treaſure vp ſuch thinges as are godly, then ſhalte yu be recompenſed .vij. folde: but who ſo ſeeketh reſt in worldly thynges, his labour is in vain. Conſider O man, thy lyfe in this worlde, how ſhort, how vncerteine, and daungerouſe it is it is lyke a vapour or breathe, ſaith the Apoſtle S. Iames,Iames. 4
                yt
               
appereth for a lytle ſeaſon, and then vaniſſheth away, therfore truſte not to the worlde, for he is diſceitfull, he promyſeth reſt, but payeth trouble, he promyſeth ioye and paieth ſorowe he promyſeth longe lyfe, and payeth ſhort, totally, he promyſeth good and payeth euyll, for nature and fortune be muche variable, &amp; chaunge as the winde and therfore do they ſuffer no thynge here certeine. O folyſh man woldeſt yu then be thought wiſe, and yet delyteſt and ſetteſt thy hole hert and pleaſure in this vaine tranſitory world. what frendſhippe woldeſt thou haue of hym that can do you no good, neither careth he lenger for the then thou maiſt do hym pleaſure, for in ſorow pouertie

or payne, will he vtterly diſpiſe the, and laugh the to ſcorne in the anguyſh of thy ſoule. Soo vngodly doth this myſerable worlde recompence his louers that the nighe frende,O beſtes vngodly &amp; very vnnaturall. ſo called of nature, the wife that lyeth in the boſome, or the Chyldren whom with buſy paine and ſtudy ſome bringe vp, intendynge by them to haue their kindnes after recompenced, do nothing at all regarde them, but flateryngly from the teth outward thinkyng euery day three, tyll they be gone, that they myght receiue the worldely goodes which their frendes do poſſes. O myſery of all myſeries, thus the worlde which many ſo inordinately loue, and ſet ſuch ſtore by, for all his greate bragges,

and flateryng face of frendſhip (if nature withdraw her ſelfe) wyl not onely think hym moch burdened by them, but alſo diſdainfully abhor &amp; deteſte their preſence. Therefore as Chriſte ſaith,Mat. 6. d ſeke ye firſt ye kingdome of god, &amp; the righteouſenes there of, and all theſe thynges ſhalbe myniſtred vnto you. And alſo Criſt ſaith, geue not ouer your membres to ſerue the fleſh, ſeing the beutie thereof fadethe away, for he that ſoweth in the fleſhe,Gal. 6.
                ſhall of the fleſh repe corruptiō, ſaith Sainct Paul, but he that ſoweth in the ſpirite, ſhall of the ſpirite reape lyfe euerlaſtinge. Againe the apoſtle Iude ſaith. Hate the filthy veſture of the fleſſhe, for doubtles it is ſubiect to corruption, it is

alſo, the very gate and meane whereby Sathan oure greate aduerſary, and mortall enemy corrupteth both bodie &amp; ſoule, and draweth man to vtter diſtruction. Wherfore ſee that ye furniſh the houſe in tyme with an honeſt exerciſe of vertu, that perfecte repentaunce make a ready way, for faith and godly loue with all her noble companions, to dwell with you: for if the enemy finde you vnprepared, he will buſily ſeke to enter with his ſoudears, for as moch as, man is by ye tranſgreſſion of Adam, ſet at lybertie in ye knowledge of good and euyll, the enemy firſt moueth man by conſente, to choſe the euill and refuſe the good, which conſent beyng coupled to the thought of

mans knowledge,By the fall of Adam, the inward eye of mā was opened in the knouledge of good and euyll, Iam. 1 c. Mat. 5. c Chriſte ſaith, who ſo loketh on a wyfe luſtynge, hath commytted adultry with her. Exody. 20 Deutro. 5
                is ſynne. As witneſſeth S. Iames ſaying. When luſt hath conceyued, ſhee bringeth fourth ſynne, by this meanes winneth the enemy yt gate or fyrſt ward, then procedinge forth in his wicked purpoſe, he tēpteth mā duryng his life in ye tyme of youth, by wātō
               nes delectatiō, pleaſure &amp; redynes of mynd, to ſpend the tyme of this lyfe, either idely or vainly, that he ſhould laboure in nothing that is good, and when nature hathe ſome what done with theſe, he bringeth in place euery carnal concupiſcēce, riot, naturall wiſdome, and worldly honoure and riches: and in age he bringeth coueteouſenes, vnpacient pouertie, childyſhe dotage, and ſuche lyke. For ſone

after xxx. yeares are ſpent,, as age increaſeth, the thinges of nature dimyniſhe, and begin to fade as a flower, but the enemy alway duryng the tyme of this lyfe, ceaſeth not to aſſaulte man by ſynne, which is moſt agreeing to the nature and age of the perſon ſo tempted. And by ſuche vngodly meanes he ſeketh to fyll and kepe the mynd of man ſo buſied, that it cā haue no reſpecte to the word &amp; wyll of god, nor ſeke after thinges yt pleaſe hym. But ſeinge the rewarde of theſe is naught els but playne myſery and diſtruction bothe of bodye and ſoule, what folyſh blyndnes is it, for men to ſet their loue ſo inordinatelye vpon ſuche thynges wherein is neuer reſt nor peace?

and to ſeke the ſeruice of ſuche maiſters as be very Aucthors of all trouble and myſery, and the bond ſeruantes of ſynne, and corruption, that ſerue thē. Wherfore, ſtryue daily againſt your luſtes, and mortyfie your affections, compell youre fleſhe to be ruled and ordered, by the rules of Chriſte, preſcrybed in the ſacred worde of god, vnto you. Then doubtles our heauenlye father wyll not onelye loue vs, &amp; take vs for hys dear children, but alſo for Chriſtes ſake (ſo that we yet, continew in faith) beare our imperfection durynge the tyme of this lyfe, clearelye forgeue and forget our ſynnes. And make vs partakers with oure ſauioure Chriſte, of hys eternall kyngedome

and glorie. Therfore O ye Chriſtined nations call to remembraunce the longe time of your captiuitie &amp; blyndnes of mynde, which hath very far exceded the tyme of the captyuitie of the Hebrues, the chyldren of Iſrael, or of any other congregations, profeſſyng the truth before you: neuertheles, the mightie lorde of powers, ye onely God of Iſrael, hath now remembred his promyſes, and accordyng to hys oulde wonte hath he loked mercyfully vpon vs, for his names ſake, yea, he hath now herd thy mornyngs O Iſrael, &amp; he is come downe to delyuer Iacob his choſen wt a myghtie hand, &amp; a ſtretched out arme.Rom.

                  . But as S. Paul ſaith. I ſpeake not theſe thynges

ceyued not ye loue of the truth, ſaith he, God ſhall ſende them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhuld beleue lyes, that all they might be dampned (ſaith he) which beleue not the truth but had pleaſure in vnrighteouſenes. &amp;c.
            Neuertheles, god hath now remembred Iſrael his electe, for he wyll alway haue compaſſion vpon Iacob his choſen: therefore, is he now mynded to ſhew mercy, and to delyuer his people, for our Lordes Ielouſſy is waxen greate, to ſee hys truth dayely thus traiterouſely troden vnder foote of hys enemyes, and cleane defaced vnder a coloure of truthe, and wyth a counterfaicte dyſguiſed holynes and outwarde pretence of vertue, whereby the ſymple ignoraunte

ſynners be diſceiued, for bycauſe the pathes of chriſt be ſo troden out, many can find nothyng of the way. Thus the myſterie of iniquitie, as Paul ſaith, workth in his place, wherby the ſynfull man is opened, and the ſonne of perdition, whiche is an aduerſarie, is exalted aboue all that is called God, or of God, for the vaine glorie of man apereth on earth to haue the vpper hande.In earthe worldly wiſedome hath gotten the chayre, or vpper ſeat Is not natural, or carnal reaſon and worldly wyſedome, moſt hyghlieſt eſteemed? Who amongeſte men knoweth anye thynge lyke, or that may be compared vnto it? Where is the wiſdome of God become? Is it not vtterly diſpiſed of the blynde worlde, and ſet at naughte, and not regarded.

How longe write thou mocke with thy god, and beare a double hert, that goeth two waies: ye pretende in face to haue a greate zeale, and too be very feruent in the waye of the lorde, but youre hertes run after your couetouſe lucre, and daily ye walke in youre owne waies &amp; lyue after your owne luſtes, and yet ye ſay, tuſſhe we be well inou

And for ſo muche as ye haue ſhot ye weake ſhepe vpon the ſides and ſhoulders, and runne vpon thē with your hornes,Ezech. 34.

            Moreouer I will make a couenaunt of peace with thē, ſaith

Thus ſhal they vnderſtād that I the Lord their god am with them, and that they (euen the houſe of Iſrael) are my people ſaith the lord god: ye mē ar my flocke, ye are ye ſhepe of my paſture, and I am youre God &amp;c.
            O ye people turne frō your croked wayes, and from youre owne frowarde imaginacions, ceaſſe &amp; leaue of from your own fayned diſſimulacion. Dareſt yu ſo diſſemble with God, and to play the part of an infidel or vnfaithfull hypocrit before hym? Thynkeſt thou to hyde thy ſelf vnder thyne owne ſhaddowes from hym that made thee, and

put thy herte in a ſecrete place Or wylte thou thynke to hyde thy ſinnes with deceit, that the higheſt (which ſearcheth ye her
                  •
                and ye raynes) ſhall not reproue thy wayes? ye come togyther / as god ſayde to the Iewes, by his prophet / after the maner of a greate people,Ezech. 33.
                to heare his word at the mouth of the preacher or prophet, but in no wyſe wyll ye do thereafter. In your mouthes / lykewyſe ye ſhewe youe ſelfes as though ye were feruent, but your heartes goo after youre owne couetous lucre, and as a balade that hath a ſwete tune, and is pleaſaunt to ſyng, ſo is the Preacher vnto you his wordes wyll ye heare ſaith the lord / but ye wil not do thereafter. &amp;c.
            
               For vaine glorie and lucre, ye make croked lawes, wherby ye laye ſnares for the feete of the ſymple: and wolde ye that noo man ſhould reproue your waies? The mouth of the diſceitful is right well with you alowed, but he that ſpeaketh the truth,To deale with equitie &amp; truth men ſaye playnelye they can not lyue. ſhal not eſcape vnpuniſſhed: for crafte, diſceyte and falſhode, is ſuche an vniuerſall thinge, that to deale with equitie and truth men ſay playnelye they can not lyue, and thus vertue is ſo generally contempned, that it is nigh a common reproche, for a man to do well. O lord, as Dauid ſaith, when wilte thou loke vpon this? O reſtore my ſoule frome the wycked rumoure of them and my darlynge from ye Lyon, for they are ſtained with

their owne workes, and runne a horinge after their own ymagination, for daily do they blaſpheme thy name, &amp; ſlaunder ye foote ſteps of thyne anointed, &amp; yet wil they be knowen for ſuch as know their god, hold of him, &amp; ar feruēt in his wais. For thei ſay in their hertes, tuſſhe God ſeeth it not, the higheſt regardeth none of theſe thynges, although god by longe pacience, ſuffer ſuch thinges at their handes loking and tariyng for thy amendmente (O Chriſtianitie) thinkeſt thou yt it wyl be forgoten? Hath there euer any nation which cōmitted like abhominations before ye, eſcaped vnpuniſſhed? And doſt yu thinke to eſcape? Naye thou ſhalte ſurelye drinke of ye ſame, thou ſhalt not

be forgotē: but thy ſynnes ſhall truly be recompenſed in the (euen into thy boſome) god ſhall tourne thy clothes ouer thye heade (O thou filthy herlot) yt thy filthynes may many feſtely appere alſo: and ſeyng thou art a people ye runneſt in thine own wilfull wayes, and ſaieſt, tuſſhe there ſhal no faulte be found in all my doinges: therefore, ſtom bleſt thou in the clere day, &amp; falleſt in the darke, yea, grope do ye as blynde men, after youre own ymagination, but becauſe ye let your handes deale with wickedneſſe, ye can not fynd ye right way.Pſal. 13.
                For as the Pſalme ſaith, your fete are ſwift to ſhed bloud, deſtructiō and wretchednes are in youre waies, but the way of peace haue ye not knowen.

O yee frowarde people heare the word of the lord, giue your eares to doctrine, and diſpiſe not good coūſell, ſeke frendſhip of god by vertu, &amp; not by flaterie, for ye lord is alway frendly to them that put their truſte in hym, but ye call your ſelues chriſtians, and yet commyt wickednes with your mouthes, ye extolle Chriſtes worde, name, lawes and ſacramentes, but in your deedes ye diſhonour him for as longe verely as ye delite in euyll, your deades are hated of God, and yet ſaye with dyſceite wyll we eſcape,Eſai. 28.
                and withe nymblenes wyl we defend our ſelues, therfore are ye curſed wt penurie: ye choſe ignorance for your guide, &amp; wylfulnes too be your gouernour, as for ye warninges

of the Prophetes,They yt truſte in their own wiſedom, or in any other thīg of fleſſhe &amp; bloud ſhal ſurely erre and be diſceiued. Eſai. 19. Egipte ſignifiethe ye congregation of wylfull ſynners. yee take for winde, and the worde of god for a ſcorne, becauſe yee haue no luſte thereto, and thus they go wrong by reaſō of wine (ſaith the lorde) they fall &amp; ſtacker becauſe of ſtronge drinke: yea, the prieſtes &amp; Prophetes them ſelues go amys, they are dronken with wine, and weake brained thorow ſtrong drinke. They erre in ſeing, &amp; in Iudgemente they faile. For the lorde hath made Egipte dronken wt the ſpirite of errour, ſaith Eſai, and they ſhall vſe it in all maters, euē lyke as a dronkē man gooeth ſpewinge aboute. For Egipte ſhall lacke good counſell (ſaith he) ſo yt they ſhall not know what to do, neither ye beginning, nor thend neither vpō
               
ye land nor water, then ſhall the Egiptians be lyke vnto womē afraide and aſtonied at the lyftinge vp of the hande, whiche the lorde of hooſtes,Eſai. 24.
                ſaith Eſai, ſhall lyfte vp ouer them &amp;c.
            Myſerably ſhall the worlde be waſted and cleane deſtroyed, for the lorde hath ſo determyned in hym ſelfe &amp;c.
            For the earth is corrupte of her indwellers, for whye they haue offended the lawes chaū
               ged their ordinaunces, &amp; made the euerlaſtinge Teſtament of none effects, and therefore ſhal the curſe deuoure the earth: for they that dwell thereon haue ſinned. And although theſe places come dayly vpon you from the lorde, for your offences, yet yee ſee it not, nor regarde the

matter noothinge at all: O ye blynde and frowarde nations,Eſai. 1.
                therefore, though ye holde out your handes, yet tourn I mine eyes from you ſaith the lord, &amp; though ye make many prayers yet here I nothinge at all, for your handes are full of bloude, and ye deale alway with wyckednes, becauſe certeine ſynne hath no outward punyſhment, apointed by ye rulers, for thoſe that do them: Thinke ye therfoore, that God wyll forgette them?
            The people in Chriſtes tyme (whyle he raygned vppon the earthe) thoughte that thooſe Galathians whoſe bloude Pilate myngled with theyr owne ſacrifyce, and the .xviii. perſons vpon whome the towre of SiloahLuke. 13.
               
               
fell, and ſlewe, had beene moche greater ſynners then the other that ſuffered no ſuch punyſhmente, but our ſauiour Chriſt ſayde playnely, nay and excepte the other repeted, they ſhoulde lyke wyſe periſſhe, althoughe they ſuffered no ſuche punyſhment here, therefore remembre thy ſelfe, O thou named Chriſtianytie, repente in tyme, and tourne to the Lorde wyth thy hole herte. Too you do I ſpeake, O yee Ignoraunt people, gette ye to moornynge quyckely, and poure oute your teares befoore hym / that hee maye ſhewe mercye and tourn all wayes hys wrathe frome you. &amp;c.
            O tourn you, tourne you,

why will ye dye,Ezech. 18. 3. Par. 3.
                ſeyng the lord hath no pleſure in the death of a ſinner, but willeth rather that he conuert and liue. &amp;c. But yf ye withdraw your eares, &amp; will not heare, to turne frō your euil wayes: then am I ſory for your ſakes. Bee not wilfully blynde, but ſearche the ſcriptures, and ye ſhal ſee, that no people or nacion that did ſuche abhominacions and hated to be refourmed ſince the beginnyng eſcaped vnpuniſhed: and would ye eſcape?Pſal. 33.
                Then muſt ye refuſe the euill, &amp; chooſe the good: ſeke peace and enſue or folowe it, for the eyes of the lord are ouer the righteous, and his eares are opē vnto their prayers: but the face of the lord beholdeth thē that do euill, to deſtroy the remēbrance

of them out of the earth. &amp;c.
            
               Prou. 3.
               yea the curſſe of the lorde is in the houſe of the vngodly, but he bleſſeth the righteous. Conſider theſe thynges with your ſelues in time, leſt ſinne by long cuſtome blind your vnderſtandyng, ſo that ye iudge derknes for light and good for euill: ye knowe the blynde are eaſye to leade out of the way, wher thei ſone fall and be made a pray for the enemy.
                  Pro. 22.8. Wherefore beloued geue diligent eare vnto wiſedom whiche hath now agayne opened her flouddes and putte forth her voyce in the ſtreetes, ſhe booeth call before the congregacion in the open gates, &amp; ſheweth her wordes in the citie O ye chyldren ſayeth ſhe, howe long will ye loue childiſheneſſe?

how long will the ſkorners delite in ſkorning, and the vnwiſe be enemies to knowledge? O turne ye to my correccion, ſaith ſhe, lo I will expreſſe my minde vnto you, and make you vnderſtand my wordes. For who ſo herkeneth vnto me ſhal dwelle ſafely, and haue inough wtoute any feare of euill.Pro. 22.
                Again ſhe ſaieth, my ſonne: let not theſe thinges departe from thyne eyes, but kepe my lawe &amp; my councel ſo ſhall it be lyfe vnto thy ſoule and grace vnto thy mouth, thē ſhalte thou walke ſafelye in the way, and thy fote ſhal not ſtumble, if thou ſlepeſt thou ſhalt not nede to be afrayed, but yu ſhalte take thy reſt and ſlepe ſwetely, thou ſhalt not nede, ſayeth ſhe, to bee afrayed of any ſoodayne

feare, neither for the violēt ruſhyng in of the vngodly whē it cometh, for the lord ſhalbe beeſide thee,Prouer. 1,
                and kepe thy fote that thou be not takē. O ye beloued children, herken vnto wiſdom: Come no more in the pathes of the vngodly, ſaieth ſhe, &amp; walke not in the way of the wicked.
            Take faſt holde of doctrine and let her not go, kepe her, for ſhee is thy life. And again ſhe ſaieth, my ſonne marke my woordes, for the pathe of the rightuouſe ſhineth as the light, and is euer brighter and brighter vnto the perfite day, but the waye of the vngodly is as the darknes, ſaieth ſhe, wherin men fall or they be aware.Prouer 4.
                And moreouer ſhe ſaith, heare ye chyldren the fatherlye exhortacion, and take

good hede that ye maye learne wiſdom, yea I ſhall geue you a good reward, yf ye wil not forſake my lawe, ſaith wiſdom. &amp;c. The chief poynt of wiſedom is to be willing to attain wiſdom. Therefore let thy hert receyue my wordes (ſaith ſhe) and kepe my commaundementes, &amp; thou ſhalt liue. Obey vnto god, and then ſhall ye receiue a good ſpirite of hym, which (as S. Iohn ſaith) wyll looſe the woorkes of ſynne, &amp; geue you a will to loue him, and to kepe his commaundementes:1. Io. 3. for thei that ar born of hym ſynne not (ſaieth he) becauſe they haue the ſede remaining in them,Where ye Spirite of god is, ſaieth Paule, there is libertie. the earneſt of our ſaluacion: I meane the ſpyrite of truth, the ioyfull coumforter whiche god hath promiſed that

ſhall alwayes abyde with them that looue hym, euen vnto the ende of the worlde. This is he that loſſeth the workes of ſinne and bringeth a godly deſire vnto righteouſnes and a longing to fulfull the wyl of god: &amp; they that haue opteined a mynde to loue god are begotten &amp; borne of hym and they are knowen &amp; loued of hym. And herby know we ſaith Ihon,1. Io. 1. ye god abydeth in vs euen by the ſpirite which he gaue vs as it is writē: To as many as receiue him giueth he power to be ye ſons or children of god,Io. 1.
                euen thooſe that beleue in his name, which are not born of bloude, nor of the wyll of the fleſh nor of the wyll of man, but of God. The vngodlye are the bonde ſeruauntes of ſynne, becauſe

they are carnally minded their hertes hate god,He that is an enemy to vertue &amp; goodnes hateth god. thoughe theyr lyppes praiſe hym, which is all goodnes, yea, the onelye well and fountayne there of. They lacke true obedience too the word and wyll of god, therfore can they not optain to that rightouſnes, which before god, is alowed.The lorde wyll viſite thē, whoſe fore ſkīne is vncircū
                  cyſed. For theire hertes and eares are vncircumciſed, yt they wyl not heare, to learne obedience, leaſte they ſhould conuerte and be healed. And therfore, runne they aſtray and eſtablyſh their own righteouſnes, for vnfaithfully haue they denied the lorde in dede, and ſaid, it is not he. Tuſh (ſay they) there ſhal no miſfortune come vpō vs we ſhal ſee neither ſweard nor hunger, as for the warnynges

of the prophetes, thei regard it not: There is almoſt none, neyther that will tell thē their ſynnes nor geue them warnyng of the plagues that are come vpō them,Iere. 6.8.
                or ſhall happen vnto thē: for from the leaſt to the moſte, they hang altogether vpon couetouſnes,Oſeas. 3.
                and from ye prophet to the prieſt, thei go altogether about with falſhod and lies. &amp;c.
            For lyke as a net is full of birdes, ſo are theyr houſes full of that whiche they haue gotten with falſehode and diſceit, ſaith the lord.Ieremi. 5.
                Here of cometh theyr great ſubſtaunce and rycheſſe, and hereof are they fatte and welthye, and are runne awaye fro me with ſhamefull blaſphemies, ſayth the lord, they minyſtre not the lawe, they make no

end of the fatherles cauſe, they iudge not the poore according to equitie: ſhoulde not I punyſh theſe thynges, ſaythe the lorde?That is not onelye on theſe, but aſwell on al other ſuch lyke. Should I not be auenged of all ſuch people as theeſe be? Horrible and greuouſe thinges are doone in the lande, the Prophetes teache falſely, and the prieſtes folowe thē, and my people hathe pleaſure therein. May ſuch thinges at any time or in anye people be vnpunyſſhed? Therefore, repente and tourne from your euyll waies, that ye may enter into the reſt of God, and kepe his holy Sabothes, for they that enter into the reſte of god, do ceaſe frome their owne workes, ſaith Paul as God dyd ceaſe from his, the vii. daye: and excepte ye keepe

the holy feaſte of tabernacles yt is to ſay, ceaſe from your owne wyl, and from doing your own workes: The Lorde wyll conſume you, in his wrath, and vtterly deſtroye you, in his ſoore diſpleaſure. For thus ſayth the lorde, I am excedynge gelouſe ouer Ieruſalem and Sion,zacha. 1.
                and am ſoore diſpleaſed at the careles heathen, for I was but a lytle angrye, and they dyd theyr beſte, that I might diſtroy thē. Neuertheleſſe, I wyll tourne me againe in mercy toward Ieruſalem, ſo that my houſe ſhall be builded in it, ſaith the lorde of hooſtes. &amp;c.
            
               zacha. 1.
               Cry and ſpeake, thus ſayth the lorde of hoſtes, my Cities ſhall be in good proſperitie, againe the Lorde ſhall yet comforte

Sion, and chooſe Ieruſalem. yea Hieruſalem ſhalbe in habited with out any wall,zacha. 2.
                for the multitude of the people &amp; cattell that ſhall be therein, yea I my ſelfe (ſaith the lorde) wyll be vnto her a wal of fyre, round about, and wyl be honoured in her.Oſeas. 3.
                For although the children of Iſrael ſytte a longe whyle wythout Kyng or Prince, withoute offeryng, and aulter with out prieſt &amp; reuelacion, yet ſhall the children of Iſrael conuerte ſaith the prophete Oſeas, and ſeke the lorde their god, &amp; Dauid their king, and in the latter daies, ſaith he, they ſhal worſhip the lord &amp; his louyng kindnes.
            Therefore, ſeyng that God hath nowe called you by his grace, be not negligent to come,

and ſe that the herte be eſtablyſhed with grace,He that both righteouſenes is of god, and not with ye vain pleaſures of this world, whiche ſhal not profite thē that haue their pleaſure and felicitie in them. For who ſo dooeth not righteouſnes is not of God: yf we ſay, we haue felowſhip with him,To walke in darknes is to do ſuche deades as wee all did, before we knewe the truthe. and yet walke in derknes / ſaith S. Iohn / we do lye, &amp; doe not the truth. Therfore ſe that ye loue not the world, neyther the thinges that are in ye world for the world paſſeth away, and the luſtes thereof: but he ye fulfilleth the wyll of god, abydeth for euer,1. Io. 3. and hereby knowe we that he abydeth in vs, euen by the ſpirite whiche he hath geuē vs.Apoca. 3.
                And they that ouercome ſhall obtain a croune of glorye, and I wil geue to euery one of

you (ſaith the veritie of god) accordyng to his workes. &amp;c.
            Babes, flee from the worſhippyng of idols, I meane frō ſeruyng of your owne luſtes, and learne to ſerue the liuyng god in ſpirite, in a cleane hert / waſſhed frō an euil conſcience, with reuerence and godly feare / for our god (ſaith Paul) is a conſuming fier. To as mani as walk accordyng to this rule, peace, and mercie be vpon them, and vpon Iſrael of god. So be it.
