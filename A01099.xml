            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            A declaration touching a booke lately
printed &amp; entituled, The Profane ſcheſme of
the Brovvniſtes.
            CHriſtian reader, there vvas of late a booke publiſhed in
London vnder this title, The profane ſchiſme of the Brouniſtes;
Such a booke indeed vve ſent by one of vs to be printed there, but
in the publiſhing thereof great iniury hath bene done vnto vs,
&amp; chiefely three vvayes, by addition, by detraction &amp; by alteration
of the ſame:
            For the firſt, beſides the addition of ſundry harſh vvordes &amp;
phraſes of hereſies, blaſphemies, diabolus, horrible crimes &amp; c. in
ſuch place vvhere they vvere not vſed by vs, vvhich yet according
to the doctrine of the Brovvniſtes themſelves may iuſtly
be applyed vnto them; beſides the addition in the title of the
booke vvhich is doubly encreaſed by the publiſher thereof; beſide
the addition of the other titles of the ſeverall chapters vvith
a nevv table thereof added in ſtead of that vvhich vve had made;
beſides ſundry other ſuch additions, there be alſo added ſome
thinges directly contrary to our meaning &amp; ſuch as never came
into our heads, as namely thoſe vvordes in the end of the preface,
as alſo to vvarne all ſuch as haue bene the occaſion of thoſe hereſies &amp;
ſchiſmes to conforme themſelues to the church of God, that theſe caterpillars
may no more riſe out of them. And although vve be &amp; c. By thoſe
vvordes the reader might conceive as though vve affirmed
thoſe miniſters vvhich do refuſe ſubſcription &amp; conformity vnto
the prelacy &amp; ſuperſtitious ceremonies vſed in the church of
England, to have bene the occaſion of Brovvniſme &amp; guilty of
that ſchiſme &amp;c. But the truth is othervviſe, there vvere no
ſuch vvordes vvritten in the booke vvhich vve ſent to be printed,
but they are foyſted in &amp; obtruded vpon vs by ſome falſifyer
vvithout our knovvledge or conſent, Our iudgement is that

the tyranny of Lord BBs &amp; their impoſitions are a ſtumbling
block vnto many that are vveake vvhich do thereby take occaſiō
to fall from the church &amp; to runne into ſchiſme. VVe aſſure our
ſelves that if there vvere in the church of England ſuch a reformatiō
of the prelacy &amp; ceremonies as is deſired by the miniſters
there &amp; is alſo obteyned in other reformed churches, there
vvould not thē be ſuch a defection vnto Brovvniſme as novv the
re is. VVe knovv indeed that the Brouniſtes do ioyne vvith the
prelates in vpbrayding the miniſters vvith this thing &amp; vvould
ſeeme to build their ſeparation vpon the teſtimony of the miniſters,
as appeareth by this booke of Deleſcluſe, vvhere he labours
to conclude their ſeparation from certaine ſpeeches of Mr.
Brightman teſtifying againſt the corruptions of the church of
England, but hovv vniuſtly &amp; abſurdly he hath done the ſame
vve hope it vvil evidently appeare by this refutation follvving.
            Secondly, there is in ſumme left out the greateſt part of the
booke vvhich vve ſent to be printed, yea in exact account there is
not a fourth part there of that is printed: In ſpeciall there is not
a third part of the preface printed vvherein our reaſons for the
maner of publishing that booke are conteyned; there is left out
a large anſvver vnto a narratiō vvrittē by Mr. Iohnſon touching
an offer of conference that vvas made vnto him; likevviſe the anſvver
vnto the groundes of ſcripture alledged by M. Iohnſon in
in defence of ſeparation is left out; Divers teſtimonies of Dutch
&amp; french miniſters againſt thē be omitted, vvith other vvritinges
of Iohn Iohnſon &amp; George Iohnſon that ſhould have bene printed:
The greateſt part of the vileſt ſlanders of the Brouniſtes are
left out: The greateſt number of the chapters by far is omitted;
that vvhich ſhould have bene the tenth chapter is made the firſt
nine of the firſt being altogether omitted, beſides ſundry other
in the middes of the booke; &amp; of thoſe chapters that are there, no
one of thē is fully ſet doune, &amp; in ſome of thē more thē half the
matter omitted: Divers ſtrāge matters are noted in the booke, but
the occaſiō there of, the profes thereof vvith the anſvver vnto

the vaine cavilles &amp; ſhiftes of the Brouniſtes about the ſame are
omitted, &amp; in reſpect of theſe omiſſiōs divers thinges ſo abruptly
ſet dovvne may ſeeme more harſh &amp; alſo more incredible vnto
the reader; ſo that hereby it may eaſily appeare hovv vve are iniuried
by vnreaſonable omiſſions as vvell as by vniuſt additions.
            Thirdly, for the method &amp; order of ſetting dovvne theſe thinges
that are printed, there is great alteratiō therein alſo: Thinges
ſpokē vpō one occaſiō are related vpon an other, &amp; not in their
due place; The ſpeeches of one mā are ſo ſet doune as if they had
bene ſpokē by an other; The ſpeeches of divers men are peeced
togather as if they had bene ſpokē by one &amp; the ſame perſon. In
theſe &amp; ſuch like chāges both vve &amp; thoſe vvhoſe teſtimonies are
alledged by vs have receyved ſome further iniurye.
            Beſides theſe thinges there be alſo as it appeareth many literall
faults in the miſprinting of ſundry vvordes vvhich do much
corrupt the ſenſe of ſundry thinges in the booke.
            And though thus many &amp; great iniuries be done vnto vs yet do
vvee not hitherto fully vnderſtād by vvhō they are done: Onely
this vve vnderſtād by a letter ſēt frō Chr. Lavvne vvho vvas ētruſted
vvhich this buſines, that the according to the order in ſuch like
caſes ſeeking vnto ſuch as vvere appoynted for the allovvāce
of bookes to be printed, &amp; leaving it in the hāds of a certaine chaplaine
of the Archb to get it read over &amp; vievved ūtill he himſelf
might returne out of the coūtry into vvhich he vvas thē going
dovvne before he could come vp to Lōdō againe he foūd the booke
already printed cōtrary to his expectatiō, &amp; in the printing thereof
ſo mangled &amp; defaced as is above ſpecifyed.
            And hovvſoever vve do novv diſclayme this booke above mentioned as
none of ours being thus corruptly printed vvith ſuch additions, omisſions
&amp; alterations, yet do vve ſtill acknovvledge that all the particular matters
of fact recorded againſt the the Brvvoniſtes in that booke are ſuch tiges as
vvere takē out of our vvriting▪ &amp; for proofe thereof vve are able &amp; ready
to produce our teſtimony &amp; vvitneſſe as occaſion ſhall requi
                  •
               e; The moſt
of thē are teſtifyed &amp; cōfeſſed by thēſelves &amp; the moſt heynous thinges evē
vnder their ovvne hād vvriting; &amp; the reſt are ſuch thīges as either vve our
ſelves or others vvil vvitneſſe. And therfore though vve complaine

Brovvniſtes inſult there vpon; though vve be vvronged, yet are
not they cleared from the matters there noted vvhich are ſtill in
force againſt them.
            Our deſire &amp; our purpoſe is hereafter as occaſion, opportuinty
&amp; meanes ſhal be offred more fully to manifeſt their Profane
ſchiſme by the publishing of thoſe thinges vvhich formerly have
bene omitted, &amp; in the meane time vve do here preſent vnto
the reader a fevv obſervations vpon the advertiſement of Iean
Deleſcluſe vvhich he hath vvritten againſt Mr. Brightman &amp; againſt
the communion of ſaintes; His perverſe collections for ſeparation
dravvne from Mr. Brightman his Teſtimony, vve have
here ſhevved to be vaine &amp; vvicked. The principles of Brovvniſme
vvhich he hath briefely alledged are here breefely anſvverd,
yet ſo as that the vanity &amp; errour of their ſeparation may
be eaſily diſcerned hereby: This labour vve have vndertaken
cheefely for the comfort &amp; helpe of thoſe vveake brethren, vvho
either do not ſufficiently vnderſtād the iniquity of this errour of
the Brouniſtes or els do not duely conſider the danger of this
ſchiſme vvhich as it dayly breakes it ſelf in pieces, ſo vvould it
alſo break, ruinate &amp; overthrovv all the churches that ſhould
admit &amp; receyve the ſame. vvhen corruptions do encreaſe &amp; are
maynteyned, let the godly vvitneſſe againſt the ſame, but let
them not fret vnto ſeparation, &amp; ſo ſhall they vvalke vvith
Chriſte in vvhite, Reu. 3. 4.
         
         
            
            An anſvver vnto the advertiſement of
Iean Deleſcluſe concerning Mr. Brightman
vpon the Apocalyps.
            
               1.
               
                  WHereas in his title he pretendes to advertiſe the
godly reader, whom afterward in his Epiſtle he calles
Gentle reader and Chriſtian reader, marke how this
man doth mocke his reader; for by his profesſion of Browniſme
he holdes all the membres of the church of England
to be no viſible Chriſtians, to be without true faith &amp; without
godlines, even eve-ry one as they are publique profeſſours
of the goſpel in that church &amp; yet here in this flattering title of his Engliſh
booke he diſſembles notably as though he would honour &amp; record their
godlines; And thus in the very forehead of his booke, his hypocriſy beginnes to
ſhew it ſelf.
            
            
               2.
               VVHereas in his title he takes on him to advertiſe every godly reader of
Mr. Tho. Brightmā
                   his booke, how abſurd &amp; ſenſeleſſe is it? There
be many godly readers of Mr. Brightmās booke which vnderſtād no Engliſh at al,
ſeing it is extant in Latine, &amp; yet he writes in Engliſh to advertiſe every one of
them.
            
            
               3.
               IN the ſame place he alledgeth againſt the church of England that ſaying of the
Prophet 1. Kim 18. 21. How long halt ye betweene two opinions? If the
lord be God follow him, but if Baal be he then go after him. This is
vniuſtly applied againſt them who are aſſured of their lawfull communion with
that church; but this ſentence or the like may much more fitly be alledged againſt
the divided &amp; diſtracted Browniſtes, who halt betweene two opinions, &amp; betweene
two communions, ſome halting after the Franciſcane order, ſone limping
after the Ainſworthian &amp; popular order, ſome hanging in doubt betwixt
both opinions, ſo that they dare not ioyne to either of them, but walk
alone.
            
            
               4.
               THe firſt cauſe which mooved him to put forth this writing in defence of the
ſeparatiō, he ſets downe in theſe wordes:Epiſt. to Read. pag. 3. 
                  Firſt the glory of my God etc.
                  
what meanes he by this ſpeech of his God, in ſaying, the glory of my God?
Hath he and his flock a ſpeciall God of his owne more then other churches of
Chriſte? It is true indeed that David &amp; other faithful ſervants of God do often
with the voyce of faith vſe to ſpeak of God in this manner, my king and my
God as Pſ. 84. 3. but yet if we looke a litle further into the profeſſion of the
Browniſtes we may eaſily imagine ſome other cauſe of their ſpeaking on this manner:
for whereas R. R. in his prophecying among the prophets of Mr. Aniſworthes
company teſtifyed againſt their ſeparation &amp; iuſtifyed the church of England
to be a true church, being for this vniuſtly excommunicate of that company
it was as vniuſtly defended by Mr. Ainſworth, who layd this groud of his excommunicatiō
frō 
                  Deu. 13. 1. 2. &amp;c. that he had ſought to turne thē away frō the
Lord their God &amp; had perſwaded them to go after other Gods and to ſerve
thē, &amp; all this onely for perſwading that it was lawfull to heare a ſermō in the
church of Engl. to pray with thē &amp;c: In this proceeding they declare that they
hold the church of Engl. to be withovt the true God in that they cōdemne thoſe
that ioyne with the ſame to turne away frō the Lord their God &amp; to go after other
God
                     •
                   and therfore no marvel if according to this opinion they ſpeak of their ſpecial
God, intending an other God whom we know not. This may yet further
appeare in the ſpeech of Delecluſe who being blamed for his ſchiſme from the
french church hath here vpon cōdemned that reformed church as having Chriſte
to be neither their King, prieſt nor Prophet: And if they be without
Chriſte then are they without true God, Ioh. 2. Epiſt. verſ. 9. and Ioh. 17.
3. According to theſe ſpeeches it is not ſtrange nor inconſequent that he ſhould
meane his ſpeciall God in the forenamed phraſe. Iemar the monſtro
                     •
                  s Arrian
pretending that we erre about the nature of Chriſte doth blaſphemouſly affirme
that our God is no better then the planke vnder his foote, Deleſcluſe the inordinate
Browniſt pretending that Chriſte is not our king doth hereby ſacrilegiouſly
both deprive Chriſte, of his people &amp; his people of their God, their ſaviour &amp; their
mediatour: And thus while he pretendes the glory of his God, he treades
vnder his feete the glory of that everlaſting God, who is the God &amp; king of all
the reformed churches round about.
            
            
               5.

this treati

                  e in defence of Browniſme, he alledgeth divers ſcriptures which
teach that the people of God ought to be holy as the Lord is holy, as namely,
Levit. 19. 2. 1. Pet. 1. 5. 16. But what meanes he by this? Can
not the people of God be holy &amp; ſanctifyed vnleſſe they ſeparate from the churches
as the Browniſtes doe? or can they not give glory vnto God without their
ſeparation? we ſee the contrary throughout the ſcriptures; the,Pſ. 43. 1. 2 3. 4. Eſa. 1. 10. Ma

Deleſcluſe hath ſchiſmed and runne away▪
               
            
            
               
               6.
               VNto his other allegation, that all thoſe that call vpon the name of
Chriſte ſhould depart from iniquitye, 2. Tim. 2. 19. It may alſo
be anſwered as the former that the moſt holy ſervants of God, moſt zealous of
his glory have kept communion which open ſinners as offenſiue as 
                     〈…〉
                   the
church of England, &amp; yet departed from iniquity: It is a great

ſchiſmatiques that cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt departing from iniquity and departing
from a church where iniquity is tolerated. Chriſte

               7.
               THe ſecond reaſon which he alledges for his writing of this treatiſe is the fervent
deſire which (he ſayth) he hath of the ſalvation of mens ſoules
and the gayning of them vnto God, If this be ſo (as he boaſteth) we
do prayſe and commend him for it, but yet if he had bene as ſober and modeſt
as he is fervent, he would not have bene ſo forward to prayſe his owne fervency,
in that we commend him not, nor yet in this, that he ſeemes to ſeeke the ſalvation
of mens ſoules by leading them into his ſchiſme or ſeparation.
            
            
               8.
               IN the declaration of this ſecond reaſon he telles vs that the meanes of ſaying
ſoules is to ſhew vnto the their erring from the truth and from going
aſtray out of the way, Iam. 5. 19. 20.: But how vnfit a man is Iean deleſcluſe
for ſuch a purpoſe? Do not all the Browniſtes generally know and conſider
how prone this man is to runne into errour and to go aſtray out of the
way before many others? Among all their Prophets is there any which in the
exerciſe of prophecy have ſo often bene corrected for errour as this man? His
manner is indeed to be fervent and hote, but in his heate ſo raſh and inconſiderate
that often he vtters erroneous thinges and often by Mr. Iohnſon and
Daniel ſtudly hath he bene reproved and convicted of the ſame. He that
hath ſo often receyved open ſhame and rebuke for his errour is not ſo meete a
man to become the cenſurer of ſo learned and iudicious a writer as Mr. Brightman
is generally acknowledged to be.
            
            
               9.
               THe third reaſon which he alledgeth for the publiſhing of this treatiſe, is
in reſpect of him ſelf, having had a hand both in the tranſlating

and printing of Mr. Britghtman his booke etc. But of this he may ſpeake
with ſhame enough in reſpect of his vnfaithfull dealing herein: for being appoynted
by his maiſters that ſet him on worke to print this booke &amp; that without
any leave to comment vpon it or to adde his cenſures, what doth this cooſening
companion but goes &amp; cauſeth his gloſes to be printed in the margent of
this booke? He there lets downe in oppoſition vnto Mr. Brightman, his contradictions
of him, his interrogations, his exclamations againſt him O England
etc. O Brightman etc. Yea his citations of him vnto indgement, let
God and his angelles and all the world indge etc. And thus without the
conſent or licenſe of thoſe that employed him in their buſines, he defaces &amp; diſgraceth
the work committed vnto him, offendeth his maiſters, wronges the reader,
&amp; iniurieth the authour of the books who now ſleepeth in peace with the
Lord: But when this his deceit was found out, thoſe that were at coſt &amp; charges
for the printing of this booke did then call him to account for this his bad
daaling &amp; in fine compelled him at his owne charges to take the paines to alter
and ſet over againe thoſe ſheetes of the booke which he had corrupted &amp; defaced
with his marginall gloſes &amp; then to leave out thoſe gloſes which he had before ſo
boldly &amp; deceitfully inſerted in that worke: for the evidence &amp; truth of this
matter we have both the teſtimony of thoſe that ſet him on worke, as alſo his
owne handy-work to reprove him, viz. the miſprinted ſheetes, the tokens of his
deceit, which we keep by vs for a monument of his falſhood. The truth is that
Iean Deleſcluſe did fret &amp; chafe when this rebuke was layd vpon him, but
howſoever part of his puniſhment was remitted vnto him, yet was there no remedy,
divers ſheetes muſt needes be printed againe &amp; he muſt endure the paine
&amp; labour for the ſetting of the ſame: And thus we may ſee the ſaying of the wiſe
man to be verifyed in him, The deceitfull man coſteth not that which
he tooke in hunting, Prov. 12. 27. The wages which he got by ſetting
thoſe ſheets deceitfully at firſt was not ſo much, but the labour the loſſe &amp; the
ſhame withall which he had at the reprinting thereof may well be thought to be
much more.
            
            
               10.
               IN the declaration of this his third reaſon, he telles vs of his full perſwaſion
that there be errours &amp; abberrations in Mr. Br. his book &amp; therfore addeth further;
If I had held my peace and ſayd nothing I could not have cleared
my ſelf from partaking with other mens ſynnes; and ſo ſhould have
done contrary to that holy commandement of the apoſtle to Timothy,
1. Tim. 5. 22. According to this profeſſion of conſcience, if it be vnfeigned
in him, it may be further demanded of him.
               1. VVhy did he not alſo put forth ſome ſhort writing againſt the latine editiō
of Mr. Br. his booke, ſeing he the ſame Iean Deleſcluſe had alſo a hand in the
printing of it heretofore? That book in latine hath bene out now theſe divers yeares;
&amp; never till this time hath he cleared himſelf by any writing againſt it, ſo
long therfore he may ſeeme to have partaken with an other mans ſinne.
               
                  
2. VVhereas Mr. Th. hath hath had a hand in the printing of Mr. Robinſons
booke againſt Mr. Bernard, &amp; there being in it divers errours &amp; aberratiōs from
the truth of the living God, &amp; this not onely in the iudgement of Mr. Iohnſon
who hath openly proteſted againſt the manifold errours therein, but alſo in the
iudgement of Mr. Ainſworth himſelf &amp; his company, how comes it now to paſſe
that Mr. Th. hath not the like care &amp; conſcience to put forah ſome ſhort writing againſt
that booke as wel as Deleſcluſe againſt Mr. Br. his booke? why doth not
I. Deleſcluſe call vpon his fellow in like manner? why doth he ſuffer Mr. Th. to
partake with Mr. Robinſons errours by printing his booke?
               3. VVhereas this Iean Deleſcluſe was heretofore a cardmaker, ſeing he hath
had a hand in making thoſe cardes that are the bookes of gameſters &amp; idle perſons
ſeing many perſons might be offended &amp; ſcandalized by the vſe of thoſe play-bookes,
why hath he not had the conſcience to put forth ſome ſhort writing againſt
thoſe bookes of vanity? why is he not afraid of partaking with the ſinnes of thoſe
gameſters whoſe handes have handled the cardes that were the worke of his hā
                  des?
VVhy did he never yet cleare himſelf of this evill? A good conſcience is
withoutPſ. 119.

                     1. partiality &amp; ſeekes to prevent one offence as wel as an other. VVhat
can he anſwer to theſe thinges? when he hath anſwered theſe thinges, we have
ſundry more ſuch like to demand of him.
            
            
               11.
               BEſides his partiality above noted, marke his folly alſo in this dealing, for if it
were no ſin to have a hand in the printing of Mr. Brightmans booke, thē what
neede he to ſeek the clearing of himſelf by writing againſt the booke: if it were a
ſin to have a hand in the printing thereof, thē how fooliſh is he to think he could
by an after teſtification cleare himſelf from that ſinne which he did firſt willingly
commit? If this were a watrrantable courſe why might he not ſtill follow his old
trade of cardmaking &amp; then afterwardes cleare himſelf by witneſſing &amp; writing
againſt them? why might he not alſo make idoles or images &amp; afterwardes cleare
himſelf frō partaking with the ſinne of Idolatours by teſtifying againſt them? Behold
here the extreme abſurdity of the Browniſtes who condemne our communiō
where we duely teſtify againſt the evilles cōmitted by others whiles they think
to iuſtify themſelves by teſtifying againſt thoſe evilles in the committing whereof
they them ſelves have a hand.
               2. In a due teſtification againſt evill, the teſtimony ought to be as large as the
evill, the plaiſter ought to be as large as the ſoare; but Deleſcluſe is vncertayne
whether his writing (which he countes a plaiſter for the errours and ſores in Mr.
Br. his booke) ſhall ever ſpread ſo far as Mr. Br. his booke, &amp; therfore it muſt
needes be folly and ſin in him that ſhall voluntarily and wilfully publiſh ſuch thinges
which he accountes as ſtumbling blockes layd before the blinde, while he is
ignorant whether his labour ſhall ever come ſo far as to help the removall thereof
in many places.
            
            
               
               12.
               IN the ſubſcription of his Epiſtle he vnder writes thus Thine as thou
art the Lordes Iean Deleſcluſe, that is to ſay, Thine as
thou art a Brewniſt and a ſeparatiſt, for al the promiſes of God
and of ſalvation, they do oft appropriate vnto thoſe that ſeparate: Thoſe onely
they declare to be the lords as touching their viſible eſtate: Therfore howſoever
he wold ſeeme to profeſſe friendſhip, it is but hypocriſy: beware of ſuch
f
                     •
                  endes.
            
            
               13.
               LEt vs now come from his Epiſtle to the book it ſelf, where in he takes vpon
him to ſhew how corruptly Mr. Brightman hath taught that the church of
England is not to be ſeparated from not withſtanding all the ſinnes and abhominations
that are in the ſame: This poynt he ſets downe both in the title of his
booke and in his Epiſtle againe, as the butte or white at which he meanes to
ſhoote, againſt this make he bendes his bow and prepares his arrowes vpon
the ſtinge: And for the proofe of this poynt he ſets downe ten ſpeciall ſpeeches
which Mr. Brightman hath vttred touching the corruptions of the church of
England.
               
                  The firſt ſpeech he
                  Advertiſemēt pag. 5 
                  alledgeth are theſe wordes of Mr. Brightman, I could
not but mourne from the bottome of my heart, when I beheld in her
Chriſte loathing vs, and very greatly provoked againſt vs.
               
                  Here vpon Iean Deſleſcluſe inferreth thus:
                  Pag. 8. 9. I deſire the reader to obſerve
the word which he vſeth of Chriſte lothing them, which word of
loathing ſeemeth to be taken from the 95. Pſal. verſ. 10. Where the
Prophet ſpeaking in the perſon of the Lord him ſelf, ſayth that fourty
yeares long he had loathed that generation: ſaying that they are a people

                     •
                  rring in their heart and not knowing his wayes, wherfore he
ſware in his wrath that they ſhould not enter into his reſt. So that
by Mr. Brightmans owne grant, this church of England is in no better
eſtate then were theſe rebelles in the wildernes, all which were conſumed
and entred not into his reſt as he had ſworne.
               Firſt,Anſw. 1. this inference of Deleſcluſe is vtterly falſe, for though Mr. B. ſhould
grant the ſame phraſe to be vſed both of England &amp; Iſrael, yet doth it not follow
by this grant, that England is in no better eſtate then thoſe rebelles in the wildernes;
for the holy ghoſt often vſeth ore &amp; the ſame generall worde or phraſe
touching divers ſinners which yet not with ſtanding may not therfore be all alike
ſo condemned, but that ſome of them may be in better eſtate then others:
for example, it is ſayd that the Lord was angry with Iſrael in the dayes of
Iehoahaz, 2. kin, 13. 3. It is alſo ſayd in the like phraſe of ſpeech that the
                  
                  wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael in the dayes of David, 2. Sam.
24. 1. Doth it now follow that Iſrael in the dayes of David was in no better eſtate
then in the dayes of Iehoahaz? The contrary is moſt evident &amp; plaine, Iſrael
being at one time a true church &amp; at th' other a falſe church by theR. Clift. anſw. to Mr. Sm. 154. 155. H. Ainſ. counterp. pag. 7. 8. confeſſion
of the Browniſtes themſelves:
               It is ſayd in one generall phraſe, I hate all falſe wayes, Pſ. 119. 128.
Now it is one falſe way to be hated or loathed that the high places were reteyned
in the dayes of Iehoaſh &amp; others 2. kin. 12. 3. &amp; 14. 4. It was an other falſe
way that the goldē calves &amp; Baal were worſhipped by the kinges of Iſrael: doth
it now follow that theſe people were one of them in no better eſtate then the other,
becauſe the phraſe of hating or loathing might be vſed againſt both of
them? Nothing leſſe.
               To come neerer vnto them; Mr. Robinſon accounting it a falſe way &amp; a violation
of Gods ordinance in Mr. Ainſworthes company that they have no
ſeparation of their aimes among them, it followes herevpon that in his account
alſo the word of loathing or hating may be vſed againſt them, ſeing every
falſe way reteyned is to be loathed; And further Mr. Robinſon holdes it a falſe
way &amp; order of government that is practiſed in Mr. Iohnſons church,
which is therfore alſo to be loathed by them: Doth it now follow from hence
that by this graunt Mr. Ainſworthes company is in no better eſtate then Mr.
Iohnſons, becauſe of the ſame word of loathing attributed vnto both of
them? Nothing leſſe. The matter being thus made plaine vnto them, the ſimpleſt
among them may ſee, what a corrupt &amp; blinde maner of reaſoning is here
vſed by their elder Deleſcluſe.
               
               Secondly,2. ſuppoſe it were granted that the church of Tſrael were in no better
eſtate then Iſrael in the wildernes, yet what is this to the ſcope and purpoſe of
his booke? Doth this prove that the church of England is therfore to be ſeparated
from? Nay, the contrary appeareth hence, ſeing it is vndeniably true that
even Iſrael in the wildernes notwithſtanding all their abhominations which the
Lord loathed were yet a true church and communion with them was lawfull, as
appeares in the example of Moſes, Ioſhua, Aaron and other faithfull ſervants of
God remayning among them; And therfore ſo might it be with England alſo
though being in no better eſtate. And thus the ſame arrow that he ſhootes at
vs returnes vpon himſelf and pearceth the ſide of his owne ſeparation.
            
            
               14.
               IN the next place he procedes &amp; labours to perſwade his reader, that the
Lord hath more iuſt cauſe to wath the church of England, then that
of the Iſraelites in the wildernes: VVel, ſuppoſe now, that this alſo were
granted vnto him, would this prove that we ſhould then ſeparate from England?
In no ſort; for the Lord had more cauſe to loath the church of Iſrael in

the dayes of Chriſte, then in the wildernes, And yet even then alſo there was a
lawfull communion with that church when the meaſure of their iniquity was
greater, and when there was a greater then Moſes to convince them of that wickednes:
And thus we ſee how that ſtill he comes ſhort of the mark he ſhootes
at, ſeing greater abhominations then thoſe of Iſrael in the deſert are yet no ſufficient
ground of ſeparation.
            
            
               15.
               
                  FOr the further declaration of this matter,
                  
                     
                        •
                     dvertiſ. 
                        •
                     ig. 9. 
                  let vs a litle examine his particular
inſtances here alledged by him, firſt (ſayth he) that church had a true
miniſtery, and true offices and officers, and ſo hath not the church of
England by Mr. Brightmans owne graunt.
               Firſt,
                     
                        •
                     nſw. let it be conſidered how vnworthy a thing it is, that this man which is
himſelf an vſurper and a falſe officer ſhould thus take vpon him to diſpute about
the miniſtery and the offices in the churches of God: for firſt, when he was yet
with Mr. Iohnſon, he was then a falſe officer, that whole company being in
ſchiſme &amp; therfore a falſe church yeelding no lawfull officers; 2ly, ſuppoſe Mr.
Iohnſons company had bene a true church, and he a true officer in it yet ſeing
he hath now ſchiſmed from that company, and was alſo depoſed from his
office by Mr. Iohnſon and his aſſiſtants, how can he in this ſchiſme be reputed
a true miniſter? 3ly, when he was yet a member of the french chuch and
did there earneſtly ſeek an office, after tryall of his giftes he was repelled and iudged
inſufficient and vnmeete to be a miniſter: Now then ſhall he that was both
Kept out from entring into an office as vnworthy, and againe thruſt out of an office
as vnworthy after he had entred, and this both by a true reformed church
and by the Browniſtes themſelves, ſhall this vnworthy perſon come now and
in the middes of his vnworthines pronounce ſentence touching the truth or falſhood
of offices &amp; miniſteries in the church?
               Secondly,2. let it be conſidred, how he abuſeth &amp; wrongeth Mr. Brightman in
ſaying that the church of England hath not a true miniſtery, offices &amp; officers &amp;
that by Mr. Brightmans owne graunt: for though Mr. Br. do iuſtly complaine
that the church of England wanteth ſome offices which it ſhould have, &amp; againe
that it hath ſome officers which it ſhould not have, yet doth he not affirme
a true miniſtery to be altogather wanting, he doth not deny but that there
are ſome true offices &amp; officers therein.
               Thirdly,3. though there be that defect in the miniſtery of the church of Engl. which
Mr. Brighman noteth, how doth Deleſcluſe prove from thence, that ſeparation
muſt reedes follow? for this he bringes not ſo much as any ſhew of proofe
from the ſcriptures to iuſtify ſuch a conſequence
            
            
               
               16.
               THat ſecond particular exception which he bringeth touching perſecution by
the officers in the church of England is againe repeated by him in his tenth
ſpeech of Mr. Brightmans which he alledgeth &amp; is there anſwered, for which ſee
the 38. ſection following.
            
            
               17.
               
                  THe third particular differēce which he affirmeth to have bene betwixt Iſrael &amp;
Eng. is, that their governmēt in Iſrael was not a mixt governemēt partiy
of the Egiptians, partly of the Moabites and Edomites or Cananeans,
but ſimple and and pure according to the true patterne ſhewed
to Moſes in the mount; but that of England is not ſo, for Mr. Brightman
affirmeth it to be partly Romiſh and partly reformed etc.
               Firſt,Anſw. 1. if it be true that Mr. Robinſon writeth, viz. that the church officers,
the prieſts &amp; levites in the Iewiſh church to whō the charge of the whole
congregation for the ſervice of the tabernackle did appertayne, had no authority
by the order of their office to inflict any cenſure ſpiritually vpon the people,
but onely to interpret the law ett. Anſw. to Mr. Bern. pag. 198. then is
all this idle which Deleſcluſe doth here ſpeak of their government: If the eccleſiaſticall
officers did exerciſe no government at all, then is it in vayne to diſpute
of the purity of a thing that was nothing.
               Secondly,2. if that excommunication or diſſynagogueing noted Ioh. 9. 22.
was but a Iewiſh deviſe and without warrant of the ſcriptures, as bothAnſw. to to Mr. Ber. pag. 187. Parallel. pag. 61. 
                  Mr.
Robinſon doth write, and Mr. Smith alſo hath written before him, then was
the governmēt of the Iewes a deviſed governemēt, an Impure ād mixt governemēt,
partly divine and partly humane; and yet not with ſtanding this mixt government
we ſee there was then a lawfull communion; that mixture of deviſed
governemēt was no ground of ſeparation, as this Deleſcluſe would vainely collect
againſt Mr. Britghman and againſt the church of England.
               Thirdly,3. if a mixt governement be a ground of ſeparation, then is Mr. Ainſworthes
company to be reiected ſeing it doth exerciſe a popular confuſed and
mixt government, conſiſting partly in the power of the officers, but chiefely
in the power of the people: And thus the collection of Deleſcluſe ſerves to overthrow
his owne governement: And the ſhame of this their mixed governemēt
which Mr. Iohnſon hath affirmed to be worſe then the goverement of
the church of England, doth in this reſpect lye the more heavily on them in
that Mr. Iohnſon hath alſo in a printed booke condemned the ſame, which
booke the Ainſwort hians have not yet anſwerd.
            
            
               
               18.
               THe fourth particular inſtance which he bringeth to prove the difference betwixt
Iſrael &amp; England is this: None of that church (ſayth he) were
admitted vnto any office but onely ſuch as were lawfully called therevnto
as Aaron was,
                  Anſw. 
                  but ſo it is not in England etc.
               
               Firſt, it is onely the bare affirmati of Deleſcluſe that ſayth of the church of Iſrael
that none were there admitted vnto any office but onely ſuch as were lawfully called
as Aaronwas; where is his proofe from the ſcriptures where of he boaſted
in his Epiſtle.
               Secondly,2. it is a falſe affirmation of Deleſcluſe, for when Annas &amp; Caiaphas
did enterchangeably execute the high prieſtes office, as appeareth Luk. 3. 2.
Ioh. 11. 51. it was not poſſible that both of them could be lawfully admitted
vnto the execution of that office which was peculiar vnto one man during his
life.
               Thirdly, ſeing Mr. Iohnſon hath offred to prove vnto Mr. Ainſworth &amp;
his company that in their popular governement they are like▪
                  3. vnto Korah &amp; his
company ambitiouſly vſurping an office wherevnto they are not lawfully called &amp;
that vpon the Korites ground, Numb. 16. 3. it had bene much fitter that Mr.
Ainſworth or Deleſcluſe ſhould have defended &amp; cleared themſelves of the evill
which they lay vpon others by writing againſt Mr. iohnſon about theſe thinges

manner,Advertiſ.

                     ag. 9. Therefore it doth neceſſarily follow that the eſtate of the church of
England is worſe then was the eſtate of thoſe rebelles in the wildernes, &amp; that
there is nothing to be expected from Chriſte, by any member thereof,
but a powring out of his eternal wrath vpon them.
               
               In this peremptory ſentence which he denounceth againſt the church of England
he takes on him as if he would ſeeme to be one of thoſe ſevē angelles which
having their breaſtes g
                     ••

wrath in their handes to powre 
                     •
                  ut 
                     •
                  is vengeance on the wicked,Anſw. but the truth
is he is rather in this his doome like one of the angelles of Sathan that accuſe the
brethren condemning thoſe whom God hath iuſti
                     •
                  yed: By this ſentence he doth

at once extinguiſh &amp; quench the whole light &amp; comfort of the goſpell, which
teacheth that there is no condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſte &amp; beleeve in
his name, Rom 3. 28. and 8. 1. For ſuch beleeves there are many in the
church of England holding that doctrine of faith &amp; iuſtification whereby the faithfull
&amp; the ſaintes in al the reformed churches do hope to ente
                     •
                   into life everlaſting,

into glory: Now to denounce the aeternall wrath of Chriſte to thoſe that
have true faith, what is it els but to aboliſh the goſpell, to deſtroy faith &amp; to
make it of no effect? If an angell frō heaven ſhould come &amp; preach vnto vs as
Deleſcluſe here hath done, yet ought we not to receive him, Gal. 1. 8.
               But here the Browniſtes obiect that true fayth ſhewes it ſelf by workes,Ob. which
(they ſay) are apparantly evill in the church of England.

cōtinuall ſtudy &amp; delight in the word of God their cōtinuall invocatiō of the name
of God every day, their delight in the Sabath, their love of the godly for the
truth ſake, their vnfeigned ſorow for their ſinnes, their patiēce for the teſtimony of
Chriſte, &amp; ſundry other ſuch like fruites which are the vndoubted &amp; certaine to
kens of true ſaith, Pſ. 89. 15. Pſ. 1. 2. Ioel. 2. 32. Eſa. 56. 4. 5. 6. Mat.
10. 41. 42. Mat. 5. 4. 10. 11.
               Secondly,2. ſuppoſe other of their workes be evill▪ ſuppoſe alſo that their refuſall
of ſeparation were a ſin, yet ſeing it cannot be thought other then a ſinne of
ignorance &amp; that God had not opened their eyes in this matter, what an abſurd
&amp; wicked thing is it in this eſtate to pronounce of them all without exception,
that there is nothing to be expected from Chriſte by any member thereof,
but a powring out of his aeternall wrath vpon them, for who can vnderſtand
his faults and who is it but that he ſinnes of ignorance, and why not in
the myſterie of the ſeparation as well as in others, eſpecially it being ſuch a poynt
as the members of all other true churches can not comprehend the ſame? Not
with ſtanding ſuch errours the members of the church of England may be vpright
with the Lord and accepted of him and made partakers of eternall ſalvation,
Pſ. 19. 13. 1. Cor. 13. 9. with 1. Cor. 1. 30. Pſ. 32. 1. 2.
               But to ſalve or mitigate this their vnchriſtian and hard ſentence, they tell vs
that in ſuch maner of ſentences and iudgements they ſpeak reſpectively,Except. Anſ. to Mr. Iac. pag. 7. 8. viz. that
the faithfull in England cannot be accounted true Chriſtians in reſpect of their
miniſtery, in reſpect of their conſtitution, in reſpect of their eſtate, being
ſo conſidered etc.
               
               In this exception the Browniſtes do ſhew their vanity in ſeeking out frivolous
pretences to colour their raſh iudgements;Anſw. 1. for firſt, when as true and 
                     •
                  ound iudgemēt
is to be given touching the eſtate of a Chriſtian and an heire of ſalvation,
he is then to be conſidred not by the halfes or by ſome ſuch and ſuch reſpects
onely, but wholly and entirely with all his reſpectes togather. And ſo a faithfull
man conſidered not apart from his errours and ignorances but conſidered
togather with them and with his faith is yet to be iudged and that abſolutely a

true Chriſtian &amp; an heire of ſalvation, ſuppoſe there beſome manifeſt errours
and offences vpon him yet his faith ſhewing it ſelf in other manifeſt fruites thereof
is a viſible cover for all his offences, ſeing the Lord hath manifeſted in his
word that faith alone doth iuſtify and lay hold on everlaſting righteouſnes, Gal.
2. 16. and 3. 7. Eph. 2. 8. and therfore ſuch a one in his outward eſtate and
profeſſion is ſtill a viſible Chriſtian notwithſtanding any other viſible iniquities
wherein he ignorantly continueth.
               Secondly,2. when Chriſte at his laſt comming ſhall pronounce iudgement, he
will not conſider men apart frō their conſtitution, miniſtery, governement etc. he
will not ſay in ſuch reſpect I condemne thee and in ſuch reſpect I do iuſtify thee
and ſave thee, but he doth abſolutely pronounce ſentence either of ſalvation or
condemnation, And this iudgement of the Lord is generally manifeſted in his
word &amp; according to his word will he iudge at the laſt day, Ioh. 12. 48. Mark.
16. 16. and therfore according to this word of the Lord the eſtate of of mē is abſolutely
to be declared without ſuch reſpective cōſiderations and exceptions. If
the queſtiō had bene onely about the reproofe of ſome particular ſin in any perſō,
or about the comparing of one perſon with an other thē might they have iudged
herein reſpectively; for the mā that is a true Chriſtiā may in ſome reſpect be worthily
reprehended &amp; may in ſome reſpect be vnlike vnto others; but when the queſtion
is about the iudgement of a true Chriſtian &amp; about his obteyning of ſalvation,
then are ſuch partiall &amp; reſpective conſiderations idle &amp; of no vſe: A man is
in ſuch caſe either abſolutely to be condemned or abſolutely to be iuſtifyed &amp;
acquit.
               Thirdly,3. according to that reſpective iudgement, every church yea every perſon
in the world ſhould be condemned &amp; ſtand vnder the wrath of God, becauſe
every church &amp; every perſon doth erre &amp; commit ſin &amp; in that reſpect being
conſidered apart from Chriſte is accurſed, And according to this reſpective iudment
of the Browniſtes, Deleſculſe in reſpect of thoſe eleven corruptions which
they lay vpon the reformed churches (ſuppoſing they were iuſtly imputed vnto
them) might in like manner accordingly have pronounced of them all, that
there is nothing to be expected from Chriſte, by any member thereof,
but a powring out of his eternall wrath vpon them, ſeing no ſin is in it
ſelf veniall, al ſinnes with out f
                     ••
                  th in him do bring eternall wrath, as well one as
an other. And in like maner Mr. Iohnſon holding the ſame corruptions in the
reformed dutch &amp; french churches,Anſw. to Mr. Iac. pag. 7. 8. might in this reſpect ſay of thē all as he * ſayth
of England, that they ſtand all ſubiect to wrath, God imputing this their
ſinne vnto them. For any one of the leaſt ſinnes do make men ſubiect to wrath
God imputing the ſame vnto them.
               Laſtly,4. 
                  Mr. Iohnſon (as he telleth vs himſelf) whenſoever he vttred his
hard ſentence againſt the church of England did alwayes ſpeak with caution and
added ſome of theſe clauſes, being ſo conſidred, in that eſtate, in that 
                        〈◊〉
                     .
But here Deleſcluſe without any caution or clauſe of conſideration

ſhuts them vp all vnder eternall wrath, makes his arrowes drun
                     •
                  ken with the
blood of ſoules, &amp; will needes have them all to drinck the cup of indignation
from his hand with no leſſe ſin &amp; drunkennes of errour then when he had drunken
that cup of magis whereof Iacob Iohnſon is ſayd to have admoniſhed him,
he doth in this place as vainely condemne the faithfull for no ſheepe of Chriſte,
as he did then commend the ſame Iacob Iohnſon to be a fit paſtour for his
ſheepe.
            
            
               20.
               THe ſecond ſpeech of Mr. Brightman alledged to ſhew that he doth corruptly
teach againſt the ſeparation is this,Advertiſ. pag. 5. &amp; 
                        •
                     
                   viz. that the moſt mighty king
Henry had expelled the pope, but reteyned the popiſh ſuperſtition.
               
               Note here the folly of Deleſcluſe,
                  Anſw. that would prove a ſeparation in one time
by the corruptions &amp; ſuperſtitions of an other time: as though he ſhould
ſay: In king Henries time there were many ſuperſtitions, therfore in Queene
Elizabeths time there ought to be a ſeparation notwithſtanding all the reformation
that was procured by her meanes: what ſober man would ſo
argue?
            
            
               21.
               FVrther, whereas Deleſcluſe ſayth that the pope cannot properly be
ſayd to be expelled when his doctrine and ſuperſtition is retepned,
it is a vayne Cavill, for firſt, if he ſtand ſo preciſely vpon propriety
of ſpeech, the pope can not properly be ſayd to be expelled, no not
then where his doctrine and ſuperſtition is expelled; It is a figurative ſpeech
to note the popiſh doctrine and ſuperſtition vnder the name of the pope
himſelf. 2ly, it is yet a true and a fit ſpeech in Mr. Brightman to ſay that
the pope was expelled when the iuriſdiction of the pope and the ſupremacy
formerly annexed vnto his perſon was denyed and reiected, when he
was no longer acknowledged to be the head of that church, when that
which was vniuſtly arrogated vnto the perſon of the pope was tranſlated vnto
the perſon of the king as it was in King Henries dayes: even as the
venetians at this day might very fitly be ſayd to expell the pope, if
they would vtterly deny his ſupremacy both in civill and Eccleſiaſtcall
cauſes, howſoever they might reteyne many popiſh ſuperſtitions.
            
            
               
               2.
               
                  THe third ſpeech of Mr. Bright man which he bringes againſt him to prove a
ſeparation from the church of England is this,

                     5. &amp; 10. that there is ſuch a forme
of church eſtabliſhed as is neither cold nor hote, but ſet in the middes
and made of both, etc.
               Theſe wordes Mr. B. vttred in comparing the church of Laodicea &amp; England
togather,
                     
                        ••
                     ſw. as the type and antitype vnto one an other; That which he ſayth of
England he takes frō Laodicea which is alſo declared to be neither hote nor cold,
Rev. 3. 15. 16. ſo that by this manner of arguing he might as well prove a ſeparation
from the church of Laodicea in reſpect of the lukewarmnes which the
holy ghoſt ſhewes to have bene found therein. But that it is moſt erroneous ſo
to reaſon, Chriſte plainely teacheth vs while he telles vs that this church was ſtill
a golden candleſtick, that the angell thereof was a ſtarre in his right hand, &amp;
that he himſelf would ſtill ſup &amp; communicate with that church; And therfore
ſo alſo may the church of England be reputed not with ſtanding the ſame or the
like luke warmnes.
            
            
               23.
               
                  VVIth this third ſpeech he deſires that this which he hath ſet downe for the
fift charge may be ioyned, where Mr. B. ſayth, that no other cauſe
can be brought of their lukewarmnes, the popiſh governement mingled
with the pure doctrine, then the love of riches and honours.
               And what can he conclude hence?
                     
                        •
                     nſw. VVhat though they were covetous &amp; ambitious
given to the love of riches &amp; honors &amp; ſo became lukewarme? ſhall this
be a iuſt cauſe of ſeparation from the church? No; for the ſcribes &amp; Phariſees
were alſo covetous &amp; ambitious, Mat. 23. 5. etc. Luk. 16. 14. &amp; yet cō
                  munion
with them was lawfull.
            
            
               24.
               HE deſires further that this complaint of lukewarmnes may be compared with
that prayſe of reformation which Mr. Br. gives vnto the church of England
in the title of his epiſtle dedicatory: VVel, being compared with the ſame it
may well ſtand togather with it, for reformed churches may yet have lukewarme
miniſters &amp; many other greevous corruptions to be complayned of: yea
doth not Deleſcluſe condemne himſelf in this matter? for doth not he alſo in
the title of his booke &amp; in his epiſtle written to the Engliſh readers entitle thē
with the name of godly reader and Chriſtian reader? And is there any god

                     •
                   without reformation? Is there any Chriſtian that is not reformed? VVhy

then may not Mr. B. call thoſe holy &amp; reformed whom Deleſcluſe doth call
godly and Chriſtian?
               
            
            
               25.
               HE demandes ſtill in the ſame place &amp; ſayth; Is it poſſible that holynes
and vnholynes can raigne togather? VVe anſwer; Yea, in one &amp; the ſame
church in the divers members thereof, as in the church of the iewes, holynes
raygned in Chriſte &amp; his diſciples, vnholynes raigned in the ſcribes and Phariſees
&amp;c.
            
            
               26.
               
                  HE yet demandes againe &amp; ſaith, Is there any communion betweene
Chriſte and Anti-chriſte? betweene light and darknes? betweene
Idolles and the true God? Can any kingdome, any church, any family,
any man ſubmit vnto the governement of Anti-chriſte and not
be defiled.
               VVe anſwer, though Chriſte &amp; Anti-chriſte be enimies, yet the ſervants of
Chriſte may lawfully communicate in that church where many abhominations
of Anti-chriſte are to be ſeene, ſor as francis wingrave a Browniſt doth truely
acknowledge,Anſw. to Mr. Stone, pag. 2. 
                  Every abhomination of Anti-thriſte doth not make a
church to become Anti-chriſtian for the beſt churches are ſubiect to errour
and ſome abhominations of Anti-chriſte, were crept into Chriſtian
churches whiles the Apoſtles lived: And yet communion was lawfull
therein. Even ſo the children of light &amp; the children of darknes did communicate
togather in Chriſtes time: As for Idolles if they be no other then ſet formes
of read prayer and ſuch like, which the Browniſtes call idolles, communion
with them is lawfull enough: And for governement though Caiaphas was
an Anti-chriſtian vſurper, yet did many perſons lawfully ſubmit vnto his power:
Thus hath God himſelf and his Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught vs both
by their word and example and therfore let Deleſcluſe heare the Prophet Eſay
which he alledgeth, turning vnto him and ſaying vnto the maynteyners of ſchiſme,
wo vnto them that call that communion evill which the Lord hath ſhewed
to be good and lawfull.

And thus the double falſhood of Deleſcluſe appeareth not onely in adding but
alſo in omitting that which was moſt ſignificant and ſpecially to be conſidred.
               Thirdly,3. ſuppoſe Mr B. had ſpoken generally of the whole miniſtery in Englād,
yet is the obſervation of Deleſcluſe moſt falſe &amp; vaine. It would not follow

covetouſnes, refuſing holy reformation, Mr B. ſpeakes not ſimply &amp; abſolutely

                  bringeth from Mr. B. againſt the church of
England is this that naughtines raigneth in it, the hand of God is
heavy vpon it; and againe, that in her the lawes of Chriſte are not kept.
Hence he inferreth; But what is there then to be done, even this that
every ſoule who hath any care of ſalvation and of eſcaping the eternall
flames of everlaſting damnation be carefull to come out with ſpeed
from Babylon etc.
               This concluſion of ſeparation which Deleſcluſe here gathereth &amp; denounceth
vnder paine of eternall flames of everlaſting damnation is vayne,Anſw. 1. for firſt all that
Mr. Br. here ſayth of England might alſo moſt truely be affirmed of that church
of the jewes where in Chriſte did communicate for there, 1. naughtines raigned
&amp; prevayled in the Herods, in the prieſtes, elders, ſcribes, Phariſees &amp; Sadducees
&amp;c. Mat. 2. 16. and 12. 24. and 14. 9. and 16. 12. 21. 2ly, the hand
of God was heavy vpō them in their manifold oppreſſions &amp; miſeries which they
endured vnder the government of the Romanes &amp; their ſubſtitutes, Mat. 2.
16. and 3. 10. and 17. 24. etc. Luk. 13. 1. and 2. 1. Ioh. 11. 48. 3ly, the
lawes of Chriſt were not kept there Mat. 15. 3. Ioh. 15. 20. 22. And now by
the ſētēce of Deleſcluſe, eternall flames of evelaſting damnatiō
                   muſt be the
portion of Chriſte &amp; his Diſciples that cōmunicated with that church, who will
not deteſt ſuch vile cōcluſions, which are like vnto arrowes ſhot even againſt the

breaſte of Chriſte Ieſus himſelf? As he that makes himſelf mad caſteth firebrandes,
arrowes and mortall thinges prov. 26. 18. ſo Deleſcluſe in
this place caſting abroad his firebrandes of eternall damnation, ſhooting his
arrowes againſt heaven, &amp; throwing mortall thinges even vpon the Lord of life
what doth he els herein but declare himſelf to be a mad man? &amp; why might not
this his booke which he entitles an Ad-vertiſement be much more fitly entitled
a Mad-vertiſement.
               
               Secondly, all that Mr. Br. affirmeth in this place touching England hath bene affirmed
by the Browniſtes themſelves touching one an other:2. ſo that Deleſcluſe
may here ſee how he hath kindled a fire to burne vp himſelf &amp; his owne company:
For 1. that naughtines raigneth among the Ainſworthians it may appeare
by the teſtimony of Mr. Iohnſon who hath oft in publique witneſſed of them
as of droſſe or chaffe which the Lord with his fanne would purge out from them,
vnder that name of chaffe the the holy ghoſt doth declare vuto vs the wicked among
whom nanghtines raigneth Pſ. 1. 4. Mat. 3. 12. As for the Franciſcanes
(beſides many other greevous thinges) ſome of Mr. Ainſworthes company
do teſtify of them, that probable murder and approved whoredomes are tolerated
or maynteyned among them; Deleſcluſe himſelf is noted for one of the witneſſes.

are not kept among thē of Mr. Ainſworthes company Mr. Iohnſon teſtifyeth
touching their governement, &amp; Mr. Robinſon touching the adminiſtration of
their deacons in that they have no ſeparation of their almes: Thus Deleſcluſe

               FVrther Deleſcluſe to prove a ſeparation from that church where naughtines
raigneth doth alledge that ſaying of the Apoſtle, he which coupleth himſelf

repeated * againe by hiu as a ſpeciall ground of their ſeparation) is nothing to

harlot by fornication or whoredome, that perſon defileth himſelf by his wicked
act; for otherwiſe it was lawfull for a man to couple himſelf with an harlot by
marying with her, as we ſee in Salmon and Rahab, Mat. 1. 5. with Ioſh.
6. 25. The prieſtes indeed were forbidden, even by mariage to couple them
ſelves with an harlot, Lev. 21. 7. 14. that others were ſo forbidden we reade
not. But as for ioyning in communion with a church where naughtines raigned,
it was not forbidden, no not to the prieſtes themſelves, from Aaron to Zacharie
we never read or any godly prieſtes, that did ever ſeparate vpon ſuch a ground
a Deleſcluſe doth here pretend.

This note is idle, neither hath Mr B. alledged outward proſperity as a marke of

ſuch a matter, for to what end ſhould he els oppoſe the fame? In this note

for as it is ſignifyed vnto vs by ſundry that have more learning then our ſelves
or this Deleſcluſe, theſe latter wordes of Mr. B. prae quibus erubeſcant
reformatae Eccleſiae are not to be tranſlated as here they are ſet downe by Deleſcluſe

in compariſon whereof the reformed churches may be aſhamed, And as theſe
two ſpeeches are quite contrary, if we ſhould firſt ſay thus Deleſcluſe hath
written ſuch thinges for which Mr. Ainſworth may be aſhamed and

then againe on th

                   other ſide to ſay, Deleſcluſe hath written ſuch thinges in
compariſon whereof Mr. Ainſworth might be aſhamed, for the firſt of
cheefe ſpeeches doth declare how ill he hath done to make his fellowes aſhamed,
the ſecond ſheweth how well he hath done to ſhame his fellowes that they can
not imitate him, even ſuch difference is there betwixt the ſpeech of Mr. B. truely
tranſlated, and betwixt the ignorant tranſlation thereof by Deleſcluſe in this place.
And herewithall is to be noted that as there is an jronie or figurative ſpeech

                  ſt part of Mr. B. his teſtimony, where he ſpeaketh of excellent ordinances,

thereof, how the reformed churches may bluſh thereat, as though they had not
the like ordinances, but in the tranſlation of Deleſcluſe this jroine is not to be
found. He telles vs in his Epiſtle how he hath had a hand both in the tranſlating
and printing of Mr. B. his booke, that ſo he might be found guilty
of all manner of falſification, 1. falſe printing and gloſing as is noted before.

will this prove that Mr. Brightman taught corruptly when he ſayd that we ought
not to ſeparate frō the church of England? Nothing leſſe, In the time of Chriſte
the jewes had many wicked traditious, ordinances &amp; cuſtomes for which the
godly might be aſhamed, and yet they might not then ſeparate: The churches of
Epheſus &amp; Smyrna might well be aſhamed of the manifold corruptions in other
of their neighbour churches in Aſia &amp; yet without ſeparation. VVe our ſelves
have often ſeene ſuch thinges in the Browniſtes for which all that profeſſe the name
of Chriſte might well be aſhamed, we have ſeene their contentions, diſorders

                  ſions ſo great, that even the jewes, the profeſſed enimies of Chriſte being
neighbours vnto the Browniſtes and dwelling hard by them &amp; perceyving
their bitter diſſenſions &amp; diviſions have laughed them to ſcorne &amp; poynted at
them with the finger: Thus have they bene a ſcandall and an offence both to th

               DEleſcluſe in his amplification of this fore ſayd ſpeech makes a large complaint
againſt the reformed churches,

                     dvertiſ.

                     g. 12. ſhewing that they may be aſhamed becauſe
they have not dealt ſo ſincerely and plainely with the church of England for
reproofe of corruptions in the ſame, &amp;c▪
               
               
                  
In this complaint obſerve firſt,Anſw. 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   how abſurdly Deleſcluſe dealeth that being
to reprove the dutch &amp; french churches writes againſt them in Engliſh which
they can not vnderſtand; why did he not alſo write againſt the church of England
in french or dutch?
               Secondly, note here how he breakes his promiſe: he promiſed immediately before
to be breefe &amp; to bring that which remayned into a ſhort ſumme;
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   &amp; yet he
is now more large and ample in laying out this teſtimony of Mr. B. then in any
of the former. In this dealing it ſeemes he ſcarſe knew or cared what he ſayd
or did.
               Thirdly, let the reader know that the reformed churches have plenteonſly teſtifyed
againſt the corruptions of the church of England contrary to that which
Deleſcluſe doth here pretend:3. for a taſt hereof to omit other thinges we deſire
the reader but to looke vpon theſe three bookes, viz. Abridgement of the
booke delivered to his maieſty by miniſters of lincol. etc. The anſwer to
D. Downehams ſermon; the ſcholaſticall diſcourſe againſt the ſigne
of the croſſe, wherein may be ſeene the pregnant and abundant teſtimonies of
learned men in the reformed churches both againſt the hierarchy or prelacy and
alſo againſt the ſuperſtitious ceremonies remayning in the church of England, as
namely Calvine, Beza, Muſculus, Bucer, Martyr, Bullinger, Aretius, Zanchius,
Mornaeus, Iunius, Sadeel, Piſcator, Polanus, Vrſinus, Virel, Viret, Grinaeus, Bucanus,
Goulartius, Danaeus, Olevian, Zepperus, Lubbertus, Baſtingius, Snecanus,
Keckerman, with a number more, who as they have teſtifyed againſt the
corruptions maynteyned by the prelates on the one ſide, ſo have they teſtifyed
againſt the ſeparation &amp; ſchiſme maynteyned by the Browniſtes and Anabaptiſtes
on th' other ſide: In ſo much that both they which plead for the prelacy
and they which plead for ſeparation do in like manner eſteeme and hold the
miniſters of the reformed churches as their partyes and adverſaries, ſee D. Down
hams defence, lib. 1. pag. 197. and H. Ainſw. counterpoy. pag. 15.
            
            
               35.
               
                  A Ninth ſpeech of Mr. Brightman alledged by Deleſcluſe is touching the names
of the officers of that church,Advertiſ. p. 7. &amp; 12▪ 13. that they were vnknowne vnto
the church of Chriſte, except the biſhops etc. where vpon Deleſcluſe infereth
in theſe wordes: And what is this? ſhall then any ſoule in whom
there is but a very ſmall ſparkle of the feare of God, be ſo bold as to dare
ſubmit vnder the government and guidance of ſuch vnlawfull miniſters
and miniſtery?
               Yea verily,Anſw. 1. we ſee thoſe ſoules that had very many and great ſparkles of the feare
of God have ſubmitted themſelves vnder the government and guidance of
vnlawfull miniſters, neither hath Deleſcluſe here brought any ſound reaſon to
ſhew the contrary: VVe ſee that in Chriſtes time there were divers officers whoſe
names had not bene heard of in the primitive church of the 
                     •
                  ewes, no
                     •
                   ever

were inſtituted by any example of former times in that church, as namely the
names of of lawyers, ſcribes of the people and according to the writing of
of the Browniſtes, the names of Archiſynagogues, or rulers of the Synagogues.
               
               Secondly,2. it is evident, the godly may lawfully ſubmit themſelves vnto the
government &amp; guidance of ſuch private brethren, who in reſpect of their ſects,
factions &amp; ſuperſtitious obſervations have had 
                     •
                  uch names as were formerly vnknowne
vnto the church of God, who alſo in reſpect of their wickedn
                     •
                  s deſerved
to have their names 
                     •
                  lotted o
                     •
                  t of the regiſter of the ſaintes, This we ſee in the
communion of the godly with the ſcribes &amp; Phariſees: And therfore if it be lawful
for Chriſtians to ſubmit themſelves vnto the counſayles, admonitions &amp; rebukes
of thoſe which for their ſin ought to be caſt out of the church of God &amp;
yet are vniuſtly reteyned: If a man may ſtand vnder the guidance and authority
of ſuch admonishers, ſo long as he teſtifies againſt their ſinnes, then may he alſo
ſtand vnder the government &amp; guidance of vnlawfull officers: If a man may
ſubmit himſelf vnto one who is vnlawfully a member of the church, why not alſo
vnto him who is vnlawfully a miniſter of the church? If a man may ſubmit himſelf
in private vnto the guidance of an vnlawfull brother, then why not alſo vnto
the publique guidance of an vnlawfull officer? There is more proportion betwixt
a member &amp; a miniſter then betwixt a member &amp; an excommunicate or an heathen,
or one that ought to be excommunicate: For example, Daniel ſtudly &amp;
Iean Deleſculſe being both of them depoſed from their offices for ſin imputed
vnto them by the Franciſcane Browniſtes, ſuppoſe they were ſtill obſtinate
in the ſinnes imputed vnto them deſerving excommunication, &amp; yet tolerated vnlawfully,
in this eſtate being not iudged nor caſt out by their church their admonitions
for ſin either in the firſt or ſecond place were not to be reiected: And if
their private admonition might be ſubmitted vnto, why not their publique alſo
if they had not bene depoſed? If in the want of due excommunication the
private admonition of an vnlawfull member is of force &amp; to be ſubmitted vnto,
then in the want of iuſt depoſition the publique admonition or other workes of
governement exerciſed by vnlawfull miniſters is of force &amp; to be ſubmitted vnto:
This reaſon is ſpecially to be conſidred of thoſe Browniſtes that mainteyne the popular
governement &amp; ſubmit vnto the ſame.
            
            
               36.
               
                  BVt Deleſcluſe addes his reaſon why ſuch vnlawfull miniſters are not to be
ſubmitted vnto:
                  Advertiſ. pag. 13. 
                  For ſayth he: Are they not all thieves and robbers
which enter not in by the dore but climbe vp an other way? And will
any man of wiſedome commit vnto the protection and and keeping of
theeves the leaſt part of his worldly goods? No, none wilde ſo vnwiſe
for every one 
                     •
                  ndweth that they will but make a pray of them and ſpoile
and rob them? And ſhall any then be ſo carefull for thinges of ſo

ſmall importance and ſhall he not care vnto whom he doth commit the
guidance of that which is the principall,Anſw. 1. namely of his ſoule?
               Firſt, we do directly affirme that which Deleſcluſe doth ſo flatly deny▪ Many
men of wiſedome may &amp; will &amp; ought to commit vnto the protection &amp; keeping
of theeves not onely the leaſt part but the greateſt part of their worldly
goods: For all tyrants a wicked rulers that oppreſſe &amp; ſpoyle their ſubiectes are
theeves &amp; robbers, Prov. 28. 15. Eſa. 1. 23. Hoſ. 5. 1. Mic. 3. 1. 2. etc.
Yea theſe great thieves are in divers reſpectes more vile then other outpurſes or
then th
                     •
                  ſe that rob by the high way ſide, Yet vnto the protection &amp; keeping of
theſe tyrantes men both of wiſedome &amp; godlines may &amp; ought to commit both
their lives &amp; their goods; Thoſe which teach men not to ſubmit vnto ſuch are
guilty of rebellion &amp; treaſon; Though Saul was a tyrant &amp; an oppreſſour 1.
Sam. 8. 11. etc. Yet was ſubmiſſion vnto him lawfull &amp; neceſſary, men of wiſedome
did lawfully commit themſelves &amp; their goods vnto his protection.
Thus the ground of Deleſcluſe his argument is taken away.
               Secondly,2. men of wiſedome may &amp; ought alſo ſometimes to commit the guidance
of their ſoules vnto thieves; for all falſe ſtewardes &amp; vnfaithfull miniſters
that teach not the flock of God but keep back his counſell are indeed theeves
alſo &amp; ſteale the word of the Lord from their neighbours, Ier. 23. 30. 1.
Cor. 4. 1. 2. And ſuch thieves there were many in Iſrael, ſuch were many of the
ſcribes &amp; lawyers in Chriſtes time, Mat. 23. 13. etc. Luk. 11. 52. And
yet our ſaviour requires his ſervants to ſubmit vnto ſuch, to heare their doctrine,
though with this caution to beware of their leaven, Mat. 16. 12. Men might
lawfully receive their ſound doctrine, while they diſcerned that which was erroneous
&amp; tooke heed of the ſame. The ſcribes in their corrupt and wicked adminiſtration
or execution of their office were notorious theeves; &amp; a theeviſh adminiſtration
is as bad as a thieviſ
                     •
                   entrance, &amp; yet we ſee the miniſtery of ſuch
might be ſubmitted vnto.
               Thirdly,3 if the miniſtery of thieves and robbers may not be ſubmitted vnto,
then may not the miniſtery of ſchiſmatiques be ſubmitted vnto, for ſchiſmatitiques
that ſteale away themſelves and others from the cōmunion of of the faith
full are in this reſpect no better then theeves: And therfore by this his owne argument
the miniſtery of Deleſcluſe is not to be ſubmitted vnto, becauſe as a
ſchiſmatique he hath ſtollen away himſelf both from the reformed french church
of old and againe of late from the Franciſcane Browniſtes, who being formerly in
his account a true church, how could he ſo renounce and diſclayme their communion
without ſchiſme?
            
            
               37.
               
                  YEt further he bringes here a ground of ſcripture oft abuſed by the Browniſtes
to prove their ſeparation in theſe wordes:
                  Advertiſ pag. 13. Let them alone therfore

for as our ſaviour ſayth / they are blinde leaders of the blinde: and both
of them ſhall ſurely fall into the pit.
               The letting alone here ſpokē of by Chriſte is to be vnderſtood in reſpect of the
offence which the Phariſees tooke vniuſtly at the wordes of Chriſte that the Diſciples
ſhould not be troubled therewith,
                     
                        •
                     nſw. 1. as appeareth Mat. 15. 12. 14. Our ſaviour
by his example did there teach vs to teſtify againſt corruptions as he himſelf
there did againſt the traditions of the Phariſees, verſ. 3. 7. etc. But as for ſeparation
from ſuch guides our ſaviour ſayth nothing, yea that he meant no ſuch
thing it appeareth evidently by the communion which he and his Apoſtles did
afterwardes ſtill reteyne in that church not ſeparating from the ſame.
               And though they were in many thinges blinde leaders,2. yet not ſo far as that
ſimply to heare them was vnlawfull, but to follow them blindely with out examining
of that which they ſayd by the word of God, ſuch heedleſſe and vndiſcreete
hearing and following is forbidden, to heare them as the Beraeans heard
Paul was not vnlawfull.
               And if blinde guides are to be taken heed of,3. then we do further appeale vnto
the conſcience of the indifferent reader whether it were a ſafer thing to ſubmit vnto
the teaching of Mr. Brightman or of Deleſcluſe his cenſurer, to heare ſuch as
M. Perkins, Mr. Greeneham, M. Phillips &amp; ſuch like teachers or to commit their
ſoules to the inſtruction of Thomas Cocky, Ihon Hales, Francis Ieſop and ſuch
like blinde guides as do leade both Mr. Ainſworth himſelf and his whole company,
Let thoſe that know theſe two ſorts of guides conſider duely of the
matter.
            
            
               38.
               
                  THe tenth ſpeech of Mr. Brightman he ſetteth downe on this manner,

                     . 7. &amp; 13 finally
the angell of the Church of England is both a pexſecuter of the brethren
and a deceyver of the prince. VVhence he inferreth with an exclamation,
Marvelous, and is he ſtill for all this the angell of the Church
in Mr. Brightmans iudgement? In mine doubtleſſe he is altogather
otherwiſe, even that angell of the bottomleſſe pit, who is a king over
thoſe locuſtes etc.
               The miniſters of the Iewiſh Church in Chriſtes time were both perſecutours
of the brethren and deceyvers of the princes and Governours,
                     
                        ••
                     ſw. 1. and yet were ſtill
the angell of that Church. They perſecuted Chriſte and ſought to murder
him, they ſeduced Pilate and brought him againſt his owne conſcience to condemne
Chriſte, Luk. 23. 23. 24. Yet was not ſeparation required, neither yet
did the faithfull reiect their comunion.
               Secondly is not the angell of the ſeparation both a perſequ

poynt, of deceyving the prince, it is moſt evident in ſpeciall in their apology
dedicated vnto the kings majeſtie, wherein as much as in them lay, they have
ſought to draw him vnto errour: This appeareth by Mr. Iohnſons owne confeſſion
and recantation wherein he hath recalled ſundry of his errours conteyned
in that booke: But the Ainſworthians do ſtill perſiſt notwithſtanding the admonition
given by Mr. Iohnſon: So that by this reaſon the ſeparatiſts themſelves are
to be ſeparated from; we ſee hereby how the peece of ordinance wherewith
they ſhoote at others doth recoyle vpon themſelves &amp; wound their owne
communion.

                  NOw remaines the concluſion of this writing to be conſidred,
                  Advertiſ. pag. 13. 14 
                  where after the
reherſall of Mr. Brightm. his wordes declaring their wicked and blaſphemous
errour, who do ſo fall away from this church as if Chriſte were
baniſhed wholly from hence etc▪ Deleſcluſe doth then cry out againſt him;
And ſo by this what ſoever ſinnes, errours, wickedneſſes, abhominatiōs
he hath ſhewed before to be both in the angell and in the church
it ſelf, all is now cured by this ſalve: 
                     〈◊〉
                   moſt miſerable dawbing with
vntempered morter.
               Firſt, note his falſe dealing and abuſe of Mr. Br. as though he had ſayd or meant
that all the ſinnes,Anſw. 1. errours &amp; corruptions of the church of England had bene
cured &amp; ſalved by this his teſtimony againſt the ſeparation; as though he could
not have reproved the ſchiſme of the Browniſtes from the church
of England, except he had allowed all the corruptions therein; whereas on the
contrary we have ſhewed how vainely and ſenſeleſſely Deleſcluſe hath trifeled
to prove a ſeparation from the allegations and teſtimonies of Mr Brightman above
noted: Yea even in this very place Mr. Br. telleth vs in expreſſe wordes that
we may neither take▪ pleaſure in them as ſome mayntainers of thoſe corrup
doe, neither may we forſake and fall from the church as the Browniſtes
doe, he ſhewes in the ſame place that he wiſheth health of minde vnto
both theſe ſorts that are in a contrary extremity: And this his wiſh ſhewes
that he thought theſe co
                     ••
                  uptions ſtill to be vncured, &amp; therfore is he moſt iniuriouſly
charged with the contrary by Deleſcluſe.
               
               Secondly,2. as for his exclamation of moſt miſerable dawbing with vntem
                     
                        •••
                     ed
morter it is a notable inſtance of the impudency of the Browniſtes, who
in the middes of their ignorance, do ſo boldly open a mouth againſt the learnedeſt
miniſters in the churches of God: And much more iuſtly may it be returned vpon
Deleſcluſe his owne head, whoſe conſequences &amp; collections for ſeparatiō
from Mr. Br. his ſpeeches are all of them vntempered morter &amp; all his reaſoning
a moſt miſe
                        •••
                      dawbing: The iniquity of this his exclamation

may eaſily be ſeene in this that he doth not refute Mr. Br. his reaſons alledged in
this place but paſſes thē over in ſilence: Mr. Br. ſhewes of Laodicea that though
the angell thereof was miſerable and poore and blinde and naked yet communion
was lawfull, Chriſt ſtill ſupped with the ſame, he ſhewes withall that
though the like miſery be alſo found in England, as being the Antitype of Laodicea,
yet that there is a preſence of Chriſte communicating with them, which he
proves further from the experience of the Browniſtes themſelves compared with
the ſcriptures Rom. 10. 13. etc. Rev. 3. 20. It had bene fitter for del. to have
given a ſound anſwer vnto theſe reaſons then with a ſound of wordes to have
made ſo lowde an exclamation.
               Thirdly,3. by the private and publique confeſſion and teſtimony of Deleſcluſe
there is a miſerable dawbing with vntempred morter among the Browniſtes
themſelves, for this Del. hath often avouched and affirmed that there is but
one ſound warrant and example in the ſcriptures to ſtay men from anabaptiſme,
namely the example of the apoſtate Iſraelites that were not recircumciſed when
they ioyned againe with Iudah in the worſhip of God, were it not for this example,Plea for

he ſayth that he himſelf would be rebaptiſed: If this be true that he
ſayth, then is both Mr. Clifton and Mr. Iohnſon a miſerable dawber ſeing they †
both have vſed many other arguments and a multitude of ſcriptures againſt rebaptiſation:
If there be but one ſound argument, then all the other are vnſound
and falſe, and conſequently vntempered morter: Now theſe other reaſons being
vſed by the Franciſcanes while he was yet among them, why did he not teſtify
againſt their vn ſound doctrine and convince them of their errour? how could
he endure to ſee ſuch a number of holy ſcriptures perverted, falſifyed and abuſed
by Mr. Ioh. and Mr. Clift. and yet hold his peace? how could he ſuffer them to
give ſo great advantage vnto Mr. Smith and other anabaptiſtes by alledging againſt
them ſo many colourable pretences and ſhadowes of reaſon wherein he
thought there was no ſubſtance? VVhat ſincerity is there in the courſe of theſe
men that ſee one an others daubing &amp; yet wink at the ſame? VVhy may we not
think that Deleſc. doth now alſo diſcerne ād behold ſome dawbing in Mr. Ainſw.
Tho. Cocky, Ioh. Hales and that he winkes at it as he did before in Mr. Ioh. and
Mr. Clifton? Thus may we here ſee touching Deleſcluſe the onely governing
elder of the Ainſworthians, that as there is but one ſtep betwixt him and anabaptiſme
by his owne confeſſion, ſo is there never a ſtep betwixt him and the path
of hypocriſye; he that ſees his fellowes dawbing with vntempered morter and
lets them alone in their ſin, muſt needes be a miſerable dawber himſelf, he
that profeſſeth himſelf a ſeparatiſt from all knowne ſinners, and yet ſees his fellowes
ſinning openly in print, by abuſing the ſcriptures in great meaſure and ſtill
continuing in this offence and yet tolerates them herein, how can he be eſteemed
otherwiſe then as an apparant hypocrite?
            
            
               
               40.
               
                  ONce more he yet renewes his former reaſoning and exclaming &amp; ſayth vnto
vs:

                     . Can any preach in the office of an angell purely and ſincerely
who is a theefe and a robber? ſhall any adminiſter purely who is not
lawfully called therevnto as Aaron was? Can any vnlawfull miniſter
adminiſter lawfully the ſeales of Gods covenant vnto dogges and ſwyne
purely and ſincerely? O ceaſſe to do evill, learne to do good! God
who is iealous etc.
               For the ſubſtance of this obiection it is twiſe anſwered before,Anſw. ſection 18. &amp;
36. yet for the further ſtopping of his wide mouth that without cauſe talketh ſo
much of theeves, robbers, vnlawfull miniſters, dogges, ſwine etc. we do
here demand of him, can any preach in the office of an angell purely, and ſincerely
who is an apoſtata and hath for ſaken the moſt holy fayth as H. A. in the account
of all the Browniſtes hath done? Can any adminiſter purely who for their
ſchiſme have bene depoſed from their miniſtery continuing ſtill in their ſchiſme
as H. A. and this Del. have bene? Can the ſeales of Gods covenant be adminiſtred
purely &amp; ſincerely vnto ſuch as are reiected as dogges &amp; ſwine, vnto ſuch as
William Clerke, Richard Benet, George Parker etc. who for their
ſin &amp; wickednes are excommunicated by Mr. Iohnſon &amp; his company &amp; conſequently
eſteemed as dogges &amp; ſwine though yet reteyned in communion by Mr.
Ainſworthes company which by this meanes in the iudgement of the Browniſts
themſelves is become a ſtye of ſwine &amp; one body with excommunicates? ſhall
thoſe who by the Franciſcanes are accounted vnworthy to gather vp the crummes
vnder their table, become ſtewards of the houſe to break the bread vnto the
children of the Ainſworthians? ſhall thoſe that are iudged vnworthy to heare
the worde, be allowed for prophets to preach the word? Yet thus it is in Thomas
Cocky and Iohn Hales, who being by Mr. Iohnſon &amp; his company
delivered vnto ſatan are yet ſet vp for prophets by Mr. Ainſworth and his
company to draw men from thoſe ſnares of Satan wherein themſelves do
ly enwrapped.
            
            
               41.
               
                  AFter this he ſeekes to lay two great ſinnes vpon Mr. Brightman for charging
them with blaſphemous errour &amp;c. And firſt, he would ſhew him to be a
perſecutour of the brethren &amp; that in theſe wordes;
                  Advertiſ. pag. 14. for what greater perſecution
could he put vpon thoſe poore ſoules which have ſeparated thē
                  ſelves
from thoſe evilles by himſelf ſet downe, then to accuſe or charge
them of blaſphemy? Yea it is ſuch a perſecution as that it is vnto death,
for by the law of God a blaſphemer muſt doe.
               
                  
Firſt,Anſw. 1. it is no ſin of perſequution to impute blaſphemy vnto thoſe that iuſtly
deſerve the ſame, for Luke and Paul and Iames did charge ſundry men with
blaſphemy and yet were not to be accounted perſequutors for the ſame as may
appeare, Act. 18. 6. 1. Tim. 1. 20. Ian. 2. 7. And ſeing Deleſcluſe hath
not proved Mr. Brightmans accuſation to be vniuſt vpon them, he can not iuſtly
charge him with perſecution.
               Secondly,2. ſuppoſe Mr. Br. had bene a perſequutor of the Browniſtes in this
ſpeech, yet is he not a perſecutour of the brethren ſo as Deleſcluſe chargeth
him, &amp; ſo as Mr. Br. noted the angell of the church of England to be in perſequuting their brethren that do remaine in communion with them, becauſe
the Browniſtes neither in their owne account nor in Mr. Br. account are
brethren, but ſuch as ſeparate from the fellowſhip of the faithfull
brethren.
               Thirdly,3. ſuppoſe Mr. B. had bene a perſecutour of the brethren, yet not vnto
death as Deleſcluſe doth write, for the law of God doth not ſimply and
generally require that every blaſphemer ſhould dye as this ignorant and inconſiderate
perſon doth affirme by his falſe application of the ſentence of the law vnto
Mr. brightmans ſpeech: The law requireth that he which curſeth his God
and blaſphemeth the name of the Lord ſhalbe put to death Lev. 24. 15.
16. but beſides this high degree of blaſphemy, there were many kindes of blaſphemy
not puniſhable with death by the law: Every reproch, ſlander &amp; evill
ſpeech either of a mans brother, or any part of Gods truth may iuſtly according
to the ſcriptures be called blaſphemy as hath bene ſignified &amp; ſhewed ūto vs frō
theſe places, Mat. 15. 19. Eph. 4. 31. Tit. 3. 2. 2. Pet. 2. 12. Iude, 10.
And who will ſay, that all theſe ſinnes were to be puniſhed with death by the
magiſtrate?
               Fourthly,4. ſuppoſe Mr. B. had perſecuted them to the death, yet might there
have bene a greater perſecution contrary to that which Deleſcluſe by his queſtion
doth here pretend, in ſaying, what greater perſecution could he put vpon
thoſe poore foules etc. for there are divers kindes of death, ſome are more painefull
&amp; ſhamefull then others &amp; ſome perſons are more to be deteſted in death
then others; And thoſe that do vniuſtly lay vpon men the vileſt death are greater
perſequutours then ſome others that yet put men to death alſo: And in ſpeciall
many of the Browniſtes are greater perſequutours of vs then Deleſcluſe dare yet
for ſhame pretend againſt Mr. B. for divers of them bluſh not to ſay that we have
ſinned againſt the holy ghoſte, that no place of repentance is left vnto vs and all
this for teſtifying againſt their ſchiſme: Now blaſphemy againſt the holy ghoſt being
greater then other blaſphemy, Matt. 12. 31. Luk. 12. 10. It
may hence appeare that they are greater perſequutours of vs, then Mr. Br.
is of them, ſeing in their blinde and raſh moode they charge vs with greater
blaſphemy, then Mr. Br. doth them.
               
                  
Lalſtly,5. if imputation of blaſphemy be perſequution vnto death, then are the
Browniſtes themſelves deadly perſequutours of one an other: for to omit manifold
other proofes hereof, they do mutually teſtify of one an other as of falſe
churches: Mr. Iohnſon &amp; his company ſay of Mr. Ainſworth &amp; his company
that they are a ſchiſme and no true church: Againe Mr. Ainſw. &amp; his people
do reiect Mr. Iohnſons company, yea divers of the Ainſworthians do affirme
of the Franciſcanes, that they are worſe then the worlde: If ſome other
                     •
                  
ſhould thus ſpeake of them, they would account them vncircumciſed Ph

an other? Do they not ſeek one an others blood in making one an other blaſphemers?

deceitfull reaſons &amp; perſwaſions have miſlead &amp; ſeduced many ſimple perſons
and have ſought out reaſons of baniſhment and miſery vnto many by leading
them vnto ſchiſme: Let thoſe that are yet alive bewaile their offence
herein.
               
                  
Thirdly, ſeing the Browniſtes themſelves do now mutually abandon one an
others company why do they blame others for doing ſuch thinges as themſelves
do practiſe?3. Their reiection of one an other is now more grevous then baniſhment,
whiles they baniſh one an other from the pledges &amp; ſeales of Gods
covenant▪ Yea the church of England ſhewes more favour and kindenes vnto
the Browniſtes thē the Franciſ
                     •
                  anes &amp; the Ainſworthians do vnto one an other,
whiles they do both reiect thoſe that are preſent at the worſhip or miniſtery of
th' other, &amp; do alſo refuſe many of them to eate one with an other: Do they
not now by their owne example teach the magiſtrates &amp; princes vnder which
they live to reiect &amp; baniſh them alſo?
               Fourthly,4. whereas the Franciſ
                     •
                  anes do now profeſſe that at May next they
purpoſe to remoove their habitation &amp; to go &amp; dwell at Embden, divers of
the Ainſworthians do affirme that they have ſo behaved themſelves in the place
where they now dwell that they are aſhamed to tary there any longer, &amp; therfore
that it is time for them to remove and to be gone thence: If theſe thinges
be ſo then is it not the deceit of Mr. Br. &amp; others of his minde to procure their
baniſhment as Deleſcluſe obiecteth, but it is the ſhame of their owne wicked
converſation that doth baniſh the Browniſtes &amp; drive them from one place to
an other.
               Fiftly,5. to make it plaine &amp; evident what minde the Browniſtes have to baniſh
one an other, let vs here conſider what the Ainſworthians have * written againſt
the Franciſcanes &amp; given vnto thoſe arbiters appoynted by the magiſtrates
for the hearing of their ſtrife about their meeting houſe:

theſe themſelves propounded and by the church of Leyden and vs agreed
to, theſe after reverſed and ſtood not vnto vnleſſe we would goe
dwell out of the city: And although in the treatie of the agreement, it
was teſtifyed by the elders of that church, that vnleſſe it were to the
apparant vndoing of vs and of our families, we ſhould not be diſmiſſed
againe to dwell here: Yet becauſe we would not abſolutely promiſe
to leave this citie, they would not ſtand to the agreement which
themſelves had made. Beſides the accuſation of falſhood, &amp; covenant-breaking
here noted, obſerve alſo the cruelty of the Franciſcanes in ſeeking to
baniſh the Ainſworthians &amp; to have them out of the citie (as they complaine)
though it were to the apparant vndoing of them and their families: Is
not this a mercileſſe kinde of baniſhment that is ſought by them? do they not
herein take one another by the throate with their vnpitifull handes? May we not
here ſee the truth of the wiſe mans ſaving;Prov. 28. 3 * A poore man if he oppreſſe the
poore is like a raging raine that leaveth no foode? Yea the raging oppreſſion
of the Browniſtes tendes to their apparant overthrow &amp; vndoing even by
their owne confeſſion. And therfore as Deleſcluſe throughout his advertiſement
doth draw his collections from Mr. Br. his wordes againſt the church of
England, even ſo may we 
                     〈◊〉
                   better reaſon condemne the Browniſtes out
of their

                   Thus may we ſhoote with the Browniſtes in thie

bow, &amp; wound them with their owne arrowes.
               Laſtly,6. beſides the degrees &amp; kindes of baniſhment above noted, we do here
demand of the Browniſtes both of the Franciſcanes &amp; Ainſworthians, what they
would doe if they had a magiſtrate according to their mindes, ſuch an one as
they have often wiſhed for; would they not then baniſh one an other perſiſting
in thoſe courſes which they do now condemne mutually in one an other? 
                     〈◊〉

downe the vertues of his owne ſchiſmaticall flocke,
                  Advertiſ. pag. 14. 
                  in theſe wordes; And
indeed although I am but a ſtranger vnto them and one of an other people,
yet the truth cauſed me to ſpeak thus in their behalf, that I
know not any people at this day vnder the ſunne more loyall and faithfull
vnto their prince and country, and more zelous and religious towards
God, then they are:
               Firſt,Anſw. 1. being about to ſound the trūpet of their praiſe, for defence of his modeſty
he telles vs that he is but a ſtranger vnto them and one of an other people;
but this is not enough to excuſe his flattery &amp; boaſting, for though he be
a ſtranger vnto thē as he is a french man, yet as he is a Browniſt &amp; a ſchiſmatique
he is one of them, &amp; therfore notwithſtanding his different nation may be as
partiall in praiſing of them as any other of thē &amp; above many of them, in that
he is an elder, a governour &amp; a prophet among them: It had bene much more
for their credit if ſome other of their neighbours had praiſed them, but this
they want being eſteemed both of the magiſtrates &amp; miniſters of the reformed
churches to be a contentious ſect; And therfore while Deleſcluſe being incorporate
into their ſchiſme doth thus extoll his frendes &amp; brethren, it may iuſtly
be ſayd vnto him:Pro. 27. 1. * He that praiſeth his frendes with a loude voyce riſing
early in the morning it ſhalbe counted to him as a curſe.
               
               Secondly,2. for the length of his compariſon, in that he ſayth, he knowes no
people vnder the ſunne more loyall etc. how vaine &amp; fooliſh is this? Though
he know none in the eaſt or weſt Indies more loyall then theſe, this is nothing
to their praiſe becauſe he knowes not thoſe nations at all, nor many other far nearer
which are yet all vnder the ſunne: And thus this large compariſon is nothing
els but the lowde noyſe of an idle commendation.
               Thirdly,3. for their commendable loyalty and faithfulnes vnto their prince and

                     〈◊〉

their preſumptuous tranſgreſſion of the lawes have ſmarted for the ſame: And
where then is their ſingular loyalty &amp; faithfulnes?
               Fourthly,4. for their zeale of religion where is it? doth it not vaniſh into the
ſmoke of contention? Yea is it not confeſſed by many of them, that they neither
feele in themſelves nor ſee in others that zeale &amp; comfort thereof which
they felt &amp; ſaw before their ſeparation? For this alſo we could alledge ſundry
witneſſes of themſelves beſides our owne knowledge.
            
            
               44.
               
                  BVt he proceedes yet further to amplify his commendations &amp; prayſes of the
zeale and religion in the Browniſtes which as he ſayth are ſeene in them
and among them both privately and publiquely:

as that I am fully perſwaded that they are and ſhalbe if they continue
faithfull vnto the end, that people by which chiefely Antichriſte the man
of ſin ſhalbe rooted out.
               Behold here the proude conceit that the Browniſtes have of thēſelves without all
reaſon,
                     
                        ••
                     ſw. 1. it is much that ſuch fantaſies ſhould enter into the head of Deleſcluſe,
it is more that they ſhould be rooted therein with ſuch full perſwaſion as he
ſpeakes of, it is yet more that he ſhould not be aſhamed to vtter, yea &amp; in print
to publiſh this his arrogant opinion, but moſt of all that his fellowes &amp; his brethren
ſhould allow or tolerate in him this ſtrange dreame or viſion of vanitye: for
whereas the Lord in his holy word hath noted vnto vs thoſe honourable inſtruments
by whom cheefely Antichriſte is to be overthrowne, we deſire Deleſcluſe
to ſhew vnto vs where the Browniſtes are numbred among them: VVe ſee
in the booke of the revelation that as the Lord in ſundry viſions hath there declared
vnto vs the ſpeciall inſtruments whereby Antichriſte was to be exalted, ſo
hath he alſo in other viſions there deſcribed vnto vs thoſe worthies and bleſſed inſtrumentes
by whom cheefely he is againe to be caſt downe: By the conſent of
the beſt ād learnedeſt interpreters there are noted out vnto vs in the Apocalyps divers
eſtates both eccleſiaſticall &amp; civill that have wounded Antichriſte, but no
interpreter that ever yet could finde the Browniſtes among them: VVe read of
divers angelles fighting againſt Antichriſte, Rev. 14. 6. 7. 8. 9. And theſe do
fitly declare vnto vs ſuch as Iohn Wickleffe, Iohn Huſſe, Hierome of Prage,
Martin Luther &amp; ſuch like, but where be the angelles that may fiftly repreſent
vnto vs Robert Browne, H. Barow, Francis Iohnſon etc.

againſt Antichriſte. Rev. 11. 15. 16. and 14. 14. 17. and 16. 1.
and 17. 16. For the further vnderſtanding whereof we deſire the reader to

conſider &amp; weigh Mr. Brightmans expoſition of thoſe places; But where is the
lot and roome of the Browniſtes? VVere is their atchievement regiſtred among
theſe cheefe inſtruments of the Lord?
               Secondly,2. whereas he telles vs that this his full perſwaſion dependes vpon a
condition viz. If they continue faithfull vnto the end, whereas alſo Mr.
Iohnſon &amp; his followers doe now in the account of Deleſcluſe ſlide back from
their ancient faith &amp; are already proved vnfaithfull, Mr. Robiniſon alſo halting
betwixt them in ſome thinges, theſe thinges duely conſidred the full perſwaſiō of
Deleſcluſe may quickly turne into a faint perſwaſion and his vaine confidence
into a wan-hope.
            
            
               45.
               
                  THe reaſon of his glorious perſwaſion touching the Browniſtes he ſetteth downe
in theſe wordes:
                  Advertiſ. pag. 15. For by that purity of doctrine which they do teach
and by the ſincere and publique adminiſtration of the glorious kingdome
of Chriſte publiquely and before all the people; as alſo by profeſſing
that glorious liberty in the goſpell, that if any ſin be ſhewed or
manifeſted vnto them by the word of God, is amended whatſoever oppoſition
may be to the contrary, by thoſe thinges I ſay by them profeſſed
practiſed and taught, it is impoſible that where they have place,
Antichriſte can or have any doore to come in.
               Firſt,Anſw. 1. for their purity of doctrine, they have no groundes of pure doctrine
which other churches of Chriſt round about them have not as well as they,
VVhy do they exalt themſelves in that which others have as well as they and
before them?
               Other churches have this doctrine alſo in better and more abundant maner
then they;2. for H. A. I. Deleſcluſe, Thomas Cocky, Iohn Hales and
ſuch like prophets do not teach the pure doctrine with half that purity, grace,
power &amp; fruite that the miniſters of other churches doe.
               Beſides their ignorance,3. their doctrine is divers wayes impure &amp; mixt with
ſundry errours, new doctrines &amp; faithes leading vnto ſchiſme &amp; confuſion &amp;
is therfore in part recanted by Mr. Iohnſon.
               For their glorious liberty in their publique adminiſtration the anabaptiſts
may boaſt thereof as much as they,4. ſeing the anabaptiſtes are as publique
in their adminiſtration as the Browniſtes and the browniſtes are but followers
of them therein as they are alſo in the moſt or all thoſe thinges, wherein
they differ from vs.
               
                  
For their ſincere adminiſtration thereof againſt all oppoſition whatſoever
as he boaſteth,5. how vaine is it? Before the ſchiſme of the Ainſworthians from
the Franciſcanes,

then effect, is now effected ſince that governement was changed by Mr.
Iohnſon.
               VVhereas he ſayth that Anti-chriſte cannot have any doore to come in, where
thoſe thinges by them profeſſed and practiſed have any place,6. it is alſo falſe: for
ſuppoſe the doctrine and diſcipline of the Browniſtes were both of them pure,
even as pure as in the apoſtles times yet might Antichriſte finde a doore to come
in by, as well as he did in the time of the apoſtles, where there were better
meanes to keep him out, then the Browniſtes now have, ſee 1. Ioh. 2. 18.

                      15. And for my part
I do bleſſe the day in which I had that grace from my God to
know both the people and their faithfull walking in their wayes and
religion of God.
               If a ſtranger meete with this booke of Deleſcluſe he may be divers wayes deceyved
by him in this deceitfull ſpeech:Anſw. 1. for if he know not that the Browniſtes
are broken and rent in the middes falling one from an other, then by this falſe
report of Deleſc. he may be drawne to think that the Browniſtes do faithfully
cleave vnto one an other and walke conſtantly in their wayes without ſchiſming
from one an other, which is moſt vntrue.
               And further againe if a ſtranger do know that they are rent a ſunder,2. and yet
withall know not of what ſide Deleſcluſe is, then ſhall the ſtranger be left in vncertainty
not knowing whether he meane the Franciſcanes or Ainſworthians to
be that faithfull people, hereafter therfore let Deleſcluſe learne to ſpeak more
plainely and to avoyd his deceitfull ſpeeches; for ought that he hath here written
he might be taken for a Franciſcane and ſo his faction might looſe that praiſe
of faithfullnes which he intendeth for them.
            
            
               
               47.
               
                  DRawing to an end he ſeales vp his booke with this prayer for the browniſtes;
                  Advertiſ. pag. 15.
I beſeech the Lord of his grace even with teares that he vouchſafe
to open the eyes of their moſt noble and wiſe prince that he may ſee the
iuſtice and equity of their cauſe and cavſe them to ſee his royall face and
preſence againe with ioy and gladnes of heart vnder his dominions
and iuriſdictions, Amen.
               In this prayer or forme of prayer,Anſw. 1. obſerve firſt how he diſhonours the Lord
and takes his name in vayne by praying for the manifeſtation of the iuſtice and
equity of their cauſe which is ſo full of iniuſtice and iniquitye: As Saul took
the name of God in vayne by his bleſſing the Ziphims for their ſhew of compaſſion
which indeed was cruelty 1. Sam. 23. 21. So doth Deleſcluſe by bleſſing
of the browniſtes for the equity of their cauſe which is indeed a meere
iniquity.
               Secondly,2. mark here his vaine publiſhing of his owne devotion &amp; zeale, viz.
his praying with teares, yet is it no ſound commendation of himſelf while his
teares are ſpent in ſuch a cauſe: Deleſcluſe may remember ſince he was a Papiſt
that many of thoſe idolatours in their ſuperſtitious devotion do often times
weepe &amp; powre forth their teares before their idolles &amp; images: As thoſe teares
can not iuſtify their devotion, no more can theſe teares powred forth by
Deleſcluſe for the idoll of their ſeparation iuſtify his devotion.
               Thirdly,3. mark his flattery of the king calling him their moſt noble and wiſe
prince: It is the property of true nobility to try the ſpirits of men by the
ſcripture, as the beraeans did Act. 17. 11. If therfore he be noble and moſt noble
they will not deny but that he hath examined their ſpirits &amp; the ſcriptures alledged
by them &amp; preſented vnto his maieſty in their petitions; &amp; then withall if
he be moſt wiſe how is it that he can not ſee the myſterie of their ſeparation having
their cheefe reaſons &amp; proofes layd open before him? Yea by the ſentence
of this Deleſc. there is nothing to be * expected by him from Chriſte but the
powring out of his aeternall wrath vpon him,Advertiſ. pa. 9. &amp; 11 nothing as touching his viſible eſtate
but aeternall flames of everlaſting damnation, If this be his abiect &amp; baſe eſtate,
how is he moſt noble or moſt wiſe.
               Fourthly,4. we do here demand of Deleſcluſe touching this his prayer, whether
it be lawfull for any of his flock in the reading of his booke &amp; withall of
this his prayer therein to lift vp their hearts vnto the Lord, to deſire the ſame
thing &amp; to ſay Amen with him vnto this his petition: If they may not, then is
it a ſory prayer which may not be aſſented vnto by an other, &amp; then is he a ſory
guide to go before his flock in ſuch deſires as it is not lawfull for them to folow
him; but if they may pray the ſame thing with him &amp; in the reading of his wordes
may ſay Amen vnto his wiſh, then conſider on th' other ſide how according
to the doctrine of the Browniſtes, he makes himſelf guilty of idolatry, for they

tell vs that read prayer and ſet formes of prayer are idolles &amp; the vſe of them
idolatry, Mr. Ain
                     •
                  worth in ſpeciall hath compared them to the golden calves
that Ie
                     •
                  oboam erected, &amp; if this be ſo then hath Deleſcluſe here in the end of
his booke ſet vp a golden calfe by ſetting downe this forme of prayer &amp; then all
the Browniſtes that in the reading thereof do lift vp their hearts in prayer to deſire
the ſame thing, all theſe (we ſay) do then bow downe vnto his calfe &amp; worſhip
the ſame and ſo commit idolatry.

                  HAſting to a finall concluſion he ſayth;
                  Advertiſ. pa. 15. And ſo 
                     •
                  do here end though many
more thinges might be ſayd touching ſeparation from evill, and
adioyning or following that which is good:
               Mark here how he paynts the face of his ſeparation,Anſw. in calling it a ſeparation
from evill etc. whereas indeed it is a ſeparation from that which is good becauſe
of ſome evill mixed therewith▪ &amp; a reiection of the godly for the wicked ſake
which is a thing moſt wicked, Gen. 18. 25.
               Here he will end but it had bene better for him not to have begun: He telles
vs many more thinges might be ſayd touching ſeparation, we tell him
alſo that many more thinges may be ſayd againſt the ſame: The iudicious reader
may eaſily diſcerne that in all theſe arrowes which he hath ſhot he hath
ſtill miſſed the marke, his bow of braſſe is broken &amp; all his vaine reaſoninges againſt
Mr. Bright▪ are turned vpon his owne head: If he have more thinges to ſay hereafter
let him ſee that they be of more weight then theſe.

                  LAſt of all he addeth:
                  Advertiſ. pag. 15. And in deed in a word we ſhall not read from the
beginning of the world to this day that there was ever any true
church of God truely eſtabliſhed but by ſeparation: and therfore this
people not to be blaſphemers but true worſhippers of God.
               Behold here a heape of falſhood couched vp togather in a few wordes for a
farewell to his reader:Anſw. 1. For firſt, it is falſe which he ſayth of eſtabliſhing churches
by ſeparation from the beginning of the world: Let him ſhew how the
church of God before the flood was eſtabliſhed by ſuch a ſeparation as the Browniſtes
have in their writinges deſcribed vnto vs: we have here his bare word onely
which is of no credit, his aſſeveration here vſed by him, viz. in deed in a
word is but a word without deed &amp; without truth.
               Secondly,2. it is falſe which he ſayth of eſtabliſhing true churches by ſeparation
vnto this day: And this not onely in reſpect of the church of England
which by Mr. Iohnſons confeſſion is a true church though not eſtabliſhed by the
ſeparation of the B
                     •
                  owniſtes, but alſo in reſpect of the dutch &amp; french churches
which by the Browniſtes them ſelves are acknow
                     •
                  ledged for true churches &amp; yet

were not eſtabliſ
                     •
                  hed by the ſeparation in queſtion: Yea they do reiect &amp; condemne
the ſeparation of the Browniſtes as ſchiſme: Do theſe churches then
practiſe and reteyne a ſeparation without their knowledge, againſt their willes
&amp; contrary to their doctrine? Or if they do thus maintaine a ſeparation not being
aware thereof, ſhall this vnwitting &amp; vnwilling ſeparation be a true ground
&amp; foundation of their church? ſhall their ignorant practiſe eſtabliſh them
&amp; iuſtify their eſtate? we would faine know of Deleſcluſe how theſe thinges
can ſtand ſound.
               Thirdly,3. ſuppoſe this aſſertion of his touching ſeparation were true, yet his inference
therevpon is falſe, in that he ſayth and therfore this people not to
be blaſphemers: Though a man hold ſeparation yet may he be a blaſphemer
in many other reſpectes: For example, Mr. Smith holding the ſeparation of the
Browniſtes was yet a blaſphemer for that which he wrote againſt the vſe of the
tranſlated &amp; originall ſcriptures in the worſhip of God. And ſo Mr. Ihonſon
ſtill holding the ſeparation is yet by the Ainſworthians accounted a blaſphemer,
one that ſpeakes evill of the way of God, in reſpect of his new interpretation of
Mat. 18. Deleſcluſe reaſons here as though there was no blaſphemy but againſt
ſeparation, how blindely &amp; partially let the reader iudge.
               Fourthly,4. he bringes yet an other falſe inference from the former aſſertion, in
ſaying, &amp; therfore this people not to be blaſphemers but true worſhippers of
God: for the former aſſertion touching ſeparation is mainteyned by Anabaptiſtes
yea &amp; by ſome of the Arrians, doth it herevpon follow that they are true
worſhippers of God? Nothing leſſe: Yet ſuch is the fruit of Deleſcluſe his
reaſoning▪ further whereas the Browniſtes do acknowledge the dutch &amp; french
churches to be a ſeparate people &amp; true churches eſtabliſhed by ſeparation &amp; yet
condemne the read prayer vſed by them as being a falſe and idolatrous worſhip,
it may hence appeare evidently that his argument for proofe of their true worſhip
is very vaine and falſe: He may here ſee that the truth of Gods worſhip doth
not depend vpon ſeparation.
               
                  Prov. 12. 15.
                  The vvay of a foole is right in his ovvne eyes:
                  But he that heareth counſell is vviſe.
