            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE WORTHILY ENOBLED, THE HIGH AND MOST HONOVRABLE MARQVIS OF BVCKINGHAM, WITH ALL HIS OTHER WELL DESERUING TITLES, and attributes.
            Right Honourable,
            
               AS the diuine Maiestie proportioned all his attributes and works to some speciall end and purpose, redacting the world out of a confused Chaos for the vse of man to a beautifull vniformity; raising man out of a heape of dust to glorifie his Creator: sending his only Son to redeeme vs from the curse of the law, an expiation for our rebellious transgressions, and proposing his Mercy and Iustice
               
with equall distribution as the mastring curbs of all humane endeauours: with such like. So should we erect the frame of our actions vpon the foundation of preuailing effects, and not attempt any thing without a speciall limitation. For euen little children, that sport in the aire at randome can say, they meant to exercise themselues, or in emulation to shoot higher then their fellowes. This inciteth me (right Honorable) to anticipate their calumniation, or derision, that shall startle me with these questions, why I presumed like a seeled doue to flie at randome with such disguises, and amongst all others firmed my selfe on the sun-shining beautie of your house. I answere both with the same truth and plainesse, that detruded me betweene the streights of censuring imperfections: Besides the manifest reasons inserted in the Title and Preface, An honest fame, and peraduenture orderly profit to maintaine a poore liberty of life, and keepe vertue vnspotted

from the filthinesse of corruption, were the markes of my aime. But concerning your Honour, an earnest desire to prostrate my endeauours before you, and a meere presaging confidence, that with vndefiled vowes you will charily preserue the loue of our Countrey, impulsed this insinuation, and extended the Argument thus farre; that as it hath pleased his Maiesty to ouermantle you with fauour, and support you with greatnesse (wherein Princes make their vertues truly eminent, and worthily exalted) so you will remember, that the good seruant augmented his tallent; and he liues not at all, who liues onely to himselfe. Therefore Great Lord let me I pray you behold you like a faire moouing Planet in a sufficient Orbe, from whose influence can proceede nothing but sweete presages, and if there be any thing in these triuiall discourses, that may boast of your acceptation, and noble construction, make me the prouder, because I come so simply naked

without palpable flattery, or cunning displaying your Fame and merit. Besides, howeuer I am so great a stranger, that not so much as the sound of my name hath passed by your eares, so low a shrubbe, that I stand at a stay, and keepe my owne greennes, and so ruinous a wall, that euen bosome friends haue started away for feare of falling vpon them: I must be yet contented, and hope, you will not search me so narrowly as vpon the discouerie of my imperfections to pretend my contempt, nor dismisse me vilipended, when all the world hath proclaimed your worth. In which assurance I thus cast my selfe into the open mouth of the Monster of the world, Opinion: and presume to be preserued by the Antidote of your Patronage from any dangerous infection, or Lethal ruine.
            
               Your Honors humble obseruant,
            
            
               TH: GAINSFORD.
            
         
         
            
            The Preface.
            Nec Adulatori. Nec Detractori.
            
               ALthough there is no end of writing books (as saies the Preacher) and the vexation of our very soules ariseth from the desire of knowledge, especially when we steppe a little into vaine-glory, the last thing laide away of the wisest men: yet either custome, or some particular purposes doe still traduce many in this kinde, who otherwise walked with sufficient reputation, and like the foole in the Prouerbes might haue beene counted wise, if they had held their peace. So that it cannot chuse, but I must incurre the like imputation, yea peraduenture ridiculous contempt; when I haue nothing to say, but for the glory of my Countrey, and seeme to maintaine a Position, which few Englishmen deny, and that I doe herein no more, then the Swizer or Sauoian, who preferreth his snowy hils, before the beauty All nations loue their owne Countrey best. of Lombardy, and rageth in his disceptation, if you either vilipend his barren Mountaines and dangerous passages, or preferre any other glorious nation before him. But againe, when I striue to mount a little higher, and tune out this harmony to a reach of excellency, and prerogatiue

ouer all kingdomes, and people in such things, wherein God doth blesse any Nation, you now would a little procrastinate my iourney, and cannot but suppose me ouer-liberall and ouer-partiall in my iudgement, especially, if 1. either you are a stranger: 2. Or haue beene a Traueller: 3. Or looke no further, then on the bescarred and deformed face of antiquity as Authours haue wounded the same: 4. Or liue discontented through particular greeuances in your Countrey: 5. Or are wilfull and irregular by the impostures of superstition: 6. Or affrighted at the power and greatnesse of other Princes: 7. Or transported with a poore opinion of our wealth: 8. Or to conclude, are meerely ignorant, and vnderstand no more, then is conferred vpon you by relation of others: wherein you must needes resemble certaine empty trunkes in Court remoues, who onely fill vp a place: but vnderstand not, wherefore, nor by whom they are imploied: yet because I would also satisfie these, and corroborate my Hypothesis with probable reason, I will lead them by the hand into the faire fields of this discouerie, and neuer desist, vntill they are conduced to safe harbour, and there Eccho out the truth in security; though it seeme a Panegyricall applause, and carry a phantasticall burthen of flattery. Onely the methode I would vse is somewhat intricate, and the desire I haue to shunne confusion, will make a greater confusion like a true and modest Louer, who fearing to disclose her affection by her lookes, doth in that restraint make the next looke more passionate.
            But to the purpose. If you be a stranger, which you 1 Strangers. may be either by ignorance, or nation: then peraduenture you looke no further, then what you see, or know, and not vnderstanding the honourable secret of our Countrey,

suppose nothing comparable to the ostentous brauery of some few stones, and dead things of those Cities, wherein you are reziant: but TACITVS, and other famous Authors can tell you, that Cities are not glorious with emptie houses, and lime and stone compacted for show, and subiect to ruine and breuiary demolition; but in the wisedome, wealth, and resplendant eminence of noble Citizens, and well ordered men: so that no man, vnacquainted with the secrets of a Kingdome, can comparatiuely subiect it either to vilipending, or insufficiency.
            If you are a Traueller? Then carried away with present shadowes, or transported with a cursory vanity of some 2 Traueller. stately edifices, braue Curtezans, entertainement of strangers (recommended by some speciall Councellour of State) strong castles, new ramparts, conuenient harbours, well furnished Arsenalls, some prety gallies, and hearkening after euery report to please the Hearing, or rauished with some comicke sight to moue admiration, you go no further, then present contentment, nor will once remember, what a mother you haue of your owne, and how a legitimate childe ought to be louing, dutifull, and aduised. 3 B

Wherein I cannot compare them better, then to some poore Farmer, who liuing in an old cottage, thatcht, and deformed, is compelled at last to go into another Countrey, as dispossessed by some wealthy Lawyer, or Citizen, and so relateth to his new acquaintance, what a pittifull house hee came from, and how miserable hee left the same, little knowing, how delicately, yea stately it is reedified, and holdeth vp such a contrary face of Maiesty, that if he were to returne, and view it againe, he could not imagine it the same, nor that any policy of man, or worldly meanes had contriued the alteration.
            If you liue discontented at home, then out of a sullen and dogged humour you spare not any accusation of your 4

            If you are superstitious, or would seeme affectionate to religion, then vnder a pious show of deuotion, you absolutely 5 Patisis. condemne all other things, and sweare they are vnualuable to the pacification of the conscience, and setling

the soule to peace, and vnderstanding the way to saluation; and so without either desire, or endeauours to entertaine a further truth, you not onely deny those allegations which may diuert you from falshood, but are an aduersarie to all commemorations of temporall matters, which may giue you light to conduct you to the acquaintance of ENGLANDS merit, and high exalted desert.

                        It begirteth those Countries formerly called, and many times still collaterally named, Scithia, Sarmatia, Albania, Ieccomangall, Sumongoll, Mercat, Metrit, the vast deserts of Lop, Tangut, Cathaia, and Mangia, so that shouldring all the Northren shore of the Caspian, it runneth along without controll by the high looking walles of China, and is

For after Agathirsis had taught the Inhabitants the vse of bow and arrowes, they became so expert in shooting, that from hunting and killing of beasts, they set vpon men and strangers, yea at last grew barbarous toward one another: so that the admirable report of the Amasons a principall Nation amongst them, is now esteemed a matter of probabilitie, who remembring their vowes to Diana, and customes of their Herculian Progenitors, accustomed to cut off their right pappes for the better dexterity of this military exercise, and so their famous exploits made all the Countrey reuerence the Goddesse for their sakes, in whose memory they performed actions beyond credit, and for whose reuerence Thoas beganne an Holocaust of strangers, as by the story of Iphigenia Agamemnons daughter may appeare: so that they continued in glorious estimation, till Tomyr is conquered Cyrus, and taught all mighty Monarchs and Tyrants this lesson, that the punishment of sinnes is a iudgement from heauen, and when they are in

                              aemales were reserued, and the males killed; or if you will beleeue so much for ciuilities sake, sent to their fathers; wherupon when time was weary of such degenerating inconueniences, and that some secret whisperers had incited the people to remember the glory of the first Creator, or the Goddesse, Nature, in mans resemblance, the better sort conspired against the women, and by degrees ware them out of the Countrey with many slaughters, teaching the obstinate the vicissitude of things, and admitting the submissiue vnder the warmth of louing embraces, by which occasion the men at last preuailed; and in time this vast Countrey was proud to be the life infuser into many valiant sonnes: such as Scitha with his mother Araxa, who conquered Armenia, and Scithes who married his mother in law Opaea, and performed actions beyond credit: such

as Othoman, Barka, Allau, Tamberlaine and others, whose noble exploits made Fame flie about the world to divulge how glorious valour and vertue was in some worthy spirits ouer others. But amongst many hundreds, none obtained so much at the hands of history and report, as Barka and Allau both named Emperors at one time. For when many battailes had filled the fieldes with the carkasses of as many thousands, the people weary of such slaughters, and they themselues amazed at the crueltie, it was concluded betweene them to diuide the Empire, hauing indeed a world of ground to satisfie ten Emperors: but some Authors are willing to maintaine, that they scorned such partition, and so in a noble combat decided the controuersie themselues, till the Controuler of men and kingdomes made Barka triumphant, who in the next lustrum of his gouernment had by the beautifull Tartara a sonne for his mothers sake named the Author of Peace, and proclaimed besides Barka Tartarus: so that when he leauing three sonnes behinde him, gaue them also leaue to diuide the Empire. The people were proude of their new name of Tartarians, and their Princes distinguished Tartarians a new name. with Tartar Chrim, Tartar Mercat, and Tartar Cham: who many times standeth for all the rest, &amp; drowneth the murmuring sound of inferiours with the full name of the great Emperor, and Lord of Lords. For although the Tartar Chrim would faine challenge affinitie with the Turke, expecting if the line of Othoman should faile the greatest share of the worlds magnificence: yet without question it is but a couert presumption, and the fanaticall hopes of some imposturing prediction: Otherwise hee dare not but acknowledge the Emperor Cham for his supreame; and is affrighted, when he heares of any complaints

to his preiudice: As for his further enlarging his credit, because Tamberlaine was extracted from him, who conquered Persia, Asia minor, and Baiazet, it will stand him in litle stead to startle from his first obedience, as I said before, and helpe him as litle to intrude into Turkie. for all he diuulgeth, that the sonnes of Tamberlaine brought with them the daughters of the Persian Sophy, and Othoman familie into Tartary, from whence he is now lineally descended. But some will haue it thus, that Barka in remembrance of the horrible confusion of the warres, named his sonne Tartarus, as a very deciphering of Hell, and that the people should be euer after affrighted at dissensions by recording the mischiefe formerly acted. But to proceede:
                           From Scithia to the prouince of Tangut they liue in troopes called Hordas, and remoue from place to place according to the temperature of the season, plenty of feeding, and conueniencie of accommodating one another: nor before the yeere of Redemption 1212 (as I said) did we in Europe heare of the name of a Tartar: but Scithians, Sarmatians, Albanians, and such like, who were all idolaters, worshipping their gods in trees, hanging vp their dead on nether boughes, and by way of auguring diuining their happines or damnation, which custome is still reteined amongst the barbarous sort in the remotest places. They are generally men of square stature, broad faces, hollow eyes, thin beards, owgly countenances, and tye vp their haire to the crowne of their heads in rolles, like a Snailes shell; to which you may adde swarthnes of complexion, not that the Sunne kisseth them with that feruencie, but the aire and their sluttish customes corrupts both their blood and bodies: yet hath nature preuailed ouer

these outward inconueniences in the distribution of valour, swiftness of footmanship, vigilancie, and patience to endure the many encombrances of trauell, hunger, and want of sleepe. They loue Horses, and from that loue accustome themselues to a sauage drinking of their blood, practising a cunning theft herein, which being vnpunishable, occasioneth many prety changes, both in keeping their owne, and purloyning from others, as if some ciuill Artist had instructed them with the Lacedemonian toleration Theft lawfull, and vnlawfull. in this kinde, for the better animating one another in the spoyling their enemies: yet for all this, by reason they liue in tents, and haue small defences for their furniture and goods, theft of petty things is seuerely punished amongst them, as also adulterie, or if you will lying with another mans wife, which is most odious vnto them, because they are tyed to the trusting of one another, as I said within dores, and no man is debarred any entercourse: it were therefore a double treachery to deceiue the trust reposed, and either purloyne the goods which lye open, or abuse the women which admit you so friendly. They are gouerned in their trauels and remouings by the starres, and obseruing the North pole settle according to her influence: They liue free from couetousnes, and are thus farre happy, that the strange corruptions of wealth, especially gold and siluer breed no disorders amongst them: yet haue they a kinde of trafficke, and by way of exchange continue mutuall commerces, louing presents, and can be contented to be flattered euen in their barbarisme: and herein I thinke all the Easterne people are delighted, from a receiued tradition of our Patriarkes. But howsoeuer, I can assure you Tartar Chrim himselfe, who is the most likeliest to be spoken with of all

others, as being the neerest, will not admit of any Christian without a gratuitie, and present worthy of his fauour.
                           You must now step a litle forward toward the East, and with the Sunnes rising see their glory arise: For Tangut is a wealthy Prouince, affording many things befitting Europes magnificence, especially Rheubarb, a simple of R

                                 barb. that prerogatiue, as if the whole world were beholding for this distribution, and had a sauing health by vertue of the same. In Cathaia amongst many others, the great Citie of Cambala will excite admiration, if you measure a quadrant of 30 mile about, and ouer-looke at euery corner a Tower 40 furlongs in circuit, erected for a Seralia or Arsenall, wherein the Emperors munition, armour, and prouision for war are secured: but he himself is sequestred to the priuacie of another stately Pallace, and is a strange Meteor amongst them seldome seene, but for some portentous accident. In Mangia as Queene of the rest, is the Citie of Quinzai, hauing a circumference of a 100 mile, by reason a great Lake of 30 mile diuideth the streets into channels, ouer which are numbred 1260 bridges, some opening the arches so high and wide, that a good ship vnder saile hath a passage of ease, but things a farre off are quickly reported; yet hardly beleeued, and sometimes ouer-beleeued vpon easie report, as you may perceiue by the trauels of Sr Iohn Mandeuile, the writings of Munster, and the constant asseueration of moderne Pilgrims, who all tell of so many monstrous shapes of men in these parts, that our ciuill people are affrighted at the hearing, and many times come flocking to see such Trauellers, as haue escaped the dangerous passages, and sauage immanitie. For my owne part I would perswade

you, that the world is a stage of variety and wonders, whereon are placed more strange things of truth, then the wit and policie of man can invent to seeme fabulous: but as at a stage the spectators onely are a few in number to the infinite multitudes for the time excluded; so in the exploration of Countries not one amongst ten thousand either take the paines, or haue the iudgement to looke into the wonders of the world, and therefore I would be loth to exclude all enlargements of histories from the closet of truth: yet concerning those fabulous reports of Pigmies and Cranes, of men with long eares, one eye, one foote, and such like, the Iudicious take vp the bookes to read, as if they would excite laughter; and I dare be bold to maintaine, there are no such men or people in the world: but all Gods images are miraculous in this distinction of voice, reason, and an erected countenance, with a proportion of shape, and what is not thus established, is meerely a monster, or a beast. But because I am sure, whether true or false, there is nothing amongst them worthy respect, or challenging any prerogatiue of happinesse, or imitation, I will leaue them to their vast territories, and desist from amasing you with the almost incredible particulars of those places, especially Cathaia, and Mangia.

Michelborn could haue testified, and many other English, surprized by disloyalty of such as haue thronged them on ship-boord, or wearied comming on shore amongst the Ilands of Moluccae and Philippinae either for water, or to view the countrey: yet haue some Portugals intruded themselues, and certaine Iesuites by way of insinuation got liberty of entercourse, from whom it should seem they haue learned to blesse themselues with the signe of the crosse, against the assaults &amp; temptations of the Dinell, whom they much adore in these parts, &amp; for feare of mischeefe, pacifie with sacrifice and presents, which makes mee remember a reasonable honest man of my acquaintance, who hauing two suspicious friends of contrary demeanours,

and demanded why hee obserued one before another; answered thus politikely: that the one was honest of inclination, and would doe him good for vertues sake, or at least no hurt: but the other was more pestilent and dangerous, and therefore must be diuerted by flattery and insinuation from the ill he might prosecute, or intend against him.
                        The better sort (notwithstanding these affrightings of the Diuell) apprehend, that all things, both supernall and infernall, depend vpon the protection of a greater Influence, whom by the name of Sunne, Moone, and Stars they adore, allowing a duplicity of Priests, the one in a white habit, as sequestred with shauen crownes, like our cloistred Friers: the other in blacke with shag-haire and formidable aspect, going at randome, and frequenting more often their temples, which are very sumptuous and rich, both in cities and countries: these Priests are confederate with certaine women called witches, who doe make trauellers beleeue, they can sell them winde to saile from Iland to Iland, and bring them to certaine wagons for their land iourneyes ouer barren and sandy places, which shall haue sailes, &amp; be driuen to and fro with great swiftnesse: wherein as I will not betray my vnderstanding to any vaine and idle credulity, considering that God is the onely commander of his creatures: so must I yeeld to this probability, that by reason of the infinite number of Ilands, and the countrey lying open to the sea, the winde is euery way more forcible then in other places, and by reason of mountanous blustrings, and pressing the aire into straights, seemeth to fight one with another, and at one time to blow with sundry diuisions.
                        Concerning other particulars of their wiues and concubines,

of their wealth and iewels, of their odours and perfumes, of their wines &amp; syrups, there is no offending chaste eares with their incredible customes: so vilde and filthy is their idolatry, so obscene and shamelesse their liues, so ridiculous their incantations, so exorbitant their presenting of virgins to be deflowred of Idols, so abominable their exorcismes, and so odious their sencelesse profanation, with lamentable obstinacy not to be diuerted: I will therefore leaue them to the supreame Iudge, and returne to England with this caution, that the foole hath sayd in his heart there is no God, and I hope wee attend these discoueries with feare or contempt.

much as may bee. They loue and reuerence their Kings, (amongst whom the great Mogull, hauing vs in some estimation before other Princes of Europe, and with whom we haue a kinde of correspondency, as by reciprocall letters may appeare, is principall and of greatest reputation) making holy-day when hee shaueth his head, and attending his chariot with pompous brauery, spredding the way where he must passe, with costly ornaments and delicate perfumes. For hee is carried in great pomp on the shoulders of men, adorned with purple, golde, and precious stones, the chaire hanging with orient pearle, and all thing so ordered, as if the best of our ceremonies should adde an honor to Maiesty. His Guards for his person are many and the best of his souldiers, who suffer no neerer approaches to his stately throne, then hee himselfe shall command, which is publikely knowen by the disrobing of his head of common ornaments, and inuesting himselfe with a magnificent Diadem, then are Embassadors admitted, and diuers lawes enacted for the good of the people.
                        Another booke will discouer, that when hee disposeth himselfe to pleasure, his concubines are sent for to be partakers of the hunting, and then in open view the beasts are killed, being chased before hand into certaine straight enclosures for the purpose: but if he determine a longer progresse, their chariots are drawne with Elephants, and their Diuers authours write of India, and would include China as one Countrey honourable Queenes left at home: but the wantons are enstructed to make proud incontinency swell with variety, not accustoming their wiues to be partaker of such lasciuious changes, but reseruing them for necessity of children, or moderation of contentment: when he determineth to sleepe, or peraduenture is ouerloded with wine, that he must resettle his spirits and senses with rest and

ease, the loueliest dames bring him to bed, singing a song of inuocation to the God of silence, and the night.
                        Another will relate, how worthily their honest matrons liue after they haue had children, how euer they yeelde their chastities at the first to their louers for the price of an Elephant, which yet neuer exciteth any exprobation against them. In some places, when a virgin desireth marriage, her parents bring her to publike view amongst a number of young men, where shee electeth whom shee fancieth. In their mutuall commerces they hate vsury, disclaime iniustice, denie indentures of couenant, contracts of writing, and haue many seeming excellencies of loue, confidence, and trusting one another: onely they are impatient of wrong, and thinke it a glory to take reuenge, but will not offer the occasion.
                        Another will tell you, that they once esteemed two sorts of wisemen, by the names of Samaraei and Brachamanes, both which were charactered for Gymnosophists: but the Samaraei for their precisenesse were better esteemed of the Kings; for liuing more moderate then the rest, as eating neither fish nor flesh, it added to their reputation, that the peace of their Kingdomes was established by their orizons, and the prosperity of the countrey confirmed through their holinesse.
                        Another will demonstrate, how St. Thomas conuerted them to Christianity, how euer with the Syrians in Samaria, they haue since intermingled horrible idolatry, and vntill the Portugals came amongst them, would scarse reforme the most grossest abuses.
                        Another will enlarge the conquest of their countrey by the Portugals and Spanyard, with a full description of all things, which may shew you the perfect portraiture of

their kingdomes, courts, common-wealth, riches, pleasures, ciuill administration, and mightinesse: yet (as I take it) so farre from a conquest, as wee were ouer France, when we had only Callis in Picardy, or Turwin and Tornay, which cost more the re-edifying, then all the country about it was worth. Heere you shall also finde how they haue striued with the Aegyptians for antiquity and cunning, how many Ilands are subiected vnto them, amongst whom Summatra, in times past called Taprobana, mustreth the power of eight Kings. Iapan affoordeth our English a harbour; and at Bantam they receiue the commodities of China from the Indian Marchants, who are only admitted to commerce amongst them: and diuers others, as are therein variated with many particulars.
                        To conclude no one Countrey comes neere it for greatnesse, 
                              India now intermingled with Christians. which without other addition lifteth vp her title alone, as challenging all the territories betweene China and Persia; yea in times past China it selfe, almost 1200. English mile, and amongst many Kings, hee is principall, that obtaineth by force or popularity. But of late they haue ouer-exalted the high Priest called Voo, who in spirituall matters (as I may say) hath absolute power and authority, and vpon whose blessing or cursing dependeth the expectation of future happinesse. Yet hath this idolatrous superstition acknowledgement of a God, whom they inuest with a triple crowne, not yeelding any reason for the same, but that he commandeth Heauen, Earth, and Hell. The Iesuites haue taught them to baptize infants in some places, and to fast, wherein they are now tedious obseruants (as barbarous people are best maintainers of customes and ceremonies) and they vse the signe of the crosse, but it is where they are enforced by the Spanish garisons,

otherwise, what I spake before of China: for all their silkes, clothes of gold, delicate beds, houses of canes, Serpents, Elephants, precious stones, minerals, pearles, perfumes, drugs, spice, sweet wood, barkes of trees, shels, nuts, and other things of estimation, I may with a Christinn-like sorrow amplifie, concerning their turpitude and morosity. As for their cities, euery one would affoord a story, and I am vnwilling to runne into the errour of fiction or miracle, considering your best Cosmographers haue onely extended the relations of others, and besides the variety of contradicting one another, would now be amazed to see so bewtifull a face of many countries, which they left most glorious, so deformed: and so vnpleasant a countenance, as they imagined, so illustrious and exalted.
                        And thus much for that part of Asia, who are all Idolaters, barbarous, inhumane, treacherous, haters of strangers, and so remote from the happinesse I would relie vpon, as my ioy exceedeth for not being a natiue amongst them.

This Sophy from the bloud and consanguinity of Alis Muamedes in the right of his wife Musa, Cusinus challenged the Empire, and lifted vp the armes of a mightie power to ouer-awe the turbulent spirits almost left breathlesse by a long and tedious dissention, (for at that time the Calipha of Babylon was extirped, and new authority with new names, obscured the first originall of the Persian greatnesse, and quickly altered both the Princes and people, teaching them other customes euen in ciuill and mutuall conuersation, with the well entertained religion.) But Hosenus the sonne of Alis stomaching his Vnkle Sophies proceedings, as hauing twelue sonnes of sufficient hope, like a Hieroglyphicall resemblance of a sheaue of arrowes bound together in one quiuer, proclaimed his right to the Persian Cidaris, and well conceiued opinion of his interpretation of the Alcaron, at such time as the Turke, assisted by the Tartars, aduanced a standard of opposition, publishing, that whosoeuer affected their enlarging of these religious secrets should weare a Tiara on his head of purple with a Tulliuant: wherupon both Turkes, and Persians in infinite numbers bandied seuerall parties, vntill at last great armies tooke vpon them the deciding of these controuersies, and by many auxiliary forces both of the Northren regions, and all the Arabians, filled the fields of Asia with tormenting The Persians a

For this Secaider attempted the conquest of Georgia and Mengrelia on the West of the Caspian, who being Christians according to the superstition of the Greeke Church, submitted to certaine conditions, as tolleration of religion, paying tribute, and disclaiming to assist the Turke against them: whereby they obtained a kinde of peace and protraction, vntill againe the Persians declined in their fortunes, and could not preuent the forwardnesse of the O

they giue life vnto by solemnizing of feasts, whereat their noble wiues may meet, except when they are heated to lasciuiousnesse, then are they sent away, and concubines inuited to make wantonnesse the fuller, to which they come by degrees, beginning with a modest shamefastnesse, but more bold, at last set open all the doores of petulant and luxurious variety: nor are they ashamed to produce instances of Darius banquetting in Susa 180. dayes, with all his Princes: of Baltashars solemnities, when the cups of of gold were filled, and the beds of iuory spred: of Alexanders the Conqueror, imitating the Persian brauery, and reiecting the barren and shuffling customes of the Grecians, and diuers others, whose inuentions and customes are remembred to set on flame the already burning fire of their voluptuousnesse. The Turke contemneth such formality in condition: yet is more curious in apparrell; for his Turban is delicately plighted, and when it raines, hath a hood to couer it, his vpper gowne is cleane brusht, his mustacho carefully preserued, his beard the grace of his countenance, and many other delicacies maintained, while hee is resident in corrupted cities, seeming more solid, tyrannous, warlike, and knoweth nothing but obedience, as coniured to raise vp all the trophees of his endeauours to the glory of Othoman: yea, in his matters of incontinency, he runneth also a strange race, with a more impudent violence then the Persian, as if the Satyre were exemplined: Dum vitant stulti vitia, in contraria currunt: and both from that horrible corruption of the Grecians, haue admitted the defiling of males, and the better sort do both geld and keepe Eunuchs, and other to the same purpose. The Persian loueth learning, painting, exercises, and many generous qualities. The Turke scorneth any language

but his owne, supposing him a right Politician, who speaketh or learneth his, careth for no quality, but riding, shooting, and playing at chesse, contemneth many superfluous customes of Europe, and hath in derision, yea in malicious contempt all the ceremonies of the Westerne Churches, by reason of their images, and foolish prophaning of God through idolatry. Thus then from India to Arabia East &amp; West, and from the Caspian to the Persian Gulph (where the great Euphrates emptieth his streams, and vnder whose shores is that famous Ormus scited, where they fish for pearle, and trauell six weekes together, from Damascus and Cairo to the same, with 6. or 700, cammels and asses in a company, to carry their prouision, for feare of the theeues of Arabia) preuaileth this Emperour, possessing withall diuers cities on this side Ganges, as intermingled with the Portugals: so that in India at this instant you haue many ports and harbours of fortification lying intricately diuiuided betweene Turkes, Persians, Spanyards, and the Indians themselues.

thus farre, that for wealth, territories, and command of souldiers, all other Princes come short of him, and are terrified, when he is at peace with the Persian, and vniteth his Armie against the ill-agreeing Princes of Christendome: But if you please, you shall thus expose the contention to your owne arbitrament.
                        For countries: He possesseth Asia minor, now Natolia 
                           Countries. or Anatolia, of the Greeke word signifying East, with all the Regions within the Propontis, and Hellespont, and such places as in times past made the Crownes of Kings to shine with gold and pearle, aduancing their chaires to the establishment of the highest Maiestie, as Phrigia, Galatia, Bithinia, Pontus, Lidia, Caria, Paphlagonia, Licia, Magnesia, Capadocia, and Comagena: then neere the Caspian now Hircanian Sea, Georgia, Mengrelia, Armenia, all Christians of the Greeke Church: To which if you adde the Empire of Trebisond, you shall then finde him the great controller of the blacke Sea: For although Russia, Bogdonia, Muldauia, and some Polanders keepe the north and west shores; yet is it as a man, which hath notice of a theeues comming to rob him, and dareth not slacke his guards, lest hee be surprized vnawares. Next doth the pride of his greatnes send you into Assiria, Siria, Palestina, Mesopotamia, Iudea, some torne away peeces of Persia, especially the oppulent Townes of Tauris and Babylon, the three Arabia's, and the red Sea. Thirdly, if you will walke into Affricke, he can inuite you to the pleasures and plenty of Aegipt, the fertilitie of Nilus, and all the shores of the middle land Sea, as farre as the confederation of Morocco, Barbary, and Fess: Nor desisteth he so, but in the fourth place from the top of Alexandria hee biddeth you looke as farre Northward as you can, and all the Ilands in the arches,

except Candy, and some few circumspecting the couchent lyon of Venice, acknowledge him for soueraigne Lord, and King. Fiftly, the fields of Greece lye walle, and are ashamed to lift vp their deformed countenances, and worne-out necks with the yron coller of seruitude and bondage, considering that in times past Thracia, Macedonia, Thessalia, Epyrus, and Pelopenesus set both Philosophers and Poets on worke to sing out encomions of their delightsome magnificence, and pleasures of loue; all which is now forgotten, as if the swet of a brow were wiped away with a cloth. Last of all, his Bashawes will bring you to Buda &amp; Belgrade, and affright you with a relation of Hungaries troubles, assuring you, that it knoweth not her first parents, but calleth the Turke a conqueror in many things. Yea the Princes of Poland, Transiluania, Sclauonia, and others, with whom he hath contracted a pacification, are yet vncertaine of his dammings in, and haue a fearefull care, lest he should breake downe his enclosures, and like an invndation indeed burst vpon them vnawares.
                        His principall Cities are Trebisond, Amasia, Babylon: or if you will but the ruines of confusion: Tauris gotten Cities. from Persia: Mecha famous for the historie and buriall of Mahomet: Gran Cairo in times past Memphis, of late new Babylon, exposing the ostentous workes of the Pyramides: but now you can wonder at nothing, but heat, dust, sluttishnes, and the mortalitie of a 100000 in a yeare, when the pestilence rageth amongst them: Alexandria boasting of her Founder, and that shee is the porter to let you enter the dores of Nilus: Algier lifting vp the head of a strong Castle, and daring to publish, how the Emperor Charles the fift lost his Nauie before her: and Tunis the Port of old Carthage, and now refuge of all the English

Pirates: Shall I come backe againe and tell you of Ierusalem, Tyrus, and Sidon? alas, they are but names, and all the plagues denounced by the Prophets haue broken their bones in sunder, and bruised them like a rod of iron: Aleppo, which would faine be old Antioch, yea dare from the mouth of some Authors publish, the antiquities of Niniuie: The seuen Churches of Asia renowned for former election, and former desolation according to the prophesie of the Euangelist for the remouing of the candlesticke: Rhodes mourning for the pulling in peeces the Colossus of brasse, which named the whole Iland Collocenses, and loaded 700 Cammels after he departed from the siege: Nicosia, Paphos, and Famagosta, all Cities of Ciprus, and almost fretted a peeces to thinke, that the Venetians lost them so carelesly, and vnfortunately: The few Cities left of Europe: the poore harbours of Asia minor: the port townes of the Ilands: the two castles of the Hellespont, reducing to your memorie the misfortunes of Hero and Leander, whom the townes of Cestos and Abidos bewailed, &amp; the principall place of all his reziance Constantinople, called Stanbole, or the Beautifull; and extraordinarily graced with the denomination and conueniencie of the sacra porta.
                        
                        His riches consist in commanding the lands, bodies, Riches. and liues of all his subiects: For first his owne nation called the Musselman laboureth in all businesse to increase his treasurie, and pay him an yeerely entrado: the countryman is a drudge, and tilleth the ground to maintaine his officers, who distribute to the people, as he appointeth: the Christians maintaine his Sansacks, and Timatriots; and all his Ianisaries and souldiers being the sonnes of Christians are payed, and haue their salary from

his Exchequer and treasurie: the Merchant bringeth him gold from all the world, and filleth his Harbours with such commodities, as the earth affordeth, and the Iew supplieth his wants in such a manner, that he neither lacketh pearles, diamonds, and pretious stones, nor any thing which the earth affords to fringe the skirts of Maiestie with extraordinary pompe and brauery. But if you will aske me in what manner Fortune attended thus to apparell, and set him on the stage of such magnificence, as neuer Emperor, or Monarch could dreame on before; with all their tyrannous inventions besides? I will thus redact some occurrences of former times to helpe your memory.
                        
                           The storie of the OTHOMANS.
                           
                           ABout the yeere of Grace 1300. to our greater disgrace, His Conquests. did Othomanus the sonne of Lichis step before other families, as if he were adopted the darling of successe, and in his fathers behalfe obteined iurisdiction ouer Bithinia, Cappadocia, and most part of Pontus. His successor Orchanes conquered the great Citie of Prusia, and made it the Citie of his Kingdome, and seat of his inheritance: but in the 22 yeare of his progresse he was killed by the Tartars, and left his sonne Amurah to succeed both in his honor and familie; who perceiuing the dissention of the Greekes, and diuision of the Empire against the remainder of the Romans, spent not the aduantage which he tooke at the same, without a great satisfaction. For with the water that draue the mill he drowned it, and inuited as a guest to this banquet of combats became master of the feast; or rather resembled the viper, which

destroyed the mother that brought it forth: so he admitted as auxiliary for another, at last made a conquest for himselfe, of Gallipolis, Chersonesus, Peloponesus, Philipopolis, Hadrinopolis, Seruia, Bulgaria, and Misia: But after 23. yeares convulsion of the Graecian glory, and his owne shouldring into the throng of magnificent renowne, he was stabd with a dagger, and so gaue way to his sonne Baiazet to fill the chaire of his imperiousnes: He began well, attaining Phocis, Macedonia, and most part of Thracia, had not fortune kept him a litle from insulting, and tript vp his heeles euen in the race of his triumph: For with the losse of 200000 Turkes against that valiant Tamberlaine, he also lost his freedome, and how he died, our stages haue instructed Mechanicall men: Yet did Calepinus his sonne in the meane while take vp the colours of defiance, and forbearing the reuenges of Asia, wrecked his anger on Sigismond of Europe, and determined to ouerrunne the other territories of Hungary, and the Empire; but prosperitie was not so attendant. For ere six yeeres had enlarged the branches of this strange spreading tree, the axe was put to the roote, and as in Daniels vision, Nabuchadnezar fell to the earth: but his stump sprung againe, and Mahomet his sonne in imitation of his fathers progresse, set forward his owne iourney, winning Walachia, Sclauonia, all the borders of the Ionian sea, and made Andrianopolis the store-house of his honour, wherein for 14 yeere he heaped vp such ornaments of Mars and Bellona, that he terrified the Emperor of Germanie, and all the confederate Princes of Italy. Presently followed Amurath the second, and filled vp his inventory with Epirus, Aetolia, Achaia, Boeotia, Attica, and Thessalonica: then subject to the Venetians, now Salenica, and the gulph

of Napoli, running vp by a corner of Nigropont, in times past Eubaea. Next him Mahomet the second ouerthrew the schooles of Athens, and on a fatall day, a day of punishment and terror, a day of iudgement and vnanswerable accounts, the 29 of May 1452. brought such a reckning before Constantinople, that shee forfeited her libertie, and was compelled to pay the amercement, nor had shee time with the politicke steward to alter the bills of the debters, whereby he prouided against future wants: But when Corinth, Lemnos, Meteline, Capha a towne belonging to the iurisdiction of Genoa, and many other Ilands vnderstood of her araignement, and perceiuing there was no contesting with this seuere iudge of assise, they tooke a course of prostitution, and yeelded both homage and fealtie; to which they were the rather induced, because Trebisond first led the way of expectation for mercy, and gaue him leaue to continue in pompe, and glorious estimation 32 yeeres. After him Baiazet the second obtained Naupact, Methon, and Diriachum from the Venetians; then went he to make a contract with fortune for the most part of Dalmatia, and thought to haue bargained for Austria: but it should seeme the conditions were very intricate, and something interposed it selfe. For an enuious hand poisned his body, as ambition had done his minde, which was imputed to his sonne Zelimus, who most vnnaturally made him away with excuse of Alexanders emulation against his father Philip, when he told him his enterprises were so great, that he would leaue him litle to doe: yet it fell out to them both otherwise. For Alexander set forward the conquest of Asia: and Zelimus of Affricke, vniting Cairo, Aegipt, Alexandria, and Damascus to the Empire. But now you must looke vpon the wanton

of fortune, euen Solyman the magnificent, who stepped backe againe into Europe, and reached at Belgrade, Buda, and Strigonium, with so forcible a strength, that he pulld them from the sides of a louing mother, and left the rest of Hungarie mourning at the cruelty: yet desisted he not so.

Thus was Amurah the third left the great Lord of Lords, ouerlooking the most part of Europe, the West of Asia, and the North of Africke, but more proud of the old Sinan, Bashaw, and the Cigalas: the one his Admirall at sea, the other Viceer of his army: then the conquest of any one Kingdome, because through their industry the honour of the Empire flourished, and yet he might follow his pleasures.

                           Amongst other entertainements, the Ambassadour Sr. Thomas Glouer had seuerall times inuited the Bashaw of Tunis, the Polish and Persian Ambassadours, from whom I receiued an extraordinary description of all the well-deseruing vertues of our noble Queene Elizabeth, as if that Maiesty alone had made all the East to wonder, who before were neuer mooued with any businesses of Europe, and with whom I went to Scideret a towne in Asia, iust ouer the sea, against the City, in whose fields about Iuly before, the great army of 200000. Turkes and Tartars were mustered: by the way in the midst of the sea standeth a watch-tower, as the guard of the passage into the blacke sea, which in truth is a riuer of great pleasure for twenty miles to the blacke tower, and Pompey's piller, adorned on each side of the banke with delicate

houses, wherein both Turkes and Greekes pastime themselues in their haruest and vintages, and sometimes retire in the raging of a plague, yet was I in the great City, when there died 80000. in fiue months: but of all other things suppose themselues graced, when the Gran Signieur will vouchsafe to visit them, and extend his pleasure amongst them: this tower is well guarded and erected, in such a fashion, that wee may dispute therof, if an Iland? how so small? and not washed in peeces with the violence of some tempest; if none? how was twenty fathom deepe raised to a foundation: within two mile more particularly called the vines of Pera, the Greekes for seuen or eight daies resort in famelies to their gardens, and solemnize their vintages with musike and dancing, and although the countrey seemeth stony and hot: yet vnder the skirt of the hils are mantling meddowes running in stripes, yeelding hay and pasture for their greater cattle. Beyond Constantinople Northward, are the Iewes licensed to bury their dead, and according to the greatnesse of the family and person, set vp tents of watchet and crimsen satten, and obserue a commendable order of mourning &amp; lamentation in their exequies. The riuer runneth into the sea by the vines of Pera: so that Galata neither standeth in Asia, nor is an Iland, but resembleth a spurre of fortification, and is ioyned to the Continent of Thrace with an Istmus: some fiueteene miles from the City, those stately aquae ductus, of which there be sixteene in seuerall places, which feede the cesternes of Constantinople, giue notice what men and money can doe. For being the workes of pleasure and ostentation, they are raised to a leuell from hill to hill, and the water comming from open springs, is as it were sent to be better secured within passages of stone, mounted vpon

                            haue maintained, how the originall of all Creatures first beganne in this Countrey, and would extend Paradice to

this place, when GOD caused Adam to name them: but these Philosophers not vnderstanding the truth, inuented what they listed to please themselues, as you may perceiue by Homers fictions: that they were the best obseruers of religious secrets, and ceremonies; and boasted of true deuotion to their gods for the example of all Nations: That they were very warlike, and obedient to their EMPEROR in all things, and so populous, that the Emperor seldome went without a 1000000. into the field: That they were sold to all the Nations of the world for slaues, and seemed contented with such seruitude, as being glad to go out of their owne Countries: That they were wont to plight their haire in knots, and winde it with intricate diuisions: That the great and high mountaines of the Moone ouerlooketh their territories, and vnburtheneth Nilus from her wombe, sending it abroad, as farre, as the middle-land sea 1500. mile, like a timely birth to the comfort of his mother, and with ioy to all good kinsfolk, &amp; neighbours: That the nature of the Riuer Niger fluuius is so strange, that as ashamed of his imperfections, and abrupt breakings out vnder sandy hills, it hideth his head 60. mile together, and then bursteth out with horrible and impetuous violence: That whole Countries haue beene ouerwhelmed with sand, when the hills make a noyse, and the Sun hath enflamed his heate, and anger against them, departing in that fury, that in breaking the sides of Mountaines the aire and winde maketh a rupture, and so the drie ground first parched presently crumbleth to pouder, and is quickly tossed with forcible blasts: That the Kingdomes of Damutego and Manuongo as farre as Caput bonaespei, with all the shore, Cities, and harbours, are numbred parcell of this Empire, and expose many stories and plentifull relations:

That infinite Ilands full of drugges, mineralls, gold, pretious stones, pearle, spice, &amp;c. are the handmaides of this Mistris, especially the great Iland of Saint Laurence in times past called Madagascar, which now compareth with Britaine for magnitude, as containing 600. mile in length, but say what deuises can, ours is the greatest Iland of the world. Many other particulars are inserted by Authors with addition of their manners, and customes: but because all absolute things are worne out of date, and that it would vex a Traueller to read one thing, and finde another, I will trouble antiquitie no longer, but content my selfe with some probabilities, and the best receiued opinions of this Monarchy.
                        You must then vnderstand, that those limited Garisons of Aegipt vnder the Turke, are here very strong to keepe backe the excursions of the Aethiopians, who from Nilus 
                           The conuersion of the Aethiopians. to the South-sea make one Countrey, and are all reputed Christians, boasting of their conuersion from Candauce the Queene in the Actes of the Apostles, whom by another name they call Iudith, and so afterward submitted to the obedience of one principall, to whom they afforded the significant title of Preste Iehan, not that he is a Byshop or Priest, as some superstitiously conceiue, but that those Prester Iehan no Priest. words signifie in the Aethiopian tongue Great PRINCE, or EMPEROR. Amongst them are many Monasteries both of men and women, but strictly prohibiting any entercourse betweene them, or wanton show of prophanation: their fasts are 50. daies with bread and water, and some slender fruit, as for fish they haue litle store, or lesse skill to take them, or make vse of them by way of sustenance: they are so carefull in the obseruation of their customes concerning this religious fasting and prayers, that

they will sleepe no longer, then they hold their heads ouer water, that the nodding downe may giue them warning to be more vigilant: their bells are of stone for the most part; their Priests marry, and celebrate the masse, allowing in their procession, crosses, censors, tapers, and lampes: the retired monkes maintaine their haire; the common Priests shaue, and both are b

The Sabbaoths and Eues are festiuals and celebrated accordingly; circumcision is added to their baptisme both in men and women, vnto which they are not admitted, vntill 40. daies, and then the three persons of the Trinity haue a reuerent exaltation, and the Eucharist is administred by custome at the same time according to the credit of the Greeke Church, which they resolutely confirme to haue priority before the Latine: their names are all significant, and the religion ariseth from a certaine booke, which they confidently maintaine was approued by the Synode of the Apostles, congregated at Ierusalem. The very common people haue plurality of wiues, according to their sufficient ability to support their estates, and content their desires, suffering diuorses either for naturall imperfections, or iust causes of incontinencie: but such men and women thus scandalized are debarred intermedling with spirituall matters; some say not admitted into the Church at all. Their Nobility are in great estimation, and according to actions correspondent to their professed vertue preserue the wealth, and credit of their Auncestors.

Their greatest Cities are few in number, but such as stand by the sea shore are of good strength and eminence with stupendous Castels and workes of antiquity. The common heape of houses are poore, sluttish, all on the ground open, without chimnies, and sutable to the dispersed manner of their villages. In all the Empire is no money, but pure gold: salt and pepper are excellent marchandize through Africke: but here so richly valued, that slaues are redeemed with them: but the commodities of the Countrey soone and easily exchanged, it affordeth many thing▪ as you haue heard, especially Eliphants, Tyger Linkes, Taxos, Apes, Lions, and Harts against an absolute opinion, that there was no Venison in Africke; but Beares, Cunnies, Corduels, and Cuckowes are not seene amongst them.

Their Cabalisticall Arts, and secrets from certaine wise men named Gymnosophists with the Indians, called also or some the Easterne Aethiopia, would make as tedious disputation, especially when I must name the Trogiodite, Garamaulis, Atlantides, Libera interior, Synega, the further plaines of Monte nigro, and some others, and cannot tell you, whether they be Idolaters, or no; onely I can assure you they allow of the immortality of the soule, on which they are besotted so diabolically, that they will murther

themselues vpon small enforcement, either to honor their lords, dye with their husbands, preuent the discommodities of old age, helpe their friends, or pleasure their best beloued after their barberous credulity: But because I would faine bring you into Europe, where my hope and purpose is to finde the happinesse of a kingdome, according to the reciprocall duties betweene Prince and Subiect, I will leaue these people to be reiected with Esau.

For all the Countrey is byting, sharpe, and in some places dangerous to the passengers, especially in winter, which here lasteth long: besides, it is full of woods, and desert places Northward, and they as full of wild beasts, noysome and vnsauory in their liues; but profitable and full of contentment after they be kild. For Beares, Martins,

Sables, blacke-foxes, Ermines, and some others fill the magnificent Courts of Europe with furres. Notwithstanding toward Poland there is great difference both of ground and aire, and in obseruing certaine customes against the intemperatenesse of the weather, there is reasonable suppliment of Natures allowance either concerning food or rayment. It boasteth of foure great Riuers, Olba, Volga, Duina, and Tanaies, sometimes taken one for another, and many times confounded, as if Olba and Tanaies were all one, sending foorth many brookes, like so many seruants of a thriuing Husbandman, and Housekeeper, who are orderly imployed about their busines for the credit and prosperity of the family. The Emperors progenie hath giuen way to diuers Histories, and is now so increased in wealth, mightinesse, estimation, command ouer his Subiects, and such other tumors of Maiestie; that many stratagems, and politicall deuices haue taught one another trickes to bring the proudest Monarch on his knees: whereby sometimes his will and imperiousnesse vpon the least iealosie of competition, or incroaching on the Diadem, hath beene mixed with a kinde of tyrannie, and the Subiects obedience resembled to slauish prostitution: so that in his chiefest and best ordered Townes of Nouagrade and Mosko, many strange and fearefull executions haue beene practised, and the Subiect enforced to wilfull murthering one another to satisfie the Emperors pleasure: as for his warres either forraine or domestique, how euer his many Countries, ostentous numbers of people, and seeming resolutions of the Souldiers, would giue an affrighting shadow from some portentous body▪ yet is he glad of auxiliary forces, and according to politike obseruations of such confused multitudes, must haue

                        But let vs returne to the best flourishes of his peace: whether it be a natiue pride, or ouer-growne custome with corrupted time, he is questionles a proud and stately Prince, and once nailed an Embassadors hat to his head, because he either abated him of that reuerence appropriate to so great a maiestie; or contested with him ouer peremptorily in behalfe of his master: but St

Their chiefest prayers consist on the faith of this breefe; Iesu thou sonne of God haue mercy vpon me: as for the Lords prayer they haue in small vse or forme, because the Scriptures are prohibited them, and not suffred to be published; yea the Priests themselues scarse haue the New Testament amongst them. At seuen yeere olde they are terrified with actuall sinnes, and so minister yong children the sacrament, mingling bread and wine together. The Festiuals they doe rather abuse, then celebrate, gurmondizing with that excesse, that it ouer-passeth the limits of neighbourhood, or friendly conuersation. The common people attend their labour, and are indeed the tired seruants of wearisomnes, rather comming neere the tediousnes of slauery, then the honest necessitie of husbandry.

prayers: No man giueth himselfe holy water, but attendeth the Priest; they haue many wiues, allow of diuorcement, and yet runne into the deceitfull by-waies of filthinesse and incontinency: so that as they count it no adultery, except Dauid lye with Bathsheba, when Vrias is liuing: so it is a dangerous matter to transgresse the law of wedlocke, and the woman is terribly ouer-watcht, and suspitiously restrained from walking abroad, wherein the condition of their reputed honest women is more miserable than in Italy, and a wife or a maide looseth all reputation, if shee goe at random, or sit by the high way, as Thamar did to deceiue Iuda.
                        
                        The people are naturally cunning and dangerous: yet as I said subiect to seruitude, and very slaues to the Emperor: their apparell is a long coat without plighting, almost after the manner of Hungarie, but indeed all the East generally yeeld no other: they weare coloured bootes comming no higher then their knees, the soles plated with yron; the better sort haue them gilded, painted, and embrodered: the women weare such too, and like the Turkes are not seene abroad bare-faced: all sorts loue iustice, or at least the shew of it. For they punish petty thefts, how euer great robberies and manslaughters, yea after due examination, passe without capitall execution, which makes me remember the answer of Cleonidas the Pirate to Alexander 
                           Alexander and Cleonidas. the Great, when he sharply reprehended him for the basenes of his life, and intimated besides the common scandall of a rouer, the mischiefes depending, as hindring the Merchant from filling the harbours, and resorting to the Cities, whereby the Kings customes were inlarged, and the Common-wealth enriched: Tis true O King saith he, because I rob with one or two ships, I am condemned

for a rouer: but thou that runnest ouer the Hellespont, and fillest great seas with thy Nauies art saluted a mighty Monarch, and reuerenced more for the feare of thy reuenge, then beloued by the extention of thy bounty or liberalitie.

of these countries, that when we come to compare England vnto them, we may finde them the sooner, and be able to iudge the better.
                        Thus liueth and raigneth this North-east Monarch, with reputation of one of the greatest sharers in the aduenture of the worlds happines: As for the other Kingdomes of Norway, Sweden, Goteland, &amp; Denmarke, with the prouinces of Bothnia, Finmarck, Lapland, Finland, and such Northren regions. like, they are onely called Reges simplices, because they liue and take care of their particular Scepters, without ambitious intrusion into anothers possession to make it their owne hereditary. For though sometime Sweden, and Norway is vnited: sometimes Denmarke triumphing, and sometimes as it were disioynted: yet hapneth it by seuerall factions amongst themselues and to reuenge iniuries for the present, and may resemble a throng and presse of people in a yard, who one while driue to that corner, another while shoue to this, and suddenly stand at a stay, as wearied with the shouldring. For as Princes are exasperated to displeasure by their owne conceiued opinions of a wrong and indignity: so doe they prosecute reuenges from a wrathfull indignation, and many times draw whole Armies into the field to stop further outrages, and shew the aduersarie, there is no end, but blood and death, yea the countries deuastation without an honorable agreement, or satisfaction: and thus haue these people vpon no other colour but wilfulnes weakned one another with counterchangeable preuailings: But yet I doe not see, that the Russian Emperor taketh aduantage of their disagreements, onely at this instant by reason of former troubles about the succession, and well-grounded suspition of the King of Polands warlike humors, he standeth on his

guard, and for some priuate respects hath bin auxiliary to the King of Swedea, to which belong so many particulars, that a whole history might fill your eares with pleasure and instances of worthy prosecution, which I desist from, for swelling the booke too bigg with so poore a breath of common and knowne relations, and will onely goe forward with some slender descriptions, as the country now lieth vnder fortunes controule.

(For Norway and Denmarke were but then characters of a new print) there hapned a confusion of blessednesse amongst these Nations. For considering, how hee was a Prince not onely of great setlednes and gouernment, but of peace and prosperity, his subiects likewise participated with the felicitie, and liued so long, and in such increase, that I must resemble them to certaine fish in the sea, amongst whom the great ones deuoure the small; yet not so fast, as they could preuent the sodaine approch of a strange famine, whereby the King and principall Counsellors of the State were as it were brought to behold the comming forward of their misery, in regard that many thousands must perish for lacke of foode, and such as had wherewithall to supply their wants, in danger of spoyling, by the indigent multitude tyed to tyrannous necessitie: wherevpon to preuent the worst, as they supposed, and from the law of nature of two euills to chuse the least, and of nations to rectifie the crooked lines of threatning destruction on them: it was concluded to disburden the Realme of all old, impotent, poore, and vnnecessary people, and when the manner was likewise demanded, the inventors were not ashamed to publish, that they must be tied backe to backe and throwne into the sea: with the iollity of which deuise euery man departed home, and the King himselfe, as glad, that his subiects were generally appeased, seemed

proud to be the reporter of the iudgement: But when the Queene vnderstood the cruelty of that doome, and from the tendernes of her sex began to compassionate the guiltles soules, she was not onely amazed to see such an error seduce the wisdome of Gouernors; but stepped a litle more forward, and in debating the matter, brought them to a hansommer path of preuention, which was by exile to expose them to the fortune of the world, and keep the conscience cleare from shedding innocent bloud, which no doubt in time would once lye heauy vpon the most obdurate heart.
                           Here reason and honest pitie wanne the field of former wilfulnes and resolution, and the Queene was not onely proclaimed the mother of charity, but applauded for her wisdome, and high exalted vertue: so they allowed her directions, and without further disputing the matter, shipped forth 300000 soules, who dispersed themselues ouer the North-east of Europe, filling those countries, which now are called Muldauia, Bogdonia, the borderers of the blacke sea, and Russia with new names and nations, such as were afterward distinguished by Samatae, Gothae, Longabardi, Hunni, Vandali, Getae, Swedi, and diuers others, who raised their fortunes out of industry, and made their able bodies the ministers of a great prosperitie: For when the Emperors of Constantinople groned vnder the burthen of diuision and dissention with the Princes of the West, and had no other way to pacifie the indignation, but by drawing maine Armies into the field; they were also compelled to entertaine these strong and barbarous people, as presidiary, and depending on their military salary: But they quickly instructed in the discipline of Armes, and as quickly furnished for any imployment, did as

quickly perceiue the weakned estate of both parties, and so vnderstanding their owne strength with tumultuous innouation kept the best countries of Italy to their owne vse, making the Graecian Emperors beleeue, it was in their behalfe, and for the renowne of the Empire; but when it came to the casting vp the account, they denied the debt, and by force of armes sent the Graecian auditors home vnsatisfied, and so fell againe and againe on the weakned forces of Europe, and at last possessed the diadems both of Lombardy and Spaine.

                        CHAP. VIII. The Empire of GERMANY.
                        
                           THE eighth prize out of this great lottery of The eighth part of the worlds brauery. the world, is proclaimed for the Emperor of Germany &amp; king of the Romans, to which the house of Austria is (as it should seeme, or at least would bee) enfeoffed. For at this houre, the sonnes of the olde Arch-Duke haue thus raised the throne of imperiousnesse: Rodulphus Emperour, yet famous for nothing but peaceable desires, and a priuate sequestration scarce affecting the defence of his owne territories, much lesse the expatiating of any military proiect against the enemy of Christendome. Matthias after much repining and a great expectation, King of Hungary, out of which hee hopeth (if occasion serue) to step into his brothers chaire, and command Europe, or at lest so much as the Pope and King of Spaine can support him in. Maximilian, Arch-Duke of Austria, and powerfull enough in being commander of Vienna, from whence the Turks with 200000. souldiers was valiantly repulsed. Albertus, first Arch-Bishop of Toledo, then Cardinall, next dispensed with, and married to the Infanta of Spaine his cozen german, and last of all Arch-Duke of Burgundy, and Commander of the Low-Countries, or at least so many as are brought so low, that hee standeth like a Colossus ouer them: and Ernestus called the Cardinall of Austria, but whether filius naturalis, or no, I dispute not on; so that if the father were now aliue, to see this bundle

of arrowes so well, so strong, and so gloriously bound together, he would flatter himselfe with an opinion, that the Emperials either would not, or durst not startle from their resolutions of corroborating the Diadem in his familie. But although the Germanes haue thus raised vp the principall tree, wherein the double neckt Eagle doth build her airy: yet is it farre from any royall florishing, or Monarchall supremacy. For neither is it hereditary, nor after inauguration can he commaund, as other Kings, or like the briefe of Samuels Oratory to the rebellious Israelites, shew the reciprocall duties betweene Prince and Subiect: but by no meanes is he powerfull enough to ouerthrow the priuiledges of the Empire, because the Princes be so many, so mighty, so beloued, that they attend in Court at pleasute, raise their forces at pleasure, contest with the Emperor in many cases at pleasure, and supply his wants and demands for impositions at pleasure. The Townes againe are so strong, so priuiledged, so populous, that out of obstinate finding fault with taxes and imperious restraints, they many times oppose against their principall lords, and in hostile manner exclude them from the benefit of commaunding, like royall Princes indeed, witnesse the many contentions of Colleine with the Noble men and Byshops, and at last with the Byshop and the people, the power of the DVKE of Saxony in maintaining of LVTHER against both Pope and Emperor: the repining of diuers Cities, and Princes, when the Lantsgraue of Hesse was imprisoned vnder Charles the 5. The last contention betweene the Duke of Brunswicke and the Citie, and the generall cause of the Protestants protected in euery place inuita fortuna, yea against Ecclesiasticall curses and temporall menaces.
                        
                           
Of all Europe it is the greatest Countrey with the best and richest store of Cities, Townes, Castels, and religious Germany the greatest Countrey of Europe. places, in that decorum, and order (for in a manner view one Towne and view all) as if there were a vniuersall consent to raise our admiration from their vniformity: To which is added a secret of Nature, that the people generally for honesty of conuersation, probity of manners, assurance of loyaltie, and confidence of disposition (setting apart their imperfect customes of drinking) exceede our beliefe, as being vnoffensiue, conuersable, maintainers of their honours, and families, wherein they step so farre, as if true Gentry were incorporate with them, and had his principall mansion in Germany. And although they repine at any strangers intrusion, and will not suffer new Nations to bring in new customes, no not artificers; and seeme withall fantastique in apparrell, and gaudy with deuises: yet doe they hate formalitie of Courtiers, and of all other things beware of that horrible deceit of vaparous Germanes haters of deceit. promises, common protestations, open embraces, palpable flattery, and hypocriticall bindings of obseruation from inferiours: when the heart is corrupted, yea ready to leape into his Masters mouth, and tell him, that he lies, when it heares him sweare, what he neuer meant: thus can they with Lucan exclaime:

                              Exeat aula
                              Qui vult esse pius, virtus &amp; summa potestas non coeunt.
                           
and thus doe they endeauour themselues in all honest courses to liue of themselues, which questionlesse proceedes from some worthy caution concerning their miserie, who eate meate vnder the repining eyes of another, and herein no doubt they lay a great imputation on many

English, whose profession of libertie by base and seruile attendancy is ouerthrowne: or if they seeme glorious in casting off the yoake of obedience; yet are they besmeered Errors of Courtiers. with the frothy corruptions of verball &amp; vaineglorious Courtiers, who haue with the viciousnesse of time so abused this profession of moralitie, that an honest and vnsubiected heart is afraid to come neere them. For although Liberalitie and Charity haue equall properties to the opening, if it were possible, the gates of heauen: although the fauour of Kings must be purchased by duty and obsequiousnesse, and although the maiestie of a Court must not be depressed by admitting euery man at pleasure: yet hath the errors of life so traduced worthy men for swelling too bigge with wealth and aduancement, that their power and authoritie growes tedious, and the depending on another is a very excruciation of minde, which made the Poet exclaime against the protraction of good deedes with Gratia ab officio, quod mora tardat, abest: which made the Italians murmure with Dono molto aspettato è venduto è non donato: which made Berzelay say vnto the King, I am old I will go a litle way ouer Iordan, but returne to my owne house, liue with my people, and be buried in the sepulchre of my fathers. In these things are the Germans worthy of all commendation: yet me thinkes wanting an hereditarie succession of Princes, and hauing an Emperor sometimes by partiality of election, sometimes by factious strength, and sometimes by the absolute commaund of the Pope, they should a little abate their ostentation concerning his MAIESTIE, or their owne glory. As for their formall custome of denominating all the sons of Arch-Dukes Dukes, Earles, &amp; Barons, according to their fathers titles, and paternall honours, it keepes corespondencie with the name of Caesar amongst them, and

the Italians hold it so ridiculous, that in their facetiae, as we terme it, they ieast it thus: The Earles of Germany; the Dons of Spaine; the Monsiers of France; the Byshoppes of Italy; the Knights of Naples; the Lardes of Scotland; the Hidalgos of Portugall; the Noblemen of Hungary; and the younger brethren of England make a very poore company.
                        But if you are curious indeed, and would search in natures storehouse for the furniture, that Germany holds, or know in what manner she distributeth her blessings, you shall finde corne, vines, riuers of fish, fruite, hot waters, bathes, minerals, mines of all sorts, and very good cattle.

If you descend to more moderate expectations, you shall then haue notice, how most men eate vnder their owne vines, how the Citizen liueth in quiet, how the women are blessed in their children, how faults are pardoned, scandals remooued, and euery man appeares like a faire shining Planet in his owne Orbe without disturbance.

For if a difference may tend to make a place the better, questionlesse Germany hath the preeminence; yet because it resembleth a Capitoll of so many Princes, rather then a Parliament house, where the Subiect how great soeuer, acknowledgeth his Monarch; we will allow him Emperor, as I haue said, for good manners sake; but questionlesse standing at the deuotion of his imperials, and Cities; it diminisheth his glory, and obscureth the shining of his three Crownes; witnes the busines of Colleine it selfe, which amongst many others of the same kind, is so subiected to the authority of the Byshop, that the name of Emperor hath sounded harshly to their obedience, and both people and Clergie haue still opposed against all secular Princes: the story is briefly thus.

                              , vntill againe the Pope wrested the supremacie ouer

the European Princes, and confirmed the Archbishops in the ostentation of a Count Palatine, and absolute power of the gouernment of all, which yet the secular Noble men not onely repined at, but sought by noble courses to preuent; and at last, when no deuise could make gentill the hard wound pullies of the Clergies ambition, they were resolute to effectuate it by force of armes, so that many contentions arose betweene the Byshoppe, Nobles, and Citizens, which ended not without effusion of blood, and ouerthrow of whole armies drawne into the field by particeans, whereby the Citie it selfe felt the smart of warlike scourges, and saw her walles and houses puld on heapes of rubbish, according to the nature of rage and fury the end of tumultuous vprors. But at last Colleine is reedified, and in despight of all frets and fumes, either of Saxony, the Palatine of the Empire, or confederates of the Princes, acknowledgeth the Archbishop for supreame Gouernour, and he still ouermantleth it with a superstitious protection, so that the people are kept vnder with his blessing and cursing accordingly.
                           It now bendeth like a bow, as you see our great Citie from Surreies side: the key before the wall is a place of great pleasure; the ports and ramparts worth the obseruing, the Palace stately and magnificent, the houses beautifull and comely, the streets sweet, spatious, and well ordered, the Inhabitants ciuill, sociable, and superstitious. For amongst the Churches they are of opinion, that the three Kings haue a memorable monument, concerning the birth of our Sauiour, when they were commaunded to returne another way home, but comming hether it was the fortune and glory of this place, not onely to be their refuge from the fury of Herod in their life; but a receptacle

for their bodies after death; but how the truth would proue all this ridiculous, it were pity to dispute. Howsoeuer, as I haue said, the Citie and territories now swell with the pride of exemption from the Emperors iurisdiction, and in the same race runne many other famous Townes, whereby you may see the disioynted gouernment of Germany, and the poore authority the Emperors haue ouer the Electors, and imperiall Cities.
                           For although Charles the 5. had the fortune to imprison the Lantsgraue of Hesse, and by the seruice of the Duke of Burbone to possesse the Castle of Saint Angelo, and punish the Pope with a terror of vsurpation, euen ouer his spirituall authoritie; yet was it a sudden greatnesse, and like the blaze of a bauin, lasted but a while. For the German Princes quickly repined, and the next Pope as quickly ratified his owne conditions, so that the Emperors since haue no more to doe in Italy, then a Pilgrimme, who is admitted to see the wonders of our Lady at Loretto. But if How Germany is neighbored. you would know, how Germany is neighboured, and beloued of strangers, I answer as if my friend should aske me my opinion concerning anothers loue: the heart is vnsearchable, we onely can discouer the outward countenance, and formall protestations: thus is it with Topographicall descriptions, wee can say these and these be the Countries and people, but whether enuious, ambitious, reuengefull, traiterous, cowardly, or such like, it must be referred to actions and time. Toward the North lies Pomerania, Prussia, Lithuania, Silesia, Podolia, and Poland; but Poland now stands for all, within these 300. yeeres a factious Dukedome, limited within her owne territories, now a well compacted kingdome of many Countries; yet wilfully resolute to haue no hereditary Prince amongst

them, whereby the supreame authority is subiect to the suffrages of men, and a manner of Oligarchy of Nobles limiteth the King in his royaltie, and maketh his establishment but a slauish brauery. The Countrey from her plaines, as spreading it selfe abroad without mountaines, or hills, addeth to the Etymologie of the word, and hath only the great Citie of Cracow vpon the Vistula meriting discourse, but litle commendation, or wonder. Toward the East lieth the noble Kingdome of Hungary; I call it noble, because whole volumes might be writ in relating her troubles; externall with her enemy of Christendome; internall with a confused dissention: For sometimes the glory of the Kingdome elateth them; sometimes priuate reuenges diuideth them; sometimes the Clergie doth tyrannize ouer them; and sometimes the generall cause exciteth compassion: then adioyneth what in times past you called Illiria now Transiluania and Sclauonia. Toward the South, but you must first see, what snow lieth vpon the Alpes all along the bankes of the Adriaticke sea, now Gulpho Venetiano, are spred abroad the Prouinces of Friaull in times past forum Iulij, Histria, Croatia, Dacia, Dalmatia, as farre as Ragusa once Epidaurus, all full of prety Townes, the shores beautified with Ilands, and the sea beating on diuers rockes seruing yet for many vses, as the Venetians can tell, who are the Commaunders of these people, and places for the most part. Toward the West, what wee now nicke-name the Wallons, Loraine with the memorable Towne of Mets, and in a prety corner Heluetia, containing the 13. Cantons of Switzerland euen amongst the Alpes, which remaine with freedome of both religions in despight of Pope and other turbulent Princes, and can shew Bazill, Bern, and Zuricke as fine and delicate Townes, as

any in the pride of Italy; but withall you must vnderstand, that both the Emperour, France, and Spaine haue diuers times attempted the subiection of these people, especially Geneua, which belongeth to Sauoy: yet failed, as the Romans did with the Parthians concluding a corroboration of friendshippe rather then a publication of their shame to be propulsed, which appeared in the time of Charles the fift, who was mightily incensed Fooles may giue good counsell. against them, had not the blunt reprehension of a foole diuerted him. For when diuers fiery spirits had brought fuell to set on flame these guiltlesse people, and that hee determined to ouerrunne them as it were with one speedinesse. I, I, saith the foole, you all conclude well for going into the Countrey, but vnacquainted with the terrible passages of the Alpes, you litle consider the difficultie of comming out againe. Vpon which pithy and compendious obiurgation, a new debatement of matters set vp another loome of retraction.

labour in the worke of the god of alteration, who pull'd this country from all Emperors and Kings, and made a fearefull diuision of the same, keeping themselues warme in Spaine, when all other countries failed: That long after Count Iulian began a new worke, as if he could haue powred downe vengeance on the author of his discontents. For after Rodrigo had rauished his daughter, hee called in the Mores a race of Mahumetans into Spaine to be reuenged on the King, by whose assistance he not onely banished the Gothes, and other people into Castile, but kill'd the King, vsurped the country, altred the gouernment, and so plaied their parts in Granado, Valentia, and Andolozia, as if they were created of purpose to shew some wonder of heauen, when dissolution of Kingdomes, and punishment of offences is determined: so that they quickly made their owne conditions, and bound the countrey euer since to the ratifying of them, infecting the best families of Spaine with paganisme, whereby our moderne Kings weeding them out by litle and litle, haue also attempted to purge their Churches of such filthines, and when they could not preuaile by precept, and authority of reason, they erected the office of Inquisition, to discouer who were addicted to the adoration of Mahomet,

                        Here is yet no great cause of amazement: For thus were the children of Israel persecuted by the Aegiptians, affrighted with the Philistims, maligned by the Edomites
                           
subiected and made slaues to Babylon, tormented and threatned by Syrians and Graecians, and at last not onely subdued, but subuerted by the Romans, who of all other, put the axe to the tree, and at one stroke laid the same on the ground, leauing the holy Citie desolate as a widow, cast out as an orphan, despised as a vagabond, and punished worse than a traiterous rebell, vntill the Mahumetans by way of curtesie ridd her of her paine at once, and vtterly trampled her to peeces: so that now to see the people dispersed without a law, common-wealth, or King: to view the countrey like a barren wildernes: to behold nothing but rapes and robberies, where so many promises had bin made from heauen, where such riches and maiestie flourished, where such mightines and state increased, and where all prosperity triumphed, would leniat an adamantine heart, and raise a crying voice from commiseration, with Heu cadit in quenquam tantum scelus? tanta iniquitas? And thus much for example concerning the seuerall alterations of Spaines gouernment, now to the rest of his ostentation.
                        The whole countrey retaineth still the antient diuision of Baeticam, Lusitaniam and Tarraconensem, and the memory of eight seuerall Kingdomes, 1. Gallicia, to which Asturia and Cantabria are connected: 2. Nauarra, the proper Eight kingdomes in Spaine. inheritance of the house of Burbon in France. 3. Castiles, a coople boasting both of antiquitie and excellency. 4. Lusitania, tother day Portugall, but now incorporated with the rest into the house of Austria. 5. Leon extinguished long since by the greater light of Arrogon. 6. Arrogon, laying claime to Naples and Ierusalem, and so enlarging the King of Spaines titles. 7. Valencia, mourning for her corruption in religion: and 8. Granado, to which Andolozia
                           
or the countrey of Vandalls, with the former Iland of Gades are vnited. Amongst these Portugall did once boast of the conquest of India, Aethiopia, Persia, and many other places, especially Taprabona, or the Iland of Saint Lawrence, betweene whom and Great Britaine (as I haue said before) at this instant of all the Ilands in the world is comparison for circuit, and spatiousnes of ground. But shall we let them goe on with these vaine-glorious titles of conquest and victory, when they are yet but poore possessors of some harbours and townes by the sea shore, and stand on their guard with more terror to lose, than euer they entertained comfort in getting them. I, I, let them alone a gods name: For quarrels arise from contradiction; and there is no disputing with men resolued in the vaine promises of worldly deceit; nor must you be incredulous, when a Portugall shall report, that these exploits were carried in the current of successe without the helpe of Spaine at all, as though there was euer a distinction, or rather separation betweene themselues, and a Castilian; yea they proceeded further, as if there were an Antipathy in nature: For they vsed to spit at the naming a Spaniard, like simple people in England after the Deuill was pronounced. But to the rest: if you would truely vnderstand the cause of his pride and former elation of countenance, you must then take notice, that he detaineth all these Kingdoms within his owne Continent, as a commanding Monarch, and after many convulsions begged at fortunes hands the ratification of the Royalty, stiling himselfe withall King of Naples, Sicilia, and Hierusalem: the two former gouerning by Viceroies, the latter claiming by inheritance, as vnwilling to lose himsele, or forget the glory of his auncestors, wherein he pleadeth imitation:

For the Emperor writeth King of the Romans, not once visiting of Italy: the Denmarke King of England, England of France, and France of Nauarre: then are the Ilands of Sardinia, Corsica, Maiorca, and Minorca entred his booke of accounts; to which if you adde the noble Duchie of Millane, into whose demeanor Count Fuentes looketh with prying eies for his behalfe, &amp; that the state of Genoa dependeth on his protection, you will say ambition set him well on worke, and as well rewarded him for his daies labour. As for the Low Countries, he would faine shew them as feathers belonging to his broken wings, and taketh the house of Burgundie for his owne, hoping that the Pope, which can canonize a Saint, will make the daughter of Spaine a Queene, especially of her owne inheritance.
                        Thus liueth and ruleth he in Europe: but all this were rather burthensome vnto him, considering the barren hills and sandy plaines of his countrey, if you looke not one way into the shores of Affricke, and another way ouer the bottomles Ocean, and so examine the cause of his boasting indeede, which is his store-houses of golden mines, his conquest of many nations, his reducing them America conquered. to Christianity, and his triumph in the fruition of possessed tranquillitie: For America is almost his owne, resembling a Peninsule, and ioyned in the midst with an Istmus. If you begin at the streights of Magellane, they will tell you, that Magellanus a Spaniard first explored the passage: If you aske, what was done a litle before, an answer is ready, that Americus Vesputius gaue name to this new world, and Christophorus Columbus of Genoa about a 130 yeeres since, searched her entrailes, discouered her maladies, and applied a Cataplasme to her most dangerous

wounds, which was irreligion and barbarous idolatry: For although he found vnlookt-for glorious Cities, and well compacted gouernments, yet was he faine by strong hand to ouerthrow their idols, and punish their obstinacy with cruelty. The south shore, or if you please the Continent on the left hand 10000 miles long called Psitacorum regio, is questionles inhabited, though vndiscouered, and not fully descried. The other Continent beyond the line inuites you to the view of strange nations, whom we confound with the generall horror of Cannibals, as men or rather monsters feeding on humane flesh, Giants: the land of Patagons, and Amazons, as supposed to flie hither, when the Kings of Europe repined to see women the equall sharers of honour amongst them: But for my owne part, I rather suppose it the error of ignorant Cosmographers, who when they cannot, or dare not certainly deliniate a countrey, then will they fill vp a place with monsters and formidable creatures both men &amp; women: Thus haue they done with the interior parts of Africke, and the remote countries of Mangia, and the inhabitants of Taunis, when God knowes all these places with the rest are possessed by men, and of orderly proportion, yea such men, that though they be idolaters, beleeue the immortality of the soule, and care not to dye in hope of a better life: therefore let the iudicious be perswaded, that what hath not voice and reason, is a beast or monster. From hence neerer the line or more northward looking from the streights of Magellane, you come into the golden kingdomes of Peru, Brazill, and Caribana, and may be pleased with the streames of two mighty riuers De la Plata, and Maragnon, which by computation maketh a winding of 5000 mile, and haue their shores stored with

Cities and inhabitants, of whom and which so many idle things are reported, that though I am not incredulous, as knowing, what barbarous nations can afford; yet doe I disclaime vnnecessary discourses, because I haue further busines in hand, and of better consequence. A litle more remote toward the West, beginneth the Istmus circumspected with the territories of Mexico, Cusco, and Themistian, with many other Cities of such wealth and mightines, that the people were slaine by thousands, or rather millions, ere they could sauour other obedience, than idolatrous and sauage liberty: On the other side toward the North looketh vp to heauen the new fashioned Ilands of Cuba, Hispaniola, S. Iohns, and many others: the further side of the land is as it were fringed with the countries of Virginia, Terra Florida, Noua Francia, Norrembega, and the fishing land; I call it fringed, because as yet we haue onely entred vpon the skirts of the same, not daring further exploration, and indeed not knowing what to doe with the rest, much desiring the discouery of the north-west passage into India, and resolued there is a way, if successe would lead vs by the hand to preuent the tediousnes and the charge of going about by the south Cape.
                        Here you see is great cause of triumph: For of all these he either challengeth the principality and confederation, or ouer-looketh with such ielous eyes, that they dare not start from his obedience; and would not so many kingdomes, so many nations, and such power elate any Prince to assume extraordinary titles? But (as I said) all this were vaporous smoake, and the frothy breath of opinion, if his treasuries at home were not yeerely supplied from the tribute of the Esterne &amp; Westerne mines abroad,

whereby he presumeth to yeeld more reason of his ostentation, than Salomon himselfe. For though Salomon did fetch gold from Ophir, and that the pride of Ierusalem swelled with plenty, when gold filled euery mans purse, and siluer was as common as stones: yet he made it a iourney of three yeeres, and had no other cunning, no The true Philosophers stone. other wisdome, no other Philosophers stone, than the industry of Merchants, and confederation of the Kings of Tyrus and Sidon: But the King of Spaine can make a yeerely returne, or at least once in 16 moneths, as vnderstanding himselfe thus farre, that his Cities of Toledo, Madrid, Valiodolid, Leon, Barcelona, Saragossa, Valentia, Cartagena, Malaga, Corduba, Seuilla, Lisbone, Baione, and the rest, cannot maintaine their glories without them: That the monastery and stately Palace of the Scurial could neither invite you to her magnificent structures, nor supply necessities of life with prouision: That the Garisons of Millane, Naples, Sicilia, the townes of Africke, the inheritance of Burgundy, his owne Castles and frontiers townes, with diuers other remote in many Prouinces, would quickly decay, and haue oftentimes mutined for want of money, and their ordinary entertainment: That the Ports and Harbours would be empty of shipping, yea the ships themselues vnbuilt and vnfurnished: that the countrey commodities might be vnuttered: his souldiers disappointed: his kingdomes many times famished, and his glory vtterly eclipsed, if there wanted but one returne of his treasure, or that any disastrous encounter defeated or disappointed his Nauy. And thus much for the seuerall principall Monarchs of the world, as at this howre they looke vp to heauen with ouer-liberall titles, and haue blowed opinion bigg with some seeming

reasons, and yet in comparison of true roialtie and happinesse, absolute partiality.

                           WHereas you partly heard, that the house of Austria obtaining the Empire euen Italy diuided. with the Popes grudging, did also intrude it selfe into the pleasant fields of Italy, whereby the King of Spaine would haue his head empaled indeed with one of the Imperiall Diademmes of the world: we will steppe thether, and see with what fashion her countenance is made cheerefull, and how her curtesie is prepared to entertaine vs. I will therefore desist from any former ampliation of absolute beginnings, least I should wrong the labours of ther men, and speake indeede their owne words more imperfectly, onely I must somewhat abstrusely and abstractly to helpe your memory with some things, that sauour of antiquity, and shall assist your comparatiue bringing them face to face in these moderne times. Vnderstand then, that it was the first Countrey inhabited of Europe by Ianus, or Iaphet the sonne of Noe, whose history giueth life to many strange and fabulous relations: How presently followed the possession of many Nations, whose loue to the Countrey changed her name into Oenotria, Ausonia, Hesperia, Saturnia, Italia; and some others of lesse consequence, some significantly according to the goodnes of the place,

some metonimically either pars pro toto, or totum pro parte; some ironically for idle actions, or Poeticall fictions, and some iudicially according to the vertue of the Inhabitants, excellency of the soile, or honour of the first explorator, or Redacter to gouernment, and thus it was suddenly diuided into Prouinces, as Liguria, Hetruria, Vmbria, 
                           Countries.

                        How Rome became the metropolitane Citie of Italy, 
                           Rome. and Queene of the world, so that the Emperors amplified the same with magnificent structures and monuments, and in diuiding, or rather translating their seates to Constantinople left all to the Exarchat of Rauenna, and vsurpation of Byshoppes; who by a higher stile at last made themselues Popes, and with the cuppe of abomination, like the whore in the Apocalips, poisoned the westerne Kingdomes.
                        How the Venetians beganne their Citie and State, and Venice. about anno 700. constituted a DVKE, boasting indeede that they were the poore remainder of the Roman Nobility, as it were sequestred into certaine remote Ilands, which the Goths respected not, nor Lombards regarded: yet hath Time you see raised a glorious flame from the poore dispersed imbers, almost extinguished, either from heate, or light.
                        How Millane was incorporated to a principalitie: First built by the Frence, after subuerted by the Vandalls, then Millane. reedified, next made a Duchy; fiftly, strengthned with the band of Sforza; sixtly, possessed by the French againe,

and now by the Spaniard.

                        How Papia or Pauy in times past Ticinum by reason of Pauy. the riuer, that runnes round about it, was vnited to the Duchy of Millane by Iohannes Galeazius the first Duke.

                        How Mirandula was fortified, besieged by the Emperor Mirandula.

                        How Ferrara was first subiect to the Byshoppe of Rauenna, then vnder the family of Est, made a Marquisate; Ferrara. lastly, a Dukedome, and now vsurped by the Pope, as part of Saint Peters patrimonie.
                        How Parma boasteth of antiquitie, suffered many concussions, Parma. fell into the blessing of the Clergy, and with the Coronet of a Duke was presented to Alexander Fernesius.

Of all which to discourse at large were another Gordion: and with the Preacher a man may cry out, all things are so hard to be knowen, that no creature can expresse them, the eye is not satisfied with sight, the eare not filled with hearing, the thing that hath beene, commeth to passe againe, and there is no new thing vnder the Sunne: and therefore I will desist from further tormenting my selfe or you, because many worthy authors are opposite to one another, in vnfolding the secrets of antiquity, and hee which striueth to please all readers

with satisfaction, must transforme himselfe into all shapes, especially with Ianus looke two contrary waies, and study the arts both of detracting and flattery: yet there is but one truth, if a man did liue in such a blessed age, that he might maintaine the same with worthy boldnesse, speaking what he thinkes, thinking what he knowes, and knowing nothing, but honest certainties: wherein not to be corrupted, is a glory exceeding report, and a worke of wonder indeed: therefore as neere as I can, I will reiect all impossible reports and authorities, and tie my selfe to probabilities and truth, or at least so much, as is either receiued for currant in iustifiable relations: or my poore experience dare warrant from mine owne endeauours: and so I will shew you with what face Italy lookes vp to heauen at this houre, and may with Heraclitus weepe for the vanities and miseries of the earth: yet is cheerefull, and thus like a strumpet is knowne by the pride of her eyes.

and Gallipolis. It hath many townes, but few cities: onely Brindisi, Ottonto, Barletto and Naples are of some account: the Countrey is rich in vines, oyle, and silke-wormes, the people are dangerous, superstitious, and the Villano liues beastly: the Gentle men are maintainers of liberty and pleasure, scoffers at their owne religion, and as great blasphemers as the Greekes of Cyprus, insomuch that I haue heard them in their rages cry out, Iddio Beco: Puttana del Di: and sweare by the absurd oath of potta del Cielo, as in their commedy called Ruffiana, and published in print, may appeare: yet is their adoration of her so superstitious, that the Sauiour of the world is accounted her inferiour, her attributes make heauen amazed, and her altars smoke with incense and prophanation. And what is this: but to cause the Prophets to exclaime against the sacrifices of the Queene of Heauen? and what is this, but with Ahaz to make images for Baalim, and burne children in the valley of Hinnon, after the abhomination of the heathen? and what is this? but to build high altars with Manasses, and like a Sorcerer, to regard the crying of birds, to vse enchauntments, &amp; giue way to the imposturing art of witchcraft. As for true religion, oh God! thou laughest them to scorne, as they haue the truth in derision, which makes me remember, what is reported in these parts of that worthy Sr. Philip Sidney, who conuersing with a Neapolitane Count, and brought to one of their Churches, wherein he was loth to enter at that time, was yet vnwilling altogether to distaste him, but interiected some excuses: but the Count vnderstanding him well enough, bad him tarrie a while, and so went into his formall deuotion, but quickly returning, embraced him with an oath, by his Santa Donna, that he would renounce all the religion of the world; yea,

his part of Paradice, before hee would trouble againe the conscience of so well deseruing a Gentle-man and companion. They liue in great pomp for outward shew, and make the City, both rich and stately, because they are not permitted to be resident in the Countrey, but keepe heere continuall entercourse, howeuer they groane vnder the Vice-Royes controll, and the ouerwatchings of two strong castles, which keepe both towne and harbour in awe: and although the Spanish pride, and sometimes cruelty, is exercised amongst them, as abating their natiue glory: yet doth it little abridge them of moderne pleasures and customary wantonnesse: so that if the Prophets in times past exclaimed against Tyrus and Sidon, threatned Damascus and Syria, prophesied the desolation of Aegypt and Aethiopia, lamented Iuda and Samaria, and mourned for Babylon and Assyria, they might now cry out against Italy and Naples, which as in times past was called Parthenope, of the Syrens haunting these shores, of the dangers of Scilla and Caribdis, and for the notorious transhaping men into monsters by Circes, allegorically alluding to the voluptuous sinnes, and abusiue pleasures of this City and Countrey: so still may it retaine the comparison, and men bee terrified with the same dangers. For if any place in the world keepes wickednesse warme, with glorious flames and stretcht-out sensuallity to the length and bredth: heere men are not only drunke with iniquity; but commit fornication with Idols; yea, are mad with the rage of impiety.

Cardinals, for want of lawfull succession; or else by reason of their weaknes, who peraduenture haue right, but are not able to contest with so irregular an aduersary, which makes them step a litle aside for feare of being trampled to peeces indeed. The chiefe Cities are Rome, Loretto, Rimano, Bologna, Ferrara, Vrbine, Perugia, Viterbium, Spoletto, Ancona, and Rauenna, all places of account, well fortified, adorned with palaces, replenished with inhabitants, and resort of Gentills both natiues and trauellers, and supplied with all manner of prouision both for necessitie and wantonnes. But Rome is the seat of the Pope, and keepeth the Priests to the duties of the Sanctuary: For the Colledge of Cardinals suffer no man to depresse the glory of the Church, and proclaimes him an heretike, that intermedleth with the ordinances of the great Bishop; so that according to their seuerall degrees religious persons liue in great st

with wine, they faile in prophesying, and stumble in iudgement, their tables are full of vomit and filthines, and no place is cleane: yea the vision of the Prophet is come vnto them, as the words of a booke which is sealed vp, which men deliuer to one that is learned, saying, read thou, and he replies, I cannot, for it is sealed; then it is deliuered to an ignorant with read thou, but his answer is, I am not learned: so that with the Apostle I may say, that Antichrist shall sit in the Temple of the Lord; and in the latter daies shall be the doctrine of deuils, forbidding to marry, and eat meat, which God hath sanctified: so that with the Euangelist I may lawfully tell you of the Vision of the beast, which rose out of the sea, hauing 7 heads and 10 hornes, and that he opened his mouth vnto blasphemy, resembled to the woman araied in purple and rose colour, decked with gold, pretious stones, and pearle, and holding a cup of gold in her hand full of abomination and filthines. The Citie yet is swelling bigger and bigger, though nothing comparable to the ostentation of former times: For Historiographers haue confirmed it for greatnes, riches, magnificence, Nobilitie, and famous illustrations the admiration of the world, as contayning 20 English mile in circuit, and shewing a countenance of brauery, and princely structures: But now it onely boasteth of some few ancient buildings, the ruines of the Amphitheater, certaine Obelisci, the swiftnes of Tiber, new erected Palaces of Cardinals, the Castle of St Angelo olim moles Adriani, the Popes owne Palace, and the Church of S. Peter, threatning to exceed with his high erected Cuba and wondrous crosse Iles, our London Cathedrall, which is the vastest heape of stones vnder the sunne: the aire is most pestilent, and vnwholesome, so that S

haue died in a yeere by infection, and the vninhabited places afford such damps and mists, that many times they effectuate suffocations, but are alwaies dangerous and patible of no remedy, but extraordinary fires.
                        The third part of Italy affordeth an honorable title to the Duke of Florence, who is stiled Magnus Dux Hetruriae, 
                           Florence. and registreth in his booke of renowne for principall Cities Florence, Pisa, Sienna, and Legorne a strong new hauen towne on the sea shore almost ouer against Corsica. The Citie it selfe is one of the stateliest and richest in Italy, the riuer Arnus runneth in the midst, playing the wanton vnder the arches of three delicate stone bridges: the Dona is a delicate and curious Church: the state-house, Dukes palace, and treasurie, with other Arsenals, and store-houses are to be made account of, as glorious spectacles, and worthy structures; but whereas you shall finde a booke of the wonders of the Citie, when you come to the substance from the shadow, it will proue either ridiculous, or not answering expectation. The Duke himselfe studieth nothing but wealth, for which he liueth both sparingly and basely, not caring by what meanes his yeerely entrado is augmented, taking the indirect profit of common Innes: He is of the family of Medices, and his subiects (if I may so terme them, which doe what they list) are fine speakers, but buggerers, and blasphemers.
                        The fourth roome of Italies palace is opened for the delicate state of Leuca, a Signiory and Citie of that riches, Leuca. and estimation, that in comparing it to so much ground againe, you shall easily finde the difference: For being not 20 mile square, yet can they muster 3000 horse, and 15000 foote: they make much silke, and are well conditioned Merchants: their chiefest Podesta or officer is called

                           Confaloniero, changed euery two moneths: his councell are of the chiefest Citizens, altred euery six moneths; they liue altogether for the time in one Palace: they haue had many Gouernors, but at the last the Cardinall (as you heard) purchased their manumition, and they as apprehensiue are resolued to maintaine their priuiledges.
                        The fift share is taken out of Italies lap by the Venetians, who boast of great antiquity, haue a Duke during life, Venice. chosen by the balls of the full Councell, who is at this instant a Donatus, and are proud of their great possessions, but might haue gloried, if they had not lost their first footing. Within the land they keepe close Forum Iulij or Friaull, with the territories of a large countrey round about Venice it selfe, which is called the impossible within the impossible, scited in the sea, and diuided into such channels, that you goe both by water and land to their houses, which indeed are hansomely contriued, and belonging to the Noblemen worthy the reputation of Palaces; yet are the streets so narrow, that they endure neither horse nor cart, neither doth their Gentlemen weare sword or cloake; nor is any fresh water, or good aire belonging to the same, more then what is brought them, or they reserue in pargetted cesternes, as in Zeland and Holland when it raineth. Padoa is their Vniuersitie, and a large towne, famous for Titus Liuius and Peter Auenons birth, who made the bathes vnder the mountaines some fiue mile beyond, where the vipers are taken; it retaineth a goodly monument of a Hall, keeps Antenors toombe in the streets, and dare tell you, that S. Lukes sepulchre is in the Church called the Santo: Palma is a fine towne, and strong in fortification: Verona a famous Citie, whither the Noblemen resort, who much stomach the Venetian
                           
gouernment: Vizenza is a delicate Academie, and hath a stately &amp; yet hansome theater: Crema a frontier towne, and well guarded: Vdine comely and conuenient enough after the Italian manner, and superstitious alike. Treuiso hath a faire Piazzo, and sheweth some wanton Curtezans: and Brescia, where the language is corrupt; for belike they haue beat out the finenes with hammering their armours. On the other side of the Adriaticke sea, they command the pleasant shores of Histria, Dacia, and Dalmatia almost as farre as Ragusa: a litle further in their owne Gulph, and amongst the musters of the Greeke Ilands, they protect Cephalonia, once Ithaca, or the countrey of Vlisses. Corfu, where the strong Castle is accounted a principall peece of workmanship: Xante, an Iland famous for the vallies yeelding 4000 tunne of Corans euery yeere: Zerigo, and many other Ilands, in euery one of which they haue for Gouernour one Prouisor, and two Conciliarij as assistant: they had also many other fortunes, but tempus edax rerum, and the Turkes greatnes hath almost broken the chaine of their prosperitie abroad in peeces: For they haue lost Rhodes, Ciprus, and some other commands; yet doe they keepe Candy in the Mediterranean sea, whose Gouernour is priuiledged with the title of DVKE, and hath potestatem vitae &amp; necis.
                        
                        
                           Modena is the sixt step of Italies glory, and an hereditary Dukedome, full of riches and fashionable Gentry, Modena. newly allied to Mantua, and reasonable well fortified against his dangerous neighbour in Millane: The country is very pleasant, and conducteth you to those plentifull water-pooles, called Lago de Garda, and Lago de Como; the first vnder the Venetian, the next belonging to the Cardinall

of Trento, and both very neere 50 Italian mile in length, and 30 in bredth.
                        On the seuenth degree of honors chaire, as he is mounted Mantua. in Italy, is Mantua placed, a new Dukedome of an old Marquisate, in the name of Gonzaga: He liueth in better fashion of Courtship than the other Princes, with a guard of Switzers; the Citie is large, boasteth of Virgils birth, the delicate streames of Po, ouer which for all the swiftnes and bredth, a gallery bridge transporteth both coach, cart, and horse, and vnder which are preserued many courtly barges both for magnificent showes, pleasure of the water in summer time, and necessitie of the inhabitants at all times.
                        The eight prize of Italies lottery is proclaimed for the Parma. Dukedome of Parma, connited to the house of Farnesius a Spaniard, and signorising ouer Macentia and Mirandula, not onely holdeth vp a stately countenance of three magnificent Cities, famous for many alterations, proud of well contriued ramparts, boasting of hansome women, and exposing an extraordinary profit from the vent of seuerall country merchandice; but openeth the plentifull fields of increase, and giueth cause of wonder for many temporary blessings.
                        The ninth proportion of this countries happinesse is distributed to the Duchie of Millan

vnder the burthen, but carrieth his load lightly, how euer his inward grones are breathed, and lifteth vp a face of cheerefulnes, as if he dranke wine, and fed on oyle indeed according to the properties of either.
                        On the tenth rondell of Italies ladder is Genoa mounted, a rich, proud, and sumptuous state; yet much perplexed Genoa. for their perfidious dealing with the French, and now depending on Spanish protection; hath a Duke by their constitution, and placed or displaced according to the mightinesse of factions, or fauour of the Clergy: The Citie hath many buildings of eminent sumptuousnes, and is not so filed in the rankes of reputation, but that they iest it thus with the aire birdlesse, the sea fishles, the mountaines woodles, the men respectles, and the women graceles.
                        On the eleuenth seate of this Countries Councellchamber hath residence the Prouince of Trent, famous Trent. for a Generall Councell, and lieth warme vnder the Alpes neighbouring Germany: you may passe to it through the famous lakes of Lombardy, De guarda, and De Como, from whence arise those swelling springs, that fill the streaming riuer of Padus, and strengthen the Citie like an Iland, except it be toward the West, where yet you shall behold a reasonable fortification, and a well murited wall with ramparts and rauelings: It is subiect to a Cardinall, who like a Count Palatine taketh all iurisdiction vpon him, and with the two mastring coorbes of the world praemium, and poena, gouerneth the sterne of this principalitie.
                        The twelfth place to make the iury the fuller, is assigned to Piemont, the flourishingst part of Sauoy, as opening the Piemont. gates of his chiefest palace, and Citie Turine, where a Citadell of Spanish Garisons taketh account of all passengers,

which come ouer the Alps; it sendeth the riuer of Po through the countrey as farre as Ferrara into the Venetian Gulph; and hauing many Knights of Malta within her walles is ready for their succour, which way soeuer it chance, and they againe for hers, as reciprocally depending vpon one another, and howeuer they are all ielous of the Spaniard, they yet dare not breath it aloud; but sure I am when I passed through Italy, and that the Cardinals Aldabrandino and Caesario came with a treaty to haue the Prince of Piemont and his brother vnder the King of Spaines protection, the Secretary was imprisoned by the Councell of State for vrging the matter in the King of Spaines behalfe: so that there is probable suspition, that the Sauoijen and Spaniard will not continue long friends for all their alliance: it receiueth the customes of Merchants trauelling ouer the Alpes, and maintaineth the office of Dacij, and could be contented to haue either Millane or Naples annexed to his Coronet. But if you will haue Sauoy flie with her owne wings, you must hearken a litle after some antiquitie.

                           Lions to Mount Sinese, the onely passage of the Alpes into Italy: It is called Sinese, quasi nunquam sine niue, neuer without snow, and is indeed a dangerous, tedious, and cold trauell euen in the midst of summer: but

                           Sauoy hath many other hills, as Aguabelle, and Agabellette, and is euery way full of strange and vneuen iournies, so that it shall not be amisse to deriue our discourse from the etymologie of the word, which may serue to confront ignorance, and enrich vs with the knowledge of things, which is no great burthen, but rather a happines, according to the Poet, Foelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas: You must then vnderstand, that this strange and vnsauoury nation, by reason of the streight and narrow waies to trauell in, was euer subiect to theeues, and being slenderly inhabited had not sufficiency to protect either themselues or passengers from the confused rages of men addicted to spoiles and murthers: wherevpon it continued in the name and scandall of Maluoy, the ill or mischeeuous way, vntill a worthy aduenturer of the countrey attempted a reformation, and shew'd these disordred people the strength of a more powerfull arme, preuailing so farre, that by his industry and fortune, these enormities were not onely purged, but the first causers remoued, I meane the robbers and theeues were either slaughtred outright, or publikely executed for a terrifying example, and as a reward to his vertues, the end of his labours had a quadruplicitie of blessings: First, the Emperor made him a DVKE, gaue him part of Italy called now Piemont, as if it would speake for it selfe, that it is a countrey at the foote of the mountaine, and inuested him with iura regalia, not to be accountable to any Prince for his actions within his owne territories. Secondly, the countrey it selfe changed her title from Maluoy into Sauoy, quasi salua via. Thirdly, these incredible mountaines erected houses, entertained husbandmen, and cattle, and builded Chappels, where a man would imagine an impossibilitie

of footing. Last of all, it was stored with forts and castles, in such a defensiue manner, that some of them at this day rancke themselues in the highest forme of bulwarkes and and ramparts. But I must not thus passe ouer their accounts, nor vilipend their glory. For they boast of antiquity of Kings, as that Hanibal found Brunco disseised of his inheritance by his yonger brother, and so rectified that discord. That Bitultus or Bituitus, another King, was taken prisoner by Q. Fabius Maximus, some 50. yeeres after Hanibals passage into Italy. And that Cotius raigned in the time of Augustus the Emperour, so that till the Goths and Vandals dissolued all gouernments of the West, these countries remained firme in their former renowne, as part of Gallia Cisalpina: but afterward mischeefe was added to mischeefe, till it was concluded otherwise by time and worthy endeauours, as you haue heard: whereupon Chambery was the cheefest towne on this side the Alps, scituated in a delicate rich valley, full of Gentle-mens houses, on the other side of the mountaine Agabella, ouer which the traueller spendeth commonly fiue or six hours: it hath a handsome castle now manned with Spanyards, in the behalfe of the Duke, the City is orderly ditcht and fortified, &amp; by the fauor of a pretty riuer, hath commodity of a reasonable water, otherwise it is snowy through the countrey, and the people are Strumosae, as in Switzerland. The suburbs are not fully recouered of her ruines, which they were subiect vnto in the yeere 1600. when the King of France, as stomaching the cunning violence of the Duke of Sauoy's detention, of the Marquisat of Salust, came to Grenoble by the marches, and after good surueigh besieged Chambery, lodging in the suburbs, and commanded Villeroy to parley with Iacob and the President Rochet, about the

surrendring the towne and castle, whom at last the people compelled to a composition, as finding it impossible to resist the French forces: thus within three dayes was the towne, and within six the castle surrendred, and Le Buise a Gentle-man of Daulphine left for Gouernour: but the successe of these actions was not comparable to the fortune of attaining mount Melian, and St. Katherines fort, two of the strongest holds that euer I saw. For mount Melian is Mount Melian. seated on the top of an high and rocky mountaine, the ditch bankes very steepe, and the defences consist of fiue great bastions flanked in most warlike manner, to which is but one passage, and that from the towne. The King (according to the condition of men) transported onely with outward shewes, sayd it was impregnable, but vnderstanding himselfe afterward a little better, commanded to besiege it: so the Marquis Rosny, great master of the artillery, drew vp seuen canons by the force of armes, and strength of men, and two batteries were made by De Bourdes, Lieutenant Generall of the artillery, against the bastions of Maiuosin and Bouillars, besides an old Tower, which had beene shaken by Francis the first.
                        The Fort was commanded by the Earle of Brindis, who had all prouision for his defence, and like one of Dauids Worthies, prooued an honourable Seruitor, had not the Duke failed, and brake his word, leauing him to such a fortune, as extremities accustome. For hee held it out foure months, after many thousand shot of fortie canons, whose voyces sounded out nothing, but terrour; and effects made way vnto feare and mistrust: and accordingly, seeing the French had too good footing to bee remooued, a composition was condescended vnto, and the castle surrendred.
                        
                           
The towne of Aguabelle is scituated at the foot of a great rocke, as if it lay asleepe in the lap of security. By it Aguabelle. runnes the riuer of Arck, it was surprized by the good endeauours of the Signeurs of Crequy and Morges, not giuing them of the castle any leasure to burne it. At the same time was Conflans commanding the passage of Tarentaies and Carboniers, with all the straights of Morien in the Kings hands: but if you would know what pleased him indeed, it was the braue surprizall of St. Katherines Fort, a gift as if fortune should open her lap, and bid him with cheerefulnesse be his owne caruer. For it is scited on a high hill within six mile of Geneua, and not onely ouerlookes the Countrey, but raiseth her rocky sides in such a manner, as if it cared neither for battery, nor bullet, but would return them backe againe, as you see a man spit against the winde to his owne defiling.
                        Concerning Geneua, by the water it seems impregnable, Geneua. as washed with the pleasant billowes of the lake Lemanus, and yet made vnaccessable, by reason of certaine marishes, ouer which neither horse nor cart can trauell: by the land it hath all the helps of art &amp; nature, yet not without danger of treason and stratagems: but that I am perswaded God hath reserued it, as little Zoar was a city of refuge, when all the cities of Sodome and Gomorrha were on a blaze round about it. So Sauoy, the King of Spaine, the Pope, and her owne treasons were all disappoynted, and it still remaines in the freedome of ablessed protection, boasting of nothing more, then her 300. yeeres continuance in an vniformity of religion, and that it retaineth the true method of the Primatiue Church. But to St. Katherines Fort againe. It consisteth of fiue bastions, which are not walled but ditcht. well furnished with artillery, and had 600. men

to defend it, who yet were in seuerall distractions, when they perceiued the confidence of the Kings army, not to take all that paines without further satisfaction; so they submitted to the clemency of Count Soysons, after the King was departed, to goe meet the Queene at Lyons, and thus were these impregnable places made the tennis-ball of fortune, and left vs this obseruation, that men, money, and endeauours, will ouercome all disasters, and make the very mountaines yeeld to heroike resolutions. This is that Fort, which was excepted in the composition between Sauoy and France. This is that Fort, that was to keepe the Countrey in obedience. This is that Fort, whose gouernment being denied to Duke Byron, startled his resolutions, and plunged him in the irrecouerable gulph of discontented treasons. The towne of Moriana is beautified with a Colledge, Monastery, and Churches, and tooke the first name, either because the people are swartish &amp; blacke; or the earth (like some places of Aethiopia) resembleth clots of pitch, and so indeede their swine are of the same colour. A little further lies Bramont, a city of that antiquity, that Caesar filleth some part of his Commentaries with her relations. The passages to all these places are somewhat fearefull to strangers. For to ride vnder, and behold such mighty mountaines and rockes, to see the snow dissolue and runne downe with that impetuous force, making such anfractus and ruptures, that diuers hundred mils are turned with the same, to heare the terrible noyse of the channell, whose foundation is huge stones disseuered from the hils: to see the pine trees stand vnder like a carpet, ready to receiue the falling of the snow, is a thing both of admiration and pleasure. But for mine owne part, it startled me not at all, in regard I had marched ouer some mountaines

and places in Ireland; especially Pen men mawre in Pen men mawre in Wales. 
                           Wales, which for the length of the passage, is the fearefullest that euer I saw, because the stony rocke hangeth ouer so many hundred fathome high, and the sea lieth vnder as great a depth: so that a quarter of a mile together, the way is not eight foot broad, and (as it were) patch vp in the broken places, with furrs and bauin, to keepe both horse and man from slipping. Besides, after a great frost you shall haue an hundred load of stones fall at once from the rocke into the sea, and almost batter the fence in peeces, which in the fearefull report, and sudden viewing by a new commer, must needs be troublesome, and indeed surmounteth any place of Sauoy, or the Alps.
                        Thus much for Sauoy, whose eldest sonne is now called Prince of Piemont, hauing his court a part from the Dukes palace, with a small guard of Switzers, and liueth in reasonable eminence, knowing his father to bee an absolute Prince, himselfe a nephew to Spaine, &amp; neerly allied to the house of Austria. As for the Dukes iealousie of the power of the Clergy, and the Spanish encroachments, I am resolued (like a smoothering fire) it will one day burst foorth into flames of despight, and did he not rather feare France, as a neere neighbour, and more dangerous aduersary, he would peraduenture attempt further into Italy, in despight of Spaines ouer-watching. But because it is a thanklesse labour to gleane the fields of other folkes haruest, and that you haue whole volumes of the Spanish, French, Low-Countries, Hungary, Venice, Portugall, and Turkish affaires, I will entermeddle no further: onely I must speake a little concerning Millane, and so leaue Italy betweene the straights of her owne pleasures at home, and suspicion of forraine intrusion abroad.

                           ABout the yeere 1492. the Realme of Naples reuolting, Rhene Duke of Loraine 
                           The occurrences of Millane. was sent for by the Pope to be inuested King, which was the first motiue for the French to be admitted into the attractiue delights of Italy. For when many hands had (as it were) torn a peeces the peace of this Countrey, it seemed a charitable and meritorious worke to contriue an establishment, and redacting it to vniformity, which the Controller of Kingdomes at that time, I meane the Pope, determined by this course, had not the very next yeere his minde receiued a further perturbation. For this Pope was a Spanyard, by the name of Roderick Borgia, or Alexander the sixt, whom the Venetians, and Duke of Millane beeing an vsurper at that time, established in the Papacy, because they might bee assisted from him in all their demands. Whereupon the Duke, by the name of Lodwick Sforza, and an vnkle, surprizeth the Cittadle of Millane, insinuated into the loue of the principall nobility, and confederated with many Princes of Italy, to corroborate his new gotten greatnesse. All this yet hindred not the next iourney of Charles the eighth, King of France, who now pretending a very right to Naples and Sicilia, with much adoe was incited to passe the Alps, and take his pleasure in these plenteous fields, in which, that his walkes might be the more smooth, hee condescended to certaine articles with this Vsurper

                           Lodwick, much about the time that Iohn the true Duke of Millane died, leauing behinde him one son and daughter, in whose minority Lodwick, as hee had before wrested the gouernment, now assumeth the title, had not his forwardnesse beene somewhat intercepted by this French visitation, whereupon he perswaded the Venetians, who of themselues were suspicious enough, when they saw the French Kings glorious entrance into Florence, to some interposition, and so both Millane and Venice grew iealous of King Charles his proceedings, which yet could not bee so cunningly trauersed, but hee was made acquainted with their vnconstancy, and held his peace till a fitter opportunity. For now he was to make his pompous entrance into Rome, where the wals both of the City, and the Castle St. Angelo fell downe miraculously before him. By which occasion, as if the sword of Iehu should kill the Priests of Baal, is prognosticated, that by the hand of France, the enormities of the Church, and the monstrous abuses of the Clergy, should be winnowed and throughly fanned: but it should seeme there was a tricke of preuention put vpon him, and the name of an Emperour taught him another way to acknowledge the Popes fauour. For 1495. about the 12. of May he enters Naples in an Imperiall habit, as Emperor of Constantinople, by the Popes grant and confirmation: but he had not possessed it fiue months, before there was a generall reuolt concluded against him, as at the same instant Millane had done with Lodwick: whereupon the King somewhat fearefull of an Italian receipt, or other strange surprizals, returnes the next yeere home againe, with purpose to renew the warre, and reintegrate his former losses: but the Cardinall of St. Malo hindred it at that instant, had not the Princes of Italy, perceiuing how the

                           Venctian and Millenois triumphed for the departure of the French, incensed the King againe to punish them both 1497. which was also interceded against by his brother the Duke of Orleance, who disclaimed in his owne name or person to disturb the peace of Millane: yet had not sufficient authority to diuert the Kings designes, and so the warres of Italy were renewed.
                        Now is Lodwick perplexed indeede, and compelled to prostrate himselfe before the Couchant Lyon of Venice, and lower then the same vseth so his submission, that the noble beast enclineth to succour him: yet in such a manner, as Israel assisted Iuda against Assyria, being fearefull of extirpation her selfe; but as soon as the publike enemy was departed, the emulation at one anothers greatnesse drew whole armies into the field: so playd Simeon, Eleazer and Ichoconon with the Romans, when their ciuill mutinies barracadoed the streets with heaps of slaughtered carkasses, and filled the channels with the spilt-out bloud of murthered men. For Millane is now iealous of Florence, Florence of Millane, both of Venice, Venice of both, and all three of the French: yet Charles goes on, and leauing garrison almost ouer all Italy, returnes home againe: but at his castle of Amboyse dies of an Apoplexy, 1498. after hee had vnfortunately strucke his head against a low doore, going to see a set at tennis. Lewis the 12. then succeeded, and not onely claimed the Dutchy of Millane, iure millitari, but takes vpon him the stile by right of succession, and a property of inheritance, as resolued to maintaine, what his father had gotten, and so gloriously purchased, to which he is adiuted by all the supportation, wherein Pope Alexander could animate him, who to raise vp his bastard sonne Caesar Borgia to a Princely throne in Italie,
                           
ioyneth with King Lewis in his enterprizes, and so contriueth the matter, that Millane mutinies against Lodwick Sforza, and submits vnto the French with Cremona and Genes.
                        
                        All this while is Lewis at Lyons: but who will not run to The

                              ssion of Millane. carry so great a King glad tydings; so that he is quickly aduertized of the fortunate proceedings of his army, and as quickly trauels ouer the Alps, beating the way of Mount Sinese, entring Millane in triumph, and left for Gouernour, Philip Lord of Rauestine, and Baptista Fregose his Lieutenant. The castle was yet protected with the guard of 3000. men, and committed to the loyalty of Bernardine of Corte borne in Pauia, who by his good beginning gaue life to their opinion, which supposed it impregnable, and not to be taken by force. But what men cannot in the Lyons, they compasse with the Foxes skin, and thus farre deride both the strength of souldiers, and pride of fortifications, that where the minde may be corrupted vpon any tearmes of disloyalty, neither wals, ramparts, nor manhood, can preuent the power and deceit of bribery. This appeared in the disposition or Bernardine, and Philip of Fresques; whom the cunning of Triuulce, and the disbursing 20000. crownes, quickly diuerted from their first resolutions, and made a breach in the Citadle without mine or battery.
                        Thus was the French possessed of this Duchy without competition, or diffidence, and Lewis the 12 made his royall entry accordingly. But marke the vicissitude of all things, Millane reuolts againe, and Sforza recouers all as easily, as he lost it, in which busines the Swisses proued very disloyall to the French, and the lookers on were amazed to behold fortune proud of inconstancy, so that

this vse may be raised thereby: How euer men satisfie ambition for the time, yet are they certaine of nothing vnder the sunne. Againe, when by indirect courses designes are concluded, they must stand the better on their guard, and prepare their patience when any alteration startleth resolution: thus fared it with Millane againe. For as you see a glooing heat in Aprill changed on the sodaine to bitter blasts and cloudy tempests, so was Sforzas iollity reuersed, himselfe surprized, taken and caried prisoner to Lions, where denied the benefit of a princely execution, and resolued nothing can be so acceptable to a man in misery, as a noble death, worthy the name of a Romane, hee dies at once, whether for griefe, or great heart, it matters not: yet doth the King of France pardon Millane, and at last keeps all in quiet. But the warres of Naples are renewed 1501. and the kingdome is diuided betweene France and Aragon, so that great alteration happens in Italy, and within two yeeres there is a generall ouerthrow of the French with the taking of the Castle at Naples by the Spaniard: yet is not Beniamin discomfited, but calleth his brethren together, and with more setled courages reintegrate their estates, and so the French make head againe, attending the good hower of a better prosperity.
                        About this time in August died Pope Alexander the sixt of poyson, which he had prepared for the Cardinals: but his taster by mistaking the flagons tooke away both his life, and the pride of his expectation concerning Caesar Borgias glory, or his further desires to set the fuell of Italy on a blaze: After him to stint the strife of many Nations expecting the Papacie, old Francis Piccolamini Cardinall of Sienna was chosen Pope, by the name of Pius the

third, in memory of Pius the second his Vnkle, who made him Cardinall: but a yong man must prepare himselfe to dye, and an old man cannot liue long: so he continues scarce a moneth, leauing his roome, and the glory of all Rome to the Cardinall of S. Pierre, who was made Pope by the name of Iulius the second 1504. in which yeere Naples wrested her head out of the French coller, and seemed more glad to be supported by Arragon: nor was this sufficient, but vpon a supposition to extinguish the light of the lamps of France in Italy, a new league 1511. was corroborated by the vnstedfast Italians against the French, which when the King perceiued, and that he coniectured, how his barke must bee driuen to dangerous streits by the vncertaine windes of alteration, he transported his Court and Councell from Florence to Millane, and from Millane to Lions, determining to weary them with tedious iournies and attendance, so is Italy perplexed, and the Nobles repine without remedy; till at last the Emperor Maximilian spreadeth the wings of the Aegle, and clocketh the Princes of Italy vnder her sides: whereupon with the help of the Spaniard called the holy league, warre is made against Lewis, and the Duchy of Millane recouered againe to the vse of Maximilian Sforza grandchilde to Lodwick, who was inuested Duke by the Cardinall of Sion about the end of December, yet by the Swizzes assistance, and loyalty, the Castles of Millane and Cremona hold still for the French; and the imbers are not so extinguished, but fire appeares, and yeeldeth this comfort, that if they moderately proceed, a greater heat and more quickning light may be made.
                        In the midst of which convulsions of Italy, Pope Iulius dies, and Iohn Cardinall of Medices succeeded him by the

title of Leo the 10. whereby a second truce was ratified betweene Lewis of France, and the King of Arragon: so that Lewis made great benefit of this interim and cessation, confederating with the Venetians, by whose assistance he brought a royall Armie into the Duchy of Millane: but the Pope hauing sent 40000 ducats amongst the Switzers, quickly weighed downe their former stedfastnes, and so when Millane and Cremona was stored with them, they were corrupted to be traitors to their first masters, and accordingly against all expectation, with an odious reuolt encountred the French in as cheerefull a manner, as euer before they had entertained the crownes of the sunne against the Italians: so that ere the yeere went about, the Castles of Millane and Cremona returne to the obedience of the Duke, and King Lewis held nothing in Italy but the lanterne of Genes, which afterward the Genouais razed to the ground, both to preuent the occasion of future tyranizing ouer them, and to manifest their inveterate malice against the flower-de-luce, though it glistered neuer so gloriously in an azure field. Now dyes Lewis 1514. but corruptio vnius generatio alterius: For Francis the first suruiues, and renewes the warres of Italy, passing the Alpes the yeere following, and surpassing considering his Royall Armie into the Duchy of Millane against the Emperor, Arrogonians, Sforza: and the Switzers contract a league, and aduance a strength to shoulder the new French King from any firmenes, nay if it may be footing in Italy; but like a Cedar of Libanus he standeth vpright, enduring the shaking of these tempestuous stormes, and so proceedeth to a warlike tryall, whereby the 13 of September in a gallant encounter at Marignan, he preuaileth 1515. against the Switzers, besiegeth the new Duke Maximilian
                           
                           Sforza in Millane, and coadiuted by the Duke of Burbon wrested this composition, that Maximilian shall bee the Kings pentioner in France, and the Switzers to depart with bagg and baggage.
                        Thus are the French once againe welcommed into the pleasures of Lombardy, and Francis the first is Lord of this vnquiet Duchy, which now is detained with a seeming securitie, because the Pope applauded the successe, and according to the superstition of those times, and policie of temporizing, blessed the royall standard of Valoies. But about the 20 of Iune 1519. the Emperor Maximilian paies his tribute of life to the first enlarger of breath, and Charles of Austria, competitor with the King of France, is preferred by the name of Carolus Quintus, inheritor of Spaine, with so many titles besides, that the Harolds were troubled in the proclaiming them, and the stile was tedious to be divulged. Betweene these two great Princes so many grudges increased, and stimulatory causes of enmitie appeared, that at last open defiances proclaimed an vnappeased warre, and the trumpets of Bellona ecchoed nothing but disturbance in the fields of Europe, especially after the Pope declares himselfe against France, and by way of prophesie fore-telleth the ruine of the French gouernment in Italy, adding withall some ominous signes of calamitie to ensue, and casting vp an vntoward reckning in this manner: That on S. Peters day at sunne-set, a lightning fell on the great tower of the Castle of Millane, and ouerthrew 6 fathomes of the curtaine on either side, consumed 250000 weight of powder, 1200 fire-pots, salt for 5 yeeres, and buried in the rubbish Richbowrg Captaine of the Castle, with 300 Gentlemen of account: vpon which aduantage the 23 of Nouember the

                           Marquis of Pescarra with his Spanish bands, the Marquis 
                           The Spaniard taketh part with Millane against the French. of Mantua, the Cardinall of Medices, and all the Emperors and Popes confederates come to Millane, and once againe recouer it, sacking the Towne which continued 15 daies, in which time the Pope dying, a new Pope called Adrian the sixt, who was Cardinall of S. Sixtus, was elected, and admitted Sforza into Millane, had not the French the yeere following attempted to recouer their losses, besieged Millane againe, tooke Nouarra, and presumed to establish themselues more strongly, which questionles they had done, but that the Venetians forsaking them, made the matter somewhat difficult, and left the Army staggering, like a tree almost tormented with the cruelty of many strokes, and waueth in the winde ready to fall with the next violence. At last the fatall stroke is giuen indeede, mischeeues throng on one another so hastily, that the French 1522 are expelled Italy, so farre from hoping to augment their glories, that they are in despaire to recouer their owne, formerly possessed. For presently the Castle of Millane yeelded to the conqueror, the garrison was quickly dispersed, or rather consumed with sicknesse, the Spaniard insulted, the Italians trembled, and in a word all the French particeans were eaten out with hunger, diseases, and mutinies.
                        Thus was Francis Sforza invested in the Duchy of Millane, and a generall league betweene the Millanoies, Emperor, and Venetians concluded: but for all this successe of the confederates (with the addition of the Duke of Burbons reuolt to the Emperor) the French Armie continues in Italy, and the Admirall with new forces breatheth out new malice against Millane, besieging the towne, battering the Citadle, and trampling their best fields to durt: in

which times Pope Adrian dyes, and Iulius Cardinall of Medices is chosen by the name of Clement the 7. who to insinuate with the Emperor beginneth a strange worke, and by the way of conniuencie permitteth him to vsurpe Millane for himselfe, whereupon all the Princes of Italy 
                           The Spaniard by the Popes flattery looketh after Millane for himself
                                 •…
                              . are terrified indeed, and not only repine against the Popes proceeding, but goe the plaine way to worke seeking by force of armes to propulse the Spaniard, wherein the better to preuaile 1524, the French are recalled againe, and by the glorious titles of Protectors of Millane, the Marquis of Salust and Tremouile admitted for the French: But at the last the 25 of February, the fatall battaile of Pauy determined all controuersies, and the Emperor triumphed in the captiuitie of the King of France, which occasioned a very dissolution of the French gouernment in Italy, as inforced to disclaime their interest both in the kingdome of Naples, and Duchy of Millane.
                        
                        Notwithstanding Francis Sforza is in no securitie of his estate, as suspecting the Emperors demand of 1200000 ducats for his expences, and that he intended a plaine vsurpation of the whole Duchie, whereupon disabled by force to suppresse him, he flies to the succour of his wits, and tampers with the Marquis of Pescara for the inuesture of the royall mantle of Naples, vpon condition to endeuour the spanish expulsion out of Millane; which designe and proiect the Pope and other Princes not onely allow, but as principall agents are imployed in the negotiation: but the Emperor Charles is incensed, and taking notice of these treasons, as he now entitleth them, raised vp the dust, that made Sforza blinde, and thus punisheth him, as chiefe delinquent. On the 24 of Iuly 1526. he brings his Armie to the siege of Millane, and with Caesars speedinesse

of Veni, vidi, vici, circumspecteth the Citie, obtaineth the conquest, and settles the Duke of Burbon in the Duchy: nor is his anger so moderated, but seeing the father of charitie durst transgresse his owne principles, he marcheth to Rome, and sacketh it, expulsing the Pope, not in admonitory manner, or after the discipline of the Church to excommunicate him ad coertionem; but with violence and terror to torment him ad ruinam, teaching him a new lesson of obseruing Emperors and Kings, and as farre as time had discouered to his conscience, shewing apparant signes of disanulling his authoritie in temporall affaires: nor desisteth he so, but vnderstanding of new releefe from the French and Lansguents, he hurrieth about with a full resolution to make due end of all. Thus endured this Duchy all the plagues depending on a miserable warre, till at last 1530. the children of France are released, and a peace ratified betweene the Emperor and the French King, who in the articles of agreement surrendred his claime to all these territories in Italy, and the Emperor is proud, hee hath so easie a passage into the countrey, which although seemed much distasting to the Princes, and was as thornes in the sides of the Clergy, as appeared The Spaniard absolute ly possesseth Millane. amongst the Cardinals, when they were enforced to ratifie the same: yet was the Emperor carelesse of their displeasure, and proceeded in what iourney he listed in despight of the Papacie; onely with a colourable show of commiseration, he restored Sforza to the Duchy of Millane, but kept the Castles of Cremona, and it in his hands: so that presently after his death, it was incorporated to the crowne of Spaine, and hath euer since looked with the eyes of ielousie and repining vpon all their Gouernors.

                           THE flourishing kingdom of France euer The Topography of France. since that Charles the great did as it were spread the wings of the Cherubins ouer sanctum sanctorum, and ratified the glory of the Pope of Rome by expelling the Gothes and Vandalls out of Italy, was knowne by the characters of the Christian King, and eldest sonne of the mother Church. But long before it suffred a diuision into Cisalpinam and Transalpinam: Transalpinam againe into Celticam, Belgicam, and Acquitanicam: whereby the best parts of Lombardy, the low Countries, and all on this side the Rhene westward marched vnder the standard of France, and was proud to be registred in the booke of her accounts: so that whatsoeuer hath bin since disioynted from this French frame, may be resembled vnto children pull'd out of the armes of a louing mother. But I will quietly bring you into her own roomes, whereby you shall partly behold the beauty and workmanship of her building: onely by the way I must a litle touch the Etymologie of the word, and tell you, that 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            in Greeke signifieth milke, and so the people Galli of 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              . from their complexion, and resemblance to whitenes, were called Galli or Galati. For other particulars, you haue Caesars commentaries, and well compacted histories, which haue tossed and tumbled the lodgings, yea the very beds of her chambers, and our owne acquaintance hath

ouer-lookt her choicest closets. It was once the nurse of valour, and afforded her vberant paps in those daies to such men, as trampled ouer the fields of Greece, robbed Apollos Temple at Delphos, fetcht away the spoiles of Asia, and by the assistance of Brennus an Englishman performed actions of wonderment, and applause. It was afterward the pride of Roman Consuls, and the greatest ambition thought it selfe sufficiently recompenced with her gouernment, when Rome had yet lessned her roome to make it prouinciall.
                        Presently followed the diuision of the Empire, and all the gouernment almost of Europe was rent asunder with the furie of very strange and sauage Nations, whose confused Chaos of barbarisme the brauery and goodnes of this countrey redacted to vniformity. A litle while after diuers families by being maiores palatij became masters of the Kingdome, wherein some by suppression, some by merit, some iure militari, and some by right of inheritance lifted vp the crowne and maiesticall head of this country: Straight-way the Eagle of Rome was sicke, and from France recouered health, how euer afterward it sought for further cure from the Germanes. Then followed the Law Salick amongst them, with absolute interdicting the Crowne of this glorious Monarchy to fall to the distass: whereupon the three famous houses of Valois, Burbon, &amp; Loraine entailed the same, and made as it were a feofment of perpetuity, wherein this Diadem still keepeth her residence, and is dunged, watred, and liketh her manuring: so that whatsoeuer hath bin long since diuided amongst, many Princes, looking vpon one another with the eyes of emulation, and ambitious desires to become greatest in the same, is now at length vnited vnder one Monarchy,

and title of France: so that howsoeuer some will haue Loraine absolute of it selfe, and no subiect: some stomach, that Burgoine is revolted: some repine, that Daulphine was vnited by donation: some confound Gascoigne and Guienne, abolishing quite the name of Acquitane: some remember, that Normandy was English: some presume of Britany, as a Principate of her owne: some make Sauoy afraid, when Geneua calls the King of France patron and protector; and some by diuision and subdiuision would extenuate her greatnes: yet is now all France, and the worthy Princes are resolued to keep correspondency with strangers, but suffer no new intrusion, nor any forreine claimes to preuaile at their marble table: I will therefore desist from any further vnwinding the yarne of strange bottomes, but spread a moderne cloth, and giue you some slender taste of her present dainties, whereby you shall not depart away altogether vnsatisfied.
                        To begin euen vnder the mountaines Pirenei, which Gascoine &amp; Guienne. diuide Spaine from France: the first part is called Gasconia, including Guienne and Acquitane, Dukedomes once appropriate to the heire of England, before the inuesture of the Principat of Wales. The chiefest Cities are Burdeaux and Tholouse, washed with the plenteous waters of the Garonn, a riuer not onely spreading her many armes abroad to send plenty all ouer the fields; but powring out her greater streames into the sea, welcommeth store of ships into her ports and harbours, sending them backe againe into many countries of Europe with glad tidings of an abundant vintage. Burdeaux is watrishly scited, by reason the riuer, and springs raiseth many marshes here about; yet is it wholesome, and the heat of the climate can endure the moistnes of the aire; the Citie is ancient,

and boasteth of an Vniuersitie, but more properly of the great concourse of Merchants: It is beautified with many monuments, especially the Pallace, wherein King Richard the second, the sonne of the blacke Prince was borne; and another without the Towne, a worke euer since the Emperor Galienus, and then supposed a glorious Amphitheater. The towne of Tholouse is more proud of antiquitie, and telleth of time before Troies devastation: yea remembreth since Deborah Iudge of Israel was famous for her wisdome and gouernment. It hath now a well disciplined schoole, a court of Parliament, populous streets, and reasonable buildings, but indeed they seeme very ancient, and for some speciall structures may carry the credit of magnificence. The other townes are many and very good, except countrey villages, which are as rude as in other places, and the Pesant liueth like a drudge, not daring scarse drinke of the wine of his owne garden, lest he should not raise such profit, as would answer the proportion of his rent. But herein our English Merchant hath somewhat ouer-reached them: For they hire the gardens themselues, and make the best vse of them, not trusting their labourers and husbandmen to handle the presses, but as they be hired by the day, or great.
                        The second part is called Poictoy, a countrey so great, and plentifull, that there are numbred 1200 parishes, and Poictoy. three Bishopricks, &amp; faine would haue you reckon these principall walled townes within her diuision of inferior and superior: The bishopricks are Poictiers, Leucòne, and Mailezay: The superior townes Roch sur yon, or if you will Rochell, one of the strongest townes in Europe, and the rather because it hath not trusted her walls and ramparts, which are yet stupendous, and magnificent, but the Lord

of hostes, and his true religion, which hath alwaies raised their spirits to an extraordinary confidence of mercy, and preuailing against any Antichristian attempt: Talmont, Meroil, Vouuant, Meruant, Bresfure, Lodun, Fountenay le Conte: The inferior, or townes of the lower diuision, Noiart, Partenay, Touars, Moncontoul, Herenault, Meribeau, Chastelleraut, and others of like eminence, amongst whom Poictiers is reckned the most populous of all France next to Paris, it is watred with the ouer-flowings of Clanius, a riuer filling the Loire, and sending it the faster into the sea: it boasteth of some antiquities, a Theater called the Sandes; a palace of the Emperor Galienus; an Aquaeduct, to which belong certaine fountaines, vulgarly called arceux de parigne, and other memories from famous Romans, who were here euer resident: To talke of their Churches, prisons, walls, ports, ramparts, arsenals, towers, riuers, bridges, and such like, it were superfluous considering they are not subiects either of admiration, or delicacie, but euen common or ordinary buildings.
                        The third part is Aniou, though a litle Prouince, yet very Aniou. fruitfull, and affordeth such excellent vines, that the common prouerbe crieth out, the wine of Aniou. For the stately riuer of Loire comming from Orleance posteth a pace with the glad tidings of a plentifull country, and excellent husbandry in their gardens: The mountaines yeeld a red stone and parget called ardoises; the vallies plenty of grasse, the riuers fish, and the barrennest place pasture for cattle: The chiefe Citie is Angiers on the banke of the Meduan, not far from the Loire; yet is it ioyned by a bridge of stone to another on the other side, and so you may conclude, that two townes make one Citie: Here you haue also ruines of Theaters, vulgarly Brohan,
                           
and an Academy enlarged, or rather founded by Lodwick the second 1389: the other townes are Samurs, Belforce, Bange, and such like, of whose particulars my purpose is not to make relation.
                        The fourth part is Britania, in times past Armorica: It boasteth for sending ouer such inhabitants into our countrey, Br
                                 •…
                              taigne. as not onely taught them a language, but peopled and possessed the same: Wee againe are resolued, that though France was first inhabited, yet from the greater Britaine the lesse receiued denomination, and by entercourse of people, affinitie, mariage, and politike confederation, both countries learned one anothers language. For being called Armorica, it at last condiscended to be entitled litle Britaine, retaining a long time an absolute Duke of her owne, and diuiding her territories into low and high Britaine: in both which are numbred nine Bishopricks, Carnouaile, S. Paul, Treguires, Doll, Rheines, S. Malo, Nants, Vannes, and Brein, amongst whom Doll hath the precedency, though Renes and Nants be the chiefest and greatest Cities: It is three parts exposed to the sea, and hath many strong ports, especially Brest, famous for sundry warlike exploits, and the last intrusion of the Spanish leaguers.
                        The fift part is Normandy, diuided into the countries of Constantine, Bessin, Maine, and Auge, in which as principall Normandy. Cities are recorded Roan, Pontoise, Alenson, Argenni, Caen, Baieux, and some few others: The people boast of their endeuors in spinning linnen cloth, excellent wits, and able bodies for the warres: But of all other things, they would exceede (especially the Gentlemen) for mansuetude, courtship, and affabilitie in attending the affaires of peace, and quietnes.
                        
                           
The sixt part challengeth the title of the Ile of France, a countrey so named, because it is in a manner environed Ile of France with excellent riuers, which make the ground so fertile, that for number of Townes, Gentlemens houses, places of pleasure, conueniencie of prouision, and other particulars tending to brauery and profit, it excelleth all the countrey: But her chiefest pride ariseth from the possession of Paris on the riuer Sequana, or the Sein, the mistris of all Cities; and Orleans on the Loire famous for many remarkable actions, betweene whom almost 40 English mile is one cawsey of stone, or otherwise there were no trauelling, especially in winter: For all the ground is so fat and clammy, that Paris it selfe is called Lutetia of luto, or the durtinesse of the soile.
                        The seuenth part belongeth to Bourges, or Berry, a countrey Berry. boasting of many delicate things; but the Citie is quite out of patience, if you either forget her monuments, or contradict her first founder to be Ogiges, the grandchilde of Noe: It is enclosed with the countries of Touraine, Burbon, and Niuernois, and on the riuer of Loire washing cleane the fields with his strange ouer-flowings are erected Cosme, Le Charity, the Citie of Neuers with her long bridge, Molins, and many other townes, some of hansome eminence, and some of lesse consequence.
                        The eight part is attributed to Limosin or Lemania, 
                           Limosin. contayning the County of Auernge, and yeeldeth such plenty of fenns and marishes, that the fatnes of the soile is both bettered and augmented thereby, howeuer the aire seemeth not so wholesome, and the Cities &amp; Townes are fuller of inhabitants, by reason of natures suppliment in all things, and the easines wherewith good husbandry dispatcheth her busines: yet are they neither great, nor

extraordinarily beautified: no not Limoges, Clermont, Beurgard, Monferau, and Goudade, which are the principall.

                        The tenth principall roome of this French palace, is Prouence. beautified with the Parliament roabes of the seuerall countries of Prouence, Daulphine and Orange. For they account Arles, a towne compassed with the streames of Rhodanus, rather in Prouence then Languedock, because it standeth (as it were) at the mouth of the riuer, to watch how the sea and the fresh water meets: as for Narbon, they esteeme it the pride of the riuer Araxis, and boast of the great lake for her denomination accordingly.

But Lyons hath yet more cause of insulting, in regard that all this part of France was

called Gallia Lugdunensis, from her owne name Lugdunum and diuers monuments of water-workes, bridges, towers, and temples, were magnificent in Caesars time. The prouince of Daulphine was giuen to the eldest sonne of France, with no other intent, but to name himselfe accordingly, by which occasion all Europe knowes what the Daulphine means. To Orange is a town so named appropriate, &amp; Grenoble with Auignion, are coniured within this circle.

For mine owne part, I haue thus bound them together within the girdle of Prouence, and could finde in my heart to make Geneua with her great lake and plaines vnder the mountaines, a daughter of France, although she hath vrgently denied her first mother. Besides, howeuer the Rhosne or Rhodanus commeth a pace out of Burgundy; it was once knowen by the name of Araris, and telleth a true tale of an hundred seuerall townes dispersed on his streames, and supported by his bankes.

is still a Dukedome and County graced with such royalties, that by their owne prerogatiues they haue brought armies into the field, and proclaimed the absolute freedomes of their gouernment: yea, in the latter times of contestation with France, they held the dignity of a Parliament: kept a full palace sequestred: and instituted the noble order of knighthood called the golden Fleece: some would annex the Dutchy of Barr vnto it, which I thinke more properly belongs to Loraine, and many Earledomes of estimation. The petty riuers receiue augmentation from the springs of her fields, and the swift Araris is sent into the sea from her mountaines. Her cheefest cities are Digion and Austune, maintaining regall tribunals, exposing ostentous edifices, boasting of great antiquity, setting out the brauery of diuers monuments and palaces, and supporting the necessities of many people. The townes of the Dukedome would bee called Latornelle, Rochpot, Chalons, Verdune, Seure, Argilly, Sausieu, and such like. The townes of the County please the inhabitants with the titles of Iussy, Gray, Dole, Besanson, Quingay, Salins, Arboies, Paligny, Bouteuant, Noseroy, Vennes, Chastillion, and diuers others: none of which, but either boasteth of one excellency or other; some for making salt, some for fulling cloth, some for spinning linnen, some for mines and minerals, some for excellent pastures, some for vines, some for cattle, and all for good building, plenty of Gentle-men, and concourse of people.
                        The twelfth doore of this Countries enclosure, is vnlocked Loraine. for Loraine, howeuer the Duke repineth that he is not a King with his ancestors, and still protesteth he wil be as absolute within his own territories as an Emperor: nay, sometimes addeth the French King himselfe. For louing

both alike, he will bee auxiliary to either, and sometimes enemie to both, as being such a Prince, who aduanceth and diminisheth at his pleasure the Marquisate of Ponce, the Earledoms of Vademont, Verdune, Blamont, Demanche, Marchen, and diuers other coronets, with the immunities of sundry Baronies; all depending vpon his praemium &amp; poena. The townes of this countrey are Metts, famous for the Emperours siege, and many warlike fortifications, Nancy, Voige, Chaligy, Vaudmont, Dompair, Rosiers, Rumbelluillier, and such like worthy description: but as I sayd in the beginning, I intend not to extenuate the endeauours of other men, either in their trauels or commentaries, nor tell any abrupt tales, when such and so many famous Authors and Cosmographers speake so orderly and plainely. Therefore I referre you thither for more ample discourses, especially concerning such cities as I haue ouerpassed, and yet flourish at this hower in seuerall countries; it shall only suffice me to name the countries and principall places, that I may prepare you the better to attend my comparison, when I shall set out England to the sale with her ornaments of commendation indeed.
                        The thirteenth roome of the palace of France her Honour, is appropriate to Callis and Boloigne, maintaining the Boloigne. sea-shores ouer against Kent, and the sweet breathing mouth of the Thames in England: but in such emulation being so neere, that either they complaine to be thus long disioynted from her gouernment, or seeme offended that we euer possessed them, and could keepe them no longer: much of this countrey once belonged to Artoys, and was diuided betweene the Emperour and France, by way of composition. But if you would know, wherin and wherof it boasteth indeed, it is for two famous Dukes of the same,

or if you will, but Earles; who by their valours and heroik endeauours, obtained the noble Diadems of the world: the one was Godfrey, inuested King of Ierusalem, and made like another Agamemnon, Captaine Generall of the Christian army against the Saracens. The other was Stephen, sonne of Duke Williams daughter of Normandy, raised to the dignity of England, and maintaining the possession against Maud the Empresse and her sonne, during his life.
                        The last part of this glorious Kingdome may include Vermond and Picardy, whose principall townes are Guise, 
                           Picardy. 
                           La Fere, Han, St. Quintine, Tornay, Chatel, Abeuile, Amiens, Auxi, Peron, and such like, washed with the streames of the Some and Scaldis, whose rivulets make the fields plentifull in corne and grasse, although the inhabitants are not industrious in planting of vine-yards, which I rather impute to the indisposition of the soile, then their negligence.
                        Thus you see with what a glistring crowne the head of France is impaled in the chaire of Maiesty, and may visit the palace of honour with more and better attendance of Princes, Dukes, Earles, and Gentle-men, then any absolute Monarch of the world: yet because it hath some defects in meere matters of state, according to the true prosperity of a countrey: and that diuers deficiencies chance somewhat disgraciously vnto her, like staines and spots to pure linnen, I cannot yeeld her the pride of happinesse: because you shall see in my next book of comparison, wherin her fulnesse of glory is ecclipsed, and how wee our selues enioy many prerogatiues before her.

For alas, the name and title of Gallia Belgica is long since extinguished, although (as I sayd) all the Countries on this side the Rhene toward France, were reputed as France. Of these I must vse a little ampliation, because I cannot chuse but wonder, how any Prince would neglect such a benefit, as the peaceable possession of these places, which for goodnesse, greatnesse and wealth vnited with the loue of the inhabitants, might haue exceeded Spaine it selfe, as by their reuenewes, multitude of people, cities, shipping, traffique with all nations, and home-bred commodities, may appeare. They are called Ditiones inferior is Germaniae, diuided into Dukedomes, Counties, and Lordships, and knowen by these Characters: The Dukedomes, Brabant, Limburck, Luzenburg, and Gelderland. The Counties, Flanders, Artoys, Henault, Holland, Zeland, Namurs, and Zutphen, which is but one principall towne, and some small territories adiacent. The Marquisate of the Empire. The Lordships, Freesland: for you must take notice, that East Freesland belongeth to a Prince of her owne, and euer disclaimed to bee subiect either to Emperour or King, and so holdeth vp a head of liberty accordingly, Mechlin, Vtrech, Trans-Ysell, and Groining.
                        
                        
                           
In these are numbred 228. great townes, murited with wals, ramparts, ditches, warlike ports, bridges, and fortifications. Besides, their guards are continuall, either of their owne Burgers, or Souldiers lying in garison, according to the proximity of the enemy, importance of the place, necessity of affaires, or inconueniences of the time. The villages or dorps are 6300. beautified with embattelled Churches of many seuerall fashions, frequented with entercourses of people, adorned with handsome markets, and priuiledged by ancient immunities, faires, solemne festiuals, and neighbourly meetings; besides granges, castles, religious houses, towres, and Yonkers mannor-places. The aire seemeth moyst, especially of Holland and Zeland, with the sea-coasts of Brabant and Flanders; yet not preiudiciall to the health of the inhabitants: for in the champaine of Brabant men liue an hundred yeeres. The Countrey is euery where visited with nauigable riuers, nor come they empty handed, but affoord delicate water and excellent fish: but what talke I of fish? when the large Ocean is so nigh, out of whose store-house a man may take, without being called in question, or repining. It is beautified with many woods, affoording timber to build withall, and the pleasure of hunting. It is smally, or not at all mountainous, except about Namurs, Luzenburg or Henault, It is fruitfull of corne, grasse and herbs, fit for pasture for cattle, and medicine for health: yet in some places of Brabant and Gelderland full of heath, which notwithstanding is not so barren, but cattle are fatted with the same, and their flesh hath an extraordinary sweet taste: It is free from those creatures, which are either noysome, or dangerous to man, and wanteth none of those blessings, wherewith the God of all blessing marketh a Countrey:

but a noble Prince, vnity of religion, and a quiet gouernment.
                        The Countrey of Limburck hath many names, and is a Limburck. prouince full of villages, it containeth part of the Dukedome of Boloigne, the Marquisate of Franckmount, the Earledome of Haspengo and Lootes, with many other Baronies. There are brought into the lists 24. great townes, amongst whom we begin inprimis with Leege, situated on the Mase, as hauing a Bishops See, a delicate castle, &amp; many well-ordred edifices: the dorps are reckned 1700. besides Abbayes and religious houses: toward the North adioyning to Brabant, it flourisheth in corne &amp; hath some vines. Toward the South, neighbouring France and Lutzenburg: it is more barren, as intermingled with hils and woods, the remainder of that great forrest of Ardenia, of which so many fabulous accidents are recorded. It containeth diuers mines of marble and cole, and in such goodnesse of euerything, that a prouerb raiseth it selfe, to haue bread better then bread, fire hotter then fire, and iron harder then iron.
                        The Dukedome of Lutzenburg is for the most part mountainous and full of wood, in the rest well tilled, and Lutzenburg where they haue stocked vp the trees, excellent ground: what neighboureth France conserueth both their language and customes, the rest speake Dutch. The names of the Prouince and principall City haue one sound, but it is ill diuided, part on a hollow by the riuer Essa, part on a rocky mountaine: so that it proposeth no great vniformity: but yet yeeldeth a gracefull obiect, and in retaining the authority of a Parliament, hath a preheminence of many greater and prouder townes. The next is Arlunum, quasi ara Lunae, as supposed, that they heere worshipped the Moone.

The rest are sutable, some for strength, as Thion on the Mosell; some for commodity, as Baston, the mart of the Countrey, and adiacent to the forrest; and some for contentment and orderly conueniency, as 26. others.
                        The countrey of Henault is sutable to the rest, and marcheth with the same equipage of plenty and pleasure: the Henault. cheefe cities are Mons and Valenciens. To Mons is attributed the precedency, for antiquity, strength and riches: yet is it almost neere the center of the Land, and on a little riuer called Trulla, whose visitation makes the common people wealthy and industrious, especially in weauing of a stuffe called Sayes, which heere exceede all the townes of the Low-Countries. Valenciens is better sited on the riuer Scaldis, and is very spacious, well walled, and full of ancient buildings, the Citizens are great trades-men, and gaine much by the making of fustians, the rest are brought into the account with the number of 22. Amongst whom Binchium might haue showne you a goodly palace, erected by Mary, sister to Charles the fift, and beautified with gardens of pleasure to these vses. To beguile idle houres, to countenance a solitary retiring from the great encombrances of the world, to quicken meditation with a corresponcency of time and place, and to inuite the body to a better aire, then commonly populous cities affoord, it was yet destroyed, some would faine say defaced, by Henry the second, King of France, in those times of desolation, when intestine mutinies could not be appeased without effusion of bloud, and the rage of Princes exasperated one another to sore reuenges. Heere is also the ancient towne of Ba

                              aies, which flourished in the time of Constantine the Emperour. The rest are Charlimont, Manburg, and Philips towne, wherein the first founders, or rather re-edifiers,

made strong defences against the eruptions of the French, and were resolued to diuide the house of Burgundie for euer from the Flower-de-luce. Many other townes with the villages might be spoken of; but because there are few memorable things in them, I passe all ouer with such a slightnes, as is required in a man, that maketh haste out of an idle iourney, till he come to his place of rest, and better consequence.
                        The countrey of Artois did once absolutely belong to the Flower-de-luce, as by the antiquitie and scituation Artois. may appeare: But afterward in the contract 1529, it was patible of diuision, when the Emperor and the French King were weighed in the ballance of successe to set forward the renowne of eithers preuailing; so that when France was found too light, in regard that the false hand of fortune turned the scale on tother side, twelue pretty townes fell from the King, as stones pull'd from a ruinous wall, leauing the whole Prouince in hazard of falling too, had not the other part of the countrey succor'd it selfe vnder the supportation of Picardy, and now telleth vs of good corne, many riuers, much wood, and reporteth of the raining wooll by the testimonie of Saint Hierome, and others, who set it in the account of wonders.
                        The Prouince of Namurs is plentifull of all things, that Namurs. belongeth to the vse of man, as if the horne of Achelous were not onely reserued here for a monument, but distributed abundance by reason of the vertue following the possession: it hath many iron and cole mines, of whose nature and condition this is obserued, that whereas other coales are extinguished with water, and enflamed with oyle; these are set on fire with water, and rebated in their

heat with oyle. It hath onely fowre walled Townes, who dare thus lift vp their heads aboue water to keepe the bodies from sinking. 1. Namurs, scituated on the two riuers Mosa and Scambra vnited by a well compacted bridge of stone, retayning a Bishops sea, and keeping the solemnitie of a Parliament. 2. Bouinum on the banke of Mosa, much defaced by the warres, being of late a rich, stately, and populous Citie. 3. The third is Charlemont, one of the strongest Castles in Europe, mounted on a high looking rocke, whose foundation is washed by the riuer Gillet, and from the Emperor retaineth both glory and denomination. 4. The last is Vallencuria, whose etimology doth almost expresse it selfe: For here are all ciuill causes determined, and the villages of the Prouince bring their controuersies to be decided.
                        The Dukedome of Brabant challengeth a more plentifull description: For it hath 26 walled townes, and at Brabant. least 700 villages well inhabited, industrious people, and proud of their glory in retaining the presence of the Enfanta, and the Court of State in Brussels, where, by reason of the pleasure and conveniencie of many delicate fountaines, diuers well ordred pallaces invite you to behold euen obiects of magnificence, and the Noblemen boast, how they are better accommodated here, than in other parts of the countrey. Antwerp is scited on the riuer Scaldis, and so glorious for goodly buildings, famous marts, a beautifull Statehouse, delicate Churches, an Exchange for Merchants, an house for Englishmen, a wonderfull Cittadle, an admirable harbour, and such like illustrations, that not long since it stroue for the Coronet of Europe, and to be the Queene of Townes. Louaine is very populous, and graced with an Vniuersitie, which the

Duke of Brabant, Iohn the 4. erected. Mechline hath her estimation from the assembly of States, and deciding of controuersies. Busumduce, a towne of note for a publike schoole, and the peoples meeting to solemnize triumphs. Tiena, neighbouring the riuer Geta, from whence the cheese hath a particular estimation. Leuua, famous for drinke brewed there. Niuella, proud of a monasterie only of noble women. Arscot by the riuer Demera, in times past a Marquisate, but by the Emperor Charles aduanced to a Duchy. Berghen-op-zoome, named so for the kisses of the riuer that saluteth it, and famous for the auncient Marte, and frequentation of Merchants; yet since Antwerp flourished vtterly decaied. Megen, a place of contentment, glorying in the passages of the riuer, playing the wanton with her shores, and running vp and downe, as if it brought glad tidings of prosperitie. Breda, a towne of delicacie; yet may you in respect of her building adde the Epithet of magnificent. Steneberg vpon the sea, which once had wealth enough to invite Merchants to a banquet of commercing. Lira, a place so sufficiently pleasant, that diuers Noblemen haue retired thither, as repining against the troubles, which debarred them from more oftner entercourses. Vileuord raiseth her fame from the strength of a well scituated Castle, and the feare of a soule-terrifying prison. Gembloures can shew you a Lord Abbot, as free and imperious, as a Count Palatine in his iurisdiction. Iudoigna boasteth of her nursery of Princes, and that the wholesomnes of her aire inuiteth them to an abode of wantonnes and contentment. Hannutum maintaineth the credit and estimation of an Earledome, and addeth withall the blessing of a most fertile countrey. Landen lifteth vp the head of age

in such a manner, that shee warranteth her selfe the first, though not the best of Townes. Halen is notorious for the warres and many deuastations by battery of the Canon, and breaches made in her walls and bulwarks. D

It retaineth the estimation, and aduanceth the walls of 28 Cities, plowing the fields of 1200 villages, whose enclosures yeeld plenty of grasse toward the West, and bringeth forth strong oxen for tillage, and horses for seruice, as you may see by

their beautifull mares, of whom we make such good triall, and vse in our Carosses. The blessings of milke and hony fill their cups euen to ouer-flowing, and the abundance of wheat might once haue told them, that it was no miracle, when Isaac sowed in the land of Abimelech, and receiued a 100 for one, because they haue reaped, and found after haruest 60 for one. The people are gentle, and the women streight and comely: their husbandry is graced with the sale of linnen cloth, and their Semsters boast of bone-lace, and delicate needle-workes: but concerning the Townes the principall are thus the subiect of relation. Gaunt hath a wall of 9 mile circumference, but possessing much waste ground is not very populous, nor filled with houses, although three riuers are at strife for her partition, and making 20 Ilands of her territories, challenge one another for lifting vp most land aboue water: but in truth the inhabitants in her behalfe complaine of the misery of many sieges, and that her fortunes haue bin as it were tossed to and fro with extremities: For shee hath tried the seuerall dispositions of French, English, Dutch, and Spanish, boasting of nothing so much, as the famous birth of Iohn Duke of Lancaster, sonne of Edward the third, and in the right of his wife King of Castile; and that memorable retreat, wherein Generall Norris with a few resolute English confronted the whole Armie of the Prince of Parma. Bruges for delicacie of buildings, sweetnes of streets, frequentation of merchants, and strength of walles did once surpasse all the townes of the Low Countries, and still boasteth, that howeuer her reputation is somewhat diminished, she was yet the occasion of the credit and glory of Flanders. Ypers raised her wealth from the endeuours

&amp; industry of Clothiers, vntill the English with the help of those of Gaunt destroying their great suburbs, ouerthrew likewise their trafficke, &amp; brought more ruder hands to pull their loomes &amp; mills a peeces, then laboured in their first building, and raised them vp: the rest with the villages, castles, houses, Churches, bridges, and such like structures of admiration, are worthy of further enlargement: but the booke fills already too fast, and I purpose another thing, then to patch vp thus an ill fauoured cloth out of the shreds of other mens Cosmography, who tell you of Turwin and Tornay, and those noble endeuours of Hen. 8. when the King of France claimed Artois and Flanders, as well as Picardy.
                        
                        The Prouince of Gelderland is altogether champaine, yet intermingled with woods, and stored with euery Gelderland. thing to satiate our desire, especially if wee looke after plenty of corne, and pasture, which both stuffeth full their garners, and fatteth their cattle, insomuch that they bring them leane in great heards from the furthest part of Denmarke, to receiue here, as it were a more seemely forme. It is visited with the three riuers of Rhene, Mase, and Whale: it hath 22 walled townes, attended on by the care and diligent seruice of 300 villages, amongst whom Numegam is metropolis, and indeed boasteth not onely of antiquitie, but the royaltie of a King, had not time worne out the shining brightnes of his Crowne, or some boistrous hand pull'd the scepter out of his arme, and shouldred him quite aside from his Throne; or else it was as the Kings of Cities in Mesopotamia, Reges à regendo, when nine of them made battaile together, and the preuailers spoiled Lot, and tooke him prisoner.
                        Herein is also contained the country and Earledome of Zutphen.
                           
                           Zutphen, and the delicate Iland of the Betto, how euer Holland would challenge her of disobedience, if shee should call another mother. For Goricum, Worchum, and many other townes are reputed hers, onely Arnham on the other banke of the Rhene, with the sweet fields of the Vellwe, will still belong vnto Gelderland, and could tell you of a sconce builded ouer against it: of another on the banke of Icell: of another before Numegen, where that valiant German Sir Martin Skinck lost his life, and was tossed from graue to graue, vntill a military ceremonie laid him in an honorable place of rest: and of another at the point of the Iland, diuiding the riuer into the Rhene and Whale, which saies you can scarce shew such another, and is proud of nothing more, than her founder, and title: For it is called still Skinck sconce, and could affright you with the relation of many strange designes, and changes of military seruice, as if the Armies chose these parts of the country to play at base in, and as it were dance a mattachene in armour. For I my selfe knew the leaguer one yeere in Gelderward, within two mile of Eltam; another yeere at Bommel; a third at Berck; a fourth in Cleueland, &amp;c. It flourished vnder Otho the third Earle of Gelderland, who walled in Ruremond, Arnham, Harderwick, Bomell, Gooch, and Waggenhen, and so held the title of a Countie vntill Rheinaldus the second, whom for his valour, iustice, piety, and other vertues the Emperor Lodwick lifted vp to the dignitie of a Duke in the presence of the Kings of England, France, and the Princes Electors 1339.
                        
                           Zeland is a new name, and not read of in ancient histories, as if a man should say, a countrey compounded both Zeland. of land and sea: For it is euery where distinguished with

Ilands, which are environed with water, and knowne by 15 seuerall names, against whom the sea hath much preuailed, and not long since with violent invndations swallowed 300 of their inhabited townes; so that now you may saile by the steeples of Churches, and not knowing the reason, wonder to what purpose the Towres were so erected. There remaine now three principall, which are preserued against the rage of the Ocean with exceeding cost, and powerfull industry, namely Walcheren, Schouen, and South-Beueland: and foure inferior, Diuelant, Tolen, North-Beuelant, and Woolfersdike; which are graced with the prerogatiues of eight walled townes, whereof six continue their Estates Deputies for the whole County. Midelborough, Flushing, Camphere, and Armenden, which hath no voice, although it cry out neuer so loud, that it standeth with the rest in Walcheren. In Schouen, Sirexee, and Bucers hauen, which hath likewise no voice. In South-Beueland which is the greatest and fertilest Iland, the towne of Tergowse; and in the land of Tolen, the towne of Tertolen, and Martins dike, which hath also no voice. These Ilands are preserued by the downes, which be certaine bankes of sand cast vp with the tides, and where there are no sands, as toward the south, the dikes are raised by the industry of man, and proportioned with equall height to the rest; all so rammed with mats &amp; casses of fagots 6 or 7 foote long, that it not only performeth the effect of their securitie, but seemeth an artificiall gracefulnes, and being so neere England is worthy the ouer-viewing. In times past the Marquis of La Vere, and Flushing were onely at the Generall Councels of the countrey, now the places are supplied with Deputies, and new times haue giuen way vnto new orders: For these

inheritances and titles are incorporated in Prince MAVRICE of NASSAV, and the Abbot of St 
                           Martins in the towne of Midlebourgh, which at this instant is the Court of Zeland: As for the Prince, he is the seruitor of the States, and can doe nothing absolute of himselfe without their direction: And for the Abbot, his name is extinguished with his superstition, and the reformation of religion hath also reformed his very title and authoritie: so that the Estates make the Democratia a princely gouernment, and assume to themselues the power of life, death, controuling, punishing, rewarding, and resolute ordering all their affaires, except in cases of necessitie, wherein there is no disputing, nor interiecting any cause of imputation either of negligence, or improuidence: For so great Princes either diminish or augment their illustrious royaltie, and Monarks whose pride at the first swelled ouer the banks of preuailing, haue in one age bin left bare on the sands of an ebbing fortune. The cheefest trade of the inhabitants is nauigation, fishing, and making salt: yet within the land they imploy themselues to tillage, and feeding of cattle. The people doe so multiply and increase, that they are compelled to inlarge their Townes, as well for their owne inhabitants, as frequentation of strangers, who since the troubles of Antwerpe resort hither extraordinarily; but if I should adde the brauery of fortifications, I should do them no wrong, nay I might augment their glory: For Flushing is one of the strongest Townes of Europe; and Midleborough so ramparted and guarded, that a very militarie renowne is attributed vnto them, and the Burgers themselues deserue well of all good reports.
                        The prouince of Holland is (as it were) a Peninsule, circumuironed Holland,
                           
with water. For the sea, the Rhene, and the meeting riuers, open their doores in such a manner, that you may goe (as it were) round about the house, except in one corner toward Gelderland. and although it containeth not in circuit aboue two hundred English mile: yet lifteth vp the wals, ramparts, and warlike ports of thirty townes of such receipt, wealth and shipping, that the pride of Tyrus and Sidon, exclaimed vpon by so many Prophets, had not greater occasion of raging and oftentation, howeuer they are yet blessed with moderation, and restraint of distempered actions. The villages or dorps are foure hundred, amongst whom the stately county of the Hague aduanceth her counteuance equall to a great city: for their court retaineth some shew of princilnesse, and the old palace maketh demonstration of those noble customes and hospitality, which the ancient Earles in their former power maintained; yet because it is vnwalled, neighbouring a pretty parke of fallow Deere, and inuiteth you to better retired places, then the townes of hurliburly and continuall commerces accustome, it is reputed a Dorp, and seemeth much contented with her situation so remote from the forraine enemy of the State. Harlem with her spaciousnesse is founded most delicately; for as soone as you are entred, the pleasure of a pretty wood inuiteth your abode, where the Citizen in the dayes of pastime make their honest conuersation, the strengthning of one anothers friendship. Besides, for bulwarkes, harbours, shipping, capacity, entercourse, and noble meetings, it challenged the precedency of all the towns of Holland, &amp; howeuer Amsterdam hath got the start for riches, marchants, and nauigation; yet hath Harlem a greater wall, and better compacted buildings. Dort or Dordrech some 150. yeeres since was made

an Iland by the inundation of the sea, which with vngentle violence (at that time) washed away whole fields of firme ground, and like a barren vnsatiate wombe, filled her paunch with aboue 200. villages: It is a beautifull long towne, and graced with the staple of Rhenish wine, corne and timber, brought in great, strange and long boats called Punts, which neuer goe backe againe, but serue in these riuers as a receptacle of diuers families, and many people who haue no other dwelling then on shipboord, &amp; if you demand how they liue the voyage ended, &amp; maintain their estates when the first businesse is determined. They spin, fish, follow the league with prouision, carry corne and turffe from towne to towne, and are employed for the vse of bridges, to transferre whole armies ouer riuers; but to tell you that some of them are 160. foot long, and haue three or foure diuisions or houses in one boat, would raise a suspicion, and peraduenture make you smile at the fiction, but admire the truth. Delft is so named of a ditch, cut out betweene it and the Hague, and is a sweet and pleasant towne, although the inhabitants are emploied for the most part about brewing, and spinning of wooll. Leyden boasteth of her antiquity, as deriuing her originall from the Legions of the Roman souldiers heere resident, when the custome of warre, and the coldnesse of winter did enforce them to garison, and orderly sequestration: it is now an Vniuersity, beautified with walkes of pleasure and magnificence: yet cannot wash away the imputation of many trayterous reuolts and vnconstant resolutions against the gouernment of the States. Gouda is a populous towne vpon the riuer Isell; yet could tell you of another of her owne name, that runneth into the Ocean, as if it made haste to tell you, from whence it came. Amsterdam, besides

the sea is visited by the gentle riuer Tia: yet seemeth sory that she cannot be affoorded the sweetnesse of her waters, and is so contriued as the channels of Venice, which direct you by boat from house to house: for shipping, it is one of the most famous harbours in the world, and hath such entercourse of Marchants and Saylors, that I haue numbred 1000. ships of all sorts to goe out at one tide: for buildings it equals the best, and for orderly watches and fortifications the Burgers haue a blessed vniformity and glorious reputation. Enchusen vpon the banke of the sea called the Zuidersea, is famous for the building of ships, which are heere yeerely built and orderly rigged. Horne hath the same foundation, and in May bringeth together such a faire of butter and cheese, and in such incredible manner, that almost all countries haue suppliment from thence. Alcmar likewise maintaineth the dairy, and encloseth such fields, that a very few acres of ground raise a good farme. Purmerndum boasteth of her first estimation, by reason of the palace and delicate castle, which belonged to Count Egmond, was within her wals. Edam hath great store of shipping, and such kine, that few oxen are larger: besides, heere is sowed so much hemp, that most of the netting, which either Holland or Zeland vse is heere made. Sconhouen is a delicate towne and place of pleasure: for indeed it is an attribute, or significant name from the attracting delight of their gardens, and hath a staple for Salmons. Rotterdam a great city full of shipping, yet rather boasteth of the birth of Erasmus. Brill is a towne of defence, and was once causionary to England, in regard of great summes disbursed for the States, but now of late, by the Kings Maiesty, resigned into the hands of the States. Thus for strength, fertility, wealth, and plenty of shipping,

                           Holland exceedeth any countrey in the world, challenging no more circuit of ground, as may be ghessed by the yeere 1587. when there was 600. ships arrested in the Sont by the King of Denmark, and in 1588. it is well knowen, that in very short warning they supplyed vs with an hundred men of warre, as for Cales voyage, the third part of that Nauie was theirs: but if you looke further, in the West and East-Indies, in the hauens of Barbary and Affrick, in the Arches, and Constantinople, in the Gulph of Venice, and almost all the frequented places of the world, the Hollander aduentures, and is now a glorious Marchant and Mariner. To conclude, Holland, Zeland, and Freesland, smile in the possession of 2500. good ships, from 150. tun to 700. and although they haue no timber, or at least very little growing for this purpose, yet doe they yeerely set vpright 5. or 600. of one sort or other.
                        Of all in the States diuision, the City and Lordship of Vtrech. 
                           Vtrech is principall, as retaining an ancient Bishops See, and shewing the ruines of a castle, erected to suppresse the insolency of the inhabitants, who in a pride of their owne greatnesse, made a continuall sport of rebellion, it is now vtterly defaced, and the loyalties of their harts seeme more firme, then the workes of mens hands, assuring vs that so noble a citie and populous territories would yeeld a very ambitious Prince reasonable satisfaction, if it might bee commanded by the authority of a Monarch, and had the vnity of a well-ordered Common-wealth and Kingdome.
                        The Countrey of Freesland would require an ample discouery Freesland. to extract her originall, and relate her stories: so would Cleeueland, the land of Luke Munsterland, and some others reputed Neuters, that is, neither maintaining the Spanyard in his military inuasion, nor supporting the States
                           
in their iustifiable defences. But I refer you to their own &amp; manyother cōmentaries, &amp; content myself with a cursory trauell, and what I can catch hold of by running touches. It is diuided into two parts by the riuer Amisia, which commeth downe by Embden: East Freesland challenging a particular preheminence and iurisdiction, as I sayd, by it selfe: and West Freesland suffering this partition, Ostergo, 
                           Groining. 
                           Westergo, Transilana, Drenta, Tuenta, the seuen woods and Lordship of Groining, a beautifull towne and famous for that siege, wherein were 80000. in the field on both sides 1594. when Prince Maurice obtained it for the States, being before ouer-awed 1580. by the Duke of Parma. As it hath more cattle and pasture then other prouinces: so more villages, &amp; the inhabitants are more warlike, insomuch, that commonly there is a Regiment or two of Frizons in the army, when amongst the foot-companies there is scarse two hundred Dutch-men besides: yet haue they many troops of horse, and are distinguished by diuers characters, although they speake all one language, either high or Low-Dutch, as Resties, Lansguents, Frizons, Switzers, High-Germans, Dutch, and Free-booters, or Boot-halers.
                        
                        I haue insisted the longer on the discourse of these Prouinces, The Low-Countries is lost by the Spanyard. because you may see the errours of selfe will and ill counsell, euen in the gouernment of mighty Monarchs, as I sayd before. For the conquest of the West Indies, the onely greatnesse of Spaine, was not, nor is so glorious to his ostentation, as the losse of the Low-Countries (when hee might with peace &amp; mansuetude haue opened the arms of a louing father ouer them) greeuous to his remembrance, and a very wound to his policy. Because if these countries were vnited, and altred from their Aristocratia or Democratia, chuse you whether, to the vniformity of a Monarchie,
                           
affoording to Caesar what belongeth to Caesar, raising their nobility, aduancing the well-deseruers, encreasing their estates, disciplining their able men to the seruice of the warres, and from the imitation of other countries endeauouring to raise their owne glories, it would surmount all the reuenues of Spaine, which for extent of ground measureth six times as much; nay, if I added the West Indies, computatis computandis, I might be beleeued after some reasonable disceptation. For say a stirring spirit desired glory and pompous attendancy. From hence might bee obtained infinite treasure, settled content, high magnificence, multitude of subiects, commerces of marchants, store of shipping, stately horses, louing people, and the glory of A generall commendation. nature, beauty it selfe: so that if the Arch-Dukes fortune could raise him to such a height, if at first he honoured the Enfanta, with vshering her bare-headed into Bruxels, hee might then prostrate himselfe before her throne indeed, as one of the greatest Princes of the world. For although his hopes did depend vpon other supportation, and in her owne language he cries Kala, as peraduenture determining a composition with his brother Mathias, if the peacefull Rodolphus were once discharged of his debt to nature, whereby she might be Empresse of Germany: yet cannot a meere titular dignity come neere so great a contentment, as to haue the fruition of such a kingdome, and natiue felicity. But if delicate life and quiet establishment of temporall happinesse were propounded, amongst these is honesty of contracts, probity of manners, truth of word, preuention of wants, fulnesse of wealth, delicacy of apparrell, neatnesse of furniture, vniformity of building, magnificence of structures, plenty of viands, sumptuousnesse of feasts, liberty of conuersation, and what else enflameth our

desires to helpe our deficiencie: yea the very behauiour of the women enforceth admiration. For being tall, beautifull, actiue, and familiar, they are yet free from those peenish humors of ielousie, lightnes, &amp; pride, which make vs weary one of another: Besides all their words, &amp; actions tend to simplicitie, and modest plainenes, retaining with all this suppliment of wants, making of cloth, and knitting of lace and dainty works: But when I consider their mutuall entercourses, their skill in buying and selling, their frequenting of the shops, their going from place to place without so much as suspition of incontinencie, and their loue to their husbands and children euen in the ouerflowings of naturall imperfections, or if you will diseases of the Nation; I stand amased, and sweare, that vertue cannot be poore, and an honest minde will not be seduced for any worldly respects to the slauish corruption of las

But at this time you shall not heare mee stammer out my words, considering Mr 
                           Cambden hath spoken so well and distinctly, as if a Lawyers cunning had not onely inlarged some excellent matter, but doubly graced the same with good deliuerie, and pleasing elocution: Besides, I must in the second booke vntie her bound-vp fardell, and come to more neerer particulars, and therefore there shall be now no further disputing of the same: yet Ireland hath made me amased to see such an impossibilitie to reduce her, which mee thinks cannot proceed from any innated hatred against vs particularly (though it be an vnsauoury truth) because in affecting Spaine and France shee disclaimeth their formalitie, and would faine besprinkle the beautifull faces of ciuilitie, gouernment, formes of Cities, courtlines, maiestie, and state, with the vntoward termes and abuses of policie, restraint of libertie, couetousnes, flattery, pride, and licentiousnes: therefore I will bee the bolder to speake a word or two of her vnkindnes.
                     
                     
                        
                        CHAP. XVII. The description of IRELAND.
                        
                           THE country and kingdome of IRELAND is generally for naturall aire, and commoditie Ireland. of blessings, sufficient to satisfie a couetous, or curious appetite: but withall diuided into such fastnes of mountaine, bogg, and wood, that it hath emboldned the inhabitants to presume on hereditary securirie, as if disobedience had a protection. For the mountaines denie any cariages, but by great industry and strength of men (so haue we drawne the Cannon ouer the deepest boggs, &amp; stoniest hils) and the passages are euery way dangerous, both for vnfirmenes of ground, &amp; the lurking rebell, who will plash downe whole trees ouer the paces, and so intricately winde them, or lay them, that they shall be a strong barracado, and then lurke in ambush amongst the standing wood, playing vpon all commers, as they intend to goe along. On the bogg they likewise presume with a naked celeritie to come as neere our foote and horse, as is possible, and then flie off againe, knowing we cannot, or indeed dare not follow them: and thus they serue vs in the narrow entrances into their glins, and stony paths, or if you will dangerous quagmires of their mountaines, where a 100 shot shall rebate the hasty approch of 500; and a few muskets (if they durst carry any) well placed, will stagger a pretty Armie, not acquainted with the terror, or vnpreuenting the mischeefe.
                        
                           
The Prouince of LEMSTER is more orderly than Lemster. the rest, as being reasonable well inhabited, and hauing some forme of a Common-wealth; so that I finde no mislike either for delight, or profit, but that the want of wood abridgeth their computation of happinesse; yet questionles was the principall cause of our reducing them to ciuilitie, and the place wherein we first setled many English families. Some vnite, and some diuide the kingdome of Meth from Lemster, and make it a Prouince of it selfe, containing East-Meth, West-Meth, and Longford, wherein O Roorck is resident, supposing himselfe the greatest Gentleman in the world; yea contesting many times with Oneal, how euer with much adoe he afforded him precedencie: The countrey is very fruitfull and pleasant, not so mountanous, but ill inhabited: For the warres, and their owne bestialitie, haue not onely made a separation of all good order, but euen terrified both beast and fowle from commorance amongst them in many places.
                        The Prouince of MVNSTER hath some Townes well Munster. aduanced by the sea coasts, and many excellent harbours, wherein Ireland may boast ouer all the countries of Europe: The grounds adiacent are very fertile, and in many places afford cause of ostentation; but more inward they are very barren and mountanous, full of boggs, wood, and other remote places, whose fastnes hath incited the people to ouer-great presumption: yet because of the spatiousnes with men desiring good order, it might be reduced and reformed, as enioying plentifull and sweet riuers, full of fish, and some of sufficient depth to transport reasonable boates into the land.
                        The Prouince of CONACH is diuided from the rest by a Conach.
                           
goodly riuer called the Shanon, being as I take it the greatest of any Iland in the world: For it fetcheth a course of 200 mile, and filleth his channell along the shores of Longford, Meths, Ormond, Limrick, and Kerry, yet serueth them in no great stead: For their shipping commeth no further, than Limrick, where it is fiue mile broad fresh water, and 60 mile from the maine sea, from thence small cotts, as they tearme their boates, carry their wood, turff, fish, and other commodities: but for fish, as Salmon, Breame, Pike, and diuers other sorts, I shall not be beleeued to relate the numbers, and hugenes, by such as are enemies to obseruation, or the beleefe of the blessings of other countries. Within 20 mile of Limrick, as I take it, a litle beyond, the praecinct of Caher-Castle a strange rock hath taken her lodging euen crosse the riuer, and filleth the roome in such a manner, that almost the nauigation is hindred thereby: but what cannot men and money doe? and why should not these idle people be industriously imployed to remoue the same, &amp; so free the passage to Athlone: As for an obiection of impossiblitie; the iudgement of men hath yeelded to suruey, and many examples haue confirmed the effects of more laborious attempts. The south part, namely Tomond, (for by reason of the riuers interposing it selfe I see no reason why it should be disiointed from Conach) with Galloway and Clenricard is very stonie, full of marble, alablaster, and iett, and hath better order both for number and good building in their Castles, than other parts of Ireland: The north from Athlone to the Abbey of Aboile, and so beyond the Curlewes as farre as Slego, is of excellent temperature and goodnesse: These Curlewes are mountaines full of dangerous passages, especially when the Kern take a stomach and a pride

to enter into action, as they terme their rebellion and tumultuary insurrections. On the other side the County of Maio consorteth with the pleasingest place in the Kingdome, by whose beaten banks lye those famous Ilands of life, of whom a ridiculous tale is fathered, that nothing dies in them, so that when the inhabitants grow old, they are caried else where, which custome they haue of late superstitiously obserued both in these Ilands of Aran, and some other adioyning of the same condition, as they suppose.
                        The Prouince of VLSTER, and called the North is Ulster. very large, and withall mountanous, full of great Loughs of fresh water, except Lough Cone, which ebbeth and floweth, as the Sea shouldreth aside the streites at Strangford, and with that violence at the ebb, that a ship vnder saile with a reasonable gale of winde cannot enter against the tide. These lakes nature hath appointed in steed of riuers, and stored with fish, especially Trowt, and Pike, of such strange proportion, that if I should tell you of a Trowt taken vp in Tyrone 46 inches long, and presented to the L: Montioy, then Deputie: you would demand, whether I was oculatus testis, and I answer, I eat my part of it, and as I take it both my L: Dauers, and Sir William Goodolphin were at the table, and worthy Sir Iosias Bodley hath the portraiture depicted in plano. Here are no Townes, or at least very few, but diuers Castles dispersed, and the inhabitants remoue their cabbins, as their cattle change pasture, somewhat like the Tartarians, except in times of warre, and troubles, then doe they retire vnder the couett of Castles, and order their houses wonde with rods, and couered with turffs, as well as they can, bringing their cattle euen within their houses, lying altogether in one roome

both to preuent robberies of Kern, and spoile by Wolues. Amongst these euery country is subiect to the Law Tanist, which is, he which is best able to maintaine the reputation of their familie, is the great O, and commander.
                        Through the Kingdome generally the winter is neither so cold, nor the summer so hot as in England, by reason whereof Haruest is very late, and in the North wheat will not quickly ripen, nor haue they acornes once in a dozen yeere: their principall corne is oates, which are commonly burnt out of the straw, and then trod from the husks with mens feete; of this they make their bread in cakes, being first grownd by calliots and drudges very naked, and beastly sitting on the ground, with the mill like our mustard quernes betweene their legs, and then vpon broad yron presses they bake the meale when it is kneaded; which custome the best obserue in Munster with their cheefest corne. The continuall showers and mists make the countrey more dangerous to our Nation, debarring the absolute assurance of wholesome aire, and the consequent health: seldome any frost continues, or snow lieth long, but on the mountaines, in which are great store of Deere both red &amp; fallow. The abundance of Wolues compels them to house their cattle in the bawnes of their Castles, where all the winter nights they stand vp to the bellies in durt: another reason is, to preuent theeues, and false-harted brethren, who haue spies abroad, &amp; will come 30 mile out of one Prouince into another to practise a cunning robbery. The people are generally haters of bondage, and beyond measure proud: so that the yonger brothers, and bastards, who are as deare as the other, scorne all endeuours, but liberty and warre. The Gentlewomen stomach, and in truth vilipend others, who get

their liuing by trade, merchandice, or mechanically: yet are diuers Grauers in gold and siluer, called plaine tinkers, who make their challices, harpes, buttons for their sleeues, crucifixes, and such like, in estimation amongst them. Their Noblemen, or Lords called Dynastas, are knowne by O and Mac, and euery familie hath such as minister iustice to the people, famoused by the title of Breahans, and yet the exactions ouer their tenants by way of cuttings, and other terrible impositions, haue caused diuers rebellions and insurrections amongst themselues, which when the State hath attempted to reforme, then haue they stood on their guard, and taken indirect occasions to condemne our vsurpation, whereby their odious and hatefull repinings, like a menstruous cloth, haue made their disobedience loathsome, and brought vpon them such miseries, as a calamitous warre and angry Prince inflicteth turbulent people withall. These families haue also such, as by way of historie elate them to exorbitant actions, ioyning withall the abuse of Poetry, and deceit of Physicke, knowne by the name of Bardes, on whom depend certaine harpers, rymers, and Priests, which liue in a kinred, the father instructing the sonne, or brother, and he his cosin, or friend. The name of Galliglas is in a manner extinct, but of Kern in great reputation, as seruing them in their reuolts, and prouing sufficient souldiers, but excellent for skirmish. They haue strong and able bodies, proud hearts, pestilent wits, liberall of life, subiect to incontinency, amorous, wherein their women are extraordinarily pleased, patient to endure, louers of musicke, and hospitalitie, constant to their maintainers, whether men or women, implacable in their hatred, light of beleefe, couetous of glory, impatient of reproch, or contumelie;

not thinking it yet any disgrace to receiue a nickname at their christning, as Con Oneale banco, because hee was lame. Besides, they are all extreamely superstitious, as indeed barbarous people are best obseruers of ceremonies, and when any of them enters into religion, it is admirable with what austeritie they reforme themselues: Their children are nursed abroad, and their foster-fathers and foster-mothers are as deare to them, as their owne kinred: They vse incantations and spells, wearing girdles of womens haire, and locks of their louers; they suppose idlenes a glory of nature, and by their sluttish, or rather sauage customes striue to scorne (as they say) our superfluitie: They are ready vpon any inforcement by the imposturing Art of their Bardes to innovation, as enuying our first conquest, and stomaching they were neuer able to expell vs: They are desperate in reuenge, and their Kerne thinke no man dead, vntill his head be off: They suppose theft no great offence, as imitating the Lacedemonians; for they pray to prosper in their attempts: but these be commonly the bastards of Priests, who proue notorious villaines, and the daughters either begg or become strumpets, or if you will, beggerly strumpets. They commonly intermix othes with their speeches, as by the Trinitie, God, his Saints, St Patrick, St Briget, faith, and troth, the Temple, your hand, O Neales hand, and such like. Their mariages are strange; for they are made sometimes I haue knowne of them deliuered in the morning &amp; march along with vs the same d

                              . so conditionally, that vpon a slight occasion the man taketh another wife, the wife another husband: They are easily deliuered of their children, and if they haue any by diuers men, at their deaths they resigne them to the right father; the new maried and conceiued with childe giueth the Barde her best clothes: They haue soft and excellent

skins and hands: but the small of their leggs hangeth in a manner ouer their brogs: Their apparrell is a mantle to sleepe in, and that on the ground on some rushes or flags: a thicke gathered smocke with wide sleeues graced with bracelets and crucifixes about their necks: They weare linnen rowles about their heads of diuers fashions: in Vlster carelesly wonde about: in Conach like Bishops miters, a very stately attire, and once prohibited by Statute: in Munster resembling a thicke Chesshire cheese. Their smocks are saffrond against vermine; for they weare them three moneths together; but to be lowsie is hereditarie with the best of them, and no disgrace. Both men and women not long since accustomed a sauage manner of dyet, which was raw flesh, drinking the blood, now they seeth it, and quaff vp the liquor, and then take Vsquebath: not hauing flesh they feede on Watercresses, Shamrocks, and Bonniclaboch, which is milke strangely put into a tub a sowring, till it be clodded, and curded together: when the Cow wiil not let her milke downe they blow her behinde very strangely, and sometimes thrust vp their armes to their elbowes, speaking words of gentlenes and intreaty by way of bemoning. The men weare trowses, mantle, and a cap of steele; they are curious about their horses tending to witchcraft; they haue no saddles, but strange fashioned pads, their horses are for the most part vnshod behinde: they vse axes, staues, broad swords, and darts: In Terconnell the haire of their head growes so long and curled, that they goe bare-headed, and are called Glibs, the women Glibbins. These and many other doe the meere Irish obserue with resolution and our wonderment not to be diuerted, as if the Poet should finde fault with

The raigne of Salomon, and country of Canaan, euen the best part of terrestiall paradice shall be the lanterne to light vs out of this contention. For although Ahashuerosh preuailed from India to Aethiopia ouer 127 Prouinces, and made a feast in the Pallace of Sushan to all his Princes, and subiects, which lasted 180 daies vnder a hanging of white, greene, and blew cloth, the beds of gold and siluer, vpon a pauement of porphyrie, marble, and alablaster, the drinking vessels of gold with change after change; and the Queene Vashti likewise kept the same correspondency with the women in the royall house of the King: Although Nabuchadnezar by lifting vp his eyes toward the Pallace of Babylon, elated also his heart with vaine ostentation, because he not onely had triumphed ouer Israel, tooke Iehoiachim King of Iuda prisoner, sacked Ierusalem, and caried the Princes of the Tribes into captiuitie, but might now establish the glory of the Chaldean Monarchy, and celebrate his magnificent feasts in the great Citie: Although Beltashar banqueted with the vessels of gold, wherein his Princes, his wiues, and concubines dranke before a 1000, and with magnificent brauery was aduanced on a throne to command their prostitution, when he had cause of imperiousnes: Although another Nabuchadnezar was invested in Nineuie, and after the conquest of Arphaxad and his Cities, returned to that great Towne, &amp; Pallace with a wondrous multitude, celebrating a feast 120 daies, &amp; with insulting iollity appointed Holophernes to conduct 120000 foot, &amp; 12000 horse, with all the glory of an Emperors armie against Siria and Iudea: Although Alexander the Macedonian preuailed against the forces of Asia, conquered Darius King of Medes and Persians, and compelled the tributary nations of the East

to a slauish prostitution, rewarding his endeauours with an assumpted reputation of a god-head, &amp; all the effects of wanton peace and magnificence, when hee returned to Babylon to celebrate the triumphs of his victories. Although Antiochus surnamed the Great, established his Kingdome from India to Aethiopia, and satisfied his ambition with the spoyles of Iuda, Ierusalem, and Aegypt, whereby he exposed a wonder of honourable court-ship, and illustrious gouernment. And although Octauius, for his happy successe in all his actions, was surnamed Augustus, and had those Halcion dayes, as an Emperour of peace, wherein abundance, state, and prosperity played the wantons with one another. Yet questionlesse must all instances of Emperours, Kings, maiesty and gouernment, giue place to the time and royalty of Salomon, whose prosperity ouerflowed like a swelling riuer, and filled euery empty place with fulnesse, gladnesse, and encrease: so that if you will examine me vpon interrogatories, I thus put in mine answer, and according to the true vse of an affidauit, affirme nothing but truth and plainenesse.
                     Then was Salomon in his royalty, when the Temple was built, the Priesthood confirmed, the Prophets set at Salomons royalty. liberty, and the Saints of God were had in estimation: when he erected a brazen scaffold in the midst of the court, fiue cubits long, fiue broad, and three in height, on which hee stood, and kneeled before all the congregation of Israel, when hee offered a sacrifice of 22000. bullockes, and 120000. sheepe, making a feast of seuen dayes, and all Israel with him: when he serued God truely, and permitted Nathan the Prophet, Ahiah the Silonite, and Ieddo the Seer, to pronounce the iudgements of God against the reprobate and obstinate, and divulge his mercy toward the

penitent, and true conuertist. Then was Salomon in his royalty, when hee made a porch of fifty cubits long, and thirty broad, in which hee sat to determine the controuersies of his Kingdome, whereby all sorts had accesse to the throne of Iustice, and very harlots leuiated in their greeuances. Then was Salomon in his royalty, when his owne palace was finished after thirteene yeeres labours of 160000. worke-men, to which he brought his wife, euen Pharaohs daughter: when hee was aduanced on a throne of iuory and gold, and caused a seat to bee placed for the Kings mother, &amp; rose to meet her, setling her on his right hand: when his throne had six steps, and twelue Lyons of gold, when all his drinking vessels were of gold, and siluer was nothing esteemed: when hee made two hundred targets, and three hundred shields of gold, a throne of precious stone, and couered the Ibony with the best gold: when his prouision for one day was 30. measures of fine floure, and 60. of meale, 10. fat oxen, and 20. out of the pastures, 100. sheepe, besides harts, buckes, bugles, and fat foule. Then was Salomon in his royalty, when he asked wisdom at the hands of God, and distributed equity to all his people, when hee spake 3000. prouerbs, and 1000. songs, when he related the nature of trees, plants, beasts, fowle, fishes, and creeping things, when he appoynted the Officers of his houshold, and Commanders ouer Prouinces, first 3300. then 300. lastly 250. as Princes and principall ouer the other, when the Queene of Sheba came to prooue him with hard questions, and brought him odours, golde, and precious stones: when she saw his wisdome, the house he had built, the prouision of his table, the sitting of his seruants, the ordering of his ministers, and their apparrell, his drinking-vessels, and burnt offerings, when there came

of all people to heare his wisdome, when hee excelled all the Kings of the earth in riches, and administration of equity, when hee blessed the people, and praised God in publike, giuing the Priests and Prophets liberty to maintaine the cause of the Lord of hosts, and not permitting the corruption of the world to transferre them beyond the limits of true deuotion, and religious piety, and when he so ouer-looked &amp; ouer-awed all Officers of the Kingdome, that neither the mighty made their greatnesse a bar to descend to the practise of charitable actions, nor the better sort tooke ill example by the higher to practise vnbefitting policy, or oppressions of the poore: nor the inferiour had cause of clamorous repinings, or tumultuary insurrections against the gouernment, abusing the people.
                     Then was Salomon in his royalty, when he had built cities of store, cities of chariots, cities for horse-men neere Ierusalem, when hee went in person to Hamah Zobah, and ouercame it, and re-edified Bethoran the vpper, and Bethoran the nether, cities defenced with walls, gates, and bars: when he built the cities of store in forraine parts, and walled in all places expugned and depopulated by the wars of Saul and his father, or if you will, the house of Beniamin and Iuda, contending for the Diadem. When hee had 40000. stalls of horses for his chariots, 12000. horse-men for his guard, and fortified diuers places of garison, maintaining martiall discipline, and by example of Dauids Princely rewarding men of merit, not permitting the vertue of well-deseruers to mourne for want of acceptation. Then was Salomon in his royalty, when he built a nauy of ships by the red sea, when King Hiram sent him mariners, and they were entertained for their experience, industry, and knowledge: when they went to Ophir, and brought

from thence 400. tallents of gold, when hee ioyned the nauy of Tharsus with the nauy of Hiram, which once in three yeeres brought gold, siluer, iuory, apes, and peacocks, when he had horses out of Aegypt, and fine linnen, which the Kings Marchants receiued at a price, when he went to the red sea to view his nauy, when he mustred his chariots and horse-men, marching with his armies like an Emperour indeede, and making his peaceable progresses like a magnificent Prince. Then was Salomon in his royalty, when the King of Tyrus contracted a league with him, when the Aegyptians and Moores sent him presents, and all the neighbouring Princes combined amity, and were (as it were) either emulous of his greatnesse, or proud of his friendship. Then was Salomon in his royalty, when the cities of his Kingdome were populous, opulent, and full of delight, when Iuda and Israel dwelt without feare, euery man vnder his vine and figg-tree, when they were many as the sand of the sea, eating, drinking, and making merry, when the people reioyced in mutuall entercourses, liuing with reciprocall obseruations, no man repining, no man malicious, no man iealous, no man elated, no man oppressing, no man insulting, no man ambitious, no man an Vsurer, or traduced for such raging sinnes, as commonly are supported in all gouernments by Princes fauours, conniuency of Magistrates, power of authoritie, corruption of officers, and wilfulnesse of offenders: not that the times were so cleere, and free from abuses, as if men were Angels on earth, without errours or imperfections: but that they liued in a more modest fearefulnesse for offending God, then in these presumptuous times, and durst embolden one another to make a pastime of iniquity, and vex the honest neighbour with a violent prosecution

of wickednesse: otherwise in all ages, times, and nations, as you endure at natures hands frosts, thunders, tempests, vnseasonable weather, barren yeeres, and raging invndations; her hereditary defects: so must you tolerate the vaine-glory and prodigality of Courtiers, the couetousnes of Magistrates, the legall dissembling of Citizens, the cunning of Artificers, the idlenesse of Gentle-men, the stubbornnesse of Pesants, the contumacy of Souldiers, and such like offences, as inconueniences of life, and somtimes nationall vices, or customary sinnes. And thus much for example.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. II. Countries compared to Canaan, and Salomons glorious happinesse, and first of all the Tartars.
                     
                        NOw must wee take out our other clothes to The dominion of the great Cham compared. the light, &amp; by laying them together, iudge of their finenesse, or at least, how neerely they can match our example: and although to this purpose wee neede not once name the countries of prophanation, or fill our discourses with the vnsauoury particulars of such beastly, filthy, and abominable gouernment: so farre from the method of true maiesty, and established blessednesse, as their workes of mens hands, I meane their Idols, from the omnipotency of the Creatour, or blasphemous ignorance from the translucent light of inestimable truth: yet will I not bee so partiall, or preiudicate, to cast them off without reason, or

sufficient cause of disparity. To beginne therefore with those vast and huge territories of the great Emperor Cham, now including infinite nations vnder the name of Tartarians. Vntill you come to Tangut and Mangia, all the North &amp; Western parts are stil rude &amp; vnciuill, without fashionable cities, or any formall handsomnesse, and liue in a manner as barbarously as the ancient Scythians, who to their frozen climate and distempered aire, added as frozen harts to morality and charitable workes; nay in truth, liued in all inhumane bestiality, vnder the couert of valour, and being a fierce nation to strangers, and in battell against their enemies: so that, what with their vast desarts, remote countries from Europes concourses, and want of such things, which we either desire, or stand in neede of: they are sildome visited by strangers but for curiosity, and as sildome entertaine such as come amongst them with affability and orderly welcome. Besides, according to that absolute principle, that barbarous people are best obseruers of ceremonies &amp; customs, they wil neither reform any thing which is amisse, nor conform thēselues to the decencies of our Christian cities; nay, in a manner either out of scorne or hate, their next neighbors the Turks are distasting vnto them, &amp; after a strange fashion of derision they mock at their formality, although (as I sayd in my first book) the Tartar Chrim challengeth a kinde of affinity with the race of Ottoman, and euer since Tamberlaine conquered Persia and Baiazet, haue entermingled some of their women amongst them, wherby they keep correspondency and confederation, so that when the Turke hath occasion to supply his running army, either against Persia or Christendome, they send him 100000. at a time: but so rude, naked, vnprouided, and vndisciplined, that I speake confidently,

and out of some experience, a hundred well trained and ordered souldiers will beat a thousand of them, especially if they can be first staggered with any vnacquainted sight, or strength; I meane our battalions of pikes, strong squadrons of horse, firme standings of muskets, and martiall cheerefulnesse from trumpets and drums: for they are presumptuous of nothing, but their bowes and arrowes, swiftnesse of horse-manship in pursuits, and running after preyes or spoiles, and clamorous noyse of horse, and miserable out-cries: so that at one word, neither in warre or peace, they cannot be graced with one word of our example, or Salomons happinesse. As for Tangut and Mangia, the very cause of his pride and elated titles, if there can be any pride in bestiality, or shew of magnificence in a Princes sequestration from his people; they are mighty prouinces indeed, and extend to the circling about 1500. English mile of ground, haue many and great cities, and that part toward China, is walled 800. mile, for feare of excursions of the common aduersary: but neither is their gouernment tending to the true vse of iustice in generall, nor their conuersation admitting of happy and sociable meetings in particular: for hee that is most mighty ouerswaies the weaker, and he that is most friendly, will cut your throat vpon the least susption or cause of reuenge: as for their best fortified cities, their temples, wals, store-houses, and Emperors, or Gouenors palace, are structures to be looked vpon, and onely worthy of commendation: but the rest of the houses low, vnfashionable, builded most of turffe and canes, which they buy from India and China, and in winter full of smoke and stincke, as in other remooueable cabbins or tents of the Tartars: so that except the Emperour himselfe, and his customes, which are rather tyrannous,

then princely, there is nothing amongst them worthy imitation of ruder people. For such marchandies as passe reciprocally betweene them and the Chinesses, or those of Iapan (except Rheubarb, which commonly commeth 
                           〈◊〉
                         neerer way into Europe through the Caspian sea, and so into Armenia) are euer in hazard to be lost, by the most powerfullest fraud, either of the buyer or seller: so that sometimes you shall haue 20000. marchants of Iapan, China, and the other Ilands, stayd at a time in Quinzay, Camb
                              •…
                           lu, and Tangut, whereupon the vnkindnesse bursts out into open hostility, and to be reuenged of one another, armies of 200000. and more of a side, fill their fields with terror and death, to which if you adde the aduantagious lying in wait on the wall raised vnder mount Taurus betweene them, vpon sudden excursions of the inhabitants, or breaches in the time of inuasion, it will adde a feare and terror to your attention, from the report of so many sauage slaughters, and wilfull command of the Emperours, for whose sake whole families will not care to die, nay, striue to shew their duty in this kinde: yet there is one thing most commendable amongst them, that except the warre is (at it were) publikely proclaimed betweene their Emperors, the people of themselues liue peaceably from offending one another, and dare not touch a stone on either side of the wall, with a cunning purpose to weaken the same. Amongst other things, their strife about their Emperours titles is so ridiculous (for Cham will be called Dominus Dominantium, and he of China, Filius Coeli, as in my first book may appeare) that the least derogation is breach of the peace, and a small comparison casteth vp the dust of contention in both their eyes. For although China be not so big as Tartary by two parts, yet being better inhabited and

adorned with Townes, and Cities, it presumeth for competition of glory, and dare aduenture to maintaine their honorable bestialitie, and idolatrous wretchednes both waies with force of armes. To conclude, if you come to gouernment, loue, dyet, conuersation, hansom apparell, attendancie, friendship, honest meetings, peaceable trafficke, and all such things, whereby the temporall blessings of God are manifested to men, that looke no further, nor enioy the happines to search for happines more deeply, there is not any thing otherwise, than the pride and state of their Emperor, some herbes and drugs for physicke, their northern race of horses, and certaine skins &amp; furres, which couer their houses, and keepe their bodies warme, worthy the looking after, or indeed fit to come neere the borders of the kingdome of true felicitie.

                        BEfore I proceede any further in the China farre short of Salomons happinesse. description of these remote countries, I must by way of Apologie excuse my pouertie in knowledge and breuity in bringing either par-'ticular, or substantiall matter before the barre of examination. For first I dare not meddle with ancient Authors, because times haue altred all things, and there is a kinde of vicissitude of gouernment and kingdomes

attending the highest prouidence: nor will I once read ouer moderne writers, lest I be tempted to a cunning theft, and can but shew you indeed the countenances of other men, so that if the first were now to view their owne handy-works, and either saw, how warres, or antiquitie had ouer-mantled those delicate, strong, and magnificent Cities and countries, with deuastation, misery, and wretched affliction, which they had so much commended, and laboured by great arte and industry to delineate, or decipher: Or could consider how peace and ingenious endeuours had manured, and made exuberant euen barren soiles, &amp; vnfashionable grounds, had clothed naked men with royall ornaments; had inlarged poore Townes and Cities to stately, and princely structures; had taught despised people to march arme in arme with honorable renowne, and glorious victories, with infinite such like, they would questionles stand amased to see now such a change and alteration, or confounded to suppose themselues vnhappy for not liuing in this happines, and these times of peace and plenty, yea such peace and plenty, as if they had learned an arte of gracefulnes, and cunning of adornation: like a curious and expert Ieweller, who though a diamond be a diamond, and stone of inestimable valew, yet can by his skill adde a brauery and extraordinary lustre to the same. As for the newer sort of Historiographers, first for my selfe, they shall haue no such aduantage ouer mee, as to challenge mee for felony in stealing any wealth or riches from them, or exprobrate me of ingratitude for being beholding vnto them, and not acknowledging the same: Next concerning themselues, I wonder they are not ashamed to fill vp their leaues with the lines of falshood, and maruell they are so litle acquainted

with honest trauellers, that may tell them the truth, or at least instruct them in an arte of seeming probabilitie; as for example: in plaine honestie I wonder, how Munster that learned man, and famous Chronologer, could be so deceiued or abused to talke of Pigmeies, of men with long eares, and one foote, and such like? I could name many others, as Sir Iohn Mandeuill, the description of India, diuers pamphlets of voyages, and peraduenture histories of acceptation, in which not onely absurdities passe for current, but vntruths and impossibilities carry the sway of licence, and approbation. Therefore (as I said) for my owne part, I disclaime them all, and either tye my selfe to my poore endeuours, or aduenture on such passages of ciuill authoritie, as come neere probabilitie and religion: onely in this I will play the truant with others, that as in vnknowne countries they fill vp the Map with gyants, beasts, monsters, and some strange battailes: and in writing of Chronicles they passe ouer the liues of their first Princes with only names, and peraduenture suppositions, because they would say some thing: so in these, or of these remote Nations, I will onely tell you what I haue seen my self in some cursory trauels, or learned of others, with whom by an Interpreter I haue of purpose entertained communication: As when I was in Turky I saw the Armie of the Tartars mustred by the fields of Scideret, and had the priuiledge of a Ianizarie to protect me from wrong, and be my interpreter for such things, as my wit and memory incited me to make vse of. At my L: Embassadors againe I presumed on a conference with the Persian Embassador, and as farre as my memory and vnderstanding was capable of instruction, made benefit of some relations: and going to sea to Alexandria there were

both Indians, Iewes, Arabians, and Armenians aboord, from whom I catched what I could, supplying my desire of nouelties with their discourses: of whom concerning the purpose in hand, I learnt, that China was a great and oppulent countrey in continuall warres with the Tartars, ielous one of another, and an enemy in the highest degree to all strangers, yea so farre from hospitalitie, and pious inclination to entertainment and commiseration, that they studie to circumuent their passengers, and come aboord with hypocriticall desire of satisfaction in nouelties, and then at aduantage either surprize the ships, or endanger the weaker company by ouer-mastring them, as many of our English both at the Philippines, and landing in Iapan haue had cause of testification: nor amongst themselues is there any such appearance of happines, or plenty. For though they boast of mines and many pretious stones, yet doe they vent no commodities or merchandice, but for ready money, and we are faine to carry siluer into India, from whence we receiue such things, as curious stuffe, and trifling toyes, as they are disposed to vtter. But if you come neerer them, and to our purpose indeed, as by the Indians discourses may be collected; they are ielous, malitious, want prouision, take little rest, are in tumultuous vprores, terrified with theeues, for all there is nothing so seuerely punished, dare not displease their Emperor, who is in a manner adored amongst them, liue on rootes, and kernels of nuts, and troubled with serpents, and many venemous wormes, distempred with strange tempests, and windes, terrified with apparitions and illuding visions, kill their old men, if they liue too long, make no conscience of selling their virgins for money, and filthy pr

but going to warres with the Tartars, and keeping all Nations out of their countrey. Besides, they are diuers times subiect to famine of bread, and liue vpon herbes and fruit, nor doe they conuerse one with another with cheerefull meetings, but are enuious, if any grow richer than themselues: as for the country-man, his only maintenance consists in keeping a few Bees, silke wormes, filling his gardens with gowrdes and rootes, and making a kinde of drinke of berries, and the fruit of certaine trees preserued for the same purpose: but in all things so short of our example of happinesse, as he would be of reaching heauen with a stretched-out arme, that goeth of purpose to the top of the Alpes with supposition of attaining his purpose, because the mountaine seemeth so exalted aboue the inferior ground.

                        ALthough (as I said before) concerning India commeth short of a happy countrey. these idolatrous countries, I might with Iehu cast out the Priests of Baal, breake downe the altars, and ouerthrow the idols of the heathen, and so neede not once name them for want of true religion, and acknowledging the mysterie of saluation: yet will I ouerpasse that principall point, and come to their Citie walls and plenteous fields with neerer approches of confutation:

nor shall their two summers, double increase of fruit, plentifull riuers, temperature of aire, strange wolly and tailed sheepe, great fowle, and vnheard of wormes, with rindes of trees, silkes, pretious stones, canes, and many other trifling marchandice, which they receiue for the most part by commutation out of China, terrifie me from my assertions, considering, if God send temporall blessings, and they are either not wrought vpon with comfort, and orderly profit; or abused in their vse and seruice, it were better for a kingdome not to enioy the same at all. If then in India, and the many countries and kingdomes marching vnder the flourishing colours of her prosperitie, be as many filthy customes of incontinency, that they prostitute their daughters for money, and are contented to sell their chastitie for reward, nay in sundry places to bring their virgins before beastly idols, and cause them to fill their wombe with the priapus of the same, whereat, if so be the tender maide seemeth terrified, or ashamed, the mother shall stand behinde, and thrust her most violently forward: with diuers other lamentable customes tending to abomination: how can it come neere our example, when adultery was punished with death in Israel, and there was not a whore to be found (especially by toleration) amongst the daughters of Iuda? If then in India the Kings and Princes swell against one another with tyranous ambition and reuenges, raising violent hostilitie against their neighbours and confederates, and practising horrible cruelty in their slaughters and victories: how can it come neere our example, when Salomon was denominated the Prince of peace, and confirmed a league of amitie and confederation with all adioyning Princes? If then in India the Kings and Princes suppose it a glory to

bee sequestred from their people, to terrifie them with cruell lookes and imperious controuling, not to be seene abroad, but in times of feares and terrors, to deny them orderly accesse for their complaints and greeuances, and to liue, as commanding obedience by tyranny, rather than loue: How can it come neere our example, when Salomon made a porch before his Pallace to determine the controuersies of his people in person; offred sacrifice in publike vpon an Altar, and for seuen daies feasted all commers with cheerefulnes; admitted the harlots to plead before him; and aduanced his mother on a throne by his right side in the open view of the congregation, and proclaimed free audience and accesse for all commers, that had cause of complaint, and oppression? If then in India theft and intrusion by strong hand be common matters, and howeuer there is great punishment inflicted on offenders in this kinde, as also in China, yet do they liue in continuall feare one of another, and the rich are hard-hearted against the poore, not onely suffering them to sterue without releefe, but in a manner hastning their deaths by authoritie, if either they grow aged, or impotent, and haue not of their owne to releeue their necessities: How can it come neere our example, when in Israel there was neither vagabond, or begger, no man durst remoue the marke in his neighbours field, no man oppressed his brother with vsury, and euen contrary families were entertained with mutuall entercourses; yea when nature came to challenge her due, and sent her harbinger death to demand the same, they brought the body to the graue in peace, and solemnized the exequies with a fashionable ceremonie? If then in India there is a maine want both of flesh, fish, and other prouision for the sustenance of man, especially

to feede any multitude, or satisfie the meaner sort of people, who know not, what orderly feasting, and neighbourly meetings meane: How can it come neere our example, when Salomon spent 30 oxen, with infinite other acates euery day, and the people met in abundance, eating and drinking euery man vnder his vine &amp; fig tree, and sent presents and gifts to one another with mutuall conuersation &amp; reciprocall loue: If then in India neither are the Cities hansomly contriued, nor well furnished with houses, want ciuill gouernment, and administration of iustice, if the country villages are rude, and disordered, liuing in suspition of one another for spoile and robbery, if they faile in all comelines and morall fashioning themselues to hansomnes, and good order: How can it come neere our example, where Salomon reedified the Cities of store, the Cities of fortification, the Cities of refuge, the Cities of pleasure, when Salomon had his orderly officers of visitation, and gaue commandment to ouer-looke the manifold disturbances of the kingdome, and redresse the same with a strong hand against the mighty &amp; insolent, and with a supporting arme for the poore and afflicted? If then in India they care not to visit other countries, sell their people for slaues, make marchandice of one another, barbarously scorne to gratifie other Princes, and will in no sort practise the exploration of remote countries: How can it come neere our example, when Salomon built a Nauie at the red sea, had another to ioyne with Hiram, and sent abroad for gold and other prouision into forreine nations; when he liued in peace and amitie with Pharaoh, contracted a mariage with his daughter, and maintained all the honorable customes to inlarge the glory and happines of a kingdom? And so in diuers other particulars.

For in their wants they are almost vnwilling to make triall of any fortune, considering they haue had such disastrous euents, as both the Turkes haue mightily encroached and preuailed against them. The Arabians with diuers roads and ouer-watchings haue dilacerated their gouernment, and the other countries adiacent to the Caspian sea stood at defiance with them: so that they not onely liue in continuall feare of further mischeefe, but are compelled to maintaine frontire garisons, to preuent finall ouerthrow and extirpation, and this they doe with extraordinary charge on all sides, and want indeed the martiall brauery, and forcible possibility of their former armies. In their best peace (which is now still poysoned with the dregs of mischeeuous insurrections) they are deficient in orderly traphique of marchants, in well-rigged nauies for exploration of other countries, or maintaining confederacy with remoter Princes: in pleasant and secure passages and wayes to trauell in: in cities or townes of entertainment, to lodge and repose the wearied company: in prouision of the countrey to sustaine nature, according to the blessing exposed in that kinde: in the countrey-mans honest vocation, who is heere worse then a miserable slaue: in the honourable liberty of women and conuersable meetings, who are heere debarred friendly entercourses, except wantons and strumpets, whom they inuite against festiuals, to lengthen out their pleasure, and lasciuious delight in voluptuousnesse: all which with diuers other, as there are diuers others to bee brought to the triall, if wee

should dispute the matter more forcibly, come so farre short of our example, that they are rather meer contraries, and by reason of opposition, vtterly to bee excluded from any fulnesse of reputation, or true example of a Kingdomes prosperity.

and because you shall haue pleasure in a little variety, we will thus search the wounds of this gouernment, and discouer those defects, which must needes exempt her from exemplary happinesse, how euer she may swell with a big swolne face of territories and conquests, and first concerning the cruelty and tyrannous slaughters amongst themselues.
                     To begin with the fundamentall firmnesse of their gouernment The cruell gouernment of the Turks amongst themselues. and greatnesse, and the cheefe cause of expatiating the Empire: it consisteth all in aduancing of slaues, and cutting off any one, whether brother, sonne, and sometimes the fathers, who are either a barre in the pleasant walke of their soueraignty, or giue the least cause of suspition through competition or popularity. As for the name of slaue; the greatest Viceer must acknowledge it, as the infallible position of establishment, a law ratefied by Mahomet, confirmed by custome, and strengthned through the obedience of all his vassals, as you may collect by that famous history of Mustapha, the principall Bashaw vnder Mustapha's story about Hyrena. 
                        Mahomet the first, who when hee saw the great Emperour effeminately ouercome with the loue of Hyrena the faire Greeke, and that there was suspition of ill successe in the warres, by this retardance and ouer-passionate satisfaction of pleasure, he aduentured to reclaime him from such neglect of his army, and tooke vpon him by some formall aduice, to diuert him from vilipending the Otthoman glory; but how he proceeded, with what prostitution, with how many tearmes of slaue, and miserable wretch, and how vnlookt for hee escaped with life, after hee lay groueling on the ground, as resolued to die, our common stages can relate, and the story hath pregnant authority from many famous authours, who all conclude, that how euer

he remembred himselfe, and with a sterne repining at Mustapha's audaciousnesse, with much a doe pardoned him from cruell execution: yet the beautifull Grecian shrunke vnder the stroak of a sauage hand, &amp;

                        e the next day (after a glorious shewing her with admiration to the whole armie) strucke off her head, and most barbarously, as he inferred, to satisfie the army, deliuered him and them from further suspition of his effeminatenesse: in which fury he approached Adrinopolis, &amp; neuer desisted till he had laid it prostrate before him. But if you would be acquainted with the true condition of their tyranny &amp; imperiousnes, then looke vpon the new admission of their Emperours, into the sublime chaire of Maiesty, and you shall heare him commanding all his brethren to bee strangled before him, except one; reserued, if the time allow it, for propagation of children, who likewise vpon the Turkes suppliment that way, shall miscarry by one meanes or other: yea, sometimes it happens, that when the aged father, or eldest brother is contented to admit of his sonne or yonger to the coparcinary of administration, or if you will, absolute power in the Empire, by reason of impotency, age, lunacy, or other naturall defects, they are most inhumanly rewarded with death, as Zelimus poysoned his father Baiazet, and the sonnes of Soliman the Magnificent shouldred one another into the pit of destruction.
                     Concerning the subiect; nobility they neuer suffer in continuall discents, nor permit any man to grow rich, mighty, or popular, otherwise then may stand with the pleasure of the Emperour, which is apparant by the destruction of many worthie Bashawes and Seruitours, who (when the Doctors of the Law haue concluded the matter by priuate conference) are commonly carried by a

confessing that Mordecai had not bin rewarded; but secret politicians supplied the roome, intimating still and still matter against him, which kindled the fire of the Emperors ielousie to such a blaze, that nothing but his personall appearance could quench the same.
                     When the Viceer perceiued the danger of such ouerwatchings, and began to be acquainted with too many princely messages, he absented himselfe a while, and with dilatory excuses laid as it were open his suspition of the Emperors ielousie against him, whereupon followed an obstinate deniall of comming, lest the affaires of the kingdomes might be intermitted; and when that serued not the turne, he determined to stand on his guard, till at last the Gran Signeur was aduised not to regard him at all: whereupon the Mufti was called to councell, which is their principall Churchman, who together with diuers Doctors of their law resolued, that he was too dangerous to liue, and yet policie must be vsed in cutting him off: When the foundation of this building was laid, letters were contriued from the Prince vnto him deceitfully importing thus much: That he had great cause to be thankfull to the great Prophet Mahomet for his indulgent care ouer the house of Ottoman, euen in these suspitious times to prouide, that a man of such courage, wisdom, and magnanimity gouerned the sterne of the ship of his affaires, &amp; like a discreet pilot knew how to conduce the barke of the Common-wealth to safe harbour. He accordingly assumeth the glory to himselfe, with full resolution, that either the yong Prince durst not finde fault, or nothing was fault-worthy, like Aesops asse, who supposed, that the Lyon would be terrified with his braying. For at last he came to the Emperors presence into the Seralio, who was

taught to entertaine him with a politicall acceptation, which lasted a while, and with the continuance of 14 daies seemed to wipe out the print of former vnkindnes: But when the day of his fatall destruction approched, (after the yong Prince had bin a hawking, and meeting with certaine inhabitants of Bogdonia, and the borders of Russia, who made petition vnto Him for diuers redresses, gaue them a kinde of audience) hee was sodenly sent for to a priuate conference, which he verily supposed, according to some speciall inferences, tended to that purpose: nor did he once rebate the glory of his former iollity, but went at least with 300 Ianisaries, and his other officers toward the gates of the Seralio, where by the way the Haga or Captaine of the Ianisaries met him to tell him, how the Prince was retired to a Caska by the sea side, and he must goe through the garden, and enclosure of Roe-bucks vnto him, which he performed accordingly, and neuer seemed once staggering in his resolutions, till he came to the yron gate, and saw his company prohibited to enter, and the gate fast barred, as soone as he was admitted.
                     Here he must needs passe through a guard of Capogies, who demanded his Semiter, which he furiously denied, and with increase of rage and choller railed vpon them all. But they being too well instructed to forbeare any such opprobrious speeches, spared a reply of words, and tooke an opportunitie to ouer-master him with the company, who most cruelly cut him all to peeces: yet some would raise the Emperors ielousie from a suspition of loue to his mother, who taking a fitting opportunitie, as was imagined, came with him to admonish her sonne from his pederastria, or accompanying with boyes, but belike they performed it with vnseasonable wisdome; for in his furie he

spurned her away, and bad him remember, he was but a slaue. Some report that the first motiue of the Emperors displeasure was occasioned by reason of his buildings, which ouer-looking some priuate walkes in the Seralio, was both irkesome to the maiestie of the Prince, and a dore to let in his euerlasting hate, to which there wanted not the seuerall suggestions of many flatterers, and temporizers. But let his death, and the cause be what it will, there is no gaine-saying their wilfulnes, nor moderating their rage and tyrannie, witnes his fathers killing of his elder brother, a Prince of great expectation: but comming one day (though he did it with reuerence and teares in his eyes) to put him in remembrance of the Ottoman glory, and inlarging the Empire, which euery Prince had done sauing himselfe, the admonition was so vnsauoury, or the ielousie of his vertues so forcible, that he beat him to death with his owne hands, to the amase of all the Ianisaries and soldiers: insomuch that the grandmother, a woman of excellent parts, who is yet liuing, had like to haue perished in the hurly-burly. To which may be added, this yong Princes dislike of one of his Concubines, whom he shot to death in his gardens. I could here insert many other stories of their cruelty, and tyrannous supplanting one another, murthering Bashawes, destroying Princes, and letting loose the streames of all rage, wilfullnes, and distemperature: but you will say I gleane but out of anothers haruest, and time is too pretious to spend it in idle relations, I will therefore leaue you to the originall, and only for the strangenes make a breuiate of Mustapha's tragedy, who was so cruelly murthered by an intemperate Prince, intoxicatedby the cunning of a malitious strumpet.
                     
                        
                        The famous historie of MVSTAPHA.
                        
                        
                           SVltanus Soliman surnamed the Magnificent, amongst The lamentable tragedy of Mustapha. many others had one beautifull Concubine called Rozza, or Roxalana, but more properly Hazathia, on whom he so doted in his later times, that all amarous dalliance with the rest was neglected for her sake, as if pleasure and delight attended her, though shee were but his slaue. Thus he so followed the humors of this wanton woman, that at last the noble Prince Mustapha his eldest sonne was prohibited his presence, and his former children slightly regarded, in respect of hers: which when shee had fully apprehended, and politikely entertained, the next businesse was to make vse of the same, yea such vse, as cunning fauourites, and newly aduanced officers contriue, who suspecting some sudden alteration, and perceiuing the Prince cannot last long, care not by what meanes they enrich themselues, and many times runne in the race of indirect courses to establish their hopes.
                        Wherevpon shee wonde vp her wilfulnes on the pestilent bottome of Rustan Bashawes ambition, who had maried her daughter, and hauing likewise corrupted the principall Mufti to second her enterprise, they all combined a league of amitie, and proiected to cast the Empire on her owne sonnes: which was no sooner ratified, and confirmed betweene them, but on a sudden shee became very deuout, and being rich with the fauours and presents bestowed vpon her, proposed a meritorious worke for her soules health by erecting some religious monument or Mosque, which was intercepted by the high Priest, as

discouering the invaliditie of the same, because shee was yet a slaue, and therefore laboured in a busines, whose merit and effects must tend to the good of another. This caused such a dissimiled pensiuenes, that Soliman himselfe was in a manner exanimated to behold the darling of the world in such a confusion and heauines: shee againe well lessond how to act her part, filled the scene with teares of disconsolation, related all occurrences from the beginning, and finely vrged, how her godly zeale had certaine obstacles, which must be remoued, ere her former alacrity could gaine the field of this sullen meditation and vntoward sadnes: whereupon the Doctors and Interpreters of the Alcaron were sent for, and commanded to deliuer the truth without praeuarication, who thus animated, discouered the secret most plainely, and with impudent asseuerations concluded, that she had iust cause to complaine, &amp; insist on the meanes to procure her redress, which made such impression into the ouer-worne heart, and easily-perswaded disposition of the Emperor, that he presently manumitted hir, &amp; by sound of trumpet proclaimed her freedome, and so cheered her, that he might the better reioyce in her company. But when shee had thus raised her selfe vpright vpon the honorable steps of liberty, shee stood vpon higher termes, and was not ashamed to assure him there was another lesson to be taken out, than now to dally with her as his slaue: for being free it was against the law of Mahomet to be commanded as a strumpet, and therefore, how euer he could dispence with religion, and ouer-awe the same, shee would not, nor durst betray her soule, as a delinquent in such impiety: yet she prostrated her life before him, and was ready to yeeld her necke to the blocke, if so it pleased him to inforce it. Here againe

were the Doctors summoned, who maintained her cause, and with exceeding admiration at her piety and zeale fell humbled on the ground before him, with request not to cast her headlong to destruction, and damne her soule for euer, which so enflamed him, as Nititur inuetitum, that without looking aduisedly on the pretended mischiefe, and searching too narrowly in the closet of her deuises, in a foolish passion he solemnely married her.
                        This is that she long expected, and raising her thoughts with her fortunes, after much variety and infinite passages Looke the Commentary, and Lettere de principe in Italian. in the Common-wealth, she now studied nothing but the aduancement of her family; which could not be done vntil the worthy Prince Mustapha his eldest sonne by a former wife was thrust into a slaughter house, she quickly brought him into the danger of suspition (for euen good Princes are iealous in points of soueraignty) and cunningly inferred, that she affected not his popular loue, his great concurses, his strengthning of Amasia, his entertaining of Embass: from Tartary, his taking vp such beautifull virgins out of Georgia and Mengrelia, with diuers other probabilities, that he determined a present enlarging of his greatnesse: which was as quickly apprehended; as politickely vrged, and nothing could satisfie the Emperor, but the present sending for Mustapha, who although he was forewarned of the mischiefe, and aduised to stand on his guard with full resolution, that the army was firme vnto him: yet remembring it was his father commaunded, and how obedience was a duty befitting a sonne; but principally laying a firme foundation on a cleare conscience, and an vncorrupt heart, he came to Constantinople, but was welcomed as Husbandmen doe their cattle into pleasant fields for to make them the more fit for the Butcher. Thus

followed the tragedy of this noble and worthy Prince made the tennis ball of Fortune, the misery of a doting iealous man, the florishes of an impudent cunning woman, the vanity of an ambitious idle Bashaw, and the hypocrisie of a deceitfull imposturing Priest. For the Father strangled his sonne the iewell of the Empire, and perished after the action with vntimely griefe. The villanous woman raised her sonnes to the dignitie; but they quickly supplanted one another, which tumbled her into the pit of destruction. The Bashaw shrunke vnder the pressure of confusion: the Priest was disappointed and strangled; and the whole gouernment tossed with the tempestuous billowes of distruction.
                     
                     
                        The Story of a Rennegado Bashaw.
                        IN the raigne of Amurath the third this mans father there was a certaine Rennegado Dutchman aduanced to the dignitie of a Bashaw; for so they call Christians, who abiure their religion at mans estate, and are circumcised according to the Law of Mahomet. Where by the way you must consider of that mischieuous position not to dispute of either law, gouernment, or ceremonies of their religion, but absolutely allow of the great Prophet, and the Alcaron as infallible verity, wherein the Romane Byshoppes tread the same measures, and interdict any man from calling their actions in question, not suffering vs to read the Canon of Gods law, nor once dispute in matters of faith, but to confirme the power of the Church as of sufficiency to direct vs in the way of truth: a most diuellish, and repugnant conclusion against God and his word, who commaundes vs to search the Scriptures, and try the spirits.

But to our Story. This Bashaw liuing in great pompe to the outward show, seemed yet much excruciated in minde with meditation on the latter iudgement, and the sauing of his soule, whereupon he communed with one of his principall slaues to the same purpose, admitting all freedome of speech, and animating him so farre to deliuer his opinion, that at last hee attempted his patience in this sort. Sir you know, or at leastwise should know, that God at the first did chuse vnto himselfe a people called the Iewes, giuing them a law, priesthood, and Prince named The doctrin of the Deruices or mendicant Priests of Turkie. 
                           Moses, who questionlesse is the Mediator still in heauen for honest Iewes imploring his assistance on earth; but when this wretched people despised the blessings of so great a God, falling to idolatry, and other horrible abuses, they were cast out of fauour, and vanished like smoake, or if you will, resembled, water spilt on the ground neuer to be gathered vp againe. Then did God select another nation called Christians, and admitted of their worthy acknowledgement of Iesus Christ, whom they suppose God and man, and borne of a Virgin, and in whom still the good Christian beleeueth; this caused their increase of wealth, maiesty, and greatnesse, till at last growing wanton with prosperitie, they tooke the same or worse courses with the Iewes, and by degrees became flat Apostates, so that God was weary of them likewise, &amp; gaue a third nation power to thrust them from their firmenesse, and disiointed their established foundation of religion, and happinesse: which was acted by the hands of Turkes, who succeeded them, and had likewise their Prophet Mahomet to instruct and direct them to loue the great God of heauen more religiously than the others, from whose supportation the maiesty you now behold, spreadeth the wings of glory

ouer the imperiall Citties both of Iewes, and Christians, namely, Ierusalem and Constantinople: nay, if you looke into Asia, we haue Tauris and Babilon; and in Egipt possesse Cairo or Memphis, and Alexandria: so that no doubt we shall multiply blessing vpon blessing, if wee continue confident toward him, and his elected Prophet; otherwise some strange and barbarous nation shall expell and extirpate vs, as we haue vsurped ouer others. Thus then you see with what successe these three religions haue bin caried in the current of estimation both with God and man; namely the Iewes, who haue Moses to make intercession for them: The Christians, who haue IESVS their Mediator; and Mahumetans, who depend vpon the merits and exaltation of Mahomet. But for you, that are of no religion, nay, haue denied the faith, wherein you were borne and baptised, there is sure no redemption, but the Deuill himselfe to fetch you away. Which answere was so distasting, although as you heard, it went vnder safe conduct, that the tyrannous Lord not onely commaunded him to be broken on a wheele to shiuers, but inflicted many Christian slaues in his house with the like punishment, and thus much for their crueltie amongst themselues: now you shall see their behauiour toward Strangers.

                        WHen Mr BARTON was Agent for the English in Constantinople, as he passed along to This was in the time of Amurath the third. the Viceers vpon occasion of busines, the great Empresse this mans Grandmother, (For Amurath the third his father was but a young man, when he died) came of purpose to see him, formerly moued with a commendatory report of his virtues and personage by diuers iudicious Turkes. Whereupon she promised her fancy some satisfaction, which not to be performed without a formall looking vpon him, she was somewhat appeased, that this occasion was ministred; but finding it farre short of a fulnesse, another interueiw was contriued, and the Scene acted in the house of a Iewe, to whose wife she came disguised to bargaine for certaine pearle, after which in the affaires of the Merchants she countenanced him extraordinarily, and had at last priuate conference with him, giuing so way vnto their opinion, that supposed the secret passages of kindenesse betweene them, which was no sooner published, and entertained amongst the Bashawes for current, but shortly after he died, not without suspition of poison, and our English affaires had vntoward alteration, as the hanging of our Consull at Alexandria, the imprisoning of diuers in the blacke Tower, a place neere Pompeis pillar at the mouth of the euxine sea, especially Arnald and Stranguish,
                        
who lay there long for their ransome; the terrible insulting ouer slaues committing all to their gallies without respect of persons; the denying of our former right in the admitting of Merchants into the sacra Porta vnder the bandiers of England, and giuing the precedency to France; the raising of customes, the office being farmed by the Iewes; the abusing of Trauellers and other of our Countrey men by Ianisaries, and Mechanicks of Stanbole: the customary calling vs Christians dogges, not daring once to returne an vnsauory answere; with diuers such like exorbitant abuses.
                     In the time of Master Henry Lisso the Prouinces of Bogdonia and Moldauia were at strife about the establishment Prince of Moldauia. of a Gouernour; but at last condescended to an vsurper, which caused the banishment and flight of the true Princes, whereby they were compelled to seeke for succour vnder English protection at Constantinople, being Protestants, or at least willing to admit of our reformation; but whether feare, or corruption preuailed, he was to the great indignity of our Nation not onely discouered, but taken away perforce euen out of our Embassadors house, and very disorderly committed to the seuen Towers prisoner, from whence by the helpe of Signior Gasparo Gratiano a man for speciall vses entertained amongst the English, whose brother and sister were both taken and admitted amongst the Turkes, being formerly Christians of Transiluania, or Austria; he escaped: but some disastrous fortune returned him backe againe into the hands of apprehenders, who with a more powerfull restraint sent him to the castells; from whence once againe through the fauour of a Turkish woman he got his liberty, and escaped into Poland; but there hee taried not long,

both in regard of their iealosie of him to discouer their proceedings, and his suspition of them for some treacherie against his life, or at least his liberty, and so he passed to the Emperour, where finding small reliefe, hee came through France into ENGLAND, and there saw the difference between other Nations concerning the entertaining of strangers. For he was not onely admitted with correspondency to his estate, but had letters of credit to the Gran Signeur for his reestablishment, with sufficient inducement to our merchants to lend him 10000. duckets, vpon the least hope of his better successe. In his absence his mother with great expence and gifts elaboured his restitution, but greater summes as it should seeme weighed downe the other scale of his respect, or the fortune of happier men preuailed against him. For after she had spent 20000. duckets, tasted the misery of contempt, importuned my Lord Embassador, I meane Sir Thomas Glouer, in the busines, and saw the affliction of Petitioners fed with dilatory excuses, she very impatiently attended the good hower of her sonnes returne, and was terrified to experience with what extremities men deiected must wrastle, especially when he came indeed, and was not onely repulsed in his suite, but entertained with scorne and contempt. Where is now the Turkish ostentation of supporting the innocent, and distributing of iustice to all sorts of people?
                     When Soliman Catanea was Bashaw of Algier, Master Christopher Willoughby a Gentleman and Merchant of Mr Christopher Willoughby. LONDON had his shippe and goods seazed on most iniuriously to the valew of 50000. duckets, whereof many complaints were made, and diuers letters from the Councell of ENGLAND in his behalfe; but still distasting answers

were returned, procrastinating the matter, and affording much suspition of not preuailing in his recouery: whereupon he went another way to worke, and made the principall Viceer acquainted with the same, betweene whom and Catanea he vnderstood was a little grudging: so that when he had promised him 5000. pieces of gold, and laide open his grieuances, that they seemed vnanswerable, he was remooued from his gouernment, and by a missiue commission cited to Constantinople. But it should seeme all this was but forme; for in Zio the counsell of his friends diuerted his appearance, and the power of his presents reconciled the Viceer, who contrary 
                           •…
                        o expectation sent him to Tunis as Gouernour, not onely neglecting his former promises and prosecution of the busines, but in a manner deriding their importunity, who complained against a Turkish Bashaw. Master Willoughby euery way vnsatisfied made it a new suite, and with letters both from King and Councell came himselfe to Constantinople, and there sollicited the cause, preuailing so farre by Sir Thomas Glouers meanes, that the Bashaw was at last mansuold, and condemned to pay the money, or loose his head: But this was still the ordinary manner of satisfaction, when Christians demaund iustice against Turkes; for the Gentleman was onely protracted with good words, but in a manner despaired of further preuailing, and so hee remained euery way discontented.
                     The Vineyard a shippe of London, where of Harris was Master, hauing Turkes and Turkish goods abord, 1605. The Vinyard taken by the Maltasses. was surprized by the Maltasses, which although it fell to the losse and displeasure of our Merchants, yet bred it great vnkindnesse euen in Constantinople by forcible inducements, how the shippe was rather betraied by the

treachery of the English, then surprised by inequality of fight, so that the Emperour as young as he was, (for hee was then scarce fully 16.) commaunded in a fury to set fire on all our shippes in harbour, and threatned the Merchant with further inflictings, not once admitting either of excuse or iustification, whereupon that night (for all the Viceers and Mufties opposition) one of them was burnt indeed, whether by chance or of purpose, I may not dispute, such is the tyrannie of their gouernment, and misery of men vnder their subiection.
                     
                        Edward Conach a Merchant resident at Aleppo, when Edward Conach. Master Paul Pindar was Consull ioyned with a Frenchman in a bargaine of galles to the valew of 12000. dollers, which they bought of a Moore: the money was no sooner paide, and the commodity ready to be housed, but a certaine Turke perswaded the Moore, that he was cousoned in the weight, who still replied to the contrary, confessing himselfe much satisfied, and a great gainer in the traphique; but at last ouer-ruled by the suggestion, and villanous instigation, they made it a matter of complaint before the Bashaw, who with an apprehensiue anger entertained the same, as glad of any occasion to quarrell with a Christian, especially a Merchant, from whom money might be extorted; whereupon he sent for the officer, that weighed the galles, and so vrged the matter against him, that whether right, or wrong, hee was broken on a wheele all to pieces, and after many wordes of reproach calling vs dogges, and deceitfull wretches, the Consull had a terrible commaund to put in execution the like exemplary iustice on the Merchants. But hee perceiuing a trecherous conueiance of the busines, procrastinated the Sessions, had not the Ianisaries and common Turkes exclaimed

against our retardance, and vrged, that seeing the Officer suffred death there should be either a commutation of liues, or full restitution, which in the end cost 10000. dollers, 6000. for the French, and 4000. for the English, a summe that stopped the mouth of fury, and brought the Tigre at last to more lenity.
                     About the 20. of October 1607. the Viceer, that came The Viceer of Arabia. from Arabia, and had beene resident before in Gran Cairo presented the Emperour and rest of the Bashawes with many rich iewels, by which occasion the opinion of his inestimable wealth filled very quickly the dangerous eares of Repiners, and diuers murmured against him, as if hee grew too mighty for a subiect; nay, there wanted not malicious instruments to sound out the harsh discord of his ouerthrow by traducing him for many sinister actions in his gouernments; for ambitious insinuating into vulgar respect; for attempting to winne the Ianisaries by vaineglorious expences; for releasing of slaues, in whom another man had a propriety; for repining at the former Viceers supplantation; for complaining on the Emperours vicious louing of boyes, with such like: all which added but fewell to the fire, which at last consumed him. For within two daies hee was found dead, some said of the plague, some that he was strangled, some poysoned, and some that he entertained two vnwelcome guests griefe and discontent: Howsoeuer, his goods, treasure, children, houses, and all belonging vnto him, were seazed vpon to the Gran Signeurs vse, which confirmed their opinion, that supposed him murthered for his wealth.
                     The shippe of the Iohn Baptist being in Zio about the beginning of Nouember the same yeare, was searched by Turkes for the Cooke, vpon a supposition, that hee was

confederate with a French slaue about his escape; but he denying the accusation was imprisoned, had his hands almost flead, and suffered great torment to enforce a confession. At last meere hunger compelled the Offender to discouer himselfe, and most voluntarily to lay the guilt vpon his owne shoulders, whereby the Englishman was after great suite discharged, otherwise no doubt he had felt the effect of Turkish iustice.
                     In the yeere 1605. amongst other Trauellers, and searchers for nouelties out of curiosity, a French Gentleman presumed to tell the artillery, and canons before the Tapinaw, as they lay by the sea shore, which was taken for so great an offence, that he had a 100. blowes giuen him on the feete according to the manner of such reuenges, and not dismissed without great intercession of the Embassadour. These and many other instances of their tyrannous gouernment would fill whole volumes, and make easie collections the discouerers of their incongruity betweene Salomons magnificense, peace, plenty, administration, wisedome, affabilitie, vprightnesse, and good orders; and their pride, contentions, wants, confusions, diuellish policy, tyrannie, wrested constructions, and wilfulnesse: so farre from the example of happines, and methode of a well setled Common-wealth, that I will absolutely disclaime the naming of any true goodnesse amongst them, not that I touch the maine point of religion in denying the Godhead of Christ, an argument of sufficiency to debarre him from worldly and terrestriall happinesse, but that many heathenish reasons of firmely setled kingdomes disalow his vsurpation, and strangely compacted tyranny tending to nothing, but wilfulnesse in themselues, and slauery ouer others, all proceeding from his challenges

                        militari iure, and that the Disposer of Kingdomes would humble vs from any ostentation of a perpetuity on earth.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. VIII. Their manner of aduancement, and diuersitie of customes farre from our example, and orderly prosperitie.
                     
                        OVr former allegations haue maintained, The Turkish gouernment deficient in exemplary goodnesse, or happines. that the Turkish Empire is corroborated by the absolute will of the Prince, and wretched duty of the subiect; for he pulleth downe and aduanceth whom he pleaseth, and without sense or reason debarreth any man from pleading in his owne behalfe, or contesting with authoritie, if so be, he will not haue it so; otherwise, there is a certaine shadow of vprightnesse amongst them; an approaching to honor by degrees, and spreading the faire colours of some good customes, though farre short of our example: all which in in this Chapter shall be for diuers reasons enlarged. You must then consider, that euery second or third yeare his Officers range ouer all his kingdomes, and territories for slaues, Moores, and Eunuchs, but especially for the beautifullest and handsommest children they can finde, being all the sonnes and daughters of Christians, who accordingly are brought into his seuerall Seralios by 20. and 30000. at a time, and there from their infancy instructed in the Law of Mahomet, circumcised, and disposed of without

knowledge of parents, friends, or countrey, except some Eunuch or Keeper out of meere commiseration discouer the same; so that all his Concubines, Wiues, Officers, and souldiers are the off-springs of Christians depending immediately on the Princes Exchequer, and pensions, not acknowledging other God, other law, other religion, other King, other Benefactor, or other life (except in the story of George Castriot, who rebelled against him, after he knew his father was a Christian, and King of Epirus, which we may briefly runne ouer thus. When Amurath the 2. had conquered Epirus, with many other places of Seruia, Bulgaria, and Albania, he tooke prisoners The story of Scanderbeg, and why he was so called. with him to Adrinopolis the King, and fiue of his sonnes, whom he tormented most barbarously vpon some distasting reply of the old Prince by putting out their eyes, and at last strangling them, except the youngest named George, whom he so fancied in his infancie, that he presently circumcised him, instructed him in the Law of Mahomet, and kept him secure in his owne pallace, vntill a mighty Champion of Persia made a challenge to fight with any Turke for the honour of both Empires hand to hand, starknaked, and with single Semiters: wherein as the motiue might be honourable enough, so the manner seemed ridiculous; yet so formidable, that for three daies together he insulted round about the Court without a daring answerer, or any man who durst take the matter in hand; at last this George Castriot out of some diuine inspiration, and generous spirit, stepped foorth in the presence of the Emperour, not fully 18. yeere old, and without procrastinating the matter, stripped himselfe before them, and made them as much amazed at the beautifulnes

                        , and comelinesse of his person, as greatnesse of courage, and

shaking his sharp and glistring curtelax triumphantly ouer his head, approached the Persian, who by this time was prepared to the encounter, and in lesse then one quarter of an houres trauersing the ground, closed with him, wrastled with him, stradled ouer him like a Colossus, after hee had layd him on his backe, and strucke off his head: for which hee was presently embraced in his sweat by the great Emperour, inuested with a robe of honour, proclaimed by the sound of a trumpet Scanderbeg, quasi Alexander Magnus, and aduanced to the dignity of Generall of the army: Therfore I wonder at their ignorance, or slender enformation, which haue published in print, that it was a name of scorne and derision; when we neuer read of so famous an action, and so high a recompence, wherein hee proceeded more and more, with loue of the army and regard of the Prince, till indeed an Eunuch, rauished with his worthinesse, discouered what he was, and opened at large his fathers story vnto him, whereat hee startled, as it were confounded, and neuer desisted, till he had perswaded the army to reuolt, and so obtained his Kingdome, making war against the Turke seuenteene yeere together, as in the larger stories may appeare. But to the businesse in hand.
                     The naturall Turke they call Muscellman, and he seldom comes to preferment: but liues as a trades-man in cities, The degrees of the Turks husbandman in the countrey, or mariner at sea: yet, for the most part, are all your gally-slaues Christians, and ouerlooked by the cruell eyes of hard-hearted masters, the rest cast vp their account in this manner. At the beginning they are called Gimoglanes, or Azamoglanes, resembling 1 poore hospitall-boyes, doing all manner of drudgery, both in court &amp; the houses of Bashawes, and are known by a plaine habit and strange hat on their head, which is a

felt like a suger-loafe, of a maiden-haire colour.
                     The second degree is of Ianizaries, whose Haga or Captaine is a most honourable, though dangerous place. Of 2 these be two sorts: of the court, limited in their numbers; and at large without restraint, as alwaies mustred for chiefe souldiers in the army: yea, as (a man may say) the principall beame of the whole Empires frame. For from their suffrages and obedience, the Gran Signeur is confirmed: from their repinings, disorders are multiplied: from their partiality, a sonne deposeth a father: and from their mutinies confusion riseth, and like a swelling sea casteth downe the bankes of all gouernment.
                     The third sort are Capogies, employed as porters of gates, purseuants on errands, attenders on the Viceers, as 3 they sit at meat in their great Dowana's, which be open hals trauersed, as occasion shall serue with Persian hangings, and sometimes trusted with secret murthers, and such like dangerous businesse.
                     The fourth place is appropriate to the Spahyes, who are inferiour horse-men, with high fethers in their strange fashioned 4 hats, somewhat more glorious then the Ianizaries, their arming, as also the Ianizary, keepes some correspondency with the Persian. On foot, either bow and arrowes, and a semiter, or hargabush and a semiter: on horse-backe the very same, with addition of a shield made of sinewes, or the barke of an Indian tree, cast behinde at their backs, with addition of a pollax, hatchet, or iron mace, which are made like scepters: but, for the most part, none presumes to weare them vnder the degree of a Chiaus, who haue them in the city of siluer for shew, and of steele for execution.
                     The fift roome is supplyed by the Chiaus, a degree of 5
                        
honourable eminence and may ranke with our Barons. For they ride in veluet gownes, siluer-plated saddles, costly stirrups, and rich turbanes: with these I may almost equall the Captaines of castles, forts, frontire townes, bands of foot, cornets of horse, and such like Commanders, known by the name of Haga's. Heere also, though hee seeme to step a little higher, may be seated the Cady, who is a Iudge or Magistrate ouer criminall causes, ouer whom there is one principall called Cadeleskier, as our Lord cheefe Iustice, in some places they haue also Sub-Bashawes according to his Sansacks, Trimatriots, or countrey diuisions, either for maintaining his armies, or prouision ouer his cities. Then may you name with a little better reputation the Treasurer called Testerdy, ouerseer of customes, which is an office farmed by the Iewes, his Chancellor, Doctours of the Law, and such like.
                     On the sixt step ofhonour is the Bashaw lifted vp, who is a principall Viceroy, or at least hath beene, ouer Kingdomes 6 and Countries, such as Arabia, Aegypt, Tauris, Tunis, and diuers others, both in Asia, Affricke, and Europe, and Beg, in Turkish is great or honourable. according to the dignity and maiesty of the place called Beglerbeg: these are euery three yeeres mansuold, that is to say, remooued. For as they be subiect to strange ouerseers, so they are not permitted to grow rich, and indeed seeme iealous of their liues and estates, if any extraordinary fortune or greatnesse be imposed vpon them, except the Bashaw of Aleppo, who either is so permitted to haue, or maketh his place hereditary, daring sometimes to doe actions befitting an absolute Prince.
                     The last and greatest place of account is a Viceer, who commonly exceede not fiue in number, besides the Generall 
                        7 of the army, who is principall, these bee they that gouerne

the Empire, and to whose trust all matters depending in controuersie are committed. But you must consider, that times haue altred their first strictnesse, when in the inchoation of goodnesse they resolued on a perseuerance &amp; stedfastnesse. For amongst the best of them, abuse hath bespotted that faire promising countenance, and ouer-vailed that beauty, which shewed true Iustice, punished extortion, and made adultery one of their haynousest offences, with fowle deformity, and new fashions of impiety. And thus much for their persons. Now to their customes, and generall conditions.
                     The Turkes, by the law of their Alcaron, should drinke nothing but water, or water mixed with honey, which they The manners of Turks, and their gouernment. call sherbert: yet the better sort haue certaine Iuliups, which be syrups of roses, violets, and such like, of which a spoonfull or two will season a pinte of water, and is not onely pleasant in taste, but powerfull enough in operation: they shaue all their head, sauing one tuft on the crowne, superstitiously imagining to bee pull'd vp to heauen thereby: they maintaine their beards with great formality and cost, and haue them in such reputation, that they sweare by them: they sildome doe any thing in vaine, or speake an idle world, but in a substantiall grauity passe the time, euen at their pleasure and sports: they sit crosse-legg'd, and so commonly eat on the ground, or higher bench: they hate prophanation, and will not suffer Christ to be ill spoken of. Their religion generally carries a reuerent shew, but no substantiall commendation, as allowing God Omnipotent, a father, inuincible, and creator of the world, and Iesus Christ as the Prophet of his time, as Moses had beene before, but haue opinion that Mahomet was sent to them, as the last Mediator, with promise ofreturne to consummate

their eternity after 1000 yeeres, which time is almost expired, whereupon hee enrolled a booke called his Alcaron, in which he bound together, both lawes touching religion, and precepts for ciuill administration, with prohibition of disputing on their probability, and warrantize of the flourishingest Common-wealth vnder the sunne, vpon their obseruation; coniuring them to a strict obedience, if euer they hoped to thriue in glory and terrestriall maiesty, and attaine the blessednesse of an immortall Kingdome, and a trebled felicity in the world to come: wherein hee imitated Lycurgus, who compelled the Lacedemonians, and bound them by oath to the resolute keeping his instructions, vntill his returne, which they ratefied by a solemne vow, whereupon coniecturing the subsequent good, hee banished himselfe for euer; or, as some suppose, threw himselfe from a cliffe of Olympus. The like wee reade of Empedocles, but with greater suspition of ambition, as indeede affecting a god-head, who cast himselfe into the Crateres of Aetna, after hee had combined the Sicilians to the iudicious allowance of his decrees.

Amongst these the order of Deruices or Turners are of greatest account, as men liuing a contemplatiue life, and no way transported with mundane affaires. They celebrate diuers religious dayes, especially Friday, and haue many ceremonies of preaching, musike &amp; solemne silence: concluding their seruice with a strange turning about, encreased by degrees from a slow stillnes to a violent circular whirling, pa

to the modulent sound of certaine instruments, which haue a primordiall solemnity, and so by little and little encrease to a swiftnesse, in which time they with strange gestures looke vp to heauen, and when they haue done thus a quarter of an houre, all in a sweat they fall groueling to the ground, and haue certaine garments cast ouer them, to preuent taking of colde; then after a while they beginne againe, and so foure times together: the looking vp hath relation to extraordinary visions, and that they are rauished with high inspiration, forgetting the world, and all affaires in the same: the prostitution on the ground would acknowledge the vilenesse of mans creation, and their humility to consider of the same: they obserue the ceremonie of praying for the dead, bewailing their losse, and bemoaning ouer the graues; they repaire to their Mosques or Temples foure times a day, and on Friday fiue: and they haue a solemne fast and a solemne feast, called Ramdam and Byrame, much about our Alhallow-tide, at which time their Mosques, and the turrets, are solemnely furnished with burning lamps night and day, fiue weekes together: with diuers other particulars, much like the absurd ceremonies, both of Greeke and Romish Churches, consisting all in forme and outward adoration, as you shall heare anone.
                     They circumcise the men, &amp; in Arabia cut their women, they sell all things by weight, write Bias, like the ancient Arabians and Chaldeans, read backward as the Iewes, and obserue many other customes of Moses Law. For their women are sildome or neuer seene abroad, except the meaner sort, who yet couer head and face (sauing their very eyes: what rich apparrell soeuer shee weares, the outward garment is a long cloth gowne with wide sleeues,

breeches, boots, or rather buskins, and an ill-fashioned tire on their heads: their hands are without gloues, their nailes and eye-browes painted, which they learnt of the Greekes, and all outward appearance most vncomely; but within doores they are more stately, and with a comely presence entertaine those which are to be admitted. Their marriages are somewhat strange; for they neuer see their wiues, vntill they lie with them, vnlesse it bee such as are able to buy slaues, and keepe many concubines; and then expect no dowry, either of land or money, but vtensells and presents of apparrell, which are carried in delicate baskets on boyes heads, singing of songs in the street before the Bride, vntill shee come to her place of aboad. In which negotiation are elder women employed, and dare not but tell the truth, vntill the matter be fully determined. Thus are also their incontinences satisfied by entercourses of Pandars, yet for aduantage they haue brothels and stewes; yea, the very Balnea's serue for meeting places.
                     Thus could I runne ouer a large field of discourses: but my purpose is onely by demonstration to bring the defects The comparison layd together. of this Empire in question, for all their ostentation of glory, and proud boasting of magnificent gouernment, yet so farre short of our example and comparison, as they are from iudgement and loue of religion, who extoll it for the greatest, best, and richest Kingdome of the world. Salomon led the Vantguard of royalty, and like a noble minded Land-Lord, let happinesse to farme amongst all his Tennants rent free. The Turke is so farre from augmenting the peace and plenty of his subiects, that as soone as any of them is but entring into the field of thriuing and contentment, he puls them backe, and thrusts them doggedly into the dungeon of penury and wants. Salomon was an

honourable King, and sat on a throne to decide the controuersies of his people. The Turke is an absolute Tyrant, and neither commeth amongst them, but for glorious magnificence, nor admitteth any to approach neere him, but for pleasure and wantonnesse. Salomon had Princes ouer the Tribes, and the sonnes of Lords enioyed their fathers immunities. The Turke hath none of eminence, but himselfe, and the name of slaue obscureth all light of posterity. Salomon kept an order in his cities and townes, whether they were places of harbour, traffique, and fortification; or for concourse, sacrifice, and reposednesse. The Turke alloweth none, or very few, with Decorum and glory of Citizens. In the dayes of Salomon, the Country-man liued at peace vnder his vine, and the Israelites without number eat, dranke, and made merry. Amongst the Turkes nothing but feare and terrour is threatned, like a tempestuous storme hanging ouer the heads of the Inhabitants. For the cities lie deuasted, the townes depopulated, and confusion is powred out in full measure amongst them; yea, spred like a menstruous cloth, to make modesty and true gouernment ashamed, so that if you returne to the ouerlooking the gallant fields of Greece, which in times past was a subiect for Philosophers and Poets to write vpon, except some few, namely Constantinople, Gratianopolis, Andrinople, Philipopolis, Gallipolis, Salenica, and such like, and heere and there a pretty towne in an Iland, the rest are vnwalled, the people vnarmed, their goods taken by force, their daughters reserued for incontinency, and the whole Countrey a true patterne of misery, insomuch that the Inhabitants being Christians, in a manner creepe into their houses at a little doore through a wall, otherwise shall a Turke come and make a stable of

his hall, rauish his daughter, abuse his wife, and consume him like a lingring disease, which washeth away the flesh, and leaueth nothing but skinne and bone: besides, he dare not manure the ground to grow rich, lest an intruder reap his haruest, and make his endeauours fruitlesse: so that though this great Emperour be so mighty in people, spacious in territories, opulent in wealth, and glorious in imperiousnesse: yet receiueth hee not the fift commodity of his countries, by reason the fields are vnplowed, the vineyards vndressed, the medowes vnstored with cattle, and the very trees vnpruned, all which were plentifully supplied and compassed about with the embracings of husbandry in the time of Salomons peace. Nay, such is the misery of corrupted times, that whereas the Turkes haue been euer a true and religious people toward their Prophet, obseruing the lawes of his Alcaron very strictly: in these dayes they are all transported with prosperity, and seduced with filthy and abhominable wickednesse. For they endure both sloth and idlenesse, augment their desires of incontinency, maintaine the extremities of gluttony, and will bee drunke, against their owne prohibitions and naturall enclination.
                     I haue insisted the longer on these Turkish particulars, because of all the Empires of Asia, and Kingdomes of Affrick, it affoordeth matter of discourse, and mine owne commorance amongst them warrants the truth of what is published, whereby you may thus conclude, after a summary collection, that their Common-wealth may rather bee termed a coniuration of tyrannies, then method or forme of good gouernment: their Emperours masters of a slaughter-house, then fathers of the countrey: and their Gouernours such as the Iudges of Israel, when euery man

did what was best in their owne eies, then Iosua or Samuel, who washed their hands in innocency, either from doing wrong themselues, or winking at others vnder them, witnesse the stories you haue heard, and thousands other vnrepeated. But if this will not yet exclude them out of our palace of happinesse, nor diuert their conceits, which are onely carried away with nouelties, why then let vs extract these fearefull particulars amongst them. First, that fundamentall 1 poynt of establishment, by murthering all their brethren. Next their ambitious supplanting their fathers 2 and elder brothers, and rather then they would bee disappoynted in their proiected drifts, thrusting them into a slaughter-house. Thirdly, the policy and cunning of their Concubines, who haue destroyed very worthy Princes for 3 degenerating persons. Fourthly, the raging cruelty and iealousie against Bashawes, neither permitting the lawfull 4 discent of the sonne, nor continuing long a constant opinion toward the well-deseruing father (for euen the worthy Cigala's themselues, had much a doe to keepe their credit without murmuring, and repining of others. Fiftly, against the maine position of preseruing Iustice, their corrupting 5 by bribes and presents, euen to the peruerting of manifest causes, especially against Christians. Sixtly, the miserable estate of the country-man, and poore communalty, 6 who are in as ill condition as their asses, fit for nothing but to haue heauy burthens layd vpon them. And last of all, their confusion of diet, both for the time and 7 plenty, wherein nothing is gracious or acceptable, nor any thing worthy the name of a happy countrey, or wealthy people. Now to the rest.

and wretchednesse. First concerning religion, the maine point and foundation of all goodnesse, in the daies of Salomon they knew not what a groue meant; a strange altar was odious vnto them, and vntill his later falling away from God, which was reuenged with the falling away of 10. Tribes from his sonne, there was no mention made of idolatry, and the very sound was a harsh kinde of discord. In Muscouia they are both ignorantly superstitious, and ambitiously affected to superiority: for although in that poore knowledge they haue, they euer depended vpon the authority of the Greeke Church, as by their Saints may appeare, which be Saint George, Demetrius, and Nicholay, to whom is consecrated one of the richest Abbies of the world: yet haue they presumed in the assumpting the same to themselues, boasting of a bargaine by commutation, wherein the Patriarch of Constantinople was contented to resigne to the Metropolitane of Mosco all his authority, and supremacy for a great summe of 1588. gold. But see the iust iudgement of God, as he returned into Greece, he was robbed of the same, and most treacherously murthered. Thus yet doe they presume of the glory of the Church amongst them, and in Russia thinke it sufficient to cry out IESV thou sonne of God: as for the Scriptures, in some places they haue the Greeke Testament onely, and heare of the Bible a farre off. For preaching or interpreting, they know not what it meanes; and the common people beleeue any thing their Priests tell them, allowing of nothing but some ridiculous ceremonies, strange fasts, and idle feasts. Concerning their Princes, oh how farre are they from the reciprocall duties between themselues and subiects, and those excellent prescriptions which Samuel prescribed to Saul, and Salomon practised to

his eternall honour. For such hath beene the confused and disordred intrusion of these Emperours, that they haue without care of posterity, conscience, or the Common-wealth shouldred one another from their thrones by treasons, murthers, deuises, and publique hostility. For euer since that old Iuan Vasellowich grew odious to his subiects, horrible stratagemmes haue succeeded, and euen Poland like a neighbour hath feared the burning of his owne house, when the next hath beene on a blaze; especially in the vsurpation of Borris Pheordiwich, who to aspire to the dignity made away Demetrius the second sonne to Vasellowich, and so from other monstrous effects of policy obtained the Diadem, wherein at the first by his bounty and worthy promising demeanor, he in a manner blotted out the print of his former vniust proceedings, and taught them as it were away to forget the wrongs done to their lawfull Princes, till at last growing odious to the subiect, a new search was made, and a further hurliburly about another Emperor confounded all estates, and for many yeeres hath turmoiled the Countrey round about. Concerning the gouernment, there is onely some forme of iustice, &amp; punishing of adultery; but so far from Salomons magnificense, Salomons pallace, Salomons prouision, Salomons nauy, Salomons Nobles, Salomons tranquillity and peace, and Salomons worthines in euery thing, that I am ashamed to name them for Christians. For the common people, though they lie not with other mens wiues, yet they change their owne as often as they list, and howeuer the better sorte mainetaine many wiues, yet doe they practise nothing more then gurmondize and incontinency, with Strumpets and Concubines, whom they resorte vnto in certaine stoues or hot houses, as the hotter

Countries haue Balnea's and washing places. Concerning their Citties? in a word both their Citties and townes are subiect to such bestialitie and confusion, that they seeme rather so many smoakie cotages, and Irish cabbines, then hansome dwellings, or conuenient places of aboad; and in Mosco it selfe for all her populousnesse, and large extension of ground, there is not any thing worthy the admiration or imitation, more then the markets of furres, and some rich ornaments of the skinnes of beasts; as for the Citizens, or Countreymen, I rather resemble them to some scattered troupes of a discomfited army, then men orderly disposed to the managing affaires either for mutuall commerce, or noble trade of Merchants. And thus could I runne ouer all other particulars, but that I shall ouer-runne my owne discourse, considering there is nothing but a meere disparity betweene them and our example.

corne into cinders, but stifle their cattle for want of water, sending them braying, as the Hart to the riuers vp and downe after refreshing springs. For although Aegipt hath bin counted the garner of corne, and that the watrey Nilus hath dispersed her rivulets ouer many Countries, yea comming out of Aethiopia hath taken along sundry swelling fountaines to accompany her into the Mediterranean sea; so that diuers Historiographers haue numbred 6000. Citties on the bankes of the same, and boasted of the glory of their Emperors, and mightinesse of their armies: yet (not once speaking of the barrennesse of the rest) could any of these places take vpon them any glorious exaltation of a well compacted Common-wealth, or terrestriall happinesse of a Nation. For you may read, that when it flourished in the height of prosperity (as when there was a generall famine in many Countries) there was corne in Aegipt, Saba the Queene of Aethiopia came to visit Salomon in his roialty, and went away with admiration, when she saw the difference betweene her owne Countrey, and the blessednesse of Iudea, so that the particular relation of the Court, and gouernment, was occasioned from this Empresses willingnes to be instructed, and desire to gratifie the King for his extraordinary magnificense, and administration of the Common-wealth: whereby I am not incredulous of their information, that report, how that many times the Parents sell their children to Merchants for corne, and at all times send the people to the market for slaues, which are bought vp at easie rates, and dispersed ouer the world: nor will I much contradict their opinion, that haue fashioned their Common-wealth out of an vnfashionable gouernment without law, terrour of disobedience, ciuill institution, orderly precepts, and sociable

louing of one another. For since they marched vnder the colours of Christianity, it hath not beene much better, and except it be such as are borne vnder the same Climate, no man of a temperate Countrey can liue amongst them. Their manners and customes I haue partly described, and could here adde, that howeuer they boast of their antiquity, as being the first Countrey inhabited by Chus the sonne of Cham, which in the Hebrew tongue signifieth blacke, and that afterward they changed their name from the sonne of Vulcane: I cannot finde either any setled gouernment, or state worthy the imitation; or noble enterprises befitting a story, or slender praise. Howeuer they are commended for the first acknowledging a diuine power, and entertaining a religious Priesthood, and manner of celebration of sacrifices; I cannot see, that there now remaines any thing amongst them, but idle customes, and corrupted abuses, beleeuing the incarnation of Christ onely, without a better progression to sanctifying graces; and neuer disputing further then a barren obseruation of ridiculous ceremonies. Howeuer they haue some scattered Cities, and nobilitie in estimation, as the Captaines of their Souldiers, and Leaders of their armies, I cannot finde either orderly preseruation of families, or louing entertaining of one another, but rather thefts, rapines, murthers, and spoyling of themselues, and passengers. Howeuer their Countries are very spatious, and haue a great quantity of ground with variety of people; yet is the barrennesse, and vnfrequented Citties a barre to their estimation; and as we say a little good is worth a great deale of badde; and one corner of Canaan equalled tenne times as much ground for prouision, and plenty of riches. As for their tying their haire

in knots, their odoures, perfumes, sweet wood, spices, Elliphants teeth, almugge trees, and such like; alas, there is neither milke, nor honey, neither good prouision for backe or belly, neither comlinesse of rayments for ornament, or necessity,; neither order for glory, or good neighbour-hood; neither prouision for hansomnes, or magnificense. To conclude in a word, it wanteth many things, wherein barbarous Nations (after their account) come neerer prosperitie, and retaineth nothing, which either happy kingdomes stand in neede of, or desire by way of imitation. As for such blessings, wherewith God hath stored their Countries, and they haue corrupted the Merchants of Europe; I answere in one word for all, both for China, India, and themselues, that they resemble poyson throwne into a wholesome potion, which of it selfe had beene a The merchandize from India and Aethiopia superfluous things and such as we neede not. preseruatiue, but now is a dangerous receipt, and not fit for euery one to drinke: or else they are like sluttish maskes, which couer more beautifull faces, and debarre one another from pleasing themselues with their owne natiue comelinesse. But say, that both iewels, pretious stones, perfumes, spices, mineralls, mettall, and other glorious riches are befitting the Maiesty of Princes, the honor of pallaces, the ornaments of Kings, and the benefit of Countries; I hope wee haue them in more abundance then themselues, and like the Seruant that proued better workeman than his Master, make more commodious vse of them, then any Countrey in the world: so that our Merchant is a noble aduenturer, and our Cities rather store-houses of blessings, then shops of wares: and as for LONDON it selfe, I protest, I rather wonder at it for her excelling prerogatiues, then commend it for a thriuing Emporium.

                        SHall wee come neerer home, and The imperfect condition of Germany. with prying eyes (like the Censors of Rome ouer offenders) looke into the Empire of Germany: or if you will, the countrey it selfe, as it might make a glorious Kingdome indeed. You know how I haue already stept into her enclosures, and opened the very gates of her secrets. The Princes are too absolute, and he himselfe not able to raigne, as Ahasuerosh did, from India to Aethiopia, ouer 127. Prouinces: nor doth the Queene of Saba, come to heare his wisdome, or view the ordering of his palace, the attendance of his Nobles, the sitting of his seruants, the prouision of his tables, and the charity of his deuotion: nor doth the Kings of Arabia send him presents, the Kings of Aegypt wiues, and all the confederate Princes admire his magnificence, nor Hiram of Tyrus contract a league, or the nauy of Tharsus ioyne with his, to fetch gold from Ophir: nor will the Marchant bring him horses and fine linnen from remote places, or supply his wants according to the prerogatiue of Kings, or glorious abundance of opulent countries: nor are the cities ordred by the appoyntment of his ministers, nor can he send his charriots to this place, nor horse-men to that, nor his army whither he list, nor fill the streets of Ierusalem, when hee would solemnize a Passouer. For heere the cheefest

townes liue in freedome, and the Burgers boast of their wealth and policy, in manumitting themselues, and (as it were) sealing the honour of cheefe commanding; yea, sometimes contesting with the Emperor himselfe on their owne gates. As for the countrey commodities and prouision tending either to necessity or pleasure; alas, the commutation consisteth in enriching particular persons, and smally to the augmentation of the Emperours Maiesty, wherein all the tracts of auarice, corrupt mixtures, ouer-reaching one another, and putting off either refuse things, or paltry trifles, as the Italians call them Baggatini: are trod amongst them, and euen beaten smooth with continuall entercourse. So that their marts and faires are so many boothes of drunkards, and instead of ships at sea, fill the fields with waggons of such strange creatures, who make their bellies as great deuouring gulphs as the sea, so that their eating and carowsing is farre from the moderation of mirth, which the Israelites accustomed, or the Persian banquet, where none were compelled: but letting that passe, as an imperfection proprietory to the countrey and nation. I can traduce them further, for mangling the blessings of God bestowed vpon them, by the cuttings and hackings of many grosse sinnes, as vsury, rebellion, contumacy, prophanation, swearing, drunkennesse, murthers, and such like: but especially for vilipending the high commission of the Almighty in two principall matters. The one, in murmuring and repining at strangers, not suffering any to haue any commorance, or dwelling amongst them. For how euer in some of the cheefest townes there is a glorious shew and formall entertaining of Marchants and passengers, who come stored with crownes to powre them into the laps of Inn-keepers, and houses of wantonnesse:

yet will they neither releeue the wants of indigent beggers, nor permit Gentle-man or Artificer to dwell amongst them, or be entertained as a free Denizon, being a stranger of another countrey, except in some sparing cases, and times of necessity, wherein a bribe or great Princes commendatory letters preuaile, by way of entreaty and insinuation. The second is, their grossenesse and simplicity in refusing the right of Kings, and succession of their Emperours, debarring so the best of gouernments, which is the Monarchy, from ruling ouer them, and whereas they may alledge, that the suffrages of men are vncorrupt, and a Prince so chosen shall be the worthier, in regard his vertues must be eminent, whereas the father may leaue a son compounded of so many vices, which ouerruling his vertues, shall make him odious: or otherwise he may prooue simple, tyrannous, dishonest, or irregular. First, it is meerly erroneous, because we are not to contest with the disposer of Kingdomes about his Vice-Gerents, in regard, that sometimes as a fatherly correction hee permitteth a defectiue Prince, rather then folding vp a sorer mantle of vengeance, to spred it abroad to their more greeuous punishment. Next they haue failed in this also amongst themselues: for many of their Emperours thus elected, haue prooued doltish, lasciuious, cowardly, and rather manglers of the Empire, then prouident stewards to augment the wealth and reputation of the same: nay, the best of their Caesars haue beene affrighted at the fulmination of a tyrannous Pope, and seduced with the imposturing cunning of deceiuing Priests, and a corrupted religion, nor could they goe with the wise King to view his nauies, visit his cities, fortifie the townes, erect store-houses, or come neere the six steps of golde on Salomons throne, which was

most apparant, euen the other day, in one of their glorious Princes, from whom the house of Austria hath taken such firme rooting, that it hopes to spred so largely, and so high, that no daring hand shall presume to lop a bough, or breake off a principall stem. I meane Charles the fift, who for all his seeming corroborated mightinesse, quickly lost the loue of the Princes, and for want of ceremonies maintaining the glory of a King, was euen scorned of Pesants. The story is breefly thus. Vpon the report of the losse of his gallies at Argier, he had a purpose to re-enforce his nauy, The Emperor Charles the fift, despised for his meane habit. and as the Poet sayes, saepe premente Deo, fert Deus alter opem, to hope, that as one misfortune had ouerclowded the faire shining sunne of his glory: another happy winde would ouer-blow the threatning storme, and make a serene element, which caused him to come into Italy, for his better and speedier passage, either at Ligorn or Genoa: but entring into Millane, a leane olde man in a blacke cape cloake, the people thronging to see a glorious Emperour, or at least some magnificent shew and pompous ceremonie: they were so daunted to be thus frustrated, and in a manner scorned to bee so disesteemed, that they neither gaue him a Viue le Roy, nor scarse opened a window to looke toward him: nay more, when hee set forward for Spaine, indeede there scarse went a voluntary Gentle-man with him, and the very Waggoners put their thumbs betweene their fingers, in contempt of his troopes, which is as disgracious a thing in Italy, both amongst themselues, and against strangers, as either the lie in France, or Beco to the Gentle-man of Venice, whereat hee tooke such a conceit, that he neuer returned into Italy or Germany againe, howeuer some would impute it vnto his greefe, for not preuailing against the Mahumetans: or deuotion, as desiring

to giue ouer the world, and not be entangled any further with disaduantagious encombrances. And thus you see, why Germany cannot match our example, especially as the Eagle flies now, with broken wings and bruized sides

I must not now dispute, what it was in the flourishing times of Augustus and other Emperors, sweetning contentment with the delicates of riches and pleasure, till God sent strange and cruell Physicians to purge them for their surfetting in gormandize and wantonnesse, I meane the Goths and Vandalls: nor will take vpon mee to presage what it might be, if some diuine power would gather her plights together, and make it one handsome and magnificent garment for a sole soueraigne: but shew her, as she is now loose, vnlaced, and hath her ornaments dilacerated, and euen rent from her sides and shoulders. Alas, it is far worse with them, then it was with the Israelites
                        
in the time of the Iudges, when euery man did what hee listed, and hauing no King (as if they had beene embracers of the Tanist law in Ireland) ranne like sheep without a shepheard, and through the presumption of their owne forces, wrested the enheritance from the true heires. But more properly I may resemble them to the Anarchies of Greece, who through emulation at one anothers greatnesse and credit in the world, kept true prosperity indeed from a noble race and happy thriuing amongst them. For as in ciuill warres, while diuers factions fight one by one, all are in the end subdued; whereas if they did vnite themselues with a stubborne holding together, they might peraduenture hazard and propulse the greatest strength, and raised forces against them. So in the plenties of peace and flourishes of happinesse, the best portion diuided into many parts will quickly bee spent, and a flowing riuer hath not that brauery, when it is cut out into small brookes, as in his owne streame running in a deep and fashionable channell. Againe, as in noble families, when the mannour houses, capitall messuages, and populous Lordships descend to one immediate heire, the dignity &amp; honour of the same, is more and more vpheld, whereas if they were diuided amongst many sonnes, the glory would soone bee extinguished, and strength of the first firmnesse rebated. So fareth it with Italy, the very blessings affoorded by nature are disioynted, and the diuiding it into Principates, hath also deuided her fortunes, and former credit of rauishing beauty. For in one corner rules the Spanyard, at another end encrocheth the Sauoyan, on this side the Venetian keepeth all in awe, on that the Hetrurian Duke maintaineth a iurisdiction, heere the Church with the contraries of blessing and cursing locketh vp St. Peters Patrimony, as

the Pope himselfe in the castle of St. Angelo, there many petty Princes are iealous of forraine trecheries, and howeuer they doe maligne the common enemy, yet can they not agree amongst themselues, but repine with an emulous hate against one another.
                     But would I could vnite them together, and set vp the wals of Rome, placing her seuen hils in such an order, that the city might boast of twenty mile compasse, and the gouernment lift vp a head, as in Daniels visions. Or that I might in a yeere of Iubile settle you vnder the wings of the Angell on the top of the palace, and shew you the Consistory of Cardinals, the triumphs of a Popes inauguration, his stately carrying on mens shoulders, his triple crowne, and such like ostentous and pompous ceremonies with all the glorious celebrations of the other Princes, either at their owne elections, or entertainment of forraine Ambassadours, yet would all this come farre short of our example. For the very prouision of Salomons palace would exhaust the countrey, consume the commodities, and like a barren ground drinking vp the raine, deuoure the plenty of the land, and pull in peeces their best compacted husbandry, of which wee haue had many instances in former times, when Italy suffered diuers famines and want of corne: so that if Aegypt had not beene a store-house and garner of graine to let in a supplyment, as it were an vnlookt for way, the people had perished for lacke of food, and the countrey beene wasted for want of husband-men and tillage. Againe, say they could drinke in vessels of golde (wherein yet I finde them very sparing) and that they determined to expose the glory of some ambitious triumph. Wherewith should their cups ouerflow, considering their wines are not only small, but in such a penury and scarcity,

that if the women and children were not not prohibited, or at least from the customes of modesty did not limit themselues, a stranger should either drinke water or nothing, and had not wherewithall to satisfie their thirst. As for the Villano, he is glad of any water, and quencheth his heat from the muddy channells, which fall from the mountaines of snow, and are cleansed with much adoe by the swift courses of Eridanus, which sendeth her streames into the Adriatick sea, and makes a confederacy with other riuers for the same purpose, though the places require stranger titles. Many other defects haue, and must bespot this countries face, and debarre it from boasting of that happinesse, I would propose vnto you. For though the Inne-keepers daughter goe in a sattin gowne, and that the brauery of their women is amplified from their attire, as if the burs had golden kernels, and euery corner were full of silke-wormes; yet doe they neither eat good meat, feed cleanely, nor meet together with friendly neighbor-hood, or inuitation. As for ciuill gouernment and administration of Iustice, euery Prouince hath a seuerall method, and the pride of one anothers liberty and power to defend a delinquent flying to them for succour, raiseth a presumption of strange committing offences, and perpetrating horrible thefts, rapes and murthers: so that whether they by bandited, or no; when reuenge or wicked instigation hath set any man on worke, the Neapolitan flies vnto Rome, the Roman to Florence, the Florentine to Venice, the Venetian to Mantua, and so in all the rest. And for the more peaceable Inhabitants, they sildome reioyce vnder a vnity, and very sparingly admit of any customes, tending to the smoothnesse of loue and true contentment: so that in a manner all the defects, which deforme the naturall beauty of Kingdomes,

may be heere lookt vpon with pitifull eyes, and much lamented with passionate heart greefe. As for those ostentous heapes of stone, which transport the slight credulity of the ignorant, to beleeue that it surpasseth for cities, buildings, and outward magnificence, any countrey in Europe, when you come to examine particulars, you shall finde it onely, as we deceiue our children, in sugring ouer a little course bread, made in the forme of delicate manchet on the outside. For what saies Tacitus, cities are the men; gouernment, feeding; and obedience of people, subiect to formall orders and handsome ceremonies, and not houses or palaces made of lime and stone, vnfurnished of dwellers, voyd of hospitality, and iealous euen of one anothers best enclinations, when they are furnished at the best. So that besides all naturall imperfections: In Italy there is neither roome in the house for thy seruants, nor litter for the cammels, especially out of their frequented high road wayes, as Rebecca promised the steward of Abrahams family: neither can you fetch the well-fed veale from the droues to entertain the man of God with the Patriark, dresse fine venison with Esau for olde Isaak, nor kill the fat calfe with the good father, that welcomed home his penitent sonne, which makes me remember a merry reason, by one of the same countrey, who being demanded why the muttons, calues, and other cattle, were so few, small, and leane; replyed very soberly, because the Italians deuoured the grasse in sallets, and robbed the pastures to deceiue the poore cattle: but in truth the sunne kisseth the ground with that feruency, and the fields are so matted with drynesse, that for the most part the medowes are vnbefitting to satisfie much store of cattle, nor can feede oxen to any purpose. In another place, a Curtezan questioned with about

the conditions of men in her faculty, or if you will, concerning matters of incontinency, touching the Italian (for all the worlds opinion of his forwardnesse in that kinde) she answered with a tush, Il Italiano pisciar molto. Nor, if I would flatter them according to the ridiculous soothing of Princes: could I of late dayes exemplefie any of their glorious exployts abroad, or famous attempts at home, more then ruining one another, and making of forts and fortifications, which sometimes prooued like Perillus bull to the inuentor, many times emboldned disobedience to relie on a wrong security, and at all times raised vp greater distrust and fowle suspitions, euen in their best cities and gouernments, as you see, how Naples and Millane is curbed, &amp; the braue liberty of the Gentle-men, strangely fettered from the terror of Citadels, of which the Spanyard himselfe is yet transferred with an imaginary conceit, that souldiers may be corrupted, and no place is so impregnable: but thendeauours and policy of men can subiect to the fortune of alteration.
                     But let vs search a little into their best flourishing fields, for all Naples hath a story of it selfe, and boasteth of famous Diuers particulars concerning Italies glory &amp; disreputation. Kings, and certaine Queenes the Viragoes of their time and Mirrors of Europe. For all the Romans haue had the aduancing of Trophes to the honour of the moderne Columni, Caesarij, and many worthy families from the Guelphi Gibellini, diuers from Florence, Ferrara, Vrbine, and some others. For all the Venetians expose to open view the Statues of Gatto Malato at the Santo in Padoa, of Bartholomeo Coloneo a Venetian Generall at Saint Iohn and Paul in their Citty; the memorable battaile of Lepanto against the Turke; the donation of the kingdome of Cyprus by the Queene, who was once a Deuotresse in their

Monasteries; the attempt against Millane, and expelling both French and Spaniard in those daies; the entertaining of Francis the third King of France, and Poland, in despight of forraine threatnings, searches, pursuite, and the Popes displeasure; and the last ouerdaring contesting with the Pope in matters appertaining to their State and gouernment. For all Florence swelled vp to this height of riches, and brauery, from the plentifull spring of a noble Medices, and famous actions of a politicke man. For all an heroike Gonzaga aduaunced his Marquisate to a Duchy, as a worthy recompence of his warlike endeauours. For all the Dukedome of Millane was incorporated into the house of Sforza a deuised name for his valour and martiall proceedings; with diuers others of this kinde: yet alas you see, what is now become of Naples, and the noble man repines at his lost liberty, nor can he be satisfied, for all he may flutter in a golden cage, and ride through the streetes in a veluet Carosse; yet you see that Rome hath beene sacked, and almost trampled vnder feete euen of late daies, insomuch, that when the Duke of Burbon entred for Charles the 5. no worthy Roman durst shew his head, and the other principates of Italy were afraid of pulling downe such a house, whose dust must needes fall into their eyes, and smoakie rubbish stifle their breath; yet you see, how pittifully Ferrara and Vrbine haue lost their reputation of courtshippe, and offred their coronets on the altar of a Clergie mans vsurpation: yet you see, how Florence liues now, and for all the stile of Magnus dux Hertruriae, thinketh of nothing but amassing of treasure from mechanicke drudgery, and corrupted auarice: yet you see, that Rhodes is lost, and the miraculous Colossus beaten to pouder, that diuers discomfitures haue made Venice
                        
sweate in the midst of her cold bathe the sea; that Cyprus was pul'd from her sides by violence, when but a little more strength and prouidence would haue kept it secure, and so warme, that no boisterous arme of Turkes should haue vncouered her to the catching of cold; that they haue beene since inforced to contriue a treatice of pacification with the Gran Signeur, and in truth beene subiect to many indignities, which a man would not imagine so rich and politicke a gouernment could endure: but alas the Duke is but an vnsignificant voice. For the sword is caried before the Gran Concilij, who take order, that he neither liue profusely in his expences, nor haue any daring confidence to practise any thing preiudiciall to their gouernment: yet you see, Mantua is now at quiet, and dare not entermeddle with any warlike troubles, or martiall affaires, except he haue the cunning to discouer the aduantage of a preuailing party, and the fortune to ranke himselfe in the strongest squadrons: yet you see, how Millane mournes like a captiue, and for all her 300. Carosses, and 500. foot-cloths, dare not lift vp a countenance sutable to their hearts, nor a hand to pull the ramparts of the Citadle to the ground, when their wishes would faine see all throwne into the sea. And so in diuers others of this kinde.
                     As for the generall reputation of Italy, which it hath gotten by Marchants, it is abused in the metonimia. For their silkes and veluets, their marchandize and wares, that all Europe and Turky welcome them into their harbours and ports, but with such errours, ouersights, and peraduenture difficulties, that they neither make vse of nauigation out of their middle sea and Arches: nor haue any good Saylours and Souldiers amongst them: nor will aduenture

as worthy men indeede for their countries honor, nor can performe any voyage with true iudgement and expedition. For the least affrighting newes of a Pirat, shall detaine them three months in harbour, and an vnexpected storme driue them into euery Port and Iland. Thus haue I my selfe beene witnesse, that an English-man hath left two great Italian ships in the towne of Xant, for feare of Ward, supposed to houer about Sapientia an Iland adioyning, being bound for Scanderon, and sayled to Cyprus, vnladed, dispatched, and returned backe againe, ere they were on their iourney. Nay, thus haue I knowne them foureteene weekes betweene Constantinople and Venice, which an English-man with a prosperous wind hath dispatched in fourteene dayes, although I imagine it 1700. English mile, and in lesse then six weekes almost with any winde. So that Venice it selfe boasting of the brauery of three hundred gallies, eight or ten galleasses, and thirty ships for marchants, neither hath sufficient men to man twenty, nor can without time and great expences fill vp the roome of that inuentory without Greekes, who are their cheefest Saylors, and condemned slaues, whom they spare from a death at the gallowes, which must needs release them from worldly troubles, to a liuing misery in the gallies, wherein to breath in continuall horrour is worse then twenty deaths indeed. Thus could I tire you with distasting particulars against the reputation of Italy: but I meane not to ouerlooke them with any maleuolent aspect, or disparage them, to bring my speeches within compasse of defamation: but onely keep my example in practise, and conclude, that it wanteth many things (with Germany) to make it proportionable with Salomons greatnesse, and Canaans goodnesse.

                        SHall wee then goe into Spaine, where Spaine wanteth many things to come neere our example. the Grandes of the Kings court haue golden keyes of his chamber, and are priuiledged by patent, to stand with couered heads before his Maiesty: where the Exchequer is full of golde from India, and the Treasurers bring in account of 100000. souldiers in garison and actiue employment, yeerely payd and orderly supplyed: where the Noble-man insulteth for his Gothish bloud, and will prooue a true Castilian, more ancient in gentry then the race of Othoman, and euery one, though he be but a maker of Chappinoes, weares his rapier point-blancke, as you call it, looking as high (though not altogether so big) after an oliue an a little ruske, as a Germane, that eats and drinks more at a meale, then a Spanyard doth in a weeke: where so many Kingdomes are vnited, as you see the seuen starres in the firmament make a more perspicuous shew then single planets in their sequestred spheres: where they can without boasting, I will not say vaine-glory, relate diuers histories of voyages at sea, discoueries of Countries, plantation of Colonies, conquest of both Indies, vsurpation of many Principates, running armies, and diuers other glorious exploits: howeuer the rest of Europe haue resembled them to prying and raging wolues ouer silly sheepe, either with a couetous minde of

intrusion, or tyrannous desire of deuouring. Shall wee I say goe thither, and looke out a match for our example; me thinks I am answered of euery man that weares a light hat, great ruffe, and full paire of hose. If Spaine doe not equall him, who can doe it? I am not yet prepared for such a satisfaction, but will presume to shut Spaine out of dores, from entring into the priuy chamber of one example, for all his India supply, the only tumor of his greatnes, which did not Apollo pardon the fault, would prooue but the wish of Midas, who with his golden fortunes wanted the vse of natures benefits, and could neither eat nor drinke without choaking. But to particulars.
                     If Spaine be the richest Kingdome of Europe, and that some of them boasted, when time was, in ouerlooking the beautifullest worke in the world, I meane the Chappel at Westminster, that their King was able to make such another of siluer: where is Salomons golde amongst them, or Ierusalems plenty? when siluer had no better reputation then stones, and euery man in Iudea was rich indeed, without abusing others, or others repining against them: where is their care to store the countrey, which questionlesse money would doe, from other exuberant prouinces, though nature had denyed them orderly prouision? How came the Malec

but euen in his gouernment of Millane, Naples, and Sicilia, the souldier wanteth, and many times is compelled to remit one halfe, to purse vp the other: Is not all this either for want of treasure (the opinion whereof hath made his pride swell vncontrollable) or orderly distribution? the spring from whence the fluent plenty of Salomon had encrease. Be not therefore affrighted at this monster opinion, nor seduced with the vanity of report. For put the best Hispaniolized English man to the skirmish of vnderstanding the truth, and the wealth of Spaine shall prooue but false fires, if you be so neere to discouer their disbursements, and infinite occasions to dispend their treasure: but if you should aduenture to lay their peeces to the light with Salomons cloth, by way of comparison, good God, how course, how cockeld, how short, how shrinking, how faulty, and indeed ridiculous would all appeare? And thus much for their wealth. Now to the rest.
                     What hath Spaine worthy commendation, much lesse any prerogatiue of happinesse? why, Canaan flowed with milke and honey, yeelding such blessings of encrease, that the King not onely had his great store of prouision without repining: but Israel, as the sand of the sea, eat, dranke, and made merry, and can this bee done in Spaine? The burnt hills and desart places will quickly answer the argument; the country-man hides his garlike and onions, as ashamed of his diet; the Citizen powders his fish, and buyes cheese of the Dutch-man; the Gentle-man is limited what he shall eat, and how much hee may carry home to his family; the Court hath much adoe to be supplyed, and many concussions are practized from the Kings prerogatiue, to furnish the offices with reasonable allowance, and the whole Kingdome is sometimes affrayd to want

bread; whereupon certaine agents are employed, euen in remote countries, to bring in both corne and victuall, tempting both them and our selues with golde and ready payment of money: for which purpose onely is a prouiso in their acts of Parliament, concerning exportation of coyne, of which in truth though they haue great cause to boast, yet are they tied to so many inconueniencies for other wants, that in their best cities is neither good fare, nor good lodging, nor any thing worthy the name of a blessing. As for their silly praising of sallets, fruits, and herbs: I remember Sr. Roger Williams answer to an idle Spanyard, boasting of his countries citrons, orenges, oliues, and such like: I, but (sayd he) in England we haue dainty veale, and well fed capons to eat with this sawce, and many delicate dishes worthy the name of sustenance indeede. For God made the beasts of the earth to liue on the grasse and fruits of the same; but man to liue vpon them, and command all. So that Adams wisdome gaue them titles, and his superioriry prescribed subiection: but how? for mans vse, mans delight, mans necessity, mans conuersation, mans triumph. Thus doth oyle make a cheerfull countenance, wine a gladsome heart, bread a strong body, and flesh a fulnesse of bloud: thus was Salomons palace and tables furnished, and Dauid praised God for infinite blessings: thus were odours and incense prouided, and the loue of brethren compared to the deaw and balsome of Hermon, or the costly oyntment on Arons vestures: thus in Peters vision he might kill and eat, and the Sauiour of the world liued amongst Publicans, feasted at marriages, and allowed of honest conuersation: and thus had Canaan neighbourly meetings, banquets of triumphs, and times of publike and priuate celebrations. But in Spaine no such matter; they

neither dare, nor can bid you welcome. For farre worse then in Italy, idle iealousie, filthy malice, feare of expences, arrogant menaces, wicked suspition, and such like, will debarre you from the pleasure of inuitation, from the freedome of entercourses, and cannot sauour the noble liberty of mutuall amity. Canaan had the temple furnished as God commanded, the Priest obedient to the King, the Prophets in estimation, and the feasts of the Leuiticall Law orderly celebrated. Spaine is polluted with Paganisme, and inuented that cruell office of Inquisition to punish the Moores, or such as adhered to their superstition, is ouerawed by the Cleargy, and is so terrified with the thundring voyce of excommunication, that he durst not but put his owne sonne to death, to please the Pope. Canaan was a receptacle for strangers, loued princely solemnities, and could not endure neither begger, nor whore of their owne nation. Spaine hates all men, or at least vilipends them in respect of themselues, commits them to fire and sword, that exclaime against their stewes and prophanation, and cannot order many solemne festiuals, except at a Kings inauguration, a Princes marriage, or a Cardinals iollity: where yet an Italian inuention shall fill a table with painted trenchers and dishes of China: but a hungry belly may cry for meat, and not be satisfied.
                     
                        Canaan had cities of refuge, cities of store, cities of strength, cities for horses, and the Kings magnificence, to all which the high-waies were conuenient, and men passed to and fro without danger, or want. In Spaine you must haue a Guide, yea sometimes a guard, and are so farre from expecting reliefe after your daies endurance, that if you haue not a borracho before your saddle, and commodious prouision on an Asse or Moile hired for the same

purpose, you may go supperlesse to bedde, and peraduenture haue no other bedde, but a Stramezza, or some stinking tike filled with sedge, and shalings of hempe. Canaan

Iacob serued 14. yeares for his wiues, and Rahel was a woman of great comelinesse: Ruth no doubt pleased Boaz, and the times afforded delicate creatures, Bersabe, Abigaile, and Abisack are commended for their beauty: Thamar was at first pleasing to Ammon, and her loue molested the young Prince: Ester and Iudith were Mirrors of their time, the one pleased the Monarch of the world, the other ouercame with a double victory the great Captaine of Assiria: Susanna's beauty enflamed the Iudges, and the dotards fell into the pit of burning wantonnesse: Herodias was so attractiue, that shee might haue commaunded halfe a kingdome: the Queene Berenice allured Titus, and he neglected his greatest affaires for her sake, and so in thousand other relations, besides the generall applause afforded the meaner sort, whereby the very heathen confessed the happinesse of Iudea in this kinde, and added blessing to blessing, when they vnderstood their worth, vertue, and commendation. But Spaiue must mourne for strange disparity this way, and either lament that the whore of Babylon hath poysoned her Countries with the dregges of abomination, or complaine, that the women are painted like the images of the groues, and sit in the high-way, as Thamar when shee went to deceiue Iuda. For if they be honest, they are for the most part vnpleasing, and swartisb: if Curtezans, dangerous and impudent: so that for these and many other insufficiencies

I dare be bold to say, that as yet Salomon must sit vnparralel'd, and Spaine can in no sort come neere the Countrey of Canaan, as it was in the time of his prosperity, and administration.

The answere shall not be a peremptory contradiction, nor derogate from the merit of the least worth, or vertue: yet are they traduced for many defects, and I beleeue will fall vnder our example; howsoeuer, I am sure, it dares not abide the touch in the triall. For setting the wisedome of Salomon aside, whereof Fraunce could seldome make ostentation, the Queene of Saba commended the obedience of the Princes, the sitting of his seruants, the ordering of the palace, the furnishing of the tables, the prouision for the houshold, and the glory of his throne: not so much for outward maiesty of the structure, and princely magnificense in his attendants, as the aduised care ouer his subiects, and impartiall determining of controuersies. In Fraunce the Princes contest with the King, the Clergie affront the Princes, the Gentrey

murmure against the Clergie, the Pages mocke the Gentlemen, the Citizens complaine of the Pages, and all sorts of people are proud of nothing, but slouenlines familiarity, and disorder; so that with much adoe the Mechanicall man stands bare to the King; and the Nobles sit at meate, as Carriers in an hostery without any reuerence, with vnmannerly noise, with impudent snatching the dishes from the table by the Seruitors, and confused trouble of commers and goers: whereby a vild custome hauing got the vpper hand, the maiesty of the Court and Kingdome is much depressed, which otherwise redacted to an vniformity might indeede augment the glory of Europe.
                     
                     The Kingdome of IVDEA and gouernment of CANAAN, as soone as euer obedience had set in a foote amongst them, admired the wisedome of their women, as well as admitted the policy of the men; and in no sort debarred the daughters, neither from the princely throne, nor fathers inheritances, when the sonnes were extinct, and the line failed in the males, which all men know, whose consciences are opened with the key of vnderstanding Gods truth. For the daughters of Zelophaad came before Iosua, and had their portion with the rest of the Tribes: But in Fraunce the Law salicke debarreth the woman from her lawfull inheritance, out of a wilfull position, that the Flower-deluce may not go to the distaffe, The law salicke in France against the law of

the Persians beganne to shrinke in their estimation, the Kingdomes of Saca, Sogdiana, and Bactriana were subiect to Tamira, and Tolmilanda two famous Queenes. The barbarous Scithians admitted of Tomiris for their Soueraigne, and how she conquered Cyrus, a worthy Historiographer hath enlarged. In Canaan Debora iudged Israell, and Athalia was Queene of Ierusalem. When Salomon had aduanced both the Temple and Palace, Saba came as Empresse of Aethiopia vnto him, and in the time of the Apostles Candauce gouerned the same Countrey. When Caesar presaged his owne fortunes Cleopatra was sole Queene of Egipt: and some write that Dido ouer-ruled Carthage and Africke. In Bohemia euen of late daies Libussa and Velasca obtained the Diadem, and when they supposed themselues seated in firmenesse, they gathered a company of Ladies, and vpon a light credulity, that the story of the Amazons was to be beleeued, would haue erected such a foolish Common-wealth. Amongst our selues before the conquest we had a Gueudoline Queene of Brittaine, a Cordelia Vaodicea, and some other; and since two Daughters of HENRY the 8. Amongst whom ELIZABETH was such a Prince, that forrane report hath established her for the Miracle of all ages, howeuer some of our selues haue beene too sparing in her admiration, and enlarging her greatnesse. In Italy we remember two Queenes of Naples, who haue done such actions in the world, that they will be remembred in despight of obliuion. In Hungary the history of diuers Queenes hath startled euen men of resolution to be ashamed of their pusillanimity, and incited diuers heroike persons to worthy imitation. I might name the Queene of Cyprus taken out of the Monastery at Venice, and so inuested with the Diadem, which at last

she laid prostrate before the feete of the Senate, and they protected the same, till a stronger arme wrested it out of their tuition. Whereby I cannot but wonder, that neither example, nor precept can preuaile with them, considering in all kingdomes, with all sexes, and at all times such inhibitions to debarre the right of kingdomes from the true and indubitate successors did not passe without the scandall of intrusion, tyrannie, and wrong. Besides, according to the Satyre,

                           Dum vitant stulti vitia in contraria currunt.
                        
from an inconuenience (as they suppose) they haue fallen into a mischiefe, and if I would vse it by way of personating, whereas in submitting to diuine appointment in such cases, they might please both God and man, in ouer-ruling the truth, they haue made their preposterous dealing ridiculous to all the world. For howeuer they deny their owne naturall daughters this prerogatiue, by a contrary fashion they admit of stranger women to bee more imperious ouer them: as by the two late Queene mother Regents, and both Italians of the house of Medices, is made apparant by lamentable experience: what the one contriued, and how like a firebrand she had like to haue set all Fraunce on a blase; the History is pregnant, and the Legend of the Cardinall of Loraine composed by that true hearted Frenchman Francis de Lisle a man of honour, is most apparant; &amp; how the other is suspected is now no newes: But to the rest.
                     
                        Salomon made diuers nauies, went in person to view his shippes, had great custome from his Merchants, loued and maintained good Marriners and pilots, contracted leagues with forraine Princes, making the confirmation of them honourable, and performed all good offices, that

tended to the expatiating his glory. France wanteth shipping, is carelesse of nauigation, raiseth few Saylors, seldome attempteth voiages, or discoueries, and hath many times incurred the imputation of perfidious breach of faith, vnder that diabolicall position, fides non est conseruanda cum Haereticis: as also that iesuiticall doctrine of equiuocation: witnesse their horrible massacres, the imprisoning the Princes of the bloud, their tragicall warre, the inhumane murther of the Admirall, the Guisian pride, and the terror Francis the third was put into, when he was put into the Lovure. Salomon had that good order and obedience in his townes and cities, that he knew his cities of store, his cities of traphique, his cities of fortification, his cities of refuge, and his cities of composition. But in France both cities and townes with their inhabitants, and Merchants are vnfashionable, sluttish, dangerous, rebellious, and the people neither of wealth, nor eminence: In Paris they dare talke of a Kings wantonnesse, entermeddle with tractates of Parliament, and State, call any Prince Hugonet, that onely saies the Nostre Dame is but a darke melancholly Church, and iustifie very monstrous and abusiue actions: Besides, to tell of their inconstant and refractary dispositions, would be too tedious, and sooner discouer their loathsome treasons, then preuent the customary, and mischeeuous practises of the people.
                     The peace of Salomon caused plenty, and that spred it selfe ouer all Israel like a shady tree, which as a double shelter kept backe the cold of winter, and tempered the burning heate of summer: so that it is apparant with the Kings magnificense at Court, the husbandmans peace and wealth in the Countrey was enlarged, whereupon most of them were Berzalites and would go no further, then ouer

                        Iordan with Dauid, but rerurne to their owne houshold, sit vnder their owne figg-trees, and bee gathered together into the graues of their ancestours. But France knowes not now what to say: For the Court is a meere mapp of confusion, and exposeth many actions more ridiculous then worthy imitation: as for the Countrey-man, hee is called a Pesant, disparaged in his drudgery and seruile toylsomnesse, liueth poore and beastly, is treacherous at aduantage, and yet afrayd of his owne shadow, and cannot free the vineyards from theeues and destroyers: yea, all the countrey swarmeth with rogues and vagabonds, whose desperate wants driue them to perpetrate many horrible murthers, although for the most part the Prouosts of euery diuision are very diligent. The wisdome of Salomon setled his cities, that strangers were admitted at all times, except in frontire townes, which peraduenture were guarded in the night, according to martiall discipline, prouided that the passages were easie and secure, admitted of all complainants, and leuiated their greeuances, aduanced himselfe on a golden throne to entertaine matters of Iustice, allowed of the Prophets, who yet out of zeale cryed out against the abuses of the Temple and Palace, and commanded the subiect, first to remember his duty to God; then his obedience to the Prince; and last of all, his loue to his neighbour: and this hee performed by admonitory preceps to enstruct the ignorant, and princely indignation to punish the obstinate. France referreth all to Parliaments and Presidents, excludeth the reformed Churches out of the walls of the cities, hath the name of Prophet in derision, suffered the Iesuites to murther two famous Princes, permitteth them still a Sanctuary, and from worldly policy excludeth true religion out

of doores. In France the passages are toylesome and disordered, dangerous for extraordinary robberies, and vnder officers shuffle vp diuers times most notorious abuses. To conclude, in France many particulars choak the breath of happinesse, from giuing life to a glorious Kingdome indeede, if the reciprocall duties betweene Prince and subiect were but easily extended: so that with these defects I cannot chuse but exempt her from sitting on any hand of Salomons throne. Whither shall wee then goe to match our example? or at least to come so neere, that a ciuill censurer will neither flatter nor detract: you know my first purpose, and I now determine to lead you into the sweet and orderly fields of England.

                        WIthout preface or circumloquution, you shall finde the Kingdome of England in The glory of England both abroad and at home. geographicall dimension equall to the country of Canaan, and the people praysing of God, in regard of their great and extraordinary blessings. For begin where you will, wee shall come so neere the comparison, as a close order in ranging a battalion. Concerning the generall view of the same, did you euer heare or read of any so well diuided into shires and hundreds, with Lords, Lieutenants, Sheriffs,

Iustices, and other inferiour officers: insomuch, that it hath layd an imposition on the endeauours of a principall scholler, and hee (according to the secret of satisfaction) hath most worthily vnclasped the records of antiquity, and with such sufficient ampliation, that our aduersaries haue beene silent in excepting against it. But to my first purpose: I say, that to match all the particulars, wherwith I haue stored Salomons magnificence and the countries prosperity, there is not at this houre any Kingdome in the world, so ready, apt, or worthy to take him by the hand, to pace out the measures of true glory and happinesse, as the Kingdome of England.
                     
                     Concerning our glory abroad, what worthy voyages haue we made? I hope no people or nation euer equalled vs, witnesse Sr. Iohn Mandeuill into India by land; Stafford ouer Europe, much about the same time; Ienkinson, Willoughby, Borogh, and many others into Russia and Muscouia; Forbisher and Hawkins to discouer the northerne passages: the Fenners, Ralph Lane, Iohn Clarke, and diuers into America; another voyage, where of Sr. Walter Raleigh was the proposer; our setling in Virginia; our traffique to the West Indies, Brasill, Peru, Caribana, and Guiana; Captaine Drake round about the world, twice or thrice; Thomas Candish the like, our trauels to the East Indies, or Philippines; the Earle of Cumberlands worthy voyages, &amp; amongst others, that to Santo Port-Ricco; the Portugall voyage; Cales voyage; the Iland voyage, and sundry others; as in Master Hackluits booke about this subiect only. Besides moderne trauellers, both of Noble-men &amp; Gentle-men, although euery man is not a free Denizon of prosperities Kingdom, nor can boast of natures bounty in the gifts of vnderstanding, or fortunes liberality in disposing her treasures. If

you would see how our marchants are bestowed, look into all the Ports of the world, you shall find them setled, &amp; our shipping in harbour? If you could view all the countries of the earth, where men dare or can come, we are nobly dispersed, &amp; I beleeue might be pull'd out of the center of the same, if such a passage did euer excite man to explore for secrets, marchandize, or wealth. If you were admitted into the remotest palaces of Emperours &amp; Kings; yea Tartary it selfe, English-men would salute you, and speak your owne language: and if you haue a purpose to affright idlenesse with any enterprize in the world, especially to make them beleeue, that the hand of profit will fill their laps with plenty, English-men dare set endeauours on their best feet, and can tell how to tumble all blockes and hindrances aside, which may either terrefie them from such enterprizes, or detaine them from the glory of the actions: only heere lies a secret of traducing them, that a supposition of the wants of others, or feare of cumbersomnesse, when they meet with an indigent countrey-man abroad, hath debarred free conuersation, and doth make the mutuall supplying the necessity of strangers, a harsh-kinde of welcome; yea, an absolute leauing them to misery, if they haue not bills of exchange or letters of credit, to ouerbeare mischances.
                     But our glory abroad is truely expatiated, when you shall know how helpefull wee haue beene to other nations, both with purse and forces; yea, contrary to the opinion of the world, concerning our penury, opened the enclosures of riches, and hononrably supplyed the defects of other Kingdomes. Wee haue made peace betweene Denmark and Sweden, and pacified those troubles long agoe. We haue releeued the Estates of Holland with men,

money, and munition, vnderpropping them, as if a man should vndershore a ruinous wall, vntill the foundation were repaired. We haue assisted the Protestant Princes of of France in their first ciuill warres, and beene auxiliary to many noble houses of Germany, we setled the last King in his greatnesse, and lifted him vp to that honour, that none of his Predecessours had their crownes shining with such a lustre. We playd the Physician with Geneua, and administred her such an antidote, that no aconite of Pope or Sauoy could envenom her to death, or contriue her destruction. We brought the distressed Prince Antonio to knock at the gates of Lisbone, and had he not found a fatall vicissitude of times and occasions; yea, the minds of inconstant men corrupted with by-respects, and priuate following the stronger side, we might questionlesse haue preuailed in the proiect, and vpon the least filling the sailes of our expectation with the winde of home assistance, brought recouery to receiue the fulnesse of life. Wee haue made Spaine weary of the warres, and at last desire a peace, which I would be loth to resemble to still waters, wherein are the deepest gulphs and most dangerous places to aduenture. We returned the Polish Ambassadour, with admiration at our Princes greatnesse and magnanimity. We haue setled the good opinion of the Muscouite. Wee haue emboldned the Venetians in their last dissentions against the Pope. Wee haue accorded the Arch-Duke, who not onely admitteth vs into entertainment, but giueth way vnto such, as yet maintaine the cause of the contrary. We haue welcomed the Prince of Moldauia, and as farre as policy or charity could goe, brought him along into the faire fields of expectation to regaine his enheritance. We haue lately ouerlooked the fields of Sweden and Russia; yea,

thought it befitting to send a martiall supply into Denmarck, and howeuer the Polander repine, must in the end (I beleeue) determine those controuersies. To conclude, (though it shall be no cause of ostentation) wee haue prospered in so many glorious thriuings, that the Spanyard in his prophanation hath sworne IESVS CHRIST to become a Lutheran, and railed on report, for filling the world with the sound of so many memorable actions.
                     Concerning our glory at home, lay abroad our example The glory of England at home. and spare not, and marke the emptiest place, which we will not fill vp with comparison. First, the best manner of gouernment from Gods own mouth, which is monarchal; and philosophicall principles, which is a King; and morall enstructions, which is a distributer of Iustice; and peoples desires, which is an honourable preseruer of Common-wealths: all vnited in one person, from a continuall descent of princely ancestours, gaining the loue and obedience of many nations, by excelling induments of nature, as wisdom, learning, iudgment, peaceable desires, honorable liberality, magnanimity, &amp; such like. And did it please him to add some glorious repairing, or rather magnificent quadrant, to his palace at White-hall, being the principall place of entertainement, and the eye to ouerlooke such a city, as is not in the world, it would come neere our example indeede. For the Kings house in Ierusalem was thirteene yeere a building, and no one thing addes more honour to a nation, then regardable edifices, and eminent workes of Maiesty, being the very fruit of peace, and (as it were) the birth-right of prosperity, whether it bring forth sumptuous structures or adorning monuments. And (if it were not a pride &amp; elation of hart to number the people, looke how many nations and languages are vnder subiection:

namely English, Scottish, Irish, Welch, Cornish, Ments, Ilanders both Hebrides and Orchades, &amp; the French of Gersy and Iersy: so that if the honour of a King consisteth in the multitude of his subiects, what Prince hath more, and such variety? If you looke on his palaces, where are so many, and so good, belonging to any Kingdome in the world? If you will behold his court; I hope for state, good order, expences, entertainment, and continuall attendancy, other places come farre short? If you will view his shipping and nauies, I am sure you passe away with astonishment, when you are enstructed in the secrets of their seruice and strength? If you will behold his armours and munition, they exceede report, and the Arsenalls of other countries haue neither such equipage nor sufficiency; but when you shall finde euery Noble-man and Gentle-mans house so well furnished, euery Hall and Company so well prouided, euery Shire so willing to continue their preparation, euery Master so cheerefull in storing himselfe, and euery man so ready to giue eare to any martiall summons, and prepare with ioy to attend the seruice; you must needs returne, not louing vs with feare and trembling, but affecting vs with triumph and well wishes, for our preuailing against the proudest aduersary? If you will number vs at sea, I know there is not so many good Mariners and Saylours in Europe, excepting the Low Countries. If you will muster vs at land, who can shew such companies of foot? such troopes of horse? so many worthy seruitours? and so well appoynted? Insomuch that I know diuers Gentle-men of England, who can conduct 3000. men into the field (in their King and Countries name) of their owne tenants, seruants, and friends. If you will examine our Nobility, I confesse they doe not boast of factious greatnesse, as in

                        France, &amp; the Princes of Germany: but their number, noble disposition, &amp; willingnes to be obedient, may passe in the best items of Fames account. If you would see our Councellors, prepare a reuerence, and settle your estimation toward them for their orderly life, probity of manners, integrity in deciding controuersies, &amp; affability in admitting suters: &amp; though you come from the Grandes of Spaine, the Principalities of Italy, the Electors of Germany, the Dukes of France, &amp; the States of other Countries, yea, the ostentous pomp of Cardinals: yet bee not too preiudicate, nor transported with selfe-conceited wilfulnes; for you shall see as great brauery, retinue, &amp; obseruation amongst vs, as any subiects in the world dare challenge or put in practise, for outward glorious ostentation: nay more, the order of our Garter, and the ceremonies of enstalling, are continued with that triumph and maiesty, that no one celebration of petty Princes dare lift vp a countenance of such iollity &amp; regardable honor. And if you will behold the other Courtiers, they are generally so many, so handsome, so seruiceable, &amp; of their own retinues so well prouided, that I protest they so farre exceede other places, both for gracefull shewes and sufficient estates, that I wonder, how such a corner of the world should haue such a generall confluence of all happinesse and courtship, as if a raised winde should beat the swelling sea of prosperity to one shore.
                     But if you will be rauished indeede, or transported with the loue of the world, come and behold the beauty of our Ladies, and the disposing them at a night of solemnity, to which if you adde the generall contentment, which our English women affoord generally, without sophisticate and adulterate additions, either to comelinesse or fauour, there is no man can hold his peace, but proclaime our preeminence.

Againe, if you would see Iustice proud of her entertainment, and how shee presents both praemium and poena to the seuerall attendants on her throne of equity; looke into our Starre-chamber, and view the Sunne in most perspicuous splendour, without so much as the least clowdy respect of persons. If you will enter our Gentle-mens houses, I hope, there is no such cupbords of plate, beds of of veluet and embroidery, hangings of tapistry, variety of roomes, duty of seruants, order of house-keeping, store of pastime, and all that man can desire in any countrey in the world. If you will search our cities and townes, what they want in outward deceit of formality (and yet I cannot so extenuate our buildings) is supplyed in sweetnesse and delicacy, and within doore surpasseth the best of them for wealth and furniture. As for expences, I am sure some Citizens of London are at more annuall charge of diet, then the Dukes of Venice, Florence, or Genoa, for their own palaces. If you will examine our marchants, howeuer some great Foulker or agent for a whole Kingdome, in Genoa, Antwerp, Brussels, or other citties may surpasse vs for vsury, venting commodities, or supposition of wealth: yet I am sure, there died not two such in one yeere, out of one towne in the world, as Spencer and Sutton. As for the rest, they surpasse for curious fare, statelinesse, following their pleasures, handsome education, comely entertainment, and orderly contribution, Besides, they liue at home in ease, purchase land with security, bring vp their children in daintinesse, maintaine their families in obedience, and cannot be matched by any forraine opposition. Would you be acquainted with the Trades-man, Artezan, and others of mannuall occupation, looke how hee liues, looke how he fares, looke where he dwels, looke what he

weares, looke whether he goes to buy his meat, to such markets and shambles, that the very sight astonisheth all strangers, and once made acquainted with their variety and goodnesse, they are amazed at our blessings, and wonder, how so much prouision can bee orderly deuoured. Would you be refreshed with the pleasant countrey aire; our Yeoman and Husbandman liueth in such delight and sweetnesse of situation, that you may repine at his health and prosperity: but if you consider in what comelinesse and decency, in what peace &amp; tranquility, in what neatnes and hospitality, in what wealth and good condition; you will fall to praising of God, for imparting his blessings to our nation, and wishing the like to your owne deficient countrey in this kinde: For beleeue it (as you shall heare heereafter) whether he be Purchaser or Farmer, our enemies haue repined at our prerogatiues in this kinde, and our friends embtaced our noble customes with desire of imitation. I could adde many things to the ampliation of our glory, as our hauens and harbours, especially in Ireland, our riuers, high wayes, secure trauelling, vniuersities, castles, bathes, mines, and honorable orders of watchings, trainings, and musters: but I referre them to their due places, when I shall prooue our excellency and transcending prerogatiues beyond other nations. And thus much for our glory.

                        COncerning the happinesse of a nation, what The happinesse of our countrey. Kingdome hath more commodities within it selfe, wanteth lesse, or is better furnished from forraine parts? so that whether for profits sake, the strangers of other countries make sale of their best things, or that there is a secret in transportation, or that custome or cunning hath taught our marchants, euen curiosity it selfe, in selecting the choycest things, I know not, but am sure our England is the shop of the world, and London the Magazin of natures dainties. But to particulars; if it bee a blessing for euery man to eat vnder his owne roofe, to sit with the pleasure of conuersation in his orchard or garden, to enioy the fruits of the earth with plenty, to liue in neighbourly gratuities: and in a manner our doores open all night, to haue many children, seruants, and store of cattle, to purchase great estates, marry our daughters beyond expectation, and strengthen one another in worthy families and preuailing affinity: looke amongst vs, and tell mee where is the like? If it be a blessing not to be suppressed with superiours, not to haue the Common-wealth rent in peeces with tyrannie, not to see others enioy the fruits of our labours, not to be tormented with intrusion, vsurpation, or malicions lookes of ouer-couetous Land-Lords: looke amongst vs, and demand who can complaine, or at least,

who is so wronged, but hee may haue satifaction or redresse. If it be a blessing to enioy the preaching of the Gospell, to be free from corrupting and absurd ceremonies, to reioyce in the liberty of vpright consciences, to continue in a true, perfect, and established religion (as heereaster shall be more amply explained) to abound with reuerend learned men, to haue liberall accesse, and dispute of our faith with moderate perswading and disswading, and to haue all controuersies tried vpon the touch-stone of Gods truth; come and heare vs, and tell me wherein you are vnsatisfied. If it bee a blessing to haue sociable conuersation, and yet with honourable respect to continue the freedome of neighbourly meetings, exempted from this intolerable yoake of iealousie and suspition, to loue one another with those comfortable conditions of charity, to seast without scandall, to entertaine without repining, and to be merry without lasciuiousnesse? Examine the disposition of vs all generally, and setting mens imperfections aside, which follow life, as the shadow the sunne, and tell me where is lesse offence in so great fulnesse offelicity. If it be a blessing to make the best vse of natures blessings, to be rather helpfull, then indigent of others help, to be at peace with all the Kingdomes of the world, to haue confining Princes gratefie vs by Embasie, to haue the greatest Monarchs allied, or desiring our alliance, to welcome all comers with a noble and correspondent inuitation, and to thriue euery day more &amp; more in the propagation of our worth, Take vp the example, put vs to the triall, and see whether I speake vaine-gloriously. To conclude with the best of all blessings, if it be a blessing to liue in expectation of a royall succession, to bee confident of hopefull Princes, to haue adioyning countries study our obseruation,

to see our owne country and people flourish with all abundance, and to suspect nothing but the corruptions of greatnesse, through wantonnesse and ease: looke vpon vs; pensill out our defects, if you can, and let not emulation, which sometimes dependeth on vertuous deserts and desires, bee turned into enuy, or so attended on by malice, that you will not yet confesse our neernesse in matching our example, when I am sure no Kingdome is so beautified with vnstainable colours.
                     But you will say, for all this, we neither fetch gold from Ophir, nor are our cities and buildings of any sufficiency, to hold out against a military expugnation, nor satisfie the high looking eyes of magnificence. To the first, I answer directly, we may if we list, either fetch treasure where it is, or bee the cause, that it shall bee brought vs euen to the doores of our Exchequer in peace. For I am sure, we haue not onely ships and men, but such hands and spirits, as with Dauids Worthies, can pull the speares out of the hands of the Philistims, and with Sampsons riddle take meat out of the eater, and sweetnesse from the strong, and who shall hinder vs? I hope not Spaine, if there were such occasion, nor the gallies of the middle-land sea, nor the confederate Princes of Italy, nor the Turkish Carmisans or gallies, nor the fortifications of China, nor any one worldly Monarch. But see the conditions of true worthinesse; valour and a noble spirit dare doe no wrong, and our excellent King (out of true addictions to vprightnesse) hath rolled vp all ensignes of defiance, and therefore will not infringe the honourable couenants of his compacted peace, nor giue example to his sonne, to stirre the poole of Silo, vntill the Angell descend for the good of the people.
                     
                        
Concerning our buildings and cities: first for the gloriousnesse and brauery of them; I answer, Ars non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem, and men are too preiudicate, that either condemne vs for want of knowledge; or effeminate, that vilipend vs for defect of formality; because of mine owne knowledge, I dare say, generally there are not so many beautifull Churches, handsome castles, glorious palaces, sweet townes, stately houses, and of great capacity, and delicate structures, within the circular dimension of so much ground in the world: so that if our Gentle-men (admitting the custome of liuing in cities, as they doe in most parts of Europe) would compact all the edefices and conuenient houses of a shire within a wall, or that we were sited in a continent, like the through-fares of France, Germany, or Italy, we might questionlesse haue more glorious, great, and populous cities, then any one kingdome vnder heauen. Secondly, for the strength; what care wee for extraordinarie fortifications amongst our selues, the onely darings of presumption, and inducements to vnnaturall treasons, when times and worthy gouernment so curbs the ambitious subiect from any dangerous attempt, that they are so farre from affrighting the Prince, or one another, with factious hostility, that they can quickely vnite themselues for the common good: as for the feare of forraine enemies, and inuasion of any enraged foe, wee haue the sea for our walls, the shores as strong as brasse, and such a nauy for our defence, that I protest my heart leaps for ioy, when I see the channell so plentifully stored, the Kings harbours so magnificently filled, and know that all the hauens of the world entertaine vs for one respect or another. But say, we doe not this way put the ambitious man in any hope ofthriuing in fowle pretension offormidable

actions against the peace of our State: or the quiet man in any feare, that well fortified places may be surprized by treasons, and maintained by power, to the disturbance of the whole Realme, and animating forraine Princes to expect such coadiutement by corrupted and abused men. I am sure we come neerer our example (some frontire townes or speciall landing places excepted) both for hospitality and the generall blessings of the kingdome, reciprocally imparted to poore and rich. And for our other townes and villages, such as they are, considering the vse and necessity of trauell, surmount by farre the Hosteries and deformed villages of other nations, and am sure, if you let loose the Queen of cities, as you terme Paris; the Sacra Porta; or the beautifull, as Constantinople; the impossible within the impossible, as Venice; the happy and fashionable, as Augusta; the populous, as Norremberg; the great, as Millane; the delicate, as Florence; the Gentle, as Naples; the spatious, as Cracow, Mosco, Cayro, and tripartite Prage: not one of them all (as for infinite other towns, they are not once to be named to this purpose) can looke so bigg, or angerly vpon our LONDON: but shee can affront them with a matching countenance; yea, ouermatch them in many seuerall exercises and excellencies, wherein for your better instruction we will dispute a little.

                           . concise a question; more then the new gallery of the Lovure, and the suburbs of St. Germanes, as it is now re-edified, what one thing is worthy obseruation or wonder within Paris: as for London, but that you will say my particular loue transporteth mee, it hath many specialities of note, eminence, and amazement; &amp; for greatnes it selfe, I may well maintain, that if London and the places adioyning were circummunited in such an orbicular manner, it would equall Paris for all the riuers winding about, and the fiue bridges sorting to an vniformity of streets: and as wee now behold it, the crosse of London is euery way longer then you can make in Paris, or any citie of Europe: but because peraduenture you will not vnderstand what I meane by this word crosse, it shall bee thus explained, that from St. Georges in Southwarke to Shoreditch South and North; and from Westminster to St. Katherines or Ratcliff, West and East, is a crosse of streets, meeting at Leaden-Hall, euery way longer, with broad spaciousnesse, handsome monuments, illustrious gates, comely buildings, and admirable markets, then any you can make in Paris, or euer saw in other city, yea Constantinople it selfe. Concerning multitude of people, if you take London meerely as a place composed of Marchants,

Citizens, and Trades-men, the world neuer had such another: If you conioyne the suburbs, Southwarke, Westminster, St. Katherines, and such like, it exceeds Paris euen for Inhabitants, or if you will come to vs in a terme time, according to our custome of resorting together, I hope you may bee encountred either with hands or swords, as for Paris, you know the better halfe, euen of the indwellers, are Gentle-men, Schollers, Lawyers, and belonging to the Cleargy: the Marchant liuing obscurely, the Trades-man penuriously, the Crafts-man in drudgery, and altogether insolent and rebellious vpon the least distasting, vnaccustomed impositions, or but affrighted with the alteration of ridiculous ceremonies. But let vs search our comparison a little further: insteed of a beastly towne and dirty streets, you haue in London those that be faire, beautifull, and cleanely kept: insteed of foggy mists and clowds: ill aire, flat situation, miry springs, and a kinde of staining clay, you haue in London a sunne-shining and serene element for the most part, a wholesome dwelling, stately ascension, and delicate prospect: insteed of a shallow, narrow, and sometimes dangerous riuer, bringing onely barges and boats with wood, coale, turff, and such countrey prouision: you haue at London a riuer flowing twenty foot, and full of stately ships, that flie to vs with marchandize from all the ports of the world, the sight yeelding astonishment, and the vse perpetuall comfort: so that setting the vnconstant reuolutions of worldly felicity aside, who shall oppose against our nauy, and if wee would descend to inferiour roomes, the riuer westward matcheth Paris euery way, and supplieth the city with all commodities, and at easier rates: In steed of ill fauoured woodden bridges, many times endangered with tempests and frosts,

you haue in London such a bridge, that without ampliation of particulars, is the admirablest monument, and fir
                        
                           •…
                         erected structure in that kinde of the Vniuerse, whether you respect the foundation, with the continuall charge and orderly endeauours to keepe the arches substantiall, or examine the vpper buildings, being so many, and so beautifull houses, that it is a pleasure to beholde them, and a fulnesse of contentment to vnderstand their vses conferred vpon them. Insteed of an olde Bastill and ill-beseeming Arsenall, thrust as it were into an outcast corner of the City, you haue in London a building of the greatest antiquity and maiesticall forme, seruing to most vses of any Citadle or Magazin that euer you saw. For the Tower containeth a Kings palace, a Kings prison, a Kings armoury, a Kings mint, a Kings ward-robe, a Kings artilery, and many other worthy offices: so that the Inhabitants within the walls haue a Church, and are a sufficient parish. Insteed ofan obscure Louure, newly graced with an extraordinary gallery, the onely palace of the King neere Paris. In London his Maiesty hath many houses, parkes, and places of repose, and in the countries dispersed such a number of state, receipt, and commodity, that I protest I am driuen to amaze, knowing the defects of other places, nor doe I heere stretch my discourse on the tenterhookes of partiality, or seeme to pull it by the by-strings of selfe-conceit or opinion: but plainely denotate what all true hearted English-men can auerre, that to the crowne of our Kingdome are annexed more castles, honors, forrests, parkes, houses of State, and conueniency to retire vnto, from the encombrances of the hurliburly of cities, then any Emperor or King in Europe can challenge proprio iure. Insteed of an old ruinous palace, as they terme their house

of Parliament, Hall of Iustice, concourse of Lawyers, or meetings of certaine Trades-men or Milleners, like an Exchange, and as it were promiscuè, confounding all together: we haue in London such a Circo for Marchants, with an vpper quadrant of shops, as must needs subiect it to forraine enuy, in regard of the delicacy of the building, and statelinesse in the contriuing. We haue in London a second building for the ease of the Court, profit of the Artizan, and glory of the city, which for any thing my outward sence may iudge of, can equall the proudest structure of their proudest townes, though you should name St. Marks Piazza in Venice, for so much building. We haue in London a Guild Hall for a State-house, and Westminster for generall causes of the Kingdome; two such roomes, that without further dispute, maketh strangers demand vnanswerable questions, and gently brought to the vnderstanding particulars, lift vp their hands to heauen and exclaime, O happy England! ô happy people! ô happy London! and yet I must confesse, that the hall at Padoa, and great counsellchamber in Venice, be roomes of worthy note, and sufficient contentment. We haue in London diuers palaces for resort of Lawyers &amp; their Clients, &amp; other offices appropriate, all workes rather of ostentation to our selues, then imitation to others. Insteed of narrow dirty streets, neither gracefull to themselues, nor beautified with any ornament, wee haue spacious, large and comely streets, exposing diuers workes of peace, charitie, and estimation. Insteed of obscure Churches, we haue first the goodliest heap of stones in the world, namely Pauls; next the curiousest fabricke in Europe, namely Westminster chapple, and generally all our Churches exceede for beauty, handsomnesse, and magnificent building, as framed of hard stone and

marble, and exposed with a firme and glorious spectacle, as for the Dona of Florence, St. Marcks in Venice, St. Marcks in Millane, the Noterdame at Paris, and some others in Germany (the steeple onely at Strasborough except, which is denominated Beautifull, for the height and handsomnesse) they are either buildings of bricke, or conceited structures like a fantasticall bird-cage of a little inlayd or mosaijcke worke, worthy of applause from such as respect new dainties, and not to bee ouerpassed for curious pictures and paintings: where yet by the way you must obserue, that in those daies of superstition, and particulars of ostentation, concerning rich hangings, imageries, statues, altar-cloths, roods, reliques, plate, pictures, and ornaments, other Churches and monasteries of Europe come farre short of our glory and Popish brauery. Insteed of Gentle-men on dirty foot-clothes, and women in the miry streets: the one with an idle Lacquey or two; the other with no company of respect: wee haue fashionable attendancy, handsome and comely going, either in Carosse, Coatch, or on horsebacke, and our Ladies and women of reputation, sildome abroad without an honourable retinue. Insteed of a confusion of all sorts of people together, without discouery of qualitie or persons, as Citizens, Lawyers, Schollers, Gentlemen, religious Priests, and Mechanickes, that you can scarse know the one from the other, nor the master from the man. In London the Citizen liues in the best order with very few houses of Gentle-men interposed, and in our suburbs, the Nobility haue so many and stately dwellings, that one side of the riuer may compare with the Gran Canale of Venice. But if you examine their receipt and capacity, Venice and all the cities of Europe must submit to the truth. Nay' in London and the places adioyning,

you haue a thousand seuerall houses, wherein I will lodge a thousand seuerall men with conueniency: match vs now if you can. Insteed of a poore Prouost and disorderly company of Marchants and Trades-men, we haue a Podesta or Maior, that keepeth a Princely house, wee haue graue Senatours, comely Citizens, seuerall Halls, and authorized Corporations, all gouerned by religious Magistracy, and made famous by triumphant solemnities: so that our best Gentry are delighted with the spectacle, and strangers admire the brauery.
                     To conclude, if you looke on and in our London truly, as it is composed of men following trades &amp; occupations, there is not such a city, such a gouernment, such a method of conuersation, such a vnity of good fellowship, such a glasse to see vnity and beauty in, such a treasury of wealth, such a store-house of all terrestriall blessings vnder the sunne. If you will view it without at all times, and yet consider the customes of keeping our country houses, you will say there are not so manie Gentle-men in anie place, nor gathered together to better purpose, nor can the varietie of Paris bring you into the walks of such pleasure, with so little charge and offence, as London. For with vs our riding of horses, musique, learning of all Arts and Sciences, dancing, fencing, seeing of commedies or interludes, banquets, masques, mummeries, turnaiments, shewes, lotteries, feasts, ordinarie meetings, and all the particulars of mans inuention to satiate delight, are easie expences, and a little iudgement with experience, will manage a very meane estate to wade through the current of pleasure, although it runne to voluptuousnesse. But if you come to our Court, I hope you finde not such another for stately attendants, dutifull seruice, plentie of fare, resort of Nobles,

comelinesse of Ladies, gallantrie of Gentles, concourse of people, princely pastimes, noble entertainment, and all things befitting the Maiestie of a King, or glorie of a nation: so that I may say for London, as the King of France answered the Emperors tedious titles with France, France, France, and nothing but France: so crie I London, London, London, and nothing but London, to their proudest and all their cities. And thus much for Paris: now to Constantinople.
                     
                     What I haue said of Paris by way of comparison, concerning Constantinople described, and compared with London the gouernment and orderly managing the affaires of a citie, I may well conclude against Constantinople: but because this imperiall place looketh with a more maiesticall countenance then other cities, and lifteth vp (as it were) a daring head against all contradiction, for her superioritie: I must needes pensill out the line of her praises at some length, and tell you truely, wherein her worthinesse consisteth, and yet may deceiue opinion without true iudgement. Constantinople, otherwise called Stanbole, the Beautifull, hath a handsome and formall triangle of a wall, the first part whereof reacheth from the seuen towers (which is a place for suppliment of a prison, a treasurie, and ward-robe) vnto the Seralio, some three English mile. The second from the Seralio to Porta del Fieume, a little more and both toward the sea, which runneth one way betweene Asia and Europe into the Euxinum, and another way to encounter a pretty fresh water riuer, beyond the North of Pera. And the third ouerlooketh the fields of Thracia, with a greater compasse and strength, because it is a double wall, and openeth three or foure gates, as Andrinople, Gratianople, the Tower gate, &amp;c. into the countrey, which flourished when Pausanias was contented with the

title of Duke and Captaine of the Spartanes, and built this wonderfull towne by the name of Bizantium, in honour of his father Bize, who was Admirall of the Grecian Nauy, when Thebes, and other cities stroue for superiority. The wal is orderly beautified with square towers of hard stone, whose equall distance makes a reasonable shew, but that it resembles a painted Curtezan of outward good becomming, yet within full of corruption and danger. For concerning the streets, citizens, houses, or order of a well compacted Common-wealth, it retaineth nothing comming neere our London, or happinesse. The situation is yet a stately ascent from the sea, as if it had a pride to mocke at the swelling of any tempest: and embolden the Marchant with the security of the Sacra Porta, being indeede the goodliest habour in the world, twenty fathom deep close to the shores of two cities. Thus it containeth ten English mile in circumference, hauing no suburbs, and shewing much waste ground in the vnfrequented places toward the land, especially where the Bashawes houses are sequestred from the hurliburly of the Trades-man.
                     The Seralio is the palace of the Gran Signeur, yet is a Why Seralio name appropriate to diuers sequestred places, wherein his women are detained, and hath questionlesse the deriuation from our Latin word Sera, or locked vp: it is a receptacle for diuers thousands, enclosing as much ground, as St. Iames parke. For the courts are very large, with seuerall guards of Ianizaries, according to the necessity of the times, or neernesse to the Emperours person. The gardens spacious, with embattelled walls, stored with artillery, the gates most of them iron, kept by Capogies: the buildings are many and stately, bearing in their front certaine Dowana's or open hals, which haue trauesses of Persian stuffe, and

are roomes of great receipt, wherein the officers of the palace sit in open view at their feasts and diet. The banquetting-houses, wherein his concubines and boyes are aparted from the court hurliburly, expose diuers manner of structures, and seeme indeede seuerall palaces, amongst whom there is one called a Caska without the wall of the Seralio close to the sea-side where hee accustometh to take his gally, of the delicatest and richest presence, that euer I beheld: for it is a quadrant of seuen arches on a side cloyster wise, like the Rialto walke in Venice, in the midst riseth a core of three or foure roomes with chimnies, whose mantell trees are of siluer, the windowes curiously glazed, &amp; besides protected with an iron grate all guilt ouer most gloriously: the whole frame so set with opals, rubies, emeralds, burnisht with golde, painted with flowers, and graced with inlayed worke of porphery, marble, iet, iasper, and delicate stones, that I am perswaded there is not such a bird cage in the world. Vnder the walls are stables for sea horses called Hippopotami, which is a monstrous beast taken in Nilus, Elephants, Tygres, and Dolphines: sometimes they haue Crocadiles and Rhinoceros: within are Roebuckes, white Partridges, and Turtles, the bird of Arabia, and many beasts and fowles of Affrica and India. The walkes are shaded with Cypres, Cedars, Turpentine, and trees which wee onely know by their names, amongst which, such as affoord sustenance, are called figs, almonds, oliues, pomegranets, limons, orenges, and such like: but it should seeme, they are heere as it were enforced, and kept in order with extraordinary diligence: for the sunne kisseth them not with that freuency, as may make them large, or ripen in their proper kindes.
                     The city is very populous toward the harbour, the Besesteine,
                        
Bashawes houses, Mosques, conduits, tombs and monuments, open as it were a store-house of magnificent workes: yet when I read, that Constantine vnplumed Rome, and as it were robbed all the world, making this place accessary to the theft, and cannot finde the particulars in mine inuentory, I maruell who hath either dared to purloine them, or presumed to ruinate and deface them. For the cheefest structures and monuments are now the great Seralio, the lesser Seralio's, the seuen towres, the double wall, diuers Bashawes houses, before some of which are spacious quadrants graced with antiquities, recording the ancient manner of turnaiments, when the Greekes flourished: the Mosques or Temples, amongst whom the Sophia, Solimana and Amorata, are indeed heaps of ostentation and fabricks of great delight, the place called Iobs tombe, sequestred for the buriall of the Emperours children, who are commonly all strangled on the day of his elder sonnes inauguration by Mutes, and then enclosed in coffins of Cypres, and so receiued by the Mufti into chapples consecrated for that purpose; the Patriarcks house; certaine Balnea's; Aquae ductus; Constantines palace; and the Towers on the wall. To these you may adde the Besesteine, a place like our Exchange, for varietie of marchandize, market of virgins, selling of slaues, and the vaults vnder ground fenced with iron gates to secure their treasure, which especially belongeth to the Iewes, who farme the office of Dacij or customes, and are (as it were) the Turkes receiuers, so that these places must needes bee strongly guarded, both to preuent the furie of the Ianizaries, who are very irregular in their tumults, and the extremity of fire and earth-quakes, to whose violence the Citie is many times subiect.
                     
                        
The next diuision is of Galata, a city ouer against it diuided onely by sea, no broader heere then our Tamisis, of great antiquity, walled about, and retaining a particular name and renowne, for holding out a yeere and better, after Constantinople was surprized: it standeth likewise vp a hill, and equals it both for beastlinesse, confusion, and vncomely streets and houses: heere liue many Greekes, and the Francks, as they terme the Papists (of what nation soeuer) haue a Church by permission; the Curtezan likewise liueth at some liberty; yet is it death for any Christian to lie with a Turkish woman or Iew.
                     The third part of this great city comprehendeth the vine of Pera, which is a huge suburbs, compassing Galata round about, a place of quiet dwelling, good aire, and pleasant gardens: yet in regard the many thousand tombs of Turkes (for you must know, that neither Turke, Iew, nor Christian, interre any corps in their Mosques or city, except they build a chapple of purpose, or haue the priuiledge of the Franck Church) fill vp a great quantity of ground, with disordered, confused noysome, and fearefull graues. On the one side toward the north-east, you haue an Arsenall for gallies, a little beyond, a handsome Seralio, &amp; somwhat further a pretty fresh water riuer, as if they lay in sequence, by whose banks are certaine houses erected of purpose, for the pleasure &amp; reposednes of speciall Bashawes. On the other side toward the south-west, the office of artilery called Tapinaw, inuiteth you to the view of such ordnance and munition, that for number, greatnesse, and vse, surmount any one city of Europe: you haue likewise another Seralio, and in these suburbs are resident the English, French, and Venetian Ambassadours: as for the Persian, Emperours of Germany, and Polacks, they

liued in the great city, and sometimes visited one another, as either necessitie of businesse, or pleasure of inuitation affoorded.
                     The last quarter of this diuision affoordeth the obiect of a towne in Asia called Scideron, or Scideret, betweene which and Constantinople, the sea runneth 20. English mile in length, and onely two in bredth, as farre as Pompey's pillar and the blacke Tower, resembling a lace fringed with spangles and purles: for the Bashawes and Chawses houses, so stand on both sides, as if they were made to answer a proportion of handsomnesse: but when time and a daies trauell hath taken away the pleasure of this spectacle, then fall you into a larger gulph, once called Euxinum mare, now the blacke sea, extending a thousand mile, as farre as Trebisond: on the farther shore of the continent now called Russia, is shouldred vp close Maeotis Palus; into which the great riuer of Tanais sendeth his streames, as if a messenger of glad tydings and businesse should hasten to discharge his duty. Thus I confesse, if on the towers of the Amorata, or battlements of the Sophia, you beheld all at once, as it were one vnited body, it would equall, if not surpasse London, for spaciousnesse of grounds, some monuments, and diuers palaces and houses: but yet come no way neere my satisfaction, as being defectiue in many things, which I supposed to excell in it, &amp; deficient in all things, wherin a happy countrey supplieth the wants of her enhabitants. For heere is neither good lodging, proportionable fare, free recourse, gracious entertainment, true religion, secure abiding, allowable pleasure, orderly gouernment, or any thing wherein a noble city is made glorious indeed: nor is it so populous as report hath busied vs, but famarialum, and it may be, the plague hauing consumed 80000. and

the army of 200000. deducted, diminished somewhat the glory, &amp; left the rest of the people to enioy more freedome. And thus much for Constantinople. Now a word or two for Venice.
                     
                     
                        Venice I confesse is both rare in situation, and wonderfull for gouernment, as cementing together diuers Ilands with Venice described, and compared with London small bridges, and not trusting their liberty either into the the hands of one Prince, or iudgement of inferiour persons. Thus hath the Duke but a binding voyce, and the sword is carried before the Senate: thus is nothing done without the consent of the Nobility, who are very neere 1500. in number, and the trades-man is in no sort admitted amongst them, till either he purchase the freedome, or deserue it by some heroicke imployment; therefore they doe them wrong, that call the Venetians marchants. For though some of them haue a traffique at sea: yet doe the better sort of the Nobility scorne to trade for profit, and those which are aduenturers, are either newly raised houses, or licensed by the state for speciall purposes: but howsoeuer, hee leaues the managing of affaires to inferiours, and the drudging (as we say) for money, either to the Iew as an Vsurer; or to common banke for the good of the city; or to the Shop-keeper, for the entertaining the concourse of people, sitting at home in ease, and going abroad for some variety of delight, as the true Gentle-men of Naples and Millane accustome, who suppose nothing worthy, which sauours of curbing liberty, and tying them to seruile attendance. But yet in all this, so farre short of our London, as a dumb painted statua of a liuing substance. For neither are the Noble-men permitted the eminency of other natious, nor patible of such degrees, as our greatnesse looketh vpon one another withall: nor can the Marchant

equall the twentieth part of our comparison for number: nor in that which they boast of, which is wealth, can they generally match our Londoners: as for the Trades-man and Shop-keepers, as I sayd before, neither for order, gouernment, libertie of meeting, diet, purchasing of land, delicate furniture, and all the particulars whereby a city is made famous, worthy, or wealthy: onely some few houses haue a handsome shew of comelinesse, and (according to the custome of their stone-buildings) seeme pretty piles for the receipt of a small company. But where are their fiue hundred ships at sea; when all Venice hath not aboue thirty marchant men, and ten galleasses; onely they boast of three hundred gallies, according to the custome of Nauall encounters in the Leuant? where are their voyages and setled aboad in all the harbours in the world? where are their large and braue streets, antique monuments, when their city is scarse eight hundred yeere old, glorious gates, magnificent structures to lodge Princes and all their retinue, houses of entertainment for trauellers and strangers, such as our Tauernes and Inns? where are their conduits and good waters? where are their fields and pleasant walkes? where are their exercises and heroike pastimes? where are their triumphant shewes and magnificent spectacles, with infinite other particulars, wherein they must yeeld, if London had no other Commander then the Maior and Senatours? after this manner could I runne into Affrick, and fetch Cayro; into Russia, for Mosko; into Poland, for Craccow; into Germany, for Augusta, or Norremberg; into Bohemia, for Prage; into Austria, for Vienna; into Spaine, for Leon, or Madrid; into Portugall, for Lisbone; and so in all the rest: but if they were brought before the barre of comparison, they might bee quickly arraigned of

presumption for contending with our London in any of those things, wherein a city looketh vp with a iustifiable countenance, to shew her comelinesse, beauty, glory, brauery or antiquity. But see what it is to embolden a forward man; I am not yet satisfied, vntill I tell you diuers stranger things, and so open the enclosures of knowledge, that you shall enfeoff her with many excellencies, wherin our England is truely imparadized before all nations.

                        WE will begin with the blessing of all blessings, Common places against idolatry: yea the vaine erecting of images. and as the Logicians say, Causa sine qua non, which is RELIGION, or the true worshipping of God, and to bee found amongst vs, or no where in the world: For I hope without further disputing, as I haue spoken else where, wee will exclude euen out of our thoughts, heathenish prophanation, and the filthinesse of idolatry, against which the sharpest arrowes of Gods quiuer are darted, and the Prophets sound out his iudgement, as terribly, as the Angels the trumpets to summon the inhabitants of the earth against the day of doome. But because the Deuill before the generall dissolution must appeare like an Angell of light, and hath taught vs cunning to deceiue our owne soules with false interpretations

of scripture, with the impostures of aequiuocation, with adding and diminishing to and from the booke of life, to which most formidable curses are belonging, with quite extinguishing the second commandement, &amp; other dangerous pollutions infecting the Churches of Europe: I thought it not amisse both to discouer the enormities of the 1. Greeke, and 2. Latine superstition, and muster together some pretty forces out of Gods campe against the 3. pride of the Popish Cl

                     When Rahel stole her fathers idols, there was much adoe in the search, and Laban would faine haue pickt a quarrell with Iacob: but God foreseeing the wretchednes of his minde, preuented the mischiefe, and laughed mans invention to scorne, euen before the Law was established: But presently so soone as the LORD had prescribed them, what to relie vpon, euen twise in one chapter the gods of siluer and gold were forbidden, and a sentence pronounced, that hee which offred vnto any gods saue vnto the LORD should be slaine: wherevpon by a diuine inspiration, Iacob reformed his houshold by putting away the idols, termed in scripture, clensing, purging, and pleasing of God. If you come forward to Moses gouernment: neuer any temptation traduced him for impatience, being the meekest man on earth, as at the making the golden calfe in Horeb, and the folly of Aaron, which brought 3000 men to destruction: but looke a little further, and all fellowship with Idolaters is forbidden;

and whereas the wickednes of mans inuention had so farre enlarged it selfe, as to terrifie one another with the mischiefe wrought by Deuils, imposturing them yet withall by a cunning art of pacification in offering sacrifices, and vowes to that purpose, God interdicted the same, and Moses flatly prohibited such abomination: yea in the 20 of Leuiticus it was absolute death to offer their children vnto Molech, meaning any kinde of idoll: nay more, such was the ielousie of Gods honor from the beginning, that it was losse of life to blaspheme the name of the liuing, mighty, and onely true God.
                     In the 26 of Leuiticus idolatry is forbidden againe, and the very making of images reputed an vnanswerable sinne; and because the policie of man should be quite defeated, the eternall prouidence is contented to yeeld reasons for the same in the 4 of Deuteronomie 15: yea such sufficient reasons, that we may conclude them positiue lawes to all Nations. First in the third verse, to preuent Reasons why we should not commit

Secondly, because it was wisdome and vnderstanding, wherein the naturall man delighted, to keepe the ordinance of God, vers. 6. Thirdly, because the Lord had done more for them in their deliuerances, than for other Nations, v. 7. Fourthly, because the lawes of God were better, more vpright, and had a fuller iustice in them than the lawes of other Nations, v. 8. Fiftly, because they saw no image in that day, wherein the Lord spake vnto them in Horeb, and out of the fire, v. 15.

Wherevpon when the Iewes were to take possession of the land of the Gentiles, although it might be intended, that there could not be wrought an vtter extirpation at the first; yet did the spirit of God couenant with them, that they should not be at atonement with their abominations, but destroy their idols vtterly: yea a litle further, the very places where the idols were to be erected are to be abandoned, as if he should then say, I will be worshipped, as I command, and not as mans fancy deludeth, wherevpon followed that great curse against the inticers, and seducers to idolatry, and the Magistrates had a strict commandement to preuent the planting of groues and trees, the very nurses of heathenish invention, and to hinder the occasions of solitarie sequestration, whereby were practised Diabolicall arts, Pithonisticall incantations, Cabalisticall secrets, Hieroglyphicall representations, imposturing deuises, and all dangerous sacrifices belonging to the formall perfecting the same.
                     This that is alleaged might be sufficient to vnderstanding men to affright them from affecting either idoll, image, or church-painting: But I will goe a litle further, and wade in the foord of this swelling streame, which from the springs of the Prophets ouerflow the fields of all countries: but how? euen by shouldring aside the proud cast-vp-banks of opposition, and threatning Gods vengeance

against such as dare perpetrate such 
                           •…
                        llicit actions. So that if I store this discourse with some collected abstracts, intimating nothing from enuy, or malice against the greatnes and wealth of other Kingdomes, which are Idolaters, I hope we shall thereby auoide in our selues the least sauouring of those monstrous customes of India, China, or other dangerous Kingdomes, and adulterate excuses The foolish excuse of Idolaters. of misled Christians, who thus farre agree with the grossest idolaters, that their images are but representations of more excellent spirits, and no man is so senselesse to kneele to, or adore the dumbe and dead things, but onely to resuscitate our stupide memories, either of God, or his Saints, in regard the nature of man is so slender of it selfe, and the condition of the Diety so gentle to giue way to any thing, which may further the adoration of his glory, and the confirmation of our saluation: in both which how grosse and palpably they abuse the great and wise God, and deceiue ignorant and simple men, shall here appeare.
                     In the 17. of Deuteronomie there is as it were a solemne quest of enquiry against the peruerters of true religion in this kinde, and the conclusion tendeth to the punishment of stoning to death; and because we should haue no starting hole or tricke to deceiue our selues, God is contented in the 28 to establish to his people a contract of blessing, and cursing, all tending to discouer the vses and reasons of either: following it so farre, that he plainely nameth idolatry, or if you will, erecting of images, for any cause to exasperate his displeasure, that plagues, punishment, and vtter extirpation must follow: to which end and purpose Iosua's exhortation for the worshipping the onely, true, and wise God, and after his owne onely, true, and

wise way, was so enlarged, commended, and applauded after his so many and great victories, and established quietnes. How neere to vtter destruction, and desolation, were the Israelites in the time of the IVDGES, when the Angell rebuked the people for liuing wickedly in the sight of the Lord, and seruing Baalam, wherevpon followed a casting them away by God, and the hands of Midian fettred them in chaines seuen yeere: nor could the Princes of Iuda deliuer them, although Gedeon began well, and set vp preuailing on his strongest legs, to stand vpright for their behoofe. But what followed? He and all his house fell into the pit of destruction: and wherefore? for making an ephod, wherein hee presumed yet to doe well; but it was the step and staire of idolatry, and that the cause of a following vengeance; then if you looke into Micahs story, you shall finde that euery man did what was good in his owne eyes, whereby ensued murthers, rapes, robberies, and such like intolerable enormities, all hauing their current from this spring, that his mother made him images of siluer, and he consented to the wicked worke. If you ouerlooke the story of Sampson, howeuer hee lost his strength, and was inflicted with a seuere punishment, of being bereaued of his sight, and disgracefull captiuity; yet you saw, as the Eagle casts her bill to renew her youth, for the punishment of Idolaters, God raised vp another wall of fortification, and when his vigour was restored, he pulled downe the prophane temple vpon the heads of two thousand soules: when the Philistins brought the arke of God into the house of Dagon, the Idoll fell downe before it, and the men of Ashdod were plagued for abusing the same. Did not Salomon reioyce in all worldly felicity, and was not the mantle of pleasure and happinesse spred before

him? vntill he fell to idolatry, then did his priuate enemies cast it out of sight, and God diuided ten Tribes from his sonne, which was a strange disparity, considering his father built the Temple, consecrated the same, and blessed the people. Wherein was God so offended with Ieroboam, that he made him the capitall authour of the sins of Israel? but by reason of his golden calues, the punishment whereof was thus farre extended; His sonne died, his hand was dried vp with leprosie, the seduced Prophet was killed by a Lyon, and the same Abiah that made him King, confirmed the extirpation of his family, and for all his wife went to delude him, yet she heard the iudgement of terrour, which she could not preuent. In the story of Ahab, what was the cause of so many troubles in Israel, tyranny in the Common-wealth, murthering of Gods Prophets, vsurpation of other mens inheritances, wickednesse of Iezabel, witchcrafts, whoredomes, and in the end a generall defection from his obedience, and coniuration against his house, was it not idolatry? wherupon followed the slaughter of the King, the casting the Queene out of a window, the killing of Baals Prophets, first by Eliah, then by Iehu, and an vtter confusion in Iuda and Israel.
                     
                     Wherein was Iehoiada so acceptable to God, as when he destroyed the altars of Baal, and layd his images on a heape? looke amongst all the Kings of Iuda, or Israel; and whereas you finde some of them murthered, some of them deposed, some of them taken away in the pride of their yeeres, some of them lepers, and some of them carried into captiuity: it was all by reason of idolatry, &amp; transfounding the adoration of the onely true God, with the infectious leprosie of mens traditions: thus Azariah of Iuda became a Leper, Zacharia of Israel was slaine by Shallum,
                        
                        Shallum by Menahen, and Menahen purchased his peace of Assyria by money. The wicked idolatry of Ahas, and that horrible consecration of his sonne in fire, was a motiue of trouble and desolation to all Ierusalem. Hosea King of Israel was ensnared, and he and his realme caught in the net of Assyrian policy, by reason of their confidence in Idols, &amp; that euery one worshipped the God of his nation, contrary to Moses Law; but what ensued? curses, plagues, vtter desolatenesse, adumbration of the sunne-shine of heauenly fauours, and when they presumed of well-doing, in making a hotchpotch of religion in Samaria, the Lyons of the forrest came into the city, and deuoured both Priests and people.
                     When Manasses restored idolatry, giuing life to filthy prophanation, which viper-like abused the curtesie of him which warmed her, and stung him to death. I will bring (sayes God) an euill vpon Iuda and Ierusalem, that who heareth of it, both his eares shall tingle, &amp; I will stretch ouer Ierusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Ierusalem, as a man wipeth a dish, and turne it vpside downe: so Ammon was slaine by his seruants, and the poyson of idolatry that had choaked the people of God with the dreggs of abomination, made Iuda so vlcerous and deformed, that God would not know his owne handyworke, but suffered them to be led into captiuity, and brought into the schoole of tyrannous correction.
                     Looke ouer all the prophesie of Esay, where the desolation of Ierusalem is denounced, where the Medes and Persians shall destroy Babel, where Moab must looke for an ouerthrow, where Damascus and Ephraim must come to ruine, where the Aegyptians must be dislocated by the Assyrians,

where Aethiopia, Idumea, and Arabia must grone vnder affliction, where Tyrus must feele the yoke of subiection, and all superbous Monarchies come to ruine: and you shall finde that idolatry is the cause, and principall motiue of Gods wrath against them. nor desisteth he so, but exemplifieth at large, how the full cup of Gods vengeance floweth ouer for following the traditions of men: nay more, certaine curses are exaggerated against such, as either adhere to mans assistance, or are seduced with worldly vanity, and in the 41. chapter, you shall finde an ironicall derision of the Inhabitants of the Ilands, for making of images, and such like bestiall traducements, especially for extenuating the power of God, by introducing the inuentions of man, and mingling worldly deuices with true religion, concluding in the 43. that there is no God but one, nor any worshipping of him, but in spirit and holinesse of life.
                     Looke into the prophesie of Ieremy, and all his Lamentations, and you shall find, why the Iewes were destroyed, why compared to a disobedient woman to her husband, why reprehended for crying out the temple, the temple, and relying vpon the outward ceremonies, why exprobrated for following strange Gods, after the custome of their fathers, why threatned with such plagues, as sauoured of bitternesse &amp; poysoning their outward prosperity, cheefly for idolatry, as more especially 22. Then followeth the word of God, like the voice of a cryer in the wildernesse, against Aegypt, the Philistins, Moabites, Ammonites, Idumea, Damascus, Kedar, and Elam, all in one chapter: nor is it a bare angrie vehemencie; but illustred with many excellent comparisons, not desisting till he leaue Babylon flat on the ground, yeelding reasons for her desolation, because the

nations of the world were made drunke with the carowses out of that golden cup, which shee represented out of the Lords hand, and all to shew the vanitie and wickednesse of idolaters.
                     
                        Ezekiels visions were most against Israel, and his mouth opened the fearefull indignation of the Lord against Ierusalem, because their altars were erected to strange Gods, and that they made images of the sunne, to pollute their soules worse then the carrion of a dunghill: then proceedeth he against them with personating names, calling Samaria and Ierusalem, Aholah and Ohalibah: the end onely to discouer their idolatry, and intimating Gods wrath for their notorious wandring from the true path of knowledge, insomuch that from the parable of a seething pot, Iuda's destruction is threatned: yet for all this, God will not condescend to any treatise of pacification, vntil all the nations round about, namely Edom, Moab, Aegypt, Chaldea, Tyrus, Sidon, Gog, and Magog, taste the bitternesse of the same fruit, corrupted and made irksome by the same transgressions.
                     Was not the adoration of Nebuchadnezzars statua of golde, a strange and notable worke of God against Idolaters? and the history of the Kings humiliation, an instance of terrour and reuenge against the pride and ambition of man? was not 
                           
                              •…
                           altashars tragedy and example of admiration? and would a man desire a better warning to auoyde the punishment of idolatry, and blaspheming the true God? did not Daniels miraculous deliuery from the Lyons strike the Heathen with amazement? and brought confusion amongst the imaginary vanities: so that Darius himselfe disclaimed the worship of the sunne and fire, according to the ancient manner of the Persians, and proclaimed

exaltation of the eternall Deity indeede.
                     Doth not Hosea threaten the people, because of idolatry, and makes Ierusalem worse then an harlot, telling of the swift comming of their enemies, by the comparison of an Eagle, resembling the Iewes to an empty vineyard, an heart diuided in twaine, and concluding, that her sorrowes shall be like the trauell of a woman in childe-bearing, because of their going a whoring after false Gods, or if you will, counterfet Idols, and colourable images, being no other, nor other waies vsed, then now the Church of Rome accustometh, Romish Idols. by preuaricating true religion, by calling them the bookes of the Laity, by excusing them with an honourable remembrance of the Saints deceased, by corrupting them with filthy painting, and the art of the craftsman, and by a diabolicall erecting them, as if they had life and motion.
                     Doth not Amos (as if a man should runne a race for a reward) passe from one countrey, city, and person to another, with prophesies and threatnings against Moab, Iuda, Israel, the Gouernours of Samaria, and the Princes of the Tribes, adding withall the famine of the word of God, for their abusing true religion, and teaching and practizing a doctrine which God neuer prescribed, nor had any thought correspondent.
                     Was not Michahs voice raised higher and higher against Iuda and Israel, onely for idolatrie? and did not Zephaniah tremble at the disobedience of the Iewes? foretelling their destruction, by reason of their corruption and abomination of Idols. Looke Zechariah cleane ouer, and where the Iewes are affrighted with the exclamation of wants, famin, and ouerthrowes, his warrant proceedeth from this occasion, that the altars of incense smoake vp a pace, but stinke

before the throne of God, sending their vapours backe againe, to choake the Inhabitants of the earth. All Malachies complaints are against the Priests and Seducers of the people, who not onely were wicked themselues, but permitted the rest to be polluted with idolatry. There is scarse one chapter in the booke of wisdome, which doth not pensill out the grosse and palpable running a whoring after the ridiculous adoration of images. To conclude, our Sauiour, the Euangelists and Apostles preach, that the true worshipping of God consisteth in spirituall deuotion, not wordly or carnall circumstances, and inueigh against nothing more then mens traditions, the obseruing the outward letter, the adhering to ceremonies, and with Martha leauing the most needefull thing to bee encombred with worldly vanities and beastly corruptions, to which if you adde that excellent reuelation, it is a plaine discouery of Antechrist, and how the westerne Churches should be infected with the contagious diseases of trumperies, idolatry, and diuellish interpretation of Scriptures, I durst say a Iewish contradiction of the truth, and Apostate falling from the maine building of Gods Church. And thus much for Idolatry in generall.

                        SOme define religion, and indeede most truely, thus: Religio est vera 
                        Wherein the Greeke Church is farre from true religion. 
                        cultura Dei, and then I referre you to Monsier de Plessis discourse, wherein he proueth with sufficiencie, that all the customes of the world concerning diuine adoration come short of Christianity: but if you will conuert it thus: Religio est cultura veri Dei, then may you both diuide, subdiuide, and diuide againe, allowing of three Religions; the Iewes, Christians, and Mahumetans, all maintaining the omnipotency of God, and pretending obedience toward the high Creator of all things. But because we hope for our established saluation in the merits and mercies of Iesus Christ, and know, that the excellency of the Trinity is described in the old Testament, when God said, Let vs make man, when the great King saw the image of one like the sonne of man in the furnace, when Iob knew that his Redeemer liued, &amp; when the mysterie of the Trinitie is reuealed in many places: let vs leaue the vanitie of the Heathen with their obstinacie, the abomination of Idolaters with their grosse abuses, the antiquity of the Iewes with their stiffneckednesse, the innouation of the Mahumetans with their errors and impossibilities, and be onely proud of our liuery of Christians. But now we must subdiuide againe, and say, that amongst

Christians there is a tripartite separation. For the Greeke Church runneth one way with the title of East: the Latine Church rangeth another way with the denomination of West: and the reformed Church spreadeth a modest glory with the liberty of Protestants.
                     Concerning the Greeke Church I will be bold to tell you, that I haue heard some of their Protopapans and Archimandritans maintaine their greatnesse, precedency, and truenesse of Religion before the Latine, and thus they assume the defence. For greatnesse it containeth most parts of Armenia, Georgia, Mengrelia neere the Caspian, many places in Natolia, or Asia minor, the Countries of The greatnesse of the Creeke Church. 
                        Aethiopia in Affricke, which may equall them of the West Indies, of whom the Pope doth now boast so much: In Europe all Grecia: many great Ilands (except such as are diuerted Papists, incurring the scandall of Heretickes) Muscouia or Russia: some parts of Poland, Lithuania, Bogdonia, and the shores of the Euxinum, much more ground, then the Pope can challenge, where he is the most offen siue Vsurper.
                     For Precedency it claimeth likewise the prerogatiue, both waies: First, by priority, in regard they were first The precedency of the Greeke Church. Christians, and the Apostles planted Churches amongst them, before either Paul preached at Rome, or Linus was appointed Byshoppe. Secondly, by authority, as by translation of the Empire, from whence Rome challengeth hers: For when there was no such ambition thought vpon Iohn Patriarch of Constantinople, vsurped the title of vniuersall Byshoppe, and practised the supremacy ouer all other Churchmen, by reason the Emperour Constantine had so enobled and enabled the great Citie, where hee would haue the Byshoppe to be principall in regard of the

maiesty of his person and the brauery of the place, and therefore not onely graced him with the elated title of Patriarch, but inuested him with many roialties, and pallaces, and temporall iurisdictions, to which the Byshoppe of Rome did then intercede, interposing a negatiue euen against the very title, disprouing it as Antichristian, and Gregory surnamed the Great. traduced Iohn the Patriarch, as a wicked and malicious man for practising such ostentation: nor desisted he so, but writ whole volumes of letters tending to a manner of defamation: some entreating him to disclaime such elation of heart: some disalowing the presumption, as exorbitant in a Byshoppe, who should rather imitate the humilitie of Christ: some thundring the cursed prediction of Antichrist by such apostacy, and all of them disswading the true Ministers of Gods word from poysoning their preciously redeemed soules with the venome of pride, and vaine-glory: then followed the fearefull history of Nauclerus a strong papisticall writer, on whom they lay the imputation of a fable: But he saies plainely, that that very instant, in which Constantine the great enfeoffed the Nauclerus. Church with temporary lands, and sumptuous edifices, the heauens seemed to frowne, the aire was thickned with a cloude, the earth troubled with a tempest, and after great thunder and lightning, a voice was heard; now is poyson throwne into the pure streame of Gods truth. Vpon this the matter was a while respited with a grant only of sitting downe first at generall Councells, naming in Commissions, and the binding voice in equality of censuring; all which, if they were priuiledges, enlarged first the precedency of the Patriarch of Constantinople.
                     
                     Afterward, when the sinnes of the Empire, like a fluent streame ouer-spread the bankes of his enclosures, and that

God determined the vtter subuersion of all: two wicked men contriued the most lamentable desolation, both of the gouernment of the Empire, &amp; religion of the Church, which were Phocas and Bonifacius; the one conspiring thus with the other against God and Angells, against heauen and earth, against men and Deuills, that to establish Phocas in the Empire of Constantinople, he would be contented, that Bonifacius of Rome should be consecrated with the title of Vniuersall Byshoppe; whereupon Phocas by the murther of his Master Mauritius and other inhumane treacheries was inuested Lord of the Easterne Monarchy, and Bonifacius by the cousoning his Predecessor Siluester, and other religious practises obtained the papacy: insomuch that Platina and diuers of their owne writers (amongst other pasquills and satiricall inuections) exclaime, that he came in like a fox, raigned as a lyon, and died like a dogge: so that all premises considered, if there be a necessitie in any such precedency, the Roman Byshoppes be but vsurpers. For Constantinople had it at generall Councells, and was permitted all the fauour of titles, which the Church, and most Christian Emperour collated at that time.
                     Concerning the truth, it is well knowne, that Peter of whom they boast so much was Byshoppe of Antioch 
                        The verity of the Greek Church. 20. yeares, and those of Asia the first reputed Christians in the world; so that euen from Scripture it selfe and Pauls perigrination, many plentifull collections enlarge his history and life with warrantable knowledge of what we must trust vnto. As for his visiting of Rome, howeuer Eusebius adhereth to some formall discoueries, and other Authors produce instances of his owne death and daughters Martyrdome vnder Nero, it is both fanaticall, imaginary,

and vnwarrantable by Scripture: nay I will say more, neither by collected circumstances, probable coniectures, or authenticall Authors is there any inducement to beleeue it: But say he did visit Rome, and conferred with Paul, what sense, reason, or honesty can allow the translation of his owne Byshopricke out of Asia into Europe, an intrusion into another mans iurisdiction. For Paul was constituted to be the light of the Gentiles, and lost his head at Rome in iustifying his innocency: how then could Peter be condemned of so functory a negligence, that being appointed to the dispersed Iewes of Asia, hee would vilipend them, and intrude himselfe into the gouernment of the Gentiles of Italy: so then considering Antioch and the 7. Churches spoken of in the Apocalips, were the first receiuers of the Gospell, from whence the Greekes in Europe were the next embracers of the truth, who can oppose against her residence and conseruation rather, where it was first published, then in Italy, and the remoter places of Europe, whereas yet some of their Countries are not quite purged from Paganisme.
                     Thus doe they dispute, and with stomachous ardency enueigh against the pompous and ostentous glory of the latine Church, putting them to silence, as our Sauiour did the Pharisies, when hee questioned their opinion of Iohns baptisme, &amp; exprobrated them for aduancing the Hidra's head of confusion through enormous ceremonies, and mens traditions, wherein they saw the inconueniences before their faces, that they were not onely patible of alteration, but would grow in time to a Congeries and mountaine of deformitie, as men &amp; deuises did augment them: notwithstanding time being weary of stabilitie, and the Deuill affraid of impeachment in his kingdome, hath

scattered many corruptions in the fields of Gods farmes, which haue ouergrowne the seedes of verity in these parts, that it now resembleth the corne sowne amongst tares, which choaked the growth of the best seede, and came vp with such a violent ouerspreading, that at haruest there was little benefit to the owner. For all the Greeke Churches are very small, full of idle painting, lampes, candles, tapers, and such like: their seruice and language Greeke, and when they write or print it is a reasonable good Character, though farre from the atticke Dialect: and yet I will be bold to say, a good Scholler of our grammer instruction, shall scarce vnderstand the phrase of their common speakers, no more then a southerne man, one borne farre north, or in Scotland. Their Monasteries are poore, vnhansome, and farre from the state of the Romish Church; and surely if in any thing they imitate the Apostles, it is in their scorne of worldly pompe, carelesnesse, wants, and sometimes austerity of life, although naturally they are the merriest and most iouiall men in the world: their chiefe Abbots are called Archimandritans, but all in generall submit to the Episcopo of the Dioces, who weareth coloured apparell of silke with a crosse ouer his hat, which is low crown'd, broad brimmed, and tied vnder his beard with long strings, hee carrieth a crosier in his hand, but it hath a plaine crosse; they call him also Protopapan the first Father of the congregation (from whence the Byshoppe of Rome assumeth his Papa, or if you will the name of Pope) acknowledging the Patriarch of Constantinople at this very instant for supreame, and absolutely contesting against the Popes tyrannicall vsurpation: yea such is their hate to the Latins, I will not name their corruptions and Church, that they had rather liue in slauery and bondage

vnder the Turke, then either implore the aide of Italians for their restitution, or submit to that strange ambition of that Cleargy-man, as some of them ironically tearme the Pope. They obserue foure lents in a yeere, eat flesh on Saturdaies, but on Fridaies and all the lent, with other prohibited times, they neither eat flesh, fish, butter, cheese, or any meat, but like the Christians of Aethiopia, are abstinent beyond reason, the ordinary desire of man, or any prescription of Scripture, or example of the Primatiue Church. They baptize with water and oyle, deny purgatory, neuer cut their haire, adore no pictures, nor images out of the Scriptures, and yet are superstitious in diuers festiuals, as St. Nicholay about sea matters, and Celestinus; St. Demetrius, a feast about the 25. of October, called their drunken feast; and St. George, who as our Ladies Knight hath obtained sufficient reputation. Their marriages, dancings, festiuals and burials, haue the seuerall passages of many and strange ceremonies: but because whole volumes are written against their erroneous superstition, I referre you to such commentaries, concluding; that although they are some way more tolerable then the Romish abuses, yet are their best garments so plighted with errours, and layd vp vnhandsomely with wrinckles, that when you come to vnfold them, you either exclaime against the negligence of the seruant, or carelesnesse of the Master: who should be a better ouerseer. And thus much touching the Greeke Church. Now a little concerning the Latin.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        CHAP. XX. Certaine particulars concerning the Latin Church.
                     
                        THere are so many bookes and disputations concerning the enormities of papisticall religion, that little children can in a manner The corruptions and abuses of the Romish Church. retort an argument, and cite you common places of Scripture, against their absurdities and idle traditions. I will therefore referre you to the larger dilations of matters of faith, and fundamentall points of saluation: and concerning the strength of their props, which now vphold their supremacie and monarchall iurisdiction; in a few leaues of Sr. Edwin Sands his worthy discourse, you shall see them turned vpside downe, as if an arme of Heccate were put into the throat to pull the entrailes outward, and shew you the strange diseases both of heart and lungs: or else examine the paraphrase of the Reuelation, and you shall heare distinctly prooued the seat of Antechrist, the pride of the whore of Babylon, the persecution of the Saints, and the enormities of this Hosean strumpet, that hath broken the bands of her first wedlocke, and bedashed her selfe with lusts loathsome charriot. For mine owne part therefore, I will leaue that common way of inuection, or mustring vp the forces of argument out of the maine battell of Gods word, and breefly summe vp the accounts of her condemnation in this manner. 1. First, concerning their gouernment, it is meere politicall, as allowing all positions of tyranny, reuenge, disloyalty, licenciousnesse, wealth,

and liberty, and wherein Euripides, Demosthenes, Isocrates, Tully, Salust, Perseus, Horace, Sigonius, Lipsius, Machiauell, or any other absolute or moderne writer opened a schoolhouse doore of diuellish deuices and distasting principles, to modest and orderly gouernments: they haue culled out the same to serue their owne turnes, and with the Iesuites, repute all others simple, that cannot labour in the worke of alteration of Kingdomes, and setting Princes at variance to corroborate their owne greatnesse. 2. Concerning religion, it is meerely ridiculous, and a dart out of the quiuer of mans inuention; yea, so Diabolicall and Turkish, that it interdicteth the searching of Scriptures, disputing of matters of faith, or any opposition of their superstitious decrees, councels, and consistorian statutes. 3. Concerning society and conuersation, it is meerely mundane, voluptuous, and sauouring nothing but delightsome liberty: so that if there were not a God to bee prayed vnto and beleeued in, a heauen to bee expected, a saluation to be hoped after, and an account to bee made vpon a dreadfull summons indeed, I had rather be a Cardinall of Rome, then a Noble-man of Naples, who of all the Gentles in the world spred the largest cloth of vanities and voluptuousnesse. 4. And lastly, concerning their seeming vowes to obedience, chastity and pouerty; it is like Ianus face looking two wayes, and with the Lapwigg crying farthest from her nest: for they sauour not one word of truth in the same, as you shal see in the next chapter. So that I will onely relate vnto you three seuerall stories of three seuerall sects, in which the absurdities of the Latin Church most plainely appeare.
                     In Rome amongst diuers others there liued a certaine The story of a conuerted Iew. Iew, who had many controuersies with Christian Friers

about both their religions, alledging for himselfe preuailing arguments against their idolatry, or worshipping of images, wherein they would faine distinguish with the differences of 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         and 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , &amp;c. praying to Saints, prophaning of the Saboth, incontinency of life, and burning candles in the day time, as it were in scorne of the glorious light of the sunne, all which though they were vnanswerable, yet the Frier pleading the calling of the Gentiles, the destruction of the temple, the disanulling of Iewish ceremonies, the birth and comming of Christ, as a prefixed time of another religion, the authority of the same, and the orders of the Church, preuailed so farre with the other, that he enclined a little to bee a Proselite, which the Frier reioyced to heare, triumphing exceedingly at the good successe of his oratory: nay soft (quoth the Iew) it is not thy perswasion hath coapted me to this course, but a certaine impression, that some great and good God is protectour of this place, or the prayers of an holy Patriarch (as Abraham disputed with Iehoua about the sauing of Sodom and Gomorrha) are acceptable to heauen in the behalfe of some vnknowne good men; otherwise the sinnes of Rome are so many, the liues of Priests so corrupt, the wickednesse of men so abominable, the villany of politicks so mischeeuous, and all things so discrepant to true religion and honesty, that I haue wondred a thousand times, how the whole countrey, especially the city, hath beene protected and supported from sinking to hell.
                     At another time, a sober Turke liuing in Rome, and wearied with the riot of their Carneuall or Shroue-tide, at his The story of a Turck concerning his opinion of Rome. returne to Constantinople, being demanded his opinion of the Christians, answerered, that they had some tolerable customes, eat good meat, weare good clothes, or rather

spoyled much stuffe with fantasticke slashing and cutting it, and liued in good townes; but they were madd twice a yeere: For at one time they ranne like Diuels in a play vp and downe the streets with squibs of fire, making a noyse both on horse-backe, and on foot, keeping a coyle with Curtezans and Bawds, sporting with scurrulous and vnmanly gambols, and performing actions of strange vndecencies, which indeed is their time of Carneuall, a time of such sluttishnesse, vnrulinesse, and venerious riot in all the cities of Italy, that in Venice one Iceppo Marcello hath written an inuectiue against it. Shortly after they went howling in the streets like dogges, mourning with lamentable gestures, and whipping themselues vntill the bloud came, and this was on good Friday, when the Penetenciaries are couered ouer with a cassocke of canuasse, except two holes to looke out at, and all to belash themselues, vntill the blood runne downe their shoulders, whereby great Princes are so impostured, that contrary to a maine position of Scripture, against such voluntary humiliation and ridiculous inflictings, they haue entertained the penance, and vndertaken the stripes, witnesse Charles the 5. who left his rod of cords, as a iewell of his tresury to King Philip. Duke Ioieuse, called father Angelo; who returned to his orders, which was a bare-foot, or Mendicant Capuchin Frier, as soone as the league was dissolued, and many other both men and women of noble families, who enioyned penance by their ghostly fathers, either by punishing their bodies, vnsauoury pilgrimages, fasts, abstinence, or such like endurances, are very zealous in the execution, and vpon confidence of some meritorious act, condiscend to dangerous and laborious miseries, yea, terrours abhorring to nature. Now to my olde woman.
                     
                        
It is well knowne, that in the last dayes of Queen Mary, 
                        The story of the olde woman at Strasborogh those dayes of firy triall, our roods and images in England were so palpably abused, and diuellishly stored with deuices, that the Priests had diuers trickes to moue either eies, heads, or hands, yea to make them speake with variety of voyces, and palpable gesture, as if the Idols of Molech and Chemosh were to entertaine the presents of the people, and Bell had life indeede to deuoure the Kings allowance: which course is continued still in many places of Europe, insomuch that a while agoe in the Froe Church at Strasborogh, when certaine olde deuout women came to worship our Lady, the knauish Priests caused the childe to salute them in her armes, and (as it were) courteoufly to thanke them for making such account of his mother, which they not onely wondred at, but seemed in a manner offended, that the sonne should bee so bolde in the presence of our Lady: whereupon one more zealously angry then the rest, cryed out aloud; Peace I pray you young Gentle-man, I haue nothing to doe with you, let me heare what my good Ladie your mother sayes; and so when shee had no further reply, went away discontented.
                     Of this sort in our owne Kingdome of Ireland, in the beginning of his Maiesties raigne, when the townes were Irish deuotion. commanded to frequent the Churches, I was my selfe an eare-witnesse of many strange grudgings and murmurations, amongst which I yet encountred with this facete and indifferent deuotion; while two neighbours of Dublin were disputing about Church-matters, the one an indifferent Protestant, the other a superstitious Papist, and yet so seeming cunning, that she durst dispute between the Popes supremacy and the Kings authority, with a willing minde to satisfie either; her neighbour thus aduised, to goe to

Church a Gods name, and for the Popes sake to say Pater noster, for the Kings Our Father, let God take which hee will: and so it was merrily concluded, and the woman went accordingly to her deuotion. And thus much concerning the Latine Church. The parelell of which with ours would sufficiently shew our happinesse: And this you may see at large deliuered in the workes of many learned Diuines of our Country, to whom I referre you.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. XXI. Another excellencie of ENGLAND, exposing the noble worth of her Princes beyond other Nations.
                     
                        WE will not be so vnciuill, as to awake the The Kings of England haue exceeded for many memorable vertues and actions other Princes. drowsie eyes of antiquitie, or call in question things done so long agoe, that either by-opinion, or the deceit of mens inventions haue bin falsified against all reason and vnderstanding; but quietly maintaine the glory of our moderne Kings, and plainely vphold this position, that we haue had more famous and illustrious Princes since the Conquest, than any gouernment of the earth.
                     If you begin with William of Normandy, his actions and warlike exploits are memorable, his trauels and laborious industry extraordinary, his wisdome in the sedation of the tumults and factions amongst vs wonderfull,

his magnanimitie in setling his Court and Palace admirable, and his successe in all designes vnmatchable.
                     Howeuer William Rufus was so beholding to peace and prosperitie, that he tempred his warlike spirit from affecting either forreine or domesticke dissention; yet did he consecrate many famous workes to the memory of his quietnes, and out of a swelling of princely greatnes, thought Westminster Hall (the wonder of the world for a roome in a house) too litle for so great a Maiestie.
                     
                        Robert of Normandy went in person to Ierusalem, and for his Heroicke successe and exploits might haue bin rewarded with the Diadem, howeuer he was diuerted to returne home againe into the fields of peace.
                     
                        Henry the first was setled in the loue of his people, tamed the French, pacified Normandy, looked after Ireland, terrified his foes, corroborated his friends, loued learning, and was a Maecenas of all worthy conditions either in himselfe, or others; and howeuer the ielousie of soueraigne points intercepted the amitie of the brethren, yet was his worth many waies expatiated, and diuers particulars of estimation extracted from his gouernment.
                     
                        Henry the second obtained the dominion of Ireland, brought to happy period many conflicts in France, stopped the breath of gaping hostilitie in England, lashed the sides of his vnruly children with stripes of discomfiture, and liued in great honor and estimation: insomuch, that he neuer exacted imposition of his people, nor wanted in his warres, yet left a treasure of aboue 200000 pound in ready coine, besides iewels, and plate, which was much in those daies.
                     What thinke you of Richard the first? Were not his voyages, conquests, titles, and surname of Cuer de Lyon for

his valour, and exceeding courage, markes of true honor? Would not his life make a memorable story? Shall not his actions be registred in the court of eternitie? Did he not proue a worthy champion of renowme? Ciprus was wonne, Acon conquered, Ierusalem established, the confederate Princes ielous of his glory, and all the countrey full of his memory: so that considering his tedious iourneyes, the perill of his person, the successe of his actions, and the noble end of his atchieuements, let the proudest of the Othoman race be compared and spare not.
                     The troubles of King Iohn, the Barons warres, the plantation and buildings in Ireland, the discouerie of the Clergies corruption, the calling in of Lewis, the dismissing the French backe againe, and the turbulency of those times may ranke themselues with the fame of very proud Monarks.
                     
                        Henry the third subdued the Welchmen, made sundry voiages into France, had many conflicts with his owne Barons, set forward a notable expedition to Hierusalem, shewed diuers effects of an heroicke and magnanimous spirit, raigned gloriously 56 yeeres, and in the interims of his peace brought many ostentous buildings to perfection.
                     
                        Edward the first went diuers times into Scotland, disposed of that Crowne, as he thought good, subiected them to England; conquered the Welchmen, appeased them with a Prince of his owne sonne borne in Carnaruan; setled his estate, and ended a famous life with a glorious death, to which when renowne and victorie was added, the applause rang through the world.
                     
                        Edward the third, and the blacke Prince haue engrossed the fame and renowne of the vniuersall earth, and many

memorable actions are aduanced vp as trophees of their vnimitable glory; so that they may march to the palace of maiestie with the proudest Emperors. For what worthy atchieuements so euer haue bin perpetuated in England, Wales, Scotland, Almaigne, and Flanders, in their owne persons they haue brought to passe, as if they had bin borne to shew some wonder of nature, and exposed as rare examples to succeeding times. And for his other sonnes, step into the proudest house of Austria, and tell me who can match them? Iohn of Gaunt went twise into Spaine, and conquered Castile in the right of his wife. Lionell Duke of Clarence passed the Alpes into Italy, maried the daughter of Millane, reuelled in those parts with extraordinary cost, pompe, and attendants, and wrought both a reuerence and loue toward his person from forreine people. Edmond of Langley Duke of Yorke was so wise and reposed, that the gouernment of England kept it selfe warme vnder the ouer-spreading of his embraces. Thomas of Woodstocke Duke of Glocester was so true a louer of his country, and champion of honor, that he contested with Maiestie for degenerating from her owne properties, and durst tell his nephew King, wherein he wandred from his paternall renowne.
                     
                        Henry the fourth, when he was but Earle of Hertford, went into Africke, bare his father company into Spaine, and obtained the diadem through popular loue, and respect of the people.
                     And although King Richard the second, was an vnfortunate Prince, yet did he surpasse both auncestors and successors for brauery in apparell, costly expences, sumptuous fare, glorious courtship, noble company, princely reuels, and magnificent estimation: For all the while

Queene Anne of Bohemia liued, the fame of England was dispersed ouer the world, and the King had 8 or 10000 continually in his Court, whereby his pompe and port surpassed other Princes.
                     But would you wonder indeed? Then looke into the 9 yeeres of Henry the fift, and you shall see such a vnitie of vertues, consent of graces, entertainment of valour, perfection of industry, militarie brauery, and fulnes of generous designes, that his very enemies gaue way to the report of his worthy life; and France in his death was left as a comfortles widow, or desolate orphan.
                     I might recite the fame of Edward the fourth, for reuenging his fathers death, many conflicts before and after he was King, his voiages into France, his distastings against Burgundy, his troubles at home, and other princely dispositions.
                     I could also bring into your good opinion the valour of Henry the seuenth, his miraculous deliuery, his noble establishment, his buildings and sumptuous monuments, his riches and wealth, his wisdome and politicke contriuing of affaires, the stately disposing of his Palace, and many other remarkable actions, but I am affraid, that I am too weakly furnished to enter into the lists with iudicious censurers, nor shall be able to wrastle with opinion and seuere examination, which will rather condemne me for slight extenuation in the attempt, than entertaine the discourse, as a befitting subiect, or adapted explication of princelines.
                     
                        Henry the eight wan Turwin and Turnay, entertained the Emperor Maximilian, welcommed Charles the fift, compounded at his pleasure with France, made voiage after voiage, conquered Bulloigne, had almost obtained the

                        Empire, was maiesticall in all things, and died as it were in the armes of kingly reputation.
                     
                        Queene Elizabeth deserues a whole story of her life, maiestie, and gouernment: For the very Heathen and Mahumetans, the Persians and Idolaters, the Aethiopians and Muscouite doe name her with reuerence.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. XXII. An other excellencie of ENGLAND casting vp an account of her antiquitie in one vnited Monarchy before other Nations.
                     
                        AS no country in Europe did euer aduance England the auntientest vnited kingdome of Europe. vp so many excellent parts together toward the building the frame of perfection: so is it apparant in nothing more liuely, than in Englands antiquitie in one vnited Monarchy, without either claime or competition of forreiners, vsurpation of intruders, attempt of hostile invaders, and desire of alteration amongst our selues: whereas yet all the Kingdomes of the world, especially within the reach of European knowledge, within 400 yeeres haue had other titles, bin subiect to strange disparitie of gouernment and religion, and confronted many times with such Princes, or fearefull subiects within their territories, as haue made them ielous of soueraigne points, yea the very losse of their cheefest

crownes and dignities. If you search the wounds of the Persian and Turkish gouernment, as they seeme now to be healed, you shall finde them badly cured, and indeed festred so dangerously, that they must bee better ouer-viewed, or their inward putrefaction will on a sudden poyson the very entrailes: For they haue bin tossed and tumbled with many alterations, and euer since Tamberlaine descended out of Scithia amongst them, suffred diuers concussions both in gouernment and religions, so that howeuer the Persian is more noble, yet he hath permitted a mixture of many barbarous people to the great disturbance of his former glory: As for the Turke hee is meerely new to vs, and a formidable intruder into such territories, as he gripeth with a strong arme; so that what you now behold amongst these Mahumetans is onely vpheld by tyrannie, a band of no greater strength, then power, forces, and reward can tye together, wherein if any faile the gouernment is quickly let loose, and the subiect at liberty taketh hold of euery innovation: and although by tumbling and tossing like to heaps of snow rowled vp and downe, they haue growne greater and greater, while the frosty coldnes of our Christian Princes gaue them leaue to harden, whereby they are increased to that stupendous heape you now see: yet when a thaw comes, and that rota fortunae is in Gyro, it shall and will be subiect to diminution, especially when the glorious sunne of successe shineth out the consent of our Kings to expulse them at least out of Europe, if not from the vsurpation of the better parts of Asia.
                     
                     The Kingdome of Hungary, though but lately established, and knowne by a different royalty from the Empires either of Greece, or Germany; yet as you see a prey seased

on by a hawke, or other tormenting vulture, pull'd in peeces, and cruelly rent a sunder: hath suffered many dilacerations, and besides the capitall enemy of Christendome her proppes sawed a sunder by some barbarous hands amongst themselues. The Kingdome of Poland is not 300. yeere old: For it retained in times past, but the prerogatiue of a Dukes coronet, and was euer in contention with Lithuania and the adioyning Princes, vntill the Pope vndertooke the appeasing of those troubles, and added the grace of a roiall inuesture to Sigismundus, surnamed the great, who at last vnited both Pomerania, Prussia, and Lithuania; yet is not so established, but the Election of the Peeres diminisheth the prerogatiue of the King, and new Princes; new lawes, new confederacy, new gouernment, haue let confusion, and alteration loose vpon the Countrey.
                     The Emperour, Princes, Electors, and principalities in Germany are almost of the same nature and condition, but that many liberties of Cities haue beene bought out with mony and diuers franchises purchased to redeeme themselues from the tyrannie of wanton lords: so that in particular many families haue beene chopped and changed, honourable houses transmuted, and new names and titles haue as it were thrust the old out of doores: and in generall, what with the French, Germanes, and the house of Austria, there hath not a thought passed for hereditary succession, but all things haue beene subiect to instabilitie, and are still hurried in the current of preuailing, as either the Pope, Electorum placitus, or militareius filling the sailes full of winde, giueth them leaue to driue the barke of the gouernment forward. The Princes of Italy in worse estate, then they. For except the Venetians,

some of their Dukedomes, as Ferrara and Vrbin are fallen to the Papacy: some of their Kingdomes, as Naples and Sicilia possessed by the Spaniard, with Millane and Genoa: and the rest suspitiously standing on a guard of circumspection, least they should betray one another to the stronger side: and whereas the Venetians doe boast of 700. yeares continuance, I am sure they neuer flourished, but by the dissentions of the rest, and in their first inchoation, these Ilands were but receptacles for banished men: yea compared to cauernus for simple beasts to shroude in, whom the others of prey and rapine did not looke after. For the Gothes and Lombards, that infested Italy, made no more account of them, then we did of the stragglers in the mountaines of Walles, or fastnesse in Ireland; but they haue beene better coadiuted, and taken successe by the hand to pace out the measures of prosperity, as you now see their glory, riches, and augmentation. The Kingdome of Spaine is so new, that the other day there was a King of Portugali, as absolute as himselfe; a King of Arragon of sufficiency to contest with Castile; a King of Granado &amp; Valencia within memory subiect to Paganisme, and maintaining the new sect of Mahomet; a King of Nauarre as fearefull to him, as the rest; and sundry other abridgments tending to the diminution of Maiesty: howeuer at this instant he is blowne bigge with the winde of superfluity and greatnesse. The Kingdome of France but a while ago compacted. For Burgundy challengeth a roialty, and had afterward a Duke maintaining his owne priuiledges. The Earle of Flanders writ Comes Deigratia: Normandy was another mans: Brittaine in a Dukes possession: Gascoine, Guien, and Acquitane our owne: Daulphin and Prouince incorporated by gift, and Rhene Duke of

                        Loraine inuested with the Toialties of Naples: and thus could I runne ouer all the rest, if either they were of eminence sutable to the glory of these recited, or consequence to store vs with obseruations and example: only England for aboue 600. yeares (I might recken from Edgar) but that you will answer some 400. yeeres since the Prince of WALLES was onely an Homager, and SCOTLAND in continuall opposition, had fedde vpon the plenty of a flourishing Monarchy, and beene fatted with the well fedde dainties of an exuberant Countrie, diplaying the colours of her owne roialty in such a glorious manner, that shee hath not onely spread her fame with an vncontroulable hand, but brought the glory of other Nations vnder the adumbration of her canopy: so that if I should adde her seuerall conquests of Ireland, Walles, Scotland, France, Cyprus, Ierusalem, and Castile it selfe, it would torment vs with remembrance of our losses, or augment our iealosie for hassarding our honour by negligence, and corrupted peace, which was once so worthily established by the proppes and supportation of merit, and vertue.
                  
                  
                     
                     
                        CHAP. XXIV. Another excellency of ENGLAND consisteth in the happy life of our Countrey-man and common people.
                     
                        IF you looke on our example you shall finde, that the chiefest part of The Husbandmen are happier in England then in other nations. 
                        Salomons glory extended it selfe from the abundance of his people, when euery man did eate vnder his owne Vine, or fig-tree, when Israell were many as the sand of the sea, making merry one with an other; when the Husbandman plowed in peace and reaped in content; and when the wrongs of the common sort were as well streightned by the line of Iustice, as the oppressions of the mighty reformed by the hand of authoritie. In which prerogatiues I dare be bold to say, that ENGLAND excells all other nations, as the light of the Sunne inferiour Planets: For in some places they are absolute slaues: in some places denied the comfort of their owne endeauours: in some places not capable of purchases: in some places not permitted to marry aboue their degree, and elsewhere not suffered to enioy the freedome of life, or benefit of nature: as for an instance. In Turkie hee is with the rest a most poore and vnfortunate slaue; for whether Mustleman or Christian, he dare not manure his ground to the best profit of his endeauours, liuing so poorely with such sluttish and drudging company, that I haue pittied his fortune, and commiserated his distresse. In Hungary and those parts they resemble carrion to bee

preied vpon by rauens, who not only feed themselues, till their gorges be full, but call for others to consume that which is left: thus liuing vnder the Turke he hath nothing of his owne, and in the Christian gouernment all is taken from him, either to furnish the warres, or maintaine the tribute. In Italy they are a little better, as long as they be able to pay their rents, and husband their grounds; yet doe they seldome liue of their owne, or execute any thing befitting the freedome of conuersation: Besides in many places they are so terrified with the troublesome incursions of the Banditi, who euen make a prey of their wealth and cattle, that although they know of their robberies and murthers, yet dare they neither detect them, nor deny to entertaine or releeue them. These be men proscribed Banditi. by the Law, and banished from their owne Inheritances for some hainous mulct or other, and flying into a stranger Princes iurisdiction liue by rapine and ouer-mastering of Passengers, as they doe in Arabia, and most parts of Turkie, remote from the great City, especially in Epyrus, where both Theeues and Rouers shelter themselues within the Mountaines Assassini, but seldome performe any robberie without murther: whereupon as we say figuratiuely, all inhumane and monstrous delinquents in this kinde are called assassini. But to our Italian Countrey-man againe: After the pride of Italy (especially the women) they will be a little gaudy in the same apparell their mothers bestow vpon them, or their amorosos send as a gratuity, and thus I confesse I haue seene an Inne-keepers daughter go to Church in a coloured damaske gowne with Spanish sleeues laide on with gold lace, and come home to dresse our dinners: the men are very industrious according to the goodnesse of ground, as hauing in one

selfe-same field (though it be but an acre of Land) both corne, vines, and fruite trees, and in his gardens about his house rootes, sallets, Bees, and silke-wormes, boasting how the Romans maintained their Colonies from the Countrey-man, and supported the Farmer as a nursing father for Souldiers: nay they can remember the Law Agraria, when the Gracchi lost their liues about an equall distribution of the Roman territories, and the maintaining the immunities of the free Italians: but they sigh to recount, how it was abrogated, and euer after they were suppressed in their insolencies, as kept from outward pompe, and pleasures of frequented cities.
                     He is now called Villano (from whose character we haue 
                           
                              〈◊〉
                           . a contemptible tenure of land in England called villenage) seruing to no other vse, but to enrich his Lord, feeding himselfe vpon garlike and onions, and is acquainted with no good thing but superstition, a few gawdy clothes, and the incontinent life of curtezans.
                     In Spaine it is farre worse, and the Contadini are numbred amongst the reproches of their gouernment, and almost Contadino. esteemed as the asses, which bring their cabages, melons, &amp; suchlike to the market. For he neither dare atempt to cheapen any thing appropriate to the vse of Gentle-men, as flesh, fish, wheat, and excellent fruit, nor must hee (though he haue of his owne) but furnish the market with the best, feeding himselfe with the worst and vildest stuffe. Besides, as the errour of Italy, or if you will horrible abuse, if the mother haue a comely daughter, shee is contented for money, with her prostitution, and many times is her Bawd, if she can happen of a good Chapman, nor desisteth she so, but in one house you shall sometimes haue the mother a drudge, &amp; 3. or 4. daughters mercenary strumpets.
                     
                        
All France ouer the pesant is not onely beastly within doores but churlish of condition, sauouring nothing but Pesant. his labour either in setting forward his husbandry, or dressing his vines: yet how? with base and seruile behauiour, with poore and miserable expences, with obscene and filthy lodging, with iealous and malicious welcome, with licentious and ill becomming liberty of speech against both Court and Common-wealth.
                     In Germany the Boore is somewhat better, for he eateth good meate sometimes, though vildly dressed, will bee Boore. drunke and merry, must be alwaies imployed, and alwaies a hungry or desirous of drinke, euen when he is able to drinke no more, and can apparell himselfe hansomely to go to Church either on sunday or holliday: but they are dangerous in their tumults, and rages, and not to bee trusted in their reconciliation after a wrong.
                     In Ireland he is called Churle, and if we nick-name him in England we terme him Clowne: He liues in great drudgery, Churle. not so much for his labour, as his watches. For hee is compelled to guard his poore Cattle, as well as he can, both from Theeues and wolues: insomuch, that although he haue but one poore Cabine his cow and hogge lies with him in the same. But if he boast of larger increases, he is then compelled to bring them all night into some bawne of a castle, or vnder the loop-holes of some raft, or fortification: For the Kerne watch all aduantages in times of peace, and thinke their thefts iustifiable in defiances of warre.
                     But looke vpon vs truely, as we liue indeede, and you shall finde our Yeoman of England a title of estimation Yeoman. in regard of his wealth, antiquitie, and maintenance of his familie in a continued discent: so that in times past hee

would not alter his title of rich Yeoman for any vaineglorious attribute of beggerly Gentlemen: you shall now see them dwell in braue houses, Mannors, Lordships, and Parkes to the annuall vallew of a thousand poundes, hauing sometimes their sonnes Knighted, their daughters well bestowed, their other children so disperced, that Lawyers, Citizens, and Marchants are raised through our Kingdome from sonnes, and kinred of Countreymen: nay, you shall behold them inuited to courtly promotion, and knowing that the breath of Kings aduanceth or deiecteth can attend the good houre, and begge all such graces, as a Princes fauour distributeth to the subiect: yet haue I read of a King in England, who importuned by a Yeoman to be made a Gentleman, answered, hee could enoble him with knighthood, or the title of a Baron; but not confirme him a Gentleman; because true gentry had another manner of lustre from the raies of vertue, and honour in a continuall discent of Auncestors, illuminated from the sunne of worthy actions, either in military profession, or administration of ciuill gouernment But thus liueth our Countreyman, by what name or title soeuer: onely we were wont to interpose this difference betweene Yeoman, &amp; Francklin or Farmer, that the Yeoman was a Trarcklin or Former. landed man, either Freeholder or coppieholder: the Farmer onely hired another mans land, paying a fine or rent, and so growing rich had the denomination of the other, and did not in times past murmure, though you called him Good-husband, or expert Plow-man: yet call him what

                        CHAP. XXV. Another excellencie of ENGLAND, consisteth in the goodnes of our Nauy and shipping.
                     
                        I Hope I shall now passe without contradiction, No nation euer came neere vs for so many and good ships. especially when I bring you forward to our ports, harbours, and riuers, shewing you the glory of our shipping, whether you esteeme them, as the Kings, and onely purposed for magnificence, state, and occasion of warre; or the Marchants for exploration of countries, plantation of Colonies, bringing in of commodities, enriching of our Kingdoms, and yet withall defending our selues: or both together for noble actions, memorable voyages, extraordinary encounters, and ceremonious brauery, wherein wee haue bin so priuiledged, that from the memorable fame of Edward the third, to this instant, we neuer met enemy, but preuailed vpon equall termes, yea great odds, and when we had misfortunes, it was as Sampsons death amongst the Philistims, who pulld downe the Temple on their heads, and slew more at that instant than in his former enterprises; witnes many nauall battailes, wherein what losse soeuer we susteined, the aduersarie had double and treble:

euen when about the fourth yeere of Hen: 8. the Nauies of England and France met at Britaines Bay, and we lost the Regent of England, wherein Sir Thomas Kneuet was Captaine with 700 men; yet did they endure the wreck of many ships, especially the French Carick, called then the wonder of Europe, in which Sir Piers Morgan with a 1100 men perished: as also when Sir Richard Greenueild within our memory miscaried by a meere disastrous chance, although I might honestly excuse it by ouer-great aduantage of both ships and gallies; yet as they themselues haue confessed, they had no great cause to boast, or let any vaine-glorious insulting runne at random. But how wee haue preuailed indeed, let these few instances suffice.
                     About the 14 of Edw: 3. the King gathered a Nauy of 200 saile against the French, who in those daies were coadiuted with Flanders, as a Peere of France, wherein though he was mightily ouer-matched with numbers, yet preuailed he in execution, and had so triumphant a victorie, that their owne account numbred 30000 men slaine, 200 ships surprized, and taken, and the rest put to an ignominious flight. The 20 yeere hee went into Normandy, dismantled her Townes, spoiled Cane, and as a messenger of reuenge brought fire into the Harbours vntill the ships were consumed and set on a blase. Anno 24 he encountred the power of Spaine, and vnplumed their fethers of ostentation by taking 28 great ships, and making the rest vnseruiceable. Anno 33 he sailed into Picardy, and so preuailed, that the sea yeelded him safe passage, and all Burgundy safe conduct. Anno 41 with a memorable victory both at sea and land did the blacke Prince resettle Peter of Spaine, and in despight of all the

sea forces, or other warlike opposition passed and repassed at pleasure. In the time of Rich: 2. about the 10 yeere the Duke of Lancaster sailed into Spaine, but how glorious that victory was on our side, and how surmounting our Nauie before theirs, the wonderfull successe attested, and their owne inventories record the losse with lamentable Items. The next yeere following Richard Earle of Arundell, and Thomas Earle of Notingham encountred at sea with an infinite number of Flemmings; but victory is in the hands of God, and multitudes of men faile in their ostentation: For in that maritime contention were taken a 100 ships and better, the successe filling our Cities with commodities, and our mouthes with praises and thanksgiuing. In the 5 of Henr: 4 when the French came to the Ile of Wight, and assailed Dartmouth with a great Nauy, the rusticall people preuailed against them, and manning out but the fisher-boats of the country, with certaine Pinaces attending the seruice, tooke 16 of their best ships, and compulsed the rest to be the messengers of their owne obloquy. The 3. of Hen: 5. was a yeere of triumph, and a 1000 saile of ships filled the narrow seas, cleared the passage into Normandy, amased all men, who had notice of our brauery, and reioyced the rest of Europe with Encomians of our successe, which followed presently in France. In the 15 of Edw: 4. it pleased the King to passe ouer to the aide of the Duke of Burgundy, but howeuer his inconstancie proued vnsauory to vs at land, it matters not: I am sure the seas gaue vs way, nor durst their Nauy presume to intercept vs. In the 5. of Hen: 8. the former encounter, which I named at Britaines bay was a day of terror, and we tooke, burnt, and spoiled as many, as we mustred out of harbour. The

next yeere threatning Turwin and Turnay our Nauy carying all afore it like a swelling riuer, beating downe the slender banks, there scarce appeared an opposite: for the former losses were so great, that they halted downe-right in their recouery, and France once lamed in her shipping, cannot euery yeere bring a new Nauy into the channell with good equipage, or aduantage. The 14 yeere the Earle of Surrey was Admirall, and not onely preuailed in all encounters at sea, but by vertue of our shipping conquered diuers townes both in Britaine and Picardy. The 15. the Duke of Suffolke was sent into France with an army of 30000, who passed the seas, yea the water of Some without battaile, and so terrified the French with all their coadiutors at that time (for you must vnderstand in those repining and murmuring daies against our glory, France, Spaine, the Low-Countries, and Scotland were either confederate, or entertained for wages: so that almost all the mercenary shipping of Europe attended on the payment of the crownes of the sunne) that they thought it the best part of their securitie to absent themselues. The yeere 35. Sir Iohn Dudley Vicount Lisle high Admirall of England, with a Nauy of 200 saile, passed the seas into Scotland, in despight of all the power the confederates could raise, and not onely performed actions beyond expectation, but taught them the true knowledge of English shipping and mariners. The next yeere the French Nauy came into Sussex; but vpon very short warning were dissipated, and in a sudden encounter felt the smart of presumption. Presently as in diuers aduantages of such petty roades and excursions; they landed at Portsmouth, and the Ile of Wight, but with what successe or satisfaction, I cannot compare it better than to a bowle of water

spilt, irrecouerably to be gathered vp againe: For they neuer durst aduenture, when our ships looked bigg vpon them, but vnderstanding of their imployment abroad, and sequestration farre off, then hurried they suddenly vpon vs; yet I hope neither found vs vnprouided, nor returned backe againe with true cause of insulting. In the 3. of Edw: 6. the French Kings gallies and Caricks invaded Gernsey and Iersey: but with what face fortune looked vpon them, the losse of a 1000 men, with the spoile of their greatest ships and gallies suddenly discouered. Why may I not name here our iourney to Newhauen in the 4. of Queene Elizabeth, when through the power of our Nauy, at which both French and Spaniards began to repine, the Earle of Warwicke made the seas wanton with iollity, and affrighted the land with those small troopes of old souldiers from the Garison at Barwick, vnited to others raised from the willing musters of our country: and although some enuious hand would stop the mouth of report from ecchoing our applause at this time, yet I am sure Count Ringraue and his armie felt the smart of affliction, and the sorrow of many defeatures, and dare auouch, that the seas lay open vnto vs in despight of opposition, or any encounter our enemies durst or could prepare to invite vs to. In the 18. yeere was Forbishers first voyage, and by reason that this glorious Queene had as it were tied the obseruation of all Nations to her actions and gouernment, a peace being generally contracted, diuers presumptuous persons tooke aduantage of the same, and filled the narrow seas with rouers and pirats, who ranne vp and downe without controll, like vntamed colts, scorning all enclosures and bounds', vntill Captaine Holstock with 4. good ships and two pinaces was appointed the reformer

of these abuses, who presently brought into the schoole of correction 200 rouers, 8 Flushingers, diuers Barks and Pinaces, and pacified the outragiousnes of these petty thefts. The 19. Forbishers second voyage. The 20. Forbishers third voyage, with many other of famous memory, amongst whom Hawkins, Drake, Candish, and such worthy sea-men (preuailing in all their explorations) as they attempted great matters, deserue as great commendation. About the 23. that famous busines of Desmonds rebellion breathed insolencie into those people, by reason the Pope and Spaniard had fortified themselues in Smirwick in Ireland, and with a sufficient number of ships blocked vp the hauen, vntill certaine of her Maiesties Nauie, and the Deputies forces at land (being then the forward Lord Grey) behaued themselues with such good order and successe, that all the passages of victory to vs, and miserable discomfiture to them were set open, and we triumphed with a plenary satisfaction to our endeuours. In the 24. Monsieur returned into the Low-countries to bee invested with the Duchy of Brabant: but when he beheld our glorious fleete, and iudiciously looked vpon their strength and brauery, he burst out into a passionate applause, and sware, that howeuer men were enemies to our peace, they were enemies to truth, if they did not acknowledge it without comparison. The yeere following Captaine Borough with one ship, and a small Barke went to sea against Rouers, and although the Councell at that time suspected vs ouer-weake to withstand an vnited desperatenes; yet the fight continued against 7 or 8, and all men can witnes our memorable successe in that encounter. The triumphs of 88 are of such renowne, and worthy celebration, that the world still remembers our illustrious

Nauy, and admirable victory: but this secret was not fully reuealed, that wee were not prouided, nor throughly furnished: so that as true hearts praied for vs, the great God of heauen fought for vs. The yeere following the Portingall voiage, and (as it were set on degrees) Cales voiage, the Iland voiage, Sir Richard Leusons noble exploits, and his place since supplied by Sir William Mounson, haue set forward our reputation to runne the race of vnresistable preuailing, and hold vp our glorious countenances in despight of any confronting looke, or repining eyes. Nor doe I heare reckon vp our Merchant Aduenturers, and the sundry times encountring with greater and more aduantagious forces: witnes the Marchant Royall in those times, when Iohn King was Master, which alone encountred with 3 ships, and 10 gallies, and came off with such iollity, as they fretted to be so disappointed, and we triumphed to welcome home so well deseruing a man. Since when, although those of Malta, Florence, the confederates of the Arches, and many desperate Pirats, haue conspired against our traphique, and made our iourney into the Leuant somewhat dangerous: yet we haue still gone forward, and could not bee pull'd backe by any wrenching arme whatsoeuer: especially in those daies of tryall, when we stood on our guard, and made our warlike preparation a very paire of tarriers to the Spaniard. For in those daies the Conuoy for his westerne treasure was so toilesome, troublesome, chargeable, and dangerous vnto him, that one million defraied but the charges of another, and by that time it came to distribution, there was a strange account cast vp of losses, and defatigable expences. Thus had our hopes still life, and our spirits grew stronger and stronger with honorable expectation,

                        CHAP. XXVI. An other excellencie of ENGLAND consisteth in the number, riches, endeuours, and extraordinary worth of our Marchant.
                     
                        IN the ouer-looking as it were the map of the worlds busines, I must needes The Marchant of England surpasseth all other Nations. confesse, that neuer Monarchy was established, or inlarged, but by the power of the sword: yet alas, when I consider the inconveniences impending, the affrightings of people, the demolition of Cities, the deuastation of Countries, the slaughters of Armies, the rapes, murthers, and terrors of the world in the best conquests and victorie; I cannot but lament the condition of man, that doth extract his glory from tyrannie and curses, from confusion and turmoyle, from blood and death. For thus doe wee boast of our auncestors, and the very women doe esteeme no man noble or worthy, that cannot relate the victories of his forefathers, and dare not himselfe set furie on worke to the killing of his enemie, nay to the murthering of his

Competitor, whether for loue, or displeasure. But if you will truly consider the admirable composition of Commonwealths, and extraordinary glorie of Kingdomes, it consisteth in sedation of troubles, and in the enriching of priuate men: yea euen Salomons greatnesse was raised to a stupendous mountaine of amasement, from the effects of a well compacted peace; in which his Temple was built, his Pallaces were finished, his Cities disposed of, his Souldiers maintained, and his glory spred abroad with sufficient fulnesse: For horses were brought him out of Arabia, fine linnen from Aegipt, perfumes and odours from Aethiopia, spices from India, precious stones from the Ilands, gold from Ophir, beasts and strange fowle from Affricke, and many other things both for exornation and pleasure from the remotest parts of the earth. But how? by the industry of Merchants, and worthy endeauours of men disposed to honour their Countrey, and aduance themselues: As for corruptions of life, couetousnesse, vaine-glory, ambition, pride, emulation, cunning, and infinite of this kinde, they are not to be named by way of Character, or personating any particular condition of man whatsoeuer. For from a Prince to a Peasant no body liues, but may be traduced in the selfe same kinde, that you would lay imputation on the shoulders of the Merchant: therefore I will absolutely conclude, that the true Merchant-aduenturer, as he is one way the supporter of politicall States by commerce, conuersation, and bringing in of wealth, so is he another way the Atlas of honour and magnificent maiesty by his customes, filling the store-houses of a Court, supplying the wants of a pallace, pleasing the desires of nouelty, cooling the heates of pride, and satiating the vanitie of wishes; nay if you would

and the Ilands, explored Virginia, Norrembega, Guiana, and other coasts, and made a trade with these Indians for diuers commodities; so that from one place or other of our Countrey, we haue not so few as a 1000. sailes of shippes abroad: nor so small a number as a 100000. persons disperced vnder this acceptable title of Marchant. For so I must tell you, that except you aduise with your selfe for this denomination in many places of the world the excuse of curiositie will not serue your turne: For you shall be taken for a Spie, and a dangerous Hypocrite, such is the iealousie of Kingdomes toward wanton Trauellers, and the necessitie of entertainment for well imploied men. And thus much for some speciall excellencies wherein England excelleth all other Nations.
                  
                  
                     
                        CHAP. XXVII. Another excellency of ENGLAND may be drawne from this obseruation, that we haue had more glorious persons, and famous Kings, and Princes to visit our Countrey, then any other Nation, &amp;c.
                     
                        AMongst other spreading boughes of prerogatiues drawing sappe from the tree of Englands glory, I may not leaue out this obseruation, that wee haue had since the Conquest more seuerall magnificent entertainments of forraine Princes, and voluntary progresses of famous Kings, and Emperors; some for pleasant iournies, others for necessary imploiment, then any

Nation of Europe: not that I meane to trouble you with vaine or tedious repetitions of Embassadors, Legats, Cardinalls, or other ordinary Liegers, as is customarie in all Princes Courts, and concurses of State; but meerely of extraordinary solemnities, and occasion of resplendant showes, triumphs, and festiuall inuitations to delight and contentment.
                     No sooner had the Normane setled his Conquests, and established his sonne William Rufus in the throne of greatnesse, as well appeared by his ambitious desires to fill all Europe with the report of his exaltation; especially after his returne out of Normandy, and that he found fault with the smalnesse of Westminster-hall, being yet the remarkeablest roome for State, greatnesse, and capacity in the world. But Malcolme King of Scots, and the two Princes of Wales came to doe homage vnto him about the third yeere of his raigne; yea Robert Duke of Normandy with many Princes of France acknowledged his eminent glory, and maiesticall Kingdome; although the said Robert was his elder Brother, and made way to his peace and amitie. This likewise continued toward Henry the first, and for addition, the Kings his adioyned neighbours assumed nothing to themselues, but what stood with the good liking of the King of ENGLAND, for which purpose they many times came in person to gratifie him: To which if you vnite the aduantagious marriage of Henry Emperour of Rome to his daughter, I hope it may passe for a reasonable beginning, and giue life to after hopes for the augmentation of our credits, and exaltation of our prerogatiues.
                     
                        Anno 1184. about the 31. of Henry 2. Heraclius Patriarch of Hierusalem came into our Countrey to desire aide against the Turke. 1201. and the 3. of King Iohn
                        
at a solemne entertainement in Lincolne, William King of Scots and diuers of his Nobles did homage vnto him in person, to which if you adde his marrying of Lady IANE his bastard daughter to Leuelin Prince of Wales, who was in those times a turbulent and ambitious man, you may easily iudge, what reputation our Countrey had got in the world, when the Pope was more affrighted at the starting aside of little ENGLAND, then if whole Spaine had at that time falne quite away, from his supportation, or if you will Antichristian vsurpation.
                     
                        Anno 1224. about the 8. yeere of the raigne of Henry 3. Iohn de Brennes King of Hierusalem came into England for aide and assistance against the Saracens, and from that vnimitable example of Richard 1. called in those times the flower of chiualry, that wunne Cyprus and Acon in person, well hoped to finde the other branches of that kingly off-spring full of the sappe of the same roialtie; but when I remember, how the chiefest Potentates of Europe came to elect Richard Earle of Cornwall his brother Emperour, and King of the Romans, I am more then satisfied for maintaining this vnanswerable position of our excellency in this kinde.
                     If you ouerlooke the life of Edward 1. you shall finde it a very mappe of honour, and be able to tell the world, that besides many forraine Potentates, the Prince of Wales and his brother Dauid reioiced in his acceptation of them; and Iohn Baliol King of Scots was glad to be named and established by him: But come a little forward, and at the naming of Edward the 3. me thinkes all English hearts should leape for ioy. For 1334. Edward Baliol King of Scots did him homage; the Prince of Wales was glad to A glory worthy all obseruation. kisse his hands; and the Electors of Germany 1348. inuited

him to the chaire of the Empire: nay such was our royaltie that Henry Pichard Vintner and Maior of London feasted EDW. of England; IOHN King of France; the King of Cyprus comming to see our worthinesse; DAVID King of Scots; EDW. Prince of Wales, Duke of Aquitane, Guien, and Cornwall, all in one day: Besides at diuers triumphes and Iusts these forraine Princes were led as it were by the hand of amasement to magnifie, and extoll the heroicke spirits of our nation. Againe in the 38. yeere of the King; the French King, the King of Cyprus, and the King of Scots, came all into England, and made pleasure proude, that it had good occasion to welcome them. Besides, 1367. Peter King of Spaine was disseised by his bastard brother Henry, but comming into England made such impression in the compassionate soule of EDW. the blacke Prince, that he assisted him in person, and reestablished him in his kingdome.
                     Shall I remember you of that glorious celebration of Himmeneus triumphs, when Duke Tussus and many Princes of Boheme and Hungary brought that magnificent Lady ANNE daughter to the King of Bohemia, and married her to King RICHARD the 2. of England, during whose life such was the royaltie of our Court and State, that in the 8. yeare the King of Armenia came into England for coadiutement against the Turkes. In the 12. yeare the Earle of Saint Paul and many Princes out of France and other Countries came to a Iusts in Smithfield, and made a iust estimation of our vnualuable glory. In the 16. yeare the greatest Lords of Scotland came to our triumphes in England, and checked their owne presumption for confronting vs with a supposition of equality. In the 20. yeare the Dukes of Burbon and Barre brought ouer Isabell
                        
of Fraunce to be a Queene in England, and glad was that Prince of Europe, that had beene an eye-witnesse of our glory: yea that magnificent workemanshippe concerning the exornation of the Hall of his Pallace, now Westminster (and by community and disparaged alteration vnregarded) was as it were a magnes to draw ouer the seas thousands of people, and hundreds of Princes, and Noble lords to looke vpon the wonder of the world.
                     In the 4. yeare of HENRY 4. King of England the Emperour of Constantinople came of purpose as the Queene of Sheba to Salomon, to set report on the touchstone of truth, and see whether custome had enlarged our fame or no, and here he was entertained with all the sumptuous and attractiue showes, and delights, that Arte and expences could deuise to satiate the minde of man: But when Dame IANE Dutches of Britaine came ouer to marry our King HENRY, I hope our enemies will imagine, her traine and Attendants to bee much augmented with the company of many forraine Princes and Potentates: And if you steppe forward to the 8. yeare of his raigne the Earle of Marre, and the great lords of Scotland came to solace themselues, and made their triumphes both at Tilt and Turney acceptable to the beholders. The like was performed the 10. yeare, when the Seneschall of Hennault with all those Princes reputed the Court of England a very Schoole of chiualry, and put in practise accordingly all the braueries of marshall discipline. But when the Lady LVCIA the Dukes sister of Millane came to marry EDMVND Earle of Kent, both citie and pallace was so furnished with strangers, and the concurses of people so well ordered, that inferiours were amased at so extraordinary attraction, and the better sort gaue a plaudite to our glory.
                     
                        
If you ouer-looke the time of Henr: 5. surnamed the Champion of Honor, though it was lamentable for the breuitie, yet was it vnmatchable for the royalty. For after his coronation he was scarse three yeeres in his own Kingdome, and yet in the third of his raigne he welcommed the Emperor of Almaine and King of Rome, and presently after graced the daughter of France and all her retinue, with many forreine Princes, who would not returne, till they saw their Lady Katherine Queene of England. To which if you adde the entertainment of the Duke of Holland, and many Princes of those countries, especially Freesland, you cannot chuse but make vp a plentifull breuiary of Heroicke Maiesty, and worthy princelines.
                     About the yeere of Grace 1502. and the 17. yeere of the raigne of Henry 7. the expectable Prince Arthur maried Katherin daughter to Ferdinando King of Spaine, and his eldest sister Margaret was affianced vnto Iames King of Scots, at whose inaugu

                        tion the concurse of strangers, and amongst them of the choisest Princes was so great, that all other adioyning Kings as much magnified our royalty, as feared our power, insomuch that the very report of our Kingdomes brauery draue Philip King of Castile, and his wife into England.
                     
                     About the end of August 1546. Flawd high Admirall of France was so royally entertained in England, that the King lying at Hampton-Court, the Prince of Wales met him comming to haue audience with a 1000 horse, whereof 500 were in one liuery, the coates of veluet halfe embrodered with gold, and one sleeue of cloth of gold: let other Princes acknowledge this magnificence. Holinshed saith 2000 horse.
                     
                        
In the beginning of Henry the 8. Lewis the 12. of France maried Mary the Kings yongest sister: and 1520 the great Emperor Charles the 5. came into England to visit his Aunt, and within two yeere after made a second returne to view London, and bee acquainted with our country, from whose example Christiern King of Denmarke, and his wife about the 15 yeere arriued in England, and was welcommed to the pleasures of our country, and variety of our pastimes. The Prince of Salerne, and diuers of Naples about the 30. &amp;c.
                     Shall I name you King Philips mariage with Queene Mary? I hope then I must trouble you with a tedious solemnitie, and tell you, that many strangers knew not the way home againe into their owne countries a long time; and if the peace of their soules as they vainely imagined, might haue bin added to the delight of their bodies, the happines of England had bin the subiect of their tongues, and the obiect of their eyes. In the second yeere of her raigne Ecmondine a Prince of Germany, and other Embassadors were sent from the Emperor. In the third yeere Emmanuel Prince of Piemont, with other Lords came into England, and the next moneth the Prince of Orange landed at London.
                     
                     But let mee passe forward to the mirror of all times Queene Elizabeth: how proud was the Prince of Sweden, that he was graced in England with so glorious entertainment at the beginning of her raigne. Not long after 1565 Christopher Prince and Marquesse of Baden came of purpose to haue his childe borne amongst vs, and reioyce in the fortune of such a godmother. About the 11. yeere of her raigne anno 1568 Mary Queene of Scots, though shee was surprized in her flight to France, and defeated

in her maine proiects; yet for a long time misliked not her imprisonment, and was glad to confesse the prerogatiues of her natiue soile and country. In the 14. yeere Francis Duke of Memorancy, and Betrawde de Saligniers Knights of the order of St 
                        Michael, came both into England, with other great Princes to gratulate her Maiestie, and acknowledge her worthines. In the 21. of her raigne 1578. Cassimirus Count Palatine, and Duke of Bauaria was entertained the better, because he came of purpose to admire her Maiestie, and commend her country. Not long after 1581. Francis Burbon Prince Daulphine of Auergne, Arthur Cass Marshall of France, with Lusignian and others came to make way to Monsieurs admission, who accordingly anno 24, as Duke of Aniou, the French Kings brother, and next heire to the flower-de-luce, was welcommed beyond expectation, and entertained with such sumptuous showes, and variety of delight, that they know not, how to put it ouer with true noblenes, considering the disparity betweene their customes and ours. About the yeere 1583. Albertus Alasco free Baron of Lasco Vaiuode, or Palatine of Siradia in Poland, was an eye witnes of our many prerogatiues, such as we may terme Court brauery, Cities excellency, countries happines, vniformitie of our Vniuersities, strength of our Nauies, and glorious contentation in all estates.
                     
                        Anno 1596. The Duke of Bolloigne came into England, and in 1600. extraordinary Embassadors from Barbary and Russia, who although from a stubborne bestialitie seemed to vilipend the managing of many affaires by outward forme; yet were driuen to applaude our generall happines, and confesse with admiration, that no Kingdome was so disposed for reciprocall duties betweene

Prince and subiect. Yea 1601. that vndaunted souldier Duke Birone, who seldome gased at any meteor, or setled planet out of his owne sphere, came ouer amongst vs with 300 attendants, and returned with this resolution, that the Queene and Court of England vnder such a Queene, was the true mirror of maiestie, and map of magnificence, had not some of them misliked the broken and vnsauoury structures of Whitehall, which indeede if it might hold vp a head of outward vniformitie and statelines, as it doth when it list of inward maiestie, and greatnes, I know not then who could compare with vs any way: except the gallery of Paris, being the worke of 60 yeeres expences, and pride of many seuerall Princes; and the Turkes Seralio in Constantinople, a vast aedifice for many purposes, and receptacle for 20000 people, which one way or other are lodged in and about it. For in truth within the walls and iron gates it containeth as much roome or more, than all S. Iames parke, and Whitehall together.
                     When our King Iames was established to the admiration of all the states of Europe; Monsieur Rosne from France; Don Iohn de Tassis from Spaine; and many other extraordinary Princes from all the Courts of Christendome, came ouer to gratifie his happines: but 1604 Don Iohn de Velasco, Constable of Castile was as an extraordinary Prince extraordinarily entertained: to which if you vnite the glorious welcome and admission of Prince Vlrick Duke of Holstaide: as also of George Lodwick Lantgraue of Lutenburgh sent from the Emperor Rodulph, you may well expose their entertainment against the greatest magnificence of other countries. Anno 1606 Don Iohn de Mendoza Marquisse of S. Germaine was sent ouer to his

Maiestie; and presently the King of Denmarke came to visit his sister. The next yeere 1607. Prince Ienuile second sonne to the Duke of Guise sported amongst vs, and much applauded our Court and customes. Then in 1608. followed the welcome of Christianus Prince of Henault; and presently after the admission of many great personages, besides the Leigers Embassadors of diuers Nations. To which if you vnite the second comming in of the King of Denmarke; the Duke of Bolloignes welcome, and many others about the seuerall treatises of our Princely mariages, with the Lady Elizabeths solemnities, when Prince Fredericke Count Palatine came in person to take her to his wife, I make no doubt concerning the purpose in hand, you will all confesse that England hath not bin a litle graced, and the rowle of our excellencies hath one Item beyond other countries for remarkable persons comming amongst vs either for pleasure, or state-imployment: which the rather hath place of wonder, because wee are seated in the sea, and so farre remote from the maine commerces of the world: so that whosoeuer comes to vs, must looke for no through-fare, nor Cities of strength, as in many places; but bee content to sit amongst vs with amasement, that euery man eats vnder his vine with plenty, peace, and such acates, as great Kingdomes want for all their treasure, and popish fasting daies.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. XXVIII. THE CONCLVSION.
                     
                        I Could further marke your tallies with many memorable priuacies, wherein we ouer-passe other Nations: but they be things so well knowne already to iudicious and vnderstanding men, that I must needes be ielous of my selfe for entring so slenderly armed into the lists of so great a contention, and against such aduersaries, who will either out of curtesie smile at my folly, or prouder experience deride my ignorance, or peremptory wilfulnes scorne my tenuity: but I will anticipate all censorious exceptions with a plaine confession of

                           Scribimus indocti, doctique poemata passim.
                        
Yet notwithstanding seeing I haue plaied the truant already, I will imitate the cunning and stubborne schooleboy, who perceiuing an impossibilitie to auoide the punishment for his offence, gaue a longer content to his pleasure, and taried out the last houre with supposition, that all could end but with one chiding: so considering I haue racked your patiences thus farre, I will questionles determine my first purpose after my owne fashion, and vndergoe your pitty, or vilipending for all together.
                     Know then, that our Vniuersities for state, maiestie, good order, number of schollers, and iudicious learning, surpasse all countries of Europe; and if in Cambridge
                        
you looke on Kings Colledge chappell, the sumptuous quadrant of Trinitie, and the delicate compacting of our new Colledges, you cannot but imagine, we had a hope in the structures to contriue some thing for admiration. If in Oxford you consider the Diuinitie schooles, the foundations of Christs Church, Sir Thomas Bodleis library, and other things of account, you must needs conclude, that we striued to exalt our Nation for such rarities. Our bathes, high waies, and securitie to trauell in are not to be ouer passed. Our Inns, or as they call them Hosteries, with other places of entertainment, yeeld a plenary satisfaction to our trauels, and open the embracings of extraordinary welcome, insomuch that our wearied bodies are folded in the armes of quietnes and rest, and our troubled spirits setled in reposednes and content. In our hospitalitie we goe beyond all other Nations, and many worthy mens houses exceede scattered villages both for diuers buildings, and numbers of people else where: Our diet is abundant, and the best of the cattle, and for the blessings of increase bids you welcome to the fat of the earth, Abrahams cake, Abrahams calfe, Esaus venison, Labans good cheere, the louing fathers fat kid, and all of that sort. Our seruants are hansome and honest in comparison of others: our ciuilitie and attendance extraordinary, nor is the Gentleman to be dallied with by inferior groomes, nor any man to be abused, if he stand on the true leggs of obseruation. Our lawes are seuere toward capitall crimes, and if offences bedurty vs, wee are not yet impudently to mount on a stage to be seene; nor be so ignorant, but we can hide our selues, till we be cleaner, or make a composition with mercy and pacification, if the busines bee not darkned indeede with loathsomnes: and euery thing

amongst vs with a fashionable hansomnesse ouerswaieth nicer exception.
                     Thus I hope you will first pardon me for vaine-glory or affectation, considering I speake for my country, and then yeeld vnto the truth, which at last must preuaile, considering I haue confirmed her excellencies and prerogatiues: Nor haue I taken this taske vpon me out of supposition, that England would haue lost her reputation, if I had not traduced my selfe in these triuiall Tractates: but meerely I protest to affront some humorists, who as irresolute or ignorant thinke too slightly of our worth, and in my owne hearing haue presumed to match petty Princes with vs, against whom I dare maintaine, that if there were such occasion, the Voluntaries and idle disposed of our Country would goe in such troopes, and in such a manner, that we need neither pay customes for silkes out of Florence, Genoa, Leuca, or some other of their principall states of Italy; nor haue our store-houses empty of the marchandice of India or China. As for the gold of Ophir, though many thinke, ancient mines may be exhausted: oh that they might try their fortune, I beleeue we should not need proclamations against exportation of our coine. But better is better: I haue commended the peace of Salomon, as one of the cheefest parts of blessednes, which the birth of our Sauiour ratified, and the comming in of our King exampled: and let it continue a Gods name with the spreading of the Cherbins ouer sanctum sanctorum, and the shadow of the Almighty couer vs, vntill we come to the port indeed of all comfort, happines, and securitie.
                  
                  FINIS.
