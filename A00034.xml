            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               A good wife by Susanna is descride,
               The greatest Blisse that can a man betide.

               Their Lusts, and plot their wishes to recouer.
            
            
               I Sing the honour of that noble Dame,
            Who for true vertues sake despised shame;
            And rather chose to die with infamy,
            Then violate her sacred Chastitie:
            For she him made her confidence and stay,
            That made her righteousnesse as cleare as day.
            
               Lucrece be mute; if chaste, why should thou die?
            If not, why should we praise thy chastitie?
            I sing of Iudges base, not more vniust
            In iudgement, than obscene in filthy lust;
            I sing of Iustice, Iudgement, Equitie,
            And knowledge of discerning Veritie.
            Oh blessed Spirit, who didst the spirit dispose
            Of youth, the Elders malice to disclose,
            Direct my Muse; Iniustice to discou

            And fingers touch of sweetest warbling string;
            
               Iehouah could not, for his Abrams sake,
            Forget the promise he to him did make:
            But gaue them fauour in the heathens sight,
            And dwellings both for profite and delight:

               Ioachim had a house most rich and faire,
            Most pleasant, fruitfull, healthfull eke for ayre:
            But was renowm'd and famous, most of all,
            For one faire, large and open goodly Hall,

            For Iustice; there the Elders kept their Court.

                  Exo. 18.21. Be men of courage, hating couetise;
            Fearing the Lord; in dealing iust, vpright;
            And able to discerne the wrong from right:
            But these were Ancients in iniquity,
            Malice, Iniustice and Adultery.
            
               Both like in Ignorance, and base condition:
            Both rais'd by bribing, fauour and ambition:
            Not vsing Law hard causes to decide,
            For they all matters by one ballance tride;
            Whose guift weighs heauiest, victory obtaines,
            This mickle profit brings with little paines:
            Deferring strifes finall determination,
            Not thereby to take better information,
            But for to groape whose purse did heauiest way,
            And vnto him they alwayes giue the day.
            These iudged then the congregation
            Of captiue Iewes that were in Babylon:
            
            And for Ioachim was a noble man,
            To him the people with the Elders came;
            Where they till noone the causes ouer call,
            As now our Iudges in Westminster hall.
            This noble man was not so honorable
            For ancestry, or ought that's heritable,
            As for his vertues, Iustice, Pietie,
            Humblenesse, Meekenesse and Integritie.
            These did his minde and actions more adorne,
            Than wealth, ambition, fauour, armes with scorne:
            These made him of the highest reputation,
            And sought vnto of all the Iewish nation;
            Who though he Patron was and Aduocate,
            
            And wondrous knowledge had, to rule the State,
            
            By his great skill in Lawes iudiciall,
            The Morall and the Ceremoniall;
            Yet seeing the corruptions of the Time,
            
            And Folly into Seate of Iustice clime:
            And that the most vniust and ignorant,
            By bribing, friends, or boldnesse, got the Grant
            Of highest Offices; Hee free from charge,
            Of publique Office, chose to liue at large:
            
               But for because, man borne he vnderstood,
            Not for himselfe, but for his countreys good,
            He tooke more paines, than any Magistrate,
            For wronged friends, and good of publike state.
            So that his was the House of Iustice hight,
            His mouth an Oracle of Law and Right;
            The widows, poores, and orphans sure defendour,
            Th' Innocents aid, and terrour of th' offendour.
            He ware a Lawyers Gowne to keepe him warme,
            But sould no Breath, to doe a poore man harme.
            
            He that describe all heauenly Graces can,
            May tell the vertues of this noble man;
            Which he not only learnd, by contemplation,
            But acted to the good of all his nation.
            
               
                  A good wife described. Prou. 31.10.11. &amp;c.But aboue wealth and all this man possest,
            He with a faithful, honest wife was blest,
            In whom her husbands heart might safely trust,
            In wealth or want contented, true and iust,
            Who did him good, not euill all her daies,
            Industrious with her mind and hands alwaies:
            Like merchants ship that foode from far doth bring,
            Early and late her houshould ordering:
            Her working hand still open for to feede,
            The hungry, and to giue to them that neede:
            And in the Sommer for the Winter tide,
            She cloathing for her houshould doth prouide.
            This made her husband so much set by, and
            To sit amongst the Rulers of the Land:
            Her mouth was shut, and couered her face,
            In one sate modesty, in th' other grace,
            In one did angelique sweet beautie shine,
            From th' other wisdome flowes, and grace diuine.
            To many daughters, Graces rare befall,
            But chaste Susannna went beyond them all.
            
               Amongst the fruits of her Industriousnesse,
            Who neuer eate her Bread in idlenesse,
            Shee plants an orchard fruitfull, rich and faire,
            Whither she with her Lord doth oft repaire,
            Themselues awhile from worldly cares to free,
            And on their handy workes Gods blessing see:
            There might they please, smell, touch, eate, taste and sight,
            With flowers, fruits, and musiques sweete delight;
            For through the same a pure streame murmured,
            To which the Birds sweete trebles warbeled,
            The winds amongst the trees a Base did sound,
            And flowers all enamelled the ground.
            But lo the winds, birds, streames and all were mute,
            At nimble touch of Susans trembling Lute,
            Brooke staid, Birds ceast, and Aire calme became,
            To heare the heau'nly musique of this Dame;
            But most it doth her husbands heart reioyce,
            To heare her Lute outwarbled by her voice:
            Which seem'd a quire of Angels, which did praise
            The King of heau'n in Dauids holy laies.
            So haue I often heard, in forrest faire,
            When Spring begins with calme and gentle aire,
            Groaues citizens, which thither doe resort,
            Oft sing by turnes, oft 
                  •
               oyne in one consort;
            Till Philomele to welcome Phoebes light,
            Hauing their musique heard with due delight:
            Sends from her brest such lute-like warbeling,
            The other Birds are all asham'd to sing;
            And listening, in one straine most sweete and cleare.
            Doe all their changes in one Dittic heare.
            And so haue I often seene the shepheard swaines,
            Wooing the shepheardesses on the plaines,
            Challenge their mates by single pipe and voice,
            And ioyne in consort with harmonious noise:
            
               That all the shepheards dance to heare them sing,
            And forrests all with ioy aloud doe ring,

            Yea Collin Clout doth breake his pipe for shame,
            To heare the heauenly ditties of his Dame.
            Thus oft she solaced for recreation,
            But most alone, for holy meditation,
            She in her orchyard walketh euery day,
            To reade the Scriptures meditate and pray,
            Where by sublime pure heauenly contemplation,

            To haue their will on her both were full faine,
            But saw no meanes their longings to obtaine.
            As Satan, when he would vs worke despite,
            Transformes him to an Angell of the Light,

            And when they chanc'd with Ioachim to dine,
            Their table-talke was of all things diuine:
            Of a sound conscience, and equity,

            Thus hoping, by their queint Hypocrisie,
            
            To make a way to foule Adultery.
            
            One day from Iudgement seate when both did rise,
            And either turned home as was their guise,
            Both streight returned, and together mette,
            With hope the sight of her alone to gett:
            Where either of the other doth enquire,

            Brother, said then, the Senior in degree,

            To doe obeisance to thy Seignury?
            Hast thou receiued wrong of any wight,
            And wouldst againe with sweete reuenge requite?
            Or tell mee, some faire Dame doest thou not loue?
            Whose Chastity thou art afraid to prooue:

            But, hauing finished her due devotion,
            Falls silent downe with swift and nimble motion,

            But after her devotions finished,
            And all her seruants duely ordered,
            Due portions to her maidens she divides
            And for her houshold daily food provides,
            Still caring for her husbands table most,
            To furnish't bounteously with smallest cost:
            Here she directs her steward, and her cooke,
            One to provide, the other well to looke,
            That with her faire allowance they be able,
            To furnish plenteously her husbands table.
            
               This time she soueraigne waters did distill,
            (For she in Physicke art had mickle skill;
            Yet was her charity, than cunning, more,

            Made her admir'd of all for surgery.)
            That done, she backe returneth to her maides,
            Where either she to them the Scripture reades,
            Or learnes them some choise precepts she collected,
            Or hystories which most her soule affected,
            With piety their minds to exercise
            Whilst each her taske with nimble ioints applies:
            Their chiefest workes were roabes; to keepe frō cold,
            The orphans poore, and widowes that were old;
            Of cloath which she had spun of her owne fleece;
            Yet oft to shew her skill in curious peece,
            She for her husband workes a cap or band,
            To make him be more honour'd in the land,
            Where thou might see, with cunning needle told,

            Here stands a tree, all couered with leaues,
            whose fairest fruit most lookers on deceiues;
            By this was shadow'd that Forbidden tree,
            That Adam ban'de and his posteritee.
            Many faire trees she planted there around,
            But none so goodly to the eye was found,
            Like sinne of pleasing shew, but deadly tast;
            Better, than eate such poison, euer fast.
            But not farre off, her cunning hand contriues
            An Antidote which out this poison driues:
            For here the child's depainted to the life,
            That trembleth vnder faithfull Abrams knife,
            Where lo! aboue his hand an Angell stayes,
            And doth his faith and firme obedience praise:
            
               Here in the bush a spotlesse lambe doth lye,
            Willing, to saue young Isaacks life, to dye;

            His life to saue vs all in Isaacks seede.
            Oft with her maids, about her round, she sings
            
               Dauids sweete layes vnto the King of Kings,
            Who ioyning all with angelique sweete noise,
            Doe praise the Highest of all as with one voice,
            Thus was her house of maidens arts the schoole,
            And Academy to instruct their soule:
            Her hands with vse so cunning were become,
            That though her eyes lookd off, her worke was done,
            The whilst with them her maidens she directs,
            And her owne businesse no whit neglects:
            Oft reads she them some holy Hymne of praise,
            Yet neuer from their worke her fingers stayes.
            Thus she her time in working spends till noone,
            Whilst Ioachim which rose from bed as soone,
            Doth his whole family together call,
            And ioynes in humble prayer with them all.

            Or widows weeding of his earing graine,
            Or maidens milke from bagges of kine to straine:
            Here he appoints a iolly Swaine to tend
            His flocke, and from the wolfe and flye defend:
            Oft would he teach a courser for to pace
            More easy, and to raine with pleasing grace.
            But euer he returneth home by eight,
            Where many longing Clyents for him waite,
            And him for pitty and compassion praid,
            To be the widowes and the orphans aide.
            Brethren, saith he, with all my skill and might
            I'le stand for you, if that your cause be right,
            
               But surely know, I cannot mooue my tongue
            To doe you good, and doe another wrong:
            Law is a constant will, a ballance true
            That giues to eu'ry man what is his due,
            And therefore must not vnder false pretence,
            Be made a cloake for wrong or violence:
            Or be for enuy, to the great a snare,
            Whilst faults for pitty in the Poore we spare:
            Right setteth each thing in the proper place,
            Without respect of persons, feare, or grace.
            Then would he lend to all a patient eare,
            Till each his cause in order doth declare:
            The right with all his might he would defend,
            And what was wrong would counsell soone to end:
            Nor for displeasure, feare of losse or might,
            Would be deterr'd from pleading for the right.
            Therefore was call'd the iust mans Advocate

            Her chin, her checkes, her forehead and her nose,
            Like lillies mixt with red and damaske rose.
            Her Iu'ry necke, faire shoulders which excell,
            Her paps that like two haruey apples swell:
            The which for sport her babes were wont to cull,

            Whose ends were with small fingers ioynted neate,
            And at their ends smooth stones of Berill set,
            The rest who knowes? them to omit I chuse,

            But she into the water leaping light,
            To coole her heate, inflameth their delight,
            Where purest waters her faire limbs embrace,
            As Iuory Sculpture in a cristall case.
            Like chastest Cinthia when with dreaded dart,
            She chast the Tigre, Leopard and Hart,
            Her body ouertoiled with the heate,
            And fairest skin or'e shadowed with sweate,
            In purest fountaine in the shade doth wash,
            Whilst all her darlings round about her pash:
            Till hunter, to his cost her beauty spyes
            Which heauenly did amaze his humane eyes:
            The sight whereof so rauisheth his brest,
            A reasonable man turnes senselesse beast,
            With snaggy hornes, cloue hoofes, &amp; frighted looks,
            That he who vpward erst, now downeward lookes;
            And all his Curs, that lately he so fed,
            Him chasing as their game fast followed:
            
               Whom pulling downe, like Iesabel they teare,
            Such beastly ends, all beastly Letchers feare;
            Such beastly ends these Elders eke befall,
            Whilst clouds of stones sing their curst funerall.
            As subtile Serpent close himselfe did hide
            In Eden, till a fit time he espide,
            When Adam to some other corner gone,

            So these two Elders of the Serpents breede,
            Who beare like enmity to all her seede,
            This naked Dame alone, watch to assaile,
            And first with promises seeke to preuaile:
            
               Madame, saith one, the ardour which we prooue
            Burning our hearts with flames of feruent loue,
            Compell vs life and honour to aduenture,
            And closely now into your garden enter:
            If you will vs in true affection meete,
            Siluer to you shall be like stones in streete,
            And we with gold will fill your fairest hands
            Like Danaes lap, or Tagus golden sands:
            Thy beauty like the Day starres shall be seene,
            And thou shalt raigne in Iudah like a Queene.
            But if thou shalt refuse with vs to lye,
            Behold, we then against thee testify,
            VVe saw thee with a youth thy bed defile,
            And thou hadst sent thy maides away the while.
            VVho can expresse Daphnes perplexitie,
            VVhen gods for pitty turn'd her to a tree,
            As she doth naked from Apollo flye,
            And than her honour lose, would rather dye?
            Or who can tell that pittifull sore-taking
            Of Absolons faire sister, when she baking
            Cakes for her brother Amnon for to eate,2. Sam. 13.11.
            
            Perceiu'd her honour was his longd-for meate?
            
               And cride, forbeare, oh brother, to discouer
            Thy sisters nakednesse; nay rather couer
            My shame than force me: oh! let no man tell
            Such wickednesse was done in Israel;
            And I eu'n whither shall I goe for shame?
            And for a foole all Israel shall thee blame:
            May tell how Helchi's daughter was ashamd;
            But most the Elders for their lust she blam'd,
            That they which ought to iudge adultery,
            Should authours be of such iniquity;
            That those her Lord and she so honoured,
            Should plot with shame now to defile his bed.
            Her nakednesse with cloathes she faine would hide,
            But they all couering to her denide:
            Her couering was sorrow, griefe and shame,
            And floods of teares for to expresse the same.
            As when fierce thunder threats to rend the skies,
            Great floods by stormes most violent arise,
            That riuers all their channells ouerflow,
            And drowne the seede which husbandmen do sow,
            So fill her teares the lauer to the brim,
            That drown'd in sorrow, she in teares may swim:
            Her drops of sweate like pearles do trickle downe,
            And she is all benumbd as in a swoune:
            
               Sol, erst that shin'd, asham'd, now in a cloud
            Himselfe, from seeing this foule sinne, doth shrowd:
            Showres fall from heau'n, as if the stars did mourne,
            And all the birds their songs to murmurs turne:
            The trees small drops like teares about do das
                  •
               ,
            And all the vnder shrubs with weeping wash;
            The shrubs, the hearbs, and all make lamentation,
            To see this Dame so neere her desolation:
            And eu'n my Muse, as I this story write,
            Laments and mournes to see her piteous plight.
            
               At last 
                  •
               ore grieu'd that humane eye beholds
            Her naked body, she her mind vnfolds.
            My Lords for loue of God, this sinne forbeare,
            If not for loue nor honour, yet for feare,
            When you condemne another for this crime,
            You iudge your selues! Tis now a fitter time,
            To fast and pray in our captiuity,
            Than thus to double our iniquity.
            If I like Eue consent vnto your mind,
            I sure with her a like reward shall find▪
            
            And if I doe your wickednes withstand,
            Yet know I not how to escape your hand:
            But I all mortall deaths will rather dy,
            Than in Gods sight commit adultery:
            Who doth with lust her laser lims enroule,
            Defiles her body, and doth damme her soule:
            Haue I not promis'd before God and you,
            To be vnto my husband iust and true?
            And must not all by lawes iudiciall dye?
            Without exception for adultery?
            Oh Iudges graue: but bridle yet your lust,
            And once a womans Secrecy entrust,
            That neuer will bewray this offerd shame,
            For honour of our nation and your name.
            But howsoeuer you my flesh torment,
            My heart to wickednesse shall not consent,
            A guilty conscience is a soarer wound,
            Than tortures all that Tyrants out haue found.
            Dame; said the Iudge; art thou yet so vnwise,
            Thou knowst not Polititians did deuise
            Religion, onely to represse the base,
            And hold the Noble in the peoples grace?
            Dost feare God should vs in this action see?
            This Lawyers gowne shall couer thee and me;
            
               Vnder which oft to Heau'n hath past vnseene,

            And from all fleshly eyes close couered;
            The Troth which to your husband you did plight,
            Was but for ceremony in our Sight.
            
            And as for our iudiciall Laws offence,
            Iudges haue power therewith to dispence:
            Your selfe and honour vnto vs entrust,
            And you shall find vs faithfull, true, and iust▪
            
            Great is the honour of an Elders name,
            Then who shall dare or thee or vs defame?
            And for your conscience now so foolish tender,
            
               Custome like ours, will strong and valiant render:
            Weele not torment your flesh, but it delight,

            Then, like fowle Beare, that greedy of his pray,
            His filthy Paw on milke-white Lamb doth lay,
            So he by force would bring her to his Lust.
            
            But she that in th' Almightie put her trust,
            
               Needes no Stilletto, now for to defend
            Her honour, but loud cries to heau'n doth send;

            And send their Serieants out to summon all
            The people to assemble at the Hall.

            Who was old Helchi's ancient friend and peare,
            And from their cradles most familiar were,
            And often had the Elders office borne,
            Till Pride and base Ambition with scorne,
            Had throwne from Seate of Iustice, Equitie,

            Being now summond to appeare that day,
            Enquir'd of Tobith then vpon the way,
            What cause was of this Summons generall,
            Who told him what to Susan had befall.

            To teach her all demeanour mannerly,
            But aboue all, the dread of the most High:
            In Scripture they her daily taught to reade,
            So that in time they sow'd in her such seede,
            As might produce in Haruest certaine gaine,
            For all their tillage, labour, cost, and paine.
            Scarse had the Sunne twelue times through Virgo past,
            When faire Susannas manners sweete, were cast,
            By care of Parents, in so faire a mould,

            In publique Dancing she doth not delight,
            Faires, banquets, plays, or sittings vp at night,
            Nor yet in wandring Dinas conuersation,
            But keepes at home her fathers habitation:
            Imploying all her paines and carefull thought,
            To please and tend on them that vp her brought.
            Like, Storke who when her parents old haue neede,

            At vacant houres it was her chiefe delight,
            To reade the stories of Gods glorious might,
            
               Where all the choisest precepts she could find,

            For her but yesterday your Liues you venterd,
            And into her Lords orchyard closely enterd,
            But now I see the flame which you then burn'd,
            Is all to Malice, Hate, and Fury turn'd.
            In briefe the Clerke doth her Inditement reade,
            To which she truely doth non-guiltie pleade,
            Yet so the Law is, that vpon Deniall,
            
            Her Life must stand vpon the peoples triall.
            Poore wretch (saith then the eldest Iudge) confesse,
            And aske God pardon for thy wickednesse:
            The Euidence, alasse! too plaine will be,
            The witnesses thee in the act did see.
            "But who feares not to act Adulterie,

               Thou thought'st this thing in secret to haue done,
            But God shall make it clearer then the Sunne.
            
            Then on her guiltlesse head both lay their hands,
            Whil'st shee like Iepthes virgine-daughter stands,
            Looking to Heau'n, expecting when priests knife,
            Should for burnt-offering dispatch her life.
            And thus they sweare; A

                last daies afternoone,
            We two in shady arbour sate alone,
            In at the foregate to the orchard came,
            With maidens two attending her, this Dame,
            Whom at the back-gate soone away shee sends,
            Whil'st some Deuotions priuate she pretends;
            But in close shade we suddainly espie,
            A yong man waiting with this Dame to lye;
            And much asham'd of such most wicked fact,
            Arise and take them in the very act.
            The man escapes, because he was too strong,
            For we alas are old, and he was yong:
            Out of the gate he breakes from vs away,
            But what hee was this Dame will not bewray:
            This truth 'fore God and man we testifie,
            Now heare the Law against adultery.
            
            The Clerke then reades: The man that's lying found,
            With any woman-kinde in wedlocke bound,
            
               
                  Deut. 22.22.They both shall die, as both together lay,
            So sinne from Israel is done away.
            Then as the chimes the clocke doe follow soone,
            As it hath told her longest tale at noone,
            Not caring whether it goe false or true,
            So doe the idle-giddy headed crew,
            At hearing of the Iudges witnesse, cry,
            We finde her guiltie, guiltie let her die.
            Oh Heau'ns! chaste Susan die? Thou maist cōplaine,
            That thou thine heart hast clensed then in vaine,
            
               In vaine hast wash'd thine hands in innocence,
            And day and night endured chastisements:
            But vnderstanding well the fearefull end
            Of those that so malitiously intend,
            How they consume and perish suddainly,
            Shee onely thus aloud to God doth cry.
            
               Searcher of Secrets: who from euer was,
            And all things knowst before they come to passe,
            Thou knowst they falsely these things testifie,
            Against mee: therefore, Lo I guiltlesse die.
            Thou knowst I neuer to such things consented,
            As these men haue maliciously inuented.
            As Bullet then which force of Powder sends,
            Swiftly attaines the marke which it intends:
            Eu'n so these words sent from a wounded Sprite,
            Fly to the Lord that iudgeth all things right.
            Who vnderstanding well by this appeale,
            Guiltlesse Susann's wrong, forthwith doth seale,
            Without delay, or fee, an Inhibition,
            
            And to a yong man grants a new commission.
            For God (as was seene often in those daies)
            The Spirit of yong Daniel doth raise,
            Who as shee's led to execution, cries,

               Against thy selfe; the Angell of the Lord,
               Stands ready to divide thee with a sword,
               Against thine owne life thou hast testifide;
               Bring forth the other, put this wretch aside.

               And seekes to scape by nice equivocation,

               Or that his brother might the truth confesse,

               No whit to alter his first accusation,
               And therefore with a feigned innocence,
               He boldly speakes thus in his owne defence.
               
                  Brethren, since you to me this office gaue,

               Good Ioachims, who were she chaste as faire,
               They were a holy, noble, pearelesse paire.
               But that whereof we now accuse this Dame,
               I sweare is true; who dares deny the same?
               Then Daniel said, Oh thou of Canaans seede,
               And not of Iudas, Beauty hath indeede
               Deceiued thee, and lust doth eu'n thy heart

               Thus you with Israels daughters dealt before,
               And they for feare haue plaid with you the whore;

               Then tell me truely, vnderneath what tree

               Had she in orchyard to your lust consented,
               This crime against her had not beene inuented.

               In cause pretended of Adultery,

               And witnesses in diffrent tales so found,
               That thereby one the other doth confound,
               First doe absolue from guilt this chastest Dame,
               Restoring her to her good name and fame.

               Which wickedly he to his brother ment;
               Do to him as he would haue done, I say,
               So ill from Israel is done away.
               And so shall other heare of it and feare,
               And henceforth no false testimony beare,
               Let not your eyes of them take least compassion,
               Respect not greatnesse, person, age or nation:
               A hand for hand, for tooth tooth, eye for eye,
               A foote for foote, for murther let them dye.

               He for the safety of our King doth pray,

               With ioyfull hearts, vnto his execution,
               Where he receiueth iustest retribution:

               Vpon them the whole multitude doth run,
               And did to them eu'n as they would haue done,
               To chastest Dame; so sinne was done away,
               And her blood innocent was sau'd that day.

                  Susanna chaste to iustice I compare,

               Who seeke for pleasure, fauour, gaine, ambition,
               Her to corrupt, but to their owne perdition.
               Iudges corrupt, when you this story heare,
               At Gods iust vengeance tremble, quake and feare;
               And iudging others for the like offence,
               Condemne your owne soule, guilty conscience.
               
                  And thinke not when you finde your selues vniust,
               Such punishment is onely due for lust.
               Who for ambition, fauour, feare or gaine,
               Doe iudge vniustly, merit equall paine.
               You that proiect to prooue by witnesses,
               Things false, for gaine, or for malciousnesse;
               Lo here your Fate in this example see,
               Your testimonies neuer shall agree.
               Old letchers that in beastly lust delight,
               See here your deeds of darknesse brought to light;
               Who doth from heauen your secret sins behold,
               Will one day to your shame, them all vnfold.
               Iudges and people diligently try
               The truth, before you one condemne to dye;
               For some for malice, some will sweare for gaine,
               Of enuy and ambition some will straine.
               When as you see th'accusers violent,
               And offer oath to prooue their owne intent,
               Though it may seeme them little to concerne,

               Whilst Susan-like your innocence shall shine,
               And be commended to succeeding time.
               Henceforth let all the Ladies that liue chast,
               Be with the title of Susannas grac't:

               And all chaste Dames shall glory in the same.
               And when as witnesses doe disagree,
               Iudges shall praise her honourd chastity:
               And Daniels prudent diligence admire,
               And by this patterne, out the truth enquire▪

               That guiltlesse blood, the blood of innocence.
               In thee two wicked Iudges I doe see,
               The diuell and the world accusing me,
               Whose malice surely had me ouercome,
               Had not the Prophet to my rescue come.
               I see in Daniel, sitting on the throne,
               A true resemblance of that holy One,
               Who though he all things past as present knows,
               By Spirit which the truth to Daniel shows,
               Yet by discussing will make all things cleare,
               That men and Angels which his Dome do heare,
               May second it with finall approbation,
               The Iusts reward, the wickeds condemnation.
               Go on, braue Daniel, in doing right,
               And thou shalt fauour find in Princes sight,
