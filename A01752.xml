            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            To the Reader.
            DEarely beloued (bought wyth the ſame bloude, and therfore parte takers of the ſame kyngedome) becauſe the Lorde oure God is the God of knowledge, and wyll haue ſuche ſeruauntes as by knowledge in trueth wythout fleſhely fantaſies, either of fained goddes or any fonde worſhip of mans madde brayne (who alwaies from the beginneinge hath renne after vanities) wyll be radie to geue anſwere of their faieth in him, the God of lyfe and of the hope conceiued by his onely worde: it becometh all his 
                  •
               o labour for knowledge, that they maye walke vpright in the waie of their Lorde, and by no halting ignoraunce to ſlide furth of the ſame and ſo to prouoke his worthi diſpleaſure. And as he is the God of loue, peace, vnitie and concorde, and will haue vs al tied together with the bonde of loue and made therby (in hym) all one bodie: ſo doeth it become vs wyth open hertes, wythout all doubleneſſe, one to enſtructe an other, to the edifiynge of oure brethern, that in ſure grownded fayth we maye loue together and ſo enioye the hope of our vocacion. Therfore, though mi talent bee verie ſmal and no principall gifte either of eloquence or learninge, but onely a loue of the trueth geuen vnto me, yet ſeinge the

worlde is ſo blinded with Idolatrie, and ſo beewitched with popiſhe ſophiſtrie, and euen nowe the ſpirittes and powers of darcknes worcke the chiefe myſterie of iniquitie and wickedneſſe, to ſet vp and maintaine the moſte weake Idole that euer was in the worlde, in the ſteade of the moſt mightie and euerliuinge God: I coulde thincke it no leſſe thē my moſt bounden dutie, openly to beare wittneſſe vnto the truthe. And where as the wordes of truth, haue bene ſlandrouſly and ſpitfully named the ſaieinges of the deuil by the ſpiritual crafte of a ſouldiour of Sathā, which by painted wordes woulde tranſform him ſelf into an angel of lyght. Whoſe boke is ſpred euerie where, and receiued in manie places more reuerentlie then the bleſſed bible, the holie worde of God. Yet no mā hath (ſo farre as I know) once opened his mouth or taken penne in hand, to make anſwere to this blaſphemouſe meſſenger of the proude Senacherib neglectinge the liueinge God, for the littel I dole that he maketh God or no God at hys pleaſure, who ſuffreth Miſe to eate him and the wicked to deuoure him. Lette all other men do as they ſhall thyncke good, wyth ſilence to let ſuche thynges ſlip. Truly if I coulde ſaye nothinge thereunto but onely naye, denienge Idolatrie and renouncynge

all ſuperſticion therin maintained: I iudge it my parte to publiſhe my faith, rather then by my ſilence to ſeame to conſent to ſuche diuilliſhe doctrine. So alſo do I eſteme it the dutie of the faithful in this perillous tyme, plainely to profeſſe the Lord the liueuinge God, to be the onely God in heauen a boue and in the erth beneth: leſte bi our ſilence for ſakinge hys cauſe here vpon erth, we be forſaken in his heauenly palace. For lyke as in herte we do beleue to oure rightuouſnes: ſo muſt we neceſſarily confeſſe to oure ſaluacion, as Paule teachethe. ii. Corh. xi.
            
            We muſt beware (as Paule warnethe, and the biſhope taketh the ſame text) firſt ofal, that our ſenſes be not corrupted from the ſimplicite and ſing leneſſe that is in Chriſte, as the ſerpent begiled Eua. We knowe but one God. We are maried vnto one. We knowe but one Chriſt made man and none other creature for ourcauſe. This thing as we beleue it in herte: ſo muſte we in mouth

                  •
               
               feſſe the ſame, if we wyll walke in the ſimplicitie and ſing lineſſe that is in Chriſte, as becometh chriſtians. For if the hert and mouth go together, then is it ſing leneſſe, otherwiſe it is doubleneſſe and diſſembling. But there is one other ſimplicitie (as it hath bene compted, &amp; as the worde hath bene abuſed) which

is verie foliſhnes. This maye we cal the ſimplicitie, that Antichriſte woulde haue ſtyl to reigne amonge vs, and therefore his champion, when he brought in the texte of Paulle: lefte out the principall wordes (Que eſt in chriſto) Whyche is in Chriſte, as their olde texte hath it. And thorowe out hys whole boke, he woulde driue vs to be ſimple. That is to ſaye, to folowe as we be led like blinde men: that the proude papiſticall prelates, ſtill leadeinge vs into the pitte of perdicion, abuſeing our wines and goodes, maye ſaye in their connentes. Let them alone, let them offer ſtill vnto Imeages, a pice of bread or any thinge elſe of a good intent, all is well done that is done of a good intent,
            They maye worſhip a ſtocke or a ſtone, let them folow their auncient fathers. They are good ſimple ſoules. They do as we and oure doctours teach thē. If we let thē knowe al trueth: they wilbe as wiſe as we, and then they wyll ſmally regarde vs. Thys is their workeinge, theſe are their wordes, howe ſo euer they haue clok
                  •
               d hertofore, all the worde nowe ſeeth it. Let vs beware therfore, of this thir ſimplicitie, and let vs no longer thynke that this their doctrine is'true, that al ſhould he well done that is done for a good intent, and that it is well done in all thinges to beleue

theyr doctours. For this ignorante opinion that thei haue grounded in their hertes hath hitherto ſtopped the waie to all knowledge, and nowe letteth faith to be grounded and cauſeth men to continew ſtyll in their olde errowres, wythout any deſire to come out of blindneſſe. Conſider therefore (good reader) a gaynſte their blinde leſſons: that Saull was caſte from hys kyngedome, for his good intent, euen becauſe he intended to do ſacrifice vnto the Lorde, of the beſt and fatteſte of the Amalechites. And yet maye thys ſeme a gloriouſe intent.
            The biſhoppes of the Iewes and the Idolatours of al ages folowed theyr good intent: euen when they put Chriſt and all hys prophetes and Apoſtles to death. The byſhop of Norwich when he burned pore Bilney, folowed his good intent our other byſhopes alſo, burneninge and murtheringe theyr bretherne in priſone and out of priſone: folowed theyr good in tentes, But God is the iudge of the intētes and thoughtes of vs al, and ſercheth the verie raine and the holes of our hertes. Yea the lord our god abhorreth and the prophetes reproue vs alwayes: becauſe we wyll do euerie man that ſemeth good in his owne eies
            Sayth not the Lorde by hys prophet Eſaye.

Myne intentes are not your in entēs, and mi wayes are not your wayes. But 
                  •
               o, ſo farre as the heauen is from the erthe, ſo high are my wayes aboue your waies, and mine intentes aboue your intentes. For the beliefe of their doctours and the prelates of the churche (which thinge the biſhoppe laboureth alwaies to eſtabliſh) remembre that Chriſte ſaith, if the blynde leade the blynde: boeth fal into the pitte. And thou muſt doub tleſſe cōmpt their writtinges euē verie blindnes, in regarde

                of the light of goddes moſte certaine worde which muſt be the rule of thi life, the foūdacion of thy fayth, and the light vnto thy feete. As for theyr auncientie: be ſure to take Chriſt for they guide, who was before all. And ſaye with S. Paule, fayth is of heariuge, not of the worde of any mā: but of the worde of God.
            Therefore ſaieth God the father with open voice from heauen. This is my dearely beloued ſonne in whom is my delight, heare you hym.
            Now if any be ſo fainte herted and ſo deluded by other, that they thyncke they maye ſtill diſſeinble wyth the hypocrites in their owtwarde doetnges: I ſende them to the exemple of Daniel, who praied with opē windowes, and (wyth his three companions) refuſed

to honour the golden Image, &amp; would not diſſemble outwarde worſhip, nother content them ſelues with the pureneſſe of theyr owne hertes (thoughe they myght therby haue eſcaped the fire) conſideringe that the glorie of God coulde not be ſo fo

               dered, but rather hindered by theyr walkeinge in the waye of the wicked. Therfore ſaieth the prophet Dauid. Happie is he that nether ſtādeth ſitteth nor walketh (that is to ſaye) hath nothinge Pſal

                  . to do wyth them, other openly or priuily, by any colour or diſſimulacion.
            Eliazar had ſuch like counſell of hys frendes, that he ſhoulde eate fleſhe onely whiche ii. Mach. vii. was lawfull, and diſſemble to eate the vnlawfull. But he ſaide it was not lawfull for him to diſſemble, and ſo cauſe many to be deceiued through his hipocriſie: for ſo he might eſcape the death of the body, but the hand of God he could not auoide. For this cauſe did Paule reproue Peter for his diſſemblinge be fore the gentiles. And he teacheth the Corinthians Galat. ii. againe, that there is no companie of light and darckeneſſe, no deſſemblinge to be partaker boeth of the cup of Chriſte and of deuilles.
            Oure membres muſt be the weapons either of rightuouſenes, other elſe of vnrighttuouſeneſſe, there is no meane for ſtyll and

ware politicke perſons. And therfore ſayeth our maiſter Chriſt, he that is not with me is againſte me. And he that doeth not gather, doeth ſcatter. Theſe wordes of Chriſte and ſuche like, and none other cauſe (whatſoeuer any man ſhall imagine) haue compelled me to publiſh my fayth, and in the name of the liueinge God, to make anſwere to one boke, whiche of all other I eſtemed moſt perilouſe and poyſonful, boeth for the authorite of the writter, and the ſubtile handellinge of hys mattier in the maytaineinge of that Idole, which al the worlde hath worſhipped ſo many yeres. The name of the boke is the detection of the diuillyſh ſophiſtrie. The authour that made it is Stephaue Gardiner, biſhop of Wincheſter, the chiefe mantainer of the popeiſhe tradicions, as appeareth by al hys dedes &amp; writinges. How I haue vſed my ſelf in the ſame: I ſhall ſhewe at fewe wordes.
            Becauſe I did take vpon hande to confute his boke: I coulde kepe no comely order but as the wordes do leade me, ſo am I compelled to go forwarde. Yet haue I not written hys whole texte in my boke (becauſe it woulde▪ haue ben to much tediouſe and ouer longe but onely his▪ chiefe, mattier and principall argumentes, whereof I truſte not one hath eſcaped vntouched.

For it was plentuouſely imprinted by Iohn Herforde in aldergate ſtrete at Lōdon, and is to be ſolde at the ſigne of the bell in poules church yarde. I haue principally and chiefe laboured to eſtabliſhe the true fayeth in the liueinge God: by the reproueinge of the falſe and fained goodes. Secōdly, I haue taught the trwe vnderſtandinge of the wordes of the ſupper of the Lorde, and the right vſe of the ſame. Whiche two my chiefe purpoſes howe faithfully I haue done them: the fathfull ſhall iudge, knowynge the voice of of theyr ſhepeherde.

No, I do ſuppoſe, the hight lerned maye finde many fautes there'with, as I▪ acknowledge mi ſelf far vnder the perfection of theyr high lerninge. Neuertheleſſe, I truſt in God that it is not all together ſo rude nor vnfruitfull: but that the vnlerned (for whome it is chiefe lie written) ſhall encreaſe bi it in knowledge, caſte of much ſuperſticion, and take conforte of conſcience. Whome alſo I beſeche, euen for the loue▪ of God, and▪ as they tender their ſoules health: not to caſte awaye this bokethough they reade ſomethinge therin that they neuer harde before, but rather deſire of theire moſte mercifull father, that theyr olde errours wherwith they haue bene deceiued by blind teachers, maie be taken awaye.

            GRace and peace from the Lorde the liueinge God, who hath all our hertes in hys hande to moue and ſtere to what ſhall lyke hym beſte, who onely knoweth the hertes of men, and therefore oneli is the iudge of the thoughtes and intentes of vs all, what or whan ſo euer we ſpeake or thinke. whoſe daye and iudgment is without regarde what man (which is but fleſh and bloud, and therefore ful of erroure and blindneſſe) ſhall diſpute, and determine and iudge. I paciently loke for and a bide whan as all darnell, drake and weede ſhall be caſte into the hell fire and all the good graine ſhal be gathered into God his owne garner, vnto whome we lyue all the tyme that we walke vpon the earth. And whē we die yet are we ſure that we are his owne, by the raunſome that his dearely beloued ſone Chriſt (our Lord and heade) hath paied geueinge the holy goſt into our hertes as a moſt ſuer wittneſſe of the ſame, teacheinge vs to crie. Aba father, whereby we knowe that though we die, yet we die vnto hym to lyue euer after cowpled and ioyned in one kinde and nature vnto our heade Chriſte, who as he is fully God, and of equale powre wyth his father, ſo ſhal he make vs like vnto hym when he ſhal appeare (after our porcion and

            They worſhipe me in vaine, teacheinge the doctrine and preceptes of men &amp;c. And where he bringeth in this texte in the ende of his boke, nothing ſo ful as our ſauior Chriſt did ſpeake it (as he knoweth well inowgh if he haue ſo muche Greke as he braggeth abrode) he addeth therunto his owne gloſe, as though he coulde vtter the wordes of chriſt the ſone of God, much more wiſelie by hys babling. Yet am I cōtent to let his own gloſe be his owne iudge in theſe matters. His wordes bee theſe. They worſhippe me in vaine, with the teachinge of ſuch as remaine in the

And marke againe good chriſten hertes, what they win by theyr gloſes and multiplied wordes, wherby in fayth it were verie eaſy to confute them all, euen by the teſtimonies of their owne doctours (as Bucere, Ecolampadius, and Frith haue done perfectlie well, if theſe men woulde ſuffer there bokes to come to lyght) For theſe papiſtes do ſo mixte the trueth and ſalſehed together (for without ſome ground of trueth noman woulde beleue them) that the one piece of the tale ſtandeth commonly with the trueth and the other vttereth their ſalſhed.

But he thoughe he were boeth god and man, alledgeth ſcriptures alwayes to confirme his ſaienges, and commandeth his hearers to ſherch the ſcriptures. So doe Peter, Paule, Iames, and Iohn.

Timo. iii. by the ſcriptures, that he was manifeſtely declared in the fleſh to be verie man, and perfectly declared in the ſpirite to be God in the wonderouſe workinge of his miracles, was ſene amonge the angelles, was beleued in the world, and receiued into glorie, where he reigneth equale wyth his father, ſittinge at the ryght hand of God, from whenſe we no thing doubt, but we ſhal ſe him come down as the apoſtles dyd ſe hym go vp into the heauenes. Act. i. In the meane ſeaſon we beleue ſtedfaſtly that he is with his faiethfull church by hys holy ſpirite euen to the worldes Ephe. v. ende. For the which he gaue him ſelfe to ſanctifie it and cleuſe it, in the fountaine of water bi the worde, to make it vnto him ſelfe a gloriouſe congregacion wythout ſpot or wrynckle or any ſuche thynge, but that it ſhoulde be holy and wythout blame, Where contrarie wyſe, you (whiche accompte your ſelues onely, men of the churche) and ſpirirituall men, as the onelye partakers of the ſpirite (doe wyth out ſcripture or reaſone) teache vs laye and lewde men (as ye call vs) onelye wyth ſwerde and fire, that Chriſte

was not verie man haueinge a naturall bodie. For you ſaye that thys his bodie that he had maie be in. x. thowſande places at once. Whiche property, howe well it agreth with a natural bodie: al that haue any knowledge maye decerne. Againe you ſaye that this bodie of the ſame lengeth and breadeth that it hanged vpon the croſſe: maye be cloſed in a little boxe, contrarie to the ordinaunce of mans naturall bodie in the creacion. And where we ſe nothynge but a piece of breade (for you can not teache vs by the ſcriptures that the breade is chaunged) we muſt neades beleue, that their is a bodie, beſides the bread becauſe you ſaye ſo thought there can be perceiued neither quantitie nor qualitie, that is to ſaye, nothynge parteininge to a bodie. As for your anſwere of fayeth conſtrained to beleue thys wythout either ſcripture or▪ reaſone, that it maye haue merite, and that all theſe be naturall reaſons: I ſhall anſwere whan I come at thoſe wordes.
            In the meane tyme marke your owne maliciouſe wickedneſſe, how you wil haue▪ Chriſt to haue a bodie, nothynge lyke the naturall bodie of man, but inſenſible and infinit yet by your ſubtilties to be comprehedend, and wythin your liſtes, bandes and boxes, to be contained and haue hys meaſure appointed,

but in no parte agreable to our natural bodi which he did voultchſalfe to take vpon him.
            Thus after you haue denied him (by your wicked enuēcion) to be a verie mā, like one of vs (ſinne onely excepted) whych the ſcripture teacheth plaine: After you haue denied chriſt to haue a verie natural bodie and verie fleſh, then procede you to teach how he cometh in breade.

If you woulde ſaye by that worde, he tourneth him ſelfe into the fourme of breade and wyne: ſo then your doctrine is that Chriſte cometh vnto vs in breade &amp; wine. And we ſaye that he is comen all redie in the fleſhe, and in the ſame fleſhe is gone vp to heauen, and from thenſe ſhall come to iudge all fleſh. You ſaye lo, here is Chriſte. Lo, there is Chriſte. Loke whoſe ſpirites you be. You are of the world

If we loue together God dwelleth in vs, and his loue is perfece in vs. If any man ſaie, I loue God, and doeth yet hate his brother: that man is a lier. For he that loueth not hys brother, whom he ſeeth: how can he loue God whom he ſeeth not: Howe your hote bourneinge loue (whyche cauſeth you to bourne men that can not vnderſtand your gloſes) can be of god I know not: but thys wotte I well that when the people of Samaria woulde not receiue Chriſte, hys Luk.

                  . Apoſtles woulde haue had fire frō heauen to bourne them. But Chriſte anſwered. You knowe not, whoſe ſpirites you are. The ſonne of man dyd not come to deſtroy the ſoules of men: but to ſaue them. And you byſhoppes haue your authoritie to edifie and not to deſtroie. But the olde ſerpent and his firſt begotten caine, thē Pharao, next, Herod and the phariſeis, the olde byſhopes condemninge Chriſte, and you their ſucceſſours, baniſheinge his worde with crueltie: are of a

cōtrarie ſpirite. And where you byd vs take Take heede of carion. hede of cariō, ſurely your gloſe is a very carion, and the worde of God which you take a way frō al men ſaue gētlemē &amp; marchaūtes is the onely fode and life of the ſoule, wher it liueth as Chriſt him ſelfe wittneſſeth. Not Mathe. iiii. by bread only liueth man, but by eueri word that proceadeth out of the mouth of God. But the blacke birdes and rauenes, the pies and deuoreinge fleſhe crowes, they fede vpon fleſh, and theafore vpon carion. My wordes (ſaieth Chriſte) are ſpirite and lyfe. My ſpirite ſayeth God ſhall no longer remayne with man, becauſe he is fleſhe. Therfore whē the worde of God and the ſpirite of lyfe are not with your fleſhly teachinge: it muſt nedes be carion. Suche is your flieinge about the dead as about carion, for filling of your paunches. For the deade carions haue made you riche in youre monaſteries, chauntries and perpetuities. The deade carions of Becket, Benno, and darnel Gader, of Dunſtane woulſtane, Audrie and ſuche other haue filled your wide throtes ſo full, and you carie your praye ſo gredily in your monthes: that you are become dome dogges that you can not barcke but onelye at them that woulde reine you of that foule carion, and leade you home to take heede of your maiſters folde.

And to teache plainely what is carion: we do take it to be, what ſo euer you do bringe into the church of Chriſt (as his religiō) without hys holy worde and the liuely ſpirite of God. The ſame I ſaye, is that ſtinckinge carion that Paulle calleth Anathema, and the prophet warneth vs we touche it not. And Iohn biddeth vs that we do not ſo much as ſaye Ane and ſalute the bringers therof, leſte we be compted partakers of their iuell workes. I wyll paſſe with ſilence the roten ragges and carion bones of your reliques and ſuche lyke ware, that ſauoure little of the ſpirite of life, and of the worſhipeing of god in ſpirite and trueth. But for thys thinge we haue in hande, lettinge ſlippe all other your vnſauourie cerimoneis, and carianlyke relyques: more ſtinckinge carion ſurely, and more poiſenfull ſophiſtrie cauſeinge deathe and murren of ſo many ſoules was ther neuer in the worlde: then the gloſes and dreames of your idle braines about this mattier that we ſhal now handle, as ſhalbe proued plainelie by the grace of the liueinge God. Your termes of realities qualites, accedentes and dimencions, ſauour nothinge of the ſpirite of God: and therefore are they fleſhe and carion. The whole courſe of your boke labouringe to make Chriſte really and naturally

Therfore is this the carion, wherof we muſte be ware This is the diuelliſhe ſophiſtrie wherwyth the world hath bene ſo lōg bewitched in ſuch ſorte, that in the ſteade of the liuelie feading of their ſoules by the worde of God, the breade of lyfe: you haue filled theire eares and eies with darcke termes, dombe ſignes, and deceiueable ſhadowes, allwaies beateinge and burninge the poreſhep bleatinge a gainſte the filthy ſtinckinge carion, of your popeiſhe and I dolatrouſe tradicions. What other thinge (let all men iudge betwexte vs) are theſe ſophiſticall termes of realitie, quantitie, accedentes, dimentions and alteracions whyche are the onely foundacion of your boke, and the eſtabliſhement of thys fleſhly doctrine: but the vſuall termes of the ſubtile ſophiſtes of Cambrige and exforde, and the Sorboniſtes of pariſe? They can not be founde in the bokes of the holy ſpirite of the holy ſcripture of God▪ and therfor are they fleſhely ſophiſtrie and ſtinckeinge carion. Thys your boke all grounded vpon man, which is but fleſh, vpon the darcke ſentences

and blind termes of blind teachers, as Iohn Damaſcene and ſuch other: can be likened to nothinge ſo well as to carion. The whiche mattier is picked out of the maiſter of the ſentences or carionouſe ſophiſmes, chouſe whether you wyl call hym. And where you woulde ſeme to be moſt ſpirituall about the words of Chriſt, Hoc eſt corpus meum: ther you are all to gether carnalle and fleſhly.
            You wil haue a carnall chaunge, a carnal preſence, a carnall ſacrifice, A piece of paſte (as we ſaye) fleſhe and bloude (as we ſaye) to be carnally worſhipped wyth fonde geſtures. A creature to be made the creatoure. A vile cake, to be made God and man. Which doctrine (beinge examined by the ſpirite of God the triar of all trueth) ſhalbe founde Idolatrouſe carion.
            The reſidue of your preface would haue vs captiue to you Chriſtes vikeres, to your Seeke the trueth, at the miniſters of the church. doctours and mainteners. Theſe haue you alwayes heretofore called the churche of Rome. But nowe that you maye deceiue (if it be poſſible) the verie electe: by a falſe name calling it Chriſtes church. But in verie dede it is the ſinnagog of Sathan and the church of Antichriſte: becauſe you are in liueinge ſo contrarie to Chriſte, and becauſe you ſet▪ and eſtabliſh therin the ceremonies of Antichriſt

and banniſhe the pore ſhepe from the worde of theyr ſhepherde, ſeldome or neuer preacheinge vnto them Chriſte, but your owne baggage, nor yet ſufferinge the pore lambes to reade and feade of hys worde and paſture. But we all are not ſo foliſhe thus to be enchaunted. We haue Ieſu Chriſte before oure eies crucified, by your prediceſſours, which boaſted them ſelues to be the church▪ Whome alone we learne to knowe, to heare and to folowe nowe in theſe latter daies, becauſe your fathers, boeth of Rome and of Englande: haue led vs out of the waye vn whoreinge in to Babilon, and haue hitherto taught vs to worſhipe ſuche thinges as by their nature are no goddes, But nowe ſeing that we knowe God (yea rather ſeinge that we are knowne of God) we wil not returne agayne to your weake Idoles and your beggerie ceremonies, to the whiche you woulde haue vs ſlaues and do ſeruice a freſhe. But marke and take it for an anſwere. We haue Gala. iii. begone in the ſpirite, and we nether wyll nor can be made perfite by the fleſhe. We wyll make ſubiecte our ſenſes and captiue our vnderſtandinge to all trueth of goddes holy word, but to no lies of your idle braines and couetous conſpiracie, We are no longer vnder the ſchole of your popeiſh tradicions, for

we are all the children of God becauſe we haue beleaued in Chriſte Ieſu
            For ſo many of vs (ſayeth Paulle) as are baptiſed, we are clade with Chriſte, ſo that there is no Iewe nor Greke, no exception of yoman from Ientleman, or man from womā but wee are all one in Ieſu Chriſte, Therfore wil we ſtād in the liberti wherin Chriſt hath deliuered vs, and we wyll no more be wrapped with your ſeruile bondage, knowinge that whoſo trobleth vs ſhal receiue his iudgement who ſo euer he be. Therefore, all the fruites of the fleſhe, and al the workes of darckeneſſe ſet a parte, adulterie, Idolatrie, and ſuche like: we will walke in the workes of the ſpirite, loue, Ioye, peace, gentleneſſe, liberalitie, goodneſſe, faith, mildeneſſe and ſobreneſſe.

Becauſe nowe they ſhoulde haue had no conſcience of their ſinnes which hade thus ſacrified and bene once purged.

Therfore (ſayeth Paule) in the ſacrifices of The prieſte muſt do thys in the remembraunce of Chriſte. the olde lawe (whyche were not done wyth out bloude) was onely the commemoracion and remembraunce yerely of ſinnes. And Chriſte hym ſelfe ſayeth of thys oure ſacrament. Do thys in the remembraunce of me. Lyke as in the paſſouer (whyche was the figure Exod. xii. of oure deliueraunce by Chriſte the vn ſpotted lambe) yerely remembraunce was commaunded to be done.
            Though by the open word of god (who is able to chaunge what lyketh hym, whoſe powre no man euer doubted of, that had but the gifte of reaſone) the ceremonie of oure redemption, which they had but in ſhadowe and we haue in trueth (and therfore it ceaſed whan the bodye, that is Chriſte, did come and offer the true paſſeouer lambe) thoughe, I ſaye, thys ceremonie of the Iewes, be by theſe open wordes of God thus named.

And as that ceremonie (the eateinge of the lambe) was called the paſſouer, and he hym ſelfe called the lambe of god ſo like wiſe calleth he thys hight miſterie and ſacrament, hys bodie, and a newe teſtament in hys bloude. That as truely as the Iſraelites were deliuered forth of Egipte the angel paſſing by not hurting the people of that houſe (the dore poſts wherof were ſprinkled wyth the bloude of that

lambe) ſo verily ſhoulde Chriſte delyuer vs out of the Egipt of ſinne, and perfourme the thynge before figured.

Then goeth he farther to ſhewe howe he is the meate of the ſoule, and howe he ſhoulde be eaten. For the firſte, he ſaieth thus. Verilie I ſaie vnto you He that beleueth in me hath euerlaſting life. I am the breade of life, whiche came downe from heauen, that men might eate of thys breade and not dye. But to tell the wattier plaine. Thys breade that I wyll geue you is my fleſhe, which I wyll geue for the lyfe of the worlde. Thys offeringe of my ſelfe for you: ſhall reconcile the worlde vnto my father, and therby geue it life. This therfore is it that I haue ſpoken ſo longe vnto you, whan I ſhal be offerred vp for the worlde, and dye for the ſinnes therof: than ſhall I be the meate of ſoules, wherby they liue aſcerteined of the mercie of God, who nowe can denie nothinge vnto man ſeinge he hath geuen his owne ſonne for him. Thus therfore is my fleſhe the meate of the ſoule, beinge flaine for the deade that thei might liue. Not as you thinke, geueing it vnto you as I am counerſant amonge you (for that whyche is engendred of the fleſhe, is fleſhe, and therfore my fleſhe carnally eaten, can bring furth nothing

No thoughe it coulde and woulde eate hym: it ſhoulde auaile hym no more then the bodilie kiſſe of Iudas and the handeling of the Iewes auailed them. It remaineth

therfore, that the ſoule ſhal eate him Lerne to eate the fleſhe and bloude of Chriſte. which can be none other wayes but by liuely faieth in the bodie and bloude▪ offerred for vs vnto hys father. The ſoule hath no teth, and therfore none other maner of eateinge.
            Thus do we conclude, that the ſoule beinge a ſpirite and the meate ſpirituall: no mā ought to ſeke for to eate Chriſte in this ſacrament, bodilie, really, and carnally, but onely ſpiritually, as hys worde is ſpirite and lyfe.

Theſe are the bleſſeinges that flowe from thê ſo ſone as they wagge theire pope holye membres. I wyll not raile againe to your worthyneſſe. But as I haue begoue I Iacob. iij. wyll anſwere wyth ſcriptures.
            The tonge is a worlde of wickedneſſe. So

And he toke the cup, thanked, and gaue it them, and they dyd all drinke therof. And he ſayed vnto them, thys is my bloude of the newe teſtament, whyche ſhalbe ſhed for many. Verely I ſaye vnto you that from heuſe fourth, I wyll not drinke of the fruite of the vine, vnto the daye that I drinke it newe in the kingedome of God.
            In Luke, thus we reade. I haue with great Luke. xxii. deſier deſired to eate this paſſouer with you be fore I ſuffer. For I ſaye vnto you, that heuſe forth I wyll no more eate therof, tyll it be fulfilled in the kingdome of God. And he toke the cup, gaue thāges and ſaied. Take thys and deuide it amonges you. For I ſaye vnto you, I wyll not drinke of the fruite of the vyne: vnto the kingedome of God do come. And he toke the breade, and gaue thankes, and brake it, and gaue it vnto them and ſaiede. This is my bodie whiche ſhalbe geuē for you. This do ye in the remembraunce of me. Lykewiſe the cup after they had ſupped and ſayed. Thys cup is the newe teſtament in my bloude, whyche ſhalbe ſhed for you.

               So ſone as he came into the worlde, ther were called to witteneſſe three herdemen or Luke. ii. Mar. ii. ſhepeherdes: and three wyſe men out of the eaſte, to ſe wyth theire eyes and teſtifie vnto other, thys the cheife miſterie of oure religion, that Chriſte was come in the fleſhe: biſides the reſorte of the men of Bethlehem, to ſe theyr ſauioure wyth theyr eyes, and the plaine teſtimonie of Simion ſaieinge. Now Luke. ii. haue mine eies ſene thy ſaueing helth. More ouer Chriſt thus comeinge in the fleſhe was bodily preſent in the ſyght and eyes of al the worlde, the ſpace of. xxx. yeres, and what ſo euer miracle he wrought in the dodient appeared to the eyes and outwarde ſenſes. As Iohn. ii. when he chaunged water into wyne: ſtreigh waye it appeared wyne to all the outwarde ſenſes. Inlyke maner, ſuch as Chriſte healed bodeli, were thei lame, blind or lazar: ſtreigth

waye they appeared whole. And ſo conſeqētly in all the miracles that Chriſt wrought in ſenſible thinges bodilie: they ſo appeared vnto oure ſenſes. Whan he rayſed Lazar us frō death to lyffe, it was not countertaite: for he Iohn. xi. dyd eate and drinke in the ſight of all men. So lykewyſe, when Chriſte ſuffered moſte paynefull death in the ſyght of the whole world vnder ponce Pilate, he was crucified, deade and buried, that no eie or tonge ſhoud wittneſſe the contrarie. He deſended into hel (as Peter witneſſeth) in ſpirite, which falleth not vnder the knowelege of our ſences, becauſe 1. Pet. iii. the ſpirite goeth and cometh, man knoweth not howe.

               And ſeing we haue life euerlaſtynge and are made the chyldren of God by the teſtimony Rom. viij. of the ſpirite, we do ſeke no farther merite. But this worde merite is one of our iugling termes, wherewyth you blynde the people You promiſe merite for your mattēs, merite for your maſſe, merite for your eatynge of fiſhe, merite for al maner holines that you haunte.

               All thys is playne agaynſt your owne The anſwer. doctrine, for ſeinge that the bodie of bread is

cleane gone, and yet there remaineth a body that the mouſe or ape catcheth in his mouthe (or e

                  s they coulde not carie it awey) What ſhal we conclude by your doctrine: but that the mouſe or ape runneth awaye wyth that bodie whiche by your enchauntment, is conceiued into the place of the bread, which (blaſphemouſly) do name the body of Chriſt cō
                  ſecrated into the fourme of breade? But, you do anſwere, that lyke as Chriſt whē he was here in the fleſhe, dyd fyrſt eſcape the handes of Herode, when he ſlewe the chyldren, and afterwarde the furious Iewes, when they woulde haue precipitate hym: tranſiens per Math. iij. Luke. iiii. medium illorum ibat. Chriſte eſcapped thorowe the middeſt of them. So doth he nowe ſaye you. Your ſimilitude is euyll applied. For beſydes that there is no compariſon of Chriſte comynge in the fleſhe for the wealth of the world, vnto the bread thus altered for your pompe and pryde: we knowe, and Ioſeph and Mary do wytneſſe vnto vs that they knewe and perceyued by the benifite of theyr ſenſes, that thys ſame oure Sauioure Chriſte was in ſhape a very man. And we knowe alſo (by the teſtimonies of the ſcriptures) that he continued here very man in fourme and ſhape, beinge ſubiected vnto all our infirmities (ſynne alwaye excepted) for

the ſpace of. xxx. yeres and more, and that then he ſuffered death and roſe agayne, his fleſhe neyther being conſumed nor putrified, but ſtyll remayneth fleſhe incorruptible and immortal. Where as in the fourme of bread (wherein you ſay we ſee hym and eate him) we perceyue neither incorruption nor immortalitie. For it neuer continueth paſte the date of one moneth (if you incurre not the daunger of your fathers decrees) and commonly not one quarter of an houre, muche after the rate of the dayly newe created monſtros, of whō Ariſtotle maketh mētion. Who doubtles if he had harde of theſe monſtrous gods (made and marred all in an houre) woulde haue wrytten wonders vnto his poſteritie. If the cakes were preſerued from corruption and dyd continewe ſtyl immortal, as Chriſt his fleſhe did: then woulde your ſimilitude (in theſe two miracles) ſerue you ſomewhat better. But ſeing that your cakes do mould and corrupte, and his fleſhe eſcaped Herode, and the handes of his enemies, and coulde Pſalme. xv. neuer ſee any corruption: thys your ſimilitude proueth, that thoſe cakes of yours can by no meanes be his naturall body. Theſe two miracles therfore (as all his other) were done to declare hym to be ſubiecte to no power of man, but to worke all his workes ſo,

that no man can lette and hyndre ought that he hath determined to be done, but you muſt wreſt all that you can, to cloke your Sophiſtrie wythall.
               Nowe, your affirmation of. xv. hundred yeres wythout any proufe, but only becauſe you ſay ſo: hath ben anſwered by many learned men. As

alſo did not knowe any other waye to heauen then Chriſte: not eaten (fleſhe, bloud and bones) but hoped for and beleaued vpon to be the light of the heathen, the glorie of Iſraell, and the ſaluacion of the whole worlde. That like as by fleſhe and by man (euen the firſte man Adam) all the worlde was loſte and deade: ſo by Chriſte, takinge the fleſh of man (named the ſecound Adame) all ſhoulde be ſaued and haue life.
               Vnderſtande, that the true church hath alwayes had this belife of Chriſte. Firſte that he was to come, and nowe that he is come in the fourme of mā, &amp; in none other fourme of any other creature. And thys church, though it were alwaies a little flocke, as Chriſt our heade calleth it: yet was it neuer deſtitute either of thys ſpiritual knoweledge, or yet of trwe teachers and maintainers of the ſame.
               But God, allwaies of his goodnes, hath God hath neuer forſaken his church. continually ſtirred vp his faithful witneſſes of his trueth, to the cōdēnacion of the world, whiche canne go no farther then the fleſhe leadeth.
               Firſte had we Adame, who liued many yeres after Abel was ſlaine, and taught hys poſteritie of this ſede promiſed by God. For he perceiued by the death of thys innocent, that▪ a lambe ſhould be ſlaine (as Iohn ſayth

he was Nain euen from the beginuing of the worlde) and dyd firmely belieue, becauſe of the promiſe made, that by the ſede of the womā, and none other creature, the heade of the ſerpent ſhould be broken. After theſe we had Seth, Enoch, Mathuſalem, Noe and Sem.
               After them, or rather in the time of Sem, ſo ſone as wickednes did beginne to ſpringe againe: God ſent faithful Abraham &amp; taught him the ſacrifice of his ſōne Chriſt. In whom (taking the nature of man, and ſo offred a ſacrifice vnto his father, leſt we ſhould ſeke any other ſacrifice but Chriſt comeyng in the fleſh, and dieyng for vs in the ſame) the true faith, hath this only foundacion.

Than whan Ioſeph was almoſt forgottē (not of the faith full but of the Egiptians) God ſtirred vp Moyſes, and he teacheth plainely, that the lorde ſhal raiſe vp a man, euen like him, and he that wyll not heare hym, ſhall dye.
               
                  
Thus teacheth he lyfe by the ſpiritual▪ eating of Chriſte, that is to ſaye, by the hearinge of his worde and receiueinge hym into oure hertes by ſaieth, acknoweledgeing, that by the deathe of hys fleſhe, all fleſhe liueth. Yet for all the wonderfull worckes that this Moſes wroughte, for al the plain teacheinges that he taughte, ſo that he was worthyly called the faithfull miniſter of the houſe of God: onely Ioſue, and Caleb, are alowed of God, amonge the greate nombre of manye thouſandes that Moyſes led, that it maye clearely appeare, that many are called, and fewe founde fayethfull witneſſes of Fewe are found faythfull. the trueth to his choſen churche, which hangeth onely on the hande of the liueinge God not regardeing fleſhe or any outward thing but onely the worcke of the ſpirite and the promiſe to be perfourmed bi Chriſt (GOD and manne) in all thynges.
               After all theſe, God ſterred vp Gedeon, (the beater downe of Idolatrie) and other ſuch iudges vnto the time of Samuel, Dauid and Elias, who made hys complainte ſayeinge, Lorde, they haue deſtroyed thine altares, and ſlayne thy Prophetes, and I am lefte alone, and they ſeke my life.

Hath not the Lorde made folyſhe the wiſdome of this worlde? For after that the worlde by hir wyſedome, could not know God, in his wiſdom: it pleaſed god by the foliſheneſſe of preachinge, to i. Corh. i. make ſalfe them that beleue.
               This preachinge, of the liuing god (whiche ſent his ſonne, an euerlaſting ſacrifice for the lyfe of the worlde) cauſed the ſacrifices to

waxe colde, and that was it that cauſed the prieſtes of the Iewes, to perſecute the chriſtians ſo ſore, that not onlie the Apoſtles, were ſcaterid among the heathen, but alſo Ioſeph of Arimathia (a capitain that buried Chriſt) did fle, as our olde cronicles do report bi the prouidēc of &amp; god brought the faith into this realme of Englande, then called Bretan.
               This perſecutiō of the true churche (whiche Marke who haue ben the cōtinuars of perſecucion. was the flocke diſpiced) was ſtil encreaſed by the biſſhopes of the Iewes, criynge that the diſciples of Chriſte were diſceyuers teaching a newe faieth, errours and heriſies goynge aboute to withdrawe from the lawe of Moyſes as aperithe throughout the boke of the Actes of the Apoſtles, And this endured xlii. yeres, vntil the Iewes were cōpellid to forſake their owne contrey, being vanquiſhide and ouercome, and by the greate and iuſt puniſhemēt of god, diſtroyed by Titus and veſpaſianus.
               The diſciples alſo, being ſcatered thorow the heathen, but fewe in numbre, and as yt were a ſede for harueſt apointyd, did ſo preache the onely and euerlaſtynge god and his ſone Chriſte ſent in the fleſhe to gyne light vnto the world: that Idoles began to decay, ſo that the prieſtes of the Idoles ād the work men and makers of al ſuche Idoles, yea and

their owne brethern the Iewes, did in al places moue and ſterre perſecution. Thus was this pore churche, beynge but here and there an hanfull to gether, caried before kynges &amp; Emperowres, ſcourged, impriſoned, ſtoned, beheaded, but in all this did they ouer come through their head Chriſt, who gaue thē ſuche ſpirite and wyſedom that no man coulde reſiſt. So that the more chriſtiā men wer put to deathe, by fore and cruell tormentes: the more boldli and māfulli did newe ſouldiours ariſe in their ſtedes.
               Nowe when the helly powre can not preuayle by this way of open tyranny, agaynſt Chriſtes true churche: then dothe the deuille ſend forthe the diſciples and ſhcolars of the The ſophiſters are the deuilles meſſengers. preiſtes of theſe Idols, whiche were the ſubtyle philoſophers and eſpecially the Grekes of Athens who bringgynge forth reaſones of Ariſtotle and ſuche other: did ſubtilly diſpute agaynſte the reſurrection. In ſo muche that in his time Paule ſayd. we do preache Chriſt crucified, to the Iewes an occaſion of falling and to the grekes, foliſhnes.
               The Romaines alſo, were at that tyme, bothe enſtructed withe the Grekes ſciences and puffed vp ſo proudely, wyth their great conqueſtes
                     •
                  : that they accompted all other menne barbarouſe and foleyſhe in regarde

of them ſelues. So that thei ſmalli regarded this weake and weariſh company of Chriſt and his ſcholares, that the ſaying of Chriſte myght be true, the worlde loueth his own, and though the ſound of their voice wente thorowe the world, and they did continually growe and encreaſe: yet did the world perſecute them for the ſpace of. iii. hundred yeares And at that time wer they moſt cruelly handled, bi Maxentius, the tirant. Then god ſtirred vp Conſtantine who ſhewed greate fauoure Maxentius the tirant. to chriſtian men, ſuffered them frely to preache, gaue them leue to builde churches, and at the later ende of his life was chriſtened in Nicomedia. Now perſecution of the church began to ceaſe and than ſtreight began the name of chriſten men and Chriſtes churche to be cōmune to many, but ſo many hereſies, ſectes, and diſſentions did ariſe vp by ſubtelite of the deuill, and by this crafte ſtopped the truthe in ſuche ſorte that the true church was but in fewe. Euen then the chief of your doctours (menne ſuerly whom I neuer do diſpiſe, but when you do bringe them as witneſſes agaynſt the truthe) the beſt lerned I ſai, of al your doetours, partli blinded by the greke philoſophy, wherin they were noſelled euen from their infancie, and partly driuen therunto by the ſubtill arguments

               But to go forthe withe our purpoſe, thus was the church of Chriſt in the time of Conſtantinus (euen in the diſpite of the wicked) groune vp into eſtimation, and made ſo generall of ſo ſmall beginning: that al the children of god might openly beholde, that the folyſhenes of god is wiſer then men, and the weakenes of god is ſtronger then men. But ſuch is the eſtate &amp; condicion of men agayne (by the prouidence of God) that nothinge The churche of chriſt ſhall not continne

               Yet did the churche floriſh ſo long as the biſhopes did preache the goſpell of Chriſte in pouertie, ſo longe as the biſhope of Rome was not lord ouer the empier, but a feder of Chriſtes flocke, ſo long as al other biſhopes were no lordes, but paſtours and herde men watching carefully vp on their folde, not de

ſirynge dominion, rule, and worldlye gouernaunce, neyther ſekyng theyr owne honoure and gayne? But teachinge their britherne the kingdome of God. Suche good biſſhoppes were Athanaſius and Epiphanius.
               Such good biſſhopes were the membres of the true church, for yet wer they not ſo proud to name them ſelues God makers, but miniſters of God, ſeruantes apointed to beſtow his treaſures. And as they wer begotten children of the churche of Chriſt by the worde of truthe: ſo did thei liue and growe vp by the ſame word and by no mans doctrine.
               Thus continued they in chriſtian pouertie, to the yere of our Lorde. ccccc. xix. When Behold how God ſtriketh and healeth a gayne. Iuſtinius the Emperour of Conſtantinople did call them forth agayne, beinge longe diſquietid and ſore oppreſſed by the continuall warres of all realmes and prouinces, and boeth he and Iuſtinianus hys ſiſters ſonne, dyd ſhewe vnto thē greate be

Who as they onely are parte takers of the lyfe euerlaſtynge: ſo are they onely: and continually fedde wyth the fode, whiche fedeth into the lyfe euerlaſtynge, wyth thys breade that cometh downe from heauen, whereof who ſo eateth ſhall neuer dye: who Iohn. vi. ſo eateth or drinketh therof: ſhal neuer be hun grie or thirſtie.
               Nowe for your ſubſtanciall ſolution, for the ſubduinge of the ſenſes. You ſaye thus.
               The trewe churche of Chriſte, hath ſubdued Wincheſters wordes. theyr ſenſes: that they haue continually ſeene ſuch notable repugnaunce to their ſenſes, and yet were not moued in theyr fayth.
               For thys cauſe oughte we not to beleue The anſwer. theyr tales. Thys is like as the Phariſies myghte haue anſwered Eſaye, Hieremie, and other of the Prophetes, cryinge out on theyr Idolles, ſayinge that they had eyes and could not ſee, eares and could not heare, mouthes and coulde not ſpeake. And feete and coulde not go.
               They myght haue anſwered as they dyd to Ieremie. Templum domini, templum domini.
               The church of the Lorde, choſen by God

furth of the ſtocke of Leuie, hath ſo captiuated their ſenſes that they haue ſene continually theſe Idolles to be ſuche as you ſpeake, and yet were they neuer moued wyth them. Let theſe tales paſſe therefore. For thus dyd the prieſtes keepe the Iſraelites captyue in the tyme of Chriſte to their owne damnation. We are the diſciples of Moyſes (ſaye they) and God dyd ſpeake vnto Moyſes. But we knowe not thys Chriſte frō whence he cometh. None of the princes or heades of holy church beleue in hym, nor yet any of the Phariſies, but onely thys vnlearned multitude. The Rabbies ſee his miracles, they The Rabbies heare and ſe but beleue not. heare his preachinges: but they captiue their wittes and ſay that he is a ſinner, and al that confeſſe his name, they caſte out of their churches.
               Thys church, adourned and decked with much outwarde holines, hauyng their office or duitie preſcribed or appoynted vnto them by the worde of God, longe tyme together: rebuked the poore blinde man that reaſoned the cauſe of Chriſt with them, ſaying. Thou arte borne all in ſynne, and wilte thou teache vs? Nowe becauſe in all ages this cloke and craftie argumēt hath deceyued many, wherfore we wyll are no more what you of the churche do ſaye: but what Moyſes, the Prophetes,

the Apoſtles, the ſcripture of God, and Chriſt hym ſelfe, do ſaye. Of whō with cleare voice and manifeſte miracle, it was hearde from heauen. This is my dearly beloued ſonne in whō I delite, heare you him. For if we ſhoulde heare you in thys reaſon, Marke the fruites of my Lordes opinion. you woulde by the ſame brynge vpon oure neckes agayne, the Pope, his Pardones, Pilgrimages, Abbayes, yea the filthy Stewes, maynteyned continually in your eyes, and vnder your noſe, ſo longe. And yet in al theſe thinges you gentlemen of the churche, haue ſo well captiuated your wyttes: that you haue beleued and thought the open mainteinaunce of whoredome (both bodily and ſperitually) to be worthely cheriſhed, and that the one was ſeruiſeable for the commune wealth: the other profitable to Chriſtes religion.
               You haue ſo longe deceyued vs, that vnleſſe You ſhall mocke vs no longer you do bring the worde of Chriſt with you: we dare not truſte you any longer vnder the name of Chriſtes vicares, and Chriſtes church, whiche termes you do vſe (as appeareth by your bokes) not for any loue you haue vnto Chriſte, for then woulde you perſecute no mā, profeſſing Chriſt and cleauing vnto him onely and his worde, but be ready to e

                     •…
                   therne.

And by thys badge of loue ſhould we know you to be Chriſtes diſciples. In the meane ſeaſon we wyll folowe the commaundement of Chriſte, we wyll not folowe the voice of any ſtraunger, we wyll playnely proteſte oure fayth in the ſimplicitie of lambes or doues. Yet wyll we alwayes haue regarde vnto oure heade Chriſte. And that is the proprietie of the ſerpente. And we wyll ſtoppe Math. x. our eares whē you bringe in your inchauntmentes. For thoſe wordes of yours are of wouderfulle force. Fyrſte you do by them, call downe into a litle cake, or (as you do gloſe it more fynely) into a fewe accidentes: God the ſeconde perſonne in trinitie, who ſitteth at the ryghte hande of the father. Then, when you haue wroughte ſo wittilie and myghtely wyth Chriſte: you take man in hande, and woulde bewitche hym to beleue that, that cake is no cake, and that the breade is fleſhe, bloude and bones. You tell hym his eyes be blynde. His taſte and ſenſes deceyue hym. His reaſon is nothynge worth in your mattiers. For thoughe all the miracles of Chriſt dyd euē apeare as he wrought them. As if they were ſpirituall, they ſo appeared vnto the ſoule of man, and were felte ſpiritually, as the forgyueneſſe of ſynnes, the healynge of ſoules and ſuche lyke: ſo

doubtles, the miracles that Chriſte wrought bodilie, dyd appeare in the bodies wherein he wroughte them. But thys ſtraunge miracle of yours. muſte clearely mocke and delude all oure ſenſes and vnderſtandynge, and leade vs captyue to beleue that you can make God by his worde, of a vyle piece of paſte. Yet ſurely (in conſcience I thynke it) your ſelues do not beleue that there is ſo greate power in the wordes of God For if you dyd: ſurely you coulde not be ſo bolde as to burne it. For no fayle, if it can make God, it can deſtroye wycked men, yea though they be byſhoppes. Moreouer you ſaye.
               Two thynges are to be conſidered in Wincheſters wordes the Sacramente of the aultare, one that it is a Sacramente. An other that it is the thynge it ſelfe of the Sacramente, that is to ſaye Chriſtes mooſte precious bodye and bloude.
               Vpon thys I demaunde, what you do The anſwer. meane by thys terme Sacramente. If you ſaye that a Sacramente is a ſigne or remembraunce of an holie thynge (as all your owne Doctours haue defined a Sacramente) then wyll we ſaye (as the trueth is, and as we haue taughte heretofore) that this is the moſte holie ſigne, and bleſſed

remēbraunce of Chriſt our Sauiour, which offered his bodie for our ſinnes, and cōmaunded vs to frequent and vſe the ſame in the remembraunce of him, who dyed once for vs, and ſitteth nowe at the right hande of God, a perpetuall meane betwene God and man. And heare is the ful profite, vſe and commoditie that any man can haue by thys Sacramente. Yet this wyll not ſatiſfie you, vnleſſe you haue vs ſo captiue, that we wyl ſaye after you. The Sacramente is the ſelfe ſame thinge that it ſignifieth. Chriſt muſt be made in the remembraunce of Chriſt. I demaunde of you in all other thynges, be they holie or prophane, where you cā fynde me one thinge that is both the ſigne and the thinge it ſelfe. The holie Sacramente of Baptiſme is not ſo. The holy Sacramēt of circumciſion was not ſo. The holy Sacrament of the Paſchal lambe, was neuer named ſo in the olde teſtamente. Yet had they as playne wordes for them, as you haue for yours. For the circumciſion is called the couenaunt, and the lambe is called the paſſeo
                     •
                  er. But you wil haue the Sacrament to be the thinge it ſelfe, and the ſigne to be the Sauiour. For this intent no fayle, that you being but the ſignes and ſhadowes Marcke my Lordes intent of true Biſhoppes, your two forked cappes and labelles, the ſignes of muche holines

and knowledge in both the teſtamētes, your white raichet, the ſigne of chaſtitie and purenes, your precio
                     •
                  s ſhoes, the ſignes of precious fnote ſteppes in preaching the Goſpel: may be accompted the verie thinges thē ſelues that be ſignified. So ſhoulde we neither loke into heauen for our only Sauiour ſitting at the righte hande of his father, nor yet for true holines in you vpon earth, being ſatiſfied by your ſignes and ſhadowes, your lyinge Poprie, dombe and deceyueable ceremonies. It foloweth in your text.
               When we cal the Sacrament of the aultare God, we vnderſtande the ſubſtaunce of Wincheſters wordes the Sacrament, whiche is Chriſte God and man there preſent. And according to that vnderſtanding, we attribute al goodly honour vnto it. And in thys ſpeache, the worde Sacramēt, ſignifieth and giueth vnderſtanding by a ſpecial ſignificacion, and by excellencie (as learned men ſpeake of it) the thinge ſignified, beinge there preſent, that is to ſaye, the bodie and bloude of our Sauiour Chriſte, whiche can not be broken with hande, cā not be torne wyth teeth, or denoured of beaſtes, or putrified. Neither can the bodily ſenſes, herein beare any witnes to the contrarie, for they can not atteyne that. But when we vſe the worde, Sacramente, or the worde, hoſte,

and applye the ſpeach of it to ſuche a matter as may not be ſayed of the naturall bodie of Chriſte: then the ſpeache is verified in thoſe formes of breade and wyne, vnder the which the moſt preciouſe body and bloud of Chriſt is couered, as when we ſaye the ſacrament is broken or moulded, or altered, it is onely vnderſtanded of the ſayed forme of breade and wine, being the outward accidētes as the qualities or dimētiōs, which god ther preſerueth not otherwiſe by outward miracle, being thē ſuſteined: by his moſte preciouſe bodilie ſubſtance. Then when they be naturally ioyned to the ſubſtance of bread, whereof that God thus doeth not, mans ſenſes (becauſe thoſe accidentes be ſenſile) may Iudge for we ſe it ſo and thoſe accidentes be perceptible, by the bodelie ſyght and ſenſe▪ and withe the eie of the ſoule in faieth, we ſe the preſence of oure moſte bleſſed ſauiour Chriſt, who ther is the onely ſubſtance of the ſacrament, ſo longe remayninge vnder thoſe accidentes, as the forme of bread and wyne, vnder whiche (by the omnipotēcie of his worde, it pleaſeth him to exhibite him ſelfe vnto vs) doe remayne and contynewe.
               In your firſt liues (wherin is taught, that The anſwere the ſacramente is god and man, and therfore muſte be worſhiped withe all godly honour

is intollerable blaſphemie. For neither haue you any ſcripture to proue it to be God, nor yet that euer Chriſte or his dearely beloued apoſtles, taught that it ſhould haue al godly honour. At his holy ſupper he cōman̄ded thē al to eate this breade and drinke this cup deuiding it amonge thē. To ſette vp any newe God therefore, not taughte in the ſcriptures, is blaſphemie▪ and the ſettynge vp therof, deſerueth ſtoning to death by the law of Moyſes. And Paule byddeth that if an Angell Deut. xiij. come downe frō heauē, to preache any other Goſpel then that whiche the Apoſtles haue preached; we ſhoulde take hym as accurſed.
               And is not thys a newe Goſpell, to teach a Sacrament to be a God? to teache that the bread (which is a vile creature) is very God, and that it ought to be worſhypped wyth all diuine honour &amp; worſhip? The ſacramēt that Chriſt made and ordeined to be a memoriall of his death &amp; redēption by him: to be made Chriſt him ſelfe, is it not blaſphemie? A piece of paſt whiche was made but yeſterday, can it be made a ſacrifice to take awaye ſynne wythout blaſphemie? If a man ſhoulde call the ſacramēt of baptiſme god, and do al godly honour thereunto: woulde you not ſay he were mad? And yet is Baptiſme the chiefe ſacramēt, both becauſe it is the firſt ſacramēt 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
ſigne wherein the free mercie of God is declared and opened vnto vs: and that in it no les, thē in the other, we do receiue the promiſes of God, and his holie ſpirite, to the confirmation of our faith and ſure truſt in him.
               Moreouer oure Sauiour Chriſte ſayeth thus of Baptiſme. Iohn baptiſed you in water, but I wyl baptiſe you in the name of the holie goſte. And for a playne euidence and tokē of the ſame he ſent downe the holie goſt in a viſible fourme, both vpon the Apoſtles and them that they baptiſed in his name.
               If you had ſo muche in the ſcripture for the diuinitie of the other Sacramente: I woulde not ſo greatly wonder if your fleſhly iudgement did take it for a verie God.
               But ſeinge that wyth theſe ſcriptures you Baptiſme is not eſtemed as it is worthy. eſteme the one litle or nothinge at al, and yet wythout theſe or any other lyke ſcriptures, you maynteyne and defende (yea and that with ſworde, fyre and faggot) that the other is God and worthy of all godly honoure: I can not but merueile, and that greatly. Yea and muche the more, for that you hauynge the experience of the feyned miracles that haue bene wroughte for the eſtabliſhynge of the fleſhly preſence of Chriſte in this Sacrament (as I am ſure you had by one Nicholas Geruis prieſt, who pricked his fingar in

the tyme of his maſſe that the bloude might ſeme to fall from the breade, vpon the corpreſſe and aultare cloth, as appeared at Paules croſſe, wythin the. v. yeres laſte paſte) ſhoulde yet ſo blindly and tirānouſly maynteine this deueliſhe and moſt wicked errour, I meane the deitie and godly honoure that you attribute to this ſigne or Sacrament.
               If the whole courſe of your tale (whiche I haue rehearſed) be not altogether Sophiſtrie: ſurely, I neuer learned Sophiſtrie: For when you come to tell vs what is broken, Marke my▪ Lordes Sophiſtry. what is moulded, and what the miſe do eate: then ſay you that the Sacrament is the hoſt, the fourme of breade and wyne, and the vtwarde accidentes, as the qualities and dimē
                  ſions. And this fourme, theſe outwarde accidentes, theſe qualities, theſe dimenſions, are broken, are moulded, are altered, and muſte no more be God.
               Thus you woulde blynde vs wyth your Sophiſtrie, and make vs to beleue that it is God when you call it ſo: and no God but accidentes, qualities and dementions, when you wyll haue it ſo. Agayne notwythſtandyng you do eate the ſame thynge that you do breake, and breake the ſame thynge that you do eate: yet when you eate it, it muſte be God, and when you breake it it muſt be but

accidētes &amp; no God. Moreouer, if it chaunce you to touche it wyth your teeth, and ſwalowe it downe your throte, make it ſuffre heate in your ſtomake, and become paſſible otherwayes: then is it onely the fourme, the outwarde accidentes, the qualities, and dimēſiōs, and no God. But you deceyue your ſelues with vayne wordes, and therfore, like as you do breake the outwarde thynges: ſo do you eate and are fed with the ſame ſophiſtical ware, where of ye dreame. Thys is muche like a man that dreameth a
                     •
                   the night longe. that he hath eatē, quaile, raile, and cur lewe, and that he hath drokē pleaſāt wine his fyll: and yet in the mornynge he is neuer the leſſe hūgery and thurſtie, becauſe he had nothing, but the fourmes, ſhadowes, outwarde accidences, and qualities. But the litle mouſe Learne wit at the mouſe. is muche wyſer, then you make your ſelues. For ſhe can knowe the fourme of your cake from the cake it ſelfe. Paynt it in fourme and qualities as craftelie as you can, ſhe neither wyl nor cā feede vpon any ſuche qualities or fourmes. Neither is ſhe ſo foliſhe to be mocked with any ſuche dreames. I ſpeake playne engliſhe nowe: yea I can not nor wyl not vſe any ſophiſtrie. And we al that be engliſhe men, do earneſtly deſire you, to tell vs in engliſhe, what you do meane by thoſe termes,

accidentes, qualities, and demenſions, which I do know you cā neuer do, onles you do reigne in the bowelles of ſophiſtrie. For thei are the peculiar termes of that deueliſhe arte. Yet amongeſt ſo many your ſubtlie termes you haue one good ſentence, howe it eſcaped you I can not tell. Wyth the eye of The Lorde open the eye of your ſoule the ſoule (you ſay) in faith we ſee the preſence of the moſte precious bodie of our Sauiour Chriſt. Theſe your wordes are euē the very words of our beliefe. This is the thing only &amp; wholy that cā worke in this ſacramēt. For if it be the fode of the ſoule only (as doubtles if is) thē cā not the bodilie inſtrumēt meddle therwith. It muſt be receiued by the powers of the ſoule only, which are ſpiritual. But no bodilie &amp; carnal thing cā be eatē of the ſpirite for the ſpirite muſt be borne &amp; nourriſhed of the ſpirite, likeas the fleſh is borne &amp; noriſhed of bodilie thinges. I cōclude therfore, that in the ſacramēt, we do not eate bodilie, carnally &amp; really the bodi of chriſt, but onli ſpiritually as you haue in this place ſaid ful wel (wyth the eies of our ſoul in faith) for the ſoule hath none other inſtrument, wherby it maye take fode of life, but fayth &amp; the knoledge of god whiche fedeth euerlaſtingly as Chriſt ſaith. This is the wil of him that ſent me, that euery one that ſeeth the ſon &amp; beleueth in hym,

ſhal haue euerlaſting lyfe. And I ſhall repſ

For you haue alwaies tolde vs a craftie tale, ſayinge that Chriſte remayneth ſo longe vnder the accidentes, as the fourme of breade and wyne doth remayne.
               Lo this is it that you doubt vpon, fearing to make ſuch play
                     •
                  e anſwer whē you bringe in theſe doubtes, in the ſixtene leafe of your boke.
               If there remayne no ſubſtaunce but the Wyncheſter in the. xvi. leafe of his boke. ſubſtaunce of the body and bloud of Chriſt, it muſte needes be then, that the ſame corrupteth, or elles when goeth it awaye? or where haue you ſcripture to declare the goinge awaye of Chriſt from the hoſte?
               Before you anſwere ſubtilly like a Sophiſter, The anſwer. ſayinge. What if I and ſuche other prelates can not tell, deludynge one queſtion wyth an other (as the maiſter of Sopiſtrie Iohannes de lapide teacheth to delude argumentes) but nowe boldly like a biſhop with out'any ſcripture, onely becauſe your father and mother churche of Rome doeth ſaye the ſame: you affirme that Chriſte remayneth ſo longe as the fourme of the bread remaineth, that is, from the tyme it is made, to the tyme

it is deuoured ether by man or mouſe, or els 
                     •
                  oth by other miſſe fortuue, or by mouleyng miſcarie.
               Oh foleiſhe &amp; blind guides. To what filthy abſurdities muſt ye of neceſſitie be driuē by this fond opinion that here is no ſubſtāce but the ſubſtance of Chriſt: and that this ſubſtance remayneth ſo longe onely as the forme of breade remayneth: For this forme remaynethe euen when the mouſe rennethe awaye withe it. The forme of breade remayneth, when it is broken, eaten, and mouldeth. And what ſo euer goeth into the mouth (ſayeth Chriſte) the ſame goeth into the bealie, Mathe. xv. and ſo is conueighed farder. So that this whiche you teach of the reall, carnall, and bodilie preſence of Chriſte, may well be called deuelliſh ſophiſtrie. For ſeyng that al lies are of the deuell (as the father and authoure of them) theſe lienge blaſphemies muſt neades be of him, and verie dyuelleſh ſophiſmes to ſet forth his kyngdome of darkeneſſe.
               The ſpirite of God, and the ſpiritual doctrine of the holie goſte, can not dwell yn you bycauſe you be fleaſhe. The ſpiritual eating of the bodie of Chriſt by fayeth.

our ſinnes, hath pacified the wrath of his

               I beſech al chriſten herts to marke the circumſtāces, and iudge whither they do leade Chriſt ſaieth in the. xxi. of Luke. Wyth gret deſyre haue I deſiered to eate this paſſeouer wyth you before I ſuffer. Chriſt ioyneth together, this olde ſacrifice of the paſſeouer, and the geuyng of hys bodie in this only ceremonie. Wherfor, we may not part them in ſearchinge the meanynge of hys worke and wordes: ſeinge that, he hym ſelfe coupled thē to gether, bothe in dede and ſpeache.
               We muſt therfore cōſider and marke, how and after what maner Chriſte and his diſciples are named to eate the paſſeouer: when

they eate the lambe onely, which was onely the ſigne or remēbraunce of the paſſouer. In the paſſeouer, they gaue thankes for theyr deliueraunce, whē the Egyptiās and the kinges ſeede were ſlayne. In this ſacramēt thā
                  kes are gyuē that the ſonne of the high king is ſlayn for the ſaluatiō of the worlde.
               The lambe and the feaſt itſelfe are called The lambe is called the paſſeouer. the paſſeouer. The one was but a ſigne, the other was but the remēbraūce of the paſſing angell. So lykewiſe this breade or ſacramēt is callyd the bodie of Chriſt, when it is but the remēbraunce and thankes geuynge, for the death which Chriſt ſuffered in hys bodie The cupe alſo he calleth the newe teſtamēt in his bloude, where the bloud of the lambe ſprynkled vpō the poſtes was but a ſhadow of the old teſtamēt and a token to the angell of godes fauour. And thys bloude of our ſauiour Chriſt is a cōfirmaciō and eſtabliſhemēt of his teſtamēt, as both the epiſtle to the galathians and the Hebrues do witneſſe. and the teſtamēt ſo lōg before promiſed was this

You anſwer agayn by a ſimilitude.

For after you haue tyed Chriſt to theſe creatures, breade, wyne, and water, you muſt haue the grace of the holye goſte in like maner tyed to oile and water, and ſtreight after the godhead to bread and wine. Me thinketh you be wours then the Phariſes. For they compted it blaſphemie for Chriſte (beinge a verie man) to make hym ſelfe a God. What thynke you they woulde ſaye, if they heard you ſpeake thus of breade and more vile creatures?
               In hys praiers, your doctour Damaſcene calleth the deade Images Sanctas et Diuinas, Holye and godlie, thought you helpe to cloke hym with more clenly termes, as you

are full craftie in your generacion. And now (ſayeth he) hath he ioyned hys godheade to breade and wine.
               Nowe do I perceiue, that the worſhiping and high eſtimacion of Images: is the beginninge, The worſhipinge of Images is the fountaine of all iuell middes and ende of all wickednes and blindneſſe, as the wiſeman teacheth. For after that Damaſcene hath taken vpon hāde to defende the deade ſtockes to be holy and godly: he careth not what he teacheth after warde. Truely, I woulde haue wiſhed more ſhame in your foreheade, thē to haue brought in ſuch a doctour for your chiefe foundacion whoſe wordes you dare not for ſhame reporte truelie as they lye. Agayne where we be taught to cal vpon the father in the name of hys ſonne Chriſte, and that we haue none other name vnder heauen wherby helth is promiſed to men: your doctour wyll be healed by the prayers of our ladie.
               Ther is muche other made ſtuffe in your doctour, whyche I do paſſe wyth ſilence, becauſe al men maye iudge him what he is, by that he hath ſpokē alredie. Yet this one thing maye not bee omitted. He addeth more ouer that the bodie cometh not downe from heauen, and yet the breade and wine be tranfourmed into the bodie and bloude of God.
               Thus confoundeth he the natures, callinge

it the bloude of God. He bringeth in newe and ſtrainge ſchole learneinge of tranſubſtāciacion. He maketh. ii. bodies of Chriſt One that cometh not downe frō heauē, and an other that is in thys tranſformacion vpon earth. Thys is your great clarke and principal witneſſe, worthy to be ſet forth in al languages, and his learneinge enlarged wyth your annotatiōs, and al the conning and wit you haue. You are much more mete to be an interpretour of ſuch one, thā to trouble your ſelfe wyth commentaries vpon ſcripture.
               But aſke hym how it is tranſformed and chaunged: and he ſaieth, the maner is inſcrutable, Marche the conſtancie of this doctour. and can not be ſerched. Yet will he not be aſhamed (as thought he knewe thynges that coulde not be knowne) to teache howe. ij. wayes. Firſt, as Chriſte was borne of the virgine marie Thē as the breade by eateing and the wine by drinkeinge, are chaunged in to the bodye and bloude of him that eateth and drinketh naturallye: ſo are theſe chaunged into the bodie of Chriſte a boue nature. But neither of your ſimilitudes agreth. For theſe two worckes afore named, are worckes of trueth, and therfore do thy ſo appeare vnto the knowledge of man, as they are done in dede. Chriſte was borne of Marie the virgine, verie mā accordeinge▪ to the Prophecies

that were ſpoken of hym before, and was ſene conuerſaunte wyth mē, the ſpace of. xxx. yeares. But your myracle did neuer appere one moment.

No man denieth but thys is true, You brynge the worde and we brynge the worde. But the doubt is onely in the ſignification and meaneynge. You ſaye that (eſt is) ſignifieth, is chaunged is trāſformed, whē both the form remaineth ſtyll, and you haue neuer one ſcripture that maketh for you: but manie that maketh againſt you, byſides the liuely feleynge of our fayeth, which muſt haue God in higher eſtimacion, then for to tye hym to any dyle creature. Yea, the whole courſe of the chriſten religion, which acknowlegeth that▪ Chriſte is aſcended vp from the earthe to the heauens and there ſytteth on the ryght hand of God the father to be our mediatour and meane whom he hath choſen ther to reygne tyll he come agayne to treade downe hys enimies vnder hys fete.
               
                  
We can therfore receyue non ſo groſſe fō
                  tence of the chaunge and traunſformacion of bred and wine into the bodie of Chriſt. But according to the whole courſe of ſcripture: we worſhype our lorde God, ſpred thorowe all ouer all and in all hys creatures, Infinite, in cōprehenſible, whom the heauen of heuenes can not contayne, and hys ſonne Chriſt, humblynge hym ſelfe vnto our vyle nature, but nowe exalted farre aboue the Angelles. And where we finde any thynge ſpoken or writtē not agreable with this doctrine of our faieth and chriſtē religiō, if a man do ſay it (though he take vnto hym the face of an a

But that he dyd ſo is oure controuerſie and thys thinge are you not able to trye nor iuſtifie.
               But you thinke it is inoughe to denie all thys at one worde, and ſaye, thys is not the figure or ſigne of Chriſtes bodie (no fie for ſhame) but the verie bodie of our Lord glorified. For oure Lord ſayed, this is not the figure of my bodye: but my bodie. And euen ſo, and more plainelye, Chriſte ſayde. I am the verie vine, and not the figure of the vine. But your doctoure (as Ecolāpadius geueth warneinge in the begininge of hys boke) is nothing ſubſtāciall. The texte that he bringeth out of Iohn: maketh cleare againſte him Iohn. vi. For no man can be ſaued vnleſſe he eate the fleſhe of the ſonne of man, and drinke hys blonde. Moiſes and the prophetes were ſaued therfore dyd they eate hys fleſhe and

drinke hys bloude. And yet had they neuer Chriſt bodilie, naturally, and carnalli amongeſte them. It is not ment therfore of the carnall and bodilie eateinge, but (as Chriſte teacheth in the beginninge of the ſame ſermon) he is eaten by fayeth, for ſo onely myght the olde fathers eate him. And ſo doth Paul witneſſe that the fathers dyd eate hym. The fathers (ſayeth he) dyd eate the ſame ſpirituall i. Corhi. x. meate and drinke the ſame ſpirituall drinke. They dyd all drynke of the ſame ſpirituall ſtone. The ſtone was Chriſt. Againe, where Damaſcene bringeth in this texte, he that eateth me lyueth for me: it maye proue playne, that the

Streight after your doctour cōeth to the point you would haue him, to teach Idolatrie boeth wyth outwarde geſturs and in warde affections. And vpon this do you diſcant in your annotaciōs. But to handle this mattier worthily: would aſke a whole boke I wil therfore bring in one onely text, which Chriſte bringeth out of Deu. againſt the diuil. Deut. vi. Mat. iiii.

                  ❧ The foundation whereupon oure fayth is grounded.
               BUt I do take our doctours and reade them wyth lyke iudgement as I do the Rabines of the Hebrues. That is to ſay, to be mē learned and highly endued with knowledge of ſecret thynges, and therefore that they cā open deaply hid miſteries. But yet al men of iudgemēt may know that they haue their gyftes but vnto a certeyne meaſure, and as they are mē, ſo do they erre many tymes, in the mattiers of moſte weight &amp; importaunce. Wherby is wrought the marueilous wiſedome of God, who onely wyl be accompted alwaies true, vprighte and iuſte in all his wordes, and that all men ſhould appeare (as they are) lyars. If in any one man ſhoulde reſt the fulnes of al trueth, we woulde by our weakeneſſe verie proudely ſwere into his wordes, thereupō eſtabliſh oure beliefe, and make hym as it were an earthly God.
               Paule therefore led by the ſpirite of God, taketh his maiſter Gamaliell and the greate Rabines, to no counſell in the ſettynge furth of the high miſteries, which God had reueiled vnto him. No he woulde not confer with

fleſhe and bloude, that is, with any man, notwithſtanding he him ſelfe was wonderfully enſtructed in the lawe, and became irreprehenſible therin, beinge a phariſei, that is to ſaye, an interpreter, and (as your men are) a doctoure hym ſelfe. Notwythſtandynge he bryngeth nothynge of Thalmud, he teacheth not hynge by the traditious of their fathers, but by Moyſes, by the prophetes, and the open worde of God, whereupon onely fayth can haue his foundation. Fayth is of hearing ſayth Paule, and this is by the hearing of the worde of God, and not of mans doctrine.

Wherefore, ſeinge the worde of God is an infallible trueth, it hath no contrarieties in it ſelfe. All the worlde muſte aſſent hereunto. But thus the Deuyll procedeth to his cauillations, from thynges euidently true, by little chaunge, to thinges euidētly falſe. Heauē and earth haue a kinde of contradiction, Chriſte is in heauen where ſaynt Stephane dyd ſe him. Ergo he is not in the earth, in the ſacrament of the aultare.

Chriſte aſcended into heauen, Ergo he taryeth not here. He ſitteth at the righte hande of God, Ergo he is not in the ſacrament of the aultare. He is the creatoure. Omnia per ipſum ſacta ſunt. All thinges be made by him. Ergo, he is not a creature made of breade.
               He dwelleth not in the tēples made with mannes handes, Ergo he is not in the box vpon the high aultare.
               Your ſolution to theſe opē ſcriptures and The anſwre. moſte euident argumentes: is at one worde, and that is this.
               They be taken for notable cōtradictions Wincheſters wordes. and inſoluble ſophiſines, and in effecte, in all theſe argumentes there is no contrarietie or contradiction in the thinges, but onely a repugnaunce, and impoſſibilitie to mans carnal capacitie.
               But I beſeche you (good biſhop) is there The anſwer. no contrarietie in the thinges? Is not heauen and earth cleane contrarie? Haue you ſo captiuated your wittes, and dulled your vnderſtandinge, that you cā not perceiue thoſe two thinges to the cōtrarie? God is the creatoure and maker of all, therefore can he not be a creature made of breade. He dwelleth not in the temples made with mannes handes, for the heauē of heauens can not contayne him: therfore is he not encloſed in a litle box, and

hanged vp by a bande. It is to muche ſhame, for any prieſt, biſhoppe, or chriſtian man, to thinke ſo vnreuerently of the ſecrete maieſtie of God, as that he mighte be bounde vnto a place, encloſed in a cake or a litle boxe, ſeinge boeth heauen and earth be full of his dreadfull maieſtie, and we, what ſo euer we be, do lyue, be moued, and haue our beinge of him.
               He is infinite, incomprehenſible, vnmeaſurable, higher then the high heauens, lower then the deape &amp; botomles waters, he meaſureth the wyde worlde wyth his ſpanne, and cōteyneth all encloſed in his fiſte. Wyth him the light dwelleth, and the ſunne beames are at his orderynge. By hym is ruled lyghte and darkedeſſe, lyfe and death, and altogether. Wherefore when thou can

In the meane tyme I muſte take it impoſſible not onely by carnall capacitie: but alſo by ſpiritual iudgement grounded vpon the worde of God, &amp; by the gifte of reaſon, wherby al men cōſidering the worke of God in the cretion,

               Nowe, that it is contrarie to the humaine nature of Chriſte to be encloſed in bread and ſparred in a litle box: thus mape we more largely proue vnto you.
               Chriſte in his humaine bodie, forſaketh the worlde, he goeth vnto the father. He dyd keepe thoſe that were his, ſo longe as he was in the worlde. And when he departed out of the worlde, he deſired his father to keepe them. He cōforted them when he went awaye, ſayinge that it was profitable for thē that he departed, that the ſpirite of cōfort might come. He promiſed to come againe viſibly and with glorie as he went, and in the ſcriptures there is none other comynge of Chriſt taught vs, but the coming firſt in humilite to take our fleſh vpō him, &amp; afterward in glorie, to iudge all fleſhe, whiche thynges

are declared, Math. xxvi. Marke. xvi. Luke, xxiiii. Iohn. xiii. xvi. xxii. Actuum. i. vii. Rom. viii. Ephe. i. ii. Corhi. vi. Hebru. viii. ix. x. xii. i. Theſſ. iiii. i. Petre. ii. So that by the ſcriptures we muſte needes be compelled to deny the bodie of Chriſt and his humaine nature, to be nowe any where vpon the earth, 
                     •
                  or els with the Marcioniſtes, muſte we take from him, the veritie of his body: and deny that he hath a body according to our nature.
               This thinge doeth Auguſtine handle at large in the epiſtle he writeth to Dardamꝰ, Auguſtine to Dardanius. vnto whom I ſende you that ſticke ſo muche to doctours. There he teacheth you, that, as he is God, Chriſte is in euery place. But in that he is man, he is in heauen onely, whiche all the ſcriptures do teſtifie. And it is the chiefeſt poynte of oure beliefe, that he is in heauen and ſitteth at the righte hande of the father.

                   other place, but where the worde of Chriſt declareth him to be, ſeinge Chriſte hym ſelfe warneth vs that falſe prophetes ſhall come and ſaye, lo here is Chriſt, lo there is Chriſt, and commaundeth vs, that in nowife we beleue them. But we ſhall then onely loke for him when he ſhal come with ſuch ſhyne and

brightneſſe, as is the lighteninge from the Math. xxiiii. eaſt to the weſt thorowout the whole world. Which wordes, thoughe they maye be well vnderſtande of the fall and decaye of al theſe outwarde rites wherein the Iewes and hypocrites of all tymes haue ſet the high worſhippe and kingdome of God, and alſo of ſuche ſeducers as woulde promiſe them ſelues falſe Chriſtes and ſauiours: yet neuertheles as the ſpirite of God hath al thinges preſent, whiche are, whiche haue bene and ſhall be: ſo are the wordes of the ſpirite generall, ſeruing for all tymes, fit, apte and meete to reproue al abuſes. And here may we plainly eſpie that they are ſpoken agaynſte al maner of bodily preſence of Chriſte, both in the aultares here, and there in the breade, and in the chambers and corners where he is holdē vp and ſhewed betwene the prieſtes fingers to be worſhipped.
               But if you deſire yet ſome one place of ſcripture ſo plaine that it can not be reſiſted, by any gloſes or ſophiſtrie, but that it ſhall ſtande plaine contrarie and cantradictorie to your doctrine, reade the thirde of the Actes. That heauen muſte receyue and haue Ieſu Chriſte, vnto the tyme that all thinges be reſtored. Act. iii. The wordes of that place are verie playne, for he doeth not onely make Ieſu

Chriſte a very man, as Moyſes was, whoſe nature was not to be in two places at once: but he addeth alſo theſe playne wordes. That the heauen muſte receyue thys ſame Ieſu Chriſt vnto the tyme that al thinges be reſtored. Quē oportet celum accipere vſque ad tempus reſtitutionis omnium.
               Thus do we procede therefore. Chriſte hath (by his departynge, his ſittynge at the ryghte hande of his father, and returnynge agayne at the tyme appoynted) ſo playnely appoynted by the ſcriptures, one onely place where we ſhall ſeeke his naturall bodie: that, ſo many of vs as wyll not ſtryue agaynſte the manifeſt trueth can not double, but that his bodie remayneth there onely, where he ſheweth hym ſelfe to be. We conclude therefore, that it is contrarie to Chriſtes religion to ſeeke him vpō the earth encloſed in a box.
               Secondly, Chriſte hath ſhewed where he wyll be vntyll the daye of iudgement, that is to ſaye, at the right hande of God his father, tyll that he hath made all his enemies his fote ſtole. Wherefore we can ſeeke hym in none other place, wyth ſure fayeth to fynde hym.
               Thirdly agaynſte your whole doctrine, (that the bodie of Chriſte maye be infinitely ſcattered thorowout the world and your wordes

a litle after folowyng, which are that the humaine bodie is not diuiſible by tyme or place, wherin you do cōfound the natures of Chriſt

                   giue that vnto the māhode, which is onely the proprietie of the godheade, and ſo opē the way vnto two hereſies) we haue the plaine teſtimonie of the Angel. You do ſeeke Chriſte crutified, he is ryſen, he is not here. Where as if his māhode had ben infinite as is the godhead: thē ſhoulde he haue ben there preſēt. For no mā cā deny but there was his godhead preſently. Neither cā you eſcape by this cauillatiō, that then he is infinite, indiuiſible 
                     〈◊〉
                   without circūſcriptiō of time or place whē you wil haue him, like as you do multiply your cakes into millions and thouſādes of thouſādes at Eaſter, whiche do al periſhe as it were in a momēt, for that which is infinite or indiuiſible cānot chaung the nature to haue his bondes and finite order aypoynted him, Wherfore we do moſt truly cal God &amp; his power only infinite: where man in al his nature hath his determinate meaſure of ſubſtāce, quātities, qualities and knowledge, as appeareth in Chriſte (who as he was very mā) did not knowe the houre and time of the day of iudgement of all fleſhe, was encloſed in the graue, and dyd walke vpon the earth and appeare alwayes vnto his diſciples

in that ſorte and maner, that at no tyme any occaſion myght be taken that he infinitly did fyll all places, no not that at any tyme he mighte appeare to be in two places at once, all his miracles do ſo faythfully witnes and reporte the truth of his humaine nature, and natural body, whiche your vaine opinion of encloſing him in breade, and making him infinite, goeth about to ſubuert.
               But nowe when you haue no ſcripture to proue your mattier true, that Chriſt as he is man, maye be in heauen and yet fyll all the Aultares of the earth: you do renne to the ſayinge of Eſaie the prophete. If you beleue Eſaie. vii. not, you ſhall not vnderſtande. The whiche wordes beinge ſpoken to Achas and the vnfaythful houſe of Dauid, that was afraied at the comming of two kinges of Syria and Damaſcus, whom the prophet doth threaten to be deſtroyed becauſe Achas wyll not beleue: ſerue nothynge to your purpoſe. The wordes be theſe.
               If you do not beleue: the cauſe is, you wil Obſtinacie is the cauſe that you can not beleue. not be faythfull. And ſo agreeth it well with the wordes folowing, when Achas wil aſke no ſigne. Is it but a ſmall thynge (ſayeth, Eſaie) to werie men wyth your infidelitie, oneleſſe you do werie my God? And thus in the trewe ſenſe we maye ryghtly tourne it

vpon your owne heades, whyche wyll wery boeth God and man wyth your brayneleſſe Imaginations, and wyll not beleue the open worde of God, becauſe you are vnfaythfull. Then come you in wyth your Lordelyke ſentence.
               In thys high miſterie, where God worketh his ſpeciall worke miraculouſ

                  ie, it is Wincheſters wordes. ſufficiēt to knowe that it is wrought, though I can not tell howe it is wrought, nor howe it agreeth wyth other his workes.
               I marueile (biſhoppe Stephane) that you wax not aſhamed of your writing. You ſaye The anſwer. that here is a wonderfull miracle wrought, but you knowe not howe it is wroughte: nor oure ſenſes, vnderſtandynge and fayth, (in whiche three, lyeth all the knowledge that man can haue of thynges naturall or aboue nature, as is afore proued) can perceyue no maner of miracle, ſeinge the breade and wine remayne in their kinde vnchaunged, as Luke and Paule do wytneſſe. So that (by your owne wordes) you ſeme worthy to be one of thoſe that affirme you knowe not what, beinge puffed vp wyth the fleſhly Imaginations of your owne myndes.
               Seinge all the other workes of God do appeare as God made them, if they were ſpirituall, they dyd appeare ſpiritually, if

they were bodily, they dyd ſo appeare, you mighte haue added with like ſhameleſſe forhead. This thinge that we biſhoppes do ſay muſt needes be true, though it agree neither with his workes nor his worde. For all men maye ſee that you maynteyne boeth this and all your other doinges.
               But in this ſophiſtry, the deuyl maketh mā 
                  Wincheſters wordes. to forget gods omnipotēcie, exceding our capacite, &amp; cauſeth vs to meaſure gods doinges by our natural imbecillitie: becauſe we cā not be in two places at once diſtant one from an other: we iudge the ſame repugnant in God.
               For ſoeth here you ſpeake vntruly of vs. For we al do beleue in hert and cōfeſſe wyth The anſwer. mouth: that God onely is almightie, and filleth al the heauen and the earth with his preſence: euen as ſure as he made al thynges in the heauen, the earth and the ſeas.
               This high eſtimation that we haue cōceiued of god by liuely faith: cauſeth vs to take it as a thynge cleane cōtrary to the power of the almightie, to be encloſed in a box, turned or cōſecrated (as you cal it) into alitle cake.
               But the manhode of Chriſte whiche was very man as we are (ſynne onely excepted) haue we already proued to be in heauē, at the right hande of his father, and therfore not in earth in the box hanged ouer the aultare.
               
                  
But Chriſtes being in heauē, which ſ. Stephane Wincheſters wordes. truly cōfeſſeth, was nothyng cōtrary to ſaint Paules true affirmation, that Chriſt was ſene to him in earth after his aſcencion.
               Nowe ſurely both their viſions of the glory The anſwer. of Chriſt our ſauiour &amp; the teſtimonies of the wōderful ſight that they did ſe: doth both ſtabliſh our purpoſe and cōfute your errour, but that you deale like a ſophiſter with thys word erth ſpeaking it after ſuch ſort, that the ſimple reader ſhould refer it vnto Chriſt being vpō the erth after the aſcētiō, which Paul neuer taught, nor any of the apoſtles. Theſe are the playne wordes of the ſcripture, touching this mattier. After that he had taught, that the higheſt dwelleth not in tēples made with mās hāde, againſte the opiniō of the hie prieſtes: Stephan, repleniſhed with the holy ſpirite, loking vp into heauē, did ſee the glory of god, and Ieſu ſtāding at the right hāde of god. And he cried with a loude voice. Lo I ſe the heauēs opē, and the ſonne of mā ſtādyng at the right hande of God. Here it is deſcribed wōderful plainely, that Stephane being vpon earth, dyd ſee Chriſte in heauen, by the wonderful worke of God, thus confortynge his firſt martyr and witneſſe of the glorie of his ſonne Chriſte.
               Paule lykewyſe (prepared from his mothers

wōbe, to beare the teſtimonie of Chriſt amonge the heathen) as he went to Damaſcus, was ſo daynely beſet wyth a wonderful greate lyghte from heauen. And then fallyng to the ground, he hearde a voice whiche ſayed vnto hym. Saule, Saule, why doeſt thou perſecute me? Then anſwered he. Who arte thou Lorde? And the Lorde ſayed. I am the ſame Ieſus of Nazareth whom thou doeſt perſecute. Of thys viſion and ſuche lyke doeth Paule ſaye. Dyd not I ſee Ieſu Chriſte: He ſayeth alſo. Laſte of all, as vnto one borne out of courſe, dyd Chriſte appeare vnto me. Whyche be the wordes whiche you do alledge, as makynge muche for your purpoſe. And you dyd brynge in thys texte out of courſe (if you be well aduiſed▪ agaynſte Lamberte, as thoughe it ſhoulde haue gotten the victorie, and ſtopped the mouthes of all men.

But if the mind of Paule maie ſerue you for this declaraciō: he ſayth in an other place, that whether he were in the bodie or out of the bodie, he coulde not tell, but rapt he was into the thred heauē, and into Paradiſe, wher he ſawe ſuche thinges as is not lawefull for man to ſpeake. Whiche wonderfull viſions were ſhewed by God to ſtrengthen his choſen veſſell (like as the other were vnto Stephane) and are written to encreaſe our faieth and hope which do beleue in Chriſt bi them. I maruaile much what fantaſie was in your heade at that time, and how it remaineth ſtil in you cauſeinge you to bringe this viſion of Paule, for the confirmacion of Chriſtes naturall bodie to be preſent in the ſacrament. But you are of ſuch powre, that for to ſtric

For who ſoeuer ſeketh the ſpirituall fode: he regardeth nothinge but the body of Chriſt offered for his ſinnes, though with his mouth bodily he receiue the bread, the figure of the ſame. If any haue

Yet dare we not ſaye that in the water is really preſente the body and bloud of Chriſte. He deſpiceth me (ſaith Chriſt) that deſpiceth you, ſpeaking of his Apoſtles. Yet is it no good argument to ſay therefore, that Chriſte is corporally in his Apoſtles. But ſpiritually we muſt boeth beholde &amp; moſt thākefully receiue our Chriſt in al his ſacramentes &amp; in al his meſſengers.

I tel you truth that it is profitable for you that I departe, for if I do not go awaye: that confortynge ſpirite ſhall not come vnto you. But if I go: I wyll ſende hym vnto you, etc. Whereby it appeareth playnely (agaynſte your wordes) that the preſence of the bodie carnally, is not profitable vnto vs

The which wordes if any man ſhould ſo groſſely interprete, as to expounde it thus, ſayinge, that by the power of God inuiſible, a man myght enter his mothers wombe, and ſo this fleſhe borne inuiſibly ſhoulde be profitable: euery man woulde laugh at his foliyſhneſſe. And thys is euē muche lyke your gloſes, cōtrary to the which we haue proued by the ſcriptures, that it is profitable that the fleſhe do depart that the ſpirite may come vnto vs, &amp; that the fleſh

which in this humilitie hath once ſuffered

                   the croſſe, and done the wyll of the father: is no longer profitable vnto vs vpon the earth▪ but nowe we muſte be borne of the ſpirite▪ al our conforte, al our hope muſte be of the ſpirite. For what ſo euer is borne of the fleſhe, is fleſhe, and therefore carnall, and no parte of our ſpiritual religion and ſpiritual byrth. You adde theſe gloſes, that inuiſibly we muſte haue this fleſhe preſent in the fourmes of breade and wine, and ſo muſte we eate the fleſhe of Chriſte really, but yet inuiſibly you ſaye. And ſhall we by inuiſible fleſhe (but yet very fleſhe) brynge lyfe vnto oureſelues, and be borne a newe agaynſte the leſſons of the ſpirite? If the preſence of the fleſhe in the bread be ſo profitable (whiche you can proue by no worde of ſcripture, and therefore we neede not beleue you excepte we luſt.) wherfore thynke you, woulde Chriſte rather hide him ſelfe in bread, then ſhewe hym ſelfe opē
                  ly, ſeinge boeth are lyke poſſible vnto hym: He ſayeth that thys is the wyll of the father that ſent hym, that whoſoeuer ſeeth the ſonne and beleueth in hym hath euerlaſtyng lyfe. Now for this doubt that you do moue, whether his fleſhe be caro viuifica, that is fleſhe Chriſtes fleſhe giueth lyfe. giuing life: that it is ſo, is the very foūdacion of our faith, and we both agree in this point▪
                  
But here ariſeth the doubte, howe this fleſhe geueth lyfe. You ſaye by eateinge the ſame reallye, and naturally in the breade wythout any ſcripture. But we taught by the whole courſe of the ſcriptures that the ſpirite onely is profiteable: do vnderſtand a ſpiritual eateinge of thys fleſh, whiche is taught in the. vi▪ of Iohn to be by the beliefein this fleſh, offered Iohn. vi. for the lyfe of the worlde as it is taught at length before.
               And where as you ſaye that Chriſte dyd by theſe words rebuke the groſſe and earnal Caparnaites: it is verye true an ſerueth ſtyl agaynſte all them that ſaye Chriſte muſt be carnallie eaten, be it in lōpes (as you ſpeake) or the whole bodie ſwalowed downe al togither, as you defende your ſelfe. If you ſaye (as you do) againe in thys place that Caro fleſhe, is taken for the carnall parte of man, then do you nothinge cōſider the circumſtāce howe Chriſte laboreth in this place, to teach the people, howe his owne fleſhe is profitable vnto them. Thys doctrine of yours therfore, is confuſed to gether, makeinge the ſpirituall eateing, carnal, and the verie feſh and bodie to be the ſpirite. For in your chaunge, howe can this be his verie bodie, which you cauſe to go and come, no man knoweth how

                  einge he hym ſelfe ſaieth vnto Didimus his

bodie hath verie fleſhe and verie bones, and is not lyke the ſpirite. You make him lyke a ſpirite to come and go into thouſand miliōs of cakes and aultares inſenſibly. You make him geue life alſo which is the chiefe and only propertie of the ſpirite. And wher you woulde cloke the firſte mattier ſayeinge that his bodie maye be in ſo many places, and be inſenſible becauſe it is adioyned to the God heade: you muſt learne to be ware, that in no wiſe you confounde the natures, as I haue ſpoken before. And likewiſe, whan you ſaye that this fleſhe geueth life alwaies, becauſe it is inſeparably adioyned to the ſpirite: you muſt acknowledge the proprieties of theſe. ii. in ſunder, grauntinge it to be the properietie of the ſpirite onely, to geue life, according to thys text ſpiritus eſt qui viuificat: though it do (by the fleſh and dodie of Chriſte, as the onely inſtrumēt and peculiar ſacrifice wherwith the wrath of God myght be pacified) worke in vs that be faythfull, the ſame lyfe. And this ſame fleſhe of Chriſte, is a ſtumbling ſtone in Zyon, to the wicked (as the prophet wittneſſeth) and is ſet vp to the rniue and reſurrection of many. It was vnto the Phariſeis a blindyng, and liuely to them onlie, that were ordeined to life, Vnto the Iewes whiche handled it, and to Iudas which

kyſſed it, and (as you would haue it) did eate it: it was death beynge of it ſelfe the ſauiour frome deathe. So that we maye verie well conclude, that the ſpirite onely geueth lyffe, and to them onely that haue thys ſpirite in their hertes, to thē I ſay, the fleſhe of Chriſt is profitable, and to them hys fleaſh is verie meate and hys bloude verie drynke, for they onely can feade ſpiritually of Chriſte God and man. For it is the breade that commeth frō heauē (ſaieth Iohn) that geueth lyfe vnto the worlde. And thys heauenly breade of the ſpirite doeth fede vnto lyfe euerlaſtynge, ſo that who ſo euer doth once taſte therof, ſhall no more be hongrye nor thyrſtie after the carnall fode. And as for your opiniō cōcernynge that the fleaſh (carnally eaten) ſhould be lyuely and confortable: you are not able to iuſtifi by any ſcripturs. And therfore beware how you eſtabliſhe it wyth your tyranny. wee haue learnyd thys goſpell, that Chryſt was crucified to ſaue ſynners, and to gyue lyfe vnto the worlde.
               But that he muſt be eaten bodylye to gyue lyfe: is a newe goſpell. For Iohn in hys ſyxte chapiter, doeth wholly declare and ſet forth the ſpirituall eateynge of the fleaſh of Chriſte by fayth, as is before declarede, contrarie to your carnall writynges.

You cloke the matter with clēlier termes (O biſhop, as you do al your mattiers) but in effect, this is al one with the noſe of waxe &amp; cōfuſed ſoune of belles. Your words be theſe. Prefatus ſum, inutiliter me verba effuſurum, ſi ad frāgendam

Oh what ſhall we ſay or thinke of ſuche biſhopes: It is no maruaile though you haue your brethern in ſmal reputacion and rayle vpon them at your pleaſure, ſeynge the worde of God is ſo ſmally regarded with you. Yea how can you loue God whom you ſee not when you hate your brethern, wyth whom you lyue, conuerſant derydeyng, deſpiſeing, and brenninge al that you can haue of God, in thys worlde, his holie word and ſcriptures. we take God to our Iudge, that to our knowledge, we do not abuſe the ſcriptures, neither write we any thinge, but wyth ſuche mindes, hertes &amp; conſcience, as we are redi to ſtand before hym and make anſwer at the greate day when he ſhall

appere. And becauſe we do knowe the ſcriptures inſpired aboue, from God hym ſelfe to be profitable to teache, to improue, to amende, to enſtructe in ryghtuouſeneſe that the man of God may be perfecte and prepared vnto all good workes: therfore haue we it in ſuche eſtimacion, that we can counte no learning good, but that is hereby confirmed and eſtablyſſhed.
               But let vs▪ returne to your fyrſt expoſitiō of theſe wordes. Caro non prodeſt quicquā, Iohn. vi. ſpiritus eſt qui vinificat. and Quod natum eſt ex carne caro eſt. That is The fleaſh profiteth nothynge, it is the ſpirite that geueth lyfe, that which is borne of the fleaſh is fleſh Thys (you ſay) is the true rule of our whole religion. The fleaſhe when it is carnallye eaten (as you wil haue it) engendreth nought els but fleaſh. Then if it be but fleaſh that it engendreth: then haue we no profit therbi for the fleaſh doeth nothynge profit. Contrary wyſe, the ſpirituall eatinge geueth life and engendrethe the ſpirite whiche onely feadeth the ſoule therfore we nede nothing to regard the carnall eatinge, whyche neither feadeth the ſoule nor bodie, for no bodily thyng can enter the ſoule nor no ſpirituall thynge can feade the bodie.
               Now, where you would myxte the fleaſhe

and the ſpirite to gether by this ſoluſiō, that the fleaſh of Chriſt can not be wythout the ſpirite, marke what we do anſwere.
               If we haue lyfe by the ſpirituall eatynge of Chriſt once offered for vs (as thepiſtle to the Hebrues doeth witnes) if we haue al one Hebr. x. i. Corhi. x. ſpiritual fode with the fathers, if we haue lif ſo many of vs as do thus beleue in hym, by the benefite of the ſpirite, as the. vi. of Iohn doeth tell at larg, if the rightuous liue by the fayth and not by bodily eatynge, if that whiche cometh from the herte do make the man holye or propha

It was not a pece of the lambe to haue a ſimilitude of fleaſh, but it was bread the general ſubſtaunce of mans bodily lyfe, euen lyke as Chriſt is the onely breade of lyfe and ſpiritual fode of the ſoule. Bread (I ſaye) it was to declare that lyke as breade is made of many graynes, whych all to gether do make but one bodie: ſo lykewiſe we Note the cauſe why this ſacramēt was inſtituted in breade. (beynge many beleueynge in Chriſt) are all one bodie in Chriſt, We are one breade and one bodie, ſayeth Paul, ſo many as be partakers of one breade. Why then ſhoulde we call it fode?

Let your owne cōſcience be Iudge in thys mattier.
               But O wicked Idolatours. If thys were God that you do thys handle, he woulde ſomtyme breake open his priſon (wherein he is encloſed) by his power and ſtrength. How be it he can do nothinge. Or if he can do any thynge, crie vpon him as dyd the prieſtes of the olde Idolatours that he wyll do ſo much as put one horne out of his ſhel &amp; box wherin he is encloſed; to aſſray his enemies, or els

Or if you dare make a profe of his power: leaue hym without but one night out of his box, and you ſhal ſee the litle miſe wyll not be much afrayed of hym, neither do the cattes, backes, owles, ſwallowes, and ſparowes greatly feare hym. Then tel me I praye you, why man ſhoulde be ſo mad as to ſtande in feare of the thynge whiche is of no reputation.

Be you aſhamed therfore, al you that worſhippe him, for if by the negligence of the prieſtes he fall to the grounde: he can not aryſe alone, neither if he be rayſed can he ſtande.

That he was verie man as one of you are, ſynne onely excepted, conuerſant vpon the earth in all humilitie, care and miſerie at my cōmaundemēt. wherby for his obedience toward me, he deſerued to be▪ crowned wyth a crown of glorie, wherfore I (ſendynge the holye goſt vnto you at his deſyre whyche may teach you how you are become my chyldren by hym) dyd take him vnto my ſelfe and raiſed him aboue al the heauēs, euen to ſitte at my ryght hand for euer, Wher you ſhal ſeke him if you intende to find hime But He that wyll finde Chriſte muſte ſeke hym at the right hande of the father. neither here nor ther in ani corner of the earth He tolde you that he muſt departe from you. And if you loke for my fauoure: you muſte not compt him a liar.
               But wylt thou ſeke my ſonne? Lo, he hath offered one offerynge for ſinne, and ſytteth for euer at the ryght hande of me hys father, lokynge for that whiche remayneth. That is that hys enemies be made his fote ſtole. And thus doeth my ſpirite witnes vnto you: that in this my newe teſtamēt (eſtabliſhed in hys death) your ſinnes ſhoulde be done awaye

ſo that I woulde no more remembre them.
               Then if you beleue them to be forgyuen how can you offer for them any more: It is a manifeſt token therfore that all you which wilbe ſtyll ſacrificeynge for your ſynnes: do not beleue that they beforgeuē by the death of my ſonne Chriſte.

For he was then commynge vnto me his father for your profyte, And therfore byddeth he you do this thynge in the remēbraunce of hym, wyll you then know what it is to do the worke that he commaundeth you: or to worke the meate that ne

If you wil knowe this worcke, reade in the. vi. of Iohn wher you ſhal learne that the worke of God is to belieue in hym whome he hath ſent. This is al that you can geue me. This is all that I require at your handes. I geue you therfore the breade of life, if you can receiue it by faieth vnfainedlie. That is to ſay truſteinge to my promiſe onely in the death of my ſonne, and to none other creature. Yea my ſonne is this breade of lyfe, and he that cometh vnto hym, ſhall not be hongry, he that beleueth in hym, ſhal not be thirſty. And thys he tolde you was my wyll and pleaſure, that who ſo euer doeth ſee him and beliue in hym: hath euerlaſteynge, lyfe. For thys is the lyfe euerlaſteynge to knowe me, and to knowe my ſonne whome I haue ſent Ieſu Chriſte.
               By thys knoweledg do the Angelles and bleſſed ſpirites lyue, reioyce and take their The lyfe that is in all bleſſed ſpirits is the knoweledge of chriſt comfort. Thys is the heauenlye fode. Thys is the Manna that comethe frome heauen.

               Thys is the breade then that comethe from heauen wherof who ſo eateth ſhal not periſhe, but lyue for euer.

No to them that this ſlenderly and vilely eſteme the hilpeinge and ſaueing that I haue geuen him: he is the ſauour of death vnto death and the ſtumblynge ſtone. But vnto them that wholely and onely do cleaue vnto him feadeinge

               Thys dyd my ſonne beate in theyr eares. But he neuer tolde them of any ſuch chaunges of bread into his fleſh, &amp; ſuch carnall conſecracions Chriſt neuer preached trāſ ſubſtāciaciō. as you do teach: wherin you wyll haue that (without any profite) my ſon chriſt ſhold come downe frō my boſome into your breade and Chalice blowen and bleſſed by your inuencion: and worke ſo great a miracle without eyther neceſſitie or profite.

Here in heauen you are ſure to haue him your aduocate. In the bread, you haue no ſuch promiſe. With what fayeth then can you ſeke him ther. He promiſed you that he woulde ſende the holie goſt after his going frō you: but he neuer taught that he was profitable to be chaunged into breade.

The Lord ſhall deride and ſkorn them. Then ſhall he ſpeake to them in hys angre, and in his wrath ſhal he ouer whelme them. This is the worke of the Lord, and the neceſſitie ineuitable.

God, with ſuch lewde oppreſſion and diriſion. As for vs, we do (accordinge to the ſcriptures) confeſſe this ſame neceſſitie, and gyue God our merciful father moſt hertie thāks that he hath ſo wyſelie and inyghtilye eſtabliſhed his workes, that no man or any other creature can change any one of them, No not ſo much as to make one heare white or blake
               For this cauſe do we ſinge in our hertes and gyue thankes vnto God for all his workes, For all the workes of the Lorde are excedynge good and conuenient in theyr due ſeaſone. Man ought not to aſke what is this or what is that for at tyme conuenient they ſhal be founde all perfecte. The workes of all

fleſh are before hymrand ther is nothynge hyd from hys eien. He ſeeth from euerlaſteinge vnto euerlaſteinge, and ther is nothing to wonderful to him, Ther is no euil done in the citie but he turneth it to his glorie. The Rom. iii. vnrightuouſenes of vs doeth commend hys iuſtyce.
               Than may not man ſaye, what is this or that? For vnto the good, all thinges are turned into good. And all the▪ wayes of the Lorde are playn and ſtrayte vnto the Iuſte: but the vngodly ſtumble at them.
               For the good: good thinges are created euen frome the beginninge, and euyl things for the vngodly. All thinges neceſſarie for manues lyfe were created frome the begynninge, water, fyre, Iron, ſalt, wyne, oyle, and clotheinge. All theſe thinges are created, to To the god all thinges are good and to the wicked contrarie. the faythfull, to the beſt: but to the vngodly all theſe thinges are created for vengeaunce and in theyr rigorouſeneſſe haue they faſtened theyr tormentes▪ In the tyme of the ende they ſhall poure out theyr ſtrength, and pacifie the wrathe of him that made them. Fire death, honger, hayle, oppreſſion, ſtrife, ſwerd and bloude ſhedeynge, noyſome beaſtes ſcorpions and ſerpentes: are created for the wicked. And thoughe all fleſh be troubled with ſuch lyke miſeries: yet vij. folde are they poured

forth vpon the vngodlye. And they ſhalbe all found redie to fulfill the commaundementes of theyr Lorde vpon the earth, and whē theyr houre &amp; meaſure is appointed: they ſhall not ouer paſſe his cōmaundementes
               Thus may al men (cōſidering the works of God) Iudge without wauerynge, that all his workes are perfect, firme, ſtable▪ and vnchaungeable, and he worketh euerie one in due ſeaſone, and when nede is.

               ABout the word ſacramēt,. I intēde not long to trifle. But to take your owne wordes and ſomthinge to examine them. You do bring in an argument of your aduerſaries, made by the ſtronge places of reaſoning called. Definitiorei, in engliſh the definition of the thing, that is (to them that vnderſtand not theſe termes) grounded vpon the oracion or ſentence that declareth what the thinge is.

               A ſacrament therfore, is (as well by the definition that your doctours haue made, as that you your ſelfe do make) a viſible ſigne of an inuiſible grace. Vpon this definition foloweth a double argument. Firſt, becauſe it is a ſigne: it is not the thinge ſigned or tokened.

You tell vs, that the ſigne token or ſhadowe: is the thinge it ſelfe. Shal we beleue you ſtill?
               Naye, your definition telleth vs of two things to be in this ſacramēt. That is to ſay, Two things are to be conſidered in aſacrament. A viſible ſigne, and an inuiſible grace. What other thinge (I praye you without contencion) can thys viſible ſygne be, but the breade whyche Chriſt taketh in hand and breaketh? For other viſible thynge ther is▪ none.
               That is to ſaye in playne englyſhe (that all men maye knowe what we ſpeake and wryte) ther is none other thing

grace, that can not be ſene. That is to ſay of the forgeueneſſe of ſynnes in thys bloude of the newe teſtament of Chriſte oure ſauiour.
               Thus frame I therfore the ſecounde reaſone. A thynge viſible and inuiſible can not be boeth one, to be ſenne and not ſene. But One thynge can not be boeth viſible and inuiſible this ſacrament (as you haue cōfeſſed in your definicion) is a thynge viſible and maye be ſene: therfore can it not be the thynge inuiſible, therby repreſented. Al that you haue ſpoken in thys cauſe (byſhoup Stephane) is of your owne heade, wythout either ſcripture or reaſone.

               But becauſe you can proue no chaunge: Nothing like Exod. iiii. your ſimilitude of the rodde of Moyſes (which was turned into a ſerpent &amp; ſtrenght waye retorned to a rod agayne) is not lyke. For the ſame rodde was afterwarde declared (euer in the ſight of Pharao and al the Egiptians) to be the aduengeing rod of God wherby al the waters of Egipt were turned into bloude, and all the wonderfull plages wroughte, whiche are terrible vnto vs, vnto thys day. Worthely therfore, was this called a rodde, for it was the chaſteſyng rodde of God, and alwayes returned into a rodde agayne, ſo often as Moyſes or Aaron dyd take it in their handes.

Notwithſtandinge here is a iuſt occaſiō offered (as ther hath ben many times) where Gregorie Nazianzeue, calleth faſteynge Gregorie Nazianzene, for faſteynge (in Chriſte) a bulworke and defence againſt tētaciō. As though chriſt which could not ſinne neaded any ſuch bulworke. And yet ſo far as we know, he was tempted when he

was faſteynge. The ſame Gregorie, calleth faſteyngein vs apurgacion or cleanſeynge. What ſhould we cōtēde about this mattier? Lyke as it pleaſed God to gyue powre vnto Moyſes to faſt. xl. dayes twyſe in the mountayne, not for the a voydeinge of tentacion: but for to ſet forthe the gloriouſe lawe and wyll of the father, then to be publiſhed. And Elias beynge ſent to anoynte a Kynge ouer Siria, &amp; a Kynge and a prophet ouer Iſraell, by whō boeth thefe kingdōes ſhouldbe cleane tered &amp; chaunged, did faſte fortie dayes from all maner meate, for the declareinge of the powre of God in his workes.

               Thus are we playnely taughte howe perilouſe a thinge it is, to folowe the doctrines of men, be they neuer ſo highly aduaunced wyth titles of holyneſſe. Yea we are by the mouth of God admoniſhed aboue all thynges to beware of them that promiſe peace &amp; quietneſſe, folowinge but the ſhreudneſſe of their owne hertes and foliſhe inuentions, for it is a kynde of Idolatrie, not to ſticke vnto his worde, as vnto the thynge onely ſufficient. Of ſuche prophetes therefore, as brynge their owne inuentions: doeth he ſaye. I dyd not ſende them, &amp; they ranne. I did not ſpeake vnto them, and they dyd prophecie. If they had ſtande in my counſayle and publiſhed my wordes to my people, they ſhoulde haue turned them from their wycked wayes, and from their wycked inuentions. I dyd heare howe they tolde lyes &amp; dreames in my name by the diſceites of their herte, cauſynge the people to forget my name for their dreames, (as is it come to paſſe thys daye) Therefore ſayeth the Lorde of hoſtes agaynſt ſuch prophetes.

You are the heauy burden that I can no lōger beare and therfore I wyl caſte you awaye.
               Agayne Ezechiell in the ſpirite of God, doeth thus prophecie agaynſt you that haue Ezech xxxiiij the names of ſhepeherdes and wyll not feede his flocke with his worde but feede your ſelues by your craftie inuentions and cauſe the ſhepe to go aſtraye in the wylde mountaines of your errours.

But you haue eaten the mylke, you are clothed wyth their woll, you ſley that whiche is fat and feede your ſelues and wyl not feede my flocke. You conforte not the weake, you heale not the ſicke, you bynde not

They go wanderynge in the mountaynes and are ſcattered thorowe the earth, and no man doeth ſeeke them. No man doeth ſeeke them, I ſaye. As truly as I do lyue (ſayth the Lorde God) becauſe my flocke is thus ſpoyled &amp; my ſhepe denoured, whylſe the ſhepeherdes do feede them ſelues and diſpiſe my flocke. Lo, I my ſelfe wyll require my flocke at the handes of theſe ſhepeherdes, and they ſhal neither feede my flocke nor yet them ſelues any lōger. For I wil deliuer my flocke out of their mouthes ſayeth the Lorde.
               Thys is the talke that God the father hath thorowout the olde teſtament agaynſte you that wyl not be cōtent to feede his flocke wyth his worde onely, without the ſowre leuen of mannes doctrine. He calleth you men fed and led with the winde of errours, Idole ſhepeherdes, yea deuouring wolfes that wyl neuer be ſaciate.
               Seinge then, that boeth the ſcriptures and your owne lyues do teſtifie of you, that you are ſuch rotten trees or rather poyſoned ſtockes: what fruites of heauenly doctrine

ſhall we loke to ſpringe from you? Do men gather grapes of thornes, or figges of thyſtles? The yuyl tree cābring no good fruite. Chriſte therefore (in the newe teſtament, and in his firſte ſermon) gyueth vs warnyng of ſuche Idole ſhepeherdes, ſayinge. Beware of Math. vii. theſe falſe prophetes whiche come to you in ſhepes clothynge, for inwardly they are rauenyng wolfes.
               And after that he had rebuked them that Math. xvi. would ſeme to know al thynges, &amp; yet could not ſee the tyme of their viſitation, callynge them Hypocrites, wicked nation &amp; aduoulterouſe generation that coulde not marcke or ponder the ſigne of Ionas the Prophete: ſtreightwaye he admoniſhed his to take hede not of the leuen of breade, but of the ſeuen of the doctrine of the ſcribes and phariſeis. Neither dyd he at any time rebuke ſo ſharply, as when he dyd ſpeake of theſe blynde ſhepeherdes, &amp; their doctours ſhewing how theido Marke. vii. teach the traditous of mē to put the preceptes of God out of place, &amp; that all their doctrine maketh for their corban and lucre, &amp; that thei do all thynges to be ſene of men. Thus do you alſo, folowynge the trade of your fathers. Math. vi. Math. xxiii. For couetiſe, worldly pompe and hypocriſie: do eſtabliſhe all the workes and doctrines of men that you do cal ſo neceſſarie.

               As for thynges indifferent, you muſte ſay as Paul ſayed vpon this your owne exēple. If any mā be cōtentiouſe: the church of God knoweth no ſuche cuſtome. So that rather

then any ſuche bitter contention as is nowe adayes, ſhoulde continue it were better that all your in uentions were refuſed. For ſeinge that your authoritie is gyuē to edifie by loue and charitie: you maye not abuſe it and deſtrye by bitter braulynge and cruell contention, for ſuche thynges as were not good before you named them ſo, nor yuyl before you did forbid them.
               Thus do I take many of your doctrines of men to be indifferent. As to ſtande vp at the Goſpell, to praye or preach bare headed, to eate fiſhe this daye or that daye. All theſe thynges being indifferent in their kinde, that Superſtition maketh all thinges euyll is to ſaye, nothinge yuyll being voyed of ſuperſtition: are by ſuperſtition made yuyll. For that chaungeth good into yuyll. Yet are the beſte of theſe doctrines but vayne worſhippe Iohn. iiii. of God, euen in their beſt vſe. For his worſhip ſtandeth in ſpirite and trueth.
               But you haue other doctrines and that verie manie, that are manifeſtly yuyll, becauſe you do therein adulterate the worde of God as dyd the phariſeis when they added their gloſes to the cōmaundementes of God. As when God ſayed. Thou ſhalte loue thy neighboure: they added, hate thyne enemie. God ſayed. Thou ſhalte not ſwere, but they added vnto the precepte. Paye vnto the Lorde

the thynge that thou ſweareſt. Agayne, dyd not the olde phariſies wyth their ſowre leuē, Math. vi. (whiche is Hypocriſie) make vnpleaſante and vnſauerie the two ſpeciall workes of the newe man, Faſtynge and prayer. Dyd not Chriſte hym ſelfe continually rebuke them, Math. xv. becauſe thei brake the commaundementes of God for their owne traditions &amp; doctrines? where God the father had giuen commaunmente to honoure father and mother: they cryed for their gayne, their corban and offerynges.

So that all the bloude of the iuſte whiche was and ſhall be ſhed vpon the earth from Abell to the worldes ende: maye be heaped vpon the Hypocrites in the daye of aduengeaunce, when they ſhall be adiudged to the fyre and tormentes prepared for the Deuyll and his Angelles.
               If any man do not fully perceiue by this we haue ſpoken, that the olde Phariſeis and ours be not all one in their doctrines, their Hypocriſie and cruell tiraunie: I deſire him to conſidre the mattier depely, and to cōpare ſubſtantially, the olde and newe thinges togither. Concerning the holie wordes of our Math. v. maiſter Chriſt, and moſt depe opening of the lawe of God his father, corrupted by the gloſes of the olde Phariſeis: our newe Phariſeis haue founde out a newe doctrine. They ſaye that Chriſtes wordes are counſayles and no preceptes. And therof haue they foūded and grounded opera ſupererogationis. Workes that they maye diſtribute for money. For faſting Math. vi. &amp; praying (whiche are the newe wynes that wyl breake the olde veſſels) he that hath eyes may ſee that the olde phariſeis were not ſo yuyll as are the newe, who haue added more to the wickednes of their prediceſſours.

Truely, the prieſtes of the olde lawe were manye becauſe death dyd take them awaye. But Chriſt becauſe he remayneth for euer, hath an euerlaſtinge prieſthode. And becauſe theyr prieſthode was vnperfect, therfore was Chriſt appoynted to be a prieſt after the order of Melchiſedech, without any ſuche ſucceſſiō of other prieſtes, to folow in his ſteade and therfore ſayed the prophete. Thou art a prieſte for euermore, after the order of Melchiſedeche.
               The lawe of Moyſes made men prieſtes but the worde of the oth whiche was aboue the lawe, did ordein the ſonne a prieſte, made perfect for euermore. He made this preſthode perfect and fulfilled all his ſacrifices at once when he offered him ſelfe.
               Thus do we perceiue it to be a lyeynge powre that biſhopes do chalenge in makyng theyr prieſtes.
               To take a prieſt therfore (as you do) for Learne to knowe a true prieſte. a ſacrifier for ſynne is iniuriouſe vnto Chriſt and we knowe none ſuch in the newe teſtament, for that preſthode muſt neades ende with the lawe of ſacrifice. But to take a prieſt as Malachie doeth the lyppes of the prieſte ſhall kepe knoweledge, and they require the lawe at his mouthe, for he is the angell and miniſter of the Lorde of hoſtes. Here fynde

we a better marke then the beaſtes marke or the fleſhe marke: that is to ſaye, knowledge, whereby onely he doeth the meſſage of his Lorde and maiſter, and inſtructeth his ſhepe in the lawe of God. By this marke are true prieſtes tried and knowne.
               Wherefore ſayeth God by his prophete Oſee. Becauſe thou haſt refuſed knowledge Oſee. iiii. I wyll put the backe that thou ſhalte be no prieſt before me. This knowledge is the anointing of the ſpirite, without the whiche The anoynting of the ſpirite. the bodily anoyntinge is playne deriſion of the ſpirite and hypocriſie, and without this, the ſyde gowne and wyde ſkyrtes, ſerue to nothinge but to make them to be magnified before men. Suche therefore as haue the anointinge of the ſpirite, maye you biſhoppes anoynt if you pleaſe, and appoint to be miniſters of Chriſtes flocke, to diſtribute his worde and ſacramentes.
               Nowe maye we marke by thys we haue heard: whether we may ſty

learnyng or knowledge to be the meſſengers of the Lorde, but Idlenes, whoredome and Idolatry, to be the mēbres of Sathā, folowing holines in outwarde ſhewe only of your ceremonies, killinge &amp; ſleaing the true prieſtes, preachers and meſſengers whiche are the angels of God. Theſe knowinge the ſtewardſhip appointed vnto thē: feare the wo &amp; euerlaſting dānation hanging ouer their heades, if thei do not preach the meſſage of their maiſter: But (I am righte ſure) you thinke me ouerlonge in this mattier.
               Let vs go farther with your farthinges therfore. What maketh a biſhop? An whole heape of ceremonies (you ſay) whiche cōſidered ſeuerally alone, are nothynge. What is a broade crowme, as brode as. x. prieſtes crownes: doeth not this make a biſhop? No this is nothynge. Doeth a miter make a biſhop. No ſurely. Do the gliſtering gloues make a biſhop? No, they are nothinge. What do al the lordly poſſeſſiōs, &amp; the lōge traine folowing? Ah now we ſteare, for theſe thinges are ſomwhat. Thei make you lords, but not biſhops What maketh you biſhops then? for we can ſee nothinge in you but this geare &amp; ſuch like Wherefore, you make vs beleue that you be like biſhops as the other be prieſtes, That is to ſaye, cōterfaite, patchinge together of the

cloutes of ceremonies, &amp; thinges of noughte (if you were waighed in the ballāce of equite) leſſe thē farthinges, yea lighter thē nothinge.
               But Paule ſetteth furth other maner of farthinges, where he deſcribeth a biſhoppe. The biſhop (ſayeth he) muſte be fautles, the huſbande of one wife, watchfull, ſobre, milde harberouſe, apt to teache, no drunckarde, no fighter, not deſirouſe of filthy gayne, but vprighte, flyinge ſtryfe, flyinge couetouſneſſe, that ruleth his owne houſe well, whyche hath his chyldren in ſubiection wyth al reuerence. Lo, here be farthinges of great waight and value, euen whē they be cōſidered euery one alone by hym ſelfe. Theſe are the good farthynges therefore, that make the good biſhoppes, and the other are the nothinges that make the Idol biſhops, thinges of no value. All the firſt farthinges maye well be wyped awaye &amp; the man neuer the worſſe: but wype awaye theſe farthynges that Paule nameth, and you can haue no good biſhop.
               Nowe for the ſubſtaunce of oure religion which as you ſay ſtādeth in theſe farthinges of your popiſhe ceremonies: if you do meane of the popes religion, we do graunte it onely and wholy to ſtande in ceremonies and ſhadowes, as your prieſthode doeth. And if may well ynough be wyped awaye as nothynge.

Your mumbling in a tonge not vnderſtande (whiche you call your prayer) is nothinge. Your croſſing, bleſſyng and wagging of fingers, is nothing. Your creeping to the croſſe is nothyng: yea it is an euyl thyng. Your halowyng and caryinge of candles, is nothing. Your kneelyng, knockyng, and holdynge vp of handes to thys, whiche we haue proued to be breade, is nothynge, if an Idole maye be nothinge, or Idolatrie nothinge. Your ſuper ſtitious coniurynge of the good creatures of God, to dryue awaye diuylles and diſaſes, whiche you call the makynge of holy water, Holy water, is notynge. Your caſting of the ſame aboute your beds, is nothinge. No, your ſuperſtitiō of creatures in your choſē faſtes, is nothing. Yea all that euer the Pope hath bylt (whiche you biſhops do maynteyne) is nothinge, yea leſſe then nothing, the ſhadowes of nothing, and the vayne dreames of nothynge. Thus is your popiſhe religion nothynge, &amp; worſſe then nothynge, and ſhall come to nothynge, euen as your abbayes haue done, which had their foundations of ſo many nothinges, and by their nothinge had heaped together all thynges, ryches, landes and tenementes.
               But learne, O biſhop, I pray you, that all your nothynges are not regarded before God. But this is euerlaſting lyfe, to knowe

God, and whō he hath ſent Ieſu Chriſt, that the knowledge of god may make the chriſtē man, lyke as it maketh the good prieſt &amp; true biſhop. And thys is alwayes ſomthynge (diuide it as ſmall as yo
                     •
                   can) cōtinually miniſtred by our heade Chriſt, accordynge to the capacitie of euery mēbre. Thys knowledge of god bringeth furth loue, peace, rightuouſnes and ioye in the holy goſte, whiche is the ſubſtaunce of the chriſtian religion, as Paul ſayeth. The kyngdome of God (ſayeth he) is not meate and drinke: but ryghtuouſneſſe, peace, and ioye in the holy goſte.
               Biſhop Stephane, you talke fondly in reporting vs to bid men eate al the day longe, and other thinges that folowe. Your popiſhe doctrine is, that men may drynke al the daye longe, ſo they eate but once in the daye, howe muche they eate then it forceth not, nor howe deinteth meate, ſo it be not fleſhe. Fyue diſhes of fiſhe, for one of fleſh, breaketh no faſt at al, mary it is to be thoughte, that the multitude The perfec

                      on of the biſhops faſte. of diſhes is the perfectiō of your faſte as appeare
                     •
                  h in your ſeruice on fiſhe daies (as you 
                     •
                  al them) &amp; that euē in your moſt holy houſes &amp; coleges. Yea the ſcholars in your coleges are allowed as muche to their diners on the faſting dayes as they haue to diner &amp; ſupper both on other dayes. But if a mā eate a piece

of biefe or bakon, an hen or a capon: Oh abominable hereſie, treaſon and lowlardy. He is worſſe then a Iewe or a Turke.
               Agayne, where you cal the hearing of the Goſpell preached (whiche oughte to be the chiefe cauſe of our aſſēble) the falſe teachyng of the Deuil: you declare of what ſpirite you be. You neuer hearde man diſprayſe prayer, onleſſe it were popiſhe prayer, which is lippe labour that no man taketh profite by.
               But lo thus are you led by your phantaſticall farthynges, frō one triſtle to an other, frō one creature to an other. You lynke together your wyckedneſſe as it were wyth a chaine and draw together your wretchednes as it were wyth a cable, tyl ſuch tyme as you come to the greateſt abomination (as you ſay) by degrees. Your phanell is nothynge, your albe is nothing, your ſtole is nothyng, your gyrdle is nothynge, your veſtiment is nothynge, your blowyng is nothynge, your bleſſyng is nothynge, your croſſyng and kykyſſyng is nothynge. But the holdyng vp of your Idol to be worſhypped, is ſomethinge. For, the ſet vp any creature to be worſhypped as God, is abomination, and abominable Idolatrie.
               Thus by degrees come you to the highe miſterie of wickednes. And thys cauſeth you

that you can not be cōtented with the ſtate of byſhops, but you wyll be Lordes, yea aboue lordes &amp; princes, as you do both preache and wryte, becauſe you can make that which neither kynge nor angel can make, that is to ſay Chriſt God and man. You are the chyldrē of thys worlde and therfore the worlde can not hate you. And therfore haue you ben ſo craftie to creepe in by litle and litle &amp; to make vp the great heape of your baggage, which you cal the ſubſtaunce of your religion. And therfore do you nowe fyght wyth fyre &amp; faggot, for the conſeruation of the ſame, that it maye conſerue you in your lordly dignities.
               Thus hath your worldly witted fathers euen from the begynnynge fought wyth the ſayntes of God, whoſe bloud cryeth frō vnder the aultare and aſketh vengeaunce, &amp; ſhal be hearde ryght ſpedily.
               Marke (good biſhops) whom▪ you haue alwaye murthered euen frō the begynnyng. Whiche of the Prophetes of the olde teſtament, did eſcape chiefe prieſtes and byſhops?
               And ſyth the comyng of Chriſt: your murthers are innumerable. I wyll not, nor cā not recken them. Dyd not Chriſte hym ſelfe dye by the conſpiracie of Annas, Cayphas and other biſhops, becauſe he rebuked the worlde of blyndenes? Al ſuch as you haue murtherd

ſence that tyme: haue cleare teſtimonies of theyr innocencie, by ſome of your owne ſcribes and wryters. Had not Huſſe (whō yon Huſſe. accompt the Arche heretike) foure ſeales of the noble men of Morania, to wytneſſe his innocent lyfe and godly learnynge to your curſed &amp; cruel counſayle at cōſtaunce. Doeth not Pope Piꝰ, otherwyſe called Eneas Silnius, Pogius the Florentyne, Platina Sabellicus and other your owne men, reporte well of hym?
               But to come home, boeth to your owne tyme &amp; countrey. Who doth not bewaile the tiranny that you ſhewed vnto that innocent lambe Bylnaye, who (beinge demaunded in Bylnay. deriſion by a proude papiſt, when he went to his death, why he wroughte no miracles (beinge ſo holy as he was accompted) anſwered wyth mylde voice &amp; countenaunce. God onely (ſayed he) worketh miracles and wonders and he it is that hath wrought thys one wonder in our eyes, that I being wrongfully accuſed, falſly belyed, opprobriouſly and ſpytefully hādled, impriſoned, buffetted, and condempned to the fyre: yet hitherto haue I not once opened my mouth with one euyl worde agaynſt any of you. This paſſeth the worke of nature, &amp; is therefore the manifeſt miracle of god, who wyl by my ſuffering &amp; death, be

glorified and haue his trueth enhaunced.
               What report haue you gottē for the murthering of Hunne in the lowlars towre? You Hunne. had neither felonie nor treaſon to laye to his charge: yet moſt vilanouſly dyd the chauncelour of London murther that honeſt man for his owne childes criſome. I wyl ſay nothing of the prieſt that was found hanging in your porters warde. And fiue hundreth mo, wherof ſome haue by your tirannouſe handlyng, for ſworne the truth &amp; forſakē theyr maiſters.
               Some for feare of your tirāny haue renne out of their wittes, ſome haue forſaken their coūtreis, choſyng rather to

But this was their death (ſo far as I could learne) becauſe they preached man to be iuſtified by fayth in the bloud of Chriſt onely, &amp; by none of your popiſhe inuentions.

Howe many dyd you then murther, &amp; woulde haue done mo, had not the Kinge by his power plucked out of your clawes, one whom you had with ſmall equitie examined, and wyth leſſe iuſtice cōdemned? What iuſtice did you ſhewe in that you dyd ſo ſhamefully racke Anne Aſkue after ſhe was condemned? But Anne Aſkue. ſhe ſhewinge more conſtancie then hath bene communely ſeene in a woman: ſhal nowe after the death of hir body, worke you ſhame to all your poſteritie?
               Was Laſſels wyth the other his felowes Iohn Laſſels martyrs (cōfeſſinge the liuinge God and his ſonne Chriſt the only ſauiour) worthily burned with fire, &amp; (as you did raſhly determine and iudge) condemned and deſtroied in body and ſoule?
               What were they? whoremongers, Idolatours, adulterers, theues, extorſiouers, or mā
                  quellers? Vpon ſuche cometh the wrath of God, &amp; ſuche haue no parte in the kingdome of God. But you ſuffre to lyue &amp; you ſhewe

no power agaynſt them. No you are not any thynge terrible vnto ſuche: for they dwell at your noſes, they eate at your tables, and are The biſhops darlinges. your darlinges. But who that ſpeaketh any thinge agaynſte your popiſhe Idols &amp; brainſicke inuentions (haue he neuer ſo faythful an hert to God, and be he neuer ſo truſtie to his prince) yet muſt he be an heretike, a traytour a lowlar and all together.
               This doeth the worlde eſpie at the length &amp; talketh of you. I woulde this talke mighte make you leaue your euyll doinges: and to learne at the leaſt to do ſome parte of your dutie before the wrath of God fal vpon you. But I do feare me al wordes are but wynde with you. Onely vexation and chaſtiſement wyll giue you vnderſtandinge. For lo, here you ſaye ful finely and like a popiſhe prelate that woulde haue all thinge broughte to the olde blyndenes and ignoraunce, and to ſuche captiuitie, and bondage that no man ſhoulde talke of his fayeth but vnder my Lordes licence, though Peter commaunded the contrary.

               And becauſe you biſhops are ſo ſlowe in preaching good workes that God requireth: the people muſte needes be ſtacke in doinge them. For you ſhould be the ſalt of the earth. The ſalt is

You preach your owne inuentions, the preceptes and cōmaundementes of men, and them muſt we needes knowe and confeſſe, or els muſt we be brent. But it is a daungerous thynge to knowe the ſcriptures (and eſpecially for pore men) and

to talke of oure fayeth. Thys doctrine of yours ſpoyleth vs of fayeth, and bringeth vs into the Idlenes of workes. Oh diueliſhe ſophiſtrie, and the ſpirituall ſubtiltie, ſtryuing agaynſt all godlines.
               Sathan him ſelfe coulde not diuiſe ſuche a reaſon to hinder our fayth and ſtop knowledge. The Popes biſhops only could do it.

And a litle after, he calleth this the eatinge of the breade of life, the eatinge of hym ſelfe, and his fleſhe, ſaynge. I am the liuinge breade that came downe from heauen, if any man eate of this breade, he ſhal loue for euer. And the breade whiche I ſhall gyue is my fleſhe, whiche I ſhall giue for the life of the world. He that eateth my fleſhe and drinketh my bloude, hath euerlaſting life. And he that

eateth my fleſhe and drinketh my bloude, abideth in me and I in him. Then anſwereth he to the blynde Caparnaites, that woulde eate him really and bodilie, as the meate of their bodies. My wordes are ſpirite &amp; life, the fleſhe profiteth nothinge. Wherefore I ſaied vnto you, that no man can come vnto me, except it be giuen him of my father. And this power giuen of the father to receiue Chriſte: is taughte in the firſte of Iohn. He came into his owne (ſayeth Iohn) and his owne did not receiue him. But ſo many as did receiue him, he graunted them to be made the children of God.

So manie as receiue him, he graunted thē to be made the children of God (that is to ſaye) ſo manie as beleue in his name. Marke home diligentlie Iohn declareth him ſelfe of the receiuinge of Chriſte by fayth And further Which are not borne of bloude, neither by the wil of the fleſhe, nor by the wyll of man, but are borne of God, as 1. Pet. i. Peter ſayeth. Borne againe, not of mortall ſeede, but by the worde of the lyuinge God. i. Pet. ii.
               
               This is the milke not of the bodie (ſaieth Peter) but it is the meate and milke of the ſoule, that knoweth no gile.
               Thus renneth all the ſcripture, by metaphors and borowed ſpeache from bodilie meate to ſpirituall meate, from the bodilie teeth and eatinge, to the ſpirituall eatinge by the ſoule, whiche can be done by faith onely. So that he whiche is not borne from aboue of the ſpirite: can neither ſee the kingdome of God, nor come vnto Chriſte, let him eate the breade (wherein you ſaye is really the fleſhe) ſo longe as you luſte. For this muſte needes be true. That whiche is borne of the fleſhe, is

fleſhe, and that whiche is borne of the ſpirite, is ſpirite.
               Euen like as Moyſes ſet vp the ſerpent in the wilderneſſe, that ſo many as woulde come vnto it mighte be ſaued from the firie ſerpentes: ſo likewiſe was the ſonne of man exalted that al that do beleue in him ſhoulde not periſhe, but haue euerlaſting life.
               Againe. So hath God loued the worlde, that he hath giuen his onely ſonne, that who ſo beleueth in him, ſhall not periſhe, but haue life euerlaſtinge.
               Againe. He that beleueth in him ſhall not be condemned. And he that beleueth not in him is condemned all readie, becauſe he beleued not in the name of the onely begotten ſonne of God.
               Thus may we ſee that fayth (and not ea

Chriſt amonge the heauenly ſpirites. And to ſhewe furth in the worlde to come, the paſſing richeſſe of his grace, in his godneſſe towardes vs by Chriſte Ieſu.
               We beleue in the onely begotten ſonne, whiche was made man to ſaue the worlde▪ wherefore we can not be condemned, though we do ſeeke none other ſtraunge beliefe of really preſent and bodiſie eaten to feede the bodies, whiche thinges are not taught in the ſcriptures.
               You do not beleue in the onely begotten ſonne made man, but made breade to take awaye ſinnes: wherfore vnleſſe you do repent, your dānatiō is at hande, becauſe you beleue not in the name of the onely begotten ſonne of God, whiche is the onely begotten ſonne, as he is man, cōceiued by the holie goſte and borne of the virgin Mary, not as he is bread blowen with your ſtinkinge breathes. Neither is he the onely begottē ſonne of God, as he is wine whiſpered into your chalice.
               Howe do you beleue in this name (the only begotten ſonne of God) whē the ſcriptur

teacheth you that there is none other name vnder heauen, wherby men ſhould be ſaued, and yon do ſaye that there is an other thinge (whiche ſome name the Maſſe, and ſome the ſacrament of the aultare) that ſaueth from ſinnes, and is a ſacrifice boeth for the quicke and the deade, and (as your man Damaſcen wryteth) it purgeth all diſeaſes and incommodities.
               Furthermore. We do beleue, that Ieſu Chriſte is the Chriſt that is the anoynted of God to offre the ſacrifice wherewyth onely, the father coulde be pleaſed, and therefore are we borne of God.
               You do ſay, that you are the Chriſtes and anointed prieſtes to offer ſtyll for the ſinnes of the people. Who is your father but he that woulde darken the ſacrifice of the onely begotten ſonne of God and ſit in the temple of God, boaſting him ſelfe for God, being in deede the aduerſarie and is lifted vp agaynſt euerie thinge that is God or godly, the wycked man, the curſed childe.
               Againe. God the father ſayed, this is my dearly beſoued ſonne, in whō I am pleaſed and pacified, heare you him.
               We beleue this worde, and wyll ſeeke no further, but to thys onely begotten &amp; dearly beloued ſonne of God. Neither to pacifie the

wrath of God for oure treſpaſſes: nor yet to ſeeke any other teacher of his wyll, then the ſonne of God, whom we are commaunded to heare.
               You wyll ſette vp the Maſſe your owne worke to pacifie the father for the ſinnes of the quicke &amp; the deade. You wyll haue your owne doctours to deſcant newe gloſes, and theſe muſt the pore flocke of Chriſt heare, beleue and confeſſe, or els they ſhall be brent.
               But to heare Chriſte, the onely begotten ſonne of god, ſpeake in the ſcriptures: is poyſon to al men vnder the degree of gentlemen, and puniſhable by your lawes, as in the caſes of hereſie.
               What call you this, but to make the onely begotten ſonne of God an hereticke? Call you thys the beleuynge in his name? Thus maye we proue that you beleue in the Popes name, whoſe lawes and wrytynges are reſerued of certeyue men for certeyue purpoſes and are as muche practiſed and more ſtoutely defended then any thynge that Chriſt cō
                  maundeth.
               Yea, howe can we thinke but that you beleue more in the Pope, when you defende his Actes more ſtyfly, then the lawes of the lyuynge God?
