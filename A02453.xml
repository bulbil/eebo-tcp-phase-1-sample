            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  The Author.
                  
                     THe Presse hath gathered into one, what fancie had scattered in many loose papers. To write this, love stole some houres from businēsse, and my more serious study. For though Poetry may challenge if not priority, yet equality with the best Sciences, both for



antiquity and worth; I never set so high a rate upon it, as to give my selfe entirely up to its devotion. It hath too much ayre, and (if without offence to our next transmarine neighbour,) wantons too much according to the French garbe. And when it is wholly imployed in the soft straines of love, his soule who entertaines it, loseth much of that strength which should confirme him man. The nerves of judgement are weakned most by its dalliance, and when woman, (I meane onely as she is externally faire) is the supreme object of wit, we soone degenerate into effeminacy. For the religion of fancie declines into a mad superstition,



when it adores that Idoll which is not secure from age and sicknesse. Of such heathens, our times afford us a pittyed multitude, who can give no nobler testimony of twenty yeares imployment, then some loose coppies of lust happily exprest. Yet these the common people of wit blow up with their breath of praise, and honour with the Sacred name of Poets: To which as I beleeve they can never have any just claime, so shall I not dare by this essay to lay any title, since more sweate and oyle he must spend, who shall arrogate so excellent an attribute. Yet if the innocency of a chaste Muse shall bee more acceptable, and weigh heavier



in the ballance of esteeme, than a fame, begot in adultery of study; I doubt I shall leave them no hope of competition. For how unhappie soever I may be in the elocution, I am sure the Theame is worthy enough. In all those flames in which I burnt, I never felt a wanton heate, nor was my invention ever sinister from the straite way of chastity. And when love builds upon that rocke, it may safely contemne the battery of the waves, and threatnings of the wind. Since time, that makes a mockery of the firmest structures shall it selfe be 
                        •
                     umated, before that be demolisht. Thus was the foundation layd. And though my eye in its survey,



was satisfied, even to curiosity, yet did not my search rest there. The Alabaster, Ivory, Porphir, Iet, that lent an admirable beauty to the outward building, entertained me with but a halfe pleasure, since they stood there onely to make sport for ruine. But when my soule grew acquainted with the owner of that mansion; I sound that Oratory was dombe when it began to speake her, and wonder (which must necessarily seize the best at that time) a lethargie, that dulled too much the faculties of the minde, onely fit to busie themselves in discoursing her perfections, Wisdome, I encounter'd there, that could not spend it selfe



since it affected silence, attentive onely to instructions, as if all her sences had beene contracted into hearing: Innocencie, so not vitiated by conversation with the world, that the subtile witted of her sex, would have tearm'd it ignorance: Wit, which seated it selfe most in the apprehension, and if not inforc't by good manners, would scarce have gain'd the name of affability. Modesty, so timorous, that it represented a besieg'd Citty, standing watchfully upon her guard, strongest in the loyalty to her Prince. In a word, all those vertues which should restore woman to her primitive state of



beauty, fully adorn'd her. But I shall be censur'd, in labouring to come nigh the truth, guilty of an indiscreet Rhetoricke. However such I fancied her, for to say shee is, or was such, were to play the Merchant, and boast too much the value of a lewell I possesse, but have no minde to part with. And though I appeare to strive against the streame of best wits, in erecti

                      once adventure to doe well, without a president. Nor if my rigid friend question superciliously the setting forth of these Poems, will I excuse my selfe (though justly perhaps I



might) that importunity prevail'd, and cleere judgements advis'd: This onely 
                        •
                      dare say, that if they are not strangled with envie of the present, they may happily live in the not dislike of future times. For then partiality ceaseth, and vertue is without the idolatry of her clients, esteemed worthy honour. Nothing new is free from detraction, and when Princes alter customes even heavie to the subject, best ordinances are interpreted innovations. Had I slept in the silence of my acquaintance, and affected no study beyond that which the chase or field allowes, Poetry had then beene no scandall upon me, and



the love of learning no suspition of ill husbandry. But what malice, begot in the Country upon ignorance, or in the City upon Criticisme, shall prepare against me, I am armed to endure. For as the face of vertue lookes faire without the adultery of Art, so fame needes no ayde from rumour to strengthen her selfe. If these lines want that courtship, (I will not say flattery) which insinuates it selfe into the favour of great men, best; they partake of my modesty: If Satyre to win applause with the envious multitude; they expresse my content, which maliceth none, the fruition of that, they esteeme happie.



And if not too indulgent to what is my owne; I thinke even these verses will have that proportion in the worlds opinion, that heaven hath allotted me in fortune; not so high, as to be wondred at, nor so low as to be contemned.

                     IS the fairest treasure, the avarice of Love can covet; and the onely white, at which he shootes his arrowes, nor while his aime is noble, can he ever hit upon repentance. She is chaste, for the devill enters the Idoll and gives the Oracle, when wantonnesse possesseth beauty, and wit maintaines it lawfull. She is as faire as Nature intended her, helpt perhaps to a more pleasing grace by the sweetnesse of education, not by the slight of Art. She is young, for a woman past the delicacie of her spring, may well move by vertue to



respect, never by beauty to affection. Shee is innocent even from the knowledge of si
                        •
                     ne, for vice is too strong to be wrastled with, and gives her frailty the foyle. She is not proude, though the amorous youth interpret her modestie to that sence; but in her vertue weares so much Majestie, lust dares not rebell, nor though masqued, under the pretence of love, capitulate with her. She entertaines not every parley offer'd, although the Articles pretended to her advantage: advice and her owne feares restraine her, and woman never owed ruine to too much caution. She glories not in the plurality of servants, a multitude of adorers heaven can onely challeng; and it is impietie in her weakenesse to desire superstition from many. She is deafe to the whispers of love, and even on the marriage houre can breake off, without the least suspition of scandall, to the former



liberty of her carriage. She avoydes a too neere conversation with man, and like the Parthian overcomes by flight. Her language is not copious but apposit, and she had rather suffer the reproach of being dull company, than have the title of Witty, with that of Bold and Wanton. In her carriage she is sober, and thinkes her youth expresseth life enough, without the giddy motion, fashion of late hath taken up. She danceth to the best applause but doates not on the vanity of it, nor licenceth an irregular meeting to vaunt the levity of her skill. She sings, but not perpetually, for she knowes, silence in woman is the most perswading oratory. She never arriv'd to so much familiarity with man as to know the demunitive of his name, and call him by it; and she can show a competent favour: without yeelding her hand to his gripe. Shee never understood the language of a kisse, but at salutation,



nor dares the Courtier use so much of his practised impudence as to offer the rape of it from her; because chastity hath write it unlawfull, and her behaviour proclaimes it unwelcome. She is never sad, and yet not jiggish; her conscience is cleere from guilt, and that secures her from sorrow. She is not passionately in love with poetry, because it softens the heart too much to love: but she likes the harmony in the Composition; and the brave examples of vertue celebrated by it, she proposeth to her imitation. She is not vaine in the history of her gay kindred

And Ile conclude, (though the next sinod of Ladies condemne this character as an heresie broacht by a Precision) that onely she who hath as great a share in vertue as in beauty, deserves a noble love to serve her, and a free Poesie to speake her.

                     To CASTARA, Being debarr'd her presence.
                     BAnisht from you, I charg'd the nimble winde,
                     My unseene Messenger, to speake my minde,
                     In am'rous whispers to you. But my Muse
                     Lest the unruly spirit should abuse
                     The trust repos'd in him, sayd it was due
                     To her alone, to sing my loves to you.
                     Heare her then speake. Bright Lady, from whose eye,
                     Shot lightning to his heart, who joyes to dye
                     A martyr in your flames: O let your love
                     Be great and firme as his: Then nought shall move
                     Your setled faiths, that both may grow together:
                     Or if by Fate divided, both may wither.
                     Harke! 'twas a groane. Ah how sad absence rends
                     His troubled thoughts! See, he from Marlow sends
                     His eyes to Seymors. Then chides th' envious trees,
                     And unkinde distance. Yet his fancie sees
                     And courts your beauty, joyes as he had cleav'd
                     Close to you, and then weepes because deceiv'd.
                     Be constant as y'are faire. For I fore-see
                     A glorious triumph waits o'th victorie
                     Your love will purchase, shewing us to prize
                     A true content. There onely Love hath eyes.

                     My prophane feete accesse, my vowes shall flye,
                     May those Musitians, which divide the ayre
                     With their harmonious breath, their flight prepare,
                     For this glad place, and all their accents frame,

                     Where may the Spring dwell still. May every tree
                     Turne to a Laurell, and propheticke be.
                     Which shall in its first Oracle divine,

                        Lest thou confesse too, melt away.

                     A dangerous warmth with too much favour brings.

                     Doth 'bout some taller tree her selfe intvvine,

His coynesse wept, while strugling yet alive:

                     A prey to wolves to the wilde powers oth' wood,
                     Oft travellers pay tribute with their blood.
                     If carelesse of thy selfe of me take care,
                     For like a ship where all the fortunes are

                     If thou should'st perish banquerout in thee.
                     My feares have mockt me. Tygers when they shall
                     Behold so bright a face, will humbly fall
                     In adoration of thee. Fierce they are
                     To the deform'd, obsequious to the faire.
                     Yet venter not; tis nobler farre to sway
                     The heart of man, than beasts, who man obey.

                     See the flowers condole, and all
                     Wither in my funerall.
                     The bright Lilly, as if day,
                     Parted with her fades away.
                     Violets hang their heads, and lose

                           Bewitch thee so to griefe?
                           Since it prevents n'insuing harmes,
                           Nor yeelds the past reliefe.

                     On th' humble fate; which censures it a crime,

                     Distracts, and they who made her, fram'd her blinde.
                     Possession makes us poore. Should we obtaine
                     All those bright jems, for which ith' wealthy Maine,
                     The tann'd slave dives; or in one boundlesse chest

                     We still should want. Our better part's immence,
                     Not like th' inferiour, limited by sence.
                     Rich with a little, mutuall love can lift
                     Vs to a greatnesse, whether chance nor thrift
                     E're rais'd her servants. For though all were spent,

                     Soft to my hope, I Love Philosopher,

                     My love is envious. Would Castara were
                     The daughter of some mountaine cottager
                     Who with his toile worne out, could dying leave
                     Her no more dowre, then what she did receive
                     From bounteous nature. Her would I then lead
                     To th' Temple, rich in her owne wealth; her head
                     Crown'd with her haires faire treasure; diamonds in
                     Her brighter eyes; soft Ermines in her skin;
                     Each Indie in each cheeke. Then all who vaunt,
                     That fortune, them t' enrich, made others want,
                     Should set themselves out glorious in her stealth,
                     And trie if that, could parallel this wealth.

                     VVHat should we feare Castara? The coole aire,

                     The pleasure I possesse. The wind conspites

                     That I by want am neither vilified,

                     Or else revenge 'gainst niggard Destinie,

                     So steept in gall? Why so obrayde the times?

                     T'Was Night: when Phoebe guided by thy rayes,
                     Chaste as my zeale, with incence of her praise,
                     I humbly crept to my Castara's shrine.
                     But oh my fond mistake! for there did shine
                     A noone of beauty, with such lustre crown'd,
                     As shewd mong th' impious onely night is found.
                     It was her eyes which like two Diamonds shin'd,
                     Brightest ith' dark. Like which could th' Indian find,
                     But one among his rocks, he would out vie
                     In brightnesse all the Diamonds of the Skie.
                     But when her lips did ope

                         the Phoenix nest

                     Hee'd loath his heauenly furfets: if we dare
                     Affirme, love hath a heaven without my faire.

                        Such is her beauty, as no arts
                        Have enricht with borrowed grace▪
                        
                        Her high birth no pride imparts,
                        For she blushes in her place.
                        Folly boasts a glorious blood,
                        She is noblest being good.
                     
                     
                        Cautious she knew never yet
                        What a wanton courtship meant:
                        
                           Not speaks loud to boast her wit,
                        In her silence eloquent.
                        Of her selfe survey she takes,
                        But 'tweene men no difference makes.
                     
                     
                        She obeyes with speedy will
                        Her grave Parents wise commands.
                        And so innocent, that ill,
                        She nor acts, nor understands.
                        Womens, feet runne still astray,
                        If once to ill they know the way.
                     
                     
                        She sailes by that rocke, the Court,
                        Where oft honour splits her mast:
                        And retir'dnesse thinks the port,
                        Where her fame may anchor cast.
                        Vertue safely cannot sit,
                        Where vice is enthron'd for wit.
                     
                     
                        She holds that dayes pleasure best,
                        Where sinne waits not on delight,
                        Without maske, or ball, or feast,
                        Sweetly spends a winters night.
                        O're that darknesse, whence is thrust,
                        Prayer and sleepe oft governs lust.
                     
                     
                        
                        She her throne makes reason climbe,
                        While wild passions captive lie.
                        And each article of time,
                        Her pure thoughts to heaven flie:
                        All her vowes religious be,
                        And her love she vowes to me.
                     
                  
                  FINIS.

                     IS the sweetest part in the harmony of our being. To the love of which, as the charmes of Nature inchant us, so the law of grace by speciall priviledge invites us. Without her, Man if piety not restraine him; is the creator of sinne; or, if an innated cold render him not onely the businesse of the present age; the murderer of posterity. She is so religious that every day crownes her a martyr, and her zeale





                     
neither rebellious nor uncivill. Shee is so true a friend, her Husband may to her communicate even his ambitions, and if successe Crowne not expectation, remaine neverthelesse uncontemn'd, Shee is colleague with him in the Empire of prosperity; and a safe retyring place when adversity exiles him from the World. Shee is so chaste, shee never understood the language lust speakes in, nor with a smile applaudes it, although there appeare wit in the Metaphore. Shee is faire onely to winne on his affections, nor would she be Mistris of the most eloquent beauty; if there were danger, that might perswade the passionate auditory, to the least irregular thought. Shee is noble by a long descent, but her memory is so evill a herald, Shee never boasts the story of her Ancestors. Shee is so moderately rich, that the defect of portion doth neither bring penury to his estate, nor the superfluity licence her to Riot. Shee is



liberall, and yet owes not ruine to vanity, but knowes Charity, to be the soule of goodnesse, and Uertue without reward often prone to bee her owne destroyer. Shee is much at home, and when shee visits 'tis for mutuall commerce, not for intelligence. Shee can goe to Court, and returne no passionate doater on bravery; and when shee hath seene the gay things muster up themselves there, shee considers them as Cobwebs the Spider vanity hath spunne. Shee is so generall in her acquaintance, that shee is familiar with all whom fame speakes vertuous; but thinkes there can bee no friendship but with one; and therefore hath neither shee friend nor private servant. Shee so squares her passion to her Husbands fortunes, that in the Countrey shee lives without a froward Melancholly, in



the towne without a fantastique pride. She is 
                        •
                     o temperate, she never read the moderne pollicie of glorious surfeits; since she finds Nature is no Epicure if art provoke her not by curiositie. Shee is inquisitive onely of new wayes to please him, and her wit sayles by no other compasse then that of his direction. Shee lookes upon him as Conjurers upon the Circle, beyond which there is nothing but Death and Hell; and in him shee beleeves Paradice circumscrib'd. His vertues are her wonder and imitation; and his errors, her credulitie thinkes no more frailtie, then makes him descend to the title of Man. In a word, shee so lives that shee may dye; and leave no cloude upon her Memory, but have her character nobly mentioned: while the bad Wife is flattered into infamy,

                     To CASTARA, Upon the mutuall love of their Majesties.
                     DId you not see, Castara, when the King
                     Met his lov'd Queene; what sweetnesse she did bring
                     T' incounter his brave heat; how great a flame
                     From their brests meeting, on the sudden came?
                     The Stoike, who all easie passion flies,
                     Could he but heare the language of their eyes,
                     As heresies would from his faith remove
                     The tenets of his sect, and practise love.
                     The barb'rous nations which supply the earth
                     With a promiscuous and ignoble birth,
                     
                        Would by this precedent correct their life,
                     Each wisely chuse, and chastely love a wife.
                     Princes example is a law. Then we
                     If loyall subjects, must true lovers be.

                     To some blest Port, where ship hath never lane
                     At anchor, whose chaste soile no foot prophane
                     Hath ever trod; Where nature doth dispence
                     Her infant wealth, a beautious innocence.

                     That none but whispring Turtles ever meet,
                     Thus Paradise did our first Parents Wooe,

                     FOrsake me not so soone. Castara stay,
                     And as I breake the prison of my Clay,
                     Ile fill the Canvas with m'expiring breath,
                     And with thee saile o're the vast maine of death.
                     
                        Some Cherubin thus as we passe shall play.
                     Goe happy twins of love: The courteous Sea
                     Shall smooth her wrinkled brow: the winds shal sleep▪
                     
                     Or onely whisper musicke to the deepe.
                     Every ungentle rocke shall melt away,
                     The Syrens sing to please, not to betray.
                     Th' indulgent skie shall smile: each starry quire

                     In which I first by marriage sacred power,
                     
                        Ioyn'd with Castara hearts: And as the same
                     Thy lustie is, as then so is our flame:
                     Which had increast, but that by loves decree,
                     'Twas such at first, it ne're could greater be.
                     But tell me (glorious Lampe) in thy survey,
                     Of things below thee, what did not decay
                     By age to weakenesse? I since that have seene
                     The Rose bud forth and fade, the tree grow greene
                     And wither, and the beauty of the field
                     With Winter wrinkled. Even thy selfe dost yeeld
                     Something to time, and to thy grave fall nigher.
                     But vertuous love is one sweet endlesse fire.
                  
                  
                     Against them who lay unchastity to the sex of Women.
                     
                        THey meet but with unwholesome Springs,
                        And Summers which infectious are:
                        They heare but when the Meremaid sings,
                        And onely see the falling starre:
                        Who ever dare,
                        Affirme no woman chaste and faire.
                     
                     
                        
                        Goe cure your feavers: and you'le say
                        The Dog-dayes scorch not all the yeare:
                        In Copper Mines no longer stay,
                        But travell to the West, and there
                        The right ones see:
                        And grant all gold's not Alchimie.
                     
                     
                        What mad man 'cause the glow-wormes flame
                        Is cold, sweares there's no warmth in fire?
                        'Cause some make forfeit of their name,
                        And slave themselves to mans desire;
                        Shall the sex free
                        From guilt, damn'd to the bondage be?
                     
                     
                        Nor grieve Castara, though 'twere fraile,
                        Thy Vertue then would brighter shine,
                        When thy example should prevaile,
                        And every womans faith be thine,
                        And were there none;
                        'Tis Majesty to rule alone.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     To the Right Honourable and excellently learned, WILLIAM Earle of St.
                     
                     
                        My Lord,
                     
                     THe Laurell doth your reverend temples wreath
                     As aptly now, as when your youth did breath
                     Those tragicke raptures which your name shall save
                     From the blacke edict of a tyrant grave.
                     Nor shall your Day ere set, till the Sunne shall
                     From the blind heavens like a cynder fall;
                     And all the elements intend their strife,
                     To ruine what they fram'd; Then your fames life,
                     When desp'rate Time lies gasping shall expire
                     Attended by the world ith' generall fire.
                     Fame lengthens thus her selfe. And I to tread
                     Your steps to glory, search among the dead,
                     Where Vertue lies obscur'd; that as I give
                     Life to her tombe, I spight of time may live.
                     Now I resolve in triumph of my verse,
                     To bring great Talbot from that forren hearse,
                     Which yet doth to her fright his dust enclose:
                     Then to sing Herbert who so glorious rose,
                     With the fourth Edward, that his faith doth shine
                     Yet in the faith of noblest Pembrookes line.
                     
                        Sometimes my swelling spirits I prepare
                     To speake the mighty Percy, neerest heire,
                     In merits as in blood, to CHARLES the great:

                        Thus wreathes to kisse his leavy face:
                        Their streames thus Rivers joyne,
                        And lose themselves in the embrace.
                        But Trees want sence when they infold,
                        And Waters when they meet, are cold.
                     
                     
                        Thus Turtles bill, and grone

                           Two flames thus burne in one,
                        When their curl'd heads to heaven they reare.
                        But Birds want soule though not desire:
                        And flames materiall soone expire.
                     
                     
                        If not prophane; we'll say
                        When Angels colse, their joyes are such▪
                        
                        For we no love obey
                        That's bastard to a fleshly touch.

                     Of his good Majestye to celebrate,
                     Who'le judge them loyall subjects without that:
                     Yet they, who some fond priviledge to maintaine,
                     VVould have rebeld; their best freehold, their braine
                     Surrender'd there; and five fifteenes did pay
                     To drinke his happy life and raigne. O day
                     It was thy piety to flye; th' hadst beene
                     Found accessary else to this fond sinne.
                     But I forget to speake each stratagem
                     By which the dishes enter'd, and in them
                     
                        Each luscious miracle, As if more bookes

                     All wonders in the kitchin Alchimy.
                     But Ile not leave you there, before you part
                     You shall have something of another art.

                     Whose beauty weares so cleare a skin
                     That it decayes with the least taint of sin.
                     Vice growes by custome, nor dare we
                     Reject it as a slave, where it breaths free.

                        .
                     Your soule's a well built City, where
                     Theres such munition, that no war breeds feare:
                     No rebels wilde destractions move;
                     For you the heads have crusht; Rage, Envy, Love.
                     And therefore you defiance bid
                     To open enmity, or mischiefe hid
                     In fawning hate and supple pride,
                     Who are on every corner fortifide.
                     Your youth not rudely led by rage
                     Of blood, is now the story of your age
                     Which without boast you may averre
                     'Fore blackest danger, glory did prefer:
                     Glory not purchast by the breath
                     Of Sycophants, but by encountring death.
                     
                        Yet wildnesse nor the feare of lawes
                     Did make you fight, but justice of the cause.
                     For but mad prodigals they are
                     Of fortitude, who for it selfe love warre.
                     When well made peace had clos'd the eyes
                     Of discord, sloath did not your youth surprize.
                     Your life as well as powre, did awe
                     The bad, and to the good was the best law:
                     when most men vertue did pursue
                     In hope by it to grow in fame like you.
                     Nor when you did to court repaire,
                     Did you your manners alter with the ayre.
                     You did your modesty retaine
                     Your faithfull dealing the same tongue and braine.
                     Nor did all the soft flattery there
                     Inchant you so, but still you truth could heare.
                     And though your roofes were richly guilt,
                     The basis was on no wards ruine built.
                     Nor were your vassals made a prey,
                     And for

                     And though no bravery was knowne
                     To out-shine yours, you onely spent your owne.
                     For 'twas the indulgence of fate,
                     To give y' a moderate minde, and bounteous state?
                     But I, my Lord, who have no friend
                     Of fortune, must begin where you doe end.
                     
                        'Tis dang'rous to approach the fire
                     Of action; nor is't safe, farre to retire,

                     And flatter so my selfe, Ile see

                        Thou didst the old Methusalem out-live.
                        Though Time, but twenty yeares account can give
                        Of thy abode on earth, yet every houre

                        Keepes young the body, but the soule makes gray.
                        Such miracles workes goodnesse: and behind
                        Th'ast left to us such stories of thy minde
                        Fit for example; that when them we read,
                        We envy earth the treasure of the dead.
                        Why doe the sinfull riot and survive
                        The feavers of their surfets? Why alive

                        Who the loose lawes of their wilde blood obey?
                        Why lives the gamester, who doth blacke the night
                        With cheats and imprecations? Why is light
                        
                           Looked on by those whose breath may poyson it:
                        Who sold the vigor of their strength and wit
                        To buy diseases: and thou, who faire truth
                        And vertue didst adore, lost in thy youth?
                     
                     
                        But Ile not question fate. Heaven doth conveigh
                        Those first from the darke prison of their clay
                        Who are most fit for heaven. Thou in warre
                        Hadst tane degrees, those dangers felt, which are
                        The props on which peace safely doth subsist
                        And through the Cannons blew and horrid mist
                        Hadst brought her light: And now wert so compleat
                        That naught but death did want to make thee great.
                     
                     
                        Thy death was timely then bright soule to thee.
                        And in thy fate thou suffer'dst not. 'Twas we
                        Who dyed rob'd of thy life: in whose increase
                        Of reall glory both in warre and peace,
                        We all did share: and thou away we feare
                        Didst with thee, the whole stocke of honour beare,

                     What pompe is then in us? Who th'other day
                     Were nothing; and in triumph now, but clay.

                     And thou art gone: like ships which plough the Sea,
                     And leave no print for man to tracke their way.

                        Madam,
                     
                     SHould the cold Muscovit, whose furre and stove
                     Can scarse prepare him heate enough for love,
                     But view the wonder of your presence, he
                     Would scorne his winters sharpest injury:
                     And trace the naked groves, till he found bayse
                     To write the beautious triumphs of your prayse,
                     
                        As a dull Poet even he would say,
                     Th' unclouded Sun had never showne them day
                     Till that bright minute; that he now admires
                     No more why the coy Spring so soone retires
                     From their unhappy clyme; It doth pursue
                     The Sun, and he derives his light from you.
                     Hee'd tell you how the fetter'd Baltick Sea
                     Is set at freedome, while the yee away▪
                     
                     Doth melt at your approach; how by so faire
                     Harmonious beauty, their rude manners are
                     Reduc't to order; how to them you bring
                     The wealthiest mines below, above the Spring.
                     Thus would his wonder speake For he would want
                     Religion to beleeve, there were a Saint
                     Within, and all he saw was but the shrine.
                     But I here pay my vowes to the devine
                     Pure essence there inclos'd, which if it were
                     Not hid in a faire cloud, but might appeare
                     In its full lustre, would make Nature live
                     In a state equall to her primitive.
                     But sweetly thats obscur'd. Yet though our eye
                     Cannot the splendor of your soule descry
                     In true perfection, by a glimmering light,
                     Your language yeelds us, we can guesse how bright
                     The Sunne within you shines, and curse th'unkind
                     Eclipse, or else our selves for being blinde.

                     How hastily doth Nature build up man
                     To leave him so imperfect? For he can
                     See nought beyond his sence; she doth controule
                     So farre his fight he nere discern'd a soule.
                     For had yours beene the object of his eye;
                     It had turn'd wonder to Idolatry.

                  A Friend
                  
                     IS a man. For the free and open discovery of thoughts to woman can not passe without an over licentious familiarity, or a justly occasion'd suspition; and friendship can neither stand with vice nor infamie. He is vertuous, for love begot in sin is a mishapen monster, and seldome out-lives his birth. He is noble, and inherits the vertues of all his progenitors; though happily unskilfull to blazon his paternall coate; So little should nobility serve for story, but when it encourageth



to action. He is so valiant, feare could never be listned to, when she whisper'd danger; and yet fights not, unlesse religion confirmes the quarrell lawfull. He submits his actions to the government of vertue, not to the wilde decrees of popular opinion; and when his conscience is fully satisfied, he cares not how mistake and ignorance interpret him. He hath so much fortitude he can forgive an injurie; and when hee hath overthrowne his opposer, not insult upon his weaknesse. Hee is an absolute governor; no destroyer of his passions, which he imployes to the noble increase of vertue. He is wise, for who hopes to reape a harvest from the sands, may expect the perfect offices of friendship from a foole. He hath by a liberall education beene softned to civility; for that rugged honesty some rude men professe, is an indigested Chaos; which may containe the seedes of goodnesse, but it wants forme and order.
                  
                     He is no flutterer; but when he findes his friend any way imperfect, he freely but gently informes him; nor yet shall some few errors cancell the bond of friendship; because he remembers no endeavours can raise 
                        •
                     an above his frailety. He is as slow to enter into that title, as he is to forsake it; a monstrous vice must disobliege, because an extraordinary vertue did first unite; and when he parts, he doth it without a duell. He is neither effeminate, nor a common courtier; the first is so passionate a doater upon himselfe, hee cannot spare love enough: to bee justly named friendship: the latter hath his love so diffusive among the beauties, that man is not considerable. He is not accustomed to any sordid way of gaine, for who is any way mechanicke, will sell his friend upon more profitable termes. He is bountifull, and thinkes no treasure of fortune equall to the preservation of him he loves;



yet not so lavish, as to buy friendship, and perhaps afterward finde himselfe overseene in the purchase. He is not exceptio
                        •
                     s, for jealousie proceedes from weakenesse, and his vertues quit him from suspitions. He freely gives advice, but so little peremptory is his opinion that he ingenuously submits it to an abler judgement. He is open in expression of his thoughts and easeth his melancholy by inlarging it; and no Sanctuary preserves so safely, as he his friend afflicted. He makes use of no engines of his friendship to extort a secret; but if committed to his charge, his heart receives it, and that and it come both 
                        •
                     o light together. In life he is the most amiable object to the soule, in death the most deplorable.

                     In griefe a method: without forme I weepe.
                     
                        The sonne (rich in his fathers fate) hath eyes
                     Wet just as long as are the obsequies.
                     The widow formerly a yeare doth spend
                     In her so courtly blackes. But for a Friend
                     We weepe an age, and more than th' Anchorit, have
                     Our very thoughts confin'd within a Grave.
                     Chast Love who hadst thy tryumph in my flame
                     And thou Castara who had hadst a name,
                     But for this sorrow glorious: Now my verse
                     Is lost to you, and onely on Talbots herse
                     Sadly attends. And till times fatall hand
                     Ruines, what's left of Churches, there shall stand.
                     There to thy selfe, deare Talbot Ile repeate
                     Thy owne brave story; tell thy selfe how great
                     Thou wert in thy mindes Empire, and how all
                     Who out-live thee, see but the Funerall
                     Of glory: and if yet some vertuous be,
                     They but weake apparitions are of thee.
                     So setled were thy thoughts, each action so
                     Discreetely ordered, that nor ebbe nor flow
                     Was ere perceiv'd in thee: each word mature
                     And every sceane of life from sinne so pure
                     That scarce in its whole history, we can

                     To lay my lifes ambition desolate.
                     Yet thus much comfort have I, that I know,
                     Not how it can give such another blow.
                  
                  
                     Elegie, 5.
                     CHast as the Nuns first vow, as fairely bright
                     As when by death her Soule shines in full light
                     Freed from th' eclipse of Earth, each word that came
                     From thee (deare Talbot) did beget a flame
                     T'enkindle vertue: which so faire by thee
                     Became, man that blind mole her face did see.
                     But now to'our eye she's lost, and if she dwell
                     Yet on the earth; she's conffin'd in the cell
                     Of some cold Hermit; who so keepes her there,
                     As if of her the old man jealous were.
                     Nor ever showes her beauty, but to some
                     
                        Carthusian, who even by his vow, is dumbe!
                     So 'mid the yce of the farre Northren sea,
                     A starre about the Articke Circle, may

                     Thou (brightest constellation) to this maine
                     Which all we sinners traffique on, didst daigne
                     The bounty of thy fire, which with so cleare
                     And constant beames did our frayle vessels steere,

                     But now vve sayle at randome. Every rocke
                     The folly doth of our ambition mocke
                     And splits our hopes: To every Sirens breath
                     We listen and even court the face of death,
                     If painted ore by pleasure: Every wave
                     Ift hath delight w'embrace though't prove a grave.
                     So ruinous is the defect of thee,
                     To th'undone world in gen'rall. But to me
                     Who liv'd one life with thine, drew but one breath,
                     Possest with th' same mind &amp; thoughts, 'twas death.
                     And now by fate: I but my selfe survive,
                     To keepe his mem'ry, and my griefes alive.

                     Silent and darke, but is prophan'd by Love:

                     Are certaine prophecies. And till our eares
                     
                        Reach that caelestiall musique, which thine now
                     So cheerefully receive, we must allow
                     No comfort to our griefes: from which to be
                     Exempted, is in death to follow thee.
                  
                  
                     Elegie, 7.
                     THere is no peace in sinne. Aeternall war
                     Doth rage 'mong vices. But all vertues are
                     Friends 'mong themselves, and choisest accents be
                     Harsh Eccho's of their heavenly harmonie.
                     While thou didst live we did that union finde
                     In the so faire republick of thy mind,
                     Where discord never swel'd. And as we dare
                     Affirme those goodly structures, temples are
                     Where well-tun'd quires strike zeale into the eare:
                     The musique of thy soule made us say, there
                     God had his Altars; every breath a spice
                     And each religious act a sacrifice.
                     But death hath that demolisht. All our eye
                     Of thee now sees doth like a Cittie lye
                     Raz'd by the cannon. Where is then that flame
                     That added warmth and beauty to thy frame?
                     
                        Fled heaven-ward to repaire, with its pure fire
                     The losses of some maim'd Seraphick quire?
                     Or hovers it beneath, the world t'uphold
                     From generall ruine, and expell that cold
                     Dull humor weakens it? If so it be;
                     My sorrow yet must prayse fates charity.
                     But thy example (if kinde heaven had daignd
                     Frailty that favour) had mankind regaind
                     To his first purity. For that the wit
                     Of vice, might not except 'gainst th' Ancherit
                     As too to strickt; thou didst uncloyster'd live:
                     Teaching the soule by what preservative,
                     She may from sinnes contagion live secure,
                     Though all the ayre she suckt in, were impure▪
                     
                     In this darke mist of error with a cleare.
                     Vnspotted light, thy vertue did appeare.
                     T' obray'd corrupted man. How could the rage.
                     Of untam'd lust have scorcht decrepit age;
                     Had it seene thy chast youth? Who could the wealth
                     Of time have spent in ryot, or his health
                     By surfeits forfeited; if he had seene
                     What temperance had in thy dyet beene?
                     What glorious foole had vaunted honours bought
                     By gold or practise, or by rapin brought
                     From his fore-fathers, had he understood
                     How Talbot valued not his owne great blood!
                     
                        Had Politiciana seene him scorning more
                     The unsafe pompe of greatnesse, then the poore
                     Thatcht roofes of shepheards, where th' unruly wind
                     (A gentler storme than pride) uncheckt doth find
                     Still free admittance: their pale labors had
                     Beene to be good, not to be great and bad.
                     But he is lost in a blind vault, and we
                     Must not admire though sinnes now frequent be
                     And uncontrol'd: Since those faire tables where
                     The Law was writ by death now broken are,
                     By death extinguish tis that Star, whose light
                     Did shine so faithfull: that each ship sayl'd right
                     Which steer'd by that. Nor marvell then if we,

                     Th' are short in treasure of this precious tombe.
                     Here is th' Epitome of wealth, this chest
                     Is Natures chiefe Exchequer, hence the East
                     When it is purified by th' generall fire
                     Shall see these now pale ashes sparkle higher
                     Then all the gems she vants: transcending far
                     In fragrant iustre the bright morning star.
                     Tis true, they now seeme darke. But rather we
                     Have by a cataract lost sight, then he

                     Brings darkenesse, when the Sun retaines his light.
                     Thou eclips'd dust! Expecting breake of day
                     From the thicke mists about thy Tombe, I'le pay
                     Like the just Larke, the tribute of my verse
                     I will invite thee, from thy envious herse
                     To rise, and 'bout the World thy beames to spread,
                     That we may see, there's brightnesse in the dead,
                     My zeale deludes me not. What perfumes come
                     From th' happy vault? In her sweete martyrdome
                     The nard breathes never so, nor so the rose
                     When the enamor'd Spring by kissing blowes
                     Soft blushes on her cheeke, nor th' early East
                     Vying with Paradice, ith' Phoenix nest.
                     These gentle perfumes usher in the day
                     Which from the night of his discolour'd clay
                     
                        Breakes on the sudden: for a Soule so bright
                     Of force must to her earth contribute light.
                     But if w' are so far blind, we cannot see
                     The wonder of this truth; yet let us be
                     Not infidels: nor like dull Atheists give
                     Our selves so long to lust, till we beleive
                     (T' allay the griefe of sinne) that we shall fall
                     To a loath'd nothing in our Funerall.
                     The bad mans death is horror. But the just
                     Keepes something of his glory in his dust.

Hee knowes humane pollicie but a crooked rule of action: and therefore by a distrust of his owne knowledge attaines it: Confounding with supernaturall illumination, the opinionated judgment of the wise. In prosperity he gratefully admires the bounty of the Almighty giver, and useth, not abuseth plenty: But in adversity hee remaines unshaken, and like some eminent mountaine hath his head above the clouds. For his happinesse is not meteor-like exhaled from the vapors of this world; but shines a fixt starre, which when by misfortune it appeares to fall, onely casts away the slimie matter. Poverty he neither feares nor covets, but cheerefully entertaines; imagining it the fire which tries vertue: Nor how tyrannically



soever it usurpe on him, doth he pay to it a sigh or wrinckle: for he who suffers want without reluctancie, may be poore not miserable. He sees the covetous prosper by usury, yet waxeth not leane with envie: and when the posteritie of the impious flourish, he questiones not the divine justice; for temporall rewards distinguish not ever the merits of men: and who hath beene of councel with the Aeternall? Fame he weighes not, but esteemes a smoake, yet such as carries with it the sweetest odour, and riseth usually from the Sacrifice of our best actions. Pride he disdaines, when he findes it swelling in himselfe; but easily forgiveth it in another: Nor can any mans error in life, make him sinne in censure, since seldome the folly we condemne is so culpable as the severity of our judgement. He doth not malice the over-spreading growth of his aequ

dangerous, but what is rais'd through our owne demerit. When he lookes on others vices, he values not himselfe vertuous by comparison, but examines his owne defects, and findes matter enough at home for reprehension: In conversation his carriage is neither plausible to flattery, nor reserv'd to rigor: but so demeanes himselfe as created for societie. In solitude he remembers his better part is Angelicall; and therefore his minde practiseth the best discourse without assistance of inferiour Organs. Lust i

Not dissolved into undecent laughter, or tickled with wit scurrilous or injurious. He cunningly searcheth into the vertues of others, and liberally commends them: but buries the vices of the imperfect



in a charitable silence, whose manners he reformes not by invectives but example: In prayer he is frequent not apparent: yet as he labours not the opinion, so he foares not the scandall of being thought good. He every day travailes his meditations up to heaven, and never findes himself wearied with the journey: but when the necessities of nature returne him downe to earth, he esteemes it a place, hee is condemned to. Devotion is his Mistresse en which he is passionately enamord: for that he hath found the most Soveraigne antidote aganst sinne, and the onely balsome powerfull to cure those wounds hee hath receav'd through frailety. To live he knowes a benefit, and the contempt of it ingratitude, and therefore loves, but not doates on life. Death how deformed soever an aspect it weares, he is not frighted with: since it not annihilates, but uncloudes the soule. He therefore stands

                        But waxing sober soone I found▪
                        
                        Fame but an Idle sound.
                     
                     
                        Then I my blood obey'd
                        And each bright face an Idoll made:
                        Verse in an humble Sacrifice,
                        I offer'd to my Mistresse eyes.
                        But I no sooner grace did win
                        But met the devill within.
                     
                     
                        
                        But growne more polliticke
                        I tooke account of each state tricke:
                        Observ'd each motion, judg'd him wise,
                        VVho had a conscience fit to rise.
                        VVhom soone I found but forme and rule
                        And the more serious foole.
                     
                     
                        But now my soule prepare
                        To ponder what and where we are
                        How fraile is life, how vaine a breath▪
                        
                        Opinion, how uncertaine death:
                        How onely a poore stone shall beare
                        VVitnesse that once we were.
                     
                     
                        How a shrill. Trumpet shall
                        Vs to the barre as traytors call.
                        Then shall we see too late that pride
                        Hath hope with flattery bely'd
                        And that the mighty in command
                        Pale Cowards there must stand.
                     
                  
                  
                     Recogitabo tibi omnes annos meos. ISAY.
                     
                     
                        TIme! where didst thou those yeares inter
                        VVhich I have seene decease?
                        
                           My soules at war and truth bids her▪
                        
                        Finde out their hidden Sepulcher,
                        To give her troubles peace.
                     
                     
                        Pregnant with flowers doth not the Spring
                        Like a late bride appeare?
                        VVhose fether'd Musicke onely bring
                        Caresses, and no Requiem sing
                        On the departed yeare?
                     
                     
                        The Earth, like some rich wanton heire,
                        VVhose Parents coffin'd lye,
                        Forgets it once lookt pale and bare
                        And doth for vanities prepare,
                        As the Spring nere should dye.
                     
                     
                        The present houre, flattered by all
                        Reflects not on the last;
                        But I, like a sad factor shall
                        T' account my life each moment call,
                        And onely weepe the past.
                     
                     
                        My mem'ry trackes each severall way
                        Since Reason did begin
                        Over my actions her first sway:
                        And teacheth me that each new day
                        Did onely vary sin.
                     
                     
                        Poore banckrout Conscience! where are those
                        Rich houres but farm'd to thee?
                        
                           How careless
                              •
                           ly I some did lose,
                        And other to my lust dispose
                        As no rent day should be?
                     
                     
                        I have infected with impure
                        Disorders my past yeares.
                        But Ile to penitence inure
                        Those that succeed. There is no cure
                        Nor Antidote but teares.
                     
                  
                  
                     Cupio dissolvi. Paule.
                     
                        THe soule which doth with God unite,
                        Those gayities how doth she slight
                        VVhich ore opinion sway?
                        Like sacred Virgin wax, which shines
                        On Altars or on Martyrs shrines
                        How doth she burne away?
                     
                     
                        How violent are her throwes till she
                        From envious earth delivered be,
                        Which doth her flight restraine?
                        How doth she doate on whips and rackes,
                        
                           On fires and the so dreaded Axe,
                        And every murd'ring paine?
                     
                     
                        How soone she leaves the pride of wealth,
                        The flatteries of youth and health
                        And fames more precious breath.
                        And every gaudy circumstance
                        That doth the pompe of life advance
                        At the approach of death?
                     
                     
                        The cunning of Astrologers
                        Observes each motion of the starres
                        Placing all knowledge there:
                        And Lovers in their Mistresse eyes
                        Contract those wonders of the 
                              •
                           kies.
                        And seeke no higher sphere.
                     
                     
                        The wandring Pilot sweates to find
                        The causes that produce the wind
                        Still gazing on the Pole.
                        The Politician scornes all Art
                        But what doth pride and power impart.
                        And swells the ambitious soule.
                     
                     
                        
                        But he whom heavenly fire doth warme,
                        And 'gainst these powerfull follies arme,
                        Doth soberly disdaine
                        All these fond humane misteries
                        As the deceitfull and unwise
                        Distempers of our braine.
                     
                     
                        He as a burden beares his clay,
                        Yet vainely throwes it not away
                        On every idle cause:
                        But with the same untroubled eye
                        Can or resolve to live or dye,
                        Regardlesse of th' applause.
                     
                     
                        My God! If 'tis thy great decree
                        That this must the last moment be
                        Wherein I breath this ayre;
                        My heart obeyes joy'd to retreate
                        From the false favours of the great
                        And treachery of the faire.
                     
                     
                        When thou shalt please this soulet' enthrowne,
                        Above impure corruption;
                        What should I grieve or feare.
                        To thinke this breathlesse body must
                        Become a loathsome heape of dust
                        And nere againe appeare.
                     
                     
                        
                        For in the fire when Ore is tryed;
                        And by that torment purified:
                        Doe we deplore the losse?
                        And when thou shalt my soule refine,
                        That it thereby may purer shine
                        Shall I grieve for the drosse?
                     
                  
                  FINIS.
