            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            ADMIRABLE AND MEMORABLE HISTORIES CONTAIning the wonders of our time. Collected into FRENCH out of the best Authors. By I. GOVLART. And out of French into English. By ED. GRIMESTON.

            Imprinted at London by GEORGE ELD 1607.
         
         
            
            
            To the Honorable Knight, Sir Walter Cope.
            
            
               Sir,
            
            
               IT may bee held indiscretion, that hauing lately escaped Shipwrack, I should so sodenly thrust out againe from a safe Port into a tempestuous Sea of mens humors, and subiect my selfe to a new Censure. I must confesse that silence had beene more secure, yet I may freely say, that neither conceipt of mine owne abilitie, nor any vaine affectation of applause, did make me runne into this danger, but onely a desire to spend such idle houres as I could steale from my daylye attendance in Court, in such sort as others might reape some content thereby. At the request of my friend I vndertooke the translation of this worke: the title wherof shewes the subiect to be extraordinarie, and if many of these Histories shall seeme very strange, miraculous, and it may be fabulous, for that they exceede our common sence &amp; apprehension, I must with Mounsier GOVIART, referre them to the Authors, out of whose writings they are collected, who being learned and iudicious,

it is to bee presumed would not incurre so foule an imputation, as to bee reputed Liars. There is nothing mine but a bare tanslation, the which I haue faithfully performed; Such as it is, (beeing this last Lents exercise,) I haue presumed to offer vnto you, as a pledge of thankefullnesse for many kinde fauors. If it be not answerable to your worth, Impute it to my defects, and not vnto my will, whose desire is to giue you better satisfaction, that the old saying may not be verified in mee. Tritum est, perire quod facis ingrato. If it shall like you, I knowe it will please many, and my selfe shall reape a desired content, with which hope I will rest.
            
               Yours euer to be commanded. EDW. GRIMESTON.
            
         
         
            
            The Authors aduertisment to the courteous Reader.
            
               I Haue noted for some yeares many thousands of Histories collected out of sundrie Authors, to whose consciences I referre you, ingaging my selfe for nothing of their writings, but a faithful collection which I haue made, &amp; yet thinking that they would offer nothing that were false or foolish to bee published, without good consideration. I call them Admirable, for that the reasons of many of them are farre beyond my apprehension, and that to my iudgement they are miraculous. They are also Memorable, for the contentment, instruction and consolation which good and quiet soules may gather thereby. I haue very seldome exceeded the age that went last before vs, and will forbeare it more in those bookes that shall followe, If GOD will giue mee leaue. The History of our times is an abridgement of all the wonders of fore-passed ages: Do not blame me if I were desirous to offer vnto you some patternes, to reuiue your thoughts. When you shall haue seene the continuance, if you shall remember any thing worthy to bee left to our posteritie, you may surmount our example. It shalbe easie for you. I do inuite and coniure you. GOD cannot bee better knowne and reuerenced of vs in his iudgements and mercies. Those which can performe it in a heigher stile, will not disdaine my weake affection. As for others which cannot or will not do any thing but censure and

inueighe, I wish them true vnderstanding and a good conscience. In my opinion GOD in this newe age doth raise vp men, who in diuers places are carefull to note in Iournals and Annales, all that we see worthie to bee reserued for instruction of our successors. I would not set out in collours these plaine Histories, which I represent vnto you. As good stomaks haue no neede of saulces, so strong spirits are content with a simple reading, the which they studie to conuert into quickning substance. The ende of this collection and of the following, shalbe Feare GOD, and keepe his Commandements: this is the dutie of man. For GOD will call euery worke into iudgement, bee it good or euill.
            
               GOVLART.
            
         
         
            The Printer to the Reader.
            IF any thinke these Histories strange, he may see the very title sayes as much: And it is good for an author to bee as good as his title: And this being a translation, it must be strange. If any thinke that by the name of Histories, all should be true, he may knowe Historiographers confesse they may write as they list. And Lucian entitles his most fabulous narrations a true Historie: And if these be but tales, yet either hee is Maister, or he cites you his tales-maister, (more then most men will do) And very tales are heard or read by most of vs with good delight. These from good authors to good purpose are in good sort set downe. Then sit thee downe and make thy good of them: for haue thou a good memory and they will prooue memorable: that nor thou repent reading, nor he writing, nor we translating and Imprinting. This is all, and of this make thy best.

            A strange accident of a yong Maide.
            
               CORNELIVS GEMMA, a Physick reader at Louvain, in the ende of the fourth Chapter, of his second booke, of a worke intitled, de diuinis Na
                     •…
                  urae Caracterismis, settes downe an admirable History at large; the which I will relate as briefly as I may. A yong Maiden remaining (saith he) neere vnto mee, whose Father was a Cooper: beeing fifteene yeares old, of a good constitution of Body, fayre and of a good spirit, of a melancholy complexion mixt with sanguin: her Name was KATHERINE GAVLTHIER, fell sicke and weake, through diuers accidents. About the month of Ianuary in the yeare 1571. her monethly termes aduanced twise or thrise: but being staid, presently through the vyolence of her infirmity, they caused a great wearinesse ouer all her body. It was suspected she had beene poysoned by a certaine Woman of an ill fame, who had giuen her a peece of a Cake. Eating it, shee felt it painfull to swallow. After the which, she began to feele strange paines at her stomacke; shee grew leane, vomited sometimes, her stomacke fayled her, and she felt a dysinesse in her Head, with other accidents which torment Women

with Child, especially in the 4. and 7. month, For about mid Iune she was subiect to Feauers &amp; some kind of Convulsions. Her paines did in like sort increase; so as like a mad Woman shee tormented her selfe, growing bigge, pale &amp; short-winded, and in the end, she was so opprest with paine, as she grewe blacke in the Face, like one that had beene strangled. She was so tormented as foure men could scarse hold her, for casting her selfe from her bed to the ground, there was no kind of Convulsion, but did afflict her. These panges hauing continued by fits vnto the 9. month, her Parents, began to flie vnto the Phisitians. I was first called, because I dwelt neerest. But being from home, they repayred to Maister BEAVSARD, who considering of this disease thought she had beene troubled with VVormes. It happened after many grieuous pangues, that Nature working by her force, made her to voyde a quicke Eele at her seege, the which was presently brought vnto mee. It was a very Eele, great as a mans thombe, and a foote and a halfe long, with a good proportion, and all parts perfect. Three dayes before it came forth, both the Mayde and those that were about her, heard a great noyse, and as it were a hissing in her belly. And beeing come forth, the Maide sayd: That she had felt the Eele put forth her head before, and drawe it backe againe, and then to thrust forth sodainly and with violence. This Eele remayning among the excrements, seemed for a great space dead, but beeing put into a pot of water, it did stirre very strongly. After the voyding thereof, the extreme pangues which had so much tormented her, began to ceasse. But the Eele which they had ript and clensed, being hanged vp whereas neither Cat not any

other beast could reach it, vanished in an instant. Soone after the Maide began to cast vp great abundance of water, the which I came to see beeing like vnto vrine, and of a strange taste, as the Patient sayde▪ This vomiting continued 15. dayes, in euery one of the which, she voyded about 24. pounds waight of water at the mouth. I report not these things by heare-say, but for that I did see and toucht them with my hands. I was no lesse amazed to see, that besides this great abundance of water which she voyded at her mouth, she made water in great abundance, twise or thrise a daie, without any swelling of her bellie, or any other part of her bodie: neither did shee drinke aboue one cup of VVine, Beere or other liquor in a daie. I asked her, if she felt no payne in one of the Miseraicall veines? She answered me, that her left side had alwayes troubled her much, since the voyding of the Eele, and that before, she had felt some heauinesse in that place: but since she was troubled with great gnawing and pricking, which made her to crie out, when I did but touch it with my finger. After shee had vomited so much water, she began to cast forth lumps of haire at her mouth, some as long as a mans finger, some more, some lesse, such as wee see fall from olde Dogges, in great quantitie for certaine daies, enough to haue stust whole dozens of Tennice Balles. She cast them vp with great heauing at the heart and much paine, falling one night into wonderful transies. Hauing found her in a manner, like vnto one that was readie to giue vp the Ghost, and carefully obseruing all things, beeing layd vpon her belly, I did see her cast her selfe so so dainlayd from one side vnto the other, as if she had not beene presently stai'd, she had beat her head against the wall,

oragainst the bed post. She held her hands so strongly together, as it was impossible to open them. Sometimes she beat her breast so violently, as she was like to kill her selfe. This fit continued from seuen of the clock at night vntill nine, and then shee knew not any one. Oftentimes (as in the suffocation of the Matrix) she grewe wonderfully red, and seemed very weary and toyled, with some beginning of a Feauer. Once or twise she fomed about the mouth. And an other time, beeing in the extremity of her fit, shee fell sodainly into a great laughter, and then presently wept bitterly. Being come vnto her selfe, and falling presently into a long extasie, she began in an instant to speake, as if she had addressed her selfe vnto GOD, holding her hands vp to Heaueh, shee spake these words in effect. O great GOD; seeing thy beauty is so great, and incredible, how long shal we remaine here? when wilt thou take mee out of this World, that I may inioye thee? hauing said thus, as it were awaking and looking on them that were about her, she said: Which of you hath done mee this wrong to call mee backe into this valley of misery, and into the prison of darkenesse, when as I did rest so sweetly, and did sport my selfe in the goodliest Gardens that could be immagined? I do not thinke that a simple and ignorant Maide, (as this was) could vtter such words but in extasie. In the meane time she cast vp great lumpes of hayre mixt with much white matter, and very thicke: and somtimes like vnto the dung of Pigions or Geese. In this abundance of filth appeared little peeces of wood and shreds of Parchment. A little after she had an other vomiting of a matter as black as coles; you would haue said properly it had beene Inke, or rather coles beaten to pouder

and mixt with water, the which continued a good while, two or three pounds euery day, sometimes with such store of white haire, long &amp; hard, as it would haue made a good Ball. After two dayes, she did vomit about two pounds of pure bloud, as if a veyne had bene opened. This monstrous casting continued a whole weeke, comming still at a certaine houre: and then the fits of the Epilepsie wherewith she was dayly tormented ceased, the which notwithstanding continued sometime, once in three dayes, and in the end euery seuenth day. In the meane time she did still cast haire, but not so aboundantlie as before: but blacker and shorter, as if they had beene cut small, and with it a slimie humour, like vnto thick matter.
            About the middest of September, she did vomit great peeces of parchment, halfe a spanne long, like vnto the thicke and fleshie skinne of a mans body. Afterwards she cast vp others, that were thinner, but all black. In the end shee did vomit some that were very thinne, but strong, amongst the which there were three a foote long made in fashion of lozenges, with strange markes and figures. After these skinnes, followed an infinite number of stones, which shee did cast vp at a certaine houre euery night, with great noise and sounding, such as is heard in walles that are pulled downe: some were thick, others pointed, vnequall in forme, and of a darke coullour: they were all small, and yet such as they did still feare the maide would haue beene strangled: some were couered with Chalke, and cymented together, in such sort, as they might be sayd to haue beene pulled out of a wall. Once in my presence she did vomit a pointed stone, as big as two Chest-nuts. This stone remained aboue a

quarrer of an houre in her throate, during the which she had no pulce nor respiration, so as laying a light feather vpon her mouth, it did not moue: her hands and feete grew colde, and her body stiffe, as if it had beene an Image. Thinking that she had finished her course, and that paine had ended all her miseries. I went out of the chamber, saying that she was dead: when as the Mother called me sodenly back againe, saying, that her daughter did stirre, and opened her eyes. As soone as I was returned, she did cast vp this stone with great violence: I did see it come forth, and heard the noise thereof falling into a bason, the which did amaze both my selfe, and all that were in the Chamber. At the same instant she did spit out a peece of wood as bigge as ones thombe, but with lesse difficultie then the stone: and withall some black haires, but few. There followed after an other accident almost incredible, where-with the maide had almost beene choakt, for shee did vomit vp a bone of a Triangle forme, sollide without, and hollow and spungious within. The next day shee cast vp little boanes of diuers formes and proportions. Amongst all these were seene stones and haire, and then peeces of Glasse and Copper. CORNELIVS GEMMA sets downe the remedies which he did apply, and maintaines, that part of her infirmitie grew by naturall causes, and part by the Impostures and illusions of the Diuill, who was a chiefe Agent in these accidents which wee haue reported. This Historie is written by MARCELLVS DONATVS in his second Booke of his Admirable Histories of Phisicke, the first Chapter.
               
            
         
         
            
            A false accusation seuerely punished.
            
               MAister IVLIAN TABOVE the Kings Atturney generall in the Parliament of Chambery, being incensed for some admonitions that were made vnto him by the Court, goes into the Countrie, and ingageth his honor, by an accusation which he framed against Maister RAYMOND PELISON President, IOHN BOISONNE Priest, LEWIS GAVSLERANT called ROZET, GRAFFINS and other councellors of the said Court, charging them with many corruptions and false-hoods vnder his hand, both before the great Councell, and the Parliament of Grenoble, vpon thirteene Acts proceeding from the foresaid President PELISSON, and the aboue named Councellors. The first was a sentence giuen in the sayd Parliament of Chambery for the Count de la Chambre, the 11. of May 1539. The second a decree for Maister ANDREVV PILLET, the 13. of Iune the same yeare. Other two decrees for the Bishop of Morienne, the 19. of March, and 20. of December, in the yeare 1540. The 5. the admonitions dated the 11. 13. and 18. of Ianuary 1541. made and deliuered to the said TABOVE, the 1. of February 1542. The 6. a Commission giuen by the said Court of Chambery to the said BOISSONNE, the 6. of February 1542. The 7. the Articles sent to the said BOISSONNE the 25. of February 1542. The eight, other admonitions made to the sayd TABOVE, and a sentence giuen the 23. of February, the same yeare. The 9. a sentence pronounced in the sayd Court, the 23. of

December, the same yeare. The 10. a Commission giuen to Maister NICHOLAS de la CHESNAY, Councellor in the same Court. The 11. a Letter deliuered vnto vnto him, and written in the name of the sayd Court, to the Chancellor of France, the 1. of Aprill 1545.
            The 12. an Answer made by the Iudges of the sayde Parliament of Chambery the 17. of December 1541. to the aduertisments sent vnto the King by the sayde TABOVE, termed in the Processe, the fiue points. The 13. and last, a sentence giuen in the sayde Court, the 23. of Iune, in the yeare 1540. touching a sute betwixt the Kings Atturney generall and the Lord of Eschelle. This matter beeing deliuered vnto the King, and found hard and of importance, for the grauity of the cause and of the persons: it was committed to the Parliament of Bourgondy at Dijon, where the said President &amp; Councellors yeelded themselues prisoners, TABOVE beeing their accuser. After that their cryminall and extraordinary Processe had beene made, many sentences were giuen. The first was the second of Maie against GRAFFINS Councellor, whome they found to be least charged, who notwithstanding was condemned in a fine of three score pounds vnto the King, and twentie pounds vnto TABOVE, and suspended from his place for a yeare. TABOVE pleaded then with great shewe, thanking GOD, after the manner of MOYSES, IOSVA, and others, for the victory which hee did see comming towards him, euen as (sayd hee) the ancient Fathers had done, for the victories which GOD had sent them: hee beganne and concluded his oration with a verse of DAVID. Hic est dies quem fecit dominus. &amp;c. But herein the poore man did singe like vnto the swanne. The said

GRAFFINS yeelded to this sentence, and sought no redresse. The second sentence was the 28. of Iuly in the said yeare 1552. against the President PELISSON: by the which it was sayd, that the decrees contained therein, and impugned by TABOVE made by the said President, were false and falsly framed: declaring the said President, for euer incapable to hold any royall Office, condemning him to aske mercie of GOD, the King and of Iustice, and to paie a thousand pounds fine to the King and two hundred to TABOVE, his goods to bee forfited, and to passe the remaynder of his life where it should please the King. The solemnity of the pronouncing and execution thereof was: that the sayd President, hauing one halfe of his bodie be-nummed with the palsey, olde and broken with age, diseases and cares, was brought into the open Court, the doores beeing open, and the Iudges sitting in the Castell of Dijon, where he was prisoner, by two Archers in a chaier, attired in blake taffata pinckt, with a roabe of blacke satten, a little night-cappe of silke, and his square cappe in his hand. At this spectacle and in his presence, TABOVE made a speech. The sentence was afterwards pronounced, &amp; the poore old man was constrained with much a doe, and through the helpe of his gards (that had brought him) to kneele downe, holding in his hands a burning torch of wax weighing 4. pounds and asked pardon of GOD: the King: of Iustice; and of TABOVE. The saied decrees and other peeces that were impugned were torne in his presence, which done he intreated the Court that hee might bee freed out of the Castell for the weakenesse and great infirmity of his person. Answere was made him, that the Court would consider of it. The third sentence was the fourth

of August, against the aboue named BOISSONNE a Preest and Councellor, by the which hee was found guiltie of fals-hood and other crimes mentioned in his processe, and the decrees, declarations, and other pe
                  •…
               ces declared false; depriued of his Councellors place, and condemned in a hundred pounds fine to the King, and fortie pounds to TABOVE, and his charges: and to remaine a prisoner, and for the common offence, he was sent vnto his Ordinary. The fourth sentence was the same daie against ROZET an other Councellor, all one with the former.
            After all this, the sayd President, BOISSONNE and ROZET Councellors, hauing a firme confidence in thē
               selues that they had not offended, notwithstanding these punishments, they go vnto the King and shewe him, that if the crimes, whereof they are condemned bee proued true, it were a monstrous thing to see them liue in a common-weale. But if through the slander of their accuser, they haue beene reduced vnto that extremity; there is no reason, (for the dignity where-with his Maiesty had honored them in the Soueraignty of Sauoie,) that the cause should be referred to one Parliament aloane, consisting of a small number, to degrade and depriue them in that sort, of their good names, fortunes, and honours, leauing them nothing but their soules, which is onely a remainder of greefe and perpetuall sorrowe. They beseech him to allowe of a reuision, the which is g
                  •…
               aunted, and the cause committed to the Parliament of Paris: whereas all being wel viewed and examined, it was said and iudged by a sentence of the sixteene of May 155
                  •…
                that the former decres of the 28. of Iuly and the fourth of August, were voide and that the cryminall processe,

by the which they had beene giuen, should be viewed and Iudged a newe, without any respect to bee taken of the said decrees, &amp; TABOVE condemned in costs, domage and interests. The Court at Dijon, aduertised of this decree, at the instance of TABOVE, beeing much troubled in the beginning, come vnto the King, debate the reasons, and maintaine their decrees, she wing that it would cause impunity of crimes of importance, and blemish the prerogatiue of his Parliaments. They had good audience, with the sayd TABOVE, who pretended new matter, and concealed nothing which hee thought might auaile him: alledging that this accusation framed by him, was alwaies with the quality of the Kings Atturney general, being so receiued and neuer reproued, and therefore hee ought not to bee condemned in costs, domages and interests, like vnto a priuate party, although the accusation were not so well grounded as this was. Some of the Court Parliament of Paris, which had assisted at the resolution of the said decree of nullity, were sent for; they come, and are heard with them of Dijon.
            
            All being duly examined, it was decreed by the Priuy Councell the 7. day of March. 1555. that the sentence giuen the 16. of May, vpon the said Nullities, should take effect, and touching the principall cause, the parties should be sent to the Court of Paris, to bee iudged in the presence of a President, and two Councellors of the Court, named in the decree, and three other Councellors hauing assisted at the iudgement of the said Nullities; three Councellors of the Parlament of Dijon, named by the said decree, aud three others of the sayde Court of Dijon which had assisted at the iudgement giuen against the parties accused, and by sixe Masters of

Requests. The Processe beeing in question, TABOVE, (fearing that which after happened to fortifie his accusation, or rather to hinder the decision) frames newe crimes, whereof no mention had beene made in the former Processe: whervnto the parties accused oppose. Wherevpon the King by his Letters Pattents of the 15. of September the same yeare, made a declaration, that sending them to the Parliament of Paris, his meaning was not that the Court should take knowledge of any other cause or crimes, then those for the which the parties had been condemned in the Court of Parlament at Dijon, and whereof they had complayned vnto the King: the Kings Atturney generall excepted, who vpon view of the sayd Processe, finding the accused to bee guilty of other crimes, might make pursute against them at his pleasure. Moreouer they were charged by the said Letters to do right vpon the repetition of money, adiudged to the said TABOVE, for the pursute of the Processe. The said letters were allowed and regestred the 18. of September. The Parties accused are againe examined and heard by the Court, vpon the crimes wherewith they were charged. TABOVE is allowed to make newe productions, and the accused to contradict them. In the ende this cause being examined in so goodly an Assembly, a definite sentence was giuen in these termes that follow.
            The Court doing right to all, and without respect to the quality of the Atturney general in the court of Chambery, taken by the said TABOVE in the sayd Processe: but so farre as it doth touch the corruptions and falseties pretended by TABOVE against the sayd PELISSON BOISSONNE and ROZET, had absolued and did absolue

the sayd PELISSON, BOISSONNE and ROZET respectiuely, of the sayd pretended false-hoods, and did condemne the sayd TABOVE, for that respect, in the charges of the same sute and in domages and interest of the sayd PELISSON, BOISSONNE and ROZET: which domages and Interests, the Court for some causes them mouing, hauing taxed and moderated, that is to say to the sayd PELISSON two hundred pounds; to BOISSONNE foure score pounds; and to ROZET the like some of 80. pounds: and that, besids all other expences, domages and Interestes, which were adiudged vnto them by a sentence of the 16. of May 1555. for the paiement of which domages and interestes the said TABOVE should remaine in prison. And as for all other accusations and crimes obiected by the sayd TABOVE against PELISSON, BOISSONNET and ROZET, (the knowledge whereof was referred to the sayd Court) both they &amp; the parties were discharged by the Court, and freed from farther sute, without any charges, domage, or interest of eyther party: reseruing notwithstanding power for the Kings Attorney generall, to proceed against the sayde decrees of the 11. of May 1539. the 9. of March, the 20. of September, made in fauour of the sayd Earles of La Chambery, and Bishop of Morienne, by way of Nullitie, and for them to make their defences to the contrary.
            And for reparation of the false and slanderous accusa tion, framed by the sayd TABOVE, against PELISSON, BOISSONNE, and ROZET, and for other misd
                  •…
               meanors, appearing as wel by the ancient as the later productions, made in the sayde processe, the Court had condemned the sayde TABOVE to doe penance in open

Court, on a day of pleading, the doores being open, bare-headed, and bare-foote, on his knees, in his shert, and a halter about his neck, holding in his hands a burning Torche of two pound waight: and then to say and declare openly with a lowd and intelligeble voyce, that falsely, maliciously, slanderously, wrongfully, and against the truth, hee had charged and accused the saide PELISSON, BOISSONNE and ROZET of the sayde pretended falseties, crimes and offences, for the which he was sorry, and desired pardon &amp; mercy of GOD, the King, the Iustice, and of the said PELISSON, BOISSONNE and ROZET.
            And moreouer the Court did ordaine, that the petitions and complaints exhibited vnto the King by the sayd TABOVE, together with the suggestions of falshood made by him against the said parties, should be defaced and rent in his presence. And this done, to bee led in the same sort by the Vshers of the Court, and set vpon the marble Stone, being at the end of the Great Stayres of the Pallace, there to do the like penance, and so to be carted from the same place vnto the Pillorie at the Halles in the Cittie of Paris, and there being set by the Hang-man to bee turned thrice about, and then to be carryed backe to the Concergery or prison of the Pallace. And moreouer the Court did condemne the said TABOVE to do penance in the open Court of the said Parlament of Chambery, whether he should be safely conducted, and to pay two hundred pounds for a fine vnto the King, and to continue in prison at Chambery, vntill the full payment of the fines, charges, domage and interest adiudged, as well to the King; as to the said parties: after which payment made, to bee perpetually

confined to the said Country of Sauoy, or to any other place within this Realme that should please the King. And moreouer the Court did declare his other goods confiscate to whom they did belong, the said fines, charges, domage and interests being first payed and discharged. And for certaine causes and considerations then mouing the said Court, did ordaine, that the saide PELISSON should be sent backe, to receiue those admonitions that were appointed to bee giuen him, inioyning him to keepe and cause to bee kept the Kings royall ordynances in the said Court of Chambery, and not to infringe them vpon paine of an arbitrary punishment. Giuen in the Parlament at Paris, the eleuenth of October. 1556.
            No Reader of iudgement, ought to taxe the Iudges, who haue censur'd this cause with so great contrarietie, as the like hath not beene heard. The Court of Dijon assured themselues in their conceits to doe well without fraud or malice. Those of Paris according to their custome, shewed their authority, which is supreme; descouering (it may be) some thing that was newe, and not before knowne. It is not for mee, beeing a simple Collector, and who feares to speake of such assemblies, to giue any reasons of the said contrarieties. It sufficeth to set downe the fact, and to compare the greatnesse of the Parlament of Paris with the rest, yet I may not conceale, what I heard a Councellour of one of the aboue named Parliaments say, that (in the question of Iustice of such contrary decrees, vpon a crime pleaded before the King, who desired to vnderstand the truth) those of Dijon had iudged according to their consciences, and those of Paris iustly and according vnto Lawe.

Before I leaue this matter which is so exemplary and of such consequence, in regard of many the like accidents which do dayly happen, I will aduise the Reader to obserue the ende of this accusation, where the Hunts-man is taken in his owne snare.
            This poore ACTEON, relying vpon his quality, and gouerned by his passions, came to this ende, hauing drawne many great personages into danger: for seeking reuenge onely, hee ruined himselfe. The which may serue for any one that shall attempt to accuse an other. He was the Kings Attorney Generall, in a soueraigne Court, and therfore a publike Accusor; and in this quality, he had power to informe against all such as he knew to be Offendors, without feare of the like punishment. (L. omnes de dela
                     •…
                  oribus lib. 10. c.) But he was found vnfurnished of parts required in that place, beeing transported by his passions and surprized in slander. In which case, without respect of his quality and place, hee was subiect to the punishment of a Slanderer. (L. si cautiones C. de ijs qui accu. non pos.) Whereas doing his duty according to the necessity of his place, and no otherwise, he needed not to haue feared any thing. And as it is most profitable (as it appeares by the continuall complaints against all sorts of Offendors) to haue speciall men for the defence and preseruation of the common-weale, of Lawes and good manners, and to accuse Malefactors: so it is necessary they be Diligent, Constant, Iust, of a good life and singular integrity. For he that will take vpon him the charge to accuse, must first examine exactly, and make proofe of his owne life, before hee shall examine and search anothers: and must thinke, that in the end hee shall reape shame and disgrace, in seeking to

cause an other to yeeld an accoumpt of his life, when as he himselfe is subiect to the like triall. In this case the accusers simplicitie imports much: who ought to bee free from hatred, reuenge and other passions, which are contrary to the sinceritie required in those places: for that it is hard to haue a sound iudgement with such passions, the which do hinder the true office of an accuser, which is, that in accusing any one hee should no lesse feare the touch of his owne honor and good name, then the partie accused the preseruation of his life and goods: and the accuser (if he be an honest man) must thinke and beleeue, that in beginning to accuse, he brings his owne honour in question, which should make him carefull not to propound any thing, whereof he is not assured. To this end the (l. criminis C. de ijs qui accus. non pos.) is not able and worthy to bee often read, the which comprehends the said parties. It is likely that the Iudges at Chambery were linkt together in many things, and that TABOVE being froward, and reiecting some admonitions that were giuen him, framed this accusation against his head and President, who had power to command him, and vnder whom he did exercise his place of Kings Atturney generall, of whom he should haue endured some-thing, considering that the dissimulation of iniuries, which he pretended to haue suffered in his owne particular of the said president, would haue done him more honour, and giuen him greater content, then the reuenge which hee got by a sentence at Dijon, although it had taken effect. The conflict of men of that sort is vniust and inhumaine: and hath been in old time reproued at Rome in many iudgements. L. PHILO seeking to accuse C. SERVILIVS his Pretor and commander, whose Treasurer

he had beene, was not admitted. The like was adiudged against M. AVRELIVS for L. FLACCVS his Generall. T. ALBVTIVS had gouerned the Sardes a yeare, vnder whome POMPEY was Treasurer. They had carried themselues after different manners: ALBVTIVS like a Theefe, and POMPEY like an honest man. The Sardes made their complaints to I. CAESAR, accusing ALBVTIVS, POMPEY hindred, saying, that hee was best reformed of his life, for that he had beene alwayes with him, and serued him as his Treasurer, demanding the charge to accuse him from the which hee was reiected. CICERO in his first accusation against VERRES, to obtaine the place of an Accuser, and to keepe Q. CECILIVS, (who presented himselfe) from audience, he obiected the three principall reasons before mentioned. The first, that hee was not free from blame himselfe, and namely in the gouernment of VERRES, vnder whom hee had had charge in Sicilia. The second, that he professed himselfe his enemie, and therefore transported with affection, which is alwayes to bee suspected. The third, that VERRES is his Commander and Pretor, and therefore cannot bee accused by him, without violating all publike respect of honestie. In the Processe made by NONIVS the black Prouost of Rome against CATELYNS confederates, it was taken ill, that the sayd NONIVS in his Interrogatories, had examined the prisoners: if IVLIVS CAESAR (being then Pretor) were not of the conspiracie: for the Pretoriall dignitie which hee then held, the which was one of the highest, and equall with the Consull: for the which the Prouost was blamed and committed to prison, although that one of the prisoners had named

CAESAR, and that he was presently to prouide for the preseruation of the common-weale, the which might well allowe the accusation of a Magistrate during his time, especially by one of his familie, who had beene commanded. The which the Lawe hath declared intollerable, and worthy of punishment, as it appeares in L. si quis ex familiaribus, (and in the last law.) C. de ijs qui accus. non pos: whereas the Emperours declare such absolutions abhominable, excepting no crime but treason. To conclude, Vocem familiarium funestam amputari potius volunt quam audiri, I haue set downe this Historie at large, for that it is famous.

               I Haue seene in a Towne of Breslaw, a Midwiues Daughter lying in Childbed, who had such aboundance of Milke in her brests: as in two or three dayes shee filled a pale, contayning twelue quartes.

                  IAMES the fourth of that name King of Scotts, hauing in the yeare 1500. or thereabout, defied HENRY the eight King of England: as hee was riding towards his army, being at Euening praier in a Church at Limnuch, there came in an olde man, his hayre somewhat reddish and hanging downe on his shoulders, bald before and without an hat, apparelled in a long blew roabe, and girded with a Linnen girdle, bearing a graue and reuerent presence: who desiring to speake with the King, made way through the prease, and without any other ceremony, went and leaned on the Chaire where the King sate: saying vnto him. Sir, I am sent vnto you, to admonish you to desist from your enterprise, and to proceede no farther. If you dispise my aduertisement, ill will come to you and to all your followers. Furthermore I am enioyned to tell you, that if you haunt women too familiarly, and follow their counsell, it will turne to your shame and ouerthrowe. Hauing said thus, hee presently thrust himselfe into the presse. Euen-song done, the king made this old-man to be sought for, who could not bee found: and that which is yet worthier obseruation, diuers that had heard him vse those speaches, and desired to vnderstand the particularities, could not perceiue what became of him. Amongst others there presēt, DAVID LINDSEY was one, a learned and a wise man, and of a sound life, who reported this vnto me. Not long after, the King contemning the good aduise of the principal Lords of his Counsel, prosecuting

his deseigne gaue battaile to the English, in the which he was slaine with al the flower of the Nobility of Scotland.

               LEVVIS the second King of Hungary, beeing at Buda, and the Castle gates shut (as the custome is) whilst hee was at dinner, there came one in the likenesse of a deformed cripple, who cried out that hee would speake with the King, to whome hee had matters to impart concerning his great good, and the peace of the whole realme. At first, they made no reckoning of him, according to the manner of the Court, where the poore and simple are despised: but hee beganne to weepe and crie out, desiryng that with all speede they would goe and tell the King of him, so as some of the gard mooued with his speeches, and to bee rid of the importunate cries of the man (who protested hee would speake to no other eare but the King) went and declared it vnto him. The King commanded one of his brauest Courtiers, to goe and knowe that secret, and to feigne himselfe to be the King. But the cripple said presently vnto him; thou art not the King, I haue nothing to say to thee: and seeing the King makes no more account to heare me, go and tell him he shall perish and that shortly. Pronouncing these words, he vanished away from before them all. The Courtier, the Gard, and the King himselfe, not regarding this, lost their liues a little after in a battaile against the Turkes.

               leman of Piedmont, found that his wife (issued from a meane parentage, whome hee had married for his pleasure,) forgetting the honour of GOD, the honour which her husband had done her, and her owne honour, had execrably poluted the house, chamber, and bed of her Lord and husband, by continual adultery with a Gentleman his neighbour whom shee had wickedly allured to her will. The Lord meaning to take thē in the fact, &amp; that they might pretend no excuse, hee laied many plots, and among the rest, he caused a packet of letters to be broght vnto him, by the which his Prince called him to Court, meaning to send him into France, where hee should remaine some time. He imparts these letters vnto his wife, continues a whole day with her; makes very much of her: acquaints her familiarly with the whole estate of his affaires: leaues her meanes, Iewells &amp; all that was precious in his house; and after a louing faire-wel, he departs with al his traine. At night he staies with one that kept a Castell of his, and descouers vnto him his misfortune and his deseigne. In the meane time this wicked woman had sent for her Adulterer, who being shut vp in one chamber, continued their filthy life. The Lord being followed onely by this keeper of his Castell and a grome of his Chamber, well armed, and furnished of all things necessary, in a darke night they came vnto the Castell, where the Chastelane made himselfe knowne vnto the Porter, saying that hee had letters of importance from his Lord, the which he

must deliuer presently to his Lady. The Porter opes the gate presently to one so well knowne, &amp; sodenly al enter. The Lord forbids the Porter to make any noise, &amp; commanding him to light a torch, hee goes directly to the Lords Chamber, where the Chastelane did knocke. At this noise, an old woman (who had bin their baude,) asked who was their? It is I answered the Chastelane, who bring a letter vnto my Lady from my Lord, who passing hastely by my house, cōmanded me to bring it with speed. This woman, dronke with her vilany, cōmanded the old womā to receiue the letter at the dore, without entring, and she would performe the contents. The olde woman opening the doore a little, was sodenly ouerthrowne. Thē the Lord and the two others enter armed, and seize vpon the Adulterers being naked, &amp; confused in their shame. The seruants of the house being sodenly called, the Lord hauing giuen a graue and seuere sentence vpon his detestable Wife, condemned her to hang vp her vilanous Adulterer with her owne hands in the presence of them all, hauing bound him hand and foote with halters. This sentance being pronounced, the Lord sent for great Cartnales, the which he caused to be knockt vpon a beame in the Chamber, and calling for a ladder, hee forced this wicked woman to tie the halter about her Adulterers necke. And for that she had neede of helpe in this execution, her Baude was condemned to second her. These two togither did hange vp this wretch, after whose death, the Lord caused the bed to be burnt, and all that did participate of their Adulteries, and commanding all the other mouables of the Chamber to be carried away, he left nothing but a little strawe for these two Mastiues to lie on, appointing that the bodie that was hanged,

should remaine there, and that the two women should keepe it, vntill the stinke of it had choakt them: he caused the windowes and the dore to be walled vp, leauing onely a little hole, by the which they might giue them bread and water. Hauing past some fewe daies in the stench, without consolation, opprest with griefe and dispaire they ended their miserable liues. Written in the Histories of our times.
            
            In our time an Aduocate of Grasse in Prouence, called TOLONIO, married a vertuous young Gentlewoman, he managed the affayres of the Signior of Chabrie. A Gentleman liuing in a Castle not farre from thence, comming one day among many vnto this Gentlemans house, who was then absent. Hauing familiar accesse to him and to the Lady (who was about fortye yeares old, and the Mother of foure children, whereof two were with her, young Gentlemen well bred) he went vp into the Chamber, and found this Lady in bed: beeing set downe by her, after hee had acquainted her with some businesse for the which hee was come vnto the Castle, they entred into strange and detestable discourses, against the honour of GOD, and all respect of honour and vertue. The end was that from that time they poluted themselues with a horrible and infamous Adultery.

                hauing made many practises together, the first attempt of their cruell wickednesse, was against the Signior of Chabrie, who was massacred, walking alone in his warren, by two murtherers subordned by the Aduocate. After this paracide, the

Adulterers returne to their accustomed filthye course▪ without all shame or remorce, giuing scope to theyr execrable lusts: the which the eldest son
                  •…
               e could not disgest: and seeing his mother could not liue any where without the Aduocate, hee gaue her a graue admonition, adding many reasons to excuse his boldnesse. This cursed mother dissembling her rage against her Sonne, complaynes of his conceit, iustifies her selfe impudently: and these drops of water of good and necessary aduice, did more inflame the fire of their vnbridled lust. After shee had bitterly reprehended the indiscretion of her Sonne, and highly extolled the Adulterous and Murtherous Aduocate, she forced her sonne to make a submissiue speech vnto him full of excuses. But not content herewith she resolued to kill him. There was a Gallery in the Castle, whereas the yong Gentleman did vsually walke, to behold the Gardin and pleasant countrie about. It was high aduanced, and hung ouer a steepe Rocke, at the foote whereof lay this Garden. The Aduocate by the aduice of this cursed Mother, did cunningly loosen certaine boards in the Gallery, so as the young Gentleman comming soone after in the morning (according to his custome) to take the aire of this prospect, setting his foote vpon these disioynted boards, hee fell down head-long where his brains were beaten out. This was the second murther.
            
            A yonger sonne was yet remayning in the house, who doubting nothing that his Mother had beene the cause of these two Parricides, was yet greeued to see the Aduocates carriage: In the ende hee descouered so much villany in their familiarity, as he held them to bee the cruell murtherers of that noble Familye, making some

shew of his discontent, to see their brutish conuersation. Hee speakes roughly to the Aduocate, and lookes but sowerly of his Mother. These wicked wretches resolued to preuent him, fearing that he would attempt something against them. The Aduocate corrupts one in the house with money to murther him, who obserued this young Gentleman so diligently, as one day being a hunting, whilest his Hunts-men rewarded his Hounds, hee staying vpon the side of a Rocke, which ouer-looked a lowe champian, the descent whereof was very dangerous towards the valey, by reason of the steepnesse. This murtherer, who had all the day watcht for an aduantage, did runne behinde him, and thrust him downe so forceably, as this poore Gentleman was sooner at the bottome slaine, then hee felt the murtherer, who had so outragiously murthered him. These murtherers after all this (finding that the seruants of the house, did marke and obserue them,) did practise to mar

They conspire her death, and the Aduocate (hauing many imaginations) lying one night by her, he strangled her with a Napkin, and shee being ready to giue vp the ghost, he began to crie out aloud, and to call for his seruants and neighbours to helpe him. They come from all parts, and he cryes and laments, saying, that a violent Catarre had suffocated his wife. The simple and vulgar sort beleeued this report. But the father of this honest Gentlewoman, looking neerely into it, and seeing her face extraordinarily swelled, and her throate black and pale, with other signes of a violent death, seemed to allow of their opinions: and hauing perswaded his Sonne in lawe to prouide for his Wiues funerall, hee went

speedily to the criminall Iudge, and brought him with his officers and some friends, to visit this poore carcase, and to demand Iustice. The Sonne in Lawe being accused, and charged by the Magistrate to answer directly, is mute, and by his silence confesseth the crime: the Phisitions and Surgions hauing giuen their opinion, that the Gentlewoman had been strangled. The Iudge sends this execrable Parricide to prison, who without any torture confesseth the fact. The Parliament of Aix aduertised of this fact, sends for him to see him. As for his detestable associate, hauing some notice thereof, she packs vp the greatest wealth she had, and flyes speedily into Sauoy, &amp; from thence to Genoa, where she changed her name. The Aduocate, being brought to Aix, (besides his last Parricide) confesseth the detestable crimes before mentioned with all the circumstances. He was condemned by a sentence of the Court of Parliament, to bee sent backe to Grasse, there to bee quartered aliue in the Market-place, where he was executed, to the great content of his father in Law, and of the whole country. As for that cruell Ladie of Chabrie, shee was condemned by contempt, and executed in picture. In her voyage to Genoa she was accompanied by a base fellow, called IAMES PALLIER, who being some-what iealous of the cause of her flight, a moneth after her cōming to Genoa, in a morning when she was gone into the Towne, he tooke away all she had but the apparrell shee wore, and was neuer more heard of. At her returne, finding her selfe bare and naked, after many discourses, opprest with care and despaire, in the end shee went to serue a Widow woman, whose Daughters she did teach, liuing yet some yeares, confounded in her conscience with shame, and dying

in the hands of GODS Iustice, hauing escaped that of worldly Iudges. The Historie of our times.

He presently discouered whereto this Gentleman tended, yet for a time hee dissembled it.

Sir pardon mee, excepting the respect and duty which I owe you, I see that your intent of comming hether is neither good nor honest, and therefore I intreat you to forbeare to come, else I sweare vnto you, if I find you there any more, I will make you repent it.

            In the yeare, 1506▪ about Christmas, an Aduocate in the Citty of Constance, corrupted an Attorneyes Wife. Who hauing some notice of their detestable crime, feigned that he had some speciall businesse which drew him into the Country for certaine dayes: hee parts and returnes at night, hearing that they were together in a Whot-house at an old womans that dwelt by him: hee

goes thither with three of his friends, whome hee left in the streete, to hinder any that should come to helpe them then hee enters into the house, with a strong Curry-combe of iron, made for the purpose. Hee falls vpon the Aduocate being naked, and curries him so rudely as he puls the eies out off his head, teares off his stones, and almost all the skin of his body: hee did the like vnto his Wife, although shee was with childe. The Aduocate dyed within three dayes in great torment: the Attorney transported himselfe to an other place, and his Wife spent the remainder of her dayes there, confounded with shame and infamy.
            Some yeares before a certaine man making profession to teach chastety to others, did wonderfully importune an honest woman, to depriue her of her honour, &amp; made her to wauer: the husband discontented at this wrong, threatens the other to punish him if hee found him in his house: yet he continues his olde course: so as one daie passing before the doore, the wife (hauing giuen a watch word vnto her husband) began to looke familiarly on him, the which mooued him to followe her euen into her chamber, where the husband enters, who with a naked dagger in his hand, sayd that nowe his time was come for to be gelt, the other changing his feare into fury, fell vpon the husband, takes the dagger from him, and forceth him to promise that he shall suffer him depart freely. Hauing extorted this promise, he leaues his hold, and is so depriued of vnderstanding, as hee laies the dagger, vpon the table. The husband beeing freed, regards not this forced promise, but seazeth sodenly vpon his dagger, and then with a new fury, with the helpe of his wife, laies hold vpon his enemy, binds him fast, and presently

gelds him, and so sends him home bleeding to his lodging, where hauing continued long sicke, in the end hee was cured, but he left running after women.
            A Germains wife of Voitland, was so vnchast and impudent as (of many that did entertaine her) to call three to a banket which shee had prepared for them. But the husband (who had not beene sommoned) came to make it a bloudie feast, for hauing a Pertuisan in his hand, hee entred into the Stoue, kills him that was set neerest vnto his wife: runnes after the two other, who being seized on with feare, leape out at the windoes and so kill themselues. He returnes to his wife, and perceth her through. A Germaine Gentleman hauing dishonestly allured the Wife of a certaine Cittizen, the husband desirous to bee reuenged of this insupportable affront, hid himselfe in a secret corner of his house, and sees his enemy come who continues his insolencies. Night beeing come, these two wretches retier themselues into a chamber, where they sup and lie. The husband comes out of his hole, goes into the kitchin, and being desirous to drinke, he made a noise, in setting the water pot in his place. The wife would haue called vp her seruants, but hearing no more noise, she returned to her Adulterer. In the meane time the husband was entred into the Stoue, to take a Caske and his Curirasse. The wife awakes at this noise; she riseth, comes into the Stoue, and demands who is there. The husband saieth nothing, but followes her so neere, as he enters sodenly into the Chamber, and at the first kills the Gentleman, notwithstanding any resistance he could make with a Pertuisan, which stood neere vnto his bed. His wife had cast her selfe on the other side of the bed, to whom the husband, (discerning her through

the light of a candle) cryed, come out you strumpet, else I will thrust thee through. Shee hauing often cryed him mercy comes forth, and not able to pacifie him, she beseecheth him to suffer her to bee confest and to communicate before she died. Why then, saith he, dost thou repent thee withal thy heart for thy offence. Alas, I: answered she. At that word he thrust her through with his sword: then laying the one by the other, hee shuts the chamber. The next day all was published, and the husband (charged for this execution) by the aduise of his friends, absented himselfe, least hee should fall into the hands of the Gentlemans friends.
            A Gentleman of Hungary, hauing taken one in his chamber that came to commit Adultery with his wife, cast him into a prison, resoluing there to famish him. And to torment him the more, hee caused a rosted Hen to be somtimes presented vnto him, that the smell therof might sharpen his appetit, &amp; make his hunger the more violent: to the end this punishment might hasten his miserable death. Hauing continued sixe dayes in this torment, the seuenth he was visited, where they found that he had eaten the brawnes of both his armes.
            We read the like historie of a Germaine Nobleman in Thuringe, who vsed a Gentleman that had cōmitted adultery in the like sort, who liued 11. daies with the smel of delicate meats that were presented vnto him: his foule offence being punished by this cruell torment. The like is reported by three famous writers, of a man who vnder colour of deuotion did corrupt many women who were before reputed honest: as in old times TYRANNVS SATVRNS Priest did in Alexandria. Beeing discouered and conuicted he was put to death. An other learned man

and of great reputation, (being taken in Adultery) was stab'd and left dead in the Chāber. Among other guifts which he did wickedly abuse, he spake French, Italian, Spanish, Germaine, Polonian and Latine perfectly, &amp; was much fauoured by the Emperor and the Princes, it was about 80. yeares since. About the same time an other famous man seeking to rauish the honour of a Woman, in steed of a Bedde he fell into a Caue, where hee brake his neck.
            A Surgion disdayning his honest wife, had abandoned himselfe to a strumpet. Going on a time to horse-backe and asked by his wife, whether he went, hee answered skornefully. To the Stewes. Going presently to his Adulteresse: after a while hee returnes to Horse, and offring to manage his round, the Horse leapes and bounds, and casts this wretched Man out off the saddle in such sort, as one of his feete hung in the Bridle: The Horse being hot, beganne to runne so furiously vpon the stones as hee beat out his braines, and neuer stayed vntill he came before the Stewes, where this miserable man remained dead vpon the place.
            In the yeare 1533. a certaine man in the towne of Clauenne in the Grisons Country, hauing lookt vpon a faire yong Maide with an vnchast eye, he tryed often to corrupt her. Hauing no meanes to obtaine his desire, vnder the colour of apparitions and reuelations, abusing the sacred name of GOD, and of the blessed Virgin, after an execrable manner (the which I will forbeare to report, for that I will not offend the eye nor eare of any honest and deuout Reader) he seduced this poore maide who hauing too late descouered the Imposture, the wretch was committed to prison, notwithstanding the

allegation of his order, immunities and freedome, and beheaded publikely, and his body burnt to Ashes.

               IT is put in the number of the wonders of Nature, the flying and ballancing of those which runne and guide themselues vpon a rope. Some few yeares since, there was one well knowne throughout all Italy, called the little Venetian, as well for that he was borne at Venice, as for his small stature, but so nimble and expert to runne vpon a rope without any difficulty, as some-times hee tyed himselfe vp in a Sack, hauing nothing but his hands free, to manage his counterpeize. Some times he put a round Basin vnder eyther foote, or Balls vnder his heeles, and so did runne with an incredible swiftnesse vpon a long rope tyde to the top of a house. Moreouer he was so strong, as with his knee he would b

               eake the thigh bone of an Oxe, how bigge soeuer. With his hands hee would wrest in sunder three great Nayles as big as a mans little finger, as if they had beene soft and plyable. Hee would take vpon his shoulders a beame of aboue twenty foote long, and a foote thick, supporting it long, without any helpe of hands, and then would hee remoue it from one shoulder to an other. THEODORE a Doctor of the Lawe, who had seene these feates of agilitie and force, with many other witnesses, haue reported it vnto mee. A Physition of our time makes mention of the same, or of the like, whom he saith he had seene at Ausbourg. And of an other in Silesia, who with his teeth would take

vp a great Pipe, like vnto the Tunnes in Germanie full of Beere, without any helpe, and cast it ouer his head.
            FERDINAND D' AVALOS Marquis of Pescara, Lieutenant to the Emperour CHARLES the 5. in the Duchie of Milan, had a Spaniard in his troupes called LVPON, who was so strong and so light of foote, as hee would with a sheepe vpon his shoulders, out-runne any man; he was valiant and hardie to attempt and execute any thing, for the confidence he had in his nimble force. The Marquis desiring to be truly informed of the estate of the French Armie, lying then neere vnto him, giues charge vnto LVPON to runne vnto their Campe, to discouer some thing. LVPON bethinking himselfe, takes an Harguebuzier on foote with him, in whome he trusted: and being approched neere vnto the Campe a little before day, hee viewed the scituation thereof, and then comming neere vnto a French Souldior that stood Sentinell, who was not well awake, hee sodenly leapes vpon him: and although the Souldier were strong and of a bigge stature, yet LVPON takes him vp vpon his shoulders, notwithstanding any resistance hee could make, or his crying out for helpe, and carryes him vpon his neeke like a Calue, and so returnes with speed, being supported by his Harguebuzer, who short at them that would approche neare them. Being come vnto the Spanish Campe, hee layde his burthen at the Marquis his feete, who hauing laught his fill at this Stratage

            A Spaniard called PETER, came to Naples in the yeare 1555. where hee made tryall of his force, as followeth. A man that was strong and heauie, satte striding on his right shoulder, and another on his left: on his right arme he carryed a man, and on his left another: Hee had two men vpon his feete, and walked vp and downe with all this burthen, as if hee had not carried any thing. Then b
                  •…
               nding downe his hands, hee caused a man to stand vpon eyther of them: which done, hee stood vp, and raised his hands as high as his head. After this, they bound his hands with a strong corde, the which ten men layde hold off, and standing as firmely as they could, they sought to shake him, but he on the other-side, drawing his hands vnto him, layde them crosse vpon his brest with such violence, as many of the ten fell downe. With his fore-head (as if it had beene with a hammer of Yron) hee did beate a Naile halfe in into a wall, true it is, that he did hurt himselfe a little with that blowe. Stretching forth his arme, hee did shutte his hand so fast, as those ten men together could not force him to open it, nor to bend his arme. Two theeues finding him alone would haue stayed him: but hee tooke them both by the necks, and beats their heads so violently together, as their braines flew out, and they were found dead in that sort vpon the place. Hee had a pleasing aspect, a quicke eye, and a gratious seuere countenance, not too tall, but well proportioned, and his flesh was so firme and synewie, that when hee did stretch forth his arme, and shutte his hand, it was impossible to pinche him. His voyce

was strong and cleere, and hee did sing very well. Hee was no great feeder.
            ANTHONIE of Nebrisse affirmeth, that he had seene a man at Siuille, borne in one of the Ilands of the Canaries, who without retiring his left foote out of a Circle where he did set it, did offer himselfe as a marke to any one that would cast a stone at him eight paces of, and was neuer hitte, for that he did shift and turne himselfe in such sundry sorts and fashions, as it was impossible to touch him, &amp; for a farthing he would shew any mā this sport. Nebris in the 2. Decad of the Hist. of Spaine lib. 2. c. 1.
            We haue seene a man in Italy, marching and dancing on a rope, which was strained in the ayre, holding two long swords, hauing his thighes armed, so as hee was forced to open his legges. He did go firmly and boldly thereon: Then would hee tye Basins to his feete, and with them would run vpon the rope, shewing such nimble tricks, as they seemed impossible to them that had not seene them. SIMON MAYOLVS an Italian Bishop, in his Canicular dayes. Colloq. 4.
            In the yeare 1582. at the sollemnity of the circumcision of Mahomet, the 3. sonne to AMVRATH Emperour of the Turkes, among many other sports, there appeared 50. men on hors-back wel armed, with Cymiters by their sides, their Targets about their necks, bowes in their left hands, and in the right staues like halfe pikes, after the Arabian manner. In the Parke appointed for Iusts at Constantinople, they had raised vp eight hils of sand, of equall heigth and distance, 4. of the one side, &amp; 4. of the other. In the midst there was a narow passage, but wel couered with fine sand, that if any one should chance to fall in running, it might be lesse dangerous: vpon these hils of sand

there were posts set▪ the foure of the one side hauing round blankes at the end, and the other foure had Ouals, all made of Lether and Paper very artificially. These were the markes where at these fifty horsemen did aime, who began to march easily by this way, first in troupe, and then in rankes, as it were in Battell. Sodenly they dis-band, and begin to runne with a full carrier, one after another, so neere and so iustly, as one was at anothers heeles. In running they tooke their Arrowes out of their quiuers, and shot with such dexteritie, as they did hit the markes so swiftly, as the beholders eyes could not discerne the shotte nor the blowes. At the second course, whereas they had shotte but at the round blankes, they now deliuered their Arrowes against both, with a wonderfull dexteritie, some-times vsing the left hand, sometimes the right-hand, with one motion: for the third charge, in shooting off their Arrowes, they some-times discouered the right shoulder, som-times the left, with their Targets, &amp; that with an incredible swiftnes. Moreouer, in running a full carrier, they drew out their Cymiters, and cut these round markes, and carried away the walls, the which was done in one course. Then turning head sodenly, they shott against the markes, &amp; with their Cymiters, which they drew out againe, they beate them downe, and sodenly they bend their bowes againe, and shoote into the ayre. They did wonders with their halfe pikes, in diuers kinds of Combates, and in the end they made euen these hills with their Cymiters, pulling away those stakes that were set vpon the hills of Sand; they cast them into the ayre, and in running, they receiued them againe, and held them in their hands. Then standing vpon their feete in the Saddle, they began to

runne, and to handle their Cymiters, bowes and staues as before, without any further repetition of these particularities, I will noate one notable Act, the which perchance wilbe held a fiction: but I did see it. Of these fifty there were two goodly yong men which withdrewe themselues from the rest. The one stood vpright in his saddle, and bare his companion standing vpon his armes. Beeing in this posture, they runne the horse a full carrier, and yet stood fast, yea the vppermost shot certaine arrowes at a peele of wood which he that carried him held in his right hand. Moreouer these two hauing tied two horses togither by the bridle, one of them set one foote vpon one saddle and an other vpon the other, standing as firmely vpon both as if they had beene glued togither, and carrying his Companion vpright vpon his armes, and holding in his hand that peele of woode, against the which the other standing aloft, shot without missing, whilest that the two horses did r
                  •…
               nne most swiftly.
            There were others which hauing sixe naked Cymiters tied the points vpward, vnto their saddles, set their heads into the saddle, and their heeles vpward and in this sort did runne their horses so swiftly, as you would say they had flowē Besides their were two that did sit in one saddle, and as the horse did runne in his full speed, they would leape downe and vp againe presently. Others did turne in their saddles, their horses running swiftly sometimes behinde, sometimes before, doing admirable trickes. This done the
                  •…
                did all runne in troupe and standing vpright in their saddles they shot many arrowes. To end the sport, standing thus vpright, they did run one at an other with their halfe pikes, doing many exercises,

which Lanciers are accustomed to do in their Courses on hors-backe. To conclude, whatsoeuer is done in skirmishes, Courses, Combats; Duells, Battailes, Retreats, and other militarie Acts, was there practised by these fiftie Caualiers.

            At this feast of the Turkish Circumcision, many dancers vpon the roape made goodly proofes of their dexterity▪ but there was one which wonne the spurres from all the rest. I knowe no man but was rauished, seeing him runne so swiftly, with so good a grace, and without stay. An ancient Poet said in one of his Commedies, that the vulgar sort were amazed to see one that went vpon a Roape. But if this Poet had seene one like vnto this, hee would haue beene amazed for he mounted vpon Roapes tied vnto Piramides, to the heighest that might be seene, with such celerity as any one would haue thought they had beene steppes or degrees: then hee came downe back-wards, or vpon his belly, hauing no other support but a small staffe which serued him as a Counterpeze. Sometimes hee leaped vpon the Roape with both feete, sometimes with one, then imbracing the Roape with both his feete, he hung downe-ward, and turning about, raised himselfe againe. Hee did slide with a strange resolution, from the toppe vnto the bottome, and that which I esteeme most in this agilety, at night he would tie sixe naked Cymiters to either foote, and continued his sport by torch-light with such admiration and applause of all the world, as if happely any of the Spectators had desire to sleepe, this man by his admirable agility did

presently awake him. So as by the generall consent of great and small in this sollemne Assembly, he was called the chiefe maister of his art.

            I haue often seene with amazement, in the Court of the Prince of Bamberg, a Germaine peasant, norrished &amp; bred vp (as he himselfe did aduowe) among the beasts in the neere Mountaines, who was so actiue and nimble of his body, as all that did see him in his motions and tumbling, were amazed, &amp; thought that he vsed some inchātment: the which hee neuer drempt of. That which was most to be admired in him, he shewed his nimblenes, not standing vpon his feete, but going vpō feete &amp; hands, like a Dog or a Cat. In the same Court there was a Duarfe which

               id vpon the peasant as if hee had bin a horse, making him to turne and bound, in diuers manners, as a rider would do a Genet of Spaine: but when the Peasant list, he would ouerthrowe the Dwarfe do what he could. Sometimes he would fight with mastiues &amp; great English dogs which his Prince had, and by a certaine counterfet barking and a furious doggish snarling, he would make them runne away. This done he would bound vpon his hands and his feete, with a wonderfull agility clyming vp, at the Corners and on the wainscot of the hall more nimbly then an Ape although otherwise hee was rude, big, and of a heauy moulde. I did twise see (being at the Princes table) after that he had cast downe the Dwarfe, and chased away the dogges he leaped vpon one of the guests shoulders, and from thence to the Table, without ouerthrowing of dish or goblet, and then hee leaped so sodenly downe, as you would haue iudged him to haue beene a squirrell or a wild-cat; Hee would vsually

runne as fast vpon the toppes of houses built pointed and sloape, as our house Catts would do. Hee did so many other Apish trickes, as in diuers places they talked of him, as of an extraordinary thing and not heard of I would not haue set any thing downe in this booke, if I had not seene his trickes with mine eyes, and that there were not many credible persones yet lyuing that had seene them. When I collected my Historical discourses, he was then lyuing and married. PH. CAMERARIVS a learned germaine LAVVIER, in his Historicall meditations. Chap. 75.

AMBR. PARE. in his 13. booke. Chap. 11. The Lord of Montaigne saieth, that hee had seene his Father (being aboue three score yeares olde) laugh at their actiuities; hee would leape into the saddle, with a furred night-gowne aboute him: he would turne about the table vpon his thombe and did seldome go to his chamber, but he would leape three or foure steppes at once.

               THis tale displeased me, the which a great person tould of a kins-man of mine, a man well knowne both in peace and warre. That dying very olde in his Court tormented with extreame paine of the stoane, he spent all

his latter houres in great care, to dispose of the honor and ceremonie of his Interment: and did coniure all Noblemen that did visit him, to assist at his funeralls: yea hee made an instant sute vnto this Prince, who went to see him when

               ee was drawing on, that his seruants might bee commanded to accompany him, alledging many examples and reasons, to proue that it was a thing which belonged to a man of his sort: hee seemed to depart content, hauing obteined this promisse, disposing according to his owne minde of the order of his shew. I haue not often seene a vanitie more permanent. It is an other contrary curiositie (whereof I want no familiar examples) which seeme cousin-germaine vnto this, to goe studying with passion, of this last act, to dispose of his funeralls after a priuate and vnaccustomed kinde of thrift, with one seruant and a Lanthorne.

            A meruaylous Apparition.
            
               A Personage worthy of credit, that had trauailed in diuers parts of Asia and Egipt, affirmed to many, that hee had seene more then once in a certaine place neere vnto Caire (whether a number of people resort on a certaine day in the moneth of March, for to be spectators of the resurrection of the flesh, as they say) of bodyes deceased, shewing and thrusting themselues as it were by little and little out of the ground: not that they see them altogether, but now the hand, then the feete, sometimes halfe the body: which done, they in like manner

hide themselues by little and little againe in the ground. The rest not giuing credit to such a meruaile, and I for my part desiring to vnderstand the truth of it, enquired of a Kins-man and singular friend of mine, a Gentleman as thoroughly accomplished in all vertues as may be: one that hath beene brought vp in great honours, and that is almost ignorant of nothing. Hee hauing trauailed in the aforesaid countries with another Gentleman, a great and familiar friend also of mine, named the Lord ALEXANDER of Schullembourg, tolde mee hee had heard of many, that this apparition was most certaine: and that in Cairo and other places of Egipt, there was no question made of it. And the more to assure mee, hee shewed mee an Italian booke, Imprinted at Venice, contayning diuers descriptions of voyages, made by the Embassadors of Venice into many parts of Asia and Affrica: among the which one is entituled, Viaggio de Messer Aluigi di Giouanni di Alessandria nelle Indie. Towards the ende whereof I haue extracted certaine lines Translated out of Italian into Latin (and now into English) as hereafter followeth.
            On the 25. of March, in the yeare 1540. diuers Christians, accompanyed with certaine Ianissaries, went from Cairo to a little barren mountaine, some halfe a mile off, designed in times past for buriall of the dead: in the which place euery yeare there vsually assembles an incredible multitude of people, for to see the dead bodyes there interred, as it were issuing out of their Graues and Sepulchers. This begins on Thursday, and continues till Satterday, when they vanish all away. Then may you see bodyes wound in

their sheetes, after the ancient manner, but they are not seene standing vpright, nor going, but onely the armes or thighes, or some other part of the body, which you may touch. If you go a little way off, and come by and by againe, you shall finde that those armes, or other members, appeare farther out of the ground. And the more you change place, the more do those motions appeare diuers and greater. At that time there are a number of pauilions pitched about the mountaine, for both sick and whole, which repaire thither in great troupes firmely beleeue that whosoeuer washeth himselfe on the Thursday night, with a certaine water that runnes in a marish hard by, it is a sure remedy to recouer and maintaine health. But I haue not seene that miracle. It is the report of the Venetian. Besides the which we haue a Iacobin of Vlmes, named FELIX, who hath trauailed in those parts of the Leuant, and hath published a Booke in Dutch touching all that hee hath seene in Palestina and Egipt. He makes the very same recitall. As I haue not vndertaken to maintaine this apparition to be miraculous, for to confound these superstitious idolaters of Egipt, and to shew them that there is a resurrection and life to come: neither will I refute it, nor maintaine it to be a Satanicall illusion, as many thinke, but will also leaue it to the iudgement of the Reader, for to determine thereof as he shall thinke good.

diuers Countries of Turkey and Aegipt, made me an ample discourse of the apparition before mentioned, some fifteene yeares since, affyrming hee had beene spectator of it with CLAVDE ROCARD, an Apothecary of Chably in Champagne, and twelue other Christians, hauing for their truchman and guvde a gold-smith of Ottranto in Apulia, called ALEXANDER MANIOTTI.
            He told mee moreouer, that he (as the rest) had touched diuers members of those ress

               stitants. And as hee was taking hold on the heare of a Childes head, a man of Cairo cryed out, Kali, Kali, antè matarasdè: that is to say; let it alone, let it alone, thou knowest not what thou doest: Now for-asmuch as I could not well perswade my selfe that there was any such matter as he told me of, though in diuers other reports, conferred with that which is to be read in our moderne Authors, I had alwaies found him simple and true, wee continued a long time in this opposition of my eares to his eyes, vntill the yeare 1591. that hauing shewed him the aboue-sayd obseruations of Doctor CAMERARIVS: Now you may see (sayd he) that I haue told you no fables. And many times since, we haue talked of it with wonder and reuerence of the diuyne wisdome. Furthermore he told mee therevpon that a Christian dwelling in Aegipt, had diuers times recouted vnto him, vpon talke of this apparitiō or resurrection, that he had learned of his grand-father &amp; Father, which their ancestors had reported, hauing receiued it from hand to hand time out of minde, that certayne hundreth yeares agoe, diuers Christians, Men, women, and Children, being assembled in that mountayne, for to do some exercise of their Religion, were enuironned and compassed about by a great number of their

enemies, the little Mountaines being but of a small circuite) who cut them all in peeces: and hauing couered their bodies with earth, returned to Cairo. Euer since the which, this resurrection hath appeared the space of certaine dayes before and after that of the massacre. Behold a summary of STEVEN DVPLAIS discours

For in the 18. Chapter of the first Booke, he saith, that these apparitions are made in a Mosquee of the Turkes hard by Cairo. There is a fault in the coppy: and it should say Hillock or little Mountaine, not on the banke of Nilus, as BAVMGARTEN writes, but halfe a mile of, as we haue declared.
         
         
            Satanicall Apparitions.
            
               WHen I studied the lawe in the Vniuersitie of Wittenberge. I heard my Tutors often tell, that on a time, one being attyred after a strange manner, came and knocked at the dore of a great Diuine, which then read in the same Vniuersitie, and dyed in the yeare 1546. the seruant opened the doore, and asked him what he would haue? Speake with thy Maister quoth hee. The Diuine willed him to come in: and then this stranger propounded certaine questions touching the controuersies which were at that instant about matters of Religion: wherevnto the Diuine hauing giuen a ready solution, the stranger put forth

harder, thou dost somewhat trouble me, said the Diuine, for I had other things in hand: and there-with rising out off his chaire, shewed him in a booke the exposition of a certaine place where-about they contended. In this strife he perceiued that the stranger in steede of fingers had clawes and tallents, like a bird of prey. Wherevpon hee began to say vnto him. Is it thou then? Hearken to the sentence pronounced against thee: (shewing him that place of the third of Genesis) The Seede of the woman shall breake the Serpents head. He added moreouer. Thou shalt not swallow vs all vp. The euill spirit mightely confounded &amp; enraged, vanished away with an exceeding great noyse, leauing such a stinke behind him in the Stoue, that it stunke of it a long time after.

            In the towne of Friburg in Misnia, the Diuel presented himselfe in a humane forme, to a certain sick-man, shewing him a booke, &amp; exhorting him to recon vp all his sins he could remember, because he would note them down in that booke. At the first the sick-man was some-what amazed, but recouering his spirits, he answered: Thou saist well, I will set thee downe all my sins in order: but first write these words on the top in great Letters, The Seede of the Woman shall breake the Serpents head. The Diuell hearing this condemnation of his, fled away, leauing ths house full of an extreame stinke.

the Diuell appeared vnto him in the shape of a Man, and intreated him to giue him leaue to confer with him: whervpon he began to poure out horrible blasphemies against the Sauiour of the World. TONER resists and confutes him so coragiously by authorities out of the holy Scripture, as this wicked Spirit confounded, (leauing an intollerable stinke in the place) vanished away.

            Diuers Apparitions in the Ayre.
            
               IN the yeare a thousand fiue hundred, there was seene in Alsatia, neare to Sauerne, a Bulls head, and betwixt the hornes shined a very great star. In the same yeare, on the 21 of May, there was seene ouer the Towne of Lucerne in Suisserland, a fierie Dragon, horrible to behold, as big as a Calfe and twelue foote long, the which did fly towards the bridge of the riuer of Russe which passeth there. In the yeare 1503. in the Duchy of Bauiere, ouer a little towne called Visoc, was seene a Dragon crowned, casting f

                  lan, in the day time, the Heauens beeing cleare, were seene many stars shining very brightly.
            In the beginning of Ianuary in the yeare 1514. about eight of the clocke in the morning, in the Duchy of Witemberg were seene 3. Suns in the firmament: that in the middest was much bigger then the rest. All three caried the forme of a long sword, of a shining colour &amp; markt with bloud, the points whereof d

               d stretch out far. This happened the 12 day of the month. The next day ouer the towne of Rotuil, there was seene a Sunne shewing a

terrible face, enuironed with circles of diuers coulours. Two dayes before, and the 17. of March following were seene three Sunnes: and three Moones also the 11. of Ianuary, and the 17. of March. IAMES STOSEL a Phisition of Memming made an ample discourse, prognosticating vppon these apparitions, which were followed by great troubles, namely in Swaube. In the yeare 1517. on Christmas day, about the Abbey of Vinaire in Saxony, at midnight, the Heauens beeing cleere and bright, there was seene a Crosse of a reddish coulour.
            In September, in the yeare 1520. at Vienna in Austria, there were seene many prodigious signes in the heauen. The first day from three of the clock afternoone, vntill fiue, the Sunne was seene enuironed with two great circles. Three dayes after about noone, there was seene a burning Forke. The fift day in the morning there appeared three Sunnes, with many Rayn-bowes of diuers fashions. The sixt daye about nine of the clocke at night, the Moone appeared full, trauersed with a Crosse, compassed in with a Circle, and aboue it a halfe Circle. On the seauenth, at the breake of day, were seene three Sunnes againe: and from sixe of the clock vntill seauen a Rain-bowe with three Moones. PAMPHILVS GENGENBACH caused these prodigious Meteors to bee cu

               te, and published a discourse, the which hee sent to the Emperour CHARLES the fift. The same yeare the inhabitants of Wissenbourge, a Towne seated vpon the Riuer of Rhine, heard at noone day, such a strange and horrible rushing of armes in the ayre, and such a noyse of men fighting and crying as in a set battell, that it strooke snch a terror and amazement in

them, as all runne to Armes, thinking the Towne had beene beseeged, and that the enemies were at theyr Gates.
            When as the Emperor CHARLES the 5. was crowned in the Citty of Aix la Chapelle, the Sunne was seene enuironed with a great Circle, and a Raine bowe in the Heauens. In the Town of Erfor'd there were three Suns seene. Moreouer a burning Cheuron, the which was terrible, by reason of the greatnesse and length. This Cheuron declining to the earth, made a great spoile, then mounting into the ayre, it was conuerted into a cercular forme, IOB FINCET in his Collection of the maruells of our Time,
                notes, that in the yeare 1523. a Peasant of Hungary, going a iourney with his Wagon, was be-nighted and forced to lie in the fields attending the breake of day. Hauing slept a while, he awaked, and goes out off his Wagon to walke, looking vp into the ayre he did see the resemblance of two Princes fighting, with their swords drawn one against an other. One was of a tall stature and big: the other was lesse and carried a Crowne vpon his head. The greater ouer-threwe and slue the lesse, then hauing taken away the Crowne he threwe it as it were against the earth, so as it was dispersed in diuers peeces. Three years after LADISLAVS King of Hungary was slaine in battell by the Turkes. The same yeare in the month of May, there were three Suns intermixt with diuers circles seene at Zurich in Suisserland. Two yeares after, a little before the defeate of the King of Hungary▪
                three other Sunnes were seene in Hungary, which some did interpret that FERDINAND (after wards King of the Romaines,) the Vaiuode IOHN and the Turke, should be at war for the Kingdome.

In the yeare 1525. there was seene in Saxony, about the death of the Elector FREDER

               C, surnamed the Wise, the Sunne enuironed with a great perfect round Circle, like in coulour to a Rain-bow. In August the same yeare, the Sunne shewed it selfe for certaine dayes like vnto a great Bowle of fire, and of many strange coulours: Soone after followed the sedition of the peasants in Germanie.
            
            In the yeare 1526. neere vnto Kauffburen, a famous Towne in Swaube, there were three Sunnes seene, enuironed with many Circles. And for that there hath beene often mention made, and shall be againe of the apparition of three Sunnes, which they call Paralies. I will tell you what it is, with their generation and signification. About the true S

               nne created by GOD, and making his limitted course in the midest of Heauen, there appeare in the clouds certaine lights, the which in brightnesse and forme resemble the Sunne in such sort; as one would say they were very Sunnes, so as you can hardly discerne the true from these imaginarie ones, called Paralies, Para Helios, as one would say, neere or right against the Sunne. For such shining Images, and fashioned like the Sunne, seeme to be right against it, although they bee many thousand miles vnder it: for the Sunne is in the middest of the Heauens, and the Paralies are in the ayre. Some-times by this name they vnderstand the likenesse of the Moone. And when they appeare, PLINIE sayes they are called night-Sunnes. It is most certaine, that they are made in the clouds, and not in the firmament, which can receiue no such impressions, by reason of their thinnesse, and continuall transparent brightnesse which hath no bounds. There is no figure

but must bee receiued in a body that is limited by some meanes whatsoeuer. Those things which are made in the Heauens, last and continue: but contrariwise the Parelies vanish soone. Neither are they in the very ayre, which is transparent and not limitted, yet they seeme to be in the ayre, the which is the receptacle of exhalations and clouds: so as the Pareleis are fashioned in the clouds. Besides the cloud where they are made, must be some-what thick, equall and moist, to make a body, wherein the forme of the Sunne or Moone must be grauen, and of a meane thicknesse, for if it did abound, it could not receiue this impression. It must also be vnited like vnto a Looking-glasse, else there can be no representation. And moyst, that the brightnesse and resemblance may pierce into it, to make a reflexion. Such Images cannot bee receiued but in transparent bodies.
            Moreouer, this clowd must bee opposite to the Sunne, to receiue and represent the whole face of it, the which should appeare but by halues, if it were on the one side, or not at all, if the Sunne should shine directly aboue the clowd. The reflexion also of the beames is necessary: for if they did pierce through the clowde, there would no Image appeare. The ayre must also bee calme and without agitation. For if the windes did blowe, the clowde would bee shaken, and so nothing disposed to receiue any such impression. As you cannot see your face in the waues of a floud, but easily in a cleere and calme Water, the which is limitted in a Basin or other vessell. If the Sunne shines in such sort, as there is any reflection of the beams you shall see the resemblance of the Sunne in this water,

euen as in a Looking-glasse. The like is seene in a cloud compounded of water, as hath beene sayd naturally, these like or seeming Moones, are signes of Raine: for that they are not conge

               led but in cloudes that are of a reasonable thicknesse. Such clouds are matter for raine. Supernaturally, they are forerunners of the iudgments of GOD, punishing the World with Plague, Warre and Famine: As we haue seene in our Times.
            
            In the same yeare 1527. There was a great noise heard in the ayre, as of Armed men, that gaue Battaile. Soone after the Sunne shining in a cleare skie, it was sodainely enuironed with a great cloudie Circle. In the yeare 1528. about mid-May ouer the towne of Zurich, there were 4. seeming-Moones seene, enuironed with 2. whole Circles, and the Sunne compassed in with fower small Circles. The same yeare the Towne of Vtrecht, being straightly beseeged, and in the ende taken by the Bourg
                     •…
                  ignons, there appeared in the ayre a fore-telling of their misery, wherewith the Inhabitants were wonderfully amazed, which was a great S. Andrewes Crosse of a pale colour, and hideous to behold.
            The ninth of Ianuary 1529. about ten of the clocke at night, there was seene in Germanie an opening of the Heauen, described by IOVIANVS PONTANVS in his Meteors. Two yeares after ouer Lisbone in Portugall, were seene fiery and bloudy apparitions in the Heauens, and soone after there fell many droppes of bloud out off the Clouds vpon the Earth. The eleuenth of Aprill 1542. about seuen of the clocke in the morning, there were seene three Sunnes distinctly shining at Venice, with two rain-bowes opposite to the Sunne. The first did not continuel ong. The second being lesse, remained vntill

nine of the clocke▪ the one was very round like vnto a Crowne; the true Sunne was in the midst, and the two seeming at the ends: the other Raine-bowe aboue this Crowne was very large, the two endes beeing equally distant from the Earth. Those seeming were so resplendent, as Mans eye could not endure to looke on them, no more then of the brightnesse of the true Sunne, but that of the left hand towards the South, did shine more then the other looking towards the North, the which continued longer, and was more resplendent in the declyning. They were of a reddish colour, extending their beames verye farre in the Ayre, euen vnto the Earth. About the ende of the same month of Aprill in the same yeare, there was seene in Suisserland a great white circle shining like cristall. In many Prouinces of Europe there were Dragons seene flying in the Ayre in great troupes, sometimes to the number of foure hundred, hauing all royall Crownes vpon their heads: and their heads were like vnto those of Swine, especially the groine. Those of Munster in West phalia, did see in the day time, the skie being cleare and bright, an armed Knight running in the ayre.
            The great commander of Malta, caused to be published in the yeare 1532. Throughout al Europe a strange apparition which happened in Assiria that yeare, which was this. About the seuenth of March a Woman named RACHIENNE was brought in bed of a goodly Sonne, which had the Eyes sparkling, and the Teeth shining. At the same instant that he was borne, Heauen and Earth were strangely moued, the Sunne did shine as bright at midnight as at noone-daye, and in the day time it was so darke, as from morning vntill night they could

not see any thing in all that country. Then afterwards he shewed himselfe, but of an vnaccustomed forme, with diuers newe starres wandring vp and downe. Ouer the house where this infant was borne, besides other prodigies, fier fell from heauen, which slue some persones. After the eclipse of the Sunne there happened a horrible tempest in the Aire: then there fell pearles from heauen. The next day they might see a fiery dragon flie throughout all that Clymat. Moreouer there appeared a newe Moūtaine, higher then any other, the which did presētly diuide it selfe into two parts, and in the midest of them appeared a colomne or piller, where there was a certaine writing in Greeke, shewing that the end of the world approched, then was there a voice herd in the aire, exhorting, euery one to prepare himselfe. The Child hauing liued two moneths, began to speake like one of yeares, &amp; by diuers delusions, growes into such credit, as hee was adored &amp; worshiped as a GOD, discouering it selfe to be an euill spirit, the which had a great force of error in al those Countries. Neere vnto Iuban a Towne of Lusatia, was seene in calme &amp; cleere skie, the day after Whitsō
               day, in the yeare 1535. about two of the clocke in the afternoone troupes of armed mē, aduācing frō the North, to the part opposite, &amp; there were cries heard in the aier, like to men that were in battaile. Ouer the towne of Vanaire in Saxony, were seene three Cheurons of fire in the aire. And the day before the taking of Munster, there appeered ouer the towne in a cleere skie, a Crosse &amp; a naked sword. About the end of Iuly the same yeare, in the Confins of Zurich in Suisserland, there fell a furious and neuer herd of torment in the aire, being all on fier, with most horrible thunders. There fell out of the aire great flames of fire the which did quite consume 5. houses nere

vnto Adelsinge. The same moneth as the Inhabitants of Smelwi

                were in the Church, at their mornings deuotiō, there sodenly appeered a wonderful light in the aire, then fell lightning which slue two men, &amp; with the force of his exhalation, ouerthrew thirty others to the ground, halfe dead: hauing burnt all their clothes: but their bodies were preserued, being more affrayed then hurt.
            The 7. of February 1536 about two of the clocke, after mid-night, there was seene in the Element, ouer one quarter of Spaine, two armed men, running one at an other with their swords drawne the one carried on his left arme a target, on the which was painted an Eagle, with this Motto about it Regnabo, that is to say I will raigne. The other had a great target with a starre &amp; a Cressant, and this inscriptiō 
               Regnaui. I haue raigned. He that Carried the Eagle ouerthrew the other. The like Combate was seene in Hongary 20. yeares after, the which we will note in order. In the yeare 1537. the first of February there was seene in Italy an Eagle flying in the aire, carrying in the right foote a bottle, &amp; in the left a serpent wrethed vp: being followed by an infinit number of others. At the same time also there was a Bourguignon crosse of diuers collours seene in the aire. 15. daies before there was seene in Franconia, betwixt Bamberg &amp; the forest of Turinge, a star of huge greatnesse, the which declyning by degrees, turned into a great white circle, out of the which soone after proceeded great gusts of winde &amp; flasshes of fire, which falling to the ground, did melt the heads of pikes and the bitts of horses, without hurting of man or house. In the yeare 1538. there were seene in the aire, ouer diuers parts of Germany, armed men fighting, and as it were killing one an other.
            Towardes the East there did shine a Starre of an

vnaccustomed bignesse, hauing beames as red as bloud, and neere vnto it a bloudie crosse and a flying Standard. Two yeares after was seene an other starre in the clouds, very bright, as at the breake of day, it appeared the 25. of December. The next day there came out of the Moone two twinckling Starres shyning very bright.
            There was seene in the yeare 1541. three Sunnes, cō
               passed in with a Rainbowe. The yeare following, there were seene in Saxony, Rodds and Torches of fire. In the yeare 1544. the 7. of April at eight of the clocke at night, the skie being very cleere, there were seene ouer a little Towne in Suissarland, called Wilen Turgau, in the face of the Moone, a white crosse shyning very bright, the foure ends whereof (especially the nethermost) did farre passe beyond the face of the moone. Two daies after there was seene ouer Golaries in Suissarland, an houre before Noone, the skie beeing very cleere, a great white circle shyning, wherof the Center from the right part vnto the left, was enuironed with a Rainbowe, as it doth vsually appeere. This circle turned at foure of the clocke right before the midest of the rondell of the Sunne. The 29. of March 1545. about eight of the clock in the morning, there fell about Cracouia a flash of lightning after a horrible thunder, so as al Poland was troubled thereat. Presently after there appeared three red crosses in the Element, betwixt the which there was a man armed at all parts, who with a burning sword did fight with an army, the which he defeated, and therevpon came a horrible draggō which swallowed vp this victorious man: presētly the heauens did open as they had beene all on fire, &amp; so continued for an houres space. Then there appeered three Rain-bowes in their accustomed collours, vpon the

highest of which there was the forme of an Angell, as they do represent them in the shape of a yong man, that hath wings at his shoulders, holding a Sunne in one of his hands and a Moone in the other. This second spectacle hauing continued halfe an houre in the viewe of all those that would behold it, certaine cloudes did rise which did couer these apparitions.
            In base Hongary, there was seene in the yeare 1546. for the space of a whole houre, the heauens open, from the which did fall great aboundance of fire, vpon this fier there appeered a blacke Oxe, the which seemed to pisse fire. Aboue Belgeen a Towne in Misnia, and the Country about was seene an other opening of Heauen, the which continued two houres in the night the 10. of February, and cast forth beames euen vnto the earth. At the same time were seene three burning Cheurons, and of diuers collours, flying in the Aire. In the yeare 1547. there was seene aboue Halberstad in Saxony, a blacke boule comming out of the midest of the Moone, and running violently towards the North. The 15. day of December the same yeare, the Mariners of Hambourg, did see in the element at mid-night, a burning globe and shyning as the Sunne, rowling towards the South, whose beames were so hot, as the passengers could not abide vpon the hatches, but were forced to hide themselues thinking the shippes would bee set on fier. They did also see in Suisserland, two armies in the Aire, fighting togither. And two ramping Lions fighting, whereof the one pulled of the others head with his teeth. Aboue them appeered a white Crosse stretched out in length, hauing the lower end fashioned like a whippe. The same yeare the twelfeth of Aprill and the two following, presently after

noone the Sunne was seene in his Spheare, like vnto a globe of fire, and at Noone-day the Starres appeered. Ten daies after, which was the 24. in Saxony, Turin, Suisserland, France and England, the Sunne appeared with a cloudie and bloudie Countenance, for the space of foure houres, to the great amazement of many. It continued in this sort some other daies following. The first daies of October following, about seauen of the clocke in the morning, there was seene in Saxony, the forme of a dead mans Beere, couered with a blacke cloth and a Crosse vpon it of a reddish collour, accompanied both before and behinde with many figures of men in mourning weeds, either of them carrying a Trumpet wherewith they began to sound so loude as the Inhabitants of the Country did easily vnderstand the noise. In the meane time there appeared a man all armed, and of a terrible aspect, who drawing out his sword cut off part of the cloath and then with his hands he tare in peeces the rest which done, both hee and all the rest vanished. In December the same yeare, about Rome there appeared in the aire, three daies togither, about three of clocke in the afternoone, a beesome as it were dipt in bloud, and a red Crosse, ouer the which did houer an Eagle. In the moneth of May precedent: about Saxony and the Marquisate of Brandebourg, were seene two Globes of fire, leaping about the Sunne, the greatest of them did so couer the Sunne, as at Noone-day, it seemed as it were rustie. They did also see the same yeare a furious Combate of two armies in the aire ouer the Towne of Quendelbourg.
            
            The yeare 1548. the 23. day of Iulie, the Moone being at the full, it appeared of the collour of bloud, oue

               Rosensel a Towne of the Duchie of Wirtemberg: and in this Moone was seene an arme of a blackish collour, with a hand stretched out: soone after the Moone hauing recouered her vsuall light, it was againe seene with three Cheurons or large barres of the same collour that the arme was, which did crosse it distinctly. These barres being vanished, there appeered a Bourguignon crosse, black, vnderneth the Moone, at the two sides there appeered two other smal rondells. The yeare following, which was 1549. in the morning, the Sunne being very bright, in the moneth of May, vpon a quarter of Germany, there was seene in the aire the figure of a man, attired like a Germaine Prince, aboue the which, there appeered on the other side a Lion and a Sheepe, which seemed to imbrace one an other willingly: before this Prince was a great garland of flowers, the which he would haue taken in his hand, but not being able, he tooke vp a sword, the which was vnder his feete from the beginning, wherewith he florished twise or thrise about his head, and then all vanished into the cloudes. In the yeare 1550. were seene in the night, ouer the Towne of Lipsick in Misnia three Globes of fire. And in August the same yeare, about Nuremberg, the skie being very cleere, the Sunne was seene of diuers collours, and ouer it a vessell, the which leaning on the one side, there came forth bloud, where-with the Sunne was made redde. On the other side there appeered an Eagle with his wings spred abroad of diuers collours, but without any feete. A little beneath the Sunne and the Eagle, was a Raine-bowe, and directly vnderneth it was a Man, holding a horse by the bridle with his left hand, and with his right

               The 19. of Iuly before, neere vnto Wittenberg in Saxony, there was seene in the element the forme of a goodly Hart and vnder it armies which did fight with great noise and feare-full cries. During this conflict there fell a shower of bloud vpon the Earth, the Sonne appeared verie hiddeous and as it were out of his course, diuided in two and in shewe approching neere the Earth. Some weekes before, there was seene almost in the same place, a bloudy sword in the Aire, and a peece of Ordinance, mounted vpon wheeles. The 24. of Iune betwixt sixe and nine in the morning, the time being very cleere, there was seene in the Element, a blacke Crosse with a Iauelin, hauing a fish-hooke at one of the ends, and at the other three small barres like vnto rests. Ouer Lisbone in Portugall, there appeered the 28. of Ianuary 1551. a great handfull of bloudie roddes, with fearefull fiers: it rayned bloud, and there followed Earth-quakes, so as two hundred houses were shaken and ouerthrowne, whereby aboue a thousand persons were slaine. The 21. day of March, about 7. of the clocke in the morning, there were seene at Magdebourg seauen Rain-bowes and three Sunnes; and at night three Moones, whereof that in the midest, which was the right, kept her ordinary collour, the other two were of the collour of bloud. These three Sunnes were also seene at Witenberg in Saxony, with ten or twelue Circles that did inuiron them, some round, others but halfe and very spatious, others lesse, and some very smal, almost all of the collour of the Rainbowe. The last daie of February, which was three weekes before, those of Antwerp in Brabant had also seene three Sunnes, inclosed in diuers Circles and Rainbowes.
            
               In the yeare 1552. the 19. of February, about three of the clock in the afternoone, those of Maclin in Brabant, did see the Sunne first of a blew coulour, then red, enuironed with a great circle and a Rain-bowe. About eleuen moneths after, the 23. of Ianuary 1553▪ about eight of the clock at night, there was seene at Basil, the Moone enuironed with a great &amp; cleere circle, of the coulour of the Rainbow, the which continued three whole houres. In Iune following, there were seene in the ayre, being cleere and bright, ouer the Towne of Cobourg, betwixt fiue and sixe at night, diuers sorts of men, then armies which gaue battaile, &amp; an Eagle houering with her wings abroad. In Iuly were seene two Serpents ioyned together one eating of an other, and betwixt them a fierie crosse. The same yeare the Citty of Magdebourg was straightly besieged, &amp; among other maruailes, the day after Easter the Sunne appeared very bright at the rising, and enuironed with a great circle as white as milke, the which were crost with foure Rain-bowes, the goodliest that euer was seene. Ten dayes before, betwixt seauen and eight of the clock in the morning, were seene ouer the same Towne, three Sunnes: the right had his ordinary brightnesse, the other two had a bloudy colour. Hauing continued almost the whole day, at night there appeared 3. Moones, whereat all the Inhabitants of the place were much amazed, they were of diuers colours: and after they had continued some houres, the two apparant Moones or Paralies, became red as bloud, then dispersing themselues into long streames, in the end they vanished: the right Moone which was in the middest, retained her accustomed brightnes. The same yere died Duke GEORGE Prince of Anhalt, an excellent Diuine. The day of his

death, there appeared in the night ouer the Towne of Wittenberg a blew Crosse. A few dayes before the battaile, giuen betwixt MAVRICE Duke of Saxonie, and ALBERT Marquis of Brandebourg, there appeared the image of a great man in a place of Saxonie: from the body of this man, which appeared naked, first there began bloud to fall from him, drop after drop: then they did see sparkes of fire come from him, and in the end he vanished by little and little. In Ianuary 1554. there appeared three Sunnes twise in Saxony. The 1. of February following, about Chalons in Champagne, was seene a great flame of fire, which went from the East to West, like to a burning Torche, bending as a Cressent, the fire did crack, and 
                  •…
               ast out sparkes of all sides, like vnto a barre of Yron comming out of the Furnaise, which the Smiths did worke with their Hammers. Some adde that this Torche appeared about the Moone, and shewed the point of a Lance at one end. The 19. of February. were seene at Nebre, two Crosses of a blew coulour. And the same day at Greisen in Turinge, they did see in the Sunne which shined brightly, a blew Crosse, so great as it couered all the face of the Sunne: on either side it had a great Cheuron of fire, with diuers Circles. The 9. day of Aprill, aboue Sultzfield, halfe a dayes iourney neere vnto Schuinfort, an Imperiall Towne, there appeared two Moones in the night. In Marche before, were seene Sunnes of diuers greatnesse, with some Circles in Bauaria and the Countrie about. First the 6. of Marche betwixt eyght and nine of the clock in the morning, were seene two Sunnes with a Rainebowe. The 23. of the same moneth, about an houre after-noone, those of Nuremberg did see as much: and

moreouer a Raine-bowe towards the West, and the Sunnes enuironed with white Circles, continued three houres together, with a long burning Cheuron. The eight day following, there were three Sunnes seene at Reinsbourg. Their beginning was about an houre after noone: betwixt two and three they did shine brightly, and ended at foure of the clocke. They did cast out beames of the one side like vnto a Commet: that in the middest towards the North, and the other two towards the East and West.
            In Marche the same yeare, were seene ouer diuers Townes in Germanie, betwixt foure and fiue of the clock at night, diuers Bourguignon Crosses, but most white, and in a manner touching one another. The 23. day of the same moneth, a little before Sunne sett, were seene two Parelies enuironed with the Sunne by a great Circle ouer the Village of Blech. Not farre from Noremberg the eleuenth of Iune, there appeared a Rodde of a bloudie colour through the Sunne, with Starres or Boules of Azure. Presently after there were seene two Squadrons of armed men, the which had blew Cornets, who for the space of two houres, incountred together furiously, to the great amazement of many which did see the beginning, the continuance and end of this apparition. The 13. of Iune, about fiue of the clocke in the after-noone, ouer the Towne of Iene, the Sunne was seene of a bloudie colour, to whom there approched presently from the South and West, great and many boules of fire, the which did darken the light of it. And then appeared two Cheurons of a very red colour, crossing through the Sunne. The 24. day of Iuly, about ten of the clock at night, there appeared in the

ayre, in that quarter of the Country which is called the high Palatinat of Rhine. Towards the forrest of Bohemia, two men armed with all peeces, the one being of a farre taller stature then the other, hauing on his brest a bright shining starre, and a flaming sword in his hand, as also the lesser had. They began a furious combate, bu
                  •…
               in in the end the lesser was beaten downe, and could not stirre: whervpon a chaire was brought vnto the Victor, in the which being set and remained some time, still menacing with his sword in his hand him that lay at his feete, as if he would strike him. In the end they both vanished away.
            The 5. of August following, at 9. of the clock at night, neere vnto Stolpen, in the South part of Heauen, there appeared troupes of warlike men, who with great cryes and noise of armes, charged one another furiously, when the first charge was ended, there came aboundance of fire out of the clouds, which hindred the sight of these troupes. This fire vanishing, they returned to the second charge: then the fire kindling againe, you would haue said it had beene a kind of retreat, to rally themselues againe together on either part: which ended, they returne againe to a third charge, the which being done, they all vanished. The same yere at Fribourg in Misnia, was seene in the open day, the representation of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, as many Painters are accustomed to represent him, sitting in a Rain-bow, the colours whereof were exceeding liuely. And about another towne called Zopodee, the Sun rising appeared as red as bloud, hauing about it a stately Pallace, the which was all on fire. On either side of the Sunne was seene a high columne, very artificiall fashioned and of the coulour that the Raine-bowe. It seemed that their foundations did touch the ground,

and were very large. The next day the Sunne did rise with a pale coulour, and this Pallace was aboue it shining very brightly. The columnes or pillers also appeared, but not so faire and long as the day before. The 10. of February 1555. there were three Sunnes seene at Vinaire in Saxonie. And the 13. of March, there appeared in the ayre about Turinge a fl

               ming sword. The eleuenth of Ianuary 1556. towards the Mountaines which compasse in the Citty of Ausbourg of the one side, the element did open, and seemed to riue, whereat all were wonderfully amazed: especially by reason of the pittifull accidents which followed▪ for the same day the messenger of Ausbourg slue a Captaine at the Citty gates with a Pistoll. The next day, the wife of one that made sword blades, thinking to get a great booty, slue a Marchant in her house: and presently after her seruant killed her selfe with a Knife. A day after, a Butcher was slaine in a quarrell: and two villages were quite burnt. The 15. day of the same moneth, the Keeper of S. Katherins forrest was found dead, being shotte through with an Harguebuse. The 17. a Gold-smiths man falling into dispaire, drowned himselfe. The night following many were wounded to the death in the streete. I had forgot to note, that the same eleuenth day of Ianuary, when the Heauens did open about Ausbourg, there happened such a change in the aire about Mickhuse in Bauicre, and so great a light appeared in the night, as it did obscure the light of Candles in their shops and houses, so as for three houres space, those which would worke, had no need of any other light then that of Heauen. Some moneths after, the Heauens began to open in another part of Swau
                  
                     •…
                  e, out of the which there proceeded such aboundance

of fire, as many were striken dombe with feare: there were some villages and small Townes burnt and quite ruined. They did also see in the ayre certaine resemblances of Camels▪ the which deuoured armed men.
            In diuers dayes and moneths of the same yeare 1556. were obserued other apparitions: as in February in the County of Bats, there were seene in the ayre armies of foote and horse, the which did incounter together furiously. In September, ouer a little Towne in the Marquisate of Branaebourg, called Custerin, about nine of the clocke at night, they did see infinite flames of fire comming out of the ayre, and in the middest two great burning Cheurons. In the ende there was a voice heard crying, Miserie, Miserie vnto the Church. Wee haue sayd before that in the yeare 1536. there had beene seene in the ayre in Spaine a Combate of two young men. VVLFGANG STRANCH of Nuremberg writes, that in the yeare 1556. ouer a Towne in Hungarie, the which he calles Babatcha, there was seene the 6. of October, a little before Sunne rising, the resemblance of two naked boyes fighting in the ayre, with Cymiters in their hands, and Targets vpon their armes. Hee which carryed a spred Eagle vpon his shield, did charge the other which carryed a Cressant so furiously, as it seemed the body being wounded in many places, did fall from the Heauen to the Earth.
            At the same time, and in the same place, was seene a Raine-bow with his accustomed colours, and at the end thereof two Sunnes. Not farre from Ausbourg, there was seene in the ayre a Combate betwixt a Beare and a Lion, in December the same yeare: And at Wittenberg in Saxony the 6. of the same moneth, three Sunnes,

and a crooked clowd, marked with blew and red, stretcht forth like vnto a bowe, the Sunne shewing pale and sad, betwixt the Paralies or seeming Sunnes: foure moneths before three Sunnes had beene seene betwixt Euschoin and Basill.
            
            Touching the significations of all these apparitions▪ I will not meddle with them. Since that yeare, many are obserued in diuerse climates of the world, especially in Europe, other wonders in the ayre, euen vnto this present age: whereof wee may make mention in other Bookes. At this time we doe onely represent that which CONRADVS LICOSTHENE: hath collected. IOB. FINCET. MARC FRYTSCH, and many others, in his great volume, De Prodigijs et Ostentis.
                As for Comets, showers of bloud, prodigious hayle, and other wonders of Heauen, we will speake of them in their proper places.
         
         
            Of some that haue lost all appetite of drinking and eating.
            
               WE haue seene in some diseases, the patients haue lost all appetite of eating and drinking, in such sort as they tooke in a manner no sustenance. Of this number was a Nunne in the couent of Saint Barbe at Delft, who being falne sick of the Iaundise, in the yeare 1562 continued in her bed six weekes together, without eating or drinking. All this time shee receiued no nourishment, but some Kernells of Lymons, the which she held in her mouth, and did some-times suck. The Father of this Couent led me thether, not to minister Phisicke

vnto her, but to see her as a miracle, by reason of her long abstinence: but the next day after I had visited her, she dyed: That which I will adde is more worthy of admiration. In the same Towne of Delft, being accompanied by a Surgian, I did visit a certaine sicke maide, of seauen &amp; twenty yeares old &amp; a halfe, it was in May 1556. after the age of sixteene yeares, she had neuer come out of her bed, hauing eaten euery day since that time but a little morcell of dried Cheese (as her keeper had protested) neither was it possible to make her swallow any liquor, and yet she pist sufficiently: she went not to the stoole but once in eight dayes. More-ouer she was borne blind, she fell to be full of the dropsie at the age of twenty yeares, but this water vanished away, and then shee had a sound in her belly like the noise of liue Frogges, in great abondance, accompanied with a strange rising and falling of her bellie, so as do I what I could, laying my hand vpon her belly, it was heaued vp. This motion did increase at the full Moone with great paines, as also at the flowing of the Sea: but at the wane of the Moone, and the ebbing of the Sea, shee found some ease. This motion continued with her seauen yeares: and euery tenth weeke shee had her Termes, as her keeper did confesse vnto me.
         
         
            Strange Appetites.
            
               THere is no man almost liuing, which knoweth not some particular Histories of the extraordinary appetites of certaine women with child, for the which the learned Phisitions giue a reason. We will report

some Examples, to incite the reader, entring into the cō
               sideration of them and others that he shall call to minde, to honor GOD in so many wonders, without naming in particular the diuers sorts of these Appetites, which are as variable as the countenances, &amp; conditions of women that be with child. I haue seene one who longing to bite a yong man by the nape of the necke, and for that she had forborne a little to satisfie her furious desire, she begā to feele gripings and exteame paine in her belly. She therfore like a desperate woman leapes vpon this yong man, gets hold of the nape of his necke, and bites him so sore, as he thought to haue died of it.

            My Mother bearing mee in her wombe: an Appetit tooke her to eate Creueses. She sent sodenly to seeke some, and being impatient to haue them washt and made cleane, she began to eate them rawe and aliue, vntil that she had satisfied her desire. 
                  Trincauelle. lib. 7. Chap. 5. 
               Of the meanes to cure diseases in mans body. A Woman of Nisues, beeing with Child, and seeing a young man, a Fuller of cloth bare legged, shee came so neere him, as with her teeth she laies hold of one of his Legges and carries away a peece of it. He was content shee should vse him twise in this sort, but seeking to returne the third time, hee refused her and went his way. This poore woman a while after was brought in bedde of three children whereof two were aliue and lusty, and the third dead. An other woman with Child longing for a Bakers shoulder, which carried her bread vnto the Ouen, she reiected all other meate and drempt onely of that. Her husband desiring to content her, wrought so with the Baker, as for a certaine some of money, he was

content his wife should tast of that shoulder shee had so much desired. Hee had endured her teeth twise but she had bitten him of sore, as he would not endure a third charge. The woman Longing still, sell in Labour of three Sonnes, two aliue and the third dead.
            In a village not farre from Andernac a Towne seated vpon the Rhine, belonging to the Bishop of Colleyn, a Country woman being with Child and distasted, did long to eate of her husbands flesh. Her desire was so furious, as she killed him, eate halfe his body, and pouldred vp the rest: soone after the rage of her appetite being gon, she confessed the fact willingly vnto her husbands friends, that sought for him. At Lymbourg in Silesia, the Towne where I was borne, a man coming out of a Bathe bare Legged, with his pantofles, hee was followed by a woman with Child, who desirous to tast of such meate, gets hold of one of his thighes and with her teeth pulled of a peece of his heele, the man crying out murther, yet would she not leaue her hold vntill she had done. I cannot passe ouer with silence what happened to a Noblemans Concubine, who diuers mornings did eate whole handfulls of fl

Beeing falne sicke through this disordred appetite, an olde woman brought me her water; hauing vnderstood that she was distasted, and being demanded of the olde woman what I thought of the Vrine, I answered her that the gentlewoman did winde more flaxe with her mouth then with her spindle. The olde woman thinking that the inspection of the Vrine made me to diuine this, gaue it out that I was an excellent diuiner, the which purchased mee such credit, as afterwards euery man regarded me with admiration.
            
               EVE SIBYLLE my wife, had a sister called GENEVIEFVE, sometimes married to PETER le FEVRE of Heidelberg, who being with Child in the yeare 1562. and very bigge, went to the Bouchery to buy some peece of flesh. Hauing attended long and not able to stay any longer, she snatcht vp a peece of flesh, intreating the Butcher to wey it. This rude vnciuill fellow pulls it out of her hand, weyes it, and giues it to an other woman that was by: where-with she was so mooned, as her nose began presently to bleed. The which she wiping aboue the vpper lip, the Child where-with she went, receiued such an impression, as after some weekes, her time being expired, she was deliuered of a Son, who had only the nether lip, and so liued thus deformed a whole yeare, &amp; then died of the plague, N. IAMES FVTER in his Obseruations of Physick.
                I haue knowne women with Child which haue deuoured quicke Eeles, not leauing any part. In Delft there was one which did eate a whole sheepes skin with the woole. An other in the Towne of Alcmar, did swallowe downe whole ladles full of Tarre, where with marriners vse to calke their ships▪ as if it had bin sauory pottage. Such furious longings do not only torment women with child, but euen men &amp; children. MARY daughter to PETER SASBOT, being with Child did eate great aboundance of chalke. We may produce diuers examples of women who during their being with Child, insteede of bread &amp; good meate, haue eate nothing but earth, ashes and coales of the harth, plaster pulled out of the walles, salt-peter in sellers, Snailes, Frogges, Peares, Apples, and Plummes not halfe ripe, and when their desire hath not beene fully satisfied, their Children haue suffred for it. And as for signes and markes, scarse shall you finde ten

among a hundred, that haue not some token of this violent passion of their Mothers.
            Some-times, if in these appetits in women with Child do not sodenly get what they long for, they feele of it long time after they are deliuered. In a village called Schuueden, in the Bishoprike of Fulde, there was a woman with Childe, who passing by the way met with a fisher-man, whom she intreated to sell her all the fish he had taken, but this rude fisher-man refused her, not caring for her earnest request. Being returned very sad to her house she began to weepe bitterly, for that shee had beene so frustrated of her desire. There-vpon shee fell sodenly to haue an extreame desire to drinke water: but the more she dronke, the more her desire encreased: so as in one day she did drinke aboue thirty pound waight of water, the which she voided presently by Vrine. She continued sixe monethes after her deliuery to drinke daylie, without interruption foureteene pounds of water: In the end she came to aske aduice of me, and to seeke some remedy for this passion, being accompanied by other women her kins-folkes and friends, who with othes did confirme this extraordynarie drinking to be true, and that during her lying in, she did drinke euery daie twenty pounds waight of water. The wife of FRANCISCO BARBARIN a magnifico of Venice, during the time of her being with Child, did eate at diuers times, about 20. pounds waight of Pepper and not miscarried. After her deliuery she had a menstruos fluxe the which was cholerike and thinne, the which caused an vlcer in the Matrix, whereof she died M. N. of Florence. Cha. 30. of the 4. treaty, sermon. 5. I haue seene a woman which hath continued with this extraordinary and disordred

appetite, a yeare after her deliuery, the which made her pale, flegmatike and very leane. Her Child, did not liue long. GESNER in the History of birds, speaking of the Pie.

In many Combats allowed in our time, especially in France, it hath often happened that the Challengers haue bin slaine vpon the place by the defendants. There is not any one but may remember diuers examples of this kinde: GOD doth Iudge and is to be feared.
            Not long since a French gentleman much giuen to quarrell presuming vpon the skill he had of his weapon, he caused a dagger to be made, and these words to bee grauen vpon it. I respect not any man. He did vsually carry this dagger, and playing one day, it fell out of the sheath and he vpon it, where-with he was so wounded in the thigh as hee had almost died. I knowe not whether this made him any wiser, but euery one may see that his poinard respected not him. Neither had he made any exception in the writing. At the least he should haue reserued his owne person, and caused to be grauen. I respect none, but my master. In the warres of our times, infinit number haue beene surprised and slaine by there

            Swallowers. Merueillous Histories of some that haue swallowed diuers strange things into the stomacke, and what hath ensued.
            
               I Haue seene a man who for a farthing, did swallowe peeces of glasse, nailes and such like things in great quantity, then presently pinching in his belly, hee did cast it vp all againe at his mouth. The same man at one time did eate foure score rawe Leekes. To such men the bellie is a sacke, and they bee of the nature of Diue-doppers. Wee haue a stranger at Ferrara, who did swollowe and disgest peeces of Leather, pot-shards and broken glasses, in such sort as euerie man called him the Ostrige, the which doth disgest iron, as we haue made proofe of one that was in Antwerp. I remember that in my youth I had seene a Germaine Captaine in the French Armie who did swallowe his wine without anie motion of the throate. We haue seene manie Commedieus and such like in our time, swallowe wine and meate, as if it were cast into a sacke. Others which did cast vp as speedely as out of a sacke whatsoeuer they had eaten, without any strayning. I haue knowne some men, that for a peece of money would swallowe many flint stones, and then voide them out with the

excrements. ABRAHAM Deporte Leon, in his Dialogues of gold.
               
            
            Some fewe yeares past a young begging boye, went vp and downe BASIL, getting something to liue by after a miserable manner: for two deniers hee would swallowe many stones and whole nuts, where-with he so filled his bellie, as touching it you might heare them rattle, as if they were in a sacke. Then casting them all vp at his mouth, and washing them, hee would swallowe them againe, or others, as it should please them that gaue him any Almes. After some monethes I found him at Fribourg, where he vsed the same trade. But I could not learne since what became of him. In our time a Spaniard did swallowe in a short space foure goodly great Pearles, with a Crosse of Gold, garnished with fiue pretious stones, and the string whereat they did hang; all which did belong to a Curtisane of Venie

A certaine man (the reason thereof is vnknowne) hauing swallowed a stick of the length and bignesse of ones middle finger, he kept it in his body for the space of a yeare, in the end being in a certaine place among many others, he was troubled with a violent Collicke, the which forced him to returne vnto his house, where he voyded this sticke by the siege. There was at Zurich a Preacher well knowne, who hauing one day voluntarily swallowed a quicke Eele, voyded it whole and aliue by the siege.

swallowed a great Herring whole. And in the Towne of Alcmar in Holland, an other at one draft, did swallow three Dollers of Siluer, in a Potte of Beere, and three dayes after voided them by the seege. The same PETER FOREST in the aboue named Booke and Chapter.
            
         
         
            The following Histories report the dangers many haue beene in, that vnwittingly or otherwise, haue swallowed things that haue stuck in the throate, or els where by the which there haue followed diuers troublesome and pittifull accidents.
            
               A Country-woman in Holland, of the age of fifty yeares and more, feeding one day with a good stomack: she put into her mouth a great peece of flesh, dryed and hardened in the smoake, and hauing swallowed it without chawing, it stuck in her throate, and there continued three dayes without any helpe. She could receiue no nourishment whatsoeuer, the passage for meate and drinke being quite stopt. In the end calling me, I found that the morcell was gone farre, applying diuers remedies, but shee expected nothing but death. At the end of the fourth day, as she was sipping of Whey, this morcell fell violently into the stomacke, by meanes whereof shee recouered her health. A Mans Daughter of Delft, being three and twenty yeares old, hauing eaten a Cowes tripe greedily, being hard and gluie, some morcels stopt her throate, so as for three dayes space shee could not possibly swallow any thing. I caused a strong suppositarie to bee giuen her, and after that I had caused her

necke to bee anointed with Oyle of Lillies, and sweete Almonds, and then bound it about with a Cataplasme fitte for the griefe, when as all that were about her attended nothing but death, she was cured. An other maide eight and twentie yeares old, hauing in September in the yeare 1582. swallowed a peece of flesh that was hard and sinewie, was in the like danger for the space of 24▪ houres, and in the end eased, the peece falling into her stomack.
            A certaine man hauing eaten a Peach, would also swallow the stone, the which stuck in his throate, where hauing stayed a little, the party drunke a great draft, which thrust it into the stomacke, and passing from thence into the guttes, it stayed at the great gutte neere the fundement, so as for three dayes together hee could not goe to the stoole, in the end it past forth with the excrements with such a noyse, as if a Pistoll had beene discharged. But after that time he was alwayes tormented with the Emeroydes, by reason of the excoriation of that part, caused by the roughnesse of the stone. A young maide hauing eaten much of a sheepes lights, and finding her stomack charged, had a desire to cast, but the morcell stayed in the vpper part of her throate, so as they were forced to vse Yrons to get this morcell which was swolne, and had stopt the passage, of the which shee had like to haue dyed.

            A yong boy of eight yeares of age, hauing swallowed one of his fathers Counters, which hee vsed to cast his accoumpt withall, felt nothing for the present of this excesse: onely hee began by little and little to loose his flesh and to growe thinne. After a yeare, he voided this Counter with the excrements, but so consumed by the naturall heate, as euery man did wonder at it: Aneat. Port. cent. 2: cur. 69.
            An honest mother of a familie at Dusseldrop, being about to dresse a young child in March 1564. hauing two pinnes, the one great, the other lesser in her mouth, it chanced that her child was in danger to fall into the fire. This feare made the mother forget her pinnes, the which shee did swallow vpon this apprehension, hauing no other care but to saue her little one. The pinnes remained some houres in her throate with great paine. Being called to succour her, I commanded they should forbeare to giue her any meate or drinke, before I had tryed with an engin to draw out the pinnes. Being returned, I vnderstood they had made her drinke some broth, which did force the pins downeward a little aboue the orifice of the stomack: this caused a new pricking paine: to remedy it, I caused her to drinke a great draft of Beere with Butter, and some big peeces of Rie bread mingled with it, hoping that the waight of the bread with the drinke would driue downe the pins into the stomacke, seeing it was not possible to get them out aboue. The which tooke effect some few houres after▪ the next day I made her to bee fed with good brothes, and Buttered Beere, then to rest on her right side, without any waight,

vpon her belly, hauing Cushions vnder her armes, and vnder her thighes, to giue more scope, for the pinnes to descend into the guttes. After noone they tooke her vp, but I did forbid them that they should not shake her in turning her from one side to the other, but without bending her forward or backward, she should walke vp and downe easily, that the pinnes might passe into the guttes: the which they did, and then she voided them, the greatest was some-what bowed. Shee was exceeding sicke vpon this accident, but soone after shee was cured: A Venetian maide lying with a Needle in her mouth, that was foure fingers long, fell a sleepe, and swallowed it: at the end of ten moneths, hauing beene grieuously tormented, she voided it in her Vrine, but in a meruailous forme, for a stone of the bignesse of a Hens Egge, was growne about this needle Alex.

            BERNARD de NOIRS, a Mantuan Gentleman, of the age of three score and seuen yeares, a spare man, but lustie, hauing in his mouth a peece of flesh that was full of sinewes, the which he had not chewed well, he swallowed it. This morcell sticking to the orifice of the throate, did so stop the passage, as it was not possible for him to swallow any thing, no not cleere water. Hee could scarce breath, the slimie flesh did stick so fast, as the Surgions could not possibly drawe it vp, nor thrust it downe. After seuen dayes, being rotten and dissolued, it fell into the stomack: so as the patient was freed from suffocation. But for all this hee escaped not; for his throate being inflamed with paine, and the application of yrons, besides his weakenesse growing through the want of nourishment by the space of seauen dayes, had subdued all the forces and faculties of his life, so as the foureteenth day he dyed.

            A Barber being to Tent a woman in the bottome of her mouth, hee vnaduisedly let it slippe, so as it went by her throate into her stomacke, which caused such an indisposition in the poore woman, as being wasted and

dryed vp, after shee had languished many yeares, shee dyed. I remember that a young man of Harlem, who had swallowed Guernettes aliue (they be little Fishes of the Sea, which some call Squilles, or Primotheres) hee felt so great paine in his stomack, as in the end he dyed of a consumption. An other hauing swallowed three Gogions aliue, was choaked with the third, and dyed. A certaine woman hauing vnaduisedly swallowed a needle, could not be cured, but in despight of all remedics, hauing languished sometime, in the end shee dyed, all wasted and consumed. CHARLES SODERIN was some-times troubled with an ague, without any apparent cause, whereof in the end he dyed, being 35. yeares old.

               ROBERT of Saint Seuerin a very valiant Captaine in his time, making a voyage into Syria, and going towards Mont Sina, (to accomplish a certaine vowe made by him, according to the deuotion of those times) hauing descouered certaine troupes of horse, which came towards him, he demanded of them which did conduct him from the Sultā, what people they were. Whē they had answered him trembling, that they were Arrabians, the most dāgerous theeues in the world, with

out any shewe of amazement, but incorraging his companie hee said vnto them, that they must vnlade their carriages, to the ende that those which came might finde dinner readie as soone as they were arriued, whereof they had great neede, considering that they had beene much tormented with heat and dust. And whilest his people did what he had commanded, he went to meete them, and saluted them after a gratious manner, (being by nature a goodly personage, both for his stature and countenance) making much of them and seeming to haue no distrust of them, but with a smiling countenance he tould them by his truch-man, that they were wel-come. Which words beeing pleasing to these Arrahian theeues: they did willingly accept the offer which he made them, so as they dined cheerefully with him: and after they had receiued some small presents, they went their way, hauing forgotten all their barbarous crueltie, and giuing him many thankes for his good cheere. In this report wee see of the one part an act of great Iudgement, hee falling sodenly and vnawares into the hands of men without mercie: and on the other side an act of great humanity of men which seemed to haue nothing humaine but the face, and in crueltie receyuing the nature of Lions, Tigers and other sauage Beastes.

Moreouer hauing regard vnto the great quantity of bloud which hee had lost by his wounde (the bloud being the Treasure of nature, the preseruer of naturall heate and of the vitall spirits) and other accidents: I did conclude that hee was but a dead

            Being at Thurin, in seruice with the deceased Lord of Montiean, I was called to dresse a souldier called L'EVESQVE, borne at Paris, who being then vnder the command of Captaine Renouart, had three great wounds giuen him with a sword, whereof the one was on his right side vnder his pappe, running into the emptinesse of his brest, from whence there had falne great aboundance of bloud vpon the Mydriffe, which stopt his respiration, neither could he speake but with great difficultie, hauing a very violent feauer, and with a cough he cast bloud at the mouth, saying, that he felt an extreame paine on that side that was hurt. The Surgion who had drest him first, stitcht vp his wound in such sort, as nothing could come forth, the next day I was called to visit the patient, where being come, seeing the Accidents, and death approching. I was of opinion to vnsowe the wound in the Orifice, whereof I found congealed bloud, so as I caused the patient to be lift vp often by the legs, his head downward, leauing a part of his body vpon the bed, leaning with one hand vpon a stoole that was lower then the bed. Being planted thus, I caused him to shutt his mouth and his nose, that his lights might swell, and the Mydriffe rise, and the muscles betwixt the ribbes, &amp; of the vpper part of the belly together, should retyre themselues, that the bloud fallen into the stomack, might be cast out by the wound: and the better to effect it, I thrust my finger deepe into the wound, to dissolue this congeled bloud, so as there came forth nere seauen or

eight ounces, alreadie stinking and corrupted. Then I caused him to be set in his bed, making iniections into the wounde, with barley water, in the which I had caused Melrosarum &amp; sugarcandie to be boyled, then I caused him to be turned from one side vnto an other, and againe I made him to be lifted vp by the Legs as before. Then they might see come forth with the said Iniection little gobbets of bloud. This done the accidents decreased, and by little &amp; little did cease. The next day I made him, an other Iniection, to the which I added Centory, worme-wood and Aloes, to clense it the better, but the patient hauing tould mee soone after, that hee felt a great bitternes in his mouth &amp; had desire to cast, I found that these bitter Iniections profiting one way, did hurt an other, so as I did not continue them, but intreating the wound more mildly, the patient was cured beyond my hope.

a dagger vnder the left pappe, the which meeting with a rib past no farther: hee had an other shot with a pistoll almost in the same place running betwixt the skinne and the ribbes, &amp; comming forth behind, and a great wound with a sword aboue the eye, and an other vpon the head.
            Being thus wounded and left as it were for dead, these murtherers hauing taken away his purse and three gold rings, hauing cōtinued about two houres vpō the place, in the end he did rise: and as he labored to creepe he espied a soldiar cōming towards him with a naked sword, of whom hauing demanded helpe in GODS name, it mooued the soldiar to do him no harme, but seeing him in this estate, hee fled as if an enemy had beene behinde him. Herevpon, creeping forward a little, as well as hee could, hee meetes with a young Sonne of his owne beeing but eight yeares old, who flying also had strayed in the fields, who supporting him of the one side as well as hee could, hee conducted him vnto a village, where all the releefe that hee could get was that they did not make an ende to kill him, although that hee were in this pittifull Estate, and that this poore Infant with teares and lamentations, did offer them his clothes, and would haue stript himselfe before them, to the end they should succor his poore Father, Passing on farther, sometimes standing, sometimes lying downe, GOD presented vnto him an other of his Sonnes, about ten yeares olde, and beeing supported by him on the other side, GOD gaue him strength ynough to come vnto an other village, where with some difficulty he recouered two eggs with some hurds, the which were applyed to his greatest wounds: then giuing him a little wine, and setting him (as well as they could) vpon a Mare, they conducted

               les that were giuen, that of Saint Gilles in Prouence is noted beeing the 27. of September 1562. In the which certaine Spanish Captaines with their companies, who striuing to make it good vpon the dis-route, got nothing but blowes, and were in a manner all cut in peeces and slaine vpon the place. Those which suruiued laie still and did counterfet themselues dead. Of this number there were two Captaines, the one called ALPHONSO, the other MANRIC, both were Castillians. ALPHONSO had seauen wounds with a Courtelas vpon the head, his caske hauing beene beaten of and hee ouerthrown: foure of them had entred into his head, the other three had but cut the flesh vnto the boane: on either arme hee had foure great cutts, two about one of his Elbowes and his wrist, besides hee had sixe thrustes in his thighes. Hee and MANRIC with 260. others that were wounded did saue themselues as they could and were carried to Arles a neere Towne, where they were drest. MANRIC, had manie wounds in the head, armes, brest, sides and face, contynuing two daies without speech or pulce. In flying hee had cast himselfe into the Riuer of Rohan, where hee had remayned in the Water vppe to the chyne, for the space of 4. houres, sometimes lifting vp his head, sometimes playing the Diue-dopper, vntill the night was

come, and the victors being retyred, he swamme ouer the riuer. Aboue a hundred others that were wonded did striue to passe the riuer, desyring rather to hazard themselues in that sort, then to fall into the hands of the French, who were iustly incensed against them. But many of them were drowned, their strength fayling them in the midest of the waues. Those which escaped halfe dead, died in a manner all in the Hospitall at Arles. The two aboue named Captaines, after they had endured newe deathes in the hands of Surgions and Physitions, were after some weekes set on foote againe, but well marked in diuers places to serue for a remembrance and an example to their Countrymen, who notwithstanding haue not well considered of it. MANRIC had receiued two thrusts with a Halbard betwixt the ribbes, but there came not much matter out of his wounds: but at the ende of three weekes hee voided aboundance of rotten filthe by his fondement, to the great amazement of the Physitions, for that from the brest vnto the gutts there is no common passage, for any corrupt matter that is in the sayd brest. In the same Battayle a foote-man had a shot with a Harguebuse, the which peerst the lest Temple, and came out on the other side a little vnder the right Temple, hauing shattered his head in two: yet he was miraculously cured. He had beene drest at Nismes, but finding himselfe not well cured, he came to mee, and I did succor him with my best skill. Yet he contynued blinde and deafe of this wounde. Neither the braine nor the filme of it had not beene toucht, but the boullet hauing broken the head had past close by it vnto the other side. Moreouer, by reason of the blowe and the contusion, some little bloud dispersing it selfe into the

sinnews of the sight and hearing, it caused an obstruction, whereof followed a blindnesse and deafnesse. An other borne at Marseilles, being Ancient to a company, had a Harquebuse shot in the brest, so as the Bullet came forth at his back, and yet he was cured.
            Another of Arles, had his head halfe cut off with a Courtelas, so as it had neede to be propt vp, the blowe being giuen betwixt the first and second Vertebre (a ioint in the body, where the ioynts so meete, that they may turne as in the hucle-bone) so deepe and so large, as they might lay their hand in it, yet hee was cured, and liued foure yeares after this wonderfull wound. Another called CLAVDE of Sauoy, hauing his head almost cleft in two with a Courtelas, he neuer had feuer nor any other accident (the which are vsuall in such like wounds) but the broken bones being taken out according vnto Arte, in two moneths he was cured. Two others, the one hauing his thigh all broken in peeces with a Faucon shott, (the bullet whereof was drawne out of it,) and the other wounded in the Ancle, after they had suffered much, were cured, without cutting of thigh or leg.

Booke of his Phisicall obseruations, sets downe these Histories at large, and the remedies that were applyed, and the meanes that were vsed to cure these hurt men, the which we describe not, it belonging to learned Phisitions and Surgions, who besides the medicaments, haue respect to many necessary circumstances, which are to be considered of in such accidents. In an incounter neere vnto Cisteron, a Gentleman called the Cadet of Monstier, was shot with a Harguebuse, betwixt the fift and sixt rib: the Bullet crost his brest, and came forth within two fingers of the back bone. There

were drawne forth with the Bullet; twelue ringles of a shirt of Mayle which this Gentleman did weare: manie others ringles of the same side, remained among the Muscles, betwixt the ribbes and the backe, and some others driuen into the body came forth with the corruption of the wound, whereof hee was cured within a yeare. But hee had a difficultie in breathing, the which continued the remainder of his dayes, by reason of this wound. A seruant belonging to the Seigneur of Meianes a Gentleman of Arles, being shot in the right arme, in the same incounter, betwixt the elbow and the shoulder, and ill handled by the Surgions that were in the Armie, he came to Arles, hauing his Arme putrified and stinking so strongly, as no man could endure him, it was all black, soft, and extreamly colde, the patient falling somtimes into a swound. The Surgions being assembled with me, wee resolued to cut off his Arme speedily, to saue the rest of the body. Hauing therefore with a Raisor cut his Arme aboue the dead flesh, they cut the bone in sunder with a Sawe, and stopt the Flux of bloud with Canters fitte for it: so as within one moneth the man was cured. VALLERIOLA in the same Obseruation. At the same incounter, a Prouencall Souldier was shott into the arme with a Musket, the which brake the bones and did so teare all the rest, as the Arme did not hold by the thicknesse of ones finger, from falling. All the Surgions were of opinion to cutt it off, except one called Maister DIDIER TESTE, a man very expert in his Arte, who in one moneth cured this Souldier, who had in a manner all the motions of this Arme thus tattered, whole and sound. An other Souldiar stroken with an Harguebuse shotte in the face, the Bullet entring at the

mouth, and comming forth at the left side, towards the left Temple, hauing broken the vpper Iawe-bone, yet he was well cured.
            A certaine Porter in the Towne of Arles, falling to be a Souldiar in an incounter, he receiued a thrust three fingers vnder the Nauell, on the left side, giuen with such force, as it pierced vnto the backe, betwixt the third and forth ribbe neere vnto the bone: yet hee was cured by the aboue named Surgion. Wee haue (saith VALLERIOLA) held these aboue-named cures worthy the report, that none should despaire of difficult things, nor be too confident of those which seeme light. For that sometimes wee see him dye, whome the Physitions assured to see soone recouered, and him to escape, of whome they had lost all hope. And that both Physitions (and all others that shall read these Accidents) may remember that wonders do fall out in such wounds and cures, as in other workes of Nature, to the praise of Almighty GOD.
            In the warre of Sauoy 1589. and following: a young Souldier had a Harguebuse shotte in the fore-head, and the Bullet remained in his head. Hee was had in cure by an expert Surgion, so as within few moneths hee returded againe to Armes. And in a certaine Scallado, being falne from a high wall into a ditch, hee did so bruze his head, as hee dyed. The Bullet which remained of the precedent wound, was found in the hinder part of his head, without hurting of any part about it. Memories of our time.
            
            An other in the same warre, hauing a Bullet passing betwixt the great gutte, the bladder, and the stones, was not hurt in any part of them, but after hee

had beene carefully drest and lookt vnto, hee was euer after well, and so continues at this daye. In the same Author.
            
            I haue drest many which haue beene thrust through the bodies with Rapiers, and shott through with Pistols, and haue beene cured. For example, I had the Clarke of the Kitchin to the Ambassador of Portugall in cure at Melun, who had beene thrust through the body, whereby the bowels were so hurt, as in dressing him there came out at his wound a great quantitie of filthy matter: and yet he was cured. I was an other time called by a Gentleman of Paris, whose name was GILES le MAISTRE, Seigneur of Belle Iambe, remaining in the streete of Saint Andrew des Ars, in the presence of Mounsier BOTAL, ordinary Phisition to the King and Queene, and RICHARD HVBERT his ordinary Surgion, and IAMES GVILLEMEAV the Kings sworne Surgion at Paris, men well practised in Surgery, who had bin thrust through the body with a Rapier, so as for many dayes he voided bloud by the mouth, and by the siege in great aboundance, which shewed that his bowels and inward parts were perished: yet in fifteene or twentie dayes hee was cured. Maister AMBROSE PARE, lib. 10. chap. 4.
            A Shoomaker of Auignon, hauing beene sore wounded in the night vpon the head with a sword, which had cutte him euen to the first Membrana or Filme, there followed many fearefull accidents, so as after his first dressing and letting bloud, hee fell into a sounding or swonding, and was seuen dayes without speaking, yet in the end hee was cured.

               ANTHONIE my fathers seruant, a Fleming by nation, being ouer-laden with Wine at Shrouetide, and being mounted vp into one of the highest chambers of the house, he leaned at a window that was open, when being opprest with the fume of Wine, his head carried away his body, so as hee fell vpon the stones in the streete, whereas his head was in a manner all beaten to peeces, and he held for dead: for he moued no member, had no feeling nor speech but like a stock: and as it were giuing vp the ghost, hee continued seuen dayes together in his bed in that estate: notwithstanding three of the Phisitians at that time in Montpellier, that is, GRIFON the elder, TRAMPLET and FAVCON, accompanied by PETER ALZINE, ANTONIE BARELIER, and NICHOLAS le BLOIS Surgions, did warrant his life with the helpe of GOD. True it is, that he continued almost blinde and quite deafe of this fall, all the rest of his life. The same in the 4. obseruation of the 6. Booke.
            
         
         
            Of Theeues and Murtherers.
            
               A Learned Diuine of our time, reports a Historie almost like to that of IBICVS, for he saith that a Germaine being in a voyage, fell into the hands of certaine theeues, who being ready to cutte his throate, the poore man discouering a a flight of Crowes, sayd. O Crowes, I call you to witnesses and reuengers of my death. Hee was presently murthered by these theeues: who three dayes after being drinking in an Inne, behold a flight of Crowes come and fall vpon the top of the house.

Then the theeues began to laugh, and to say one vnto another. Hoe, behold those which will bee reuenged for his death, whome wee dispatcht the other day. The seruant vnderstanding this speech, discouers it vnto his Maister, who makes report vnto the Magistrate, and hee apprehends the theeues, vpon their varications and diuerse answers, hee doth so presse them, as they confesse the trueth, for the which they were executed. In the collection of Memorable speeches made by this Diuine.
            
            CONRAD de la ROSE, Secretarie to MAXIMILIAN, the first Emperour of that name, a valiant and wise Gentleman, hauing crost through a long Forrest, and forced by reason of the approching night to lodge as hee could, hee entred into an Inne, where as the hoste was a Theefe. Being in his Chamber, and reasonably well entertained, hee perceiued the seruant to weepe, and did secretly vnderstand from her, in what danger hee was. She told him among other things that the Hoasts custome was to ring a little Bell, at which sound many theeues entred into the lodging, and presentlie one among them entred into the Chamber, whereas the passengers were lodged, who making a shew to snuffe the Candle, should put it out: then the theeues entred, and falling vpon the passengers, slew them. CONRAD bethinking himselfe, caused a Lanthorne to bee brought him by the seruant, and a Candle light in it, the which he hid vnder a bench, held his wepons ready and attended his enemies. He was scarse set at the Table, but a peasant enters, who counterfetting the varlet, puts out the Candle. But CONRAD causing the Lantherne with the light to bee presently drawne

forth, and hauing his armes and his seruants ready, hee valiantly resists these theeues, slue some, put the rest to flight, layes hold vpon his Host, and deliuers him vnto the Magistrate, who caused him to bee executed. The same Author. Some yeares past, I did see broken vpon the wheele by the iudgement and sentence of the Bayliffe of Morges (vnder the gouernment of the Seigneurie of Berne) a young man, about the age of twenty yeares, who counterfetting himselfe dumbe, and asking almes of passengers, vnder colour of passing on his way with a little Bell in his hand, which was as a watch-word to his companions (the number of the stroakes making them to discerne the number of the persons and their qualities) was found to haue beene at two and twenty murthers, and with his owne hand, had cut many mens throates. He dyed miserably, roaring like a Bull when they brake his bones. The Emperout CHARLES the fift beeing in Germanie, whereas affayres of warre kept him, hee was constrained to send one of the cheefe of his Court into Spaine, to haue a care of affaires and difficulties that should arise. This Viceroy, a young Prince, much giuen to hunting, was one day in the kingdome of Granado, and being in pursute of a wilde Beast, hee strayed so farre from his people, as following his game through a great wood without respect of time or waye, hee found himselfe in a desolate place and be-nighted. By meanes whereof hee began to looke all about him, to see if hee could discouer some house or other place where hee might shrowde himselfe. Therevpon he sees a little Cottage, and riding thether, hee intreates the Peasant that dwelt there, to lodge him that night. The which the peasant

granted, and receiued him into his Cottage, where at that time there were sixe personnes, that is, the Peasant, his Wife, his Sunne of twenty yeares of age, his Daughter in Lawe, newely married, a seruant which kept his Cattell, a rough fellowe and of an ill aspect, and then a little Daughter. The Prince beeing lighted from his horse recommends him vnto this vallet, and then he enters into the Peasants house and drawes neere the fire, whilest they make ready supper, not dreaming of any harme. These people not knowing the Prince, nor he discouering himselfe to any; they seeing him so richly appareled, and of a goodly presence they held him to bee some great rich-man, and thinking it not fit to let go so fat a preye, they beganne to deuise some meanes to kill him, and to get his spoyles. After supper they prepare him a bedde in a certaine Chamber, which had but a weake doore, easie to force. In going vp and downe, the Daughter in Lawe newly married (who had an Inckling of this cruell plot) taking pittie of this young Prince, whome shee did see of so goodly a stature, and of an honourable port and carriage, called him aside: hauing drawne him a part and intreated him to keepe secret what shee should tell him, shee discouers the enterprise breefely vnto him, whilest the Father, Sonne and vallet were complotting againe a newe in the stable. The Prince mooued at this report, and inclyning to beleeue some thing was readie to discouer what hee was. But doubting presently that it would but hazard his life, in committing it to the fayth of such barbarous people, which did so wickedly violate all the rights of humanitie and hospitality, to conspire against any man, whome they did see in so braue equipage, well mounted,

and courteously receiued by them: hee chose rather (vnder GOD) to trust vnto his owne valour, then vnto the worde of men that had no faith, and whose hearts were couered with dissimulation and bloud. Hee suffers himselfe then to bee conducted by the Peasant into this little chamber, and hauing shut the doore vnto him hee drewe a great heauy Chestvnto it, to serue as a Barricadoe, and then hee held his rapier ready, and by him was a long pistoll bended and primde, watching and attending what would become of the report of the Daughter in Lawe: Presently the Peasant (who thought he had beene a sleepe by reason of his trauell of hunting) came softly to the doore, thinking to enter it without any difficultie. But being frustrate of his expectation, he beganne to intreate his guest to open him the doore, for that he would take a couering for a bed out of the Cofer, of the which hee had great neede. The Prince (who slept not) answered. Retyre importunate man, I am nowe at rest, and will not open the dore at this time. Then the Peasant beganne to exclaime, crie out and say, that hee was vndone and that there was one would braue him in his owne house wherevpon hee falls to his armes, and threatens to breake all, yea to kill him that was in that little chamber if he did not presently open, and yeeld vnto his mercy. The Peasant &amp; his man cōming to breake downe the doore, the Sonne sought to enter the Chamber by a windowe, and all togither made a marueilous attempt. The Prince seeing himself reduced to extremity, dischargeth his pistoll at the doore, peerceth it easily, and kills the Peasant, then drawing backe the Chest, hee issues forth with his rapier in hand, dispatcheth the Sonne, and runnes after the seruant, who saues himselfe by

flight. But all was not yet done, for the cryes of the hostesse, and the extraordynarie noyse that shee made, did awake the other neighbour shepards, who came running with their Armes, enuironed the house, and cried out murther. The Prince standing vpon his gard, had patience vntill it was day, and seeing this troupe of mutiners to encrease, he beganne to let them as then vnderstand what hee was, threatning to cause them all to bee hanged, if they did refuse to assist him and to conduct him. If they would not beleeue him, they should fetch the Magistrate of the next place: and if they did not accept of that condition, their ruine and confusion was at hand. Being mooued with the speech and presence of a personage so farre different from their condition, they beganne to growe some-what milde: yet in such sort as they lay hold of him, binde him, and are leading him to the Gouernor of a Towne, which was some leagues frō rhence. The Princes gardes arryuing in the meane time, seeing him in this equipage were readie to cut all this troupe of Peasants in peeces: but the Prince did expresly forbid them. All the former being discouered and examined, the Peasants confederates were punished according to their merits, the seruant was broken vpon the wheele, the theeues house burnt, and the Daughter in Lawe was richely recompenced for her faith-full aduertisement.
            An Italian called FRANCISQVINO, hauing cōtinued some-time at Bolonia the fatte, one of the best Gentlemens houses of the Cittie, and had beene held for some honest gentleman, and of a good house, considering his stately carriage▪ In the end hee was discouered to leade this life which followeth, vnder collour of keeping the

ordynarie house for play at dice and cardes, and seeming also to bee verie desirous to haue still newe Companie, and to shewe him selfe stately, hee made himselfe to bee visited by them that were newely arriued in the Cittie. And as soone as they were entred, after that hee had performed the vsuall complements of the place, hee would set him downe to plaie with them, commanding in the meane time that they should make readie dinner, supper or a banket, according to the hower of the daie. But in steede of preparing it. FRANCISQVINO had a theefe or murtherer, who stood hidden behinde and prepared to beate him downe that drempt not of it, when as FRANCISQVINO should giue him a signe. Hee continued this traine so long, as they say when they were taken and had confessed all, there were found in Priuies foureteene or fifteene bodies of such as had bin thus slaine, by FRANCISQVINO and his murtherer. In the end this was their punishment. After they had beene pincht with hot burning pincers, their brests were opened, and their hearts sodenly pulled out, the which were shewed vnto them. Conformitie of ancient merueills with Moderne. lib. 1. An other theefe in our time called VILLEVINEVF, of the Coūty of Tonerre, had with him a seruant which serued him for a murtherer &amp; a Laquay. Al three were taken in the end and punished at Paris, the Laquay was whipt, the murtherer burnt aliue and the maister broken vpon the wheele. In the same booke. A certaine Hermit lyuing in a mountaine of Suisserland, where for certaine yeares he had liued austerly, and with reputation of holinesse among them of the Countrie came one day to Lucerne, and lodged with a certaine widow, whom he approched nere vnto, either to depriue

her of her honour, or to take her purse: shee crying out, a seruant of hers came, whom the Hermit slue presently with a Dagger. The widow running speedily out of the house, cryed out for helpe. A countryman comes in to succour her, and is slaine as her seruant was: then a Bourges of the Towne, and after him his seruant. Some others running thether, (but better aduised by the example of the former,) surprised this theefe, who falling to the ground, spake no other words, but Ictz hav ichs offder teaschen▪
                that is to say: Now I haue past the game.
            A Weauer borne at Basil, giuen to ryot and gourmandise, and not able by reason of his small meanes to continue this wicked course of life, hee practised a notable villanie. Remaining in the territories of Soleure, he resolued to go visit a Kinsman of his at Basil, called ANDREW AGER a Binder of bookes, a very honestman, who had beene Tutor, and as it were a Father to this lewd young man called PAVL, who determined to kill his Kinsman and Tutor, and to spoile his house. The 15. of Februarie 1563. he came early in the morning and knockt at his Kinsmans doore: the maide (who knew him well, and suspected no harme) opened him the doore. Hee enters into ANDREVVS Chamber, who was yet in bed, being an aged and a sickly man. After the manner of the country, ANDREVV asked him courteously the cause of his voyage, and how his wife and children did. For answer, this Theefe takes vp a Binders Hammer, and kils the good old man. The seruant which had opened the doore, being an honest young maide, called SARA FALCKISE, allyed to ANDREVV, and which gouerned his house, who the day before had beene promised in

Carriage, and made sure to IOHN HOSPINIAN, a professor in Philosophie at Basill. Shee running vp at the noyse, was beaten downe by the theefe with the same hammers, and then he cut her throate with a knife which booke-binders doe commonly vse. Then he opens the Chests, &amp; findes some goblets of siluer, with little coine the which he carries away. To hide this horrible fact, he setts fier of the Stoue, hoping that the house being fired, both these bodies should be consumed to ashes. But the fier beeing soone quenched by the neighbors, they found these two bodies thus miserably murthered. This wicked wretch was so tormented with the reuenging furies, and prickt with remorse of Conscience, as hee could not flie away that day, but was taken in a village nere vnto Basil, and brought backe vnto the Cittie, where by reason of his theft, murther and burning the house, hee was executed aliue by three punishments, by the wheele, the gibet, and by fire, the last day of the same moneth. THOMAS RODOLPHE of Schafouse, one of those who vnder the name of students giue themselues more liberty then they ought, hauing descouered that IOHN SCHVANFELDER and his Wife, (in whose house hee had formerly frequented) were gone to Francfort, he went presently to Sprendeling a nere village, whereas the aboue named remayned, and giues them to vnderstand that they were returning and neere at hand, with good companie with them, and that hee was come before to make readie dinner. He therefore sent the seruant to fetch some fish▪ and then hee beganne to intreate the Daughter of the house called AMELIE, to drawe him some wine. Shee saying that they must stay for her Fathers comming hee growes into choller, and demands a knife to pill an aple,

with this knife he kills a yong Child of foure yeares old, grand-chid to IOHN SCHVANFELDER, and then AMELY, who would haue defended her Nephew. Hee then flies away, and the Peasants runne after him, ouertake him, &amp; bring him to the Castell of Ofenbach, where hee confesseth the fact. But one night following, by an extraordinary meanes, he vnchaines himselfe, getts out of a Dongeon, and enters cunningly into the Earles Chamber, beeing then absent: there he remaines hidden two daies, pickes a Cofer, and takes out a bag with fiue hundred florins of the Rhine, and castes it vpon the banke of the Riuer of Min, which runnes along that Castell, then hee slides downe by a windowe that was grated, with the helpe of the roape of a boate which hee found tied there: and so flies to Francfort, where being descouered by the Countrymen vnto the Magistrate, the two and twenty of February 1570. hee was pincht and broken vpon the wheele.
            Not long since there were two English men lodged together, nere to Saint Marceaux gate at Paris: whereof the one had good stoore of Crownes and a great Chaine of gold, with some other rich Iewells which hee commonly carried about him. His Companion intending to bee Master of these Iewells, drewe him out to walke towards Bois de Vincennes, and beeing in the vygnes, hee fell vpon him, and cut the wind-pipe &amp; the mouth of the stomack giuing him cer
                  •…
               aine stabbes with his dagger, and thinking that hee had slaine him, he left him in a manner naked. Hauing committed this trecherous Act, he returned presently to the Cittie. He that was wounded, making shewe to haue beene dead, rises vp afterward, and creeps to peasants house, who for pitty caused him to be

drest. He was carried to Paris, where soone after one of his Companions sent for me to haue him in cure: and I found that he had the Artere in the wind pipe and the mouth of the stomake (which is the passage for meate &amp; drinke) quite cut. I did sodenly stitch vp the wound taking the Artere, and drawing the two extremites as nere as I could possibly one vnto an other, but not of the mouth of the stomacke, for that it was retired towardes the stomacke, then I applyed remedies vnto his wounde, with astringents and fit Ligatures. As soone as euer he was thus drest, he began to speake, and to name him that had committed this excesse. The murtherer was taken soone after in the Suburbes of Saint Marceau, and was found seized of the patients goods wherevpon hee was put in prison, &amp; the fact verified after the patients death, the which was the fourth day after his wounding. The murtherer was broken soone after and laied vpon a wheele neere vnto Saint Catherine du Valdes Escholiers. M. AMB. PARE. lib. 9. Chap. 31.
            In the first troubles a gentleman hauing ioyned with the troupes that did beseege Moulins in Bourbonois, was so surprized with sicknesse, as hee could hardly followe the Companie which dislodged; and being lodged at a Bakers, called IOHN MON, who seemed to be his friend and seruant, hee had such a confidence in him, as hee had rather staie behinde then goe anie farther, hauing made his host acquainted with his monie, who promised to keepe it safe for him (contrarie to the common course of such men) with an other younger Brother of his of thirteene or foureteene yeares of age. But they wretch kept no promise with them, but contrariwise as soone as night was come, hee led them out of the

house vnto the ditch, where hee did but halfe kill them so as they remayned there Languishing a wholedaie, and could neither liue nor die: Yet no man had compassion of them: But GOD tooke reuenge a while after: for it happened, that this murtherer beeing in gard, a Companion of his shot him by chance through the arme, whereof hee languished for three monethes, and then died madde.

            The Citty of Bourges hauing beene yeelded by the Seignieur of Iuoy during the first troubles, those which had held it before were forbidden to talke within the Cittie nor without, norto meete aboue two togither. Among those which made a pastime, vnder collour of this decree to murther such as they mette talking together, there was one called GARGET, Captaine of the Quarter of Bourbonne, who made a practise of it. Who falling soone after into a burning feuer, did runne vp and downe the streete, blaspheming the name of GOD, calling vpon the Diuill, and saying vnto all, that if any one would go with him into hell, hee would pay his charges, and so he died madde, whereat his Companions did but laugh. In the same History.
            
            PETER MARTIN, a rider in the Kings stable, holding the post in a place called Liege, towards Poitou, a man without reproch, vpon a simple accusation, without any other forme of processe, was condemned by a great Nobleman, during the furie of the first troubles to be drowned. This Nobleman commanded a faulconer of his presently to execute the sentence, vpon paine to bee drowned himselfe if he did it not. The which was done. But GOD stayed not long to take reuenge: for three

dayes after, this Faulconer and a Laquay, being fallen out for the spoiles of this man, they slew one another. The which being reported vnto the Lord, (a most vniust Iudge) it forced him to haue some remorse, and to say openly, that he would it had cost him fiue hundred Crownes, so as this poore Rider had not beene drowned. But it was a small esteeme he made of an innocent mans life. In the same Historie lib. 7.
            Some troupes of Peasants of Couleurs, Cerisiers, and other places in Champagne, hauing committed many murthers and spoiles in diuers places, were defeated here and there, and did in a manner all perish of violent deaths, during the first troubles. I will note here two notable particularities concerning two of those troupes. The one seeking to set fire to a house, fell downe starke dead, being casually shotte with a Harguebuse by one of his companions. The other dragging a poore man and his wife to a post to haue them shotte, receiued a shotte with a Harguebuze, which depriued him of his life, and his prisoners escaped by that meanes. In the same Booke. It hath beene obserued in the last peace, that of a thousand murtherers which haue remained vnpunished in regarde of man, there are not ten which haue not felt the reuenging hand of GOD, and haue not made most wretched ends.
         
         
            Strange, horrible, and very pittifull Accidents.
            IN our time, a Countryman of Beause, who was reasonably well to liue, binding vp sheaues in the field, sent his Sonne home to fetch him some-what, with

whom (being returned) hee was so angry (because hee had stayed longer then he would haue had him) that he flung a great clod of earth at his head, wherewith the boy fell downe dead to the ground. The Father seeing it, couered him with sheaues, and in great dispaire gotte him home to his house, where his wife was bathing her selfe, and giuing suck to a little childe, whereof she was newly deliuered: and went into his barne and hangd himselfe. Which being reported to the poore woman, by one that by chance had beene in the Barne and seene him, with the feare she was in, and hast that she made to runne thither, she let her childe fall into the bath, where it was drowned. Presently therevpon, the poore woman almost beside her selfe with the wofull spectacle which she had seene, finding at her returne the infant drowned, entred likewise into such dispaire, that she went back to the Barne, and there shutting the doore to her, hung her selfe by her husband. What strange and horrible effects of the choller of an ill aduised Father? and how great cause haue Fathers, Mothers, and Children, to recommend themselues humbly and incessantly to GOD.

            In the yeare 1578. a woman in the towne of Bochne, bathing her little child, heard a pretty bigge boy of hers crye very pittifully without doores.

            The yeare 1540. in a Village by Anneberg, a certaine Countrey-man killed and flayed a Calfe, in the presence of some little Children hee had. And being gone abroad not long after about businesse, and his wife forth of doores, the children which were left at home, with a little one lying in the Cradle, went &amp; committed an horrible Acte. They tooke a Knife, and cut the little ones throate: singing, Wee will kill the Calfe. But seeing the bloud, and the little one dead, they began to be affrayde, and went and hidde them in the Furnace of the Stoue. The Mother suspecting nothing, came home, and before she went into the Stoue, kindled a great armefull of Hempe shailes, and threw them into the Furnaces then shee went into the Stoue, and seeing her little one killed and lye bathing in his bloud, shee ranne out into the streete, crying for helpe.

            The twentith day of Nouember 1551. in a Village of Hesse, named Weidenhausen, a woman strangely desperate, hauing shut all the doores of her house, tooke a sharpe Axe, and ran after her eldest Sonne, being some eight yeares of age. Hee perceiuing his Mothers bad minde, ranne away into the Cellar, and hid himselfe behinde a barrell. She lighted a Candle, and sought him vp and downe in euery corner of the Cellar. The Boye seeing her come, held vp both his hands, and with teares be

That done, shee went out of the Cellar, and ranne after a Daughter shee had of fiue yeares olde, whome shee cloue downe to the middle. Behinde the doore stood a pritty ladde of three yeares olde, whome this furie caught by the hayre of the head, and dragged him into a little yarde, where she cut his throate. There lay an Infant of sixe moneths, crying in the Cradle, him shee drew from his rest, and hurled him into the yarde, and at the last chopped off his head. Which done, and no body left, shee stabbed her-selfe with a Knife into the throate: where-with not-with-standing she died not presently. The neighbors that too late had heard the Children crye, after they

had knocked a good while at the doore, in the end brake it open, and finding that pitious spectacle, ranne to the mother, who come to her selfe, and remaining a pritty while after aliue, declared all that had past, and with great acknowledgment of her sinnes, and hope of GODS mercy, yeelded vp the Ghost.

            The yeare 1550. in a certaine village of the countrie of Alsace, one ADAM STECKMAN a labouring man, that gotte his liuing by dressing of Vines, hauing receiued wages of a maister of his that had set him on worke, went to the Tauerne and lost his money at Cardes. Being exceedingly griued, and therevpon taken with a paine in his head, hee fell into desperation. Easter come, his wife, constrained by necessity, tooke her eldest sonne with her, &amp; went to worke in the Vines: desiring her husband to looke to the house &amp; children til she came againe. Being alone, he fell into such thoughts, that ouercome with despaire by reason of his pouerty, he determined to make himselfe away. Wherevpon he tooke an Hammer and sought vp and downe for a place where he might knock in a nayle to fasten a corde on, and hang himselfe. But finding none to his minde, a girle he had of seuen yeares old, came vnto him &amp; asked him what he sought: without answering her, he went into the Stoue, where a little boy som-what yonger followed him and asked him for bread: bring me a knife, said he, and I will giue thee some. The girle ran and fet him one: wherwith he cut both their throates, and another little ones in the cradle. The mother at her returne seeing that pitious spectacle, swouned, and died with griefe. The murtherer was apprehended, &amp; executed as he deserued. The same.

                in Hesse, asking his wife for his dinner, &amp; she otherwaies busied, not making such hast as he would haue had her, the wretch went &amp; cut off one of the thighes of a little child he had lying in the Cradle, and carried it to the Mother, saying: Hold thee, take this giggot, and go rost it. GASPAR GOLET VVRM, in the Treatise of Meruailes.
            
            The same yeare, a woman great with child, in the Diocesse of the County of Isenberg, gently intreated her husband to inuite certaine women to dinner, whō she ment to haue at her labour. Hee surprised with strange fury, spurned and kicked her with his feet, then stabbed her in diuers places with his dagger, &amp; killed her togither with her fruite. The same. It is 40▪ yeares agoe, or thereabout, that a certaine Italian named BARTHOLMEVV, being ouerthrowne in a certaine sute he had at Venice, which concerned his whole estate, so much forgot the power and mercy of GOD, that hee concluded with himselfe, that his three daughters when they came to age, insteed of being honorably maried, were of necessitie to be prostituted. To preuent the which he found no other meane (in his shop of whom he then tooke counsell, &amp; that had put such a conclusiō in his head) then to cut their throats while they were yong: which he executed one night, hauing to that end borrowed a Barbers Rasor, the euening before. The next day, euery one ranne to see that pitious spectacle, and found that one of his daughters had her hand almost halfe cut off, wherewith it is to be presumed she had thought to haue resisted the fathers rage. The report went afterward that this wretch had throwne himselfe downe headlong from the top of a certaine mountaine, towards the County of Tirol, whither he was fled.

A Switzer hauing taken his wife in adultery, &amp; pardoned her for the time, a little while after bethought himselfe, and reuoking that pardon, killed her: alledging he could not endure a woman that had plaied him such a pranke. Afterward, he dispatched his children likewise, saying, he would not haue children, that should be called the children of a whore. And it is said, that when he had murthered his wife and children, he also murthered himselfe, falling downe headlong from the top of a high Tower, hauing first written in a paper, which he pinned about him, the fact he had committed, and the reasons which had induced him therevnto, and that knowing he should die for the said fact, hee chose rather to execute himselfe, then to suffer a shamfull death. In the same treatise. A Millanois about the yeare 1560▪ vnderstanding in France that his wife plaid false with him, and (as it is to be supposed) being thereof thorowly informed, tooke post horse, and rode home to Milan. where alighting, he went not in, but sent for his wife to the dore, who comming to him, and seeming to be very ioyfull of his returne, he shot her thorow with his Pistoll, which done, he suddenly mounted againe on his horse, and saued himselfe. In the same treatise. About the same time, or a little after, a woman of Switzerland hauing receiued another into her bed in steed of her husband, &amp; perceiuing afterward that she had beene deceiued, and that it was not her husband that had line with her, was so ouercome with anger and griefe, that she went and drowned her selfe.

            IOVIAN PONTANVS recounts, that an Italian Lord hauing killed one whom he suspected with his wife, was so straightly besieged by his brother, that out of all hope to escape, he killed her first, &amp; his children after, and then

threw himselfe downe headlong from the highest towre of his Castle. Wherevpon the brother of him that was killed, most cruelly murthered all such as he could meet withall, and knew to be any way of kinne to that Italian Lord. In the same Treatise.
            
            A yong Spanish Maide, hauing abandoned her selfe to a Gentleman, vpon promise of marriage, which he had made her, though she were but meanly descended, vnderstanding that he was married to another, conceiued such hatred against him, that she conspired his death by all the meanes possible she could deuise. And at last vsed this same: shee perswaded him by her flattering letters to come againe and see her. The time appointed, she attended him, hauing made all things ready, with the ayde of an old woman confederat with her, for to intreate him as her wicked minde, prouoked with an extreame desire of reuenge, counselled her vnto. Wherfore the better to accomplish her designe, although at first she had receiued him with teares &amp; complaints, yet seeming at length to be satisfied with reasons that he alledged, and to bee som-what appeased, she permitted him to vse the same priuitie with her as before. Wherevpon the Gentleman got him to bed, and she with him, staying but till he was a sleepe for to execute her furious enterprise: which she performed, &amp; not contented with many mortall wounds that she had giuen him (for awaking at the first, he found himselfe so pestered with a corde, which the old woman drew ouer him, that he was not able to stirre either hand or foote) she vsed diuerse cruelties against the dead bodie, before the furie of her rage could be extinguished. And for this strange murther she was beheaded, hauing voluntarily accused her selfe. In the same Treatise.
            
            
               The Wife of GEORGE WEDERING of Halberstad, of the age of 24. yeares, modest and vertuous, beeing brought in bed the 15. of Nouember 1557. of a Daughter baptised the next day, was not found in her bed. The seruant hearing the Childe crie, came to the bed, thinking to finde her Misters, and to awake her. Being amazed at her absence, shee runnes to her Master, who being wonderfully perplexed, takes the Childe in his armes, and seekes the Mother in euery corner of the house. The streetes were couered with snowe, so as there was no shewe that she had past out of the house. In the end the husband and the seruant with others, went into the seller, but they here some trampling in the wel which was neere vnto it. The husband much perplexed calls to his neighbours, and tells them his misery, wherevpon they heard one in a gardine which knocked at the doore, and hauing opened it, they see the poore woman almost dead with colde, complayning that she had beene long in the well, as her apparell did witnesse. Being demanded howe shee came into this well beeing closse, and which had but a verie little entrance, shee could giue no reason, neither was there any one that could conceiue howe it came. Beeing afterwards very sicke for some daies shee beganne to recouer her helth, so as the 24. of December shee did rise, swadled her Child and set her downe to dinner. The maide going into the Celler to drawe beere, she goes to bed and falls a sleepe. The seruant being returned findes her mistresse a sleepe, and the Cradle emptie. Being amazed shee runnes to the well, comming vnto her minde, and sees the Infant vpon the water, the which was taken out by two of the Senators of the Towne, in the presence of CONRADE de la PERCH,

Minister of the Church. The Mother slept soundly. After they had praied at her beds feete, shee opened her eyes, and began to say vnto the assistants, why haue you awaked me? I did enioye an vnspeakable content. I haue seene my the Sauiour, and I haue heard the Angells, falling a sleepe againe, after foure houres she did awake, remembers her child and calls for it, and finding it not, she afflicts and torments her selfe after a pittifull manner. A certaine man named IOHN GVY, Sonne to EME GVY a Capper in the towe of Chastillon vpon Lion, had bin very disordred all his life, caused for the most part by the indulgence of his parents. It happened one Sater day in September 1565. that the Sonne was debauched according to this custome, and returned home very late, wherat the Father was much displeased, saying, that seeing he continued this wicked course, he should be in the end constrayned to chase him out of his companie. To whome the Sonne (beeing full of pride,) answered presomptuously, that he was ready to depart, euen presētly, so as they would giue him his clothes: vpon this dispute the Father went to bed, beeing forced to threaten his Sonne, if he would not be silent. In the ende, seeing that hee preuailed not, and not able any longer to beare the proude replies of his Sonne, hee rise out of his bedde in chollor to punnish his vndutifullnesse: who seeing his Father approche in choller to beate him, hee sodenly layed his hand vpon his sword, and rebelling against his Father, thrust him through the Bodie. wherevpon hee fell sodenly to the ground, crying out with a loude voice that hee was dead. The neighbours amazed at this crie, came in presently, and soone after the Iustice: who found the olde man layed all along readie to giue

vp the Ghost, dying presently after. The bloudie sword was also found by his Sonne, who warmed himselfe, to whome the Father (mooued with compassion, and forgetting the crueltie hee had vsed against him,) had often saied. Sonne saue thy selfe. I pardon thee my death: the Mother had also giuen him the like councell to escape: but GOD by his power did so staie him, as hee had no power to flie. Beeing carried to prison and examined, at the first hee couered his parricyde, accusing his Father that hee had slaine himselfe. But his excuses beeing found friuolous, hee was condemned to haue his right hand cut off, then to bee pinched with hot pincers, and in the ende hanged by the feete vpon a gibet, and strangled with a stone of sixe score pound which should bee hanged at his necke. A wicked counterfet beeing prisoner with him, aduised him to appeale vnto Paris. But hauing freely confessed the Parricide, hee reuoked his appeale and was executed.

The internall parts beeing hurt, bring death foure waies; either through necessity of their function and office, as the Lunges: or by reason of the excellency of their nature, as the Hart: or through much losse of bloud as the Liuer, the great arteries, and veines: or through the malignity of Symptomes and accidents, as the neruie parts, the ventricle, and bladder. Although some parts be incurable, yet are they not mortall of absolute necessity: otherwise, death would ensue vpon the incurable hurts of boanes, gristles, and lygaments.

            Of Comets.
            
               IN this Section I will briefly represent the Comets seene in Europe for these hundred yeares or thereabouts, adding that which GARCEVS in his Meteorologie, LICHOSTENES and others haue obserued vpon this point. In the yeare 1500. in the moneth of Aprill, a Comet appeared in the North, vnder the signe of Capricorne. The same yeare Prince CHARLES was borne, afterwards Emperor, the 5. of that name: and SOLYMAN Sultan of the Turkes. Soone after folowed the spoile, which the Tartares made in Polonia, the famine in Swabe; a plague throughout all Germanie; the taking of Naples by the French; A rising of the peasants in the Bishop rike of Spire, against the Bishop and the Canons: the taking of Modon and some other places in Morea by the Turkes: ISMAEL Sophie expelled out of the kingdome of Persia by the Turkes, whereof they ceazed. The second yeare after the plague, made a horrible spoile, almost throughout all the whole world, the which had for fore-runners, figures of crosses falling out of the ayre vpon mens clothes. A warre followed in Bauaria two yeares after this plague. after the which many great men, both spirituall &amp; temporal died. The Emperor

MAXIMILIAN the 1. vanquished the Guelders; and then the Hongariens, whom he reduced vnder his obedience. In the yeare 1506. a Comet appeared in August towards the North, couering the signes of Leo and Virgo, hauing neere vnto the Chariot a thick and shining taile, stretched out betwixt the wheeles of this Chariot, for which cause some Astronomers called it the Peacocks taile. In September after, died PHILIP the 1. king of Spaine, father to CHARLES and FERDINAND Emperors. The same yeare the Turkes were defeated in battaile by the Persians, and on the other side, they tooke Modon in Morea from the Christians, and defeated their fleete. Then followed a ciuill warre betwixt BAIAZET and his sonne SELIM: and FRANCIS SPORCE Duke of Milan, was taken in Italy by the French. As for that which happened in the following yeares, the History of our time doth shew it, as well in respect of warres, Inundations, death of famous men, and merueilous alterations in Europe, the causes whereof we will attribute to the iust iudgements of GOD, punishing the sinnes of the world: we say only that Comets seeme oftentimes to be fore-runners and Trumpets of the wonderfull iudgements of the Lord, as a French Poet speaking of a Comet seene in the yeare 1577. said in the 2. day of his weeke.
            
               O frantick France! why doost not thou make vse,
               Of the strange signes, whereby the Heauens induce
               Thee to repentance? canst thou teare-lesse gaze,
               Euen night by night on that prodigious blaze,
               That hairy Comet, that long streaming Starre,
               Which threatens Earth, with Famine, Plague, and Warre:
               (The Almighties Trident, and three forked fire,
               Wherewith he strikes vs in his greatest ire?)
            
            But let vs consider the other Comets, according to the

order of the yeares. In Nouember 1523. there was seene a Comet, and soone after, the heauens seemed all on fire, casting forth infinite flames of lightning vpon the earth, the which did tremble: afterwards there hapned strange Inundations of water in the realme of Naples. Soone after followed the taking &amp; captiuity of Francis 1. King of France: Germanie was troubled with horrible seditions. LEVVIS King of Hungary was slaine in battaile against the Turkes. There were wonderfull stirres throughout all Europe, and Rome was taken and spoiled by the imperiall Armie. In the same yeare of the taking and sack of Rome, which was 1527. there was seene another more fearefull Comet then the precedent: there followed after it the great spoiles which the Turkes made in Hungary: a famine in Swabe, Lombardie, and at Venice: warre in Zuitzerland: the siege of Vienna in Austria: the Sweat▪ in England: the ouer-flowing of the Sea in Holland and Zeland, where it drowned a great Country, and an Earthquake in Portugall▪
                which continued eight dayes.
            In the yeare 1531. from the 6. of August vnto the 3. of September, there appeared a Comet, marching slowly by the signes of Cancer, Leo, Virgo, &amp; Libra, the which was followed by many troubles &amp; great changes in Germany, in Denmarke and else-where: and another Comet was seene the yeare following greater then it. Soone after in the yeare 1533. appeared an other Comet in the end of Iuly. Historians write the wonderfull changes which followed it. Those of the yeare 1538. 1556. 1558. and in the following yeares vnto this age,

               aue bin wonderfull, hauing Ecclipses of the Sunne most commonly going before them. And as for that which hath happened since in Europe, no man is ignorant thereof, if hee bee not

exceeding ignorant. The most fearfull of all the Comets in our time, was that in the yeare 1527▪ for the sight of it strooke such a terror into many, as some died, others fell sick. It was seene of many thousands of people, seeming very long and of a bloudy colour. On the top therof was seene the representation of a crooked arme holding a great sword in his hand, as if he would strike. At the point of this sword were three starres▪ but that which toucht the point directly, was more cleere and shining then the rest. On either side of the beames of this Comet were seene many battle-axes, daggers, bloudy swords, among the which they did marke a great number of mens heads cut off, hauing their beards &amp; haire horribly curled. And haue we not seene for the space of 3

But we may not forget the new starre, as great as the day starre, the which appeared among the fixed Starres, neere vnto Cassiopeia the 9. of Nouember 1572. hauing the forme of a Lozenge. CORNELIVS GEMMA and other learned Astronomers, which haue written Bookes thereof, say that it continued still in one place for the space of three weekes, and they hold that it resembled the starre the which appeared to the Wisemen comming to adore IESVS CHRIST in Bethlehem, presently after his birth. It continued in the firmament 9. moneths or there abouts. Others say that it lasted vntill the beginning of March 1574. fading by little and little. GEMMA speakes wonders in the 2. Booke of the Cosmocritique. Chap. 3. But for that he doth discourse &amp; dispute thereof at large, it shall suffice vs to note this wonder, the which he esteemes merueilous (as in deed it was) among all the extraordinary wonders of Heauen, since the natiuitie of our Sauiour.

               HVSSAN AGA one of SVLTAN SOLIMANS Chamberlins, sent by his Maister to treat a Peace, with the Persian, according to the commision that was giuen him, hee seazed vpon BAIAZET sonne to SOLIMAN, beeing prisoner in Persia, and by the fathers commandment strangled him with a bow-string. His foure sonnes past the same way. Flying out of Amasia hee had left one newely borne, the which SOLIMAN had caused to bee carried to Prusse in Bithinia, where it was brought vp. But newes being come, that BAIAZET was dispatcht, SOLIMAN sent a grome of his Chamber (in whom he trusted much,) to Prusse, to put this little Infant to death. This Eunuch or Grome of his Chamber, being a man of a milde disposition, had carryed with him one of the Vshers of the Chamber (a man fit to execute all desperate and bloudy Commissions) to vse him for the strangling of BAIAZETS little sonne. He enters into the Chamber, and putting the cord about the childes neck to strangle him, the Infant began to smile on him, and rising vp, stretcheth forth his little armes to imbrace him, striuing to kisse him. This countenance did so moue the heart of this Barbarian, as not able to passe any further, hee fell downe dead in a swone.
            The Eunuch amazed at his long stay, goes vp, and offring to enter, he found the Vsher lying all along at the Chamber dore, but not daring to fayle in his Commission, hee strangled this poore Infant with his owne

hands. Which shews that the Grand-father SOLIMAN had not spared his little grand-child a while, for any pity that he had; but delayed it according to the opinion of the Turkes, who say that GOD is the author of all things that are done, so as the euent bee to their liking. And therefore so long as BAIAZETS affaires were in any doubt or suspence▪ SOLIMAN would not haue the little Infant toucht: least that if hee did prosper, they would say, that SOLIMAN had resisted the will of GOD. But after the death of BAIAZET (held as it were condemned by a diuine decree, seeing had beene disapointed of his disseignes, and then rooted out) SOLIMAN resolued that the child was no longer to bee kept.

               FERRAND of S.

It is very credibly reported, that at Lectore a Town in Gascony one had a child at 9. yeares of age. Shee is yet liuing, called IOAN DE PEIRIE who was married to VIDAV BEGHE, beeing in his life time Receiuer of the Fines for the King of Nauarre in that place: she miscarried

of a Sonne at the age of 9. yeares, then at 11. she had a Daughter which liued, and hath had children: at 14. she had a sonne called LAVRENCE, yet liuing: at 16. an other also liuing, called PETER. Fiue yeares after, which was the 21. yeare of her age she had a daughter, at this day Widow to an Apoticary: And then she left being with child: although her husband liued: shee was a little Woman nor very corpulent, who in Aprill 1577. was 44. yeares old. I haue seene her and talked with her fully of these matters. She told mee among other things, that after her first child, whereof shee miscarried being but 9. years old, she had alwaies her courses very orderly.

               LVCHIN VIVALDE a rich Gentleman of Genoa, yong, goodly and of a good fashion, fell extreamely in in loue with a poore yong Maid, that was exceeding fayre, called IANIQVETTE, and tryed all meanes possible to winne her for his Concubine. But it was in vaine; this Virgins chastetye

was inuincible, who in the ende was married to a Bankerour, with whom although shee liued by the labour of her hands with paine, yet shee carried her selfe virtuously, and had many children in this loyall marriage. LVCHIN, who had married a fayre and rich Gentlewoman, by the aduice of his kins-folkes, did not leaue to loue IANIQVETTE still, and vnder pretext of fauour and good will to the Bankerout, hee laboured to corrupt his Wife, who was constant and immoueable, to the great amazement of LVCHIN, who admired this singular virtue; and in the end seemed to su

It happened (during this time) that the Bankerout was taken prisoner by Pyrats, and carryed away, so as his wife at one instant seemed to bee opprest with extreame want and dispayre. The dearth was great at Genoa, shee was charged with fowre or fiue small children, crying for bread which shee wanted, and all humane meanes to helpe them. Motherly charity driues her to a resolution of dispayre.

Beeing prostrate at his feete, shee said, shee was come to yeeld her selfe vnto him, that she was ready to submit her selfe wholly vnto his will, without any resistance, as shee had formerly done: beseeching him to releeue her poore children opprest with hunger. LVCHIN surprised by contrary motions, was in the end vanquished by reason, and poslest with a good spirit, hee sayd vnto the poore woman kneeling at his feete.

            Of a Mans body hardened or become a stone.
            
               IN the yeare, 1596. Monsieur BILLIOCTI, an honourable person of the Towne of Aix in Prouence, being at Lions, he reported to the Lord &amp; Lady of Botheon, (many others beeing present) and then set it down vnder his owne hand, that which followeth. In the yeare 1583. a Cittizen of Aix in Prouence, hauing a place planted with Oliues a Harguebuse shot from the Gates of the Towne, he resolued one day to cause a certaine little rocke to be broken which was in this Orchard. Hauing well aduanced the work, there was found in the middest of the Rocke, the body of a Man whole, of a small stature, incorporated within the Rocke, in such sort as the stone of the rocke did fill vp the voide places that were betwixt one member and another. And that which was yet more admirable, although the bones were very much hardened, yet in scraping them with your nayle, they went to powder. But the marrow of them was so hard as no stone was more, neither was it possible to pull any awaye. His

Brayne was so hardened and stony, as with an iron (such as the strike fire with) the sparkles would flye, as out of a flint. All these things of the braine &amp; marrow remayned in the custody of Maister BALTHAZER de la Barle dwelling at Aix, and first Audiencer in the Chancery of Prouence. All this aboue written I haue seene with mine eyes said BILLIOCTI, being a good witnesse, hauing held in my hands the Braine of this body couered with a skull of one side. The which I attest to bee true. In witnesse whereof I haue signed this present, the 22. of Nouember 1596. BILLIOCTI. Memoires of Lions.
            
         
         
            Guilty Consciences.
            
               THere is no ramper to a good conscience, nor a crueller torment thē an euill. Examples of the one and the other are infinite. As for the terrors of conscience caused by the remembrance of misdeedes, especially in regard of innocent bloud, behold some histories. A certaine Host being a man of good reckoning in a town of Germany had one only daughter, well qualified and of good meanes. The seruant of the house, an honest &amp; a proper man, sued to haue her in mariage: but was denyed, by reason he was a stranger and a poore seruant. Neuerthelesse because he had alwayes shewed himselfe faithfull, the goodman going to the Bath with his wife and daughter, left him the charge of his house. During their absence, a Merchant came to this Inne, where the night following he had his throate cut by this seruant, who buried him in the stable, and the next day sold his horse &amp; apparell. This murtherer remained vnknowne.

The Host returned frō the bath, &amp; thinking his seruant had gouerned his house as he ought, began to loue &amp; esteeme him more then euer he had done before. Not long after the Murtherer bethought him of a wile. Hee counterfetted letters, in certain of his kins folkes names, which aduertised him of his fathers death, and therfore councelled him to come downe into the Country. Returning frō market, he shewed these letters, &amp; 80 peeces of Gold to his Maister: adding that though his friends had willed him to buy a horse, he would not be at such charge, but was minded to go a foote; and that he vndertooke this iourney very vnwillingly as desiring nothing more then to continue still with his said maister To whō hauing giuen the most part of his gold to keep, with promise to returne again, he went his way. Though it were some-what discommodious at that time for the Good-man to let him goe, yet thinking those letters to be true, he gaue him leaue. Within a while after hee came againe, and committed a greater summe vnto his Maister, giuing him to vnderstand that his father had left him very much, and played his part so well that the Host gaue him his daughter to wife, and finally hee became heyre to his father in-lawe: and in time because he carried himselfe exceeding honestly, he was elected into the number of the Magistrates of the towne: wherin hee so well discharged his duty, that there was noe fault to bee found in him. But his Conscience so tormented him, that condemned by it, hee chose rather to accuse himselfe and di
                  •…
               , then to languish any longer. Beeing one day called by his fellowe Magistrates to sit vppon a certaine Murtherer, hee rose betimes in the morning, and going to heare Masse, desired his

Wife, with whom he had alwayes liued very quietly &amp; louingly, to make him ready some good bit or other, alleadging hee was not very well, and was to bee that daye at an Araignment. Beeing returned home from Masse, hee was told that there was a Calues head prouided for his Break-fast, a meate which hee loued maruaylous well. Desirous to see it, hee opened the Cupbord where it was: but seized with horrour and feare, hee asked who had locked vp a mans head into the Cupbord? his Wife shewed him that hee was deceiued: where-vpon comming to himselfe, he made a light breakfast, and going to the Councell Chamber, sate downe in his accustomed place. When it came to him to deliuer his opinion, hauing declared that by the Lawes the Murtherer vpon whom they sat was to loose his head, he stood vp, and sayd, that hee had also deserued the like punishment. Where vpon hee declared in order the circumstances of the murther by him perpetrated in his late Maisters house, and all that had insued thereof▪ earnestly desiring them, that hee might bee beheaded. Some thinking that some melancholy humour made him talke so, counselled him to go home, and get Physitions about him. Where-vnto he answered saying, I knowe you haue a good opinion of mee: and indeede I am not culpable of any Cryme punishable by mans Lawe, but this same. Notwithstanding I instantly beseech you to take my head from my shoulders, and so deliuer mee from the horrible torment I haue indured &amp; that iustly, euer since the time of my offence. Therwith the Iudges caused the place to be digged, which he had told of, where the bones of the murtherd Merchāt according to his saying were found

wherevpon he was lead of his owne accord to the place of execution, and beheaded with the other murtherer. IOHN IAMES GRYNEVS, a learned diuine, in his Commentary on the Proghet IONAS, Chap. 1. pag. 123. &amp;c.
            
            I haue heard that not many yeares since a certaine man in the towne of Lipsic went of his owne accord to the Iudge of the place, vnto whome he voluntarily confessed that hee was one of them which had robbed the Electors waggons of Saxony, adding that he had rather die, then endure the torment of his conscience any longer. The same Author
            
            Some forty sixe yeares agoe or thereabout two brothers dwelling at Lausanna, and hewing wood in the mount Iura, the younger fell out vpon some slight occasion with the elder, and gaue him such a blowe with his axe on the head, that hee ouerthewe him to the ground, where he made an end of him, and then buried him. Returning home, hee told their Mother that his sayd Brother had willed him to excuse him vnto her, and was gon into Germanie, for to see the Country, hoping to bee at home againe by such a time. Their Mother being therewith satisfied, the murtherer went vp euery day to the mountaine, and kneeling downe on his brothers graue, wept very bitterly and asked GOD forgiuenesse. Hauing continued thus certaine monethes, and neuer suspected of any such matter, comming one day from the mountaine, as hee was almost at home, hee looked behinde him, and spied the Burgomaister, (which is the chiefest magistrate of that place vnder the protection of the Canton of Berne) followed by an Officer in his liuery, he ranne away as fast as he could to the other end of the towne. The Burgomaister meruayling at it, commanded

his officer to runne after him. The Officer followed him, and cryed stoppe him, stoppe him. Wherevpon diuers came running into the streete and staied him. The Burgomaister, a wise man, committed him to prison, where hauing examined him, hee confessed the whole matter vnto him, and was executed as he deserued, going to his death with such constancie and penitent sorrowe for his offence, that all that beheld him melted into teares. I receiued this discourse from an excellent personage, that was present at his arraignement, and sawe his end.
            
            One called N. LAINE, borne at Tholouse, hauing attempted his Fathers death, escaped away, and got to Geneua, where hee continued a certaine time vnknowne. Vpon a day walking along by the Towne ditch, and espying some of the Magistrates with their Officers afarre off, hee ranne as fast hee could towards the bridge of Arua, which was hard by, for to saue himselfe in another Seignorie. The Officers ranne after him, and with the aide of those that met him on the way, apprehended him: who presently in his owne talke bewrayed himselfe. Beeing caryed to pryson and kept verie close, at last hee confessed his detestable attempt. The Magistrates of Geneua sent an Herauld to Tholouse, and by a Coppy of his indictment, which was sent them, vnderstood the truth of LAINES confessions, who was executed, and euen to the very last gaspe shewed a liuely and notable repentance of his faults.

            Eceeding strange Crueltie punnished.
            
               THe yeare 1514. happened the horrible sedition &amp; butchery of the Croysadoes in Hungary. There was a generall discōtent amongst the people against the King and the chiefest of the realme, because they went not about to conquer those places againe from the Turke (then very much entangled elswhere) which hee held in Hungary. But King LADISLAVS louing his ease, little regarded it, and his Nobles ruled him in such sort that he commanded them in nothing. Therevpon the Popes Legat publyshed pardons for all those that would Crosse themselues to go warre against the Turke. Suddainely there gathered togither a wonderfull Company of theeues and robbers, from euerie corner of Hungarie. And therewith all great multitudes of the Commons (not able any longer to beare the insolencies of the Nobility, much lesse of the Bishops) flocked from all partes to the Campe. The Kings negligence had giuen liberty to the intollerable dissolutnes and Cruel
                  •…
               ie of the Lords ouer their subiects. This army of Commons hauing created them a generall, in an instant dispersed themselues &amp; cōmitted a most horrible spoile almost all ouer Hungarie: murthering al the Gentlemen and Bishops they could meete with all. The richest &amp; those that were noblyest descended were empaled aliue. This cruell rage contynuing, the King began to stir, &amp; by his cōmand certaine townes ioyning their forces to a number of the Nobilitie vnder the conduct of a Lord named BORNEMISSE, had

some Conficts with those Croysadoes, wherein a great sort of them were slaine, &amp; many taken which were executed in the Capitall Citty of the Realme. Finally IOHN the Sonne of VAIVODE STEVEN▪ (that afterwards possessed himselfe of the kingdome) defeated them in a set Battaile, and hauing cut the most part of them in peeces, hee tooke their Leaders, whome hee put to death with such strange torments as I haue horror to remember it, for he caused the Generall of these Peasants called GEORGE, to be stript naked, vpon whose head the executioner set a Crowne of hot burning iron: then he opened some of his veines, and made LVCATIVS his Brother drinke the bloud which issued from them. After that the cheefest of the Peasants (who had beene kept three dayes without meate were brought forth, and forced to fall vpon the bodie of GEORGE (yet breathing) with their teeth, and euery one to teare away and eate a peece of it. In the midest of these horrible torments, GEORGE neuer cryed; but onelie bee-sought them to take pittie of his Brother LVCATIVS, whome hee had forciblie drawne into that warre. GEORGE beeing torne in peeces, his bowells were pulled out and cut into morcells, and some beeing boyled and the rest roasted, the Prisoners were constrained to feede on them: which done all that remayned with LVCATIVS were put to most horrible and Languishing deathes. An example of greater crueltie can hardly be-founde since the world was a world. And no meruaile if GOD hath punished the King and the Realme of Hungary for such strange and extraordinarie Cruelties, suffring the cruelest people of the North, namely the Turkes, to make that spoile which they haue and continually yet doe there. Cruell

chastisments are prepared for them that bee cruell and inhumaine. The following Bookes shall represent a great number of other Histories of strange accidents and cruelties. IOACH: CVREVS in his Annales of Silesia, pag. 233.
            During the Peasants warre in Germanie, in the yeare 1525. both before and since, a Gentleman their enemy, not content to haue massacred a great number, euen of those which had humbly craued pardon of him, confessing that they had beene ill aduised, hee gloryed in all companies of his braue exploites, adding therevnto a commendation of his thefts, hauing cut many good purses, and slaine great store of Cattell. Some moneths after this furie, he fell sicke, and languished many dayes of an extreame paine in the Reines of his backe, the which thrust him into such despaire, as hee did not cease to curse and denie his Creator, (who is patient, iust, and fearefull in reuenge,) vntill that both speech and life failed him. The seueritie of GODS Iustice doth yet pursue his house: for soone after, his eldest Sonne seeking to exalt the prowesse and valour of his Father, who in the Peasants warre had done wonders aboue mentioned, and excelled all his companions: and vanting much of these valiant exploites in an open assembly at a Banquet, a Country-man, mooued at this brauerie, drawes out his Dagger, and strikes him dead vpon the place. Some fewe dayes after, the plague falles into this cruell mans house, and kills all that remained.
            In the yeare 1577. in the beginning of September, the fire of the second troubles being kindled in France: the President of Birague, (afterwards Chancellor

and Cardinall) being at that time Gouernor of Lion, there were then in Lion, two Bretheren called BOVRGATS, Gold-smiths by their professions, but very much disordered. As the liberty of those times did giue meanes to many to glutte their passions vpon them whome they did mallice: the BOVRGATS laide hands vpon a companion of theirs a Dyer, vpon pretext that hee was of a contrarye religion: but it was to reuenge them-selues for a quarrell which they had formerly against him, and not ended to their liking. They take him and lead him to their dwelling house, towardes the Abbey of Esnay, beeing out of the way, farre from resort of people. They binde him fast hand and foote▪ and then tye him by the neck vnto the Chimney, so as hee did hang vpright, not being able to sitte nor leane any way. They leaue him in this sort a whole day, threatning him with present death. At night they bring in men of their owne sorte and liuing to Supper, to bee spectators of this Tragedie: they are merry and make good cheere, and after Supper they spend the time, some in playing at Cardes, others in pinching, pricking, and burning the nose of this poore prisoner, being bond hand and foote, and tyed in the corner of the Chimney. This continued vntill eleuen of the clocke at night, when their companions went away and retyred. As for the BOVRGATS, with-out proceeding any further, they cast themselues clothed, with their Swordes by their sides, vpon a Bedde, where they both fell presently a sleepe. Their Laquay (who was in the corner of the Chimney,) doth as the Maisters. The prisoner perceiuing them all a sleepe, and

If he had had a Table cloath, a Sheete or a Couering, hee might haue slipt downe by the windowe: but in opening it, the noyse might awake them, so as they might followe him and ouer take him, the wayes beeing strongly and very straightly garded: In this greeuous perplexitie, hee discouers, that the Laquay (who slept in the other corner of the Chimney) had a Dagger at his Girdle. Hee therefore resolues to kill those two brothers his enemies with this Dagger.
            But there was some difficultie and hazard in the taking of it, for that the Laquaye awaking would giue the Alarum, yet by the light of the fire, hee comes softely vnto him, and drawes out his Dagger, so quickly, and in such sorte as the Laquay stirred not. Hauing it, hee sodenly went vp into the Chamber, and leaped vpon the BOVRGATS, and stabbes eyther of them in the brest with this Dagger. As hee would haue doubled his stroake, one of them leapes vp and layes hold of an Halbard which stood hard by, he runs after the Dyer, who flyes downe the staires apace to

saue himselfe, at the foote whereof this BOVRGAT fell, and presently dyed. The Dyer mounts againe, and findes the other dead in the Chamber. Hee begins to threaten the Laquaye to kill him presently, if he made any noise: hee tooke a Candle, lead the Laquey into the Seller, and forceth him to eate, and to drinke a Glasse of Wine, then hee bindes him surely, dooing him no other harme, barres the Sellar doore, comes vp and takes that which was easiest to bee transported, out of his enemies Chamber. And at the breake of daye, the Gardes beeing raysed, hee leaues the house lockt, and so gettes out at Saint SEBASTIANS gate, without any hinderance or staye, the which was to bee admired, seeing they suffered none to goe out but with a Pasporte. The friends and companions of BOVRGATS, seeing them neyther in the morning nor after Dinner, grewe into some doubt, and after notice giuen to the Captaine of the Quarter, vnder whome these BOVRGATS had charge and command, with his consent, they brake open the doore, and then drewe forth the Laquay, who cryed for helpe in the Sellar, and found the rest as wee haue sayde. The Dyer liued some time after, and reported this Historie to many, and dyed else-where. Memoires of Lion.

            SYMON GRINEVS a learned personage, among many of our time, being gone from Heidelberg to Spire, in

the yeare 1529. where there was an Imperiall Dyet held, was desirous to heare a certaine Preacher much esteemen for his eloquence. But hearing many propositions come from him against the Maiestie and trueth of the Sonne of GOD. At the end of the Sermon: he followed the Preacher, saluted him courteously, and intreated him to heare him with patience. They enter mildly into discourse. GRINEVS shewes him his errors grauely and plainely, and puts him in minde what POLICARPVS (a Disciple to the Apostles) was accustomed to doe: if he chanced to heare any vntrueth or blasphemy in the Church: exhorting him in the name of GOD to thinke of his conscience, and to leaue his erronious opinions. The Preacher cuts him off short, seeming to haue a desire to conferre more priuatly, as hauing hast to goe home to his house: He demands GRINEVS name, and surname, and his lodging, in
                  •…
               iting him to see him the next day, to discourse more amply together, and makes great shew to affect GRINEVS friendship: adding, that the publicke should receiue great profit by this their conference. Moreouer he shewes GRINEVS his house, who resolued to visit him at the houre appointed, and so retires to his Inne. But the Preacher distempered with his censure, deuised in his thoughts, a prison, a Scaffold, and death, for GRINEVS: who dining with many worthy men, reported vnto them, what speeches hee had had with this Preacher. Therevpon one calls for Doctor PHILIP, beeing set at the Table neere vnto GRINEVS, who goes out of the Stoue, and findes a graue olde man, of a louely countenance, well apparelled, and vnknowne, who with a graue and

pleasing speech began to say: That within one houre there would Officers come into the Inne, sent from the King of the Romaines, to carrie GRINEVS to prison. The old man addes there-with-all a commandement to GRYNEVS to dislodge speedily out of Spire, exhorting PHILIP not to deferre it▪ And then the olde man vanished away. Doctor PHILIP, who hath reported this History, In his Comentarie vpon the Prophet Daniel, Chap. 10. addes these wordes: I came vnto the companie, and deliuered what the olde man had sayd vnto me, willing them to rise from the Table. Presently we crost the Market place, hauing GRINEVS in the middest of vs, and went directly to the Rhine, which GRINEVS past speedily with his seruant, in a Boate. Seeing him in safety we returned to the Inne, where it was told vs, that presently after our departure, the Sergeants were come to seeke for GRINEVS. GOD be praised, who hath giuen vs his Angels for Gardiens, that with more peacefull thoughts wee may doe our duties in the vocation where-vnto he hath called vs.
            In the yeare 1539. in the beginning of Iune, an honest widow-woman, charged with two Sonnes in Saxony, hauing not where-with-all to liue in a time of great famine, attyred her selfe and her Sonnes in their best clothes, going towards a certaine Fountaine to pray vnto GOD, to haue pittie of them and to releeue them. Comming forth, shee meetes with a graue man, who salutes her courteously, and after some speech, hee demands of her, if shee thought to finde any thing to eate at that Fountaine? The woman answered; Nothing is impossible to GOD. If it were not difficult for

him to feed the Children of Israell forty yeares in the desert, should it bee troublesome to nourish mee and mine with water? Speaking these words with a great courage, this man (whome I holde to haue beene an Angell) sayd vnto her. Seeing thy faith is so constant, returne to thy house, and thou shalt finde three laden with meale, shee rerurned, and did see the effect of this promise.

            In the yeare 1553. the 18. of Nouember, it hapned at Sehilde, a little Towne in the Diocesse of Torge, that VRBAIN ERMTRAVT, an inhabitant of that place, hauing a deepe Well, but halfe drie, by reason of certaine stones that were falne out of the wall, did bargaine with a Mason called VRBAIN HEMBERG, to put those stones into their places. Hauing fitted himselfe with peeces of wood, and a scaffold in the Well, he goes downe lower with a Ladder, to take vp a Hammer which hee had left among the stones. Hee was scarce gone downe, but the earth and stones shake, and fill vp the Well, and couer the Mason who was at the foote of the Ladder. All runne thether, and hold the man to bee smothered, adding that they must fill vp the Well, and that should be his graue. The Iustice resolued, that they should pull out all this rubbish, and ordaines, that the Masons body should be buried among other Christians in the common Church-yard. According to this decree, they begin to worke the 11. of the same moneth. About two of the clocke after noone, the worke-men labour to drawe out a great stone, and finding that it was hollow vnderneth, they put downe a long pole to sound the depth. They pricke the poore Mason on the

nose with the end of this pole, who beganne to crie and to intreate them to drawe him out. The workemen hearing this confused sound labour with more courrage then before, and about ten of the clocke at night they espie him standing right vp behinde the Ladder, beeing vp to the knees in the myer. Beeing all glad, they prepare to drawe him forth. But behold an other fall of Earth which couers him aboue the head. Then euery man thinking that hee was dead, was readie to leaue the worke: but by the aduice and commandement of the Bourguemaster called IAMES le FEVRE, they returne to their worke, and hauing taken awaie the Earth, about mid-night they finde him aliue and without anie hurt, and drawe him out of the well Where hee had beene almost foure daies and foure nights without meate or drinke.

               Sebastians mount towards the red Crosse; this wel being made fortie foote deepe, the earth falls and fills it vp. The poore man beeing in the botome shrowds himselfe vnder aplanke, by meanes whereof he was preserued from this heauy waight of earth, which else would haue smothered him; hauing some meanes to breath, thrusting his fist into the Earth some-times, to haue the more aire. He continued thus couered in the botome seauen daies, without eating, satisfying his stomake with his vrine, and hoping onely in GOD for his deliuery. He cryed out sometimes for helpe, but they heard him not; yet hee heard them that walked, and the noyse they made aboue,

yea the speaking of Men, the striking of the clocke, and the sound of Bels. The seuenth day, when they thought to finde him dead, and that they prepared his graue, they that wrought, heard his voice in the botome of the well, which made them to hasten their worke, hearing him to crie for helpe. In the ende they descouer him, and hauing made him to take a glasse of wine, they drewe him out with a rope, the which hee held lustely▪ without bynding or the helpe of any person. Beeing out, and sound of Bodie and minde, after that hee had giuen thankes vnto GOD, hee opened his purse, in the presence of manie, and after hee had counted his monie, hee sayed merilie, that hee had beene with a verie good Hostes, seeing that in seauen daies hee had not spent anie thing.

            There be many that escaping out of dangers are compelled by the consideration of strange euents, to confesse that GOD hath deliuered them without the aide of any second cause. Of many examples I will choose and recite one which is worthy of note. The Dukes of Saxony FREDERICK the Elector and IOHN his brother went one day by bote along the riuer of Elba from Torque to Wittenberg. The water was all couered

               uer with great pieces of Ice newly broken. Those pieces so ran against the boate and bruised it in such sort, that assoone as the Princes were landed, it split in two and sanke. The Princes with great astonishment (considering such a spectacle from the shoare, and in what danger they had bin by reason of the greatnesse, depth, and fury of the riuer) acknowledged, that GOD had preserued the bote, vntill such time as they were landed. And hauing bin a long time in this consideration, without speaking a word, the

Elector say to his Brother. Let vs confesse that GOD hath preserued vs, and therfore let vs giue him thanks for his assistance in this &amp; many other dangers. But whereas you sawe the boate fall in peeces assoone as we were out of it, verily I am affraied that our house of Saxony will go to ruine after the death of vs two.

                  rode in Almaigne, confirmed by the testemony of diuers credible persons. About 9. of the clocke at night, a personage attyred in white, and followed by a white dogge, came and knocked at an honest poore womans dore, and called her by her name. She thinking it had bin her husband, who had beene a long time in a farre Country, ran presently to the dore. This personage taking her by the hand, asked her in whom she put all the hope of her saluation? In Iesus CHRIST, answered she. Then he commanded her to followe him: which she refusing to do, he exhorted her to be of good courage, &amp; to feare nothing; that done, he led her all night through a forrest. The next day about noone hee set her vpon an exceeding high mountaine, and shewed her things which she was neuer able to expresse. Hee enioyned her to returne home, and to exhort euery one to turne from their wicked waies: adding that an horrible destruction was at hand: and hee commanded her also to rest her selfe eight daies in her house, at the end whereof he would come to her againe. The day following in the morning, the womā was found at the townes end, and carried home to her house, where she continued eight whole daies without eating or drinking. When her neighbors and friends perswaded her to take some sustenance, her answere was that being extreame

weary, nothing was so agreable to her as rest: &amp; how within eight daies the man that had carried her forth would come againe, and then she would eate. As indeede it came to passe▪ but afterward, this woman stirred but little out of her bed, sighing from the bottome of her heart, and crying out very often: O how great are the ioyes of that life! and how miserable is this life! Beeing demmanded whether shee thought the personage attired in white, which appeared so vnto her, to bee a good Angell, or rather some euill spirit that had transformed himselfe into an Angell of light? She answered, It is not an euill spirit: it is an holy Angell, who hath commanded mee to pray incessantlie to GOD, and to exhort both great and small vnto amendment of life. If any one questioned with her concerning her beliefe: I confesse (sayd shee) that I am a poore sinner▪ but I beleeue that Iesus CHRIST hath obtayned me remission for all my sinnes through the benefit of his death and passion: The Minister of the place testified the singular piety and humble deuotion of this woman, adding that she was wel instructed, and could yeeld very good reason for her religion.

And seeing his bote readie to bee ouerwhelmed, and himselfe and the rest drowned, without any apparance of rescue, full of faith and hope in GOD, he sayd to his friend: What triumph would Satan make thinke

            The yeare 1535. in a village of Silesia, named Olst, hapened the strangest and most furious tempest in the ayre that euer was seene: for it made euen the strongest houses that were built of hewed stone to shake, and ouerthrewe diuers. One of the inhabitants of the Village, named LAVVRENCE THOPHAROSKE, hauing his house ioyning to the market place, and being verily perswaded that the end of the world was come, by reason the Element was all of a flame, and that great flakes of of fire flew about, shutte himselfe vp in his house, and falling on his knees with his wife and children, began to pray very earnestly vnto GOD, and to sing Hymnes and Psalmes of repentance. During these holy exercises, a great clap of Tempest, with a wonderfull violence, tore away the vpper part of the house, that was all of hewed Stone, together with the roofe, and flung it all to the ground, without hurting either the Father, the Mother or the Children. But in another place this tempest did great harme: for hauing ouer-throwne a Pinnacle of the Towne-house, made all of great foure squared stone cimented and fastned together with Clampornes and barres of Yron, fiue persons were slaine with the fall of the houses, wherevpon this ruine lighted. Whereas contrariwise three others, and a Child lying in a little bed, were preserued in another house vnder the same ruine:

and it being demanded of the Child, that began to prattle, who had holpen him in that danger, hee lifted vp his little hand, and pointed to Heauen. M. AMBROSA MOI

            No-lesse horrible and dreadfull was another tempest that ranne ouer all the Country of Misnia vpon the 13. day of August 1559. Which thundring very strangely in the aire, and ouerthrowing all that it encountred: a certaine woman got her selfe with all speede into her Stoue with foure Sonnes shee had and her maide. And then turning her selfe vnto them shee sayd, wee haue often heard tell of the last day, but wee neuer regarded it till now we see it come: which sayd, they all fell downe on their knees, calling vnto GOD for mercie. Therevpon a furious gust of winde tore away the roofe of the house, and tearing downe the walles, brake the posts, seelings and bords of the Stoue all to fitters. But in the middest of this feareful tempest, the Mother, Children &amp; Maide remained safe and vnhurt, although the timber &amp; stones flew as thick as hayle about their eares. Satan seeming to bee in the middest of this storme, and confounded by the feruent praier of the little flock, darted a great beame of twelue foote long, as though it had beene an arrowe flying in the aire, with the ayde of a violent whirle-winde, iust through the windowe of the Stoue at this poore company kneeling against a bench. But the holie Angells turned it another way, so that it lighted with terrible fury in a corner right against the fornace of the Stoue.

There were many preserued as it were by miracle: two Children with their mother were sound vntouched of the water vnder the ruines of a house in a heape of strawe also two others in a Cellar: a nurse with her Childe leaning against a Ladder, a blinde man in his entry, and diuers others both great and small in high places which with-stood the fury of the water.

            I knewe an honorable woman of singular pietie and modestie, that some twenty yeares since, through an extraordinary and long suppression of her tearmes was a great while and at times very sorely troubled in minde▪ so that she was often determined to haue killed her husband sleeping, and her selfe after. One day her keeper being gone forth about some businesse, shee rose out of her bed, and in her smock ranne into a garden behinde her house, where by a rope of the well, which was seauen or eight fathom, she let herselfe downe to the bottom,

and then by the same rope got vp againe, and returned all wet to her Chamber, hauing beene vp to the Chin in water. Not long after, seeming to be some-what better, she walked abroad, and carryed along with her a Son of hers, that is now of very great hope, but was then some 4. or 5. yeares old, with full entent to drowne him and her selfe in a riuer that was thereby: vnto the bridge whereof she made many iournies, being still entertained with the Childes comfortable prattle. Returning home againe, within a while after shee was easily recouered, namely, by letting of bloud in the Saphena, and taking of a gentle purgation. After which she had 4. or 5. sweete Children. She hath many times told me that in those accidents a man attired in white, and of a very pleasing coū
               tenance appeared vnto her, who tooke her by the hand, and kindly exhorted her to trust in GOD. Being in the Wel (&amp; som-what that was very heauy lying on her head and laboring to make her let go the rope, for to plunge her ouer head and eares in the water &amp; so drowne her,) this same personage came vnto her, tooke her by the arme, &amp; holpe her to get vp againe, which she could neuer haue done of her selfe. He also comforted her in the garden, and led her very gently to her Chamber, where hee vanished away. In like manner hee met her as shee was going towardes the bridge: and followed her a loofe of vntill such time as she returned home. Beeing thorough well, shee desired nothing so much as leaue this world, and her praiers da
                  •…
               ely tended to that effect. At length GOD heard her, and about a moneth before her sicknesse whereof shee dyed, going into the kitchen for to wash her handes and her face, one of her eye teeth on the right side fell out

of her head, without any precedent or ensuing paine. Wherevpon she went vnto her husband being in bed, &amp; shewing him the tooth sayd vnto him, husband the Lord calls me: and it is the accomplishment of my desires. O what an happy creature am I! Her husband some what mooued there with, endeuored notwithstanding to comfort her, and falling of purpose into other talke, arose, &amp; went and prayed. After that, this honorable dame shewed her selfe alwaies merier to her husband and friends then before, being graue and seuere to her children, and was fairer and lustier then euer she had bin in seauentene yeares that she had liued a wife. Towards the end of the moneth, there being no apparance of any such matter, as she was going to rise betimes in the morning, according to her custome, for to looke to a young child she had, and to tend the affaires of her house, shee was constrained to keepe her bed. Wherevpon her husband comming in, she put him in minde of her tooth and the speeches shee had vsed to him about it, and therefore exhorted him to submit himselfe vnto the will of GOD. He being gon vp for to commend his deare moitie vnto him that neuer reiecteth the praiers of his seruants, she tooke al her iewells and putting them vp in her purse sent them by her eldest Daughter to him, and desired him to keepe them for her sake. Hee came downe, and gently rebuked her for this apprehension. Oh husband, sayd shee, I haue no neede of any thing in this world, for I am going to my GOD. O how blessed am I! during her sicknesse, which lasted twenty daies, I was for the most part present with her, beeing tied there vnto for diuers reasons. Shee put mee in remembrance againe of that I haue declared before, and from so many excellent deliuerances drewe an

assured argument of her saluation. The day of her decease approching, she began to smile, and being demanded the cause thereof by mee; shee answered softly in mine eare, I see my man. O how beautifull he is! then crying out shee said; Stay for mee, stay for me. All the while she was sick, she made no account neither of children, kinsfolkes, friends, nor of any other thing in the world. And when her husband many times brought their children vnto her, she sayd nothing, but, God blesse you, God be your Father and Mother▪
                and to the yongest of them; Hah, little Souldiar! She neuer commended them but once vnto her husband. And after that, shee beheld them with a regardlesse eye. A quarter of an houre before her departure, she called for her Petti-coate to rise, and as she was about to go out of her bed, she desired to be made vnready, and being laid downe againe, she sent for her husband and vsed these words vnto him. Behold the end of my desire, and the beginning of my felicitie. IESVS CHRIST is my hope: Good husband, I desire but one thing of you. Pray vnto GOD for me. Her husband and children being prostrated on their knees, after an earnest praier vnto GOD, she closed her eyes as if she had been going to sleepe, &amp; died with a sweeter countenance then euer she had had in al her life before.

One day swelling mightily about the throate, and looking very pale, so that they were affraid he would haue falne downe: IVDITH his Mistresse a very honest Gentlewoman, gathering her folkes together, began to call vpon GOD: where-vpon there suddainly issued out of this WILLIAMS mouth, amongst other trash, all the fore-part of a Shepheards breeches, Flint-stones, some whole &amp; some broken, little bottoms of thred, a false head of haire, needles, a peece of a boyes silke doublet, and a Peacocks feather. Being demanded concerning the cause of his sicknesse, hee answered that he met with a woman hard by Camphuse, which blowed in his face from whence he thought it proceeded. But afterward when he was well, he confessed that this accusation was not true, and that he was induced by the diuill to say so. Furthermore, he added, that all those prodigious things came not out of his body, but were throwne against his mouth by the Diuell whilst they saw him vomit. One day being more carefully looked vnto, by reasō they were afraid he would haue done himselfe some mischiefe, his eyes remained so fast closed together, that it was impossible to open thē. At length GERTRVDE, CLATHS eldest daughter, of some 12. yeares of age, comming vnto him, exhorted him to pray to GOD, that it would please him to restore his sight againe: wherevpon WILLIAM

desired her to pray, which she did, and her eies were immediatly opened, to the great amazement of all that were present. The Diuil often perswaded him not to giue eare eyther to his Mistresse or any other that troubled his head, with talking to him of GOD, who could not helpe him, seeing hee was once dead, as hee had heard it publickly preached. Another time striuing to put his hand vnder the Kitchin-maides clothes, and shee rating him for it by his name, hee answered in a big voice; My name is not WILLIAM but BEELZEEVB: wherevnto his Mistresse replied; Thinkest thou therefore that wee feare thee? He in whom wee trust, is of farre more infinite power and strength then thou art. Then CLATH incited with a holy zeale in the presence of all his house, commanded Sathan, in the name of IESVS CHRIST, to come forth of him, reading the 11. Chapter of the Gospell of St. Luke, where mention is made of a dumbe Diuill cast out by the power of our Sauiour, as also of BEELZEBVB Prince of Diuils. In the end WILLIAM began to take some rest, and slept till morning, like a man in a traunce: then taking a little broth, and feeling himselfe through well, hee was carried home to his friends, hauing first thanked his master and mistresse, and desired GOD to recompence them for the paines they had taken with him during his affliction. After that he maried, and had children, and was neuer tormented more of the Diuill. I. WIER, in the booke &amp;c. before mentioned.
            
            Vpon the 18. day of March 1566. a very memorable matter happened in the towne of Amsterdam in Holland, whereof Maister ADRIAN NICHOLAS Chancellor of Gueldres, makes a publicke discourse, containing this which ensueth. Some two moneths agoe, or thereabout

(saith he) thirty children in this Towne began to bee tormented after a strange manner, as though they had beene lunatick or madde. By fitts they threw themselues against the ground, and this torment lasted halfe an houre or an houre at the most. When they rose againe, they neuer remembred any paine they had felt, nor any other thing they had done in their fitte, but thought they had slept. The Phisitions to whom they had recourse, did them no good, because they were of opinion that their disease proceeded not from naturall causes. Wherevpon their Parents imagining they were bewitched, resorted vnto Witches: but they preuailed as little with all their sorcery. Finally they repaired vnto Exorcists, by reason they were perswaded their children were possessed, because vpon the suddaine they said many things which surpast their capacitie and age. These Exorcists emploied all their cunning, and lost their labour. During their exorcismes, the children vomited a great sort of Needles, Pinnes, Thimbles, lumpes of Cloath, pieces of broken Pottes, Glasse, Haire, and other such things: for all which not-with-standing, they were neuer the better, but at times fell into the same extremitie againe, to the great astonishment of all men for the rarenesse of so strange a spectacle. I. WIER in his 4. Booke, chap. 8.
            The like happened at Rome, the yeare 1553. for in the Hospitall of the Orphans, about seuenty Girles were possessed in one night, and continued in that estate aboue two yeares. CARDAN, in the 4. Booke de variatate, Chap. 176.
            IOHN LANGIVS a very learned Physition writeth in the first Booke of his Epistles, that in the yeare 1539.

this which followeth happened at Fungestall, a Village in the Bishoprick of Eysteten, verified by a number of good witnesses. VLRIC NEVSESSAR a labouring man dwelling in that Village, was miserably tormented with a paine in his hips. One day the Chirurgion hauing made an incision in the skinne, drew out a great Yron Nayle: the paine abated not for all that, but contrarily so encreased, that the poore man became desperate, and with a sharpe knife cut his owne throate. As hee was carrying forth to be buried, two Chirurgions in the presence of a great many people, opened his stomack, and there found some round pieces of wood, foure Steele Kniues, some very keene, and some dented like a Sawe, also two Yron barres of 9. inches long a peece: and a great lumpe of hayre. I wonder how that Yron could be contained within the capacity of his stomach: but no question, it was a deuise of the Diuill, who cunningly supposed all those things for to make himselfe be feared. I. WIER in his 4. Booke, Chap. 9.
            The torments where with the Diuill afflicted certaine Nunnes at Wertet in the County of Horne, are meruailous and horrible. Which came first (as it is reported) by the meanes of a poore woman, who in the Lent time borrowed a Quarte of Salte of the Nunnes, weyghing three pounds or there-about, and payde them twise asmuch againe, a little before Easter. After that they found little white Pellets in their Dortor, like to round Sugar Plummes, and Salte in taste, whereof not-with-standing none of them did eate, nor knew not from whence they came. Shortlye there-vpon they heard a thing, which seemed to grone like a sicke man: they likewise vnderstood a voyce, willing

certaine of the Nunnes to come to one of their Sisters that was sick: but there was no such matter when they came. If at any time they chaunced to make water in their Chamber-pot, it was suddainely snatched away, so that they all berayed their beddes. They were often drawne about the house by the heeles, and so tickled in the soles of their feete, that they swouned with laughing. Some had pieces of their flesh plucked away, and others had their legges, armes and face turned back-ward. Diuers of them beeing thus tormented, vomited a great quantity of black licor, like vnto incke, although they had eaten nothing in seauen weekes before, but a little i
                  •…
               yce of rapes, without bread, some were hoisted vp in the aire to the highth of a man, and presently throwne downe against the ground. As certaine of their friends came to the Couent for to make merry with them who seemed to be almost well, on a suddaine some of them fell backward as they sate at table, quite depriued of speach and sence: the rest lay all along as though they had bin dead, with their armes and legges bowed back-ward. One amongst them was hoisted vp in the aire, and albeit those that were present stroue with all their might to hinder it, yet was shee snatched vp spight of their teethes, and then so throwne against the ground, that shee seemed to be dead: but rysing vp againe within a while after as if it had beene out of a sound sleepe, she went out of the refectory hauing no hurt. Some went vpon their knees, as if they had no feete. Others climbed vp to the toppes of trees, and came downe againe as lightly, as if they had beene Catts. This torment of the Nunnes continued three yeares openly knowne: but afterward it was kept close. I. WIER. lib. 4. Chap. 10.
            
               With this same agrees that which happened to Saint Brigitts Nunnes, in their Couent hard by Xante. Sometimes they skipped and bleated like sheepe, or rored in most horrible manner. Sometimes they were thrust out of their pues in the Church, or had their vailes pulled of their heads: and many times their throtes was so stopped, that they were not able to swallowe any meate. This strange calamitie endured the space of ten yeares in some of them. And it is reported that a young Nunne surprised with the loue of a young man was cause thereof: for her parents hauing denyed her him in mariage, the Diuell taking the forme of that young man vpon him appeered vnto her in her greatest flames, and counselled her to become a Nunne, as incontinently shee did. Beeing shut vp in the Couent shee grewe as it were furious, and shewed euery one strange and horrible sights. This inconuenient like a plague infected diuers other Nunnes. The first beeing sequestred, abandoned herselfe to him that kept her, and had two Children by him. Thus Satan within and without the Couent wrought his detestable effects. In the same booke and Chapter.
            
            I haue heard that the Diuell for certaine yeares togither tormented the Nunnes of Hessymont at Nieumeghen. One day he entred with a whirle winde into their Dortor, where he began to play so melodiously on the Lute and Harpe, that the Nunnes feete tickled to dance. Then he tooke the forme of a dog, and leaped into one of their bedds, it was suspected of incontinency. Other strange things happened there, as also in another Couent hard by Colen about the yeare 1560. Where the Diuill walked in the likenesse of a dog, and hyding himselfe vnder

the Nunnes Cloathes, played most filthy and shamefull trickes. The like he did at Hensberg in the Duchy of Cleues, vnder the figure of Catts. In the same booke and Chap.
            
            ANTHONY SVCQVET, Kinght of the order of the golden fleece, a personage of great reputation ouer all Flanders, and Counsellor in the priuy Counsell of Brabant beside three legitimate Children had a bastard, that tooke a wife at Bruges: Who a little after her marriage began to be pittifully tormented of the euill spirit, insomuch that where-souer shee was, euen in the middest of Ladies and gentlewomen, she was suddainly carried away &amp; drawne vp and downe the roome, &amp; many times, cast now into one corner, now into another, albeit those that were with her labored to hold her and keepe her from it. But in these agitations she tooke but little harme in her body. Euery one thought that this inconuenient was procured vnto her by a wench whom her husband, (that was a proper gallant yong man) had somtimes kept. Amidst these accidents she became with Child, but ceased not for all that to bee tormented of the spirit. The time of her deliuery come, there chanced to be but one woman in her company, who was presently sent to the mid-wife and other women for to come to her labor. In the meane time it seemed vnto her that the wench (of whom I spake) came into the Chamber, and serued her in stead of a mid-wife: where with the poore gentle woman was so exceedingly frighted, that she fell into a swound. Being come to herselfe againe she felt that she was discharged of her b
                  •…
               rthen: &amp; yet no Child appeared, wherat euery body was greatly amazed. The next day when she awaked shee found a Child made vp and layd by her in the bed: to the which shee gaue suck at two seuerall

times. Falling a sleepe againe within a little while after, the Child was taken from her side, &amp; neuer seene more. The report went that certaine scrolles and▪ magical Characters were found about the lock of the Chamber dore. This history was recounted vnto mee, by my brother in Lawe a learned and vertuous gentleman who had receiued it from the gentlewomans husband and brother, &amp; from diuers others that had visited her in her Child bed. I. WIER in his 3. booke Chap. 34.
            Here we might report the monstrous and innumerable convulsions which happened to the Nunnes of Kentorp in the Country of March not farre from Hammone. A little before their fit and during the same, they cast forth a stynking breath out of their mouthes, which at times continued certaine houres. In the middest of their paine some of thē were of good memory, &amp; both heard and knew those that were about them, although by reasō of the convulsion of their toungs &amp; partes, seruing to respiration, they could not speake in their sit. Now some were tormented more then others, and some lesse. But this was common to them all, that assoone as one was tormented, at the onely noise of that one the rest, seperated in diuers Chambers, were also tormented. One of the ancientest of the Couēt, &amp; of the first that was afflicted, named ANNE LENGON, discoursed the whole history vnto me. When first of all she felt a paine in her left side, &amp; that it was thought she was taken with the falling sicknesse, she was sent to the Monastery of Monherric: wherevnto she consented through a certaine deuotion, and after she had drunke there in Saint Cornelius head, the report went, that she was much better then she had beene: which was found cleane otherwise. For both she &amp; the

rest, being in worse estate then before, sent to a cunningman, who certified them that they were all poysoned by their Cooke, named ELSE CAMENSE. The Diuill taking hold on this occasion, began to torment them more then before, and which was worse, induced them to bite and beate one another, and to throw one another to the ground, which they did without any harme, and as easilie as if they had beene feathers, insomuch that they very well perceiued their will was not in their owne power. When they were kept from fighting and doing any other violence, then they tormented themselues in most grieuous maner, and assoone as they were let alone, they fell to biting of one another, and yet neuer felt any hurt. If ANNE spake in her fit, it seemed to be done by meanes of some other that drew her breath in and out. Shee vnderstood her selfe speake: but the speech ended, she remembred not a word of that shee had spoken, vnlesse it were repeated vnto her againe: for then she remembred that she had pronounced it. At any time when she set her selfe to pray, incontinently shee was molested by the euill spirit: fo that she could not, as willingly she would, either attentiuely prosecute her purpose, or moue her tongue. But if shee chanced, without thinking on it, to mutter a Pater noster, or an Aue Maria on her Beads, shee was so farre from being hindered, that then she felt ease. Otherwaies, shee was altogether dull, and destitute of sence, discretion and iudgement: so that she could neuer thinke a suisedly on any thing what-so euer. If any good deuo
                  •…
               te man that feared GOD, fortuned to conferre with her, then it seemed the Diuill would punish her for it. But contrary wise, if other women talked with her about trifling and ordinary matters, therein shee tooke

pleasure, and was eased by it. Nowe all these Nunnes thus tormented felt a paine, that got vp ward by little and little from the soles of their feete, which seemed to them to bee skalded with hot seething water. And though they were all thus strangely afflicted, yet lost they not their appetite, but still receiued sustenance. The Diuell spake very often and much by the mouthes of the yongest which had their spirits troubled; vnto whom he presented himselfe in the forme of a black Catte, and in the likenesse of Else Kamense, or of her Mother, or Brother: so as euery one thought, (but falsely) that those persones were the cause of such torments. ANNE being resolued to returne no more to the Couent, from whence her parents had taken her, but to serue GOD deuoutly, so as (with as more setled iudgement), this calamity left her: notwithstanding if she receiued but letters from the Ablesse, shee felt a shwering through-out all her Body, as if shee should presently haue fallen againe into her former inconuenience. Not long after she maried, and was neuer troubled with that calamity more. She told me also that ELSE KAMENSE was afflicted in the same manner as the rest were, namely with the falling sicknesse, &amp; that many times she talked idely too wherevpon the Nunnes were perswaded that shee had bewitched her selfe, to the end she might not be suspected of that she had done, insomuch that they all set vpon this maide, whom the cunning man had told them was a witch. The poore wench beeing carryed before the Iustice, at the first confessed that shee was cause of that heauy spectacle, wrought by meanes of the mixture of certaine poysons: being at the place of execution, and ready to die, she protested that shee had neuer vsed any poyson, but onely at times

pronounced certaine curses.
            After that Else and her mother were burned, some of the inhabitants of Hammone, a towne there by, began to bee tormented of the euill spirit. The minister of the place got foure or fiue of them into his house, for to instruct and fortifie them against the impostures of the enemy. But when hee had recited some articles of a Christans beliefe, they beganne to mocke the Minister, and to name certaine women of the Towne, to whome they sayd they would go, mounted vpon Bucks, which should carry them thither. Incontinently one of them got him a stride vpon a forme, crying out that hee was ryding away. Another stepping vp behinde him, fell back-ward quite ouer and ouer, and lighted against the Chamber dore, which flying open, hee tumbled from the toppe of the stayres downe to the bottome, and had no hurt. About the same time, in a village named Houel, hard by the same Towne, diuers men were cruelly tormented of the euil spirit. I. WIER in booke 4. Chap. 11.
            The Nunnes of the Couent of Nazareth at Cologne were tormented almost like those of Kantorp. Hauing beene a long time diuersly vexed by the Diuell, much more in the yeare 1564. For they were layd along vpon the ground as if it had beene to haue had the company of man: during which indignity their eies remained closed, which afterwards they opened very shame fastly, &amp; as if they had endured some grieuous paine. A young wench named GERTRVDE, of 14. yeares of age, gaue way to all this mischiefe. She had beene often abused with those wantō apparitions in her bed, wherof her laughter made proofe, although she had tried diuers meanes to remedy

it, but all in vaine. For as a fellowe of hers lay on a pallet by her, only for to keepe her from such apparitions, the poore wench grewe affraied hearing the noise that was made in Gertrudes bedde, of whome at length the Diuell tooke possession, and beganne to afflict her with sundry sorts of Convulsions. In her fit, she was like a blind body, vttering strange and inconstant speeches tending to dispaire. The like did diuers others: and so this plague preuailed by little &amp; little, &amp; augmented much more, when these poore afflicted soules began to haue recourse vnto vnlawfull remedies. Now whilest the Diuell tormented them thus, some of them were taken with the plague, and as long as they had it, the euil spirit neuer troubles them, through a singular goodnesse of GOD, who lymiteth vnto Satan certaine boūds, which he cannot passe (witnesse IOB) in afflicting those whō GOD hath deliuered vp vnto him for a time in this world. The beginning of all this calamity proceeded from certaine lewd youthes, who hauing gotten acquaintance, by playing at stoole-ball thereby with one two of those Nunnes, climbed ouer the walles, &amp; enioyed their loues. But afterwards leauing of that course, by reason they were depriued of the meanes to continewe it, the Diuell corrupted the phantasie of those miserable creatures, and entreated them as hath beene declared. I. WIER booke 1. Chap. 12.
            To these may be added another Nunne of the Couent of Bosledue, hard by Saint Iohns Church, named IVDITH, whom I haue seene tormented of the Diuill with strange convulsions for hee so stopt her throate that shee could not swallowe any meate, and many times held her toung in such sorte, that hee kept her from speaking: likewise I haue heard her vtter ridiculous and horrible speaches.

With her I will ioyne another maide seruant to a Nunne of a great and noble house. A Country fellowe had promised her marriage▪ but hee fell in loue with another: whereat she was so grieued, that being gone some halfe a mile from the Couent, she met the Diuell in the likenes of a proper yong man, who began to talke very familiarly with her, discouering vnto her all the Country fellowes secrets, with the speech hee had vsed to his newe loue: and that to the end he might haue made the wench fall into dispaire, and so drawne her to haue made her self away. Being come to a little brooke, he tooke the bottle of oile, which she carried, that she might the better passe ouer the bridge: and enticed her to go with him to a place that hee named, which shee refused, saying what would you haue me do going along those marshes? Wherevpon he vanished away, which so affrighted the poore maide that she fell into a swound: her Mistres being aduertised of it, sent a litter to fetch her to the Couent. Where she lay a long time sick, and as it were depriued of sense being troubled in spirit after a strange manner, and diuers times complayned that she was miserably tormented of the Diuell, who would haue her &amp; carry her away through the windowe. Afterward she was married to that Country-fellowe, and recouered her former health: The same.
            
            At Leuensteet, a village belonging to the Duke of Brunswick, there was a maide named MARGARET ACHILS about twenty yeares old, dwelling with her Sisters. Vpon the second day of Iune, going to make cleane a paire of showes, she tooke one of her kniues, that was some halfe a foote long: and as shee was beginning to scrape them being set in a corner of the Chamber, and very weake

with an ague, that had held her a long time, suddenly an old woman came in, who asked her whether she had her ague still, and how she felt her-selfe in her sicknesse; and so without any farther talke departed. After the shooes were made cleane, this maide let the Knife fall into her lap, which she could not finde againe, although she had sought very diligently for it: whereat she was some-what afraide, but farre more, when she perceiued a black Dog lying vnder the Table, whom she droue away, hoping to finde her Knife. The Dog being 
                  〈◊〉
                began to shew his teeth, and grinning at her, got into the street and ran away. Presently wherevpon this maide thought she felt I know not what, running downe on the one side of her back, as it were some cold humor, and immediatly shee swounded, continuing so till the third day after, when she began to find a little ease, &amp; to receiue some sustenance. Now being demanded cōcerning the cause of her griefe, she answered, that she was well assured the Knife which fell into her lappe was entred into her left side, in which place she felt a paine. And although her friends contradicted her, because they attributed this indisposition to a melancholy humor, and that she talked idlely by reason of her sicknesse, long abstinence, and other accidents: yet ceased shee not to persist in her continuall plaints and teares, so that her head became very light, &amp; some-times shee remained two dayes togither without taking any thing, although they vsed both faire meanes &amp; foule to draw her therevnto. Her fits were worse at some-times then at other some, insomuch that shee tooke but little rest, because of the continuall paines that tormented her: whereby shee was constrained to go euen double on a staffe. And that which more augmented her griefe and

diminished her ease, was that shee verily beleeued the knife was in her body, and yet euery one obstinatly contradicted her in it, and propounded the impossibilitie therof, imagining that her braine was distempred, considering nothing was seene that might induce thē to such an opinion, saue her incessant teares and complaints, wherin she continued the space of certaine moneths, &amp; to such time as there appeared on her left side a tumor of the bignes of an Egge, like to an halfe Moone, which encreased or decreased according as the swelling waxed more or lesse. Then the poore wench began to say: You would not beleeue the knife was in my body till now: but ere long you shall see how it is fixed in my side. And indeed on the thirtith day of Iune, namely about thirteene moneths after, she had first suffered this affliction, there issued such an abundance of matter out of the vlcer which was growne on that side, that the swelling began to asswage, &amp; then the point of the knife appered, which the maid would haue pulled out, had she not bin staid by her friends, who sent for Duke HENRIES Chirurgian, being at that time resident in the Castle of Wolffbutel. The Chirurgian comming thither on the 4. day of Iuly, desired the Minister, to comfort, instruct, and incourage the maide, as also to obserue her answers, because euery one thought she was possessed. She consented to be ruled by the Chirurgiā, although she was perswaded that present death would ensue. The Chirurgian perceiuing the point of the knife which appeared in her left side, with his instruments drew it forth: and it was found in all respects like to the other that was in her sheath, and very much vsed about the middest of the blade. Afterwards the vlcer was healed by the Chirurgian. In the same booke, ch. 14.
            
               CARDAN writeth that a certaine labourer a friend of his and an honest man, declared vnto him, how for many yeares together he was sick of an vnknowne disease: during the which, by meanes of certaine charmes, he had often-times vomited glasse, nailes, &amp; haite: and although he was afterwards recouered by that meanes, yet he felt a great quantity of broken glasse in his belly, which made a noyse like a great many pieces of broken glasse tyed vp together in a bag. Moreouer he added how that noise very much troubled him, and that euery eighteenth night, about seauen of the clock, for eighteene yeares space, after he was well, he felt as many blowes on his heart, as the Clock strooke houres: which hee endured not without great torment. In the same booke, Chap. 7.
            But yet farther to shew the sleights and subtilties of Sathan, who with efficacie of error turmoiles such as the diuine iustice deliuers vp vnto him, I will adde another history touching a child Demoniack, written by D. HENRY COLEN of Bosledue, to AVGVSTINE HVN
                  •…
               VS a Doctor of Lovaine the 3. day of March 1574. as followeth. A child of our towne foretels, that the wicked &amp; tyrranicall complot of the rebels of the Low-countries shal now take an end. We feare notwithstanding least it be some deuise of the euill spirit: albeit no man can discouer any such matter yet. This child cries out &amp; bids euery one pray heartily and incessantly vnto GOD: he himselfe with hands heaued vp, prayes 3. times a day. Hee hath foretold merueilous things of our time, &amp; all that he hath foretold is come to passe, not failing in any circumstance. Also hee saith, that the Angell GABRYEL hath reuealed vnto him, how all these Tragedies of Flanders shall end, before next Summer be halfe past: and how the King of Spaine
               
shall come into the low-countries, &amp; appease all by most happy meanes. He hath likewise foretold the very moment of time of the taking of Middelborough, and infinite other things come to passe according to his predictions. I (most vnworthy) was also called to examine this child, and was wonderfully amazed to see so simple a thing, which can neither write nor read, answer so readily to all demands, and resolue the greatest difficulties could bee propounded. And because Sathan transfigures himselfe into an Angell of light, I obiected many and sundry questions vnto him: but so farre is it from an Angell that abhors the crosse of our Lord, or the name of IESVS: that contrariwise it hath taught the child a praier, in substance containing these words: O IESVS of Nazareth, which was crucified for vs, haue mercy vpon vs: helpe vs poore sinners that we may returne againe vnto the faith. I. WIER, in 1. Booke, chap. 10. where he addeth this censure. The contrary euent hath manifested, that this child was possessed of the diuill, who spake and prognosticated by his mouth. For the troubles of Flanders ended not the Summer following, nor three yeares (we may say, nor fiue and twentie yeares) after, neither was, nor is there any newes of the K
                  •…
               ng of Spaines comming into the Lowe-Countries. Now the spirit of GOD cannot faile nor erre in the least point that is. Therefore one may perceiue who that GABRIEL was, that could declare the very moment of time, of the taking of Middelborough in Zealand: to wit, the Diuill, who being a spirit, transports himselfe in an instant from one place to another, by reason of his incomprehensible swiftnesse. Hee it was that moued this childe to the prayers before mentioned, the better to colour his impostures and lyes. For so hee hath

accustomed to mingle truth with falsehood. As Doctor COLEN may acknowledge, if he be still aliue, in the beginning of this new age 1600. If hee be departed this world, I leaue the decision thereof to his companions.
            The yeare 1594. in the Marquisate of Brandebourg, there were seene aboue eight score persons together Demoniacks, which vttered meruailous things, and both knew and named such as they had neuer seene▪ amongst those persons they noted some which were dead long before, that walked crying out vnto euery one to repent, to leaue off all dissolutenesse in apparell, &amp;c. and denounced GODS iudgments, affirming that they were commanded by the Lord to preach amendment of life, whereby sinners might bee brought againe to the right way. These Demoniacks raged exceedingly where-soeuer they came, and belched forth infinite out-rages against the Ministers of the Church, talking of nothing but of apparitions of good and euill Angels. The Diuill shewed himselfe in diuers shapes, and in the Sermon time flew ouer the Church with a terrible noyse and crie: strawing points and peeces of gold and siluer all along as hee went.

These two marryed folkes, liuing very honestly and without reproach in their meane condition, had betweene them a Sonne, borne the 22. day of December 1585. foure dayes after he was Christened and named CHRISTOPHER, carefully brought vp, and in the yeare 1593. sent to the Schoole of the Village amongst other Children. A little before Easter, a certaine Girle discouers that this Chlde hath the last great Tooth of the left side appearing all of cleane Golde: diuers others therevpon finde it to be so. Suddenly the report of it is dispersed all about, so that the Dukes of Silesia, Lignits, Brige, Munsterberg, &amp;c. and diuerse Gentlemen and Cittizens of credit, cause the Childe to bee brought vnto them, that they might see him. Amongst others, Monsieur ANDRE, Bishop of Nisse, and chiefe Gouernour of Silesia, made him to be expresly brought vnto him to Nisse, where in his presence certaine Chirurgians very diligently and attentiuely considered the force, matter, forme, &amp; disposition

of this tooth.

gold approched to the carat of that of Hungarie.

            Desperate Persons.
            
               A Desperate man in our time dying (among manie other horrible speeches) sayd that hee wished to bee alreadie in hell. And beeing demanded the cause of so wicked a desire: for that (sayd hee) the apprehension of torments which doe attend me, cause me presently to feele a double hell: when I shall feele it at the full, I shall not expect any more.
            I haue heard an other desperate man, who beeing exhorted to turne from the two vehement apprehention of GODS Iustice, vnto his mercie, which was open vnto him, hee answered very coldly, you saie true, GOD is GOD; but of his Children, not for me: his mercie is certaine: for his elect, but I am a reprobate, a vessell of wrath and cursing, and I doe alreadie feele the to

him that hee had knowne GOD, heard his worde, and receiued his Sacraments. I but (hee added) that I was an hipocryte, and guilty of many blasphemies against GOD.

            A learned man at Louvain called M. GERLACH, hauing profited so well in his studies, as hee was one of the first among the Learned of our time, beeing toucht with a greeuous sickenesse, hee sighed continualy, and feeling himselfe to drawe neere his ende, hee beganne to descouer the grounde of his sighes, speaking such fearefull wordes as desperate men are accustomed to proferre: crying out and lamenting that hee had liued verie wickedly, and that hee could not endure the Iudgement of GOD: for that hee knewe his sinnes were so great, as he should neuer obtaine pardon: so as in this distresse hee died, opprest with greeuious and horrible despaire.

            M. ARNOVL BOMEL, a learned man of the same place, receyuing an impression in his braine from a Sophister, of strange opynions touching our Saluation, hee beganne to growe wilde.

Hee seemed vnto them to haue some remorse, as well by his outward countenance as by some wordes which hee deliuered with a languishing voice. But in the meane time, seeing a knife hang at one of the Schollers girdels, hee seized thereon sodenly and strikes himselfe to the heart, whereof hee died presently.

            In the end of the yeare 1545. in a smal towne of the territory of Padoua, called Ciuitelle there was a learned Lawier and Aduocate, a wise and verie Rich man, and an honourable Father of a famelie, called FRANCIS

SPIERA, who hauing said and done diuers things against his conscience, to maintaine himselfe and his charge, being returned to his house, he could neuer rest an houre, no not a minute, nor feele any ease of his continuall anguish. And euen from that night he was so terrified and had such horror of his actions, as hee held himselfe for lost. For (as he himselfe did afterwards confesse) he did see plainly before his eies, all the torments, all the paines of hell, and of the damned, and in his soule did heare the fearefull sentences being drawne before the iudgement seate of IESVS CHRIST. The next day and so following, it was impossible to see him resume any courage: but his spirits were strangely troubled, and the terror tooke from him all rest and appetite. This Accident was so grieuous to his friends and familiars, as some repented them much, that they had beene the cause of so great an inconuenient by their prayers and intreaties. Others, thinking it did proceed from some cholerick or melancholy humor (the effects whereof are often-times strange in those braines which are violently toucht) were of opinion to send him to Padoua, to be Physicked by the learned Physitions, reuiued by honourable companie, and setled by the conference of learned men that were there, to some of the which he was well knowne. His wife and children, with some of his familiar friends did accompany him, and hee was lodged in one of the chiefe houses. FRISIMILEGA, BELLOCAT and CRASSVS (famous and excellent Physitions) did visit him, and giue him Physicke with a singular affection: and found soone that he was little sicke in body, but grieuously in minde: for in all other things he discoursed grauely and constantly, so as none of his familiar friends could

decerne that the quickenesse of his discourse and reason was any thing impaired or weakened, continnuing still in this continuall anguish, manie were much troubled, and daylie his Chamber was full of people; some curious to see and to heare; others (but very fewe) were desirous to drawe him to hope in the mercies of GOD. I was present at many of his speeches, with some men of honour and learning. To deliuer that which I could obserue. I beganne first to note his age and his fashion. He was about fifty yeares old, free from the violent passions of youth, and from the coldnesse of old age. Nothing came out of his mouth that was lighly or foolishly spoken, or that might discouer any doting in him; although hee did day lie discours of graue and important matters with the learned, and that some did propound vnto him high questions, especially in di
                  •…
               inity. I will briefely relate some speeches they had with him, during his aboad at Padoua, and I will not forget that hee declared with a setled Iudgement, that hee did see the eternall vengeance of GOD prepared against the sinne which hee had committed. For that he did finde in him selfe, that those things which GOD had giuen to others, to reioyce their spirits and to liue well and happely, had all conspired against him in despight of his horrible forfet. For although (said hee) that GOD for a great blessing had promised to many holie men, a goodly issue and a great number of Children, in whose loue and obedience they may repose their age, and that there was nothing more pleasing in this present life, yet in the middest of his miseries, the hands and faces of his Children were as horrible vnto him as the hang-mans. It cannot well be exprest, what greefe and vexation hee seemed to

receiue, when his Children brought him meate, forcing him to eate, and threatning him when hee refused it. Hee confessed his Children did their duties, &amp; yet he tooke al in ill part (saying) that he did not acknowledge GOD any more for his Father, but did feare him as an aduersary, armed with iudgement. For he had bin three weekes in this apprehension, when hee spake these things, without eating or drinking, but what they forced him vnto, the which he receiued with great difficulty, the which hee resisted withall his power, spitting out that which they forced him to take. Some of the Assistants were of opinion to make him a fraied, to make him the more apt, to receiue foode, first for the Soule, then for the bodie: asking him if hee did not feare greater and sharper torments after this life, then those heethen felt? Hee confessed that hee did expect farre more sharpe, and had alreadie horror of them: yet hee desired nothing more then to bee cast head-long into them, that hee might not feare other more greeuious torments. They asked him againe, if hee thought his sinne to bee so fowle, as it could not bee pardoned through the bountie and infinite mercie of GOD? His answere was, that hee sayd sinned against the Holie Ghost, which was so great a sinne, as it is called a sinne vnto death, that is to say, subiect to the eternall vengeance of GOD, and to the paines of hell. Whereof this poore wretch discoursed amplie, learnedly and to subtilie against himselfe. Learned and Godly men, which did assist him, omitted no testymonies that might assure a wounded conscience, that GOD is mercifull, gentle and readie to pardon. But all this could not diuert him from his opinion, neither could they drawe any other thing from him, but that hee desired

much that hee might returne to some hope of pardon. But it fares with mee (sayth hee) as with Cryminall persons, shut vp in close prisons and fettered hand and foote. Sometimes they are saluted by their friends passing by, who aduise them to breake prison and to deceiue their gards if they can. Such prisoners would gladly followe their counsell, but it is a vaine desire. Euen so is mine saied hee. As for the scriptures which were cited vnto him, touching the loue and affection of GOD the Father by reason of his Sonne IESVS CHRIST, hee did aduowe them, adding, that they did belong onelie to them whome IESVS CHRIST did repute his Bretheren and his members: but as for him hee had renounced that loue, and willingly reiected all Brotherly allyance: neither was hee ignorant in howe great tranquillity of minde they might bee, who had once imbraced the promises of saluation, and did rest themselues continually therein. For confirmation whereof this his sad desaster (sayd hee,) was propounded for an example before all mens eyes: that if they were wise they should not hold it light, nor happened by any chance: but to learne by his ruine, howe dangerous it is to fall anie thing from that which beelongs to the great glorie of the Sonne of GOD. Adding that it was a slipperie and a very dangerous passage, yea most fearefull to him that stood not carefully vpon his gard: Moreouer forasmuch as such euident examples of the vengeance of almightie GOD, did seldome appeere to the eyes of men, they deserued to bee the more carefullie regarded. That amongest a great multitude and number of reprobates in the worlde, his calamitie was not singular; but his onely punnishment and ruyne

did satisfie GOD, a iust Iudge to admonish all others to haue a care of themselues. He added with all, that therein hee did acknowledge the seuerity of GODS iudgement, who had chosen him to make him a spectacle rather then any other: and to admonish all by one mans mouth, to abstaine from all impietie: confessing moreouer that there was no reproch nor punnishment which hee had not deserued, by reason of his fowle offence. After that hee had discoursed sincerely and grauely of the diuine Iustice; hee sayd that they should not take it strange this his long speech touching the true reason of the will of GOD: for that oftentimes GOD doth wrest out of the mouth of reprobates most assured testymonies of his Maiestie, his Iustice, and his fearefull vengance: as wee see in IVDAS confessing his owne sinne and iustefying his Master. Vsing a long discours vpon this sentence, and desirous to shewe the greatnesse of GODS Iudgements: there are some (sayd hee,) who haue all things so wishfully, as they liue in all delights, without feare or apprehension of any harme, as hauing attained the higth of all felycitie: who notwithstanding are registred for perdition, whereof IESVS CHRIST propounds an example in the rich man, enioying all the pleasures of the world with a full gorge, beeing after his death tormented in hell: whereof mention is made in the sixteenth Chapter of the Gospell after Saint Luke. That GOD doth often propound vnto makinde a hope of reward to drawe him to the right beleefe of His holy will; and oftimes hee doth withdrawe them from their Impieties by prodigious and fearefull signes. And yet as Impietie is naturall to Men, they make not their profit of such instructions,

and thinke not that it concernes them: but contrarywise impute it to any other thing, rather then to the wisedome of GOD, to feare and reuerence him. Herevpon he made a bitter inuectiue against a certaine Philosopher, whom hee had knowne aboue twenty yeares before, for that this MOROSOPHE had beene so impudent, to deliuer in his lessons, yea to write it, and to publish it in Print, that all the miracles that IESVS CHRIST had done vpon the earth, might well be done by a man, that were skilfull in the knowledge of Naturall things. It were hard to represent the admiration where-with they were surprised, and with what compassion they were moued that came to visit him, for the discourses which they heard from his mouth. Euery man laboured earnestly to reduce this poore man to some hope of his saluation. Among others, there was one, a reuerend man for his holynesse of life, who departed not from the patients bed: It was the Bishop of Capo d' Istria, in the Venetians territories. Hee ceased not to exhorte SPIERA, and laboured by many testimonies of the holy Scriptures to diuert him from that apprehension: beseeching him by their friendship, by his loue to his Wife and Children, and for that his health should bee precious vnto him, that hee should haue a care of himselfe, and print in his heart a hope and trust of saluation by IESVS CHRIST. Adding that hee did not thinke that his spirit was altogether voide and destitute, of some good and heauenly inspiration, seeing hee spake so holylye and deuoutly of the excellencie of Christian religion.
            Although the sicke man knew well that these admonitions proceeded from a sincere and true heart: yet for

that hee had diuerse times reiected them, hee began to frowne, saying vnto the Bishop. You beleeue as I thinke, that I doe willingly nourish this obstinacie in my minde, and that I take delight in this vehement passion of despaire. If you bee of that opinion, you are deceiued. I will tell you (to the ende you may knowe my resolution) that if I could bee perswaded that the iudgement of GOD might by any meanes bee changed or mitigated for mee, it should not greeue me to bee tormented ten thousand yeares with the sharpest paines of Hell, so as I might haue any hope of rest after this long sufferance. But euen in that whereby you doe exhorte me to gather some hope: I see all meanes of health, and pardon taken from mee. For if the testimonies of holye Scripture haue any authoritie (as they haue) doe you thinke that IESVS CHRIST hath sayd in vaine. That he which hath renounced him before men, hee will renounce him before his heauenly Father? doe you not see that it concernes mee, and that it is as it were particularly verified in my person? what shall become of him whom the Sonne hath disauowed before his Father? when as you say that wee must hope for no saluation but in IESVS CHRIST. Therevpon hee did expound certaine passages of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and of the second Catholike Epistle of Saint Peter, out of the which hee drewe terrible conclusions against himselfe.
            Wee cannot beleeue with what grauitie and vehemencie his wordes were deliuered, neyther was there euer man heard pleading better for himselfe, then SPIERA did then against himselfe. Hee did alledge notable things of GODS Iustice, detesting his fore-passed

life: admonishing all that were about him very earnestlie: not to thinke that a Christians life was a light thing, and easily discharged. That it doth not consist onely in hauing the head Baptized, in reading certaine verses and Texts of the Gospell, and to bee termed an honest man: but it was needfull he should liue as the doctrine of trueth doth command him. Therevpon hee repeated a Text out of Saint Peter, exhorting vs to shewe through holynesse of life, certaine signes of the loue of GOD towards vs, and of the confidence wee should haue in him. Hee sayde moreouer, that hee had knowne many, who after they had tasted the sweetnesse of true felicitie, they suffered them-selues to bee so carryed away, as they had no longer care to performe that which belonged to a Childe of GOD. Hee protested that hee had some-times imagined that his sinnes had beene hidden, and that hee could not bee punished, for that CHRIST had made satisfaction for them: but then hee knew too late, that those things belonged onely to the elect and chosen of GOD, betwixt whose sinnes, and the heauenly and celestiall Throne, IESVS CHRIST setts his precious bloud, and the dignitie of his obedience, as a vale and shadowe to couer them: and doth plant them against the diuine vengeance, as a high and strong Rampar, that sinners repenting them, might not bee opprest nor drowned with the deluge and ouer-flowings of their offences and sinnes. As for himselfe, seeing that hee had renounced our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, hee had as one should say, ouerthrowne this strong Rampar with his owne hands, so as after this ruine and ouer-flowing,

the deluge of waters of this vengeance, had couered and swallowed vp his soule. One of his most familiars said vnto him, that he did hold the cause of this his great torment to proceed from aboundance of melancholie humours, which did so trouble his braine. SPIERA remembring, that hee had many times refuted that opinion, and seeing they were to begin againe, sayd vnto the other, you may thinke what you please: but GOD in trueth hath troubled my spirit, and depriued mee of iudgement, seeing it is impossible for mee to haue any hope of my saluation. Hauing continued in such and the like speeches, during his aboad at Padoua, they carryed him backe to his house at Ciuitelle, where hee dyed in this despaire. This which is worthy of consideration among the Histories of our time, is drawne out of a discourse published by Maister HENRIE SCRINGER, a learned Lawyer, who was then at Padoua, did see and many times talke with this poore SPIERA.
            About twenty yeares before, a very famous Doctor throughout all Germanie called KRAVS, remaining at Halle in Swabe, hauing often-times turned his conscience, sometimes towards GOD, sometimes towards the worlde, hauing inclined in the end to the worser part, sayd and confest publikely, that hee was vndone, and fell so deepe into despaire, as hee could neyther receiue nor take any comfort nor consolation, so as in this miserable and wretched estate of his soule, hee slew him-selfe most miserably.

            Cardinall CRESCENCE, being at Verona, to passe on

farther about some matters of importance, was much troubled the 25. of March with writing, and hauing laboured very late at night, rising a little out of his chaire to take breath, he imagined that he did see a black Dog, of an exceeding greatnesse, hauing fiery eyes, and his eares hanging to the ground, which came directly towards him, and then hid himselfe vnder the Table. Hee was presently like one in a sowne, but beeing come againe to himselfe, hee cryed out alowd, calling his seruants that were in the former Chamber, and commanded them to seeke this Dogge with a light. But not finding him there, nor in the anti-chamber, a Feauer seized on him, and encreased in such sort, as hee dyed. Towards the ende of his life, hee cryed often to his seruants: Driue away this Dogge which comes vp to my bed. It was not possible to resolue nor to comfort him. But hee died in great despaire at Verona. Historie of our time. SLEIDAN, lib. 23. of his Comentaries
            
            Vnder the raigne of King FRANCIS the second, the Kings Aduocate in the Parliament of Daulphiné, called PONSENAS, after that he had sold his patrimonie, his wiues, and borrowed much money of his friends to buie this office, hee consumed what remained in keeping of open house, hoping to be soone recompenced to the double. But beeing falne sicke of a disease vnknowne to the Physitions, hee fell into despaire of GODS helpe and mercy: and representing daylye vnto himselfe the death of some innocent persons executed at Romans and at Valence, whome hee had pursued. Hee denyed GOD, called vpon the Diuill, and made all the horrible curses and Imprecations that might bee imagined. His Clarke, seeing him in this

despaire, spake to him of the mercies of GOD, alledging certaine passages of the Scripture to that purpose. But insteed of turning vnto GOD, and asking pardon for his offences, he sayd vnto him; O STEPHEN how black thou art? the young man who was redish hayrd, excused himselfe: the Aduocate replyed againe, how black thou art? but it is with thy sinnes. That is true answered the Clarke, but I hope in the bounty and mercies of GOD: then expounding his saying at large, PONSENAS began to cry out like a desperate man, detesting his seruant, as one of the wickedest and most miserable men in the world. At this crie some of his friends came running, whom hee commanded that STEPHEN should be had to prison, and his processe made. Herevpon despaire did so increase in him, as with sigthes and howling he gaue vp the ghost, after a fearefull manner. His Creditors did scarce giue them leasure to draw the body out of the bed: for euery man sent to seize vpon the moueables which PONSENAS had left, and of all his goods, the which was farre short of their due. The which all men did finde very strange: for that before he entred into that office, he was held to be as riche as any one of his profession. Yet there was neuer so great misery seene, for there was nothing but the strawe left for his Wife and Children, who were taken away in pittie to bee broughtvp, else they must haue beene glad to haue begd their bread, or dyed for hunger, so bare this house was made.

            Merueylous Sleepers.
            
               I Knew a young man who dreaming in the night that he was to ride forth about some businesse, rose vp being fast a sleep out of his bed, made himselfe ready, put on his Bootes and Spurres, and getting vpon a Pole that serued to hang clothes at a Garret window, hee set a-stride on it, and began to Spurre with his heeles, as if he had beene on horseback. But awaking presently, he was so terrified with this accident, as he came vnto me for remedy. P. SALIVS DIVERSVS Physition, Chap. 18. in his Treatie of the affected parts.
            
            I did helpe another, who being of a chollerick and quarrelling disposition, vsed commonly to dreame that he was fighting with one or other, and therevpon rising out of his bed, ran to his weapons, drew out his sword, and fencing it after a strange manner, struck and foyned at the Chamber walles, insomuch that they were faine to take away euery thing out of this Chamber that might either hurt himselfe or others. In the same.
            
            Besides these two I knew an Artificer that in his sleepe rose out of his bed, and going out of the Chamber went vp and downe the staires, and all about the house without any harme. Vpon a time he went starke naked in his sleepe to his shop, and with his Keyes vnlocked the dores of it: where-vpon beeing awaked by some of his friends that mette with him, hee became so ashamed, that hee neuer fell into the like againe. In the same.
            
            Lying in an high chamber in the Colledge of Francfort
               
vpon Odera with maister MARTIN GVTTENBERGER, student in Phisick, a young man of a liuely spirit, small stature, and slender body, but of a moyst braine: and chancing to awake, I sawe him walke starke naked vp and downe the Chamber being fast a sleepe, and then get vp into a great windowe that was wide open, and there stand. Suddainly I ranne to him and caught him in mine armes, fearing lest hee would haue tipled out of the windowe, and hauing carryed him to bedde, I asked him what hee did? Nothing sayd hee: and when hee awaked hee neuer remembred any thing hee had done. I. HORST. Phisition, in his learned treatise of the nature of night-walkers.
            
            Before I went to study Phisick at Francfort, desiryng to see other vniuersities, I was sent for to bee Tutor to three young gentlemen of Misnia, whose Father named GEORGE de SCHLINITZ, Councellor to diuers Princes, and a graue and vnreproueable personage, told mee that he and two of his Bretheren had walked many times in their sleepe whilst they were students at Lipsic, yea and gotten vp into garrets and climbed vp on the toppes of houses: so that one of his brothers chanced to fall and breake his thigh. At length their Tutor looking narrowly vnto them, whipped them wel-fauoredly, assoone as they got out of their bed: which hauing continued twise or thrise vntill such time as they awaked, by that meanes they were helped. The same.
            
            Three young gentlemen bretheren, lying to gither in one Chamber, one of them rose vp naked and sound a sleepe, carrying his shirt in his hand, &amp; went to the windowe, where he caught hold of a corde hanging at a certaine pulley, and winding vp himselfe to the toppe of the

ouse, met with a Pies neast, got out the young ones, wrapped them vp in his shirt, let himselfe downe againe, re-entred into the Chamber window, layd himself down in his bed, and slept as before. Awaking in the morning, he began to say to his brothers. Wot you what I dreamt to night? mee thought I rose out of my bed, went to the windowe, &amp; got vp to the house top, where I foūd a Pies neast and brought away the young ones. His brothers laughed at it: and after other talke, going to rise, hee sought vp and downe for his shirte, which at last hee found with the young Pies wrapped vp in it. They ranne presently and looked vp to the toppe of the house, and sawe where the Pies neast had beene pulled out. The same.
            
            A young Scholler at Blackenbourg did many things sleeping. Assoone as hee had suppt he would haue fallen into so dead a sleepe, that for any noise could bee made he neuer waked. After that with pinching &amp; pulling of him they had made him looke vp, if they carried him to bed, he slept as before: but the next morning hee neuer remembred any thing had bin done ouer night. Moreouer, whatsoeuer he held, being so a sleepe, were it the end of a table, a naile in the wall, a napkin or any garment, they were faine to haue two or three men to open his fingers, and make him let goe his hold: insomuch that many times holding his clothes in his hand, they were forced to carrie him to bedde, and let him lie so with them till hee awaked of himselfe the next morning. The same.
            
            It is not long since that the Duke of Holst Cooke rysing in his sleepe went downe out of his Chamber, and hauing past through a great wide-court, entred into the kitchen,

and got into the Well stradling with his feete, and with his fingers clinging so hard to the sides of it, that in this sort he descended with nothing but his shirte on till he came to the water, which wetting the skirte of his shirte it struck so cold on his heeles that hee awaked, and began to cry out in his language, O mein bein helffe mir that is to say. O my legs, helpe me. The folkes of the house wakened with the cry, &amp; somewhat vnderstanding the voice, sought for him, &amp; finding him hanging by the hands &amp; feete against the sides of the Well they reached him downe a ladder with a candle and a lanthorne. But not able to get him vp that way, they let downe a great bucket willing him to put his right foote in it, and with his hands to hold fast by the chaine of the Well. By which meanes he was drawne vp hauing beene as it were frozen in the Well, they carried him to bedde, where he lost his speech and opened his eyes very seldome and that with paine. Being sent for to visit him, I spent all that daie in fighting with the apoplexy. At length hee began to stirre a little, and to mutter forth some words, but vomyting exceedingly. The next daie I found him come to himselfe againe and talking: hee tould mee howe that night that hee was so in the well hee dreamt that hee was walking, and with stumbling had like to haue fallen, and that him thought hee had beene ouer head and eares in water. Finally after afewe daies hee was thoroughly recouered againe. The same.
            
            A Spanish gentleman, surnamed TAPIA, rose oftentimes in his sleepe, and did many things about the house, going from one place to another without awaking▪ but to the end no mischance should come vnto him, he had

alwaies a basen of water set by his bedde side. Nowe one night in the Sommer-time he arose in his shirt, put a cloake about him, got him forth a dores, beeing all this while fast asleepe, and met (as him thought) with another man who demanded of him whither hee went so late. It is so hot, answered TAPIA that, I meane to go &amp; wash my selfe. And so will I quoth the other, come lets go along togither. Withal my heart▪ sayth TAPIA. Thervpon they got them to the riuer, where TAPIA putting of his cloake and shirte, was going into the water: but the other ieasting beeganne to say, you cannot swimme I am sure: marrie but I can, replyed the gentleman, and it may bee better then you.
            Well (quoth the other) then followe mee. And saying so, hee gotte him vp on a bridge that was thereby, and leaping downe into one of the deepest places of the Riuer, swamme vppe and downe and called to the Gentleman, since you bragge so much, doe as I haue donne. TAPIA followes him, and leapes into the Riuer as all this was donne in his sleepe, so assoone as his feete touched the water hee awaked and laboring all that possiblie hee could, hee beganne to call that other who was not to bee seene. Wherevpon fearing it was some euill Spirit that had drawne him into that danger, after hee had recommended himselfe vnto GOD, hee swamme ouer the Riuer, tooke vp his cloake and shirte, and returned home, recounting that which had happened vnto him: and afterwardes vsed meanes not to fall into the like perrill, againe.

            There haue bin many found, who rysing thus sleeping,

and going vp into windowes that haue beene open, haue falne downe to the ground, breaking their Armes and legges: others haue beene found starke dead: and some so grieuously wounded, as they haue soone after giuen vp the ghost. But it sufficeth vs to propound such as haue escaped (the which are set downe in Bookes that wee haue seene) vntill that time may discouer the rest, by some man more diligent then my selfe, who may note all if it please him.
            I haue heard of a young Maiden at Paris, which did vsually euery night goe to bathe her selfe in the Riuer, being a sleepe: The which shee continued long, vntill that her Father being aduertised thereof, watched her in the Streete, and whipt her well, to make her leaue this custome: whereat the Maide awaked, and was much ashamed to see her selfe naked in the streete.

            It is also reported, that a Scholler, hauing had a quarrell the night before with one of his companions, rise vp in his sleepe, and went and slue his enemie lying in his bed in another Chamber, and then hee returned to his owne bed without waking, as it was supposed: for the next day the Iustice being called by the Host, found him a sleepe, and his Dagger bloudie, confessing that hee had dreampt that he had sl

            Strange efficacie and power of Satan.
            
               MAster THEODORE Sonne to CORNELIVS some-times Consull of Goude in Holland, reported this History vnto mee that followeth, auouching it to bee verie true. In a village called Ostbrouch neere vnto Vtrech there dwelt a widowe, who had a seruant whome shee imployed about necessary affaires of the house. He hauing obserued, (as seruants are often curious) that this widowe went late in the night, when all were at rest, into one certaine place in the stable, stretching forth her hands vpon the racke, whereas they vsually put haie for their Cattell. Hee wondring what it ment, resolued to do as much without the priuity of his Mistresse, and to trie the effect of this ceremonie. Soone after, following his Mistresse who was gone into the stable, hee goes and takes hold of the racke. Sodenly hee feeles himselfe to be lifted vp into the aire, and to be carried into a Caue vnder grownd in a little Towne called Vuich, whereas hee found a Synagoge of Sorcerers, deuising togither of their witch-crafts. His Mistresse amazed at this vnexpected presence, asked him howe hee came into that companie: to whome hee reported what had happened. She beganne to bee in a great rage against him, fearing least those mighty assemblies should be descouered by that meanes, yet shee consulted with her companions what was to be done in that difficultie. In the ende they concluded to entertaine this new guest

friendly, forcing a promise from him to keepe silence, and to sweare not to descouer the secrets which then had beene made knowne vnto him, beyond his hope or merit. This poore man promiseth wonders, and flatters euery one: and least hee should bee more toughly handled, he makes a shew to bee admitted of that Sinagogue, if it pleased them. In these Consultations the time was spent, and the houre of departure approched. Then they make an other consultation at the instance of the Mistresse; whether for the preseruation of many, it were not expedient to cut the seruants throte, or to carrie him backe. By a common consent they inclyned to the milder course, to carry him backe againe, seeing hee had taken his oath not to reueale any thing. The Mistresse vndertakes this charge, who (after protestations made) takes him vpon her backe, promising to carrie him backe vnto her house. But hauing made part of the way, they discouered a Lake full of reedes. The Mistresse meeting with this occasion, and fearing still that this young man (repenting himselfe that hee had beene admitted to these hellish feastes) would descouer what hee had seene: shakes him violently from her shoulders, hoping (as it was likely) that hee should loose his life, as well through the violence of his high fall, as that hee should bee buried in the mudde of the Lake.
            But as GOD is infynitly mercifull, desiring not the death of a sinner; but that hee should conuert and liue: hee did limmit the furious desseins of this Sorceresse, and would not suffer this young man to bee drowned, so as his fall was not mortall, for tumbling downe, hee met with a thicke tufte of reedes, which did abate the

violence of his fall: yet he was verie sore hurt, hauing no meanes to helpe himselfe but with

Daie being come, in lamenting and crying out, it was the will of GOD that some passengers beeing amazed at this extraordinary Clamor, after they had sought dilligently, found this poore Bodie halfe dead, hauing both his knees out of ioynt. They inquire whence hee was, and how hee came in that case: and hearing the whole discourse, after they had drawne him out of that miserable place they caused him to bee transported in a Cart to Vtrecht. The Bourgemaster, called IOHN of Colombourg (a vertuous Gentleman) rauished with admiration for so strange an accident, made a dilligent inquirie of the matter, and caused the Sorceresse to bee apprehended and committed to prison, where shee confessed all that had past voluntarilie and without torture, beseeching him to take some pittie of her. But by a generall consent this woman was condemned and publickly burnt. The seruant laie long beefore hee was cured of his hurtes, especially of his thighes, beeing punnished for his detestable curiositie. Maister BAVDOVIN de ROVSEY in his medicinall Epistles. Epist. 50.
            ERASMVS in his Epistles vpon the report of HENRY of GLARIS a learned man in our time, writes that the 10. of Aprill 1533. in an Inne at Sciltac a Towne in Suisserland, distant some eight good Leagues from Fribourg, as night approched they heard a certaine hissing, which seemed to come out of one of the Chambers. The master of the house suspecting there were some theeues did runne to that place. Whereas hee found not any

man, but hee still herd the same voice in the garret, and from thence on the toppe of the Chimney. Then presuming it should bee some euill spirit, hee sent for two Preestes to coniure it, who hauing begunne their exorcismes, the spirit answered them, that hee cared not for thē, for the one was a whore-hunter, and both were theeues, so as in despight of all they could doe, hee would burne the Towne, as he had vndertaken. Some thought it was for Ielousie which hee had conceiued against the hostes Sonne and the maide of the house, of whome hee had had carnall knowledge, by the space of foureteene years, as she confessed afterwards at her death. Hauing therfore raised this creature in an instant, to the toppe of the Chimney, he deliuered fire into her hand, commanding her to fire the Towne, the which shee did, so as in lesse then an houre all was consumed to ashes, neither could water or vineger quench this fire. This was a reall thing, and the fire also which the Diuell brought, was reall and materiall, but of an other nature then the common fire, or any artificiall that can bee made. And yet it came not from aboue, as the fire of lightning, the which burneth little, if it fall not by chance among gonpowlder, as in the yeare 1500. it happened at Paris in the Tower of Billy: and sence at Macklin in Brabant and at Venise. Blaise Viginere in his treaty of Comets.
            
            I will adde vnto this history what PHILIP CAMERARIVS reports, who sayth that the fire fell here and there vpon houses like vnto fiery boullets, and when that anie one did runne to helpe to quench his neighbours house being on fire, they called him backe presently to saue his owne. They had great difficultie to saue a Castell of free stone, seated a good waie from the Towne. I haue

heard the particularities of this terrible visitation, from the mouth of the Curate of the place, and other Inhabitants of good credit, who had beene spectators of all. The Curate told mee, that this euill and cruell spirit, did counterfeit the singing and melodious tunes of diuerse birds, and many that were in my company did wonder with mee, to see the Curate haue as it were a Crowne about his long haire, which hee carried after the ancient manner, all of diuers colours: saying, that it had beene done by this spirit, which had cast the hoope of a Hogshead at his head. Hee added moreouer, that the same spirit did aske him one day with some others, if they had neuer heard a Rauen croake? That therevpon this enemie, made so horrible a noyse, as all that were present were so amazed, as if it had continued any longer, they would haue dyed for feare. Moreouer, this olde man did affirme, (but not without blushing) that oftentimes this enemie of mans saluation, laide open to himselfe and to others, that did accompany him, the secret sinnes they had committed, so exactly, as all were foreced to leaue the place, and retire themselues to their houses ashamed.

last of Iune about a hundred yeares since, towardes night: Cracouia the capitall Cittie of Poland was sett on fire, the which was in a manner all burnt. It was a wonderfull ruine, by reason of many thousands of houses that were consumed to Ashes. Maister Cromer, lib. 30. of the Historie of Poland.
            
            In the yeare 1514. the 11. of Ianuary at night, fire tooke the Realte at Venice, and first consumed the riche shoppes, which were very many. A Northerly winde blowing very vehemently, carryed this fire to the next houses: in an instant all was on fire: so as infinite buildings were ruined. Saint IOHNS Temple, the Meale Market, and al the buildings about it. The shoppes of Gold-smiths and changers were consumed. This fire continued all night, and could not bee quenched, but in making place by the ruine of houses, and whole streetes. Most part of the Cittie was defaced by this accident. Since it hath beene so reedefied, beautified, and inlarged, as this losse, hath not beene seene these many yeares. P. IOVIVS, lib. 12. of his Histories.
            
            The yeare 1518. in Iune, after a horrible Ecclipse of the Sunne, there followed at the same houre a terrible fire at Vienna in Austria, the which burnt a quarter of the Cittie.

            In the yeare 1536. the 2. of May, a gust of winde hauing scattered sparkles here and there, fire tooke in many houses at Delft, a great, fayre, and famous Towne in Holland, so as in fewe houres the greatest part thereof was ruined, and had like to haue beene all consumed

by this fire. But it hath beene so repayred since, as at this day it is one of the pleasingest and most delightfull Townes that can be seene. In this fire there happened a memorable accident. Men of credit did see that time a Stroke (whereof there are great numbers in Holland) which comming from her prey, discouered, that the fire had taken the nest, where her young ones were. She began to fall vpon it, to see if shee could preserue them from the fire: but for that they were yet vnfethered, and that there was no meanes to drawe them forth, shee fell vpon them with her wings spred abroad, and couering her young ones, was so consumed to Ashes with them.

            In the yeare 1539. betwixt Iune and Iuly, vpon a Thursday at night, fire tooke at Constantinople, neere vnto the prison appointed for criminall persons, in the shops of such as sold Tallow, Rosin, Oyle, and such like stuffe, so as it tooke hold of the prison which was barred very close, and there smothered seauen hundred men. From thence it dispersed it selfe on euery side through the Citty, &amp; comming to another prison, they were constrained to let them forth, else they had all perished: for in a moment this prison was consumed to Ashes. Then the fire aduanced towards the wodden gate, where as the Smithes forges be, &amp; such as deale in Yron works: from thence it tooke hold of the Captaine of the Ianisaries house, &amp; consumes all it meetes in that quarter. Then it gets into the Tauerners street, &amp; that being consumed, it doth seize vpon a great place called Tachral Cala, then it

turned towards the Copper-smiths, and the Glassehouses▪ enuironing all that quarter that is about the painted Stoues. Then going on, it came to the place where the Iewes dwelt, where it made a wonderfull spoile, for that the houses stand very close. The slames flew to the gate of the Fish-market, and consumed all that it incountred betwixt that and the Iewes Streete, whose houses were burnt to Ashes. Neither was it possible by any meanes to quench this fire, so as it continued all night, and the next day, euen vnto the euening, haueing wasted and consumed the best part of the Cittie, and Suburbes thereof, vnto the Sea-shoare.

            In the yeare 1546. on Saterday the seuenth of August, fire fell from Heauen, vpon Macklin in Brabant, and fiered a Tower, where was a hundred Barrels of poulder. This Towre was quite ouer-throwne, with a peece of the Towne wall, of two hundred paces, neere vnto the sayd Towre. Then the fire of this poulder tooke hold of the neere places, and did so fire all the Towne, as if a great shower of raine had not falne, this great Cittie had beene consumed to Ashes. The next day they found so many dead carcases, and so stinking, as they were forced with all speed to make great holes, and to burie them by dozens at a time. All the Sunday was spent in such burials. The number of the hurt exceeded a hundred and fiftie. They found a Woman with Childe smoothered vnder certaine ruines, who beeing speedilye opened, her Childe was found breathing, and was Baptised. A Gentle-woman leaping out of her bedde to open a windowe in her Chamber, her head was cutt off with a Thunder-boult, so as it hung with-out life

by a peece of the skinne. In a corner of a streete, neere vnto BERNARDS Pallace, a Tauerner called CROES, being gone into the Seller to drawe Beere for his guests, whereof some played at Cardes: the house in a moment was ouer-throwne, the players among others were crusht in peeces, hauing the Cardes yet in their hands, when they drew them from vnder the ruines. No one in the house escaped but onely the hoast, preserued by meanes of the valted Caue into the which hee was gone. Three dayes after this pittifull Accident, there were many found in Caues dead for hunger, others smothered, or fainted away, with the terror and insupportable stinke of the lightning. They found a man and a woman that were carryed away, and as it were tyed fast betwixt the branches of a Tree. The suburbes of Neckecspsis were in a maner all ruined. This Cittie so pleasant and fayre before, was all disfigured, and as it were torne in peeces: her stately buildings spoiled and ouerthrowne: among others, the Emperors Pallace, the Lady MARGVERITS, and that of Berque, were strooke with lightning, and ouer-throwne. The house of the Italian Bankers was quite ruined: the Poste lodging spoyled, and the Stable carryed away with the Horses. A part of the Augustines Couent, and of other Temples in the Cittie were broken. The Count of Hocstrats house endured, and brake the shocke of this storme, the which ceased when it had ouer-throwne it. With out it nothing had beene left standing, neyther within the Towne nor about it. There were found huge quarters of free Stone cast by the Tempest, aboue sixe hundred paces from the Wall, to the great hurt of those places where they fell. It was a fearefull Tempest,

selfe in other things with-in my intention, which is not to exceed the wonders of late dayes, whereof I will produce some examples.
            In the Country of Agenois is the famous house of BEAV▪VILLE, some-times very riche, and of great possessions, from the which the Marshall of Monlucs wife was descended. It is held for a true History, that the Grand-mother of the sayd Lady had nine Daughters at one birthe, that were all married and had Children. The Mother and the sayd Daughters successiuely were interred at Saint Crepasi, the Collegiall Church of Agen, built and founded by the sayd house of BEAV-VILLE: the Mother hauing made her Tombe in the Church vpon a portall, betwixt nine others which she had also caused to bee made for her Daughters, in memory thereof. I haue seene some of them being at Agen in the yeare 1577. in the said Church. The others haue beene ruined during the ciuill warres: And this was the History. The Lady of BEAV-VILLE had a Chamber-maid that was faire and louely, with whom her husband seemed to be in loue, so as she to be honestly rid of her, married her. This Maide at her first lying in, had three children, which made the Gentlewoman suspect that her husband had a share in them, imagining it not possible that one woman could conceiue by one man such a number of children. The which increased her iealousie, and not-withstanding any perswasions, shee began to defame and hate this poore Maide more and more.
            It happened a while after that the Gentlewoman was with child, &amp; so big, as she was deliuered of nine daughters. The which they did interpret to bee a punishment sent frō GOD, that she might be ashamed of her slander

seeing they might obiect vnto her a greater fault, as if she had beene familiar with many, for shee did alwaies obstinately maintayne, that a woman could not conceiue aboue two Children by one man. Beeing much ashamed, fearing to be diffamed, and condemned by her owne sentence, she was so tempted by the euill spirit, as shee resolued to cause eight of her Daughters to bee drowned, and to keepe one: keeping the matter secreat betwixt the Mid-wife and her Chamber-maide, to whome this cursed Commission was giuen. But it was GODS will that the husband comming from hunting met with the Chamber-maide, &amp; descouering the practise preserued his innocent Daughters from death, caused them to bee nursed vnknowne to the Mother, and at their Christening called them all BORGVE, by one name, and so hee did the ninth which the Mother had reserued. When they were some-what growne, he caused them all to be brought into his house appareled in one liuery, hauing also attired that with in the house of the same sort. Being altogither in one Chamber, hee caused his wife to come in, accompained with their Parents and familyar friends: and bidde her to call BOVRGVE. At this call euery one of the nine answered, where at the Mother was much amazed, and the more for that they were all of the like stature, face, countenance and voice, and in the like apparell, which made her heart to giue that they were her nine Daughters: and that GOD had preserued the eight, which shee had exposed, and held to bee dead whereof her husband did satisfie her, reproching vnto her her inhumanity before all the companie, and shewing her that this might chance to confound her in the bad opinion which she had alwaies held of him concerning

her Chamber-maide. M. L. IOVBERT. lib. 3. Chap. 2. of his popular errors.
            
            I haue heard that in the house of ESTOVRNEAV in Perigort there chanced the like Accident about 300. years ago. The Lady had 9. Sons at on birth, and would haue exposed eight of them, the which were happely preserued (through the grace of GOD) by the Fathers meeting them. All nine liued, and were aduanced to great places: foure were of the Church, and fiue of the world. Of the Clergie men one was Bishoppe of Perigueux and Abbot of Branlaume. The second was Bishoppe of Paniez. The third Abbot of Grand-Selue, and the fourth of the house of GOD. Of the secular men, one was the Kings Lieutenant at Reole against the English. The second had a gouernment in Bourgongne, and the other three were in great credit about the King. All this is to bee seene at this daie painted in a great Hall, in the Castell of Estourneue, as the Seigneour of Estourneau hath tould mee, beeing issued from that famous and verie ancient house, and nowe Steward of the King of Nauarres house, which is now King of France. The same Author liber. 4. Chapter 2.
            That of the Pourcelets of Arles in Prouence, is almost like vnto this, out of the which is issued the Noble house of the Conuertis: who were so called, for that the Chamber-maide which carried the eight to drowne, beeing met by the husband, sayd that they were Pigges which shee went to drowne for that the Sowe could not keepe them. Some say it came by the curse of a poore woman, who begged an almes of the gentlewoman of the house: the sayd poore woman hauing many little

Children about her. The which the gentlewoman reproched vnto her, as proceeding of wantonesse, and that shee was too much giuen to men. The poore woman, (who was honest) did then praie, that the gentlewoman might conceiue with as many Children, as a Sowe hath Pigges. It so fell out by the will of GOD, to let the Ladie vnderstand, that wee must not impute that to vice which is a great blessing.
            They report as much of the Noble famelie of Scroua at Padoua, which carries a Sowe in their Armes, in Italien called SCROFA, and in corrupt Langage Scroua, which is the surname of that famelie. In the Annales of Lombardie it is written, that in the time of ALGIMONT the first King of the Lombards, there was a strumpet brought in bedde of seauen Sonnes, and that the one of them succeeded the sayd ALGIMONT. IOHN PICVS Prince of Mirandola writes in his Commentaries vpon the second Psalme, that in Italie a Germaine woman was brought in bedde at twise of twentie Children, at the first birth shee had twelue, and that the burthen was so heauie, as shee was faine to keepe it vp with a towell. ALBVCACIS a great Physition, and an Arrabian Surgion, is a witnesse of a woman that had seauen Children, and of an other that miscarried of fiueteene well proportioned. PLINIE makes mention of one that miscarried of twelue. MARTIN CROMER in his Historie of Poland writes that the wife of the Earle VIRBOSLAS in Cracouia was deliuered of sixe and thirtie Children aliue, in the yeare 1269. But that which exceedes all other examples and which is extraordynarie, supernaturall and miraculous, is that which is written of a Countesse of Holland, the which LEVVIS

GVICHARDIN doth set downe in his description of the Lowe Countries, as it is testified in an Abbey neere to the Hage. MARGVERITE Daughter to the Noble Lord, Plorent Earle of Holland and of Mathilde Daughter to HENRY Duke of Brabant, Sister to WILLIAM King of Germany, being about two and fortie yeares old, was brought in bed on friday before Easter, in the yeare 1313. (as Histories do write) of 365. Children, males and females, the which (in the presence of many Noblemen and Gentlemen) beeing layed orderly in a great basin, were Baptized by a Bishoppe: the males were all called by one name IOHN, &amp; the females ELIZABETH. All died soone after, and so did the Mother, and were buried togither in one graue. L. VIVES; ERASMVS and others which report this Historie, say, that it was for-asmuch as the sayd Ladie had mockt a verie poore woman as shee was a begginge some releefe of her, for that shee carried two Twinnes. Shee did blame her verie much (saying it was impossible that a woman should haue two Children beegotten at one time of one Father. Here-vpon the poore woman made her earnest praier vnto almightie GOD, that (for proofe of her innocencie, beeing wrong-fully accused) that the Countesse might carrie as manie Children at one birth as there were number of seuerall daies in the whole yeare.
            To returne to our Histories of fewer Children at a burthen, wee haue seene a woman at Aubenas in Viuares, who at her first burthen had two Children, at her second three, and at the third foure. At Orillac in Auvergne the Wife of one called SABATIER, had three Sons at a birth. The first &amp; the last liued 24 houres the

middle (who therefore was called IOHN of three) came to mans estate; was marryed at Paris, and liued long. The Wife of a Capper in Rouan, crooked and little, had fiue Sonnes at one birthe, in the yeare 1550. All this is extracted out of Maister L. IOVBERT. lib. 3. chap. 1. of his popular errors. Let vs adde herevnto some other Histories.
            In the yeare 1554. at Perme in Suitzerland, the wife of IHON GELINGER a Doctor, was deliuered of fiue Children at one birthe, three males and two females. PLINIE talkes of a Greeke, who at foure burthens had twenty Children, whereof the most part liued. DALECHAMPS in his French Chirurgerie writes, that a Gentle-man of Sienna, called BONAVENTVRE SAVELLI, had assured him, that a slaue and Concubine of his, had seuen Children at one birthe, whereof foure were baptized. And in our time betwixt Sarte and Maine, in the parish of Seaux neere vnto Chambellay, there is a Gentlemans house called Maldemette, whose wife had the first yeare shee was married two Children, the second yeare three, the third foure, the fourth fiue, and the fift yeare sixe children, whereof she dyed: one of these sixe children is yet liuing, Seigneor of that place of Maldemette Maister AMB. PARE lib. 24. chap. 5.
            They haue seene often in Spaine, a woman deliuered of three Children: and not long since, a woman had foure at a burthen. It was generally reported a good while since, that a great Lady was brought in bedde at Medina del Campo of seauen Children. And they say that a Stationers Wife at Salamanca had nine. Seeing wee treate of those Admirable Histories, of many Children deliuered at one birthe, I will report what AVICENNE

doth witnesse in the ninth booke of Creatures, of a woman who at one birth brought forth 70. Children well proportioned. And ALBERT the Great writes that he hath heard for certaine of a Physition, which beeing called in a certaine Towne in Germanie, to visit a sicke Lady, found that she had beene deliuered at one birth of 150. Children, all wrapt togither in a little filme, as bigge as a mans little finger, all which came forth aliue with their iust proportion. A. TORQVEMADO in the first daies worke of his hexameron. It is admirable, that a woman should haue so many Children, so small, and yet proportioned and aliue, as wee haue seene of the Countesse of Holland, and other women aboue mentioned by AVICENNE and ALBERT. For the explayning of the whole. I will adde that which CONSTANTIVS VAROLIVS a learned Physition at Bolonia the fatte doth write in the 4. booke of his anatomie. I haue seene (saith hee) an abortiue frute of three weekes, confusedly proportioned of the bignesse of a barley curnell, where I did note the head and the brest, but no armes nor thighes. Moreouer I haue seene an other of sixe weekes old, hauing a distinct forme of the bignes of a Bee, where did appeere the eyes, the nose, the mouth, the heart, the lights, the ribbes, the backe, the liuer, the Midriffe, the stomacke, the reines, the bowells, the yard &amp; other parts: the which I shewed vnto many. The armes and thighes beganne to bud forth, beeing very small in proportion to the rest of this little Bodie, for the thighes were no bigger then a graine of mill, and the armes twise as bigge. I haue seene many other such aboriue fruits, of the bignesse of a beane, a snaile or a frog. Whereas I haue alwaies found all the parts, and did euer obserue that the extremities

were lesse in proportion then the rest: in such sort notwithstanding, as the spirit quickning this masse, doth fasshon and shape all the partes thereof togither: but hee doth bring in successiuely the fall and perfect fynishing of the forme. This our Bodie is a rich and admirable web, a peece of tapistrie of high price, the which should mooue vs thinke often, of the contentes of the 139. Psalme.
            CONRAD LICOSTHENES in his collection of prodigies, reporting the historie of a Germaine, who at two deliueries had twenty Children, addes that in the territorie of MODENA, an Italian called ANTONIA, about forty yeares old, who had beene alwaies accustomed to haue foure Children at a time, or three at the least, had then forty as the Bishop of Como doth testefie, who writ the Historie.
            Leauing these ancient Histories, whereof wee could produce a great number, wee will report some of our time. A Country woman in Suisserland in the yeare. 1535. had foure Sonnes at one birth the which liued some houres. An other woman about Zurich had also foure Sonnes at one time the which were Christened. STVMPSVIS and LICOSTHENES. A Sicilian named PAMIQVE, married to BERNARD BELLOVARD of Agrigentum, was so fertill, as at thirty birthes shee had seauentie three Children.

            The Lady MARIE of Neufchastell, hauing had nine Children by the Baron of Cremaille: in her second marriage with the Seigneour of Malortie, shee was with Childe of three Sonnes, with which number being but

small of stature) shee was so ouercharged, as about the 5. moneth shee was deliuered of one onely. And shee thinking, (as M. THIBAVT, a famous Physition at Chasteautierry did also) that they were but burthens; he prescribed her a strong purgation, to make her voide those things, the which brought down the other two children, so whole and liuely, as the Physition him selfe (repenting him) said, that without doubt they would haue gone out their full time, notwithstanding the miscarrying of the other, if the purgation had not done them wrong. Afterwards, shee was oft with childe, and almost alwaies with Twins; some-times with sonnes, some-times with daughters: in the one of them shee was so hurt with a dogge, as finding her selfe presently ill, shee feared that her fruit was dead; so as fifteene daies after, shee was brought in bed of two children, whereof the one was dead, beeing very apparent that it had beene long before suffocated: the other was aliue, but so weake, by the communication of his brothers harme, that for 3. daies he could not sucke; yet he was so carefully tended, as he recouered, &amp; was since a Page of the Kings Stable.

            CHRISTIAN SCHLECHTIN hauing had tenne children by her first husband, shee married againe with MICHAEL VOGEL Prouost of Bollickhein, a village three houres iourney from Basil, and beeing with childe about the fiftieth yeare of her age, and the thirtieth of her marriage, in the yeare of our Lord 1575. one Sonday in Aprill shee fell in labour, and was deliuered of a daughter named MARIE, which died within fifteene daies. Beeing vp and labouring about the house fiue weekes and fiue daies after this first deliuerie, shee had had newe throaes, so as shee was deliuered of a sonne called PHILIP, by his fathers name, who liues yet: after that she had not any more children. The same Author.
            
            In the yeare 1584. there died at Hirshorn, a little town of the Pallatinate, neere to Heildelberge, a gentleman Lord of that place, called PHILIP LODOVIC of Hirshorn, leauing no heires of his body, but a widowe with childe; those which pretended to be his heires (if the widow miscarried, or that the fruit of her wombe did not liue) began presently to molest and trouble her, pulling the keyes of chambers, coffers, cabinets, caues, and greniers from her by force; the which did so much afflict her, as laying her hands vpon her heade, shee began to crie out amaine, and within fewe daies after shee was deliuered of a sonne, but dead, hauing no head. The heires runne presently and seize vpon his succession that was dead: but they did not long enioy it. The widow being risen out of child-bed, felt her selfe very heauy, thinking it had beene the swelling of some humors

gathered together in her body by reason of her heauinesse. Some Physitians (whose aduise shee did aske) were of the same opinion, not once dreaming of that which followed soone after. And therefore they aduised her to goe to certaine bathes and minerall waters along the Rhine, whether shee went, accompanied with one maide, where she arriued in Iuly. At that time the Elector of Saxonie was there with his Wife, and many other Princes and Princesses, so as the poore widowe being destitute of a lodging, was forced to repaire to the Prouost or Mayor of the place, acquainting him with her condition. In the end shee obtained with great intreatie to lodge in the Prouosts house for that night: This night (being ten weekes after her first birthe) shee was brought in bedde of a goodly Sonne: whereof the Princes being aduertised the next day, and of the whole History, did honour her, for the Elector of Menzt made her a stately feast according to the custome of Germany. Hee of Saxonie gaue her a thousand Dollers, and they forced them that had seized vpon the inheritance, to leaue it to the lawfull heire new borne, who was left in the garde and keeping of his Mother.

               LOVYSE POVPARD, wife to Maister NICHOLAS SEVIN, called Champgaste of Orleans, thinking that her termes were not stopt, but by reason of a quarten ague (for then they doe commonly cease) was conceiued with Child: but not beleeuing it, shee vsed

such Phisicke, letting of bloud, and other applications, as they do vsually, as well for the quarten ague, as for the hardnesse of the splene, the which they tooke then for the childe that was in her belly, not conceiuing what it was, but rather some masse gathered together, by the pretended retention of the menstruall bloud. In the end the child being dead, and the parts growne more soft, being rotten, without any shew of deliuery, in time the bones disioyned within her, and did pierce the Matrix behinde towards the great gutte, so as she then began to voide them by little and little by the seege, and among others a whole bone of the legge. Hauing languished thus a long time, shee dyed, and was opened the sixt day of February 1565. by FLORENT PHILIP, and MICHEL PICHARD, who found nothing within her but rotten bones, and especially those of the head, with admiration how shee could so long sub-sist. This woman seemed to haue beene curable, by the Gastrotomia, or section of hir belly, if her greefe had beene knowne in time, and the remedy that is vsed in Caesarien birthes, practised discreetly. FR. ROVSSET in his Histerotomotie.
            
            CATHERINE des FIEFS, Lady of Oucy neere vnto Milly, in her second marriage fell sicke, and with Childe at one instant, not imagining that shee was conceiued, and was Phisicked at Paris being sicke, as the other had beene at Orleans, with many helpes, yea entring into a sweating diet, notwith-standing that one of the Queenes Mid-wiues did iudge her to be with Childe, by all the accidents of a woman in that case, orderly obserued by her, from the staying of her termes, vnto milke in her brests, and so to the ninth moneth: at which time all did

cease with the free motion of the childe, hauing then paines of child-bearing without effect, and presently after there followed all the signes of a dead childe: whereof they yet tooke no heed. So returning from Paris to her house, she euer after carried this child suffocated, euen vnto her dying day, which was fifteene moneths after the ninth precedent, that it was aliue. The soft parts rotting and falling away beneath, were held with good reason, by N. PONET a learned Phisition of Melun, for filthe comming out of the Matricall vlcer, and the bones remaining for a tumor of the spleene. In the end being dead and opened, the 3. of October 1570. by LVC CHAMPENAIS, and IAMES DAZIER, Barbers at Milly, in the presence of the Seigneiors of Verran and la Gainiere, with many others, there was yet found in her much corruption, no matrix, and all the bones of a child, some rotten, others whole, and among others one of the two that ioyne vnto the shoulder vpon the brest, hauing already pierced the skin that couereth the bowels, and the Muscles of the belly, nothing remaining but the skin which did appeare without on the left side all blacke, the which had long before beene taken for a tumor of the spleene. If her griefe had beene well looked into, by the concurrence and continuance of signes in her greatnesse, the child being dead, and other co-incidences wel obserued by order, and knowne what it was: there had beene hope, when as she could not be deliuered, to haue saued both her and her fruite by the Gastrotomia, or Caesarien section: or else the child being dead, to haue preserued the Mother, by the meanes of this section, beeing then the onely and most necessarie remedie.

Here neere vnto my lodging hath fallen out an accident, as strangely as your Caesarien section. A woman with childe, being aged, or otherwise, could not be deliuered but by morcels: shee had eyther side of the bottome of her belley very much swelled, by reason of the violence of their Instruments, with all signes of an Impostume, the which did also communicate with the passages of Nature, from that part of the belly (beeing layde open by corosey) came a great aboundance of filthe, and as much more of the like substance and coulour by the neather parts, shee would not suffer mee to sound it with the Instrument, to descerne precisely and aduisedly the bottome of the Synuositie: but without it, it appeared plainely, that the Impostume and the ouer-ture thereof did pierce into the Matrix, by the common accidents obserued and kept, according to the order of times, and by the like excrements, the one and the other beeing cured by the same meanes, and at the same time.

                from a bakers wife called COLETTE SIMON, without hurting the skin that lapt the Child in the belly; shee happened in 5. daies to haue a great swelling of either side in the bottome of her belly, with apparēt signes of an Impostume, so as an opening was made by Corosiue, on the one side, from whence the Surgion did drawe with his hand a quantitie of congealed bloud, rotten and stinking, the other side abating nothing, neyther could the Surgion bring away any of the skinne that lapt the Child being forced to make a new opening on the other side, frō whence he did draw the skin that lapt the child, not without extreame paine in this danger and despaire: for shee remained as one halfe dead, and kept her bedde three yeares, two yeares after shee went with Cruches, then with a Staffe, and in the ende shee recouered her helth in such sort, as shee had many Children and among others, one named SEBASTIEN, who liued long. In the same treatie. M. N. de VILLENEVFVE an ancient Physition in Prouence, writs to the same FR. ROVSSET these words. I confesse in this long time that I haue liued (he was then sixtie yeares olde and liued aboue fiue and twentie yeares after in great vigour of bodie and minde) I did neuer see this practise whereof you write vnto mee, of a woman deliuered of her Childe by the side, and yet to liue. I do well remember that MADAME de PILES NONIES hauing the lower part of her belly much swelled, I caused Maister MAVRACE a Surgion of this Towne of Vaureas to make an opening in the bellie by an actuall Corosiue, peercing into the hollowes of the matrix, from whence there issued as well by the neither partes as by the place so opened aboue

seauen pounds of filthie matter, the one like vnto the other, and to bee the better assured of the place, wee did open the nether part with an instrument where wee did see the greatnesse of the matricall vlcer, the which wee cured in sixe monethes, since which time shee had a Daughter, this was in the yeare 1552. VILLENEVFVE seemes to desseine a conception, and the fruite wholie putrefied, and reduced into this merueilous quantity of corruption, although that M. ROVSSET thinkes it was onely an Impostume in the matrixe. The same VILLENEVFVE reports in an other letter to the sayd ROVSSET, that he had caused the like cauterisation to be made vpon that which is vpon the belly of a woman married to BRISSET an Apothicary at Mont-limar, in the yeare 1558. peercing it euen into the inward part of the matrix, so as the corruption sprong out to the beddes feete, and at the same instant a great quantitie of the like filth came forth by the lower partes. Shee was cured in 3. monethes, and soone after conceiued, and since shee hath had three Sonnes and one Daughter. In the same treatie.
            
            M. MATHIAS CORNAX Phylosopher and Physition to the Emperour at Vienna in Austria reports (in a Treatie written in Latin, and often printed,) some admirable and memorable Histories, like vnto the former. I will ommit many circumstances of places, yeares and daies, personages and witnesses produced to auoyde tediousnesse: the summe is this. MARGV

               RITE wife to the host of the red Creuise at Vienna about 25. yeare old, who before had had some Children, shee was conceiued for the third or forth time, in the yeare 1545. hauing felt (as of custome) the Childe to stirre, and the time of

her deliuerie come, shee could bring forth nothing: so as for the space of foure whole yeares shee carried her Childe dead, the same beeing past (as it appeered) from the hollownes of the Matrix being rotten, through the bodie, vlcered there-with towardes the bowells, and there causing a great swelling, an opening was made by the aduise of CORNAX in the middest of that which is vpon the bellie to voide the corruption. The Physitions and Surgions could not thinke there was anie Childe, considering the lapse of time, during the which the poore woman had beene afflicted with verie strange paines. Yet a Childe was drawne from her which was not so rotten, (the which was admirable) but it might well bee discerned for a male. There happened an other wonderfull strange thing, that this honest young woman which had liued with death for so manie yeares, was in a manner miraculously drawne out of the graue, and recouered her perfect helth. Let vs adde a third meruaile: at a yeares ende shee conceiued, and bare an other Sonne his full time. The time of her deliuerie beeing come, beeing in some great difficultie, and almost without any possible meanes to bee deliuered like vnto other women. CORNAX was called the second time, who aduised the Mother and other women there present, that they should suffer her to bee opened, as at the former time: giuing verie manie reasons for his Counsell wherevnto the young woman yeelded. But the Mother and the other women that were there opposed mightely against it, saying that they must referre all to the almightie GOD, and let nature worke, in easing her by some other meanes lesse dangerous. CORNAX beeing thus

gaine sayed, retired with the Surgion who had made the former section. But presently after the young woman dyed and could not bee deliuered. Soone after they cald them back, and being dead there was drawne from her by section a goodly boy, likely to haue liued if hee had beene helpt with his Mother, as this learned Physition did pretend.
            In the same worke there is a letter written to the same CORNAX by M. ACHILLES GASSAR a learned Physition of Ausbourg, conteyning the like history in the same circū
               stances of a woman, to whom a yeare being past that she could not bee deliuered of a Child at the due time, the Child (like vnto that of the woman of Vienna) was gone frō the hollownes of the Matrix being vlcered, towards the kidneis, as it did appeere plainly, for that it had made a shewe of an Impostume in the bellie, and principally on the left side, the Surgion drewe from her boane, after boane, who beeing cured had a Childe since.
            Hee reportes in the same booke the Historie sent vnto him by Maister GILLES HERTOGE a famous Physition at Bruxelles, of a woman, who not able to bee deliuered of her Childe, the flesh and softe partes of the Child being voided belowe in rotten corruption, they did feele the bones to grate together, and did marke them with the hand vnder that which couers the bellie and yet this accident which was so strangely troublesome and insupportable to a fine and delicate woman, did not much hinder the actions of this courragious woman: who carried this Crosse thirteene whole yeares. This could not bee without peercing of the Matrix, the which notwithstanding was cured, as needes it must, for that no filth nor corruption

distilled downe by the lower parts, 'as else it would haue done. More-ouer she had her termes orderly: and desired nothing so much, as to finde Physitions and Chirurgions that would vnder-take to make a conuenient section, to draw forth those cracking bones.
            Maister FRANCIS ROVSSET, (representing in his Treatie of the Caesariens deliuery (the third History aboue mentioned by CORNAX) confirmes them by another very admirable of ALBVCASIS a Physition and Chirurgion, the which I will discribe here, although it bee ancient, hoping that this digression shall not be vnpleasing. I haue seene sayd hee (in the second booke of his Surgerie) a woman (in whose wombe a Childe being dead) conceiued of another, the which also dyed there: long after there did rise a swelling at her Nauell, the which was opened, and yeelded corrupt matter. I was called, and did looke to her long, yet could I not strengthen it, although I did apply strong attractiues, and manie bones came forth, one after another: the which did amaze me, knowing that there are no bones in the bellie: Making therefore a search of all, I found they were the little bones of a dead Child, so as after I had drawne forth many, I cured her, yet the Vlcer did alwayes sweat forth some-thing. ALEXANDER BENOIST a Physition of our time, in his practise, in the Treatie of the difficultie of Child-bearing, reportes the like History to that of ALEVCASIS.
            In the Suburbes of Sully vpon Loire, MARGVERITE PREVOST, wife to PETER DORET a Milner, being apparantly with Childe, and come to her time, not able to be deliuered, not-with-standing any helpe of her women, she grew by little and little so extreamely sicke, and

so great, by reason of the Childe and other things that were putrefied, that besides the generall swelling of all the bellie, about the eight or ninth moneth, shee had a particular swelling about her Nauell, seeming to be a soft Impostume, red and readie to breake, the which Maister ITIER GALLEMENT a Surgion did open with an actuall Corosiue, on New-yeares daie, in the yeare 1550. The next day at her second dressing, beeing desirous to knowe the reason of certaine haires which shewed them selues at the Orifice; I found that it was the head of a Childe rotting, which hee drew out at the opening, with the rest of the bodie, which was knowne to bee a female. Shee was soone cured, and after the death of the sayd DORET, shee married againe, and liued helth-fully 27. yeares after and then died of a flux in the yeare 1577. Shee had no Children neither before nor after. FR▪ ROVSSET in his Treatie of the Caesarien section.
            
            M. I. HOVLIER, in the ende of the first Tome of his Booke intitled. Of inward diseases, sayeth that a woman at Paris had a Child, who for fifteene daies before that it was borne, had an arme sticking out at her Nauell, and yet she remained aliue and so did the Child, she did not set downe howe shee was deliuered nor by what part, neither whether shee had any Childe afterwards, the which would haue deserued a relation; as well for the theorike as the practise. Without doubt it could not be without some great vlcer in the matrix, although the Childe were not afterwards drawne forth belowe. On the otherside it is a verie strange thing, that a Childe could be so liuely in that estate, hauing made such worke in the matrix, and in that which wrapt him in, the which hee had past through aboue with his arme: for otherwise

it could not be. In the same treatie. I haue learned of Mounsieur BVNOT, a learned Physition to the most famous Princes, ANTOINETTE of Bourbon Douager of Guise, that shee had often told him, that some time before her marriage, beeing twentie yeares of age, and yet bred vp vnder her Mother, she did see, (beeing in a Church at la Fere in Picardie) that they presented vnto her Mother a young sick creature, pale, weake, swelled, and so strangely tormented with paine, as they knew not what to say to it, nor what to hope of it. The Princesse hauing caused her to bee visited by certaine Midwiues, descouered what it was: that this greeuious sicke creature, whome they held to bee a very pure Virgin, had a Childe conceiued in her, and shee beeing great, it had beene long dead and rotten in her bodie, whereof not withstanding shee was soone cured, and liued very long after in good and perfect helth. In the same Treatie.
            
            BARBARA FHIRER remayning at Zupfring in the Bayle-wike of Bremgarten in Suisserland, beeing conceiued of her third Childe, and readie to bee deliuered, was in labour eight daies together with great greefe and paine, and not deliuered. In the ende, not able to endure anie more, shee remayned altogither in her bedde. then there appeered vnto her vpon her bellie, aboue the Nauell a bladder, of the bignesse of a hazell nut, the which had put her to exceeding great paine for three daies together, and in the ende at her instant request, it was peerced and opened by a certaine neighbour of hers, vsing an aule to that ende. The bladder being opened and growne large by reason of the swelling of the bellie, presently that which inclosed the

Childe appeered. They called IOHN BOVRGOIS a Surgion, who hauing consulted with the Midwiues, with their common consents, made such an incision with his rasor, as one of the Childes elboes came forth and shewed it selfe: the Surgion takes hold of it with pincers for the nonce, and drawes the Childe out whole by this breach, but dead and halfe rotten. The Mother hauing suffred no greater harme, then some light fayntings during the operation. The wound beeing cured, according to the precepts of Surgerie, so that within three-weekes shee was set on foote, not without great discommodity, for that shee was forced to vse a great rowle continually, and not able to stand vp but with meruelious great paine, so as after two yeares shee died.

            A Country woman being with Childe, and come to the 8. moneth, beeing vpon the waie to goe to the market at Sancerre, was cast by her horse and fell against a stone: of this fall she continued 24. houres without speaking or moouing. The next day she had a sharpe feuer accōpanied with very violent accidents, as ordynary faynting, vomyting and idlenesse of the braine. They did purge her, let her bloud, and applyed what they could to temper the heate of this great feauer. After a moneth shee had a swelling neeere vnto the Nauell, as bigge as ones fist. That beeing opened there came forth a great quantitie of corruption, and then prittie bigge peeces of rotten flesh, and in the ende the bones of the Infant which shee bare. Hauing had this wound ten monethes, in the end shee was cured, but yet shee continued barren. Some thinke that if shee had

beene helpt by a dissection in the bellie, the Child might haue beene saued. N. NAVRICE in the comment vpon the 1. booke of Hippocrates of womens diseases Text. 3.
            A fleming hauing her Childe dead in her bodie, could not be deliuered, so as it did rotte within her, notwithstanding any remedies that were applied to make her voide the peeces. In the ende she her selfe borrowed a Surgions instrument, called a Cranes Bill, with the which shee her selfe pulled out the bones of this Child being rotten. Then hauing eased herselfe by Lotions, Fomentations, Bathes, and other fit helpes, shee recouered her perfect health. R. SOLENANDRE in the 5. booke of his Councells.

            In the moneth of September, the yeare 1566. a Maide of SIMON RICHTERS, a Citizen of Misna, dwelling by Wolfgang Ber, let a little Boy (which shee held in her armes) fall from a very high window.

            In a Village hard by Cygne, a certaine Countri-woman willed a little boy shee had to go and fetch home their Oxen that were feeding by a woods side. Whilst the child was away, there fell so much Snowe, that vpon a suddaine all the wayes were couered, &amp; the night came on so fast, that the boy was enclosed in the mountaines, and could not get out. The father &amp; mother taking more care for their child then Oxen, rose betimes in the morning to go seeke him: but the snow was so great that they knew not where to looke him. The next day they traced the forrest to finde the body, which they were verily perswaded

was voide of life, but at last they found him sitting on a banke, which the Snowe had neither couered nor touched. They asked him, why he came not home all that while: The child answered (hauing felt no colde nor harme at all) that he staied till it was euening. Then they asked him whether hee had eaten any thing or no. A man that I knew not, said he, came hether &amp; gaue me Bread &amp; Cheese: wherat exceeding ioyfull, they carried him home. I.

            The yeare 1565. about the end of September, a maide in the towne of Misna, that was an Ideot, lead a little girle of three yeares old out of the Towne (vnperceiued of any) and hauing carryed her to a riuer called Trebisa, which was risen some-what high with raine that was falne, stripped the girle, &amp; tooke her vpon her shoulder, and waded ouer the riuer, then returned and made the child ready againe: but being weary of her carriage, she left the poore infant in the winde &amp; the raine, which was then very sharpe and bleake. The girle remained all the whole night, and halfe the next day on the bare ground, where she was found (as GOD would) by a Countrie wench, who tooke her vp in her armes, &amp; carried her to a farme there by.

            The yeare 1558. there fell such an horrible raine and tempest in Thuringe, that in an instant it ouer-threw diuers houses, and the torrent was so furious, that it carried away a great number of persons of all ages. Amongst the rest a vyolent inundation of waters ouerwhelmed a poore labourers house of Burcktonne, where his wife

lay newly deliuered of a Sonne, and swallowing vp the wretched Mother, carryed away the young infant, that a little before had beene laide in a Trough made like a kneeding-tub, which was stayed by the bough of an Apple-tree, where the childe remained, and was found safe and sound after the rage of the waters was alayed: euery one acknowledging the truth of this notable sentence: that GODS assistance doth appeare, when mans doth faile. PH. LONICER in the Theater of Examples, pag. 196. H. HVSANVS a Lawyer, describes in excellent Latin verse, such a like miracle, which happened about that time, in a certaine place of the same Countrie, on the behalfe of a little Childe lying in a Cradle, which was carryed away very farre by the furie of the waters, and then layde gently in a safe shore, where it was found aliue.
            ANDREVV MERCKTER recites in a certaine funerall Oration by him written, touching afflictions, that being a little boy, he had beene miraculously preserued from waters, &amp; from manifest danger of drowning three seuerall times: first at Sechouse, next at Wittenberg, and lastly at Perleberg, where this which ensueth hapned vnto him. As hee was standing on the bridge of that place which was very high, certaine Roysters, thronging along in great number and hast, pushed him ouer the bridge into the middest of the streame. It was in Winter, and the Ice couered him, so that carried from the top of the water vnder the Ice, hee was driuen to a Mill that stood in the riuer, where the water not being frosen, by reason of the continuall motion which the wheeles of the Mill made, he was taken vp and saued.

                  hen, hard by Friberg in Misna, a little Boy, sonne to a certaine Weauer, playing about the house fide, fell into a great channell of water that serued to driue a Mill, and was suddainly carried by the streame which ran very stiffe vnder his fathers house, standing ouer the channell, and then vnder a bridge, so farre that it was enough to haue drowned him a dosen times, without the protection of Heauen, which would haue the childe carried to the Mill, where he tooke hold with his little hands on the barre which serued to shutte the water-gate, and cryed out as lowd as he could. An old woman heard him, who ran thither, and called the Miller, so that the Boy was taken vp safe out of the furious waters. The same.
            
            In the yeare 1565. the 10. day of March, about seuen of the clock in the morning the Treasurer of Rofenbourg, a towne situate on the riuer Sala, going from the towne to the Castle, went (as of necessity he was to do) ouer the bridge, followed by a pritty little boy his sonne, who gazing on the swiftnes of the streame, &amp; going to take away some durt that stuck on his shooes, slid in such maner in an open slippery place of the bridge, that he fell into the bottom of the riuer. A fisher-man being in a garden not far of, hearing the noyse of his fall, ran thither, and with great danger of his life leaped in after the poore childe, whom the waues had carried all along the Castle walls. He tooke hold on a piece of his coate, which tearing, the body fell againe into the water, he caught him the secōd time by one of his feet, &amp; carried him to his mother, that almost dead with feare staid for him on the banke: within two houres after he came to himlsefe, &amp; two daies after that, was as well as euer hee was, to the no little ioy of

all his friends that praised GOD for his miraculous assistance. The same.
            
            On Easter eue the same yeare, about euening, a furious inundation of waters rushing on the towne of Islebe in Saxonie, did especially and as it were with an agreement made betweene the waters, beate vpon the house of an honest Citizen named BARTHOLMEVV VOGT. Incontinently the fore-part of the house, and a piece of the Stoue fell downe, within the Stoue was a little childe in a Cradle. The Father and Mother astonished with so suddaine a visitation, and hearing the noyse of the cradle tost with the waues, got out the childe, and carryed it to one MICHAEL FEARES a neighbor of theirs. There remained foure other children lying in an high chamber of the house. The Father more carefull for their liues then his owne, entred againe into present death, and hauing past many dangers, got into the Chamber &amp; tooke vp two of those children in his armes. Therevpon the floore sanke vnderneath his feete, so that he fell into the water, which carryed him to a great stacke of wood, whereon hee caught hold, and with much paine stayed himselfe by it some halfe an houre, loden with his two sonnes, and crying out for helpe. But no body could get to him by reason of the wonderfull furye of the raging waters. Seeing himselfe destitute of all humane assistance and as it were dispairing of his owne life &amp; his childrens, he humbly commended both himselfe and them to the mercy of GOD, calling the Prophet IONAS to mind, that was preserued amidst the seas, and in the belly of a Fish. As he was praying vnto the Lord, a great beame, driuen along by the waues, carried away one of his sonnes: another greater then that, comming vpon him with great

violence, made him let go the stake by the which he had held so long, &amp; whether he would or no caried him with his other sonne into a garden behind his house. Being there with their heads scarce aboue water, and remembring his other sonne, he began to call him: the child answered him from a beame, wheron the father espied him sitting astride. Thether he swam, and setting them both on his shoulders, he got to a great pile of wood, &amp; clammering vp on it, there rested himself with his two sonnes some fiue houres. The next morning betimes, the waters being falne, he carried them to Feures Stoue, where they began to come to themselues. As for the other two children lying a bed in the high chamber, the goodnesse of GOD preserued them after a meruailous manner. The Father because he could not go to them by the accustomed staires, got his neighbour to breake open a way through the wall that parted their houses, and entring into the chamber found them in their bed fast a sleepe, the diuine prouidence hauing with his hand held vp that part of the chamber, as it were in the ayre, all the rest of the house being ouer whelmed and carried away by the waters: assoone as euer he was returned againe through the wall with his children, the chamber and the bed fell presently downe. Thus were these fiue children miraculously preserued, contrary to all hope or expectation. The same.

brought to his table, &amp; hearing his father comming into the roome, he made it to be locked vp: but when his father was gone, hauing willed it to be brought in againe, the seruant found the dish full of Snakes: where-with hauing acquainted his Maister, hee would needs go and see what it was. And approching neere vnto them, one of the greatest of those Snakes leaped in his face, ioyning his mouth in such sorte to the mans, that he could neuer eate any meate after but the Snake had his part of it: and hee continued in that estate all the rest of his life.

Presently wherevpon he went to a Shoomakers shop, and bought him a new paire of shooes, leauing his old behind him, which the Shoomakers sonne threw vnder a bench. Two or three houres after, the fathers shop hauing bene opened by the commandement of the Magistrate, who had vnderstood that the neighbors had heard some great stirre in it, they found the two old folkes murthered, wherwith

the Sonne seemed to bee so exceeding grieued, that no man euer mistrusted him to bee the author of so execrable a deede. Nowe it fortuned that the shoomaker looking for som what els vnder his bench, found the old shoes which the young smith had left behinde him all be sprinkled with bloud. And it was also noted by others that the wretch had his purse better lined then it was wont to bee, which beeing reported to the Magistrate, hee was straight-way aapprehended.

Which being afterwards discouered and proued against him, hee was first of all laied starke naked on a bare planke, &amp; so drawne through the chiefest streetes of the towne, then hee had his flesh plucked away in foure principall places of his body with hot burning pincers, lastly hee had his bones broken, and was left so a liue on a cart wheele, where hauing languished in grieuous torments the space of nine houres, with great acknowledgement and detestation of his damnable fact, he gaue vp the ghost. GASPAR HEDIO in the 4. part of his Chronicles.
            
            On Sattarday the last sauing one of September 1565. it happened that IOHN GVY the Sonne of EME GVY, an Haberdasher of hattes and cappes in the Towne of Chastillon vpon Loire, being a very lewd &amp; vnruly youth,

stayed forth according to his custome, and came not home till it was very late in the night. Whereat his Father being much offended, told him that if he continued in those fashions, he should be constrained to turne him out of dores. Wherevnto the Sonne answered very sawcily, that it should not neede, for hee would goe of himselfe, and that forth-with if hee might haue his clothes. Therevpon the Father went to his Chamber, and being a bedde was faine to threaten his Sonne for to make him hold his peace, he was so lusty with his tongue. At length, seeing hee, but lost his labour, and not able any longer to endure his proud and sawcy answeres hee rose in an anger out of his bedde for to go and Chastice the arrogancie and disobedience of this vnruly youth: who seeing his Father comming to beate him, caught a sworde which hunge in his Chamber and rebelling against his Father ranne him quite through the bodie. Wherewithall he fell presently downe, crying out he was slaine. The neighbors flighted with his crie came running in, and found the poore Father, lying all along on the floore ready to giue vp the Ghost, as within a little while after he did: and his Sonne standing by him with the sword all bloudie in his hands: who notwithstanding that his Father mooued with compassion and forgetting his vnnaturall cruelty towards him had willed him to saue himselfe, and that his Mother had also perswaded him therevnto, yet had not the power to stirre a foote. So that apprehended and examined, at first he excused himselfe; saying that his Father ranne vpon the sword himselfe. But his excuses found friuolous, hee was condemned to haue his right hand cut of, then to haue his flesh plucked away in foure places of his body with burning pincers,

and finally to bee hanged by the feete on a gibbet, and there strangled with a stone of a hundreth and twentie pounds weight which should be tyed about his neck. All which (hauing confessed his fault) hee patiently endured, calling vpon GOD for mercy euen to the verie last gasp. In the Historie of our time.
            
            A friend of mine a man of a great spirit and worthie of credit, beeing one night at Naples with a kins-man of his, heard the voice of a man crying out for helpe in the streete. Whereat he arose, lighted a candle, and ranne out to see what it was, and comming into the streete hee sawe an horrible fantosme of a dreadfull and furious aspect, which would haue carried away a young youth, that cried out and struggled with him aswell as he could: but seeing him comming, hee ranne suddainely vnto him, and caught him fast about the middle, and after his feare was some-what past, hee beganne to call vpon GOD, whereat the fantosme vanished presently away. My friend carried this young man to his lodging, and after hee had comforted him, hee would haue sent him home: but hee could not get him to go by any meanes, for the youth was so frighted that hee shaked euery ioynt of him through the apprehension of so hideous an encounter. At last being some-what come to himselfe, hee confessed that till then hee had lead a very wicked life, that hee had beene a contemner of GOD, and disobedient to his Father and Mother, whom he had so intollerably misused that they had cursed him. Wherevpon hee went forth of dores and was presently encountred by that fiend. ALEXANDER of Alexandria, in the 4. booke of his geniall daies. Chap. 19.
            A young man borne at Gabies, not farre from Rome,
               
being of a wilde and vnruely nature, and verie lewdly giuen, hauing abused his Father diuers and sundry waies, got him in a rage out of dores, and went towardes Rome, entending to plot some newe villany there against his sayd Father. Vpon the way hee met the Diuell, in the likenesse of a desperate ruffian, with long haire, and ragged apparel, who comming to him, demanded the cause of his discontent. The young man answered that hee had beene at some wordes with his Father, and determined to be meete with him some way or other. Whervnto the Diuell replyed that such an inconuenient had befallen him, and therefore desired him they might keepe company togither, for to deuise some meanes to bee reuenged of the wrongs they had sustained. Night approching they went into an Inne, and lay togither in one bedde. But the wicked fiend, when the young man was a sleepe caught him by the throate, and had strangled him, if hee had not awaked and called to GOD for helpe. Wherevpon the Diuell vanished away, and in his departure so shaked the Chamber, that both the roofe and walles crackt in sunder. Whereat this young man was greeuiously terrified with such a soddaine spectacle, and almost dead with feare, repented him of his wicked life, and guided from thence forward by a better spirit, became an enemy to vice, past the rest of his life farre from the rumors of people, and serued for a good example to his neighbors.

            Children brought vp among Wolues.
            
               GOD repented that he had made man, saith MOYSES, Gen. 6. And Philosophers Bookes are full of complaints touching the malice of mans heart. PLATO in the 7. Booke of his lawes, saith, That a child is the wildest beast, the vnruliest and hardest to bee tamed of all other: and that it cannot be too neerely looked vnto. ARISTOTLE also in the first Bookes of his Politickes confirmes the same. Lyons, Beares, and other sauage beasts are vntractable: but yet not so much as children left to themselues, and destitute of good direction. It is reported, that a childe of a village in the Landgrauiat of Hesse, was lost through the rechlesnesse of his Father and Mother, who sought him a long time after, but could not finde him. This Village was full of Trees and Gardens, hard by a Forrests side wherein were a great number of Wolues. Certaine yeares after, there was perceiued among the Wolues which came into the Gardens to seeke their prey, a creature not altogether like a Wolfe, nor nothing so nimble as they: which seene many and sundry times with great meruaile, by the Country-folkes, and thinking it was a beast of some other kinde, they went and reported it to the Gouernor of the place, who there-with acquainted the Landgraue. He hauing commanded that it should be hunted, and by some way or other taken aliue: the Country-men vsed such meanes that they caught it, and lead it to the Landgraues Court, going on foure feete like a beast, and of a grim and terrible looke.

Beeing in the Princes hall, it went and hidde it vnder a bench, where it beganne to houle and crie like a Wolfe. But some lyniaments (though disfigured) of a humane face beeing discouered in it, the Prince commanded it to bee brought vp among men: vntill such time as it might bee more exactly knowne what it was. Those which had it in charge so diligently imployed themselues that the creature beganne to growe tame, to stand vpright, and to goe like other men, finally to speake distinctly: and then (as farre forth as euer his memory would permit him) hee declared that hee had liued in a Caue among Wolues, which vsed him verie gently, and alwaies gaue him the better parte of their prey. M. DRESSERVS, in his booke of newe and ancient discipline.
            
            Diuers French Gentlemen can testifie that they haue seene a man, which was taken in the forrest of Compiegne, and brought to the late King, CHARLES the 9. Who went vpon foure feete like a beast, and ranne swifter then anie horse. Hee could not stand vpright, had a verie hard skinne, was heary almost all ouer, and in stead of speech vsed a feare-full crie accompanied with so hiddeous a looke and countenance, that there is no beast so ill-fauored to see-to as that poore creature was, which had liued amongest the rauenous Wolues, and learned of them to howle. Moreouer with his teeth he strangled Dogges, &amp; dealt no better with men whensoeuer hee met them. I could neuer knowe what become of him afterward. EXTRACTED out of the Memorialls of our time.
            
            Touching the first History extracted out of DRESSERVS, I knowe not whither it bee the same, which is

presented by the D. PHILIP CAMERARIVS in his excellent Historicall meditations, Chap. 75.
            The repeticion being but short wil not be offensiue, I hope. It is a meruaylous thing (sayth he) if true, which is read in the additions to the History of LAMBERT of SCHAFNABOVRG▪ as followeth. The yeare 1544. a Child was taken in the Country of Hesse, who (as hee himselfe hath since declared and was so verified) being but three yeares olde was carried away &amp; brought vp by Wolues. When they got any prey, they alwaies brought the better parte of it to the Child which fed vpon it. In winter when it was cold, they scraped a hole, which they trimmed with grasse and leaues of trees, whereon they layed the Childe, and compassing him about, defended him from the iniury of the time: afterwards they made him goe vpon his handes and feete, and runne along with them whither soeuer they went, so that at length and through vse hee could leape and runne aswell as they. Being taken, he was taught by little and little to go onely vpon his feete. He oftentimes sayd, that if it had beene in his choice, hee would rather haue liued among Wolues, then men. Hee was brought to the Court of HENRY LANDGRAVE of Hesse for to be seene. In the same yeare befell the like case in the farme of Echtzel: for a Childe of twelue yeares olde, running amongest the Wolues in the Forrest adioyning, was taken in the winter time by certaine Gentlemen that hunted the Wolues.
         
         
            
            Children supposed or practised.
            
               THis Inuention hath beene found out by some barren women (some drawne therevnto of their owne motion, to please their husbands, and to bring an heire into the house vnder their charge, to the preiudice of the right heire: others (consenting to the Impostures of their owne husbands, pretending to aduance their estates by such Diuelish practises) haue stuft vp their bellies with cloth &amp; little cushions, but in such sort as they swelling should growe by degrees, counterfetting themselues to bee distasted, way-ward, melancholie and heauie: and at the end of 9. monethes to suppose some Child, brought secretly from the house of some poore neighbour, or for want of one, from the hospitall. Som-times bought for money, or supposed by the husbād, hauing had it of some Concubine. This is not all, for as some that haue beene barren haue vsed the meanes of such suppositions: so others haue made vse of it, when as they had a great desire to haue a Sonne, for the greater contentment of their husbands, they see that GOD had sent them a Daughter.
            It is well knowne that about fiftie yeares since, a Ladie of Daulphine seeing her selfe in disgrace with her husband, for that shee had brought him none but Daughters, forged such a tricke to giue him satisfaction; shee corrupted a woman of base condition in the beginning of this womans conception, and drewe

a promise from her to giue her her Childe presently vpon her deliuerie. After which practise, the Ladie hauing counterfetted all the signes of a woman with Childe, in the ende to plaie the last and chiefe part, as soone as euer shee herd that the poore woman was in labour, and that shee was deliuered of a Sonne, shee goes to her bedde, feyning to bee in the same paine, expecting the little Boy that was promised her. The which was done and brought her so secretly by certaine Midwiues, as it was receiued of the husband, as issued from his Wiues wombe: and so generally reputed. Wherein I will not ommit a notable example of the almightie GODS iust iudgement: for this Ladie, who could not bee induced by nature to beare any loue, nor to giue any countenance in the house to this Childe (although that by meanes of the sayd supposition, hee had beene left heire by him who thought himselfe to bee his Father) disdayning him daylie more and more, in the ende shee forced him to bandie himselfe against her, and to haue recourse vnto Iustice, challenging his rights as Sonne and heire, and offring to force her to an account, Ths which did so incense the sayd Ladie, as shee conspired his death: at the least it was supposed that the murther committed vpon him, was by her solliciting.

            A Childe of Stone.
            A Woman of the Towne of Sens in Bourgondie, called COLOMBE CHATRY, married to LEVVIS

CHARITE a Taylor, hauing liued long with him without any children, in the end shee conceiued: and during the time of her being great, she had all the accidents of a womā with child. But the time of lying in being come, all the endeuours of poore COLOMBE, and the helpe of Midwiues were in vaine, so as her fruit died, and she laye three whole yeares languishing in her bed. In the end being some-what eased, shee liued in paine 25. yeares more, carrying this dead fruite in her body, whereof in the end she dyed, hauing carryed it 28. whole yeares in her belly. Her Husband caused her to be opened, and the childe was found conuerted into a hard stone, then drawne out of her wombe, and kept for a great merueyle, as many haue seene it well fashioned, as if some excellent worke-man had cutte it in this Caue, hauing the members whole and proportionable, like vnto a childe of nine moneths old, being opened, they found the heart, the liuer, the braine, and other parts, very hard, but not like vnto the exterior parts. It is a female: the body is not subiect to rottennesse, nor to rust, no more then one of the hardest stones, which the best Statuaries can worke in. Maister IHON d' ALIBOVX, and SIMON of Prouuancheres, learned Physitions of our time, which haue seene this Childe of Stone, and haue had this wonder in their hands, haue written the History at large, and published an ample discourse thereon.
            I will adde here vnto an other memorable Historie, written by Maister IHON SCHENCK of Grasenberg, a Physition at Fribourg in Brisgart, from whom I haue drawne a great part of the reports of the wonderfull accidents of mans body; mentioned in his Collection

of the Histories of our times. CLAVDE of Saint MAVRICE, a famous Physition and professor at Dole, did write vnto Monsieur QVENZ, Senator and the chiefe Physition at Fribourg, that the 25. day of Ianuary 1595. causing a woman that was dead to bee opened, of the age of 37. yeares, they found her wombe to be of stone, waying seuen pounds, the Liuer with one onely griesly lumpe, the substance of which was round, the bladder of stone, the skinne that couers the bowels so hard, as the Surgions Razor could hardly enter it. These things (said he) did amaze vs much, how the spirits were carryed throughout all the body: and how it was possible for this woman to liue so long without some apparent disease. I caused this wombe of Stone to bee opened, hoping to finde some fruite of the same sort, like to that of the women of Sens in Bourgongne, but I found that it was onely stone within, as without.
         
         
            Of the Caesarien deliuery or Section.
            
               THE Caesarien deliuery is an extraction artificially made of the childe by the mothers side, who could not otherwise bee deliuered but by a sufficient incision, as well of that which is on the belly, or exterior part of the belly, as of the matricall body: without preiudicing not-with▪ standing, the life of the one or the other (so as there happens no other accident) or hindering the Mother from bearing of

more Children. The which is to bee vnderstood of the Childe that is aliue yet in the Mothers wombe. Vnder this also is comprehended an other like extraction of a Childe dead in the Mothers wombe, when as by some other helpe of the Mid-wife, Physition or Chiru
                  •…
               gion, that is more easie, more safe, and more common, there is no meanes to haue it, and that else they finde the Mother must dye with it: as it doth daylye happen in women of all sorts, after that they haue beene miserably broken.
            It is not long that I sufficiently discouered (by the report of certaine ancient graue men of Milly in Gastenois) that it is true, whereof they make no doubt in that place, that the wife of one named GODART, remaining then at Mesnill a Parish of Milly, had some certaine yeares before had sixe Children, after this manner, that is to saye: The Childe hauing beene drawne by an incision made in the Mothers side, and neuer other-wise, the Children still liuing. The workeman was NICHOLAS GVILLET a Barber at Milly, after whose death, for want of her accustomed helpe, this woman dyed, not being by any meanes able to bee deliuered as shee was in times past. A probable Argument that it was a deepe Physome, or a naturall straightnesse, capable to receiue the Instruments of generation or procreation, but not to deliuer forth the Childe. FRANCIS ROVSSET in his Treatie of the Caesarian deliuery.
            
            I haue vnderstood for certaine by Maister AMEROS le NOIR, a very expert Surgion of Pithuiers, and by GILLES le BRVN, that they together had at diuers times drawne by the side three liuing Children from a poore

woman neere to Merenuille in Beausse, and meaning to lead me to her, to see the place of the Incision, I vnderstood that shee was dead a little before of the plague, which was then very violent in that Countrie, I haue a learned Epistle of Mounsier ALIBOVS Physition of Sens, setting downe orderly and at large, how that IHON de MARAIS, a Chirurgion at La Chastre in Berry, sonne to LEVVIS de MARAIS, ordinary Chirurgion to the Arch▪ bishop of Sens, drew from his owne wiues side, a Sonne called SIMON de MARAIS, afterwards Chirurgion and Grome of the Chamber to the Queene Mother. After the which shee was brought in bedde againe well and orderly of a Daughter called RENEE. Of that SIMON (whome they surnamed without a Mother) and of ROSE GALLARDEL, came CLAVDE married to Maister FRANCIS ARTVS of Yssondun: &amp; FRANCIS married to OLIVER GARINER: both sufficient witnesses of their fathers birthe, as well by the common report, as by their fathers often telling▪

            Monsieur PELION a famous Phisition at Angers, hauing heretofore reported to Maister LAVRENCE COLLOT a Chirurgion of Paris, a like worke in Aniou, hath since confirmed it by a Letter which he gaue me, testifying that it was done by MATHVRIN DEBONAIRE Chirurgion.
            Maister DENIS ARMENANT a Physition at Gien, and my selfe haue seene a little before the troubles, in the Hospitall of Chastillon vpon Loire, a woman beeing sicke of a continuall feuer, hauing a great swelling on the left side of her belly, and therein a long Cicatrise, with apparant signes of needlesse points, remaining

of the opening of the said parts that were sowed vp, by the which both her selfe and her husband did witnesse that a while before there had beene a Sonne drawne, the which was some seuen yeares before we speake vnto them, and could not be borne otherwise. This was done in Bourgundy by an old Barber of the same Village, verie expert as they said in such operations. The woman did not conceiue nor beare any child after that time, although they were both yong. The same Author.
            
            BERNARDE ARNOVT the Wife of STEPHEN MASICAVLE of Nangeuille, betwixt Estampes, Puiseaux and Pithuires, after an extreame and fruitlesse labour of foure dayes, sending her husband vnto mee, despayring in a manner of all helpe, she had the heart (against the will of her said husband) to haue her bodye by my aduice opened, yea, shee did so hasten it, after that shee had heard my resolution, as she would not staie for Maister AMBROS LE NOIR aboue mentioned, whome I promised to send her, as a Man experienced in such operations, for that I could not be there present, beeing then very sicke: but she imployed the first she could find which was IOHN LVCAS, a yong Barber, remaining then at Bunou, a little Village thereby who performed this worke (which was new to him) very artificially, in the presence of many: some of them with himselfe, are yet liuing to witnesse this acte. This was on Easter-day 1556. The Incision began on the right side of the belly, a finger lower then the Nauill, and aboue foure fingers distant from it, and so descending directly vnto the priuy parts, without touching the Muscles on the right side, from the which it was distant aboue, about three fingers, and beneath some-what lesse.
            
               The incision beeing made with-out much bleeding, the wombe appeared plainely, the which hee also cut some-what largely, that the wound might be sufficient to drawe forth the child (beeing yet aliue) with his skin that wrapt him in the wombe more easilye. Then hee stitcth it vp after the vsuall manner of wounds, not the Matrix, but the Muscles and the skinne ouer the bowels with fiue stitches, as I did well obserue, going thether to visit her presently after my recouery. The which I haue oftentimes noted in her since, to cure a rupture which she hath had euer since, eyther for that it was not well stitcth vp, or for that she did rise so soone. And you must note, that this Barber was ignorant both of the Muscles and skinne that couereth the bowels. Proceeding in this action as if hee had launced an Impostume, or cut out some peece of flesh with a sharpe knife, as Maist. MAVRICE CORDE doth obserue in his Commentary vpon Hipocrates, treating of womens diseases, lib. 1. text 11. About a yeare and a halfe after, her husband beeing dead, and she married againe to PETER CHANCLOV, she conceiued, and was deliuered of a daughter naturally, liuing nowe at Nangeuille, where there are yet many witnesses of this strange Spectacle.

                GARDE, passing the 10. month after her conception, and carrying her fruite long in her bodye dead, the lower parts neuer opening to deliuer it forth, in the ende she sent for VINCENT VALLEAVA Surgion of Nemours, who hauing no other apparent meanes to helpe her, in the end of Ianuary hee cut her, in the

yeare 1542. not on the right side, but on the left, a litle higher then the womā of Nangeuille, first cutting the Abdomen or outward part of the belly, and then the Matrix, from whence he drew the dead child, swelled and stincking, with the skinne that wrapt him already rotten. Then without sowing the Matrix, by chance or catelesly, he gaue fiue stitches in the skinne, and some small part of the Muscles, as it appeared plainely long after, hauing nothing but a very skin cicatrized vpon her bely. Her lying in was but a month and a halfe. Two yeares after the which time she had a daughter naturally, and two yeares after that a son called PETER DE LA GARDE, afterwards a Smith by his profession. Shee became afterwards a Mid-wife at Vri seruing other women aud receiuing their children. The same.
            
            AGNES BOYER, wife to IOHN COMPAN a Laborer at Villereau nere vnto Neufuille in Beause, after shee had beene for the space of foure dayes broken with the importunity of Mid-wiues, and nothing eased, she was opened on the right side, by PHILIP MIGNEAV a Barber of Neufuille, in the yeare 1544, and then the Muscles and the skinne were grosly sticht vp, as hee could. Of which incision shee was soone cured: but the contusions which the Mid-wiues made in the priuy parts, troubled the Surgion aboue seuen months to cure them; shee had also a fayre Daughter, which liued healthfully aboue seuen moneths: but on the eyght shee fell sicke beeing at nurse in the same Village, whereof shee died. A while after shee grewe great and bigge againe, carrying the child hanging alwayes towards the rupture which remained as in others but without any paine.

But shee could not be deliuered no more then before, for one of the aboue named causes, as it is to be presumed. And therefore she did voluntarily desire to haue an incision made as before, the which shee could not obtaine (by any intreaty) of two yong Surgions sent thither expresly from Neuffuille, wheras they kept, after PHILIP, who died of the plague: which was the cause that both she and her fruite dyed pitifully together through theyr faintnesse, if the weakenesse of the Woman or some other pittifull accident, did not stay them from doing it. The same.
            
            In the yeare 1576, the 22, of Iuly at Ambedoye nere to S. Brisson, in the territorie of Gien, ANTO INETTE ANDRE, Wife to LEVVIS GARNIER a Handi-crafts man, was also opened by Maister ADAM AVBRY borne at Pithuiers, a Surgion remaining at Aubigny, who made the report vnto mee. Afterwardes hauing conceiued againe, shee was naturally deliuered of an other liue child. The same.
            
            And of latter dayes in the yeare 1578. the first of February, IONE MICHEL, borne at Argent, Wife to GEORGE RENAVLD, liuing in the sub-vrbes of Aubigny, hauing beene big with child aboue ten moneths, she carryed her fruite along time dead, not leauing notwithstanding to follow her businesse, till in the ende she was forced to betake her selfe to her bed, where after shee had beene long tormented in vaine by Mid-wiues, in the end she sent for the aboue named ADAM AVBRY and for WILLIAM COLLAS a learned Surgion, who hauing cut of the childs arme beeing al blacke and dead, which came forth long before by the Mothers nature, but not able to take hold of the rest of the body, they

made an incision on the right side, something bending and with a small Orifice, to spare the mother, which caused her to feele great paynes in the extraction of the child, for that the Matrix could not deliuer the child for the straitnesse of the ouerture, which paynes notwithstanding ceassed presently when as the child and that which followes were deliuered. So after the ordinary discharges of a woman in child-bed (which came as well as if she had bin naturally brought in bed) within a while after shee did rise, and had her termes accustomed at the ende of fiue weekes: and presently after shee conceiued againe in the ende of May, beeing somewhat troubled with the fresh remembrance of that was past, taking care what might happen of her beeing nowe with child; at which time she was deliuered naturally. And although the child did at the first present but one of the legges, (which was a bad beginning) yet the same beeing put backe by the Mid-wife, all succeeded happely. Since which time beeing with child againe, shee had a happy deliuery, and was afterwards very healthfull. The same.
            
            About the yeare 1582. IOHN IAOOT a Surgion dwelling in a Village neere to Auxerre, called Tirouaille meeting with Maister IOHN ALIBOVX a Phisition of Sens going to practise, desired him to turne a little out of his way, to a nere village called Marry, to ease a poore woman, from whom some fewe houres before hee had drawne a child by section of the Bellye, ALIBOVX amazed at the boldnes of this Surgion, called the Seigneor of Vaux Bailiffe of Auxerre and his wife to visite this woman lying in Child-bed, their Castle beeing neere the Village; they found the child in the cradle crying and calling for meate, but the poore Mother

(beeing opprest with payne, a Feauer and with watching) neither thought of her selfe nor of her little one.

               EOVX letter written the 20. of December. 1585,
            About the yeare 1550. ELIZABETH ALESPACHIN wife to IAMES NVFER, a Surgion remaining in a Village called Sigers in Suisserland, beeing great of her first child, at the time of her deliuery beeing prest with extreame paines she called many Mid-wiues and Surgions to helpe her, but all was in vaine. The husband seeing his wife in that extremity, tells her his minde in her care. She alloweth it, he goes to the Baylife of Frauvenfele, acquaints him with the estate of his family, and his resolution to ease his wife, and craues leaue to execute what hee had determined. In the ende the Bayliffe knowing his Industry, and the loue hee bare vnto his Wife, grants his request. Hee returnes speedily to his house, speakes to the Mid-wiues, exhortes the most couragious to assist him, and intreats the most fearefull to depart, least they should faint and trouble the company: for that hee did vndertake a thing which indeede was dangerous, but hee hoped for a happy issue, with the fauorable assistance of Almighty GOD. These women amazed at his resolution, went out all except two which remayned with the Surgions to assist the Patient. Her Husband hauing first called vpon GOD with an earnest prayer, and shutte the Stoue carefully hee takes his Wife and layes her vpon a Table, and with a sharpe Rasor makes an Incission in

her belly, so happily, as presently the Child was taken forth, without hurt to the Mother or to the little one. The Mid-wiues which did hearken at the doore, hearing the Child crye did knocke to enter but they forced them to stay, vntill the little one was clensed and drest, and the wound stitcht vp, the which was closed in few dayes, without any feauer or any troublesome accident to the mother, who afterwardes had two Sonnes at a burthen, one of the which was called IOHN NVFVR, hee liued in the yeare 1583. threescore yeares olde, Prouost of Sigers-Hausem. Shee was brought in bedde afterwards of foure other Children. As for the Sonne which was cut out of her belly he liued vnto the yeare 1577. They do yet at this day in those Quarters see the children of this Woman vnto the third and fourth generation. GASPAR. BAV

               IN a learned Phisition at Basill, in his histories of the Caesarian deliuery.
            
            I did thinke to finde in other histories which I haue among my papers, that which I promised you of a Caesarian deliuery, but it is among my other remembrances at my house in France, I will cause it to bee brought to Montbelliard, where I nowe am, to send it vnto you. I remember the Name of the place and of the Surgion, and the yeare and month when it happened: but I haue forgotten the names both of the Father and Mother. The Village is in the Duchye of Bourgundy, called Marsillie, neere vnto Mont S. Iohn. The Surgion, ANTONIE ROBIN, borne at Beaune and liuing at Renele Duke, a man verye expert in his profession. It was in Aprill in the yeare of our Lord GOD 1582.

The Woman being yong and strong, had beene in sore trauell two whole dayes together, and yet did couragiously endure an incision, the which succeeded happily. The Child liued not long. The mother recouered, and continued long after, The same.
            
         
         
            Seditious Commotions, caused by Exactions.
            
               IN the yeare 1548. the Commons of Guyenne, Santonge, and Angoulemois fell into a rebellion by reason of the extorsions of the Customers and Farmers of Salt; In a fewe weekes they grew to the number of fortye thousand men, armed with clubbes and staues, ioyning with the Ilanders. By a generall consent they ran vpon the Customers and Farmers of salt (although the King of Nauarre sought to appease them) executing their deseigne with extreame furye against all that they could take: The Commons of Gascoigne rise in diuers places (the killing of certaine Officers of the Kings that had abused their places being the cause.) The Maior, Iurates and others that bare office in Bourdeaux, and the Lord of Monneins (in place of the Kings Lieutenant there) insteed of remedying these tumults at the beginning temporised to much, especially the L. of Monneins, for that he gaue way to the insolence of one of the cheefe of these Rebells called La VERGNE, who grewe so bold that shortly after hee raised all the common people by the Tocsaine, (or larum bell) Beeing shut vp in the Castle of Ha, now &amp; then he sent forth certaine Harguebuziers to

make the people affraide. But this deuise tooke not effect for such issuings did so heate the Cittizens that hauing found la VERGNE, ESTONNAC, MAQVANAN and others (men according to their desire) they presently to armes, the Customers or Exactors beeing they they sought for, vnder which collour (pretending they sought for the Exactors) many honorable houses were spoiled: vpon this the Commons being receiued into the Towne they rung the Alarum Bell, no man daring to bee seene but armed and in company of some of these rebelles, for otherwise they kild all they met. The Counsellers of the Court of Parliament were constrained to leaue their Gownes, and betake them to their Dublet and hose, and Capt after the fashion of Marriners to carry a pike and march amongest the rude multitude. They constrained the Lords of Saulx brethren, the one Captaine of the Towne the other of the Castle called Trompette to bee chiefe and assist at the spoile of certaine of their fellowe Cittizens &amp; friends houses, massacring thē before their faces. The Towne-house furnished with an innumerable quantity of armes was spoiled. MONEINS Lieutenant for the King verie vnaduisedly left his forte to come and make an oration to this inraged multitude, where hee was by them slaine, and the Carmelites in danger to haue their house spoiled for that they had buried him in their Church: shortly after these spoilers beeing charged beganne to retier and the Parliament began to take courage executing some of the principall of this commotion and amongest the rest La VERGNE who was drawne in peeces by foure horses. The King aduertised of this disorder writ to the Commons

assuring them with speede hee would prouide for their greeuance. Commanding them to cease their armes, by meanes whereof euery one retired. L' ESTONNAC was happely chaced out of the Castle called Trompette: During this, FRANCIS of Lorraine Earle of Aumale followed by foure thousand Suisses and the force of the French horse entred into Saintonges pacifying it without resistance or punnishment.

                  ie heigh Constable of France with all the forces of both armies ioyned togither in one, entred by an vnaccustommed way into Bourdeaux, and beeing possest of all without blowe stroken, tooke from the Citizens (by vertue of his commission) all there tittles, recordes and documents of their rightes and priuiledges: depriued them of all their honours, burnt all their priueleges, caused the Court Parliament to cease, disarmed all the Inhabitantes, tooke downe their Belles, depriued them of all their Immunities and Freedomes, constrayning the principalls of the Towne to the number of a hundred and fortie, to goe seeke the Bodie of the Lord of Monneins at the Carmelites, and to remooue it with mourning to Saint Andrewes, where it is Interred, hauing first with a wax Candle lighted in their handes asked mercie of almightie GOD, the King and Iustice, before the lodging of the Constable: L'ESTONNAC, the two Brothers of SAVLX, and others had their heads cut off; The Marshalles Prouost with a stronge troupe ranne through the Country of Burdelois, BAZADOIS and AGENOIS, executing them that had caused the larum Bell to bee rung. In the ende the two Colonells of the commons called

TAILEMAIGNE and GALAFFRE were taken, who were broken vpon the wheele, beeing first crowned with a Crowne of burning Iron, as a punnishment of the souerainty they had vsurpt: Certaine monethes after Burdeaux was established in her former estate, and after the leauying some summes of money the exactiōs that were cause of these troubles were abolished.

            Diuers remarkable commotions happened with in this hundred yeares in diuers parts of the world you shall read (GOD willing) in the following volumes; for this time wee present you with the precedent History as an essay of the rest.
         
         
            Prodigious spirits.
            
               IT is not long since there died one CONSTANTIA who counterfeited most sorts of voices, some-times hee would singe like an Nightingale who cold not chant diuision better then hee, some-time brey like an Asse, some-times grumble and barke like three or foure Dogges fighting togither, counterfecting him that beeing bitten by the other went crying away; with a Combe in his mouth hee would counterfeit the winding of a Cornet; all these things hee did so excellent well as neither the Asse, nor the Dogges, nor the Man that winded the Cornet had any aduantage of him: I haue seene and spoken with such a one oftentimes at my owne house, but aboue all that which is most admirable is, that hee would speake somtimes

with a voice, as it were inclosed in his stomacke without opening his lippes or very little at all, in such manner as if hee were neere you and called, you would haue thought the voice had come from a farre, and so as diuers of my friends haue beene often deceiued by him. Maister PASQVIER in the fift booke of his Recherches of France.
            
            There is also there recited two other examples of prodigeous Spirits which I will adde to the other: The first is of one MOVLINET an ancient French Poet, who reports that hee hath seene a man that sunge both the note and ditty of a songe very readily at one time. The other is of a young man that came to Paris in the yeare 1445. Not aboue twentie yeares olde who knewe (these are the wordes of a Notary of that time.) all the seauen liberall Artes, by the Testimonie of all the learned Clerkes of the Vniuersitie of Paris, and could play on all kinde of Instrumentes, singe and sett better then any other; exceeding all in Paris and there abouts in painting and limming, a very expert Souldiar, playing with a two hand sworde so wonderfully as none might compare with him, for when hee perceiued his enemie comming hee would leape twentie or foure and twentie footes vpon him. Hee was also a Maister in Artes, a Doctor in Phisick, a Doctor of the Ciuill and Cannon Lawe, a Doctor in Diuinity: And for certaine hee hath disputed with vs of the Colledge of Nauar, beeing fiftie in number of the best Schollers in Paris, and with more then three thousand other Schollers, to all which questions asked him hee hath answered so boldly, as it is a wonder for them that haue not seene him to beleeue it. Hee spake Latin, Greeke, Hebrewe,

Caldey, Arabique, and many other tongues. Hee was a Knight at armes; and verily if it were possible for a man to liue an hundreth yeares, without eating, drinking, or sleeping, and continually studying, yet should he not attaine to that knowledge that he had done, certainlie it was a great astonishment to vs, for hee knew more then in humaine reason might be comprehended. Hee vnderstood the foure Doctors of the Church, and to conclude, not to bee parareld in the world for wisedome. Behold then this prodigious spirit with some others that we haue seene in our Time, amongst whom was IOHN PICVS, and IOHN FRANCIS PICVS his Nephew, Princes of Mirandola. IVLIVS CAESAR SCALIGER, and others for the most part dead, &amp; some other yet liuing, whom I will forbeare to name.
         
         
            Sparkles of Fire.
            
               IT hath happened in my time to a Carmelite Friar, that alwayes, and as oft as hee put back his hood, one might see certaine sparkles of fire come from the haire of his head, which continued in him for the space of thirteene yeares together.
            Madam of Caumont if she combed her haire in the darke, seemed to cast forth certaine sparkles of fire from her head: SCALIGER in his excersitations against CARDAN.
            It happened vpon a time to a certaine Preacher in Spaine, that from the crowne of his head, downe to his shoulders, one might see a flame of fire issue, which

was held for a great miracle. HERMOLAVS BAREARVS, in the fourth Booke of his Phisickes. Chap. 5.
         
         
            Fantastiques.
            
               THere are some Nations, that when they are eating, they couer themselues. I know a Lady (yea one of the greatest) who is of opinion, that to chew is an vnseemly thing, which much impaireth their grace and beautie, and therefore by her will she neuer comes abroad with an appetite. And a man that cannot endure one should see him eate, and shunneth all company, more when he filleth then when he emptieth. In the Turkish Empire there are many, who to excell the rest, will not be seene when they are a feeding, and who make but one meale in a weeke; who mangle their faces, and cutt their limmes: and who neuer speake to any body; who thinke to honour their nature, by disnaturing themselues. O fanaticall people! that prize them selues by their contempt, &amp; mend by their empayring; what monstrous beast is this that makes himselfe a horror to himselfe? whom his delights displease, who tyes himselfe vnto misfortune. MONTAIGNE in his third booke of Essayes. Chap. 5.
            I cannot keepe any Register of my actions; Fortune hath set them so lowe: I keepe them in my fantasie: I haue seene a Gentleman, that did not communicate his life but by the operation of his belly. One might see by him at his rising a roe of close stooles, to serue for seuen or eight dayes. The same MONTAIGNE.
         
         
            
            Women that haue become Men.
            
               IN a place called Esquirie, nine leagues from Coymbra in Portugall, dwelt a Knight, the Father of a Damsell called MARY PACHECO, who being come to the age that Maidens are accustomed to haue their Flowers, insteed of them issued a virill member, which had laine hidden within vntill then, so as of a woman she became a man, went apparreld like a man, changing name aswell as Sex, and was called EMANVEL PACHECO. This new man went into the East Indies, and returned very rich with the reputation of a braue Caualiero, marrying afterwards a Noble Dame.
            That which I haue read in HYPOCRATES in his sixt Booke of the popular diseases of PITHVLIA the wife of PYTHEVS, (and in PLYNIE 7. Booke. 4. Chap.) hath imbouldned mee to set before you a History that I would neuer tell any body of, thinking it had beene a tale made for pleasure. A friend of mine (of good authority, and worthy of beleefe) hath told me, that in a certaine place of Spaine, a young woman being married to a poore labourer, entred into some difference with him, eyther through iealousie, or some other cause. This diuision grew so hotte, that the wife finding one night the clothes of a young man that lay there, apparrelled her selfe in them, and away shee went to gette her liuing as a man. In this case, whether it were the powerfull working of Nature in her, or the burning and excessiue imagination, shee had to see her selfe so well and orderly fitted like a man, was the cause of this effect,

but she became a man and married another wife, keeping it secret, vntill it chanced that a certaine man that before had knowne her, comming to the place where shee was, and comparing the resemblance of this man with the woman he had knowne before: Hee said vnto her; Am not I your brother? Then this woman made man, putting her trust in him, discouered vnto him what had happened, praying him to keepe it secret.
            IOVIANVS PONTANVS writes of a woman of Gaiette in the kingdome of Naples, who after that shee had liued forty yeares married to a poore Fisher-man, was changed into a man, who because he was mockt with it, entred into a Monastery of Monkes (where he reports to haue knowne him) and dying, he was buried at Rome, in the Church of our Lady called Minerua: Hee addes moreouer, that another called AEMELY, hauing beene married to one called ANTHONY SPENSE for the space of 12 yeares, was in the end changed into a man, &amp; married a wife, hauing first by the commandement of FERDINAND King of Scicilia, restored her dowry. In our time there hath beene one seene at Bruxels in Brabant called PETER, that before was called ELIZABETH, for that before she had beene a woman. The French forces passing at Vitry, I saw a mā, whom the Bishop of Soysons at confirmation called GERMAINE, whom all the Inhabitants had knowne to haue bin a woman for 22. yeares space, &amp; was called MARY; making (saith he) some extraordinary leape, the virill members came forth: &amp; there is yet a Song in vse among the Maidens of that place, that warneth them that they make no extraordinarie leapes, least they become boyes, as MARY GERMAINE did: MONTAIGNE in the first booke of his Essayes.
            
         
         
            
            Bodily strength.
            
               THere hath beene in our time, in the kingdome of Galitia one called, the Marshall PETER PARDO of Ribabadineira, who was at deadly enmity with a certaine Bishop, the reason could not be knowne, yet at the mediation of certaine friends, who sought to take vp the matter, and make them friends, hee consented to an enter-view: As they drew neere together, this Marshall feigning that he had forgot all that was past, and that he would be friends with the Bishop hereafter, ranne to imbrace him: But it was a deadly imbrace to the Bishop, for it was so rude locking him so fast in his armes, as hee brused his sides, crusht his Heart and Intrailes, so as hee left him dead in the place: I haue seene a man in the Towne of Ast, who in the presence of the Marquis of P
                     •…
                  scara handed a Piller of Marble three foote long, and one foote in Diameter, the which he cast high into the ayre, then receiued it againe in his armes, then lasht it vp againe, sometime after one fashion, some time after another, as easilye as if he had beene playing with a Ball, or some such little thing. Hee brought from the Shambles certaine Oxe feete newly cut off, set a Knife vpon one of them, and with a blow of his fist cut it a crosse in two pecces: he tooke another Oxe-foote, and brake it against his fore-head, as if it had beene against a peece of Marble, without hurting him-selfe at all. In my presence he tooke another, and with his fist broke it into diuerse small

peeces. There was at Mantoa one named RODAMAS, a man of a little stature, but so strong, as hee wreathed and broke with his hands a Horse-shooe, and a Cable as big as a mans arme, as easily as if they had beene small twine threds: mounted vpon a great horse, and leading another by the bridle, hee would runne a full Carire, and stop in middest of his course, or when it liked him best. SIMON MAIOLVS an Italian Bishop, in his Canicular dayes. Col. 4.
            In the yeare 1582. in the months of May and Iune, at a solemne feast of the circumcision of MAHVMETT, the sonne of AMVRATH Emperor of the Turkes, was seene amongst many other actiue men, one among the rest most memorable: a lusty man, and wonderfull strong, worthy to bee compared with that most famous MILO of Crotonne, who for proofe of his prodigious strength, lifted vp a peece of wood that twelue men had much a doe to raise from the earth, which he tooke and put vpon his shoulders, where hee caried it without any helpe of his hands: and afterwards lying downe flat, his shoulder and his thigh tyed together, he bore vpon his brest a great &amp; waighty stone, that ten men had rowled thether, making but a iest of it. And which is a thing yet more wonderfull, foure men stood leaping with long peeces of wood vpon his belly: Besides this hee brake with his teeth and hands a Horse-shoe, with such force, that one part remained betweene his teeth, and the rest in two peeces, in either hand one. At the third blow with his fist, he brake a Plow-share: hee lickt the Plow-share with his tongue, being taken red hotte out of the fire: he was couered with a great pile of stones, but he neuer sturd one iot, but remained firme and inuiolable, as if he

had beene planted there. The same man, with his teeth onely, sadled, bridled, and harnest a Horse, with many other wonders, which got him much money, and praise of all, by reason of his extraordinary force. GEORGE LEBELSKI a Polander, in his Description of things done at Constantinople, at the Circumsition of the Sonne of AMVRATH, 1582.
            Amongst the Germaines of our time, there are two recorded for strength: GEORGE Baron of Fronsberg, and IOHN Baron of Schuartzbourg: they easily broke horsshooes with their hands: Fronsperg neuer found man so strong, but he would remooue him out of his place with the little finger of his right hand, he would stay a Horse (how strong so euer) in his swiftest course with one hand. And would remooue with his shoulder a Cannon whether hee list: Schuartzbourg would wreath Horseshooes, as if hee had beene some plyable substance. POTOCOVA, Captaine of the Casiques of Poland (beheaded by the commandement of the late King STERVEN) would breake Horse-shooes, as easily as a man would teare a peece of Paper.
            GEORGE le FEVRE (a learned Germaine) writes, that in his time, in the yeare 1529. liued at Misnia in Thuringe, one called NICHOLAS KLVNHER, Prouost of the great Church, that was so strong, as without Cable or Pully, or any other helpe, hee fetcht vp out of a Cellar a Pipe of Wine, caried it out of doores, and laid it vpon a Cart. A Chanoin of the same Church called ERNEST, of the house of the Earles of Mansfelt, a strong and tall man, would needs one day wrestle with him: NICOLAS tooke him vp and lifted him into the ayre, and afterwards cast him against a doore, with such force,

that he broke it, not-with-standing that it was fast lockt.
            King CHARLES the ninth taking pleasure in exercises of the body, being at Blois, caused a Breton (a man of little stature, but well set) to be sent for to the Court, to wrestle body to body against all comers, many both great and small tryed their strength with him, but hee foyld them all, casting one ouer his head, another into the ayre, with his heeles vpwards, some a if they had bin Fethers, others like little stones he cast into the ayre, and so against the ground, it being vnpossible for any to cast him to the ground: Some-times he would lye flatt vpon the ground, but who so-euer came neere him, was forced to make one leape or other, to the great contentment of the beholders. To conclude, another braue wrestler, would needes buckle with him, but in the end the Breton hauing his aduersary vpon his knee, first lift him vp into the ayre, and afterwards lockt him so fast in his armes, as hee crusht him sore: and to end his conquest, he cast him with such violence against the earth, as he was lifted vp, and caried halfe dead to his lodging, whereof he dyed shortly after.

            Thunder and Lightning.
            
               IN the yeare 1562, beeing in Champatgne, and passing by a little Village called Villeneufe, not farre off from Sens the Arch-bishopricke: certaine Gentlemen and honourable personages, tolde mee a strange chance that happened to two young Priests by Thunder, who in Haruest time

comming from singing of masse for a ritch man dead, after dinner retiring themselues, were incountred with a torment of the aire accompanied with thunder and strange lightning. These two young men, recouering a little wood sat them downe togither vnder the Trees: But they were kild by thunder, where the next day after dilligent search for them, their kins-folkes found them. They thought at first they had but slept, but it proued a perpetuall sleepe: stripping and searching them they could finde neither hurt nor marke on their bodies but either of their hatts a little singed and in the middest their was a spot of the bignesse of a Carolus which is about the breadth of a groate: Their poore bodies stunck so wonderfully that none could indure about them. M. D. BEAVLIEV in his treatise of thunder and lightning.
            
            About the yeare 1536. vpon a Sunday in summer was kept an excessiue and dissolute marriage in a village halfe a daies iorney from Poitiers the which hath but one streight and long streete. In this day and place about noone happened a strange and fearefull thunder, a Globe of fire of the greatnesse of a bowle fell in one of the corners of the Towne, and ranne along the streete without hurting any bodie, to Saint Georges Church, where it beeing entred it made a strange spoile taking away the Tombes of the dead, ranne to the grear Altar and spoiled a faire Image of our Ladie holding her little Childe in her armes, besides it tore away the pauement in diuers places of this Church, and brake a chaine of iron that held vp the Crucifix, cast it downe &amp; brake one arme of it; and afterwards grazing along the walles on the left hand, without hurting them that were tolling the bells, (more then for feare to runne away) it mounted

vp into the Steeple (a very faire building) the which it burnt in sutch sorte that all the Belles both great and smal were melted, the mettall falling vpon the pauement of the Church. The same.
            
            Traualing through Italie not farre from Eugubio, I sawe thunder light vpon two peasants, riding vpon Asses, killing both men and beastes vpon the place: they had a third man in their companie who had the bones of one of his armes so broken, as one could not see whether their were any bone at all, this blowe, caused such pittifull greefes in this poore man and did so torment him as he desired not to liue.
            I haue seene two men, (the Father and the Sonne) haue their bodies so amazed and deaded with thunder, that I thought verily they had beene falne into an Apoplexy: They remained seauen daies togither without eating, drinking, speaking or moouing: In the ende I caused them to bee let bloud, giuing them sharpe glisters, rubbing and norishing their bodies, so as in short time they recouered their former healths. Certaine months before the death of HIPOLITO of Este, Cardinall of Ferrara thunder fell vpon his Pallace and entred into my Chamber, light vpon one of my seruants swordes hanging at the bedde-side melted the point of it making a little bullet of it, and neither broke nor hurt the sheath: MVRETVS in his Annotations vpon the 31. Chap. of the 2. booke, of Senecas naturall questions.
            
            About the yeare 1560. Neere to Beneuida a Towne of Spaine, as two men walked togither in the open fildes, a strange tempest arose, to the great astonishment of them both, they seeking by flight to get some couert, and perceiuing the tempest to encrease cast themselues

flat to the ground; where they felt the tempest readie to lift them from the ground. In the ende one of them perceiuyng the noise to cease, lifted himselfe vp, the whirl-winde hauing much amazed him, those which perceiued him comming, &amp; the other lying still, went towards him, but him they found dead hauing his bones so broken, as one might haue writhed his armes &amp; legs like a gloue, all his Bodie seeming nothing but flesh: likewise his tongue was taken away and could not bee found, notwithstanding that they made dilligent search for it: Their were diuers Iudgements vpon this accident, one sayd hee was an ordinary swearer and blasphemer of the holie name of GOD, and therefore was perticularlie chasticed in that parte that had most dishonored his creator: By such a fore named whirl-winde a Towne of Spaine called Algadefie was wholie ruined, the houses and buildings beeing layd flat with the ground. The fiue and twenty of May 1566. about three a clocke in the afternoone, a clap fell vpon the Castle of Misnia, burnt a floore of a Chamber, melted kettles and Pannes spoiling all the Chambers, entring and going out at the windowes, then downe into the cellars to the great amazement of all, but hurt not any person: Three yeares after, the nineteeneth of Iulie the thunder hauing rored from eight a clocke in the morning till foure in the afternoone the boult about one a clock light vpon the Colledge Church of the Towne-house. Much Cattell, and some men were found dead in the ficildes: amongest other memorable accidents, the lightning ceized vpon a Country fellowe, who burnt all his Bodie ouer three daies after, and then died.

And so being couered with bloud he returned to his companions &amp; being askt how he came so, he came to his senses. And then remembring what he had done, he went againe to his house snatcht a knife and gaue himselfe a blow on the brest, and fell downe dead vpon the ground.

            IOACHIM the 2. of that name Elector of Brandebourg, had a peasant in his Court called Little MICHEL by ANTIPHRASIS, for he was eight foot high, which is a great stature of a man in our time, but little and small in comparison of great men in old time, namely of Goliath and others about Iudea. MATHEVV HORST in his collection of the combate betwixt DAVID and GOLIATH.
            I haue seene a young mayden of a Giant-like stature, whom they did carry from Towne to Towne, to shewe her as a prodigious thing for the sight of whome euery man gaue some thing, wherewith her Mother that conducted her and she were entertained. She was in a hired Chamber by her selfe, and there suffred her selfe to be seene with admiration. Going as others did, I inquired carefully of euery point, and did learne both from herselfe and her Mother (who was a woman of a meane stature) that the maidens Father was not tall, that in all their stocke, there was not any one that exceeded the height of other persones: that her Daughter vntill shee was twelue yeares olde was very little, but falling at the same time into a quarten ague, which had held her some monethes, comming to leaue her, shee beganne then to growe, all her members beeing proportionable to that height: so as when I did see her shee was about fiue and twenty yeares olde, neither could I note from the head vnto the sole of the foote any disproportion in any of her members: but a fit measure in euery one of them. At this age of 25. yeares, shee had not yet had her monethly

Termes: nature seeming to haue required and restrayned this excrementall bloud, for the norrishment and preseruation of so great a body. Shee was helth-full, ill faced, black, simple and grosse writted, and heauy of all her Body, for the vitall vertue infused at the beginning into this body, according vnto the measure due to the greatnesse of an ordinary person, dispersed afterwards into so great a Masse, could not with equall power shew the efficacie of his worke, as in a meane bodie: and experience doth shewe that vertue restrained shewes it selfe more vigorous then when it is two much dispersed, for the regard of naturall causes of this extraordinary greatnesse, by the meanes of the quarten ague; wee will leaue the decision vnto Physitions, and will not dispute with them: but in a word, if a person that is about the age of twelue or twentie yeares comes to growe through a sicknesse, so as in proportion of Bodie shee comes to bee twise as heigh as anie other, wee must confesse that this force of nature is extraordinarie and admirable.
            We haue drawne this Historie out of MARCELLVS DONATVS a learned Physition. Lib. 3. Chap. 14. Whereas he treats amply of the causes of the Giant-like height, as his profession did require.
            After the victorie which King LEVVIS the twelfth obtained at the Battaile of Lode, beeing gone to Milan, I found a young man in the hospitall, so great as hee could not stand right vp, hauing not suffycient norrishment of nature, for the thicknesse of his Bodie, and the proportion of his forces. Hee was therefore layd vpon two beddes, the one ioyned long waies vnto the other, the which hee did fill with his length.

            There was in our time in Bourdelois, a man of an vnmeasurable heigth and greatnesse, by reason whereof he was called the Giant of Bourdeaux. King FRANCIS amazed to see so long a body, commanded hee should be one of his Guarde. Hee was a peasant of a grose spirit, so as not able to applye himselfe to a Courtiers life, after some dayes, hee gaue ouer his Halbard, and returned to his Village. An honourable person who had seene him Archer of the Guarde, did assure mee, that hee was of such a heigth, as any other man of an ordinarie stature might goe right vp betwixt his legges, when hee did stride. I. CHASSAGNON in his Treatise of Giants. Chap. 6.
            In the yeare 1571 there was a Gyant seene at Paris, whome euery man did runne to see. Hee kept himselfe very close in an Inne, and no man could haue the sight of him, but in paying to see him. Entring into the Chamber where hee was kept, they did see with admiration, a man of a strange height, sitting in a Chaire: but their wondring increased when as they did see him rising from his Chaire, for then he toucht the plancher of the Chamber with his head, the which was very high, after the manner of the French floores. They sayd hee was a Polonian or a Transiluanian. This Gyant had a Wife of a wonderfull large body, and verye fatte with-all, but verye lowe in comparison of him: of

whom they had a young Sonne borne, who was in shew to proue one daie almost as tall as his Father. At the West-Indies (descouered some hundred yeares since) manie Giants haue beene seene, as they witnesse that haue written their Histories. Neere vnto the Antartike Pole, there are some found, of ten or twelue foote of height: as also in the Iland of Sumatra (or Taprobane) which is toward the East-Indies. The same Author.

IOSEPH ACOSTA in his Historie of the Indies, sayth that hee had seene one bigger, and the rest answerable vnto it. But for that it is to be presumed, that such teeth were of Men that had beene dead many ages before, we will not insist any more vpon them. In our time we haue seene among the Archers of the deceased King of Nauarre, a Biarnois of so tall a stature, as hee did equall his Maister being mounted vpon a great horse, so as he did exceede the tallest men in all the Country by the head &amp; the shoulders. Hee was a goodly man, actiue and pleasant. And contrarie-wise there was seene at Paris, one called the great Smithe, a man of an ill fashion, but exceeding tal, in comparison of many of meane stature.

               A Certaine Italian hauing had a quarrell with another, fell so grieuously sicke, as they did not hope for life of him. His enemie hearing thereof, came to his lodging, and inquires of his seruant, where his master was. The seruant answered him, hee is at the point of death, and will not escape this day. The other grumbling to himselfe, replied, he shall die by my hands: whereupon he enters into the sicke mans chamber, giues him certaine stabbes with his dagger, and then flies. They binde vp this poore sicke mans wounds, who by the meanes of so great a losse of blood, recouered his health. So hee recouered his health and life by his meanes who sought his death. R.

It is almost twentie yeares since I did lye in a bed: my feeding is Onions, hard Cheese, and such like delicates, my bed was vpon Strawe at the signe of the Starre, and couered with my clothes, that is to say, lying in them. The Physition suffred him to lye one night vpon the Strawe, and gaue him Onions, Salt, and colde water: holding it good to please him in this extremitie. But the next day he found his sicke man halfe cured, warming himselfe against the fire. We haue obserued (saith the same SOLINANDER) some sick men, who hauing ease in their torments, haue chewed and swallowed the receits written by their Physitions, and haue beene cared by that meanes. A certaine man hauing the Dropsie, and little looked vnto, by the benefit of nature, had an ouerture in his body vnder the pappe, betwixt the Peritoyne and the Muscles of the belly, by the which we drue aboue 200. bladders like vnto Hens Egges, the which were soft and full of stinking water.

Euery man knowes it, and many Monkes of his order haue assured mee for certaine, that hee was borne in a Village called Saint Tiso, and that comming into the worlde hee had all his Teeth, which hee had at the age of fiue and twentie yeares, and hath had euer since without changing them, or any falling out, and hee suckt a very little while. Comming out of his Mothers wombe, hee had his priuie partes

as hairie, as a man that is come to his perfect age, at seauen yeares olde: his chinne was couered with a beard, and at ten yeares he begot a sonne: hauing at that age all the naturall and vitall faculties, as perfect as a man at thirtie yeares, TORQVEMADO in the first iourney of his Hexameron.

            A horrible Iealousie.
            
               ABout the yeare 1517. a yong Cittizen of Modena, very rich and not married, called FRANCIS TOTTE, abandoning himselfe to the pleasures of the world, began to frequent the house of a Gentlewoman that was married, who was named CALORE, she kept open house, through her husbands suffrance, for dancing, playing at cardes &amp; dise, &amp; other entertaynments for all commers, from whome

she still drew some commoditie, being of her selfe alluring, and stately in apparrell, stuffe, feasts and all that belongs thereto. This young Modenois, who had good meanes, began to frequent this entrie to hell, and within a while was so drunke with the intising baites of this Curtizan, as he did not cease to pursue her in that sort, as from that time they concluded a mutuall and cordiall loue betwixt them. They liued in this estate about three yeares, that the Modenois did enioy, and was enioyed of this CALORE, to whom hee gaue his person and his goods, more freely then hee would haue done to a lawfull wife. Shee did handle him cunningly, but one day as shee plaied at Chesse with a certaine gentleman, it chanced that smiling, shee tooke this gamester by the hand, and griped it, like vnto a woman of her trade. FRANCISCO growes iealous at this countenance, and from that time seemed discontented. CALORE a licentious woman, and not accustomed to be restrained, began to contest and to braue him. In the end, disdaine growes thorough words, so as shee hauing told him that shee cared not for his humors, nor choller: this wretched man did shut himselfe into a chamber, where hauing made some notes containing a disposition of his goods, and that hee would not haue any one accused for his death, but himselfe, hee did put them in his shooes, in such sort as they must presently see them: then with his girdle and his garters he made a kind of halter, and leaping from a great coffer, he strangled himselfe presently. It was in the very house of CALORE, who afterwards liued more retired. At that time FRANCIS GVICHARDINE, an excellent Historian of our age, was Gouernor of Modena for the Pope.

               About the yeare 1528. there chanced at Rimini a towne in Romagnia, a notable Historie. A certaine yong gentle-woman, married to an old gentle-man, forgetting her honour, did prostitute her selfe villanously to a yong gentle-man of the place, caled PANDOLPHO, continuing their infamous course by the means of a chamber-maid that was their bawde, for the space of two yeares. There was in the chamber of this wretched woman, a great coffer, where shee did put some part of her iewels and money, in the which her adulterer did hide himselfe, if at any time hee were in danger to bee surprised, and could not escape. This coffer had a vent for aire in a secret place, so as PANDOLFO continued sometimes long there. It happened at the ende of this time, that GODS diuine iustice began to call this Adulteresse to an account, by a grieuous and incurable sickenes, who finding her selfe abandoned of the Physitions, was yet more in regard of her soule. Her husband comming about midnight vnlooked for, PANDOLFO casts himselfe into the coffer, shutting it easily of himselfe. Then this woman transported with some horrible spirit, began (after some speech) to make an humble request vnto her husband, making him to promise with an oath, that he should not refuse her. Which was, that he should put into her tomb in the caue, neere vnto her coffin, that coffer which shee shewed him, without looking himselfe, or suffering any one to looke into it, hauing certaine stuffe in it, which shee would not haue any one to vse after her. The which request the husband did graunt her. Miserable PANDOLFO vnderstood these terrible words, which made him to curse his owne wickednesse a thousand times, and his adulteresse withall, who within two

houres after died, without repentance or confession of her wicked sinnes, beeing desirous to drawe him with her vnto death, that had beene the companion of her wicked life.
            After her death, as they gaue order for her Interment, some seruants and kinsfolkes would haue him leaue this coffer in the house, or at the least, that they should open and visit it. But the husband holding the solemne promise made by him, hindered the opening thereof, and caused it to bee carried out shut, the which after the Obsequies were made, was let downe with the coffin into the Caue, and a great Tombe-stone laied vpon it without morter, for that it was now night, and that they meant to finish all the next day. Miserable PANDOLFO, hearing them sing in Saint Cataldes Church, made his account then to die in the coffer, and in tumbling vp and downe, he felt certaine bagges full of iewels, but hauing no minde of golde nor siluer, hee disposed himselfe to other thoughts, when as GOD would giue him newe respight, to haue a better care of his conscience and life than hee had formerly had.
            A young man of the house who knewe that the deceassed had good stuffe in the Coffer, and beeing couetous of such a booty found meanes to enter about ten or eleuen a clocke at night into Saint Cataldes Temple, whereas the Caue and Sepulcher of the deceassed was. With the help of two of his companions, he lifts vp the stone and beginnes to get open the Coffer, pretending to carry away a good prey. PANDOLFO (taking a sodaine resolution in so strange an accident) doth rise, and gets out of the coffer, with such a noise, as the rest

thinking it had beene some Diuell, fled away speedily. PANDOLFO being come to himselfe, lights a Torche, and visiting the Cofer, lodes himselfe with Iewels, and money which hee found there: and going out of the Church, past by the Couent gardens vnto his owne house. I leaue it to the Reader to iudge, if hee had not reason to thinke of GODS helpe, and to amend his life. Hist of Italie.

He was accustomed (whensoeuer they did present any women Children vnto him to be baptized, after that hee had administred Baptisme vnto them, in contempt of the feminine sexe, &amp; without any regard to the dignity of Christian soules) to say, that they should not carry them backe vnto the house, but cast them into the riuer.

SERVET was burnt aliue, and would neuer acknowledge IESVS CHRIST to bee the Son of the eternall GOD: VALENTIN was beheaded, the rest died mad and desperate, either slaine by their owne hands, or executed by Iustice, without abiuration or detestation of their detestable Impieties, the which wee must burie with the names of their Authors.
            About the yeare 1550. a certaine Companion, who had long made profession to mocke at all relligion, and at deuout persons, entred into a Church where there was a Sermon then made by the Minister of the place. This wretch doing contrarie to all those that were there present, beganne to gromble, and to shewe by diuers countenances that he was a profane man: to whom the Pastor (beeing attentiue to his preaching) spake not a word, but onely sigthed, praying vnto GOD, that this mocker might be suppressed: who seeing that the Preacher did not contest against him, but contemned his vnworthie behauiour, hee goes out of the Church, but presently a tile fell from the house vpon his head, and slue him vpon the place.

            Imagination.
            
               FERNELIVS, a very learned Physition of our time, derides their opinion that say, there are three distinct ventricles in the braine: one for the Imagination an other for the vnderstanding, and the third for the memorie: and he thinkes that these common functions of the spirit, namely the Imaginatiue, the Indicatiue and the memoratiue are cōfused in it, each of them working their operations by turnes accordingly, as each of vs doth bend the powers of his spirit either to the imagination, iudgement or memory. In fewe words hee meant to say that our spirit laboreth no where els but there whereas our heart is fixed. I will speake of it as a blinde man doth of colours: but if you permit me to comment this great personage: beleeue that if his opinion be not good, yet

is it assisted with three great pretexts: for if there bee three seperated ventricles in the braine there ought to bee as many distinct Celles in the imaginatiue, as there be diuers effects. Wee haue seene one TVLENVS full of learning and knowledge, who fayled in no part of his imagination, but onely in two points: that is to say in the loue of a great Princesse, which was deceased long before, and in the opinion that hee was Bishop of Cambray. In all other things full of Doctrine and sound iudgment. But as soone as he fell into one of these two points, you should haue seene him range quite beside himselfe. In such sorte that he was perswaded the first Gentlewoman hee met withall was shee for whom hee had endured so much. And before him, vnder the raigne of the great K. FRANCIS, we had one VILLEMANOCHE, who neuer erred in any function of his vnderstanding, but when hee entred into the hopes of his marriage: thinking there was no Princesse how great soeuer, but was in loue with him.

VIVES in the 3. book of the soule, speaking of the feare, proceeding frō too excessiue an imagination. An Apothecary, seruant to my late Father, told mee how hee had knowne a merchant of Tholouse a long time, that was sickely and subiect to the stone who had oftentimes neede of glisters, and had them diuerslie ordayned by all the Physitions,

according to the occurrence of his paine. When they were brought there was nothing ommitted of the accusomed forme: and many times he felt whether they were not too hot: then was hee layd along on his belly, and all other things performed, sauing there was no iniection made.

And if the Physition found not the operation sufficient, hee gaue him two or three more, after the same manner. My wittnesse swore, that to saue Charges (for he payd for them aswell as if he had taken them) this merchants wife hauing diuers times caused them to bee made of nothing but of warme water, the effect discouered the deceite, and because they found those vnprofitable, they were faine to haue recourse againe to the former.

            Not long agoe, a certaine woman thinking shee had swallowed a pinne in her meate, cryed and tormented herselfe, as hauing an intollerable paine in her throate, where she thought she felt it stick: but because no swelling nor alteration appeared on the out-side, a witty fellowe iudging that it was but fantasie &amp; opynion, taken frō some morcell that had pricked her throate in going downe, made her vomit, and priuily threwe a crooked pinne into that shee vomited. This woman thinking she had cast it vp, felt her selfe presently ridde of her paine. The same.

One of them inflamed with the regard of a certaine young gentlewoman, went leaping and dauncing home, where meeting his wife, all disfigured and masked as he was, he threwe her downe on a pallet, saying hee would make a little Diuell in her. By this approch the woman conceiued: but assone as shee was deliuered beganne to skip and daunce like one of these same painted Diuells.

            A learned Diuine declares in a certaine Commentary of his vpon Genesis, how hee had seene a woman, honest, faire &amp; chast, that was deliuered of a Bat. Which happened through one of the neighbors, that hauing caught a Bat tied a little bell about him, to the end he should fray away others. This woman with Childe meeting the Bat conceiued such feare, that her fruite receiued the whole forme of it, through a strange and exceeding vehement imagination. He relates also how he had seene a man wel stroken in years at Witteberg, who had a face like death: because his mother beeing with Childe of him, was affraid of a deaths head, and through her imagination had imprinted the forme of it in her Child.

            Wee haue seene a woman in the towne of Breslaw in Silesia, that beholding a Child newely borne without an hole in the fūdament, not long after was deliuered of the like. Likewise a Cuntry-woman with Child, who returning home alone frō the Citty, did eate a snake in steede of an eele, which her husband when he came home was so ill-aduised to tell her of, where at she conceiued such horror, that suddainly shee died of it.

The like is sayd of a Ieaster who being condemned only in shew to be beeheaded, for putting a great Prince his Maister in danger of his life, as things were in a readinesse for his executiō insteed of striking him with the axe, the hang man threw a bole of cold water on his neck: but cōming to vnbinde him, he found him starke dead, in such sort as if his head had beene cleane cut off frō his shoulders. The same. Not long since one of our Princes whose naturall beauty and liuely disposition the goute had very much impaired: suffered himselfe to bee so carried away by the report that went of the meruailous operations of a Priest, who with certaine words, healed all disseases, that he vndertooke a long iourney for to finde him out, &amp; by the powre of his apprehēsion so perswaded his leggs for certaine houres togither, that he drewe the seruice from thē, which they had forgot to do him a long time before. There was so much simplicity, &amp; so little art found afterward in the architect of such workes, that hee was thought vnworthy of any punishment.

            Notable Impostures.
            
               IN the towne of Artigules, part of the dioces of Rieux, and vnder the iurisdiction of the Parliament of Tholouse, it happened that one MARTIN GVERRE, hauing beene maried the space of ten or eleauen years to BERTRAND ROSLI, afterward vpon what discontent I knowe not betweene him and his Father, for-sooke his house, &amp; went and serued vnder the Emperor CHARES the fifth, and King PHILIP his Sonne, where he continued some dosen yeares, till at the taking of the towne of Saint Quintins he lost a legge.
            Now his wife hauing heard no tydings of him in eight yeares before, one named ARNOLD TYLLIER some call him ARNOLD of TILL) borne in the Country of FOIX, who as many thinke was brought vp in magick, tooke vpon him to play the person of MARTIN GVERRE, furthered therein, aswell with his long absence, as also that in the lineaments of his face hee some-what resembled him. Presenting himselfe vnto the woman, at the first shee would not acknowledge him for her hus-band: but besides the conformity of bodie, hee discouered so many secretts vnto her that had past betweene them two, especially in the night after their marriage, yea

euen to the very apparell hee had left behinde him in a Chest, at the time of his departure: Things which could not bee knowne but by the right husband: that at length not onely she, but the most part of his kins-folkes and friends acknowledged him for MARTIN GVERRE: &amp; in this opinion 4. years past without any contradiction. At the end whereof a soldier trauelling that way told that MARTIN GVERRE had lost a leg. Not long before this woman was entred into some suspition of her supposed husband: by means wherof she tooke wittnesse vnder hand before two Notaries of the soldiers report. Which to say truly, was but onely vpon heare-say: neuertheles it was the first foundation of this wretched TILLIERS misfortune. For as it is hard for a lier not to vary, so the woman gathered diuers speeches frō him, that made her to misdoubt him: and indeed solly cited by PETER GVERRE, MARTINS Vnckle, she not onely abandoned him, but sued him extraordinarily before the Seneschall of Rieux, where hee was condemned to death by sentence, from the which he appealed to the Parliament of Tholouse, which was infinitely trobled about the strangnesse of the case. For on the one side, TILLIER discouered all the particularities from point to point that had past betweene him &amp; BERTRAND before his going away, and the talke they had had the first night they lay togither. As also how after they had beene married some 7. or 8. years going into the Coūtry to one of their kins-folkes wedding, because they lacked roome, &amp; that therfore his wife was to lie with another womā, it was deuised betweene them, that when the rest were a sleepe, he shold come &amp; lie with his wife. likewise howe they had had a Child, naming the Priest that baptized it, &amp; the God-fathers that were 
                  〈◊〉
                to it at the Font:

all with such a resolution and boldnesse that the woman could not tel what to say: adding the motiues of his departure, &amp; the trauells he had sustained both in Spaine and France. Which perticularities were foūd afterward to be true, by the report of MARTIN GVERRE himselfe. That which makes this History more meruaylous, was that this supposed hus-band had neuer conuersed with the other. The presumptions that yet made for him were a double tooth, a naile growing into the flesh on the right hand, certaine moles, and a red spot in one eye, euen as MARTIN GVERRE had &amp; further in that he some-what resembled his sisters, who were so besotted, that they auouched him for their brother. On the other side that which made against him was that a soldier hauing called him ARNOLD by his name, hee praied him in his eare not to cal him so but MARTIN GVERRE. Besides the which she brought proofe of an Vnckle of his, who seeing him in the way of perdition, came lamenting vnto him, desiring him not to cast himself vtterly away. But these proofes were not sufficient to disannull the former, for to all obiections that were made against him, he answered confidently, laying all the cause &amp; plotting of his troble on PETER GVERRE his Vnckle, whō he had threatned a little before, to make him yeeld an account of the gardianship that he had sometimes had of him. And for to giue some collour to his saying, hee desired that his wife might bee sworne, to see whither shee would acknowledge him for her right husband or no: declaring that he would put his life or death vpon her oth. Which so amazed her that she would not accept it. These circumstances so mooued the Iudges that they cōmitted the Vnckle and the Niepce to seuerall prisons, to the end one should not prompt the

other. Thinking the woman was drawne to make this accusation by the Vnckle, who was in danger of his person.
            As the Iudges were in this suspence, it fortuned that the right MARTIN GVERRE came home; where at the first sight al his neighbors knew him, &amp; therewithall being aduertised of the pranke the other had playd him he went directly to Tholousa, where he made petitiō to be admitted as a party in the cause. Then were the Iudges more amazed then before: because that ARNOLD with an impudent boldnes maintained that this was a Cōnicatching knaue suborned by his aduersaries. In this difference, the Iudges, for to be assured of the truth, sent for the Vnckle out of prison, &amp; set MAR. GVERRE among a great many others apparelled in the same apparel as the counterfet was, to see whither he would know him or no: but presently he went and picked him out from the rest and with great tokens of ioy &amp; gladnesse welcomed him home. The like did BERTRAN, crauing pardon for the wrong she had vnwittingly done him. Neuertheles her husband not taking her words in good paiment, with a frouning countenāce began to accuse her. How is it possible (sayd hee) that thou shouldst lend consent to this abuse? for in mine Vnckle, &amp; sisters, there may be some excuse. But none in the priuity that is betweene the man &amp; his wife. And in this anger hee perseuered a long time, notwithstanding any perswasion could be vsed to the contrary. Which drewe the Iudges to thinke that it was a very pregnant presūption to approue him for the right husband. But yet that which held thē in some doubt, was that they of the court examyning MAR. GVERRE, whither euer he had receiued the Sacrament of Cōfirmation, he answered that he had, in the towne of Pamieres, &amp; named the time, the Bishop, his God-fathers and God-mothers. Whervnto ARNOLD

seperately made the like answere. Notwithstanding the which at last, by sentence in the month of September 1560. he was declared, attainted &amp; conuicted of the matter wherof he was was accused, and therfore condemned to do penance in his shirte with a torch in his hand, first in open Court, &amp; afterward before the dore of the chiefest Church in Artiguls, and lastly to be hanged, and then his body to bee burned til it were consumed to ashes. This Iudgement was giuen at Tholouse in the middest of September, and afterward executed: this wretched man hauing before he died acknowledged the truth of this history, which was written since and published by M. IOHN CORRAS, a great lawier, with certaine Commentaries for to adorne and beautifie it with points of Lawe. E. PASQVIER in the 5. booke, des Recherches de la France, Chap. 19.

                  •…
               VS, then Greeke reader at Paris, Impostor a Comedy of ARISTOPHANES, intituled the Waspes, where mention is made of Euricles a notable engastrinyth he affirmed in one of his publick lectures (where my 2. Sons THEODOR the Lawier and HENRY Doctor of Physick were present) that once in Paris he had seene such another impostor as EVRYCLES, who was called PETER the BRABANÇON. This fellow when he listed spake out of his belly, holding his mouth open, but neuer wagged his lippes: &amp; by such dexterity, or the working of the Diuil he connicatched diuers folkes. He fel in loue with a faire yong Parisian, whose Father was dead: and not able to induce the Mother to let him haue her. As they were in talke togither about it, hee began to send forth a voice out of his body, as if the deceased husband cōplained that he was tomented in Purgatory, because his widow did not giue her Daughter to Brabanson,
               
who had so often demanded her, &amp; was so honest a man. The woman terrified with such complaynts, and hauing compassion of her husband, consented to this Connicatchers desire, who togither with the maide sought also for a certaine great summe of money that was left her by her Fathers will, as it appeared shortly after. For within halfe a yeare after he was married to her, &amp; that hee had spēt all her portion, he left her with his Mother in law, &amp; ranne away to Lions. There hee learnt that a rich Banker died not long before, who in his life time had had a very bad name by reason of his vsurie and extortions. Wherevpon he went and found out this Bankers onely Son and heire, that was walking in a gallery fast by the Churchyard, and told him he was sent vnto him, to acquaint him with a matter of great importance which very much cō
               cerned him. There-withall as he was exhorting him, to haue more regard to his late Fathers credit and soule, then to his death, suddainly was heard a voice coūterfetting the Father, which BRABANÇON sent out of his belly, and in the meane time with a singular dexterity made as though he were wonderfully amazed at it. By this voice the Sonne was admonyshed of the estate wherevnto the Father was reduced by his wickednesse, and with what paine hee was tormented in the fire of purgatory, aswell for himselfe as for his Sonne whom hee had left heire of all his goods gotten with an euill conscience: declaring that hee could not bee deliuered, vnles his Sonne made dewe satisfaction, bestowing almes on those that were then in most neede of them: which were the Christians prisoners with the Turke: and that therefore he should rely on him that talked with him, who was sent to Constantinople by diuers other good folkes: and was also very

opportunely directed by GOD vnto him for the same effect. The Sonne, who was none of the wisest in the world, although hee suspected no deceite, yet not very well digesting this word of furnishing money, answered he would thinke vpon it, and appointed BRABANÇON to meete him againe the next day in the same place. In the meane while he was in a meruailous perplexity, mistrusting the place where hee had heard the voice, because it was close, &amp; fit for knauery. Wherfore the next day hee carried BRABANĈON into an open place, where was neither bush nor any other Couert. Notwithstanding talking togither the Son heard the old song with this new addission, that without any delay he should giue BRABANĈON 6000. franks &amp; should cause 3. Masses to be sung euery day for the saluation of his Fathers soule, who otherwise was damned for euer. The Son being conscionable, &amp; astonished, without any more deliberation (il-gotten goods hauing wings) deliuered the Impostor the sum of 200. pound neuer taking any receipt, or wittnesse of matters how they past: the father came no more to importune his Son, but remained quiet. As for the Son, after he had bid BRABANĈON adiew (&amp; got him out of Lyons with his prey) shewing himselfe some what merier then he had vsed to be, &amp; the other Bankers wondring at it, he told them the occasiō, whervpō they laughed him to skorn, for that he had so foolishly suffered himself, to be Connicatched, &amp; discouered the imposture vnto him: which so strock him to the heart that within a little after he died with griefe, &amp; went to his Father for to know the truth of the matter. I. WIER in his 2. booke of Witches, Chap. 14. In the raigne of King CHARLES the 9. a certaine fellow, got him to Geneua, naming himself IOHN ALLARD, beeing but little

knowne, because he liued by the trade of a gardiner. Hauing endured much, by reason of the small profit and great labor of so poore a vocation, he went after a while into Almaigne, finally into Sweath-land, where heevsed such means that he came to bee the Kings gardiner. By his deuises he aduanced himself by little &amp; little, so farre forth that he cūningly obtained to be agent for the King to the Seignory of Venice, where remayning, hee made a voiage to Milan visited the Duke of Sessa, who commanded there for the King of Spaine, &amp; played his part so wel, that the Duke lent him sum eight thousand Crownes. Not content with this purchase, hee labored to make another, and returning to Venice, he propounded a certaine sale of artillery vnto the Lords, and sung so sweete a note, that he drewe from them in way of a lone the summe of foureteene thousand Crownes. Herevpon he dislodged, for to returne (sayd hee vnto some of his friends) into Sweath-land. And passing by Milan he went to do his dutie to the Duke, and payd him his 8000. Crownes. Being at table in his lodging, and his head some-what intoxicated, he spake so rudely of the Pope and his Ceremonies, that he was arrested prisoner &amp; frō 
               Milan cōueied to Naples. Pope GREGORY the 13. vnderstanding that a prisoner qualifing himselfe Embassador for the King of Sweath-land, was in the hands of the Inquisition cōmanded him to be brought frō 
               Naples to Rome. Where being arriued he wold needes see &amp; heare him, whence sprung at length so great a familiarity betweene them, that the Pope promised him a certaine kins-womā of his to wife. Thē he set him at liberty, &amp; appointing him lodging gaue him leaue to visit his Mistres, who like-wise went often to see him: where-vpon ensued such priuitie

betweene them, that her belly beganne to swell: which was couered with a report of indisposition, that required the Signora should change the aire.
            ALLARD fore-seeing that he should be called in question for this pranke of his, practised in such sorte with an Englishman (seruant to a certaine French Cardinall soiouring for that time at Rome) that by his meanes he was carryed along the riuer of Tyber, and so escaped away; then he got him with all speede into Prouence, where beeing arriued at the Port of Antibo, hee went to the Baron of Alemagne, and there continued a certaine time with his Englishman. The Baron dispatched his hands of them, and sent them with two or three seruants of their retiniew to the Lords of Dediguieres in Daulphine. He desiring to do some seruice to the King of Nauarre, as also to auoide the charge that ALLARD and his put him to, aduertised the King, that beside the quality of Embassador, ALLARD maintayned he had assured meanes to come by fiue millions of gold and vpward.
            ALLARD beeing come beefore the King of Nauarre, and hauing presented him with letters from the Lord of Dediguieres, and confirmed the contents therof by word of mouth, he was reasonable wel accoūted of for a time. In the meane whyle the King of Nauarre going to Rochell, and ALLARD in his trayne, certaine shippes of Sweath land chanced to arriue in the Hauen at Rochell. The Capitaines, merchants and Maisters whereof hearing of ALLARD, with whom they had spoken, told some of their acquaintance that ALLARD was a Cōnicatching knaue which had seduced the king of Sweath-lād, &amp; with a companion of his a Gascoigne borne, was cause of the deuision that happened betweene the King of Sweathland
               
&amp; his brother: which had set al the realme on an vproare. The impostor perceiuing hee was discouered got him presently away with his followers to the late King HENRY the 3: &amp; to the Queene mother, vnto whom he declared at large what meanes hee had to serue them, by putting them in possession of those fiue millions of gold before mentioned, and a farre greater summe. As also how hauing beene very much vrged by the King of Nauarre, to shewe him the place where such great treasures lay, and the meanes to come by them, because hee would not be constrained so to do, he had retired him-selfe as it were euen out of the closet of the Court and seruice of the sayd King of Nauarre. The King and his Mother glad of such newes gaue good entertainmēt to ALLARD, whose comming being published in the Court, amongest many others he insinuated himselfe into the company of Monsieur de CLERVAN, &amp; gaue him to vnderstād that he had papers of great importance at Rome, which hee could not well come by but by meanes of the Suissers, who if they would but write vnto the Pope about them, he should be sure to haue them restored againe for their sakes. Wherfore he promised if they wold procure him those papers, to giue thē 60000. Dollers which the towne of Nuremberg ought him with the interest of it for twelues yeares, after 5. in the hundreth by the yeare, so that in all it amoū
               ted to the sum of 96. thousand Dollars. CLERVAN thervpon went to his Baronny of Coppet, where hauing taken order for certaine priuate affaires of his owne, he rode to Berne, some two daies iourney and an halfe from thence: there he acquainted diuers Lords of that Canton with the whole matter, desiring thē that they would take vpō them to write vnto the Pope for to haue those papers

againe, and draw that profit into their Cofers. They answered it was to be feared least ALLARD were some Cunnicatcher and that hauing accesse vnto the Queene Mother, who was greatly fauoured of the Pope, that loued not them, he needed not to employ any other but her in the matter. Or if ALLARD desired any other course, that he should repaire to the fiue small Cantons their allyes.
            Here-with CLERVAN returned to Coppet which was fast by Geneua, where hee talked with a great Merchant called IOHN TERNAVLT, about the matter, &amp; requested him to communicate it to Coronell PSIFFER of Lucerne: AMMAN LVCY of Vnderwald, and other Lords of the 5▪ Cantons, being at that instant in those quarters: which was executed, &amp; they harkned vnto it, reseruing the conclusion vntill such time as they bad conferred in person with ALLARD and CLERVAN, who being aduertised that these Switzer Lords were come into France (which was about Nouember and December 1582.) they went vnto them to Paris, where hauing made some entry into the matter, it was resolued they should meet at St. Iames his Hospitall to conclude this affaire. All was agreed, on condition that ALLARD should forth-with assigne ouer the lords of Nurembergs specialties, touching th

               ore said, amoūting to the sum of 96000. Dollors, whereof the Lords of the fiue Cantons should haue three fift parts, amounting to 57600. And CLERVAN &amp; TERNAVLT the rest equally deuided betwixt thē, which was 19200. Dollars to each of them. Besides ALLARD was to furnish 6500. Crownes in ready money, for the voyage to Rome, wherin TERNAVLT was to be emploied.
            In these agreements PSIFFER a man of 
                  •…
               ound iudgement, stood stiffe in his first opinion, that ALLARD was

a notorious Impostor. Neuertheles he so oiled his tōgue, hauing the French, Dutch, and Italian naturally, that in a new assembly with these Lords, he declared vnto thē after a demure and graue manner, as his custome was, that he was about to contract with the King, vnto whom hee was to lend 2. millions of gold▪ 15. daies after the agreement made; that is to say, 160000. crownes in ready money, and 400000 crownes to be raised on the late Lord Constables goods, whose Bill he said he had; &amp; had promised to deliuer it vnto the King; who was there withall well pleased, as ALLARD affirmed. Only he had stood vpon securitie for so notable a summe of money, &amp; that therefore the Councel promised to assure him the Salt ▪ pits of Brouage, and the reuene w
                  •…
               thereof▪ where with ALLARD said he was contented, onely he feared lest such assurance would be reuoked. Wherfore he intreated the Embassadors of the Canton of Lucern that they would deale in such sort with their Lords, that he might be receiued into the nūber of their Burgesses: offering in 
                  〈◊〉
                compence of such fauour, the summe of 20000. crownes to the Seignorie of Lucern, &amp; to each of those Embassadors 2500. crowns a piece. Therupon he posted to Lucerne, tooke his oath, &amp; returned into France with 12. Switzers for his guard: neuer furnishing a penny all this while, but l

There came a Rocheller also that warned diuers to beware of ALLARD, which moued TARNAVLT to write by a trusty messenger to Monsieur GARGOVILAR, the Mayor of Rochell, who returned answer that ALLARD was a notable deceiuer. The Suizter Embassadors hauing sworne the league with the King, left TERNAVLT in the Court for the expedition of certaine affaires they had there: going to take horse, ALLARD accompanied with honourable personages, participants in the businesse: promised them, that at TERNAVLTS departure he would send a couple of men along with him, with the 6500. crownes appointed for the voyage to Rome▪
                when TERNAVLT was ready to set forth on his iourney his men were not: but promised to be at Lyons assoone as hee: offring notwithstanding to deliuer him this summe of 6500. Crownes, if he would stand to the venture, which he refused to doesince ALLARD and his associates were to send after him.
            Not long after the Suitzers departure, the Pope aduertised of ALLARDS being in the Court of France, complained to the King of him, who committed him to prison, where hee found a certaine Gentleman naming himselfe the Earle of Sanssy, a man of a quick spirit, and father to three or foure sonnes, whereof one had beene brought vp with the Elector Palatine, as also to one Daughter, whom during this imprisonment he promised to one DV VAL by ALLARDS meanes, that said he was DV VALS Vnckle, and promised to giue him two hundreth thousand crownes to his marriage. But all this practise remained vnperfected, by reason of this which

ensueth. Within a while after was enlarged, whereupon he desired TERNAVLT by letters to come to him to Paris▪
                wherein TERNAVLT excused himselfe, certifying the other, that if he would come into Switzerland, Sau
                     •…
                  y, or to Lausanne, Geper, Morges, &amp; other places adioyning, TERNAVLT would meete him.
            Vpon these letters, ALLARD set forth, accompanied with two of the Earles sonnes, and his traine, and came into the countrey of Burg
                     •…
                  ngny, where he intruded himselfe into the acquaintaince of a gentleman of the countrey, whom with great promises hee carried along with him to Morges, and there lodged at the signe of the white Crosse. From thence he sent to Geneua for TERNAVLT, who beeing arriued, ALLARD would haue induced him to haue lent him a thousand crowns; adding that he desired that TERNAVLT would take the paines to goe into Sweathland, to receiue eighteene hundred thousand dollars for him, and he should haue an hundred thousand of them for his labour. And further, hee promised a very great gift to an honest gentleman, brother in law to the said TERNAVLT, who refusing to meddle in the matter, all contracts were broken off, except it were touching three thousand crownes, which ALLARD was to pay him out of hand: but they are yet to paie.
            This promiser renewed another practise with the Bay liffe of Lausanne and Morges, who conducted him to Berne, where hee contracted with certaine Lords, vnto whom (among other things) hee promised to deliuer an Obligation of the summe of fiue hundred thousand crownes to him due by EMANVEL PHILIBERT Duke of Sauoy, which Obligation he said hee had left at Paris. Departing from Berne with promise to be honoured and

recompenced, he drew towards Neuf-chastel. In the mean time his impostures were discouered on euery hand. It was known that the Duke of Sauoyes Obligation, was of the same nature as the Constables Bill, and that all the negotiation with the Embassadors of the small Cantons was but meere knauery on ALLARDS part. Therefore order was giuen that he should be attached at Neufchastel: where fearing it would not bee long ere he should haue terrible articles framed against him, and gathering by some questions which had bin asked him, that part of his impostures were discouered, his traine beeing vanished away euen in an instant, hee resolued with himselfe to inuent all the wayes possibly hee could to escape. But meeting with no certaine meane, one night going to let himselfe down at an high window of the prison, where he was inclosed, that which held him chancing to break, his fall was so high, that he dashed himselfe all to pieces, so giuing an end to his life and impostures both at once.
            The Burguignian gentleman whom hee had carried with him to Morges, was laid vp in prison and compelled to sell his land for to satisfie the Hoste of the white crosse for ALLARDS expences whilst he lay there. Infinit were the tricks where-with this M. GARDYNER cunnicatched all sorts of persons wheresoeuer he came. It shall suffice for a conclusion, to note the knauish pranke hee plaied the Host of the Stork at Basil, where he had lien a long time, and was deepely run in arrereages. When he was going away, in stead of paying, he borrowed a newe summe of money of this honest Switzer, and for a pawne left him a Portmanteau made faste with three lockes and strong chaines, affirming it was full of golde, iewels of exceeding value, and papers of great importance, promising if

it were well kept till his returne, to giue his said Hoste thirtie thousand Dollars besides his due. The newes of his death comming to Bafil, the poore Hoste in a maruelous pitteous taking, went with the leaue of the Magistrate, and got this Portmanteau to bee opened, which was found full of nothing but brickes and stones finely packed vp together. I had this Discourse from Monsieur TERNAVLT, in whose hands I haue seene diuers contracts, acts and writings, approouing some part of the History of this notable Impostor.
            
         
         
            Imprecations prophane and blasphemous speeches.
            
               WHen we would obtaine any thing that we greatly desire, we care not what we promise, and many in this case happen to make imprecations, either against themselues, or others, the fruit whereof, they oftentimes reape to their own destruction. Wee haue a notable example of it in CHARLES Duke of Burbon; who as it is recited by BELLAY in his 8. Booke, and FR. GVICHARD IN in his 17. Booke of the warres of Italie, labouring to draw some money from the Millanois for to pay his souldiers: and because he could not get so great a summe as hee required, by reason of the exceeding charge the Citie was at during the warre; hee promised them, that if they would but furnish him with so much money for that once, hee would neuer do them the least extortion in the world againe, if he did, he prared GOD that at the first skirmish or assault he were in, he might be shot through &amp; killed.

Or as GVICHARDIN saith, If the Citty of Millan would furnish him with thirty thousand Duckets for a moneths pay, that the armie should depart out of Milan, and lodge some other where: assuring them that though at other times they had beene deceiued with the like promises, they should not be so then, because he would neuer go against his word and faith, on which they might safely relie: adding, that he prayed GOD, if he brake his promise with them, his head might bee taken from his shoulders with the first shott of the enemies artillerie. Vpon this promise the Millanois strained themselues, and paide him the summe. But they were so oppressed afterward, that many through dispaire hung themselues, others threw themselues downe head-long from the tops of their houses, and brake their owne necks. Shortly wher-vpon, the Duke of Bourbon marched forth with his armie, and drew towards Rome for to surprise it, but hee was slaine with an Harguebuse shott in the assault, which many (saith BELLAY) attribute to the diuine vengeance, because hee kept not the promise which hee made with such an imprecation to the Millanois. His death

               ell on the 6. of May 1527.
            To this purpose I will adde another Historie, though it be ancient, reported by ALBERT CRANT in his 6. Booke of the affaires of Saxony, Chap. 45. where hee writes that the Emperor FREDERICK the first, being in Saint PETERS Monastery at Erford, the floore whereon hee went, suddenly sanke vnder him, and if he had not caught hold on an Yron barre of a window, hee had fallen into the Iakes of the Monasterie: wherein certaine Gentlemen fell and were drowned, amongst the which was HENRY Earle of Schuartzbourg, who carried the presage

of his death in an vsuall imprecation, If I do this or that: I would (said he) I might be drowned in the Iakes.
            But omitting other ancient Histories, it being no part of our purpose to touch them in these collections, but reseruing them for some other hand and worke. I will present the examples of our time, concerning imprecations and despightfull speaches eyther against GOD or our neighbours. A Soldiar trauelling through the Marquisate of Brandebourg, feeling him-selfe not well, staied in an Inne, &amp; gaue his 
                  〈◊〉
                his money to keepe. Not long after, being recouered, he asked it againe of the woman, who had agreed before with her husband to detaine it. Wherefore she denyed that she had any of him, and rayled at him, as if he had done her wrong to aske it: whereat the traueller was so enraged, that he accused her of disloyaltie and theft: which the Host hearing, he tooke his wiues part, and thrust the other out of dores, who iustly incensed with such dealing, drew his sworde and ranne against the gate. The Host began to crie out that hee went about to breake into his house and robbe him. For which cause the Souldier was apprehended, carryed to prison, and arraigned before the Magistrate, ready to be condemned to death. The day came wherein sentence was to bee giuen and executed, the Diuill entred into the prison, and tolde the prisoner that hee should bee condemned to dye: neuerthelesse he promised him if so bee hee would giue himselfe vnto him, to keepe him from all harme. The prisoner answered, that he would rather dye innocent as he was, then be deliuered by such means. The Diuil hauing shewed him againe the danger wherein hee stood, and receiuing the repulse, promised not-withstanding, to helpe him for

nothing, and worke in such sort that he should be reuenged on his enemies. Hee councelled him then when he should be brought to his tryall, to maintaine that hee was innocent: and to desire the Iudge to let him haue him for his aduocate, whom he should see standing there in a blew Cap, which should plead for him. The prisoner accepted the offer: and the next day being brought to the Barre; hearing his aduersaries accusation, and the Iudges opinion, required (according to the custome of the place) that he might haue an Aduocate to plead his cause: which was granted him. This craftye Lawyer stood forth, and very subtilly began to defend his client, alledging that hee was falselie accused, and by consequence wrongfully condemned: for the Hoste kept away his money, and had misused him besides: Therevpon hee vp and tolde how the whole matter had past, and declared the place where the money was locked vp. The Host on the other side defended himselfe, and the more impudently denyed it, giuing himselfe to the Diuill both body and soule, if so be he had it. Where-vpon this Lawyer in the blew Cappe, leauing his cause, layde hold on the Host, carried him out of the hall, and hoysted him vp so high in the ayre, that it was neuer knowne what became of him afterward. I. WIER in his 4. booke of Diuelish deuises, Chap. 20. PAVL EITZEN in the 6. Booke of his Morales, Chap. 18. saith, that this happened in the yeare 1541. and that this Souldier came out of Hungarie.
            
            In the Towne of Rutlingen, a certaine traueller comming into an Inne, gaue his Hoste a budget to keepe, wherein there was a great summe of money. At his departure asking it againe, the Hoste denyed hee had

any, and rayled at him for charging him with it. The traueller sued him in the lawe, and because there was no witnesse of the matter, hee was going to put the Host to his oath, who was ready and most desirous to take it, and gaue himselfe to the diuill, if euer he receiued or kept away the Budget that was in question. The plaintiffe required some respite, to take aduise whether hee should put the defender to his oth or no: and going out of the Court, he met two men, that asked him the occaston of his comming thither.
            He vp and told them the matter. Well (sayde they) wilt thou bee contented that we shall helpe thee in the cause. He answred them I, not knowing what they were. Ther-vpon they returned all three into the Court, where the two that came last, began to maintaine against the Hoste, that the Budget was deliuered vnto him, and that he receiued it, and locked it vp in such a place, which they named. The periured wretch could not tell what to reply: and as the Iudge was about to send him to prison, the two witnesses began to say, it shall not need, for wee are sent to punish his wickednesse. Saying so, they caught him vp into the ayre, where he vanished away with thē, and was neuer seene more. IOHN le GAST of Brisae, in the 2. volume of his Table-talke, pag. 131. GILBERT COVSIN of Nosereth, in his Narrations.
            
            PETER ALVARADO a Spanish Captaine, making warre on the Indians of Peru, receiued a grieuous hurt in a skirmish, whereof he dyed two dayes after. Lying in his death-bed, &amp; being asked where he felt his paine? In my soule (said he) it torments me: when the newes of his death came to his wife BEATRICE, a very proud woman, then resident at Guattimall, she began to rage, to make

imprecations, and to fall out with GOD, euen to say; That hee could not deale worse with her then to take away her husband. There-vpon shee hung all her house with black, and began to mourne in such sort that shee could not be drawne to receiue any sustenance or comfort. She did nothing but weepe, lye along on the ground teare her hayre, and demeane her-selfe like a madde woman. Amidst her husbands pompous obsequies (of whom GOMARA writes, that he maried two sisters and was a long time polluted with foule incest) and all this despightfull mourning, shee forgot not to assemble the chiefest of the towne together, and there to make them declare her for Gouernesse of the Country, and to sweare fealtie and obedience vnto her. But now let vs heere what came to passe vpon these imprecations and despightfull speeches. The 8. of September 1541. it rained so mightely for 24. houres together, that the next day about nine or ten of the clock at night, two Indians came, and aduertised the Bishop of Guattimall, how they had heard a meruailous strange noyse at the foote of the Mountaine adioyning to the Cittie. The Bishop sent them away, and told them it was nothing but illusions. But an houre after midnight, an inundation of waters began to rush out at the bottom of the mountaine and to disgorge it selfe on the plaine with such fury: that it caried away whole rocks of an incredible thicknesse. These waters rouling along, cast downe all that they encountred. Amidst the which nothing was heard but fearfull cries in the ayre: &amp; there were some that marked a black Cow amōg the waues, which went in &amp; out doing much mischiefe. The first house ouer-whelmed by this deluge was ALVARADOES, where perished BEATRICE his widdow,

with all such as accompanied her in an Oratory, where she was at her deuotions▪ Instantly after the Towne was buried in the waters. Some sixe score persons men and women were drowned. They which gott away at the beginning of the noyse escaped. When the waters were fallen, the Spaniards were found hauing their armes and legges all cut and mangled. I will adde this one worde, How a little girle which ALVARADO had begotten on an Indian, carryed away with the rest by the floud, was found a good way from the Towne, safe and vn-hurt in any part of her body. I. BENZO in his History of the new world, Booke. 2. Chap. 17.
            For to returne againe into Europe, it is not long agoe (saith Doct. PHILIP CAMERARIVS) that my brother called IOACHIM comming out of Hesse, tolde me this which ensueth. I sawe a Boy, said he, in the Landgraue WILLIAMS Court, that was both dumbe and deafe, but so witty, that I could not meruaile sufficiently at his dexteri
                  •…
               ie, to performe all that hee was willed to doe: for by the onely twinckling of an eye, hee vnderstood what-so-euer the Prince and others meant: the Landgraue seeing mee to wonder so at it, sayd vnto mee: See you this dumbe boy? all that euer happens eyther here in my Court, or in the Towne, if hee can come to haue neuer so little inckling of it, he presently acquaints mee very cunningly with it by his signes. But I will tell you further for a notable History of GODS iustice. His Mother accused of theft, seeing no other meane to escape had recourse to imprecations: and because she was then big with this child, for to adde more credit to her words, shee made this imprecation; That if the matter were true which shee was charged with, shee prayed GOD

that the Childe where-with-all shee went, might neuer speake, but continue dumbe as long as it liued. Her imprecations discouered her, hauing ioyned periurie to theft. PH. CAMERARIVS in the 86. Chap. of his Historicall meditations.
            
            Not long since it happened, that a certaine Gentleman our neighbour, vexing his poore tenants with imprecations and curses, constrained them to build his Castle. In driuing them to worke, he ordinarily called them his Dogges. Before the building was finished, hee fell sick: and continuing his imprecations and curses, GOD so repressed him, that he became speechlesse: and when I wrote this History, hee could not pronounce any one word distinctly, but barked like a Dog. The same.
            
            Another example no lesse memorable, happened not long agoe in a Princes Court here-by, where a certaine Gentleman being charged with many iniurious wordes spoken at randon: for to couer the matter, and to perswade that the accusation was false, hee began to protest and sweare: adding that he desired of GOD if hee had vsed any such speeches, to shew some token on him, euen at that very instant: or if GOD would not, that then the Diuill would. Presently vpon these words, and other such like imprecations, hee fell downe flatte on his face, being so grieuously taken with the falling siknesse (which hee had neuer felt before) that after hee had▪ tormented and beaten himselfe against the ground, where hee laye foming at the mouth like one halfe dead, he was carried to a Chamber, &amp; there continued very sick, in the yeare 1591. when I collected this Historie, being iustly punished for his rashnesse &amp; impious imprecation. The same.
            
            IOHN WIER, in his workes of the Diuels impostures,
               
recites a memorable History, which happened at Guclders about the yeare 1575. A Captaine bearing Armes for the King of Spaine, being marryed to an honest Gentlewoman, whom he entreated most vnworthily, vnderstanding that she was with child, began to make imprecations against her, and to say, I will stab this little Diuell which thou hast in thy belly▪ Not long after, shee was deliuered of a Sonne, which from the hipps downeward was very well shaped, but the vpper part was all couered ouer with redde and blacke spottes, the eyes stood in the fore-head, it had a round and black hideous mouth, and long eares like a bloud-hound, with two little crooked hornes on the crowne of the head, which became as redde as bloud, assoone as they were touched. PLATO writes in his 7. Booke of Lawes, that there is nothing more to be feared then the Fathers cursses against the Childe. The contrary is to be wished of all good children. It is a singular testimony of GODS fauour to such, as lawfully desire and purchase their Father and Mothers

            Maister ANDREVV HONSDORF in his Theater of examples, on the 4. commandement, propoundeth certaine Histories to the purpose, wherof we entreat, which I will briefly touch. Another dwelling in the Duchie of Saxony, carried a Daughter of hers that was possessed of the Diuell to Wittenberg, for to receiue some reliefe, and to commend her to the prayers of the Church. She confessed that this affliction came vpon her Daughter one day, when being in an anger, she had made an imprecation, wishing the Diuel would possesse her: as incontinently he did. Being caried on a time into the Church, as the congregatiō were in praier for her, a learned personage

hearing certaine fu

               ies of the euill spirit, sayd vnto him. O Satan the Lord rebuke thee. The spirit imediatly answered, let him rebuke me, let him rebuke me: and then held his peace.
            At Friburg in Misnia it fortuned that a Father being in a mighty rage with a Sonne he had, that dispatched not some-thing so soone as he would haue had him, began to say, would to GOD thou mightst neuer stirre frō the place where thou art. It was no sooner sayd, then done: for suddainly the Sonne remained, as it were fastned and nailed to the place where as he stood, and could not bee remooued by any strength or deuise whatsoeuer. And because he could neither bowe nor bend his body for to sit, they set a stay behinde his back, to ease him. Hauing continued in this estate three whole yeares togither, GOD hearing the prayers which were made for this poore Child, permitted that he could sit and stoupe, and th
                  •…
               n rise againe. In this manner he continued foure other yeares more, leane of face, eating very little, and speaking but seldome. Being asked at any time how he felt himselfe, his vsuall answere was, that GOD did chastice him, and that his mercy knew what issue his afflictions should haue, which nothing hindered the assurance that he had of his eternal saluation through IESVS CHRIST. At 7. yeares end, he died peaceably full of the spirit of repentance, faith and hope in the grace of his Sauiour, on the eleuenth day of September, in the yeare a thousand, fiue hundreth, fifty and two.
            Not long ago sayth M. ANDREVVE HONDSDORFE, we sawe an Almaigne very poore and sickly, and as wretched and miserable as might be, by reason of the imprecations which his Father had made against him a little

before his death: wyshing that all kinde of misfortune might accompany him, as long as he liued.
            A Mother hauing a very disobedient Sonne, fell downe▪ on her knees, and prayed GOD that her wicked Childe might bee burnt with a secret fire. This imprecation fell not to the ground: for the Sonne beeing suddainly seized with that fire ouer all his body, beganne to cry, Mother, Mother, your praiers are heard, and languished three dayes in vnspeakeable torments hee was consumed therewith.
            A disobedient Sonne in the Cittie of Milan, mocked his mother and made mouthes at her. The Mother iustly ince

It fell out not long after, that this rogue beeing apprehended for theeuing was condemned to bee hanged: and being on the ladder at the place of execution ready to be turned of by the hangman euery one sawe him make such mouthes as hee had made before to his Mother. These Histories and infinite others such like warne Parents to shun such speeches and to reclaime their Children with good admonitions or conuenient corrections. They likewise exhort Children to shew themselues humble, tractable and obedient, to the end they bee not confounded by the iust iudgement of GOD, maintayning the rights of those which are his liuely images vpō earth.
            In Silesia happened two memorable Histories, which shew the dangerous fruite of imprecations, &amp; the fauour of GOD assisting vs by the ministery of his Holy Angells, against the fury of euil spirits. A gentleman hauing inuyted certa
                  •…
               ne of his friends, &amp; prepared a sumptuous feast, seeing his expectation frustrated by their excuses, entred

into some cholor, &amp; sayd, since none of them will vouchsafe to come would al the Diuills in hell were here. Thervpon hee got him forth of dores, and went to Church, where the minister was preaching, vnto whō he gaue very dilligent eare: and continuing so, behold certaine men came riding into his yard, of tall stature, and all in black, which willed the gentlemans man to go and tell his maister, that his guests were come. They fellow exceedingly affraied ran to Church &amp; aduertised his Mr of it, who very much dismayd asked Coūsell of the minister what he shold do. He hauing finished his sermon willed that euery body shold voide the house. It was no sooner cōmanded then performed: but with hast that they made to get out, they left a little Child behinde them sleeping in the Cradle. Those guesse, that is to say the Diuils beganne to fling the tables &amp; other things about the house, to roare, &amp; to looke out at the windowes in the likenes of Beares, Wolues, Cats, &amp; terrible men, holding glasses of wine, &amp; dishes of meate in their pawes. As the gentleman to gither with the minister and neighbors were in great feare beholding such a sight, the poore Father began to cry, alas, where is my Child? Scarce was the word out of his mouth when one of those black guests brought the Child to the windowe in his armes, and shewed it to all that were in the streete. The gentleman almost beside himselfe, sayd to one of his men whom he made most account of, alack what shal I do? Sir answered his seruant, I wil cōmend my life vnto GOD, in whose name I wil enter the house, &amp; through his fauor &amp; assistance bring you your Child. Wilt thou, sayd his Mr, GOD be with thee &amp; strengthen thee. The fellow hauing receiued the Ministers blessing, went into the house, &amp; cōming to the Stoue
               
where those dreadfull guests were, he fell downe on his knees, commended himselfe to GOD, then opened the dore, &amp; sawe the Diuills in horrible formes, some sitting, some standing, others walking, some ramping against the walles, but al of thē assoone as they beheld him ran vnto him, crying, Hoh Hoh, what makest thou here? The seruant sweating with feare, and yet strengthned by GOD, went to the fiend that held the Child, and sayd vnto him, Come, giue me this Child. No marry wil I not answered the other: he is mine. Go bid thy Maister come and fetch him. The fellow insisting sayd, I will execute the charge which GOD hath cōmitted vnto me, for I know that all that I doe according there-vnto is acceptable vnto him. Therfore, in regard of mine office, and in the name, assistance &amp; vertue of IESVS CHRIST, I will take this Child from thee▪ and carry it to the father. Saying so, he caught hold on the Child, and held it fast in his armes. The black guests returned no answere, but roared and cryed out, Hoh sirra let alone the Child, or we will teare thee all to peeces. But he not respecting their menaces went safely away, and presently restored the Child to the gentleman his Maister. Certaine daies after all those guests vanished away, and the gentleman become wiser and a better Christian, returned to his house. IOHN GEORGE GODELMAN, Doctor of Lawe at Rostoch, in his treatise of Witches and Witchcraft booke 1. Chap. 1.
            Another gentleman vsing to giue himselfe vnto the Diuell, trauelling by night but with one man, was set vpon by a companie of fiendes, which would haue carryed him away. The seruant beeing desirous to saue his Maister held him fast about the middle. The Diuills beganne to crie, Sirra let goe your hold▪ but the fellowe

persisting in his determination, his Maister escaped. The same.
            
            In Saxony a young maid that was very riche, promised mariage to a proper young man, but poore. He foreseeing that wealth and inconstancie of sexe might easily alter this maidens resolution, freely opened his minde vnto her about it. Wherevpon she made a thou

               and imprecations to the contrary, and amongst others, this which ensueth. If euer I marry any other, let the Diuill take me and carry me away on the wedding day. What followed there-vpon? A certaine time after, the fickle wenche was betrothed to another, hauing vtterly forgot the former, who gently admonished her more then once of her promise and horrible imprecation. She nothing regarding him, made her ready to be marryed to the second: but the wedding day come, when euery body else was merry, the bride being wakened by her conscience, seemed sadder then shee vsed to bee. Where-vpon two men on Horse back, came and lighted at the house where the feast was kept, who were presently caried vp, and after dinner, when they fell to dancing, one of them (as the manner of the Country is to honour strangers which happen to bee at such feast▪) was desired to lead the Bride a dance. He tooke her by the hand, and walked her a turne or two: then in the presence of all her kinsfolkes and friends, he caught her vp, crying out for helpe and went out at the gate, where hee hoysed her vp in the ayre, and vanished away with his companion and their Horses. Her sorrowfull friends hauing sought her all that day, and continuing so the next morning, hoping to finde her where she was fallen some where or other, to the end they might haue buryed her body; met the two

Cheualliers which restored them the maidens wedding apparell, and al her Iewells: saying that GOD had giuen them poure ouer her, but not ouer her apparell: and so vanished away. The same.
            
         
         
            Rash Iudgements.
            
               THE yeare 1550. it happened that a certaine merchant in the Duchie of Saxony ryding forth of Towne, left his Wife with one Daughter and a maide at home. Hard by him dwelt the hang-man of the place, who hauing espied this opportunitie, found meanes to get into the house and hid himselfe in the Cellar, where when the maide came at night to drawe wine hee cut her throate. The Daughter being sent to call the mayde was also killed. Finally the Mother going to see why they both stayed so long receiued the like entertainement: which done he threwe their bodies into a Chest, ryfled the house, and went his way. Not long after the merchant returning home, and the author of such an execrable fact vnknowne, the hang-man accused the poore merchant to the Iudges, and deposed that the day before his departure hee had beene at great debate with his wife. The merchant was apprehended and tortured in such sorte, that he confessed (although hee were innocent) that hee had committed those three murthers, and therefore was condemned and put to death. But shortly after the murtherer discouered himselfe by a siluer bole which he offered to a gold-smith to sell, who knowing the merchants marke, gaue him money for it, and

after hee was gone, carried it to the Magistrate, vnto whom hee declared whose marke it had, and of whom he had bought it. Presently the hang-man was apprehended and being examined denied it at the first, but at length confessed the whole matter. Thus was the merchants innocency approued though too late before men, and the damnable murtherer executed with such punnishments as his horrible wickednesse deserued. PAVL EITZEN in the 3. booke of his Morales, Chap. 15. M. ANDREVVE HONSDORFF in his theater of examples. In another towne of Saxony it fortuned that at a certaine wedding a theefe stole a siluer goblet, &amp; being narrowly pursewed by some of the watch, he went and hid it in a fellowes bosome that had ouer-drunke himselfe and was layd a sleepe in the way as hee ran along. The watch hauing wakened this sleeper, found the goblet about him, &amp; carryed him to prison, where by tortures he confessed the theft, whervpon ensued sentence of death and execution. Within a while after the theefe apprehended for another robbery, confessed this former, and was hanged. PAVL EITZEN in the same booke and Chapter.
            
            Two theeues in the towne of Erford went and hidde themselues in a widdowes house with entent to cut her throate and carry away that shee had. For to drawe her out of her Chamber where shee lay, they got into the stable, and beganne to pinch a kidde which they found there, to the ende they might make the maide come downe: as indeede she did. For going to see what the kidde ailed, they caught her by the throate and killed her. The widdowe (which had no other maide but that one) hearing the kidde cry and the wench not returning went downe out of her Chamber and had her throate

cut by these murtherers, who rifled the house, and went their waies before day. The next morning, the neighbours hearing a little Dogge barke in the house, and seeing neither mistres nor made styrring abroade, at the length brake open the dores, and found those two persons murthered. Immediatly they began to charge and accuse a certaine man, that had the keeping of a Church thereby, because hee had vsed much to the sayd widdowes house. The Magistrates buylding on reports and coniectures, commanded the man to be apprehended, &amp; so extreamely tortured, that hee confessed he had cōmitted that which neuer came in his thought. Wher-vpon followed his condemnation and execution. The theeues not long after being taken &amp; imprisoned for other offences, confessed this murther of the mistres and maide: and were executed according to their merits. M. ANDREVVE HONSDORFF in his theater of examples. A certaine man in the towne of Basil fell out vpon some occasion with his Wife, who vnable any longer to endure his hard vsage, left her house and went to some of her friendes in the Countrie, and desired them to bee a meane of reconciliation betweene her husband and her. It chanced that about the time of her departure, another woman hauing drowned her selfe in the Rhine was cast vp on the shoare. All the towne ranne to see her, and because she was apparelled like the absent Wife, &amp; that her face was so disfigured as no man could not discerne her, in continently the people (there gathered togither) began to cry out and say that this cruell husband had killed his Wife, and then cast her so into the water. The Magistrates giuing more credit to this report then they should, cōmitted the husband to prison, where hee was put to such

torture as he confessed that which was not: namely that he had killed his Wife, and then throwne her body into the Rhine: vpon which confession hee was condemned and put to death, like a parracide. Three da

               es after, his fugitiue Wife returned for to reconcile herselfe to her husband: but hearing the piteous newes of his death, melting into teares, and running like a madde woman to the Towne-house, she presented her selfe before the Lords, proued her husbands innocency, and accused them of iniustice. They hanging downe their heads and condemning their rash iudgement, tooke as good order as possibly they could for the poore Widdowe. The same.
            
            A woman dwelling in a certaine Castle of the Archbishoprick of Breme, with her Sonne that was married, suffered herselfe to be abused by one of her men. Which discouered by the Sonne, and not able to beare it, hee besought his Mother to abstaine from such wickednesse. One day hauing beene abroad, and comming home, the fellowe that was with the Mother in her Chamber espying him a farre off ranne away. The Sonne followed after him, and with a wand that hee had in his hand strooke of his hat. This seruant got away and went into the seruice of a new maister, some two dayes iourney from thence. His friends sought for him and demanded him of the Sonne, who told them how matters had past, adding that he had his hat, but knewe not what was become of him, they taking this answere in euill parte, accused the young man for killing their kins-man. Pre sently the Iudge committed the innocent Sonne to prison, where the intollerable torment of the torture made him confesse that hee had killed the seruant and throwne

his body into a riuer thereby. Where-vpon he was condemned to loose his head. Being lead to the place of execution, he was admonished to tell the truth: he answered, I am innocent: but will it auaile me to tell the truth? I haue killed him. To conclude, he was executed &amp; yeelded vp the ghost in the inuocation of the name of GOD. Shortly after, the seruant and the widow were found out where they were, and being apprehended, suffered such punishment as they rightly merited.

            Two young Artificers dwelling in a towne of Germanie, went out together for to trauell the Country, shortly after, one of them returned againe in his companions apparell, with whom he had changed clothes. The others friends coniecturing by this change of apparell, that hee had made away their kinsman, accused him of murther to the Iudge of the place, who immediatly committed him to prison: where denying the fact, and put to torture, by force of torment he confessed, that he had murthered his companion, and got on his apparell, hauing eaten out his owne in an Ale-house. Where-vpon hee was condemned to death, &amp; executed, dying like a good Christian. Not long after, his companion returned safe and well. In perpetuall remembrance of this proceeding and vniust sentence pronounced against this innocent, in the Church of the place is the figure of a man laid vpon a wheele cut out in stone.

            BAPTIST FVLGOSA reports, that HERMOLAVS DONAT, one of the ten Lords at Venice, a personage of great authority, hauing in charge to examine a certaine young man, accused of an infamous crime, caused him diuers times to be tortured, for to draw out the truth of him: which not able to do, a cōfederate of the prisoners, desiring to bee reuenged on him for it, and to procure some ease to the other, watched him one night as he was returning homeward very late from the Pallace, accompanied but with one man, carrying a Torche, which suddainly put out, HERMOLAVS receiued a stab with a Poinard and fell downe dead in the place. The Lords of Venice meruailouslie incensed and offended with the haynousnesse of the fact, and not able to discouer the murtherer, purposed to search out diligently all circumstances that

might serue there-vnto. They called to minde, how before-times there had beene great variance betweene HERMOLAVS and IACQVES sonne to FRANCISCO FOSCATI Duke of Venice: Imagining there-vpon that IACQVES relying on the dignitie of his father, might well haue enterprised this murther, they committed him to prison, and tortured him extreamly. But he would neuer confesse that where-of hee was guiltlesse, not-withstanding they confined him into Candy, where hee dyed. The murtherer vrged by his conscience, became a Monke, and certaine yeares after in his death-bed, opened this murther to his Confessor: which after his decease was signified to the Seignorie.

            Famous and remarkable Iudgements.
            
               AN Italian Gentleman very rich, &amp; well fauored of ALEXANDER de MEDICIS the first Duke of Florence, falling in loue with a very honest &amp; faire yong maide, but very poore, and of base parentage, (being a Milners daughter, who liued in the Country not farre from Florence,) tryed many meanes to corrupt her, but all in vaine, the Virgin hauing her honor in great recommendation. In the end transported with this violent passion, and followed by men which did second him in his humour, hee goes in the night towards this Mill, takes the Maide violently from her father, and carries her to a house of his in the Country, where shee was rauished. This poore father goes to Florence, and attends the Duke at his returne from Masse,

makes his complaint vnto him, and demands Iustice. The Duke concealing his thoughts, sends him backe to his house, promising to take order for it. Presently after dinner, hee goes to horse, making a shew hee would goe Hunte, and goes towards this Gentlemans house, staying thereby in a place of pleasure. The Gentleman aduertised that the Duke was so neere, and drunke with his passion, thinking the Milner would not haue presumed to complaine of him, and trusting in his owne credit, he shuts the Maide vp in a secret place of his house, out of the way, and then goes to doe his dutie vnto the Duke, offering him his Pallace for his lodging, the which the Duke doth accept, and seemes to take great delight in the building of this house of pleasure: hee doth visit and view euery part, member, and corner thereof, very curiously, with their ornaments, and causeth all the chambers and Cabynes to be opened: finally he enters into a faire and long gallerie, at the end where-of was a close doore, but painted and inriched with rare deuises. The Duke seemes to haue more delight in that, then in all the rest, and smiling, hee sayde, That hee thought that it was the Store-house of all his Euidences, Treasure, and most precious Iewels. It was the prison of this honest Mayden, that had beene rauished. And for that the Gentleman made some delaye to open it, the Duke did presently doubt, that what he sought was there, and therefore hee commands them to open it: but the Gentleman pretended, that a seruant of his was gone to Florence, and had carryed the Keye with him. But finding the Duke (at these wordes) to bee the more earnest to enter, hee came to him, and after a great reuerence, he tolde him softly in his eare,

that there was a wench within, the which he was loath to haue seene, vnlesse it were his Highnes pleasure to see her I, I, answered the Duke, it is that I looke for. The gentleman thinking it would prooue but a iest (for that the Duke himselfe was much giuen to such excesse, the which was afterwards the cause of his death) hee opened the doore. Then the poore maide with her haire about her eares, weeping, and vndrest, doeth prostrate her selfe at the Dukes feete, and demaunds iustice for the wrong which had beene done her. Hereupon the Duke doth send presently for the Milner, and doth greatly blame the gentleman, and two of his chiefe confederates. Hee propounds two conditions to the gentlemā, either death without remission, or to marry the maide whom he had rauished. The gentleman who did not thinke to escape, seeing his Lord in such choller, accepts of the marriage: and by the Dukes sentence is condemned to giue vnto his wife, three thousand Ducats for her dowrie. Which beeing done in the presence of the Duke, of his traine, and of the Milner, the maide beeing honourably attired, he married her, held her for his lawfull wife, and she was so esteemed, beloued of him, and reuerenced throughout all Tuscanie, and the Duke was much honoured of all men, for so good an act of iustice. Histo. of Florence.
            
            There was a citizen of Como kept prisoner by a Spanish Captaine, and accused to haue committed a murther, for the which he was in great daunger of his life, in the yeare 1547. The wife of this prisoner beeing faire and of a good grace, but chaste, and very carefull for her husbāds deliuerie, went and came solliciting for him, by all the meanes shee could deuise. Presenting her selfe vpon her knees, shee beseeched him to saue his prisoners life.

This wretch taking her apart, said vnto her, there is one meanes to preserue your husbands life, without the which he must needs die. After some speeches thereupon, he discouers in the end his villanous heart, solliciting her to yield vnto him, with promise that soone after hee would restore her that which shee so much desired. The poore woman beeing fallen into a new affliction, after a long conflict in her thoughts, and an extreame griefe of heart, shee declares vnto her husband the cruell and villanous desire of the Captaine. The husband desirous to saue his life, perswades his wife to yield vnto the Spaniards bruitish appetite: who hauing enioyed the body of this desolate woman, would also haue her satisfie his coueteousnesse, paying him two hundred crownes. He added to these two horrible crimes, a third, which was most detestable; for hauing caused the husband to bee drawne out of prison, as it were to send him home to his house, and to deliuer him to his wife, who hoped for no lesse. This disloyall Captaine made the poore man to be presently carried backe into prison, and afterwards caused his head to bee cut off. The woman opprest with griefe, reports all this historie vnto her friends, and by their aduise complaines to the Duke of Ferrara, who being extreamely mooued at these crimes, sends presently for the Captaine, who beeing examined and found guiltie, he demands pardon: he is first condemned to restore presently the two hundred ducats, and to adde seauen hundred more. Secondly, hee causeth a Priest to come, and forceth the Captain to marry the widow in presence of them all. Thirdly, and at the same instant, instead of a nuptiall bedde, going out of the Church, hee caused a Gybbet to be set vp, whereas the Spanish Captaine was

hanged, and the widow honourably sent home to her house. History of Italie.
            
         
         
            Iudges no Iudges, but most vniust and detestable.
            
               IN a certaine place of Germanie, which I name not for some considerations. It happened in the yeare 1537. for Iudges to apprehend a certaine souldier in passing, who had committed some insolencie that was punishable, but not corporally, beeing but a light offence. Some say, that hauing a good purse, it made them condemne him to die. When as they pronounced this sentence against him, hee sayed vnto them with an assured countenance, You are vniust Iudges, who to please your Soueraignes, or to haue my purse, send me to execution: but if you bee so greedy of siluer, take all that I haue, and let me goe; I neither can, nor would if I might, reuenge mee of the wrong you haue done me, and doe promise you neuer to set my foote more in this place. Beware how you shedde innocent blood, to please two or three: feare that Iudge from whom nothing is hidden, who will reward euery man according to his merits, be they good or euill. But preuailing nothing with all his complaints and admonitions, hee added, Seeing that you stoppe your cares to my cryes, I adiourne you before the Iudgement seate of the Almightie GOD, you are most wicked Iudges, and corrupted for money. But hee was executed.

Before the yeare was expyred, foure of these vniust Iudges did perish miserably. One was slaine with lightning, another stabd at a Banket; the third was hanged for theft, and the fourth being tormented with a burning feuer, and other grieuous paines, died in despaire, and before hee gaue vp the ghost, hee cryed out saying; Sathan why doest thou stay? why doest thou not teare out, and carry my soule out of this body. I haue serued thee till now, I am therefore thine. I will not appeare before GOD with the Souldier. IHON le GAST of Brissac, in the 2. volume of his Table-talke, pag. 125.
            The following History is yet more strange. A Sonne doth so much forget the name and duty of a Sonne, as he accuseth his owne Father to haue had carnall knowledge with a Beast. The Father is imprisoned and put to the rack, where hee confesseth that hee had committed the act. Being from the rack, he denies it, and then confesseth it againe, being brought vnto it, his body being so weake, as it was not possible for him to endure such torments saying, that he had rather dye then be so pulled in peeces. Being brought before the Iudges, and demanded againe according to the custome: if he had not done this foule fact? he denies it constantly, and addes that the rack had forced from him that confession. That he neuer had any thought to pollute himselfe so villanously, much lesse committed the Acte. He is confronted with seuen witnesses, who maintaine that they had heard him confesse the fact in prison: where-vpon hee is condemned to bee burned aliue. As they lead him to execution, he still cryed out vnto the people which looked on him as hee past, that he was innocent of this accusation which had beene practised against him by his owne Sonne,

who sought his death to be maister of his goods to waste them. He was burnt aliue, died constantly, and his soule went peaceably vnto GOD. But within one moneth the Iudges and the witnesses did all perish miserably, and this execrable Parricide, falling into dispaire hanged himselfe. The same Author, vol. 2. pag. 126.
            These Histories of some Iudges, not Iudges, but Iudged before GOD, before themselues, and before men, as most vniust and detestable Iudges, are not produced to fauour in any sort the furies of some phantasticall and humerous persons, who for the faults of some few priuate men, haue dared to condemne the lawfull calling of them that administer iustice. Let the vniust learne of them that loue true honor, the peace of their consciences, the glorie of GOD, and the preseruation of euery mans right, to discharge them-selues honourably and faithfully of their charges. I continue to touch the vniust carriage of some, which may serue the reader as a patterne to put him in minde of many other examples. In our time they haue not beene content to take presents of meate and drinke, for the dispatch of mens sutes: they haue not been contented to see riche stuffes brought in for Mounsieur and my Lady, nor to suffer my Lady and her Daughter, to haue Bracelets, Chaines or Iewels giuen them, without seeming to knowe what it is, or to see any thing: they haue not beene content to aske and take by their house-hold seruants, by their friends and Brokers cunningly set on: They haue not beene content to traffique Iustice with all kindes of trades, to drawe all necessarie implements into their houses: finding nothing too whotte, too heauie, nor too base: To conclude, they haue solde Orphelins, Innocents,

widows, and poore persons, for bootes, shooes, and hats, &amp;c. But they are come now to say, What will you giue mee? and presently to hold forth the hand: yea (without offence to the Prouerbe, which forbids to looke a giuen horse in the mouth) they are now come to handle it, sometimes behinde the backe, seeming to walke with the Merchant, then to looke on it, to sound it, and to peize it, before they once will say, Well, assure your selfe of me. And yet they haue not bin contented with all this; 
                  •…
               ay they haue caused the poore Plaintife to giue his Vine-ground of tenne acres, to doe him iustice of fiue or sixe acres of Vine: to demaund a Horse of a hundred crownes, to get fiftie: to cause himselfe and his wife to be apparrelled from top to toe, to giue a fauourable voyce in a bad cause. And oftentimes if he that hath the right, hath giuen lesse than the other that is in the wrong, it prooues vnprofitable. And as one said, the foure horses behind, drawe backe the Coach which the first come had giuen. Nay they haue exceeded farther, asking that, which neither by GODS lawes nor mans can bee lent, sold, nor engaged: the losse whereof is greater, and no lesse irreparable then life. They would haue them buy iustice with a paiement, which is not onely contrary to all honestie and iustice, but whose infamie redounds vpon them that are yet vnborne. And to speake in plainer tearmes, in our time there was a President which died an Abbot, who saied vnto an honourable gentlewoman, that if shee would lend him her fore-part, he would giue her audience.
            They report a Historie of one who did yet worse. It was the Prouost la Vouste, who plaied a wicked part with a certaine honest woman. Shee comming vnto him to

make sure for her husband, whom this Prouost kept in prison, was required to graunt him one nights pleasure, and he would yield to whatsoeuer shee her selfe demanded.
            This woman finding her selfe much perplexed, looking on the one side to her breach of faith plighted to her husband, and on the other side, his life which she should saue, shee was very desirous to acquaint her husband there-with; who hauing dispenced there-withall, shee then yields vnto the Prouosts brutish desire, resting assured that he would certainly keepe promise with her, concerning her husband. But in the morning this most vilde wretch, (after he had caused her husband to be hanged) said thus vnto her, I did promise indeede to restore you your husband, I keepe him not, but I yield him vnto you.
            The same Prouost beeing ready to haue one hanged, the man beeing vpon the ladder, one came and tolde him in his eare, that if hee would deliuer him, and set him free, he should haue a hundred crownes. Where at hee taking some taste, made a signe to the hangman to stay; then studying of some deuise or tricke to make him escape, hee drewe neere, and cried out alowde in his language: Behold my masters, into what danger this wretch had brought me, for hee hath a crowne (hee did equiuocate vpon that word, which signifies a crown of gold, and the crowne of such as begin to bee in Sacris (as they speake) and in the first degree to be a Priest) and neuer tolde mee of it. But come downe with a vengeance, thou shalt be led before the Officiall thy Iudge.
            Another Prouost being desirous to saue a thiefes life, which had fallen into his hands, vpon condition that hee

should haue a share in the bootie, as they had agreed. But considering on the other side, that the murmure would bee great if he did not iustice, and that hee should bring himselfe into great danger, hee vsed this meanes. Hee caused a poore honest man to be taken, to whom he said, that hee had beene long sought for, and that hee had committed such and such an act. The man denies it confidently, as hauing his conscience cleere from any such crime. But this Prouost beeing resolute, let him vnderstand that he should get more by confessing it, seeing that howsoeuer, he must loose his life: and if he did confesse it, the Prouost did binde himselfe by oath, to cause so many Masses to bee sung for him, as hee should goe directly into Paradise: whereas not confessing it, he should bee hanged notwithstanding, and goe to the diuell; for that there was not any man would sing a Masse for him. This poore man, hearing him talke of death and hell, desired rather to be hanged, and so goe into Paradise. So as in the ende he came to say, that hee did not remember that hee had done that where-with they charged him, yet if they did remember it better than he, and were assured therof, hee would take his death in good part: but hee intreated them to keepe promise with him, touching the Masses. He had no sooner spoken the word, but they led him in to the others place that had deserued death. But when he was at the ladder, hee entred into some speech, whereby he gaue them to vnderstand, that he repented him, notwithstanding all that which they had promised him: for the preuenting whereof, the Prouost made a signe vnto the hangman to dispatch him: and so he was.

The Negatiue is more common; for all that is aboue spoken hath place where imminent daunger is, and in time of Warre: else no man ought without reason to striue so much from Lawe and Iustice: and a Iudge is not to bee admitted to the iustification of his Iudgement by other meanes, then these which are in the processe, and which are written before him, for he that is condemned might haue defended and iustified himselfe, or els haue reproched the witnesses, so as al might haue prooued his innocency. But the means of al this was taken from him with his life, which ought not to be. Yet notwithstanding by a decree made at Bourdeaux; Seruille was allowed to make his proofes by acts or witnesses of these crimes wherewith he charged the deceased. And for that afterwards he did nothing, and the two yong men were found innocent by an other sentence giuen the 14. of August 1528. he was condemned and executed. I.

Among other excellent workemen which he sought for, he caused a rare cutter and Architect called IOHN, to come from Trente, who for some iust reasons refused to come. In the end hauing receiued a promise of all safety and good vsage, he came and wrought long for the other. About the end of the worke, the Architect comming to demand his wages, they fell to some words. Whereof the ende was, that by the Consulls cōmandement, IOHN was put in prison, and by the same Consull (against his faith and promise) accused to haue spoken against some Ceremonies. The Consull beeing Iudge and party, pursued his purpose so furiously, as IOHN was condemned to loose his head. As they led him to execution, he marched with a cheerefull countenance, and died very constantly.

It happened as this man had fore-told: for the Consull (although he were in the flower of his age, and very helthfull) began the same day to bee tormented; sometimes, with a violent heat, sometimes with a vehement cold: to conclude he was stroken with a new disease, so as the third day hee went to answere to the Innocent against whom hee had beene a most vniust partie, and accuser and a Iudge, beeing cast out of the Land of the liuing by a t

            Wonderfull Fasting.
            
               HENRY of Hasfeld being gone out of the Lowe Countries to Berg in Norwaie, where he did traffick, liued there vnmarried without blame, he was very charitable vnto the poore, whome hee did clothe liberally, imploying some of his clothes to that vse: One day hauing heard a certaine Preacher speaking (indiscreetly) of myraculous fastes, as if it were no more in the power of GOD to maintayne any one lyuing without the helpe of meate and drinke, and displeased that this preacher was a dissolute man, which poluted holie things, hee tryed to fast, and to abstaine altogither from eating and drinking. Hauing absteyned three daies, he began to be very hungry. He therefore tooke a bitte of bread, meaning to swallowe it with a glasse of beere. But all that stucke so in his throate, as hee remayned forty daies and forty nights without eating or drinking. At the end of this time, he cast out at his mouth the bread and drinke which had remayned in his throate. This long abstinence made him so weake, as they were faine to restore him with milke. The Gouernor of the Country hearing of this wonder, calles for HENRY, and enquiers the truth of him: who giuing no credit to HENRYES confession, would see a newe tryall thereof. He therefore caused him to be shut vp, and carefully watcht and kept in a Chamber for the space of fortie daies and forty nights, without any thing to norrish him. The which he did endure without any noyse, and with lesse difficulty then the first, attributing

nothing vnto himselfe, but all to the power and honor of GOD. By reason of so rare and supernaturall an Abstinence, and for that his life was without reproche, hee was surnamed of many, the Saint of Norway. A while after, being come about his businesse to Bruxelles in Brabant, a debtor of his (hauing neither good money to pay him, nor any good conscience,) accused him of heresie, so as he was imprisoned, where he remained manie dayes without eating or drinking: in the end hee was condemned to be burned aliue, without making the people acquainted with his processe, who did see him goe to execution with his accustomed countenance. Hee was tyed to a great stake with a long chaine, and they did fire many fagots round about him, a pretty distance off, supposing that hee would runne about this stake, euen vnto the last gaspe. But contrarywise falling vpon his knees and lifting vp his eyes to Heauen, hee made a feruent prayer vnto GOD▪ then rising vp, he went couragiously o the fire, enters into the flames, and sits downe so quietly, as no man could see him moue hand or legge, or any other part of his body, but with-out any stirre or tormenting of himselfe, hee ended his life in the fire. They could not finde any peece of his bones: and many since passing by the place where hee had beene burnt, held it for a place of deuotion. This happened about the yeare 1545. the which I haue learned from the mouth of many men, worthy of credit, good friends to this man, with whome they had conuersed familiarly. IOHN WIER in his Treatise of extraordinary abstinence.
            
            It is not long since that a Chanoine of Leege, desirous to trie his force in fasting, hauing continued vnto

the seuenteenth day, hee found himselfe so faint and weake, as if hee had not beene sodenly helpt with good restoratiues, he had dyed. The same Author.
            
            A young Maide of Buchold in the territorie of Munster in Westphalia, being oppress with melancholie, and keeping the house, was for that cause beaten by her Mother. The which did so increase her greefe, as taking no rest, she was foure moneths without eating or drinking, vnlesse that some times shee did chewe a peece of a roasted apple, and washt her mouth with a little Tisane. She grew exceeding leane, but in the end GOD restored her, lyuing long after very modestly, and indued with singular piety. The same.

               IHON de MARESTS hauing beene murthered by the Scignior of TALLART, of a great and ancient house, and a Gentleman well suported by many great allyances, namely by Cardinall IHON of BELLAY, who made it his owne fact, it seemed that the execution of Iustice was not so speedie as the cause required. The Grand-mother of the deceased, hauing her onely refuge vnto King FRANCIS the first, cast her selfe vpon her knees, weeping before him at Fontainbleau: whereat the King being amazed, asked what she would haue of him? Iustice (answered she) if it shall please your Maiestic. At which word he commands her to rise speedily, and turning to all that did attend him, hee said: By the faith of a Gentle-man, it is no reason that this Gentle-woman should prostrate her-selfe before me, demanding a thing which for the due of my estate I owe her, but it is their duties that importune mee for remissions and pardons, the which I owe them not but of my especiall grace and royall prerogatiue. And after that hee had giuen her a long audience vpon the discourse of her request, which which was onely to haue speedy Iustice, and hauing promised it vnto her, he shewed that the word of such a King was fully accomplished, by the euent which followed. So as not able to be moued by any sute of his fauorites, nor of forraine Ambassadors, he would haue punishment inflicted, as the greatnesse of the offence required. And so TALLART was beheaded at the Hales at Paris, in the yeare 1546. Maister E. PASQVIER in the 5. booke of his Collections of France, Chap. 7.
         
         
            
            A notable Theefe.
            
               ABout the yeare 1503. there liued at Geneua a notable theefe called MORTAC, and in French MORTEL. He did inchant men in such sort, as no man could preuent his theeuing, nor punish him after the deed. Euery one knew he was a theefe, and were as warie of him as they could. It was a common watch-word in all the houses of the Towne, when as night came, for Maisters and Mistresses to warne their seruants to shutte the doores for feare of MORTAC, which grew to be an ordinary Prouerbe, when as they doubted any one that had filching fingers. But there was neither doore, lock, nor barre, that could keepe him out, where hee had a will to enter: yet hee went not to all places, but only to those that lookt sowerly on him, and seemed to distrust him, for he tooke a delight to steale, to be admired for his abilitie and cunning: neither did hee care to gather much together, but contented himselfe with a little, taking no more then would serue him for some 40. or 50. meales, with some companions which he carried vp and downe, feasting them at his charge. And there was no meanes to preuent his wil: for he did so inchant them of the house, as they lost their speech, &amp; all meanes to resist him, making them like immoueable stocks, when he entred into their houses. Before he would seize vpon that which he pretended, hee would first feed himself at his 
                  •…
               ase. The first thing he euer did was to light a candle, thē to take the keys of the house yea from vnder the maister &amp; mistresses pillow, although they were awake: not that he wanted keies, for his fingers

serued him for his Pick-locks: but in thus proceeding he would shew his theeuish authority. Then would he open the Larder &amp; the Seller, from whence hee fetcht meate and wine, couered the Table, and eate and drunke at his leasure and pleasure, and yet not any one of the house did stirre, eyther to hinder him, or to accompany him, neither to crye out, nor yet to speake vnto him, eyther good or bad. This done, he went and opened the goodmans cofers, and tooke what money hee thought good, to make good cheere with his Mignions, for 3. weekes or a moneths space in some Tauerne. The next day hee and his band would campe where was best wine: and the Tauerne keepers entertained this rable very gratiously. For this MORTAC did no harme in those places where he vsually frequented, and where the maisters did make much of him. After they had made many good meales, when they came to reckon, he neuer brought any money but sayd vnto the Hoste: Goe and fetch thy due in the corner of such a Chamber of thy house, the which perchance had not beene frequented a moneth before. The which the Host doing, hee found the iust summe, and not a farthing more or lesse. It was very strange, that the Iudges did not punish him. He was often put in prison, but the Iudges durst not exceed the lawe, the which did forbid them to condemne any one accused, before he had confessed the fact. And this MORTAC was so constant in denying the trueth, as it was impossible to draw any thing from his owne mouth, whether it were that he felt no torments, or that hee did contemne them. for he apprehended no more to be strained with a corde, then to dance, If they gaue him a sharpe strapadoe, hee seemed to endure much, and would crye out: Let mee

downe, and I will tell the trueth. Being let downe and vntied, he would say vnto the Gouernors, what will you haue mee say? There-vpon they asked him, who hath done this, or that: and he mocking them, would repeate this question, saying: Doest thou know who hath done this or that? and then he would adde in scoffing manner, giue me once more the Strappadoe, for the loue of the Ladies, so as they were forced to let him alone. He committed infinite thefts, after the manner before mentioned: but hee dyed not so shamefully as he deserued, yet most cruelly, for the plague hauing so seized vpon his throate, as he could not speake, his Mother (who tended him) fearing he would scape and be hanged afterwards, buried him aliue. And so liued and dyed MORTAC▪

               THE Emperor MAXIMILIAN the first, committed the managing of a great summe of mony to a Gentleman that was exceeding prodigall, and a very bad husband: whereof being aduertised, he called for him, and demanded an account of a remainder, amounting to 2000. crownes and vpward. The other required some respite to make perfect his account, which was granted him. Hauing considered throughly of the matter, the next day hee went and presented himselfe vnto the Emperour, who wondring at his sodaine returne, referred him to the time prefixed the day before. Sacred Maiestie (then said the Gentleman) I will briefly shew you the trueth of the case, to the end you may not

be troubled long about it. You are good to all men I confesse I haue imployed the most part of your money, in the entertainment of whores, buying of Horses, gaming and bankets: and without farther excusing of my selfe: I haue done ill: I haue deserued to bee punished by the lawe: But I besecch you to beare with my youth, and for my friends sake to pardon me: if it may please your Maiestie to vse me, I will be wiser here after. The Emperor hearing this free and open confession, began to smile, &amp; presently commanded his Barber to be sent for, to whom he said, cut me this Gentlemans hayre, and with thy Rasor make him a faire large crowne on the top of his head, for I will presently make an Abbot of him. At the same instant the Emperor was aduertised of the vacancie of an Abbey, by the death of the Abbot, &amp; they were deuising in MAXIMILIANS presence, vpon whom it should be conferred? marry vpon him yonder, quoth the Emperor, pointing to the Gentleman that was in the Barbars hands. Then calling him vnto him, he sayd: I giue thee such an Abbey; If thou continuest as thou hast begun, thou wilt consume both Monkes and Couent. The Gentleman vnto whom good fortune came sleeping (like vnto a C

            GEORGE of Amboise, Cardinall, a chiefe Councellor to the good King LEVVIS the twelfth, did enioye Gaillion, depending of his Arche-bishopricke of Rouan, the which hee did in-large and beautifie all hee could, as a house of pleasure, to delight him after his

serious occupations. There was a gentleman, a neighbor of his some-what distressed; who to free himselfe, spake to one of the Cardinalls followers, to be a meanes vnto his Maister to buy his land, the which laie very conueniently for Gaillion. As the disposition of all Courtiars is readie for such negotiations, he presently aduertised his Maister, perswading him that he might buie this Land good cheape. To whom the Cardinall answered, with a smyling and cheere-full countenance, that he desired nothing more then to conferre with the gentleman, about that purchase: commanding him to inuite him to dinner. This commandement was presently put in practise by the Courtiar. Some fewe daies after the gentleman hauing dyned with the Cardinall the table being taken vp and euery one retired to giue them place for their priuate talke. The Cardinal began to fall into discourse vpon this Land, aduising him as a neighbour &amp; a friend not to sell that place which was his ancient inheritance: the other insisted to the Contrary, alledging for his reasons, that hee did hope to reape three commodities by this sale: the one was in getting his fauor by this meanes: the other was that with a part of the money hee should marry a Daughter of his: and the last that he should imploy the rest of his money in rentes, which should profit him as much as the reuenewes of his whole Lands: And therefore my Lord (sayd he) for that it lies more conueniently for you then any other, I haue addrest my selfe vnto you, to make you what price you please. But neighbour (answered the Cardinall) if you might borrowe money to marrie your Daughter well, would you not be much better pleased to keepe your Lande? whervnto the gentleman replyed, that it would bee an other

difficultie to pay the money at the prefixed day. But if you might haue such a time giuen you (sayd the Lord) as without strayning of your selfe, you might free your debt, what would you say? O my Lord replyed the other, you say well, but where are such lenders? And so being fallen into a still discourse of selling and lending, in the ende this good Legat sayd, truelie I wilbe the Man, and no other, that will performe what I haue said. The which hee did, for hee lent him money for so long a Terme, as this gentleman married his Daughter to his owne minde, and yet saued his Lande. As all Courtiers are carefull of their Maisters profit, though it be to an others hurt: comming from their secret conference, this Mediator comes, who demandes in priuate of his Maister, if hee had agreed vpon the price. I sayd hee, and I thinke I haue gayned more then you will beleeue. For insteede of the Lordshippe, whereof you did speake. I haue purchased a friend, desiring rather to haue a good neighbour then all the Lands in the world. The poore Courtier being confounded, did no more dreame of any such bargaines. I would to GOD that all Noblemen would consider well of this Historie. And yet this Cardinall dying, did Lament with teares the time which hee had spent rather in following of a Kings Court then in teaching of his flock. M. E. PASQVIER liber 5. de ses recerches.

               A Nobleman of Spaine, falling in Loue with a maide exceeding faire, whose Father had beene a Gold-smith in the Cittie of Valencia, hauing sought by many meanes the vse of her, was still reiected. Beeing vanquished by his affections, hee demanded her for his Wife, hee marries her in a Chamber, in the presence of her Mother and Brethren. Hauing entertayned her about a yeare and a halfe, vnder this pretext, in the ende transported with a newe desire, hee marries a Ladie of a great house publickely. The maide whome hee had so wretchedly seduced, findes meanes by Letters and messages to drawe him againe vnto her, and shee perswades him that shee is content hee shall vse her as his Concubine, comming twise a weeke vnto her house. Shee flatters him in such sort; as hee promiseth to

come to her the next day: where hee is receiued with kinde imbracings, and spends the daie in sundrie discourses. Night beeing come, he lies with her, who findes so many excuses, as this Nobleman is put of till after his first sleepe. Beeing soundly a sleepe, this maide transported with greefe and furie, and assisted by a bondwoman of hers, who had made prouision of two great sharpe kniues, and of a strong corde tied to one of the bedde-postes, shee straines this corde ouer his bodie beeing a sleepe, then sodenly shee takes one of these kniues, and strikes him in the throate with all her force. He startes, but with little life. But on the other side the slaue drewe the corde with all her strength, where-with his armes and body were so intangled, that before hee could free himselfe, shee had giuen him many stabbes in the body, taking frō him at one instant both his speech and life. The candle being light, this maide transported with her greeuious fury, proceeding from a iust disdaine, pulles out the dead mans eyes, cutts out his tongue, and then his heart, the which she teares in peeces, &amp; mangles him in diuers parts of his body, the which with the helpe of her slaue she casts out at a windowe into a streete that was much frequented. Day being come euery man runs to beholde this bloudie spectacle. They speake diuersly of the fact, for that they could not knowe the bodie being so much disfigured, hauing nothing on but a bloudie shirt torne with blowes. As euery man gaue his Censure, the maide comes downe in the streete and deliuers the whole fact, with a constant and an assured countenance, the which is verefied (besides her confession) by the deposition of this Noblemans seruant, of the Preest that had married them and of the Mother and

Brethren that had assisted. Assoone as the body was cast into the streete, the Maide giues vnto her slaue a good summe of mony, aduising her to saue her selfe, the which she did in the morning. As for the Maide being satisfied with so extraordinary a reuenge, she doth freely and often aduow before the Iudges all that shee had done, and being condemned to loose her head, she went constantlie and cheerfully to execution, suffring death willingly, to the great amazement of all the Inhabitants of Valencia. Historie of Spaine,
            
            A while after the Battaile of Rauenna, giuen in the yeare 1512. a Neopolitaine Gentleman called ANTHONIE BOLOGNE, hauing beene Steward to FREDERIC of Arragon King of Naples, who being despoyled of his estate, retired into France, was called by the Duchesse of Malfy, a great Lady, issued from the house of Arragon, sister to a Cardinall, one of the greatest in his time, widow to a great Noble-man, and Mother to one onely Sonne, to be her Steward. The which he hauing accepted, a while after this widowe being young and fayre, hauing regarded him with a lasciuious eye, she desired him: but to couer her fault, shee sought the colour of marriage: and after many vaine discourses in her thoughts, insteed of flying to the councell and good aduise of her Bretheren, and honorable Kinsfolkes, (whereof she had many) and to accept a partie fitte for her qualitie, the which might easily haue beene found neere or farre off: transported with her desire, she discouers her thoughts vnto this Gentleman, who drunke with his owne conceite, and forgetting the respect which hee ought vnto his Ladye and to her house, neither yet remembring his owne meane estate, would not excuse him-selfe, nor giue

her such Councell as he ought in this occurrent, but being presumptuous and lust-full, he yeelded to ioyne (vnder the vaile of a secret marriage) with her who had long before cast vnchast lookes at him, and with whome he had rashly and against all dutie fallen in loue. These two vnaduised creatures then lying together, in the presence of a Chamber-maide onely, vnder the collour of marriage, so behaued themselues, as after some monthes the Duchesse was with Childe, and brought in bedde of a Sonne, the which was conuaied secretly into the Country. This first delyuerie remayned secret: but beeing againe with Child and deliuered of a Daughter, the newes were presently spred ouer all, and came to the eares of the Cardynall, and of an other Brother at Rome, Being about to inquier who it might bee that had beene so famyliar with their sister, BOLOGNE seeing that it was generally noted, tooke his leaue of her, she beeing with Child, meaning to retier to Naples, and then to Ancona, there to attend some other euent of their affaires. Hauing carried his two Children with him, and hyred a conuenient house, the Duchesse sent her richest stuffe thether, and soone after vnder collour of a Pilgrimage to Lauretto, at her returne shee goes to Ancona with all her trame, where the next day after her arriuall, hauing called all her gentlemen and hous-hold seruants, shee gaue them to vnderstand that BOLOGNE was her hus-band, and that she was resolued to continue with him, suffring them that would go and serue the yong Duke her Sonne to depart, and promising good recompences to them that should remaine with her, shewing them their two Children. Her seruants amazed at this discours left the Duchesse and BOLOGNE: and beeing parted from her

presence, they sent one among them to Rome, to aduertise the Cardinall and the Prince, of all their Sisters fact. The first attempt of these two Brethren against BOLOGNE and his pretended Wife, was to haue them chased out of Ancona, by the credit which they had with SIGISMOND of Gonzague the Popes Legat in that place. They retired speedely then to Sienna, but they must needes depart from thence, being expelled by ALPHONSO CASTRACIO Cardinal of Sienna, and by the Iustice of Sienna. After diuers consultations, they resolued to retier to Venise, and to that ende to take the way of Romagnia; but beeing vpon the territory of Furlie they descouer a farre off a troupe of horses galloping towards them. The Duchesse was presently of an opynion that BOLOGNE should saue himselfe with his Sonne, who was nowe growne bigge, the which they did, beeing both well mounted, and retired to Milan. These Horse-men, hauing fayled of part of their preye, spake gratiously vnto the Duchesse, and conducted her with her other two Children into the Realme of Naples, into one of the Castells of the young Duke her Sonne, where shee was presently imprisoned, with the two Children shee had by BOLOGNE, and her Chamber-maide. Some fewe daies after, three of them which had taken her in the plaine of Furli, came into her Chamber, and denounce her death vnto her, suffring her to recommende her selfe vnto GOD, then they tied a corde about her necke and strangled her, which done, they lay hold on the Chamber maide, who cryed out with open throate, and strangle her also, and in the ende they seize vpon the two young Children, and send them after the Mother and the maide.
            
               The two Brethren contynuing their course caused BOLOGNES goods at Naples to bee confisked, and hauing descouered that hee was at Milan they suborne certaine men to feede him with hope that in time they will make his peace, making him beleeue that his Wife and Children were yet aliue, who although he were aduertised by a gentleman of Milan of the Duchesse death, &amp; of an ambush that was layed for him, yet wold he not beleue any thing, nor retier himself out of Milan, where there were murtherers suborned to kill him: of which number there was a certaine Lombard a Captaine of a companie of foote: so as soone after, BOLOGNE going out of the Friars where hee had beene to heare Masse hee was compassed aboute by a troupe of Soldiars, and their Captaine, who slue him presently beeing about two yeares after the Duchesse death. As for his Sonne who was not then with him, hee was forced to slie out of Milan, to change his name, and to retier himselfe farre off, where he died vnknowne. Historie of Italie.
            
            At what time Pope IVLIO the second, made warre in Italie all the Townes in a manner beeing troubled with the factions, a young Romaine Gentleman called FABIO fell in Loue with a Gentlwoman named AEMILIA, Daughter to one of his Fathers mortall enemies. Shee beeing inflamed with the like affection, by the meanes of her Gouernesse, they did write Letters one vnto an other, and then spake togither, and in the ende they made a mutuall promise of marriage, vpon a vaine hope that it should be a meanes to vnite their houses that were enemies. The worst was, they did consumate this marriage.

After some daies FABIOS Father feeling himselfe old, commanded his Sonne to take a partie, and to tell him what maiden he desired to haue to Wife. FABIO hauing delayed to giue him any answere, in the ende hee names AEMILIA whereof hee was with great chollour refused by his Father, to whose will in the end hee yeelded, abandoning AEMILIA after that hee had excused himselfe as well as hee could vnto her. This sorrowfull Virgin growne madde to see her-self so abused, seemed to disgest this pill quietly, intreating her Gouernesse to obtaine so much of FABIO that he would bee pleased to come some-times in the weeke to see and comfort her, and so by little and little to burie their passed friendship. FABIO yeelding to that passion came to see her. She gaue him kinde well-come, deuising very familiarly all the euening togither, and then to lie with her, as hee had done beefore. But hauing intreated him in any case not to touch her, but to staie vntill the morning, pretending her fore-passed greefe, as soone as this miserable wretch was fallen a sleepe, shee takes his dagger and killes him, then hauing called her gouernesse, shee stabbes her selfe in her presence with the same poynard, and died presently. The next day this pittifull accident did much amaze and afflict the two Fathers and their families, for that remedie was past. History of Italie.
            
         
         
            Detestable Cursings.
            THere was a certaine learned and reuerent man in Spaine had two Sonnes: the one beeing thirteene yeares olde or there aboutes did some malitious acte,

wher-with the Mother was so incensed with choller, as she began to curse him, and to giue him to the Diuell, wishing that he might carry him away. This was about ten of the clock at night, and when as the Mother continued her cursing, the childe being amazed, went downe into the Court, where he vanished away, so as it was impossible to finde him, not-with-standing any search they could make. All were troubled at this accident, seeing there was no doore nor windowe open, whereby hee might get out. After two houres, the Father and the Mother being much discomforted, they heard a great noyse in a chamber ouer theirs and the child which groned pittifully. They goe vp, and opening the chamber dore with the key, they finde this child in so poore estate as it was a pitty to behold him: for besides that his garments were all torne, he had his face, hands and almost all his body so brused and scratched as it were with thornes, and so disfigured, as all the night hee could scarse come to him-selfe. The Father and the Mother did all they could deuise to ease him, and then the next daye seeing that he was come something to himselfe, they inquired of him the reason of his aduenture the night past. Hee answered that beeing in the Court, certaine men wonderfully great, vggly and fearefull, approching neere vnto him, without speaking any word, had lifted him vp into the ayre, with an incredible swiftnesse, then setting him downe in certaine Mountaines full of thorns had drawne him through them, and left him in the same estate, they had now found him in. That finally they had slaine him, if he had not recōmended himselfe vnto GOD: these executioners then brought him backe againe, and made him to enter by a little

window of the Chamber, and so vanished away. The boy remained deafe and in verye bad case by this Visitation, beeing ashamed and greeued if any one did question with him or put him in minde of it A. TORQVEMADOE in the thirdiourney of his Hexameron.
            
         
         
            Melancholike, Madd, Franticke, Furious and enraged persons.
            
               I Meddle not with the controuersies of learned Physitions touching the differences of these diseases, according to the humour most predominant, either in the braine, or in the Hypocondres, or throughout all the body: neither will I enter into consideration of the remedies which they bring. And without subiecting my selfe to any exact order for this beginning, I will endeauour to quicken the readers spirits, by this variety, to dispose him to higher considerations, and vppon euery history draw him to the reuerence of almighty GOD, who is iust and mercifull.
            As for those sicke persons that are strooke with a Melancholike humour, whereof I represent many histories in this section, we haue seene and heard spoke of diuers kindes. All beeing hurt, especially in the imaginatiue facultie, haue strong and very strange apprehensions. Some imagining that they are become pots of Earth or of Glasse through-out all their bodies, or part of it, flye all company for feare of breaking. Others thinking that they are become Woolues or Cockes,

howling and crowing, and beating their armes, as if they had wings. Some haue feared infinitely least the ground vnder them should open; others that haue represented vnto them-selues nothing but hideous fantasies and death. Some that haue imagined them-selues dead, and would no more eate nor drinke. Some haue thought they haue had Stagges-hornes on theyr heads. Some haue cast them-selues into Pondes and Riuers, where they haue perished, or else haue beene found in extreame danger, and haue beene drawne out happely for them.
            There was an Italian Monke, possest with such a melancholike humour, as hee cast himselfe into the Gulfe of Venice, and there was lost. An other confessed that the Euill-spirits had often awaked him in the night, and perswaded him to cast him-selfe head-long into a Well, They do all in a manner feare things of nothing, and do not apprehend those that are hurtfull. They are afraide of a Foxes tayle where-with they would whippe them, of strawe where-with they would shakle them: and if you tye them by the legges but with a rush vnto a bed post, they will moue no more then Images: and contrariwise they will some-times break Cordes and Chaines of Iron where-with you shall thinke to holde them. Sometimes they sing and talke incessantly, other times they weepe and are mute. the humour comming to alter more, the furye increaseth, and they fall into despayre, and perpetuall desire of death; the seeke for nothing but for Kniues to murder themselues, for windowes to cast themselues downe head-long, for dores to flye out at, and commit some excesse, that they might auoide this feare which doth torment them.
            
               And therefore we doe alwayes see them sad, amazed terrified like vnto little children which goe in the darke, the fume of this black and melancholike humour, marueylously troubling the seat of the vnderstanding, whence proceedes this amazement. So wise men doe hold, that the humours of the body doe alter our complexion, whence after doth proceede the change of the actions of the minde: so as the faculties of the mind, do follow the disposition of the body. There hath beene found a melancholike man which hath supposed himselfe to be without a head; to cure him whereof, they haue charged his head with a hat of lead which was such a continuall burthen vnto him, as in the end he was helpt of that imagination. Hee that thought himselfe to bee all of Glasse, was recouered by the approch of a friend of his, who said that hee was yet more brittle, and iesting politikely with him, freede him from his Imagination with good wordes. Some haue beene seene who imagining themselues condemned to die, could not bee diuerted from that apprehension, but in seeing of a Pardon counterfetted to that ende, taking the paynes to reade it himselfe for his better assurance. An other saying that hee was dead and in his graue, was retyred from that humour, by the dexteritie of his Companion who shut himselfe vp with him and eating, perswaded him to eate, saying that it was vsuall among the dead.
            Some hold their eyes still fixt vppon the ground, and are wonderfully offended to heare any one laugh, finde nothing that is good, fayre nor well done, bee it neere or farre of, imagining still, that they will put them into prison, beate or kill them: they

crye him mercy whom they first met, they kneele down for feare to an Infant, or to a little Dogge: they seeke holes &amp; obscure places: they make Men beleeue that they are bewitched, inchaunted and poysoned. To conclude, this disease is a Tree, whereof we cannot number the branches nor the leaues. I had forgotten to say that there are some which feare and hate their most familier and greatest friends: others that cannot indure any man, and feare nothing so much as to bee seene. Some haue feare of all creatures whatsoeuer; or of some in particucular: those which haue beene bitten by madde-Dogges are wonderfully afraid of Water. To conclude howe many particular fantasies and diseases soeuer there be of melancholicke humours, so many sorts of frensies there bee. But it is a generall thing almost in all persons, toucht with any melancholike humour, troubling the braine simplie moued with strange fumes, which proceed from this venemous humour, or augmented by some newe accident as the biting of madde-Dogges, by extraordinary illusions, or otherwise, to grow fearefull, especially of things which are in no sort to befeared.
            Nowe it remaines, that wee produce some notable Histories of our Times, touching these passions. My intention in the report of them, is to shewe how much wee ought to feare our owne miseries, to remember ourvanities, and to thinke that GOD needes not to seeke far for any rods to scourge vs, seeing that wee carry them in our own bowels, that death is in this vessell of our bodies and that our soules are in miserable captiuitie, if the light of grace &amp; heauenly truth doth not shine incessantly vpon them.
            In our time a Gentleman fell into such an humour of

melancholie, as it was not possible in the extremity of his sicknesse to change an opinion he had, that hee was dead: so as if his friends and seruants came to flatter, intreate or presse him to take some nourishment or phisicke, he reiected all, 
                  •…
               aying that the dead had no neede of such things. Sixe dayes past without receiuing of any foode, and the seuenth being come (which is mortall to hungry bodyes) his friends deuised a policie to free him of this fantasie. His Chamber beeing artificially made darke, they caused certaine men to enter into it, beeing masked and clothed in white sheetes, tyed vp like vnto them that are buryed.
            The table was couered with meate; wher-with these masked Men began to fill them-selues, making little noise but with their chappes and drinking hard. The sicke man seeing this sport, demanded what they were, and what they did there? They answered him that they were dead-men, which made good cheere. Howe then saith the sicke Man, doe dead men eate? I, saide they and with a good stomacke. If you will bee of the company, you shall see that we speake the truth. Presently the sicke man shakes his eares, leapes out of his bed, and begins to feede with these dead-men with a good stomacke. Hauing dronke well sleepe takes him, with the helpe of a drinke which they had prepared for him and giuen him in this banket of dead men. This was the meanes to purge him of his Melancholie.

            An other troubled with an Hypocondriacke Melancholy, perswaded thimselfe that Toades and Frogges did eate his belly: and there was no meanes to take from him this opinion. In the ende his Physition saide vnto him, that hee did verily beleeue, that there was some such vermine in his body. There-vpon hee giues him a purgation: and causeth some Frogges and to ades to bee cunningly conueyed into his close stoole, The Physicke hauing wrought they presently shew the Patient his excrements, and these little beasts swimming aboue it, the which purged the Melancholie, that did possesse him.

            An other supposing that his buttocks were of Glasse, could not bee perswaded to sitte downe for any businesse whatsoeuer, fearing that if hee did sitte downe vppon any Chayre or stoole, his buttockes would breake, and that the peeces would flye here and there. In the same Treatise.
            
            
               I haue seene a Melancholike Man, which did imagine that all the superficies of the world was very fine glasse, that the part vnder it was all full of Serpents, and that his bed was as it were in an Iland, from whence if hee did stirre, hee should breake the glasse and fall among the serpents: and therefore it was not possible to drawe him from thence.

            A Bourguignon beeing sicke of a burning feauer at Paris, did affirme that he was dead, and then his fantasie comming to change, he intreated the Physitions not to hinder his soule (which was in Purgatory) from flying into paradise. Sometimes he did counterfet one that was dying and giuing vp the ghost: then he would say, looke howe I die: then afterwards he was surprized with dispaire, and with a wonderfull strange feare. They caused him to haue the Emoroydes and with other fit remedies they recouered him his health. Comment: vpon the 17. chap. of the 2. booke of M. I. HOVLIER, of inward diseases.

            A Gold-smiths widow at Lions opprest with extreame melancholie, by reason of sundry griefes after her husbands death, did trouble them much to keepe her in her sicknesse. And yet they could not watch her so narrowly, but one day in the turning of a hand she cast her selfe out of a high Chamber windowe vpon the pauement in the street Rasin, where shee was sore hurt in the head, so as shee lost great aboundance of bloud, and by this meanes recouered her right wits, and within fewe dayes was cured of this fall.

            A Germaine remayning at Paris in the streete of Noyers, seized with a melancholike humour and transported with madnesse, in the night hee cut his owne throat with a knife, and stab'd himselfe in manye places of the brest and belly, whereof some entred, and the other were but superficiall. The next day some of his companions going to see him in the house of a Banker called PEROT where he was in pension, they found him thus drest, with a great aboundance of bloud lying about him. Seeing this spectacle, they thought his seruant had thus hurt him, for that he laye in his Chamber. Hee is taken and carried prisoner to the Chastelet,

Hee would not vse any more Physicke, his seruants saying that hee had beene bewitched, and causing him to vse preseruatiues against witch craft, the which did him no good. Then they changed their opinions, giuing it out that he had the Diuell in his body, causing him to bee exercised, but in vayne: for it was a disease, which is expelled by good remedies, or through continuance of time. As it happened, that after eyght months hee recouered his health, and so hath continued since.

BRASAVOLE in his coment vpon the 65. Aphorisme of the 5. booke of HIPPOCRATES.
            I did lately see a man who might serue for a patterne to any one that would paint Melancholie it selfe. Hauing marryed about the beginning of Iuly a lusty young Woman, hee abandoned himselfe with such vehemency to the acte of Venerie, as after some dayes hee fell mad. I caused him to bee chayned, vsing many lotions for his head to refresh his braine and to prouoke him to sleepe, and with the helpe of a good dyet, I restored him but not in such sort, as I would haue trusted him much, for his heauy eyes presaged nothing but furye. IACCHIN in his Coment vppon the ninth Booke of Rasis cap. 15.
            There are three kindes of sharpe rauings: the one is when as in the extremity of a Feauer the sicke person doth raue, and speake strange things. The other called frenzie, is alwayes accompanied with folly: for although the sicke body, hath respites lesse troublesome at one time then at any other, yet hee hath alwayes his vnderstanding carried away by fantasies. The third is more dangerous, when as the folly hath no respittes: but doth all things furiously and with violence. A young Gentle-woman beeing fallen into this third kinde of rauing, I was called about mid-night to visite her, and found her in that same fury, so as shee leaped violently sometimes of one side, sometimes of another, and all that shee could lay holde of, shee pulled in peeces, or tare it with her teeth: were it the hayre, the armes or hands of her selfe, or of any other, or what-soeuer she laid hold on shee carried awaye the peece, so as they were faine to chayne her, that

she might doe no more harme to her selfe, nor to any other. After some houres, this tempest being some-what appeased, shee fell into a sound sleepe. In the ende through diuerse remedies, the which shee did take with great difficultie, she recouered her former health. But after the manner of women (especially of Gentlewomen) not caring to follow those directions that were prescribed her, for the preseruation of her health, but liuing at pleasure, a moneth after shee fell into the same disease, and within 24. houres after dyed, not-with-standing any meanes that could be vsed.

            A man being some-what aboue thirty yeares old, in the day time was very well, hauing his vnderstanding good, and his Iudgement perfect: but night being come, if hee went to bed and slept, presently hee entred into a frenzie, some-times he cryed out with all the force he could, he flourished with his armes and his legges, sometimes hee did rise, leape, and runne vp and downe the house, if he were not stayed. Being awake, and day come, he returned to his perfect sence, managed his affaires discreetly: of a setled spirit, hating solitarinesse, and louing to discourse with his friends and familiers.

            DANIEL FREDERICK a maker of Kettles, dwelling at Fribourg in Brisgaw, of the age of 27. yeares, was dangerously possest, being carried ouer tops of houses, where hee did clime vp and runne without any apprehension of the hazard of his life. They were forced to tye him with chaines. After some moneths, GOD did ease him mercifully, by the helpe of the great veynes, which did appeare in his thighes, the which being wonderfully

swelled, and in the end opened, he was eased. And since euery yeare vnto the 50. of his age, which was in the yeare 1581. vsing a fit incision in the said veines, he hath peuented a relapse, without the which remedy he could not haue con

            To the former Histories, we will ioyne some, touching the Licanthropes and mad-men, the which wee will consider of two sorts. For there be Licanthropes in whom the melancholike humor doth so rule, as they imagine themselues to be transformed into Wolues. This disease as AETIVS doth witnesse lib. 6. Chap. 11. and PAVLVS lib. 3. Chap. 16 with other late writers, is a kinde of melancholic, but very black and vehement: for such as are toucht there-with, goe out of their houses in Februarie, counterfet Wolues in a manner in all things, and all night doe nothing but runne into Church-yardes, and about graues, so as you shall presently discouer in them a wonderfull alteration of the braine, especially in the imagination and thought, which is miserably corrupted, in such sort, as the memorie hath some force: as I haue obserued in one of these melancholike Licanthropes, whom we call Wolues: for he that knew mee well, being one day troubled with his disease, and meeting me, I r

               tired my selfe a part, fearing that he should hurt me. Hauing eyed me a little, hee passed on, being followed by a troupe of people. Hee carried then vpon his shoulders the whole thigh and the legge of a dead man. Beeing carefully looked vnto, hee was cured of this disease. Meeting mee another time, hee asked mee if I had not beene afeard, when as hee incountred mee in

such a place, which makes mee to thinke that his memorie was not hurt nor impayred, in the vehemencie of his disease, although his imagination were much. DONAT de HAVTEMER, Chap. 9. of his Treatise of the cure of Diseases.
            
            WILLIAM of BRABANT writes in his Historie, that a man of a setled iudgement, was some-times so tormented with an euill spirit, that at a certaine season of the yeare, hee imagined himselfe to bee a rauening Wolfe, running vp and downe the Woods, Caues and Deserts, especially after young Children. More-ouer hee saith, that this man was often found running in the Desarts, like a man out of his wittes, and that in the end by the grace of GOD, hee came to himselfe againe, and was cured.
            There was also as IOB FINCEL reports, in his 2. Booke of Miracles, a Countri-man neere vnto Pauia, in the yeare 1541. who thought himselfe to bee a Wolfe, setting vpon diuers men in the fields, and slew some. In the end being with great difficultie taken, hee did constantlye affirme that hee was a Wolfe, and that there was no other difference, but that Wolues were commonlie hayrie without, and hee was betwixt the skinne and the flesh. Some (too barbarous and cruell Wolues in effect) desiring to trie the truth thereof, gaue him manie wounds vpon the armes and legges: but knowing their owne error, and the innocencie of the poore melancholie man, they committed him to the Surgions to cure, in whose hands hee dyed within fewe dayes after. Such as are afflicted with that disease, are pale, their eyes are hollow, and they see ill, their tongue is drye, they are much altered, and are without much spittle in

the mouth. PLINIE and others write, that the braine of a Beare prouokes brutish imaginations. And he saith, that in our time some made a Spanish Gentleman eate thereof, whose phantasie was so troubled, as he imagined that he was transformed it to a Beare, flying into the Mountaines and desarts. I. WIER, lib. 4. Chap. 13. Of Diuelish deuises.
            
            As for those Licanthropes, which haue the imagination so impayred and hurt, that besides by some particular power of Sathan, they seeme Wolues and not Men, to them that see them runne, doing great spoile. BODIN disputes very amply in his Demonomania. lib. 2. Chap. 3. where he maintaines, that the Diuell may change the figure of one body into another, considering the great power which GOD hath giuen him in this elementarie world. Hee maintaines that there be Licanthropes transformed really from Men into Wolues, alledging diuers examples and Histories to that purpose. In the end, after many arguments, hee maintaines the one and the other sort of Licanthropia. And as for this represented in the end of this Chapter, the conclusion of his discourse was, that men are some-times changed into Beasts, the humaine reason remaining: whether it bee done by the power of GOD immediatly, or that this power is giuen to Sathan, the executioner of his will, or rather of his fearefull iudgements▪ And if we confesse (saith he) the truth of the holy writte in DANIEL, touching the transformation of NABVCHODONOSER, and of the Historie of LOTS wife, changed into an immouable Piller, it is certaine, that the change of a Man into an Oxe, or into a Stone is possible, and by consequence possible into all other creatures. But for that BODIN cites PEVCER

touching the transformation of the Pilappiens, and doth not relate plainly that which he doth obserue worthy of consideration vpon that subiect, I will transcribe it as it is conteined in his learned worke, intituled. A Commentarie of the principall sorts of diuinations. lib. 4. Cap. 9. according to the French edition. In the ranke and number of Ecstatiques, are put those which they call Licaons and Licanthropes, which imagine themselues to bee changed into Wolues, and in their forme runne vp and downe the fields, falling vpon troopes of great and small Cattell, teare in peeces what they incounter, and goe roring vp and downe Church-yardes and Sepulchers. In the forth booke of HERODOTVS, there is a passage touching the Neuriens, a people of Scythia, who transformed them-selues into Wolues, the which hee saith, hee could not beleeue, not with-standing any report that was made vnto him. For my part, I haue held it fabulous and rediculous, that which hath beene often reported of this transformation of men into Wolues. But I haue learned by certaine and tryed signes, and by witnesses worthy of credit, that they be not things altogether inuented, and incredible, which are spoken of such transformations, which happen euery yeare twelue dayes after Christmas in Liuonia and the Countries thereabout: as they haue learned by their confessions which haue beene imprisoned and tormented for such crimes. Behold how they report it to be done. Presently after that Christmas day is past, a lame Boye goes through the Countrie, and calles the Diuels slaues together, being in great numbers, and inioynes them to follow him. If they staye any thing, then presently comes a great man, holding a whippe made of little chaines of Yron,

where-with he makes them to aduance, and some-times he handles these wretches so roughly, as the markes of his whippe sticke long by them, and puts them that haue beene beaten to great paine. Being vpon the way, behold they are all (as it seemes to them) changed and transformed into Wolues. They are thousands of them together, hauing for their conductor and guide this Whippe-carrier, after whom they marche, imagining that they are become Wolues. Beeing in the open champian Countryes, they fall vppon such troupes of Cattell as they finde, teare them in peeces, and carrye away what they can, committing many other spoiles: but they are not suffered to touche nor to hurt any reasonable creature. When they approche neere vnto any Riuer, their guide, (say they) deuides the water with his whippe, so as they seeme to open, and to leaue a drye path betwixt both to passe through. At the end of twelue dayes, all the troupe is dispersed, and euery one returnes vnto his house, hauing layde away his Wolues forme, and taken that of Man againe. This transformation (say they) is done after this manner. Those which are transformed fall sodenly to the ground, like vnto them that haue the Falling-sicknesse, and remaine like dead men, voyde of all feeling. They stirre not from thence, neither goe into any other place, neither are they transformed into Wolues, but are like vnto dead carcasses: for although you shake them and rowle them vp and downe, yet they make no shewe of life. From thence is sprung an opinion, that the soules taken out the bodyes, enter into these fantosmes or visions, running with the shapes of Wolues: then when the worke enterprized by the Diuell is finished, they

returne into their bodyes which then recouer life. The Licanthropes them-selues confirme this opinion, confessing that the bodyes doe not leaue their humaine forme, neyther yet receiue that of a Wolfe: but onelie that the soules are thrust out of their prisons, and flye into Wolues bodyes, by whom they are carryed for a time. Others haue maintained, that lying in Yrons in a Dungeon, they haue taken the forme of a Wolfe, and haue gone to finde out their companions many dayes iourney off. Beeing examined how they could gette out off a strong and close prison? Why they haue returned, and how they could passe ouer Riuers that were large and deepe? They answered, that no Yrons, walles, nor doores, could hinder their getting out: that they returned by constraint, and that they did flye ouer Riuers, and runne by land.
            Hetherto I haue set downe the wordes of Doctor PEVCER, the which shew, that this transformation of Licanthropes, nor that of Sorcerers mentioned by BODIN, haue no affinitie with the transmutation of the King of Babilon, nor with that of LOTS wife: and that in this Licanthropia, there are manifest illusions of Sathan, the which ought not to bee confounded with apparent testimonies of GODS visitation vpon some persons: as the Diuines which haue expounded these Histories, doe shewe more at large. Moreouer, IOHN WIER is of a contrary opinion vnto BODIN touching the Licanthropes whereof wee speake, and disputes at large thereof, in the sixt Booke of Diuelish Deuises, Chapter thirteenth and foureteenth: where hee manifestlie denyes BODINS reall transformation, and doth

maintayne that it is onely in the fantasie troubled by the indisposition of the person, and by the ill
                  •…
               sion of Sathan. But wee will leaue their controuersie to such as will looke into it, and will propound some examples touching mad-men. There are two kindes. Some growe so by the poyson of the melancholike humour, as well throughout all the bodie, as principally in the braine, the which beeing not redrest in time, simple melancholie becomes frenzie, that fu
                  •…
               y, and in the end rage, which is fearefull and not to bee cured, whereof M. PHTER SALIVS and MARCELLVS DONATVS learned Physitions do intreate, and propound some histories. Let vs speake after them, and serue them as an Interpreter to our French-men. It is a question if the venimous humor called Rage, the which breeds in so many sortes of creatures, which impart it vnto man, as we knowe, may beginne by man himselfe, and haue inward beginnings, without any accidentall contagion without. Reason makes vs to yeeld to this opinion, seeing that by the consent of all men, mortall poisons may be engendred within man: that rage should not bee excluded out of this ranke, man differing from a Serpent, which spitts poyson, no more then from other beastes, which are subiect vnto madnesse. But for that the Ancients for the most part haue held, that no man could growe madde, if hee had not beene toucht without by some other person or Beast that was madde it seemes wee should not lightly stray from their opinions, notwithstanding seeing that experience may resolue this difficulty, I will relate what mine eyes haue seene. A woman sixe and thirty yeares old, troubled with a continuall feuer, called me to helpe her. I found her seized of a pestilent ague, I gaue her

Physick, so as eleauen daies after shee was cured. Eleauen daies after that she was troubled with a greeuious flixe and an ague. I was called, and began to incounter this disease, the which I surmounted within seauen daies after. There remained yet some relikes of a feuer, the which seeking to take away, this woman fell so to abhorre all Liquors, as not onelie shee lothed all Physicall potions and all drinkes for her refection, but shee could not endure that anie one should drinke in her presence. I knewe by this accident alone that shee was toucht with rage, the which did so increase as shee could not endure they should bring any light into her Chamber: in regard of her feeding, detesting all drinkes and all liquid Physicke. And for that her feuer and the tediousnesse of her disease, would not suffer her to maintayne her selfe well with solide meates shee became exceeding feeble; but shee languished seauen dayes after that shee had begunne to reiect all drinke and Liquide notrishment. I found in her no other cause of defect, but onelie this disdaine of drinking and taking that which was Liquid. Neither did shee complaine of any thing, but when they presented it vnto her; then should you see her mooue her selfe, after a strange manner. Except this, it was a verie quiet infirmitie: and asking her if shee had euer beene toucht with the teeth of any madde Dogge, her answere was, that no Dogge had euer toucht her, hauing had none in her house, nor beene in companie where anie was. Hauing enquired of her Mother, if neuer Dogge had toucht her Daughter at anie time in all her life: shee assured mee no. This made mee to doubt, whether one by internall principles,

and of their owne corruption) might not become madde. For hauing in this infirmity no coniecture of Contagion without, and this feare of drinke and liquide things, beeing not conioyned with the accidents which are accustomed to accompanie them that are bitten with madde Beastes: I did coniecture that this disease grewe from some internall cause, which was not so violent, comming not by the outwards partes, through the byting of some enraged Beaste: if wee will not say that the force therof was quenched by the counterpoysons that were giuen her in the cure of her pestilent feuer: and by reason of her apparent and great euacuation of badde humours in the Dissenterie or fluxe. Besides this experience, I was confirmed by the authoritie of CAELIVS AVRELIANVS, writing that some-times one growes madde with out anie apparent cause: and by the Historie which SORANVS reports, saying that hee had seene an Infant which did abhorre the Nurces brests, without any precedent Contagion.

            It happened in the yeare 1573. In September, that GABRIEL NOVARE, a man of fiftie yeares of age and a widower, lyuing in the Duke of Mantouas Countrie, beeing at dinner, hee felt some-thing, hee knewe not what to grate his winde-pipe. Hee beganne to take the glasse to

Beeing angrie with him-selfe, hee runnes to a paile of Water to drinke with his hande; but approching to it with his mouth hee fell back-ward: hee riseth speedely, goes his way, and doth not suppe that

night. The next daie, both at dinner and at supper, hee feeles the like accident. The third daie hee came to mee on horse backe; and by the waie as hee rode hee did eate some store of grapes at his pleasure. Hauing vnderstood all from him, to knowe his greefe exactly, I offer to his mouth at two or three seuerall times, a glasse full of Water. I call my friendes to see and beholde this spectacle; at euery time his heart pantes and swells, hee trembles, hee faintes, and seemes like one that were strangled. When I drawe backe the glasse, hee recouers his spirrites, vnderstands and discourseth: shewes himselfe vigorous: hath no feuer: is without paine, all his functions are whole and perfect: onelie hee cannot drinke. I prescribed him counterpoysons; but within three daies hee dies, I serche, I sound, I consider all, yet finde no apparent cause of this Accident. MARCELLVS DONATVS lib. 6.

This paine ceased the third daie, but shee fell to haue a shaking ouer all the partes of her bodie, then she had a desire to vomit without any effect, she sweate and seemed as if she had beene smothered. When they presented vnto her any Wine, Water or any Coullis, then shee had Convulsions and fayntings: shee would eate egges and bread well. Her alteration was great; her principall faculties were whole and verie perfect, and so were her exterior

sences: her spirit was calme, and her speech milde. You would haue sayd she had had no feauer at all. The Surgion of the place made many diuulsions, yet she dyed the fift day. The same Author.

She did rise, being lame of her left arme: when any one did touche her, shee felt a paine in her side, as if one had stabd her to the heart with a Poynard, so as she would faint away. There was nothing omitted to ease her. The fourth day, a shaking doth force her to goe to bed: her paine encreaseth, she hath a desire to cast, shee turnes on euery side without staye, shee fomes at the mouth, shee can endure no light, shee weepes, cryes out, is amazed, and driues away all them of the house. They offer her drinke, she puls her head back, she abhorres drinke, falls into soundings, and yet some-times shee talkes sensibly, then afterwards shee begins to make a noyse with her teeth, failes of her speech, and giues vp the ghost the 5. day.

            In the yeare 1576. in Iune, DOMINIKE BERET, a Country-man, married, and a lustie able man 37 yeares old, felt for eight dayes together a paine in his arme, not knowing how this griefe came, yet he did not forbeate to worke, hauing no feauer. A day after (being the ninth) being desirous to haue a messe of Pottage to his supper, a shaking seized on him, so as hee went to bed without

any supper, about mid-night a feare seized on him, so as hee could not conteine himselfe, but amazed and starting vp, he cried out, and beganne to intreate them that were about him to hold him, and he for his part thought himselfe glued vnto them. Earely in the morning they go for Councell to a Physition that was neereby; who prescribed him to take a decoction of wilde Chichoree the which he vomited vp soone after that hee had taken it, with some cloddes of bloud as they sayd: comming to see him after dinner, I drewe them of the house apart, the Curate of the place, and others that were there assembled. I sayd vnto them, you shall presently see strange things; which is, that this patient will not drinke although you presse him, and if hee tries to do it, hee shall fall into a swone, and die presently. They brought him a glasse and offred him drinke; the which he refused with horror, and offring to force him, his heart fainted: wherat all were wonderfully amazed, and much more, when as they did see him foure houres after giuing vp the Ghost, after that hee had beene disquieted with an vnequall and inconstant trembling, hauing cried without ceasing, beene much distempered, and sweate all ouer great droppes but on the extremities which were colde, moreouer in a strange rauing, accompanied with diuilish apparitions, as he sayd.

            The eight of Aprill 1579. IAMES PIVE Laborer, a young man married, sound and stronge, comming out of the field to his house, without any apparent cause going before, beganne to sweate at night, and felt his heart, as it were pincht and full of paine. In the night hee did shake and tremble by fi

of the place gaue him earely in the morning a counterpoyson. Beeing called at night to see him, I knewe that it was a sharpe disease, and againe I did aduertise them which did assist him, that hee would abhor
                  •…
               e all kinde of drinke, and that vndoubtedly hee would soone die. The which was soone verified, for hauing drinke offred him, hee beganne to torment him-selfe and to faint away: the drinke being carried away, hee presently came againe to him-selfe. He couldnot endure any one to touch him, and if any one approched neere him, hee would crie out. They durst not (howe softly soeuer) wipe his face that sweate. Night being come hee would make his will, but the sweates and Convulsions which encreased, hindred him. Some houres after hee died in good sence. The same Author.
            
            There is an other kinde of rage proceeding of an externall cause, that is to say, of the byting of madde Beastes, whereof wee must speake some thing, and produce Histories according to our intention: to descouer our miseries more and more, and to induce vs to flie deuoutly to the mercifull protection of almightie GOD. Beholde what learned FERNELIVS saies, namely in respect of madde-dogges which bite men; a maddedogge in byting doth cast forth some spittle or venimous humor, the which peercing by the part that is toucht, doth sodenly corrupt the spirits, the bloud and the humors, then doth it slide by little and little into the principall partes, but so slowely as the disease is not descouered till three weekes after, some-times after a yeare, and that but doubtfully. During this respite of time, the patient feeles no feuer, nor any paine, hee feares not death at all, the which hee carries in his bowells.

But when the vennom by succession of time is come vnto the heart, all the other Noble partes are as is were tickled; the sicke man growes way-ward, he can neither stand nor sit; hee behaues himselfe like a madde-man▪ scratcheth his face, and bytes euery man, the foame comes out at his mouth, hee lookes wildly, is tormented with a great feuer, hee is extreamely altered and dry, yet hee doth so abhorre Water and all other Liquor, as hee had rather die then drinke or bee plonged in anie Riuer.

            This vennom is extreamely hot in the forth degree, as experience doth witnesse: for hauing one daie caused the bodie of a certaine man to bee opened, beeing dead of such an accident, they founde three remarkeble things. First there was no moysture at all in the mouth of the stomack to refresh the heart with all, but it had beene all consumed by this burning poyson. Secondly the ventricles of the heart were drie and without bloud. Thirdly they did obserue, that a peece of the mouth of the stomack was almost burnt and reduced to poulder. IEROSME CAPIVACCIVS lib. 7. of his practise Chap. 12.
            I haue seene a young Child, which neuer felt the hurt, nor complayned till eight monethes after the biting, but as soone as it descouered it selfe the Child died. FRACASTOR. lib. 2. of contagious diseases Chap. 10. Sometimes the biting is so sharpe and violent, togither with the apprehension of the parties offended, as death followes soone after, as I haue seene in many, namely in a Mint-man, called MARTIN BVTIN, and a

scholemaster named ROBERT. On a winter day about ten yeares since, going early in the morning from their houses, the one to worke at the Minte, the other to teach certaine schollers, they were one after an other bitten by a madde Dogge, and had much adoe to free them-selues from him. The same day they went to their bedds, and died within a while after in good sence, hauing had many trouble-some and pittifull fitts. The one was my Neighbour, and I did often visit him: hee tooke delight to heare talke of his Saluation, and died most Christian-like, and so did the other. But my Neighbour at my comming in vnto him cryed out that I should not come neere him, if I would not haue him bite mee. Once not thinking of it, for the compassion I had of his torment, (for some-times hee did houle like vnto a Dogge,) approching neerer vnto him then I was accustomed, he sodenly reacht out to get holde of mine arme with his teeth: whereof he fayled, for that his motion was not so quicke as mine. Hepresently acknowledged his error, and asked me forgiuenesse, imputing it to the vehemencie of his paine. As often as I thinke of that which I did see in the sicknesse of these two good men, so often doth my Soule tremble, crying out. Lord thou hast beene our refuge from one generation to another. &amp;c.

Hee would by no meanes drinke: and as wee did enquire of the cause of his sicknesse, those which did tend him did confesse, that hee had kist a certaine Dogge of his, which hee loued verye well, before hee sent him to be drowned, for that hee was madde. Hee dyed the next day, as I had fore-told. CARDAN in the first Treatise, lib. 2. contradict. 9.
            A Peasant become madde, and hearing that hee had not long to liue in the world, made great instance to them that kept him, and held him straightly bound (for hee had some quiet seasons, during the which hee spake sencibly) that hee might bee suffered once to kisse his children for his last farewell. This beeing granted him, he kissed his children, and so dyed: but the seuenth day following, his children became madde, and after sundry torments, they dyed as their Father had done.

I haue obserued that the biting of mad Wolues causeth Beasts to die presentlie, that are toucht with their teeth, Maister PAVMIER in his Treatise of Contagious Diseases. Many haue noted that Wolues although they bee not madde, yet (by reason of their furie and ordynarie vyolence, which appeares by their sparkling eyes, and their insatiable deuouring) they make the flesh of Beasts, which they bite or kill, to be very dangerous, if it bee kept any time▪ A famous Prince did sweare vnto mee, that one of his Pages hauing found at a certaine Gentlemans house, a Rapier hidden vnder a bed, where-with some yeares before they had slaine a madde Dogge, hee intreated him to giue it him: which done, going about to make it cleane, and to scowre it, beeing rustie in diuers places, by mischance hee hurte himselfe a little in one of his fingers, where-of hee fell madde, and dyed before they could fore-see and preuent the danger.

            In the same place hee propounds diuerse remedies against the biting of a mad Dogge, the which he thinks auaileable, if any one of them be vsed presently: and hee saith, that hee hath cured many that haue beene so bitten. Among others, he specifieth this example following. One of the Daughters of Mistresse GRONBORNE at Paris, was bitten with a madde Dogge, in the middest of her right legge, where the Dogge set his teeth very deepe into the flesh, the which was cured. Among all remedies, Treacle (saith he) is singular, causing it to be dissolued in Aqua-vite, or in Wine, and then rubbing the place therewith hard, vntill it bleed: then you must leaue within it Linte dipte in the sayd mixture, and vpon the wound apply Garlike or Onions, stampt or beaten with ordinarie Honie and Turpentine.

Hee sayd that hee had learned it of a Frenchman his Schoole-maister, and in fewe dayes hee made FRANCIS de MOVLIN a Venetian Gentleman, to learne his skill, who before had the weakest memorie that might bee found.

When hee was demanded by many, of diuerse things, whereof he had not read any thing many yeares before, yet hee answered directly to euery thing, as if at that instant hee had read the words and sentences in a Booke. If at any time they spake vnto him of the same thing: but handled by diuers Authors, he spake plainely, but in such sort as hee did propound distinctly, and worde by worde, all that the Greeke and Latin Authors, Philosophers, Orators, Poets, and Historians doe say, with-out equiuocating, coating the Bookes, passages, Chapters and Sections of euery one, to the great amazement of all them that heard him.

There was a Lucquois merchant, who hauing lien in England a long time, and desiring to end his daies amongst his friends, requested them by letters to prouide him a house, for that hee meant to see them within six moneths at the farthest. About the same time he parts from England, followed by a seruant of his a French-man, with al his papers &amp; obligations, and comes to the Citty of Roan, where after he had made a little stay, he takes his way for Paris: but being on the mountaine neere to Argentueil, his man, fauored by the raine &amp; foule weather that was at that time, murthered him, and threwe his body into the vignes. As this was a doing, a blind man came by, led by his dogge, and hearing one grone, asked who it was? whervnto the murtherer answered, that it was a sick man going to ease himself. The blinde man went his way and the seruant with his Maisters money and papers gets him to Paris where he takes vp a good round sum vpon

his Maisters billes &amp; obligations: this merchant is expected at Luca a whole yeare togither, and seeing that hee came not, a fellow was dispatched away expresly to seeke him out; comming to London he vnderstood the time of his departure, &amp; that he was boūd for Roan; there also in one of the Innes hee was told that about 6. moneths before a Lucquois merchant had lien there, &amp; was gone to Paris. After that what enquiry soeuer hee made, hee was neuer the neerer, nor by any meanes could heare any tidings of that he sought. Wherepon he cōplained to the Court of Parliament at Roan, which began to embrace this affaire, commanding the Lieutenant cryminall to make diligent search within the Citty &amp; Monsieur BIGOT without. The first thing the Iustice did, was to will one of his officers to enquire vp and downe the towne whither there were any man that within 7. or 8. monthes before had set vp a new shop. The fellow failes not in his charg, but returning saies he met with one, of whō hauing learned the name, the iustice supposeth an obligatiō, wherby this new merchāt binds himself body &amp; goods to pay the sum of 200. crownes within a certaine time, &amp; by vertue thereof, being wild to pay the money, hee answered that the bond was forged, for he owed no such debt. The Sergeant taking this answere for a refusall, arrested him. and as they went along togither, the merchant happened to tel him that hee would answere this well enough: but is there no other matter sayd hee? The Sergeant goes and reportes how all had past to the Iustice, who taking hold of those words, whither there were no other matter, cō
               manded the prisoner to be brought before him: beeing come, he made the roome to be voided, and with gentle speech told him, that hee had sent away the rest, because

he meant to deale kindly with him: that in truth he had caused him to bee arrested vpon a supposed obligation, but that there was another matter in the winde. For hee knew for certaine, that the murther of the Luequois was committed by him, and thereof good proofe was to bee made, how-be-it hee desired not to take any rigorous course: that the dead man was a stranger, altogether without friends, and therefore it was an easie matter to bury all things in obliuion, so that the prisoner would be wise, and do that which was fitting for him-selfe. All this was spoken in such a fashion, as if the Iustice had gone about to draw mony from him. Herewith the prisoner solicited partly by the remorse of his conscience, partly by the hope he had to cleere himselfe by a bride, answered the Iudge, that herein appeared the very hand of GOD, seeing there was no other witnesse but himselfe, and yet the matter was come to light, and that vpon the promise which had been made him, he would freely confesse the truth. Thervpō the Iudge thinking he had got his desire, sent one for the Register. In the meane time the prisoner perceiuing he had plaid the foole, when the Iudge would haue had him confesse the murther, he began to change his coppy, and maintaine that all this proceeding was ful of slander and falshood. The Iustice being som-what frustrated of his hope, sends the Merchant to prison, in expectation of more ample proofe. But hauing had conference with other prisoners, who are craft masters in such affaires, he appeales from his imprisonment, &amp; s
                  •…
               es both the Sargiant &amp; the Iustice. I leaue you to thinke whether the cause were without apparance of reason. Forgery is obiected against the obligatiō, &amp; there needs no proofe, for it is confessed. And indeed the Iustice went directly

to the Parliament, where he discoursed at large how all things had beene carried. The Court being well assured of the honesty of the Iustice, suspended the course of this sute for a time. In the meane space Monsieur BIGOT had incharge, to make enquirie all the way betweene Rouan and Paris, to see if he could come by any notice of the matter: which hee executed with all diligence. At length passing by Argentueil, the Bayliffe tolde him, how not long before, they had found a dead carcasse in the Vines, halfe eaten with Dogs and Crowes. Ther-withall came the blind man a begging to the Inne where BIGOT lay, and vnderstanding the perplexitie they were in, told them all that hee had heard about the same time on the Mountaine. BIGOT asked him, whither he could know the voyce againe? The other answered him, that hee thought he should. Whervpon he set him vp on an horse behind another, &amp; rode away with him to Rouan, where being alighted, and hauing giuen an accompt of his cō
               mission, the Court determined to heare what the blinde man could say, and after to confront him with the prisoner. Hee hauing then discoursed at full all that past in his hearing on the Mountaine, &amp; the answer that was returned him, being demanded, whether hee could know the voyce againe? he replied that he did not thinke but hee could. Therwith they shewed him a far of to the prisoner, &amp; asked him, when the blind man was gone, whither he could take any exception against him. GOD knows what a case he was in then. For he said, that there had neuer bin such deuises practised to impeach the innocency of an honest man, as there had bin against him. First the Iustice by vertue of a false obligation to lay him in prison: then to make him beleeue how hee had confessed that which

neuer did: and last of all, to bring in a blind man for a witnes against him, why it was pastal rules of cōmon sence.
            Notwithstanding that, the Court seeing he had nothing els to say against him, caused 20. men &amp; aboue to speake one after another, &amp; still as they spake, the blind man was asked whither he knew their voices, whervnto he replied that it was none of them. At last when the prisoner had spoken, the blind man said, that that was he which answered him on the Mountaine. The same confusion of voyces hauing been two or three times reiterated, the blind man hit alwaies on the right, and neuer missed. Take all the accidents of this processe seuerally, and you shall find many that make for the prisoner. But when you haue thoroughly considered the contrary, there are a number of circumstances which make against him: a new Cittizē which had set vp a new shop a little after the Lucquois disapearing, the honesty of the Lieutenant knowne to all men, the deposition by him and the Sergeant made: but especially the miraculous encounter of the blind man, who was both at the murther, as afterward in the Inne where BIGOT lay: &amp; finally that without any fraud he had discerned the murtherers voyce from many others. All these things duely weighed, were cause of the wretched mans condemnation: who before he was executed, confessed all, to the discharge of the Iudges consciences. E. PASQVIER in 5. booke des Recerches of France. Chap. 20.
            On Christmas eue 1551. a certaine fellow brained a yong woman with an Hammer, hard by Saint Oportunes Church in Paris, as she was going to mid-night Masse, &amp; tooke away her rings. The Hammer was stolne the same euening from a poore Smith there-by, who therefore suspected of the murther, was very cruelly handled, and

put to an extraordinary kinde of torture, by reason of the violent presumptions that made against him. In such sort that he was quite lamed, &amp; depriued of the meanes to get his liuing, where-by reduced into extreame pouerty, hee made a miserable end. The murtherer remained almost 20. yeares vnknowne, and the memory of the murther seemed to be buried with the poore woman in her graue. Now marke how it came out at length, though it were long first. IOHN FLAMENG Sergeant of the subsidies at Paris, that was afterward chiefe Vsher in the Court of Aydes, being one day in the Summer at Saint Leups, a village by Montmorency, whether he was sent to sit vpon a Cōmission, chanced among other talke at supper, to say before certaine of the place, how hee had left his wife at home sick, and no body with her but a little boye. There was an old mā then present named MOVSTIER, &amp; a sonne in-law of his: who immediately vpon this speach went away that night, with each of them a basket of Cherries, and a greene Goose, and came about ten of the clock the next morning to FLAMENGS house: where knocking, the woman looked out at the window, and asked who it was. They answered that her husband had sent her a greene Goose, and a basket or two of Cherries, wherevpon the dore being opened to them by the boye, they clapped it too againe, and cut his throat. The poore childe strugling with them, the woman heard the noyse, and stept out into a gallery ioyning to her Chamber, to see what it was, where perceiuing a streame of bloud in the yarde, one of them told her that it was the bloud of the Goose: In the meane time the other ranne vp the stayres thinking to surprise her. She mistrusting the truth of the matter, got back againe into her Chamber, bolted the doore within

and cryed out of the windoe for helpe saying there were theeues in her house. The two wretches, seeing they had fayled of there purpose, would haue got away, but going to vnclocke the gate, they brake the key in the locke. So that hauing no meanes to scape, they went to hide them selues. The youngest climbed vp into the funnell of a chimney, the old man cōueied himselfe into the bottom of a celler. There-with the neighbors came running to the house, &amp; breaking open the dore, found the boy lying dead in the yard, where-vpon they sought vp and downe euery corner for the murtherers; he in the chimney was taken first, and the other after long search was found in the well of the cellar with nothing but his nose aboue water. They were straight way caried to prison, and shortly after arraigned and condemned to death. Being on the scaffold at the place of execution, the old man desired to speake with the Smiths widdowe, of whom mention was made at the beginning. When she came he asked her forgiuenes, and told her it was he that killed the young woman by S. Oportunes Church. This confession of his being committed to record, they were executed as they deserued. E. PASQVIER in the same booke and Chapter.
            
            Eleven or twelue Danysh gentlemen being in talke togither one euening in a stoue, fel to some hot words among themselues, which at length grew to such termes, that the candles sudenly were put out, &amp; one of thē was stabbed with a poygnard &amp; killed. Amongst those gentlemen was a Pursiuant of the Kings. Now the murtherer was vnknowne, by reason of the nomber, although the gentlemen accused the pursiuant for it, but the King would not beleeue them, saying they had conspyred against

his seruant. In this perplexitie the King caused them to come altogether into the stoue, and standing round about the dead corps, he commanded that they shold one after another lay there right hand on the slaine gentlemans naked brest, swearing they had not killed him. The Gentlemen did soe, and no signe apeared to witnes against them. The Pursiuant onely remayned who condemned before in his owne conscience, went first of all and kissed the dead Mans feete: but assone as he layd his hand on his brest the blood gushed forth in great abundance, both out of his wound and nosthrills: so that vrged by this euident accusation, he confessed the murther, and by the Kings owne sentence was incontinently beheadded. HENRY RANSOVIVS Liuetenant for the King of Denmarke in the duchy of Holsace makes this relation in a letter of his that is now in print: &amp; farther addeth, that the King his maister reported this history to him, and to VLRIC his sonne in lawe Duke of MECKELEOVRG with these words: Some of the gentlemen accused of this murther are still liuing, this first day of Iuly. 1591. And how that euer since the execution of the Pursiuant, King CHRISTIERNVS 2. Permitted that ouer al his Kingdome vnknowne murthers shold be sought out after that manner.
            I will ad another example (saith he) in the same letter written to DAVID CHYTREVS which happened at ITZEHOVV in Demnarke in my Fathers time. A Traueller was murthered by the high way side and be-cause the Murtherer could not bee found out, the magistrates of Itzehow made the body to be taken vp, and an hand to be cut of, which was caryed into the prison of the towne, and hung vp by a string in one of the chambers. About ten yeares after, the murtherer comming

vpon some occasion into the prison, the hand which had bene a long time dry began to droppe blood on the table that stood vnderneath it. The laylor beholding so extradinary a thing stayed the fellowe, and aduerty sed the magistrates of it, who examining him in the presence of my Father, the murtherer giuing glory to God, confessed the murther which hee had commited so many yeares before, and submitted himselfe to the rigor of the lawe which was inflicted on him as he well deserued.

               Tubingue, a certain traueller cōming into an Inne, &amp; talking at table of the iourney hee had to go, asked the Host of the house if he knewe of any that went his way, because hee was affrayd hee should not hit it: where-vpon another ghest that sate at table with him, said, how he was going to the place he spake of, &amp; knew all the wayes of the forrest through which they were to passe. Trauailing together in the wood the latter thinking to make some great purchase fell vpon the other &amp; killed him. But finding little about him, hee returned heauy and sighing to the same Inne from whence they parted. Presently after, the bruit went of a man that was found murthered in the Forrest. And because the Murtherer discouered himselfe sufficiently by his sighes, hee was apprehended and beeing examined, confessed the fact, for the which he was put to death. PH. LONICER in his

Where-vpon it seemed to all that met him in the streete that they were mens heads which hee carried in the net, so that diuers ranne and aduertised the Magistrates of it, who straight way sent some of their Sergeants, and commanded them to apprehend him

The Butcher was sent for, who affirmed that those which he sold him were Calues heads &amp; no other. The Magistrates amazed with this prodegie sent the buyer to prison: where going to bee tortured, hee confessed his murthers: which was no sooner done but presently the three heads taken out of the net returned to their former shape, and the murtherer was executed according to his demerits.

            A learned Diuine of our time recytes such another History as that of IBICVS. For he saith that an Almaign trauelling a iourney fell among Theeues, who going to cut his throat, the poore man espied a flight of Crowes and said, O Crowes I take you for witnesses and reuengers of my death. Hee had no sooner said so but he was murthered by the theeues; who drinking two or three daies after in an Inne, a company of Crowes came and lighted on the top of the house. Where-vpon the theeues began to laugh and saye one to an other, looke yonder are they that must reuenge his death whom wee dispatched the other daye. The Tapster ouer-hearing them told his Maister, who reported it to the Magistrate.

                  , resolued to depart from the said army. Now because there was no safer nor nearer way for him then to crosse the lake to Bonne, which might very well bee performed in three houres at the most (whereas he should haue beene a day and a halfe going by the bridge of Chancy and that with danger) hee went to one of his acquaintance named IOHN VILLAIN of the Village of Thaney in the Bayliwicke of Nyon, hard by the towne of Coppet, and desired him to helpe him to some that would carry him ouer the lake. VILLAIN went along with him to Coppet, where one of the best of the Towne had the Gentleman to a Tauerne, and there it was agreed that two water-men of the place, which were present, should carry him ouer. Wher-vpon he went back to Thaney for his horse, apparell and other things. Being returned &amp; in the boat crossing the lake, the said water-men, whereof the cheefest was called MARTIN BOVRRY, fell vpon him and cut his throat. VILLAIN vnderstanding it &amp; cōplaining of so cruell a treachery, was answered, that it was an enemy whō they had dispatched. The murtherer fearing to bee called in question about it, to preuent the matter made a present of the Gentlemās horse which was of great value to a certaine Maister and kept the rest to himselfe. insomuch that the murther was neuer spoken afterward, neither durst VILLAIN vse many words about it, for feare of him-self. But God would not leaue it so vnpunished. For about the 15. of Iuly 1591. this BOVRRY going with diuers others of Coppet to shoot for a wager, as he was charging the harguebuze which he had robbed the Gentleman of when he murthered him, it sodainly discharged of it selfe &amp; shot the murtherer through the heart, so that hee fell

downe starke dead, and neuer stirred nor spake a word. This relation I receiued from VILLAINS owne mouth.
            
            In the first troubles a Gentleman of the troups which beseeged Moulins in Burbonnois was taken sicke in such sort that he could not follow his cōpany when they dislodged: and lying at a Bakers house called IOHN MON which professed much friendship and kindnes vnto him, he put such confidence in him, that he stayed behind the rest, hauing shewed his host the money that he had, who promised to defend him from all men, together with a little brother of his some 13. or 14. yeares old. But so far was this wretch from keeping his promise, that contrarily as soone as it was night, he trayned them forth of dores, and most wickedly murthered them. Now marke howe God reuenged it: it happened not long after that the murtherer being in sentinell, one of his fellowes not thinking of it, shott him through the arme with an Harguebuze wherof he languished the space of 3. months, &amp; thē died stark mad.

            The towne of Bourges beeing yeelded by Mons. d'Tuoy during the first troubles, those that held it before were inhibited frō talking together either within or without the towne, or from beeing aboue two together at a time. Amongst them that tooke pleasure (vnder colour of this ordinance) to murther such as they met talking together, there was one named GARGET captaine of the Bourbonne quarter, which made a cōmon practise of it, who shortly after taken with a burning feauer ranne vp &amp; downe the streets, blaspheming the name of God, calling vpon the Diuel, &amp; crying out, if any one would go along with him to hell, he would pay his charges, &amp; so dyed in desperate and frantike manner.

This Lord commanded one of his Faulconers to go and execute this sentence vpon payne to bee drowned himselfe. Where-vpon hee performed it: but GOD deferred not the reuenge there-of long, for within three dayes after, this Falconer &amp; a Lackey falling out about the good mans apparel went into the field &amp; slew one another. Which being reported to the Lord (a most vnrighteous iudge) it compelled him to haue some remorse, and to say openly, that he would it had cost him fiue hundred crownes, the poore Querie had not beene drowned. But it was too little, for to value the life of an innocent man at. In the same historie, book. 7.
            Certaine troupes of Peasants of Coulours, Ceresiers, and other places in Champagne, hauing committed many murthers and spoyles in sundrye places, were heere and there defeated and came very neere al of them to violent ends during the first troubles. I will note two notable particularities here touching two of those troupes One going to set fire on an house, fel down starke dead, beeing killed with the shot of an Harguebuze vnaduisedly discharged by one of his fellowes. Another dragging a poore Man and his Wife to a post for to haue them shot to death, receiued also a shot from an Harguebuze which tooke away his life and so his prisoners escaped. In the same booke.

            Persons that liued a long time without eating or drinking.
            
               MAister GERARD de BVCOLD Physition to FERDINAND afterwards Emperor, testifieth in a booke imprinted both in Latin and Dutch, that the yeare 1539. in a village by Spyre there was one namaed MARGARET the Daughter of SOFREY VVEIS &amp; BARBARA his wife, which at 18. years of age beeing taken about the ende of September with a little paine in her head and belly, began to lose all appetite to meate, wherein she continued till the end of the yeare: when hauing recouered some stomack, she made a meale or two: but euer after ceased altogither from eating, and drunke very little. After Easter the yeare following she refused to drinke, insomuch that in the greatest heate of summer shee neuer dranke: wherevpon it ensued that shee neither voided vrine nor other excrement. FERDINAND then King of Romains desired to see her, &amp; to preuent all fraude made her to be carefully kept and looked vnto by the sayd de BVCOLD, who hath made this relation confirmed by diuers other wittnesses. A Nunne of Saint BARBARAS couent at Delft, falling sick of the yellow Iaundise, the yeare 1562. kept her bed sixe weekes togither without eating or drinking. Al that time she neuer touched any sustenance what-soeuer, vnlesse it were a fewe kernells of a limond, which shee held in her mouth &amp; now &amp; then sucked them a little. The confessor

of the Covent, carried me thether, not to giue her any Physick but to see her as a miracle, by reasō of so long an abstinence. The day after I had seene her, she departed this world. Now this which I will ad is worthy of greater meruaile. In the same Towne of Delft about Maie 1566. being accompanied with a Chirurgion, I visited a certaine sick maide, of 27. yeares of age or thereabout. She had kept her bed euer since she was sixteene yeares old, eating nothing all that time as her keeper affirmed, but once a day a little morcell of drie Cheese: Neither was it possible to make her take any kinde of drinke, and yet she made Water reasonable well, although she went to the stoole but once in eight daies. Moreouer she was borne blinde, and at 20. years of age had the dropsie, but that Water vanishing away, insteed thereof, shee had a noise in her belly like the croaking of a number of liue Frogs, accompanied with a wonderfull heauing and setting of her belly, insomuch that doe what I could, my hand layd vpon it was lifted vp a good height. This motion encreased with grieuous paines at the full of the moone and flowing of the sea: but at the wane of the moone &amp; ebbing of the sea she felt some ease: &amp; so it cō
               tinued with her 7. years, hauing her sicknesse euery tenth weeke as her keeper confessed. P. FORREST Physition in the 18. booke of his Obseruations, Obser. 8.
            A gentleman, that hath worthely acquited himselfe in sundry charges, said in a place where I was, that he had gone frō 
               Madril to Lisbon, in the hottest of sūmer, without drinking. He beares himselfe passing well for one of his age, &amp; hath nothing extraordinary in the vsage of his life, but this, to be 2. or 3. moneths, nay a yeare, as he hath told mee, without drinke. Hee feeleth thirst, but lets it

passe, and hee thinkes it is an appetite that easily goes away of it selfe &amp; drinks more for company, then necessity or pleasure. MICHAEL de MONTAGNE, in the 3. booke of his Essaies, the last Chap. Asmuch is reported of a great Lord in France, who hath gone Embassador to Rome, and is stil liuing in other honorable emploiments. There haue beene many persons both before and in our time which haue fasted very long: but hauing no example more remarkeable amongst many others then that which by &amp; by I purpose to propound, we wil leaue the Reader to the remembrance of such as hee hath either seene or heard it of himselfe. In the meane time wee will present this which ensueth. On Tuesday the 24 day of Nouember 1584. by the cōmandement of the most illustrious Prince IOHN CASIMIR County Palatine of Rine, the gouernor and superintendant of Caiserlanter, accompanied with HENRY SMETIVS and IOHN IAMES Theodore, Doctors of Physick, made enquiry in the village of Schinidweiler in the iurisdiction of Colberberg, touching the Maide whose history we relate.
            KVN TONNELIER borne at Spisheim, an honest husbandman, being examined by those cōmissaries, among other articles affirmed that KATHERINE, at that instant some 27. years of age, Daughter to him and to his Wife likewise named KATHERIN, hauing alwaies had her health, til such time as she began to haue her monethly purgatiōs, at her returne from a certaine wedding caught an ague, which tooke away all appetite from her to hot meats for the space of fiue years togither, during which time shee felt her selfe well and lusty, did her worke, was very obedient to her parents, deuout in praier vnto GOD, well affected to the hearing of his word and throughlie

instructed therein. Now to bring her to hot meates againe, her father and mother (besides other ordinary medicines) put her into the hands of an Empyrike, who in steed of helping her with a certaine drinke, quite tooke away her stomach from al meates both hot and cold: insomuch that till then, namely for the full terme of seauen yeares, no meate nor drinke whatsoeuer went downe the throate of this maide: who for six moneths after the disgust onely sucked the Iuice of a fewe peares and apples. But not able to vse this remedy any longer, shee washed her mouth with aqua-uitae, but could not swollow a drop of it. This lauing some-what refreshed her: but being to sharpe, she allaied it with a little faire Water. Her father added, that all this time he could neuer perceiue any euacuation of vrine or other excrement in the said maide, or swete, or vermine in any parte of her bodie: but alwaies found her bedde cleane, and her body without spot or speck of filth: vnlesse it were that some-times shee seemed to bee troubled with a distillation of the braine, which nowe and then made her to spit a little. And many times a certaine vapor rose in her side which fumed vp to the heart, and caused a paine in her head, that made her very faint for the time, but it lasted not long, and that onely against foule weather. The sight or sauor of meates neuer offended her, though shee had no appetite nor desire at all to them. If at any time shee chanced to faint, shee rubbed her temples and stomach with a little sweete Water: which very much comforted her. The deposition of the mother and neighbors agreed in all pointes heere-with.
            The same KATHERINE visited by the Princes foure Commissaries, was found faire of face, well colloured,

full of life and good disposition, her eyes cleare, and quick sighted, like one in perfect health, saue that they were some-what sunke into her head, and that vnderneath them some times rose a tumor which continued not long. Neither had shee any defect in her sences of smelling, hearing, and tasting. Her speach was sweete, significant and intelligible. Only her mouth was growne so straight by reason of her cheekes which very much pained her (as she said her selfe) that she could not put so much as her little finger into it: but yet without apparance of swelling. Her haire was all falne off of her head and began to come againe. In this sicknesse or infirmity, she had scarce had any speach or sence for three yeares together. But the Thursday before Easter 1583. she recouered her speech and sences, much better then euer she had had them at any time in her health before, and that after an admirable manner, as followeth.
            Her Father being gone about that time to a Forrest hard by the village for to fell Timber, and her Mother hauing shut all the dores for to go to him, and left their Daughter in the house alone by her selfe: a Man in the habit of a Minister, entred into the Stoue, went to the beds side, tooke the Maide by the left arme, lifted her vp, and staying her, made her walke a turne or two: and then asked her if she could pray. KATHERINE somewhat amazed with this demand, could not answer him, being speachlesse. Hee began then to rehearse the ten commandements in the vulgar tongue, the Articles of our faith, the Lords Prayer, the institution of Baptisme, and of the holy Supper: exhorting her besides to patience, comforting and assuring her, that her speach should shortly be restored to her againe. Wherevpon he

suddenly departed from her▪ and immediatly her speach came to her againe, so that her Mother being returned home, the Maide talked plainly and intelligibly with her, and afterwards with her Father, whereat they were both merueilously abashed. After that time, her speach and sences neuer failed her.
            The report of the Physitions yet farther conteineth this ensuing, which I adde for the content of the Reader. Touching that which concerneth her brest or stomach, she hath a very sweete breath, her pulce is temperate, and as it should be, but before &amp; behind her arme-pits, both aboue and below, she is some-what faint. Her brests are longer, softer, and hanging downe more then commonly Maidens doe. She many times feeles a paine in both her sides, which brings her into such a case, that she can hardly fetch her breath, but it is quickly gone by the application of a little water. One cannot touch the pit of her stomach, but it greeues her. As for her belly it hangs some▪ what lanke like an empty body: but on the out-side it is in pritty good plight, and is reasonable fat and fleshy: she is neuer troubled with any wind or collick, nor feeles any hickock, stitch, or other paine in her stomach. And although she hath often-times of her owne accord, without constraint or necessitie, endeuoured to take and swallow downe meate, yet could she neuer doe it, albeit she can abide the sent of meates, and endure that one should eate and drinke by her, but more at some-times then at other-some. For she hath been and still is, as if her throatboll were quite closed vp, &amp; altogether stopped she goes not to the stoole, nor hath vrine or monethly purgations, which she hath had for a certaine time together perfectly and duely before her infirmity, but now they are cleane

gone. In like manner, she is neuer a thirst, yet some-times she takes a little faire water &amp; Aqua vitae mingled together, for to wash her mouth, and spets it out againe presently. The which she was wont to doe with Aqua vitae alone, but now she cannot endure it, being too sharpe &amp; strong in her mouth which is very tender, &amp; this she does only for the recreation and comfort of her head &amp; heart. Touching her armes and legs, her armes are sound and fleshy: especially her left arme is nimble &amp; in good case, without any defect. But as for her right arme, it is lame from the elbow to the fingers ends, whereby her hand is growne crooked, so that shee cannot stirre it. Not-withstanding shee can moue the said right arme a little vp toward the shoulder, but cannot lift it to her head, nor put it from one side to the other, with-out helpe. Her legges and thighes are some-what full and fleshy, but are so shrunke, that she cannot stretch them forth at length, &amp; yet she can moue her toes and her feet a little. Her sayd arme became lame so, &amp; her legs crooked by lying in her bed three yeares together, without eating any thing. Throughout all her body is a temperate and kindly heat. The nailes of her feete and hands are well formed, long, and in good disposition, like one in perfect health.
            The Physitions hauing made this report, &amp; euery thing well examined and considered: the Commissaries were of opinion for diuers reasons, that 4. women of good discretion, and fit for such a businesse, should be chosen and sent to Schimdweiler to keepe this Maide by turnes, two by day, and two by night, for the space of a fortnight, to the end no meate nor drinke what-so-euer might be ministred to her by any person: &amp; that the bed whereon she lay, should be changed, and another put in the place of it,

and that diligent search should bee made ouer all the Stoue. The Maide her-selfe had declared, that diuers men and women had resorted to her out of the Bishoprick of Treues, and questioned her about reuelations and predictions. More-ouer there were letters found written to her, as it had beene to an holy Virgin, the intent of the writers being to make an Idoll of her, and to erect a pilgrimage vnto her. Wherefore the Commissaries made report of all before mentioned, to the Gouernor of Neustad and the Princes Councell, who shortly after gaue Commission to the Gouernor of Caiserlauter, to take order for this affaire, where-vnto hee obeyed with all diligence, and thereof made his report, which I copied ouer being translated out of Dutch, in the termes ensuing.
            Following your Commission of the 24. of December 1584. directed vnto vs, touching the affaires of the Maiden of the village of Schmidweiler, we haue made diligent inquisition for foure honest women, &amp; it was a long time ere wee could finde any that would employ them-selues in such an affaire, vntill at length we haue therevnto induced and perswaded ANNE BRENNING, the widow of ANDREVV ZILS late of this towne, other-wise called the old ioyner: ANASTASIA widdow to IOHN EBERARD, in his life time Minister of Walhalben. AGNES the Ministers wife of Steinwerden: and MARGARET the widdow of IOHN GAVFFEN whilst hee liued Burgesse of this Towne. And after they were thoroughly instructed and informed of their charge, according to the tenor of the aduise which at the beginning was sent to his Highnesse, and that they had all foure taken their oath, wee sent them on the 16. daye of Ianuary last past, to the sayd place of Schimdweiler, with Maister LOLEMAN the

superintendant, where they remained with the sayde Maide vntill the 8. day of the same moneth: being returned back againe, the next day they discoursed at large vnto vs, all that they had learned, discouered and experimented touching this affaire as followeth.
            The said Superintendant being arriued about euening the first day, with the foure women afore mentioned at Kolberberg, there they rested that night, and the next day went by Waggon to Schimdwailer, where going to the Father and Mother, they gaue them to vnderstand, how by the commandement of the Gouernours they were come thither, with charge to keepe their Daughter for a fortnight together. And that to no other end, but to stop the mouthes of such as on euery side spake ill of their Daughter, and of the Prince likewise, because hee gaue credit to their said Daughters speeches, to wit, that in so long a time she had neither eaten nor drunke▪ briefly it was to no other purpose, but that once for all, the world might be assured of the truth. There-vnto the Father and Mother gladly submitted themselues, and with kinde entertaine carried thē to their Daughters chamber, where the Superintendant spake in the same manner to the Maide, as they had done before to her Father &amp; Mother, and shewed her at large the occasion of their comming. Where-vpon the Maide began to complaine &amp; demand for what cause they would molest and trouble her so. Especially she seemed to be very much grieued, for that her Father and her Mother should not lye in her Chamber by her as they had accustomed to doe: but incontinently after the departure of the Superintendant, ANNE BRENNING dealt in such sort with the said Maide, that she willingly agreed to what-soeuer they would, and not onely

permitted them to carry away the bed where vpon her Father and Mother lay: but also suffered them to visit her owne bed, nay to take it quite away, and make her another in a little Stoue, where was no roome for her Father and Mother to lye. And when in the day time they entred into the Chamber, they came not neere their Daughter, nor talked with her in secret. Now during this fortnight, the foure womē vnderstood of them how this Maides sicknesse first began, and how many yeares she had p
                  •…

                  •…
               ies. Likewise the said women found that the said Maide is at some-times weaker and fainter then at other some, and they haue alwayes watched with her, two by day, and two by night. And for a more exact assurance of the truth, one of the foure lay euery night with the said Maide in her bed, so that by no meanes any fraud could happen, where vnto they alwaies tooke very diligent heed, and watched very carefully both day &amp; night, but neuer could finde any other thing, then as the saide Maide had still before very truely affirmed of her selfe. Furthermore, all the said foure women, especially ANNE BRENNING, haue confessed before vs, and sollemnly affirmed and assured vpon the saluation of their soules, and therein will dye, that the saide Maide hath not eaten nor drunke, either morcell or drop of any thing what-soeuer. Neither hath vo

               ded any Vrine or other execrement, nor slept a whit in all that time. And that who-so-euer makes any doubt of these things, doth the Maiden great wrong.

He saith likewise, that he had seene a melancholy man which liued seuen weekes without eating or drinking any thing, but euery other day a little water. It is reported by graue and reuerent persons, that a Maid was seene in Spaine, which neuer eate any thing, and entertained her life onely with drinking water, being two and twenty yeares old. Diuers haue seene a girle in Languedo

                which continued three yeares together without eating. And we know by that which certaine good and learned personages haue written of it, that there was another at Spyre in Germanie which liued as many yeares with-out any other meate or drinke then the ayre. WILLIAM RONDOLETIVS affirmes the like, and saith,

that he hath seene another which in the same manner attained to the age of ten yeares: who afterwards was maried and had Children. IOHN BOCCACE writes of a Dutch-woman that liued thirty yeares without meate. PETER ALBANO tells of a Norman, that eate nothing in eighteene yeares, and of another that went sixe and thirty yeares without meate. It is held for certaine that a Priest at Rome liued fortie yeares with the onely inspiration of the aire: it being well obserued vnder the custody of LEO the tenth, and of diuers Princes, and faithfully testified by HERMALAO BARBARO. ALLEXANDER BENIVENIVS reports of an Italian, that he fasted forty daies togither in the Citty of Venice. L. IOVBERT in the 2. paradoxe of his first Decade: and in the 2. booke of his popular errors aboute the ende. Where hee addeth a notable discourse which I thought good to offer vnto the Reader.
            I well fore-see (sayth he) that two sorts of people may be mooued, either with the only subiect of these discourses (touching such as haue liued without eating) or of the proofes thereof. The one is ignorant of naturall Phylosophy and Physick, persons to bee reuerenced for their simplicity and piety, as the common people, and al those that apply not their studie to examine the causes of each thing. The other is diabolicall, persecuting that with most impudent stander which they knowe to bee well spoken. I will not stand vpon these, because they attend not the explication of my speech but with their poyson infect and depraue all that is receiued by their impure thoughts: As for the rest, mee thinkes it is conuenient I should satisfie them with all sincerity. I see then this obiection readie to be vrged against me.
            
               The fasts of forty daies, which IESVS CHRIST, ELIAS, and MOYSES haue sustayned, as the holy Scriptures do testifie, should no longer be held for miracles, if by any naturall reason one could endure to fast many moneths and yeares tog

               ther. Certainely it were true if we did not acknowledge that it was so giuen against the Lawes of nature to men in perfect health, through a certaine priuiledge, as wee religiously beleeue. For exemption from the infirmity of the flesh was Diuinely granted to them for a time: insomuch that their condition at this time was other then the condition of mankinde. But those which as wee learne out of prophane Histories haue liued certaine yeares without eating, if their report bee true, it must needes bee that those persons were all vnhealthy and full of much cold iuce, wherwith the bodie might be nourished a long time. For by that which dayly happens wee see that many sick folkes haue no appetite, by reason their ventricle is stuft with euill humors, and they receiue lesse meate in a weeke, then they did in a day when they were well. But when a man of a sound bodie can but passe one or two daies without meate: and not bee an hungred, that exceedes the rules of nature, and is a Diuine miracle. Howe much more admirable is it, that such a man should fast fortie daies togither in such manner that hee feeles no hunger, hath no neede to resist the desire of eating, nor hath any more appetite to meate or drinke, then an Angell? Wee beleeue that IESVS CHRIST had a bodie exceeding temperate and pure, though hee were subiect to our infirmities according to the condition of his humaine natu
                  •…
               e, sinne excepted. Wee acknowledge like-wise that MOYSES and ELIAS,

               e togither, from meate and drinke, were in perfect health at that time, and by a certaine prerogatiue exempted from the common life of men. Wherevpon it ensueth that they are iustly esteemed for excellent miracles, whereby the authority of those Prophets and of IESVS CHRIST were established. Nowe it is no nouelty that the like effects should happen by the order of things which our most good and mighty GOD hath prescribed to nature, and by an euident miracle against the lawes of the same nature. For feauers and diuers other disseases, which the Saints haue healed, the Physitions doe also cure. But the meanes which they vse, make great difference in the case. For the Saints by their worde or touch alone, through the grace of GOD, tooke away the causes of such effects with the necessity imposed vpon nature. The Physitions do nothing but oppose vnto naturall things other like wise naturall, whereby if the vertue of the remedies giuen by the Creator bee of greatest strength, and that it be his will it should not bee in vaine at that time, the cause which doth offend is defaced. IESVS CHRIST throughly healed the inueterate course of menstruall bloud with the onely touch of the hem

Such is the curing of naturall blindnesse: expelling of vncleane spirits out of humaine bodies; raysing of the dead halfe rotten, and such like, which confirme the authority of the Almightie GOD. By this I thinke it appeares, that things which are sayd to happen by a certaine Lawe of nature (although but seldome) reproue not true miracles, nor dimynish their credit: and that hee no way contradicteth the Chistian fai

But rather is not the verity of vnfained miracles thereby confirmed the better, in taking away the occasion of impostures therewithall, to the ende they should not easily abuse the vnexperienced people? For if any of those which liue without eating, by reason of their cold intemperature, and abundance of flegme, should counterfeit the Prophet inspired of the euer lyuing GOD, howe many thousands might hee drawe head-long into error and distruction?

               It hath beene told me of a certaintie, that there was a Chanon at Salamanca, which went to Toledo, and backe againe, hauing remained there fifteene or twenty dayes, without drinking any drop of Wine or Water, from the time of his setting forth, till his returne. But that which puts me into a greater meruaile, is that written by PONTANVS in his Booke of Meteors. Of a man, that in all his life neuer drunke a drop of any thing: which LADISLAVS King of Naples vnderstanding, made him drinke a little Water, that greatly pained him at his stomack. I haue also heard of diuers credible persons, that in the Towne of Mansill, not farre from the Cittie of Leon, was a man liuing, that vsed to be two or three moneths without drinking▪ and neuer felt any harme or displeasure by it.

Beeing loth to haue his friend derided, and to discharge himselfe of his promise, hee takes a sponge and puts it into an Inck pot, and so blots out all the first page of FICINVS translatiō, then turning towards him (hee sayd) thou seest howe I haue corrected the first page: if thou wilt I will do as much to the rest. FICINVS without any choller, answered him.

And to make the better shewe of it, after that he had sayd vnto M. PETER (to whome he had giuen a watch-word, that hee should but seeme to do it, and to that ende had giuen him foure Crownes) that he pardoned him his death, if hee should

chance to die, hee put himselfe into his handes, and suffred him selfe to be bounde and trimmed, like vnto one that should bee cut indeede. But you must knowe that as the Adulterer had giuen Mr. PETER a watch-word to make but a shewe of doing it, so the husband after that he had notice of this

               WILLIAM NESENVS a man excellent in the knowledg &amp; feare of GOD, going into a fisher-boate, in the Summer-time for to Crosse the riuer of Elba, which

passeth from Witteberg to Saxony, as it was many times his manner to rowe ouer himselfe for his pleasure, ranne against the body of a tree lying vnder Water, which ouer whelmed the boate, and NESENVS in it, who could not swimme and three was drowned. This happened in the euening. The same day a little after dinner being a sleepe, him thought hee entred into a fisher-boate, and fell ouer boorde into the Water. Therevpon came PHILIP MELANCHTHON, his very familiar friend, vnto whome laughing he declared his dreame, accounting it but as a toy. A great personage, seeing him lie dead on the shoare, cryed out with teares in his eyes, ONESENVS, if I had the gift of miracles, how willingly would I raise thee. Hee was infinitely bewayled both of great and small. MELANCHTHON and CAMERARIVs talking togither of this dreame and heauy accident called to minde that which had befallen them and NESENVS not many daies before. They three ryding togither into Hesse, and hauing lien all night at a little towne called Trese, in the morning they past through a brooke for to Water their houses. Beeing in the Water, NESENVS espied three Crowes sit beating their wings and croaking on a little hill hard-by: Wherevpon hee asked of MELANCHTHON what hee thought of it: MELANCHTHON presently answered that it signified one of them three should die ere long. CAMERARIVS confesseth that this answere touched him to the quick, and verie much troubled him: NESENVS did nothing but nod

weake and sickly, hee was perswaded he should not liue very long. I do not rehearse these things (saith he) as if I attributed any vertue to the flight and motion of Birds, nor do I make any science of coniectures which would be grounded there-vpon: no more did MELANCTHON I am sure. But I haue declared them, to shew that diuers times we see merueilous things happen, which after the euents driue many thoughts into their heads, that either behold them, or heare them spoken of.

AMBROSE GRIMANI a Genowaie, lying in garrison in the Ile and Cittie of Chio, the yeare 1431. where he carried himselfe very faithfully and valiantly, and being sound a sleepe, one night had this vision following. Hee thought that an exceeding huge and mightie Serpent with fiery eyes and open throate to deuoure him. Being terrified with this spectacle, he awaked sodenly, and with great trouble of minde he examined his dreame, whereof the next day he makes report to some, who aduised him not to goe any more to any skirmishes, and to giue ouer the warres: thinking that that was the Monster which threatned him with a vyolent end. Where-vpon hee resolued to bee ruled by them. Not long after, the Souldiers and Inhabitants of the place, prouoked by the enemy, made a sallie. GRIMANI remembring his vision, followed them faire and softly aloofe off, onely to behold the fight, and because hee

would not be in any danger, he hid himselfe behinde a thick wall. But hearing the cryes of the combatants, hee could not choose but lift vp his head, and looke through a creuise of the wall. At which very instant a Cannon shotte lighted iust on that place, and tooke GRIMANIES head cleane from his shoulders, the body sincking downe where hee stood. P. BIZERRE▪

               IT chanced in our time at Breslaw in Silesia, that a certaine young Maide, hauing beene present with many others at the execution of a Theefe, which was beheaded, shee was so troubled there-with, as shee fell to haue the falling sicknesse. They applyed many remedies which did her no good. A certaine Gossip, (according to the vsuall custome) gaue her aduise, saying; If they gaue this Maide Cattes bloud to drinke, the paine would cease. Those which gouerned her, following this foolish councell, made her to swallow some. But soone after the poore Mayde changed her naturall disposition, and some-times tooke vpon her the nature of a Catte, wauling, leaping, and running, as those Beasts doe, and watching softlie for Rattes and Mise, in euery corner of the house: trying by all meanes to catch them. Shee continued in these Cattish exercises, vntill the vehemencie of her fitte was past.

               THere was a certaine Gentle man that could not endure an olde woman should looke vpon him: and as it happened once, that at a banquet there were certaine that had beene inuited, vnknowne to him, the which could not but looke vpon him, his apprehension was so great, as hee dyed sodenly. In the same Commentarie of Monsters.
            
            Cattes offend many with looking on them: so as some hearing or seeing a Catte, tremble, and are much afraide: the which I beleeue doth not proceed alone from the venome of Cattes, but also from their disposition that doe see or heare them, for they haue by Nature this influence from Heauen, the which is neuer moued to doe her proper action, vnlesse the contrarie obiect present it selfe. I haue seene many of this minde and disposition in Germanie, and some remaining in Goritzia. If this proceeds onely of a naturall quallitie which is in fewe, they that are subiect vnto it, shewe it plainlie: For beeing in Germanie, and supping in the Winter time in a Stoue) with very good company, one of the troupe was much subiect vnto that humour. The Hostesse knowing the disposition of the Man, shutte a little Kitlin which shee had bred vp, into a Cofer with-in the Stoue, least this man

seeing it should be offended. But although hee did neither see it nor heare it, yet a while after, hauing smelt the ayre of a Catte, his disposition (enemie vnto Cats) beeing stirred, hee began to sweate, growe pale, and trembling to crye out, not without amazement to all the companie, that there was a Catte hidden in some corner of the Stoue. MATHIOLVS vpon the 6. Booke of DIOSCORIDES, Chap. 25.
            I haue knowne a Princesse, adorned with all vertues of the minde and body, that could not endure the sight of a Catte, beeing other-wise of an actiue spirit, and armed against all the difficulties of the world. Shee imputed the cause of this feare, to that which happened to her Mother, beeing with Childe with her: for on a time a Catte did so terrifie her, as shee sounded, and was long sicke of this accident. Cattes did not feare her before that time, when as shee did see them: but this falling sodenly, as it were in her lappe, shee was much amazed. THOMAS ERASTVS in his Disputations.

was forced to rise from the Table, when any one was brought. And if they came but neere vnto his nose, hee presently bled. If hee did see any by chance, and could not retire himselfe, he sodenly stopt his nostrils with peeces of bread. Wee haue heard that many, issued out of the noble familie of CANDALES in Guienne, haue bin of that disposition, not to endure the smell of Apples. The same Author.

As soone as the Father was returned, this strumpet complaines vnto him, saying, that his Sonne had sought three or foure times to corrupt her: and in the ende would haue forced her, if her seruant had not come to helpe her. He giuing credit to this wicked report, confirmed by the Baude, beganne to murmure to him-selfe▪ wher-vpon his Son comes in, against whome, (without speaking any other words, but ha wicked Traitor, it is against mee that thou darest presume to plaie these partes) hee goes with his sword drawne. The young Gentleman turning away to auoide the blowe, and not remembring that hee was vpon a straite not supported, which answered vnto two lodgings, hee fell backward downe to the grounde and was all bruzed, so as hauing fallen vpon a stone in the botome of the ditch, hee died presently. The Parricide (thinking that hee

had leapt downe of his owne accord) did runne after him, vsing newe threates. But beeing come downe and seeing his Sonne in that estate, after cries of

As for the strumpet hearing by the fearefull cries of the seruantes what had happened, thrust on by the reuenging furies, or rather pursued by the fearefull iudgement of almighty GOD, the reuenger of innocent bloud, shee flies towards a well in the house, and leapes into it; where shee was drowned. The Iustice of Milan, beeing called to see this accident, apprehends the seruant, and makes her confesse al vpon the racke: where-vpon she was hanged. Her bodie with the strumpets and the olde mans, were cast vpon the dunghill, as a preie for Birds and Wolues. But the young Gentleman was carried to the earth with great pompe, and lamented of all men for his vertues as much as the others were &amp; are yet detested of posterity.

His Sister and CAMILLA running vnto him, (for there was none but a thinne partition of wood,) CAMILLA not able to dissemble any longer, began to ioyne her face to his, so as hee came againe vnto him selfe, and heard her say, that if her Father would like of the marriage, she would not contradict it. LIVIO being recouered, demands CAMILLA, according to the accustomed course among Men of honor.

beautie of Don IVLIOS eyes: the Cardinall full of furie, watching a time when as IVLIO went out of Ferrara a Hunting, compassed him about in the field, and taking him from his Horse, hee caused certaine Ruffians of his to pull out his eyes, for that they were companions of his loue: Hauing the heart to behold this wicked acte, the which was afterwards the cause of great scandalls among the Bretheren.

               That those studies which smelt of the Lampe, smelt well. Hauing left it light in his Chamber, going one morning into the Towne about his businesse.

Among other writings of his hand, there was a Booke burnt, intituled, Pastor, with all the rest of his estate, in regarde of worldly goods. They say, that at the first brute of this fire, hee entred into such a rage against him-selfe, as crying out like a mad-man, and running vp and downe the streetes towards the Pallace, beeing neere vnto his Chamber, where-at hee durst not enter for feare of the fire: hee began to say, addressing his speech to the Sonne of GOD: What haue I done to thee, O CHRIST? or how haue I offended thine, that thou shouldest strike mee, and displaye vpon mee a testimonie of thine inexpiable hatred.

His friends there present did what they could to temper this furie: but the boyling choller, causing a fire in this miserable mans heart, more flaming and violent then any worldly fire, would not suffer him to heare any thing that might comfort him. Hee was so opprest with his passion, as hauing threatned all his friends, if they continued to follow him, he went out of the Towne, and not able to bee stayed, hee gotte into a thicke Forrest neere vnto Forly: where as hee

To increase their despaier and want of courrage, this reason was yet alledged in the Senat, that if they did willingly abandon and quit the Seigneury, to flie the present dangers, good fortune returning they should recouer it the more easily: for that the people which had bin voluntarily seperated from them, would make no so great resistance not to returne vnder the obedience of their ancient Lords, as if they had beene deuided by a manifest rebellion. By these reasons, the Venetian generositie was layed vnder foote, with the greatnesse of that glorious Common-weale, beeing content to retaine onelie the salt Waters, they sent Commissions to their Magistrates

and officers that were in Padoua, Verona and other Townes, appointed by the atticles of the League, to the Emperour MAXIMILIAN; commanding them to depart presently, and to leaue them in the peoples power. Moreouer, to the ende they might obtaine a peace of MAXIMILIAN, at what price and with what conditions soeuer: they sent vnto him with great speede ANTHONY IVSTINIAN for Ambassador, who hauing a publicke audience, hee made a pittifull oration, and with great submission: but it was in vaine, for the Emperor refused to make any accord without the King with whome the Venetians would not by anie meanes treate.

Hauing continued seauen monethes in this estate, I was called to helpe him, and with great difficulties by the grace of GOD, I did Physicke him so happely, as hee recouered his former wittes againe FR.

            A Councellor of the Parliament at Grenoble beeing taken with the loue of a Gentlewoman, was so wonderfully passioned, as hee left his place and all honestie, to followe her where-soeuershee went. Being contemned by her, hee grewe so carelesse of his owne person, as hee was full of Lice, which got such an habit in him, as hee could neuer be freed of them, for they grewe vpon him, and came out of all partes of his bodie, as wee see wormes come out of rotten Carion. Fynally some

daies before his death, seeing himselfe toucht with the hand of GOD, he began to despaier of his mercies▪ and to shorten his daies, hee resolued to star

They that saw this pittifull spectacle were much amazed, and for pitty concluded to force him to eate: and to make him take some coulisses, and for that he resisted thē with all his force, they bound his armes, and kept his mouth open with a staffe, whilest they put in the meate. Beeing thus vsed, hee died like a madde beast, through the aboudance of Lice, which entred into his throat. This happened in the yeare 1559. The second History of France.

            A young Gentleman in the Emperor CHARLES the fift his Court, beeing in loue with a Gentle-woman wrought so, as partly by loue, partly by force he had her maiden-head, the which beeing knowne, and hauing cōmitted this act in the Emperors Court, he was committed

to prison and condemned to loose his head: and hauing notice giuen him ouer night, that the next day should ende his life, that night was so terrible vnto him, and wrought such an impression, as the next day comming out off prison, to go before the seate of Iustice, &amp; heare the sentence of death, no man did know him, no not the Emperor him-selfe. For feare had so chaunged him, that whereas the day before hee had a Vermillion hewe, of a flaxen hayre, and of a pleasing aspect: hee was now like vnto a bodye taken out off the Graue, hauing the hayre of his head and beard, like to one of seuentye yeares olde, and hee had the resemblance more of one that had beene hanged, then of a lyuing man.
            The Emperor thinking there had bin some fraud vsed, and that some other offender had beene foysted into this Gentlemans place, who was not yet 28. yeares old, hee caused a search to bee made, whence this wonderfull and sodaine change should come. and then beholding wistly this poore offender thus terrefied, the desire of iust vengeance was conuerted and turned into mercye: and as it were reuiued out of a deepe amazement, hee said vnto him. I pardon thy offence; commanding that they should let him goe, adding withall that hee had beene punished sufficiently for his fault, without the losse of his head. LEVINVS LEMNIVS lib. 2. chap. 2. Of the complexion of mans body. Where-vnto hee dooth adde certaine reasons of this strange alteration. The which I heere set downe adding some words for the better explaning thereof.
            Beeing demanded of a great personage the cause of this prodigious change; I answered that wee must impute

it to the deepe apprehension and attentiue thought of approching death, peercing through the heart: for the affection and passion of the minde, beeing amazed was so violent and so bitter to the young Gentleman, as the vitall spirits were almost quencht and suffocated in him, all the parts of the bodye loosing their liuely and pleasing colour, did wither and fade sodainely; so as the rootes of the hayre, nourished and watred by the fuming vapour that is betwivt the skinne and the flesh, as the herbes in the ground, that are toucht with a cold and drie quality, they did wither, and presently loose their naturall beautye: for euen as the leaues of Trees and Vines in the heate of Sommer growe some times y

               alow and pale, by any excesse of heate, hayle, rayne or a cold Northerly wind: euen so the vigour of the bodye, the colour, the outwarde shewe, the hayre which is no part, but simply a dependance of the bodye, takes the colour of gray or white, because that which did maintayne them is quencht. The which wee doe see happen to most men that haue beene in dangers in the Warres, or in hazard at Sea, or that haue beene toucht with dangerous diseases: for then they thinke but of one thing, which is, that Death hath taken them by the throat, if not perchance (through long custome, solide instruction and good resolution by the precepts of true Philosophie, and by the assistance of more then a humane spirit) they bee not accustomed nor vsed to feare so much. The which wee see is ordinary and common in manye olde Souldiars and Martiners in regard of their long and continuall practise.
            When as the horrour of Death surpriseth anye

one, or that the imagination thereof, more bitter then death it selfe is framed in the thought, they die sometimes before they are dying, as it hath happened vnto many, or else the Senses are dulled and mortefied, so as the offenders feele not the stroakes, as we haue seene in many that haue beene be-headed, and broken vppon the Wheele, resembling men that haue Apoplexies, Lethargies, falling-Sicknes, Sowndings; or like to others which open their eyes, yet neither see nor knowe any man. The dangers incident to Sea and Land, whereas the Image of Death appeares before their eyes, and doth fixe it selfe more strongely in the thought, make them that are in them to tremble and looke pale: the blood retires it selfe and flies from all parts towards the fortresse of the heart: all the parts of the body in an instant want their norishment, not any one doth discharge his due function, but the feete stagger, the sight growes dymme, the force fayles, the vnderstanding becomes blunt, the spirit dull, the cheekes leane and withered, the tongue fumbling, and the teeth shaking in the head. To conclude there is no man, how strong and confident so euer, that is not amazed when any mortall danger surpriseth him sodainely.
            True it is that a Christian fixing his hope in the grace of GOD, recouers his spirits by little and little, shakes of feare, assures himselfe, and becomes inuincible, opposing him-selfe with a cheereful and vndaunted courrage to any danger that hee sees ineuitable: except that that for death is horrible and fearefull to al Nature which hath breathing of life: for that it destroyes this nature. We see some that are dull, some furious and madde, and others that are altered by decrepit age, by bodely indisposition,

by erronious precepts and doctrine, by violent and disordered passions more then feare, which apprehend nothing, but perish in danger and are extinct before they doubt any thing.

was a mournfull signe, and that BARBAROSSA Generall of the Turkes fleet did approch, to surprise both the Pope and the Emperour. Vpon this feare they giue an Alarum.

Shee putting her head out at a windowe, and seeing these poore people runne like scattered sheepe, sent one of her seruants on horse-backe vnto them, to knowe the cause of this amazement. Beeing returned hee sayd that all these poore people did assure him that the Turkish squadrons were verie neere at their heeles. Vpon this report, the Baronesse receiued all them that fled: so as the Castell, the base Court and the ditches were all verie full with them. This sodaine feare did runne from Vienna vnto Lints, which is about some thirtie howers iorney.

their shoulders, and Women bare theyr yong children in theyr armes, and the bigger they ledde in their handes. The streetes did eccho againe with sighes, lamentations and miserable cries, mingled with a strange confused noyse through-out all the Cittye: To conclude it was a pittifull spectacle. So as the newes continuing and remayning still that the Turkes approched and drewe nere, there was nothing to bee expected but a horrible flight of all in generall, with such blinde disorder and tumultuous violence, as in the presse of the people, of Horses and Carts, many Children and some Women lost their liues, beeing smothered, this feare continued 3. daies being impossible to assure and bring backe them that fled, who in the end otherwise perswaded by diuers Aduertisements and Messages, returned to their howses.

            Of a wonderfull Turkish Pilgrim.
            
               I Will report wonders of a Turkish Pilgrim. Hee went attyred in a long Cassacke and a white Cloake downe to his heeles, with a long Beard: as our Painters do represent vnto vs most of the Apostles, vnder a graue shewe he hid a craftie spirit. The Turkes did admire him, and honour him as a Saint, and a doer of myracles: perswading my Interpreters to lead mee vnto him, that I might see him. Hee dined at my Table soberly and modestly. Then going downe into the Court, he returned soone againe: hauing taken vp a great Stone, hee strooke him selfe such blowes vpon the naked brest, as they had beene able to haue killed an Oxe. This done, he laid hold vpon a peece of Yron, which they had express
                  •…
               e put into the fire, so as it was red whotte, hee put it into his mouth, and turned it vp and downe, the Spittle hissing as water doth, when as a Smith quencheth a fier
                  •…
               e hotte Yron in it. This Yron was reasonablie long, and great, and square at the end, the which entred so whotte into his mouth, as it was like vnto a burning coale. This done, hee puts the Yron againe into the fire, then

hauing made an obeysance vnto mee, and receiued a reward, hee departed. My seruants beeing amazed at this sight, one of them thinking him-selfe more sufficient then his companions, began to saye vnto them. Poore fooles why doe you wonder? doe you thinke that this counterfet hath put the fire in his mouth indeed? They bee Impostures and iugling trickes. And in saying so, hee layde holde of the Yron by the verye ende which was out of the fire, to shew that it might be handled without any hurt or burning. But hee had no sooner gript it in his hand, but hee shakt it off as speedily: but not with such ease: for the space of many dayes, hee had the palme of his hand and fingers so pittifully burnt with the fire, as hee had much paine to heale it.
            His companions could not conteine them-selues from laughing, asking him, if hee did not beleeue that a flaming fire was whotte? adding, That hee might if hee pleased, make a second tryall to confound them whome hee had so mocked: But hee would no more meddle with it. At dinner, this Turke who sayde he was a Monke, reported vnto mee, that his Abbot, a holy and famous man for his miracles, was accustomed to cast his cloake vpon a Lake neere vnto the Couent, and then did sit vpon it, and did sport himselfe as easily vpon the water in this sort, as if hee had beene rowing in a faire and calme day in a Boate. That when as they did flea a Sheepe, the manner was to sowe vp this Abbot in the skinne, so as the fore-feete were fitted to his armes, and the hinder to his thighes: and in this equipage they did cast him into a burning Ouen, where hee remained vntill the Sheepe was roasted, then they drew him out of the

Furnaise whole and sound, to eate his part of the Mutton merely with his Monkes. If you will say vnto mee, that such miracles of Sathan, are Impostures where-vnto you giue no credit, no more doe I. I tell you but what the Monke reported: but as for the burning Yron, I did see it with mine owne eyes: the which is not so admirable, as you would thinke at the first: for I doubt not but this counterfet worker of miracles, going to seeke a stone in the Court-yard to beate his brest withall, might annoint his mouth with some-thing that was fitte to resist the violence of the fire, as you know there is. I remember to haue seene in Saint Markes at Venice a Montebancke, which did willingly handle molten Lead, and washt his hands there-with, with-out any burning.

               IN the Towne of Rutlinquen, a certaine passenger came into an Inne, and gaue a Budget to keepe vnto his Hoste, in the which there was a great summe of money. Asking it againe at his departure, the hoste denies it, giues him iniurious words and mockes him. The passenger calles him in question before the Iudge, and for that all was done with-out witnesses hee was ready to offer his Hoste an othe, who desired nothing more, giuing himselfe vnto the Diuell, if hee had receiued or concealed the Bouget of money that was in question. The Plaintiue demanded

respight to consider if he should offer him this oth, &amp; going out of of the pleading place, hee meetes with two men, who inquire the cause of his comming thether. He reportes the whole fact vnto them. Well say they, wilt thou that we shall helpe thee in this cause. Hee yeelded not knowing what they were. Therevpon they returne all three before the Iudge: where the two last come, beginne to iustefie vnto the host, (who was not yet gone) that the bouget had beene deliuered him; that hee had receiued it and hidden it in such a place. This periured wretch knewe not what to answer. And as the Iudge resolued to send him to prison, the two witnesses beganne to say: you shall not neede: Wee are sent to punnish his wickednesse: Saying so, they tooke and lift him vp in the aier, where he vanished with them, and was neuer after found.

               IN the yeare 1502. the 22. of Iune all the Countrie about Berne, Soleurre and Biennie, of a great compasse, was beaten with a thicke hayle, the stones beeing as bigge as Hens eggs. Seauen daies after, an other greater storme of hayle spoiled all the Countrie of zurich, slue manie peasants and others that went into the fields, with much Cattell, foule and wilde Beastes.
            Eight yeares after, in the yeare 1510. in Lombardie
               
there fell from Heauen aboue twelue hundred stones, among the which as CARDAN reports in his Booke Dererum Varietate, was found one of sixe-score pounds waight, and an other of three-score; many were brought to diuers French Noblemen, commanding then in those places for the King. These stones were of a rustie collour, very hard and smelt of sulphur. Two houres before this shower, the Heauens seemed all on fire: what the miserable estate of Milan and the Neighbour Countries were afterwards. GVICHARDIN doth shewe in his Historie of the warres of Italie.
            
            The 19. of Iuly 1528. the Countrie lying about Ausbourg, was wonderfully spoiled with hayle stones, greater then a bigge mans fiste, falling from Heauen for the space of some houres. Three yeares after there fell such a violent hayle about Basil, as all the vignes were spoyled. At Lisbonne in Portugall it rayned bloud in great aboundance. In the yeare 1542. it rayned bloud in the Diocesse of Munster, aboute Sassenbourg, not farre from Warendorfe.
            
            In the yeare 1544. there fell great store of haile about Silesia, the stones whereof were as bigge as Estriges egges, and in them there appeered plainely the figures of long partie colloured breeches after the Lansquenet fashion. And in manie of them beeing broken, there were found stones made like vnto Turkish Turbans. In the vpper Alsacia, about Colmar an Imperiall Towne, there fel from heauen a great shower of Froggs and Toades in the yeare 1549. The peasants were troubled for some daies to kill this Vermine with staues: and then least the aire should bee infected, the Magistrate caused them to bee gathered togither vpon

heapes, and then filled great ditches with them. In the yeare 1550. some dates before Easter in the moneth of March, two houres together there f

            A yeare after, which was 1551. it rayned bloud ouer Lisbonne in Portugall; the same yeare a little before Whitsontide, the cloudes opening, there fell such streames of Water about Kittengen in Franconia, as the flouds vpon the Land drowned manie men, and much Cattell almost in an instant. A great farme consisting of manie houses, was ouerthrowne and almost all that dwelt in it drowned. The Bridge at Kittengen was beaten downe and carried awaie; and if they had not sodenly giuen passage to the Waters, percing the Towne walles, all had beene lost. There were fiue houses quite ouerthrowne▪ fiue others in a village, called Rotolsee: and fiue in an other place: fiueteene men were drowned at Speckfurt, and manie houses beaten quite downe to the grownd, as also at Pabemberg, whereas the vignes and corne-ground was spoyled after a very strange manner.

            In an other village the Waters did drowne the Cattell that were in the field, and the young boyes that kept them. Towardes SchlakenVuals, where the mines are, these deluges did inestymable harme. The Riuer of

               Elbe beeing rissen with the raine Water, did much harme in the Countrie, and so did other Riuers at the same-time. The foureteene of August 1552. a great tempest rysing in the aire ouer Holland, there fell aboundance of hayle, euerie stone waying aboue one pound, beeing all of diuers formes. Some were verie like the Sonne, others were like vnto a Crowne of thorne, some resembled Wheeles, and other things. The Sonne hauing caused them to melt, there came forth a stinking smoke, the which infected the aire, whereof followed a great mortality of Cattell. Some monethes before, the Riuers of Sal and Mein, famous in Germanie, did ouerflowe and ruined manie buildings, and drowne manie Men and much Cattell. It rayned bloud in France. And neere vnto Marpurg there was a poole seene manie times bloudie.

At night a thicke cloud breaking and falling violently in the vallees, where there are manie pooles, the same beeing full and the causies broken, the Water finding a passage, it beganne to runne towardes this Riuer which was neere, and made it swell heigher then euer had beene seene, hauing of it selfe a swift and sodaine course, falling from the mountaines. Beeing then accompanied with these violent Waters, it did breake, ouerthrow and pull vp all the foundations of bridges, gardines and buildings that were a mile about, so as there were no signes of them to be seene.
            
               This violent floud did drowne two and thirtie persons, which could not recouer the Towne in time. Many without saued them-selues in the neere Mountaines. It was thought that in this deluge there were aboue a hundred persons drowned.
            In the yeare 1553. the extraordinary raine made the riuer of Rhine to swell and ouer-flowe, the which was the spoile of a great Countrie neere vnto the bankes. The Towne of Ruffach among others, was in danger to be drowned by this floud, the which was runne out in a short time, leauing in recompence of the spoile it had made, great abundance of Fishe vpon the land, in the Medowes and Marishes, yea euen in the Towne vautes. At Erford it rained bloud, the fift of Iune the same yeare: and at Lipsic the 8. of Iuly.

In the yeare 1556. about the twelfe and thirteenth of Maye, there fell a dewe from Heauen about Bresle and neere to Don, in the Canton of Bearne, the which had a taste sweeter then Honie. Two dayes after it raigned bloud neere to Schafouze. The second of September the raine fell in such aboundance at Locarne, as the

towne was almost spoiled and in daunger to be ruined. These Histories are gathered out of the Collection of Prodigies made by L. LYCOSTHENES.

This speech was neither without reason nor without euent: for it is most certaine that the Angells, bee the preseruers of publike States, and of the holy order appointed by the almightie GOD, fight constantly against wicked and euill spirits which take pleasure in murthers and the ouerthrowe of all good order, which the Lorde allowes, as wee reade in the Historie of Persia, whereas the Angell tells the Prophit DANIEL that for a long time hee had supprest the euill spirit the which did mooue the Greekes to ruine the Persian Monarchie.

               CCHIO, valiant and wise, but full of the gout, beeing in disgrace with a great Noble-man, going one daie vnaduisedly vpon his moyle some fewe Leagues from his house: hee was pursued and set vpon by this Noble-man, who was followed by some Soldiars, and then carried prisoner to a stronge Castell out of the waie and shut vp in an heigh Tower, and committed to one of his confident seruantes to keepe. Hee was fed with bread and water, like a crimynall person condemned to perpetuall prison, and no man knewe who hee was. In the meane time they sought vp and downe for PECCHIO, but hearing no newes, of him, the Iustice of that place where he dwelt, thought that hee had beene slayne: for they had found his moile and some droppes of bloud vpon him. They make dilligent information, and two men are charged, with whome in times past hee had had a quarrell, vppon this presumption, they are miserablie imprisoned and greeuiously tortured in such sort as they were forst to confesse that they had slaine PECCHIO so as the one was hanged and the other beheaded. But PECCHIO was in prison, where hee continued nyneteene whole yeares, neuer changing nor putting of the clothes hee

had. When they tooke him: yet full of hope that GOD would one day deliuer him. His Sonnes, according to the custome, made his funerall, and the deuided his goods. Hee was taken in the yeare 1540. and was deliuered in the yeare 1559. in this manner. The Lord who vsed him in that sort, beeing dead they intreated PECCHIO after his accustomed manner, neither did anie one euer see him, or speake to him in all this time. It chanced that this Lords heire had an humor to builde neere vnto this Tower, and as they pulled downe the Walles which did compasse in PECCHIO who had no light but by a narrowe clifte, by the which hee receiued his meate and drinke, they spied this man with his clothes tottered, his beard long to his knees, and his haire hanging vpon his shoulders. Euery man runnes to this newe sight. Some persons well aduised did wish that hee should not bee brought too sodenly into the light, least it should dazell him, and that to much aire should make him fainte. By little and little hee recouered his sight and strength. Then hee lettes them vnderstand what hee was, and of all his aduenture: in the end hee was knowne, reenters into his goods that were sold by his Sonnes, and beeing cleerely cured of his gout hee liued the remainder of his daies helthfully.

               DVring the time that GREGORIE the 13. was Pope, there was a quarrell and sute for matter of religion, against IHON CASIER, great Maister of Malta. The Iudges appointed; the Registers, Proctors, and witnesses had done all at Malta that might concerne this fact. ROMEGAS a Knight of Malta was his principall accuser, and as it were a partie. All were adiorned to appeare before Pope GREGORIE at Rome in the yeare 1591. where I was, and did see ROMEGAS, and the great Maister arriue in Nouember. In December following ROMEGAS died, and presently after the great Maister, and they were both interred in the Trinitie Church. As for the Iudges, Registers, Proctors, and witnesses, being all imbarked in one ship, with the Informations and proceedings of the Processe, they perished all vpon the Sea in the same moneth, and there remained not any leafe of the whole proceeding, whereby they might ground any sentence.

But he carryed himselfe like a man encountred with diuers passions; for hauing both Townes and forces in his power, the enemies Armie vnder ANTHONIE de LEVA hard by him, and wee without any iealousie of him, it was in him to haue done worse then hee did, for by his treason we lost neyther man, nor Towne, but onely Fossan, and that after it had held out long.

            A wonderfull Ransom.
            
               THE Spanish Histories write at large of the ransome which ATABALIPA King of Peru, payed, to bee deliuered out of the bands of PIZARRE, valued at manie Millions of golde: yet not-withstanding the Spaniards put him to death and spoiled infinite treasures, part where of was brought into Europe, where it was wretchedly wasted, &amp; part with

those robbers and their ships, was lost in the botom of the Sea. But in the warre made in our time by the Vaiuod of Valachia against the Turkes, in the yeare 1574. certaine Polonian Horsemen hauing defeated a great supply, and taken their Commander prisoner, who was a man of a tall and goodly stature, and so riche, as he offered almost an incredible ransom: although many did affirme that he had meanes to giue more. He offered vnto the Polonians if they would saue his life, and not carry him vnto the Vaiuod, to pay them twise as much gold, thrise as much siluer, and once as much in Pearle, as he should way. This sum was sufficient to winne the hearts of men of higher qualities: yet these Polonians (men which liue by carrying of armes, and seeke most commonly entertainement of them which will giue most,) chose rather to keepe the promise faithfully made by them vnto the Vaiuod, to bring vnto him all the prisoners they should take, then to lade them-selues with Golde, Siluer, or Pearles. They therefore carried him vnto the Vaiuod, who with-out demanding or accepting of any ransome, caused him to be cut in peeces with other prisoners: and soone after he himselfe was slaine by a Turkish Bassa, and the Polonians saued them-selues.

            A miserable Rape.
            
               AT such time as the French made warre in Italy, vnder the raigne of LEVVIS the twelfth, a riche Marchant of Milan, (hauing one onely Sonne called GALEAS, about tenne yeare olde) dyed, leauing his heire a verye great estate,

whom the Mother (an honorable and vertuous Gentlewoman) caused to be carefully brought vp, and instructed in all honest and decent exercises. Being come to the age of eighteene yeares, he began on the one part; to vnderstand the estate of his affayres, for that his Mother would not marry any more: and on the other, hee was perswaded by sundry exhortations to containe him-selfe in the way of vertue. There-vpon it happened, that there was a question for the recouerie of a great summe of money due by a Gentleman of Venice, who trafficked much into the leuant Seas. GALEAS who had not gone farre from his owne house, intreated his Mother to giue him leaue to make his voyage to Venice, to take some order for this businesse, hauing a ready witte fitt for any thing. The Mother consented, and after many goodly admonitions, hauing giuen him a seruant to accompanie him, she suffered him to depart. Being come to Venice, the Gentleman that was his debtor, entertained him courteously, and after some dayes, conducted him to Padoua, where his familie was, that hee might prouide for the paiment of his debt.
            The Venetian had a Daughter called LVCRETIA, about sixteene yeares olde, of whom at the first sight GALEAS fell in loue. The night following, hee had a fearefull dreame. It seemed vnto him that a Man vnknowne opened his brest and LVCRETIAS, and then fed vpon their hearts. Awaking sodenly all amazed, and crying out, hee tels vnto his seruant his passion, where-on hee had after-wards this dreame. The seruant who was a cunning Bawde, made him an exposition of this dreame, such as hee knew to bee fitte for his Maisters humor, and wrought so cunningly, that soone after the young

Man and the young Maide talked secretly together, GALEAS promising LVCRETIA to take her away, and carry her to Milan, where when as they should come to riper age, they would marry. Their disordred desires did so blinde and transport them, as contemning all honest and lawfull meanes, which were easie, they ranne head-long into the miseries which followed. GALEAS vsing diuerse treacherous practises, fained to send his seruant backe to Milan, with diuers Letters of affaires, and hee himselfe returned to Venice with the Gentle-man, where hee receiued money, and tooke order for all that for the which hee had beene sent by his Mother. After three dayes, newes were brought vnto this poore Gentleman of Venice, that they knew not what was become of his Daughter LVCRETIA. But GALEAS seruant lurking at Milan, had stolne her away, and carryed her to Milan, where hee had hyred a house, and left her in the guarde of an olde woman, who was some-times GALEAS Nurce, who seemed to weepe with the VENETIAN: who vnderstanding that his Wise remaining at Padoua, grew desperate for the losse of her Daughter, went thether to comfort her: leauing GALEAS, who presently takes another way, saying, that hee went to his Mother, who had called him home.
            Being come to Milan, after that hee had giuen an accoumpt of their common affaires, he goes to LVCRECR whom hee entertaines in his house so cunninglye, as for three yeares together nothing was discouered. In the end GALEAS had two crosse incounters. The one by LVCRETIA, who desired the performance of his promise, and the other by his Mother, who did solicite him to marrie. He was wholy inclined to keepe his word, and to marrie

LVCRETIA, but yet they were much troubled to discouer it vnto his Mother, who seeing a great alteration in him since his returne from Venice, did long muse vpon her Sonnes excuses: who being growne strong, riche, and in the flower of his age, was desired of the best families of Milan, who would not haue disdained his allyance. In the ende shee wrought so, as shee blew vp this Mine, and discouered that her Sonne entertained a very faire young Maide, in that lodging, where his Nurce had beene placed: but where-as shee should haue proceeded freely, shee tooke a wrong course, which brought forth terrible effects, GODS Iustice vsing such meanes for the execution of his fearefull decrees. Watching a fitte oportunitie, shee sent certaine men disguised into the house where-as LVCRETIA was: they put a gagge in her mouth, and threaten her with death, if shee cryed out, and then they carry her secretly into a Monasterie of women, where shee is committed to safe keeping. GALEAS returning late to this lodging, and not finding her: vnderstood from his Nurse what had chanced: wherewith hee entred into a strange furie, and continued all the next day without eating any thing. His Mother aduertised thereof, went vnto him; and seeing him in the way to despaire, she began to assure him that LVCRETIA was whereas she would giue a good account of her, wishing him to take courage and be of good cheere. There-vpon he came some-what to him-selfe, hauing a promise that they would restore LVCRETIA againe vnto him that night. In the meane time he imagines, that these disguised men had abused her: with other strange furies wherewith choller had possest him: so as toward night LVCRETIA being restored vnto him, he gaue her but a cold

reception, then comming neerer vnto her, he sayd, there is no reason they should seperate vs any more, but that wee should concurre together in one death: at which wordes hee drewe out his Poynard, and stabbes her in such sort, as shee fell downe dead at his feete: with the same Poynard smoaking with LVCRETIAS bloud, hee strikes him-selfe vnto the heart, and after some wordes he dyed. The same night they were both interred, vpon a brute that they were dead of the plague, whom the contagion had presently chokt. History of Italy.
            
         
         
            Execrable Rauishers punished by a valiant hand.
            
               THE Citty of Genoa being taken by the Armie of the Emperour CHARLES the 5. the streetes, places, and houses, were full of the pittifull Lamentations of Wiues and Maides, crying out for mercie and helpe. More-ouer it was a strange and horrible noyse which the Souldiers made, breaking doores and windowes, and spoyling the rich pallaces with a strange violence, others rauishing of Maides and Wiues, which they found in the houses. In this horrible confusion, ALFONSO d' AVALOS Marquis of Pescara, Colonell of the Imperiall footemen, running vp and downe the streetes to preuent the wrong which they went about to offer to the honour of Women. A Gentleman of Genoa, taking him for some Captaine, begā to intreate him to suppresse the insolency of two Spanish soldiars that would rauish his Wife, a vertuous &amp; honorable Gentlewomā, which cried for helpe.

Sodenly the Marquis lights from his horse goes vp to the Chamber, and thrusts through one of these wretches who held the poore Gentle-woman by the haire, and striued to ouerthrowe her. One being slaine he followes the other, who fled downe the staires, and gaue him such a blowe, as he cleft his head in two. Then hauing caused their dead bodies to bee cast out at the Chamber windowe into the streete, hee made a proclamation vpon paine of death, that no man should presume to wrong (either in worde or deede) any honest maide or Wife. This execution restrayned the loosenesse of the Soldiars, and the Maquis for this worthie act, was honored of all good men. P.

            Recompenses of nature.
            
               THE prouidence and care which the Creator of all things hath giuen to nature is admirable: for by a dailie custome shee doth furnish creatures with such force and dexterity, which haue the members crooked, defectiue or weake, or that haue none at all, or hauing, do more then is prescribed them: as we may wel say, that the perfection of a Creature consists, not in the distinction of members, but in the continuall vse thereof. I haue often considered thereon. When we were at Cobourg, in the Lodging of ERASMVS NEVSTETER, a wise &amp; vertuous Gentleman of Germanie: hauing giuen vs the best entertainement hee could deuise, hee sent to a certaine place not farre of for a yong

man about thirtie yeares old, the which was borne without armes, who could do as much with his feete as a very able man could do with his hands, so as he him-selfe did afferme, that nature had recompenced one guift with an other. Being set vpon a seate equalling the heigth of the table whereon they set the meate, hee tooke a knife with his feete, and began to cut both bread and meate, carrying it vnto his mouth, and a goblet also, as easilie with his feete as an other doth with his handes. After dinner hee beganne to write both Italien hand and Dutch, so right and so well, as euerie one of vs desired to haue of it, to keepe for a singularity. At my request hee tooke a pen-knife and made good pennes to write, and presented them to mee and to others. Beeing thus busied, I did carefully consider the fashion of his feete and did finde this toes were sum-thing long, fit to laie hold of anything, and a farre off, they resembled the fingers of a mans hand: as for his legges hee kept them couered with his cloake.

            I haue seene at my house a little man borne at Nantes, without armes, who hath so well fashioned his feete to the seruice which his handes doe owe him, as in truth they haue halfe forgotten their owne naturall dutie. Finally hee calls them his handes, hee cuttes, hee chargeth a pistoll, and dischargeth it, hee threads a needle, hee sowes, hee writes, hee pulles of his hat, hee combes his head, hee plaies at Cardes and Dice, and shakes them with as great dexteritie as any other, the money which I gaue him, hee carried away in his foote, as wee doe

in our hand. I did see an other when I was a Childe, who handled a two-hand sword, and a halberd, helping him. selfe with the bending of his necke for want of hands, he would cast them vp in the aire and catch them againe, throwe a dagger, and make a whippe lash as well as any Carter in France.

            Of this last in my opinion, or of an other no lesse admirable, Maister AMB. PARE makes mention in these tearmes. Not long since there was a man seene at Paris, without armes, beeing fortie yeares olde, stronge and lustie, who did in a manner all the actions that an other might doe with his hands: with the stumpe of his shoulder and his head, hee would strike a hatchet as strongely, as an other man could do with his armes. More-ouer hee would lash a Carters whippe, and did manie other actions with his feete: hee did eate, drinke, plaied at cardes and dice: in the ende hee was a theefe and a murtherer, and was put to death in Gelderland.

They doe verie often assist at Sermons, and you would saie, that they vnderstand with their eyes what the Preacher saies, as others are accustomed to doe by hearing: for as often as they will, and without anie teaching, or examples, they write the Lordes prayer and other Holie praiers: they can repeate the Texts of the Gospells that are Preacht on Hollie daies, and write them readelie. When as the Preacher in his Sermon makes mention of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, the young man before anie other puts his hand to his hat, and bends his knee with great reuerence. Inthetime of our Fathers, there was seene in Flanders, IOHN FERDINAND who was borne starke blinde and poore, surmounting these two difficulties which are great enemies to learned men in such sort, as hee became a learned Poet and Phylosopher, as besides hee was so good a musitien, as hee plaied verie excelentlie well of diuers sortes of Instrumentes,

               THE Rhosne is one of the swiftest flouds in Europ, and yet by a wonderfull secret, we haue seene it mount vp in such sort as the bedde of it hath lien drie, whereof I will produce two Histories. Comming out of the Coūtry of Valais, it enters very full into the long spacious Lake Leman, from Villeneufue where it remaines mingled the space of twelue howers easie sailing vnto Geneua, where leauing the Lake, it runs with a swift course by Lions.

In the yeare 1600. there was an other of the same Riuer at 3. or 4. reprises, beginning earely in the morning, and continuing vntill eleauen of the clocke, hauing great thundering going before. The boates lay drie. That which seemed admirable, was, that this flowing was but one side of the chanel, towards the towne, in the beginning of winter, &amp; vnder-neath a part of the great bridge, whereas the Cutlers seruants went to gather vp nailes and olde iron. It

is one of the armes of Rhosne, being then aboue fiue foote deepe. The other greater arme towardes the mountaines retired halfe the water. This flowing lasted little; if it had continued but a quarter of an houre, it would haue drowned Saint Geruais Bourg.

               Don RODRIGVE GIRON, and the Earle of Vruegue were so like, as euen they which did serue them and conuerse daylie with them, could not distinguish them, but by their apparrell and carriage of their persones. A. TORQVEMADE in his Hexameron Iourney 1.
            The Earle of Beneuent had a foote-man, to whome a certaine man came, saying that hee was his Brother, and that being young, hee had left his parents. They were so like, as no man could well descerne them, but that hee which came last, seemed to bee some-what elder then the other. And although the foote-man were called by him to goe and receiue his part of a certaine inheritance, yet he sayd alwaies to the other, I knowe you not, I am not of your Countrie: swearing that hee was nothing a kinne to him. Yet the other continued to loue

him as his Brother: so as in the ende the Earle commanded them to goe togither to a certaine ancient Woman who sayd shee was their mother. The footeman went thether, beeing there, notwithstanding anie thing that he could alleage, hee could not put it out of this Womans head, but he was her owne Sonne. More-ouer to moue him the more, shee sayd vnto him, if you bee my Sonne, you should haue a marke on such a foote, and in such a place, which was burnt when you were young. The foote-man wondring thereat, confessed it to bee true. Yet he denied it still that hee was her Sonne: protesting that hee had neuer beene in that place, as it was true: for it was iustefied that he differed in nature from those people, and it was certainely knowne who were his parents. The same Author.
            
            Beeing a boye, I did see an other strange thing in a place neere vnto Segouia, hauing staied foure or fiue daies in a mans house, whose Wife liued also. There were two Daughters so like, as turning but the eye you could not distinguish the one from the other. These young maidens were thirteene or foureteene yeares old: and hauing demanded of the Mother which of them was the elder, shee shewed me the one, saying that shee was halfe an houre elder then the other, for that they were both of one birth, and that with them there came a Son also into the world, who liued with an vncle of his in SEGOVIA. And as I wondred at her speech, shee saied vnto me. The Brother is so like to his two Sisters, as comming to see vs and to be merrie at Easter last, one day he and his eldest Sister changed their apparell, and deceiued both Father and me all the daie long, making great sport that wee did not knowe them, and that we tooke the one

for the other, vntill night, that they made themselues knowne, and yet wee could hardlye beleeue it. In the same Author.
            
            In our time there were in Auignon two Gentlemen Brethren, one resembling an other, both borne at one birth, sonnes to an Audienc

               er of the Popes Court. They liued long, well limbd and strong, flaxen haired, both short sighted, of a sweete speech, gentle spirits, and pleasing aspects. They were both learned, affecting to follow great men, and to deale in affaires. They playde both of the Lute, Song their parts, and did write one like vnto another, the sound of their voyce, words gesture, going and all their actions were so like, as their Father, Mother, and Brethren were deceiued to shewe the difference. IHON WILLEMIN, a learned man, hath confest vnto me, that liuing vsually with these two Bretheren, and talking in a manner hourely vnto them, yet he could not distinguish them, so as thinking to impart some secret vnto the one, hee found afterwards that it was the other: so as it was a reuiuing of SOSIAS in PLAVTVS AMPHITRIO. More-ouer, these two Bretheren haue beene surprised at one instant, and seperated one from another, they haue beene toucht with one desire, and thought vpon the like desseine. Besides one being sicke, the other did likewise feele the apprehension, and did suffer some part of his Brothers greefe. More-ouer, the one not knowing any thing of the other, being both affected to one great woman, shee made them the like answers, but seuerally, and at diuerse houres, vnknowne one vnto an other, to whome the Gentle-woman answered, some-times to the one, thinking it had beene the other, then to the second, whome shee made much of,

vnder this vaile which deceiued her by the report of his countenance with his Brothers. To conclude, the difference could neuer bee knowne but by themselues: the one hauing a certaine marke on his necke, which hee brought from his Mothers wombe, by the impression whereof Nature would make some difference, thereby to take away that perfect resemblance, and to holde her propriety, which is to reioyce in the diuersitie of things; In the 2.

For the loue that was betwixt them, they would lodge in one Chamber, and after they had spent the day together merrily, they would lye together, that they might haue the more commoditie to talke. It happened as they were in bed, the one reading on a Booke, and the other two striuing who should be in the middest, sodenly the vpper plancher of the Chamber fell vpon them, so as all three were smothered vnder the burthen of this ruine. They were much lamented: and vpon this pittifull and fearefull accident, were made these verses following. Memorials of Lions.

There are in the Cittie, Suburbes and Castell, fiue thousand fiue hundred Temples, all in a manner like vnto Chappels: many beeing made with great Trees, one layde vpon the toppe of another. And they had high Towers with-out eyther Yron or Stone, very fine and artificially made. The great Dukes lodging is also of Wood: the which hee holds farre more healthfull, then if it were of harde Stone. The Castell is reasonably strong of Walles and

deepe Ditches. It containes as much ground as the rest of the Citty. On the one side of it remaine the Sins, on the other side the Oprissins, which are as it were ouetseers of the great Dukes treasure. These dispatch all Marchant strange

               s, and assoone as you arriue there, you must deliuer into one of their hands all your goods. Being gone from the Narue, about the 10. of Iuly 1570. I arriued at Moscow about the beginning of August, where I found the great Duke and his people busied to search out some 30. persons, all which dyed by the Hangmans Sword, onely one was cast aliue into boyling water, for that they had receiued presents and money. Most of them were great Noble-men, and very familiar with the Duke. The rest were Marchants of Nowgart, with their Wiues, Children and Families, beeing accused of treason in fauour of the King of Poland. Within fewe dayes after, a horrible plague entred the Cittie of Moscow, and the Countrie about it, with such vyolence, as in lesse then foure moneths there dyed aboue two hundred and fiftie thousand persons. And it was particularly obserued, that in eyght dayes, from the tenth to the eighteenth of August, there dyed 2703. Priests, and this Plague continued so strangely, as in the ende euery man did wonder, if hee mette with any one of his acquaintance as then aliue.
            This extreame misery was followed the yeare after with a strange ruine, the 15. of May. The occasion was, that the Emperour of the Tartares beeing malcontent, that the Muscouite payd him no more a certaine annuall Tribute, and hearing on the other-side, that the great Duke by his tyrannies and murthers, had so wasted his Countries, as they could make no great resistance on

that side, hee did sommon him to paye his Tribute. But the great Duke answered him with reprochefull speeches and scornes. Where-vpon the Tartar left his Countrie about the end of February, hauing an Armie of a hundred thousand Horse, who in two moneths and a halfe, marched almost fiue hundred Germaine Leagues. Being within two dayes iourney of the Dukes frontiers, hee resolued to meete them, giuing them Battaile, but he lost it, with a horrible route and slaughter of his men. The Duke knowing that the Tartar would seeke after him, fledde with great speed as farre off as hee could. Hee was but nine Leagues from Moscow, when as the Tartares came to inuest the Towne, thinking him to bee there. They fiered all the Villages about, and seeing that the Warre would prooue too long for them, they resolued to burne this great Cittie, or at the least the Suburbes thereof. Hauing to that end disposed of their troupes round about, they set fire of all parts, so as it seemed a circle on fire. Then did there rise so vyolent a winde, as in an instant the Towne was fired. This fire was so sodaine, as no man had any leisure to saue himselfe, but where hee was at that very instant. The number of them that were burnt in this fire, came to aboue two hundred thousand: the which happened for that their Houses were all of Wood, and the pauementin the Streetes was of great Sappin Trees, the which being Oylie, made the fire the more violent, so as in foure houres space, the Towne and Suburbes were quite consumed. I and a young-man of Rochell, my Interpretor, were in the middest of the fire, in a ware-house all vaulted of Stone, wonderfully strong, the Walles beeing three foote and a halfe thicke, and had vent but of two

sides: one by the which they went in and out, the which was a good long entrie, and had three Yron doores, distant some sixe foote one from an other. On the other side, there was a window, hauing three Yron dores one halfe a foote from an other, which vents wee did stoppe on the in-side, as well as wee could ▪ yet there came in so great a smoake, as it had beene sufficient to haue smothered vs, if wee had not had a little Beere, where-with wee did some-times refresh our selues. Manie Noble-men and Gentle-men were smothered in Caues, whether they retyred them-selues, for their houses beeing made of great Trees, comming to sincke sodenly, smothered them all. Others beeing consumed to Ashes, stopt all vent: so as for want of ayre, those that were shutte in perished. The poore Country-men twentye miles about, who had saued them-selues there with their Cattell, seeing the fire, retyred them-selues into a great voyde place in the Cittie, which was not paued with Wood as the rest were, yet they were all so roasted there, as one of the tallest men seemed but a Childe, the heate of the fire had so shrunke them vp: and that by reason of great houses that were about it. They were the most hideous and fearefull things to see that could bee imagined. In many parts of that place, men lay vpon heapes aboue halfe a Pike thick: the which did wonderfully amaze mee, not beeing able to comprehend how they should bee heapt so one vppon an other.
            This horrible fire made most part of the battlements of the walles to fall, and splitted all the ordinance that lay vpon the walles, which were made of Bricke after the Anticke fashion, with-out any Rampars or Ditche

about it. Many hauing saued themselues about the walles, were notwithstanding roasted among others; there were manie Italiens and Wallons of my acquaintance. Whilest the fire continued, it seemed to vs that a Million of Cannons thundred togither, and we drempt of nothing but of death, thinking that the fire would continue some daies: by reason of the great circuit of the Cittie, Cas

               ell and Suburbes: But all this was consumed in lesse then foure houres: at the ende whereof the noise ceasing, wee had a desire to see if the Tartares were entred, of whome wee had no lesse feare then of the fire. They bee people made for the Warre, and yet they eate nothing but rootes or some such substance, and drinke nothing but water; and the greatest Lords among them liue vpon no thing but vpon flesh that is sodden betwixt the horse-backe and the saddle wherein hee rides; yet they are stronge men, apt to endure paine and so are their horses, which runne wonderfull swiftly, and goe more ground in one daie feeding but vpon grasse, then ours will doe in three, though they haue store of oates. And therefore the Tartares come easily from farre to assayle the Muscouits. but they come onelie in Sommer, for the commoditie of their horses. Their Countrie is temperate, from whence they depart in the ende of February to bee in Moscouie in the beginning of Iune, and they returne in the ende of it into their Countrie, least they should bee surprized with Winter in Russia: the which happening, they should all die of hunger, by reason of the desartes conteyning aboue 300. Germaine Leagues not inhabited, and therefore without all releefe of victuells, and their horses also hauing no grasse; so as they are forced to make this voiage. Which is aboue

1200. Germaine Leagues, in foure or fiue monethes withall their armie, the which doth commonly consist of a 150. or 200. thousand horse: but their horse-men are ill armed, carrying no other armes but a shirt of maile, with a Iauelin, and a bowe and a
                  •…
               rowes: they knowe not what artillery nor Harguebuzes meanes: hauing but two Citties whereas their Emperor keepes his Court, without any other Townes, villages or houses: but they content them-selues to liue in Tentes which they remooue from place to place.
            To returne to our miserie, hauing listened a little, we might heare some Muscouits running vp and downe through the smoake, who talked of muring vp the portes to keepe out the Tartares, who staied vntil the fire were al quencht. I and my Interpreter, going out of the warehouse, found the ashes so hot, as we durst scarse goe, but necessitie forcing vs, wee did runne to the cheefe port, where wee found fiue and twenty or thirtie men that had escaped the fire: with whome in a short time wee did mure vp that port and the rest, and kept watch all night with some hargubuzes that were preserued in the fire. In the morning seeing that the Cittie was not to be held by so fewe men as we were, wee sought some meanes to enter into the Castell, the entrie whereof was then in a manner inaccessible. Hee that commanded there was very glad to heare our Intentiō, &amp; called vnto vs that we should be very welcome. But there was great difficulty to enter by reason of the Bridges that were burnt, so as wee were forced to climbe ouer Walles, hauing heigh Sappin Trees for Ladders which they had cast out vnto vs, in the which they had cut notches to keepe vs from slyding, Wee did climbe vp with great difficultie, for

besides the apparent danger of those vneasie Ladders, wee carried about vs the summe of 4000. Dallers, and some pretious stones: the which did trouble vs much to climbe vp theese trees, and that which did increase our feare was, that before our eyes wee did see some of our companions, (hauing nothing but their bodies to preserue,) rowle downe from the top of these trees into the ditch full of bodies that were burnt: and wee could not goe but vpon dead bodies, the heapes whereof were so thick in euery place as we were forced to go ouer them, as if they had beene hills to mount vpon: and that which did much trouble vs, going vpon them, armes and legges did breake, the members of these poore Creatures, beeing calcined and dried vp through the heate of fire. Sinking thus into these miserable carcases, the bloud and filth did bound vpon vs. The which caused such a stench through out the whole Cittie, as it was impossible to remaine there.
            The 25. of May at night, as wee did attend in great perplexity what the Tartares would attempt against vs, who were 400. or there abouts within the Castell, the Tartares (whom we had saluted with our shot, and ouerthrowne some of them that had approched to neere one of the Castell gates) beganne to turne head the way by the which they came, with such speede as the next morning all this storme was past for the which hauing praised GOD, and giuen order for our affaires, as the present calamity would permit, wee departed from this desolate Countrie.
         
         
            
            A wonderfull drawing of bloud.
            
               I Was called to the suburbes of Saint Germaine, to the house of IOHN MATIAV dwelling at the signe of Saint Michell, to visit and dresse a young man about 28. yeares olde, of a sanguin complexion beeing seruant to one of the Admirall Birons Stewardes. Hee had fal
                  •…
               e forward with his head vpon a stone, and had hurt himselfe on the left side in the boane towardes the fore▪ head, by meanes of which blowe it had made a contused or bruzed wounde, without any fracture of the boane, so the seauenth daie he fell into a continuall feuer with a rauing, and a great inflamation, for that the hairy scalpe was hurt, and with all he had a great swelling ouer all his head and necke, hauing his face wonderfully disfigured beeing vnable to see or speake, neither yet to swallowe any thing, but that which was verie Liquide. Seeing these accidents, although the daie beefore (which was the eight after his hurt) hee had beene let bloud by GERMAIN AGACE a Maister Barber, who had drawne from him foure pallettes of bloud, and seeing the Accidents so great, and the patient stronge, I let him bloud againe, and drewe from him foureteene pallets of bloud at that one time: then the next daie seeing that neither his feuer, nor anie of the other Accidents were anie whit asswaged, but rather increased, I did let him bloude againe, and drewe from him foure pallets more. The next daie following, these strange Accidents, beeing nothing decreased, I was of an

opinion to let him bloud againe, yet I durst not doeit alone, considering the great quantitie had beene drawne from him. I therefore intreated Monsier VIOLAINE, a Doctor of Phisick, a learned Man, and of a good iudgement, to visit the patient. Hauing felt his pulce, and finding it very strong, seeing also the great swelling, and the vehemencie of the inflamation, hee was of opinion that he should be speedily let bloud, and being told that they had drawne 22. pallets from him, hee sayd vnto mee, although they had drawne more, yet must they let him bloud againe? seeing that the two cheefe reasons that induce vs to let him bloud are apparent, that is, the greatnesse of the disease, and the strength of the patient. Being glad to heare his opinion, I drew from him three pallets more in his presence, and would haue drawne more, but he put it off vntill the after-noone, and then I drew two pallets more, which in all made seuen and twenty pallets (euery pallet of Paris conteining three ounces and more) the which were drawne from the patient in foure dayes. The night following he rested very well, and the next day I found him with out any feauer, the swelling was greatly fallen, and his inflamation almost gone, except his vpper eye-lids, and the soft grisle of his eares, which places did impostume and cast forth great abondance of filthe: So hee was fully cured, with the helpe of GOD, by those remedies, the which with-out his blessing had beene invaine. Maister AMBROSE PARE lib. 9. Chap. 14.
            BABTISTA FVLGOSE, in the 1. Booke of his Examples, Chap. 6. reports, that an Italian Priest called GERMAIN, hauing beene let bloud, lost all remembrance of Letters, and not of ordinary and common things: so as

he could neither reade nor write, no more then if hee had neuer learned it: and continued a whole yeare in that estate. At the ende of the yeare, at the same time, and in the same place being let bloud, hee recouered his knowledge of reading and writing, which he had before. TH. ZVINGER in the 1. volume of his Theater. Booke. 1.
            I haue added this History, although it were of an age before ours, because it shewes of a strange letting of bloud.
         
         
            A desired Graue.
            
               IN the time of a great plague afflicting that part of the Countrie where I dwell, I did obserue a wonderfull resolution in all the simple people: and for that all of one house died, in one moneth. Infants, young and olde, they were no more amazed, they wept no more. I did see some that were afraied to remaine behinde, as in a horrible sollitarines: neither did I note anie other care in them but of their graues. They greeued to see dead carcases lying in the fields, exposed to the mercie of wilde beasts. A graue alone was held a great happinesse amongest them. Some made their owne graues beeing in good helth: others lay downe in them being yet a liue. And a worke man of mine with his hands and his feete drewe the earth vpon him in dying. Was not this an enterprise some-what like vnto the Romaine soldiars, whome they found after the battaile of Cannas, with their heads thrust into the holes, which they had made and filled vp with their handes, in

smothering of themselues. MONTAIGNE Booke 3. of his Essaies. Chap. 12.

               THere are some Iudges who to descouer Witches, and to make them confesse vpon the racke, the horrible crimes which they haue committed, are accustomed to shaue the haire in euery part of their bodies, &amp; to change their apparell, with this perswasion that the will sooner confesse. BODIN in his Demonomania, seemeth to allowe of this, aboue all other expedients. And so doth SPRANGER. About a hundred yeares since an Inquisitor called CVMAN, held this course with one and forty Witches whome he caused to bee burnt. The like hath beene obserued by Maister IOSSE DAMHOVDERE, a learned Lawier in Flanders. Whoin his cryminall practise. Chap. 36. number 21. Reportes a memorable Historie to this purpose. It is not vndiscreetly done (sayth hee) to shaue all the haire of the bodies of certaine persons, and then to torture them; for by that meanes you shall hinder the force of such remedies as they vse to make themselues impassible, and without feeling in their torments: the which they are accustomed to practise by Magick Artes, Sorceries, Inchantments, and execrable charmes: as I my selfe haue seene, during the time that I was a Councellor in the Citty of Bruges: especially in an olde woman, who in her carriage, apparell, kinde of life, manners (which in shewe were irreprehensible) did so carry

her selfe, as all did reuerence, respect and esteeme her, no lesse then one of the Apostells of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, for that shee did as it were miraculously cure the Children of many honorable families, making crooke-backes straight, setting legges and thighes that were broken sodenly, not by art nor by any medycines: but by words, inioyning some particular deuotion as a fast of three daies with bread and water: to say the Lordes praier thrice: to goe in pilgrimage to our Ladie of Ardembourg, or to Saint ARNOVL of Audenbourg, or to Saint IOSSE: or to Saint HVBERT in the Forest of Ardennes: or to cause a Masse or two to be song euerie daie, and to assist at them deuoute'y, or to cause some praiers or smal suffrages to be sayd at their charge. These deuotions dulie performed, with in fewe daies after the diseased were cured, through the hope which they and their friends had in this woman. Her carriage &amp; miracles being published through the Country: the Councellors and Iudges (whose Iudgements were perfect, and did see more cleerely then the popular) caused this woman to be apprehended in the night, &amp; carried to prison, but not very straightly kept, where the next day she was examined, how, by what means, by vertue of what alliance, &amp; with what cōfidency, she did those cuers? She alwaies answered confidently, that she had done all with a good intent and deuotion, for holie respects, and therefore they ought not to imprison her so ignominiously. Yet the Councel mooued by certaine &amp; apparent presumptions, appointed that she shold be tortured: being brought vnto the rack and mildly exhorted to confesse the truth; she persisted still in the negatiue, with an assured countenance: mayntayning, that shee had done nothing

but by Lawefull meanes, and without conference with any euil spirit. There was present at her examination the Bourgomaster of Bruges, a man much afflicted with the goute, by reason whereof during her examination, he did some-times groone and crie out like a man that had beene rackt. The olde woman turning to him, sayd, Maister Bourgomaster will you be quite freed from this torment of the goute. If you please, I will cure you, and that soone. Is it possible (sayd the Bourgomaster). I would willingly giue two thousand Crownes to haue ease, I will giue it thee if thou canst performe what thou saiest. Then the Councellors and Officers that were present sayd vnto him. Sir beware what you say and promise. Beleeue vs (and sending this Witch into her Chamber) and heare quietly what we will say vnto you. The woman beeing carried away, they added. See into what daunger you are brought, through a vaine perswasion, that this woman, like vnto the Apostles, can by Lawfull meanes cure your goute. In outward shewe, all that she doth seemeth holie and diuine, but if you looke narrolie into her actions, there is a great difference. Let her be called againe, and demanded howe she pretends to cure you: if she promiseth to helpe you miraculously as the Apostles did diseases in their time, and that shee followeth the course which they did, we will not contradict her, knowing that GODS arme is not shortned. If she vseth vnlawfull meanes, and relies vpon them, both shee and all her inuentions ought rightly to be suspected. Being therefore called backe againe, one of these Councellors askt her: If thou presumest to cure the Bourgomaster of his gout, what meanes and remedies will thou applie, no other (sayth shee) but that the Bourgomaster

beleeue for certaine, that I haue power to cure him: hee shall then be whole and sound of his feete. Hauing spoken these words, shee was sent back vnto her Chamber. Then the Councellors with one voyce and consent said vnto the Bourgomaister and to the Assistance. You may vnderstand by the answer of this Woman, that she doth nothing but by the power of Sathan, &amp; that she doth vnder-take to cure the Bourgomaster by vnlawfull meanes: for in her healing she doth not imitate the holy Apostles, who did cure diseases by faith and the power of GOD. saying vnto the Lame; In the name of our Lord IESVS CHRIST rise vp and walke. And to the blinde; In the name of our Lord IESVS CHRIST receiue thy sight: the one recouered his legges, and the other his sight, not by any humaine helpe, but by the Diuine power, in the name and faith of IESVS CHRIST. But this Witch doth brag to cure him, so as the patient trust in her, and beleeue that she can do it. This faith (or misbeleefe) is directly contrary to the Apostles faith. This answer duly waighed and considered of; the Bourgomaister being sorry for that which he had said, would not commit himselfe to the olde Woman, but was ashamed of his lightnesse. To returne vnto the Witch, for that she did persist in the negatiue of the offences where-with she was charged with apparent presumptions of truth: it was decreed againe, that she should be put to the Racke: where being roughly handled, shee made confession of some light faults. As for Sorcerie and Witch-craft, shee denied it confidently. Shee was therefore let loose and shutte into her Chamber. A while after beeing charged againe vpon new presumptions, shee was drawne to the Rack, where shee confessed certaine light faults, as shee had

done before. But feeling her selfe tormented, shee beganne to crye out and say; Take mee from hence, else I shall poyson you all with the stincke of my excrements, the which I can no longer holde. There were harde by certaine Vaultes or Priuies, whether some of the assistance were of opinion they should suffer her to goe. Others that were better aduised, would by no meanes haue her let loose, least there should fall out some new difficultie worse then the former. But by the pluralitie of voyces shee was vnbound, and ledde where shee pretended to goe, where shee stayed aboue halfe an houre, without returning, not-with standing that shee had beene called twise or thrise: In the ende shee was forced to come from thence, to bee layde againe vpon the Racke, the which they began to straine more then before. Shee with-out any lamenting or crying out as shee did before, began to laugh, and knocking with her fingers, shee began at the Iustice, saying. You my Maisters, and thou wicked Hang-man, doe what you will, your crueltie cannot preuaile against mee. Most of the assistants thought that the Diuell had made her impassible. For that shee would not aduowe any thing of that where-with shee was charged by new informations: but beeing stretcht out vppon the Rack, shee did eyther laughe or sleepe. So as beeing vnbound, shee was carryed againe to her accustomed place. Afterward some other witnesses were heard, and newe proofes allowed: Wherevpon it was ordeyned, that shee should bee the third time tortured. But before shee was layde vpon the Racke, wee caused her to bee powled, and all her hayre to bee shauen: then was shee layde vppn the Racke againe, and tortured verye

sore. Continuing still thus obstinate, some of the companie remembred, that they had not shauen the hayre vnder her Arme-pittes, and in some other places which I name not. They called certaine Women, who laying hand on her, found little scrowles of Parchment thrust into her priuie partes, conteyning certaine names of euill spirites, and some Crosses betwixt both. These scrowles beeing deliuered vnto the Iustice, were the cause that shee was stretcht againe vppon the Racke, where-as then shee beganne to crye at the first pull, and to confesse euery pointe of that where-with shee was charged by three Informations.
            Beeing demanded the cause of her obstinate perseuerance in her former denialls, shee sayde, that if they had not shauen away all her hayre, and depriued her of those breuets, the trueth had neuer come out of her mouth, for that the force of the euill spirit was such, as with the helpe of her haire, and those billets shee was impassible, as it appeared. Some condemned her to bee burnt aliue, others for the most part to doe a rigorous penance publicklye, and then to bee banished for euer, vppon paine of burning. According to this last aduise and counsell, shee was set vppon a Scaffolde, and a false Periwigge made for her, the which was taken from her head by the Hang-man, and cast into a great fire made to that ende: and shee was ledde by two Senators and the Aduocate of Bruges, out of the Territorie. So shee retyred out of the Countrie of Flanders into Zeland, remaining some certaine weekes at Middelbourgh, where shee returned presentlye to her first trade. FLORENT DAM, Iudge of the Towne was aduertised presently by vs, of all the cause that had

past in the processe of this woman; and in fauour of Iustice, there was sent vnto him a coppie of the Informations, of her confession vpon the Racke and of the sentence that was giuen against her. By meanes whereof he had a watche ouer her, and discouering by diuerse apparent presumptions, that shee did continue in her diuilish sorceries, caused her to bee apprehended and put in prison, who hauing straightly examined her by her voluntary confession, and according to the former Iudgement, he condemned her to be burnt, the which was executed. Then he sent Letters of aduice to the Councell of Bruges, of all that had past, &amp; by mouth made a large discourse to DAMHOVDERE, from whom we had this relation.

            About the yeare 1545. there was discouered at Cordoa, a very famous and renowmed Towne in Andalousia in Spaine, that which followeth. A Childe of a poore familye called MAGDELINE de la Croix, of the age of fiue yeares, was put by the Parents or Tutors into a Couent of Nunnes. It is not knowne whether it were for deuotion or for pouertie. Beeing thus young, and ignorant as yet what euill was, they say not-withstanding (so inscrutable are the Iudgements of GOD) that the Diuell appeared vnto her, in the forme of a blacke and hideous Moore. Although at the first sight shee were greatly terrified, yet this enemie did so flatter her, and did promise her so many pretty workes where-in Children take delight, as shee did accustome her selfe to talke familiarly with him, but alwaies inioyning her, that she (who was fearefull) should discouer nothing of this association. In this time the child seemed to

haue a wonderfull witte, quicke, and differing in disposition from others: so as shee was much esteemed of the ancient Nunnes, and of other young Maides. Beeing come to the age of 12. yeares or there-abouts, shee was sollicited by the Diuell to marry her-selfe vnto him: and for her dowrie he promised her to worke so, as for thirty yeares or there abouts, shee should liue in such opinion of Holynesse through-out all Spaine, as there had neuer beene the like. Whilest that MAGDELEINE (vnder the opinion of this contract) spent the time in her Chamber with this vncleane spirit, who entertained her by his illusions: An other Diuell tooke the forme and resemblance of MAGDELEINE, &amp; was in the Church, in the Cloyster, and in all the assemblies of Nunnes, with great shew of deuotion. Besides after that hee had done MAGDELEINS seruice in the Church, he let her vnderstand all that was done in the world, whereof giuing aduertisment to those that had her already in great reputation, shee was esteemed to bee a Holy Virgin, and began to haue the name of a Prophetesse. By reason whereof, (although shee were not yet of full age) shee was chosen Abbesse by a general consent of the Monkes and all the Nunnes. When as the Nunnes receiued the Sacrament on dayes accustomed among them, the Priest did alwayes cry out, that they had taken away one of his Ostes, the which was carryed by the aboue-named Angell to MAGDELEINE, who was in the middest of her Sisters, the which she put into her mouth, &amp; shewed as a great miracle. They say moreouer, that if by chance MAGDELINE was not present when Masse was sayde, although there were a Wall betwixt them, yet when the Priest did lift vp the Corpus Domini, this Wall did

riue in two, that MAGDELINE might see it, and eate it afterwards. It is also a notorious thing, that if in any sollemne Feast-day, the Nunnes did lead her in procession, to make the acte more reuerent by some extraordinarie wonder, shee was raised from the ground in the presence of them all, aboue three Cubittes high. Sometimes shee carryed a little Image of IESVS CHRIST, new borne and naked, and in weeping (for shee could powre out aboundance of teares when shee pleased) her haire grewe downe to her heeles, where-with shee couered the Image: then sodenly her haire appeared in their first length. Shee did many such other illusions, especially on sollemne dayes, to make all more admirable: These were her principall miracles.
            In the meane time, the Pope, the Emperour, and the great men of Spaine did write vnto her: and by their Letters did beseeche her, to haue them and their affaires in recommendation in her prayers: yea they asked her aduise in matters of very great importance: as it appeared by Letters that were found afterwards in her Closset. More-ouer, there were many Ladyes and Gentlewomen which did not swadle their Children new borne, before the Abbesse MAGDELINE had with her holye hands toucht and blest the swadling bands: in like sort, all the Nunnes of Spaine were wonderfully well pleased to haue such a Mother, to whome they did attribute a good part of the holynesse of their Orders. In the end GOD would haue this fraude of Sathan layde open. For MAGDELINE after that shee had spent about thirtie yeares in this acquaintance with the Diuell, and beene Abbesse twelue yeares, shee began to growe wearie of her passed life. There-fore after that she had detested

these Diuilish Artes, and the horrible society of Sathan, shee discouered freely (and when as they least dreamt of it) this notable wickednesse, vnto the Visiters of the Order. Some Spaniards of credit and very learned, haue reported vnto mee, that MAGDELINE knowing that the Nunnes had discouered her fraude: and that (fearing to bee accused,) shee had preuented them, confessing her offence first: for that the custome of Spaine is, that if any one did freely confesse an offence, which deserued a gr
                  •…
               euous punishment, hee was pardoned. Euery one was amazed at this confession, the newes thereof was so strange, and they were of opinion to inquire more curiously of this matter. To proceede more lawfully therein, and with better order: MAGDELINE was imprisoned in the Couent where she was Abbesse: where beeing examined, shee confest all: and yet the Moore continued his illusions still, for whilest shee was in prison watcht narrowly by men that were at the dore of the prison, and that they did examine her cause: the Nunnes beeing gone into the Church at midnight to sing Mattins; MAGDELINES fantosme came and sat in the Chaire in the Quier, after the accustomed manner, and was seene vppon her knees, as it were praying, and attending the other Nunnes: so as euery one thought verely it had beene their Abbesse, and that the Visiters had suffered her to come vnto the mid-night Mattins, for the great testimonies shee gaue of her repentance. But the next daye following, the Nunnes vnderstanding that MAGDELINE came not out of prison, reported vnto the Visitors what they had seene the night before. They hauing well examined the matter, found that MAGDELINE went not out of prison.

Her processe was in the ende sent to Rome, and for that shee had voluntarily confest her offence, shee was absolued. CASSIODORE RENEY in his Relations: ZVINGER in the Theater of mans life. volum 5. lib. 4. BODIN lib. 2. of his Demonomania. Chap. 7.
            I will tell you what I haue seene, beeing at Calaris a Towne in the Iland of Sardinia, whereas then they talked of the arraignment of certaine Witches, who (they sayd) had had conference with them of France and of Nauarre, which had beene sought out and punnished not long before. A very faire Gentlewoman, about seauenteene or eighteene yeares of age, being inticed by one of these Witches, came to haue conference with a Diuill, who came some-time to see her, in the shape of a goodly man: by meanes whereof he deceiued her, and had his pleasure on her, shee beeing fallen greatly in Loue with him. Hauing entertayned her some-time, they descouer that she was a Witch: and although shee were conuicted, yet could they not get her to confesse her faults, but contynuing obstinate, she beleeued confidently that the Diuill would saue her, as he had promised, and transported with the affection which she bare him, she spake many things which did terrefie them that heard her, To conclude, shee suffred her-selfe to bee put aliue into the fire, calling still vpon this Diuill, and so perished miserably. ANT de TORQVEMADO in the 3. iourney of his Hexam.
            
            An other Gentlewoman, rich, faire and of a very great quality, seeing a knight her neighbour, who was rich and a goodly Gentleman, shee fell in Loue with him, looking on him with great affection, but not descouering her passion. Some-time after, the Diuill, espying this

Gentlewoman, tooke vpon him the shape of this knight, and proceedes in such sort, as hee winnes the Gentlewoman, vpon condition that hee should marry with her. Shee who thought it had beene her knight, accepted of him, and receiued him manie nights into her Chamber where hee late with her. In this sort they spent some monethes, during the which the Diuill perswaded her not to send any message vnto him▪ for that their businesse must continue secret: and when hee should see her, hee would not seeme to knowe her: and therefore although shee were some-times before the true Knight, shee made no shewe of her affection, as also shee imputed it to dissimulation that hee spake not vnto her, and gaue no signe of that which concerned their Allyance. Some-times after, the Gentlewomans Mother gaue her Daughter a certaine relick to weare about her. Whereat the fayned knight counter fetting an amazement, came no more, and so some monethes were spent: during the which the Gentlewoman knowing that the true Knight made Loue to another, shee grewe into an extreame iealousie: and not able to endure this distemperature in her braine, shee sent one daie to intreate him to come and speake with her, hauing some-thing to say vnto him. The Knight ignorant of the cause, but other-wise a courteous Gentleman, went presently vnto her, found her alone, and sayd that hee was come to heare and receiue her commandements. The Gentlewoman seeing him, and hearing him speake, like one that did scarce knowe her, shee beganne to complaine of him, for that so longtime hee had not cared to see her nor speake to her. The Knight much amazed as one that did not conceiue the meaning of this woman,

answered her in such sort as shee thought he dissembled to much. Growing therefore into choller, she beganne to chide him, saying, that seeing hee had enioyed her so long, there were no reason hee should nowe thinke to for-sake her, but he must performe the promise which he had made to marry her: and if he would do other-wise, besides that shee would make her complaintes to almightie GOD &amp; the world, she would force him to the execution of his promise, seeing that hee would not willingly performe it. The Knight grewe more amazed then before, and made her answere, that hee vnderstood nothing of her Language, and that she mistooke herself, for that hee had neuer had any secret conference with her: had promised her nothing, neither could shee demande any thing at his hands. The Gentlewoman mad with this answere, in replying sayd. Do you not remember that you did this and this with mee, repeating euery thing that had happened vnto her with the Imposter in the Knights shape: adding withall, you cannot auoide it to bee my husband and I your wife. The Knight beeing much amazed, beganne to protest that shee was much deceiued to thinke it to be true, and contending thereon, the Gentlewoman did note vnto him the day of the promise, which was vpon a sollemne feast daie. Then the Knight sware vnto her that vpon that daie, nor three weekes before, nor three weekes after he had not beene in the Towne, neither in his house, nor in hers: the which I will prooue vnto you so plainely, as you shall rest satisfied, and if any one hath deceiued you in my name, I am not to bee blamed. But to the ende you should not doubt of the truth of my saying, I will presently verefie it. Then (not departing from her,) hee

caused seauen or eight of his house-hold seruants and others to come, who vnacquainted with the cause, did sweare that the Knight had spoken the truth, and that all that time hee had beene aboue fiftie Leagues from thence. The Gentlewoman much troubled with this deposition, beganne to remember some particularities, and to apprehend that no mortall man could haue done them: but that they were Imposturs of Satan: so as soone after the retreate of the true Knight, shee beganne to finde the cause of this abuse: and detesting her foolish concupiscence, humbling her-selfe, shee resolued not to thinke anie more of marriage, but ended the remainder of her daies in a Monasterie.

But this vertuous Gentle-woman hauing often-times reiected him, hee was so blinde as to imagine that her denials were but allurements, and setling this vnworthy conceit in his braine, finding his friend to be one day absent, hee went and lay vnder the Gentle-womans bed, hoping that night being come, and she lying alone, he might easily inioy her. Being retyred, and layd to her rest, before her Chamber-maide went away into a neere Closet, shee commanded her to looke about if there were not any thing that might disquiet her rest in the night.

P. IOVIVS Booke 34. of his Histories of our time. The treasor of CHARLES Duke of Bourgondy wonne by the Suisses, in the battailes which they gaue him neere to Gransoa &amp; Morest amounted to great sums of gold and siluer, both coined and vncoyned: the true value whereof was not iustly known, for that at that time the Suisses did more esteeme the heads of their pikes, halberds and their swords, then the gold or siluer of forren Princes. About the yeare 1520. a yong man simple in all his behauior called LEONARD LIRNIMAN, Sonne to a Tailer of Basill, being entred (they knew not how) into a Grotte or Caue, which is not far from the towne, where hee had past farther then anie

other, he tolde wonders at his returne. Hauing carried with him a great waxe-candle that was blest and light when as he entred. Going farre into the Caue, hee first past an iron dore: then hee went on from Chamber to Chamber vntill he found greene and stately gardins. In the midest of it was a hall richely furnished: and in it a verie faire Maide, carrying on her head a Crowne of gold, with her haire hanging downe, but from the Nauel downe-ward it was an horrible Serpent. Shee tooke LEONARD by the hand, &amp; led him to a Cofet of iron, about the which did lye two great black dogges, which beganne to barke horribly against him. But the Maide beganne to threaten them, and causing them to bee still, shee takes a great bundell of keyes which hunge about her necke, opens the Cofer and drawes forth all sortes of Medaills, of gold, siluer and copper: most of the which shee presented to this young man, who shewed them after-wards to manie in Basill. Hee added that this Maide sayd vnto him, that shee was issued from a Royall stocke: and that shee had beene monstrously transformed in that sort long since by horrible Imprecations: neither did shee hope for any deliuery, vntill that a chast young man, who had beene neuer poluted in anie sort, had kist her thrice. Then shee should recouer her first forme, and for a recompence shee would giue vnto the young man that should free her, the Treasure conteyned in that Cofer. Hee did affirme, that there-vpon hee came verie neere vnto her, and had kist her twise, but at either of them shee made such greeuious and horrible faces, as hee thought shee would deuower him or teare him in a thousand peeces.

Being carried by some disordred people into a Tauerne, hee could neuer afterwards finde the entry, nor the descent into the Caue: for the which the poore wretch did often lament and weepe bitterly. Euery one may see that this Maide was a Satanicall illusion. And on the other side the ancient Romaine Medayles which hee brought out of this Caue, and sold to diuers Bourgeses of Basill, shewe that there might bee some hidden Treasure in that Caue, kept by some couetous Companion of Satan: as in the mines of gold, the worke-men doe some-times incounter with euill spirits which torment them strangely. After this young man, an other borne at Basill, prest with extreame necessitie in a deere yeare went into the Caue, hoping to finde this Treasure for the releefe of his famelie. But hauing gonne but a little way, and found nothing but dead mens boanes, hee was so terrefied, as without looking behinde him, hee speedely recouered the entrie of the Caue, and returned all amazed to his house being emptie handed.

Beeing there, they let downe the Chaine with the Bucket, the which was molten with some part of the Chaine. The Iacobin returned very angrie to Leon, complaines to the Smith that hee had made the Chaine much slenderer then hee had commanded. The Smith makes an other much greater then the first. The same being done with a Bucket proportionable vnto it: the Iacobin goes the second time to the Mountaine with his companions, and lets downe the Chaine and Bucket as at the first: But it succeeded as before, and almost worse: for sodenly there came out of this hollow place, a Ball of fire so great, as the Iacobin and his companions thought to haue dyed there: at the least they were so amazed, as they had no more list to meddle with that fire, but returned much terrified vnto the Towne, without euer speaking more of the Mountaine, or of the Treasure. I haue knowne a Priest in the same Towne, who hauing acquaintance with a Spanish Treasurer, had oportunitie by his meanes to send a Letter to the King of Spaine, in the which hee beseeched his Maiestie to furnish him with 200. slaues to worke in this Mountaine, promising to drawe forth wonderfull great Treasures. The King sent him word, that he should worke at his owne charge if he would: as for him, hee had no slaues to send him. So the Mountaine remained still in that place, with-out stirring

or any more visiting of the Priest, or of any other after him. IEROSME BENZO a Milanois. lib. 2. of the Historie of the New found world. Chap. 16.
            ENCISO a Spaniard, hauing with his company defeated certaine Indians which kept him from forraging of their country, he entred into their chiefe Village, &amp; there found store of bread, fruits, rootes, &amp; other things to eat, where-with he refresht him-selfe and his men. Then they went to search along the bankes of the riuer which was neere, where they found great store of stuffe, Couerlets, and vessell of earth and wood, which they had hidden in the Reeds, with about 120000. crowns in gold wrought, the which COMACCO Lord of the Village had hiddē there thinking to saue it from the Spaniards hands. And if certaine Indians had not discouered this treasure vnto them, they had neuer found it, &amp; yet they were faine to torture them, to make them confesse where it was. BENZO lib. 2. Chap. 2. But this treasure, and all others discouered here or there in our time, are but a handfull of siluer in respect of those of the Kings of Peru, as well in their stately Garden, where all was of gold, as in their Cabinet, where euery thing created or artificiall, was to be seene of pure gold. The ransome of ATABALIPPA, amounting to aboue sixty two Millions of gold, and would haue beene aboue a hundred Millions. If PIZARRE had had the patience &amp; in the end the Treasures of the Temple of the Sunne, the which were greater, and were spoyled by the Spaniards, who afterwards slue one another, &amp; spoiled the Land to enrich the Sea, as their owne Histories do confesse.
            When as the Emperor made warre against the Princes of Germaine, a rich Gentleman turned the chanell of a Riuer which past by his Castle, and in a deepe ditch

in the sayd chanell, hid all that he had of any value, and then brought the Riuer to his accustomed course: yet the Spaniards discouered this Treasure of them-selues, they turned the water and found out all, then digging farther, they found other goods, but almost all was consumed in processe of time.

And as for King Philip, this torment spared him as little, for he had scarse put his foote into an other barke, when as the ship in which he went, sunke into the Sea, so great was the furie of the windes.

               AMong other strong places which the Turkes haue taken in Hungary from the Christians, we may name Alba Iulia, the which was yeelded vp by that Traitor LADISLAVS LEREZIN, who commanded there in the name of MAXIMILIAN the Emperour in the beginning of Iune, in the yeare 1566. although he had beene aduertised, that within two dayes he should bee releeued. The place beeing yeelded by composition, first the Turkes cut all the Soldiers throates, except some few which saued them-selues pollitikely. As for LADISLAVS, he was carryed bound hand and foote to SELIM, and accused that hee had cruelly slaine some Turkish prisoners, for the which hee was condemned by SELIM, and deliuered to his accusers, to vse as they pleased. They therefore put him into a great Pipe, stickt full of long Nailes, and then rowled him downe from a high Mountaine, so as the Nailes ranne through him, and hee dyed in horrible Torments. His Sonne partaker of his Treason dyed miserably, without meanes, and abandoned of all men, hauing sold all his lands and his goods, and wickedly consumed what he had. I. LEONCLAIVS, in the supply of the Annales of Turky. SOLYMAN father to SELIM, did cruelly put to death the soldiers of the garrison of Buda, who had forced their Captaine to yeeld that impregnable Fort vnto the Turkes. As for the Captaine, he was preserued &amp; honored. A traytor in the Towne of Rhodes, did many seruices vnto SOLIMAN, vpon a promise to haue one of SOLIMANS daughters in mariage. The Iland &amp; Towne being wone, he presented him selfe to SOLIMAN, who caused him to be fleid aliue, saying,

that he was a Christian, and that he pretended to marry a Turkish wife, they must therefore take off his old skinne. Being thus flayed, they laide him vpon a bed all couered with Salt, where he dyed in vnspeakable torments. CAMERARIVS in his Historicall Meditations, Chap. 7.
         
         
            Earthquakes.
            
               THE yeare one thousand fiue hundreth and eight, at two of the clock on a wednesday morning, the earth began to quake in such manner at Constantinople, that diuers Steeples fell downe, the Chimneys tumbled to the ground, the walles crackt in sunder, and many stately buildings were ouer-throwne, with the ruines whereof a great number of persons were slaine. No Man knew where to saue him-selfe. The people running out of their houses, gotte into large voide places and Gardens, so to escape all danger. For the Earth-quake lasted all that morning, without intermission, and continued forty dayes after, in such sort that one might easily feele and discerne it euery houre. Annales of Turkie, published by I. LEONCLAIVS. Doctor GARCEVS in his Meteorologie, briefly describes 163. Earth-quakes, mentioned in Histories before &amp; after the comming of our Sauiour vnto the yeare 1564. We will present that which he speaketh of those of our time, following the scope of this our collection of Histories.
            Vpon the 14. day of September 1509. an horrible Earth-quake so shooke the Cittie of Constantinople, for the space of eighteene dayes, that all the walles towards the Sea, and all the houses adioyning, were quite ouerthrowne,

&amp; Ditches filled vp with the ruines. The Castle was throwne downe where the Turke layes his treasure, together with his fiue Towers, and the Palace where-as the Lyons are kept. In like manner all the conduits that conuey water from Danubius to Constantinople were shaken and spoiled. The straight of the Sea betweene the Cittie and the Towne of Pera, moued in such manner, that the water flashed ouer the walles on eyther side. The Custome-house was cleane ouer-turned into the Water. Thirteene thousand persons were slaine with ruines in Earthquake.
            The yeare following, almost all Italy was shaken with diuerse reiterated Earth-quakes. The yeare 1517. an Earth-quake in Germanie ouer-threwe two thousand houses and Granges at Nordlingen and there-about. All Portugall was shaken the yeare 1531. Fifteene hundreth fayre great Houses were ouer-throwne in the Cittie of Lisbon: and almost all the Churches fell downe. This Earth-quake endured eight dayes, and seauen or eyght times a day shooke the Cittie exceedingly. Also the ground opened in many places, whence issued a contagious ayre that engendred a Plague, which carryed awaye an exceeding multitude of people. Two yeares after, there was an Earth-quake at Tergow in Zwitzerland, which turned a pritty bigge Riuer from his course, where-into it entred not againe, till it had vnder-mined and ouer throwne a little Hill that hemmed it in. Presently there-vpon the Towne of Basill was shaken very sore with three seuerall Earth quakes, in lesse then a moneth.
            In the yeare 1537. the Country of Pouzol was so forely shaken with Earth-quakes, for the space of twenty

moneths and aboue that not an edifice remained whole and entire. But toward the end of September, in the yeare following, this Earth-quake began againe with such vehemencie, and with-out discontinuing eyther night or day, that the Sea reculed two hundreth paces backe, where-vpon ensued the taking of a huge quantity of Fish. The 30. day of the same moneth, a great continent of land betweene the foote of the Mountaine called Barbaro, and the Sea by the Lake Auerna, seemed to rise vp, and suddenly to take the forme of a Mountaine. The next morning about two of the clocke, this Mountaine of earth cleauing in sunder, began to vomit forth flames of fire, with a wonderfull noyse. Amidest those flames it cast out Pumyce stones and Flints, with such a company of stinking Ashes, that they couered all the ruines of Pouzol, and the fields adioyning: the Trees were borne downe, and the Vines a quarter of a mile about were reduced to powder, The Foules and Beasts of the fields had their share of it. As for the inhabitants of Pouzel, they saued them-selues in Naples. These stinking Ashes blewe aboue eyght miles abroad, beeing very drye close to the ouer-ture, but sulpharous and moyste a farre off. More-ouer, a great and mightie Mountaine of those Pumyce-stones and Flint-stones, and Ashes, grewe vp by the ouer-ture in one night, a thousand paces high and more, hauing many euents, whereof two continued a long time after. The flames endured diuers moneths.
            The twentith day of Ianuary 1538. Basil was shaken againe with an Earth-quake, and two yeares after in the moneth of December all Germanie had experience of it, with the ruines and spoiles of many buildings. The

yeare 1541. a valley in Suisserland was shaken, and neere to the Apenine a torrent of meruailous stinking sulphure was seene running along the fields. The yeare 1551. vpon the 28. day of Ianuary Lisbon in Portugall was shaken with a newe earth-quake, which ouerthrewe two hundreth houses, &amp; killed aboue a thousand persons. In September the yeare following, there was another earthquake at Basil, as also in diuers townes of Misnia, &amp; sundry places thereabout, whereof ensued many ruines, plagues &amp; violent death. The next yeare after, about the moneth of August, the Country all along the riuer of Elba in Saxony had a part of the like visitation. GARCA

               VS addeth another strange earth-quake in a quarter of Germanie, where certaine townes and villages were swallowed vp with a great number of folkes: and he sayth that this earth-quake lasted 15. daies. Asmuch happened two moueths before to Cattaro a towne of Sclauonia, belonging to the Venetians, wherein perished a great multitude of people, swallowed vp by an ouerture of the earth. The yeare 1570. the Citty of Ferrara was shaken by an earthquake for the space of many daies togither, with the ruine of diuers faire places &amp; other goodly buildings. The wars, plagues, famines, inundations of seas and riuers, happening after such signes from heauē, are noted in the histories of our time: as wee also purpose to present the histories of them in their fit place. On Sūday the first day of March 1584. in the Countries of Lyonnois, Masconnois Dauphine, Sauoy, Piemont, Valais, Suisserland &amp; Bourgondy, betweene a 11. &amp; 12. a clock at noone, the skie cleare &amp; bright and the Sun shyning, happened a suddaine earthquake, which lasted not aboue ten or eleuen minutes at that time. It was chiefly perceiued by the crackling of

windowes, clapping of dores, shaking of houses, beames, and trees togither, with a great noise and roaring in the aire. Many chimneis fell downe, diuers walles crackt in sunder, and the foundations of certaine houses shooke, namely about the lake of Lausanne, especially in the Countries of Vaut, Fossigny, Chablais &amp; places adioyning. Three or foure chimneis, and the wall of an old house fel down at Geneua, without any other harme. The next day, this earth-quake redoubled about the vpper end of the Lake of Lausanne, and on Tuesday both in the morning and at night it waxed greater with winde and sleete, but on Wedensday betweene 9. and 10. of the clock in the morning this which followeth happened in a certaine place of the Coūtry being some two houres iourney frō this vpper end of the Lake, and foure Harguebuze shot or there about from the towne of Aille, appertayning to the Canton of Berne. A great quantity of earth tumbling from the top of the mountaines (like an impetuous floud of waters rushing downe the rocks) lanched it selfe forth, as some haue affirmed, the length of a mile, not so much by it owne naturall motion, which tended downe-ward, as pushed forward by winds and exhalations mingled among. This earth ran so violently along, that in an instant it couered the places which were next belowe it, vpon the which it disgorged it selfe, and carried all the ground that it met withall before it: which rouled along as furiously as the first: &amp; it was like to a rough sea, where one waue driues on another. The plaines were not only carried away, but the hills that ouerlooked the bottoms were likewise remooued. Now it is to be noted that the place of this first motion of the earth was at the mouth of a straite caused by diuers hillocks which are cōmonly soūd

in the nookes of mountaines. At the mouth and issue of this straite was Corberi a small village or hamlet of some 8. houses, and 10. or 11. granges with certaine mills, that were driuen by the water of a little brooke. The earth rushed so furiously on this village, that suddainly it was al couered ouer, except one house, where it chanced that the good-man astonished with the noise hee heard, told his wife that he was perswaded the end of the world was come, &amp; therefore willed her ioyne with him in praier vnto GOD, that it might please him to haue mercy on them. Whervpon falling on their knees in their house they reaped such fruite of their praiers, that the earth which rouled along, past like a raging waue ouer their house without any hurt, saue the good-man himself, that was a little hurt in the head. As for the other houses &amp; granges they were all cast downe, and almost quite couered ouer. Another notable thing happened in this very place, namely a Child of 12. or 13. weekes old was found safe &amp; sound in his Cradle, hauing his poore mother dead by him, who laying her armes ouer the Cradle for to saue her Child had her braines beaten out with the fal of the house. The like befell a little girle of a yeare old found safe and well vnder the ruines of another house. As for the milles they were broken all to peeces. A meruailous matter happened in one of thē. For standing in a lowe place the beame of the wheele, and the wheele it selfe were found whole and entier on the top of a little hill 500. paces higher then the scituation of the Mill. Moreouer the further this deluge of earth ran downe-ward, the more the desolation augmented. For shooting it selfe against the village of Yuorne, which lay vnderneath Corberi, it buried an hundreth persons aliue (some say more) two hundreth &amp; 40.

milch-kine, and a number of Horse and Oxen. It couered three score &amp; nine houses, an hundeth &amp; six granges, and 4. vaults, with a great quantity of corne, wine, moueables &amp; pasture. For in truth this village was meruaylous well fitted with all things, and accounted one of the best of al the Country of the Cantons. The scituation of it was on the side of a hill lying East and West, in so fertile a place, that they had continually 3. crops in a yeare of one peece of groūd. There was not any poore or beggar amongst them, but euery one euen to the meanest liued honestly by that that he had and his owne labor, beeing simple people, industrious, and estranged from the euill practises of vsury &amp; strifes in Law, according to the testimony of al their neighbors. It is reported the ruine was so suddaine, that no Canon can sooner discharge a shot, thē al this was executed. Diuers haue testified that a farre off they sawe some 20. persons the most parte women and Children, that running downe the hill for to saue themselues, were in a moment ouertaken, beaten downe, and couered ouer with earth. There were some among them, but the greater part women and children: because the men were most of them at worke in the field. Amidst this visitation, GOD vsed such mercy that there was not any house wherin remained not some one man or child aliue. Besides the terrible noise which the earth made, rouling along with a mixture of haile &amp; stones flying in the aire, a great sort of sparks of fire were seene, &amp; a grosse thick Cloude, whence issued an exceeding filthy smell of sulphure. At last this inundation of earth stayed it selfe against 2. houses that ioyned togither, which were couered vp halfe way the walles, without any further harme, besides the which there remaines 7. or 8. other houses

with as many Granges, and a few barnes. Extractedout of the Annotations and Obseruations vpon I. du CHESNES great Mirror of the world.
            
            On the fift day of September beeing Saterday 1590. according to the ancient computation, and an houre before Sunne set, the earth began to shake in Austria, Morauia, Bohemia, Misnia, Silesia and Lusatia. But a little after, to witte, betweene twelue and one of the clock at midnight, this Earth-quake began againe thorow all the Prouinces aforesaid, with a meruailous shaking, and most of all in Vienna, the capitall Cittie of the Archdutchy of Austria: where the toppe of the great steeple of Saint Stephens Church, was so shaken that a number of mighty huge stones fell downe from it vpon the roofe of the Church: and the whole frame of the said steeple was moued with such vehemencie, that they were faine to new repaire it. Another steeple by it, wherein hangs one of the greatest Bels in Europe, was like-wise shaken. Not farre from the Scottish gate, the Steeple of a Church was ouer-throwne, and the Church it selfe was so cleft in sunder, that they were forced to take it downe. It happened at the same time, that a certaine Butcher, which vsed to lye a nights in his stall fast by that Scottish gate, vpon a suddaine felt his stall beaten downe with the stones that tumbled on it in very great aboundance, without receiuing any hurt, or so much as once touched with those stones in any part of his body. Contrarilye the Sunne an Inne in the Citty, was dashed all to peeces with the fall of a steeple that stood by it. And diuers persons were brained, namely the Mistresse of the house, her Daughter and Mother, two rich Merchants, that had fiue thousand Crownes in gold found about them, the Poste

of Lintz and three other men: whose bodies at length were drawne forth from vnder the ruines. Besides this Saint Michels steeple, a Church of the Iesuits, and the pinacles of Saint Laurence and Saint Iohns Churches fell downe. There was neither building, bulwarke, Church nor house within the walles of Vienna which was not shaken, crakt, broken, or in some sort damnified by this earth-quake. All the inhabitants got them out of the Citty with all speede, and went into gardens and other voyde open places.
            In a village not farre from Vienna, called Hernalsi, the Church and diuers houses fell downe. Asmuch happened in the towne of Oula, another village named Siegeitzkirchen had the Church, the parsonage house, and the walles of the Church-yard ouerthowen: Pixendorf, another village was quite and cleane cast downe. In like manner Pfasfensted, &amp; the Castle of Iudenow, newe builded from the ground but three yeares before: and another called Sitzberg were so shaken, that no body durst dwell in them a long time after. In other places diuers persons were hurt and killed with the ruines of houses. Two miles from Vienna, a Mill that stood on the water, was hoisted vp and throwne a good way of vpon the dry Land: and a great sorte of fish were cast vp on the banks of the same riuer. A little beneath Vienna, the ground opened, whence issued such a stinking pestilent vapor, that the inhabitants about it were not able to endure it. The ouerture was foure foote broade, very long, and so deepe that it could not bee sounded. In Morauia, Bohemia, and other Countries adioyning this earth-quake continued many daies, but not altogither so violent. I. HEDERY, in his oration of the earth-quake in Austria.
            
            
               It is obserued that this terrible earth-quake, which killed well neere all the garrison in the Castle of Canisium in Hungary, fell vpon the verie same day that Pope VREAN the seauenth was elected, who held the Romaine Sea but ten dayes.

A Portugall Ladie, being imbarked in the yeare 1520. with two of her Brethren, called IOHN and ARIAS COCILLO, and a fisherman, named ANTHONY GRIMALDI, conducted in a Caruel by certaine marriners, being at sea they were set vpon by a fregat of Pirats, eight whereof (hauing grappeled with the Caruell) leaped into them. But IOHN, ARIAS and ANTHONY, runne and defend themselues in such sort, as they kill foure of the Assaylants, and force the rest to retire with more speede then they had entred. In the meane time the Marriners goe on their course, and leaue the fregate farre behinde them. The Pirats vnderstanding by them that were escaped, that there were but three Combatants in the Caruell, and that the rest were but women and Marryners, they beganne to rowe vp withall their force and graple againe with the Caruell, then sixeteene of them well armed

leape in by the prowe: the two Brethren make head against them with great resolution. ANTHONY ioynes with them, hauing no other armes, but a hatchet in his right hand, and a Marriners wasecoate about his left arme. The incounter was very sharpe, and had beene greater if their number had beene equall. In the end the Pirats hauing lost most of their men retire with the remainder into their frigate. Whilest they were thus in fight, some of the Pirats leaped in by the Poupe: but they were repulsed by the Marriners. ANTHONY ranne vnto the hatch of the Caruell, and tooke the coales and cenders which hee found there, and cast them into the F

            MANVEL PACHE CO, a Portugall Captaine, being sent by the Gouernor of Malaca to the East Indies, to annoye them of Pacem, who had slaine 25. Portugals, freede himselfe carefully of that charge. And being desirous to drinke some fresh water, he sent IOHN ALMEIDE, ANTHONY PAZEGNE, ANTHONY DEVERE, and FRANCIS GAMAXE resolute soldiers in a skiffe, to land neere vnto Pacean, to dig for fresh water. These soldiars being followed by a Portugall Surgion, a valient man entred into the riuer with their Marriners and watered. But as they returned towards their shippe, behold the enemies came swarming downe on either banke, who with a shower of stones and arrowes thought to beate downe the soldiars and to sinke the boate. But the soldiars couered themselues so well with their Targetts, and the Marriners did their duties so

well in rowing, as they got out of the riuer into the open Sea. But for that the flud cast them backe hauing no winde, three great vessells manned with all that was necessary for the warre, and which carried many Gentlemen of the Country, came to inuest them. The Commander called ZVDAMEC, was of IAVA, who approched with a chiefe barke, which carried a hundred and fifty men. As for the Portugalls, they resolued to die, rather then to yeeld to become slaues: and after they had recommended themselues to GOD, they prepared corragiously to the combate. The Barber beganne, and layed hold of the prowe of their chiefe vessell with such force, as his foure Companions had meanes to enter into it, and hee had meanes to leape in after them. Then they fell vpon their enemies with such fury as many of them troubled with feare, cast themselues ouerborde. ZVDAMEC was hehinde his men, whome hee thrust on to the combate, holding his sword in his hand, and threatning to kill him that should recoyle: but seeing that his words preuailed nothing, he slue foure: The rest knewe not which way to turne them: for those that made head against the Portugalls felt the waight of their armes: and those which recoyled could expect nothing but death from their Captaine. Hauing fought sometime they were all

               laine or drowned, being so transported with feare, as they cast themselues head-long into the Sea, namely ZVDAMEC, who after that he had beene wounded in many places, leaped into the waues. The other two vessells, seeing what had happened, durst come no neerer, although the fiue Portugalls were so tired, and wounded in so many places, as they could not stirre arme nor legge. The vessell taken from ZVDAMEC

was drawne neere vnto PACHECOS fleete, and then carried to Malaca, and there layed vp and couered, to serue for a memoriall of that maraculous fight. The King of Pacem amazed at this strange accident, demanded and bought a peace, which was granted him. In the same booke Chap. 4.
            In the same yeare 1520. Captaine VASQVES FERNAND CAESAR, running with a shippe of war along the straight of Gibraltar was inuested by six foysts of Moores. They desired nothing more, then this prey, and thinking it impossible for him to escape them, they beganne to shoute for ioye, then with their Arrowes, Harguebuzes and Muskets, they sought to oppresse him. CAESAR plaied with his Artillery, to keepe them from bording him, auoyding their blowes, with his rowing, and still killing some one of them: by meanes whereof their choller was some-what cooled which hee descouering, he ranne vpon three of these foysts that were togither, the winde hauing driuen away the three others and kept them aloofe. The enemies came also to incounter him wherevpon he set fire to a great peece of Ordynance, so; as the boullet passing from prowe to poupe of one of these three foysts, brake all the owers. The Moores drewe this may med foyst betwixt the two others, and repayred it as well as the time would giue them leaue. Then they ioyne againe and charge CAESAR, who running vp and downe with a braue resolution, and incorraging his soldiars with a loude voice, hee did so batter these foysts with his great shot, as the Assaylants found a harder partie then they expected, final'y a great shot carried away most of the slaues in one of the foysts: so as the Moores hauing lost many soldiars slaine with the Cannon, seeing

two of their foysts broken, and that the taking of CAESAR would cost them deere, they left the fight. This Captaine being alwayes of a valiant spirit, followed the foysts: but for that they went with oares and hee sailed, the winde being scant hee could not ouer-take them: so as hee put into the Port of Malaga, to burye such men as had beene slaine, and to cure the wounded.

            TRISTAN VASQVES de VEGA, a Portugall Captaine, a Debaucht and dissolute man, but so couragious as neuer any danger did amaze him: so as many held him to be madde and desperate: seeing the Cittadell of Ormus in danger to be lost for King EMANVELL, without any more question, he imbarked himselfe in his ship of warre with thirty souldiers onely, and directs his course to Ormus, where he approcheth, and seeing the passage shut vp, hee chargeth through the enemies fleete, and fights so valiantly with their whole power, as in despight of their Canon, Harguebuzes, wilde fire, Darts and Arrowes, after that he had done wondrous actes, surpassing all humaine force, hee past through, and came into the Cittadell. This valiant exploite did greatly amaze the enemies, and filled the besieged with great hope: the Commander of them intreated VEGA to returne and to ioyne with Captaine SOVSA, who had some vessels to indomage this fleete the more easily: where-vnto VEGA yeelded, although hee had a priuate quarrell with SOVSA, and that hee was hurt. Hee therefore with as great hazard as at the first time, forced through the enemies fleete againe, aduertised SOVSA of the estate of the besieged: and when it began to flowe, they two with their Souldiers entred fight with them, the which

continued long, and was very furious. The enemies lost tenne vessels that were sunck, a great number slaine, and many hurt. Of the Portugals there was but one Souldier slaine, and foure score hurte: but maugre all the resistance of the Ormusians. SOVSA and VEGA arriued safe in the Port of the Cittadell.

                an Italian Lord, carrying armes for the King of France at the Battaile of Pauia, in the yeare 1524. did as much as valour could performe, running among the thickest of the enemies, and doing goodly exploits of armes. In the end fighting neere the King, his Horse being slaine vnder him, and hee ouerthrowne, calling vnto the Lord of Langey (who fought neere him, and would haue succoured him) hee sayde vnto him. My Sonne heere it is that I must dye, with my Armes in my hand: trouble your selfe no more for mee, but goe speedily and succour the King our Lord and if you escape remember mee, and that I am dead in the bed of honour.

            In the yeare 1552. SOLIMAN caused MAHVMET BASSA to beseege a strong place in Transiluania called Themesuar, defended by the Earle of Losana for FERDINAND King of Hungary, after-wards Emperor. This Earle seeing a mighty army round about him, debarred of succors, and betrayed by two Spaniards which had abandoned him, to yeeld vnto the Turkes, hee beganne to parle, and obtained a composition to depart with all his soldiars, with their liues and goods. The Bassa against his promised faith, caused all the soldiars to be slaine, &amp; cutts off the Earles head. A Spanish Knight called ALPHONSO PEREZ de SAIAVEDRE, making way with his sword, and

ouerthrowing them that would haue stayed him, hee sought to saue him-selfe through the swiftnesse of his horse in the neerest place of retreate, being pursued by fiue hundred Turkish horse-men, which could not ouertake him. Being almost out of danger, hee fell into a Quagmire, where both hee and his horse perished. The Turkes seeing him downe, pursue, and cut off the head of this valiant man, the which beeing carried to Mahumet, and hearing that it was a Spaniard: I beleeue it sayd hee, for hee was valiant.

            When as the Turkes besieged Belgrade in Hungary, one of their soldiers desirous to plant his ensigne in an eminent place, went vp into an high Tower. Hee was presently followed by a Hungarian or a Bohemian, who seeing that he could hardly dislodge him from thence, layes fast hold of him, and then casts himselfe with him from the top of the Tower, where both were slaine with the fall. BONFIN, lib. 8. Decad. 3. DVBRAVIVS, lib. 29. saith, that the Christian cryed out alowde to the Popes Legate, looking downe from the Towre: If I cast my selfe head-long with this Dog Turke, whether shall my soule goe? And that the Legate hauing assured him that it should bee carried presently into Paradise, he cast himselfe downe with the Turke: and was the cause that the place did yet hold good. An other Hungarian did the like at the siege of Iayza, BONFIN, lib. 10. Decad. 3.
            They say that when as the Spaniards surprized Constance, a frontier Towne of the Suisses, in the yeare 1548. one of the Inhabitants, seeing one of the Commanders aduance, and incourage the other Spaniards to pursue their point, and that the Towne was like to bee

lost; he sodenly went towards him, imbraced him, and cast him-selfe with him of the bridge into the Riuer, where both were drowned. Memorials of our time.

            In the yeare 1501. the King of Fez being in field with mighty troupes to assayle Tingi a strong Towne vpon the coast of Barbarie, held by the Portugalls, the Gouernor made a sallie vpon the Moores: but finding them too strong, hee retired with great difficultie, into the towne ditches. The fight had continued two houres before hee could get thether, in the which the Gouernors sonne was slaine, and eight valiant Horse-men: the Gouernor himselfe beeing sore hurt in the face with a Iauelyn. The Moores followe their point presse the Portugalls, and doe all they can to enter pel-mel with them into the Towne. The which the Gouernor seeing, hee careth the Moores so furiously with a troupe of Horse, as in the meane-time the rest retire easily into the Towne. The last was called LOVP MARTIN, a valiant man who beeing entred, did shutte the gate but halfe and when as many cried vnto him that hee should shutte and make fast the gate; I will neuer doe that

dishonor sayd hee, vnto the Portugalls in making the world to thinke that they are afraied. Adding that hee was readie to fight vnto the last gaspe, to keepe anie from entring by that halfe gate.

            The extraordinary valour of a Suisse in the time of our Ancestors, shalbe heere-vnto added, with the leaue of the courteous reader, as most worthie to bee often remembred. The Suisses to the number of a 1800. or there-bouts (hauing broken the great and mightie forces brought by the Daulphin of France neere vnto Basil) were all slaine vpon the place, fighting with a wonderfull great force and valiant resolution, for the helth of their owne Country. It happened after the Battaile that a Monke a Suisse, called BVRCARD: who had made a voyage into France with the Emperours consent, to bring in this armie, going forth on Horse-backe, as it were to triumph for this defeate of his Countriemen, and marching with his Caske on, but his beuer was vp, and his face was vncouered, that hee might with more ease behold the dead bodies, among the which he marched, he began to cry out, O pleasant spectacle, what a goodly thing it is to marche in this medow bedeckt with Roses: at those words a Suisse lying vpon the place, and breathing more for the libertie of his country, then for his owne life, being so neere his death, hee awakes, and rising as well as hee could vpon his

knees, with an extraordinary vigour, and taking vp a stone, hee threwe it with such dexterity and force at BVRCARD as hee hit him in the midest of the fore-head, and ouerthrewe him from his horse, where hee died, receiuing the reward of his cruell ingratitude and treason. STVMPHIVS in the History of Suisserland.
            
            In the yeare 1514. the Suisses going to succor MAXIMILIAN SFORZA Duke of Milan, had the gard of Nouare, the which they defended with such resolution, as notwithstanding that the French made a furious battery against the walles, yet the Suisses shewed to haue so little feare of them, as they would neuer suffer the Towne gate, which lookt into the campe to be shut. A breach being made, they endured an assault courragiously, and repulst the Assaylants. And which is more, the night following, beeing led by Captaine MOTIN, they went (without attending the succors that came vnto them) to charge the French armie, marching directly to the Artillery, the which they wonne valiantly, beeing two and twentie peeces, and carryed them the next daie in tryumph to Nouare, hauing slaine a great part of the French armie, and put the rest in rout: the which we will describe more amply in the following discourse, where wee will write of great battailes giuen in diuers partes of the worlde, since a hundred and fiftie yeares. FR. GVICHARDIN Booke 2. Chap. 14. of his Historie of the warres of Italie.
            
            The valour of the same Suisses appeered in the yeare. 1515. at Saint Dona in the Duchie of Milan, of whome GVICHARDIN yeeldes this testymonie. Although the Suisses did fight still with great courrage and resolution, yet seeing them-selues charged in front and in flanke, and

that the Venetian armie approched to assault them behinde, they despayred of victory (which they held for certaine the daie before) so as it growing late, they did sound a retreate, and taking their Artillery, vpon their shoulders, they turned their squadrons, and holding still their accustomed discipline, they marched softly towards Milan, with such amazement to the French, as not any one of foote or horse-backe durst followe them. There were onelie two Companies of theirs, which being fled into a farme house, were burnt by the Venetian light horse men. The rest of the armie returned to Milan without disorder, shewing the same countenance and resolution: and some say they buried in the ground fiueteene peeces of great ordinance, which they had gotten at the first Incounter, for that they had no meanes to carrie them away. All men say, that for a long time there had not beene seene a more furious and fearefull battaile in Italie. TRIVVLCE (an ancient Captaine which had seene much) sayd, that this battaile had beene performed by Giants, not by men: and that eighteene battailes in which hee had beene, were but combats of little children in respect of that: and some hold that without the Canon the Suisses had gotten the victory, who being entred at the first charge into the fortifications of the French, and hauing taken from them the most of their peeces, had alwaies wonne ground.

            About the yeare 1514. the French being beseeged in a fort called the lanterne of Genoa, beseeched King LEVVIS the twelfth to succor them with vittells. A Sclauonian Captaine entertained by the King, carried him-selfe so well, as in despight of all the Galleis which stopt the

As for the Selauonian Captaine, he cast himselfe into the sea, meaning to swimme vnto the shelfes neere vnto the fort, where hee pretended to saue himselfe. But a young gentleman called IVSTINIAN, casting himselfe into the sea, followed him so swiftly as he ouertooke him, and laying hold of his haire, drewe him to the shore.

                  lls with his Court and walking one night after supper throgh the streets, accompanied with some of his fauorits▪ he found lying vpon the stones a certaine Artisan that was very dronke, and that slept soundly. It pleased the Prince in this Artisan to make triall of the vanity of our life, wherof he had before discoursed with his familiar friends. Hee therfore caused this sleeper to be taken vp and carried into his Pallace: hee commands him to bee layed in one

of the richest beds, a riche Night-cap to bee giuen him, his foule shirt to bee taken off, and to haue an other put on him of fine Holland: when as this Dronkard had disgested his Wine, and began to awake: behold there comes about his bed, Pages and Groomes of the Dukes Chamber, who drawe the Curteines, make many courtesies, and being bare-headed, aske him if it please him to rise, and what apparell it would please him to put on that day. They bring him rich apparrell. This new Monsieur amazed at such curtesie, and doubting whether hee dreampt or waked, suffered himselfe to be drest, and led out of the Chamber. There came Noble-men which saluted him with all honour, and conduct him to the Masse, where with great ceremonie they giue him the Booke of the Gospell, and the Pixe to kisse, as they did vsually vnto the Duke▪ from the Masse they bring him backe vnto the Pallace: hee washes his hands, and sittes downe at the Table well furnished. After dinner, the great Chamberlaine commandes Cardes, to be brought with a great summe of money. This Duke in Imagination playes with the chiefe of the Court. Then they carrie him to walke in the Gardein, and to hunt the Hare and to Hawke. They bring him back vnto the Pallace, where hee sups in state. Candles beeing light, the Musitions begin to play, and the Tables taken away, the Gentlemen and Gentle-women fell to dancing, then they played a pleasant Comedie, after which followed a Banket, whereas they had presently store of Ipocras and pretious Wine, with all sorts of confitures, to this Prince of the new Impression, so as he was drunke, &amp; fell soundlie a sleepe. Here-vpon the Duke commanded that hee should bee disrobed of all his riche attire. Hee was put

into his olde ragges and carried into the same place, where he had beene found, the night before, where hee spent that night. Being awake in the morning, hee beganne to remember what had happened before, hee knewe not whether it were true in deede, or a dreame that had troubled his braine. But in the end, after many discourses, hee concluds that all was but a dreame that had happened vnto him, and so entertained his wife, his Children and his neighbors, without any other apprehension. This Historie put mee in minde of that which SENECA sayth in the ende of his 59. letter to LVCILIVS. No man saies he, can reioyce and content himselfe, if he be not nobly minded, iust and temperate. What then? Are the wicked depriued of all ioye? they are glad as the Lions that haue found their prey. Being full of wine and Luxury, hauing spent the night in gourmandise, when as pleasures poored into this vessell of the bodie (beeing to little to conteine so much) beganne to foame out, these miserable wretches crie with him of whome VIRGILL speakes.

Then one of them beganne to say merrely, I would I had as many Oxen as I see starres. The other answered after the same manner, and I would haue a Medowe as bigge as all the compasse of Heauen, then turning to his Brother he added, where would you then feede your Oxen? In your Medowe replied the Brother: yea if I would answered the other. I, in despight of you sayd he of the Oxen. In spight of mee sayd the other. I replied his Brother. So contesting togither, their I est fell to earnest, and from bitter wordes they fel to blowes, and drawing their swords, they thrust one an▪other through, and fell downe in the place.

Cardynall, called IOHN, a Prince of great hope. Going one daie a hunting with two other of his Bretheren. FERDINAND and GARTIA, beeing followed by some gentlemen, their dogges start a Hare, the which they hunt in a Champian field and take. Herevpon the Brothers fell to some debate, euery one maintayning that his Dogges had first found the Hare and then taken it. From wordes they fell to iniurious tearmes. The Cardynall not able to endure anie worde of disgrace gaue GARCIA a blowe of the eare: who transported with choller, drewe his sworde, and wounded the Cardynall so sore, as hee died soone after.

            Some turbulent Spirits, vnworthy to be named, bread a quarrell betwixt GEORG and ALBERT Marquises of Brandeberg, the which they did entertaine so cunningly, as these two Princes, Cousin-germains, became open enemies one vnto an other, and diuided their estates, which before they had held in common, making authenticall contracts. GEORGE, the more ancient, hauing of long time obserued, that ALBERT suffred himselfe to be gouerned by men that in the end would thrust him into great troubles, tooke a resolution such as choller did sugiest, for hearing that ALBERT was come to Neubourg, without imparting it to anie one, hee writ vnto him with his owne hand; that seeing ALBERT did both say and doe him manie indignities hee would not therefore make warre against him, nor suffer

that their poore innocent subiects who were not acquainted with such quarrells, should smart for it. That they must ende this quarrell betwixt themselues. And therefore although hee were much elder, he presented the Combate to Marquis Albert, wishing him (if hee loued his honor) to come alone on horse-backe armed like a Prince and Knight, in a certaine place out of the way, the which hee appointed neere vnto a forest, whether he would come in the like equipage. There they two without any witnesses, would ende all their controuersies. That with his white beard hee would incounter the red haire of ALBERT. He seales vp his letters, calles a Page of his, a Polonian borne, commands him expresly to carrie them to Marquis ALBERT, and not to deliuer them to any other then to him-selfe. The Page desirous to execute his Princes commande, prouides for his departure. But as hee would haue gone to horse-backe, an other page playing with him, and handling his Pistoll, shot it of vnaduisedly, and slue the Polonian Page. He was sercht, and the letters which hee had about him carried backe, by the which the Princes intention was descouered to his Councellers: they let him vnderstand what had happened, and the stay which it seemed GOD had sent. Wherevpon he changed his opynion, and followed other expedients, pardoning the ill aduised Page, who had killed the other vnawares. This happened in the yeare 1541. CAMERARIVS.

            It is wonderfull what ERASMVS reports in a certaine Oration of his, made in the praise of Phisicke. Hee saith, that hee had seene an Italian, who had neuer beene in Germanie, nor seene any Booke or man of that Nation, or any one that vnderstood it, and yet hee spake the Germaine tongue well, so as they thought hee had a spirit. Hauing beene Phisicked by a learned Phisition, and by the meanes of a drinke discharged of a great number of Wormes, hee was cured of his infirmitie, but hee neyther spake nor vnderstood any more the Germaine tongue.

In the ende the 19 of September 1579. a Worme being a foote and a halfe long, came forth at her Nauill. Two dayes after shee cast forth another that was greater. Her Feuer encreased the first of October: so as I feared shee would bee deliuered before her time. The third of the same moneth came forth a third Worme by the Nauill, the which was lesse then the former.

In the territorie of Sienna, a certaine woman hauing drunke the water of the Bathes that are there, and continued it seauen dayes, voyded Wormes of that length. They were so tyed one to an other, as they were foure Cubits long, and seeing them a farre off, you would haue sayd it had beene but one Worme. BENIVENIVS, Chap. 87. I did cure an honest man, who did drawe out by the siege a Worme almost three yeards long: and after-wards although he seemed to be some-what better, yet hee was full of Wormes, which some-times procured him a wonderfull appetite to eate, and other-whiles againe, it gaue mee a wonderfull distaste. DODONEVS in his Annotations vpon the 87. Chapt. I haue seene such large Wormes, and almost of an incredible length, at Mirandola, to the amazement of all those that were with mee. MAINARD in the Epistle of the third Booke. An other Physition, famous among the Germaines, called IAMES CORNARIVS, saith, that hee had driuen out of a certaine mans body dwelling at Northuse, a worme that was very broad, like vnto those which the Greekes call Taeniae, for that they are long and large like vnto bandes, the which was ten Cubites long, and hee thinkes that it was but halfe a

worme, the other halfe hauing beene pulled from him before.
            A young child, two yeares and foure moneths old, at Recine in Italy, in the yeare 1538. voyded one of these broad Wormes whole, of a prodigious length, to the sight where-of almost all the Towne came running: for this Worme being many ells long, was preserued aliue almost a day in a Basin full of water, where it did mooue like a Worme creeping vpon the earth.

We might produce a dozen Histories of such other Wormes, which were at the least an ell long: but for that a great number of other remaine to be obserued, I will busie my selfe about the principall. A Suisses wife of the Canton of zurich, young and fertill, was sick three yeares together, by reason of one of these large and long wormes that was growne within her Bowels, shee sent me a peece to zurich, that I might see it, deliuer my opinion, and ease her. This peece was aboue fiue ells long, without tayle or head, couered with scales like a Serpent, broad as ones little finger, and of the coulour of Ashes. In the yeare 1571. when she dyed, shee cast vp an other of an incredible length: for it was aboue twenty ells, the which her seruants had dryed in the smoake, to preserue it. During her infirmity, this Woman was conceiued and deliuered twise of Childe. Being fasting, these Wormes did gnawe her cruelly: and when shee had eaten and drunke, shee had some ease.

It stirred yet, and beeing stretcht out in my presence, it was found to bee three ells long, with scales of an Ashie coulour like a Serpent. A Kins-woman of mine two and twentie yeares old, tormented with such Wormes, fell to haue an insatiable hunger, and a stopping of her monthly courses. In the end, Nature helping her, shee drew forth with her hands by the lower parts, peece after peece, a Worme many ells long: and then shee was soone cured. I.

            In the yeare 1561. the sixteenth of February, a Vinetrimmer of Arles, did voide such a large and long worme by peeces, whereof the one was twentye hand bredths long, and another eight. It was like vnto thinne skins, wrinckled, of the coulour of Ashes and soft. After that the Patient had beene discharged of such filthe, he sounded, and remained with-out strength or pulce, but in the end hee was recouered. VALERIOLA lib. 1. Obseru. 9.

            I haue made mention else-where, of a young Prince, after his death, being opened, there was found a white Worme, fastened vnto the heart, which had the beake pointed and hard like vnto that of a Chicken. Others in their Annotations vppon Mounsieur HOVLIENS worke of inward diseases, obserue vpon the 29. Chapter of the 1. Booke, that some times it happens, that wormes tickling not onely the orifice of the stomack, but also the heart it selfe, death doth presently ensue. I haue also spoken of a Florentine, who beeing dead of an Apoplexie, was opened, where there was a Worme found in the filme of the heart. RONDELET speaking of the Riuer Creuisse, in his History of Fishes, saieth, That hee had seene a Worme breeding in one of the brests of an Honorable Gentlewoman. BALDVVIN ROVSETVS a Phisition of Holland, in the 10. Chapter of his Miscellania, reportes the like of another Woman. H. MONTVVS a learned Physition, doth maintaine,

hath told me, that practising in the Franche Countie, hee had a Maide in cure, which had a crooke back, who feeling a great itching on that part, hee thought it was some Impostume, applying things fit to make it ripe. Being opened, there came out of it matter as cleere as water, with a great aboundance of Lice. The same. I haue seene an Impostume in a Maidens flanke, the which beeing opened by the Surgion, it was found full of Wormes. FALLOPIVS in the 4. Chap. of swellings that be not Naturall. Visiting the body of a Souldiar of Modena, that was dead in the Hospitall of the Carmelites, I found it full of Impostumes both within and without, all which were full of Wormes like vnto Lice. The same. A Germaine Gentlewoman troubled with diuerse diseases, among others did vomit vp at diuerse times, aboue twelue hundred little wormes, not aboue six yeares since, some as long as a Mans finger, others longer: whereof we will speake more amply in another place. I. SCHENCK recites this History, in the last Section of the seuenth Booke of his Obseruations.
            
            It remaines to speake a worde of such Vermine as comes forth from betwixt the skinne and the fl
                  •…
               sh, a disease called Ptiriasis. Many both great and small, ancient and moderne, haue beene strucken with it, and carried out of the world. In some they haue onely obserued some naturall indisposition, whereof the Phisitions yeeld pertinent reasons: in others, some speciall visitation of GOD. I haue before made mention of some whervnto I will adde this that followeth. AMATVS a Portugall, in the 3. Century, cure. 58. saith, that he had cured one that had Ptiriasis ot the Lousie disease, with an Ointment, letting him bloud, and purging him well before.

Hee writes also, that a Portugall of Lisbone called TABORA, was so tormented with such Vermine, as two slaues of his being Moores, did nothing but carry away Baskets full of this Vermine breeding in his bodie, and emptied them in the Sea, which was neere vnto the sicke mans lodging. A young Painter being troubled with an itching, was aduised to stand naked neere vnto the fire, which caused Blisters to rise on his back, out of the which there came aboundance of Lyce. P. FOREST lib. 8. Obseru. 15.
            As for those wretches whome the hand of GOD hath toucht in all ages, and which haue beene deuoured aliue with Lice. I will leaue the search and consideration there-of vnto the Reader. I could name some aduanced to great dignities according to the worlde, and riche, who within these fiue and twenty yeares, namelye in our France, for that they were not punished by men according to their merites, haue not yet escaped the iust vengeance of the Almightie. Some haue dyed with-out sence, others haue felt some Worme in their conscience, but destitute of the true knowledge of GOD, and of them-selues, haue dyed most miserably. There is no Prouince in the realme, but may furnish store of examples. Such punishments doe put both great and small in minde of these two verses.

               CAptaine LAVDONNIERE chiefe of three Ships well appointed, sayled in the yeare 1564. towards Florida, where being arriued, the Seignior of Ottigny his Lieutenant was lead by a Paraousty or Lord of the Country, to his Fathers lodging, one of the oldest men that was then liuing vpon the earth. The French-men respecting the age of this Floridien, began to gratifie him by the common terme of friend, whereat the olde man did seeme to reioyce much. Then they asked him of the course of his age: where-vnto hee made answer, shewing that from him were come fiue generations. More-ouer hee shewed them an other olde man set right against him, the which did exceed him much in age. It was his Father, who did more resemble a carcase of boanes, then a liuing man: for he had the sinewes, the veines, the artiers, the boanes, and other parts appearing so plainly aboue the skinne, as you might number and distinguish one from an other. And hee was so old, as the poore man had lost his sight, and could speake little and with very great paine. The Seignior of Ottigny hauing seene so strange a thing, went to the young olde man, intreated him to answer vnto that which hee had demanded touching his age. Then the old Man called a troupe of Indiens: and striking twise vppon his thigh, and laying his hand vpon two of them, hee gaue him to vnderstand by signes and tokens, that these two were his Children: then striking vppon his thighes, hee shewed him others that were not so olde, which issued from the two first,

the which he continued in that manner vnto the fifte generation. Although this olde man had a Father, and that both had white and exceeding long haire, yet it seemed by their naturall constitution they might liue thirtie or fortie yeares longer: and yet the youngest of them was not lesse then two hundred and fiftie yeares olde.

               VELASQVES of Tarentum makes mentiion in his Filone of an Abbesse that was in the Monastery of Monuiedre, the which in his time was almost a hundred yeares old, and as she seemed very old, nature which declined in her recouered so great force and vertue, as her monthly courses which she had lost for manie yeares, beganne to come againe as if shee had beene yong: moreouer all her teeth came againe, her haire began to shew black, and to expell the white, so as recouering her best estate, the wrinkles of her face ware away, her brests grewe fat &amp; plompe, &amp; in the end she grewe as faire and fresh as when she was but thirty years old: so as many went to see her, as the most admirable thing which they had euer seene. She hid her selfe and would not bee seene, beeing ashamed of this strange alteration, which she found in her selfe. And although that VELASQVES did forget to note the number of yeares which shee liued afterwardes, yet it is to bee presumed that they were reasonably long: seeing that nature in the declyning, had shewed so goodly and

extraordinary a worke. A. TORQVEMADO in the first iorney of his discourse.
            
            Beeing at Rome about the yeare 1531. it was bruted throughout all Italie, that at Tarentum there liued an old man who at the age of a hundred yeares was growne young againe, like vnto the Abbesse. Hee had changed his skinne like vnto the snake, and had recouered a newe, beeing growne so young and fresh, as those which had seene him and knowne him beefore, could then scarse beleeue their owne eyes. Hauing continued aboue fiftie yeares in this estate, hee grewe to bee so olde, as hee seemed to bee made of barkes of trees. The same.
            
            The Admirall Don FADRIGVE, passing in his youth by a place called Rioya, hee see a man that was fiftie yeares olde in his opynion, who tould him that hee had beene foote-man to his grand-father. And when as the Admirall would not beleeue it, for that it was long since his grand-father was dead: this man sayd vnto him that hee had no reason to doubt thereof, for that hee was a hundred yeares olde: and that being old hee was growne young againe: so as nature was changed in him and had renewed all that which was the cause of age, the which made him to seeme younger then hee was. The Admirall was desirous to knowe the truth, and found that the was as it old man had sayd. The same Author.
            
            That aboue written is not impossible (addes TORQVEMADO) seeing that in our time wee knowe a verie admirable thing of a man mentioned by FERNAND LOPES of Castagneda, Historiographer to the King of Portugall, in the eight booke of his Chronicle where he sayth that NONNIO de CVGNE being Viceroye at the Indies in the yeare 1536. there was a man brought vnto him

as a thing worthie of admiration: for that it was auerred by great proofes and sufficient testimony, that hee was three hundred and fortie yeares old. Hee remembred that hee had seene that Cittie wherein he dwelt vnpeopled being then when he spake one of the chiefe of all the East-Indies. Hee had growne young againe fouretimes, leauing his white haire and hauing newe teeth. When the Viceroy did see him, hee had his haire and his beard black, although hee had not much. And as by chance there was a Physition present, the Viceroy would haue him feele this olde mans pulce, the which he found as good and as strong, as a young mans in the prime of his age. This man was borne in the Realme of Bengala, and did affirme that hee had at times neere seauen hundred wi
                  •…
               es, whereof some were dead and some hee had put away. The King of Portugall aduertised of this wonder, did often inquier, and had yeerely newes by the fleete which came. Hee liued aboue three hundred and seauentie yeares. The same Castagnede addes, that in the time of the same Viceroy, there was also found in the Cittie of Bengala an other man, a Moore or MAHVMETAN called. XEQVEPIR, borne in a Prouince named XEQVE, who was three hundred yeares olde as hee sayd: all those which did knowe him did also certefie it, for that they had great presumptions and testimonies. This Moore was reputed amongst them for a holie man, by reason of his austernes and abstinence. The Portugals did conuerse famyliarly with him▪ and besides that the Histories of Portugall are faithfully collected and certefied by verie autenticall witnesses: there were in my time both in Portugall and in Castille many witnesses which had seene these old men. The same.
            
            
               ALEX. BENEDICTVS reports in his practise that hee had seene a woman called VICTORIA, who had lost all her teeth, and beeing growne bald other teeth came againe at the age of eighteene yeares. AMB. PARE Booke 24. Chap. 17.
            I haue heard Mistris DESBECK saie, that shee had knowne a woman seauentie yeares olde, the which in certaine monethes for some yeares, had her monethly courses verie orderly. In the ende comming downe into great abondance, shee died. Shee reported vnto mee an other memorable Historie, that shee had seene and knowne an honorable woman, being then a hundred and three yeares olde, and soone after died: who beeing a hundred and one had her monthly courses very orderly, where-with shee felt her selfe wonderfully eased, and as it were restored: the which continued from the hundred and one yeare vntill her death, which was at the age of a hundred and three. The Marshalls wife of Pleatenbourck a gentlewoman of the noble famelie of Ketlercks in Wesphalia, hauing past seauentie yeares returned to haue her monthly purgations very orderly, and was as lustie as shee had beene long before. These orderly courses continued foure yeares, but in the ende they came in greater abundance then before: and yet shee was helthfull vntill the age of eightie foure. Shee liued yet sixe yeares, and died in the ninetie yeare of her age. R. SOLENANDER. Booke 5. of his Physicall Obseruations. Cons. 15. sect. 41. 42. 43.
         
         
            
            Strange, Fearefull, and horrible Visions.
            
               IN the liues of DION and BRVTVS in PLVTARKE, wee read of horrible apparitions which appeared vnto them a little before their deaths: and wee read in the Histories of Scotland, in the life of King ALEXANDER the third, a strange cause of a fantosme which appeared vnto him the day of his third marriage, presaging his death the same yeare. But omitting ancient Histories, besides those that wee haue represented in the first Booke, wee will adde some in this.
            There is a Noble and ancient familie at Parma, called TORTELLES, hauing a Castell, in the which there is a great Hall, vnder the Chimney wher-of there doth sometimes appeare an ancient Woman, seeming to be a 100. yeares old. This signifieth that some one of the familie shall dye soone after. I haue heard PAVLA BARBIANO a worthy Lady of that family report (supping one night together at Belioyeuse) that a young Maide of that house being sick, the old Woman appeared, which made all to thinke that the Maide should soone dye: but the contrarie happened: for the sicke Maide escaped, but an other of the same family which before was in very good health dyed sodenly. They say this old woman whose shadow appeares, was some-times a riche Lady, who for her money was slaine by her Nephews, which cutte her body in peeces, and cast it into the Priuies.

                (of whose despaier I haue spoken else-where) the lastnight of his life, being layed, he imagined to see, a very tall man, whose head was shauen, his beard hanging downe to the earth, his eyes sparkling, and two torches in his hands, whome ANTHONY demanded what art thou, who alone like a furie doest walke thus out of season when euery one doth rest? Tell mee, what seekest thou? What doest thou pretend? In saying so ANTHONY cast himselfe out of his bedde to hide him-selfe from this vision, and died miserably the next day.

            IAMES DONAT a rich gentleman of Venice, beeing in bedde with his Wife, hauing a waxe candle light in the Chamber, &amp; two nurses sleeping by in a pallet with a little Childe, hee did see one open the Chamber doore verie softly, and an vnknowne man putting his head in at the dore. DONAT riseth, takes his sword, causeth two great Lamps to be light, &amp; goes with his Nurses into the hall, where hee findes all shut▪ where-vpon hee retiers backe to his Chamber much amazed. The next daie this little Childe not full a yeare olde, and who then was well, died. CARDAN in the same Booke and Chapter.
            
            Two Italian Marchants, being vpon the way to passe out of Piedmont into France, did incounter a man of a far heigher stature then any other, who calling them vnto him vsed this speech, returne to my Brother LODOVVIK and giue him these letters which I send him: They being much amazed, aske, what are you? I am, sayd he, GALEAS SFORZA, and so vanished sodenly. They turned head towards Milan, and from thence to Vigeneue, where LODOVVIK was at that time. They desire to speake with the Duke, saying that they had letters to deliuer him

from his Brother. The Courtiers laugh at them, and for that they were still importunate they were put in prison, and the racke was offred vnto them: but they did constantly maintaine their first wordes. Therevpon the Dukes Councell was in doubt what they should doe with these letters, not knowing what to answere, they were so much amazed: one of them called the Viconte GALEAS, takes these letters written in a paper folded like vnto the breefes that come from Rome, the contents whereof were, LODOVVIK, LODOVVIK looke to thy selfe, the Venetians, and the French will allie themselues togither to ruine thee, and to ouerthrowe thine estate: but if thou doest furnish mee with three thousand Crownes, I will giue order that their heartes shalbe mollefied, and that the mischiefe which doth threaten thee shalbe auoyded, hoping to preuaile if thou wilt trust mee. Happinesse come to thee. And beneath: the spirit of thy Brother GALEAS. Some were amazed at this strange accident, and others mocking at it: yet manie aduised him to consigne three thousand Crownes as neere as hee could to GALEAS intention. But GALEAS thinking they would laugh at him if hee should disburse the money, and deliuer it into strangers handes, would not doe anie thing, but sent the Merchantes euerie one home to their owne houses. But a little while after hee was cast out from his Duchie of Milan, and carried awaie prisoner. ARLVNO in the first section of the Historie of Milan.
            
            A certaine Italian hauing caused a friend of his that was dead, to bee honestly interred: and as hee returned to Rome, beeing surprized by the night, hee was forced

to staie in an Inne vpon the waie; where beeing wearie of his bodie and afflicted in minde he went to his bedde to rest himselfe. Beeing alone and awake, hee thought that his dead friende, pale and without flesh appeered vnto him, as hee was in his last sicknesse, and came neere vnto him, who lifting vp his head to behold him, and shaking with feare, hee demanded of him, what hee was. The dead bodie answering nothing, vndrest him-selfe, goes to bedde, and approched neere to him that was lyuing as hee imagined. The other not knowing which waie to turne him, lies closse to the beddes-side, and as the dead man approched, still hee thrust him backe. Seeing him-selfe thus repulst, hee frowned on him that was liuing, then hee riseth out of the bedde, and clothes him-selfe, puttes on his shooes, and goes out of the Chamber and appeeres no more. The lyuing man was so affrighted with this courtesie as hee had almost dyed. Hee sayed that when the dead man approched neere vnto him in the bedde, hee toucht one of his feete the which he found so cold, as no Ice was colder in comparison thereof. ALEXANDER of Alexandria Booke 2. of his Genial daies. Chapter. 9.
            TIRAQVELL in his Annotations vpon this Chapter, puttes all such visions amongst dreames. But I will neither maintaine the one nor the other at this present.
            A friend of mine called GORDIAN, a man worthie of credit: hath reported vnto mee that going towardes Arezzo with an other of his acquaintance, beeing straied out of the way, they entred into a forest, where they did see nothing but snowe, inaccessible places, and a fearefull sollitarinesse. The Sonne beeing lowe, they set

downe vpon the ground all tired. Herevpon they imagined to heare a mans voice nere vnto them. They approch and see vnder the earth there lay three Giantlike and fearefull figures of men, attired in long blacke gownes like moorners, with long haire &amp; beards, which did call them. As the two passengers came neerer, the three visions shewed farre greater then at the first, and one of them appeering naked danced and shewed very dishonest motions and countenances. These two being much amazed at this spectacle; beganne to flie away as fast as they could, and hauing runne ouer hills and dales, with much toile they came to a Country-mans Cottage, where they spent the night. In the same booke and Chap. I will adde that which I haue of mine owne knowledge, and whereof I am well assured. Beeing sicke at Rome, and in bedde, where I laie awake, there appeered vnto mee a vision of a faire woman, the which I did long behold, being very pensiue, and not speaking a worde, discoursing with my selfe whether I did dreame or were awake. And knowing that all my sinces were in their full vigour, and that this fantosme was still before mee, I asked what she was. She laughing repeated the same verie wordes as it were in mocking wise: and hauing long behelde mee, shee went her waie. In the same Booke and Chapter.
            
            A Monke called THOMAS, a man worthie of credit, and whose wisdome and iudgement I haue tried in manie affaires, hath reported vnto mee for truth, confirming it with an oth, that there had past some bitter wordes betwixt certaine other monkes and him, and after they had one iniured an other in wordes, he went all boyling with choller from among them, and walking alone in a great

Wood, hee mette with an ill fauoured Man, and of a terrible aspect, hauing a blacke beard and a long gowne, THOMAS asked him whether hee went? I haue lost answered hee, my horse, and go to seeke him in these neere fields. Here-vpon they goe together to finde this beast, and come neere vnto a little Riuer that was deepe. The Monke begins to put off his hoase to wade through: but the other doth presse him to hang vpon his shoulders, promising to passe him easily. THOMAS beleeues him, and being vpon his backe, he imbraceth him about the necke: but casting downe his eyes to see the passage, hee found that his Porter had strange and monsterous feete: where-with beeing much amazed, hee began to call vpon GOD for ayde. At that voyce, the enemie being confounded, cast downe his burthen, and grombling after a horrible manner, vanished away, with such a noyse, and so extraordinary a violence, as he pulled vp a great Oake that was neere, and brake all the bowes, ALEXANDER of Alexandria. lib. 4. Chap. 19.
            The Lord of a little Towne in the Principalitie of Sulmona in the Realme of Naples, shewed himselfe couetous and proud in his gouernement: so as his poore subiects could not subsist, but were strangely opprest by him. An honest man, but very poore and contemned, did for some occasion hurt a Hound belonging to this Lord very sore: Who greatly mooued for the death of his Dogge, caused this poore Man to bee layde holde on, and imprisoned in a hoale. After some dayes, the garde which kept all the doores carefully shutte, comming to open them according to their custome, to giue him a little bread, they found not their prisoner in his hoale. Hauing sought all places for him, and found

no markes nor shew of his escape, in the end they acquainted their Lord with this wonder, who at the first mockt and threatned them, but vnderstanding the trueth after-wards, hee was no lesse amazed then the rest. Three dayes after this Alarum, all the doores of the prison and of the Dungeon beeing shutte as before, the same Prisoner with-out the knowledge of any, was found shutte vp fast in the former Dungeon, hauing the face and countenance of a man distracted: who required them that they should lead him presently vnto their Lord, to whome hee had some-things of great and waighty importance to impart. Beeing brought before him, hee tolde him that hee was come from Hell. The occasion was, that beeing no longer able to endure the rigour of the prison, vanquished with despaire, fearing death, and voyde of good counsell, hee had called the Diuell to his ayde, that hee would drawe him out of that captiuitie. That soone after the euill spirit had appeared vnto him in the Dungeon, in a hideous and terrible forme, where they had made an agreement, according to the which hee had beene drawne and carryed from thence, not without greeuous torments, then cast head-long into places vnder-ground, that were wonderfull hollow, as in the bottome of the earth, where hee had seene the prisons of the wicked, their punishments, darkenesse, and horrible miseries, seates that were stincking and fearefull: Kings, Princes, and great men plunged in darkenesse, where they burnt in flaming fire, with vnspeakeable torments; that he had seene Popes, Cardinals and other Prelates attired in state, and other sorts of men in diuers equipages, afflicted with distinct punishments in

very deepe gulphes, where they were tormented incessantly. Adding, that hee had knowne there many of his acquaintance, namely one of his greatest friends, who knew him and inquired of his estate: the prisoner hauing tolde him that their Country was in the hands of a cruell Lord: hee then inioyned him, that beeing returned, he should command this rough Maister to leaue his tyranous vsage: and to tell him, that if hee continued, his place was markt in a certaine seate thereby, which he shewed vnto the prisoner. And to the end (sayd this spirit vnto the prisoner) that the Lord of whome wee speake, may giue credit vnto thy report: bid him remember the secret counsell, and the speech wee had together, when as we carryed armes together in a certaine warre, and vnder Commanders that hee named vnto him. Then he told him in particular this secret, their accord, the wordes and mutuall promises: the which the prisoner deliuered distinctly, one after another in order, vnto this Lord, who was wonderfully amazed at this message, wondering how it could bee, that things committed by him alone, the which hee had neuer discouered to any, should bee decifred vnto him so boldly by a poore subiect of his, who did represent them, as if hee had read them in a Booke.
            They adde, that the prisoner hauing inquired of the other with whom hee deuised in Hell, if it were possible and true, that so many Men whom hee did see stately apparrelled, should feele any torments: the other answered, that they were burnt with continuall fire, and tortured with greeuous and vnspeakeable punishments, and that all those ornaments of Golde and Scarlate, were nothing else but burning fire so couloured.
            
               That being desirous to feele if it were so, hee went neere to touch this Scarlate; which the other perswaded him to forbeare: but the heate of the fire had scorcht all the palme of his hand, the which hee shewed as it were roasted in the embers of a great fire. The poore prisoner beeing set at libertie, seemed to those that came vnto him at his returne to his house, as a man distracted and growne dull, which doth neither heare nor see, alwayes pensiue, speaking little, and scarce answering the questions that were demanded him. His face was become so hideous, and his countenance so foule and wilde after this voyage, as his Wife and Children did scarce know him: and when they knew him, there was nothing but crying and weeping, seeing him so changed. Hee liued but fewe dayes after his returne, and could hardly settle his poore etate, hee was so transported and changed. AEEXANDER of Alexandria, liber 6. Chap. 21.

One daye the Maister beeing to goe forthe, recommended his Horses vnto his seruant, especially one aboue the rest, which was of some price: this seruant was so expert as hee drewe this horse vp into a very high Tower. When the Maister returned, his Horse (which had his head at the window) knew him, and began to neigh. The Maister being amazed, demanded who had placed his Horse in so high a Stable. This good seruant answered, that it was

with an intent to keepe him safe, that hee might not bee lost, and that hee had carefully executed his Maisters commandement. They had much a doe to shackle this poore beast, and to let him downe with Ropes from the top of the Tower. Soone after, some whome this Gentleman had robd, resoluing to pursue him in Iustice, his Horse-keeper sayde vnto him. Maister saue your selfe, shewing him a Sack, out of the which hee drew many horse-shoes puld by him from horse-feete to staye their course in the voyage which they vnder-tooke against his Maister, who in the end being taken, and put in prison, inrreated his Horse-keeper to helpe him. You are too fast bound there, answered the seruant, I cannot free you. But the Maister making great instance, in the end his seruant sayde: I will drawe you out of captiuitie, so as you make no signe with your hands thinking to saue your selfe. Which agreed vppon, hee takes him with his shackles and Bolttes, and carryes him through the ayre. This miserable Maister beeing amazed to see himselfe in such a strange field, began to crye out. Oh eternall GOD, whether doe they carrye mee? Sodenlye his seruant (that is to say the Diuell) let him fall in a Marish: then comming home to the house, lettes the Gentle-woman his Wife to vnderstand, in what estate and where her Husband was, that they might goe and deliuer him.
            A riche man of Halberstad a famous Towne in Germanie, did vsually keepe a good Table, giuing vnto himselfe all the pleasures in this world hee could deuise, so little carefull of his soules health, as one day hee presumed to powre forth this blasphemie among his riotous companions, that if hee might alwayes spend his dayes

in delights, hee would desire no other life. But after some dayes, and beyond his expectation, hee must needs dye.
            After his death, there were dayly seene at night in his house (which was stately built) visions which appeared, so as the seruants were forced to seeke an other aboade. This riche man appeared with a troupe of other Banketmakers, in a Hall, which in his life-time serued onely to make seasts in. Hee was compassed in by seruants which held Torches in their hands, and serued at a Table that was couered with Cuppes and Goblets guilt, carrying many Dishes, and then taking them away. More-ouer, they heard the noyse of Flutes, Luthes, Virginals, and other Instruments of Musicke. To conclude, all worldly pompe, where-in this riche-man had taken delight in his life time. GOD did suffer Sathan to represent such illusions to the eyes of many, that hee might roote out impietie from the hearts of Epicures. IO

            In the yeare 1532. a Germaine Gentleman, cruell to his subiects, commanded a certaine peasant to fetch him a great Oake out of the next forrest, and to bring it to his house, or else hee should bee cruelly intreated: the Country-man holding it impossible, goes away sighing and weeping. Being entred into the Forrest, hee meetes a man (which was the Diuell) who inquires of him the cause of his heauinesse: whome the Country-man hauing satisfied, the other hauing commanded him to returne, promiseth to giue order the Gentle man should haue an Oake quickly. The peasant was scarce returned to the Village, but his man in the Forrest had cast

athwart the Gentlemans doore one of the greatest Oakes that hee could choose, with-all his bowes, and branches. And which is more, this Tree became hard as Yron, so as it was impossible to cut it in peeces▪ and the Gentle-man was constrained to his shame, trouble, and charge, to peece his house on the other side, and to make new doores and windowes.

            There is a Village in the Dutchie of Brunswick, called Gehern, two Leagues from Blommenaw. In the yeare 1555. a Country-man going out from that place in the morning with his Carte and Horses to fetch Woode in the Forrest, he discouered at the entrie there-of certaine troupes of Reisters wearing black armes. Being amazed at this incounter, hee returned to carry newes vnto the Village. The most ancient of the place accompanied with their Curate or Pastor, went presently into field, being followed by a hundred persons, as well men as women, and they number foure-teene bands or distinct troopes, the which in an instant put them-selues into two great Battaylons, one right against an other, as it were ready to fight. Then afterwards they did see comming out of eyther squadron, a great man, of a fierce aspect, and verry terrible to behold. These two of eyther side light from their Horses, seeming to make a carefull and diligent reuiew of their troupes: which done, they goe to Horse againe. Presently the troopes began to aduance themselues, and to runne ouer a great champian field, without any charge or shocke: the which held and continued vntill it was darke night, in the view of all the Country-men. At that present time there was no speech in all the Dutchie of Brunswike,

In the ende he fell sick, died, and was carried to his graue with great pompe. Soone after hee appeered to be lyuing againe, and making much of many, hee imbruced some so strongly, as some died, others were greeuiously sicke: all affirming that rich HVBENET had so handled them: and that he was in the same sort, as he was in his life time. The Magistrates of the place descouering that it was a diuilish illusion, decreed that HVBENETS bodie should be taken vp againe.

            ANTHONY COSTILLE a Spanish Gentleman, remayning at Fontaines of Ropell, went one daie from his house well

mounted, for the dispatch of some affaires, some Leagues of, the which done and night approching, hee resolued to returne vnto his house. Going forth of the village where hee had beene, hee found a little Hermitage and Chapell with certaine lattise windowes of woode, and a Lampe burning within it. Beeing alighted from his Horse, hee did his deuotion, then casting his eye into the Hermitage, hee did see to his thinking, comming from vnder the ground three persones which came towardes him with their heads couered, and then to stand still. Hauing be held them a little, seeing their haire shine and sparkle, although hee were held to bee verie valiant, yet hee was affraied, and going to Horse-backe hee beganne to flie. But lifting vp his eyes, hee descouers these persons which went a little before him and seemed to accompanie him. Recommending him-selfe continually vnto almightie GOD, hee turned first one waie then an other waie, but this troupe was alwaies aboute him. In the ende hee coucht a short Lance which hee carried, and spurd for-warde to strike them: but these visions went as fast as the Horse, so as ANTHONIE was forced to take them in his company, vnto the gate of his lodging, where there was a great Court.
            Beeing alighted, hee enters, and findes these fantosmes; hee goes vp to a Chamber dore where his Wife was, who opened it at his voice: and as hee entered the visions vanished awaie. But hee seemed to bee so amazed and troubled, as his Wife thought that hee had beene verie ill vsed by his enemies in that voyage. Beeing demanded, and not able to drawe anie thing from him, shee sent for a verie friend of his, a Learned man, who came presently: and finding him as pale as a dead

man, intreated him verie earnestly to discouer his aduenture. COSTILLE hauing made the who discours vnto him, this friend labored to resolue him, then made him suppe, conducted him to his Chamber, left him vpon his bead with a candle light on the table, and departed to leaue him to his rest. He was scarce out of the Chamber, but COSTILLE beganne to crie out helpe, helpe, succor me. Then all his seruants entred into the Chamber, to whome hee sayd that the three visions were come to him beeing alone, and that hauing scracht vp the earth with their handes, they had cast it vpon his eyes, so as hee did not see an

            IOHN VELASQVES de AYOLLA &amp; two other yong Spaniards going out of their Country to studie the Lawe at Bolognia the fat, not finding a conuenient lodging to liue sparingly in: they were aduertised that in the same streete where their Inne was, there was a house left desert and abandoned, by reason of certaine visions which appeered there, the which they might haue to dwell in without anie rent, as long as they should please to staie in it.
            They accept of the condition, fit them-selues with stuffe, and passe the time merilie for a monethes space. At the ende whereof, AYOLAS two companions going to bedde earlie, and hee late in his studie, hearing a great noise as it had beene of manie iron chaines, shaken togither, hee went out of his studie, with his sword,

and in his other hand his candle-light, then hee planted him-selfe in the midest of the Hall, without a waking his companions, expecting what should beecome of this noise, the which in his opynion came from beneath the staires, answering to a great Court, right beefore the Hall. Beeing in this expectation hee descouers at the staires dore a verie greeuious and fearefull vision, of a Carcasse that had nothing at all but bare boanes, drawing about his feete and the middle of his bodie, these chaines which made such a noyse. This vision stayed, and AYOLA resuming courrage, beganne to coniure it, that hee should let him vnderstand in some conuenient manner what hee would haue. The vision beganne to crosse his armes, to hold downe his head, and to becken him with one hand to followe him downe the staires. AYOLA answered, goe before and I will followe thee: where-vpon the vision begannne to go downe softly, like vnto one that were 
                  •…
               ettered: beeing followed by AYOLA, whose candell went out on the midest of the staires.
            This renewed his feare, yet incorraging him-selfe againe, hee sayd vnto the vision, thou seest that my candle is out, I will goe and light it againe: if thou wilt tarrie for mee heere in this same place, I will returne presently vnto thee againe. Hee ranne to the harth where the fire was, and lighted his candell, and came to the staires, where he found the vision standing there and then hee followed it. Hauing crost the Court of the lodging, they enter into a great gardin, in the midest whereof was a well: the which made AYOLA thinke that this vision would doe him some harme: and therefore hee stayed. But the vision then made a

signe vnto him to goe to another place in the Garden, and as hee went thether, the vision sodenly vanished away. AYOLA being alone, began to call him, protesting that he would do any thing that was in his power, and stayed there awhile: But the vision appeared no more, and the Spaniard returned to his Chamber, and awaked his companions, who seeing him so pale, gaue him a little Wine and some comfitures, inquiring of his aduenture, the which hee reported vnto them. Soone after this accident being bruted throughout all the Citty, the Gouernor inquired carefully of the manner of it, and vnderstanding all circumstances by the relation of AYOLA, hee caused some to digge where-as the vision vanished away. There they found a carcase in Chaines as AYOLA had seene it, in a deepe Sepulchre, from whence being drawne and interred in an other place with others, all the noise which had beene before in this great lodging ceased. The Spaniards returning into Spaine, AYOLA was made a Iudge, and had a Sonne who was a President in a Towne of Spaine, in the time of TORQVEMADO, who made this discourse in the third Iourney of his Hexameron.

And for that the Farmer made no accoumpt of it, soone after his Sonne was slaine. Some dayes after the vision returned,

There is a later Historie, well knowne to the Parisiens, but not printed, the which happened in Paris, in Saint Honores streete, at the signe of the redde Horse. A Weauer of Lace had taken his Niece home to him beeing an Orphelin. One a time the maide praying vpon her Fathers graue where hee was buried at Saint Geruais, Sathan presented him-selfe vnto her, in the shape of a tall blacke man: taking her by the hand and saying, my friend feare nothing, thy Father and thy Mother are well. But thou must saie certaine Masses, and goe in pilgrymage to our Ladie of Vertus, and they shall goestraight into Paradice. The maide demandes

of this spirit, who was so carefull of mans helth, what hee was? Hee answered that hee was Sathan, and that shee should not bee amazed. The mayde did what was commanded her. Which done hee sayd she must goe in pilgrymage to Saint Iames. Shee answered, I cannot goe so farre. After that Sathan did not cease to importune her, talking famyiiarly to her beeing alone, and doing her worke, saying these wordes vnto her. Thou art cruell, thou wilt not put thy sizers in thy bosome for my sake: the which shee did to content him and to bee ridde of him. But this done, hee demaunded some guifte of her, yea, some of her haire, whereof shee gaue him a locke. Some daies after hee perswaded her to cast her-selfe into the water, and sometimes to hang her-selfe, putting the rope of a well about her necke: but shee cryed out in such sort as hee did no more vrge her. And yet her Vncle seeking one daie to bee reuenged of him, was so well beaten, as hee continued aboue fiueteene daies sicke in his bedde.

Then the Knight felt this Moore come vp, and goe to bed to him, hauing imbraced one another, they began to wrestle with all their force, making such a noyse, as those of the house did awake, and comming to see what it was, they found none but the Knight, who was in a great heat, and was wet, as if he had come out of a Bathe.

necke, and enuironed about with fire. The second was a Wolse, casting fire out at his throate, and aboute him a circle of fire. The third was a Lion, whose haire a man, armed at all partes, and standing vp right, at the entrie of the mountaines, did gently handle, and it seemed that this Lion reioyced at the man, holding forth his pawe to him, in signe of salutation.

Secondly a man on hors-back which carried the tree, but all the boughs puld of: thirdly there was seene a hound: Forthly a great blacke Crosse, in a thicke Cloude: Fiftly the lightning was seene comming out of this Cloud, with so horrible and violent a cracke of thunder, and so full of sparkes of fire, as they thought it would haue consumed a Village, ouer which it was likely to fall: and there was a maide so terrefied, as with a violent crie to her Mother for helpe, shee intreated that shee might bee couered. Although I will not enter into the exposition of this vision, yet I gather by that which hath since followed, that such Images haue represented the changes which haue happened in the house of Saxony togither with the calamities and ruines of Churches.

Not farre from this man laie a mans head, without a bodie, wearing an Imperiall diademe. Neere vnto it there was a wilde boares head with his tuskes, and two Dragons vomyting forth fire. Then there appeered an Image of a good bigge Towne alone, neere vnto a Lake, beseeged by Water and Lande, and ouer it a Crosse of the collour of bloud, the which by little and little grewe blacke. An other horse-man all flaming, and carrying on his head an Emperors Crowne, presented him-selfe presently, beeing followed by a horse without a guide: then in the midest of a spacious plaine, there appeered two Castles on fire, neere vnto a heigh Mountaine, vpon the which was a great Eagle, hyding halfe his bodie beehinde the Mountaine, and there appeered also certaine little Eagles, hauing white fethers and verie bright, and with all a Lyons head Crowned, and a Cocke pecking at this head, so long vntill it was parted from the bodie, and so vanished away. There were other Lions and neere vnto the wild Boars head, an Vnicorne the which by little &amp; little did change into the forme of a Dragon: with a great number other beasts of vnaccustomed formes and greatnesse. Moreouer vpon an heigh rocke there appeered a fortresse enuitoned with two Campes, and all the

Heauens seemed to be ful of Townes, Villages and Castells: but all was presently consumed by fire, and all the ruines of this great circuit, seemed to be lightning, and to fall into a great poole, nothing remaining but Towers whereas the great Cittie had appeered, vpon the banke of the Lake, was seene a mighty Camell, seeming to staie therefore to drinke.

In the same Chamber were manie men in long robbes which seemed to consult about this Lion, the which in the ende did leape from the forme, as it were to flie vppon them with his great pawes. They ioyning close togither oppose them-selues against the Lion, and giue him manie stabbes with a dagger, finally hauing compassed him in, by the meanes of a Chaier which they cast vppon him, they cut of his tayle: but soone after beeing gotten from vnder the Chaire, hee returnes to his place, and leapes vppon the forme. As these men had beegonne againe to goe in and out, as it were to conspier the Lions death, hee enters into a rage and flies violentlie vpon them, who beganne to crie out, and to hold open their armes to the olde man that slept, who awaking verie sodenlie and lifting vp his head, shaking his right hande hee threatned the Lion, who perceyuing it, retyred him-selfe, and looking some-times vppon the olde man, hee lept vppon the forme, where hee was transformed to IESVS CHRIST standing vp-right

and preaching, before whom these men falling prostrate, as it were to demand pardon, and hauing obtained it, all these Images vanished. The same.
            
            In the yeare 1545. the day after Whitsunday, there were seene in Silesia these shapes. A Beare came frō the East, leading an Armie in good order: against whome marched a Lion from the West with other troupes. Betwixt the two Armies did shine a very bright starre. Presently they began a fierce charge, so as it seemed the bloud did gushe from those bodies that were wounded, and that many fell downe dead vpon the place. During this Combate, an Eagle parting from a certaine high Rocke, did houer ouer the Lions troupes. After a long fight, and when as it seemed to bee ended, the Lion appeared againe, shining in the middest of his bands: but they could not discerne the Beare, the body of his Armie beeing broken and disperst: about the which there were many olde men, with white beards, and reuerent countenauces. The fight being ended, the Lion led back his Armie towards the West, and beeing aduanced a good way, one mounted vpon a braue White Horse, lest the Armie, and came to the place of Battaile, mounting vpon this Horse a young man that was all armed, who was standing vpright, and hauing accompanied him towards the East, all these figures vanished. The same.
            
            In the yeare 1549. some of the best Citizens of Brunswike, traueling by night about some necessarie businesse, they did see the Moone enuironed with a very bright Circle, and neere vnto it two other Moones. This Circle went foure times about it: and neere the two other Moones, there appeared a Lion all on fire: an

Eagle which pierst her brest: then the figure of the most famous Prince IHON FREDERICK Duke of Saxony: and another figure of the Creation of EVE, drawne out of ADAMS side: them GOD sitting, and at his knees ADAM and EVE, whom hee intreated louingly, as the Father doth often-times his Children. After that there appeared a horrible sight of Townes all on fire, about the which there was a Camell, the figure of IESVS CHRIST hanging vpon the Crosse, and about it his Apostles. The last figure was most fearefull of them all. There was a man standing vpright, of a cruell aspect, holding in his hand a naked sword, with the which hee made shew to strike a young Maiden that was kneeling before him, and who with teares in her eyes intreated him to spare her. Other shapes were seene in some other places. The same.
            
            Here-vnto Doctor PEVCER addes that which followeth. Although it hath beene euer demanded, by what vertue such figures were fashioned in the ayre, seeing that the regions of the ayre are neuer with-out exhalations: whether these exhalations by incounter, or being scattered, after some distance, come to ioyne together, and to cause those figures, so as the light of heauen giuing them a coulour, some are white, others redde and fiery, according to the qualitie of vapours: or else, whether the naturall intelligences, which fore-see things to come, doe cause these figures, eyther by the helpe of vapours and exhalations, or of some apparent brightnesse. For my part, I thinke that most of these figures and sights are made and framed by the LORD GOD himselfe, or by his holy Angels, who for the loue of man-kinde, whom they see beloued of GOD, set before our eyes

by the meanes of these formes, a plaine representation and continuance of euents: not that wee should foresee that which wee cannot auoyde: but beeing admonished by such aduertisements, we should thinke of our sinnes: sound the depth of dangers, and remember in our hearts the admonitions and consolations which are propounded vnto vs in the holy Scriptures; so as in the middest of the darts which are cast against vs, when as there is no hope but of vtter confusion, without rising, we may prostrate our selues humbly at his feete, and neuer cease with cleane hands and pure conscienses, to pray and intreate him, that not respecting the merites of the worlds iniquities, hee will receiue vs into his protection, maintaine and defend vs from the violence of the enemies of our saluation, and turne away all the miseries that hang ouer our heads. It is also likely, that some-times the Diuels are busied about such workes. But to conclude, the wandring and inconstant incounter of exhalations, cannot make such goodly signes and formes, so well ordered, and of things subiect to the prouidence of GOD, if we will not foolishly and wickedly maintaine with Epicures, that the world consists and is managed and gouerned by hazard and fortune.
