            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               The Theſes confirmed in this Booke, by the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, and the Primitiue Church eſtabliſhed by the holy Apoſtles.
            
            
               The firſt THESE.
               
                  THe white Garment was in vſe in the Idolatrous Religion of the Egyptians, during the time that the 
                     •••
                  aelites were bondmen in Egypt, and did worſhip the Egyptians Idols: but God giuing the Law to Moſes, conuerted that Idolatrous vſe of the ſaid white Garment to his Seruice: and in the firſt eſtabliſhment of Chriſts Church in Ieruſalem, the Prieſts which were by the Apoſtles conuerted to the Faith, did vſe the white Garment in the ſeruice of Chriſtian Religion; the vſe whereof did continue from the Primitiue Church to our dayes: and therefore the reuerend Biſhops and Martyrs of Chriſt, who did reforme the Church of England, did lawfully retaine the vſe of the white Garment, in the Church Seruice, notwithſtanding the abuſe thereof in the Popiſh Idolatrie.
            
            
               
               The ſecond THESE.
               THe Iewes and the Gentiles, in the time of the Natiuitie of Chriſt, were accuſtomed to lie about a Table, ſet low, as well in their ordinarie meales and Suppers, as in their ſolemne feaſts; and Chriſt finding this cuſtome in vſe in the feaſts of the Eaſter Lambe, hee retained it in the Inſtitution and celebration of the holy Communion, notwithſtanding, that it was before his Natiuitie vſed, in the ſolemne Feaſts, in the Temples of Idols. Therefore, ſeeing Chriſt did neyther ſtand, ſit, nor kneele, in this holy Action, but followed the cuſtome receiued, there is no neceſsitie in any of theſe geſtares, but they are indifferent: ſo that euery man ſhould follow the receiued Cuſtome in the Church where hee doth liue and dwell: And that although this geſture of kneeling was, and is yet abuſed in the Popiſh Idolatry, it was lawfully retained by the godly Reformers of the Church of England.
            
            
               
               The third THESE.
               THE Apoſtles, and Chriſts Church founded by them, did vſe to celebrate a publike feaſt in their Aſſemblies, which was called Agape, or the Feaſt of Charitie: becauſe in it the poore were relieued by the rich: after which, their cuſtome was to celebrate the Lords Supper, all lying on Carpets, Cuſhens, or the like, as Chriſt did: which cuſtome continued in many places, many hundred yeeres, but the Catholike Church did change this cuſtome both of lying and eating after Supper: which change is allowed of by thoſe, who in our time haue brought in the geſture of ſitting at table in receiuing the Communion. And therefore, there is no reaſon, but they ſhould as well allow of the change of lying into kneeling.
            
            
               
               The fourth THESE.
               ACcording to the Analogie of the Scriptures, kneeling is the moſt conuenient geſture that is to be vſed in our Inuocations, or Prayers, before, and in the receiuing of the holy Communion, in the which Prayers, the geſture of kneeling was vſed in the old Maſſe, which was agreeable to our Communion, and was not an Idolatrous Institution. And therefore the Reformers of the Church of England, haue done well to reſtore the kneeling to the originall vſe againe.
            
            
               
               The firſt THESE.
               THe white Garment was in vſe in the Idolatrous Religion of the Egyptians, during the time that the Iſraelites were bond-men in Egypt, and did worſhip the Egyptians Idols: but God giuing the Law to Moſes, conuerted that Idolatrous vſe of the ſaid white Garment to his Seruice: and in the firſt eſtabliſhment of Chriſts Church in Ieruſalem, the Prieſts which were by the Apoſtles conuerted to the Faith, did vſe the white Garment in the ſeruice of Chriſtian Religion; the vſe whereof did continue from the Primatiue Church to our dayes: and therefore the reuerend Biſhops and Martyrs of Chriſt, who did reforme the Church of England, did lawfully retaine the vſe of the white Garment, in the Church Seruice, notwithſtanding the abuſe thereof in the Popiſh Idolatrie.
               
                  The illuſtration, and confirmation of the firſt part of the firſt THESIS.
                  
                     ACcording to the Greeke Hiſtorians, the Idoll of Iſis was the moſt ancient that the Egyptians worſhipped: of the which Herod. ibidem boues mares coſdem

                     Herodot ſaith, that all the Egiptians did worſhip it vnder the forme of a Cow, and that they did worſhip aboue all beaſts the Cow.

                     Siculus, in his Hiſtory of Antiquitie, and many other Greeke Writers, teſtifie, that Iſis was the first inuenter of the ſowing and reaping of Cornes.
                  The ſaid Diodorus related, that in a Colome or Pillar dedicated to this Idoll, was written theſe words; 
                        Ego Iſis ſum Egipti Regina, à Mercurio erudita, quae ego legibus ſtatui, nullus ſoluet; ego ſum prima frugū inuentrix, &amp;c.
                      
                     I am Iſis, the Queene of Egipt, taught by Mercurius, none ſhall diſſolue the lawes which I haue made, I am the firſt inuenter of cornes.

                        . 
                     Plutarch, in his Booke of Iſis and Oſiris, relates, that there was an Inſcription in the floore of the Temple of Iſis, in theſe words; I am all that euer was, that is, and ſhall be, and no mortall man hath euer detected my Garment.
                  
                  Wee obſerue by the way, that the name of Iſis, in Hebrew is Ieſch, Ieſch, eſt, eſt, which ſignifies, alwayes exiſtant, not ſubiect to the courſe of time; which is the eſſentiall name of GOD, mentioned in the third Chapter of Exodus, verſe 14. Eieh aſher eieh, I am that I am, Thou ſhalt ſay vnto the children of Iſrael, I am, ſent mee vnto you. The which name doth come from the Verbe ſubſtantiue Haiah, ſignifying it was, and in the future time, eieh, which ſignifies, I ſhall be, as S. Iohn in his Reuelation, Chap. 1. ver. 4. doth interpret the ſelfe-ſame name of God, ſaying, from him that was, and is, and is to come: ſo that it ſeemeth that the poſteritie of Mizram, ſonne to Cham, ſonne of Noah, which did firſt inhabite Egypt, did retaine the true name of God, which they learned of Noah, but afterward it was conuerted to a fabulous Idoll, which they did call Is, Is: whereof the Greekes made corruptly Iſis.
                  
                  Alwayes it is certaine by the Scriptures, that the Egyptians did worſhip Idols in the time of Moſes, whoſe Prieſts were the Wiſe-men, Sorcerers; and Charmers, that did imitate the miracle of the conuerſion of Moſes Rodde into a Serpent. Theſe Prieſts did weare linnen Garments, and therefore were called linigeri, as wee read in

                      writing to the Gentiles, in the defence of Chriſtian religion, to induce them to become Chriſtians, ſaith, that the Iſraelites did remaine a long time in Egypt, where they were infected with the euill manners of the Egyptians, &amp; were taught by them to offer Sacrifices to the Diabolicke Idols, and were accuſtomed to dauncing, and to Inſtruments of Muſicke, &amp;c. God did deliuer them, and gaue them a Law, by the which he commanded them to offer to him who is the true God, in Sacrifice, all thoſe things which they did wickedly worſhip before (to wit, in Egypt) of earthly Beaſts, the Goats, the Bullockes, and Sheepe; of flying Beaſts, the Turtle and the Doue, &amp;c.
                  God did not inſtitute Sacrifices, as hauing neede of killed Beaſts, or that hee hath any pleaſure in the ſauour of burnt fleſh: but hee did ſo of his wiſedome, in conſideration of the peoples weakneſſe: euen ſo did he ſuffer Muſicall Inſtruments, to wit, in the time of the Sacrifice, not that hee would pleaſe his eares with the conſent of the ſinging of them, but that he might by little and little, draw away the deluſions of the Idols: Thus farre be the words of Theodoretus.
                  
                  Seeing that God ordained the Ceremonies, with the which the Iſraelites were accuſtomed when they did worſhip the Idols of Egypt, to be vſed in his owne worſhip, it followes, that theſe cuſtomes and Ceremonies, as alſo the materiall things that were abuſed to Idolatry, the Surplice, Muſicke, and Muſicall Inſtrument, may lawfully be conuerted to ſome vſe in the true worſhip of God, according to theſe examples of the Ceremoniall Law.
                  In the time of the Captiuitie of Babilon, Dan. 5. 2. 3. 4. 
                     Belſhazzar
                     
did make a great feaſt, and commanded to bring him the golden and ſiluer veſſels, which his Father Nabuchadnezzer had brought from the Temple of Ieruſalem, and the King; and his Princes, his wiues &amp; his Concubines dranke in them, and praiſed the Gods of gold and ſiluer; and notwithſtanding that theſe were prophaned to the Seruice of Idols, yet when Cyrus did ſend the people of Iudah to build vp againe the Temple and the Citie of Ieruſalem, he reſtored to them the veſſels of the houſe of the Lord. The Prieſts of the ſecond Eſdr. 1. 7. 8. Temple did vſe them in the ſeruice of the true God, although they were (as is ſaid) abuſed in the Idolatrous Feaſts, to the Seruice of the falſe Gods of Babilon. Euen ſo, the externall Ceremonies, as well of cloathing, as others, which are vſed in the Church of England, were firſt inſtituted to be vſed in the Seruice of the true Religion, but afterward was violently employed by the Popes, after they became temporall Tyrants, to the Seruice of the new Idoll of the Maſſe: and now againe, the Maſſe being aboliſhed, are reſtored vnto their true and ancient vſe in the worſhip of God.
                  By theſe examples then of the olde Teſtament it is manifeſt, that it is lawfull to conuert the clothing veſture and Ceremonies, abuſed by the Popiſh Idolatrie, to be vſed in the true worſhip of God.
                  A great number of the Prieſts were conuerted, Acts 6. 7. all which did continue in obſeruing of the Law, &amp;c. Acts 17. 20. So that the Prieſts being made Chriſtians, did wear the linnen Ephod. Ioſippus, who was neare to the

                  The formes and Ceremonies of the Chriſtian Church were not eſtabliſhed in the time of the Acts of the Apoſtles, but afterward, and S. Iohn the Euangeliſt did ouerliue all the Apoſtles and S. Paul many yeeres: for S. Paul and S. Peter were put to death by Nero, which was An. 70.
                  But S. Iohn did liue to the time of Traiane the Emperour, who did beginne Anno. Dom. 100. and then writ

his Euangell, 30. yeeres after the death of the Apoſtles: during the which time, hee being the alone Apoſtle that did liue long, and being Biſhop of Epheſus, hee eſtabliſhed the forme and Ceremonies of Chriſtian Religion, hee did weare, as a Prieſt or Biſhop, the white Garment: of this we haue an euident teſtimonie, written by Euſeb. Eccleſ. hiſt. lib. 3. cap. 25 Ioannes qui ſuprapectus Domini recubuit,

                     Policratis, Biſhop of Epheſus, and one of S. Iohns Succeſſors, who did write in an Epiſtle ſent to Uictor Biſhop of Rome, that Iohn, who did lie on Chriſts breaſt, was a Prieſt, and did weare a garment, called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     Daniel (ſaith Clemens) doth ſpeake euidently and purely, ſaying, the Thrones were placed, and one like to be of very olde age did ſit on them, and his clothing was white as the Snow. Iohn ſaith, that hee did ſee in a viſion, the Lord wearing ſuch a clothing. Alſo hee ſaith, hee did ſee the Soules that were Martyrs or witneſſes of Chriſt, vnder the Altar, and that to euery one of them was giuen 
                        ••
                      white garment, &amp;c.
                  And the ſaid Clemens ſaith, I doe approue the Philoſophers of the Ile of Coos, who did deſcribe Vertue and Wickedneſſe by two fit Images. Hee made the Image of Vertue, ſtanding ſimply clothed with a white Garment, as being the Vertue; a pure thing decked with modeſtie. And a little after he ſaith, if any will all edge Chriſts long clothing of diuers colours, it ſignified the diuen

and ſundry colours of wiſedome, and of the Scriptures, which neuer withered, and the eloquent ſpeeches of the Lord, which doth ſhine with the clearenes of the truth. Thus farre the words of Clemens.
                  
                  This teſtimonie, which is very euident, is a proofe that the vſe of the white garment was continued amongſt the Chriſtians, after the death of the Apoſtles.

                  This was the firſt Temple, builded 300. yeeres after Chriſt▪ when Conſtantinus Magnus did eſtabliſh the Chriſtian Religion.
                  Theſe teſtimonies ſerue to proue, that the firſt three hundred yeeres after Chriſt, which was the time of the perfection of the Primitiue Church, when the Biſhops and Preſbiters were holy Martyrs, that they did vſe a white garment, in exerciſing the Church ſeruice.

                  So that the ancient Primatiue Church called the weeke

which followed Eaſter weeke, Septima in albis, the weeke 
                        Septimana in albis, vide capitula Carol. Maxim. anno Dom. 800. in white clothing; becauſe the Baptiſme was adminiſtrated in that weeke, and Whitſun weeke onely, vnleſſe the Children were in danger of their life.
                  I hope in God that theſe teſtimonies and proofes heretofore cited, ſhall perſwade all reaſonable mens conſciences two poynts concerning this matter: the one is, that although the white Garment was abuſed in the ſeruice of the falſe Gods and Idols of the Gentiles, both before the Law of Moſes; and alſo before, and in Chriſt and his Apoſtles time, yet they did not abrogate the vſe of the ſaid white Garment, but conuerted it to the Seruice of the true God, to be vſed in all religious Seruice of the Church: and conſequently, the Reformers of the Church of England, haue lawfully retained the vſe of the white Garment, notwithſtanding that it is vſed to the ſeruice of Idols in the Popiſh Church.
                  The ſecond point is, that the vſe of the white Garment is an Inſtitution Apoſtolike: and ſeeing that the ſaid Booke of the Conſtitution of the Apoſtles maketh mention thereof, and that Iames the Lords Brother, and Iohn the Euangeliſt, his beloued Diſciple, did vſe the ſaid Garment, as is euident by the teſtimonies heretofore cited; it followeth, that the vſe of it in our Church Seruices of England, hath for the warrant thereof the authoritie of the holy Apoſtles of Chriſt, ſo that no man which will follow the example of the Apoſtles, ſhould except anything againſt the vſe of the ſaid white Garment.
               
            
            
               
               The ſecond THESE.
               THe Iewes and the Gentiles, in the time of the Natiuitie of Chriſt, were accuſtomed to lie about a Table, ſet low, as well in their ordinarie meales and Suppers, as in their ſolemne feaſts; and Chriſt finding this cuſtome in vſe in the feaſts of the Eaſter Lambe, hee retained it in the Inſtitution and celebration of the holy Communion, notwithſtanding, that it was before his Natiuitie vſed, in the ſolemne Feaſts, in the Temples of Idols. Therefore, ſeeing Chriſt did neyther ſtand, ſit, nor kneele, in this holy Action, but followed the cuſtome receiued, there is no neceſsitie in any of theſe geſtures, but they are indifferent: ſo that euery man ſhould follow the receiued Cuſtome in the Church where hee doth liue and dwell: And that although this geſture of kneeling was, and is yet abuſed in the Popiſh Idolatry, it was lawfully retained by the godly Reformers of the Church of England.
               
                  The Teſtimonies and proofes of this, doe follow.
                  
                     THe Iewes, during the time of the ſecond Temple, were Subiects, and Tributaries; ſometime to the Perſians; ſometime to the Grecians, and the Syrians: and finally, were ſubdued by Pompey, and made a Romane Prouince, about ſixty

yeeres before Chriſts Incarnation: being thus ſubdued, they were gouerned by the Romiſh Deputies, who did keepe in Ieruſalem a ſtrong Gariſon of Souldiours: ſo that this was the cauſe why the Iewes did imitate and follow many of the Cuſtomes and Rites of the Perſians, Greekes and Romanes; as well in the ſolemne feaſts of the Church, as in their ordinarie dinners and Suppers at home.
                  The Heatheniſh Romane Hiſtoriographers, and Poets, doe teach vs, that they were accuſtomed in their moſt ſolemne Sacrifices to make publike Feaſts in the Temples of their Idols, which they did celebrate lying vpon Beds, Carpets, or Cuſhens, ſpread vpon the floore of their Temples, euen as they did in their ſolemne Feaſts in their houſes.
                  The learned doe write, that theſe beds, or cuſhens, &amp;c. which they did lie vpon, were called

For in the firſt Booke of his Aeneids, the forme of that ſolemne Supper which Queene Dido made in her Pallace to Aeneds, and to his fellowes, is deſcribed; where it is ſaid, that in eating and drinking, at that ſolemne Supper, they did lye downe vpon moſt coſtly Carpets.

                      Capitoll of the Heatheniſh Rome, in the ſolemne feaſts made to their falſe Gods, the cuſtome was, as (you heard before) to lay downe their Images vpon beds, or thicke Carpets, and to ſet before them all kinde of meates and drinke, which was eaten and drunke vp by the Prieſts and others, which were buſied about the Sacrifices.
                  The ſelfe-ſame geſture of the body was vſed in Saint Pauls time, at ſuch feaſts as were celebrated in the Temples

Liuius libro 5. in Capitolio (inquit) Stratis tribus lectis, conuiuiū opponebatur tribus Dijs, Ioui, Iunoni, &amp; Mineruae: Iupiter, id est, Iouis, ſimulacrū ſternebatur in lectulo recubans.

                  The learned Chriſtians of Corinth, which were truely conuerted, were perſwaded, that the Idols were not gods, and therefore, that they had no power at all to contaminate, or defile, the meate which was dedicated vnto them, becauſe it was Gods creature, giuen to men to be vſed with thankſgiuing, wherefore they made no conſcience to aſſiſt at their feaſts. But the Apoſtle doth condemne ſuch abuſe of Chriſtian libertie, becauſe it was offenſiue to the weake and vnlearned ſort of Chriſtians, which makes him to ſay in the 10. verſe of the 8. Chapter; for if any man ſee thee, which haſt knowledge, to lye at meate in the Idols Temples: ſhall not the conſcience of him which is weake, be enboldened or perſwaded to eate thoſe things which are offered to Idols?

                     , which ſignifieth to lie vpon a bed or Carpet, or any ſuch like thing, ſo that yee may ſee in S. Pauls time, the geſture of the body when they did eate or drinke at ſolemne feaſts in the Temples of the Idols, was in lying on beds or cuſhens, or the like, which was ſpread in the floore of the temples.
                  The cuſtome of the Iewes, before the Captiuitie of Babilon, was to eate the Eaſter Lambe ſtanding, as it is commanded in the 12. Chapter of Exodus. And in their religious feaſts they did ſit at Table as we doe: for we read in the firſt of Samuel, Chap. 20. verſe 5. that Dauid ſaith to Ionathan; Behold, tomorrow is the firſt day of the month, and I ſhould ſit with the King at meate; but let me goe, that I may hide my ſelfe in the fields. And in the 24. verſe. it is ſet downe, that when the firſt day of the Moneth came, the King ſate to eate meate. And in the 25. And the King ſate, as at other times, vpon his ſeate, euen vpon his ſeate by the wall, and Ionathan aroſe, and Abner ſate by Sauls ſide, but Dauids place was emptie.
                  
                  The word ſitting, in Hebrew is Iaſchab, which ſignifieth, ſitting on ſtooles or chaires; it ſignifieth alſo, the ſitting of Kings on their Thrones, Deut. 17. ver. 18. the Hebrew word that doth ſignifie a Stoole, ſeate, chaire, or Throne, is Moſchab, which doth come from the foreſaid Verbe, Iaſchab, as in the firſt verſe of the firſt Pſalme, that man is ſaid to be bleſſed, that ſitteth not in the ſeate or chaire of the ſcornfull.
                  The Hebrew word for lying is Scacab, which ſignifieth to lye, as in the ſecond of Samuel, Chap. 13. verſe 5. And Ionadab ſaid to Amon, lie downe on thy bed, and make thy ſelfe ſicke.
                  
                  The Hebrewes vſed another word, for to ſignifie the lying downe vpon the ground, which is Rabatz, as it is in the 49. of Geneſis, ver. 9. Iudah cubabit tanquam Leo, Iudah ſhall lye and couch like a Lion.
                  This word alſo ſignifieth the lying on the ground, as flockes of Sheepe doe in their folds. Ierem. 33. ver. 12:

                     There ſhall be dwelling for Shepheards to reſt their flocke: ſo, before the Captiuitie of Babilon, the Iewiſh cuſtome was to ſit at Table as we doe.
                  But in the time of Chriſts Natiuitie, they did no more vſe ſtanding at the celebration of the feaſt of the Eaſter Lambe, as it was preſcribed by Moſes, Exod. 12. but followed the cuſtome of the Gentiles, vnto whom they were Tributaries, both in their ordinarie feaſts and meetings at home, and in the feaſts of the eating of the Paſcall Lambe.
                  That this was their cuſtome in their ordinarie meales it is manifeſt; yea, before the Natiuitie of Chriſt: for in the ſecond Chapter of Marke, verſe 15. and in the fift of Luke, verſe 29. we read, that Leui the Publicane (who was Mathew) being called to follow Chriſt, made him a great feaſt in his owne houſe: in Marke verſe 15. the words are theſe, concerning the geſture of his body, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , when he did lie downe in Leuies houſe, many Publicanes and ſinners did lie downe with Ieſus. And in Luke the words are theſe: A multitude of Publicanes and others, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , were lying downe with them. And this is the ſelfe-ſame word, that S. Paul vſeth in the 1 Cor. Chap. 8. as is aboue ſignified, to ſignifie the lying in the feaſts celebrated, and in the Temples of the Idols.
                  Euen ſo the feaſt and ſupper of Herods birth-day: all thoſe that were at it, are called, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Mat. 14. Marke, 6. that is, all lying downe together.
                  
                  All thoſe that vnderſtand the Greeke tongue, know, that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſignifieth to lye downe, and not to ſit, in our manner.
                  The words of the three Euangeliſts, relating the Lords Supper, doe ſignifie lying downe, and not ſitting: for in the 26. of Mathew, verſe 19. it is ſaid, that the Diſciples that were ſent by Chriſt, did prepare, and make ready the Paſſeouer. In the 20. verſe, it is ſaid, that towards the euening, Chriſt 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which word,

                     Theodor. Beza, doth interprete, recubuit, hee did lye downe.
                  In the 14. Chapter of S. Marke, verſe 18. it is ſaid, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that they, to wit, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, aid lye downe at the table, and did eate.
                  
                  
                     Luke, Chap. 22. ver. 12. it is related, that the Maiſter of the houſe had prepared 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a Roome ſtrowed ouer for the Supper. And a little after, verſe 14. it is ſaid that when the houre was come, Chriſt 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which commeth from

                     , that ſignifieth in Latine, decido, in Engliſh,

                  In the 15. Chapter of S. Mathew, Chriſt vſeth the ſelfe ſame word, where hee ſpeaketh of the feeding of 4000. people with ſeauen loaues ſaying, that Chriſt commanded the multitude, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , to fall downe, or lye downe on the earth, which word is rehearſed alſo in the 8. Chapter of Marke.
                  
                  In the 13. Chapter of S. Iohns Euangell, verſe 4. it is ſaid of Chriſt, that hee did riſe from Supper: the Greeke word is, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , to riſe vp from the ground, the Latine is, reſurgere, which is applyed to the Reſurrection, 1 Cor. 15. verſe. 44. The body is ſowne a naturall body, and it is raiſed a ſpirituall body.
                  
                  In the fore-ſaid 13. Chapter of S. Iohn, it is ſaid, that after Chriſt had waſhed his Diſciples feete, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , lying, or falling downe againe, with his Diſciples, in the Supper before begunne, in the 23. verſe, it is ſaid, there was one of Ieſus Diſciples lying on Ieſus boſome, euen hee whom Ieſus loued. The Greeke word, which hee vſeth here, is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, a lying downe; the ſame which ye heard vſed before in Mathew and Marke.
                  
                  In all theſe places before cited, the Engliſh Tranſlation doth follow the vſe and cuſtome of England: for in the place of lying downe, (which is the true ſignification of the Greeke word) the Engliſh Tranſlation hath, ſitting, as yee may read in ſundry places, but eſpecially, in the 14. Chapter of S. Marke, ver. 18. The Engliſh Tranſlation

is, as they ſate at Table, although the Greeke word doth ſignifie to lye at Table. So that without any doubt, Chriſt in the celebration of the Eaſter Lambe, and of the Communion, did vſe the geſture of lying at Table, which was in vſe before his time, although the ſame geſture was then abuſed in the feaſts of the Heathens Idolatry, as is ſaid.
                  Further, this cuſtome of lying is expreſſed in the Ceremoniall Bookes of the Iewes; and namely, in that which is entituled, Orach Chaim, that is, The way of Life; where it is ſaid, that the Iewes did eate the Eaſter Lambe lying at, or about a Table.

                     Baal Baith, that is, the Maiſter of the houſe, after he had giuen thankes and bleſſed the Wine, hee beganne the Supper with a cup of wine, and after him, euery one about did emptie his cup, lying vpon their left ſide on Carpets or Cuſhens of ſilke, like ſome great Baron or noble man. After they haue eaten, the foreſaid Maiſter of the houſe doth eate of a thicke Cake, and doth diſtribute vnto the reſt ſome part of it, while they lye on their left ſide; and laſt of all, they end the whole action, with a third cup of wine, which is bleſſed, and ſo they giue thankes to God.
                  It is manifeſt by theſe teſtimonies, that the miſtaking of the proprietie and ſignification of the Greeke tongue, hath bred a great diuiſion, which is grounded vpon a double error. The firſt is an errour of the Hiſtory of the cuſtome obſerued in Chriſts time, inſomuch that many will not kneele, becauſe they are perſwaded that Chriſt did ſit and not kneele at the Communion.
                  Seeing therefore yee ſee it clearly proued, that Chriſt

and his Diſciples did not ſit, but lye, according to the cuſtome of the Iewes and Gentiles in his time; it is a great errour to hold that ſitting is neceſſarily to be obſerued in the holy Communion, and to abſtaine from it, vnleſſe it be performed in ſitting in our manner.
                  The other errour doth proceed from this, that men do enioyne neceſſitie to things which in their owne nature are indifferent: as to hold, that the geſture of the body which Chriſt did vſe in the inſtitution of the holy Supper is ſubſtantiall, and not indifferent: and therefore men ſurmiſing that Chriſt did ſit in our manner at his laſt Supper, that it is a ſubſtantiall thing to ſit at the Communion: and on the other part, that it is vnlawfull to kneele at the Communion, becauſe Chriſt and his Diſciples did not kneele at the firſt inſtitution of this holy action.
                  Chriſt did celebrate the Communion after Supper: now if we were bound to follow the geſture of the body which Chriſt did vſe, wee ſhould be alſo bound to the performing of this action after our Supper.
                  Moreouer, it is to be obſerued for our inſtruction, that Chriſt, in this action, did follow the geſture of the body, which was brought from the Gentiles to the Iewes, againſt the preſcript of Moſes Law, although it was abuſed before Chriſts Natiuitie, to the ſeruice of Idols.
                  This example of Chriſt doth much concerne vs: for as Chriſt did vſe the cuſtome of lying, receiued before his time, to draw the Iewes &amp; Gentiles to his Church, (notwithſtanding the abuſe of it in the Idols ſeruice) euen ſo, the holy Martyrs of the Church of England, who were Reformers of the ſame, did imitate Chriſt, in retaining that cuſtome of the geſture of the body, which was in vſe in the Popiſh Church, although it was abuſed to Idolatry, to draw the Papiſts from the Idolatrous kneeling, in the Adoration of the externall Sacrament to adore Chriſt himſelfe, in receiuing the holy Sacrament of his bleſſed body and bloud.
                  
                     
Now ſeeing it is manifeſtly proued, that Chriſt did neyther ſit nor ſtand in executing this holy action, there it no neceſſitie in ſtanding nor ſitting. And if there were any neceſſitie, to follow preciſely the forme that Chriſt vſed, wee ſhould all lye about a Table, ſet low on the ground, as Chriſt and his Diſciples did. And therefore no man can haue any likelihood of reaſon to abſtaine from the holy Communion, vnleſſe it be adminiſtred to them ſitting at a Table, or in ſeates, or in Pewes.
               
            
            
               
               The third THESE.
               THE Apoſtles, and Chriſts Church founded by them, did vſe to celebrate a publike feaſt in their Aſſemblies, which was called Agape, or the Feaſt of Charitie: becauſe in it, the poore were relieued by the rich: after the which, their cuſtome was to celebrate the Lords Supper, all lying on Carpets, Cuſhens, or the like, as Chriſt did: which cuſtome continued in many places, many hundred yeeres, but the Catholike Church did change this cuſtome both of lying and eating after Supper: which change is allowed of by thoſe, who in our time haue brought in the geſture of ſitting at table in receiuing the Communion. And therefore, there is no reaſon, but they ſhould as well allow of the change of lying into kneeling.
               
                  
                  The Proofes and Teſtimonies of the third THESE.
                  
                     WEe reade in the ſixt of the Acts, verſe 7. that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a great multitude of the Prieſts receiued the Faith, and in the 21. Chapter, verſe 20. Iames the Biſhop of Ieruſalem, and the Preſbyters or Elders, did enforme S. Paul, that many Myriades, that is, a very great multitude of the Iewes had receiued the faith, which were all zealous obſeruers of the Law: whereof wee collect, that they did retaine Circumciſion, and the celebration of the Iewiſh Paſſeouer, together with Baptiſme and the holy Communion, after that ſame kinde of geſture of accubation as Chriſt himſelfe did: which wee haue proued before in the ſecond These.
                  
                  To this purpoſe doth agree that which is written in the Acts of the Apoſtles, Chap. 2. verſe 42. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that the faithfull, aſſiduè operam dabant; did continually trauell in the doctrine of the Apoſtles, and in the Communion and breaking of bread, and prayers. And in the 46. verſe of the ſaid Chapter, it is ſaid, that they continued daily in one accord in the Temple, and breaking of bread from houſe to houſe; and did eate their meate together with gladneſſe: Whereof we may eaſily gather, that they did aſſiſt in the Temple to the Ceremonies of the Law, but in their priuate houſes they did daily celebrate the Communion at their ordinary feaſts, which they could not performe publikely, by reaſon of the perſecution of the Sinagogue. So that without all doubt, the geſture of their bodyes in all their publike meales was conforme to the cuſtome of the Iewes, which was accubatio, a lying downe.
                  
                     
Alſo the Gentiles, that were conuerted, did celebrate the feaſt of Agape, and after it the holy Communion, obſeruing the geſture of accubation, as ſhall hereafter be ſufficiently (God willing) proued.
                  S. Paul did reproue the Corinthians, becauſe they did not lawfully obſerue the firſt inſtitution of theſe publike feaſts, in communicating together, the rich relieuing the poore: His words are theſe; When yee come together 
                     1 Cor. 11. 20. 21 
                     therefore into one place, this is not to eate the Lords Supper: for euery man when they ſhould eate, taketh his owne ſupper afore: and one is hungry, and another is drunke. So that yee ſee the abuſe of this feaſting was, that they did not follow the firſt inſtitution; in making their meat and drinke common to all equall: but did conuert publike eating to priuate vſe: the rich men eating apart by themſelues, and the poore by themſelues. Therefore the Apoſtle commands them in the end of the Chapter, that when they come to eate, they tarry one for another.
                  S. Peter in his ſecond Epiſtle, Chap. 2. verſe 13. diſclaimeth againſt falſe Chriſtians, which did ſeeke nothing in their publike feaſts, but the ſatisfaction of their owne bellyes: the word which Peter vſeth is, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which ſignifyeth to make a publike feaſt in a common ſocietie.
                  The Apoſtle Iude, in the 12. verſe of his Epiſtle, ſpeaking of them that abuſed theſe feaſts which were dedicated to an holy vſe, to their owne pleaſures, ſaith; Theſe are like ſpots in your feaſts of Charitie, when they feaſt with you, without all feare, feeding themſelues: theſe feaſts are called here by the name of Agapae, which ſignifieth a Feaſt of Charitie or loue. Theodor. Beza doth retaine the ſame word in his Latine Tranſlation: Hae ſunt in Agapis veſtris, maculae, dum vobiſcum conuiuantur, abſ
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         vllius metu, ſcipſos paſcentes: where hee doth note, that Agapae erant

                     ſraterna ac eccleſiaſtici coetus conuiuia, quae deſcribuntur a Tertulliano in Apologetico, that theſe were

the publike feaſts in their Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies, which are deſcribed by Tertullian in his Apologeticke: which is a Booke written in defence of Chriſtians, againſt the Gentiles. In the end of theſe feaſts the Communion was celebrated as Chriſt did after Supper.
                  It is mentioned in the Actes of the Apoſtles Chap. 6. verſe 2. that the Apoſtle called the multitude together, and ſaid; It is not meete that wee ſhould leaue the word of God and ſerue the Tables. Theſe Tables are the publike feaſts, mentioned in the ſecond Chapter of the ſaid Booke, verſe 46. In the which, the holy Communion is called the breaking of bread. Without all doubt, in theſe publike feaſts, the Apoſtles and the ſaithfull, did celebrate the Communion in the ſelfe ſame manner and geſture of body, which Chriſt did inſtitute, which was, as is proued in the ſecond Theſe, the geſture of accubation.

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Ignatius his words are theſe; It is not lawfull to baptiſe without the Biſhop, nor to offer oblations, nor to bring any Sacrifices, nor to celebrate the feaſt called, 
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     : where marke by the way, that in the falſe Popiſh Tranſlation it is Moſſas celebrare: from the which, the Papiſts doe pretend to proue the antiquitie of their Maſſe.
                  
                     Hyeronimus Vairlenius Siluius, of the Romiſh profeſſion in the notes of his Tranſlation of Ignatius Epiſtles, Printed at Antwerpe, by Plantinus, who had permiſſion to print the ſame, from the Spaniſh King, and is approued

by thoſe of the Inquiſition, ſaith after this manner; reliquimus hic vocem Graecam, quae conuiuium ſignificat, Latinè ſic dictum ab accipiendo, quòd omnes promiſcuè acciperentur: videtur autem id conuiuium idem fuiſſe cum eo, quod Tertullianus in Apologetico ſuo Agapen ſuo ſeculo appellatum ſcribit, quamuis &amp; beatus Iudas in Epiſtola ſua cadem voce Agape vſus ſit pro conuiuio eiuſmodi.

And therefore the foreſaid vulgar Tranſlation of the ſaid teſtimony is falſe.

                      the ſecond Preſident of Bithynia, vnder the Emperour Traiane, which was an hundred yeeres after Chriſt writeth to the Emperour, that hee had examined ſundry Chriſtians, as hee had commanded him; and that hee had learned of them that they were accuſtomed, at an appointed day, to meete together before day-light: and to ſay one after another, a Song or Rhime to Chriſt as to God, and to binde themſelues by a Sacrament, or holy promiſe, not to commit any villany; but eſpecially, not theft, not robbery, not adultery, not to breake their promiſe, that being required, they ſhould not detaine any thing that was committed to their cuſtodie. And after this, their cuſtome was to depart, and afterwards to aſſemble together to their common Feaſts, which were without any harme. Where wee obſerue beſide our purpoſe, that the firſt Chriſtinas did ſing their Songs, one anſwering to another, which forme is followed in the Seruice-Booke of England.
                  The publike feaſts performed in the Aſſemblies of the Chriſtians, were the ſame which we called before Agape; and vnder the name of cibus promiſcuus is contained the celebration of the holy Communion; which, in that age, was executed euery day in the Chriſtian Aſſemblies.
                  To this purpoſe doth the teſtimonie of Tertullian ſerue; who liued an hundred yeeres after Saint Iohn, who doth

relate many ancient cuſtomes, which were obſerued in the Church: and amongſt other, ſpeaking of the holy Communion, hee ſaith; Tertul. de corona militis. Euchariſtiae Sacramentū in tempore victus, in omnibus mandatum à Domino, etiam antelucanis caetibus, nec de aliorum manu, quàm de Praeſidentium ſumimus.
                      
                     We Chriſtians doe receiue from the hands of our Preſidents and Rulers, the Sacrament of the Euchariſt in the time of our meales; in all things being commanded by the Lord, yea, and alſo in our Aſſemblies, before the day breaking.
                  
                  The ſaid Tertullian, in deſcribing the forme of the publicke feaſts of Chriſtians after the which they did celebrate their holy Communion, calleth the place in which they did celebrate the ſame, Triclinium, which ſignifieth a Parlour, or Supping roome; in which three beds were ſpread to lye vpon, round about a Table, which was ſet low, as wee haue proued heretofore in the ſecond Theſe. Euen ſo, the word, diſcumbere, which Tertullian vſeth, ſignifieth to lie at Table, on Cuſhens, Carpets, or the like, ſpread vpon the ground, as is ſaid.

Ere wee lye downe at Table, wee firſt ſay our prayers, the hungry doe eate as much as may ſatisfie them, and the thirſty doe drinke ſo much as is profitable for temperate men: they are but ſo ſatisfied with food, as that in the
                     
                     night, they may remember they muſt worſhip God. They talke ſo as if they knew the Lord heard them: after the waſhing of their hands, and the lighting of candles, euery one is prouoked to ſing a Song vnto God, eyther out of the holy Scriptures, or of their owne inuention.
                  
                  In the end of this publike feaſt, the cuſtome was, to celebrate the Communion: for Tertul. de corona militis Euchariſtiae Sacramentū in tempore victus ſumimus.
                      
                     Tertullian in his booke De corona militis, as is ſaid, beareth witneſſe, that the Chriſtians did receiue the Sacrament in the time of their meales, meaning of the publike meales, becauſe the Communion, was euery day celebrated in all publike aſſemblies in that age.

Hist. lib. 3. cap. 14. doth relate the forme of the ſolemne feaſts, which were ſolemnized by Iulias to Ap lio Daphnaeus: where hee ſaith, that the Sonne of the heatheniſh Prieſt, in the firſt day of the feaſt, which continued ſeauen dayes, did vſe ſprinkling of conſecrated water to the Idoll, which vvas called aqua 
                           •
                        uſtralis, by the which the feaſt was dedicated to the ſaid Idoll: where wee obſerue, beſide our purpoſe that the Popiſh Holy-water comes from this Heatheniſh ceremonie.
                  That the geſture of Accubation vvas vſed in this Feaſt, it is cleare by the vvords of 
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                     Theodoretus: where hee ſaith, that in the firſt day of this Feaſt, the Prieſts Sonne, ſtanding nigh the Emperours bed, did ſprinckle ouer all the meate, with this Holy-water.
                  Out of which wee may ſee plainely, that the Emperour lay on a bed at this Solemne Feaſt, according to the ancient cuſtome of the Greekes, and Romanes, before Chriſts Natiuitie, and ſince.
                  
                     
Theſe publike Feaſts beganne to be abuſed in Saint Pauls time: ſo the abuſe did continue till a Nationall Councill (holden at Laodicaea, Anno Domini, 368) did forbid theſe publike banquets and feaſts to be ſolemnized in the Church, as is expreſſed in the 28. Canon of that Councill, in theſe words following: 
                        Concil. Loadic. Can. 28. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     It is not lawfull to make Feaſts, called Agapae, in the Lords houſes or Aſſemblies, or to eate in the houſe of God, and ſpread Carpets or any ſuch like thing, for to lye vpon, to wit, at the ſaid Feaſt.
                  
                  The words of the ſelfe-ſame Canon are repeated in the ſixt generall Councill, holden in Conſtantinople, in the Pallace called Trullus, which Councill was holden vnder the Emperour Iuſtinian, Anno Domini, 555.

                  This Agapae was alſo called Caena Dominica, as Renanus doth note vpon Tertulisans Booke de corona militis: whoſe words are theſe: Ren. in Tert. de corona militis.

                     It is very likely, that the Chriſtians did celebrate together a Feaſt in the Temple vpon the day of the Lords Supper, whereof there are ſome ſignes left with vs: for Tertullian writing to his wife, who making mention of a Heathen, who had a Chriſtian to his wife, ſaith after this manner; Which of the Gentiles will endure ſecurely, that his wife aſſiſt all the night long to the ſolemnitie of the Eaſter? or which of the Gentiles without ſuſpition, would giue his wife leaue to aſſiſt to the Lords Feaſt, which they haue in great infamie? &amp;c.
                  
                  Theſe words, conuiuium Dominicum in this testimony,

and the words Sacramentum Euchariſtiae tempore victus ſumimus, heretofore cited; and the deſcription of the Supper called Agape, being conferred one with another, doth ſhew that the Communion was, in that age, celebrated after the ſaid Supper, as Chriſt himſelfe did: ſo that the Chriſtians in the time of Tertullian, did retaine eating and drinking at the Communion in a common ſocietie, according to S. Pauls commandement; Wherefore

                  The ordinary cuſtome to celebrate the Communion after Supper, was changed about the end of the firſt foure hundred yeeres after Chriſt, and was conuerted into a publike feaſt, called Caena Dominica, the Lords Supper.

                  About the ſelfe-ſame time there was a Councill aſſembled of all Africke, in the which Saint Auguſtine was preſent, vvho ſubſcribed to the Canons made therein.

By this Canon it is euident, that in that age, which was Centuria 5. after Chriſt, that there was a yeerely and ſolemne Supper of the Lord celebrated in the forme and manner, and in the ſelfe-ſame time of the day, that Chriſt did inſtitute this holy Communion: ſo that in this day they did celebrate the Communion, not faſting, but after their publike Supper.

                     , who did liue about 900. yeeres after Chriſt, teſtifieth that then the houre or time of the celebration of the Maſſe, (which was in his time as hath

beene already ſaid, the Communion; wherein the Clergie and the people did all eate and drinke together) was diuers, according to the diuerſitie of ſolemne dayes: and that it was ſometimes celebrated in the morning, and ſometimes at nine of the clocke, ſometimes in the euening, and ſometimes in the night.
                  But in the ages following, the whole ancient forme of the Church-Seruice began by little and little to be aboliſhed by the Popes, who did change the yeerely feaſt of the Lords Supper, heretofore mentioned in the African Councill, and in place of this holy action; the Popes did inſtitute the waſhing of the poores feete (which cuſtome is vnto this day obſerued, by Emperours, Kings, Popes, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Abbots) adding thereto a diſtribution of Almes to the poore.
               
            
            
               
               The fourth THESE.
               ACcording to the Analogie of the Scriptures, kneeling is the moſt conuenient geſture that is to be vſed in our Inuocations, or Prayers, before, and in the receiuing of the holy Communion, in the which Prayers, the geſture of kneeling was vſed in the old Maſſe, which was agreeable to our Communion, and was not an Idolatrous Inſtitution. And therefore the Reformers of the Church of England, haue done well to reſtore the kneeling to the originall vſe againe.
               
                  The Teſtimonies and Proofes of the third THESE.
                  
                     THe geſture of ſtanding was vſed by the Prieſts of the Law in ſome caſes, as Deut. Chap. 4. ver. 20 it is ſaid, the Lord ſeparated the Tribe of Leui, to beare Deut. 4. 10. the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord, and to ſtand before the Lord, to miniſter vnto him, and to bleſſe in his Name vnto this day: ſo that the Prieſt did ſtand in offering Sacrifices.
                  The ſolemne bleſſings were pronounced ſtanding: Thou ſhalt ſtand vpon mount Gerizzim, to bleſſe the people when yee ſhall paſſe ouer Iordan. 
                     Deut. 27. 12.
                  
                  In Inuocations and prayers there is a threefold kinde of geſture, expreſſed by Dauid: the firſt is a falling downe Pſal. 95. 6, or proſterning of the body: the ſecond is, according to

the Hebrew word, a bowing downe of the head to the ground. The third is kneeling.
                  
                     Salomon, at the ſolemnitie of the dedication of the Temple, in his ſolemne Prayer, hee is ſaid to vſe the geſture of kneeling. The words are theſe: He kneeled downe vpon 
                     2 Chron. 6. 13. 
                     his knees before all the Congregation of Iſrael, and ſtretched out his hands toward Iſrael; but hee ſtood when hee bleſſed the people. 1 Kings 8. 55.
                  
                  In the new Teſtament Chriſt doth reproue the Hypocrites, who (as the words of the Text doe beare) did loue Mat. 6. 5. to ſtand in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreetes to pray.
                  Alſo the Publicane is ſaid to ſtand a farre off when hee Luke 18. 13. 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . did pray.
                  And in Marke; when yee ſhall ſtand to pray, forgiue, &amp;c. 
                     Marke 11. 25.
                  
                  The geſture of ſtanding, is meant of the ſtanding in the Temple, to heare the bleſſing ordained by the Law, and to put vp their Prayers of Thankeſgiuing, according to the Law heretofore mentioned: for when Chriſt did ſpeake ſo, hee and his Diſciples did obſerue the Law: but Chriſt himſelfe, a little after the inſtitution of the holy Communion, did goe apart from his Diſciples, and as man, apprehending the cruell torments which he was to ſuffer for the ſinnes of mankinde, hee beganne to waxe 
                     Mat. 26. 37. 38. 
                     ſorrowfull, and to be grieuouſly troubled: ſaying; my Soule is very heauy, euen vnto the death, and hee fell downe on his face and prayed. In Marke it is ſaid; hee fell downe to the 
                     Marke 14. 35. 
                     ground and prayed. In Luke it is ſaid, that he kneeled downe 
                     Luke 22. 41. 
                     and prayed.
                  
                  The word vſed by Mathew is the ſelfe-ſame which Luke vſeth to expreſſe the geſture that Chriſt had when hee inſtituted the holy Communion, where it is ſaid: When the houre was come, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , he fell downe. 
                     Cap. 22. 14.
                  
                  By theſe diuers words of the Euangelists, the one vſing the word of Kneeling, and the other of falling downe, we learne that both kneeling and falling downe, are agreeable to Chriſts geſture.
                  
                     
Chriſt exhorteth his Diſciples often to pray, and teacheth them the forme of prayer, which we call the Lords Mat. 6. 9. Luke 11. Prayer: but hee doth not preſcribe any particular geſture of the body to be vſed when we pray, ſo that he did leaue the geſture to be obſerued according to the order and cuſtome of the Church.
                  Wee are commanded by Saint Paul to examine our 1 Cor. 11. 27. 28 29. ſelues before wee participate the Lords Supper: for if we doe not ſo, we are guiltie of Chriſts death, and wee eate our owne condemnation.
                  This examination of our ſelues conſiſts in the confeſſion of our ſinnes, and ſorrow of our hearts, with a deſire to abſtaine from them, with humble prayers to God the Father through Chriſt Ieſus, that he would grant vs true Repentance, and his grace to abſtaine from our ſins, that his holy Communion may be vnto vs, an Antidote and medicine to purge vs of all the ſpirituall poyſon of ſinne and corruption, that wee be not guilty of Chriſts death, and that we eate not vnworthily to our owne condemnation.
                  Seeing that in all this tryall of our ſelues before the Communion, prayers and repentance is to be vſed: and the geſture of prayer is kneeling, as wee haue already proued by Chriſts example, it followeth, that the geſture of kneeling is the moſt conuenient and agreeable to Chriſts owne geſture.
                  This geſture of kneeling in prayers continued in the Apoſtles time: for the holy Martyr S. Steuen being to Acts 7. 60. receiue (according to the interpretation of his name) the crowne of Martyrdome, in yeeelding vp the Ghoſt, hee did pray kneeling. When S. Peter did raiſe the Widdow Cap. 9, ver 40. 
                     Tabitha from death, he did pray kneeling. S. Paul after a long exhortation to the Church of the Epheſians, taking Chap 20. v. 36. his laſt leaue of them made them pray with him kneeling: ſo did he in taking his leaue of the Church of Tyrus. &amp; Chap. 21 v. 5 
                           •
                         Kings 19 10. Rom. 11. 4.
                  
                  Kneeling is taken often in the Scriptures for the worſhip of God: and S. Paul to the Romanes by the bowing

of the knee to Baal, doth vnderſtand the worſhipping of Baal. And to the Philippians, it is ſaid, that all knees ſhall Philip. 2. 10. bowe to the name of Ieſus, that is, ſhall worſhip Ieſus, as a true God.
                  The celebration of the Communion is the moſt notable action of our Chriſtian Religion: for, in it the effect of all other things is applyed to vs, and therein is repreſented Gods bleſſings, as the preaching of the Goſpell, prayers, inuocations, thankeſgiuings; and laſtly, the very death of Chriſt therein is repreſented, which doth worke in vs, by the participation of this holy Communion. Therefore ſeeing kneeling in the Scripture ſignifieth the worſhip of God, it followeth that it is the moſt conuenient geſture of our body, which is to be vſed in this holy action.
                  The geſture of ſtanding in the time of prayer, all the dayes betweene Eaſter and Penticoſt, and in all the Sundayes of the yeere, did beginne in the Primatiue Church in the commemoration of Chriſts Reſurrection. The firſt mention that we read thereof is in Tertul. lib. de coron. milit. Die Dominico ie iunare nefas eſſe ducimus, vel de geniculis adorare.
                      
                     Tertullian, who doth relate it to be an ancient cuſtome, his words are theſe: Wee eſteeme it an unlawfull thing to faſt on Sunday; or to pray in kneeling.
                  
                  
                     Beatus Renanus 
                     Beat. Ren. in annot. in Tertullianum. Geniculari in adorande velut penitentis eſt, qui ſtans adorat, iam veniam conſequutus gratias agit.
                     , in his notes vpon theſe words, ſaith; it appertaineth to a penitent man to pray on his knees, but hee that prayeth ſtanding, giueth thankes, as hauing obtained forgiueneſſe.

                     , diſciple to Tertullian, ſaith; Beloued brethren, when we ſtand at prayer, we ſhould be awaked, and with all our hearts bend our ſelues in our prayers towards God.
                  
                  Wherefore wee may gather that ſtanding was then in vſe, partly, for to auoid ſleeping, becauſe the Chriſtians made their aſſemblies in the night, during the time of their great perſecutions.
                  This cuſtome was long after continued: for the 20.

                  This cuſtome was in Hieromes dayes, who relates it among the Traditions of the Church: and Hierom. aduer. Lucifer. 
                     Auſtine giueth a reaſon of it, in theſe words following: In the dayes of Pentecoſt (that is, the fiftie dayes betweene Eaſter and Whitſunday) which are celebrated after the Reſurrection, are now a figure, not of labour, but of reſt and ioy: and for this cauſe, in theſe dayes wee vſe no faſting, and wee pray ſtanding, which is a ſigne of the Reſurrection. Of this it comes to paſſe, that the ſame cuſtome is obſerued all the Sundayes in the yeere, at the Altar.
                  
                  The geſture of kneeling was not abuſed in the olde Maſſe, for to adore the Sacrament, as the Papiſts erroniouſly doe in our age: but when the Prieſt and the people Auguſt. Epiſt. 119. ad Ian. cap. 15. De diebus Pentecoſtes, quae celebrantur poſt reſurrectionē, i am figura non labori

                            id obſeruatur.
                      did receiue the conſecrated bread and wine, which was diſtributed amongſt all them that were there preſent to communicate; then they kneeled downe and did pray to God, according to the forme of Prayer expreſſed in in the Booke, De diuinis officijs Miſſae, which is Printed at Paris, Anno Dom. 1610. the which prayer is in our Engliſh Communion Booke.
                  
                     Auguſtine doth not expreſſe the forme of this prayer,

only he ſaith, Aug. Tom. 2. Epiſt. 59. queſt. 5 ad Paulinum. Precationes accipimus dictas, quas facimus in celebratione Sacramentorū, antequā illud quod eſt in Domini mē
                           ſa incipiat benedici: orationes cum benedicitur, &amp; ſanctificatur, &amp; ad diſtribuendū comminuitur, quam totam petitionem fere omnis Eccleſia dominica oratione concludit.
                      
                     We take, (the words of S. Paul. 1 Tim. 2. 2) precations or ſupplications, to be thoſe which wee make in the celebration of the Sacraments, before that which is on the Lords Table be bleſſed, and oration and prayers to be when it (to wit, the bread) is bleſſed and ſanctified, and broken in pieces to be diſtributed, all the which Petitions the whole Church doth conclude with the Lords Prayer.
                  
                  They that doe refuſe to kneele at the Communion, doe not refuſe kneeling in the Lords Prayer, which is ſaid in the Communion, and therefore I ſee no reaſon why they ſhould refuſe the one, and embrace the other.
                  The forme of the celebration of the old Maſſe, vvas called before Carolus Magnus time, and in his time, Ordo Romanus, the which is publiſhed in ſundry manners in the fore-ſaid Booke De diuinis Officijs, together with Rabanus Maurus, Amalarius Walafridus, who did liue Anno Dom. 855. and haue all written the forme, order, and manner of the old Maſſe, they doe expreſſe the ſtanding in a great part of that holy action, but they make no mention of the Prayer vſed before the actuall receiuing of the Communion.
                  
                     Iohannes Micrologus

                     , who did write in the time of Gregory the ſeauenth, as hee himſelfe teſtifieth in the ſeauenteenth Chap. De officijs Miſſae, which was anno Dom. 1080. doth expreſſe the ſaid Prayer performed in kneeling, in the 18. Chapter, where hee ſaith, that after the breaking of the bread all ſhould communicate, that the Prayer which wee doe ſay kneeling, before wee take the Communion, we haue it not from the Romane order, but from ſome religious Tradition. Of the which Prayer Micrologus hath onely the beginning, but Rodolphus de rino, Decanus, who did liue 1400. yeeres after Chriſt, doth Rodolphus de rino de Canon obſeruantia repetit verba Micrologi, &amp; hanc precationem integrā habet his verbis: Domino Ieſu
                      expreſſe this holy prayer: his words are the ſelfe-ſame which Micrologus hath, that is: Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who by the will of the Father, and cooperation of the holy Ghoſt, haſt reſtored to life, by thine owne death, the world, deliuer me from all my iniquities and tranſgreſſions, through this thy holy
                     
                     body and bloud, and make me to cleaue faſt to thy Commandements, 
                     Chriſte, qui ex voiuntate Patris cooperāte Spiritu ſancto, per mortē propriam mundū viuificaſti, liberae me per hoc ſacroſanctum corpus, et ſanguinem tuum ab omnibus iniquitatibus &amp; malis meis, &amp; fac me tuis inhaerere mandatis, et à te nunquam in perpetuum ſeperari, qui cum Patre, &amp;c. 
                     and neuer to depart from thee, who liueſt and raigneſt, &amp;c. And when hee doth diſtribute the Euchariſt, he ſaith; the body and bloud of our Lord Ieſu Chriſt may profit thee to eternall life, Amen. All ought to communicate, and in the meane while an Antheme, which borrowed the name from the Communion, is ſung.
                  By theſe laſt teſtimonies euery man may learne two things: the one is, that the old Maſſe in Micrologus and Rodolphus time, was altogether like vnto the Communion of the Church of England, and therefore that the new Romane Maſſe, wherein there is no Communion, is not the true, but a falſe ſuppoſed Maſſe, newly inuented by the Gray-Fryers, as (God-willing) we are amplie to proue by a Treatiſe vpon the ſaid matter. The other point is, that wee learne by the laſt teſtimonie, that kneeling Cum diſtribuit Euchariſtiā dicit: Corpus &amp; Sanguis Domino noſtri Ieſu Chriſti proficiat tibi in vitam aeternā, Amen. at the receiuing of the Communion did beginne with the ſaid forme of Prayer, the which is an inuocation of Chriſt, and not an inuocation of the hoſt of the Maſſe, which is an abhominable Idolatry, &amp; therefore the Biſhops and holy Martyrs of the church of England, in reforming of the Popiſh Idolatry of the new Maſſe, did reſtore the true old Maſſe, which is our Communion, and did well to Omnes debent cō
                        municare, &amp; interim cantatur Antiphora quae de Communione nomē mutuauit. Eaaē forma precationis habetur in Canone Miſſae, inſerto Miſſali, ſecundum vſum Sarum. retaine the geſture of kneeling, as it was in the old Maſſe of the Communion, and although the Papiſts doe abuſe kneeling in the Idolatrous adoration of the Sacrament, it was lawfully reſtored to the inuocation of God by Chriſt, in the receiuing of the Communion, euen as Chriſt himſelfe, and his Apoſtles, and the Chriſtians in the primatiue Church did vſe, it is alſo manifeſt, as well by the teſtimonies of the firſt Theſe, as by this, that neyther Prayer nor the Communion, nor any other religious Action was performed in ſitting after the manner of our Country. Wherefore they that refuſe to receiue the Communion, vnleſſe they receiue it ſitting, haue no warrant, neyther by the example of Chriſt, nor by his Apoſtles, nor by the Primatiue Church.
