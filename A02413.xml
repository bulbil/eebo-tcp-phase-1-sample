            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            The Country-mans new care away.
To the tune of, Loue will find out the way.
            
               
            
            
               IF there were imployments
               for men, as haue béene,
               And Drummes, Pikes, and Muskets
               inth' field to be séene,
               And euery worthy Souldier
               had truely their pay,
               Then might they be bolder,
               to sing, Care away.
            
            
               If there were no Rooking,
               but plaine dealing vsed,
               If honest Religion
               were no wayes abused,
               If pride in the Country
               did not beare sway,
               The poore, and the Gentry
               might sing, Care away.
            
            
               If Farmers consider'd
               the dearenesse of graine,
               How honest poore Tradesmen
               their charge should maintaine,
               And would b
                     •
                  te the price on't
               to sing, Care away.
               We should not be nice on't,
               of what we did pay.
            
            
               Af poore Tenants Land-lords,
               would not racke their rents,
               Which oft is the cause of
               their great discontents:
               If againe good house kéeping
               inth' Land did heare sway,
               The poore that sits wéeping,
               might sing, Care away.
            
            
               If to liue vprightly
               all men were concurring,
               If Lawyers with Clients
               would vse no demurring,
               But kindly would vse them,
               for what they did pay;
               They néed not sit musing,
               but sing, Care away.
            
            
               If Spendthrifts were carefull
               and would leaue their follies,
               Ebriety hating,
               Cards, Dice, Bowling-Alleyes,
               Or with wantons to dally
               by night or by day,
               Their wiues might be merry,
               and sing, Care away.
            
         
         
            
            The second part. To the same tune.
            
               
            
            
               IF Children to Parents,
               would dutifull be,
               If Seruants with Masters;
               would deale faithfully,
               If Gallants poore Tradesmen
               would honestly pay,
               Then might they haue comfort,
               to sing, Care away.
            
            
               There is no contentment,
               to a conscience thats cleare,
               That man is most wretched,
               a bad mind doth beare,
               To wrong his poore Neighbour,
               by night or by day,
               He wants the true comfort
               to sing, Care away.
            
            
               But he that is ready,
               by goodnesse to labour,
               In what he is able
               to helps is poore Neighbour,
               The Lord will euer blesse him
               by night and by day,
               All ioyes shall possesse him
               to sing, Care away.
            
            
               Would wiues with their husbands,
               and husbands with wiue,
               In loue and true friendship
               would so lead their liues,
               As best might be pleasing,
               to God night and day,
               Then they with hearts easing,
               might sing, Care away.
            
            
               No crosse can be greater,
               vnto a goodmind,
               Than a man to be matched
               with a woman vnkind,
               Whose tongue is never quiet,
               but scolds night and day,
               That man wants the comfort
               to sing, Care away.
            
            
               A vertuous woman
               a husband that hath,
               That's giuen vnto lewdnesse,
               to enuy and wrath,
               Who after wicked women,
               does hunt for his prey,
               That woman wants comfort,
               to sing, Care away.
            
            
               Were there no resorting,
               to houses of vice,
               Or were there no courting
               a wench that is nice,
               Yet ere she will refuse it,
               the wanton will play,
               Poore men might be merry,
               and sing, Care away.
            
            
               Like true subiects loyall,
               to God let vs pray,
               Our good King so Royall,
               to preserue night and day:
               With the Quéen, Prince and Nobles,
               the Lord blesse them aye:
               Then may we all haue comfort,
               to sing, Care away.
