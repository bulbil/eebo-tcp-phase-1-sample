            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  A SERMON Preached at S. Pauls-Croſſe on 
                        Trinity Sunday. 1632.
                  
                  
                     2 CHRON. 26. 5.
                     So long as hee ſought the Lord, God made him to proſper.
                  
                  
                     THeſe words containe the proſperous and ſuccesfull eeſtate of King Vzziah, during all the time that he ſerved and ſought the Lord; but as ſoone as ever hee fell foule with his God, hee fell downe from his happineſſe, and his proſperity went away with his pietie: juſt as you ſee your comets and Meteors that hang in the ayre, ſo long as they keep aloft in the firmament of heaven they gliſter &amp; ſhin, and make a glorious celeſtial luſtre in the eyes of all beholders, but if once they decline from that pitch

and fall downe to the earth (as many times they doe) they vaniſh, and diſ-appeare, and come to nothing. Such is the caſe betwixt a man and his God; as long as a man holds in good termes with God, and hath his converſation in heaven, and ſets his affections upon things above, ſo long God will caſt his favour upon him, and he ſhall ſhine as a light in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation; but if once he decline from that pitch, and fall downe from a godly converſation, into any earthly, baſe, ungodly diſpoſition, tis a venture but his proſperity will vaniſh away, and his latter end prove worſe than his beginning. Here then is a worthy preſident for all that doe deſire to proſper; as I ſuppoſe tis every mans deſire ſo to doe, as one ſaid, Beatus vult homo eſſe, etiam non ſic vivendo ut poſsit eſſe; Every man would be bleſſed, though he take a courſe to be curſed, every man would goe to heaven, though he run the way that leads directly to hell; ſo every man would proſper, though hee take a courſe to periſh; but if a man doth deſire true proſperity, that God indeed ſhould proſper him, and give a bleſſing to all that belongs unto him, let him take the courſe that Vzziah ſometime did, let him ſeeke the Lord, and God will make him to proſper. So long as he ſought the Lord, God made him to proſper.
                  
                  In which words are two generall things to be obſerved;
                  1. The ground and foundation of true proſperity.
                  2. The bounds and limitation of it.
                  Firſt, the ground and foundation of true proſperity, and that is this; It muſt be built and raiſed

upon Religion and Pietie, God muſt be ſought unto, ere true proſperity can be attain'd to (He ſought the Lord, and God made him to proſper.)
                  
                  Secondly, the bounds and limitation of proſperity, how farre it reacheth, and how long it laſteth, and that is, onely during the time that he ſerves and ſeeks the Lord, [So long as he ſought the Lord, ſo long (and no longer) God made him to proſper.]
                  
                  In the firſt obſerve two particulars, Mans dutie, and Gods mercy; Firſt, mans duty to ſeeke God; Secondly, Gods mercy to proſper them that ſeeke him. Now becauſe the whole hope of our proſperitie, and Gods ſucceſſe, depends onely upon our piety in ſeeking of God, I will therefore branch it out into foure circumſtances, which like the foure Rivers of Eden, ſhall (I truſt) water this Garden-plot of God, and make your ſoules proſper the better.
                  1. What it is to ſeeke God.
                  2. How, and in what manner we muſt ſeeke him.
                  3. When, or what time.
                  4. Where, or in what place we muſt ſeeke him; I meane ſo, as that wee may proſper by ſeeking him, for that is the baſis, the ground-worke of my whole Sermon, and ſhall (by Gods aſſiſtance) be intermingled, and interwoven into every point.
                  Firſt, what it is to ſeeke God, ſo as a man may proſper by ſeeking him. To ſeeke God is nothing elſe but to ſeeke to pleaſe God, to ſeeke to get into favour with God, to ſeeke to get Gods good-will; as the Sidonians did with Herod, Act. 12. 20. when they heard that Herod was diſpleaſed with them, and intended to make warre upon them, they made

friendſhip with Blastus the Kings Chamberlaine, and ſought by all meanes poſſible to get into favour with him againe; and why? Becauſe (ſaid they) our lands are nouriſhed by the lands of the King. This is our caſe, our lands, our lives, and all that wee have are nouriſhed and ſuſtained by the King of heaven; and therefore when wee know that he is diſpleaſed with us, as juſtly hee may (for as David ſaith) Wee provoke him every day, then let us doe as they did, as they made friendſhip with Blaſtus, ſo let us make friendſhip with Ieſus Chriſt, and deſire him to helpe us into Gods favour: And this is that we call the ſeeking of God. Now this phraiſe of ſeeking God, implies that we are at a loſſe in this behalfe; and indeed ſo we are; we have all of us loſt the favour of God by our ſinnes, and except wee ſeeke to regaine and recover it by our prayers and repentance, wee muſt never look to proſper. Not proſper, may ſome ſay? Why, who proſper more many times than they that have leaſt care, and make leaſt conſcience to ſerve and ſeeke the Lord, they that live altogether by uſury and oppreſſion, by bribery and extortion, by fraud and ill dealing, that have not God in all their thoughts, who proſper more than they? I anſwer to that, and I hope I ſhall make it appeare, that a man that ſeekes not God may thrive in the world, grow rich, and gather goods, and yet not proſper neither. Wealth is one thing, proſperity another. A man never truely proſpers till hee come to have Gaius his proſperity, whereof you ſhall read in the third Epiſtle of S. Iohn, verſ. 2. I wiſh above all things that thou maiſt proſper, even as thy ſoule proſpereth.
                  
                  
                     
When a mans ſoule doth proſper in grace &amp; goodneſſe inwardly, together as his eſtate doth proſper in wealth &amp; ſubſtance outwardly, that, &amp; none but that is true proſperitie. Againe, many times it falls out ſo, and a man in himſelfe ſhall finde it ſo, that his ſoule proſpers beſt, when his eſtate proſpers worſt. Many a man is like the Pine tree, of which they write, that if the barke be peeled off, it will laſt a long time, elſe it rots: ſo God ſees, that many a man if hee had his barke upon him, if he had the wealth of the world about him, it would rot him, and make him worſe, therefore God is faine to barke him, and peele him, to keepe him naked and bare, and poore, that his ſoule may proſper the better.
                  Saint Auguſtine gives two reaſons why it pleaſeth God to withhold outward proſperity from them that inwardly proſper, and to denie outward bleſſings to them whom he hath inwardly bleſt with grace; firſt, leſt wicked people ſhould thinke, ob has colendum Deum, that Gods ſervants did ſerve him onely for theſe things: as the Devill accuſed Iob chap. 1. 10. Haſt thou not conſidered my ſervant Iob (ſaith God) how upright he walkes, and how carefully he ſerves me? I cannot blame him (quoth Satan) that hee ſerves thee, hee doth it 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , for his owne neede, to ſerve his owne turne, for thou makeſt ſuch an hedge about him, and ſo fenceſt him in with thine invincible protection, that none of all his enemies can make the leaſt gap to breake in upon him; doe but put forth thy hand (ſaith the Devill) manum laeſivam, (he meanes) thy puniſhing, thy vindictive revenging hand, and touch him with that (as

the Spider toucheth the Bee) touch him to torment him, and thou ſhalt ſee Iob will turne another leafe, and in ſtead of bleſſing thee, will curſe thee to thy face. Yea, doſt thou thinke ſo (ſaith God) doe thou take him to doe, Ile give thee leave, puniſh him, afflict him, doe any thing to him, ſpare but his life, and thou ſhalt ſee Iob will ſerve me no leſſe than hee did before; and ſo it fell out. And the ſame mind doe all Gods faithfull ſervants beare, proſper or not proſper, thrive or not thrive, rewarded or not rewarded, all is one to them, they will and are reſolved to ſerve and ſeeke the Lord. Secondly, Leſt Gods ſervants ſhould beare a mercinary minde, and ſerve him onely to make a gaine of his ſervice, and ſo alwayes be looking and lingering after temporall favours; this would turne patientiam in avaritiam, Chriſtian patience into carnall covetouſneſſe, and make men carnally minded in their ſpirituall affaires: that were 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) an affection of diſhonour, and would diſcover a kinde of baſeneſſe in Gods ſervants to ſeeke him onely for their owne ends; therefore God ſees it beſt in ſome caſes, to reſtraine proſperity from them that ſeeke him, and that, alto conſilio, upon deepe advice, and great reaſon, as you ſee; Firſt, to convince the world of their miſopinion of Gods ſervants. Secondly, to rectifie the affection of them that ſerve him, that they may learne not to linger after that which God in his wiſedome ſees good to hold them ſhort of.
                  But for the proſperity of wicked and ungodly men (to returne to that) of ſuch as ſeeke not the Lord, but rather mingle their wealth with wickedneſſe, and

mixe their proſperity with blaſphemy, that ſet their mouth againſt heaven and ſay, as 'tis in Iob, chap. 21. 15. Who is the Almighty that wee ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhould we have if wee pray unto him? Such men as theſe, the more outwardly happy they are; the more undoubtedly miſerable; that which wee count the felicitie and the happineſſe of ſuch men, is indeed their ruine and their bane, to thrive well by evill courſes. You know what God did to Hophni and Phineas, that were as wicked wretches as the earth could beare; God let them alone, let them goe on and proſper and domineere over the poore people, ſent them no Croſſe, nor diſeaſe, nor judgement to interrupt them, but let them take their ſwinge in the very height of their rebellions; Why would God ſuffer ſuch flagitious villaines to have their will without controule? God himſelfe is pleaſed to give an account of it, 1 Sam. 2. 25. Becauſe (ſaith the text) he would deſtroy them: this is the event and iſſue of a wicked mans proſperity. I have ſeene the wicked in great proſperity (ſaith David, Pſal. 37. 35.) flouriſhing like a greene bay tree. Why like a greene bay tree rather than like a greene oke-tree, or greene apple-tree? I will tell you what I think the reaſon is; The bay-tree (you know) is green all the winter▪ long, when oke-trees, and apple-trees, and all other farre more profitable and fruitfull trees, do wither, decay, and ſhed their leaves, ſtand naked and bare, and looke as if they were rotten &amp; dead; then doth the bay-tree flouriſh and looks as freſh and as green as it were in the midſt of the ſpring; when other trees decay, that flouriſheth. So fares it with wicked men in ſuch Winter-times

of the world as we had the laſt yeare, times of dearth and ſcarcity, times of want and penury; when many a poore Chriſtian is faine to faſt and fare hard, and goe with many hungry meale to bed, then doe you uſurers, oppreſſors, corn▪mongers, and ſuch others, thoſe mercatores humanarum calamitatum (as Nazianzen calls them) thoſe that make merchandiſe of poore mens miſeries, then doe they proſper, then doe they thrive, then doe they flouriſh like greene bay-trees; when others decay, then doe they flouriſh, then is their ſpring, their flouriſhing time. [They flouriſh like greene bay trees.]
                  
                  Well, but what followes in the next verſe? After a while (ſaith David) I ſought him, but he could not be found; as if he had ſaid, I ſought on earth in his manſion, in his dwelling-place, thence hee was gone, there he was not to be found▪ afterward I ſought him in heaven, to ſee if I could finde him there among the Saints and bleſſed ſoules above, there hee was not to be found: Where was he then? Verily he was gone downe, as is ſaid of Iudas, Act. 1. 25. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , gone downe to his owne place, gone downe to hell, there David might have found him, but there hee ſought him not. And this is the miſerable end of a wicked mans proſperity.
                  The conſideration whereof may be a ſtay unto us againſt that great temptation that troubled David and Ieremy, and ſtill troubles them that are weake in faith, to ſee the proſperity of wicked men, to ſee it goe well with them that be evill, and ill with them that doe well. Doſt thou ſee an ungodly man laden with wealth, honour and eaſe? doſt thou ſee an hypocrite

and an evill liver bleſt as Eſau was with the dew of heaven and the fatneſſe of the earth; doſt thou ſee a graceleſſe ruffin, one that feaſts without feare, drinkes without meaſure, ſweares without feeling, and lives without God; and yet his body vigorous, his coffers plenteous, and his eſtate proſperous? in a word, doſt thou ſee them proſper that ſeeke not the Lord, but lie wallowing in that which God abhors, and ſtand chargeable in their ſoules with that which ſeparates and divides betwixt man and his God? why, be not diſcomforted at it, be not diſquieted with it, do not fret thy ſelfe becauſe of the ungodly, neither be thou envious at evill doers; but conſider the end of thoſe men, that is the Apoſtles expreſſion, Iames 5. 11. You know the patience of Iob and what end the Lord made with him, though he curſt him at firſt, yet he doubled his bleſſing upon him at laſt; ſo ſtay till you ſee what end God will make with theſe men: ſurely O God (ſaith David, Pſal. 73. 18.) Thou haſt ſet theſe men in ſlippery places, thou caſteſt them downe into deſtruction: a man that ſtands in lubrico in a ſlippery place, as on ice or glaſſe, ſhall have much a-doe to keepe himſelfe upright though no body touch him, but if one ſhould come upon him unawares and give him a ſudden juſtle, or a ſudden ruſh, he hath no power in the world to uphold himſelfe, but muſt fall and that dangerouſly: and this is the caſe of wicked wealthy men, they thinke they are 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , unmoveable and faſtned on a rocke that never ſhall be moved; but they are deceived; God that knowes their ſtanding, tels us hee hath ſet themon ſlippery places,

and it will not be long ere God ſend ſome death, ſome judgement, ſome evill angell or other to give them ſuch a ſudden juſtle, ſuch a ſudden ruſh, that without great mercy on Gods part, and great repentance on their owne part, they muſt fall inevitably into the pit of hell. And this is the firſt point I deſire to have handled, namely, that the right way for a man to proſper indeed is to ſerve and ſeeke the Lord, whoſoever proſpers without ſeeking of God, his proſperitie in this world, ſhall be his ruine and perdition in the world to come.
                  Secondly, the manner how one that deſires to proſper muſt ſeeke the Lord, and that is to be done two dayes:

                        1. Humiliter,
                        
                        2. Veraciter;
                        
                     
                  
                  Humbly and unfainedly, ſorrowfully &amp; ſincerely.
                  Firſt, Humiliter, as the bleſſed Virgin Mary told our Saviour, Luke 2. 48. Thy father and I have ſought thee ſorrowing. They that would find the Lord muſt ſeeke him ſorrowing, with ſad and heavie hearts, bewailing and bemoaning their owne miſerable eſtate through ſinne before God, as it is ſaid of the Iſraelites, 1 Sam. 7. 
                        •
                     . When the Arke of God was departed from them, they lamented after the Lord: the beſt and trueſt lamentation in the world is to lament after the Lord, and a man hath never ſo juſt a cauſe to lament as when the Lord for ſinne is departed from him. We read in the ſtory of Micha, Iudg. 18. 24. that when the Souldiers had taken away Micha's gods, he ranne crying and weeping after them, as a

man diſtracted and deprived of all his comfort; the Souldiers hearing him, turned backe and asked him, what he ailed: ſaith Micha, Yee have taken away my gods, and doe yee aske me what I aile? can yee blame a man that hath loſt his gods to be out of quiet? If Micha could find in his heart to lament for the loſſe of a falſe god, a god of his owne making, as good gods as that lying at the backe of the fire, warming a man or roaſting of meate, (as Eſay ſpeakes) ſhall a Chriſtian finde in his heart to loſe the true God, the God of all comfort and conſolation, and that by ſinne which is the worſt loſſe of all, and that not by any others taking away (as in Michas caſe) but by his owne act and wilfull default, and not be grieved, nay not moved a-whit; breake none of his ſleepe, none of his wonted ſports for it, as if he reckoned God as good loſt as found? God forbid. Certainely, hee that can lament for the loſſe of his goods, and cannot lament for the loſſe of his God, is worthy to loſe both his goods and his God for ever. God was angry with the carnall Iewes, Hoſ. 7. 14. becauſe they howled upon him for corne and wine, but did not cry unto him with their hearts; they howled becauſe God had ſcanted them in his mercie, but they never howled becauſe they had ſcanted God in their duty; they howled for want of meanes not for want of grace, which is the greateſt want of all: obſerve therefore what a deſpicable, contemptible terme God gives their prayers, hee cals them ululatus, howlings, like the howlings of a Dogge, or a Wolfe, which is a moſt harſh unpleaſing note in the eare of a man; ſuch are the

prayers of obſtinate ſinners in their extremitie to God.
                  
                     They howled unto me upon their beds, but they did not cry unto me with their hearts: tis not the howling of the mouth that God regards, but tis the cry of the heart that pierceth heaven and entreth into the eares of Almighty God: you may ſee it in Moſes, Exodus 14. 10. When the Iſraelites were ſtraighted at the red Sea; having the Sea before them, their enemies behind them, Rocks and Hils of each ſide of them; the text ſaith, The people cried, and made a dolefull howling and lamentation to the Lord, Moſes held his peace; and ſee the iſſue: Populus clamabat &amp; non audiebatur, tacebat Moſes &amp; audiebatur, The people cried and God heard not them; Moſes held his peace and hee was heard, Verſ. 15. Why doſt thou cry unto me (ſaith God) when he uttered never a word, nor made any noiſe that we can read of, onely his heart cried, and that was it that God liſtned unto: and therefore if anie man find himſelfe to be 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      of ſuch a hard and dry and brawny temper that he cannot cry with his eyes let him cry with his heart, and it is enough. As it is ſaid of our Saviour, Heb. 4. 6. That in the dayes of his fleſh he offered prayers and ſupplications 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , with ſtrong cries and teares unto God, hee did not onely cry but he cried ſtrongly, he did even ſtraine himſelfe in this prayers with the greateſt vehemency that poſſibly he could: it is not a faint and feeble cry, but it is a ſtrong and hearty cry that wakens the Lord to liſten to us, as the Diſciples awaked our Saviour when he ſlept in the ſhip, Mat. 8. If a mother heare her child cry out

right, cry heartily and ſtrongly, what-ever ſhee is a doing ſhee will lay it aſide and run to ſtill her child: God is more compaſſionate and tender over his children than any earthly mother over hers; if hee doe but heare us cry heartily, cry in good earneſt, hee hath not the power to containe himſelfe but will ariſe and have mercy on us; that is the reaſon our prayers want ſucceſſe, becauſe they want heart, their bleſſing is according to their vigor. You will ſay it were a good comfort for a man thus to cry &amp; lament and make his moane to God in this ſad and ſorrowful maner, if a man were but ſure to proſper ever the better: for that I refer you to an inſtance in Scripture, 1 Sam. 1. 9, 10. In 1 Chro. 4. 9, 10. It is ſaid of Iabez who was a man of ſorrow, that he was more honourable than all his brethren, God proſpered him and bleſſed him more than all the reſt; how came that to paſſe? ſee ver. 10. And Iabez called on the God of Iſrael, ſaying, Oh that thou wouldeſt bleſſe me indeed, and inlarge my coaſt, and that thy hand might be with me, and that thou wouldeſt keepe me from evill, that it may not grieve me, and (ſaith the text) God granted him that which he requeſted: that is, granted him proſperitie, granted him a proſperous and happy life; there is the fruit of a godly ſorrow. A ſorrowfull man (as Iabez was) when he prayeth in good earneſt, that God will bleſſe him indeed, and be with him in all his wayes, ſuch an one ſhall be ſure to proſper in his ſuite, and ſhall undoubtedly receive either what hee doth aske or what hee ſhould aske: he then that deſires to proſper let him ſeeke the Lord this way, dolenter ſorrowfully.
                  
                  2 Veraciter, truly, ſincerely, and with all his heart,

                     Deut. 4. 29. If thou ſeeke the Lord thy God thou ſhalt finde him, if thou ſeeke him with all thy heart. He that would find God muſt ſeeke him entirely, unfainedly, and not by halves but with his whole heart, becauſe God though he love cor contritum, a broken heart, a heart rent and torne with griefe and godly ſorrow for ſinne, yet he cannot abide cor diviſum, a cloven heart, a heart parted and divided within it ſelfe, which makes a man to be (as Saint Iames cals him) 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a double minded man; ſo we tranſlate it, but the word ſignifies a man with two ſoules, or with two minds; ſuch a man muſt never looke to proſper by his ſeeking of God. I will give you an inſtance in one or two, 1 Chron. 10. the two laſt verſes, it is ſaid, that Saul died for the ſinne that he ſinned againſt the Lord: what was that? one was for ſparing Agag and the Amalekites cattell, pretending devotion when hee did it for gaine; but the maine ſinne was this, that hee ſought to the witch, and ſought not to the Lord, therefore the Lord ſlew him. Some man may ſay, did not Saul ſeeke to the Lord? that he did, looke into 1 Sam. 28. 6. You ſhall ſee that Saul tried all waies to ſeek the Lord, &amp; the Lord would not be found of him nor anſwer him, neither by Dreames, nor by Vrim, nor by Prophets: how then can this hold good, that Saul ſhould die for not ſeeking of God, when he ſought him, &amp; God would not anſwer him? the beſtanſwer that I can give is this, Non videtur fieri quod non legitim
                           •
                         fit, that which is not done rightly and ſincerely as it ought to be done is counted as not done in the ſight of God; Sauls ſeeking of God was counted as not ſeeking of God, becauſe he ſought

him not ſincerely as he ought to ſeeke him, you may ſee the like in another kind, 2 Kin. 17. 32, 33. it is ſaid the Samaritan-Aſſyrians that mongrell brood, which were tranſplanted out of Aſſyria into Samaria, that they feared the Lord and ſerved their owne gods alſo, and the next verſ. ſaith, they feared not the Lord at all; how can theſe things concurre? one verſe ſaith, they did feare God, another ſaith, they did not feare him. Anſw. Their feare of God is counted as no feare of God, becauſe it was no ſincere feare of God: had they truly feared God they ſhould never have need to feare their owne Idols, for hee that truely feareth God hath his bleſſing, that he ſhall neede feare nothing elſe but God in this ſervice of God; as contrarily, he that feares not God hath this curſe, that God will give him ſuch a trembling heart that hee ſhall feare every thing but God, idols and divels and all, as thoſe people did, and therefore was their feare of God counted as no feare of God, becauſe no ſincere feare; as Sauls ſeeking is counted as no ſeeking becauſe it was no ſincere ſeeking of God.
                  By this you ſee, that lip-labour is but loſt labour, and lame prayers are but loſt prayers in the ſight of God: the Apoſtle gives us a caveat, 2 Ioh. 8. to take heed that wee loſe not the things wee have wrought; a man were better loſe any thing that hee hath wrought, than loſe his prayers for want of true devotion: Labia doloſaſi in ſermonibus ſint, ſaltem in orationibus non ſint, deceitfull lips and a double tongue if they be found in our other ſpeeches, let them not be found in our prayers in any caſe (ſaith S. Aug.) God forbid that a Chriſtian ſhould double

and diſſemble with God and the world in his devotions; he that doth ſo let him never look to proſper▪ 
                     Salomon ſpeakes it peremptorily, Prov. 28. 13. He that hideth his ſins ſhal not proſper: that is, as we may apply it to our purpoſe, he that makes Religion a cloake to cover and colour his deceit, he that makes devotion a veile to hide his ſinnes, ſuch an one ſhall never proſper; he therefore that deſires proſperity, let him ſeeke the Lord veraciter ſincerely.
                  
                  Thirdly, the time when wee muſt ſeeke God, and that is to be conſidered in two Circumſtances,

                        Generally, and
                        
                        Particularly.
                     
                  
                  Firſt, Generally; Hee that deſires to proſper must ſeeke God at all times. As we ſay, Nullum tempus occurrit Regi; ſo no time comes amiſſe to God, morning or evening, midday or midnight, all times are alike for that matter, a man can never come unſeaſonably with a ſuite to God, Exod. 18. Moſes ſate from morning till night to heare the cauſes of the people, but he grew weary of it, and was faine to give it over; but there is one above, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous that ſits continually 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Heb. 1, on the right hand of Majeſtie on high to heare the cauſes and complaints of his poore people and to receive and preſent our petitions to the divine Majeſtie and is never weary of it, come when we will he is at leaſure to heare us. It is a prety obſervation that S. Auguſtine makes out of the parable propoſed by our Saviour, Luke 11. where he that knockt at midnight to borrow bread of his neighbour, found all the whole family aſleepe, onely the maſter of the

houſe was awake, and he anſwered, and opened, and gave him that he craved, though it was at an unſeaſonable time; Nullus de janitoribus reſpondit, none of all the porters, none of all the ſervants, none of all the children made him any anſwer, they were all aſleepe, onely the maſter was awake, and heard him when hee called. Iuſt ſo it fares with us when wee knocke and call at the doore of heaven for any mercie, none of all the Prophets nor Apoſtles, none of all the bleſſed Saints departed make us any anſwer; alas, they heare us not, they ſleepe in peace and are at reſt from their labours, onely God Almightie, who is the Maſter and Maker of that bleſſed familie, hee, and onely hee doth heare and anſwer, at what time ſoever we cry unto him; Hee that keepeth Iſrael neither ſlumbreth nor ſleepeth, call when we will God is alway awake to heare and helpe: No time unſeaſonable to ſeeke God.
                  Secondly, but more particularly, for one that deſires to proſper, there is a choiſe time and ſeaſon to ſeeke the Lord above all the reſt, and that is early in the morning. 'Tis a pretty conjecture that the Hebrewes make upon that ſaying of the Angel to Iacob, Gen. 32. 26. Let mee goe for the morning appeareth. I take it the true reaſon was, becauſe Iacob ſhould not be too curious in looking and gazing upon that humane ſhape, wherein this great Angel Chriſt appeared; for he it was that wraſtled with Iacob, but their conceit is, that the Angell which wraſtled with Iacob all night, deſired to depart when the morning appeared, becauſe hee was now to goe to the reſt of the bleſſed company and quire of Angels, to ſing

their morning-hymne unto God. 'Tis but a conjecture, but we may apply it thus; We all hope to be 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , like the Angels in heaven, let us be like them on earth too, and how ever we are imployed at other times, when the morning appeares let us haſten to God, and aske him bleſſing every morning, as our children doe us, and no doubt but God will bleſſe us the better all the day after. Iob 8. 5, 6. If thou wilt ſeeke unto God betimes, and make thy ſupplication to the Almighty, ſurely now he will awake for thee, and make thy habitation proſperous. I make no doubt but a many of you are early riſers, that are up before the morning watch, I ſay, before the morning-watch, (i) before the day-ſtarre or the Sunne appeare: and 'tis poſſible for a man to be early up and never the neere, but hee that riſeth early to pray and ſeeke the Lord, ſhall be ſure not to loſe his labour, for he ſhall proſper the better all the day, If thou wilt ſeeke the Lord, &amp;c. Yea, but there's a place of Scripture that ſeemes to croſſe and contradict it, Prov. 1. 28. They ſhall ſeeke me early, but they ſhall not finde me. Is the Scripture contrary to it ſelfe? Doth God ſay in one place, If ye ſeeke me early ye ſhall finde me; and in another place, Though you ſeeke me early you ſhall not finde me? How ſhall we know which to beleeve, which to build upon? I anſwer,
                  There's a two-fold early, Gods early, and mans early; Gods early is to ſeeke him in the firſt place, Ante omnia adoremus Deum (was the old rule) before we eate or drinke, before we worke or play, before we doe any thing, doe that firſt; firſt ſeeke the kingdome of God, and that's Gods early. Mans early

is at the beginning of trouble, the beginning of ſickneſſe, the beginning of ſorrow, and then the wickedſt wretch upon earth will ſeeke the Lord, but then perhaps he ſhall not finde him; hee that will not ſeeke him in peace, ſhall hardly finde him in trouble; hee that will not ſeeke him in health, ſhall not eaſily find him in ſickneſſe, yea, though he ſeeke him early, at the very firſt, at the very beginning of it, as Ioab fled to the Altar in his perplexity, but it ſaved not his life becauſe he never came at it in his proſperity to offer upon it. So that you ſee, if wee take mans early to ſeeke God, we may chance to miſſe him; but if wee take Gods early, we ſhall be ſure to finde him.
                  You then that deſire to proſper, remember Gods early; the firſt thing you do in the morning, let it be ſeeke God, never thinke your ſelves dreſt till that be done, let thy ſoules have a morning draught as wel as thy body, I mean a morning prayer to fence it againſt the infectious ayre of the world: Salomon gives the reaſon, Prov. 27. 1. For who can tell what a day may bring forth? 'Tis a Metaphor taken from a wombe, when a woman is in travell, who can tell what ſhee will bring forth till ſhee be delivered, may be a ſonne, may be a daughter, may be a monſter; ſo when the wombe of the morning is in travell, who can tell what a day may bring forth, may be albus, may be ater dies, may be a white, a happy, a comfortable day; may be a blacke, a diſmall, a dolefull day; wee doe not know what a day may bring forth, whether judgement or mercy, whether good or bad events (therefore to prevent the worſt, 'tis good to make ſure worke for our owne ſafetie, namely to

ſeeke the Lord in the morning and then come what will come, all ſhall be for the beſt, God will turne it all to good Omnia cooperantur, &amp;c. Rom. 8. All things worke together for good to them that love God.
                  
                  He then that would be proſperous and ſpeed well, let him be religious and pray well, for he that prayes well can never ſpeed amiſſe: and therefore if you ſee one that followes his calling, and is not followed with Gods bleſſing, it may juſtly be ſuſpected, that ſuch a one reſtraineth prayer from Almighty God, as Eliphaz told Iob in another caſe, Iob 15. 4. Now 'tis juſt with God to reſtraine proſperity from them that reſtraine their prayers from him, 'tis juſt with God to withhold his bleſſing from thoſe that have not the care nor the grace to aske it. So much for the time and order of our ſeeking of the Lord.
                  Fourthly, where, or in what place wee muſt ſeeke God. Generally, wee are to ſeeke him every where, for God is omni-preſent, in all places to be found of them that ſeeke him faithfully; as David ſaith; Pſalme 139. 3. Thou art about my bed, and about my paths, and ſpieſt out all my wayes. We little thinke when wee lie downe in our beds as a dogge lies downe in a kennell, without any prayer, any ejaculation, any good motion to God-ward, we little thinke that God is ſo neere us that hee is about our beds, and doth obſervare excubias, watch our watchings, and obſerve our lying downe, and our riſing up.
                  Againe, when wee walke in Circuitus, walke the Devils round from one ſinne to another, from one vanity to another, from one ill company to another,

we little thinke that God is about our paths, and ſpieth out all our wayes: but whether wee thinke it or no, ſo it is for certaine; and therefore to apply it the right way; In what place ſoever we ſeeke God, in bed or up, within doore or without, in the field or in the road, we ſhall be ſure to finde him to our comfort and protection. But more eſpecially, there is a proper peculiar place appointed for Chriſtians to ſeeke the Lord in, and that is the Church of God, the Sanctuary or houſe of prayer, ther's his dwelling place, and thither muſt wee reſort to ſeeke him. We have an expreſſe law for it, Deut 12. 5. In that place which the Lord your God ſhall chuſe to put his name in, in that his habitation ſhall ye ſeeke unto him. Neither was this a law judiciall, or ceremoniall, that bound the Iew onely for a time, but morall and perpetuall, that bindes the Chriſtian for ever, to ſeeke the Lord where he is to be found, (i) in his Sanctuary; they that refuſe to come there, may juſtly be termed (as Eſau was) profane perſons, as being procul 
                           •
                         fano, farre from the Sanctuary, and conſequently out of Gods protection; for they that are thus out of the one, are out of the other alſo.
                  As S. Austin notes out of the parable, Luke 10. 30. concerning the man that fell among theeves, and was wounded and left halfe dead, 'tis noted of him that hee was going down from Ieruſalem to Iericho; from the Church I warrant you: Ieruſalem was the Church of God, the holy Citie; Iericho was a curſed place, branded with an ancient curſe ſince the dayes of Ioſhua, and thither lay his journey: whereupon Saint Auſtin notes, Si non deſcendiſſet, fortaſſe in latrones
                     
                     non incidiſſet, had he not been deſcending and going downeward from God and from his Church, peradventure hee had not fallen into the hands of theeves. God would have protected him, the Lord would have ſafe guarded and defended him, that no ſuch evill ſhould have betided him; but becauſe hee was going from the Church to a curſed place, and like enough about a naughty buſineſſe; therefore God gave him over, and he fell into the hands of theeves. As many therefore as deſire Gods protection and bleſſing, let them reſort to the Church to ſerve and ſeeke the Lord.
                  You will ſay, it were a good comfort for a man ſo to doe, if he were but ſure to proſper ever the better; but we ſee many that frequent the Church duely and daily, that yet proſper never the more.
                  
                     Anſw. If it be ſo, then ſurely tis to be feared, that ſuch came not to Church with a true intent to ſeeke God, but either for no
                        ••
                     lty and faſhion ſake, or for company to doe as others doe, or for ſome other ſiniſter reſpect, they doe not make it their errand, their aime, and the drift of their ſoules to ſeeke God; if they did, God would ſurely proſper them in one kinde or other: you know the place, Pray for the peace of Ieruſalem, they ſhall proſper that love thee. That love what? that love Ieruſalem, that love the Church of God, that love the word of God, that love the Miniſters of God, that love the ordinances of God, they ſhall proſper (ſaith David, Pſal. 122. 6, 9.) If they doe not proſper outwardly, they ſhall proſper inwardly, if they doe not proſper in goods, they ſhall proſper in grace, and that is the better

proſperitie by farre. I ſay the better, and I will make it good out of Heb. 8. 6. Ieſus Chriſt is the mediatour of a better covenant, eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes. The words at the firſt ſight implie, that the covenant of the Goſpel is a better covenant than the covenant of the law: and againe, that the promiſes of the Goſpell are better promiſes than the promiſes of the Law: Now if you look into the old Teſtament, you ſhall finde that the promiſes of the Law were moſt of them, and the maine of them, temporall promiſes, promiſes of outward proſperity, that if they kept the commandements, and ſought the Lord, they ſhould dwell in the good land, the land that flowed with milke and honey, they ſhould have corne, and wine, and oyle in abundance, they ſhould lay up gold as duſt, and the gold of Ophir as the flints of the river, Iob 22. 24. theſe and the like were the promiſes of the Law. Now looke into the New Teſtament, and you ſhall finde the promiſes of the Goſpell are cleane of another nature, moſt of them ſpirituall promiſes, promiſes of the pardon of ſinnes, the peace of conſcience, the joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and ſuch like: and theſe, ſaith the Apoſtle, are 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , better promiſes than the other.
                  Hence I gather, that he that in theſe dayes ſeekes the face of God▪
                      in his Church, and is of ſuch a converſation as becommeth the Goſpell, if he have not temporall proſperity, he ſhall have that that is better for him, hee ſhall have the pardon of his ſinnes, the favour of his God, the comfort of his conſcience, and the ſalvation of his ſoule, which are things of greater worth than all the outward happineſſe under heaven,

and will be a ſecret ſtay and comfort to the ſoule, when all that the earth affords will not yeeld a man one droppe of true refreſhing.
                  You know that the Priſoners in the Tower, Noblemen, and great men, and ſuch others, they are in worſe eſtate and condition than the pooreſt Waterbearer in the Citie: for why? though they have good diet, good lodging, good attendance, fine roomes, ſoft beds, curious wal
                        •
                     es, &amp;c. yet they are ſub ira, they are under the wrath and diſpleaſure of the King, and looke every day when they ſhall be called out to arraignment, to have ſentence paſſe againſt them, and execution to be done upon them: Such is the caſe of a wicked wealthy man, whoſe ſinnes are unpardoned, and whoſe conſcience is unpurged, and whoſe ſoule is unreconciled to God, he is in worſe eſtate and condition than the pooreſt of Gods ſervants that fare with bread and water: for why? though hee have great friends, great meanes, and a great eſtate, yet he is, ſub ira under the wrath and diſpleaſure of God, and where-ever hee goes, the blacke clouds of Gods heavy vengeance hang over his head, ready upon every provocation to drop downe upon him. No marvell then that Salomon ſaith. The righteous man is more excellent than his neighbour, Prov. 12. 26. he doth not deny but a righteous man may be poorer than his neighbour, yet he ſaith, he is more excellent, becauſe his excellency is intrinſecall, (omnis decor ab intus) the others is but outward and adventitious. Now he that ſhall count himſelfe more excellent than his neighbour, becauſe hee excels him in outward things, in wealth and

worldly goods, it is but (as one well compares it) as if a mud-wall that the Sunne ſhines upon, ſhould boaſt it ſelfe againſt a wall of marble that ſtands in the ſhadow.
                  What ſaith a Father, An ideo Angelus pauper, quia non habet jumenta? Shall wee count an Angell to be poore becauſe he hath not heards, and flockes, and droves of cattell, as worldly miſers have? No, their riches are in another kinde. So ſhall we count a Chriſtian poore and baſe becauſe hee wants the wealth of the world? No, they are rich in another kinde, what he wants outwardly, he hath it inwardly, what he wants in meanes, he hath in grace, though he be not rich in the purſe, hee is rich in the faith; though he have not ſilver and gold, hee hath that which is better than either, hee hath the precious Pearle of Gods grace, which is of more value to inrich the ſoule, than all the gold and ſilver in the world.
                  The Goſpell (you know) compares grace to Pearls; now Pearls are of no value to dunghill-Cocks; but to them that know the worth of them, they are the onely riches in the world; and the rather becauſe,
                  Firſt, they are durable riches, no fire can conſume them, no moth can eat them, no ruſt take hold of them.
                  Secondly, they are portable riches: a man that hath a thouſand pound in Pearls, may carry them all about him, and never clog him, which he could not doe if his wealth lay in other things. So here, to one that hath no grace, to a godleſſe graceleſſe man, the

Pearls of Gods grace is of no value; but to one that knows how to prize it, it exceeds all worldly wealth, as farre as gold exceeds dirt, and Pearls exceede pebbles; and the rather, becauſe, firſt, it is durable, it will never decay, nor be utterly loſt. Secondly, it is portable, it will accompany a man, whereſoever hee goes, hee ſhall carry it with him, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the friend of his boſome, the companion of his ſtudie, and a continuall comforter in all adverſitie; yea, when death it ſelfe comes to diveſt and ſtrip him of all other riches, no death can ſtrip him of that, it is a grace that ſhall never leave him till it bring him to glory.
                  Miſtake me not (I beſeech you) I doe not ſpeake this to any mans prejudice, as if riches and Religion, as if goods and grace were 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , incompatible and could not conſiſt nor ſtand together; but as our Saviour ſaid to the woman, Luke 11. 27. when ſhe cried out, Bleſſed is the wombe that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee ſucke: our Saviour denied not that, for that was true alſo and undeniable, but anſwered her by a corrective compariſon, yea rather bleſſed are they that heare the word of God and keepe it: ſo it is a great bleſſing of God to have the wealth of the world and to proſper outwardly; but it is as greater bleſſing to have the grace of the Spirit and to proſper inwardly. In regard whereof David having prayed for many temporall bleſſings in the behalfe of his people, Pſal. 144. 12. 13, 14. that their ſonnes might be tall and hardy, and their daughters faire, their oxen ſtrong to labour, their ſheepe fertile and fruitfull, that there might be no commotion nor complaining in their

ſtreets; at length windeth up all with this Epiphonema or Concluſion, Bleſſed be the people that are in ſuch a caſe; but on the necke of it hee comes in with an Epanorthoma or Correction of his former ſpeech, eating in and revoking his words, as if he had ſpoken otherwiſe than well, yea rather (ſaith he) Bleſſed are the people that have the Lord for their God; as if he had ſaid; that indeed is a bleſſing in ſome kind, but it is nothing to this bleſſedneſſe, for that is but externall, this is internall; that is but temporall, this eternall. He then that deſires to proſper, whether in grace, or in goods or in both, let him thus do; frequent the houſe of God, ſeek the face of God, reverence the miniſterie of the word, yeeld thy ſelfe to be wrought upon by the powerfull Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, and this (if any thing) will make thee to proſper.
                  2 Thus you have heard the firſt point handled with the ſeverall circumſtances of it, touching mans duty, To ſeeke God: the next is Gods mercy, To proſper them that ſeeke him.
                  
                  
                     God made him to proſper.
                     God is the Authour of all proſperitie; as David ſpeaks of promotion, it comes neither frō the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, from the North, nor from the South, but it comes from God; ſo doth this. It is obſerveable that when Iſaac bleſſed Iacob Gen. 27. 28. thus he ſaid; God give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatnes of the earth, and plenty of corne and wine; after when he came to bleſſe Eſau, he gives him in a maner the verie ſame bleſſing, Verſ. 39. Behold, thy dwelling ſhall be the fatneſſe of the earth and the dew of heaven from above; but no mention is made of God in Eſau's bleſſing as

was in Iacobs. Doubtleſſe this was a preſage that Iacobs poſterity, all true 
                        •
                     ſraelites, ſhould depend upon God for thoſe temporall bleſſings, and acknowledge themſelves beholding to God for their outward proſperity; and ſo ſhould not Eſau's race, I meane the men of this world, of whom David ſaith, Pſal. 17. 14. They have their bellies filled with hid treaſure; for it is abſconditum, it is hid to them, who it is that feeds and filleth their bellies, namely, God; they know him not, neither doe they acknowledge his gifts: but wee know him and are bound in dutie and conſcience to acknowledge that we have nothing but what wee have received; no food to nouriſh us, nor meanes to maintaine us, nor hopes nor helpes to preferre and proſper us, but what muſt come from God: Non nobis Domine, non nobis, not unto us Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give the praiſe: marke the ingemination; the Prophet teacheth us to pray twice againſt our owne praiſe, we are ſo apt to praiſe our ſelves, ſo ready to glory in our owne proſperity; but let me adviſe you, you that finde that the world doth favour you, and proſperity begins to come upon you, whom ſhould you thanke for it? not thanke your ſelves, but thanke your God; it is he that makes you to proſper.
                  Obſerve againe, that it is not barely ſaid, God proſpered him, but God made him to proſper (as it were) in deſpight of all thoſe that ſought and wiſh'd his undoing. As it is ſaid in another caſe, Mat. 5. 45. God makes the Sunne to ſhine upon the good and upon the bad; he makes the raine to fall upon the just and the unjuſt; it is not ſaid, hee ſuffers it, but hee makes

it; 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , facit exoriri; no doubt there is many a one in the world that is ſuch a Lueifuga, a hater of light and lover of darkeneſſe, whoſe deeds are ſo evill that the very Sunne in the heavens, is even loth to caſt his beames and ſhine upon him; and there is many a plot of ground that is purchaſed, and poſſeſſed by ſo wicked an owner, that the very clouds of heaven are loth and unwilling to drop their fatneſſe upon it, but that God as it were makes them doe it: Hence we ſee that God hath the diſpoſing of all theſe temporall bleſſings; if the Lord undertake to make a man, all the world ſhall not marre him; we may ſee it in Moſes, Exod. 7. 1. Pharaoh did what hee could to marre Moſes and to expoſe him to ruine and obſcuritie in his very infancie; but God that undertooke to make him, never left him, nor gave him over, till hee had made him a god to Pharaoh; not a god whom Pharoah ſhould worſhip, but whom he ſhould feare and ſtand in awe of; a god to execute judgements and bring plagues upon him and to remove the ſame againe. Hannah ſaith in her ſong, 1 Sam. 2. 7. The Lord maketh poore and maketh rich, it were as eaſie to God to make all rich, as to make any poore; againe, it were all one with God to make all poore as to make any rich (for he hath the making of both) but in his providence and wiſedome he hath made ſome of both ſorts, that the one might helpe themſelves to heaven by ſupplying and relieving the neceſſities of the other.
                  And therefore for our owne parts, if we have any making, any promotion or proſperitie above our fellowes, we muſt confeſſe with David: That it is God that hath made us, and not we our ſelves; it is God that

hath made us Men, when hee might have made us Beaſts, it is God that hath made us Chriſtians when he might have made us Infidels; it is God that hath made us rich when he might have made us poore; in a word, it is God that hath made us to proſper when hee might have made us to periſh. (Hee ſought the Lord, and God made him to proſper.)
                  
                  But that is not all; the maine thing that I obſerve from hence is, the benefit that ariſeth to us by ſeeking of God, namely, that it turnes to our owne advantage, our owne profit; God hath onely the glorie, but the gaine is wholly ours, for it is a meanes to make us proſper; as David ſpeaking of the commandements, Pſal. 19. ſaith, that in keeping of them there is great reward; no man ſhall be a loſer by keeping of Gods commandements, but a gainer, and a great gainer too, for in keeeping of them there is great reward; if we be not rewarded on earth our reward ſhall be the greater in heaven, In coelis repoſita eſt major compenſatio (ſaith Calvin) the greateſt reward is reſerved in the heavens. Thus ſaith the Lord that teacheth thee to profit, Eſa. 48. 17. Oh that thou haddest hearkened to my commandements! then had thy proſperity beene as a floud, and thy righteouſneſſe as the waves of the ſea: thy proſperity ſhould have beene ſo large and plentifull, that as a floud it ſhould have run over the bankes, and the reward of thy righteouſneſſe as the waves of the ſea; that is, one reward ſhould follow upon the necke of another, as one wave followes upon the necke of another: ſo Deut. 5. 29. Oh that there were a heart in this people to love me, and feare me as they have ſaid, then ſhould it goe
                     
                     well with them and their children after them; not that I might be a gainer and you loſe, but that you and your children might reape the bene fit. So that as our Saviour ſaith of the Sabbath, that it was made for man, not onely for Gods ſervice, but for mans profit: ſo it is true of every Commandement, it was made for mans, that is, for mans good and benefit: therefore you have it ſo often repeated in Deuteronomy, Theſe are the Commandements that I have given thee for thy wealth and for thy good.
                  It is a pretty obſervation of Cajetan, upon that ſaying of God to Moſes, Exo. 34. 1. Hew thee two Tables, Dola tibi, non mihi, ego enim non indigio tua dolatione: Hew to thy ſelfe, not for me, for I neede none of thy hewing, nor yet any of thy tables, it is for thy owne and thy peoples good that I bid thee hew them; ſo it is for our good that God bids us ſeeke him; God hath onely the glory of it, but the benefit is our own, for it is a meanes to make us proſper.
                  Therefore if we love our ſelves and deſire to doe our ſelves good, let us ſeeke the Lord. I know, that naturally wee all love our ſelves too much, but ſpiritually wee all love our ſelves too little; for he that lives in ſinne, he doth not love himſelfe, for he goeth the way to undoe himſelfe both here and ever, 2 Chro. 24. 20. Why tranſgreſse ye the Commandements of the Lord that ye cannot proſper. We uſe to ſay of one that is of a good nature, but an evill husband, He is no mans foe but his owne; and it is true of every one that lives in any knowne ſinne, not grieving for it, nor ſtriving againſt it, not making conſcience to reforme it, he is his owne foe indeede, for he doth not onely anger God, but he hinders himſelfe that hee cannot

proſper, Why tranſgreſſe yee the commandements of God that ye cannot proſper?
                  
                  The like ſpeech you have in Ezek. 18. Why will you die, O houſe of Iſrael? God doth not ſay, Why will you ſin, O houſe of Iſrael? but why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael? as preſuppoſing they might wel know, if they wil needs ſin, they muſt needs die; for death is the wages of ſin, and followes it as the ſhadow followes the bodie. The Lord ſpeaks it with indignation, Why will ye die? as wondring they ſhould love themſelves no better, but even to ſeeke their own death, by ruſhing into ſinne, as a horſe ruſheth into the battell: that's the expreſſion that God uſeth (Ier. 8. 7.) They ruſh into ſin, as a horſe ruſheth into the battell. And why as a horſe ruſheth into the battell, and not as a man ruſheth into the battell? I will tell you what I thinke the reaſon is; The horſe when he ruſheth into the battell, doth not know that thoſe whom he ruſheth on be his enemies, that they will hurt, wound and kill him, but he ruſheth on them without feare or wit, and ruſheth upon his owne death: ſo fooliſh men doe not know, at leaſt will not know (This they willingly know not, as Saint Peter ſpeakes) that ſinne is ſuch an enemie to them, that it doth hurt, kill, and damne them, thereupon they ruſh upon ſinne without feare, and ſo runne upon their owne deſtruction.
                  Therefore it is a good meditation of Saint Auſtin upon that prayer of David, Deliver me, O Lord, from the evill man. Tu noli tibi eſſe malus, liberet te Dominus à te, &amp;c. Be not thou an evill man to thy ſelfe, pray to God to deliver thee from thy ſelfe being an evill man, and of an evill man to make thee a good

man, that thou maieſt not hurt thy ſelfe, and then never feare any hurt that any other evill man can doe thee. Wee ſay, Nemo laeditur niſi à ſeipſo, No man takes any hurt but he may thanke himſelfe, his owne ſinne is the cauſe of it; were it not for ſinne, heaven could have no quarrell againſt us, hell could have no power over us; our ſinnes are they that hurt us, they are thoſe that undoe us.
                  The Scripture ſpeakes of ſinne lying at the doore, Gen. 4. 7. If thou dost ill, ſinne lies at the doore. Of all doore keepers in the world, ſinne is the worſt, for if that lie at the doore it doth a double miſchiefe, it keepes Gods bleſſing out, and it lets Gods judgement in: therefore if you deſire to dwell in ſaferie, and to proſper in your familie, let not ſinne lie at your doore; as long as that lies there, without repentance, you muſt never looke to proſper.
                  The Scripture ſpeakes of ſome that are ſonnes of Belial, and daughters of Belial, (the ſonnes of Eli were ſonnes of Bel al, ▪Sam. 2. and 1. Hannah ſaith to Eli, Count not thy hand-maid for a daughter of Belial) Now a ſon of Belial is taken generally for one exceedingly wicked, the very child of the devill, that lives abſque jugo, without a yoake, without any feare of God before his eyes; but it ſeemeth to be derived of (Beli) which ſignifies without, and (jagnal) which is to be profitable, or to proſper; and ſo Belial noteth ſuch a one as is altogether unprofitable, and which cannot, ſhall not proſper. If any ſuch be here, or if any of you that be here finde your ſelves to be ſuch, that you are unprofitable members of the Commonwealth, that you doe, cannot proſper in your courſe

of life, I will not ſay yee are ſonnes of Belial (what have I to doe to judge you?) onely this let mee adviſe you, that you would conſider with your ſelves what ſinne it is that lies at your doores, and keepes Gods bleſſing out.
                  Remove but that, drive but that a way by a ſincere repentance and reformation of life, and then there is hope to proſper. We ſee it is the nature of a ſtreame, if it be ſtopt in his courſe that he cannot make a way in his wonted channell, it will turne in upon it ſelfe and flow backe againe towards the fountaine, and to the place it came from; ſo when you finde your ſelves ſtopt in your proceedings, that you cannot make away into the world ſo proſperouſly, ſo ſucceſfully as you deſire, then doe as the ſtreame doth, remeate, flow backe, reflect, recoyle and turne in upon your ſelves, to ſee where the fault lies, what ſinne is the cauſe of it (for that's the 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      the object or barre that hinders good things from us) and when you have turned backe into your ſelves, then turne forward unto your God, deſire him to pardon and amend you, and that's the way to proſper.
                  I have not yet done with this point; I beſeech you give me leave, and I beſeech God give mee grace, that I may apply it ſeverally and effectually to your ſoules and conſciences; for application is the life of all inſtruction; a thing proved is true to all, but it is good to none but onely to them to whom it is applied. Let me intreat therefore your patient attention yet a little longer, and you ſhall heare what I have to ſay unto you, not in any biting or galling manner (I never delighted in that ſtraine,) but in gentleneſſe

and mildneſſe to teach you how to proſper.
                  Firſt, you that are tradeſmen, Shop-keepers, Handicraftſ-men, that have nothing to betake to but what your honeſt labours and endeavours muſt helpe you to; doe you deſire to proſper in your trades and callings? then ſeeke the Lord before you ſet to worke, doe as they doe at Sea, that have oculos ad coelum, manus ad clavum, their hand upon the helme, and their eye upon the heaven; ſo when a mans hand is upon his worke, and his heart upon his God, then is his buſineſſe like to proſper. Contrariwiſe, he that ſets to his worke before he ſeekes to his God, takes a prepoſterous courſe, and commonly thrives thereafter. You know what Peter confeſt to Chriſt, Maſter, we have laboured all night and taken nothing; and no marvell, for Chriſt was not with him in the Ship; as ſoone as ever hee had gotten Chriſt, immediatly he had good ſucceſſe. Beleeve it, brethren, except Chriſt be with a man in his Shop, as he was with Peter in his Ship, there's no good to be done in any trade. What's the reaſon that ſo many Tradſmen breake and hide their heads, and runne away, but becauſe they have not ſought the Lord, nor gotten Chriſt unto them: they firſt breake with God, then breake with men; firſt loſe their credits with God, and then 'its juſt with God they ſhould loſe their credits with men: firſt leave their honeſtie, then loſe their proſperitie; if you deſire therefore that your dealings ſhould proſper, and your trading hold and thrive, get Chriſt into your ſhops and hee will bring you in Cuſtomers, hee will bleſſe your takings, hee will uphold you that

you ſhall never breake: but if ye expell Chriſt out of your ſhops by your wickedneſſe, as Peter out of weakeneſſe would have had Chriſt beene gone out of his Ship (ſaying, Lord, goe from me for I am a ſinfull man) then farewell all good fortune, and never looke to proſper.
                  And if you would have Chriſt to keepe with you, to dwell and make his abode with you, and ſo to bleſſe and proſper you, then be ſure that you uſe a good conſcience in all your dealings; take heede you do not deale with your Cuſtomers, as the Prophet Amos complaines of the dealers in his time, Amos 8. 5. That they made the Ephah ſmall, and the Shekle great; that is, they made the meaſure little, and the price great: take heed of that, 'tis an abomination to the Lord, and hee that uſeth it ſhall never proſper. Remember the ſaying, Iob cap. 8. 5. 6. Seeke the Lord and be upright, and he will make the habitation of thy righteouſneſſe proſperous.
                  
                  3 You that have occaſion to travell by land or by water, that have any journey to goe that you deſire ſhould proſper, then ſeeke to God before you ſet out of doores, take God along with you, requeſt his company, crave his conduct and guidance: pray as Eleazer did, Gen. 24. 12. O Lord God of my maſter Abraham, I beſeech thee ſend me good ſpeed this day; and God heard him, and granted his deſire, hee ſped as well as his heart could wiſh. If thou wouldſt be proſperous and ſpeed well, be religious and pray well; for hee that prayes well; can never ſpeed ill. In any caſe goe not out of doores without ſeeking of God: how doſt thou know what miſchiefe may befal

thee in the way, if God be not with thee to protect thee? but if thou haſt ſought to him, he will be a ſunne and a ſhield unto thee, Pſal. 84. a Sunne to direct and guide thee, a Shield to defend and ſave thee from all annoyances that may hurt thee; Hee will give his Angels charge over thee to keepe thee in all thy wayes; in viis, non in praecipitiis, in thy wayes wherein thou walkeſt with God as Enoch did; not in thy headlong courſes wherein thou runneſt without God: when thou runneſt in the Divels way, in the way of wickedneſſe and vanity, thou art out of Gods protection, and muſt never looke to proſper: (out of Gods wayes, and out of Gods protection.) In all thy journies therfore do as Elkanah did, 1 Sam. 1. 19. He roſe up early in the morning to return to Ramath, but he durſt not ſet forward a foot, till he had worſhipped before the Lord: Moſes would not ſtirre a foot except Gods preſence went with him, Exod. 33. 15. beare thou that mind, hold thou that godly reſolution, and (my life for thine) God will make thy way to proſper.
                  3 You that are as Souldiers and men of warre, if you be commanded to fight the Lords battels in cauſa Chriſti, againſt his and your enemies, and (as Tertul. ſpeakes) cruorem cruore reponere, to retaliate bloud with bloud, to ſhed your bloud for Chriſt that hath ſhed his bloud for you; doe you deſire that your warfare ſhould proſper? then ſeeke to God before you ſet upon your enemies; it is God that muſt cover your heads in the day of battell, it is hee that muſt defend you from the danger of the enemie. Beleeve it, a man of warre without God is but a naked man though in the mid'ſt of all his harneſſe, Exod. 32. 25. it is ſaid that Moſes ſaw the people were naked after their great

ſinne, how naked? Non veſte, ſed gratiâ &amp; praeſidio Dei, they were naked not ſo much for want of cloaths, armes, as for want of the grace, favour and protection of God; and no doubt (as Ferus obſerveth) Si tunc corruiſſent hoſtes, if their enemies had then fallen upon them, they had moſt ſhamefully foiled them. Thus it is ſtill, let a man be never ſo well cloathed, never ſo well armed, never ſo well guarded and weaponed, if he be ſtript of Gods protection by ſinne, hee lies naked and open to all diſaſters, and therefore if ever any of you come upon that ſervice, firſt ſeeke the Lord, and that is the way to proſper.
                  4 You that are great projectors and plotters for your advancement in the world, let me onely admoniſh you in a word; that in all your plots you would beginne with the firſt mover, and ſeeke to God before you ſet upon the meanes; for it is a certaine thing, no project can proſper without God: when you have wrought a buſineſſe and ripened it, and (as you thinke) brought it to maturity, if God be not ſought unto, he can daſh it and blaſt it in a moment, that it ſhall prove abortive like the untimely fruit of a woman, Eſay 8. 10. Take counſell together and it ſhall be brought to nought, pronounce a decree and it ſhall not ſtand, for God is with us. No good to be done without God. Hannah gives this counſell in her ſong, 1 Sam. 2. 3. Speake no more preſumptuouſly, let not arrogancy come forth of your mouth, for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him enterpriſes are eſtabliſhed; for any man to thinke or ſay that he is able of himſelfe to bring an enterprize to paſſe, hee ſpeakes preſumptuouſly, hee takes more upon him than he is able to performe; for mortall man hath not the knowledge to looke through a buſineſſe, to ſee all

the circumſtances of it, all the wheeles that muſt concurre to accompliſh it. The Lord is onely a God of knowledge, &amp; by him enterprizes are brought to paſſe; one thing brought to paſſe by him, is better than a thouſand brought to paſſe by our ſelves without him, becauſe his mercy is over all his works; that is (as one wel expounds it) as the warmth of a Hen is over al her egges to cheriſh and to hatch them, ſo is Gods mercy over all his works, to produce them, ſo as ſhall be moſt for our good; whereas if a man ſit brooding over his own projects, and think to hatch and produce them of himſelfe with out God, they wil prove but Cockatrices egges, which when they are broken a ſerpent appeares, ſome miſchiefe or other to ſhame and blame themſelves. If you deſire then that your projects ſhould proſper, and your enterpriſes ſucceed and come to good effect, then ſeeke to God for councell and direction, begge for the ſecret guidance of his ſpirit; and the ſecret working of his providence, and he ſhall proſper thy projects and bring thy enterprizes to paſſe.
                  5 Laſt of all, you that are in debt and diſtreſſe for want of meanes and maintenance; I ſhall endeavour to give you counſell from my Text; you know that godlineſſe and honeſtie is not alwayes a defence againſt debt; grace and goodneſſe may keepe a man from unthriftineſſe, but it doth not ever keepe a man from povertie; ſo that even the beſt, the holieſt, the honeſteſt men on earth may be in debt and deepe in arrerages, not through any laviſhneſſe or riot of expence (for Religion teacheth a good man to moderate his hands, and to ſpend within the proportion and compaſſe of his eſtate,) but other wayes by the inflicting or ordering hand of God upon him to trie him. Many

wayes there be to bring a man into debt, but there is but one way (that I know) to bring a man out of debt, and that is this that is chalked out here in my text, To ſerve and ſeeke the Lord. If God be truely ſerved, if the Lord be ſincerely ſought unto, let a mans eſtate be never ſo poore, his debts never ſo many, his dangers never ſo great, God will find a meanes to worke him out: as the Apoſtle Peter ſaith, 2 Pet. 
                     
                        •
                     . 9. The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation: though the godly know not how they ſhould poſſibly be delivered, yet God in his ſecret wiſedome knowes how to deliver them; ſo God knows how to deliver a poore man out of debt though he himſelfe know no evaſion, hath no meanes either in his power or in his view; God is never at a ſtand, never at a loſſe; if we know how to pray, he knowes how to helpe us.
                  What ſaid the man of God to Amaziah? 2 Chron. 25. 9. when he forbad him to take the Ephramites into the battell againſt the Edomites becauſe God was not with them: Amaziah asked him, what then ſhould become of the hundred talents which hee had given them for their helpe? Cannot God, ſaid the Prophet give thee more than this? ſo ſay I to him that trembles at the inundation of debt upon him; cannot God if hee were ſought unto give an iſſue out of this? cannot God (I ſay, if the ſtumbling-blocke of thy ſinne were taken out of the way by a ſound and ſerious humiliation,) cannot God give thee even more than that thou oweſt? cannot God doe more for thee than thou art aware of? aſſure thy ſelfe he can, nay aſſure thy ſelfe he will: Take not my word for it, but take the Apoſtles word, Phil. 4. 6.

or troubled in minde: and what is there in the world, what worldly thing (I meane) that more diſtracts and troubles an honeſt-minded man than the thought and conſideration of his debts and dangers: well, but is there no remedie, is there no reliefe for one in ſuch a caſe? yes, there is one univerſall remedie for all evils whatſoever, and that is humble prayer; that is the harbour we muſt put into in all our ill weather, and that is it the Apoſtle directs unto in the place-forecited; be carefull for nothing, but in every thing let your requeſt be made knowne unto God in ſupplication and prayer and giving of thankes, and the God of peace 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſhall keepe and guard your hearts as Kings are kept and guarded from all annoyances. This doe then, thou that art perplexed and intangled in a labyrinth of debt, that thou canſt find no outgate, no paſſage, no way to eſcape; down upō thy knees to God, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (as Chryſostome ſpeaks) unclaſpe thy conſcience before God, lay open thy grievances to him, unloade thy cares and wants and feares into the boſome of Ieſus Chriſt; and ifany meanes under heaven will eaſe and helpe thee, this will doe it. Beleeve it brethren, all worldly policies without this are but Arenaſine calce, ſand without lime; they wil never hold together when wee have moſt neede of them, but like untempered morter will fall aſunder: let earneſt prayer be joyned with frugalitie, skill and induſtrie, and then expect with comfort the end that God will give: and this is the way to make a poore man proſper.
                  I have but one thing more to move you in before I leave this point, and that is this, that you whom God hath already proſpered and bleſt and enabled to doe good, would be pleaſed and perſwaded to give ſomething

out of your plentie to the poore, and pious uſes, according as God hath proſpered you; it is the Apoſtles own word, 1 Cor. 16. 2. He would have every one lay up in ſtore by him to beſtow on the poore and needy according as God hath proſpered him; for the quantitie, God hath left it to every mans conſcience, onely in generall he is directed, 2 Cor. 9. to doe as God hath proſpered him: we ſhould doe therefore in this caſe, as the Iewes doe in another caſe, who becauſe they know not the preciſe time when the Sabbath ſhould begin and end, they beginne it an houre the ſooner and end it an houre the later: this they call, Additionem de prophano ad ſacrum, an addition from prophaneneſſe to holineſſe. I will not diſpute the lawfulneſſe of that act in particular, but generally in ſuch caſes as this, it is good for every man to doe rather with the moſt than with the leaſt: Quantiſcumque ſumptibus constet, lucrum eſt piet at is nomine facere ſumptus. Whatſoever coſt a man is at for pious and charitable uſes, it ſhall be a gaine unto himſelfe. We finde 1 Chron. 22. 14 when David had beſtowed all his coſt in preparation for the Temple (a hundred thouſand talents of gold, a thouſand thouſand talents of ſilver) thus he expreſt it; Ecce in paupertate meâ, this (ſaith he) I have done according to my poverty; as if he had ſaid, if I had beene able to doe more, I would have done more, but this was as much as I could reach to, and this (I truſt) God will accept: ſay not then in thy heart, if I were rich, If I were able I would doe thus and thus, but doe as God hath proſpered thee; if thou canſt not doe according to thy minde, doe according to thy meanes, and that is all that God requires: we read, Mat 21. when our Saviour came riding to Ieruſalem, ſome ſtrewed their garments in the

way, and ſome cut downe bowes and branches: If thou beeſt not able to ſtrew thy garments in the way of Chriſt (that is) to cloath his poore naked members, then cut downe bowes and branches at leaſt, ſpeake comfortable words to them, plead for them, and what thou wanteſt in ſubſtance, make up in prayer. You know the poore widdowes caſe in the Goſpell, that put her two mites into the poore mans box; our Saviour Chriſt affirmed that ſhe gave more than all the reſt, becauſe ſhee gave all that ſhee had: which teſtified (as one ſaith) not only her liberality to God, but her confidence in God, that ſhe did verily beleeve though ſhee left her ſelfe nothing, ſhe ſhould not lacke: whereupon Saint Auguſtine ſaith, Divites largiuntur ſecuri de divitiis, pauper ſecurus de Domino: a rich man gives and feares no want, becauſe hee knowes he hath enough at home: a poore man gives and feares as little, becauſe he knowes he hath enough above, there is one above will ſupply his wants.
                  Beleeve it brethren, he that gives any thing with a true intent to relieve the poore and to maintaine the diſtreſſed, ſhall doe himſelfe more good, than he doth them whom hee releeves; and I will prove it out of Deut. 15. 7. 10. If there be amo
                           •
                        g you a poore man, one of thy brethren within any of thy gates, thou ſhalt not harden thy heart, nor ſhut thy hand upon thy poore brother: but thou ſhalt ſurely give him; and thy heart ſhall not be grieved when thou giveſt unto him; becauſe that for this thing the Lord thy God ſhall bleſſe thee in all thy workes, and in all that thou putteſt thy hand unto. Contrariwiſe, he that is ſo gripple, and ſo baſe that he will part with nothing to the poore, let him know that in ſo doing he makes a forfeiture to God of all his goods, and God will be a

ſevere exacter of it at his hands when hee comes to judgement.
                  We have a preſident for it in the Goſpell, of the man that had a talent given him, and did not uſe it as hee ought; there came an extent from God, firſt upon the talent [Take away his talent from him] &amp; thē there came an extent upon his perſon too [Take away the unprofitable ſervant, bind him, and caſt him into utter darkeneſſe.] As S. Peter told Simon Magus, Thou and thy money periſh together; it had beene happie for him if nothing but his money had periſhed, but there comes an extent from God againſt all, Hee and his money muſt periſh together. As the Idolater (as one ſaid of Iulian) ſhall burne in hell with that ſame wood and ſtone that he adored and made a god of on earth: So the Vſurer and moneymonger, that hath no goodneſſe nor compaſſion in him, ſhall burne in hell with the ſame ſilver and gold that he made an idoll of here in this world. I will ſay no more but this, Shew mercy to the poore for Chriſts ſake, and Chriſt will ſhew mercy to you for the poores ſake. Doe good as God hath proſpered you, and then you fulfill the law of Chriſt.
                  I have done with the firſt generall point of my text, namely, the ground and foundation of true proſperitie, that it muſt be raiſed and built upon religion and pietie: God muſt be ſought unto, ere any true proſperitie can be attained unto. I will diſpatch the other part in a word or two, and ſo conclude. And that is the bounds and limitation of true proſperitie, how farre it reacheth, and how long it laſteth, and that is onely during the time that a man ſerves and ſeekes the Lord. So long as he ſought the Lord (ſo long, and no longer,) God made him to proſper.
                  
                  Secondly, So long. How long that was you may

ſee in the words before my Text (Hee ſought the Lord in the dayes of Zechariah, who had underſtanding in the viſions of God.) That wiſe and holy Prophet Zachariah was a happie tutor to the minority of K. Vzziah, and was alwayes at hand to counſel and adviſe him, to advertiſe &amp; admoniſh him in things pertaining to his God and his governement, and by his godly doctrine, and his holy life to guide and ſteere him the right way to happineſſe: now as long as Zechariah lived, during all his time he ſought the Lord and proſpered: but asſoone as Zechariah was gone and gathered to his fathers, it ſhould ſeeme that Vzziah began to fall away, and his proſperitie ſunke as faſt as his pietie: juſt like the waters of Noah's floud, as ſoone as ever the fountaines and ſprings began to be ſtopt, preſently the waters began to abate: ſo when the ſpring of grace begins to be ſtopt up in a mans heart, and damd up with wickedneſſe and ſinne, it is a venture but his proſperitie will abate and drie away, and his later end ſhall be worſe than his beginning. Here then (as in a mappe) we may ſee and bewayle the miſerable downe-fall of many Chriſtian ſoules, who during their minoritie and younger yeares, while they live under good Parents, good Tutors, and good Governors, they take good courſes and keepe themſelves in good order, but when ever they come to their owne hand, Sine cortice natare, to ſwimme without a corke, to ſaile without a ſterne, and to live without a guide and without a God; they runne many times headlong into ſuch deſperate licentious courſes, that a man that ſees them ſo bad at the laſt, would hardly beleeve they had ever beene good at the firſt. It is a good obſervation of a late Divine in the dayes of Popery and blindneſſe, the Divell it ſeemes walked very familiarly among them: hence

we have ſo many ſtories of hagges and fayries, and of children taken out of cradles and others laid in their roomes, and thoſe they called changelings: ſince the ight of the Goſpell hath ſhined ſo cleerely, theſe divels and fayries have not beene ſeene amongſt us; but ſtill there are changelings too too many in every place. Some the Prieſts and Ieſuites have changed from the true Religion, to Popery; ſome the world have changed from good neighbourhood and good hoſpitalitie to all manner of baſeneſſe and miſerie; ſome goodfellowſhip and the alehouſe hath changed from temperance and ſobrietie to prophaneneſſe and luxury; too many ſuch changelings there be in the world; God of his mercy change them againe, and transforme them into a better minde, ut mutati mutatum inveniant (as S. Bernard ſpeakes) that they being changed in affection to God-word, may finde God changed in affection to them-ward, to ſpeake after the manner of men; for if you marke the courſe of the world, obſerve it where you will, you ſhall never find that ſuch kind of perſons do proſper; as thoſe other changelings never proſpered in body, ſo theſe never proſper in eſtate, God gives a ſecret curſe unto them, that nothing that they have ſhall proſper with them: But they are like a man in a conſumption, howſoever he may bolſter up himſelfe for a time with Phyſicke and Diet-drinkes, it will kill him in the end: ſo he that is in a ſpirituall Atrophy, a ſpirituall conſumption, that is fallen from God, hee may goe on and hold out for a time, but it will undoe him in the end. Iuſt according to the ſaying of the Prophet Ionas, Chap. 2. 8. They that follow after lying vanities, forſake their owne mercy: that is, they wilfully deprive themſelves of that mercy and proſperite, which if they had cleaved and ſtucke unto God, they might have

beene as ſure of, as if it had beene their owne to beſtow upon themſelves, and that was King Vzziahs caſe.
                  For our ſelves therefore (to draw to an end) if wee deſire to goe on and proſper as wee have begun, that there may be no decay, no declining, no abatement, either in our pietie or in our proſperity, either in our inward graces or in our outward fortunes; let us labour for two things which King Vzziah wanted, ſincerity and humility.
                  Firſt, labour for ſincerity, be the ſame inwardly to God-ward, that you ſeeme to be outwardly to the world-ward, be like the curtaines of the Tabernacle, which they ſay were ſo wrought, that they were on both ſides alike; ſo be you alike on both ſides, in heart to the Lord, and in life to the world, elſe there is no hope of continuance; for nil fictum est duturnum, nothing that is counterfeit, will laſt long; counterfeit Pearls &amp; Diamonds may gliſter and ſparkle, and make a faire ſhew for a time, but their luſtre will not laſt; ſo where there is only an outward forme of godlineſſe and not the inward power of it, it cannot laſt long. If an apple be rotten at the core, though it have a fai e outſide, it will not continue ſo long, but rottenneſſe will poſſeſſe the outſide alſo; for this is the nature of things that are unſound, they ſt ay not there where the rottenneſſe began, but they putrifie and corrupt more and more: ſo thoſe that have rotten hearts to God-ward, may carry a faire ſhew for a time, but in the end the curſe of God will come upon them; and their very name ſhall rot, that is, their hypocriſie ſhall be diſcovered, and their outſide made as rotten as their inſide: Beware therefor of hyrocriſie and labour for ſincerity.
                  Secondly, pray for humility, that was another grace that King Vzziah wanted; it is ſaid of him, Verſ. 16.

of this Chap. That God helped him till he was ſtrong, and when hee was ſtrong, his heart was lifted up to his deſtruction, this was a lamentable thing, that a man in proſperity ſhould be ſo ſwolne with pride that hee ſhould even burſt againe; take heed of that, you whom God hath exalted above your fellowes; the Giants in old time were the goodlieſt men in the world, yet they are called in hebrew Naphilem of Naphel, to fall, becauſe as by their pride and preſumption they fell from God, ſo God in his juſtice tumbled them downe, that they fell without recovery into the pit of hell; thus (as the ſaying is) pride will have a fall, but humility ſhall have a riſe, Iob 22. 29. When men are caſt downe, then thou ſhalt ſay, &amp;c. When a man caſts downe himſelf in a voluntary humiliation, then God exalts and lifts him up, but when in a proud preſumption he exalts and lifts up himſelfe, then God dejects and caſts them down: it is a good meditation of S. Auguſtine upon the words of David, Pſal. 138. 6. The Lord is on high and he beholdeth the lowly, &amp;c. ſee a ſtrange wonder (ſaith hee) God ſits aloft in heaven, and yet the higher a man lifts up himſelfe, the further he is from God; the lower a man caſts downe himſelfe, the neerer he is to God. I will cloſe up all with that divine Epiphonema of holy Bernard: Dominus deus, qui das gratiam humilibus, da gratiam ut ſimus hum
                           •
                        les. O Lord God, thou that giveſt grace to the humble, give us grace to be humbled. And that for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, to whom with thee and the holy Spirit be given and aſcribed all honour and glory, be done and performed all ſervice and duty, from this time forth and for evermore,
                  Amen, Amen.

                  1. Diſciplina pacis, the diſcipline of peace, ſo the Scripture termes it, Eſay 53. 5. The diſcipline of our peace was upon him. (i) Chriſt was diſciplined and puniſht for us, that wee might have our peace without puniſhment. So ſome tranſlate that place, Pſal. 2. ult whereas we reade, oſculamini filium, Kiſſe the Sonne. (i) doe honour and homage to the Sonne of God; ſome render it Apprehendite diſciplinam (i) apprehend his Diſciplinē, obey his ordinances, and ſubmit your ſelves to his corrections, as he ſubmitted himſelfe to ours, and this in the end will worke for your peace. And to ſay the truth, A man can never attaine to a well-ſetled peace, nor grow up to a well-grounded contentation, till he have beene ſome way diſciplined by the hand of heaven, Heb. 5. 8 it is ſaid of our Saviour, Though he were a Sonne (the onely begotten Sonne of God, full of grace and truth) yet he learned obedience by the things which he ſuffered: not that he was diſobedient before he ſuffered; but the meaning is, though he had the habite of obedience before, hee never learned the practiſe of it till then. For this leſſon of contentment is juſt like your leſſons of Muſicke, a man can never be ſaid to have learned them till he be able to practiſe them, for you muſt know that Chriſtians are of two ſorts.
                  Some are ſilveſtres, or onagri, like wilde unruly Aſſes (ſo the Scripture termes them) Ioh 11, 12. I mean, unhumbled, untamed, unconverted ſinners, that never yet felt the Yoke of Chriſt, nor the hand of God, nor the heavineſſe of a wounded conſcience: theſe know no other Content, but what their ſports, their Muſicke and merry company affords them; which is juſt ſuch a kind of Content as they that have the Itch doe take in clawing and

ſcratching their bodies, which pleaſeth them infinitely for the preſent, but makes them the ſorer and the rawer, and the worſer afterwards: For ſo all ſinfull pleaſure ends in paine, and if there be not Ingrata recordatio, an unpleaſing, a diſcontenting remembrance of all ſuch pleaſing contenting vanities, the ſoule will rue for it in another place. Theſe may fitly be compared to the Lillies (which our Saviour ſpeakes of in the Goſpel, ſaying that Salomon in all his glory came not neere them) now the Lilly as long as it is faire, whole, and untoucht, it lookes beautifull, and ſmells pleaſantly; but let it be never ſo little nipt, or bruſed, or cruſht in a mans hand, it lookes ugly, and ſmells worſe: ſuch are all your joviall Gallants, and laſcivious youngſters, as long as they are healthfull and ſound and aile nothing, their onely care is to give themſelves content, by hunting and hawking, by dicing and carding, by drinking and drabbing▪ &amp;c. ſico ſic juvat vivere, to ſome mens thinking, no ſuch contenting life in the world as theirs: till theſe men fall into the hands of God (as ſooner or later they ſhall ſurely fall) and God doth begin to nip them and bruſe and cruſh them in his hands with ſickneſſe of body, or ſorrowes of ſoule; alas, all their Content is vaniſht and gone, and they become like Naomi in Bethlem, neither pleaſing to themſelves nor others. Theſe contentments are worme-eaten like Ionas Gourd, that will faile a man when hee ſtands moſt in need of them, and theſe kind of men are farre from that Content which my Text ſpeaketh of.
                  But there are another ſort of Chriſtians, and they are ſubacti, or Ablactati, mortified, ſubdued or weaned Chriſtians, ſuch as David was, Pſal. 131. 2. I have behaved my ſelfe like a child that is weaned, yea my ſoule is as a weaned child. A childe that ſucks, his whole delight is to be nibling at the breſt, nothing quiets, nothing contents him but that; but let him once be throughly weaned, and then though you ſhew him never ſo goodly a breſt, abounding with never ſo luſcious milke, and flatter him never ſo much, you ſhall not get him to take it, nor to touch it; for then his content lies in another kind, it is ſomthing els muſt quiet him▪ and not that: So it is with a mortified and an unmortified Chriſtian, nothing contents the one but the breſt of the world; nothing

leſſe than that contents the other: When the ſoule of a Chriſtian is once weaned and taken off from the follies and vanities of this life, that he begins to ſavour and ſet his mind upon the things that concerne a better life, he ſhall feele his diſpoſition alo
                        ••
                      within him, and ſhall find a more ſenſible content in enjoying his God, than any worldling upon earth either doth or can finde in enjoying his goods▪ as David affirmes, Pſa. 4. 8. Dediſti 
                           ••
                        titiam, &amp;c. Thou haſt put more gladneſſe in my heart, than in the time that their corne and wine and oyle increaſed: The meaning is, he tooke more delight and more content in the Law and favour of God, in the worſhip and ſervice of God, in converſing and walking with God; more, (I ſay) by farre, than the men of this world could take in their joyfulleſt times of all, when their corne and wine and oyle encreaſed. And this is the medulla the pith and marrow of that Chriſtian contentation, which is begun upon earth, and never ends in heaven. This is ſuch a happineſſe that none can attaine unto, but onely they that are Cribrati Chriſtiani (as Tertullian termes them) ſifted Chriſtians, they that have beene winnowed and fanned, and ſifted (as it were) by Gods afflictions, by the devils temptations, and by the worlds unkindneſſes; they that have beene toſſed and tumbled and beaten in the world, and have found by their owne experience, that there is no content to be had in any eſtate but onely from God, and that there is no eſtate but God may be had in, if a man will himſelfe; theſe are they that have learned (with S. Paul) in whatſoever ſtate they are, therewith to be content. And ſo I come more nearely to the firſt principall part of my Text, wherein are three remarkable points to be obſerved.
                  1 Sngularitas perſonae, the ſingularity and propriety of the perſon noted in the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , I have learned. 2 Specificatio temporis, the ſpecification or intimation of the time when hee learned it, noted in the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ; he doth not ſay I will learne tobe content, but I have learned; I have done it already, 3. Specialitas re
                           •
                        , the ſpecialty or excellency of the thing it ſelfe which S. Paul had learned and attained, and that was to be 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſelfe-ſufficient and what that meaneth you ſhall heare by and by.
                  
                     
1. Singularitas perſonae, I have learned. Some may happily conceit that S. Paul ſpeakes but this of his owne particular, that he for his part had learned to be Content, not that it is the common condition of every privat Chriſtian to be thus qualified, thus contented: Anſw. It is true, as S. Paul was an Apoſtle (and you know hee was a great Apoſtle, Apoſtolus per Antonomaſian called by the name of The Apoſtle in all our quotations of him) I ſay, as he was an Apoſtle he had his 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , his peculiar gifts and graces proper to himſelfe, not attaineable nor imitable by us: but that he ſpeakes here, he ſpeakes it as a Chriſtian, as a Convert, as a contented man, and that a grace thats common to every true beleever. The Scripture ſpeakes of a Common faith, Tit. 1. 4. becauſe it is common to all the faithfull; and ſo likewiſe of a Common ſalvation, Iude 3. becauſe it is common to all that ſhall be ſaved; which yet every Chriſtian muſt labour to make proper to himſelfe: ſo may this be called a Commmon contentment, becauſe it is ſuch as every common Chriſtian muſt apply to himſelfe, and is bound in conſcience to learne and practiſe for his owne particular, for the comfort and diſcharge of his owne ſoule in the ſight of God. It is worth your obſervation that of David, Pſal. 40. 6. where he ſaith of himſelfe, In the volume of thy booke it is written of me, that I ſhould do thy will; O my God I am content to do it: now let a man reade over the whole volume of Gods booke, he ſhall not find that tis written of David, that he by name ſhould doe the will of God more than another man. Why then doth David affirme this of himſelfe? Ile tell you what I thinke the reaſon may be: David found in the volume of Gods booke that it was thus written of men of his ranke and quality of Kings, Prophets, &amp;c. that they ſhould have a ſpeciall care to do the will of God, and to be exemplary in their lives to others, and this doth David appropriate and apply to himſelfe in particular as if it had beene thus written of him and none elſe but him. In like manner, when you reade in the volume of this booke that it is thus written of S. Paul, that he had learned to be Content, you muſt know that it is your caſe as well as his, and that you for your parts have as good cauſe, and as great reaſon (as ever David had) to apply this writing to your

ſelves, and ſay for your owne particular It is written of me, that I ſhould be content, O my God J am content to be ſo. It was good counſell that Eliphaz gave to Iob 5. 27. Heare this, and know it for thy good, (ſo we tranſlate it) but in Hebrew it is (dang-lecha) know it for thy ſelfe. It is not enough for a man to know this in generall, that ſuch a thing muſt be, that every man muſt be content with his eſtate, becauſe God will have it ſo; but a man muſt apply this knowledge to himſelfe in particular, and labour to work himſelf to ſuch an 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſuch an inward tranquillity and contentedneſſe of mind, that nothing that God ſends may come amiſſe to him. As S. Auſtin ſaid of Almes, Qui vult ordinatè eleemoſynas dare, deb et a ſeipſo incipere; He that will give Almes in a right and orderly manner muſt begin with himſelfe. How is that? Mendicat a te anima tua, eſurit juſtitian, &amp;c. Thy owne ſoule lies begging of thee, it hungers after righteouſnes, it thirſts after grace, its naked and wounded for want of ſpirituall cloathing and comfort; firſt begin with thy own ſoule, cheriſh that, comfort that, ſave and ſuccour that, ſhew mercy firſt to thy ſelfe, then ſhalt thou the better know and underſtand how to ſhew mercy and pitty to the bodies and ſoules of others. In like manner, He that would go the right way to true Contentment, muſt begin with himſelfe, firſt ſtudy his owne peace, ſubdue his own paſſions, quiet his owne mind, and content his owne ſoule; and when he hath done ſo, he may then happily make his own plaſter ſerve another ſores, and comfort others with the ſame conſolation wherewith himſelf hath formerly been comforted and contented: but that can he never doe, till he be able to ſay of himſelfe, what S. Paul doth in my text: How ever others be affected, I (for my part) have learned to be content. So much for the firſt particular, which is ſingularitas perſonae, the propriety of the perſon, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , I have learned, &amp;c. the next is,
                  2 Specificatio temporis, He doth not ſay, I will learne, but I have learned to be content. This is one of thoſe praecognita (as we call them) that muſt be knowne and learned aforehand, againſt the time that God will give occaſion to make uſe of them. As the Prophet Eſay exhorts, Eſay 42. 23. Hearken to this, and heare it for the time to come▪
                      though it may be for

the time preſent all things are ſo well with you, that you have no need, no uſe of this doctrine, yet the time may come (God knowes how ſoone) that you may be glad and thanke God that ever you heard it; doe not therefore heare it for the preſent onely (as moſt men doe Sermons) but heare it for afterward, and lay it up for the time to come. For as Tully ſaid of Poetry that it was a profeſſion for all times, proſperity and adverſity▪ for all ages, youth and old age; for all places, at home and abroad: ſo is this a leſſon for all times, all ages, and all places▪ and happy are they that have learned it aforehand, that they may not be to ſeeke when they ſhall ſtand moſt in neede of it, but have a ſalve in readineſſe for every ſore. Was not that a ſad and a lamentable diſtreſſe, that the people of Iſrael were driven to, 1 Sam. 13. 22. That in the day of battell there was neither ſword nor ſpeare found in the hand of any of the people, ſave onely in the hand of Saul and Ionathan: how did thoſe unarmed people (inermes in armis) tremble and quake to meete their enemies in the faces. Even ſuch is the caſe of an unprepared Chriſtian, when trouble comes upon him like an armed man, ſuddenly and unreſiſtably, what miſerable plunges muſt he needs be driven to, that hath not learned aforehand to be content with any fortunes, and to repoſe and rowle himſelfe upon his God in the worſt events. When the world is full of feares, and dangers, and calamities are ready to breake in upon a people, what a taking are they in that have not learned to be content; as David ſaith of thoſe in a ſtorme at ſea, Pſal. 107. 27. They are even at their wits end, ready to run mad, and goe beſides themſelves with aſtoniſhment and anguiſb of ſpirit: whereas they that have learned Saint Pauls leſſon in my text, can ſay to their ſoules as David did to his, Pſal. 116. Returne unto thy reſt, O my ſoule: they can readily turne themſelves to God, who is Centrum qu
                           •
                        
                        etativum (as the Schoolemen ſpeake) and there finde reſt unto their ſoules (like Noah in his Arke) when a world of others are overwhelmed with a floud of ſorrow. Beloved, we are not worthy to know for what we are reſerved, nor how God will pleaſe to deale with us; let our care be therefore (like Mariners at Sea) in a calme to provide for a ſtorme, in health provide

for ſickneſſe, and in peace prepare for trouble: that if any unexpected trouble ſhould ariſe, we may be able (with Gods mercy) to overcome it, and to wade contentedly and quietly through it; labour aforehand to ballaſt our ſoules with grace that we may hold out ſtedily, unmoveably in this troubleſome world. You know, that which muſt keepe a ſhip ſtiffe and ſteddy on the ſea, muſt not be levers and ſhores without it but weight and ballaſt within it: ſo that, that muſt keepe a mans mind and conſcience ſteddy and upright, that it doe not vacillare ſtagger and reele to and fro like a drunken man (as David ſpeakes) it is not wealth and meanes without a man, but grace and godlineſſe and contentment within him; A man ſhall never be quiet in his mind, never ſetled in his conſcience, but alwayes toſſed and turmoiled with doubts and cares and feares, till he hath learned this leſſon of the bleſſed Apoſtle, In whatſoever ſtate he is, therewith to be content.
                  
                  3. Specialit as rei, the excellency of the thing it ſelfe, expreſt in the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſelfe-ſufficient, if wee take the word in a ſtrict and proper ſence, none can properly and rightly be ſaid to be 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                     ▪ ſelfe-ſufficient but onely God. As our Saviour told the young man in the Goſpel, Marke 10. 18. when hee called him Good Maſter: why calleſt thou me good (ſaith Chriſt) there is none good but God: the meaning is, none that hath his goodneſſe in ſe, &amp; a ſe in himſelfe and from himſelfe, but onely God; all the goodneſſe that men have, comes downe from God as light doth from the Sunne, or water from the Spring (though Chriſt were God too) and therefore good, but that was more than the young man knew:) ſo there is none truely ſelfe-ſufficient but God onely that hath this ſufficiencie, this fulneſſe of content in, and from himſelfe without being beholding to any treature: man of himſelfe hath no ſufficiency, neither ſufficient meanes to maintaine him, nor ſufficient ſtrength to defend him, nor ſufficient grace to ſave him, but all our ſufficiency is from God; 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      who is ſufficient for theſe things? is as true in other caſes, as in the caſe of 
                        〈◊〉
                      Miniſtery: man of himſelfe without God is not ſufficient 
                        〈◊〉
                      any thing; as the Moone is but a darke body, if the Sunne

doth not looke upon it, ſo is a man but a dead creature if God do not worke in him, there is no light nor life in him. Yet ſuch is the goodneſſe of God 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      the good pleaſure of his will (as the Apoſtle calls it) that when a man can ſo farre deny himſelfe, ſo farre maſter and prevaile with himſelfe, as to ſuffice and content himſelfe with that dimenſum, that portion which God hath allotted and aſſigned him, be it more or leſſe, to eſteem it enough and ſufficient for him; ſuch a one doth God account a man like himſelfe, a man after his owne heart, a man that is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſelfe-ſufficient.
                  And here I may take up Moſes wiſh, and ſay, I would to God that all the Lords people were thus affected, and thus minded: Are your mindes ſet upon righteouſneſſe, O yee ſonnes of men? (ſaith David in the Pſalme.) No: we may anſwer, and experience ſheweth that mens mindes are ſet upon covetouſneſſe, they are ſet upon the world, they are ſet cleane croſſe and contrary to the rule and direction of Almighty God. For thus the caſe ſtands, where God would have men to be covetous, there they are content; and contrarily where God would have men to be content▪ there they are extreamely covetous. In ſome things God would have men to be covetous, 1 Cor. 12. ult. Covet earneſtly the beſt things: the things of this life are the worſt things in Gods account, howſoever wee eſteeme them; thoſe are the beſt things which belong and bring a man to a better life; and of theſe God would have us be as covetous as we can be for our lives. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      is the word, be earneſtly, eagarly covetous; never thinke you have faith enough, never thinke you have grace enough, never thinke ye have wiſedome and patience and godlineſſe enough; but ſtill labour, ſtill hunger after more; Herein exerce avaritiam tu
                           •
                        n (as Saint Auſtine ſpeaketh) if thou haſt any covetouſneſſe in thee, exerciſe it this way, ſet it a worke about thoſe things, for here a ſufficit is deadly, (as the ſame Father hath it.) See now our croſſeneſſe and perverſeneſſe to God, where we ſhould be covetous, here we are too well contented, if we have never ſo little grace, never ſo little faith▪ never ſo little religion, &amp;c. we are ready to ſay with Eſau, wee have enough to ſerve our owne

turnes, we neither covet nor deſire any more like that Monk in Saint Bernard, that ſet downe this for his reſolution, nec pejor fieri volo, nec melior cupio, I will be no worſe, neither doe I deſire to be better; and ſo they ſtand at a ſtay like dwarfes, and never ſeeke to encreaſe their talent. Iuſt of Gallioes temper, Act. 18. 17. Nihil eorum Gallioni curae, Gallio cared for none of thoſe things; nor doe we care for any of theſe things; where wee ſhould be carefull, wee are careleſſe, and too well contented, where we ſhould be covetous. Thus wee croſſe God on the one ſide, by being content where we ſhould be covetous.
                  See now how we croſſe him on the otherſide, by being covetous where we ſhould be contented. As firſt in the mattter of ſinne: A man that hath beene 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      a lover of pleaſure, more than a lover of God, and hath followed the luſts, devices and deſires of his owne heart a long time together, God would have ſuch a one to leave while he is well, to repent himſelfe, and content himſelfe with what is done and paſt, and to ſinne no more, leaſt a worſe thing than he is aware of, fall upon him, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      &amp;c. (ſaith the Apoſtle) 1 Pet. 4. 3. Let the time paſt of life ſuffice us, to have walked in laſciviouſneſſe, luſts, exceſſe of wine, revellings, banquettings, and abominable Idolatries: marke the word, let it ſuffice, or let it content you to have ſpent ſo much of your life in this ungodly and unprofitable manner: as if hee ſhould have ſaid: yee have done enough, you have had pleaſure and ſinne enough, leave while ye are well, be content now to breake off that courſe, and begin a new one. A man would thinke ruch meeke, much moving counſell muſt needs take good effect: yet tis ſtrange to ſee how unreaſonable, how unſatiable men are in this kind, they can ſet no bounds to their appetites, no ſtint nor meaſure to their ſinnes: they can never tell when they have ſinned enough, never tell when they have drunke enough, never tell when they have angred God enough; but as the Apoſtle ſaith, Epheſ. 4. 19. They commit uncleanneſſe even with greedineſſe, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (as the originall word) with covetouſneſſe: no griping worldling is more greedy and covetous of money, than a wicked man is greedy and covetous of ſinne, that hee can never ſee when hee

hath enough of it; but ſtill goes on to adde ſinne unto ſinne, drunkenneſſe to thirſt, &amp; as a covetous man treaſures up wealth, ſo doth a wicked man treaſure up wrath for himſelfe againſt the day of wrath▪ 
                     Rom. 2. 5. Craſtinum peccatum hodiè dilinquunt (as Greg. Niſſen ſaid of the richman in the Goſpel) They ſinne to day for to morrow.
                  
                  They ſtudy and deviſe and plot their ſinne afore-hand, as if our Saviours ſaying were not ſo, Mat. 6. ult. Sufficient for the day is the evill thereof. Alas beloved, the beſt day that a man ſpends, or that day that a man ſpends beſt, he commits evils and ſinnes enough to repent of that day (Ile warrant him) he ſhall neede no more to trouble him; yea, and happy too if he can make even with God at night. He ſhall not neede to be ſo covetous ſo greedy of ſinne, he ſhall one day have enough of it; perhaps ere he be aware, he ſhall one day finde what it is for a man to ſinne in ſuo aeterno, when he comes to rue for his ſinnes, in Dei aeterno. He that would ſinne everlaſtingly, if he might live everlaſtingly, it is juſt with God that he ſhould ſuffer everlaſtingly: Thus will God croſſe ſinfull men, as bad as ever they croſt him, and teach them to be covetous where they ſhould be contented.
                  Thus likewiſe do men deale with God for the things of this life; God is all for contentedneſſe, and we are all for covetouſneſſe. God ſaith, If you have but food and raiment (though yee have little or nothing elſe) yet be content with it. 1 Tim. 6. for why? it is more than we deſerve, more than we are worthy of, more than God owes us, if he allow us but that. Yea, if we have but our daily bread (as our Saviour tearmes it) if God ſhould ſo reſtraine us in our diet, and cut us ſhort in our proviſion, as to allow us no more but bare bread, we have reaſon to be content with it, for we have that we prayed for; if God afford us more, we are bound to be the more thankfull, conſidering (with Iacob) that we are leſſe than the leaſt of all Gods mercies: there is not the leaſt of Gods mercies but it is too great and too good for us. And yet tis ſtrange to ſee how few there be, that thinke ill of themſelves, and well of their eſtates; I meane, that are well contented with Gods allowance; but rather with the Prophets wife, 2

                     Reg. 4. 6. who deſired one veſſell more when all was full before. Nay ſome are ſo unreaſonable and unſatiable, that as the Prophet ſaith, they enlarge their deſire as hell: ſome mans minde is like hell it ſelfe, which though it ſwallow up a world of ſoules, yet tis never ſatisfied, but ſtill gapeth for more: that is the reaſon ſuch a one can never be contented, becauſe though he may have a houſe full of money, he can never have a heart full of money, for why? He hath a hell in his heart, that never can be filled with meanes nor monies. Why hath Satan filled thy heart (ſaith Peter to Ananias, when he lied to the holy Ghoſt to ſave his money, Act. 5. 3. There is the hell in the heart, that mans heart which is filled with the devill, filled with covetouſneſſe and ungodlineſſe muſt needs have a helliſh heart; yea his heart is a hell it ſelfe, the very habitation and houſe of devils, and woe be to that ſinne that brings a hell into a mans heart in this world, and brings a mans heart and ſoule into hell in the world to come. Thus you ſee what comes of being covetous where God would have men to be contented. Learne therefore from henceforth to ſet bounds to thy appetite to moderate your cares for the things of this life, and to frame your deſires to Gods appointment, and that is the way to be content.
                  
                  I have not yet done with this point, for as I ſearched more narrowly into the originall word, I found that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      goes before 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that ſelfe goes before ſufficient: which put me in mind of another conſideration, and that is this, namely: That a man muſt be himſelfe ere he can be ſufficient▪ I meane, a man can never attaine to any true, reall ſufficiencie or contentment of mind, till firſt he be himſelfe. Every man is not himſelfe; not onely fooles and mad men and drunkards are not themſelves (as we ſay) not their owne men; but every unconverted, unhumbled, unwakened ſinner. As it is ſaid of the Prodigall ſonne, Luke 15. 17. that when he was converted, Then he came to himſelfe; which implies that before that time when he lived in riot, and exceſſe, and in that waſtfull way of wickedneſſe, when he was glad to feede upon thoſe ſiliquae daemoniorum thoſe huskes of Devils which the text ſpeakes of: all that while he was not himſelfe, he never began to come to himſelfe, till he began to come to his father: ſo to

ſpeake properly, a man never comes to himſelfe, till hee come home to God by true repentance, he is never his own man, til he be the Lords. Three things there be that make a man not himſelf, and conſequently make him unſufficient and uncapable of true contentment. 1 Nabals drunkenneſſe. 2 Nebuchadnezzars madneſſe. 3 Satans villenage. That's the reaſon that the Scripture cō
                     pares unregenerate men to drunkards, and mad men, and ſlaves, who of all others are truely ſaid to be not themſelves. S. Paul ſaith, 2 Tim. 2. 25. that a Miniſter that hath to doe with refractory ſinners, muſt waite if at any time God will give them repentance, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that they may awake out of their drunken ſleepe and become ſober (ſo the word ſignifies:) implying that as long as we muzzle our ſelves in our ignorance, and goe on ſecurely in our ſinnes, not grieving for them, not ſtriving againſt them, not making conſcience to reforme them, all that while we are like drunken ſots void of underſtanding, we are not our ſelves. As there is a wet drunkenneſſe, too common in theſe dayes, God forgive the world that ſinne; ſo there is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a kinde of dry drunkenneſſe (as the Prophet ſaith in another ſenſe, Eſay 51. 21. Thou art drunke, but not with wine.) Every ſin that a man is bewitched unto, doth for the time ſo infatuate and beſot him, that he is not himſelfe, hath not power over himſelfe, to refraine or repent of it, till God awake a man out of this ſame drunken ſleepe, and give him wiſedome to ſee into his ſins, and grace to forſake them; Then, and not till then doth hee come to himſelfe. Now as ſome are not themſelves through drunkennes; ſo others are not themſelves through madneſſe. The heart of man (ſaith Salomon, Eccleſ. 9. 3.) is full of evill and madneſſe is in his heart while he lives. Now mad men are of two ſorts. 1. Some are furentes furious or raging mad: like thoſe Phariſees, Luke 6. 11. that were filled with madneſſe at the ſight of the miracles which Chriſt wrought; or like thoſe that ſtoned Stephen, Act. 7. 54. They gnaſhed upon him with their teeth▪
                      
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (is the word) they grated and ground their teeth at him, as if they had bin cutting with a ſaw (for ſo the word ſignifies) they were ſo mad and devilliſh, that they could have found in their hearts to have ſawed him &amp; torne him with their teeth.

Such mad men as theſe, let them be never ſo little ſtirred, or provoked, or croſt either by God or man, how bitterly doe they curſe &amp; ſweare, and rage and damne themſelves to the pit of hel, that it would make a mans heart ake, and his ſoule tremble to heare and ſee it, for feare leaſt God ſhould take them at their words, Curſed be their anger for it is fierce, and their rage, for it is cruell, Gen. 49. 7. 2. Others are Amentes, fooliſhmad, I have ſaid of laughter, thow art madneſſe, (faith Salomon) is it not a mad thing for a man to laugh when he ſhould weepe, to ſing and ſhoute when hee ſhould ſob and ſigh, to make himſelfe merry with that which makes God and his Angels ſorry? Though we account this cheerefulneſſe, the holy Ghoſt accounts it madneſſe, Lachrimanum cauſas tripudiantes peragunt, &amp; ridentes mortis negotium exequuntur, (ſaith a Father) They that make a ſport of ſinne, doe but dance a Galliard about the brinke of hell▪ and if that be not the madneſſe of folly, judge yee. Too many ſuch mad men there are in th
                        •
                      world of both theſe ſorts and kinds, I pray God of his mercy convert them, and bring them into a better minde, that they may▪ſee and bewaile their owne▪ miſerable eſtate through ſin before God, and ſo may come to themſelves, for yet they are not themſelves, and conſequently can never attaine to any true contentment. Adde hereunto, thoſe that are the ſervants and ſlaves, the drudges and vaſſals of ſinne and Sathan. You know a ſervant is totius alterius, is not his owne man, is not a man of himſelfe: Even ſo, and more than ſo, is he that is a ſervant of ſinne. My brethren (ſaith S. Iames) he not many maſters, Iam. 3. 1. every man naturally hath 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , many maſters, in himſelfe, every temptation, every ſinne, every luſt, is a wicked mans maſter; pride comes and that maſters him, then comes anger and that maſters him; then comes covetouſneſſe, or worldlineſſe, or filthy uncleanneſſe, all theſe get the maſtery of him, and keepe them in ſubjection that he is not himſelf. O quam multos dominos habet qui unum not habet, Oh how many maſters and Lords hath that man, that hath not thee O God, for his Lord and maſter! the very devill himſelfe is his maſter, yea more than that, he is his God: therefore he is called the god of this world, 2 Cor. 4. 4. And why the god of this

world? mee thinkes that ſhould be too high, too happy, too honourable a title for ſo baſe a fiend: doubtleſſe the reaſon is this: becauſe as God at the beginning, did but ſpeake the Word and it was done, Gen. 1. ſo if the devill doth but ſpeake the word (as it were) but give the leaſt hint of any ſinne, that hee would have committed and done, preſently they doe 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſeeke opportunity to bring it to paſſe: at ſuch a becke are wicked men to the mortall enemy of their ſoules.
                  Can any man ſay, or doth any man thinke that theſe men are themſelves, or that they can enjoy true contentment? Alas no▪ for their caſe is juſt as the Iſraelites was in Aegypt, who when they had wrought hard in the brick-killns all day were well whipt and beaten for their labours at night: or as Sampſon among the Philiſtims, who after he had laboured and ground like a horſe in the mill all day, was put into the priſon houſe at night▪ And what content could either of theſe take in their worke or in their wages? Thus will Sathan ſerve them that ſerve him; after they have wrought hard in the workes of darkeneſſe the whole day of their lives, when the night of death comes (without great mercy on Gods part, and great repentance on their owne part) they ſhall be ſure to be caſt into the priſon of hell, and there whipt and tormented everlaſtingly for their paines. And if there be any content in ſuch worke, or in ſuch wages, judge ye. By this you perceive there is more belongs to ſelfe-ſufficiency, than perhaps you are aware of; there may be ſelf-love, ſelf-will, or ſelf-pleaſing, or ſelf-conceit, where there is no true grace nor feare of God: but there wil be no ſelf-ſufficiencie, no ſolid contentment, till a man be delivered from Nabals drunkenneſſe, from Nebuchadnezzars madneſſe, and from Satans villinage, and ſo be truly converted, and come to himſelfe; for there muſt be a converſion, before there can be any contentation, never looke to be contented, till firſt thou be converted, and come home to God, and to thy ſelfe; for 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      muſt be before 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , ſelfe, before ſufficient.
                  Hence then I obſerve foure corollaries or ſingular circumſtances touching the nature and quality of this ſelfe-ſufficiencie; that it is,
                  
                     
1. Res ſeria, a ſerious thing; as Seneca ſaid of true joy, (mihi creds, res ſevera eſt verum gaudium) ſo may I ſay of true contentment, it is not a light and frothy, but a grave and weighty thing; he that would be truely contented, muſt ſit downe and conſider ſeriouſly with himſelfe, in what tearmes hee ſtands with God: for ſuch as a mans conſcience is to Godward, ſuch is his contentment to himſelfe-ward. There is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God, Eſay 57. 21. a wicked man can have no comfort nor content, Why? For hee is like the troubled ſea whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt (ſaith the Prophet in the ſame place;) and why like the troubleth ſea, and not like the troubled aire for the ſame wind troubles both? The reaſon is becauſe when the aire is troubled, if the wind doe but ceaſe, it is preſently calmed; ſo is the heart of a godly man, when his troubles are over, his heart is preſently at reſt; but a wicked mans heart is like the ſea; which when the winds are layed, and there is no outward thing to trouble it, it ſtill workes and foames, and troubles it ſelfe with its owne motion; ſo though a wicked man have nothing outwardly to trouble him, yet his owne unquiet heart troubles it ſelfe, and will not ſuffer him to be at peace. Take this for a Maxime, that a wicked man can never be a contented man. Try thy ſelfe therefore whether thou be filius pacis a ſonne of peace, or filius irae a child of wrath; looke well into thy ſelfe to ſee how the caſe ſtands betwixt thy ſoule and thy God: if upon inquiry thou findeſt that God and thee are friends then goe thy way (as Solomon ſaith Eccleſ. 9. 7.) Eate thy bread with joy, and drinke thy wine with a merry heart, for God now accepteth thy workes: if otherwiſe thou be one that liveſt at variance with God, then change thy note and ſay, Droope O my ſoule, hang downe thy head and heart, be in bitterneſſe of ſpirit: Inhaere poenitentiae uſque ad finem vitae (Amb.) repent and mourne to the very death, never ſuffer one chearefull thought in thy heart, one cheerefull looke in thy face, one chearefull word in thy mouth, till thou haſt reconciled thy ſelfe to God, and make thy peace with heaven; never ſeeke to give thy ſelfe content, till firſt thou haſt given thy God content, for all the ſinnes wherewith thou

haſt grieved and diſcontented him. Let no man therefore be miſtaken in the matter of contentment, to thinke that it is a wanton and a laſcivious thing; he that truely learnes it ſhall find that it is Res ſeria, a weighty and a ſerious thing.
                  2. It is Res ſacra, a holy thing, therefore the Apoſtle, 1 Tim. 6. 6. joynes Godlineſſe and contentment together; to ſhew that none can be a contented man, but hee that is a godly man. A ſtranger (ſaith Salomon) doth not intermeddle with this joy, Prov. 14. 10. he that is a ſtranger to God, and a ſtranger to godlineſſe, hath nothing to doe with true contentedneſſe. In which reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith, that God giveth to the godly 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , all things richly to enjoy, 1 Tim. 6. 17. It is one thing to uſe a thing, another to enjoy it; a wicked man may uſe the creatures, and the ordinances and beſſings of God, but he cannot be ſaid to enjoy them; for that imports a ſweete and ſanctified uſe of them, which is the gift of God only to them that are godly: and it is certaine, no man in the world takes ſo much content in his meates and drinkes, and lawfull recreations, as a godly man doth, for he enjoyes God in all theſe. Contrarily, The joy of the wicked (ſaith Salomon elſewhere) hath a ſnare in it; (i) a ſecret guiltineſſe of ſinne that ſtrangles all their mirth, ſo that even in laughter their hearts are heavie. It followes then, that as that was the beſt wine that was of Chriſts making, Iohn 2. when he turned the water into wine; ſo that is the beſt content that is of Gods making, when he turnes our carnall joy into a ſpirituall joy, and mingleth heavenly content with earthly. Let no man therefore have a miſopinion of contentment, as if it were a ſenſuall or carnall thing, for he that truely underſtands it, ſhall find that it is Res ſacra, a ſacred and holy thing.
                  3. It is Res pretioſa, a precions thing, not onely as tis ſaid, 1 Sam. 3. 1. That the word of God was precious in thoſe dayes, that is, rare, unuſuall, and ſeldome heard of: for ſo is contentment too, it is a rare thing to finde a contented man; but it is Rarum and Charum too, not onely precious for the rarity and ſtrangneſſe of it, but for the worth and excellency of it. as the bloud of Chriſt is called precious bloud, for the worth and excellency of it, above all other bloud, for one drop of it was able to

redeemē a world in this ſence is true content a precious thing; its indeed the onely 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      the only heaven upon earth that this world affords, without which a man is even dead while he liveth and many times through griefe and diſcontent, is even ready (as Iob ſpeakes) to chuſe ſtrangling and death, rather than life, Iob. 7. 15. Let a mans houſe be never ſo well ſituated, never ſo well furniſht, and fairely built, if he have no content in it, it is but (as the Citty of refuge was ſayd to be) 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      a priſon without fetters, though it be not a place of durance, tis a place of bondage to him. Let a mans wife be never ſo vertuous, if he have no content in her, ſhe is but 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , like a ſnake in his boſome, a continuall heart-ſore and vexation to him; though a man have many children and meanes enough to leave them, if he have no content in them, they will be to him (as Jacoh ſayd of Simeon and Levi) a meanes to bring downe his hoary head with griefe and ſorrow to the grave. Let a mans table be never ſo richly deckt, (as David ſpeakes) if he have no content in it; it is but with him, as it was with the Iſraelites, when God gave them Quailes to eate, but ſent cleanneſſe withall into their ſoules. All your Cupboards of plate without contentment, are but (as Moab was ſaid to be Olla lotionis) no better than waſhpots, or as the prophet expreſſeth it, They are veſſels wherein there is no pleaſure. In a word, there is no earthly bleſſing within doore or without, that is of any price, or worth, or value, to a man, except it have contentment joyned with it. Therefore judge ye, whether it be not Res pretioſa, a rare and precious thing. If thou ſeparate the precious from the vile, thou ſhalt bee as my mouth (ſaith God, Ier. 15. 19.) there is a vile, a baſe contentment that conſiſts in ſenſuality and beaſtly luſts, when men like Swine lye and wallow in the myre of their owne ſinnes; but ther's another contentment, when a man like Enoch can walke with his God; and enjoy the comfort of a good conſcience to himſelfe; and this is that which I terme pretious.
                  4. Laſtly, tis Res petenda, a thing to be prayed for. For this ſhall every one that is godly, make his prayer unto thee, (ſaith David Pſal. 32. 6.) for other things the prayers of the godly differ, and very exceeding much; one prayes for faith, another for patience,

another for wiſedome, &amp;c. according as every one knowes the ſtate of his own ſoule, &amp; the neceſſities of his own life: but this is ſuch a 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , ſuch a univerſall good thing that every one that is godly wil be ſure to pray for, though they differ in other things; in this they all agree, all their prayers jumpe and meete in this center; there is not a godly man upon earth, but he doth heartily deſire of God, that if God will not give him meanes to live richly, nor health to live ſoundly, yet that he would give him grace to live contētedly. Super hoc, for this ſhal every one that is godly make his prayers unto thee. It is indeed a grace that comes immediatly from God, as the Apoſtle implyeth in the next verſe to my text; having ſaid here; he had learned to be content; hee uſeth another expreſſion there▪ and ſaith 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , I am Divinely taught, or I am taught of God to be content: it is not mans teaching then, but Gods teaching, his inward effectuall working that muſt learne a man the Art of contentation. Non lectio ſed unctio (as S. Bernard ſpeakes) tis not all the reading in the world that can bring a man to it, but tis that ſame Annointing (which the Scripture ſpeakes of, 1 Iohn 2. 27.) that muſt ſupple and ſoften a mans heart, and make him pliable to any condition. A man muſt be 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , inwardly taught and wrought of God, before he can come to the true underſtanding and application of it to himſelfe. It is true, that all other bleſſings beſides this, doe come from God, but not ſo immediatly as this grace doth: if a man want money, friends may ſupply him; if he want counſell, the Lawyers may helpe him; if he ſtand in need of phyſicke, there be thoſe that can doe him eaſe; but if he want a heart to ſive comfortably, and grace to live contentedly, it is God alone that can furniſh him therewith. Hes is the God of all Grace (as S. Peter cals him, 1 Pet. 5.) he hath the treaſury, the monopoly of it in his owne hands: want you wiſedome? want you faith? want you contentment? &amp;c. to him you muſt repaire: It is Hee that giveth his beloved ſleepe (as David ſpeaketh▪) He that would ſleepe quietly, and awake contentedly, muſt be a ſuter to God; Contentment will not come alone, tis Res petenda, a thing to be prayed for, and happy are we, that we may have it for praying.
                  And here I cannot but commend unto you the prayer of Agur
                     
for this very thing, Prov. 30. 8. that holy man knew that if the world afforded any perfect contentment, it was in a middle eſtate, equally diſtant from penury and from exceſſe: he knew it was a hard matter for a man that is either very poore or very rich, to live contentedly: therefore he deſired of God to give him neither poverty nor riches, but to feede him with food convenient for him. That God would grant him ſuch an indifferent, ſuch a midling eſtate, that he might neither be ſo poore as to be deſpiſed, nor ſo rich as to be envied, but onely ſo happy as to be contented: this was the ſumme and ſubſtance of his prayer. Give mee leave, I beſeech you, to make a little digreſſion upon it; I hope it ſhall be no tranſgreſſion, neither to your patience, nor to my purpoſe, becauſe it is ſo agreeable and ſutable to my text. There you may ſee the two extreames of this vertue; poverty on the one ſide, and riches on the other, (like the two theeves in the Goſpell) and contentment (like our Saviour Chriſt) in the midſt betweene them both.
                  The firſt extreame, or enemie to contentment, is Poverty, though it pleaſe God to lay poverty upon ſome men (I ſuppoſe) for their ſoules good; that by being poore in purſe they may learne to be poore in ſpirit, that ſo being wretched one way, they may come to be bleſſed another way: for bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit, Mat. 5. Yet you would not thinke how hard a thing it is for a man that lives very poorely, to live very contentedly. But I will give you my reaſons for it, and they are foure.
                  1. Propter inediam, for the famine and hunger that poore people 
                        •
                     ndure in theſe times of dearth &amp; ſcarcity, which rich ones neither feele nor feare. As it was with Ioſeph, Gen. 37. 25. His brethren ſate down to eate and, drink, &amp; be merry, while poore Ioſeph lay pining and ſtarving in the pit: and to that the Prophet Amos alludes, blaming thoſe that lived at eaſe in Sion, and were not ſorry for the afflictions of Joſeph; ſuper contrituram Ioſephi, ſome render it for the threſhing and ſ
                        •
                     ayling of Ioſeph. How many poore Ioſephes are there in this kingdome, that are faine to threſh and ſlaile; to work and toyle from morne to night, and all they can doe, all they can earne, will hardly buy

bread for their poore wives and children. In all the Lamentations of Ieremy there's nothing more lamentable than this, Lam. 4. 4. Parvuli panem petunt, &amp;c. The little children cried and died for bread, and there was not one that could breake it to them. Bleſſed be the Lord, it is not ſo in this City, your plenty, your bounty, your mercy hath provided better for poore children than ſo; and I doubt not but the promiſe, the grace, the glory of God will reward and crowne you for it; but let me tell you (beloved) in the countrey abroad, where no ſuch proviſions are, you would bleſſe your ſelves to heare and ſee and know, how hardly the poore doe fare, how wretchedly, how miſerably they live▪ having no more, but as they ſay of priſoners pittances 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , it will neither keepe them alive nor ſuffer them to dye; ſo much as by the mercy of God will hold life and ſoule together, and that is all. And if it be an eaſie matter for ſuch to be contented, judge ye: When a mans wife ſhal cry, his children cry, his cattell (if he be worth any) ſhall cry and lowe and bleate for want of food, and a man hath it not to give them; Oh my brethren, this cuts, this wounds, this peirceth to the very heart and ſoule. No marvell then that Agur prayed to God, Hee might not come to poverty, Propter inediam, for the hunger that the poore doe ſuffer.
                  2. Propter injuriam, for the injuries and wrongs that poore people ſuffer from rich oppreſſors, &amp; are not able to right themſelves. The Prophet David ſaith, Pſal. 10. 9. They raviſh the poore when they get him into their nets. What are the Nets of rich men? but their bonds, their debts, their morgages; as Saint Chryſoſtom ſaith, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , You bring us into writings that are ſtronger than any iron chaines. Theſe be the nets of rich oppreſſors, their writings and obligations: Now when they get a poore man into theſe nets, how doe they uſe them? David ſaith, they doe not onely rob them, but Raviſh them: You know Raviſhing is a diſhoneſty joyned with violence and cruelty: ſo the meaning is, when they get a poore man into their debts and dangers, that he is hampered and entangled in their nets, they uſe him diſhoneſtly, and they uſe him cruelly too; there is▪ neither equity nor mercy to be had at their

hands. Elſewhere David termes them 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , men-eaters, Chriſtians in name, but Canibals indeed, Pſal. 14. 14. They eate up my people, as they eate bread▪
                      they doe not onely nip them and bite them by their uſury (as you know uſury in Engliſh, is biting in Hebrew, ſo the word meſheck ſignifieth) I ſay, they doe not onely bite them by their uſury, but they devoure and eate them up by their extortion: They eate up my people as bread, (i.) they make no more conſcience to undoe a poore man, than they make conſcience to eat a meales meate when they are hungry. Beleeve it, theſe men are no better than murtherers in Gods account; for a poore mans ſubſtance is termed his life in Scripture: in the Goſpel it is ſaid, Mark 12. ult. that the poore widdow caſt into the treaſury 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Her whole life, (i) her whole ſubſtance. So Luke 8. 43. it is ſaid of the woman that had an iſſue of bloud 12. yeares, that ſhe ſpent 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Her whole life, meaning her whole living, upon the Phyſitians: They then that take away a poore mans ſubſtance, doe in effect, and in Gods account take away his very life, and ſo are murtherers. For a poore man in his houſe is like a ſnaile in his ſhell, cruſh that, and you kill him. In another place it is ſaid, They grind the faces of the poore: that is, they uſe them as cruelly and unmercifully, as if they ſhould take a poore mans face and grind it on a grindſtone. Now if this be not an enemy to a poore mens content, judge ye: therfore Propter injuriam, for the wrongs that poore people ſuffer, and cannot right themſelves; Lord (ſaith Agur) let me not come to poverty.
                  
                  3. Propter infamiam, for the reproach, the ſcorne and contempt that is incident to man of poore eſtate; let a poore man be never ſo honeſt, never ſo modeſt, never ſo vertuous, yet the world regards neither his vertues nor him, but doth 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      looke over him, or diſdainefully upon him, as the Phariſee did upon the Publican, Luke 18. when in contempt hee called him Iſte publicanus, this Publican, this baſe inferiour fellow, who was a better man to God-ward than himſelfe. Saint Iames knew the guiſe of the world and obſerved it. Chap. 2. 2. that if there come one into your houſes 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      with a gold ring, and gorgeous apparrell, ſuch a one is accepted and entertained

with all reſpect; but let there come in a poore man 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      in vile raiment, or in a poore habit, he is deſpiſed and bid ſtand behind the doore. Looke into Luke 15. 30. you ſhal ſee a true image of the rich churles of theſe times: when the poore Prodigals wings were clipt, his meanes was waſted that he was glad to ſeeke reliefe in his fathers houſe, though his good father kindly embraced and entertained him: (as God doth all repenting ſinners) yet his elder brother would not owne him, but called him in diſdaine, This thy ſonne: not this my brother, but this thy ſonne, as if hee had beene nothing of kinne to him, becauſe he was growne into poverty, and driven by neceſſity to make bold with his friends: had he come home richly attired or bravely attended, or ſufficiently monied; then no doubt) hee ſhould have beene his brother, as welcome to him as to his father; but becauſe hee was beggerly, bare and poore, he was but 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     this thy ſonne. O nimis inimica amicitia, (ſaith a father) Oh the too friendleſſe friendſhip of this world, that want of meanes ſhould cauſe want of love, that a man ſhould be valued, not according to that which hee hath, but according to that which he hath not. I beſeech you take it into your conſideration, whether it be not a hard matter for a man to be well contented, that ſhall, ſee himſelfe deſpiſed and undervalued: and then judge whether a man hath not reaſon to pray as Agur did, Lord let me not come to poverty▪ 
                     propter infamiam, for the contempt and ſcorne that poore men are ſubject to.
                  4 Laſtly, propter imbecillitatem, for the frailty and weakeneſſe of our corrupted nature, which is ſuch that if our mean
                        •
                     s begin to faile us, our faith in God is ready to faint and faile us too. Though God would have us live by faith, Heb. 10. 38. yet alas we count that but a poore kinde of living; and as long as we can either live by our meanes, or live by our friends, or live by our wits, or live by our ſhifts, as long as we can live any way, we will hardly be brought to live that way, to live by our faith in Ieſus Chriſt. It fares with us for the moſt part as it did with Hagar, Gen. 21. 15. as long as her bread and her bottle held out, ſo long ſhe was reaſonably well content▪ we

heare no complaint, no moane that ſhe made; but as ſoone as ever theſe were waſted and ſpent and done, preſently ſhe falls a crying out, ſhe was undone, ſhe and her child muſt die, there was no more hope. Thus it fares with us▪ as long as our meanes and monies hold, we can be indifferently well content▪ God Almighty ſeldome heares of us, but if theſe be exhauſted and gone, we are preſently out of heart, wee thinke there is no way but one with us: we and our children muſt periſh, there is no other hope: unleſſe God open our eyes, as he did the eyes of Hagar, to ſee the fountaine of his goodneſſe that is ever at hand to ſupply the poores neceſſities; and when we are quieted. Beloved, it is an eaſie matter for a man to pray for his daily bread, when hee hath it in his cupboard; but when our owne proviſions faile us, then to rely and reſt upon the proviſions of God, that is the triall of a Chriſtians faith. It is an eaſie matter to ſwim in a warme bath, every weakling, every impotent body can doe that; but he that can hold up his head in a dangerous ſea, when every wave is ready to abſorpe and ſwallow him up, that is the triall of a mans ſtrength and life: ſo it is an eaſie matter to be content in a plentifull eſtate, where there's no want, no lack of any thing, but for a man to be caſt as it were into a ſea of troubles, where ſo many wants like ſo many waves, come daily beating and breaking in upon him; then to hold up his head with content and confidence in God, there's the touchſtone of an undiſſembled faith indeed. You that never yet felt any want, little doe you know what plunges poore men are driven to in the time of need; therefore ſince God in mercy doth not make you to know their miſeries by experience, I would have you to know it by fellow-feeling; that you may learne of Agur to deſire of God not to bring you to poverty, propter imbecillitatem, for the weakeneſſe of humane nature, that can hardly hold out in the want of earthly meanes.
                  Thus you have heard the inconveniences of poverty, which is one extreame of this vertue; heare now in few words the inconvenience of Riches, which is the other extreame; both enemies to a mans contentment. [Give me neither poverty nor riches.]
                  
                  
                     
By Riches, doubtleſſe Agur meanes ſuch Riches as our Saviour cals 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     the mammon of unrighteouſneſſe, Luke 16. 9. Riches ill gotten, by unjuſt, unrighteous meanes: for otherwiſe Salomon tels us, Prov▪
                      10. 22. That the bleſſing of the Lord maketh rich, and he addeth no ſorrow with it: intimating▪ that they which grow rich, and not by Gods bleſſing, but by ſuch meanes as God hath accurſed; the Lord doth adde ſuch a deale of ſorrow and care and vexation with it▪ that they were as good or better be without it. Such riches they were that Abraham rejected at the King of Sodoms hand, Gen. 14. 23. when he offered him goods and ſpoiles enough to have enriched him and all his houſhold; no (ſaith Abraham) I will not take ſo much as a 
                           •
                        hred or a ſhooe-latchet, becauſe it ſhall never be ſaid, the King of Sodome hath made me rich: men ſhall never ſay, that Abraham was made rich not by Gods bleſſing, but by the King of Sodomes meanes: God ſhall make Abraham rich, or I am content ſtill to be poore. It is reported of Neveſſan (a better Lawyer, than honeſt man) that he ſhould ſay; He that would not venture his bodie, ſhall never be valiant, nor he that will not venture his ſoule, be rich, Let them that make no reckoning of their ſoules, venture them at their perill; but let all that deſire contentment here, or heaven hereafter, make their prayers to God as Agur did, From ſuch kinde of riches, good Lord deliver us. And great reaſons may be given for it;
                  1 Quia onerant, becauſe ſuch kind of riches load and clog the ſoule, Heb. 2. 6. Woe be to him that increaſeth that which is not his, and to him that ladeth himſelfe with thicke clay: How long? Marke what a baſe terme God gives the wealth of this world, he cals it denſum lutum, thicke clay; becauſe it bemires and clogs us too: He that increaſeth that which is not his, but hookes it out of other men by evill meanes, he muſt needs be bemired, muſt needes have a foule conſcience▪ an uncleane heart to God ward: and he that ladeth himſelf with thicke clay, muſt needes be clog
                        •
                      in his minde, muſt needes go heavily and ſlowly on to heaven, if ever he come there with ſuch a lading: And marke how the Prophet addes, Vſque quo? How long? and there makes a ſtop: to ſhew the indefatigableneſſe of covetous men, though they have

enough to load them, they can never have enough to tyre them▪ though he load his houſe, his bags, his wits, his memory, and his conſcience, yet is he never weary with all his lading, but ſtill deſires to take in more. As a ſhip may be over laden with gold and ſilver even unto ſinking, and yet have compaſſe and ſides enough to hold ten times more; ſo a covetous man, though he hath enough to ſinke him, he never hath enough to ſatisfie him. As a dog may have his ſtomack cram'd, uſque ad vomitum▪
                      till he caſt it up againe, and yet his appetite is ſtil unſatisfied, for he preſently returnes to his vomite againe: ſo a covetous miſer, though he cramme his cheſts with gold, his garners with corne, his deskes with bils and bonds, yet his luſt is never ſatisfied, his minde is never wearied; which makes the Lord even to wonder at it, and aske, uſque quo? How long? Ther's no end of a covetous mans deſires; he never leaves clogging and lading himſelfe, till he and his load periſh together. Take heede therefore of ill gotten riches, Quia onerant, becauſe they load the ſoule, and hinder it in its paſſage to heaven, and in that ſence are an enemie to mans contentment.
                  2 Quia corrumpunt, becauſe ill-gotten riches corrupt a mans conſcience, and make him worſe than otherwiſe he would or could be. 1 Tim. 6. 9. They that will be rich fall into many temptations ſnares and luſts which drowne men in perdition and deſtruction. Marke, that he doth not ſay, they that are rich, (for a man may be divinitùs dives divinely rich, or rich to God; I meane rich and godly too; as Moſes is ſaid to be divinitus venuſtus, divinely faire, or faire to God, Act. 7. 20. ſo the originall hath it.) Neither is it ſaid, They that would be rich, if God ſo pleaſed to bleſſe them by juſt and honeſt wayes. But they (ſaith the Apoſtle) that will be rich, that ſet downe this for their reſolution, Rich they will be, by right or by wrong; they are thoſe that corrupt themſelves, and runne the hazzard of their ſoules. It is the conceit of Tertullian, that even Iudas carried himſelfe honeſtly and rightly Vſque ad loculorum officium, till he came to carry the Bagge, that ſame 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , (as the Evangeliſts word is) the purſe or tongue, as it ſignifieth; For Iudas thought, as all covetous men doe, that the purſe is the beſt tongue a man can uſe to

ſpeak for himſelfe upon any occaſion; when once he came to that to be a maſter of money; he grew into ſuch a deviliſh humour of covetouſneſſe, that rather than h
                        •
                      would be out of takings, he would ſell his very Saviour: and a faire match he made, (for as Auſtin ſaith) Iudas ſold his ſalvation, and the Scribes and Phariſees bought their damnation, and all for a little money. No marvell the Apoſtle cals the love of money, the roote af all evill: tis not 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the matter of money, but 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the love of money, that is the Roote of all evill. And why the roote? I thinke, for two cauſes. 1. Becauſe a roote is of a ſpreading, of a growing nature, ſpecially if planted in a fruitful ſoyle. Such is the corrupt heart of man, if Satan can but once faſten that wicked roote of covetouſneſſe in a mans heart, &amp; water it as he will with ſuggeſtions, tis wonderful how it wil ſpread and grow and encreaſe continually more and more. Or ſecondly, ſome ſay it is called the Roote, becauſe it is with a man as with a tree in winter, ther's ſap and life in the roote, when ther's little or none to be ſeene in the branches. So in old and froſty age, when other vices and luſts decay, then covetouſneſſe holds life in the roote, and a man will be covetous when he hath not ſtrength to be other wayes vitious. But why is it called the Roote of all evill, for tis not the roote of prodigality, ryot, &amp;c. I take it, the meaning is, of all gainefull evils; if ſo be that ryot and prodigality were as gainefull evils as baſeneſſe and miſery, a covetous man would be as inclineable to the one as to the other. Labour then to pull up this ſame 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , this Roote of bitterneſſe, and deſire God to plant the ſweete and comfortable grace of true contentedneſſe in your hearts, that you may be ſo farre from being carried away with the love of money, that you may account it (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) but 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      but droſſe, but dung, but offall, but filth and garbage, in reſpect of Chriſt, and a good conſcience.
                  3. Quia cruciant, becauſe they vexe and greeve, and paine the ſoule. Our Saviour Chriſt compares them to thornes, &amp; thornes you know are painefull things; painefull in the piercing, but more painefull in the pulling out: ſo are ill-gotten riches painefull in the getting, but moſt painefull in the going out; when

theſe thornes come to be pluckt out by the hand of death, that a man and his riches muſt part, then is the paine▪ then is the woe: for now mens hearts are hardned, their conſciences ſeared, they have (as the Apoſtle ſaith) 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a kinde of hornyhoofe growne over their ſoules, like the brawny hardneſſe that growes upon a labourors hands, or a travellers feete, that makes them inſenſible of any paine: Oh but when death comes to pare off this cruſtineſſe, and leaves nothing to ſtand betwixt a mans ſoule and his ſins, then is the anguiſh of ill-gotten goods; when he is ſearched to the quicke, and his life lies a bleeding, then let him ſay, whether ungodly riches be not paineful things. Zophar gives them a worſe Epithet than thornes, and likens them to poyſons, Iob 20. 12. Sugred poyſons goe downe pleaſantly, Oh but when they are downe, they gall, and gnaw, and gripe the very heart-ſtrings aſunder, if there be not extraordinary remedy: So do ill-gotten goods go downe like ſugred poyſons, and ſo pleaſe the palats of covetous men, that they cannot forbeare them, nor will they: Oh but there will come a time of wringing, and ruing for all this. They ſay, the Italians will give a man a poyſon that ſhall not kill him till a long time after: ſuch poyſons are ill-gotten riches; would you know the reaſon why they doe not trouble mens conſciences now itis becauſe the poyſon doth not yet work, when God in judgement ſets this Poyſon a working, which they themſelves have taken long agoe, then (as the Prophet Eſay ſaith Chap. 3. 9.) Woe be unto your ſouls, for they have rewarded evill to themſelves. If a man ſhould have a Diamond curiouſly cut into ſharp angles in his body, or in his bladder, no man would account him a rich man, but a miſerable and a dead man: even ſuch is the ſtate of him that hath ſwallowed downe the guilt of ill-gotten gaine, it will one day torment him more than ever it enriched him; ſo that the pleaſure of the one, ſhall never countervaile the paine of the other. Take heede therefore and beware of ill-gotten riches, Quia cruciant, though they ſmart not now, they will one day rend the ſoule.
                  4 Quia pereunt, becauſe ill-gotten riches never proſper with a man, but periſh and come to a naughty end, and that partly through the owners wickedneſſe, as the Prophet

ſpeakes of ſome that earne wages and put it in pertuſum ſacculum into a broken bag, or into a bag full of holes and chinkes▪ every luſt, every ſinne that a wicked man is given to, makes (as it were) a chinke or a hole in his eſtate, whereat his wealth runnes out, if it be not ſtopt by true repentance: and partly through the juſt judgement of God, that like as we ſee, Marke 11. 20. as ſoone as Chriſt had curſed the figtree, it preſently withered and dried up 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      from the rootes, to ſhew that it was not the roote alone, but the bleſſing of Chriſt that did ſupport the figtree: it is not all a mans care, nor all his endeavour that can keepe his wealth from withering and periſhing▪ if God from heaven give a curſe unto it, as he doth to all ill gotten goods. W
                           •
                        e be to him that coveteth an evill covetouſneſſe to his houſe, Hab. 2. 9. there hangs a judgement over that mans houſe, like raine in the clouds, which ſooner or later will come daſhing downe upon it and overwhelme it. Fire ſhall conſume the Tabernacles of bribery, Iob 15. 34▪ a man that builds his tabernacle, and raiſeth his eſtate by bribery, and ſuch unlawfull meanes, the Lord doth beare ſuch hatred to that mans houſe, that if Atonement be not made, he will even fire it and burne it to the ground: what a world of ſudden and lamentable fires are there every day in ſome place or other, who can tell but that God doth fire ſuch houſes for the bribery and iniquity of the owners and founders: you know that fire may be given to a traine of Gunpowder, a great way off from the place to which the blow is intended, ſo may judgement be breeding a long time ere it breake out, it may hover a long time ere it light: therefore as you tender your owne ſafety, take heed of getting riches by ill courſes, quia pereunt becauſe they periſh and come to a naughty end. And wilt thou periſh (ſaith Auſtine) for that which periſheth? God forbid.
                  5 Laſtly, quia damnant, becauſe with out Gods infinite mercie they damne a mans ſoule eternally. The Apoſtle Paul is direct, Rom. 3. 8. They which doe evill that good may come of it, their damnation is juſt. Now wherefore doe men filch and ſteale, cozen and deceive, defraud and over reach, and doe all

mann
                        •
                     r of evill? is it not that good may come of it, that they get goods by it? if it be ſo, then make the inference your ſelves, whether ſuch mens damnation be not juſt. But I dare not dwell upon this uncomfortable point, I know it is beſide my text; let me intreate you in a word, and ſo I have done with it: that ſeeing riches ill gotten are ſo dangerous to the ſoule, and ſo great an enemy to a mans contentment; that you would remember Agurs prayer, and deſire no more of God but that which is food and meanes convenient for you; and that is onely ſo much as you may get juſtly, uſe ſoberly, enjoy thankfully, diſtribute cheerefully, and live contentedly.
                  You have heard the two extreames of this vertue (Poverty and Riches) now the meane is that where true contentment reſts, that is, when God fits a man with ſuch an eſtate as is moſt meete, and moſt convenient for him (feed mee with food convenient for me, ſaith Agur,) when a mans heart and his eſtate doe convenire, doe meete, and agree and comply in one, ther's the contentment that my text ſpeakes of: when God faſhioneth a mans heart to his meanes, as David ſpeakes, Pſal. 33. 13, 14, 15. The Lord looketh downe from his habitation, upon the men of the earth, and he faſhioneth their hearts every one of them; as a ſute of cloathes is fitted to a mans body, ſo doth God faſhion a good mans heart to his eſtate, and makes it ſutable, ſit and convenient for him, and this is it that gives him content: for when there is an unſutableneſſe, a diſproportion, a diſagreement, betwixt a mans minde and his meanes, he can have no content, no comfort in it; as we ſee by Ahab, and by Haman, and divers others, who wanted for no meanes, yet becauſe their hearts did not Convenire did not comply and agree with their eſtates, ſee how diſcontentedly they lived and 
                        •
                     yed. If then thy eſtate be not according to thy minde, deſire of God (as Agur did) to faſhion and fit thy minde and heart to thy eſtate, that they may convenire, concord and comply one with the other; then ſhalt thou have content in it, be it more or leſſe. You muſt know, it were as eaſie to God, to give a man plenty as poverty; health as ſickneſſe, peace as trouble, all were one to him to give a man great meanes as little; but onely

that he ſees the one more convenient for ſome men than the other, and accordingly diſpenſeth his favours. He is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      the knower and ſearcher of the heart, and ſees that ſome man if he had more, it would make him proud, if he had leſſe it would make him repine; he ſees that every man hath not wiſedome, nor humility, nor heavenly mindedneſſe enough to concoct a more plentifull eſtate, and therefore he fits every one with ſuch an eſtate as is moſt ſutable, moſt convenient for him. Doe not therefore thinke hardely of God becauſe he ſtraytens thee and cuts thee ſhort in many things which thou deſireſt▪ but know that God knowes thee better than thy ſelfe; Remember what title S. Paul gives to God. 1 Tim. 1. 17. To God onely wiſe be glory and immortality: If we did but conſider that God is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     onely wiſe, it would be a great ſtay to our minds, and a great helpe to our contentment: But here's the miſchiefe, we thinke our ſelves wiſe too, nay I may ſay it, we thinke our ſelves as wiſe or wiſer than God; we are of Alphonſus his minde, who feared not to ſay, Si in principio mundi ipſe Deo adfuiſſet, mult
                           •
                         melius ornatiuſque condenda fuiſſe, if he had beene with God in the beginning, things ſhould have beene contrived in an other manner than now they are: ſo doe we blaſphemouſly thinke, that if God would but take our counſell, and be ruled by us, things ſhould be carried in another manner than now they are, that ſome ſhould not have ſo much▪ others ſo little, ſome all, others never a whit: thus wee wretchedly and blaſphemouſly thinke our ſelves as wiſe, or wiſer than God, and thats the reaſon we are not content with his dealing; whereas if we did conſider that God were onely wiſe, and none were wiſe but he, this would make us reſigne our ſelves to him, ſubmit our wills to his, and ſay as Ely did, It is the Lord, let him doe whatſoever ſeemeth good unto him▪
                      for whatſoever ſeemeth good to him, cannot but be good, howſoever it ſeemes to us. Doe but thus thinke, thus beleeve, thus conceive of God, and that's the way to be content.
                  
                  I have done with the firſt generall part of my Text, which was diſciplina pacis, the diſcipline of peace, and therein you may learne what a happineſſe it is to be Content, or as the

world ſignifieth) to be ſelfe-ſufficient. I come now to the ſecond, and that is pax diſciplinae the peace of this diſcipline, or the profit of this learning; and therein you ſhall ſee, how I for my part, you for your parts, and every one for his owne part, may doe to attaine unto this happineſſe, and learne for our owne particulars to be contented with our owne eſtates. My Text you ſee, is generall and comprehenſive, and doth extend and enlarge it ſelfe, not to any one eſtate or condition of life, but to all conditions, and to all eſtates whatſoever: For if contentment conſiſted or reſted onely in nobility and greatneſſe, what ſhould become of the meaner multitude, how ſhould they be Content? if it conſiſted in eaſe and pleaſure, how ſhould they be content that worke and labour; if in coſtly apparell and dainty fare, what a caſe were they in that goe poorely and fare hardly; In a word, if contentment were limited and confined to any one condition, if it were included and ſhut up in any one eſtate, what ſhould become of all the reſt? But the comfort is, that God in mercy hath ſo divided, and diſperſed and diffuſed this grace into all eſtates of men, that in whatſoever ſtate a man is in, through Gods bleſſing and his owne endeavour, he may be contented with; the poore man as content as the rich man, the husbandman as the Gentleman▪ and the ſubject as content as the King. I have learned (ſaith S. Paul, like a t

                  Thus farre in generall; I come now to particulars. As God charged his Prophet, Ezek. 14. 4. to anſwer them according to their Idols; goe no further than their owne caſe, and ſpeake home to that; ſo give me leave to lay before you certaine particular caſes of diſcontent, which are or may be your owne caſes in particular, and when I have anſwered you according to them▪ when I have ſatisfied and ſhewed you how they may be borne with a contented minde,

                  1. Moſes caſe, to be croſt with a Zipporah, with an ill-tongued wife: or Abigails caſe, to be croſt with a Naball, with an ill-conditioned husband; we wil put them both together, becauſe this croſſe is like an Amphiſbaena, a Serpent with two heads, which bites both wayes, and ſtings at both ends; and there muſt be a redreſſe on both ſides, or there can be no contentment on eyther: As the Poets feigne of Venus, that ſhe brought forth a ſonne, and called his name 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , as you would ſay love for love. Thus ſtands the caſe betwixt a man and his wife they are like

                      and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the love of the one will never grow nor thrive without the love of the other▪ if there be not a reciprocall affection, a mutuall endeavouring to give each other content, their life will proove rather Conjurgium than Conjugium (as one ſaid) rather a watfare, then a

welfare, and they ſhall live in the family as Iacob and Eſau did in the wombe, and doe nothing but wreſtle and ſtruggle for ſuperiority; which is a hatefull life both to God and man. Well, but if it be thus, that a man or woman be thus croſt; what is to be done in ſuch a caſe? I anſwer, there is no way but one, and that's it my Text ſpeakes of, onely to learne to be Content. But yet there is a courſe to be taken for that, and it is this. David tells us in the Pſalme, that it is God that maketh them that are in one houſe to be of one heart: if therefore any diſcontent ariſe in a family, the onely way is to have recourſe to heaven by humble and earneſt prayer, and God will worke a peace twixt man and wife. Wee ſee in Geneſis, as long as Adam and Eve lived at one with God, they lived at one among themſelves; but ſo ſoone as they were divided from God by ſin, they became divided among themſelves by diſcord; Adam falls a blaming of Eve and accuſing her to God, in whom before he rejoyced as bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh: So marke it where you will, ſeldome doe man and wife fall out among themſelves, but firſt they are fallen out with God, and ſeldome agree except God hath a hand in it. The Hebrewes obſerve that Gods Name (Ichovah) and mans and womans name (Iſh and Iſhah) begin both with one and the ſame letter; now if you takeout the firſt letter of Gods name from a mans and womans name, nothing remaines but Eſh which ſignifieth fire. This is the true reaſon why there is ſo much fire, I meane ſo much unkinde and unnaturall flames of contention betwixt man and wife, onely becauſe God is left out, the Lord is not betweene them. Therefore the onely way to bring peace and unity into a family, is to bring God into the family; and the onely way to bring God into a houſe, is to bring him and draw him in by prayer. Draw neare to God, and God will draw neare to you (ſaith S. Iames.) Be not you wanting to God, and God will never be wanting to you; Alwayes remember the Apoſtles farewell to the Corinthians, 2 Cor▪
                      13. 11. Be of one minde, live in peace, and the God of peace ſhall be with you. Thus doe as God would have you, and that is the way to be content.
                  
                  
                     
2. Elies caſe, to be croſt in ones children, Put caſe thy children be either taken from thee by untimely death, in their youth; or which is worſe, live to be ungracious and undutifull to thee in their age: theſe are piercing griefes; yet learne to be content in both. For the firſt, ſay that Almighty God, who hath Ius vitae &amp; necis, the power of life and death in his owne hands, and can draw out, and cut ſhort our lives as it pleaſeth him, doe cut off thy child in the budding, in the blooming of his age, when he is, Aurorae filius (as the Poet ſpeakes) a ſonne of the morning, ſo that all thy joy, thy hope, thy comfort, ſeemes to periſh and die▪ and be extinguiſht in him: yet learne to be content, for why? Conſider, that if thy child had lived, he muſt have ſerved an apprentiſhip all the while, that he might after have heene free of the heavenly Jeruſalem: now if God in his mercy will grant it the freedome in the beginning of its yeares, and make him a citizen among the Saints ſhortly after he came into the world is this any cauſe of diſcontent? and not rather of thankſgiving? But who can tell whether ſuch a child be ſaved or no, if I were but ſure of that (wil ſome ſay) I ſhould be the better content: though I know a good parent will abhorre ſuch a thought of doubtfulneſſe, yet for the better ſetling of your minds in that aſſurance, doe but call to minde our Saviours ſaying, Suffer little children to come unto me, for unto ſuch belongeth the Kingdome of God▪
                      it is not only ſaid that they belong to Gods kingdome, but that Gods kingdome belongs to them, (as much as to ſay) if any have a right unto it, or may claime a part or portion in it, it is ſuch or none: in the Originall it is, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , For of ſuch is the kingdome of God, (that is) Gods kingdome doth conſiſt of little children, heaven is repleniſhed and ſtored with ſuch as they. Foraſmuch then as there can be no feare nor danger of thy childs ſalvation with God, let this teach thee to be content, if God ſhall take him from thee in the beginning of its dayes.
                  But the greateſt croſſe of all is, when children live to be ungracious and undutifull to their parents in their age (as Elies were) when aged parents ſhall be forced to complaine, as the tree did in the Apologue, that it was rent and torne and ſplit

aſunder, with the ſame wedge that was cut out of its owne bowels; this I am perſwaded is the greateſt griefe that can befall a tender-hearted parent. This was the croſſe that ſubdued Egypt; all the plagues of God, could not make them yeeld, till God ſmote their children, and that broke their hearts: ſo 1 Sam. 30. 6. it is ſaid of Davids men, that their ſoules were bitter for their children: the miſcarriage of a child is gall and worme-wood to a parent, it imbitters their very ſoules. If thy caſe be thus, I bewaile and condole it: onely let mee perſwade thee to be content, becauſe the God that made thy childe, can mende him. Do therefore for him as Noah did for Iaphet, Gen. 9. 27. He had given that ſon of his a great deale of good counſell, no doubt, and perſwaded him to dwell in Gods Church, and become a lively member of the ſame; but knowing well to how little purpoſe all this would be, without Gods working upon his heart, he falls to prayer, God perſwade Iaphet to dwell in the tents of Shem: as if he had ſaid, I have adviſed and done my utmoſt, to perſwade thee my ſonne; but all this is but loſt labour, unleſſe God put to his helping hand; now therefore, The good Lord perſwade thee, &amp;c. Thus doe thou for thy refractary childe, deſire God to perſwade him, to convince him, to convert and turne his heart, and thou ſhalt ſee that nothing ſhall ſtand in his way, but the worke ſhall be accompliſhed. If God undertake to bring Peter out of priſon, no bolts nor barres ſhall be able to hold him there; if the Lord 
                        •
                     ake in hand to leade Iſrael out of Egypt into the promiſed 
                        •
                     and, ſea ſhall be no ſea, wilderneſſe no wilderneſſe, Giants no Giants, &amp;c. So though thy childe be never ſo ill minded, never ſo deſperately bent, if God undertake to mend him and make him good, all his ill conditions ſhall not hinder it: therefore let not thy heart ſinke, nor thy faith faile, nor thy hopes languiſh, but ſtill pray, ſtill entreat, ſtill waite upon God, and chats the way to be content.
                  
                  3. Ioſephs caſe, to be croſt in ones reputation. Put caſe thy good name (which Salomon ſaith, is more precious than riches) be impeached and taken from thee by ſlanders, and lyes and baſe imputations of thoſe that wiſh thee ill: for ſuch is the

vice and villany of the world, that they will traduce and diſcredit a man, whether he deſerve it yea or no. David compares ſuch to the Aſpe, which is a beaſt ill ſighted, but quicke of hearing, weake but full of poyſon; ſo are all detractours, illſighted to ſee any thing that's good in another, but quicke of hearing any thing that is bad of him; weake they are in judgement and in charity both, but full of the poyſon of malice and envie. The poyſon of Alpes is under their lips, Pſal. 140. 3. Iunius tranſlates it, venenum p
                           •
                        yados, the poyſon of the ſpitting ſerpent; they have learned of the old Serpent, the Devill, to ſpit their venome in the faces of thoſe that faine would live in peace, and dwell ſecurely by them: they are indeed a curſed generation, Deut. 27. 24. Curſed be he that ſmites his neighbour in ſecret (that doth ſecretly and ſlily underhand traduce him, and ſeeke to worke him out of the good opinion of his neighbours and friends) and marke what followes, let all the people ſay, Amen. God doth not onely curſe ſuch a one himſelfe, but he gives all his people leave to curſe him too: and curſed be that offence that brings the curſe of God, and the curſe of the people upon ſuch an offender.
                  Well, if it have beene any of your hard haps to be thus ſecretly ſmitten, or openly injured in your reputations, (as ſome of us, I am ſure have beene) let me (as I have begun) entreate you to beare it contentedly whether you deſerve it or deſerve it not.
                  If thou doeſt deſerve it, and that by thy ſcandalous life, thou haſt throwne this dirt in thy owne face; then be content and be ſorry for what thou haſt done, and God ſhall repay and make up thy good name againe: wee have his owne promiſe for it, by his owne Prophet, Zeph. 3. 11. In that day thou ſhalt not be aſhamed for all thy doings, wherein thou haſt tranſgreſſed againſt me: the meaning is, that in the day of thy repentance, God will take from thee, not thy ſin onely, but thy ſhame too. David by his great ſinnes, had in a manner quite broken his good name, inſomuch that his enemies began to inſult and make ſongs upon him to diſgrace him utterly; yet becauſe he was a penitent man, God upon his repentance repayred his

good name, and he dyed (ſaith the text) full of riches and Honour: firſt of Chronicles, Chap. ult: not of riches onely, but of honour too: all his diſhonour was done away, and he left a reverend and renowned name behind him: when hee had gotten credit with God, hee got credit with men too. In a word, if thou deſireſt that others ſhould ſpeake well of thee, ſee thou have a care to doe well unto thy ſelfe, Pſal. 59. 18. Si benefeceris tibi, If thou doſt well unto thy ſelfe, men will ſpeake good of thee. So that it lies in a mans ſelfe, it is in his own hand to make himſelfe a good name or a bad one: So long as a man doth well to himſelf, (i) ſpends his time well, ſerves his God well, leades his life well, and husbands his eſtate well; ſo long he ſhall be ſure to be well thought of, and well ſpoken of▪ but if he doe ill to himſelfe, take an ill courſe, leade an ill life, and follow ill company, &amp;c. if he be then ill-ſpoken of, he muſt thanke himſelfe: and he may ſay to himſelfe, as the heart of Apollodorus the tyrant ſeemed to ſay to him, who dreamed one night that he was ſteade by the Scythians, and that his heart cried unto him out of the Caldron, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , It is I that have brought thee to all this. Therefore if thou deſerveſt to be ill-ſpoken of, amend thou thy ſelfe, and God will amend thy name.
                  
                  But if thou be ill ſpoken of, and deſerveſt it not, though the croſſe be great, the comfort is the greater; for doe but reſt contented, and God will finde a time to bring thy innocency to light. Looke how God doth with ſecret ſinnes to bring them to light that are done in darkeneſſe; ſo will he doe by ſecret innocency▪ 
                     Ioſephs uprightneſſe was in ſecret, none ſaw it or knew it but onely God and himſelfe; as for his miſtreſſe ſhee accuſed him, belied and ſlandered him, and was beleeved; poore Joſeph either pleaded not for himſelfe, or his plea was not heard nor credited, yet God found a time to cleare it and bring it to light: ſo let the world raiſe what ſlanders they will, looke how hee did with Ioſeph ſo will hee deale with thee, for he is a God that changeth not. In the meane time, doe not take too much to heart the reproches of thy enemies, but pray as Auſtin did, plue mihi mitigationes in cor, ut patienter tales feram, Oh my God, ſhowre downe thy gentle appeaſings into my

heart, that I may patiently beare with ſuch men as theſe; Pray (I ſay) to God, that hee would pacifie thy owne heart, and mollifie thy enemies hearts, and thats the way to be Content.
                  
                  4 Mephiboſheths caſe, to be croſt by perfidious friends and ſervants. I confeſſe it is a hard caſe when ſuch as are Viri pacis, and Viri panis (as the Prophet ſpeakes,) that eate of a mans bread, and profeſſe friendſhip and love and ſervice to a man▪ when they ſhall go about to undermine him and worke him out of favour, and out of his fortunes too: yet the world is full of ſuch Zibaes that care not how they collogue, nor whom they ſlander for their owne private advantage: If they ſee a man to be a cripple (as it were) that he cannot go to ſpeake for himſelfe, nor come in place to anſwer for himſelfe, and to tell his owne tale, he ſhall be ſure to have his tale told for him, by ſome that he little dreamt of, that will do him a diſpleaſure, and he ſhall never know who hurt him. Thus did Ziba deale with Mephiboſheth, 2 Sam. 19. 30. yet ſee how patiently, how contentedly, that good man put it up; when David ſpake of dividing the land with Ziba, Let him take all (ſaith Mephiboſheth) ſeeing my Lord the King is come home in peace. Here is the voyce of one that is a true ſervant to his God, and a true ſubject to his King; ſuch a man is really content, that the devils pioners (I meane) undermining flatterers, ſhould take all they can get, and get all they can take either by Hophnies Fleſhhooke, 1 Sam. 2. or by thoſe Nets and Dragges that the Prophet ſpeakes of, Hab. 1. 15. let them hooke, hale and drag together the Devill and all (as ſome I thinke will doe:) A contented man had rather with Mephiboſheth looſe all, part with all, and be ſtript of all he hath, ſo he may but have leave to enjoy the favour of his God, the ſafety of his Soveraigne and the peace of his owne conſcience to himſelfe. Well, if it be thy hard hap to be thus abuſed and undermined by a trecherous Ziba, that beares thee faire in hand, and ſecretly endeavours to worke thee out of all; yet learne of Mephiboſheth to be content though thou goeſt by the worſe; and deſire of God as David did to ſtand thy friend in ſuch a caſe; ſponde pro ſervo t
                           •
                        o, in bonum, Anſwer for thy ſervant in the thing that is good, Pſal. 119. 122. as if he had ſaid; Lord thou heareſt and ſeeſt

how unjuſtly I am calumniated and evill ſpoken of in many places, where I am not, nor may not come to anſwer for my ſelfe, therefore Lord doe thou anſwer for me, or ſtirre up ſome good body to pleade my cauſe, and ſpeake in my behalfe. Subarrha ſervumtuum (ſo ſome tranſlate it) be ſurety for thy ſervant; if they will not beleeve mee, nor give credit to my words when I ſpeake in my owne defence; be thou O Lord a ſurety for me, paſſe thy word for my truth and ſincerity, for thou knoweſt my cauſe is good. Be ſurety for thy ſervant in the thing that is good: Thus doe, ſee thy cauſe be good, thy conſcience cleare, thy heart unguilty of the great offence, and then commend, thy caſe to God, let God alone to anſwer for thee, And that is the way to be Content.
                  
                  5 The Cripples caſe, Ioh. 5. to be croſt in ones preferment, as he was that lay 38. yeares at the poole of Betheſda, waiting for a good houre, and ſtill one or other ſtept in before him, and intercepted him of his cure, and put him by from all his poſſibilities and hopes. And this is the great Cordolium the very heart-ake and greevance of many a worthy man, many a worthy Scholler, that hath lyen a long time at the poole of the Church and Court, hoping at length to climbe up that ſame 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (as the Apoſtle calls it, 1 Tim. 3. 13.) that good ſtep or ſtay to honour and preferment, that others have done, and ſtill one or other ſteps in before him, intercepts him of his hopes, and caſts him downe as low as ever his expectations raiſed him up. If this be any of your caſes, I ſhall give you no other counſell then I deſire of God to take my ſelfe, and thats this; to learne of that Cripple to be content for a time, to tarry Gods leaſure, to attend ſtill at the poole (I meane at the ordinances of God) and you ſhall ſee at length, that if Angels cannot helpe you, Chriſt him ſelfe will come and doe a cure upon you, and rather worke a miracle than your faith ſhould be diſappointed, or your hope ſhould make von aſhamed. In the meane time you muſt know, that there is a ſpeciall diſpenſation of God in his dealings with ſome of his ſervants, Num. 12. 7. My ſervant Moſes is not ſo (ſaith God) he is faithfull in all my houſe, unto him will I ſpeake mouth to mouth. Here was a ſpeciall favour, that God would ſhew to Moſes, which hee

would not ſhew to every one that was faithfull in his houſe. You ſee Matth. 17. when Chriſt was tansfigured upon the mount, hee took but three of his Diſciples with him, and left the reſt hehind, who yet were as neare and deare, and as good Diſciples as they. Afterwards, Matth. 27. when Chriſt aroſe from death, it is ſaid, that many of the Saints aroſe to attend him; Many Saints, not all; others that had beene as holy and as ſanctified men as they, ſtayed ſtill in their graves, and their bodies lay in the duſt expecting glory. Thus doth God ſtill deale with his ſervants; ſome he raiſeth up to wealth and honour and preferment; otherſome hee depreſſeth and holdeth downe with poverty, want and neede, who yet no doubt are as true and faithfull ſervants to God as they that are advanced. Salomon tells us, Eccles. 9. 11. The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battell to the ſtrong, nor riches to men of underſtanding, nor favour to men of knowledge: his meaning is, that men of greateſt abilities, men of greateſt ſufficiencies are oft times kept low, when others that are but Gregarij ordinis to our thinking, are advanced and lifted up. This is to learne us to be content with our eſtates, becauſe they are of Gods aſſignement and deſignation. Content (I ſay) not onely by conſtraint, but willingly (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes in another caſe;) for you know there is a twofold contentment: voluntary, and involuntary. The Involuntary is when a man is content with his eſtate, againſt his will, becauſe he cannot helpe it. As Simeon of Cyrene, Matth. 27. 32. ſubmitted himſelfe to beare the croſſe of Chriſt, becauſe hee was Angariatus compelled and forced to it (as the Text ſheweth:) this is a thankeleſſe and fruitleſſe contentment, virtus nolentium nulla eſt: God takes no pleaſure in forced patience; patience perforce hath ſmall thankes with God. But it is the voluntary contentment which proceeds ab intrinſeco from an inward working of grace, from that ſame free ſperit that David ſpeakes of, Pſal. 51. when a man doth voluntarily, freely and of his owne accord endeavour to worke himſelfe to an 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      to an inward ſelfe-ſufficiencie whether his eſtate pleaſe him or no, as they did, Ier. 42. 6. Whether it be good, or whether it be evill, we will obey the voyce of the Lord, &amp;c. Not onely when Gods Will and ours ſute together, but when there is an

utter diſagreement betwixt them: then to be content without conſtraint, is thanke worthy with God. You ſee by experience, A man that comes to an Inne, if hee can get a better lodging and better attendance, he will; if he cannot, yet he will be content with it; for why? Hee conſiders it is but for a night and hee is gone: thus wee come into the world as it were into an Inne, which is a place of paſſage, no place of abode; if we can get a better eſtate or a better condition, uſe it in Gods name; if not, yet learne to be content, for why? it is but for a night, for a ſhort ſpace, and you are gone. And ſo I come to the laſt caſe of all, and that is,
                  6. Hezekiahs caſe, to be croſt in ones departure, to be called to die at ſuch a time, when a man deſires moſt to live: when God ſhall ſhorten a mans dayes in his journey (as David ſpeaketh) and take a man away in the midſt of his age, in the minority of his children, in the unſetledneſſe of his eſtate; this of all the reſt may ſeeme the heavieſt croſſe▪ yet learne of Hezechiah to be content to live as long as God will ſpare thee, and when God will have thee, be content to dye. When a loving mother ſendeth forth her childe to nurſe, and the nurſe hath kept it long enough; if the mother thinke good to take home her owne child againe, hath the nurſe any cauſe to grudge or complaine: how much leſſe cauſe have wee to ſhew any token of ungodlineſſe and diſcontent, that God ſhould take home our departing ſoules, the worke of his owne hands, the plant of his owne grafting, who tenders it more than a mother doth her child, and will keepe it better and ſafer for us, than wee can keepe it for our ſelves? It is ſaid of David, Act. 13. 35. When hee had ſerved his time, by the will of God, then he fell aſleepe and was gathered to his fathers. Every one hath his time ſet him, to ſerve God in this world, ſome a longer, ſome a ſhorter time, as it pleaſeth God to predetermine and ſet it downe: now when a man hath ſerved his time (as David did) and done that he came for into the wotld, I meane when hee hath repented of his ſinnes, reformed his wayes, provided for his familie, and made heaven and ſalvation ſure to his owne ſoule; if then it ſhall pleaſe God to ſend forth that ſame Ang

and fetch him into his fathers kingdome: what juſt cauſe hath ſuch a one to take Iobs wives counſell, in the beſt ſence, and even to bleſſe God and die? It is a lamentable caſe when a man muſt die whether he will or no, when God comes to pull away a mans ſoule, (as Iob ſpeakes Iob 27. 10. What hope hath the hypocrite, when God comes to pull away his ſoule. Iuſt as you ſee when a great fiſh is taken with an Angle, the man pulls, and the fiſh pulls, and the man pulls again, and by force of Armes twitcheth it out of the water: thus it fares with an hypocrite (ſaith Iob) when he is taken (as it were with the Angle of God, I meane with ſome mortall ſickneſſe, that God begins to pull at his ſoule, and twitch it out of his body whether he will or no; then quaenam ſpes? where is the hope of the Hypocrite? alas his hope is gone. The like expreſſion you have Luke 12. 20. God Almighty ſaith to the rich man, Thou foole, this night they ſhall fetch away thy ſoule; as if he had ſaid, I know thou art loath to part with thy ſoule, loath to forgoe it, but that ſhall not ſerve thy turne; there will come thoſe that will take it by force, and fetch it from thee whether thou wilt or no,

                     This is a faithfull ſaying, and theſe things I will that thou affirme conſtantly, that they which have beleeved in God, might be carefull to maintaine good workes; theſe things are good and profitable unto men.

                        ti not worth the while; may it pleaſe you to obſerve in the Text three generall parts, which may be reduced to three Heads, and bee thus expreſſed. 1. The Preachers direction. 2. The peoples duty. 3. Every ones deſire. As thus: This is a faithfull ſaying, and theſe things I will thou affirme conſtantly, (there is the preachers direction.) 2. As many as have beleeved in God, muſt bee carefull to maintaine good workes, (there is the peoples duty) 3. Theſe things are good and profitable unto men. (there is

every ones deſire) for that which every man deſires, that which every man aymes and drives at in his calling and in his courſe of life, is to doe thoſe things that may redound to their profit and their good; and therein my text complyes with every mans deſire, aſſuring them that theſe things are not onely good and pleaſing to God, but good and profitable alſo unto men; God hath onely the glory of our well-doing, the profit and the good is all our owne.
                  In the firſt generall part, obſerve two particulars. 1. A commendation of the text, (this is a faithfull ſaying) 2. A command to the Teacher, (theſe things I will that thou affirme conſtantly.)
                  
                  1. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , This is a faithfull ſaying. I ſuppoſe you beleeve there is not a ſaying in all the booke of God, but it is a true and a faithfull one; all proceeding from the mouth of him that is a true and faithfull God, a God that cannot lie, nor alter the thing that is gone out of his lips: yet ſome ſayings in Gods booke are by way of Eminence or of excellence called by the name of faithfull ſayings (it pleaſeth the Holy Ghoſt himſelfe to ſet that note of dignity upon them;) either becauſe God would have us in a ſpeciall manner to build our faith and our affiance upon them, (as if he ſhould ſay) whatever other ſaiyngs of ſcripture ye doubt of, never make any doubt of theſe, for they are faithfull ſayings, you may pawne your lives and ſoules upon the truth and certainetie of them, or rather (as I take it) they are termed faithfull ſayings; becauſe they are ſuch as doe more neerely concerne the faithfull then any others, being purpoſely directed and intended, Omnibus Chriſti fidelibus to all Chriſts faithfull people whereſoever; for as Saint Paul ſaid of Timothy, Phil. 2. 20. I know no man like minded, who will naturally care for ſuch matters as theſe. Tell a carnall or a worldly man of faith and good workes, ſurdo canis, you doe but (as it were) tell a tale to a deafe man, he minds not what you ſay: if you will talke to ſuch a one, you muſt tell him of the prizes of corne, the practiſe of husbandry, the riſing

and falling of the markets, or perhaps ſome forraine or Domeſticall newes, then he underſtands you, you ſpeake to him then in his owne Idiome, in his owne language: but tell him a diſcourſe of ſpirituall matters, that concerne the right way of pleaſing God, and of ſaving his owne ſoule; He is of Gallios temper, Act. 18. 17. hee cares for none of theſe things, he hath other gates matters to trouble his head withall. But then come to a faithfull man, one that is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      like-minded to God and his bleſſed Apoſtle, one whoſe minde and whoſe affection ſtands that way, and tell him of theſe things, you cannot pleaſe him better, that is the doctrine he deſires to heare of, he will care for it even naturally without any irkeſomeneſſe or reluctation. Therefore as a father ſaid of Saint Lukes Goſpel which hee dedicated to one Theophilus (which ſignifieth a lover of God) ſi Deum diligis ad teſcriptum eſt: If thou beeſt one that loveſt God, this Goſpel is written to thee, Thou art the Patron of it as well as He; In like manner, if thou beeſt a faithfull man, this faithfull ſaying is ſpoken to thee, this text is written for thee, and thou muſt take it to thy ſelfe as if it concerned thee, and none elſe but thee. We reade 2. Reg. 9. 5. when the Prophet came to anoynt Iohn to be King over Iſrael, and found him fitting among the reſt of the captaines, hee delivers his meſſage indefinitely to one of the company, not naming Iehu nor any man elſe, I have an errand to thee O Captaine; Iehu anſwered, to which of all us? The Prophet replyed, To thee O Captaine; when Iehu perceived that the meſſage concerned himſelfe, hee roſe up immediately and obeyed it. In like manner, when a preacher comes into the congregation, and delivers his meſſage indefinitely to the whole aſſembly, thou muſt know that his errand is to thee, he comes with a meſſage ſent from God to thee, and thou muſt impropriate it to thy ſelfe, as if it pertained to none but thee: for this is that which fruſtrates all our ſermons, and makes all our preaching voyd and uneffectuall, becauſe men take our meſſages to be errands ſent from heaven to others,

and nothing at all concerning or belonging to themſelves. Iuſt like little children when they looke in a glaſſe, they thinke the face they ſee there is the babyes face and not their owne. But I am perſwaded better things of you (my brethren) that you are not in the number of thoſe that doe 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Act. 13. 46. put away the word of ſalvation from your ſelves to others; and therefore let me uſe the words of Lydia, if you deſire of God to bee counted faithfull, give heede and good regard to what is here ſet downe, for the holy Ghoſt commends it to be a faithfull ſaying, as if no other ſaying were ſo faithfull as this 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , This is a faithfull ſaying. But that is not all.
                  I had rather draw it another way, and make another kind of uſe of it, as thus: namely, that I, and you, and every one that beares the name of Chriſtian would be perſwaded to imitate this example, to follow this patterne, and to learne of God and his bleſſed Apoſtle, to be faithfull in all our ſayings; that whatſoever we ſpeake, whatſoever we affirme, it may be Bonafide (as we ſay) ſo honeſt and ſo unfained, that wee may bee able to maintaine it without an oath; This that we have ſpoken is a faithfull ſaying: For I beſeech you 
                        〈…〉
                      what are all your bonds, all your oathes, all your Affidavits, all your witneſſe-bearing to mens words; but proles humana perſidiae, the very iſſue and off-ſpring of mens unfaithfulneſſe; if men were but true and faithfull in their ſayings, all theſe things neede not be.

It is indeed an odious and hatefull ſinne, both to God and man; Pſal. 101. I hate the ſinnes of unfaithfulneſſe, there ſhall no ſuch cleave unto me: ſinne (you know) is of a cleaving nature, whatever ſinne a man is given to, he ſhall finde that it will cling like a burre unto him, hee ſhall have much adoe to ſhake it off; therefore the Apoſtle gives it the right terme and calles it

It is the moſt divine, the moſt God-like quality in the world, there is no one thing wherein a man doth more neerely reſemble God, then in beeing faithfull: the ſcripture termes God the Father fidelem creatorem, a faithfull Creator▪ God the Sonne, fidelem pontificrm a faithfull High Prieſt; And God the Holy Ghoſt, fidelem toſtem a faithfull witneſſe.

So when a man ſhall doe two or three good deedes, and then ſtay his hand, this is not enough to pleaſe God; then is God pleaſed when wee proceede and goe on, and keepe a conſtant ſetled courſe of weldoing; when wee make it as our meat and drinke to doe the will of our heavenly father: ſo that as a healthfull man if hee eate or drinke the leſſe one day, hee

You know what is ſaid in the Goſpel, Bleſſed is that ſervant whom his maſter when he commeth ſhall finde ſo doing; that is, when death or judgement ſhall come upon a man like a theefe in the night, unexpectedly and unawares, bleſſed of God is that man that is found at his prayers, or taken in his calling, or any waies taken in the act of well-doing: but woe to that man or woman that is taken (as it were) napping in the midſt of his ſinnes, as Balthaſhar was taken in the midſt of his cups; Nebushadnezzar in the midſt of his pride; the old world in the midſt of their fleſhline▪ to ſpeake the beſt of it that may be, it is much to bee feared that God meanes no good to that parties ſoule.

I will have mercy and not ſacrifice: I ſay no more but this, ſhew mercy to the poore for Chriſts ſake and Chriſt will ſhew you mercy for the poores ſake: and ſo much for the ſecond ſort of good workes, which are Opera charitatis, workes of charity to the poore.

And ſo much briefely for the three ſeverall ſorts of good workes, which every Chriſtian is bound by his beliefe and faith to God, to do and to maintaine to the utmoſt of his power and ability. It remaynes how this muſt be done, and that you ſhall ſee by the ſequell.
                  1. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , be carefull to maintaine good workes, (ſo wee tranſlate it) the word ſignifies ſomewhat more, i. ut ſtudeant that they ſtudy, deviſe and beate their braines, how they may doe good to thoſe that ſtand in neede of their goodneſſe, according to that Eſay 32. 8. The liberall man deviſeth liberall things; he ſtudies upon his bed (as a mother

doth when her child is ſicke) what courſe to take, what meanes to uſe to make the Church and the world the better for him. Solomon ſaith, Pro. 14. 22. Mercy and truth ſhall be to them that deviſe good: i. Mercy in the promiſes, and truth in the performances of Gods favour and goodneſſe to that mans ſoule. As on the contrary it is the brand-marke of a man that feares not God, Pſal. 36. 4. He deviſeth evill upon his bed; it is bad enough to doe evill any manner of way, though it bee ex non advertentiâ, for want of good taking heede, (as Gods beſt ſervants doe many times, and are heartily ſory for it when it is done, ſo that were it to doe againe they would not willingly doe it for a world) but for a man in cold blood (as wee ſay) to lye and ſtudy and contrive a way to ſinne, and to project and plot his ſinnes aforehand, it is damnable and deviliſh. And marke the place where a graceleſſe man deviſeth evill, David ſaith, In cubile ſuo, upon his bed, in the darke and ſilent night when a man ſhould doe nothing but pray, and ſigh, and grone, and cry to God for mercy and grace, and remiſſion of ſinnes; then doth a wicked man lie and plot and beate his braines how to bee revenged on ſuch a neighbour, how to bring ſuch a wicked enterpriſe to paſſe, that the world may take no notice of it: oh that ſuch men would remember that woe, Mich. 2. 1. Wee unto them that deviſe evill upon their beds, and in the morning riſe and practiſe it: that is a degree beyond the former evill, if a man hath had evill thoughts or evill purpoſes in the night (as the beſt man may have) the firſt thing hee ſhould doe in the morning ſhould bee, to downe upon his knees to God, and deſire the Lord (as Peter adviſed Symon Magus to pray, Act. 8.) that the thoughts of his heart might be forgiven him: but for a man firſt to deviſe evill without remorſe of conſcience, and then to practiſe it, what is this? but to adde ſinne to ſinne, and even with cartropes to pull downe the curſe of God upon his owne head.
                  And therefore as you love your ſoules take heede of deviſing evill by your ſelves; drive away thoſe evill thoughts,

(as Abraham did the fowles) with the ſtaffe of earneſt prayer; and (as the Apoſtle ſaith) Phil. 4. 8. If there 
                           •
                        ee any vertue, if there be any praiſe in you, thinke on theſe things that my text enjoynes you; and when you have any leaſure, any ſpare time from the world, deviſe (in Gods name) and beate your braines how you may compaſſe to doe ſome good worke which may tend to the right way of pleaſing God, and of ſaving your owne ſoules. So much for that particular 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      men that beleeve in God muſt ſtudy and take thought how to maintaine good workes.
                  2. To maintaine good workes, the word in the originall is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                        eſſe to bee before others, to be a Preſident or an antecedent in good works; not onely to take example by others, but to give example to others of goodneſſe and well-doing: as in giving of honour, ſo in doing of good, we muſt ſtrive to goe one before another, not ſinger and ſtay till we ſee what an other man will doe, or what ſuch a man will give to pious and charitable uſes, but ſtrive to be the firſt in a good action. That that ſaved Shimeyes life. 2. Sam. 19. 20. was, that he was the firſt of all the houſe of Ioſeph that came to meete the King: ſo was 
                        〈…〉

                        〈◊〉
                      and you know in the poole of Betheſda, Iohn 5. he that ſtept in firſt was cured of whatſoever diſeaſe he had, and none but he that ſtept in firſt. In worldly matters men are forward enough, they neede neither clocke nor bell to awaken them, neither ſpur nor ſwitch to drive them on; if there be but a good leaſe to be taken, a good bargaine to be bought, a good preferment to be gotten, every one ſtrives who ſhall ſtep in firſt: but if it be a matter that concernes the ſerving of God, or the doing of good, as our Saviour ſaid of the Scribes &amp; Phariſes, Mat. 21. 31. they care not though the very Publicanes &amp; harlots go into Heaven before them: thus backward men are when they ſhold be forward, &amp; forward when they ſhould be backward.

                     IAMES 5. 17, 18.
                     
                        Elias was a man ſubject to like paſsions as we are, and he prayed earneſtly that it might not raine, and it rained not on the earth by the ſpace of three yeares and ſixe moneths. And he prayed againe, and the heavens gave raine, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
                  
                  
                     THe ſum and drift of this Text is to ſet forth the efficacie, or rather omnipotencie of earneſt and fervent Prayer▪ There be two graces of God in man that may iuſtly be termed Omnipotent or Almighty graces; God himſelfe being pleaſed to ſhew his Almighty power and goodnes in them, and they are Faith and Prayer. 1. For the firſt, Mat. 15. 28. O

What a large unlimited Grant and Patent was this for a poore ſinner to aske what ſhe would, and have promiſe of acceptance. Mark. 9. 23. to him that beleeveth all things are poſſible. Looke what a beleever cannot doe himſelfe, God himſelfe will doe it for him, and yet it ſhalbe accounted as his act and deed. Phil. 4. 1

                     . I can doe all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me: Not meaning that he could do all things in generall and at large, as to walke on the waters, or flie in the aire, &amp;c. but all things that belonged to his calling, all things that concerned his Miniſtery, and all things that pertained to the right way of pleaſing God and of ſaving his owne ſoule: He could pray well, Preach well, live well; he could want and he could abound, he could conforme and apply himſelfe to all eſtates whatſoever: All this he could doe, not by any power or abilitie of his owne, but by the ſtrengthning grace, and faith, and vertue of Ieſus Chriſt, (I can doe all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me.) As on the contrary, Our Saviour ſaith of himſelfe, Marke 6. 5. that he could do nothing worth ſpeaking of in his own Country▪

                     , He could not doe them: not that Chriſt was unable for want of power, but he ſaw it was unavaileable through their lacke of faith. For the power of God, and the faith of men, are like the ſpirits and the ſinewes in the body, the one moves, and ſtirres, and workes within the other; if there be no faith in us, there can be no expectation of any power or any helpe from God.

                  Such a powerfull man with God was Eliah here in my Text: His mouth (as a Father ſaith) was Franum Coeli, the very bridle of heaven; he could even rule the heavens with his prayers, as a man rules a horſe with a bridle: Now leaſt you ſhould thinke he did thus prevaile with God, rather by the priviledge of his perſon, then by the vertue of his prayers, The Apoſtle tells us for that, he was

                         paſſions that we are, and yet his prayer tooke ſuch good effect. (Eliah▪ was a man ſubject, &amp;c.)
                  In my Text there are two generall points to be conſidered. 1. The condition and quality of Eliahs perſon, [He was a man ſubject 
                           •
                        o like paſſions as we are.] 2. The condition and quality of his prayer; that like a two-edged ſword, it cut both wayes, and prevailed in both kindes; both to bring a judgement, and to bring a bleſſing upon the people. His firſt prayer like a burning fever entred into the bowels of the earth▪ and ſcorcht and dried up the Rivers and Lakes, and Springs, and le

                      a heaven-dropping dew, a happy and a heavenly raine that moyſtned and fatned, and refreſhed the earth againe. [He prayed againe, and the heavens gave raine, and the earth brought forth her fruit.

                     ition and quality of Eliahs perſon, what manner of man Eliah was? My text ſaith hee was

                     A man ſubject to the ſame paſſions, to the ſame frailties and infirmities that we are. Hence you may obſerve, that no profeſſion of holineſſe, no practiſe of piety, no degree of grace and ſanctification in this life, can exempt, or free, or priviledge

a man from common paſſions and infirmities: Eliah was a man of God, a mortified and a ſanctified man, and one of the greateſt favorites in the Court of heaven, and yet a man ſubject to paſſions. What ſhall I neede to multiply examples to prove this point, when we know the Apoſtle affirmeth even of our Saviour himſelfe, That he was in all things like unto us ſinne excepted: ſet but ſinne aſide (whereof his bleſſed perſon was uncapeable, for as no ruſt can take hold of burning and

Amercifull High-Preiſt, one that knew how to tender and ſuccour our infirmities, becauſe himſelfe had a feeling of them in his owne nature. This made him ſo tenderly affected towards the hungry multitude, Matt. 15. becauſe himſelfe knew by his owne experience what an unſufferable miſery hunger was. This made him ſo compaſſionate towards the ſorrowes of Mary and M

                         and ſorrow: And ſuch was his compaſſion toward Peter in that ſtate of deſertion wherein he lay, Luk 22. becauſe himſelfe knew and felt in his owne ſoule, what a wofull thing it was to be forſaken of God. And this is the aſſurance which the Apoſtle gives us that we ſhall obtaine mercy and grace from Ieſus Chriſt, to helpe and comfort us in time of need, Heb. 4. 16. becauſe himſelfe had a feeling of the ſame infirmities, and was a man ſubject to the ſame paſſions that wee our ſelves are, ſinne onely excepted.
                  In a word then, as there is no Roſe ſince the Creation, but hath his prickles, as well as his ſweet leaves; ſo there is no man living ſince the fall of Adam (except our Saviour forementioned, who was 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     God and man both) but hath

his paſſions as well as his perfections, his infirmities as well as his graces. As Cyril obſerves, there is no Rock of ſtone ſo hard, but hath ſome cracks, ſome clefts and ſeames in it, whereat weedes ſpring out and grow: ſo there is no mans heart ſo ſanctified and filled with grace, but hath ſome cracks, ſome flawes in it, whereat his ſinnes and corruptions ſprout and iſſue out, to his no ſmall regret and griefe. And as we ſee by experience, that there is chaffe about everie corne in the field, and bitterneſſe in every branch of Wormewood, and ſaltneſſe in every drop of water in the Sea; ſo is there infirmity and frailty, corruption and paſſion in every man, woman, and child, of what eſtate, of what degree, of what profeſſion ſoever. Eliah was a holy man, a zealous man, a man of God, and yet a man ſubject to paſſons.
                  
                  Let no man therefore be too forward or too ſevere in cenſuring and condemning the follies and frailties, the weakeneſſes and paſſions of godly men, or of the men of God, (ſuch as Eliah was) for alas, they are 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſubject to the ſame paſſions that other men are Salomon tells us, Pro. 27. 19. That as in water, face anſwereth to face, ſo doth the heart of man to man. A man that lookes into the water, or into a glaſſe, ſhall ſee a face there in all points anſwering to his owne, the ſame ſpots, the ſame warts, the ſame wrinkles and blemiſhes that he ſees in the face in the water, they are all the very ſame in his owne face, there is face anſwering to face: ſo doth the heart of man to man; the ſame evills, the ſame corruptions, luſts and ſinnes, that thou ſeeſt in another mans heart, breaking out into his life, the very ſelfe-ſame are in thy owne heart; his heart to thine is but as a face anſwering to a face in the water. Obſerve the Apoſtles demand, 1 Cor. 4. 7. and apply it to thy ſelfe. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ? Who makes thee to differ from an other man? For by nature all are alike, all equally devoid of ſpirituall grace and goodneſſe, and all equally prone to ſinne and wickedneſſe: how comes it to paſſe then, that one man differs

from another, that one is holy, blameleſſe, and undefiled in his way; another licentious and looſe, and ſpotted with the world? Anſw. It is not any thing in nature (beleeve that for a truth) but meerely that ſame Gratia diſcriminans (as Divines call it) that diſtinguiſhing Grace of God, it is that which makes the difference betwixt one man and another. Let no man therefore aſcribe any thing to himſelfe for his freedome from great offences, but give God the glory of his grace which had made him to differ from the greateſt ſinner; and if at any time, thou ſeeſt another man breake out into paſſion, or miſcary in his way by ſome ill temptation; reprove him in Gods name; and pray for him when thou haſt done, and withall, reflect upon thy ſelfe, and ſay, as Plato did, Num ego talis uſpiam? Am not I ſuch a one? Have not I beene, or may not I be as vile and as vicious as he? Be not therefore too cenſorious, nor too ſupercilious (as the manner of ſome is) but incline rather to thinke everie man better, than to thinke any man worſe than thy ſelfe; if thou ſeeſt thy brother overtaken in a fault, doe then as the Apoſtle adviſeth thee, Gal. 6. 1. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     reſtore him with the ſpirit of meekeneſſe, or (as the word ſignifieth) bind him up gently and lovingly, as a Chirurgian doth a bone that is out of joynt; Conſidering thy ſelfe (ſaith he) leaſt thou alſo be tempted; conſidering (I ſay) that thou art, as he is, and all men are, as Eliah was 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , too like one another in that which is naught, all ſubject to the ſame paſſions; All (as the Apoſtle ſaith) ſhut up under ſin, And I pray God of his goodneſſe have mercy on us all. Amen.
                  Againe, the conſideration of this, if it be rightly conceived, may ſerve for a comfort and a ſtay unto ſuch tender conſciences as have ſinned of infirmitie, and like Moſes in their haſte, have ſpoken unadviſedly with their lips, not being able for the time to over-rule and bridle their paſſions. It is ſome comfort to conſider, that the greateſt Saints of God have ſometimes beene of the ſame temper; yea there is not a ſoule in heaven (the ſoule of Ieſus Chriſt onely excepted)

but hath beene ſometimes ſubject to the very ſame paſſions. And I ſaid, This is my infirmity (ſaith the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 77. 10. but I remember the yeares of the right hand of the moſt High. (i) I conſider and call to minde that God in former times, and in the dayes of old, hath had compaſſion upon the ſame infirmities in other men; and why ſhould I miſdoubt (he being ſtill the ſame compaſſionate God) but that he will have pitty and compaſſion upon the ſame infirmities in me. But ſome man may ſay: How ſhall I know and be aſſured that my ſinnes are ſinnes of infirmitie, ſuch as God will winke at; and not rather ſinnes of preſumption and iniquitie, ſuch as his ſoule abhorres? Anſw. A ſinne of infirmity may be knowne two wayes,
                  1. By the antecedent which goes before it; and that is an honeſt reſolution of a mans heart againſt ſinne and evill; when a man doth ſtedfaſtly reſolve (by the aſſiſtance and grace of God) to ſeparate himſelfe from every knowne ſin, and to ſanctifie himſelfe in all holy duty and obedience to God, ſtriving by a holy deſire and an hearty endeavour, in nothing willingly to ſinne againſt God, but in every thing to pleaſe him and approve himſelfe unto him: if ſuch a man chance to fall by occaſion into a fault, or be overtaken unawares (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, Gal. 6. 1.) beſides the purpoſe of his heart, and againſt the intention and deſire of his ſoule; that mans ſinnes, are ſinnes of infirmitie, which by the mercy of God ſhall never be laid to his charge. Contrarily, when a man ſhall hang in 
                           •
                        quilibrio, in an even ballance (as it were) betwixt wickedneſſe and goodneſſe, and ſhalbe equally diſpoſed to ſinne or not to ſinne as occaſion ſhall offer it ſelfe: or which is worſe, ſhall doe like him, Pſal. 36. 4. ſhall ſet, and ſettle himſelfe in a way that is not good, reſolving with himſelfe, that this ſinne 
                        •
                     its my turne, and pleaſeth my humour, and I will not part with it: or which is worſt of all, when a man ſhall draw iniquity with cords of vanity (as the Prophet ſpaketh) as if the devill were backward, and ſinne would not come faſt enough

upon him of its owne accord; ſhall fiſh and angle for it, and hunt after ill company, and draw himſelfe and others into ſinne, as Fiſh and Fowles are drawn into a net, to their ruine and deſtruction; this mans ſinnes are farre beyond the ſinne of infirmity, for they are ſinnes of iniquity and ſinnes of obſtinacie, and ſuch as will coſt him many a ſigh, many a groane, many a teare, before ever he ſhall attaine to this comfortable perſwaſion, that there is compaſſion with God, and ſalvation with Chriſt for his ſoule.
                  2. A ſinne of infirmity is knowne by the conſequents of it, or that which followes after it: it leaves ſuch a ſting behind it in the ſoule, that a man can never be at quiet in his owne conſcience, till he hath made his peace with God by a ſound and ſerious humiliation, and reconciled himſelfe againe to Ieſus Chriſt. Yea, it never leaves a man, till it hath brought him to that ſame 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that Indignation which the Apoſtle ſpeakes of, 2 Cor. 7. 11. that a man ſhall even fret and vexe and fall out with himſelfe for offending and provoking ſo good, ſo gracious a God. It will make a man upbraid himſelfe for a very beaſt and a foole (as David did, Pſal. 73.) So ignorant was I, and ſo fooliſh, even as a beaſt before thee. And it is a ſure rule, that of Saint▪ 
                     Augustin; peccata non nocent, ſi non placent; if a mans ſinnes doe not pleaſe 
                           •
                        im they will never hurt him. Whereas on the contrary, when a man can carry away his ſinnes as lightly as Sampſon carried the gates of Azz
                           •
                        , that they are no burthen to his 
                        〈…〉
                     e or if they doe beginne to trouble him, ſhall doe as Saul did, betake himſelfe to muſicke and ſport, and merry company to drive it away (as if one ſinne could drive out another, and not rather drive it farther in:) beleeve it, this mans ſinnes are no ſinnes of infirmitie, but they are ſinnes of an higher nature, and ſuch as will coſt a man deare ere hee can be acquitted of them in the ſight of God. And this I dare confidently affirme, that there is no man that ſinnes of infirmity but he i
                        •
                      afterward the better for his ſinne; it

makes him the more jealous of himſelfe, the more watchfull over his wayes, the more carefull to ſerve and pleaſe God, than ever hee had beene in former times. Whereupon ſaith Saint Auſtin, upon thoſe words of the Apoſtle, Rom. 8. Omnia cooperantur, &amp;c. All things worke together for good to them that love God. Etiam peccata Domine, Even our very ſinnes O Lord; for by ſinne we have experience of our infirmitie, our infirmity brings us downe to humility, humility brings us home to God, and in God every man hath his quietus eſt, a happy diſcharge from all his ſinnes. This being done, one thing onely remaines, and that is this; A man that hath ſinned of infirmity, will labour to bring forth that ſame 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      which Iohn Baptiſt ſpeakes of, Mat. 3. 8. the worthy fruits of repentance: for you moſt know, that repentance is one thing, and the fruit of repentance is another; it is not enough to repent and be ſorry for what a man hath done (ſo did Iudas, ſo did Ahab) but he muſt honeſtly and unfainedly endeavour to bring forth the fruit of repentance, and that is the reformation and alteration of his life, and converſation in the ſight of God and men. If it he thus with thee, take comfort (in Gods name) from this comfortable Doctrine, that thou art no other then Eliah was, a man ſubject to paſſion.
                  It followes; Eliah was a man ſubject to paſſions, yet hee prayed; Hence wee may learne, never to be ſo dejected at the view of our frailties and imperfections, as to forbeare our reſorting to God in prayer. For no man living hath ſo much neede to pray to God, as a man ſubject to paſſions. It was one part of Salomons requeſt to God, 2 Chron. 6. 29. When any one ſhall perceive and feele his owne ſore, his owne griefe, and the plague of his owne heart (as he termeth a mans owne corruption) what ſhall he doe? Shall hee deſpaire, ſhall he be driven backe from God (as Iordan was driven backe at the perſence of the Arke) no, let him this doe; let him downe upon his knees to God, and ſpread forth his hands to heaven, and the Lord which dwelleth in

heaven will heare him, and when he heares, have mercy. It was an amazed and unadviſed prayer, that of Simon to our Saviour, Luke 5. 8. when he cried out, Lord goe from me, for I am a ſinfull man; as if a Patient ſhould ſay to the Phiſitian, depart from me, for I am ſicke.

Shall he lie downe, like Iſſachar, and couch betweene his burthen? Shall he be diſheartened and diſcouraged from reſorting and approaching to God? God forbid; let him in Gods name come to Ieſus Chriſt that calls him, with teares in his eyes, with true griefe and Godly ſorrow in his heart, with humble confeſſions and prayers in his mouth; and he hath promiſed in verbo ſervatoris, in the word of a Saviour, that hee will releaſe and eaſe him of it. One thing I muſt tell thee by the way, when thou prayeſt to Chriſt for eaſe, thou muſt promiſe him obedience and ſervice; as the Iſraelites did to Rhehoboam, 1 Reg. 12. Eaſe us of our burthen, and we will be thy ſervants for ever. Thus doe, and then let thy burthen be never ſo great, thy corruptions never ſo many, thy paſſions never ſo ſtrong; He that could calme the ſea, can calme thy ſorrowes, and ſpeake peace unto thy ſoule in the midſt of all thy troubles, and therefore, if at any time thy paſſions be ſtirred, and thy heart diſquieted within thee; know of a ſurety, that, there is ſome Ionah that hath raiſed this ſtorme, ſome ſinne or other that hath cauſed this trouble to thy ſoule; then fall to thy prayers (as Eliah did) and give God no reſt, till God hath given reſt to thy ſoule.

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , In praying he prayed, or he prayed a prayer; we tranſlate it, He prayed earneſtly; and it is to very good purpoſe; for it implies thus much: that no prayer is a prayer indeede, but an earneſt prayer. Cold and careleſſe prayers, counterfeit and ſuperſtitious prayers, they be but res nihili, in Gods account no prayers at all. I will give you an inſtance. Act. 9. 11. When Paul was converted and ſtricken with blindneſſe, Almightie God ſent Ananias to him to lay his hands upon him, and to recover him of his ſight; now leaſt he ſhould miſtake the man, and lay his hands upon a wrong party, God gives him this prive token to know him by, for behold he prayeth. Now let me demand; do you think that S. Paul never prayed to God till that time? or doe you imagine that was the firſt prayer that ever Paul made? It is the firſt we reade of; but doe you thinke he never prayed before? I beleeve hee did, many a time and oft; and I will give you my reaſon▪ Saint Paul (you know) was a Phariſee, one of the ſtricteſt and devouteſt of all the Sect (as he teſtifies of himſelfe) and the Phariſees, you know, were altogether given to long praying; it was their glory and their gaine to, that they could make long prayers in every place, in the open ſtreets, in widowes houſes; and no doubt but Saint Paul had as excellent a faculty that way, and could pray as long and as largely as the beſt of them all: but ſee the iſſue: Almighty God, who ſtiles himſelfe the hearer of prayers, gave no eare, tooke no notice of all his formall, Phariſaicall, hypocriticall prayers, which he had made in former times; till he came to this humble, this earneſt, this heart-breaking prayer; And now (ſaith God) Behold he prayeth▪
                      hee never prayed indeed, till now: for as Philo ſaith well; God doth not numerare, but ponderare, not number our prayers, but weigh them; if he finde them cordiall, if he finde them hearty, that they have ſome ſubſtance and ſo

                      winke at them, over-ſee them▪ paſſe by, and take no notice of them; let no man therefore deceive himſelfe to thinke that all kinde of praying ſpeeds alike, for no prayer is a prayer in Gods account, but an earneſt prayer. Eliah prayed a prayer, becauſe he prayed earneſtly.
                  Furthermore, it is worth your noting, to ſee the conſtant diſpoſition of this holy man. Eliah was well knowne to be a hot ſpirited man in all his actions, exceeding zealous and earneſt in all his reprehenſions, both of the King, and of the people. Now here you may obſerve the equability the evenneſſe of Eliahs zeale; as he was earneſt in his reprehenſions, ſo he was as earneſt in his devotions; and as zealous in his prayers, as he was in his anger. There is many a man hot and fiery in his anger, but cold and luke-warme in prayers; ſuch zeale is never right. Gal. 4. 18. It is good to be alwayes earneſt in a good thing. 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Is the word to be hot and fiery, and zealouſly affected in one good thing as well as another, in devotion, as well as reprehenſion, in prayer, as well as in anger. When a mans zeale is equable (like Eliahs) then it is right and pleaſing to God.
                  As Phyſitians judge of the ſtate of a mans body, Vniverſalia ſalutaria, particularia ex morb
                           •
                        ; as thus: if a man be hot in one part and cold in another; if the palmes of his hands burne, and the ſoles of his feet be key-cold, then all is not right; but if he be of an indifferent equall heate all over, that held a good ſigne of good health in the body. By the like rule, judge thou of the ſtate of thy ſoule, if thy zeale be equable and uniforme both in prayer and in anger, it is a good ſigne of grace and ſanctification in thy heart; but if it vary and differ, that there is too much heate in the one, too little in the other; all is not well within. It was the reaſon which

old Father Latimer gave, why men in theſe dayes doe not prevaile with God in their prayers, as Eliah and ſuch others had done in former times, Deeſt ignis (ſaith he) deeſt ignis, There lackes fire, there lackes fire; his meaning is, our prayers want that zeale, that heate, that earneſtneſſe, which they put into theirs. For as Incenſe without fire yeelds no ſmell, no more doth prayer without zeale and earneſtneſſe; and as Hony is no Hony, if it have loſt its ſweetneſſe; and Vinegar is no Vinegar, if it have loſt its ſharpeneſſe; ſo Prayer is no Prayer, if it be void of earneſtneſſe. Eliah prayed indeede, becauſe he prayed earneſtly.
                  Now I come to the ſubject, and matter of his Prayer which (I told you) was firſt for a judgement, and then for a bleſſing, firſt for a drought, and then for raine, as it followeth. He prayed earneſtly that it might not raine, and it rained not on the earth by the ſpace of three yeares and ſixe moneths. Here are two weighty points to be conſidered. 1. What ſhould move Eliah to pray for a judgement. 2. Why hee made choiſe to pray for this kind of judgement, of drought and dearth, rather then for any other. I will tell you my opinion of both.
                  1. Vpon what ground, or by what warrant did Eliah pray for a judgement. S. Paul (in my conceit) ſeemes to taxe him for it, Rom. 11. 2. and he brings it in with a notandum, wote ye not (i) doe ye not marke and obſerve what the Scripture ſaith of Eliah, how he made interceſſion to God against Iſrael. Good men in former times were wont to make interceſſion to God For the people, not Againſt them: Abraham prayed for the wicked Sodomites, Ieremy prayed for the Idolatrous Iſraelites, till God forbad him, and gave him a countermand, Pray no more for this people, for I will not heare thee, Ier. 11. 14. The Husbandman in the Parable entreates his Maſter for the unfruitfull tree, that hee would ſpare it and not cut it downe, and doth Eliah differ from all the reſt, and bend his prayers againſt the people, and pray for the vexation and undoing of his Countrey? How

could this ſtand with that good Religion, and that good affection which ſo holy a man ſhould beare towards the people of God? Anſw. Three things there are (in my weake judgement) that may ſeeme to warrant and beare out Eliah in praying for a judgement.
                  1. Authoritas Prophetic
                           •
                        . Prophets might doe more than ordinary perſons, and Eliah had the ſpirit of Propheſie, and knew by revelation from God, that ſuch a judgement was a comming, therefore he might the more warrantably and unoffenſively frame his deſires to Gods appointments, and fit his prayers to Gods purpoſes. Thus muſt we conceive of thoſe bitter execrations and imprecations wherewith David did ſo often in the Pſalmes curſe and banne his enemies, [Let their Table be their ſnare, let their children be vagabodes and beg their bread, &amp;c.] A man would thinke it could not ſtand with the piety and charitie of a godly man, to wiſh ſuch wicked events, ſuch uncharitable wiſhes to proceede out of his mouth: but onely that we know, hee was a Prophet of God, and did it per aff
                           •
                        atum divinum, by the direction and inspiration of the Holy Ghoſt; hee knew by the ſpirit of Propheſie, they were ſuch as were accurſed of God, being Gods enemies as well as his, and therefore might the more warrantably and ſafely doe it. It is not for us to uſe Davids curſes, unleſſe we had Davids ſpirit. David and Eliah had that gift which the Apoſtle calls 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     the diſcerning ſpirits; they knew by inſtinct from heaven, who were bleſt and who were curſed of God. It is not ſo with us, God hath hid thoſe ſecrets from our eyes, and therefore it is our part and duty to pray in love and charity, That God would have mercy upon all men.
                  
                  But what uſe then are wee to make of thoſe curſes in the Pſalmes that are read ſo often to us? Anſw. Thus wee may doe, we may apply them to the enemies of the Church, that ſeeke the ruine of the true Religion, and profeſſe an open enmity to the Goſpel and Faith of Ieſus Chriſt (Who is God bleſſed for) ever we may ſafely take our Saviours part, and

curſe all thoſe that are enemies to him▪ 
                     [So let all thy enemies periſh, O Lord, Iud. 5. 3▪ 1:] But for our owne enemies, that have done us ſome private wrong, or bare us ſome ſecret grudge, to curſe them and banne them in this kinde (as the uſuall manner of ſome is) it is both unwarrantable, uncharitable, and ungodly. But the beſt and ſafeſt uſe, that wee can make of thoſe curſes, is to appropriate and apply them to our ſelves, to acknowledge and adjudge our ſelves worthy to undergoe all thoſe deadly evils, and that God may juſtly doe ſo; and more than ſo unto us, if he ſhould deale with us according to our ſinnes; by this meanes we ſhall ſave God a labour, and our ſelves a paine. For as on the contrary, to bleſſe our ſelves is the way to make God curſe us, Deut. 29. 20. Hee that bleſſeth himſelfe when he heareth the words of theſe curſes, ſaying, I ſhall have peace though I walke in the imaginations of my owne heart, adding drunkenneſſe to thirſt, (marke what followes) the Lord will be revenged upon the ſoule of ſuch a one, his anger and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this booke ſhall light upon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under heaven. This a man gets by bleſſing of himſelfe: whereas if thou wouldſt be bleſt of God, I doe not ſay, that thou ſhouldſt curſe thy ſelfe (farre be it from any ſervant of Chriſt ſo to doe) but this I would adviſe thee to doe, even with a ſorrowfull and a ſad heart, to ſay Amen to all the curſes in the Booke of God, to acknowledge and confeſſe that thou haſt juſtly deſerved, and that it is Gods onely mercy that thou haſt eſcaped them. So much for the firſt reaſon that may warrant Eliahs prayer; the next may be this.
                  2. Convenientia temporis, the fitneſſe and order of time when this was done, it was done in the time of the Law, which was uſed to ſuch judgements, they were then▪ accuſtomed to more terrible wonders, than are now ſutable to the ſweet and ſaving time of the Goſpel; obſerve the wonders that Moſes wrought in Egypt, what terrible, what

hurtfull, what miſcheivous wonders they were, he turned all their water into bloud, all their duſt into Lice, and ſpoiled all the fruits of the earth, and undid the whole Land▪ What a dreadfull wonder was that of Eliſha, 2 Reg. 2. when he curſed the children of Bethel that mocked him for his baldneſſe: One would have thought that a little diſcipline, a little correction, or ſending to their Parents or Maſters, would have ſufficed, and beene a ſufficient revenge for waggiſh unhappy boyes, that did not know their duty to a man of God: but hee lookes upon them with a direfull countenance, and curſed and banned them in the name of the Lord, and immediatly two Shee-beares came out of the Wood, and teare two and fortic of them in peices; what a horrible, what a terrible, what a miſcheivous wonder was this. Of the ſame kinde was that of Eliah, 2 Reg. Chap. 1. when the Captaine came with authority, to bid him come downe, and come before the King; hee might have anſwered, I cannot come, or the Lord appointed mee ſome other way to goe, &amp;c. but the next word we heare, is a word of Iudgement and Vengeance, If I be a man of God, let fire come downe from heaven, and conſume thee, and thy company: and ſo it did both them, and the reſt that came after on the ſame meſſage: Such wonders as theſe were uſuall in the time of the Law. But now looke to the Miracles and Wonders of our Saviour in the Goſpel, and you ſhall finde them to be of another nature, all of goodneſſe and mercy, all mercifull, all beneficiall, all healing Miracles, no way hurtfull or deſtructive of any mans life. Wee

                     ead of many a mans life that hee ſaved, many that hee recalled and reſtored, none that hee deſtroyed, no not one; being ſo reviled as hee was, ſo perſecuted, ſo laid for, ſo betraied, apprehended, condemned and crucified; yet what one man did our Saviour ſtriké dead for all theſe haynous indignities? Nay, hee was ſo farre from revenge, that hee prayed for their lives that ſought and wrought his death▪
                  
                  
                     
The moſt terribble wonders that ever our Saviour did, were but two, and thoſe no wayes prejudicious to the perſon or life of any man, woman, or childe. The one was his curſing and blaſting of the barren Figge-tree; and this was but ſymbolicall, not done in any ſpleene to the poore tree; but onely to ſhew his indignation againſt all unfruitfull profeſſion; when men make an outward ſhew of piety to God; but when the poore and hungry come to them (as Chriſt came to that Figtree) hoping to pull ſome fruite of charity and mercy from them, there is nothing to be found but leaves, good words perhaps, and that is all: beleeve it, ſuch men are nigh unto curſing, and it is Gods infinite mercie, if hee doe not blaſt their eſtate (as Chriſt did the Figtree) that it ſhall never proſper to them nor theirs. The other wonder of Chriſt that did any hurt, was that, Mat. Chapter eight. The drowning of the Swine, and yet that was the devils doing, Chriſt onely gave way to theſe evill ſpirits (which ſeeke the deſtruction of man and beaſt) to carry them headlong into the 
                        〈◊〉
                      (as they would carry us too, but that God above, who ſtiles himſelfe The preſerver of men, is pleaſed in mercy to keepe out of their clutches;) and this was ſymbolicall too, to let us underſtand how God hates all thoſe that are of a ſwiniſh diſpoſition; that is, all drunken ſots, that like ſwine, have neither wit nor grace to moderate themſelves in the uſe of Gods creatures; and all lazie beaſts that mind nothing but their bellies, (as you know) a Swine is one of the lazieſt creatures that a man can keepe, it doth him no worke, nor ſervice at all; or laſtly, All hoggiſh worldlings, and miſerable muck-wormes of the earth, that never doe good till they come to die: let all ſuch tremble and feare, and call to God for mercy, leaſt in his juſt judgement hee deliver their ſoules into the hands of thoſe helliſh Fiends to carry them headlong (as they did the ſwine) into the lake that burneth with fire and brimeſtone for evermore, there ſhall bee weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.
                  
                  
                     
Theſe are the two ſevereſt wonders that ever our Saviour did, or ſuffered to be done; as for all the reſt (looke into the Stories of the Goſpel, which are the Acts and Monuments of Ieſus Chriſt) you ſhall finde to be all gracious, all beneficiall, all healing and ſaving wonders. Never any man came to him for ſight, that went away blind; never any came to him for hearing, that went away deafe; never any came to him for health, that went away ſicke. In a word, you ſhall never finde that ever any man or woman came to our Saviour for any help or mercy, that ever went away confounded or diſappointed of their hopes. Now beloved, Chriſt is the ſame Ieſus ſtill, that then he was: Coelum non animum (as we ſay) though he have changed his place, he hath not changed his nature, but is ſtill as favourable, as indulgent to mankind as ever he was, if we doe but as truly ſeeke unto him for our ſoules health, as they did for their bodies.
                  So you ſee the nature of theſe wonders is altered from that they were in Eliahs times: the ſeverity of the Law ſuites not with the lenity of the Goſpel; and we muſt now imitate our Saviour in works of mercy, &amp; not follow Eliah in prayers for judgment. We ſee, Luk 9. 54. When the diſciples fingers itched to be revenged on the Samaritans for their baſe diſcourteſie in not entertaining our Saviour; Maſter, (ſaid they) wilt thou that we command fire from heaven, and conſume them, as Eliah did? We have a preſident for it, it is a booke caſe, Eliah did ſo, let us doe the like, theſe men deſerve it, as bad or worſe than they with whom Eliah had to doe: No, (ſaith our Saviour, the caſe is altered) ye know not of what ſpirit ye are; the ſpirit of the Law required ſeverity, the ſpirit of the Goſpel requires meekeneſſe and mercy. Farre is it from the good Spirit of Chriſt and of God to ſtirre up any mans heart to private revenge; not an Eagle, but a Dove was the ſhape wherein that holy and healthfull Spirit made choiſe to appeare. Let us therefore all that are called Chriſtians, follow no other preſident, but

our Saviour Chriſts; whoſe onely leſſon that ever he ſet us to learne of him, was

                     owne ſoules.
                  
                  The third and laſt reaſon that may warrant Eliah in praying for a judgement, was,
                  3. Neceſſitas rei, the neceſſity of the thing it ſelf; that holy Prophet had ſpent his ſtrength in vaine, Sermon upon Sermon, warning upon warning, threatning upon threatning; and when he ſaw that nothing would worke them to goodneſſe, then he prayes for a judgement; not in a vindictive way to be revenged upon them, but as a deſperate remedy, knowing that, that or nothing would bring them to good, as it is ſaid, 2 Chron. ult. God ſent his Prophets, riſing early and ſending them, and uſed all gentle meanes to reclaime them, till there was no remedy, then he ſent deſtruction. In this ſence, if a man have a child, or a friend, or any one that he wiſheth well to his ſoule; if he be growen to that paſſe, ſo hardned in ſinne, that no perſwaſions, no warnings, no threatnings will worke upon him; I am perſwaded, it were neither uncharitable, nor unpleaſing to God, if a man ſhould pray; Lord ſmite him, correct him, lay ſome medicinall, ſome healing puniſhment upon him, that he may ſee the errour of his wayes, and may returne and repent, and ſo be ſaved.
                  Vpon theſe and the like grounds, I ſuppoſe Eliah might with a ſafe conſcience pray for a judgement: but then the next queſtion is, Why hee ſhould make choiſe to pray for this kinde of judgement, of drought and dearth, for want of raine; rather than any other. I will tell you what I think the reaſons may be.
                  1. Becauſe it was an uncontrouleable, a convincing judgement; if Eliah ſhould have brought any earthly or viſible judgement, as Sword or Peſtilence, &amp;c. they would have imputed it preſently to ſome ſecondary meanes and cauſes; now this was a heavenly an inviſible judgement, the ſtoppage

of the cloudes, the detaining of Raine, and the burning and ſcorching of the 
                        〈…〉
                      judgement from heaven and

                      needes confeſſe to be Digitus the 
                     
                        〈…〉
                      
                     God, not Aliqnid humani, no handy worke of any mortall man. For this was the fallacy which the Scribes and Phariſes put upon our Saviour Mat. 16. 1. When they had ſeene all the miracles and wonders of Chriſt, how hee cured the ſicke, &amp;c. they conceited that theſe things might be done by ſlight of hand, by art Magicke, by Beelzebub, or by Conjuration, &amp;c but (ſay they) Shew us aſigne from Heaven and then we will beleeve. They knew that a Magician or a devill might doe much upon earth, but he could doe nothing in heaven; therefore (ſay they) ſhew us a ſigne from Heaven and we will beleeve. So here to prevent all miſconceites Elias prayed and procures a judgement from heaven; and that a convincing a cutting judgement; for you muſt know that the people at that time left off to worſhip the true God, and fell to worſhip Baall, the Sunne, the Moone, and all the Hoaſt of Heaven: truſting no doubt that theſe gods of theirs, would by their influence ſo moyſten and fatten the earth, that they ſhould not need to be beholding to God for any rayne: now (quoth Eliah) here is a judgement to try your gods withall, goe to the gods that ye have ſerved, let them helpe now or never, if they can doe any thing, they can ſend a ſhowre of rayne, if not, why doe ye ſerve them? I ſay it was a convincing judgement. Eliah did it on purpoſe, to let them ſee the vileneſſe of their Idolatry, what baſe, what impotent, what unworthy gods they ſerved, that could not helpe their clyents to a drop of raine. In like manner, whatſoever a man makes his god, beſides the true one; I meane, puts his truſt in, for helpe in time of neede; ſhall at length ſo deceive him, and ſo befoole him, that he ſhall be forced to confeſſe, as theſe people did in the end; The Lord he is God, The Lord he is God.
                  
                  2. Becauſe it was a juſt and a fitting puniſhment; this

people were guilty of ſpirituall barrenneſſe, and God plagued them with temporall barrenneſſe. No Nation under heaven was ſo husbanded, and manured of God, ſo watered with the dewes of heaven, I meane, with the meanes of grace and ſalvation, as they were, and yet none more unfruitful in every good work: Now therefore Eliah fits them with a judgement ſutable and agreeable to their ſinne: hee prayes to God that it might not raine, that ſo their lands might be anſwerable to their lives, and their ſoyles become as barren as their ſoules. Thus it▪ pleaſeth God many times to pay men in their owne coyne, to come home to them in their owne kinde, and to fit his puniſhments according to their ſinnes. That as they that ſinne in their goods, by miſgetting miskeeping, and miſpending them, are many times puniſhed in their goods, by loſſes, and croſſes, by fire, by water, &amp;c. And as they that ſinne in their children, by miſloving, or miſnurturing them, are oft times puniſhed in their children, as David was in Abſolom and Adonijah; ſo they that ſinne in their lands; it is juſt with God to puniſh them in their lands: Salomon tells us, Prov. 21. 4. that the plowing of a wicked man is ſinne. That is ſtrange; the husbandry and tillage of the ground is generally held to be one of the moſt honeſt, the moſt innocent, the moſt harmeleſſe callings in the world; and ſo it is of it ſelfe; and yet we ſee, when a wicked man takes the plow in hand; when a man goes to his plow with an ill minde, and an ill conſcience, his very plowing addes to his ſinnes. And it is juſt with God, that that land which is plowed ſinfully ſhould thrive accordingly, and become as bad and as barren as the owner. A fruitfull land doth God make barren, for the wickedneſſe of them that dwell therein.
                  
                  3. Becauſe it was a ſenſible, and a palpable judgement. As God Almighty told Cain, Gen. 4. 7. that he ſhould be curſed from the earth. The Lord knew that Caine cared not to be curſed from heaven, and to be baniſhed from the preſence of God, and branded for a Reprobate; but to be curſed from the earth, to be curſed in earthly things (he

being a tiller of the earth) that would goe neareſt to his heart of any judgement. Even ſuch is the diſpoſition of every man of the earth (as David termes earthly-minded men) they doe not value nor care to be curſed from heaven, to be excommunicated out of the favour of God, and out of the bleſſed company of all faithfull people (which cenſure of excomunication if it be rightly carried with a Clave non errante (as the Schoolemen ſpeake) when there is no errour committed in the uſe of the Keyes, is one of the greateſt puniſhments under heaven.) But carnall men are not ſenſible of this, and therefore God will puniſh them in that wherein they are ſenſible, in their wives and children, in their corne and cattell, &amp;c. in ſuch things as are neereſt and deareſt to them: as when David ſlung his ſtone at Goliah, if he had ſtrucke him upon any part of his harneſſe, he had never felt the blow, but ſtriking him (as he did) in the forehead, which was naked and tender, that ſunke him preſently: ſo it is with carnall men, for ſpirituall judgements, they are harneſſed, their hearts are hardned, their conſciences are ſeared, they have (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a horny hoofe (as it were) growne over their hearts, that makes them inſenſible of any ſpirituall blow that can light upon them. Therefore Almighty God, knowing in what part they lie naked, in what kinde they are tenderly affected, namely, in their affection to earthly things, ſtrikes them there, plagues them in that, and that 
                        •
                     inkes them like Nabal, whoſe heart died within him like a ſtone. As we ſee in Exodus, how Pharaoh and the Egyptians hardned their heart, and out ſtood all the plagues of Egypt, till God plagued them in their children, and that broke their hearts. So beleeve it, they that care not for ſpirituall puniſhments (for the loſſe of Gods favour, the loſſe of heaven, the loſſe and perill of their owne ſoules) God will finde a time to puniſh them in that which they do and ſhal care for, in their corne, in their ſubſtance, in that which is neereſt and 
                        •
                     eareſt 
                        •
                     o th
                        •
                     : As he did theſe Iſraelites here, becauſe they were not

ſenſible of the want of grace. God puniſht them with that would make them ſenſible, with the want of raine; that when they had plowed &amp; ſowne their land, and beſtowed all their care and coſt, all ſhould be in vaine, for want of moiſture to refreſh the earth. Theſe or the like reaſons (I ſuppoſe) might move Eliah to pray and procure this kinde of judgement.
                  By the way, if any man deſire to know the reaſon, why God is not thus marvelous in the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as he was in Eliah, and thoſe other Prophets of the Law; why we that are his Evangelicall Prophets cannot doe ſuch wonders in our dayes, as they did in theirs? Anſw. though that ſame donum miraculorum, the gift of Miracles be ceaſed in the Church, now that the Goſpel hath taken roote: (as Husbandmen when they tranſplant a tree, at firſt, they ſet props and ſtaies to ſhore it up, but after it hath taken roote, they plucke away the ſtayes, and let it grow by the ordinary influence of the heavens;) I ſay though the gift of working wonders be ceaſed, yet miracles and wonders in an another kind never ceaſe, but are wrought daily by the Preachers of the Goſpel. For you muſt know that the micles under the Goſpel are of a differing nature from the miraracles under the Law: thoſe were 
                        
                           •
                        cularia miracula (as I may fitly call them) eye-miracles, that were viſible and outwardly apparent to be ſeene; but theſe are Auricularia miracula, Eare-miracles, ſecret and inviſible, wrought in the heart by the Word and Spirit of God, entring in at the eare, and going downe into the ſoule. Though we cannot command, or forbid the raine to water the earth, as Eliah did; if we can water and mollifie the earthen hearts of men with the ſupernaturall raine of heavenly Doctrine, and make a dry and barren ſoule beare fruit to God; Is not this as great a wonder as the other? Though we cannot cauſe nor command the thunder (as Samuel did) to terrifie the people for their ſinnes; yet God hath his Boanerges, his ſonnes of thunder ſtill, that by ratling from heaven the terrible judgements of God againſt ſinne and ſinners, are able to make the ſtouteſt

and the proudeſt heart upon earth, even tremble and quake, and fall downe before the preſence of God; and is not this as great a miracle as that of Samuel, to bring an unhumbled ſinner upon his knees, and make glad to cry God mercy for his ſinnes? In a word, though wee cannot caſt out devils out of mens bodies, as the diſciples of Chriſt could doe; if we can caſt the devill out of mens ſoules, by the powerfull Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt; is it not as great a wonder? Beleeve it brethren, the converſion of a ſinner to God, and bringing of a ſoule to heaven, is abſolutely without compariſon the greateſt miracle, the greateſt wonder in the world. And theſe be the miracles wherewith it pleaſeth God to grace the Miniſters of the Goſpel; therefore ye obſerve, that the Collect for Miniſters, runnes thus, Almighty God which onely workeſt great marvels, &amp;c. When a ſoule is ſicke to the death, with a ſurfeit of ſinne, is recovered and revived againe by that ſame healthfull ſpirit of grace, which God together with his Word doth breathe into the ſoule, it is ſo great a marvell, ſo rare a wonder, that the Angels of heaven rejoyce to ſee it.
                  I have held you over-long in the former part of Eliahs prayer; which brought the judgment: heare now in a word or two, the Reverſing of the judgement, and I have done. [And he prayed again, &amp; the heavens gave raine, and the earth brought forth her fruit.] It well becomes the Prophets of God to be mercifull; Good Eliah had not the heart to hold the people too long under a judgement, when hee ſaw hee had done enough to humble them▪ he deſires God to reverſe the judgement. As it is obſerved of the good Angels in the old and new Teſtament, when they appeared to any, either man or woman; their method and manner was this, Primò terrent, deinde laetiſica
                           •
                        t, they firſt terrified them, and put them into feare, then preſently comforted them and put them out of feare. Thus did Eliah with this people; thus did Moſes with Pharaoh, that good man had not the heart to hold wicked Pharoah alway under a judgement, but upon

the leaſt entreaty made ſuit to God to reverſe it. So dealt the Prophet with Ieroboam, 1 Reg. 13. 6. when he had ſmitten him with a judgment, and had him at the advantage, that his hand was withered, Ieroboam was glad to ſubmit and ſay, Intreate now the face of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be reſtored me: the man of God had not the heart to deny him, but immediatly, beſought the Lord, and the Kings hand was reſtored, and became as it was before. When a judgement comes, then Prophets are in ſeaſon. Abraham is better than a King in this caſe, Gen. 20. 7. &amp; 17. Reſtore the man his own, for he is a Prophet, and he ſhall pray for thee; and ver. 17. Abraham prayed unto God, and God healed Abimeleeh▪ &amp;c. Goe to my ſervant Iob (ſaith God to his friends, Iob 42. 8.) and my ſervant Iob ſhall pray for you, for him will I accept. So Act. 8. 24. When Peter had denounced a curſe on Simon Magus, he was glad to crouch and cry unto him, Oh pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of theſe things which ye have ſpoken come upon me. Thus ye ſee that judgements and plagues will bring Prophets into requeſt: men commonly deale with their Miniſters, as boyes do by Walnut-trees, and other fruit-trees, in faire weather throw cudgels at us, in foule runne to us for ſhelter. In the dayes of peace and proſperity we are paſt over as ſuperfluous creatures of whom there is little uſe, and leſſe neede: but when the wrath of God falls on the naked ſoule, when the conſcience is wounded within, and body pained without, then the Miniſter is thought on. I ſay no more, if you deſire their prayers, and that God ſhould heare them praying for you in your extremity, do not ſlight them, doe not wrong them in proſperity. Remember how Ahab and all Iſrael were glad to be beholden to Eliah to reverſe their judgment; and you doe not know how ſoone the caſe may be your owne: therefore as you love your ſoules, love thoſe that have charge of them.
                  
                     And he prayed againe, &amp;c. When I looke into the Story, 1 Reg. 18. I can finde no direct prayer that Eliah made for

raine. But I 
                        •
                     iud there a twofold prayer that he made. 1. A virtuall. 2. A formall prayer▪
                  
                  1. A virtuall prayer, not for raine, but for their converſion, Oh Lord, (ſaith Eliah) bring backe, or b
                           •
                        ing home the heart of this people unto thee; verſ. 73. and this includes all other prayers that can be made. A prayer for Converſion is a prayer for every thing. Ier. 31. 18. When Ep
                           •
                        ratm prayes for converſion, Turne thou me, and I ſhall be turned: (ſaith God) I will ſurely have mercy upon him, &amp;c. Such is the goodneſſe of God, that he will with-hold no good thing, (be it raine, be it plenty, be it any thing that is good for them) from them that are converted, and brought home by true repentance to him. Therefore if thou ſtandeſt in neede of any temporall mercy, pray firſt for converſion, and all other good things ſhall be ſuper-added and throwne in unto thee; or if thou prayeſt for any child, or for any friend to doe him good indeed, pray for his converſion, and thou prayeſt for every thing: that one prayer is inſtar omnium, inſteed of all the reſt. If hee be in an ill way, deſire God to bring him backe, and for future things take no care.
                  2 A formall prayer, when he ſaw that the people were truely humbled, and that their hearts were indeed brought home to God, inſomuch that they cried out, with an ingemmination, The Lord he is God, the Lord he is God; then hee buckles his head betweene his knees (to ſhew the humble proſtration of his ſoule) and falls a praying to God for raine. After humiliation any prayer comes in ſeaſon, Eſay 1. Waſh ye, make ye cleane, put away the evill of your doings, &amp;c. And now come (ſaith God) and we will reaſon together, now let us parle, now let us confeſſe, now pray, and I will heare you. Iud. 10. 17. When the Iſraelites put away their ſtrange gods, and turned themſelves to the true God by ſincere repentance and reformation; the text ſaith, His ſoule was grieved for the miſery of Iſrael: thus the onely way to eaſe our owne ſoules of griefe, or to be rid of any grievous judgement, is to Grieve the ſoule of God, that is, to humble our

ſelves before him, to pray and ſeeke his face, and to turne from our wicked wayes, and God will be even grieved himſelfe that ever puniſhed, plagued, and put us to griefe; and he will returne (as he ſaith) and have mercy on us, and will doe us good after he hath done us hurt. Here then (in a word) is the ready way to prevaile with God, either for raine▪ or for faire weather, or for any temporall bleſſing whatſoever, to doe as Eliah did, buckle our very heads betweene our knees, I meane, proſtrate our ſelves before the face of God, in the humbleſt, in the lowlieſt, in the moſt dejected manner, that we can device, and if any meanes under heaven will fetch downe mercy from heaven, that will doe it. Eliah prayed againe, and the heavens gave raine, and the earth brought forth her fruit. Now to God the Father, God the Sunne, God the Holy Ghoſt, be aſcribed and given, all honour and glory, be done and performed all ſervice and duty, from this time forth for evermore.

                  A WINTER SERMON.
                  
                     Pſal. 147. verſ. 16, 17, 18.
                     He giveth ſnow like wooll; he ſcattereth the hoary froſt like aſhes: He caſteth foorth his Ice like morſells; who is able to abide his cold? He ſendeth out his word and melteth them; He bloweth with his wind, and the waters flow.
                  
                  
                     THE laſt time I was in this place, I preached you a Summer-Sermon (out of Eliahs prayer, Iames 5. 17.) it being then a time of extraordinarie heate and drought; I am now come up (through Gods mercifull preſervation) to preach you a Winter-Sermon, ſuch as the extremity of the weather, and the miſery of the waies hath even enforced me to fall upon, beſides my purpoſe and intention; that ſo, by a kinde of ſpirituall Antiperiſtaſis, your ſoules may receive ſome warmth within, whiles your bodies are

encompaſſed with ſo much cold without, for this end, I have made choiſe of ſuch a text, as will teach us to make good uſe of all manner of winter weather; whether it be ſnow, or froſt, or Ice, or floods, or what ever elſe it be, there is ſtill ſome good uſe to be made of it, if men had but grace to apply their mindes and hearts unto it.
                  Which that you may the better doe, be pleaſed to obſerue with me foure generall points, which may bee reduced to foure ſeverall heads, and be thus expreſſed. 1. The providence of God, or the care that God hath to cloath and keepe warme the very earth as it were with a Garment of wooll▪ 
                     (dat nivem ſicut lanam, He giveth ſnow like wooll) 2. The diligence of God (if I may ſo terme it) that in the cold and bitter evenings, when we are cloſe and warme by the fire, or when wee are at reſt and warme in our beds, then is our God abroad at worke, ſprinkling and ſcattering the hoary or the aſhy froſt for the health and welfare both of man and beaſt (ſpargit pruinam ſicut cinerem, he ſcattereth or ſprinkleth the hoary froſt like aſhes.) 3. The ſeverity of God, whereby hee returneth men the ſame meaſure which they themſelves have mete unto others: becauſe for the moſt part mens morſels are like Ice, that is, they come hardly, and coldly, and cruelly from them, to the poore and hungry; therefore God comes home to them in their owne kinde, and payes them (as it were) with their owne coyne, and gives them Ice like morſells, to be both a remembrance, &amp; a revenge of their miſerable Inhoſpitalitie (proijcit glaciem ſuam ſicut buccellas, He caſteth forth his Ice like moſells▪) 4. Laſtly, ſee the goodneſſe and the tender mercy of God; that when God ſeeth the weather is growne to that extremity, that people are not able to abide his cold, then he hath compaſſion upon mens infirmities, and (as it followeth in the text) emittit verbum, &amp; liquefacit &amp;c. Hee ſendeth out his word and melteth them, he bloweth with his winde, &amp; the waters flow. Theſe bee the ſeverall parts and branches of my text, of each whereof, I will endeavour to ſpeake, as briefly, and

as effectually as God and his good ſpirit ſhall enable mee. And firſt of the providence of God in cloathing the very earth.
                  
                     Dat nivem ſicut lanam, He giveth ſnow like woll.
                  
                  1. The firſt thing I obſerve from hence is this, that the ſnow doth not onely come by the courſe of the planets, or by the coldneſſe of the Climate, or by the vertue of any ſecondary meanes and cauſes; but it is Donum Dei, the gift of God; The ſame God that gave us theſe ſoules, is he that gives us theſe ſnowes, to bee a covering and a garment to the naked earth: farre bee it from us therefore to murmure or repine, or thinke our ſelves agreeved with God for ſending us ſuch ſnowie weather, to hinder our husbandry, to pinch our cattell, and to ſpend our ſtover, &amp;c. but let us learne of David, to give God the glory of all his gifts; and ſit downe and ſay as Elie did, 1. Sam. 3. 18. It is the Lord, let him doe what ſeemeth him good, for whatſoever ſeemeth good to him, cannot but be good, how ever it ſeemes to us. Conſider (I beſeech you) wherefore is it, that the ſnow, and haile, and ſtorme and tempeſt are bidden and commanded to praiſe God. Pſal. 148. 8. and thinke with your ſelves, how or which way thoſe ſenceles inanimate things can performe that honour to their maker, unles it bee by the Ejaculations and expreſſions of the heart and tongue of man, which is the onely Lyra animata the living harpe of God, to ſound forth his prayſes, and ſet forth his glory for all his gifts and benefits; Alaſſe thoſe liveleſſe creatures cannot doe it of themſelves, but they muſt doe it by us, or rather indeede it is we that are commanded to doe it for them. Wherefore elſe hath God given to man the uſe of the tongue with language and words to expreſſe himſelfe, which hee hath denied to all other creatures beſides, but onely that Man ſhould bee (as it were) The mouth of all his other creatures, to praiſe and glorifie God in their ſted, and in their behalfe. If any of us ſhall thinke much to do ſo little for our God, let us take heede that God

doe not doe by us, as hee threatned to doe by thoſe Prieſts, Mal. 2. 2. Even to curſe our very bleſſings, and to make thoſe things which are bleſſings in themſelves, to bee little better then croſſes and curſes unto us. For God can give us bleſſings with ſuch a tang that the fruition ſhall differ little from the want, as he did to the Iſraelites when he gave them quailes; ſo God gives many a man children with ſo little grace, that they would have accounted it even a bleſſing to be barren: ſo God gives many a man wealth with ſo little comfort, that it had beene better for their ſoules, if they had begged their bread: ſo God can give us ſnow and raine with ſo little favour, that neither we, nor the earth ſhall receive any comfort or refreſhment by it. Therefore as we deſire to doe our ſelves good, and to have and to hold the good will of our heavenly father, that he ſhould proſper and bleſſe his bleſſings to us; then let us in no caſe withhold from God the Honour due unto his name, but returne him ſome glory for all his gifts; for what man will goe into a cold bed to warme it, but he lookes for warmth from it againe: what man will give his friend a ring, but he hopes that he will weare it for his ſake, or give him a booke, but he hopes he will reade it for his ſake, or give him any token of love, but that he hopes he will accept it and keepe it for his ſake: and ſhall we thinke that God doth not looke for as much as this at our hands, when hee give us ſnow and froſts, &amp;c. beleeve it hee doth; and therefore if thou haſt beene defective this way, let me be thy monitour, to doe as Pharaohs Butler did, Gen. 41. 9. to call to minde thy fault this day; and to remember that it is thy part and duty to bleſſe God for all his bleſſings; as well for thoſe which thou enjoyeſt in common with others, (as good ayre, good weather, &amp;c.) as for thoſe that thou haſt in peculiar and proper to thy ſelfe; hath God given thee health? bleſſe him for it: hath he given thee wealth? bleſſe him for it; hath hee given thee children and friends, and peaceable dayes? bleſſe him for all theſe: but hath hee given thee his good

word to inſtruct thee? Hath he given thee his good Spirit to comfort thee? Hath hee given thee his good grace to preſerve and keepe thy ſoule? Oh bleſſe him for this above all, for hee hath given thee with it, that which I pray God of his mercy to give us all. Health and ſalvation in Ieſus Chriſt. So much for my firſt Obſervation, that the very Snow amongſt other things, is Donum Dei, the gift of God. [He giveth Snow.]
                  
                  2. Further more, Iob tels us that the Snow is Nuntius Dei, the meſſenger or the ſervant of God, Iob

Thus you ſhall obſerve, that all the creatures, and all the Workes of God, both in heaven and earth, doe in their wayes, and in their kindes ſhew themſelves obedient and dutifull to their Maker, except onely man, and the devill; if God ſpeake to the Windes (though unruly creatures) they obey him, if to the Seas, to the Whales, to the Lyons, &amp;c. they obey him; if God doe but call for a dearth (as the Prophet told the Shunammite, 2 Reg. 8. 1.) or a famine, or for any other judgement, they come at the firſt call, and flie upon the world to plague it for ſinne; you cannot name any creature except man, but is ready at the leaſt becke of God to fulfill his Word. Ah what wretched creatures are we, that can find none in all the world to comply with, but the devill; that can find no other patterne for our diſobedience, no other partner in our rebellious courſes, but we muſt fetch a preſident from hell, and from the bottomleſſe pit. Is it not ſtrange? that whereas Divines obſerve, that God was never called Lord in Scripture till he had created man, as you may ſee in the firſt of Geneſis, where it is ſaid, that God created the heaven and earth; and God ſaid let there be light, &amp;c. only God without any other attribute; till he had made man, and then the text calls him the Lord God at every word, to intimate that God hath a ſpeciall Lordſhip and Dominion over man, and looks for more ſpeciall duty and ſervice from man, than from all

his other creatures: I ſay then, Is it not ſtrange, that no one creature of Gods making doth ſo much diſhonour and diſobey the Lord, as wicked, wretched man; whom the Lord purpoſely made to honour and obey, and doe him ſervice. Look to all the other creatures, and David tells you, they no fooner receive the leaſt word of command from God, but preſently they fulfill it, Pſal. 148. 8.

                     ath any care, or makes any conſcience to fulfill the Word of God (as thoſe creatures doe?) There be thoſe that will goe a mile or two to heare a Sermon▪ but where ſhall you finde one that will goe out of his owne doore to doe a Sermon? I meane, to doe as God would have him; that is, to repent of his ſinnes, to reforme his life, to follow his calling with a good conſcience, and to walke with his God with an honeſt heart, which is the principall and the maine of Chriſtianity? You know that Hearing is but a part of that ſervice we owe to God; as our Saviour intimates in the Goſpel, where he ſaith, that Mary hath choſen the better part: It is the doing of Gods Will, and the fulfilling of his Word, that makes our ſervice entire and compleate, and ſuch as God would have it. This leſſon, if we will not learne it by the Scriptures, we may learn it of the very ſenceleſſe creatures, of the very Snow in my text; for (ſaith Iob) God doth but ſpeake to the Snow, and ſay, Be thou on the earth; and there it reſts, till God removes it. This is my ſecond obſervation, that the Snow is nuntius dei, the meſſenger and ſervant of God, and may teach man obedience to his Maker. Therefore Chriſt expoſtulateth it as an abſurd thing in men to cry
                     
                     Lord, Lord, (i) to profeſſe and ingominate a verball ſubjection; whereas really and indeed they would not doe ſo much for God as the very ſenceleſſe and bruitiſh creatures.
                  3. Moreover, Iob tells us, Cha. 38. 22. that God hath▪ 
                     Theſaures nivis; Treaſures of Snow, which he reſerveth and keepeth in ſtore againſt ſuch time as the earth ſhall ſtand moſt in neede of it; and ſo you ſhall obſerve in Scripture, that God hath treaſures in ſtore for all kind of mercies. He hath a treaſure of raine (as Iob tells us in the ſame place) that is, in the ſcorching heat of Summer, when the earth doth even rend, and ſplit, and gaſpe for want of moyſture, as if it were ready (as it w
                        •

                           ••••
                        ching raine, that refreſheth the bowels of the earth, and maketh the very Vallies (as David ſpakes) even to laugh and ſing. The ſame Prophet David tels us Pſal. 17. 14. that God hath Theſaurum alimonia, a treaſure of foode, and proviſion for the belley [Whoſe bellies thou filleſt with thy hid treaſure.] that is, In time of dearth and famine when the city ſhalbe forced to cry to the country, as the man did to Paul, Act. 16. 9. Come out of Macedonia, and helpe us: and when the countrey ſhall thinke (as that Nobleman did. 2. Reg. 7.) that the ſcarcitie of proviſion is ſo great, that if the Lord ſhould make windowes in heaven, it would all be little enough to fill the bellies of the people: then doth God of his goodneſſe provide for the poore, then doth he goe to his ſecret and hidden treaſure, and by wayes unlikely and unexpected, doth God take order for their reliefe that put their truſt in him. Beyond all theſe, God hath one Treaſure more, more worth than all the reſt, and that is Theſaurus Gratia the treaſure of his grace and goodneſſe, which he hath hidden, and laid up in the Breaſt and Boſome of Ieſus Chriſt, Coloſ. 2. 3. In him (ſaith the Apoſtle) are hid the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge. Therefore as in Egypt, they that wanted any corne went all to Ioſeph, who had the Treaſures and Storehouſes

in his owne keeping; ſo let all that want grace, repare to Ieſus Chriſt, who is the Lord high Treaſurer of the graces of God.
                  Now theſe treaſures of grace are ſaid to be hid in Chriſt, not as Moſes body was hidden by the Angel, to the intent that it ſhould not be found; but as the woman in the Goſpel, Mat. 13. is ſaid to hide her leaven in the meale, that the vertue of it may be diffuſed and diſperſed into every bit of her bread. In this ſence, doth God hide his graces in the heart of Ieſus Chriſt, that all we that are his ſinful members may have a taſte and a reliſh of the ſame graces that are in him: according to that, Ioh. 1. 16. Of his fulneſſe we all receive grace for grace: that is, (as one ſweetly expounds it) as a child in generation receiveth 
                        〈◊〉
                      his parents member for member; or as the paper from the Preſſe receiveth letter for letter; or as the glaſſe from the face receiveth Image for Image; ſo do we from Ieſus Chriſt receive grace for grace; that is, for every grace that is in Chriſt, (appertaining to a generall ſanctification, as humility, zeale, devotion, &amp;c.) there is a grace in us (if we belong to him) in ſome meaſure and proportion anſwerable and agreeable to the ſame in him. Thus

Thus you ſee, that God hath treaſures for all mercies, and indeede his treaſures are all, and onely for mercy; as for that ſame treaſure of wrath, Rom. 2. 5. that is ours, and none of Gods; God treaſures up nothing but mercy; it is we that ſtore and fill his treaſure with wrath, as the Apoſtle ſaith, Thou, (O wicked man) after the hardneſſe of thy heart treaſureſt up wrath for thy ſelfe againſt the day of wrath; God doth not treaſure up wrath for thee, nor for any man elſe, but thou treaſureſt and ſtoreſt it up for thy ſelf; and therefore if God pay

he that is ſo carefull to cloathe the earth, will have a greater care to cloath thee, if thou belongeſt to heaven.
                  Laſtly, from hence, they that are rich in this world, may learne (in a contrary ſence to that of Lucifer) to be ſimiles altiſſimo like to the moſt high God, I meane in goodneſſe and tender-mercie; we uſe to ſay dives quaſi divus, to intimate that a rich man ſhould be to the poore, as Moſes was to Aaron, in ſome fence a God, Exod. 4. to ſuccour and defend them in the time of need: ſo then, look how God above doth in the Summer time refreſh the bowels of the earth with raine, and in the Winter time keepe warme the backe of it with Snow: ſo ſhould they Philemon-like, refreſh the bowels of the poore that are pinched with hunger; and Dorcas-like provide ſome cloathing for the backes of the poore, that are not able to cloath themſelves. It is recorded of Iob to his eternall happineſſe and honour, that the loynes of the poore did bleſſe him, being warmed with the fleece of his flocke. Oh what a bleſſed thing it is to have the bleſſing of the poore and the bleſſing of God into the bargaine, and all for the offalls of a mans eſtate. Such a man ſhal be bleſſed in his name, bleſſed in his perſon, bleſſed in his poſterity: God will bleſſe a charitable minded man, men will bleſſe him, heaven will bleſſe him; earth will bleſſe him, all that ever have beene comforted or cloathed by him will bleſſe him too▪ their backes will bleſſe him, their bellies will bleſſe him, their ſoules will bleſſe him; his houſe ſhalbe filled with bleſſings, as a cruell mans houſe is filled with curſes. Therefore as David ſaid of the men of Iabez, when newes was brought him that they had buried the bones of Saul, 2 Sam. 2. 5. Bleſſed be ye of the Lord, the Lord recompence you this mercy: So may I ſay of a mercifull minded man, bleſſed be ſuch a man of the Lord, the Lord will ſurely recompence him, mercy for mercy, kindneſſe for kindneſſe, and whatſoever coſt he hath beſtowed upon earth, he ſhall finde it a hundred fold with God in heaven. This leſſon, men of wealth and ability may learne of the very Snow, or rather of the God that ſends it▪ not to lay all upon

                  I had a conceit as I come by the way, that the Snow did carry in it a lively reſemblance of the ſtate of this world, in ſundry paſſages, I will but name them, and leave them to your conſideration.
                  1. As the earth lies warme under the Snow, and feeles not the bitter blaſts of winde and froſt, which other poore creatures ſhrinke and ſmart for; ſo fares it with the rich men of this world, that lie warme with their wealth about them, and have no feeling nor compaſſion of the cold and hunger, the miſeries and neceſſities of their poorer brethren. So Dives being warme within, had no feeling of poore Lazarus without: now Dives ſignifies a rich man, and Lazarus (in the Originall) ſignifies one qui auxilio deſtitutus eſt, One that ſtands in neede of helpe; and the intent of the Parable is to ſhew, that the rich are commonly as deſtitute of pitty, as the poore are deſtitute of helpe, the one hath little or no feeling of the other ſufferings.
                  2. You may obſerve how the Snow goes by drifts, the Wind fetcheth it off from one place to fill up another, many a piece of ground is made naked and bare, to fill up ſome ditch, or pile up againſt ſome hedge, and there it lies to keep thoſe places warme that were warme before: Even ſo doth the wealth of this world goe by drifts; the winde of adverſitie fetcheth it off from one man to fill up the unſatiable ditch of another man; and many a mans meanes (like the Snow) is blowne cleane away from him and his poſterity into the hands of Vſurers and rich Oppreſſoins, to keepe them warme that were warme already, to increaſe their wealth that had too much before▪ juſt as Nabo

                  4. The Snow blindes a mans eyes, that when he comes into a darke roome, he can ſcarce diſcerne any thing: Thus are many a mans eyes dazled with the vanities and vices of the world, that when hee ſhould come to looke inward into the darke corners of his heart, to ſee how the caſe ſtands betwixt God and his ſoule, like the blinded Sodomites, he gropes at noone-day, and cannot finde the doore of Gods mercy to enter at. Salomon ſaith, that gifts blinde the eyes of the wiſe; In the Originall it is Pickim: ſuch as have their eyes open; the meaning is, that corruption and briberie ſo dazleth many a wiſe man, that though his eyes be open to the world-ward, to hell-ward, they are blinde to God-ward, and to heaven-ward, and cannot ſee into the things that belong to the right way of pleaſing of God, and ſaving their owne ſoules.
                  5. As many a dunghil, and many a dirty ſlough is hid under a drift of Snow, that a man can neither ſee it nor ſuſpect it: ſo is many a baſe minde, many a falſe heart hid under a faire outſide, that will make profeſſion and promiſes of favour and friendſhip to a man in proſperity; but let him be caſt or driven upon them in adverſitie, he ſhall finde them like a rotten quagmire under a heape of Snow, a meanes rather to ſinke him, than to ſave or ſuccour him at ſuch a time.
                  6. Laſtly, as Leontius ſaid once to his ſonnes, pointing with his finger to his gray-haires, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  Theſe thoughts came in upon the by, and therefore I will not ſtand to enlarge them, but haſten to the next general part of my text, as it followeth in the next place, Spargit pruinam ſicut cinerē; he ſcattereth or ſprinkleth the hoary froſt like aſhes.

The conſideration hereof ſhould move us, not onely to praiſe God for his Day-mercies, as David did [Seven times a day will I praiſe thee (ſaith he) Pſal. 119.] becauſe hee knew that ſo, and more than ſo often he was beholding to God every day that came over his head: but alſo wee have juſt cauſe to remember God for his Night-mercies, for his preſervation and protection, for his cuſtody and care that hee hath of us in the night, as well as in the day time. Have I not remembred thee on my bed (ſaith David elſewhere) and thought upon thee when I was waking, Pſal. 63. 7. So, if thou haſt forgotten God at thy board, remember him on thy bed▪ if thou haſt not thought upon him in the day, thinke upon him the more in the night, and when at any time God holdeth thy eyes waking (as he did Davids often) then conſider and call to minde Gods mercies, and thine owne ſinnes, be thankefull for the one, be humbled for the other, and then lie downe in the peace of Ieſus Chriſt. And in the morning when thou walkeſt a broad, and ſeeſt the hoary froſt lie upon the ground like aſhes; then thinke with

thy ſelfe, this is the worke of Gods owne hands, God hath ſurely beene in this place, and I was not aware of it.

                        inam, he ſprinkleth the hoary froſt; that is, hee doth it in ſuch a ſecret inſenſible, inviſible manner, that no man living can perceive it, till God have done his worke and finiſhed it, and even ſo, it pleaſeth God to worke and bring to paſſe the regeneration of a ſinfull ſoule; my Father worketh (ſaith our Saviour) and I worke, and yet both worke after ſuch a ſecret way, that untill a man be converted, the worke of Gods grace cannot be imagined nor perceived, as it was with our Saviour at his reſurrection, when he was riſen, he appeared and ſhewed himſelfe, but the manner of his riſing, or how, or which way he aroſe and got out of the Sepulchre, no man living ſaw or could conceive, as Salomon ſaith, that the way of a ſhip in the ſea is not to be knowne or found: a man may ſtand upon the ſhore, and ſee the ſhip, and the ſea, and the ſhip going on the ſea, but the way of a ſhip in the ſea is unknowne and undiſcernable: even ſo the wayes of God in tranſlating men out of the ſtate of ſin and death, into the ſtate of grace and life, are ſine veſtigijs, unſearchable and paſt finding out. Many a one is troubled that he knowes not the very inſtant of his converſion and regeneration to God, and therfore makes queſtion of his Chriſtian calling; but you know there is great difference betwixt a man that is ſuddenly converted as Paul was, like a brande ſnatcht out of the fire (as Saint Iude ſpeakes) in the very heate of their ſinnes; and ſuch as have the grace of God wrought in them by degrees (as Timothy had) ſenſim ſine ſenſu, now a little and then a little, by the ſecret ſupplies of the Spirit of grace: now it is an eaſie matter for the one to ſet downe the time and manner of their regeneration; not ſo for the other. But the effect of all is this; if a man can finde in himſelfe the markes of the Lord Ieſus (a

repentance when he hath done amiſſe) let him never make queſtion of his owne converſion, but take it as an undoubted evidence to his ſoule that God hath received him into the ſtate of mercy, wherein he will reſerve him for ever unto Ieſus Chriſt. No man makes queſtion how the froſt is gendred when he ſees it lie upon the earth, becauſe hee knowes it is the handy worke of God. And ſo is this.

Hence the grace of God is compared unto two things in Scripture, which are both things of ſprinkling, namely, Salt, and Seed. Our Saviour compares it unto ſalt, Marke 9▪

If God ſhould ſprinkle ſuch aſhes among us, or if the hoary froſt ſhould bring forth ſuch effects, what a wofull caſe were we in: How much cauſe therefore have wee (as the Prophet

ſpeakes, Hoſ. 3. 5.) to feare the Lord and his goodneſſe; in that being ſo unthankefull and ſo evill as wee are, yet God is pleaſed out of his owne goodneſſe and mercy (not becauſe we pleaſe him, but becauſe mercy pleaſeth him, Micha. 7. 18.) to doe us good and no harme all our dayes, and to ſprinkle ſuch wholeſome, healthfull froſt, as ſhall doe every man good and no man hurt. It is ſaid, Exod. 16. 14. That Manna, which was called Angels-food, not becauſe the Angels did eate it, but becauſe the Angels did prepare it, and bring it and make it ready for the peoples eating: this Manna lay upon the ground like the hoary froſt in the morning. Doubtleſſe it was to intimate, that Manna is no more to God, than aſhes are to us; and that if neede were, rather than his people ſhould famiſh, God can turne the hoary froſt into Angels food, that we might live upon the one, as the Iſraelites did upon the other forty yeares together. David was driven to a low ebbe, when hee ſaid, Pſal. 102. 9. Cinerem tanquam panem manducavi, I have eaten aſhes like bread. I take it, it was not ſo much out of neceſſity, as to teſtifie his humility that hee did eſteeme himſelfe ſo vile a ſinner, that hee was not worthy to feede upon any better food, and that duſt and aſhes were too good for him. And ſo in the dayes of old they were wont in times of ſorrow and ſadneſſe to ſprinkle duſt and aſhes upon their heads; from whence (I take it) our Aſhwedneſday hath its name▪ being dies cinerum a day wherein men humbled them before the Lord in duſt and aſhes: this they did to expreſſe the humiliation and deepe abaſement of their ſoules, that they thought themſelves not worthy to be above ground, but to be vnder earth in the grave, dead and diſſolved into duſt and aſhes. I will not here preſſe the imitation of the ceremony, but onely the obſervation of the ſubſtance of that act which concernes us as neerely, as it did them; and that is, I would have you be▪ as humble, as ſorrowfull, as dejected and as penſive for your ſinnes, as vilely and baſely, and meanely conceited of your ſelves, as they

                  Me thinkes the Ice hath ſome reſemblance of the ſtate of this world, which is dangerous two wayes. 1. For ſlipping. 2. For breaking.
                  1. For ſlipping, ſo the Fathers call the ſinnes of the godly by the name of Lapſus, ſlippings, becauſe (like men on Ice) they ſlipt and fell ere they were aware of it. And David ſaith of the men of this world, Pſa 73. that God hath ſet them in ſlippery places. Now a man that walkes in a ſlippery place, had neede walke very circumſpectly and very warily, leaſt he get a ſlip unawares that he cannot rciover himſelfe without hurt and danger: So the Apoſtle adviſeth all good Chriſtians to ſee that they walke Circumſpectly, Ephe. 5. 15. not as fooles, but as wiſe. A foole will venture to runne headlong on the Ice, as if he were upon firme ground, but a wiſe man will be very circumſpect and wary, and take heede to every ſteppe hee takes, becauſe he knowes the danger. So ſhould a Chriſtian take heede to his wayes, and if he finde himſelfe going, that he is ready to ſlip and fall from God into any ſinne, or to be carried headlong by the ſtrength of his owne corruption, or other temptation into any dangerous or wicked action; let him then call unto the Lord as David did Pſal. 119. 117. ſuſtenta me, &amp;c. ſtay thou me up, and I ſhall be ſafe; like a man ready to fall▪ he prayes God to uphold and ſtay him up. For it is certaine, a man hath not any power of himſelfe to ſtay himſelfe, but that, as Hanna tels us in her ſong. 1. Sam. 2. 9. It is God that keepeth the feet of his Saints, and ſtaies them when they are going into an evill courſe. And Moſes tels us, Deut. 33. 3. That God hath all his Saints in his hands, (as a Nurſe hath

her child) and will not ſuffer them to fall into their own miſchiefe: and therefore our care muſt be by▪ daily prayer to put our ſelves into Gods hands, and deſire God to leade us by his grace and his good Spirit, and not leave us to our ſelves, for then we ſhall ſurely ſlip and fall into evill. That child that cares not to be led, but will goe of himſelfe, gets many a knocke and many a ſhrewd fall; but the child th at is fearefull and will cry to be led, that child ſcapes many a broken face: Therefore David deſires God to leade him, Pſal. 5. 8. Whereupon ſaith Muſculus, Duci cae

                        rorum, infirmorum, &amp;c. to be led, is a thing that properly belongs to ſuch as are blinde, and to children, and impotent perſons; now if a blinde man, or a child ſhould goe upon▪ the Ice without ſome guide to leade them, what a dangerous caſe were they in; even ſuch are we without the guidance of God. The Ice is dangerous, and ſo is the world, take heede of ſlipping.
                  2. For breaking, many a one we have knowne and heard of, that have ventured confidently on the Ice upon the Thames till it hath broken under them, and they have periſhed irrecoverably; ſo have many made a great ſhew in the world, have beene in great dealings, and▪ beene confident of their fortunes, till the Ice hath broken, their credits have crackt, and they ſunke on a ſudden. See 2 Reg. 1. How ſecurely Ahaziah walked on his wonted pavement, fearing no danger, nor diſtruſting any ill event; and all on a ſudden, the floore that he walkes upon, or ſome grate that was in the floore, brakes under him, and hee got ſuch a fall that he never could recover it till his death. It is not good therfore for any man to be too confident of his own eſtate, vainely, ſaying with Iob, Chap. 29. 18. I ſhall die in my neſt▪
                      or with David, Pſa. 30. 6. I ſhall never be moved▪
                      but rather as the Apoſtle adviſeth, Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth take heede leaſt he fall. For thoſe that ſtand faſteſt upon earth have but ſlippery footing▪ it is but a kinde of Ice, take heede of breaking
                  
                     
And yet there is another kinde of Ice, which he that can breake or have it 
                        〈◊〉
                      is a happy man: and that is the Ice of ſinne, I meane the hardneſſe of heart; for looke how Ice hardens the water, ſo doth ſinne harden the heart, and make it inſenſible of any danger, and untractable to any goodneſſe. As long as the froſt holds, the Ice and the water are all one, till the thaw comes, and then it breakes into theſe buccellas, theſe morſels that my text ſpeakes of: ſo as long as a man is frozen in the dregs of ſinne, and accuſtomed to a

And this is that which the Scripture calls the breaking of the heart, it is juſt like the breaking of Ice, when the heart is diſſolved with griefe and Godly ſorrow, and his ſinnes begin to breake away by repentance and reformation of life▪ then doth the Spirit of God (which Zachary calls the Spirit of Grace and ſupplication) doe as in the firſt creation I

And hee bloweth with his winde, (in the originall it is) flabir ſpiritus, his ſpirit ſhall blow; for the ſpirit of God, and winde and breath of God are all one▪ Now marke from the connexion of theſe two, How the word of God, and the ſpirit of God goe evermore together [Hee ſendeth out his word▪
                      and bloweth with his ſpirit▪] Iuſt as in the body of a man, the veynes and the Arteryes goe ever together, the veynes

                     ary the blood and the Arteryes carry the ſpirits, for every veyne in the body there is an Artery goes along with it. So whereſoever there is a veyne of truth, I meane, where the word of God is faithfully preached, there is vehiculum ſpiritus, an Artery for the ſpirit of God to accompany and goe along with it to mollifie and intenerate that ſame nervum ferreum (which the Prophet ſpeakes of) that Ironſin
                           •
                        w of unbeliefe, and to make the word effectuall for the melting and thawing of the frozon hearts of ſinners. Now if you looke backe upon this kindly Thaw that God hath ſent us, after ſo long and lamentable a time of Snow and Ice and cold, you ſhall ſee in it a lively reſemblance of the inward and ſpirituall thaw and melting of a hardned heart, that hath beene frozen a long time in the dregges of ſinne, and beene utterly uncapable of any grade▪ untill ſuch

time as God doth ſend out his Word and melteth him, and bloweth upon his ſoule with that ſame truely ſo called ventus favonius, that favourable winde of his holy Spirit that makes the waters of repenting teares fall downe from his eyes. I will but name the particulars and ſo conclude.
                  1. The Thaw is alwayes accompanied with a change of weather; the skie which before was faire and cleare and bright, doth then grow cloudy and ſad and darke with foggie miſts and vapours, that a man hath no pleaſure to be abroad in it. And thus it is with a repenting ſoule, when God ſends this Spirituall thaw, a man ſhall finde a change of weather in his heart, his joy will be changed into ſorrow, his mirth into melancholy, his ſongs and merry tunes, into ſighes and ſobbes, and hee ſhall ſenſibly perceive the foggy vapours of his ſinnes ariſe out of his heart into his head, and come trickling downe in teares at his eyes. It is ſaid in the Pſalmes, that therefore the wicked feare not God, becauſe they have no changes, but ſtill continue in one eſtate of proſperity and pride, and ſo think to paſſe a deliciys ad delicias, from the joyes of earth to the joyes of heaven; but that will not be, if ever God intend to ſave their ſoules, he will finde a time to ſend a thaw into their hearts, and then let them tell me, if they doe not finde a change of weather in their conſciences.
                  2. If it chance to thaw and then freeze againe the next day, this makes the wayes and paſſages worſe than they were before. So when a mans heart ſhall melt a little on the Sonday, and freeze againe all the weeke after; as Pharaohs melted for a time, and then preſently hardned again; this relapſe is worſe than the former: as water having beene once heate, and then cooled againe, growes colder after than before. Wee ſee, that even marble in ſome weather will ſtand on drops, and yet retaines its wonted hardneſſe: ſo did Pharaohs heart, and Sauls, and Ahabs, ſeeme to give, and melt for a time, but they grew hard againe too ſoone. Take heede of that, if thy heart begin to thaw, deſire

God to follow thee with his grace, that it may not freeze againe.
                  3. After a thaw, though the Snow for the moſt part be vaniſhed and gone, yet under hedges and ditches, there wil lie ſome leavings of it (as we call them) a long time after; ſo when it hath pleaſed God to melt a mans heart for ſinne, yet there wilbe ſome leavings▪ of corruption, ſome remainders of his old ſinnes, in the blinde and ſecret corners of his heart. So that the continuall care and daily practiſe of a Chriſtian muſt be to finde out and purge out theſe old leavings of ſinne that lie unmelted in his ſoule. 1 Cor. 5. 7.
                  4. The thaw makes the wayes exceeding foule and cloggie which before were faire and cleane; ſo till a mans heart be thawed, he never perceives the fouleneſſe of the wayes of ſinne, how they bemyre his ſoule, and clogge and hinder him in his paſſage to heaven; Saint Peter calls the world 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a ſqualid foule and filthy place (ſo the word ſignifies, 2 Pet. 1. 19.) a man ſhall have much adoe to keepe himſelfe unſpotted where ſo much filth and corruption is. David found this, and deſired of God, Pſal. 69 15. Eripe me de

                        uto; Lord deliver me out of the myre that I ſinke not. A wicked man thinkes the broad way to be the beſt way, but a man whoſe heart hath beene thawed, knowes it to be full of myre and ſloughes, and it is Gods mercy if they doe not ſinke irrecoverably.
                  5. While the froſt holds the plowes are lockt out of the earth, no ſeede can be ſowne, all husbandry is intermitted, till God ſend a thaw, and then their work goes forward. So while men are frozen in ſinne, Gods Plow can make no worke, the ſeed of his word can take no roote, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (as the Apoſtle calls the Miniſtrie of the word. 1 Cor. 3.) God husbandry doth no good till there come an inward thaw to prepare and make way for grace, that mens hearts may be wrought upon by the powerfull Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt, then it is no griefe for a Miniſter to take paines in

the Word and Doctrine of the Lord. Therefore Iohn Baptiſt was ſent before to prepare the way for Chriſt, and to thaw mens hearts by the preaching of repentance, that they might be capable of the Doctrine of Chriſt, who was to ſow the ſeede of eternall life in the world.
                  6. Laſtly, after a thaw comes a floud, ſo after repentance follow teares. It was Peters caſe, Luke 22. 60.

                     Mephiboſheth. 2 Sam. 9. 3. Is there not any of the houſe of Saul, that I may ſhew the kindneſſe of God unto him? (ſaith the King to Ziba,) that is, that I may ſuſtaine, releive, and doe him good, as God in his kindeneſſe is wont to ſuſtaine, releive and do good to thoſe that ſtand in neede of ſuccour: this is the kindeneſſe of God, and that is a knowne kindneſſe. But then there is another ſort of kindeneſſe that is unknowne, ſuch as the world doth hardly know how to diſcerne from an unkindneſſe, and that conſiſts in ſmiting, rebuking and reprehenſion, and this is the kindeneſſe that David doth even begge for here in my Text. Let the Righteous ſmite, it ſhall be a kindeneſſe, &amp;c.
                  In which words there are three generall parts, to be obſerved, which may be reduced to three heads, and be thus expreſt.
                  1. Deſiderium ſanae conſcientiae, the deſire of a ſound and a good conſcience; that which is moſt diſtaſtefull to a bad conſcience, is moſt deſirable to a good one, viz. To be ſmitten and to be reproved, (percutiat, et increpet, Let him ſmite me, let him reprove me.)
                  2. Electio ſidelis amici, the choyſe of a faithfull friend, of a fitting perſon to doe this office; A man wold be loath that every Iack, or every baſe fellow ſhould curbe, and ſnib, and ſmite him for his errours; but a Righteous man, or (if you pleaſe to take the word ſo) a right wiſe-man, one that is able to give a man counſell, and honeſt to keepe a mans counſell, let ſuch a one ſmite in Gods name, let him reprove and ſpare not, (percutiat me Iuſtus et
                     
                     increpet; Let the Righteous ſmite me, and let him reproove me: though it be (as the originall hath it) Malleo percutiat, Let him ſmite me, (as it were) with a Mallet; now Malleus incutit et excutit, a Mallet ſerves both to drive in, and to drive out; ſo his meaning is; if it be good counſell, let him drive it in; if it be a bad cuſtome, let him drive it out; let him not forbeare me in either, but ſmite home in both.
                  3. Acceptatio fraternae correptionis, the acceptation or well-taking of brotherly reprehenſion; David did profeſſe in the behalfe of all penitent and humble ſinners, that he would be ſo farre from taking it as a diſcourteſy, or eſteeming it as a diſreputation to be told of his faults, by ſuch a man, after ſuch a manner; that (ſaith he) it ſhall be Miſericordia, it ſhall be a kindneſſe unto me, yea a mercy, yea more then that, it ſhall be Oleum Capitis, (as it is in the Hebrew) a principall, a ſoveraigne, an excellent oyle that ſhall not breake my head; of theſe in their order, firſt of the firſt part, which is,
                  1. Deſiderium ſanae conſcientiae, the deſire of a good conſcience, that is, to be ſmitten, &amp; to be reproved. A ſound heart is like a ſound hand, that can abide not only rubbing &amp; chafing, but ſmiting and ſtriking too, if occaſion ſerve, and yet neyther ſuffer, nor offer any harme; whereas if a man have a thorne in his hand, or a bille, or an vlcerous ſore, the leaſt touch at unawares provokes him to impatience, and makes him fret at him that meant him no unkindneſſe. So fares it with a man that hath a thorne in his heart, or an vlcer in his Soule, I meane, ſome ſecret ſinne

or other that he loveth and is loath to part with; though he be not ſmitten upon purpoſe, if he be but touched upon the by; as David ſaith in another caſe, Tange montes et fumig abunt; Touch the Mountaines and they ſhall ſmoke; ſo the leaſt touch upon his predominant, his Mountaine-ſinne, makes him fret, and fume, and ſmoke, like the vapours in the clouds, that never leave working when once they are enraged till they have vented themſelves into a clap of thunder: malice will finde a vent if it be but ſtirred with a touch. When thou with rebukes doſt chaſten man for ſinne, He is as a moth, fretting a garment, (ſaith our tranſlation, Pſal. 39. 11.) He that undertakes a carnall man, with rebukes to chaſten him for ſinne, ſhall finde him play the Moth preſently, he will be fretting ſecretly, though hee make no ſhew of it openly; as wee ſay of a Moth, Tinea damnum facit, non ſonitum. A moth doth miſchiefe, and makes no noyſe; I ſay, Rebuke him, and you ſhall finde him a very moth; if he cannot finde a hole in that mans coate that ſhall offer to reproove him, tis a venture but he will fret one, that is, he will either raiſe ſome imputation of ſcandall upon him, or bring ſome action at law againſt him, one way or other, he wil be revenged upon him for it. Its death to an ill-minded man to be ſmitten for his faults. But then come to a man of an honeſt heart and an humble minde, one that is truely conſcious to his owne defects, and ſuch a one will be ſo farre from taking it in ill part, or in indignation to bee touched for his tranſgreſſions; that he will rather entreate any good man, or any good Miniſter, as

the man of God entreated his neighbour. 1 Reg. 20. 35. Smite me I pray thee, in the name of the Lord: If thou knoweſt any thing that is amiſſe in mee, or ſeeſt mee doe any thing that may be diſpleaſing to God, or prejudiciall to my calling, to my credit, or to my conſcience to God-ward; doe not favour me, doe not forbeare me, but deale truely and effectually with me, and ſmite mee I pray thee, in the name of the Lord. And ſuch was Davids diſpoſition in my Text, though he were a prince, and a man after Gods owne heart, yet was he ſo farre from delighting to heare himſelfe flattered for his vertues, that he did rather even deſire and long to feele himſelfe ſmitten for his vices: percutiat et increpet, let him ſmite me, and reprove me.
                  
                  A man would thinke that David had ſmiting enough, if that were good, he ſhould deſire no more. Almighty God had ſmitten him (as he ſaith himſelfe) with ſuch a ſore diſeaſe, that there was no reſt in his bones, noe breath in his body by reaſon of his ſinne. Beſides that his enemies had ſmitten him on every ſide, They came about me like Bees (ſaith he) animaſque in vulnere ponunt, they ſmote him and ſtung him, though it were to their own undoing, though they left their very lives and ſoules in their ſtings. Beyond all theſe, Davids owne heart had ſmitten him more then once; when hee numbred the people, His heart ſmote him (ſaith the Text. 2 Sam. 24. 10.) To teach us how our hearts ſhould ſmite us, when we conſider the number of our ſins. So when be had but cut Sauls coat, his heart ſmote him againe, as much perhaps as it would have done

ſome other if he had cut Sauls throat: I ſay, if ſmiting be good, ſurely David had enough of it; and yet you ſee there was an unicum deeſt, one thing wanting to all thoſe ſmitings; He that knew the ſtate and temper of his owne ſoule, did ſenſibly finde in himſelfe that if he were but ſmitten againe in another kind, if the Righteous would but ſmite him too, it might be a meanes to doe him as much, yea, much more good, than all the reſt had done. But ſtay; and let us reaſon the caſe: why ſhould David deſire to be ſmitten once more, having been ſo much, and ſo often ſmitten before? I will tell you what I thinke his reaſon might be.
                  1 Vt videat, that he might ſee his errors. We have a ſaying, that ſtanders by ſee more than Gameſters: ſo another man may ſee more by his friend, than perhaps hee ſees or perceives by himſelfe. Hence I take it, the Prophet Gad is called Davids Seer, 2 Sam. 24. 11. Wee know that David was a Prophet himſelfe, and had Revelations and Viſions from God as well as Gad; and yet even hee had a Seer deputed for him; and doubtleſſe Gad had a ſpeciall inſpection into Davids wayes and actions, and ſaw more by him, many a time than he ſaw by himſelfe, and brought backe many of his ſinnes to his ſight and remembrance which had formerly eſcaped him unſeene, and unrepented: for this cauſe, I ſuppoſe, doth the holy Ghoſt entitle him Davids Seer. So Num. 10. 31. when the Iſraelites were travelling in the Wilderneſſe towards the land of Promiſe, though they had the Cloud to direct them by day, and the Pillar of Fire

to direct them by night, yet they deſired Iethro to be in ſtead of eyes unto them (as the text expreſſeth it): Why? What need had they of Iethro to be eyes unto them, ſeeing they had the infallible guidance and direction of the Cloud and Fire of God? Yes, for though theſe were guides unto them in generall, yet for particular places and paſſages in the deſart, Iethroes direction was inſtead of eyes unto them, becauſe he knew the dangers of the wilderneſſe which they knew not. So though a man for the generall courſe of his life and converſation may have the heavenly guidance of Gods holy Spirit, and the bleſſed Guardianſhip of Gods holy Angels; yet in particular caſes and circumſtances of a mans demeanour and carriage, a Iethro, a loving friend, that will deale truely and plainely with a man, may be in ſtead of eyes unto a man, to informe him of what is a right, and reforme him in what is amiſſe; to ſhew him much good, and ſave him from much evill that might befall him. They ſay, that a Mole is blinde all her life, and never ſeeth till the very point of death, for then the extremity of the paine breakes open the filme of her eyes, and then ſhe ſeeth, but then her ſight doth her no good. Whether it be ſo or no, I dare not affirme; But ſo I have heard, and ſo I have read: and ſurely (me thinks) it is a lively reſemblance of the wretched eſtate of ſome kinde of men, that goe blindlings on in an evill courſe of life, like the blinded Aramites, 2 Reg. 6. that thought they had beene in the way to Dothan when they were in the midſt of Samaria; ſo theſe thinke themſelves in the

way to heaven, when they are in the midſt of Sathans kingdome and dominion; till they come to die, then the extremity of their paines may peradventure breake open the filme of their hearts, to ſee their owne miſerable eſtate through ſinne before God, but who can tell whether their ſight doth then doe them any good, and not rather torment them the more. Happie therefore is that man that can meet with ſuch a friend as Iob and Iethro was, that will be inſtead of an Oculiſt unto him; to open his eyes by ſober admonitions and ſeaſonable reprehenſions, that hee may ſee his ſinnes in time, and ſave himſelfe from this ſame 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (as Saint Peter termes it, Acts 2. 40.) this perverſe, untoward generation. We read, 1 Sam. 14. 27. that when Ionathan had taſted the hony with the top of his rod, the text ſaith, his eyes were opened, and he ſaw that he had done amiſſe. This in my conceit, is a lively reſemblance of loving reprehenſion; the Rod (you will ſay) is an embleme of correction, and caſtigation; and the hony may well paſſe for an embleme of a ſweet and loving diſpoſition; put both theſe together, the Rod and the Hony, Reprehenſion and love, or ſweet and loving reprehenſion; if any thing in the world open a mans eies, and make him ſee hee hath done amiſſe, that will doe it. And this may be one reaſon why David deſired to be ſmitten, to be reproved, ut videat, that he might ſee his ſinnes.
                  2 Vt doleat, that he might grieve for his ſinnes. It is with many a man, as it was with Iob, who loſt his cattle, loſt his children, loſt all the goods hee

had, yet all theſe loſſes never troubled him, till there came a nuntio, a meſſenger that told him of it; then Iob rent his cloathes, and humbled himſelfe in duſt and aſhes: thus doth many a man run on in a careleſſe courſe of ſinne, till hee hath loſt himſelfe, loſt his ſoule, loſt the favour of his God, and the hope of heaven by Chriſt; yet all theſe loſſes never trouble him, untill ſome nuntio come, ſome good Miniſter, or neighbour, or meſſenger from God, and tell him how the caſe ſtands betwixt God and his ſoule; then he grieves, then he grones, then or never will hee humble himſelfe before the Lord; as Saint Paul told the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 7. 8, 9. Though I made you ſorry with a letter, I doe not repent me, becauſe your ſorrow brought you to repentance. So hee is a happy man that can make his friend ſorry for his ſinnes, either by letter (as Paul did here, and Eliah elſewhere, 2 Chron. 21. 12. who would not goe to Iehoram to reprove him to his face, but left a letter, or a writing to be ſent unto him, which was brought him afterward, when Eliah was either abſent or dead, and a bitter one it was, as there you may read;) I ſay, either by letter, or by word of mouth, any way he that can make his friend ſorry for his ſinnes, doth him an happy kindneſſe; becauſe this ſorrow may bring him to repentance, repentance brings him home to God, and in God every man hath his quietus eſt, a happy diſcharge from all his ſinnes. And this may be another reaſon why David deſired to be ſmitten yet more, ut doleat, that hee might grieve for his ſinne.
                  
                     
3 Vt deſiſtat, that he might leave his ſinnes, we read, Num. 22. 34. that when Balaam for the wages of unrighteouſneſſe was riding on to curſe the people of God, and that God had opened his eyes to ſee the revenging Angel that withſtood him in the way, and ſaw that the Angel did not ſmite him with his ſword, as he might have done, but onely ſmote him with his word, and reprehended him; the text ſheweth how modeſtly, how meekely he ſubmitted himſelfe, and ſaid, Now Lord (ſaith he) if my way diſpleaſe thee, I will get me backe againe, and goe no further. In like manner when thy conſcience ſhall tell thee, and Gods Angel, I meane, Gods Miniſter ſhall make it appeare unto thee, that thy way diſpleaſeth God, that thou haſt led thy life in ſuch a way as God doth not accept; be not thou more obſtinate, more head-ſtrong than Balaam, who is generally holden to be a Sorcerer and a Witch; but if thou haſt eſcaped vengeance, and art but fairely ſmitten with a rebuke; reſolve with thy ſelfe, and ſay as Balaam did, Lord, I perceive my way is diſpleaſing in thy ſight, I will therefore returne, I will repent, I will deſiſt, and ſin no more. Thus did Saint Paul, as you may read, Acts 9. when hee had gotten authority from the higher powers to binde, and carry captive all that called upon the name of Ieſus Chriſt, he went on (ſaith the text) 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      like a tired Wolfe breathing out threatnings and ſlaughters againſt the people of God, &amp; ſi non aliquâ nocuiſſet, mortuus eſſet, if he had not done ſome miſchiefe, hee had beene breathleſſe, he had beene a dead man: well

our bleſſed Saviour meets him in the way, ſmites him downe from his horſe, and gives him a ſweet and yet a ſearching rebuke, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me, &amp;c. after this that he had beene thus ſmitten, you never read that ever he ſhewed his letters, that ever he drew forth his commiſſion, or went about to put his purpoſe into practiſe; but immediatly deſiſted, and turned a new leafe, and became more zealous for the Goſpel, than ever he was againſt it. Thus God told Abimelech, Gen. 20. 6. Cohibui te, I reſtrained thee, I with-held thee, or kept thee backe from ſinning againſt me. How did God withhold him, or by what meanes? See the laſt verſe of that Chapter; he ſmote him with a judgement, and that deterred him from it: if there be any meanes under heaven to reſtraine a man from ſin, or (as S. Iames his word is, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Iam. 3. 2.) to bridle, and curbe a man in, from ſinning againſt God, and againſt his owne ſoule; it is this preventing ſtroke of the hand of God; as Ahaziah told the man or God, 2 Chron. 25. Forbeare, why ſholdſt thou be ſmitten; It is a happy thing when a man wil be won by faire means, to forbare before he be ſmitten; but he that will not be won by foule meanes, to forbeare when he is ſmitten; if ſmiting will not make a man to forbeare ſinning, it is a ſhrewd ſigne that man is Conclamatae ſpei, little hope of his amendment. And for this cauſe I ſuppoſe that David (in the laſt place) might deſire to be ſmitten yet againe, ut deſiſtat▪
                      that hee might forbeare, that he might leave his ſinne, and ſo much ſhall ſerve to be ſpoken of the firſt generall part of

my text, which I termed deſiderium ſanae conſcientiae, the deſire of a ſound and a good conſcience, that is, to be ſmitten and reproved▪ The next is,
                  2 Electio fidelis amici, the choife of a faithfull friend, of a fitting perſon to doe this office of kindneſſe for a man that deſerves and deſires it, percutiat me juſtus, Let the Righteous ſmite me. You may by juſtus underſtand Chriſtus (as ſome doe) or you may by juſtus underſtand ſanctus (as others) but my conceit leades me to take it in the plaineſt and directeſt ſence; ſo that by a righteous man, I conceive to be meant, a Right wiſe man, a ſober, underſtanding man, a man of good temper, good goverment, and good diſcretion; if any man undertake to ſmite me (ſaith David) let it be ſuch a man or none; for why? if a Righteous or a Right-wiſe man ſmite me and reprove me, he will doe it,
                  1 Sine felle, without gall, without bitternes. For as there is a fault in too much lenity, too much forbearance, and indulgence where there is juſt cauſe of ſharper reprehenſion, which was Elies fault in the caſe of his ſons, 1 Sam. 3. 13. the text ſaith, His ſons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not, (So our Tranſlation renders it) but the Originall is more expreſſive, for there it is, Maledictionem inferebant ſibi, they brought a curſe upon themſelves by their wicked lives, &amp; non corrugavit frontem in eos; he did not ſo much as frowne or bend his browes upon them. Whereupon ſaith S. Bernard; quiaira Eli tepuit in filios, ira dei exarſit in illum, becauſe the anger of Eli waxed cold againſt his ſons, the anger of God waxed hot againſt him, I

ſay, as there is a fault in too much lenity and indulgence, ſo there is as great a fault in too much virulency and bitterneſſe. David complaineth, whether of his friends or of his enemies, that they gave him Gall to drinke: this we know was prophetically ſpoken, and litterally fulfilled in our bleſſed Saviour at his paſſion; but ſurely David ſpake it of himſelfe in a metaphoricall ſence, meaning, that their words and rebukes were as bitter, as vile, and as diſtaſtfull to him, as if they had put gall into his very drinke. Now obſerve it when you will, you ſhall find, that theſe harſh, theſe galling reprehenſions doe never worke kindely a good diſpoſition, as S. Iames ſaith, Iam. 1. 18. The wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſſe of God, that is, a furious or a railing reprehenſion doth not perſwade or move a man, ſo as that thereby he is won to God or to goodneſſe: for one will take that which commeth from a haſty man, to proceede rather out of ſpightfulneſſe and ſpleene, then of love or good-meaning, and ſo it falls to the ground without working that good effect, which wholeſome reprehenſion ſhould worke, that is, it doth not frame nor worke a mans heart to the righteouſneſſe of God. Now an undiſcreet man in his paſſion, is tanquam leo in vi ſuâ (as the Prophet ſpeaks) like a Lion in his rage, and hath not the wiſedome nor grace to moderate and containe himſelfe from words that are as bitter as gall, yea, as ſharpe as ſwords and arrowes, like ſwords that wound a man if he be neere hand, and like arrowes that follow him, and wound him thorow if he be a farre off▪
                     
they never ſmite a man, but they wound him in his reputation. But then let a righteous man, or a rightwiſe man undertake to ſmite or to reprove, and he will doe it, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Gal. 6. 1. in the ſpirit of meekeneſſe, and will endeavour (as the text ſaith) 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , not ſo much to reprehend, as to reſtore ſuch a man to a better eſtate than he found him in; it is a metaphor taken from Chirurgions and Bone-ſetters, that when they undertake a diſlocated joynt to reſtore it and ſet it right, they doe it with as much tenderneſſe as poſſibly they can, and with as little paine as needs muſt to the patient; or as he that taketh a mote out of ones eye, taketh it out exceeding warily and tenderly, leaſt he put out the eye alſo: ſo tenderly, ſo feelingly will a man of diſcretion goe to worke in the manner of his reprehenſion, as if the caſe were his owne, as if himſelfe were in the ſame condition. Therefore if any man ſmite me (ſaith David) let him be a righteous, a right-wiſe man, for ſuch a one will doe it, ſine felle without gall, without bitterneſſe.
                  2 Sine publicatione, without publiſhing, divulging, and telling it to the world. It was our Saviours rule, Matt. 18. 15. If thy brother offend, corripe inter te &amp; ſe, goe and rebuke him betwixt thee and him alone, make no words of it to a multitude: ubi malum contingit ibi moriatur, where an evill ariſeth, let it receive private admonition, and there let it die. Wee read in the Goſpel, Mar. 7. 33. that when our Saviour went about to cure the man that was deafe and dumb, the text ſaith, He tooke him
                     
                     aſide from the multitude, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , hee tooke him in hand privately and peculiarly to himſelfe; in like manner, wouldſt thou doe a ſpiriturall cure upon a man that is deafe, and wil not heare good counſell, dumb, and will not open his mouth in prayer to God; Take him aſide; Doe as a diſcreete Chirurgion with a modeſt Patient, whoſe ſecret complaint hath more ſhame than paine; I ſay, take him aſide; for to undertake him before the face of a multitude, is rather to wound him, than to heale him. Brotherly reprehenſion muſt be auricular, no eare muſt heare it but the owne parties. According to our Saviours after-charge, when hee had done many of his cures, See thou tell no man of it; tell it the party in Gods name, and ſpare not, but tell it no man elſe. As David cried out when hee heard of Sauls and Ionathans untimely and unfortunate end, 2 Sam. 1. 20. Tell it not in Gath, publiſh it not in the ſtreets of Askelon, leaſt the daughters of the Philiſtims rejoyce, leaſt the daughters of the uncircumciſed triumph. I can but wonder (by the way) why David ſhould mention only the daughters of the Philiſtims, and the daughters of the uncircumciſed; why doth he not ſay as well, Tell it not, leaſt the ſonnes of the Philiſtims rejoyce, and the ſonnes of the uncircumciſed triumph? ſurely, it ſhould ſeeme that Daughters, (I meane) Women-kinde are far more prone to flout and mocke, to jeare and frump, to rejoyce and triumph, to tattle and tell tals of the weakeneſſes and frailties, the caſualties and miſcariages of men, farre more then men that are of underſtanding, that know what humane

frailty is: therefore (ſaith David) whereſoever you tell it, tell it not in Gath, in what ſtreets or townes ſoever you publiſh it, publiſh not it in the ſtreets of Askelon, amongſt the women-kinde, amongſt the daughters of uncircumciſed Philiſtims, for they will be ſo farre from grieving and relenting, that they will even triumph and rejoyce at it. Herein then is the diſcretion of a right-wiſe man ſeene, that though he tell the party delinquent of his faults, he will tell no man elſe of it, he will not blaze it to the world; ſuch a one will give his admonitions, as hee gives his almes, In ſecret, that none ſhall heare it, none know of it, but him onely whom it concernes. Therefore (ſaith David) if I be ſmitten and reproved, let it be by a righteous, by a right-wiſe man, for he will doe it ſine publicatione, hee will make no noiſe, make no words of it.
                  3 Sine contumeliâ, without diſgrace; a right-wiſe man, though he tell his friend of his follies to reforme him, he will not tell it in that manner as to diſgrace him. In the ceremoniall Law, God commanded that the very Snuffers for Lampes in the Tabernacle ſhould be of pure gold, I ſuppoſe, to intimate that they who are cenſurers and correctors of others, ſhould be holy and blameleſſe themſelves; now he that ſhall top a candle, &amp; then throw the ſnuffe about the roome, doth offend more, and doe more hurt with the ſtench, than hee did good with his diligence; in like manner, he that ſhall firſt rebuke his brother, and then diſgrace him, doth him more hurt with the one, than he did him good

with the other. The Apoſtle telleth us, that love covereth a multitude of ſinnes; not onely Charitas Dei, the love and kindneſſe of God, and Charitas Chriſti the love and compaſſion of Chriſt; but Charitas amici too, the kindneſſe and love of a friend, if he be true and faithfull, will be the ſame that Shems and Iaphets cloake was, a meanes under God to cover and to hide the weakeneſſes and deformities of his fathers and brethren: See an example of it in our bleſſed Saviour, Luke 7. 37. when he had occaſion to ſpeake of the penitent woman that waſhed his feet with her teares, and wiped them with the haire of her head, ſee how favourably, how tenderly he makes mention of her, and the worſt language hee gives her is, that ſhee was peccatrix a ſinner, There was a woman in the City which was a ſinner; Alas, what woman was not, what woman is not a ſinner? We doe eaſily gueſſe what the woman was, and what her ſinne was; but ſee the tenderneſſe and the goodneſſe of our Lord and Saviour, that names neither the woman, nor the ſinne, but ſpares her reputation, becauſe he ſaw her repentance. Thus did the Father of the Prodigall child, Luke 15. ult. when he was driven by neceſſity to ſeeke reliefe in his Fathers houſe, and came and ſubmitted himſelfe; ſee how his elder brother reviled him, how baſely, how contemptuouſly, how diſgracefully he makes mention of him, ver. 30. This thy ſonne (ſaith hee) that hath ſpent thy living upon harlots, ſhall have more kindneſſe from thee, than I that never angred thee. He doth not ſay, This my brother, but, This thy ſonne,
                     
as if he had beene nothing a kinne to him, ſeeing he was growne into poverty, and driven by neceſſity to make bold with his friends. Such is the dogged diſpoſition of ill-minded men, if they know any thing by a man that may any way diſgrace him, he ſhall be ſure to have it laid in his diſh when he fares the worſt. But then ſee the good nature of his good Father, how he ſeekes to cover and to hide the deformity of his ſons offence under favorable &amp; gentle termes, This my ſon was dead (ſaith he) and now is alive, was loſt and now is found; and ſo buries all in oblivion, and makes no reproachfull mention of them. Thus favourably doth the Scripture ſpeak of Davids great offence. Davids heart was upright in all things (ſaith the text) ſave only in the matter of Vriah, 1 Reg. 15. 5. it is not ſaid, ſave onely in the murther of Vriah, but ſave onely in the matter of Vriah; what that matter was is too well knowne, but the holy Ghoſt ſeekes to cover it, that there may be no diſgracive mention of it. It is meate and drinke to ſome kind of people, if they can but find any juſt accuſation againſt a man, to diſgrace him by it: Saint Auſtin compares ſuch to Dives dogges that lay licking and ſucking of Lazarus ſores; they medled not with his ſound parts, but onely with his ſores; ſo let a man have never ſo many good parts, they make no mention of them, but if hee have but one ſore, (i) an infirmity, you ſhall have them licking at that continually; never chance to ſpeake of him, but that is at their tongues end. Well therefore did David abandon all unrighteous men from having to doe with him; and make

choiſe of one that is right-wiſe, and honeſt to ſmite and to reprove him, for ſuch a one will doe it ſine contumeliâ, without diſgrace.
                  4 Sine adulatione, without flattery; without abetting or juſtifying a man in his evill courſes. For there is, (as one hath well obſerved) a twofold Iuſtification; 1 A Iuſtification of a ſinner from his ſinnes. 2 A Iuſtification of a ſinner in his ſinnes; the firſt is an act of Gods mercy, the ſecond is an act of mans flattery: the former is an happy an bleſſed thing, when God is pleaſed in mercy to juſtifie and acquit, to diſcharge and free a guilty ſoule from the bond and puniſhment of all his ſinnes, by the merits, and by the bloud, and by the Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt. The latter is a wofull and accurſed thing, when a man ſhall ſpeake good of evill, and labour to juſtifie another mans actions though never ſo vile and foule; it is ſuch a Iuſtification as without Gods infinite mercy will bring a man to everlaſting condemnation; and yet ſuch ſervile ſpirits there be, that for their owne advantage, will ſooth a man up (if hee be rich or great) in all his wayes, and wickedneſſe: Let him ſinne what he will, they will not checke him; project what he will, they will not thwart him; ſay what he will, they are ready to ſecond him; and let him be what he will, they applaud and admire him. Oh, what amiable friends are theſe! theſe love a man, as the Ravens love his eyes, or as Dalilah loved Sampſon, when ſhe hugged and lulled him in her lap, and then cut off his locke, which was the onely ligament that tied and faſtned him to his God, ſo ſhe did what lay

in her even to cut him off from God. Theſe are they whom the Prophet termes Caementarios diaboli, the devils dawbers, Ezech. 13. 10. the compariſon ſtands thus; when a man dwels in an old ruinous houſe, the Maſon comes and plaſters and dawbes it over, making the Indweller beleeve that all is well, that it is a ſound and a ſolid wall, and he may dwell ſafely in it, when the houſe is indeed ready to fal, drop down, and ſmother him. Such are they, that will not ſticke to perſwade a man that his caſe is good to God-ward, that he hath no cauſe to be diſcontented or ill-conceited of himſelfe, when there is an ulciſci in promptu (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) when vengeance is in a readineſſe to fall downe and ſeize upon him. Another calls them the devils Vphoſters (in relation to that Ezech. 13 18.) if they ſee a man leane towards a ſinne, they will ſow a pillow under his arme-hole, (i) ſooth him up in his inclination, that he ſleepe ſecurely in it with as little trouble and unreſt as poſſibly may be. Theſe be wofull friends, God deliver every good man from having ſuch burs hang on his ſleeve, from having his head broken with theſe precious balmes (as our Tranſlation reads my text.) For my part (ſaith David) give me a true friend that will ſmite me, as for a flatterer that will ſmooth me, I hate and abhor him; give me ſuch a friend as is like thoſe ſawces which a man commends with teares in his eyes; whoſe reprehenſion is like ſome wholſome potion, though it make a man ſick for the preſent, it wil purge him &amp; do him good for the time to come; it be theſe rough hands (as one ſaid of Iacobs)
                     
that bring us ſavory meate, and carry away the bleſſing when they have done: As David bleſſed Abigail, when ſhe met him and ſtaied him from his evill purpoſe, 1 Sam. 25. 32. Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael that hath ſent thee to meete mee this day, and bleſſed be thy advice, and bleſſed be thou which haſt kept me this day from ſhedding of bloud▪
                      A flatterer may pleaſe a man at the firſt, but a plaine-dealing friend hath his bleſſing at the laſt; and ſuch a one did David deſire to be ſmitten by, becauſe he knew that he would doe it, ſine adulatione without flatery.
                  Laſtly, if a righteous man ſmite, though he doe it (as I have ſhewed) 1 Sine felle without gall. 2 Sine publicatione, without notice. 3 Sine contumeliae without diſgrace. 4 Sine adulatione without flattery, yet which is the maine of all. 5 Non ſine Deo, not without God. If David could ſay of his enemy that curſed him, Let him alone, for God hath bidden to curſe; much more ſafely maiſt thou ſay of thy friend that reproves thee, let him alone for God hath bidden him to ſmite. And as the Apoſtle ſaith of Miniſters, that God doth entreat you by us; ſo perſwade your ſelves, that God doth reprove you by them: Doe not therefore reſiſt, do not reject good counſell, leaſt thou be found to be 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , an oppoſer, a fighter againſt God. For beleeve it, if thou doſt not hearken to God when hee reproves thee by thy friend, thou ſhalt one day heare him to thy coſt, when God will reprove thee by himſelfe. Give eare and tremble at that ſame tuba terroris (as Saint Auſtin calls it) that trumpet of terrour, or

that terrible trumpet, Pſal. 50. 21. Theſe things haſt thou done, and I held my peace, whereupon thou thoughteſt wickedly that I was ſuch a one as thy ſelfe (that is, one that ſeeth evill done, and by ſilence gives conſent, and takes pleaſure in them that doe it) But I will reprove thee (ſaith God) and ſet thine ſinnes in order before thine eyes. Tremble (I ſay) at the voice of this Trumpet; Thou that wilt neither reprove thy ſelfe when thou haſt done evill, nor ſuffer others by reproofe to doe thee good; aſſure thy ſelfe, there is one above that will reprove thee when hee comes to judge thee, who will ſo marſhall, and ranke, and ſet thy ſinnes in order before thee, that thou ſhalt not be able to anſwer him to one of a thouſand. Therefore as Saint Auſtin deſired of God in another caſe, Domine hic ure, hic ſeca, ut in poſterum ſanes, Lord cut me and ſcorch me here, that thou maiſt heale me, and cure me hereafter; ſo let thy prayer to God be to the ſame effect, Lord ſmite me and reprove me here, that I may have nothing to anſwer for, nothing to be queſtioned for, when I goe from hence. So much briefly for the ſecond generall part of my Text, why David did make choiſe of a Righteous man to ſmite him. The next is,
                  3 Acceptatio fraternae correptionis, the well-taking of brotherly reprehenſion; the text ſaith, It ſhall be a kindneſſe. But what will the world ſay, if ſmiting be a kindneſſe, a man ſhall be ſure to have enough of it, if he will take that ſo kindly, he ſhall not want for kindneſſe, as this world goes: Such kindneſſe as this Ananias could afford Saint Paul,
                     
                     Acts 23. 2. Smite him on the mouth (ſaith he) when he was ſpeaking how he had lived in all good conſcience before God until that day. This kindnes the Officers could afford our Saviour, Iohn 18. when he had thus ſpoken, one of the Officers which ſtood by ſmote Ieſus on the face, with the palme of his hand. This kindneſſe Zedech
                           •
                        ah could afford Michaiah, 1 Reg. 22 He went neere and ſmote him on the checke. Doubtleſſe if one in anger had ſmitten Ahabs or the High-prieſts dogge in that place, and in that preſence, he ſhould have ſmarted for it, but this they thought was kindneſſe good enough for them that durſt doe no other but take it. So that as Abſalom ſaid to Huſhai, when to his thinking he had ſhewed him a plot how to undermine his father David, 2 Sam. 16. 17. Is this thy kindneſſe to thy friend (ſaith he;) ſo if this, if ſmiting, and baffling, and backbiting be a friendly kindneſſe, a man ſhall have kindneſſe and friendſhip enough as this world goes; he ſhall never neede to begge for it, he ſhall have it without asking; but if he looke for any other friendſhip or kindneſſe, hee may chance to goe without it, and fall ſhort of his expectation; ſuch friends as Tacitus ſpeakes of, quibus deerat inimicus, ab amicis ſunt oppreſſi, they that had no enemy to oppreſſe and abuſe them, were abuſed and oppreſſed by their friends; ſuch as theſe the world is full of; and ſuch kindneſſe as Iul an ſhewed the poore Chriſtians, that would ſmite them on the one cheeke, to ſee whether they would turne the other, ſhall be offered a man whether hee will or no; I ſay, he that will take ſmiting kindly, ſhall

have kindneſſe good ſtore: But that is not the meaning of my text. The Originall is, percutiat me in miſericordia, let him ſmite me in mercy, or in compaſſion to my ſoule, that would doe ill or worſe if it were not ſmitten; and well doth deſerve to be accounted a kindneſſe in many reſpects, I will but touch them, and paſſe them over.
                  1 It is a kindneſſe Reducere errantem, if it be but a ſheepe that is loſt and gone aſtray, he that will reduce it and bring it home to the Shepheard and to the fold, it is a kindneſſe you will ſay: Now all we like ſheepe have gone aſtray (ſaith the Prophet) and we acknowledge it daily to God in our publike confeſſion, We have erred and ſtraied from thy wayes like loſt ſheepe. Now the ſheepe (as the Philoſopher ſaith) is pecus erraticum, a kinde of cattle that is given more to wandring and ſtraying than any other whatſoever; and beſides that ſuch is the ſimplicity and the fooliſhneſſe of a ſheepe, that being once loſt and gone aſtray, it hath not the wit nor underſtanding of it ſelfe ever to returne and come home againe (as a dogge, or a ſpaniell will doe) but wanders further and further, unleſſe ſome good body or other doe chance to ſeeke it up and find it, and bring it home: even ſuch are we, too apt to goe aſtray from God, and to loſe our ſelves in a labyrinth of ſinne, but have not the wit nor the grace of our ſelves ever to returne to the Shepheard and Biſhop of our ſoules, except ſome good body or other be a meanes under God to reduce, to reclaime and bring us home to Chriſt. Now hee that ſhall ſee his friend thus gone aſtray, and ſhall

by wholeſome admonitions, and friendly reprehenſions, endeavour to reduce him and bring him backe to God, Is not this a kindneſſe?
                  2 It is a kindneſſe Sanare aegrotum, to recover on that is ſicke, and make one ſound that is in a conſumption; ſuch is a man farre gone in ſinne, as the Apoſtle ſaith of the Cretians, Tit. 1. 12. they were 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     evill beaſts, ſlow bellies, alwayes liers; a man would thinke it a vaine thing to meddle with ſuch as were ſo farre gone in a ſpirituall conſumption, ſo ſicke to the death with a ſurfeit of ſinne; yet (ſaith the Apoſtle) doe not diſpaire of their cure, but rebuke them ſharply 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Cuttingly, that they may be ſound in the faith. A rotten Cretian by ſharpe reproofe may be made a ſound Chriſtian. Thus when a man is corrupt in his conſcience, and rotten in his communication (as the Apoſtle calls filthy diſcourſe 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Rotten cōmunication, Eph. 4. 29.) I ſay, when a mans ſoule is almoſt conſumed and dead and rotten to God-ward; he that by wholeſome advice, and heavenly phyſicke can recover ſuch a one, and make him ſound in his heart and in his faith to God, Is not this a kindneſſe?
                  3▪ It is a kindneſſe Suſcitare lethargum, when a man is in a lethargy where ſleepe may be his death; or if a man ſhould ſleepe on the top of a maſt where every nod may endanger his life, hee that ſhall awake ſuch a one▪ before any harme befall him, it is a kindneſſe even that. And ſuch is the caſe of all impenitent ſinners; Awake thou that ſleepeſt and ſtand up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee life. Beleeve it, ſecurity is as dangerous a ſleepe to the ſoule, as lethargy is to the body; now when a man

ſhal lie in wickednes, as a carrion lies in rottenneſſe, and ſhall ſleepe away his ſalvation, though his damnation ſleepeth not; He that ſhall awake ſuch a one by ſtirring reprehenſions, leaſt (if he were let alone) he might ſleepe as Siſera did (which God forbid) who ſlept but never waked againe, Is not this a kindneſſe?
                  4 It is a kindneſſe Ligare inſanum to bind a mad man, to chaine up one that is bereft of his ſences and wits, who if they were at liberty might endanger himſelfe and others; now Salomon tels us, Eccleſ. 7. that the heart of man is full of evill, and madnes is in his heart while he liveth: ſee how Bedlam-like ſome men are in their fury and paſſion, ſweare and curſe, and even worry their God and Saviour, when they are provoked by man, they right their ſpleene upon God. Yea, if their words were the ſame indeed, that they are ſaid to be in effect, if they were but ſwords, and arrowes, and raſors, indeed that would peirce and wound the body, as they wound and peirce the ſoule, nothing ſhould ſatisfie them, but the lives and bloud and death of thoſe that have offended them; ſuch miſchievous, ſuch murthering words doe they ſpit like venom out of their helliſh mouthes; now then, he that can over▪awe ſuch a one with grave and ſober reprehenſions, that can over-come and over-power and over-rule him with good language and good perſwaſions, Ne quid loquare durius (as God ſaid to Laban, Gen. 31. 24.) and ſmite him ſo, as that he dares not ſmite againe, but cry God and his neighbour mercy for

what he hath ſpoken and done amiſſe, Is not this a kindneſſe?
                  5 Laſtly▪ it is a kindneſſe Liberare perditum, to ſave a loſt man that is in imminent danger of drowning and death, if he have not ſpeedy helpe; it was Moſes caſe when he was in the river, had it not been for the kindneſſe of Pharaohs daughter; it was Ieremies caſe when he was in the dungeon, had it not bin for the kindneſſe of his ſpeciall friends; and it is the caſe of many a man that is fallen from God into a gulfe into a whirle-poole of ſinne, that winds and drawes and ſuckes him in, there is no poſſibility that his ſoule ſhould ſcape drowning and death, if mercy helpe not out: It is ſaid of the Prodigall child, Luke 15. 13. that he waſted his ſubſtance with riotous living, (ſo we read it, but the Originall is more ſignificant, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      which is in proper termes, He lived unſavingly; as much to ſay, as in that courſe that he tooke, hee was a loſt man, and could not have beene ſaved, had he not reverted and repented as hee did. And ſuch an unſaving life doth many a man lead, in gluttony and drunkenneſſe, in riot and prophaneneſſe, &amp;c. that God cannot keepe his owne truth, and ſave his ſoule. Now he that ſhall ſee his friend in ſuch a way of wickedneſſe, that as he ſaid, Ipſa ſicupiat ſalus, &amp;c. if ſalvation it ſelfe ſhould come downe from heaven and offer it ſelfe to ſuch a one, he would not, hee were not in caſe to accept it; Hee, I ſay, that by words of motion can worke upon ſuch a mans heart, can bring him to repentance, that he may become ſalvabilis within the compaſſe and poſſibilitie

of being ſaved▪ Is not this a kindneſſe? If you will beleeve S. Iames, Chap. 5. ult. it is the greateſt kindneſſe in the world, He that conver
                           ••
                        th a ſinner from the errour of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoule from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſinnes. Therefore as Saul ſaid to the Ziphites when they came and told him where David was 1 Sam. 23. 21. Bleſſed be ye of the Lord, for ye have had compaſſion upon me. So he that hath any grace, or but good nature in him, will bleſſe God for ſuch a Miniſter, or neighbour, or friend, that will ſhew him the errour of his way, that will tell him of his ſinnes, and take it as a mercie, and a kindneſſe and a compaſſion to his ſoule.
                  And ſo I come in the laſt place, to the exaltation of this kindneſſe above all that hath beene ſpoken, It ſhall be Oleum capitis (as the Originall hath it) it ſhall be a ſoveraigne, a precious, and an excellent oyle that ſhall not breake my head. When I firſt tooke this text in hand, this ſeemed unto me a very ſtrange and an uncouth expreſſion; if the Prophet had ſaid, It ſhall be a ſtone that ſhall not breake my head, or a ſtaffe, or a club that ſhall not breake my head, &amp;c. we had eaſily underſtood him, but to ſpeake of an oyle, or a balme, which we know to be ſo ſoft, ſo ſupple, ſo lith and gentle an oyntment, that hee ſhould ſpeake of breaking his head with oyle, it is ſtrange: I confeſſe it troubled me a while, till at length I conceived it might be ſpoken by contraries▪ as when a Phyſition gives a patient ſome pectorall, or cordiall, and ſaith, Take this, it will not hurt you, his meaning is, it will

helpe and doe him good. So this oyle ſhall not breake my head, that is, it ſhall heale it, being broken▪ by my owne corruption, by Satans temptations, and by the aſſention of ſuch as flatter mee in my ſinnes.
                  But why doth hee mention his head? why doth he not ſay as well, It ſhall not breake my arme, or it ſhall not breake my legges, &amp;c? Anſw. The head you know, is the principall part of man, that which is neereſt, and gives life and influence to all the lower parts, if that be broken all the body fares the worſe. It is a knowne place, Matth. 10. Be wiſe as Serpents. Now the wiſedome of the Serpent ▪they ſay) conſiſteth chiefly in this, that he will expoſe his body to any danger, take any wound in his body, ſo hee may but ſave his head, becauſe he knowes that his life lies in his head: ſo is Chriſt our head, and all our ſpirituall life lieth in him, and floweth from him; therefore our principall care ſhould be, what ever bodily danger wee expoſe our ſelves unto, to hold life in the head, hold faith and affiance in Ieſus Chriſt. But that is not all▪ I take it, when hee ſaith, it 
                           ••
                        all not breake my head, his meaning is, It ſhall breake ſomething elſe about him that ſhall be better for him; as thus; It ſhall not breake my head, but it ſhall breake my heart; hee that breakes a mans head, doth him an ill office that may endanger his life; but hee that breakes his heart with that ſame hammer that Ieremy ſpeakes of, Ier. 23. 29. by the powerfull ſubduing Word of God, doth him a right good office, that may be a meanes

though▪ Gods bleſſing to prepare his ſoule for grace, and make him a veſſell capable of mercy, for Deus Oleum miſericordiae non infundit, niſi in vas contritum, God never powreth the oyle of his mercy, but into broken veſſels, that is, into broken hearts, that are rent and torne (as it were) with remorſe and ſorrow for ſinne. As God threatned, Hoſ. 13. 8. I will rend the kall of their hearts; rather than he will ſuffer ſinne to dwell where his throne ſhould be. So this ſmiting is not to breake heads, but to breake hearts, which is better. Or thus, It ſhall not breake my head, but it ſhall breake my ſinnes-head, or the head of my ſinnes; as David ſaith, Pſal. 74. 14. The heads of Dragons are broken in the waters: what are theſe Capita Draconum, theſe heads of Dragons? but capitall crimes, predominant and maſter-ſinnes, that doe 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) that uſurpe authority and domineere in the ſoule, and threaten to devoure the conſcience if they be not taken down, and broken in the waters of repentance, in the teares of godly ſorrow for ſinne. Now he that can be a meanes to ſave his friends head, and breake his ſinnes head; to cheriſh the one and cruſh the other, Is not this a kindneſſe worth acceptation?
                  If a man have an enemy that doth him wrong, the Apoſtle counſels him, to heape coales of fire upon his head, Rom. 12▪ 20. what are theſe Carbones ardentes, theſe burning coales, or coales of fire, which the Apoſtle would have a man heape on his enemies head: Surely (I thinke) he meanes no other then thoſe, Rom▪
                      
                     
                        •
                     . 9. Tribulation and anguiſh, indignation
                     
                     and wrath, upon the ſoule of every one that doth evill (upon purpoſe to vexe his neighbour.) Now thus ſtands the caſe, Hee that revengeth his owne quarrell, and recompenſeth evill for evill, hee heapes coales of fire on his owne head, that is, makes himſelfe liable to the juſt revenge of God; but hee that by patient forbearance commits his cauſe to God, and renders good for evill, he heapes coales of fire on his enemies head, that is, he ſaves himſelfe from wrong, and transferreth the indignation and wrath of God upon him that wronged him, or whom God in flaming fire will render vengeance when he comes to judgement. And this is the way to be revenged of an enemy.
                  But then if a man have a friend that hee wiſheth well unto, and faine would reclaime him from his evill life; David would have him take another courſe, and powre drops of oyle upon his head, that is, mollifie and melt him, and worke gently and kindly upon him, by mild rebukes and reprehenſions; for this may touch his heart, but ſhall never breake his head; it may doe him good for his ſoule, but ſhall never doe him wrong for his life or reputation. And this I take to be the meaning of my text. The ſumme of all is this, Looke what vertue, what excellency there is in the moſt ſoveraigne, moſt precious oyles or balſomes for the ſalubrity and health of the body; the very ſame are to be found in kind and gentle admonitions for the health and welfare of the ſoule. Fitly therefore doth David reſemble it to oyle in many reſpects, I will but name them and conclude.
                  
                     
1 Quia medetur vulneribus, you know that balſom which is nothing elſe but oyle, is a ſoveraigne remedy ſpecially for a greene wound; ſo is ſeaſonable reprehenſion a ſoveraigne cure for one that hath newly wounded his conſcience, or his credit by ſin: Wouldeſt thou doe a ſpirituall cure upon thy friend, let him not runne on till he be feſtered and rankled with a habit of ſinning, but take him while the wound is greene: Wee ſee in Geneſis, that when Adam had ſinned, God came to him in the coole of the evening the ſame day, and reprehended him for it; becauſe God would not have him ſleepe one night in his ſinne. A Candle new blowne out, is ſoone blowne in againe; and a wound newly taken is ſooner healed; if thou would heale thy friend give him this balſome in time.
                  2 Quia expellit venenum, there be oyles (as ſallet oyles, &amp;c.) that are of ſpeciall vertue to expell poiſon taken inwardly; ſin is of a poyſonfull nature, that envenomes and endangers the very life of the ſoule (David compares it to the poyſon of Aſpes, which is the deadlieſt of all poyſons:) hath thy friend taken poyſon, hath he baned himſelfe by preſumptuous ſinnes; give him this oyle, rebuke him lovingly, it will either fetch the poyſon upward by a penitent confeſſion, or drive it downewards, and make him proſtrate himſelfe at the foot of God; one way or other it will worke upon him.

                     ection for ſinne, and therefore hath in a ſincere penitentiall manner even ſhriven himſelfe to his God; you would not beleeve what a cheerefulneſſe this breeds in a ſad heart, how light-ſome he ſhall be after his former lumpiſhneſſe; quaſi volitare facit (as a Father ſaith) it even carries a man above ground, and makes him forget the beſt of natures comforts.
                  4 Quia penetrat corda, There be oyles of that vertue, that they will enter thorow the skinne and fleſh, and bones, and worke upon the very marrow that is within. Such vertue hath the word of God, being powerfully applied and chafed in by the warme and ſoft hand of a kind and loving friend, it will enter into the very ſecrets▪ of the heart, and worke upon the very ſoule and ſpirit, and doe a cure there, where no earthly medicine can take place.
                  5 Quia recuperat moriturum. Saint Iames tels us that in the Primitive Church, when a man was ſicke unto death, the Elders of the Church annointed him with oyle, which by the miraculous vertue that God gave unto it, was a meanes to recover the party: from whence the Papiſts derive their Extreme Vnction, which (God knowes) is but an apiſh uneffectuall miſ-imitation of a miracle which now is ceaſed in the Church, and even then could not

be done by every Elder, for all had not the gift of healing (as the Apoſtle tels us:) this is indeed the onely ſpirituall oyle that we are to apply unto men on their death-beads, to ſpeake comfortably to their hearts, to work kindly upon their conſciences, and to prepare their ſoules for heaven by wholeſome admonitions.

The Lord give mercy to the houſe of Oneſiphorus; and againe; The Lord grant that he may finde mercy of the Lord in that day Now whither that good man were willing to have his name, and his goodneſſe made knowne to the world, J cannot ſay, (very likely his modeſt haſhfulneſſe would not ſeeme to deſire it;) But who

will blame Saint Pauls good nature, that he did not forget the kindneſſe of his friend, as Ioaſh forgat the kindneſſe of Iehojada; nor would ſmother his

                      in his prayers, made mention of him in his writings, and beſought the Lord for mercy to that houſe, where hee had found ſo oft refreſhing.

                     THeſe words are an experiment, or an obſervation of the Prophet David, touching the certainety and infallibilitie of Gods Providence and Goodneſſe to the righteous and their poſteritie. Wherein we may take notice of three generall Points. 1. The time, how long David had obſerved Gods dealing and diſpenſation in this behalfe; namely, from his youth to his age [I have beene young and now am old.] 2. The parties in whom David did obſerve this priviledge, that they were never

forſaken, and they were, the righteous onely [I never ſaw

That time which other young folkes waſte and melt away in folly and vanitie, or in the pleaſures of ſinne; that did he diſpend and employ in a more ſerious▪ and more ſacred manner, in devotions, and divine contemplations of the manifold wiſedome and workes of God.

                      goe to the grave in peace, becauſe in him was found

                     ſome good thing toward the Lord. There could not be much goodneſſe in him being but a child, and bred in Idolatry, yet becauſe there was ſome goodneſſe; ye ſee how God tooke liking to him, and ſhewed his acceptance by that extraordinary favour towards him. Let this be an encouragement to all young perſons, that are (as the Poet ſpeakes) Aurorae filij, ſons of the morning, that have day and life before them, to learn of David and Ieroboams ſon, to begin betimes to ſet forward to heaven, and make choiſe of Chriſt to be their Guardian in their youth, ſo ſhall they be ſure never to come to want nor beggery in their age. It was the honour and the happines of Andronicus and Iunia (as we read Rom. 16. 7. that they were in Chriſt before Paul; and it is the happieſt priviledge and priority in the world to be the firſt in Chriſt, and in the Covenant of grace; for he that is the formoſt in Chriſtianity upon earth, ſhall be ſure to have preferment according to his time both in grace and glory in the heavens. Be ambitious therefore (ye young men) of this high honour and preferment, get into Chriſt as ſoone as poſſibly you can; for if you linger like Lot in Sodome, and ſtay till you have gotten an habite, and an haunt in wickedneſſe, you would no

                      beleeve, how hard a matter you ſhall finde it then, to diſpoſe your mindes, and frame your lives to goodneſſe. Stampe Garlicke in a new morter, and it will ſmell of it ever after; let the devill get poſſeſſion of a child, he will hardly be removed when he comes to riper yeares: as we have an example, Marke 9. 20. There was an evil ſpirit had gotten ſuch hold of a yong mans body, that the Diſciples with all their power and prayers could not caſt him out; whereupon our Saviour perceiving with what extremity he came forth, with what wallowing and foaming, and renting of the poſſeſſed, He demanded, how long that had happened unto him? anſwer was made, of a child; if Satan get but handſell in child-hood, he will plead preſcription in age. Therefore let all parents take heed they doe not deale with their children, as thoſe wicked ones did, 2 Reg. 17. who offered their children to Molock: firſt▪ they carried them round about the fire, and that was called

children to paſſe through the fire, this was called Luſtratio a purging by ſacrifice: thirdly, they put them into the belly of Molock (which was an hollow Image of braſſe) and burnt them quicke; this was Vivi-comburium, burning alive. Too many ſuch graceſ

                     Prov. 16 31.) When it is found in the way of righteouſneſſe▪
                      that is, when an old man is found to be a juſt and a righteous man, then he truely deſerves reverence; but when a man hath lived to thoſe yeares, that he comes to have Caput album, and cor nigrum, a head white with hoary haires, and the heart blacke with wicked deeds; it is the moſt lamentable incongruity, and diſproportion in the world. It is obſerved out of Gen. 25. 8. that Abraham was the firſt in all the Scripture that is called by the name of an old man, and yet there were many before him that were much elder in yeares, and had lived a longer time in the world than he had done: why then ſhould Abraham be called an Old man, rather than any of his elder anceſtours? Philo gives this to be the reaſon, that it was propter canitiem virtutum, not ſo much for the age of his body, as for the antiquity of his vertue; though they were elder in yeares than he, yet Abraham was elder in grace and vertue than they, and had beene a vertuous, a religious man, and had ſerved and feared the Lord, a longer time than any of his predeceſſours: and for this cauſe was he written the firſt old man in the Regiſter of Almightie God. And ſo at this day; not he that is firſt Chriſtened, but he that is the firſt and beſt Chriſtian, is the eldeſt man in Gods account, and comes neareſt unto him who is the Ancient of dayes. Whereas he that is full of dayes and empty of grace, that hath attained bonum ſe

Such is the miſerable condition of that man or woman, whoſe body is declining to the grave, but

his ſpirit hath not learned to aſcend to God that gave it. You therefore that are aged perſons,

Sol novit occaſum ſuum, the Sun knoweth his going downe; and therefore before his ſetting ſends forth the brighter and the clearer, and the ſweeter beames: ſo you cannot but know that it will not be long, ere the ſunne of your life goe downe, therefore before the night of death come upon you, ſend forth ſome beames of light, ſome good prayers to God, ſome good deeds to the poore, ſhew ſome token for good before your death that it may appeare that your ſoules are gone the way of life. And then looke how the Rivers when they come neere the ſea, the tide comes forth to meete them; ſo when your ſoules come neere to heaven, your God and Saviour ſhall meete you in the way, and receive you into thoſe eternall manſions which himſelfe hath prepared for you.
                  So much for the Time, how long David had beene an obſerver and an eye-witneſſe of Gods Providence, ſc. from his youth to his age. I come now to the obſervation it ſelfe [Non v

                        di juſtum derelictum, I have not ſcene the righteous forſaken.] Wherein are two things remarkeable, 1. The perſons priviledged, and they are the Righteous. 2. The priviledge of thoſe perſons, and that is, they are never forſaken.
                  1. The perſons priviledged, (to wit) the Righteous. Here the queſtion will be where any ſuch perſons are to be found; for it is certaine that a Righteous man is Rara avis in terris, as this world goes. The Prophet once cried, O yee heavens, drop downe righteouſneſſe▪
                      When Righteouſneſſe (ſaith a learned man) was taken up into heaven, and the earth was utterly devoid of it. But we truſt in God, the world is not altogether now ſo bad, but that (by Gods grace) there are ſome, though not many righous perſons to be found amongſt men: but who be they? that deſerve to be ſo called, and ſo accounted? Anſ. I will ſhew you ſome particular inſtances out of the Booke of God, what kind of perſons went under the name of Righteous men in the dayes of old, and leave the application to your ſelves.
                  
                     
                        •
                      The firſt that ever went under the name of a Righteous

man, was Abel; of him you ſhall read, Heb. 11. 4. That he offered a more excellent ſacrifice than Caine by which he obtained witneſſe that he was righteous, God himſelfe teſtifying of it. Now wherein did Abels righteouſneſſe conſiſt, or what was it for which Abel was accounted righteous? the text ſheweth, it was for that he offered, uberius ſacrificium, a richer, a fuller, a better ſacrifice than Cain; for Caine alſo offered a ſacrifice to God, ſuch a one as it was, but it was a pinching ſacrifice, and the fruits that he offered were 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the refuſe of that he had; that which he cared not for himſelfe, that he offered to the Lord; but Abel made choiſe of the beſt, and offered the moſt; ſo that his ſacrifice was both more and more excellent than Caines, it was better and bigger too; and for this he obtained teſtimony from God that hee was a righteous man. Hence I note, that they which are voluntary and free in their offerings to God, that are willing God ſhould have 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the beſt and principall part of all their ſubſtance; that hold it in ſcorne (as David did) that it ſhould be ſaid, they ſhould worſhip the Lord, and be at no coſt: theſe are they in the firſt place that deſerve the name of righteous men. Contrariwiſe, they that are of a baſe and niggardly diſpoſition to God-ward, that thinke (as Iudas did) every thing to be perditio, to be waſte and loſt, that goes to the maintenance of the worſhip, and ſervice, and Miniſters of God; they are farre from Abels diſpoſition, and conſequently, farre from being Righteous in Gods account.
                  2 The next Righteous man, was Abraham, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeakes, Rom. 4. 3. Abraham beleeved God, and this was counted to him for righteouſneſſe. Now wherein did Abrahams righteouſneſſe conſiſt? the text ſaith, in his faith, in his beleefe of God. God Almighty called him out of his owne Countrey, and made him leave all his friends and meanes behind him, onely promiſing him to be his exceeding great reward; now if God ſhould have failed Abraham when hee was in a ſtrange place, he had beene utterly undone; but Abraham gave credence to his Word, and wholy caſt himſelfe upon the Promiſe and the Providence of his God, and this was counted to him for righteouſneſſe. Hence I gather, hee that beares a true faith to

God, dares repoſe and caſt and roule himſelfe upon the mercy of his God, and the merits of his Saviour, for the pardon of his ſinnes, the preſervation of his life▪ and the ſalvation of his ſoule; he that dares truſt his God in a caſe of exigence and extremity; when if God ſhould faile him hee were undone by it: I dare ſay that man is a righteous man in Gods account.

                     Pet. 2. 8. That righteous man dwelling among the Sodomites vexed his righteous ſoule from day to day with ſeeing and hearing their unlawfull deeds. Now wherein did his righteouſneſſe conſiſt? the text ſaith, in vexing and grieving at the unrighteouſneſſe of others. Try thy ſelfe by this. Art thou vexed and grieved at the heart, to ſee the unlawfull deeds, and the ungodly courſes of the world? Doſt thou mourne in ſecret (as Samuel did for Saul) ſo doſt thou mourne for thoſe, who in mens underſtanding are in the high way to hell and deſtruction; is it an Hazael to thine eyes, and a griefe to thy heart to ſee that men ſhould have no more grace nor care to ſerve and feare the Lord, but to diſhonour and provoke him every day; and doſt thou wiſh in ſincerity before God, Oh that it lay in thee to further the cauſe of God, and to hinder the increaſe and growth of Satans Kindome in the world: art thou thus minded, thus affected (as Lot was in Sodome?) then take it as an undoubted teſtimony to thy ſoule, that God who counted it to him, will count it ſo to thee, for righteouſneſſe. Whereas he that can make himſelfe merry with that which makes God and his Angels ſorry, is farre from Lots diſpoſition, and conſequently farre from being righteous in Gods account.

                  5 Looke next to Phineas, of whoſe righteouſneſſe you may read, Pſal. 106. 31. Phineas ſtood up and prayed, and the plague ceaſed, and this (ſaith the text) was counted to him for Righteouſneſſe. Now what was it that made Phineas a righteous man? It was his praying or his pacifying of God, for ſo the Greeke word

                        t &amp; placavit, he ſtood up and pacified or appeaſed God, and this was counted to him for righteouſneſſe. Hence I gather, He that labours to pacifie God by prayer, when he is provoked and diſpleaſed by ſinne▪ he that takes a ſpeedy courſe to reconcile himſelfe and others, and to make attonement with God by a ſound and ſerious humiliation, when hee ſees that wrath is gone our from the Lord; that mans name is ſurely recorded in heaven amongſt the number of the righteous in the Booke of God; Whereas he that goes on daily to provoke God, and never goes to pacifie God, is farre from Phineas diſpoſition, and farre from being righteous in Gods account.
                  6 It is ſaid of Zachary and Elizabeth, Luke 1▪ 6. They were both righteous before God. How did that appeare? the text ſaith, They walked in all the Commandements of God; though no doubt they had many a rub, many a ſlip, many a fall, yet ſtill they

kept on their way, and walked in all the Commandements of God. But how did they walke? the text ſaith 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , unblameably, or unoffenſively▪

                        , non ſine peccato (as a Father ſaith) not without ſinne, but without blame; not that God could find no fault with them, but that men could not charge them with any open crime: and herein conſiſted their righteouſneſſe before God. Hence I note▪ they that make a conſcience to frame their lives according to Gods Commandements, to keepe themſelves unſpotted of the world, and to be innocent from the great offence (as David ſpeaketh, Pſal. 19.) ſo that though they cannot be free from ſin, will endeavour to live unoffenſively, and to be free from blame; theſe are ſurely righteous in Gods acceptance, though they fall ſhort of that righteouſneſſe which Gods Commandements doe require.
                  7 Laſtly (to come home to my text) if ye would know what kind of qualited man David meant by a righteous man, Hee expounds himſelfe in the very next words to my Text, and ſaith▪ 
                     He is ever mercifull and lendeth: There be lenders enough in the world, ſuch as they be, but they be unmercifull lenders, that lend upon uſury, whoſe lending is as unmercifull, and for the moſt part, as unrighteous as a Robbery. The mercies of the wicked are cruell (ſaith the Scripture) Viſcera impiorum (as it is in the Originall) the very bowels of the wicked, which are the tendereſt parts about them; and if their bowels be ſo cruell, Oh how cruell are their Bills and Bonds? if there be cruelty in their mercies, Oh what cruelty is there in their malice? and if their beſt dealings be ſo bad, Oh how bad, how vile are their worſt? This unmercifull kind of lending is farre from making or ſhewing a man to be righteous in Gods account. But then there is another ſort of Lenders (which are the Righteous here ſpoken of) and they are mercifull lenders, that lend according to our Saviours counſell, looking for nothing againe; that is, for nothing but their owne againe, no advantage, no gaine, no uſe or their lending; but they lend in meere compaſſion and mercie to releive their poore brethren in their need and neceſſitie. He is ever mercifull and lendeth, (and marke what followeth)

                     His ſeede is bleſſed. That which worldly-minded men thinke and imagine to be the onely meanes to make their children poore and miſerable, I meane, liberalitie and ſending to the poore, that the Holy Ghoſt ſaith is the onely meanes to make them rich and bleſſed; and is ſo farre from empoveriſhing and impairing their eſtates upon earth, that it is the onely way to draw downe Gods bleſſing out of heaven upon them. As the Prophet Ieremy told Iahojakin, Ier. 22. 15. So long as thy father did helpe the oppreſſed, and ſhew kindeneſſe to the poore and needy, did he not proſper? was it not well with him? ſo that (as Chryſoſtome ſaith) We may not thinke that God made rich men onely for the profit of the poore; but God made the poore as well for the profit of the rich; Make yee friends (ſaith our Saviour) of the unrighteous Mammon: as if rich men ſhould one day finde, that the poore were their beſt friends, when they come to be received into everlaſting habitations.
                  By theſe, and the like examples and inſtances, you may eaſily conceive who they be that are counted Righteous in Gods acceptation. Therefore as Eliſha ſpread himſelfe upon the Shunamites child, 2 Reg. 4. 34. and applied his mouth to the childs mouth, his hands to the childs hands, and his body to the childs body, till the child began to neeze and to revive; ſo you ſhall doe well to apply your ſelves to theſe patternes and preſidents, to ſee what correſpondence and agreement there is betwixt

                  As for the unrighteous and ungracious that firſt forſake God, no marvell if God in Iuſtice forſake them againe; according to that anciently received rule▪

But for the righteous that cleave cloſe unto the Lord, and hold them faſt by God (as David ſpeaketh) and will not, if they can poſſibly, let go their holdfaſt; beleeve

it, God will be a ſteadfaſt friend to them, and will never faile them nor forſake them, neither in life nor in death, but while they live, he will be with them; and when they day, they ſhall

                  1 In life, the righteous are never quite forſaken, nor left utterly deſtitute of food &amp; proviſion, and ſuch other comforts which God in his wiſedome ſeeth to be moſt expedient for them. Thus ſaith the Lord, Eſay 65. 13. Behold my ſervants ſhall eate, but you, (that is, the wicked Idolaters, for to them he ſpeaketh) you ſhall be hungry; my ſervants ſhall drinke, but you ſhall be thirſty, my ſervants ſhall rejoyce, but you ſhall be aſhamed: ſo that what ever be tide the wicked, when the dayes of evill come, God will take order for the righteous, his ſervants ſhall be ſure to be provided for. In the dayes of famine they ſhall have enough, Pſa. 37. 19. that is, enough to content them, though not enough to enrich them; and if their own meanes chance to faile them at home, God will provide them meanes and friends abroad, as he told Elias, 1 Reg. 17. when he was in great diſtreſſe at the river Beſor, and had neither meate nor drinke to ſuſtaine him, The Word of the Lord came unto him, ſaying, Ariſe, get thee to Sareptah which is in Sidon, and tarry there, for behold I have commanded a widdow woman to ſuſtaine thee there. Elias knew not the widdow, neither did the widdow know him, but God who knew them both had given her a ſecret charge and commandement, that ſhee ſhould▪ ſuſtaine his Prophet, and ſo ſhe did. Thus will God (
                        〈…〉
                      than his owne ſhall want) give ſecret charges to thoſe we

                      not aware of to ſuſtaine and ſupply us at our need; as in Pauls caſe, Act. 17. when the ſhip was broken in peices which they thought ſhould have carried them to land, the Lord caſt them and conveighed them ſafe to ſhore, upon ſuch boards and plankes, as they did not, nor durſt not expect: ſo when thoſe helpes faile us which wee moſt relied upon, God will ſo provide, that ſomewhat elſe ſhall come in and bring us helpe, which we never thought nor dreamt of. Let the conſideration of this teach us to take out that Leſſon of the Apoſtle Heb. 13. 5. Let your converſation be without covetouſneſſe, and be content with ſuch things as ye have, for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor
                     
                     forſake thee: If God have ſaid it, we may ſweare it, and pawne our lives and ſoules upon it, that if wee live according to his will, hee will never leave us nor forſake us, while there is breath and life within us.
                  2 As they are ever ſuſtained in life, ſo they are never forſaken in death, but in their laſt extremity when their life is in extremis labris, God is alwayes preſent with them▪ either to relieve or to receive their ſoules.

It was promiſed as a bleſſing to good Jaſiah, 2 Reg. 22. ult. that he ſhould be gathered to the grave in peace; and yet we finde in the ſtory that Ioſiah died in warre. How then was this promiſe made good? I anſwer thus: though he died in warre outwardly, yet he died in peace inwardly; his conſcience was at peace with God, and his ſoule was paciſied and diſcharged from the trouble of all his ſinnes; ſo that whatſoever his death was, yet hee died in peace. And ſuch is the happineſſe of all the righteous, ſome die by fevers, ſome by the ſword, ſome by the fire, yet all through Gods mercy die in peace. Therefore (ſaith Balaam) Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like unto his: for though it be decreed in heaven that the Righteous muſt die as wel as the unrighteous, yet there is as great a difference betwixt the manner of their dying, as betwixt the paſſage of the Egyptians and the Iſraelites through the ſame red ſea; which was Alijs ſ

die in the Lord; ſo both in life and death, the Lord is theirs, and they are his; they never forſake the Lord, nor doth the Lord ever forſake them. [I never ſaw the Righteous forſaken.]

As when ſome tender mother will ſeeme to forſake her childe, and goe aſide, and hide her ſelfe, onely to trie whether the childe will moane after her or no, and then hearing the childs moaning, ſhe is wont to make the more of it, than ſhe did before. Thus it pleaſeth God many times to hide himſelfe (as the Prophet ſpeaketh, Eſay 45. 15.) Thou O God hid

                  Therefore as our Saviour, when he heard them ſay, He whom thou loveſt is ſicke, Iob. 11. 3. he anſwered, This ſickneſſe is not unto death; ſo when it may be ſaid, Hee whom God loveth is forſaken; it may be anſwered, This forſaking is not unto death; but when they ſeeme in the ſight of others, and in their owne ſence and feeling to be moſt rejected, and leaſt regarded of God, then is God neareſt to their helpe and ſuccor.
                  
                     
In a word, there is a twofold deſertion, the one in ſinne, the other in puniſhment; God may leave the Righteous to either or both of theſe, that is, hee may ſuffer them to fall into ſome grievous ſinne; or he may ſuffer them to lie long under ſome grievous puniſhment, and yet not forſake them neither.
                  1. Deſertion is ſin, is when God withdraweth the aſſiſtance of his grace, and leaves the righteous to fall into ſome great offence, as he did David and divers others: and of Hezekiah it is ſaid, totidem verbis, 2 Chron. 32. 31. That God left him, to try out al that was in his heart; not but that God knew all before; but Hezekiah did not know ſo much by himſelfe, nor would not beleeve, that he had ſo bad, ſo baſe an heart, till he tried it and found it by wofull experience; therefore God left him to himſelfe, to pull downe the pride of his heart, and to make him humble and vile in his owne eyes. Thus God left Saint Peter (as you know) but wherefore did hee leave him? Our Saviour ſaith, it was but onely 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Luke 22. to ſift, and winnow him as wheat. Looke then what winnowing is unto the wheat, a meanes to cleanſe it and purge it from droſſe, and duſt, and chaffe; the ſame is temptation and ſinne to the righteous, a meanes through Gods mercy and their owne repentance, to make them more cleane, more holy, more humble in the ſight of God. And for this cauſe I ſuppoſe, that God, who if he pleaſed could eaſily withhold the righteous from ſinne, doth yet in his wiſedome, leave them to themſelves and let them fall, that by falling they may have experience of their infirmity, their infirmitie may draw them to humility, humility brings them home to God, and in God they have their quietus eſt, a free and full diſcharge from all their ſinnes.
                  2. Deſertion in puniſhment, is when God caſts the righteous into tribulation and anguiſh, and then ſeemes to leave them, and neglect them, and take no notice of the burthen that lies upon them, as you read, Judg. 6. 13. the Angel of the Lord came unto Gideon and ſaid, God is with thee, thou mighty man of valour; Gideon anſwered, Alas Lord, if the Lord be with us, how then is all this evill come upon us; that good man could not per

                     wade himſelfe but that God had quite forſaken him, when he

ſaw there was ſo much evill come upon them; he thought that Gods goodneſſe, and their evills, his mercies and their miſeties had beene incompatible and could not have conſiſted nor ſtood together. But Gideon was miſtaken in that, and ſo are the Righteous many a time and oft, when they meaſure Gods preſence by proſperity, and hi
                        •
                      abſence by adverſitie. For God is not abſent when hee puniſheth▪ but onely ſeemes to withdraw himſelfe and his favour, that the Righteous might draw nearer, and creepe cloſer to God, as one that ſhivers of an Ague drawes neerer and creepes cloſer to the fire.
                  Thus you have ſeene the priviledge of the Righteous, that notwithſtanding their ſinnes, and notwithſtanding their puniſhments, yet they are never wholly deſerted nor forſaken of the Lord.
                  I come now to the laſt part of my Text, and that is, The continuance and ſucceſſion of Gods favour and mercy, that it doth not reſt onely upon the Righteous themſelves, but extendeth and enlargeth it ſelfe to their poſterity, and to their ſeed [Nee ſemen ejus querens panem, nor their ſeed begging their bread.]
                  
                  This ſhewes the gracious deſcent and propagation of Gods bleſſing when it alights. Like the Oyle that was powred on Aarons head, it wet not his head and his beard alone (as David ſpeaketh, Pſal. 1 33. 2.) but went downe to the skirts of his cloathing; ſo the mercy and loving-kindneſſe of the Lord, doth not reſt and remaine onely upon the head of the family, upon the righteous parents, but deſcends and runnes downe to the utmoſt of their poſterity, and is derived from them unto their

                        n in my Text, this ſeed here ſpoken of, is principally, if not ſolely and onely meant, and to be underſtood of the Holy ſeed, of the Righteous generation, that is, of ſuch children as are of the ſame Religion, and of the ſame righteouſneſſe that their parents were. For if you marke the Scripture, you ſhall finde, that wicked and ungracious children, though they be begotten of righteous and religious parents, yet they are not eſteemed, nor accounted as their ſeed: As you ſee, Gen. 16. 12. that Iſhmael, that ungracious younſter, whoſe hands was againſt every man, and every mans hand againſt him, Hee is called the ſeed of Hagar, not the ſeed of Abraham, though hee came out of his loynes, as well as out of her wombe, onely becauſe the promiſe of bleſſing was not made to him but to Iſaac; who is therefore called the child of promiſe: and Rom. Chapter 9. verſe 7, 8. Wee have an expreſſe place for to prove, viz. That the children of the Promiſe onely are counted for the ſeede; Others, though they come of righteous parents according to the fleſh, yet in Gods account they are not reckoned for their ſeed. And therefore Cajetan hath a good conceit upon that promiſe of God to Abraham, Gene. Chap. 13. verſe 15. The land which thou ſeeſt, I will give unto thee, and to thy ſeed for ever. It is (ſaith hee) as if the Lord had ſaid, quandu erit ſemen tuum, &amp;c. as long as they ſhall bee thy ſeed, I will give them this land; therefore when they beganne to degenerate from Abraham, both in faith and in good life, and were not his right children (as our

Saviour told the Iewes, Ioh. 8.) but rather by their wicked manners, the children of the devill; God was no longer tied to his promiſe, but did diſinherit them of that good land which they might ſtill have enjoyed, had they continued to be Abrahams ſeed, and followed the ſtepps of his righteouſneſſe. The like place we have, Pſal. 132. 11, 12. The Lord ſwore unto David, of the fruit of thy body will I ſet upon thy Throne (that is) one of thy children ſhall ſtill ſucceed thee in thy kingdome; but marke what kinde of children God meant; onely ſuch as ſhould keepe his Covenant, and doe as their father had done, If thy children will keepe my Covenant (ſaith God) and my Teſtimony as thou haſt done▪ their children alſo ſhall ſit upon thy Throne for ever-more: ſo that the promiſes of bleſſing, though they ſeem to be made promiſeuouſly to all the children of the righteous, yet are they peculiarly reſtrained to ſuch onely as tread in the ſteps of their parents vertues. Therefore in the Iewiſh Talmud, an ungracious ſonne is called (Ben ve lo ben) filius &amp; non filius, a ſonne and no ſonne; as an Eunuch is ſaid to be a man and no man, and a Batt a bird and no bird, and a Pumiſe a ſtone and no ſtone; ſo a diſobedient
                        •
                      childe, is a childe and no childe; a childe according to the fleſh, no childe according to the Spirit; a childe in mans account, no childe in Gods. It is ſtoried of Auguſtus Ceſar that hee had three untoward ſonnes, whom he uſed to terme tres vomicas, &amp; tria carcinomata, his three impoſtumes, or his three ulcerous cancers; they were ſuch an eye-ſore, and an heart-ſore unto him▪ ſo may all ungracious children be truly termed, as being no better than ulcers and cancers to thoſe that breed and bring them up, as Eſau was to Rebeccah, Gen. 26. ult.
                  
                  So that on the one ſide, whereas it is ſaid, God will viſite the ſinnes of the fathers upon the children; it is meant onely of wicked children, ſuch as do patrizare, and follow the tracke of their parents wickedneſſe, and ſo draw upon themſelves their juſt-deſerved puniſhments; ſo on the contrary, whereas it is ſaid in my text, that God will never forſake the righteous nor their

                     eed; it is meant onely of good children that follow the coppy of their Parents righteouſneſſe, and ſo bring themſelves within

the compaſſe of their parents happineſſe. It is indeed a great happineſſe to be borne and bred of righteous parents▪ for as manie a good child ſmarts for his fathers wickedneſſe, ſo many a bad one fares the better for his fathers goodneſſe, as Cham was ſaved in the Arke, not for his owne, but for his fathers ſake. And I doe verily beleeve, that the more vertuous predeceſſours a man hath, the greater mercies he ſhall receive, as the bleſſings of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, all three together were more availeable for their poſterity, than if there had beene but one ſingle of them: therfore Iacob ſaith to Joſeph, Gen. 49. 26. The bleſſings of thy Father ſhall be ſtronger than the bleſſings of my elders; for he had his fathers bleſſing, and all the reſt concurring therewith: as on the contrary, I feare, that the more evill Anceſtours one hath, the greater puniſhment he ſhall receive, if his owne ſinnes be alſo added to theirs. Therefore let all children that have good parents, thanke God for them, be obedient unto them, and take heede they doe not degenerate from them; for as it little benefits a river to come from a cleare ſpring, if it ſelfe be muddy; or as it little benefits a blinde man to ſay that his parents could ſee, or a feeble man, that his parents were ſtrong; ſo its little comfort, and leſſe credit to any young perſon, that his parents were worthy and vertuous, if he himſelfe be unworthy and vicious: for this bleſſing which is here reported of the ſeede of the righteous, belongs (you ſee) of

                  2 The laſt queſtion is, whether none of the Righteous ſeed ever did come, or ever ſhall come to beggery, becauſe David ſaith, He never ſaw their ſeed quaerentes panem, ſeeking or begging their bread. I dare not but ſay, that this generall Rule may admit of ſom exceptions; for we know that Lazarus was a Righteous man, for immediatly upon his death his ſoule was conveied by Angels in Abrahams boſome, and yet he lay begging at Dives gate. So was Bartimeus (no doubt) a Righteous man, for our Saviour gave teſtimony of him, that his faith had made him whole▪
                      and yet he begged by the high-way. So though it doe not ſeeme

                     , yet ut plurimum for the moſt part, it is a rare unuſuall thing to ſee a righteous body come to beggery. David in all his time never ſaw it, and▪ I beleeve the oldeſt man alive cannot point out many inſtances. But (I take it) the Prophets meaning may be this; that hee never ſaw the righteous nor h
                           •
                        s ſeed forſaken of God, though they did begge their bread, that is, though they ſhould be driven to that hard exigent as for a time to begge their bread, yet even in that extremity God would not forſake them, but be graciouſly preſent with them▪ to ſanctifie their poverty unto them, and to give them a comfortable enjoyment of that very bread and food, which the exigency of their hard condition had conſtrained them to begge for, I ſay, though they ſhould upon ſome extremity be enforced to make their wants knowne, and ſeeke releefe, as beggers doe, yet their God whom they ſerve will never leave them to that ſcarcity, as to make a trade and profeſſion of common beggery. As Saint Iohn ſaith in another caſe, Hee that is borne of God cannot ſinne, (the word is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                     ▪) cannot be a workeman or an Artificer of ſinne, hee cannot follow his ſinnes, as a workeman followes his trade; but ſome time or other he ſhall breake off his ſinnes by repentance, and turne to God by reformation: So hee that belongs to God, cannot, ſhall not begge his bread, ſo as to make a trade and profeſſion of beggery, God will ſurely raiſe them up ſome friends or meanes to ſuſtaine them for the preſent, and to put them into a better courſe for the time to come. For it was one of the greateſt curſes that David could banne the enemies of God withall, Pſal. 106. Let their children be vagabonds and begge their bread, let them ſeeke it alſo out of deſolate places; where no bread is to be had; now ſurely God will provide better for the children of the righteous, then that this ſhould be their lot. Conſider the Oſtrit

                        h (ſaith Iob 39. 13. God hath taken underſtanding from her, and ſhee leaves her young ones behind her, and provides not for them, but forgetteth them as if they were not hers: how comes it then that they grow up, and that the ſpecies is not extinguiſhed, but continues? Surely, becauſe, God takes care for them, and nurſeth them up.

So the Hinde that is in the wilderneſſe, as ſhee calveth, ſhee bringeth her young, and caſts forth her ſorrowes, and there leaveth them; who now ſhould provide for them, but onely God? So they ſay of the Raven, that when her young ones are newly hatched, ſhee flies away and leaves them deſtitute of foode, and there they lie in the neſt croking and crying, ready to ſtarve for want of ſuſtenance, but that God takes pitty upon them, and createth a worme out of their excrements, which crawleth into their mouthes, and ſo feeds them, and keepes them alive; therefore it is ſaid in the Pſalme, God feedeth the young Ravens that call upon him. Now if God be ſo gracious as to feed young Ostritches, and Hindes, and Ravens, much more will hee feede young children, and babes, and infants, that call upon him. My father and my mother forſooke mee (ſaith David, Pſa. 27.) and the Lord tooke mee up: In the Originall the word is, (Aſuph) I was a foundling, like a loſt childe that left by the parents and found by the pariſh: ſuch was Davids caſe (it ſhould ſeeme) for a time, and the Lord tooke care of him, and brought him up: ſo will God provide that none of the Righteous ſeed ſhall be loſt or periſh for want of looking to, but hee will finde them himſelfe, and ſet ſome good body or other to finde them out, as hee ſet Pharaohs daughter to finde out Moſes, and to nurſe him up at her owne coſt: one way or other God will take order for their ſeed and poſterity, that they ſhall never come to utter want and beggery.
                  What then is to be thought of our common beggers? are they all ungodly? are they all unrighteous? are they all the ſeed of Reprobates? I dare not ſay ſo; there may be ſome that belong to the election of grace among them, elſe God forbid. Wee reade in the Goſpel, that ſome were called in out of the High-wayes, and from under Hedges to the wedding Dinner of the Lord, which is doubtleſſe meant of beggers that lay lurking thereabouts; and marke that the Lord of the Feaſt ſaith to his ſervant

But generally as they are ſuffered and 
                        •
                     et alone, they are the very filth and vermine of the Common wealth, I meane, ſuch as have health and ſtrength, and limbs, and are able to doe good, worke and take paines in an honeſt calling, yet rather chuſe to wander up and downe the country, and ſpend their dayes in a moſt baſe ungodly courſe of life; they are indeed the very Sodomites of the land, children of Beliall, without God, without Magiſtrate, without Miniſter; diſſolute, diſobedient, and reprobate to every good work. And therefore no marvell that God in his juſt judgement doth let ſuch runnagates continue in ſcarceneſſe: for if they would ſeeke their meat at God (as David ſaith the young Lyons doe) God would take ſuch order, that they ſhould not alwayes be to ſeeke for their meate, as now they are; if they did but begge their daily bread of God (as our Saviour teacheth us in his prayer) God would ſurely provide them bread, that they ſhould need to begge it of none elſe but him: but as they reſtraine their prayers from God, ſo God reſtraines his bleſſing from them, and lets them like Runnagates continue in ſcarceneſſe.
                  But now for the ſeed of the Righteous, they have a ſpeciall relation to God, and God hath a ſpecial regard to them, as being the lambs of his owne flocke, the members of his own Son, and the children of his own adoption; and in that reſpect▪ heaven ſhall want power, and earth want meanes, before any of Gods owne children ſhall want maintenance: let the world be never ſo hard, corne never ſo deare, and their meanes never ſo ſmall, that God that multiplied the widdowes oyle, will adde ſuch a bleſſing to that little which they have, that like a Spring it ſhall continually feede them,

and keepe off beggery from ever comming on them. Here then is a comfort to all poore pious parents that have little or nothing to leave their children but onely prayers and bleſſings; God who is Rich in mercy to all that call upon him, will be a Father to thy children, a Guardian to thy orphans, and while thou art above with God in glory, God will be beneath with them in mercy, that they ſhall never feele ſuch want nor fall to beggery. It is a bleſſing promiſed to the poore, Pſal. 107. 41. That God will make them families like a flocke of ſheepe; which implyes that they ſhall thrive with a little maintenance, even as ſheepe grow fat and gather fleſh and fleeces, though the plaines and leas they feed on, be but bare and ſhort.
                  I know that generally all parents have a naturall deſire that their children ſhould proſper and doe well, when they themſelves be dead and gone. Oh that Iſhmael might live in thy ſight (ſaith Abraham to God) Oh that thou wouldſt be pleaſed to take him into thy favour and mercy, that he may never caſt off thee, nor waſte his meanes, and ſo come to want and beggery. Now if thou wouldſt be upon a ſure ground for thy childrens welfare, labour to become a righteous man thy ſelfe, and to bring thy children to righteouſneſſe too, and then there is no feare, but all ſhall be as well as thy heart can wiſh: for it is not wealth and money, but it is honeſty and piety, that muſt keepe a mans ſeed from want and beggery; it is not rents and revenewes without, but it is Righteouſneſſe and Religion within, that entailes Gods bleſſing to thy childe, and keepes the begger from the doore. This then is the onely comfort, that though parents ſhall not know how their children 
                        •
                     are when themſelves are dead and gone (For Abraham our father is ignorant of us, and Iſrael knowes us not, Iſa. 62. 16.

                      the father of the faithfull above knowes not his own children, till they come into his boſome, nor how the world goes with them: and Iob 14. 24. His ſons come to honor and he knowes it not, and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them) I ſay, though the

Righteous ſhall not know what becomes of their children after that themſelves are gathered to their fathers in peace; yet heres the comfort and the aſſurance that they have in God, that if they have brought them up in the feare and nurture of the Lord, and ſee them towardly and well-diſpoſed to goodneſſe, they may comfortably depart without feare of their miſcariage, for as God hath bin a Father to them, ſo he will be to their children, and though they leave them behind on earth they ſhall finde them againe in heaven. At which bleſſed center God of his mercy grant we may all one day meet, where we ſhall never be divided any more, but ſhall live together, and love together in eternall ſolace, in eternall felicity world without end.

                     IT is well knowne that this Sunday, and ſome of the reſt that are gone before, are commonly called in our Liturgie by the name of Advent-ſundayes, as you would ſay in plaine Engliſh Comming Sundayes. And wote you why? becauſe therein wee doe thankefully celebrate and ſolemnize the bleſſed time and memory, of our Saviours comming to us in the fleſh, and his arrivall from heaven in this vale of miſery. If any man deſire a

reaſon why we celebrate the comming of our Saviour in ſo ſolemne, ſo ſacred, and ſo ſettled a maner, being gone and paſt 1600. yeares agoe? Saint Iohn hath given me an anſwere to my hand, Becauſe grace and truth came by Ieſus Chriſt, Iohn 1. 17. When Ieſus Chriſt came from the boſome of his Father, he came not empty-handed, nor unprovided: but brought Truth and Grace into the world with him: Truth to direct us to heaven, and Grace to deliver us from hell: and that's a Congiary that deſerves commemoration to the worlds end. If any man ſhall yet further inquire, what is this Grace to us? or what are wee the better for the Grace that hee brought? For that my text will reſolve you, and make it evidently appeare unto you, that Chriſt is no niggard of his Grace, neither doth he keepe it to himſelfe (as Nabal did his victuals) but doth graciouſly impart it, and mercifully beſtow it, ſo much upon every one, as he ſeeth in his wiſedome to be enough and ſufficient for him. My Grace is ſufficient for thee. And let that ſuffice for the occaſion and choyce of my text, that it is not 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , not altogether unſutable and impertinent to the time.
                  Come we now to the text it ſelfe, which is nothing elſe but The Oracle of God, or Gods owne immediate voyce, not diſdaining to utter it ſelfe from Heaven, for the comfort and ſatisfaction of his poore diſtreſſed Suppliant here on earth. For thus ſtood the caſe.
                  Our Apoſtle at this time was puniſhed with two ſtrange and ſtrong afflictions, the one internall, the other externall; the one he termeth the Thorne in

the fleſh, the other the Meſſenger of Satan that buffeted him. By that ſame 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Thorne or ſplinter in the fleſh. I ſuppoſe hee did meane his owne concupiſcence, his owne corruption and luſt, which is as painefull and vexatious to a tender ſoule, as a thorne in the hand, or a ſplinter under the nayle, is irkeſome and grievous to the tender fleſh. By that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the meſſenger, or the angell of Satan, muſt needs bee underſtood the Devills temptation; for before that wicked one come himſelfe, he ſends his Meſſenger or his Angell before him to make way for his entertainement, and as Eliſha ſaid of the King of Iſraels man which was ſent to behead him, 2 Reg. 6. 32. Is not the ſound of his Maſters feet behind him? ſo beleeve it, whenſoever an evill temptation, or a temptation to evill doth come before, the devill himſelfe who is the maſter and maker of it is not farre behinde. Now marke how this evill angell uſed, or rather abuſed S. Paul; the text ſaith, He fell foule upon him, and buffeted him; now you know that buffeting is a malicious act joyned with violence, or a violent act joyned with malice, and it ſignifies unto us, what a malicious minde the Devill beares to Gods eſpeciall ſervants; if he cannot by faire meanes entice, and allure, and inveagle them to ſinne; if God will give him leave, he will fall upon them by ſoule meanes, even 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      to buffet them, and enforce them in a manner to ſin againſt God and their owne ſoules. Thus ſorely was our poore Apoſtle haunted, thus cruelly was he handled, both with venemous corruptions within, and with violent temptations

without, ſo that neither inwardly, nor outwardly: hee could bee free or at liberty to enjoy himſelfe and his God: Whereupon (ſaith the text) Hee beſought the Lord thrice, that they might depart from him; all his deſire, all his prayer to God was, to be rid of theſe annoyances. Now marke the anſwere, and obſerve the Oracle of Almighty God.
                  Iuſt as ſome skilfull Phyſitian, when his Patient in a feavour calls for drinke, gives him a ſirrope, or ſome conſerve, and ſo quencheth his thirſt in a better kinde, than drinke would doe: ſo dealt the Lord with Paul, who was now in a ſpirituall feaver, and cryes out amaine, (as it were for drinke) that is, for ſome preſent refreſhing, and releaſe of his puniſhment. God ſeemes to take no notice of that, but quencheth his ſoules thirſt in a better kinde, gives him a ſpirituall conſerve, endues him with his Grace, and let that content thee (ſaith God)▪ let that ſuffice thee; for that, even that alone is entirely enough and ſufficient for thee.
                  
                     My Grace is ſufficient for thee.
                     
From which paſſage of Gods providence (before I come to particulars) give me leave to commend unto you this briefe obſervation in generall: viz. That if after all our prayers, after all our entreaties and importunities with God for private and particular favours and mercies; as for health in time of ſickneſſe, for eaſe in time of paine, for reſt and deliverance in the time of trouble and affliction: Though God ſhould ſeeme to take no notice of us, but deny or with-hold all theſe things from us; if he doe but condeſcend unto us in this one thing (as

he did to Saint Paul) if he doe but vouchſafe us his Grace, Summam votorum attigimus, wee have as much as heart can wiſh, wee have that which is in ſtead, or in liew of all the reſt. As the Iewes write of their Mannah, that it had in it Omne delectamentum, all manner of delightfull taſtes, and was in ſtead of Bread, in ſtead of meate, in ſtead of all kindes of dainty fare; ſo may it bee truely affirmed of the Grace of God, that it is in ſtead of health, in ſtead of wealth, in ſtead of all other earthly bleſſings whatſoever: ſo that as a man that walkes in the Sun, never lookes nor regards whether the Moone or the Starres ſhine or no, becauſe he hath no need of their light: ſo he that enjoyeth the light of Gods countenance, that hath the Grace of God to befriend and beſtead him, needs care the leſſe for theſe inferiour commodities, theſe Bona ſcabelli (as the Fathers call them) theſe goods of Gods Foote-ſtoole; becauſe, if he have them not, God will ſo provide he ſhal have no need of them. In a word then, if thou wert put to thy choiſe, as Salomon once was, to aske any one thing at the hands of God, and to have promiſe of acceptance, what ſhould that one thing be? wouldſt thou aske for riches, or pleaſure, or long life, &amp;c? Alas, all theſe things thou mayſt have, (as many a man hath had) an
                        •
                      be never the holyer, never the happier, never the higher in Gods account and favour: Leave therefore all theſe things to Gods diſpoſall and diſpenſation; let God doe with thee for theſe things what ſeemeth good in his owne eyes; but pitch thou thy heart, and the deſire of thy ſoule

upon that Vnicum neceſſarium, that one thing neceſſary (which our Saviour ſpeakes of) in compariſon whereof all other things in the world are needles and ſuperfluous, I meane upon the Grace of God, and nothing elſe; and in thy daily prayers to Almighty God, let this evermore be the maine of thy requeſts. Whatſoever thou denyeſt me for other things, Lord, grant me thy Grace, and it is ſufficient.
                  
                  
                     My Grace is ſufficient for thee.
                     
Out of which words I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you foure remarkable points, perhaps not unworthy your obſervation. 1. The meaning of the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , O
                        •
                      what is meant by the Grace here ſpoken of. 2. The Author▪ or the owner of this Grace, whoſe it is, and to whom it doth of right belong, and that is to God, as the next word implyes, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     My Grace. 3. The efficacy or vertue of this Grace, what it profiteth, and whereunto it availeth, and thats expreſt in the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , it is ſufficient; and therein I ſhall ſhew you, how, and wherein the ſufficiency of Gods grace doth conſiſt. 4. The Application of this Grace, or the bringing of it home to the conſcience and ſoule of each beleeving Chriſtian, and that I gather out of the laſt word, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ; that God doth not ſay in generall 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , My Grace is ſufficient for all; nor in ſpeciall 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , My Grace is ſufficient for many; but in particular, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , My grace is ſufficient for thee, and ſo for me, and ſo for every one upon whom God in mercy is pleaſed to beſtow it, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , My Grace (ſaith God) is ſufficient for thee.
                  
                  
                     
Of theſe in their oder as briefely and effectually, as God and his good ſpirit hath enabled mee; and firſt of the meaning of the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , or what is meant by the grace here ſpoken of.
                  By the grace of God (in few words) I conceive to be meant nothing elſe but the favour and goodwill of God; that which the ſchoolemen terme Complacentiam dei, the well pleaſedneſſe of God: the ſame which the ſcripture calleth Lucem 
                           •
                        aciei, the light of Gods countenance. Pſal. 67. 1. Becauſe, as God is ſaid to frowne and bend his browes upon the wicked traine, Pſal. 34. ſo on the contrary, hee ſeemes to ſmile (as it were) and to looke amiably and lovingly, and lightſomly upon all them that are in grace and favour with him. It is an uſuall expreſſion among us to ſay, ſuch a one is in great grace with the King, or in great grace at the Court, we meane, he is in great favour there. And it is a phraſe no leſſe uſuall in ſcripture, Gen. 6. 8. Noah found grace in the ſight of God, i. e. hee found favour in his ſight; and God Almighty ſaith of Moſes Exod. 
                     
                        •
                     3. 12. Inveniſt
                           •
                         gratiam coram me, Thou haſt found grace in my ſight▪ i. d. favour and good acceptance: And ſo the Angel greets the bleſſed Virgin, Luke 1. 28. feare not Mary, Inveniſti gratiam, Thou haſt found grace▪ i. e. thou art highly favoured of the Lord. So that the grace of God, and the favour of God are (as Ioſeph ſaid of Pharaohs dreams) both one and the ſame. Now the thing that I muſe upon is this, that the grace and favour of God is thus often, if not alwayes expreſt in the Bible, ſub termino inveniendi
                           •
                        , under the name and terme of

finding: It is not barely ſaid of Noah, and Moſes, and the Virgin Mary, fuerunt, they were in grace and favour with God, but Invenerunt, they found it: this phraſe doth certainely ſeeme to imply (as Oleaſter well obſerves) that the grace and favour of God is ſometimes found, as a poore man findes a treaſure, or a bag of gold, non induſtriâ, ſed caſu; not by any induſtry or paines▪taking for it, but meerely by caſualty and Gods providence in it. As when Ioſephs brethren found their money in their ſackes mouthes, it inriched them, and it raviſhed them too, with wonder and admiration, Gen. 42. 28. in like manner, when a poore diſconſolate wretch, ſhall without all deſert, and beyond all expectation, finde a ſenſible experiment of Gods favourable goodneſſe towards him; how can hee chuſe, but even bleſſe himſelfe and ſay, Lord, what am I that ſuch a favour ſhould be caſt upon me! In a word, as Iacob anſwered his aged father when hee queſtioned him about the matter of his veniſon, Gen. 27. 20. How is it that thou haſt found it ſo quickly my ſonne? (ſaith he) Becauſe the Lord thy God brought it to my hand. In like ſort, if any ſhall ſeeme to queſtion the matter, how it comes to paſſe that ſome one man findeth favour and riſeth to preferment ſo eaſily and ſo quickly over that ſome others doe, which to our thinking deſerves it better, In promtu ratio, the Lord their God brings it to their hand: when God brings a bleſſing to hand, the labour is not long to finde it. But that by the way.
                  I ſhall here take occaſion to reſolve you of two

queſtions, which doe offer themſelves to your conſideration; the firſt is this, when a man wants the grace and favour of God, how ſhall he doe to finde it? the ſecond is like unto it, when a man hath found Gods grace and favour at his need, how ſhall he doe to keepe it, that hee doe not forfeit it, nor looſe it againe? I will anſwer you for both, in a word.
                  Doſt thou want the grace of God, and fayne wouldeſt finde it? Thou muſt doe two things for it.
                  Firſt, thou muſt depreciari teipſum (it is Tertullians word) thou muſt diſparage and diſgrace, thou muſt humble and abaſe thy ſelfe before the face of God: for if that bee true which our Saviour ſaith, John 10. 35. non poteſt ſolvi ſcriptura, The ſcripture cannot bee broken: then no man living can finde Grace with God, but he that is truely humble (for God reſiſteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble) Let one example ſerve for all, and it is a ſeaſonable one for this time: that of the bleſſed Virgin, of whom wee ſpake before: the Angel told her (as you have heard) that ſhee was 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      highly or extraordinarily in favour with God, for indeede ſhe had ſuch grace, as never mortall woman had the like with God, to bee made 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      the Mother of God, and to beare him in her body, who in his body bare away the ſinnes of all the world; to give her owne Saviour ſucke; it was a favour beyond expreſſion: well, but whence came this to paſſe that the Virgin Mary found this favour with God rather then any other virgin in

                     Iſrael? no doubt (as our Saviour ſaid in another caſe) many widowes were in Iſrael in the dayes of Elizeus, but to none was the Prophet ſent, ſave onely to the widow of Sareptah: ſo, many virgins were in Iſrael in the dayes of the virgin Mary, yet to none was the Angel ſent, but to her onely: And why to her, and not to them? ſhee that knew it beſt, gives the reaſon herſelfe in her Magnificat which we daily read; My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour; for why? Reſpexit humilitatem (ſaith ſhee) Hee hath regarded the lowlineſſe of his hand maiden. It was not then for her lovelineſſe, but it was for her lowlineſſe; not for her hanſomeneſſe, but for her humbleneſſe that ſhe found ſuch grace and favour with God above her fellow virgins: Other Virgins there might bee that were as chaſt as ſhe, as beautifull as ſhee, and farre more wealthy and gay then ſhe was; but no Virgin in Iſrael, nor in all the world, was ſo humble nor ſo lowly as ſhe was; and this was the onely materia struendae miſericordiae, (if I may ſo ſpeake) the matter that Gods mercy had to worke upon; that, that onely, was the foundation and ground▪worke of all the grace and favour that ſhe found with God. In like manner if thou doſt deſire to bee partaker of the ſame mercy, to finde favour with God as ſhee did, thou muſt alſo be partaker of the ſame humility, thou muſt bee humble and lowly as ſhee was: doe as Benhadads ſervants did to Ahab 1. Reg. 20. 31. We have heard (ſay they) that the Kings of Iſrael are merciful kings, let us goe then and put ſackcloth upon our loynes, and
                     
                     ropes upon our heads, and ſo humble our ſelves before him, peradventure wee ſhall finde favour with him, that we ſhall not die but live: ſo thou haſt heard that the God of Iſrael is a mercifull God, ſtand not then upon termes of eaſe or ſtate if thou loveſt thy ſelfe, but goe and humble thy ſelfe unto him, proſtrate thy ſelfe before him, pray and ſeeke his face in the lowlieſt, the dejectedſt, the devoteſt manner that poſſibly thou canſt expreſſe both with thy body and with thy ſoule, and (beleeve it for a truth) if any thing under heaven bring thee into favour with the God of Heaven, that will doe it, deprectari teipſum, to diſparage thy ſelfe.
                  Secondly, thou muſt Appropriare Chriſtum, thou muſt appropriate Chriſt unto thy ſelfe, thou muſt ſhrowd thy ſelfe under thy Saviours wings, thou muſt ſue to God under his protection and patronage, and as the Herodians Acts 12. made friendſhip with Blaſtus the Kings Chamberlaine to helpe them into favour with Herod; ſo muſt thou make friendſhip with Ieſus Chriſt, for it is hee and onely he that can helpe thee into grace and favour with thy God. Gratificavit nos in dilecto (ſaith the Apoſtle Ephe. 1. 6) He hath brought into grace, or he hath made us accepted in his beloved ſonne. Gratiam pro Gratiâ (ſaith Saint Iohn elſewhere, Ioh. 1. 16.) Wee have received Grace for Grace; that is, for the grace and favour that Chriſt hath with God, wee alſo are received into grace and favour with him: For otherwiſe, as Eliſha told the King of Iſrael. 2. Reg. 3. 14. As the Lord liveth were it not that I regard the preſence of Iehoſaphat, I would
                     
                     not looke toward thee, nor ſee thee: ſo ſtands our caſe with God, wee are of our ſelves ſuch vile bodies (as the Apoſtle rightly termes us (who ſhall change our vile bodies) I meane ſofoule and ſo full of corruption and luſt and ſinne, ſo odious and abominable in the holy eyes of God; that as the Lord liveth, were it not that God doth regard the perſon, the preſence and the prayers of Ieſus Chriſt our true Iehoſaphat hee would not looke to us nor ſee us: but that (as hee ſaith himſelfe,) This is my beloved Son in whom I am well-pleaſed. (There come we into favour) and marke, that hee doth not ſay, This is my beloved ſonne which pleaſeth mee well, but in whom I am well-pleaſed; which intimates a further matter unto us; namely, that our bleſſed Saviour doth not onely pleaſe God his father, for his owne part, but that God in him, and for his ſake is well-pleaſed even with them that are in themſelves (as the Prophet ſpeakes) even veſſels wherein there is no pleaſure. Ier. 22. 28. Thou therefore that deſireſt to get into favour with thy God, flatter not thy ſelfe in thy owne eyes, thinke not that God will accept thee for thy owne perſon, or for any other perſonall qualities or abilities that are in thee; but as Iacob ſhrouded himſelfe under the garments of his elder brother, and by that meanes gott him the bleſſing of his father; ſo doe thou ſhroud thy ſelfe under the garments of thy elder brother in Heaven; I meane, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, Labour to be found of God, not having on thy owne righteouſneſſe, but the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt by faith: Say as Tertullian doth, Mihi vendico
                     
                     Chriſtum, mihi defendo Ieſum; claime thou thy part, ſtand thou for thy right in Ieſus Chriſt; and as thou art a Proteſtant, ſo make this proteſtation before God and the world, that thou hopeſt for grace and mercy, not by any merits or deſerts of thy owne, but meerely by the merits, and by the ſpirit, by the death, and by the blood of Ieſus Chriſt. This is another infallible way for a man to finde the grace and favour of God, that wanteth it, Appropriare Chriſtum, to get an intereſt into Gods beloved Sonne, our deare and precious Saviour.
                  2. Now for the ſecond queſtion; Haſt thou found the favour of God, and faine wouldſt keepe it? Thou muſt 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (it is the Apoſtles owne word, Gal. 2. 14.) Thou muſt walke with a right foote to God▪ward; or as Iohn Baptiſt expreſſeth it in other tearmes, thou muſt Rectas facere ſemitas tuas, Make thy paths ſtraight; the meaning is, Thou muſt binde thy ſelfe to the good behaviour unto God, thou muſt reſolve againſt ſinne and evill, and ſet thy ſelfe conſtantly, carefully, ſincerely to walke with God, ſo farre forth as frailty ſhall permit thee, ſo that though there fall out many intercurrent infirmities in the courſe of thy life, for a man may, etiam in bono itinere pulverem 
                           •
                        olligere, gather duſt and ſoyle even in a good way, yet let it be the generall drift and deſire of thy ſoule, in nothing willingly to ſinne againſt God, but in every thing to pleaſe him, and to approve thy ſelfe unto him: which if thou doſt, ſee what will follow upon it, Pſal. 84. 11. The Lord will give Grace and Glory,
                     
                     and no good thing will hee with-hold from them that walke uprightly with him. The Scripture ſaith of Enoch, that hee was Raptus a facie malitiae, ſnatcht (as it were) out of this wicked world, as a brand is ſnatcht out of the fire and ſaved from burning; that is, Hee was tranſlated alive from earth into Heaven, and never felt, nor taſted of death: This (you will ſay) was an extraordinary favour of God, but what might bee the reaſon of it? Moſes tells us, Gen. 5. 24. it was becauſe Hee walked with God; the Apoſtle commenting upon it, Heb. 11. 5. ſaith, it was becauſe He pleaſed God, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , (is the word) which ſignifies, Hee gave God content, or kept Gods favour and good will; ſo then, the way to keepe Gods favour and good will, is to pleaſe God, and give him content; and the way to doe that, is to walke with God as 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      
                     did. But what doth Moſes meane by 
                        〈…〉
                      
                     God, how may that be done? Anſ
                           ••
                        
                      Generally, A man may then be ſaid to walke with God, when hee leads his life in ſuch a way as God doth beſt accept, in the way of of godlineſſe and honeſty, in the way of temperance and ſobriety, in the way of diligence and induſtry; when a man hath minde on God in all his wayes, and deſires Gods protection and conduct to guide his feete into the way of peace. This is, in a generall ſence and acceptance to walke with God more particularly; A man is then ſaid in proper ſence to walke with God, when hee walkes with none elſe but God; as Iſaack did, when he ſequeſtred himſelfe, and went out alone into the fields to meditate and to pray, Gen. 40. 69. (The

word (Suach) ſignifieth both, then went he out to walke with God: And indeed there is no ſuch time for a man to converſe with God, and (as the phraſe is in Iob) to acquaint himſelfe with the Lord, as when he is ſolitary, private, and alone: If any thing grieve a man, or lye heavie upon his conſcience, when he is Alone, he may freely diſburden his heart into the boſome of God. If a man have faulted any way, or done amiſſe for want of good take-heed, when he is Alone, hee may freely and fully bewaile and bemone, and even beſhrew and ſhrive himſelfe unto the Lord his God. If a man want any good thing thats requiſite and neceſſary either for the body or the ſoule, when hee is Alone, he hath free and full opportunity to beg and to entreat it, to win and to obtaine it at the hand of God. No ſuch time for a man to reconcile himſelfe, and to make his owne attonement and his peace with God, as when he is Alone. In a word then, if thou doſt deſire to keepe the favour of the Lord, and to abide in his grace and his good-will; doe as Iſaack did, take one turne with thy God every day thou riſeſt; ſteale away from thy earthly occaſions (as our Saviour ſtole away from his earthly Parents) to doe the buſineſſe of thy heavenly Father, or as the Apoſtles word, 2 Pet. 3. 9. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      to retire and repent. Let no day paſſe thee without ſome commerce and conference with thy God; and (beleeve it) if there bee any meanes in the world to faſten and rivet the favour of God unto thy ſoule, that will doe it, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      to walke aright with God.
                  
                     
I have done with the firſt generall part of my text concerning the meaning of the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , or what is meant by the Grace here ſpoken of: Come we now to the ſecond, and that is the Author and Owner of this Grace, expreſt in the next word (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) God claimes it at his owne peculiar, and calls it by a terme of propriety, My Grace, to ſhew that none hath to doe with the diſpenſing of that but himſelfe alone.
                  Now if you marke the courſe of Scripture, you ſhall obſerve that there is not any thing which belongs to man, but in one place or other God claimes it for his owne. Though he hath given the earth to the Children of men, yet hath he not alienated it from himſelfe, but that ſtill, The Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſſe thereof: whatſoever fulneſſe the earth affords us, whether it be Fields full of Corne, Folds full of Sheepe, Orchards full of Fruit, Tables full of Meate, &amp;c. all theſe fulneſſes are the Lords, who openeth his hand, and filleth all things living with ple
                           •
                        teouſneſse. And not onely the earth in generall and the fulneſſe thereof, but the very Cattell and Beaſts of the earth, are all the Lords too: Pſal. 50. 10. All the Beaſts of the Forreſt are mine (ſaith God) and ſo are the Cattell upon a thouſand Hills. The Beaſts of the Forreſt (we know) are ferae naturae, of a wild unruly nature, they know no Maſter, acknowledge no owner, are in ſubjection to no keeper; yet becauſe the Lord takes care of them, gives them their being, and provides them their food, therefore doth he juſtly claime them for his owne, and ſaith, (All the Beaſts of the Forreſt ar e
                     
                     mine) and ſo are all the Cattell upon a thouſand hills; whether they be ſheepe or goates; Neate or Fowle; there's no man living hath any right unto them upon earth, but he holds it in capite, and hath his right from the God of Heaven.
                  Not onely ſo; but the very Corne in our Barnes, the Wine in our Cellers, the Wooll upon our Sheepes backes, the Lord claimes for his owne, as yee may ſee, Hoſ. 2. 8, 9. For God beſtowes his bleſſings, as the Sunne doth his beames, in ſuch a manner, as that they depend ſtill upon himſelfe after he hath beſtowed them. Nay to come neerer yet, the very money that is in our purſes or coffers, whether we keepe it cloſe to hatch a purchaſe; or put it out, as the Lyon puts out his claw to rend and gripe the poore needy borrower; whereſoever God findes it, he claimes it for his owne, Hag. 2. 8. The Silver and the Gold is mine; and as little conſcience as men make of their gaines, they muſt one day be accountable to the Lord, How they got it, how they uſed it, and how they waſted it. All this is to let us underſtand to whom wee are beholden for our Lands, for our goods, and for whatſoever elſe we inherit or injoy in this world, even to the Father of lights, (as Iames termeth him, Iam. 1. 17) from whom both 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      both gifts and goods, and all deſcend unto us; therefore as in the ſacrifices of old, whoſoever had the fleſh, God had the fat; ſo whoſoever hath the goods of this world, let God have the glory, for his they are, and from him we have and hold them.
                  But there is one thing in my text, for which wee

are more beholding to God, then for all the reſt; and that is for His Grace, other things though they come originally from God, yet they come mediately by the meanes of other inſtruments, by Parents or friends, or Benefactors; but Grace is a thing that comes ſolely, and onely, &amp; immediatly from God; as there was no corne to be had in Egypt, but from the hand of Ioſeph, ſo no grace to bee had on earth, but from the hand of God: He is the God of all Grace (as Saint Peter truly ſtileth him) there is no grace whatſoever that is wanting in man, but there is a gracious ſupply to be had in God, which made David (as it were) in a rapture to cry out and ſay, Oh taſt and ſee how gracious the Lord is, Pſal. 34. 8. Firſt taſt, and then ſee; becauſe as a man can never truely tell the ſweetneſſe of honey, till he have taſted it firſt; ſo can hee never truely ſee nor perceive nor underſtand how gracious a God the God of Heaven is, till he have firſt had a taſt of Gods grace, and an experience of Gods favour in himſelfe and for his owne ſoul. Taſt then and ſee how gracious the Lord is: Gracious in his Throne, for it is the Throne of Grace, Heb. 4. 16. gracious in his ſpirit, for it is The ſpirit of Grace. Zach. 12. 10. Gracious in his Word, for it is the Word of Grace. Acts 20. 30. and above all, gracious in himſelfe, for Hee is the God of Grace: yea, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     The God of all Grace. 1. Pet. 5. 10. And therefore doſt thou deſire wiſedome? Hee is the God of that Grace; doſt thou want patience? hee is the God of that too; doſt thou ſtand in neede of Faith, or Hope, or Charity? he is the God of all theſe: Oh what a gracicious

God doe we ſerve, and what graceleſſe beaſts we are if wee ſerve him not, ſeeing hee hath grace ſufficient for all his ſervants, My Grace (ſaith God) is ſufficient for thee.
                  
                  In a word then, for aſmuch as all Grace is of God, that He, and none but He, hath the diſpoſall and the diſpenſation of it to whom hee pleaſeth; take (I beſeech you) into your conſideration theſe briefe advertiſements following.
                  1. N
                           •
                         deficias, doe not faile of it; It is the Apoſtles owne caveat. Heb. 12. 15. Looke diligently least any man faile of the Grace of God. God for his part is ſo gracious, that he denyes his grace to none but offers it, and (I may ſay) gives it to every one that will but aske and accept it, as the Scripture ſaith of Araunah, 2. Sam. 24. 23. when hee offered King David his oxen for a ſacrifice, and his threſhing inſtruments for wood to burne them; the text ſaith, All theſe things did Araunah as a King give unto the King: whereas we know, he did not give them, becauſe David would not accept of them, but his will was to have given them, and that the holy Ghoſt accompts as a gift, and ſo recordeth it. In like ſort, God offers his grace in the Word and Sacraments, his will is graciouſly and freely to beſtow it, if ſinfull men were but like▪minded to receive it, and to make themſelves capable of ſo great a mercy by deſiring it. It was Gods owne propoſition to his owne ſonne, Pſal. 2. 8. poſtulaa me, &amp;c. deſire of mee, and I will give thee the heathen for thy inheritance, &amp;c. If hee that was ſole heyre of Heaven and earth haeres ex toto aſſe, as the Romans
                     
uſed to ſtile them) could no otherwiſe come by his inheritance but by way of petition to deſire it afore he had it, much more ſo is it with us; where no deſire it, looke for no gift, no prayer, no grace. We ſee in Eſay, God makes a gracious promiſe to his people that he would put away all their ſinnes, &amp; take them all into his favour as though they had never ſinned; but marke the condition, for all theſe things I willbe ſought unto (ſaith God.) So though God offer his grace to men, hee will not force it upon them againſt their wills, hee will have them ſue for it, hee will have them deſire it, or they may thanke themſelves if they goe to hell without it; and God may juſtly complaine of them, as David did of Naball. 1. Sam. 25. 21. All is in vaine that I have done for theſe men. Seeing then there is no backwardneſſe in God to make deniall of his grace, but hee is willing to beſtow it upon all that are deſirous to imbrace it; oh be not wanting to thy owne mercy, ne deficias, doe not faile of it.
                  2. Seeing that grace is the Lords, nè ſuperbias, be not proud of it, doe not 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (as Saint Iames his word is, cap. 3. 5.) doe not magnifically lift up thy ſelfe aboue thy brethren whoſe graces are not ſo eminent as thine: but rather as the eares of corne, and the bowes of trees, the more they are laden with fruit, the lower they hang to the earth: ſo the more God hath laden thee with his graces and favours, be thou ſo much the more lowly in thy owne eyes; and thinke not ſcorne to doe as thy God doe, who though his Glory bee above the heavens (ſaith David, Pſal. 113. 
                        •
                     .) yet hee

doth Abaſe himſelfe to behold the things that are in the earth; and as the more direct the Sunne is over us, the ſhorter and leſſer is the ſhadow: ſo the more that Gods grace is over thee, and in thee, the leſſer let the ſhadow of pride bee ſeene to come from thee: for conſider (ſaith the Apoſtle) what haſt thou that thou haſt uot received? or what is that thou canſt properly call thine owne, but mendacium &amp; peccatum▪
                      lying and ſinne? as our Saviour ſaid of the devill Iohn 8. when hee ſpeaketh a lye, hee ſpeaketh de ſuo, of his owne, God never put that into him: ſo for thy ſinnes thou muſt thanke thy ſelfe, or rather indeede beſhrewe and blame thy ſelfe, for they are thy owne; but if thou haſt any grace or any vertue in thee, thanke God for that; for it is not thine▪ it is the Lords: ſeeing then thou art but a Tributary to God, and haſt nothing that good is, but what thou art beholding, and muſt be countable to the Lord for it, nè ſuperbias, be not proud of it.
                  3. Seeing Grace is the Lord to beſtow on whom he pleaſeth, nè invideas, doe not envie it, let not thine eye be evill becauſe God is good, nor thinke the worſe of another man becauſe God is better to him then unto thee: for Gods grace is his owne, he may give it to whom he will. When God ſhall take of his grace, and of his good ſpirit, (as Samuel ſaid to Saul) ſhall give it to a neighbour of thine that is better then thou: what cauſe haſt thou to be envious at this? and not rather to humble thy ſelfe, and thinke that (as Daniel told the king. cap. 5. 27.) God hath weighed thee in a ballance, and found
                     
thee, minus habens, wanting to God and to thy ſelfe, and therefore hath juſtly with holden his favour from thee, and given it to one that will uſe it better, for his glory, and for the Churches good, farre be it from any child of God to Cheriſh in his breſt the ſpawne of that old ſerpent the divell; for envy is no better; (as the learned have well obſerved) there is ſo neere a reſemblance betwixt an envious man and the divell, that in the booke of God the one is taken for the other; ſo the divell is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                     ▪ an envious man (Mat. 13. 28.)▪ &amp; an envious man is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      a devil (Iohn 6. 70.) How farre better would it become us in this reſpect to be 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      like the Angels of heaven▪ who now at Chriſtmas time, when they ſaw that our Saviour would in no wiſe take their nature which was far better then ours; but tooke our nature upon him, which was farre worſe then theirs, and which was moſt of all, and would have gone moſt againſt our ſtomackes, commanded them to worſhip it, Heb. 1. 6. they were ſo farre from envying, or taking offence at this; (as that elder brother did in the Goſpel, when the yonger was received to grace after his riotous courſe) that even then they ſung an Anthem for the joy of our happineſſe, and even to this day; (Saint Peter tells us 1. Pet. 1. 12.) they doe 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      ſtoope downe (as it were) in duty and love, to honour the miſtery of Chriſts incarnation, and to admire the grace and favour of God to mankind: In a word then, ſeeing that the Honouring of Gods grace whereſoever it lights, is a quality ſo Angelicall; and the contrary ſo diabolicall,

let it bee thy practiſe evermore to reverence him that hath it, to judge thy ſelfe unworthy of it, ſeeke it in Gods name, and get to bee partaker in it, but in any caſe ne invideas, doe not envie it.
                  4. Seeing that grace proceedes from ſo holy a fountaine as is the Lord, ne Abutaris, doe not abuſe it, doe not vitiate nor ſtaine it with ſinne, as Lot entreated the men of Sodome, Gen. 19. 8. that they would not abuſe the Angels of God, ſeeing they were come to ſhelter themſelves under the ſhadow of his r
                        •
                     ofe; ſo let me entreate you all in the name of Chriſt, that you would not abuſe the graces of God, ſeeing they are come from heaven to take ſhelter and harbour in your breſts and boſomes. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſome (Iud. 4.) that turne the grace of God into wantonneſſe; and that's a woefull kinde of Alchymie (as one ſaith ſingularly well) would we not eſteeme that man prodigally fooliſh and mad, that would ſpend all his time, all his ſubſtance, and all his induſtry to finde out a perverſe Philoſophers ſtone, that ſhould turne all the gold it touched into lead and droſſe: even ſuch are they that pervert the grace of God, and turne it into wantonneſſe, into laſciviouſnes, into all manner of ſcurrility and deboiſtneſſe, and never lin, till they have made a poyſon of an Antidote, and baned themſelves with that which would have beene their bliſſe, lucerna dei in ſpiritu hominis (ſaith Salomon, Pro. 20. 27.) The ſpirit of a man is the candle of the Lord; it implyes, that a man naturally walkes in darkeneſſe, which is full of error, and full ofterrour, till God in mercy ſet up a candle in his ſoule,

(I meane) endues him with knowledge and grace from heaven, that hee may ſhew him the path of life, and to avoyd the ſnares of death.
                  Now you know, that a candle naturally burnes upwards, if you take it and turne it the wrong way, and hold it downewards, is dyes and goes out alone, ſo fares it with 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      Graces and gifts of God, as Witt and Wiſedome, Knowledge and Learning, and all theſe are the candles of the Lord, and are purpoſely given us to light us up to heavenward; but if wee take Gods candles and hold them downeward, turne them the wrong way, and apply and abuſe them to ſinne; it is much to bee feared, the light of God will goe out, and thou ſhalt be left at the length in a place of utter darkeneſſe. Therefore as thou tendereſt the favour and goodwill of God, and the eternall welfare of thy owne ſoule, deale not with the graces of God, as Iehu dealt with Iehorams meſſengers 2. Reg. 9. doe not turne them behind thee, and make them ſerve againſt their owne maſters; but remember that if the ſonnes of Iacob would not endure to have their ſiſter abuſed (Gen. 24. vlt.) how doſt thou thinke thy God will endure to have his grace abuſed, and to be proſtituted to every ſinne: In a word, as Ruben ſaid to his diſtreſſed brethren, (Gen. 42. 22.) did not I ſpeake unto you ſaying, Sinne againſt the child, and ye would not heare? Oh be not you like them, monitoribus aſperi, ſo carleſſe and regardleſſe of divine admonition; but remember that you have beene ſpoken unto, that you have beene warned of God not to ſinne againſt your owne ſoules in this

too common kinde, but if the Lord have betruſted you with his grace, labour to cheriſh it, and (as the Apoſtles word is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      2. Tim. 1. 6.) to blow it or ſtirre it up, as we doe a dying fire, to kindle and quicken it by the uſe of good meanes, but in any caſe, ne abutaris, abuſe it not.
                  5. Laſtly, ſeeing thou haſt to doe with the grace and favour of God, ne diffides, doe not diſtruſt it, doe not make any doubt or queſtion of it but it will beſtead thee, and befriend thee, and be firme and ſure unto thee at any time of need. It is the Apoſtles owne advertiſement. 1. Pet. 1. 13. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , truſt perfectly on the grace that is revealed and brought into the world by Ieſus Chriſt. It is a thing that a man may leane his whole weight upon, and venture his whole eſtate upon, and paune his life and ſoule upon, the certainety, the truth, and the infallibility of Gods heavenly grace to all that make their peace, and put their truſt in him. Feare not Mary (ſaid the bleſſed Angel to the bleſſed Virgin) for thou haſt found favour with God: as if he had ſaid, Let them feare that are out of Gods favour, let them be diſtruſtfull that are wicked and deceitfull, that make no conſcience of their waies, but live in the diſpleaſure of an angry God; paveant illi, let them feare; but noli tu, feare not thou, be thou ſtead faſt &amp; unmoveable in thy affiance to God, for why? Invenisti gratiam, thou haſt found favour with him, in whoſe favour is life, and whoſe grace will bee thy guid unto the day of death. In a word then, (to cloſe up this point) As I ſaid before, ſo I ſay it over againe, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , gird up the loyues of your

mindes, and truſt perfectly to the Grace of God; doe it not in any wavering, or timerous, or unconfident manner▪ as if God were like the Poets

                        enedos; Stat
                           •
                        o maleſida carinis, a truſtles Anchor-hold to the ſeabeaten travailer; or like thoſe deceitfull Iewes, (Ioh. 
                     
                        •
                     . 24.) to whom our Saviour durſt not commit himſelfe, though they ſeemed to beleeve in his name. Oh let not thy heart entertaine the leaſt ſuſpition the leaſt jealouſie of the faithfulneſſe and fidelity of thy God; but try him by thy prayers, and truſt him by thy faith, and urge him with this Text that now is preached unto thee, (as S. Auſtin ſaith his mother Monica did Chyrographa tua ingerebat tibi, Lord (ſaith he) ſhee urged thee with thy owne hand-writing) tell him but how hard the world goes with thee, and then ſay ere God have done with thee if thou doſt not finde his Grace to be ſufficient for thee. And ſo I am come in the third place to ſhew you the efficacy and vertue of the Grace of God, how and wherein the ſufficiency thereof doth conſiſt, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (ſaith the Text) My Grace is ſufficient.
                  
                  The principall things whereunto the Grace of God (and beſides Gods Grace, nothing elſe under heaven) is available or ſufficient, are theſe that follow.
                  1. Ad Condonandum, to pardon and forgive us all our ſinnes, which would bee the bane and deſtruction of all our ſoules. Grande est barathrum peccatorum meorum (ſaith a Father) ſed maior eſt Abyſſus miſericordiae dei: Great is the gulfe and whirlepoole of my ſinnes, but greater and deeper

is the bottomleſſe ſea of Gods Grace and mercy: ſee that place, Rom. 5. 20. where ſinne abounded, Grace did much more abound: Haſt thou abundance of ſinnes, let not that diſharten thee, God hath abundance of Grace; if thy ſinnes be great, his Grace is greater than thy ſinnes, and farre more ſufficient to juſtifie, than all thy ſinnes are to condemne thy ſoule. Onely ne deſis, be not thou wanting to God in thy prayers and repentance, and his Grace ſhall never bee wanting to thee in thy pardon and forgiveneſſe. What a golden ſentence is that of S. Chryſoſtome, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ; Thou doſt not, thou canſt not ſo much deſire to have thy ſinnes forgiven thee, as God doth deſire to forgive thy ſinnes unto thee. I forgave thee all thy debt, becauſe thou deſiredst me, (ſaid that gracious Lord to his ungracious ſervant, Mat. 18. 32.) intimating unto us, that if God doe not forgive us ous debts, if he doe not pardon and remit our ſinnes; we may thanke our ſelves, the fault is our owne, becauſe wee doe not deſire him, for if we deſired him, he would doe it. In a word then, As our Saviour asked the 
                        •
                     riple, Iohn 5. 6. Wilt thou be made whole? ſo, wilt thou bee made holy and cleane, and fit for abſolution from God? doſt thou deſire in ſincerity and truth to have thy ſinnes remitted, and thy ſoule abſolved by the blood and death of Ieſus Chriſt? to have all thy miſdeeds expunged and blotted out, that they may be as if they had nev
                        ••
                      beene? Then take the Prophet Eſaies counſell (Eſay 43. 25, 26.) put God in remembrance of theſe things: (it is a pregnant place,

I pray reade it and remember it) I even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſsions for mine owne ſake, and will not remember thy ſinnes: (theres a gratious promiſe; but marke the condition in the next immediate words) put me in remembrance (ſaith God) and I will doe it, and not otherwiſe: for though God remember all our ſinnes, and can tell them better than our owne ſoules; yet he doth not remember them to our comfort, but rather to our confuſion, unleſſe we tell him and put him in remembrance of them: ſo that the onely way to put our ſinnes out of Gods remembrance, is to put them into his remembrance; the onely way to make God forget them is daily and hourely to declare them and put him in minde of them. If therefore thou canſt not be ſo good as thou wouldſt, be not aſhamed, be not afraid to tell God how evill thou art; tell him how ungodly, how unthankefull, how unprofitable a ſervant thou haſt beene unto him, and deſire God to mend thee, and make thee ſuch a one as he would have thee: And as Ioſeph of Arimathea went to Pilate and begged the body of Ieſus; ſo goe thou to God and begge the Spirit of Ieſus; even that ſpirit of Grace and Supplication (which the Prophet ſpeakes of, Zach. 12. 10.) which will come downe from heaven and bring into thy ſoule, firſt Supplications to prepare thee; ſecondly, Grace to aſſure thee of the free and full forgiveneſſe of all thy ſinnes: And then let thy ſinnes bee what they will be, ſinnes of death, ſinnes of blood, ſinnes of hell; if thou canſt finde in thy heart to pray, God will finde in his heart to pardon, for his Grace is
                     
                     ſufficient to doe it. Thats the firſt.
                  2. The ſecond thing whereto the ſufficiency of Gods Grace doth belong, is Adconſolandum to comfort thoſe ſad and heavy hearts that can no other way bee comforted. I ſhould have fainted (ſaith David, Pſal. 27. 13.) for all my worldly comforts, but that I ſteadfaſtly beleeved, to ſee the Lords good grace in the land of living, (that is) to ſee it before he dyed; therefore we reade 1. Sam. 30. 6. when he was in great diſtreſſe, had neither houſe nor home to ſhelter him, neither wife, nor child, nor friend be any to comfort to him, but his owne very ſouldiers began to takle of ſtoning him; Then (ſaith the text) David comforted himſelfe in the Lord his God. Heare this thou poore diſconſolate man, that art (as thy Saviour was ſaid to be) 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     ſad round about; thou that lookeſt into thy purſe, and there is no comfort, money is gone; that lookeſt into thy cubbord and there is no comfort, proviſion is gone; that lookeſt into thy barne and ſtore-houſe, and there's no comfort, corne and wares are gone; that lookeſt in thy heart, and ther's no comfort, cheerefulneſſe and joy is gone: Then looke up to God, and there is comfort to bee had; if there bee any water, it is in the ſea; if there bee any light, it is in the ſunne; if there be any comfort, it is in God. Therefore the Apoſtle juſtly calleth him, The God of all conſolation, 2. Cor. 1. becauſe when all other comforts faile, theres's comfort to bee found in God. For beleeve this for a truth, there is no mans caſe, no mans eſtate, no mans ſoule is deſperate to God; but when they are at the loweſt ebbe, at the

reſt ſtay, at the moſt forlorne hope; then doth God ſpeake peace unto their ſoules, then doth hee draw out thoſe ſame vbera conſolationes, thoſe breaſts or dugges of conſolation (which the Prophet ſpeakes of, Eſay 66. 11.) and drops downe that ſame 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      that ſincere milke of heavenly comfort, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to give life to them that are of a contrite heart. The Hebrewes obſerve that one and the ſame word (nakam) ſignifieth, firſt to repent, and then to comfort; and it may bee well applyed to this purpoſe: that true comfort belongs to none but ſuch are truly penitent: So our Saviour tells us that the holy Ghoſt whom he calles the comforter when he commeth, the firſt thing he will doe, is to convince the world of ſinne; that is, firſt put men quite out of comfort in themſelves, then put them into comfort by their Saviour. In a word then, foraſmuch as comfort cannot be had without repentance, nor repentance bee endured without comfort, nor either of theſe bee attained without God; it remaines, that as the daughter of Caleb beſought her earthly father (Iud. 1.) ſo we beſeech our heavenly Father, to give us the ſprings above, as well as the ſprings beneath; I meane, that Irriguum ſuperius, the ſpring of grace &amp; comfort from above, as well as that Irriguum inſerius, the ſpring of ſorrow and repentance from beneath: and then let our diſcomforts and diſcontents be what they will, wee ſhall have grace ſufficient from God to countervaile them al, and as Philip ſaid to our Saviour, Iohn 14. 8. Lord ſhew us the father and it ſufficeth us; ſo though our ſinnes confound

us, and our conſciences condemne us, Lord ſhew u
                           •
                        
                      thy favour, as tis ſufficient for us.
                  3. The third is Ad ſanandum, His Grace is ſufficient to cure and heale us of all thoſe 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      thoſe bodily ailements and infirmities which God for ſinne doth inflict upon us, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      from thoſe ſcourges and roddes (as the holy Ghoſt termeth ſore diſeaſes, Luc. 7. 21.) for indeed they are the very rods which God uſeth to chaſten and correct us for our follies: I ſay, there is no rod ſo ſharpe, no diſeaſe ſo ſore, but Gods Grace is ſufficient to heale it and to take it off. I am Ropeca (ſaith God Exod. 15. penult.) I am thy Phyſitian, or I am the Lord that healeth thee: and if God be the Phiſitian, his Grace is the Phyſicke, for whoſoever be the inſtrument of our health, God is the Authour, his Grace is it that doth the cure. Therefore in common ſpeech, when any outward malady doth befall us, whereof we know no ſecond cauſe; wee uſe to ſay (and we ſay well) that it came by the Grace of God: now if thou beleeveſt that it came by Gods Grace, beleeve this alſo that by the ſame Grace it ſhall (in Gods good time) be remedied, and removed and done away, for (as S. Iames ſaith in another caſe) God giveth 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Cap. 4. 6. He giveth more grace, and ſheweth more favour, to heale thoſe that are ſicke and broken in heart, than to breake their hearts, with ſickeneſſe that were well and whole; both are from the ſame Grace, but the one more eſpecially the other.
                  But then the maine point for ſatisfaction will be this: ſeeing it is in the power of Gods Grace to

cure all infirmities, and that in a moment, with a word-ſpeaking, (as the Centurion ſaid, Speake but the word, and my ſervant ſhall be whole.) Why will God ſuffer ſo many of his owne Patients, that have no Phyſitian but himſelfe, to lye languiſhing ſo long under his owne hand, and ſeeme to take no notice of their miſeies? The beſt anſwere I can give, is that of our Saviour to his Mother, Iohn 2. 4. Nondum venit hora, My houre is not yet come; for you muſt conceive there are two kindes of houres; wee have our houre, and God hath his Houre. As ſoone as wee begin to ſicken, that wee feele but any paine, or finde the want of any eaſe; then is our houre to be healed, then doe wee cry out, as tis fit we ſhould, Have mercy upon mee, O Lord, for I am weake, Lord heale me for my bones are vexed, Pſal. 6. 2. But God hath another houre, and that you ſhall finde, 2 Chron. 7. 14. When my people humble themſelves, and pray and ſeeke my face, and turne from their wicked wayes, (that is, when they are bettered and amended by my afflictions) Then (ſaith God) will I heare in Heaven, and have mercy upon them, and heale their Land. God complaines of that people in many places, that their hearts were waxen fat, that they would not ſee with their eyes, nor heare with their eares, nor underſtand with their hearts, ne convertantur ut ſanem, Mat. 13. 15. leſt they ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heale them. So that the time of our converſion is Gods healingtime; Firſt, labour to be converted, and then looke to be healed, and not before. So Acts 3. 19. Repent and be converted, that your ſinnes may bee blotted out,
                     
and then (and never till then) looke for a Tempus refrigerij, a time of refreſhing from the preſence of the Lord. We read, Numb. 12. 14. When Myriam was ſtrucken with leproſie, Moſes was importunate with God to heale preſently out of hand; Heale her now O Lord, I beſeech thee; Heale her now. No (ſaith God) I will not heale her yet, ſhee ſhall ſtay the time that I have determined upon her, for if her Father had but ſpit in her face, ſhould ſhe not have beene aſhamed and kept in for ſeven dayes, &amp;c. So perſwade your ſelves of this, that there is a 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      an appointed time that God hath ſet downe with himſelfe in heaven, when and wherein his mercy ſhall appeare on earth for our recovery; and till that time we muſt wait, (as David ſaith, Pſal. 123. 2. As the eyes of a ſervant wait on the hand of their maſters, and the eyes of a mayden on the hand of her miſtreſſe, ſo doe our eyes waite upon the Lord our God, untill that he have mercy upon us. Marke that ſame donec miſereatur, untill hee have mercy: that is, though God ſhew thee not mercy, this day, nor to morrow, nor the next day, may be, not till a long time after; yet, let not thy heart be diſmayed, but let thy ſoule truely wait upon God, untill hee ſhew thee mercy, let him ſhew it when he will. In the meane time know, thou art under the hands of a wiſe and gracious God, who meaſures every dram ofſorrow that thou feeleſt, who will not only be about thy bed, but will ever make all thy bed in thy ſickneſſe, and will ſo eſtabliſh and under-prop thee with his Grace; that though thy body lye in paine, thy ſoule ſhall lye at eaſe; though thy outward

man conſume and melt away for very heavineſſe, yet that ſame Interior cordis homo, (as Saint Peter ſpeakes) the inner man of thy heart ſhall bee ſo ſtrengthened with might, and armed with patience, and guarded with peace, that neither paines of death, nor the powers of Hell ſhall ever be able to prevaile againſt thee. In a word, if ever it ſhall pleaſe God to caſt thee downe upon that ſame Lectum languoris, that bed of languiſhing, which David ſpeakes of, Pſal. 41. 4. (for that wee all muſt make account of) though we now lie and laze upon our beds, the time may come that wee ſhall lie and languiſh on our beds, wiſhing (as they did in Deuteronomy,) when tis morning, would God it were evening, and when tis evening, would God it were morning. If ever ſuch a dolefull time ſhould happen to thee, I pray God of his mercy looke graciouſly upon thee, and ſay unto thy bleeding ſoule, as he did once to that forlorne Infant, Ezech. 16. 6. Dixi in ſanguinibus, &amp;c. when thou waſt in thy blood, I ſaid unto thee, live; yea, I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy blood, live; If God doe but ſay thou ſhalt live, though thou wert in thy blood, though thou wert in thy grave, his word ſhall fetch thee, for his Grace (if it ſtand with his glory) is ſufficient to heale thee.
                  4. The laſt and chiefeſt thing whereunto the Grace of God, and nothing elſe but Gods Grace, is ſufficient, is Ad ſalvandum, to ſave the ſoule of every one that hath it. The Apoſtle calls it, The Grace that bringeth ſalvation, (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Tit. 2. 11.) for as the wickedneſſe of man bringeth deſtruction,

ſo the Grace of God bringeth ſalvation to every ſoule that entertaines it. Saint Paul is direct, Epheſ. 2. 5. By Grace yee are ſaved; whether it be meant of the Grace of God within us, which our Saviour compares to Salt, Marke 9. 50. (Habete ſalem in vobis, &amp;c. have Salt in your ſelves, and peace with one another) becauſe as ſalt preſerves the fleſh, ſo doth Grace preſerve the ſpirit from corruption and rottenneſſe in ſinne: or whether it be meant of the Grace of God that is over and above us, I meane, his favour and loving kindneſſe which lightneth upon us from Heaven; (as we pray in our Liturgie, let thy mercy lighten upon us, as our truſt is in thee,) Take it either way, it holds good and true; for by the one we are prepared for ſalvation, by the other ſalvation is prepared for us; the Grace of God within us prepares us for ſalvation; the Grace of God over us prepares ſalvation for us: ſo both wayes tis our happineſſe, By Grace to bee ſaved. It was Gods mercifull promiſe, Deut. 11. 12. Mine eyes ſhall be upon this Land from the beginning of the yeare, to the end thereof; ſuch is Gods goodneſſe where hee beſtowes his Grace, ſuch a care hath God of their ſoules, that his eye is upon them from the beginning of their converſion, to the end of their ſalvation: and as his eye is upon them to watch over them, ſo his hand is with them to con
                        •
                     uct them in the right way of pleaſing God, and of ſaving their own ſoules, Deut. 33. 3. All his Saints are in thy hand: as a Father leads his childe, ſo doth God lead his Saints by his Grace, and by his good Spirit, from

all things prejudiciall, to all things profitable, to his ſervice and their owne ſalvation. (To conclude this point) becauſe (as the Schoolemen ſay well) Ad ſingulos actus deſideratur Gratia, a man hath need of Grace to every action that hee takes in hand, and that he can doe nothing well without it; let us all deſire of God (as it is in the Collect) That his ſpeciall Grace may ever more prevent and follow us, firſt, that God would prevent us with his Grace, to put into our hearts good motions, good thoughts, and good deſires; and ſecondly, that it may follow us too, (as the water of the Rocke followed the Campe of the Iſraelites to the Land of Promiſe, 1 Cor. 10. 4.) ſo that Gods Grace may follow, accompany and goe along with us in this world; and never leave us, never forſake us till it hath brought us to the end of our Faith, which is the ſalvation of our ſoules, according to that, Pſal. 109. ult. Dominus ad dextram, &amp;c. the Lord is at the right hand of the poore, to ſave him from all them that would condemne his ſoule, where note that he doth not ſay, the Lord is at their left hand (which is as I may terme it) the lazy hand, to ſave men in their negligent and idle courſes. But hee is at their right hand (which is the working hand) to ſave all them that worke for their ſalvation, and carefully uſe the meanes to ſave themſelves: which thing if thou make a conſcience to doe, though thy ſinnes and thy enemies ſhould conſpire to condemne thee. Thy God and his Grace will be ſufficient to ſave thee.
                  And ſo at length, I am come aboard the laſt and

long-deſired part of my text, which containes the application of all in particular, which hath beene ſpoken and delivered in generall; drawne out of the word (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ) My Grace is ſufficient for thee, ſo that, as it is ſaid of our Saviour, Mat. 21. 45. that his doctrine was ſo punctuall, and clapt ſo cloſe to the conſciences of his Auditors, that the Phariſes knew he meant them. ſo by that time I have done with my text, (neither will I bee long in doing it) I truſt you ſhall perceive that Gods meaning was to you, when hee ſpake to Saint Paul, and told him that His Grace is ſufficient for him.
                  
                  Briefly than, ſee what Paul was, and ſay what thou art; if your caſe bee the ſame, your comfort is the ſame; for God is no accepter of perſons, his Grace is as ſufficient for the one, as for the other.
                  1. Saint Paul was Homo in Chriſto, he was a man in Chriſt, as you may ſee by the ſecond verſe of this chapter (I knew a man in Chriſt, that was taken up into the third heaven:) Art thou ſuch a one? I meane, art thou regenerate and become a new creature? (for he that is in Chriſt is a new creature. 2. Cor. 5. 17) doſt thou daily renew thy repentance, and renew thy obedience, and renew thy duty and devotion to God? and is it a griefe to thy ſoule, that ſo much of the old leaven, thy old corruption remaines ſtill in thy heart? Then take this holy Scripture to thy comfort, and aſſure thy ſelfe, though thy conſcience diſquiet thee, Gods Grace will be ſufficient for thee: contrarily, if thou beeſt an old weather beaten ſinner, an old ruſty drunkard, ſwearer, and that ſtandeſt at a ſtay, and gathereſt

ſinne, like an old tree that ſtands and gathers moſſe; I muſt ſay unto thee (as Peter ſaid to Symon Magus, Act. 8.) thou haſt neyther part nor portion in this priviledge; thou art not a man in Chriſt and conſequently canſt claime no intereſt in the grace and favour of God.
                  2. Saint Paul was Homo in Cruce, a man upon the croſſe, Gal. 2. 20. I am crucified with Christ; and elſwhere, Coloſ. 1. 24. I fill up that which is behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt in my fleſh: whereupon (ſaith a father) quid deeſt pasſioni Chriſti, niſi u
                           •
                         nos ſimil
                           •
                        a patiamur, what is, or what can be wanting to the ſufferings of Chriſt, but that as he tooke up his croſſe, ſo we take up ours and follow him: for, vae portantibus crucem, &amp; non ſequentibus Chriſtum, woe to them that are crucified, &amp; not with Chriſt; that bare the croſſe▪ and follow not Chriſt, but turne from him cleane another way. It is well knowne that afflictions go under the name of croſſes; now a croſſe was a peece of wood for a malefectour to die on, there was no other uſe of a croſſe but that: Affliction therefore is called a croſſe, becauſe it ſhould have the nature and power of a Croſſe, that is, it ſhould be a meanes to crucifie and mortifie all carnall luſts and affections in us; that the more we are afflicted, the more we ſhould dye to ſin, and the leſſe life and power ſhould our corruptions have in us. Thus it was with Saint Paul, is it ſo with thee? doſt thou wiſh and deſire the death of thy ſinnes? doſt thou make this uſe of thy afflictions, even to die daily? (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) doſt thou every day drive one naile into the body

of ſinne, I meane one ſigh or grone to God againſt it? doſt thou labour to draw blood of thy ſoule (as they drew blood of thy Saviour) I meane, the teares of true repentance? and is it a death to thy heart, that thou canſt not die unto ſinne, and live unto God▪ as thou ſhouldeſt and oughteſt to doe? Then looke no further for Hartſ-eaſe, but to the words of my text, and aſſure thy ſelfe, what ever Croſſes be upon thee, Gods Grace (in Gods good time) ſhall bee ſufficient to eaſe thee. Contrariewiſe, if thou beeſt one that doſt 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      (as Saint Setphen ſpeaketh, Acts. 7. 
                        •
                     1.) one that doſt fall croſſe and contrary to all but to thy ſinnes, and art indeede a very croſſe to God himſelfe and to his good Spirit by thy perverſe, ungodly courſes, I muſt ſay unto thee, as the Prophet Eſay ſaith, Eſay. 3. 6. Woe bee unto thy ſoule, for thou hast rewarded evill unto thy ſelfe: thou forſakeſt thy owne mercy, and depriveſt thy ſelfe of the comfort of Gods grace in the time of neede.
                  3. Saint Paul was Homo in negotiis, a laborious man, a man full of imployments, 1. Cor. 15. 10. I laboured more then all my fellow Apoſtles (ſaith hee) yet not I, but the grace of God which was with mee. (there's an honeſt acknowledgement by whom he profited.) and elſewhere hee tells the Corinthians, 2. Cor. 11. 9. When I was with you and wanted, non obtorpui, I was not chargeable nor burthenſome to any man. The learned obſerve, that word hath his weight from Torpedo, which ſignifieth a Crampfiſh; a fiſh (they ſay) that hath ſuch a benumming quality, that the cold of it will ſtrike from the

hook to the lyne, from the line to the goad, from the goad to the arme, from the arme to the body of the fiſher, and ſo benum him, &amp; take away al uſe and feeling of his limmes: His meaning is, that he was none of thoſe idle drones, that by their lazineſſe and lewdneſſe doe even chill, and benumme, and dead the charity of well-diſpoſed people; but as he laboured in preaching, ſo hee wrought in his calling too, and put himſelfe to any paines, 
                        〈◊〉
                      then bee chargeable or burthenſome to any friend or ſtranger: and by this meanes it came to paſſe, that what he wanted at home, he found it abroad; and Gods grace that was with him did ever ſupply him with that which was enough and ſufficient for him. Is it ſo with thee? Thou that art a poore man, art thou alſo an induſtrious and a painefull man? that as Iacob got the bleſſing in the garment of Eſau, which ſignifieth, Working; ſo doſt thou worke and take paines to get the bleſſing of thy God? doſt thou labour with thy hands the thing that is good, that thou mayeſt rather bee charitable, then chargeable to him that needeth? and will not thy honeſt labour maintaine thee, nor ſuffice the charge that daily lies upon thee? Take comfort by this Text that now is taught thee, and let not thy wants nor thy neceſſities diſmay thee, for there is a God above that hath ſufficient for thee; contrarily, if thou beeſt one that live in pleaſure (as Saint Paul ſaith of that widow, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , ſhe was dead even while ſhe lived) one that ſpendeſt thy time in this world, no otherwiſe then that Leviathan doth in the ſea, onely by taking thy paſtime therein, or

like thoſe lyllies that our Saviour ſpeakes, that neither labour nor ſpain, but onely make a faire ſhew as long as it will hold: Then as Iehu ſaid to Ioram, What peace? ſo may I ſay to thee, What grace? or what favour canſt thou looke for at the hands of God.
                  4. Saint Paul was Homo in aerumnis, a man full of cares. I doe not meane of carnall or worldly cares, or ſuch as Martha's were, for the things of this life; for theſe he had caſt upon God, and had learned in whatſoever eſtate he was therewith to be Content; but I meane of ſpirituall, divine, religious cares for the health and welfare of the ſoule, ſuch as he commends in the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 7. 11. as being the firſt fruits of Grace and godly ſorrow (
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , What carefulneſse it hath wrought in you) how much it wrought in them, I know not; but ſure I am, it wrought in him a marvellous and a manifold care, and that of the better kinde: firſt, an immediate care for himſelfe, and his owne ſoule, leaſt after he had preached unto others, himſelfe ſhould be a caſt-away, 1 Cor. 9. 27. ſecondly, a charitable and that a Catholicke and univerſall care for all Churches &amp; Chriſtian ſoules under the cope of heaven. 2 Cor. 11. 28. Non aliter in eccleſias quantumvis remotas affectus, quam ſi illas humeris geſtaret (as Beza ſaid of Calvin) hee was no leſſe tenderly affected for thoſe Churches that were remote and far-off than if he had borne them upon his owne ſhoulders, and carried them (as nurſes doe their babes) in his owne boſome. But his third and moſt eſpeciall care was for the ſoules and ſaving health of his little
                     
                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
                     
                        〈1 page duplicate〉
                     
                     
                     children (as he calls them, Gal. 4. 20.) Of whom he traveiled in birth till Chriſt was formed in them. His care was greater for them, than either for himſelfe, or any others; and he gives his reaſon 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , for (ſaith he) I ſtand in doubt of you. Good Parents the more they love their children, the more they ſtand in doubt of them, leaſt they ſhould fall to any defection, or decline to any corruption, or come to any diſaſter when they themſelves are dead and gone. This made Saint Paul in ſuch perplexity for them; and yet were they but his ſpirituall children; what care then (may we thinke) would he have taken for them, if they had beene his naturall children too? then might he juſtly have uſed that word, and ſaid 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     I am in doubt of you: for 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      in Greeke ſignifieth both dubius and pauper, doubtfull and poore▪ for none have ſo much reaſon to be doubtfull of their childrens welfare as they that are pooreſt and have leaſt to leave them. They may juſtly feare (as the woman of Tekoah ſaid to David. 2. Sam. 14. 7.) leaſt their coales ſhould bee quenched: (for ſo ſhee calles her child her coale; for as coales either warme or burne, as they are uſed; ſo doe children either comfort or croſſe their parents as they prove) now when a poore man ſhall dye and leave his coales, I meane his Orphans behind him: ſuch is the world, that where you ſhall light of one good body that will bee a meanes to cheriſh and maintaine and keepe them alive; there be twenty to that one ſo unchriſtianly and uncharitably minded, that they care not how they uſe them, yea though they quench and

cruſh, and put them cleane out. And hence come thoſe 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      thoſe perplexities and doubtfull cares of tender-hearted parents for their children. Haſt thou therefore many little ones, and little to leave them? and doth thy heart even yearne with care and feare to fore-thinke what ſhall betide them, when thou by death art taken from them? I will give thee the ſame counſell that I deſire of God to take my ſelfe, and thats this. Cognoviſti Gratiam Dei, (ſaith our Apoſtle, Coloſ. 1. 6.) Thou knoweſt the Grace of God: thou knoweſt that to bee a ſure ſtay when all other props and ſtayes are done away: That Anchor will hold when all other tackling breakes: Make tryall of that:
                  Doe by thy Children as Saint Paul did by his brethren, Acts 20. 32. Commend them to God, and to the word of his Grace; Lay them downe at the feet of Ieſus Chriſt, as they in the Primitive Church, laid downe their money at the feet of the Apoſtles; deſire God to bee their Father, Chriſt to be their Guardian, the Holy Ghoſt to bee their Guide; and when thou haſt don
                        •
                      ſo, then as David ſaith, Pſal. 116. 7. Revertere ad requiem, Returne unto thy reſt, O my ſoule, then ſettle and aſſure and reſolve thy ſelfe, that Heaven ſhall want mercy, and earth meanes, before any of thoſe that are under Gods protection and patronage ſhall want maintenance. Never bee in doubt what ſhall become of them, knowing that His Grace is ſufficient for them.
                  
                  I might adde hereunto many particulars; as that Saint Paul was homo in vinculis, a man in bonds, but

the grace of God unlooſed them all: that he was Homo in neceſsitatibus, a man in wants, but the Grace of God ſupplyed them all: that he was Homo in periculis, a man in many perills and dangers, but by the Grace of God he eſcaped them all: that he was Homo in tentationibus, a man mightily troubled with temptations, but by the Grace of God he overcame them al: All theſe I purpoſely overſlip (which perhaps might comply with many a mans condition, and conduce to his comfort) but there is one behind that is of greater value than all the reſt, that S. Paul was (as I pray God of his mercy make me and thee, and every Chriſtian ſoule to be.
                  5. Homo in Caeleſtibus, a man of an Heavenly diſpoſition; though his bodily abode was upon earth, yet his 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , his ſoules commerce, and converſation was in heaven, Phil. 3. 20. no marvell then, that being ſo much acquainted with God, as hee was; and ſo converſant in heaven, which is Gremium Gratiae, the lap and boſome of Grace; if, as tis ſaid of Saint Iohn that leaning in the boſome of Chriſt, he thence ſuckt out his heavenly knowledge; ſo S. Paul being ſo intimate, and ſo entire with God who is the God of all Grace (whatever elſe hee wanted) could not poſſibly want Grace ſufficient for him. In a word then: Is it ſo with thee though in a farre inferiour degree? Art thou, as every good Chriſtian is, and ought to be 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a Citizen of heaven? doſt thou account that thy home, and this but the place of thy pilgrimage for a time? and as our Saviour ſet his face to goe to Ieruſalem, Luke 9. 51. doſt thou ſet thy face to goe to

heaven? doth thy heart ſtand heaven-ward? art thou bound for that coaſt? (as Paul went bound in the ſpirit to Ieruſalem, Acts 20.) I meane, doſt thou ſet thy affections upon things above, upon God and his Grace? and not on things below, upon the world and her goods which drowne mens ſoules in perdition? Art thou one of that ſame Generis Aquilini, of that Eagle kinde whereof our Saviour ſpeakes, Mat. 24. (where the body is, thither will the Eagles reſort) the body of thy Saviour thou knoweſt is in heaven, and doth thy ſoule reſort often thither? doſt thou wiſh (as Macarius did) 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that thy ſoule might goe up into heaven with thy prayers, and there abide for ever with God? Then, what Nathan ſaid to David in a caſe of conviction, I dare apply to thee in a caſe of comfort; Thou art the man whom God delighteth to favour: and therefore as the Patriachs are ſayd Heb. 11. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      even to kiſſe and embrace the promiſes of Chriſt: ſo doe thou even claſpe and hugge this promiſe of Grace to thy ſelfe; and let neither thy wants, nor thy weakneſſes diſmay thee, for both in life and death thou ſhalt finde Gods Grace to be ſufficient for thee, which God of his mercy grant unto us all, &amp;c.
                  Amen.
                  FINIS.
