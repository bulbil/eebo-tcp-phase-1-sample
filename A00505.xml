            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

               COnſidering how the body of the Chriſtian

                  •

all in generall to the pillage and purl
                  •
               yning of others. For remedie
whereof, a number of good ſpirits pricked forward with
a Chriſtian and laudable zeale, haue indeuored their beſt, theſe
fiftie yeares, to root out the maladie by ſuch medicines as they
ſuppoſe moſt conuenient and wholſome, yet doe they all what
they could: they could neuer heale the wound perfectly. So that
the bodie diſeaſed, falleth downe ſtill oftentimes into far worſe
caſe then at the firſt, and me thinke the cauſe is, for that they
haue not looked with tbe eie of their vnderſtanding, to the firſt
cauſes and beginnings, from whence this ſicknes ſhould grow,
but went no further then to ſtop the courſe of her effects, like

the Phiſition, who ſeeketh to cure onely the paines &amp; accidents
of a diſeaſe, neuer touching the root &amp; cauſe therof: the which
in ſpace of time, recouering newe force and rigour doth bud againe,
and is as bad &amp; worſe then euer it was, which is not onlie
true in Phiſicke, but in all other affairs of the world. Wherfore,
deepe was the iudgement of the Latine Poet: who reputeth
that man happy who can knowe the cauſe of thinges.
For Ariſtotle alſo witneſſeth with him, that the ignorance
thereof breedeth manifolde errors. Seeing then the diuerſitie
of mens iudgements concerning the cauſe and curing
of this maladie, comming nothing neere the truth; ſome becauſe
they were a muſter of ignorance, which dimmeth ſo their
ſight, that they cannot ſee well: others, becauſe they ſuffer thē
               ſelues
to be caried away with their own paſsion; affectionat only
to ſome one particular partie: &amp; other ſome, becauſe they go no
further, but to remedie onely ſome particular effects, and leaue
the cauſe vntouched: I haue thought good pitiyng this languiſhing
and ſick bodie, ſo to repreſent and liuely ſet down the cauſe
and cure of this diſeaſe, that it ſhalbe long of her ſelfe, if ſhe recouer
not perfect health. Neither let any be afraid to take this
wholſome medicine which I wil preſcribe, being no violent corſuie,
or Antimoyne, nor deare as is the tincture of Sol, for I
preſent but a ſweet decoction, to purifie the crooked ſinew, gouernor
of the ſight of the vnderſtanding, to purge the Septentrionall
and Occidentall peoples of a groſſe humour ingendred
in them, by reaſon of the groſnes, and coldnes of the aier wherin
they liue, which letteth them for ſeeing ſo clearly into matters
of ſtate, and the gouernment of this world, as doe the nations
that are more Meridionall who being aware of ſo great aduantage
can ſo cunningly handle the matter, to make vs fall
togeather by the eares, to weaken and ouer-throwe our ſelues by
our owne forces and armes, thereby to make v
                  •
                their ſlaues, to
poſſeſſe and nicye our perſons, and to triumph ouer v
                  •
               , hauing

purloyned our domination &amp; riches into their own hands: but
eſpecially thoſe, who haue the Sea ſo neare their noſes, that they
can euery way trade and trafficke with other peoples, as are the
Grecians, Carthaginians, Florentins, Venetians, &amp; other Italians
their like: who if they may diſcouer but the leaſt entrance
to ſet in foot amongſt the Septentrionals, they will ſtraight be able
to deuiſe and practiſe ſo great ſhifts and ſubtilties, that they
wil make them breake aſunder all bonds of amity, and fleſh them
to ruine one another like cruell and ſauage beaſts, cauſing an alteration
of bloud amongst the beſt of the Countrey by their mariages,
and ſo to grow to make quarels and take parts, when they
ſee them feeble and in miſerie, and then to fiſh for their riches
and dignities, euen as in a troubled water, men catch and kil fiſh
beſt, when they cannot be diſcried. Wherefore, many of thoſe
whome the heauen hath inriched with a clearnes of iudgement
aboue the reſt, haue great need to be aided herein. Some
attributing the ſpring of theſe miſchiefes, to the darknes and
obſcuritie of the holy Scriptures, wherein for all that they are
deceiued, ſeeing that it in ſome requireth of vs, but to loue God
and our neighbour, to fly from euill, and to doe good. And becauſe
the corruption of man doth hinder him to beleeue in him
who hath abſolutely fulfilled all, and ſhed his bloud for the purging
of all our ſinnes, vſing only certaine Sacraments after the
holy inſtitution of him and his holy Apoſtles: ſome others think
that the diuerſe interpretations there abouts, and about other
texts of Scripture, are the cauſe of all this miſchiefe, and are of
opinion, that to interprete and expound truely theſe places and
paſſages of Scriptures, is the very beſt meane and remedy to
deliuer all Chriſtendome from all theſe troubles: and thereuppon
do the Diuines fall out, and backbite one another by contumelious
ſpeaches, euery where defaming one another ſhamefully:
but the expoſitions that they condemne, and wherupon they
are ſo at variance, are but thrids ſpun by ſome of the more meridionall

nations: who when they perceiue how they can ſet vs
together by the ears, they know how to inuent ſtore of ſuch new
obſcurities and ſhifts to trouble vs, if we will giue them leaue a
little to come in amongſt vs into our Countries: where they
will ſhew themſelues alwais with prophane knowledge to teach
vs how we ſhall goe to heauen, or els inflamed with a burning
zeale for the publi

               ke good of all our Countrey. Although if
we be ſo wiſe as to looke well into them, we ſhall ſoone diſcouer
their mines, how they doe but ſeeke to reape ſome profite out of
our ruines, and to make their hand by vs. We muſt then caſt
our eies vpon the good inſtruction, that nature or rather the
Authour therof doth ſet before vs viſibly: For he hauing laid
and ſet the Alpes moſt high mountaines, ſo firme and permanant
on the one ſide, and the deepe Seas on the other, for bars
betweene vs and them, that we ſhould not go to one another,
teacheth vs, if we will take his inſtruction, we ſhould diſpoſe of
all that concerneth our State, apart: and ſhut vp from them al
acceſſe or entrance into our Countrey by the reaſons and experience
of things already paſt, which ſhall more amply be dilated

whether we be Catholiques or Proteſtants, to recouer full deliuerance
and health of theſe maladies, which ſo long time haue
oppreſſed and troubled vs: hoping by the grace and bleſ
                  •
               ing of
the moſt higheſt, it ſhall worke ſome great effects in thoſe, who
ſhall vſe theſe preparatiues, which are firſt of all preſented vnto
them, before the taking of more ſtrong medicines, and harder
phiſicke. Now, for that the gouernour of the whole world, ſeemeth
to haue turned his fauourable countenance towardes vs,
hauing giuen the royall Scepter into your Maieſties hands, being
extracted out of a more Meridionall quarter then your predeceſſours
were, and alſo in giuing vs, who are neighbours of
the great Ocean-ſea, a wiſer and more ingenious King, then
thoſe before time haue bene: to the end that we being lightned

by ſo bright and glorious a ſtarre, the quicke and ſubtill Italians
may no more abuſe vs, ſo that we ſhall no more bee expoſed
to the lamentable miſeries, into the which they were woont to
bring vs headlong, as men altogether blind andegroſſe-headded,
at their owne luſt and pleaſure. And this is the cauſe why
I haue preſumed to dedicate this diſcourſe vnto your M. hoping
that it ſhalbe rather liked and approoued of you, then of others,
who being more Septentrionals haue their ſpirites more
dull and nothing ſo quicke and pliable, aſſuring alſo my ſelfe,
that if it pleaſe you to receiue it with a fauorable countenance,
that onely ſhall giue it a far more free paſſage to all thoſe, who
are your moſt affectionate ſeruants: Now, I will pray the ſoueraigne
Lord and God to inuirone your M. with his ſpeciall
protection in the middeſt of all the perils and daungers wherewith
you are beſieged, eſtabliſhing your throwne in all
iuſtice and godlines, according to his moſt holie
will and pleaſure.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            A diſcription of Italie, and the cauſes of the
ſubtilitie of that Nation.
Cap. 1.
            
               THe Italians inhabite the right arme
of the continent of Europe, which
hath Spaine in place of the head,
France for the ſtomacke, for the belly
Germany, and Denmarke for the
left arme: From that part of Italie
which extendeth more to the Southward,
and from the other bounding
North, with his two armes, which are parts of the maine, entring
further into the Sea then the reſt of the bodie, haue from
all times the other principall partes of Chriſtendome, ſuſtained
great ruines, cruelties, loſſe of goods and other oppreſſions: of
the firſt, becauſe it goeth farre beyond all Nations bordering
Northward, in inuention, craft and worldly pollicie, witneſſe
Ariſtotle, Strabo, Caeſar, Plinie, &amp; other approoued Authors:
of the ſecond, in reſpect of their ſurpaſſing ſtreight and corporall
puiſſance, by reaſon of the colde ſituation of the place. That
which produceth ſuch effects in Italie, is the moderate temperature
of the clymate, ſituate in a ſubtill ayre néere vnto the
ſea euery where, without any exceſſe heate or cold: and beſide,
another cauſe is, the trading and great dealing that the Italians
haue with the people of Aſia, of Affrica, and Europa, as
alſo with the Ilanders, or a great part of them with whome
they haunt, and liue. By reaſon whereof, beſides that they are
of themſelues verie wittie &amp; ſubtill headed, all cunning ſlightes,
craftie conueyances, and deceitfull coſinages, are ſo proper and
common to them, whereby they can fetch vnder other people,
and are ſo cunning to finger from them their money, and can
moreouer, ſo cloſely couer their actiōs, that of a thouſand hardly
one could euer come within them to perceiue their iugling.
For as any deceit or coſinage finely handled, is not perceiued
but of thoſe which know it, and looke verie néere vnto it, deceiuing
thoſe which haue their eye but on the naturall and externall

ſhew: ſo there are none but thoſe which curiouſly ſéeke out
the beginning, the progreſſe and aduancements of the Romane
and Italian gouernment, and the meanes whereby they haue
drawne money from other nations of the earth, ſince the time
of Romulus, to this preſent day, who can finde out their fetches
and ſhifts, or diſcouer the maſkes wherewith they are diſguiſed,
to aduance and enrich themſelues by the ouerthrow and
pillage of others. Albeit, it is not inough when we haue gone
ſo farre, if beſides we throw not away the mufflers which depriue
vs of ſounde and true iudgement in things of this world,
as are cuſtome, hate, loue, obſtinacie, and enuy, which are euen
ſo many plagues &amp; corruptions, ouerthrowing quite the iudgement
and cleare vnderſtanding of man in all things: for if cuſtome
carry vs away, the Italian may preuaile, not only of
an hundred, but of more then a thouſand &amp; fiue hundred yéeres,
which was the verie time that Iulius Caeſar an Italian, pillaged
and ruined, not only France, but alſo all other parts of Europe.
Therefore we ſhould deſerue to be commanded and gnawen
to the bare bone, for euer hereafter, as wel as in time paſt,
that could looke to theſe matters no ſooner. The cauſe of all,
haue béen but our blinde affections which peruert vs in true
iudgement, the which now we muſt néedes cut off, to haue only
reaſon for our guide, which is the true &amp; eſſentiall difference,
that ſeparateth man from other Animals, &amp; maketh him iudge
truly of all things: otherwiſe wee robbe our ſelues of the moſt
excellent and precious iewell we haue, to become as beſtiall as
the bruit beaſtes. From hence ſpringeth then alſo the cauſe of
ſo great diuerſitie of opinions in our Continent, the principall
and chiefeſt part of the world, for that ſome ſuffer themſelues to
be gouerned by the cléere light of reaſon &amp; vnderſtanding, and
other ſome let themſelues be caried away headlong with their
owne affections and cuſtomes, and this is the cauſe why the
inhabitants of the Orientall. Aſia vnder the dominion of the
great Cham of Tartarie, whoſe Empire is two thouſande
leagues in longitude, do hold him for the ſonne of God in earth,
and why? thoſe which liue vnder the great Turke belieue Mahomet
to be a greater prophet then Ieſus Chriſt: and why? the
Iewes ſcattered in great multitudes follow the cuſtomes of

their fathers, reiecting the true Meſſias, to looke for another:
and why? Chriſtendome is ſo troubled by reaſon of the Romiſh
conſtitutions, which ſome beléeue to be holie and neceſſarie to
ſaluation, and others altogither contemne: being none other
meane of reconciliation amongſt vs, but to caſt away theſe
blinde mufflers of cuſtomes, hatred, and conſideration of loſſe
or gaine, &amp; to ſuffer our ſelues to be directed by the cleare light
of the heauenly word, by the vnſearchable workes of God, and
by liuely reaſon clarified with authenticall hiſtories of time.
Putting but this in practiſe once, wee ſhall ſoone diſcouer, and
cléerely ſée with our eyes the wonderfull déepe ſubtilities of Italians,
and hereafter beware how we be ouerrought by their
pollicies.
         
         
            Cap. 2.
            
               How in the perſons of Romulus, and Numa Pompilius,
their were two kindes of gouernmentes prefigured among
the Italians.
            
            FIrſt we will conſider, euen as in the murther of Abell,
committed by Cain, God did prefigure vnto vs, that the
good ſhould be perſecuted by the wicked for his ſeruice ſake
till the end of the world: ſo alſo in the perſon of Romulus
firſt founder of Rome, &amp; murtherer of his brother Romus and
Taſsius his companion, as alſo in the perſon of Numa Pompilius,
a moſt ſubtill and ingenious inuentor of a forged religion,
to eſtabliſh his owne gouernment. God would manifeſt
vnto vs, that this nation ſhould ſerue it ſelfe héereafter, with
murthers and apparance of a counterfet religion, to laie hands
on others kingdomes, and to ſnatch away the ſubſtance of other
peoples: for we ſée euen as their firſt domination began
at the firſt by effuſion of bloud, and after by cloake of religion:
ſo alſo it is come to paſſe, that the firſt glorie of the great Empire
of the Italians, to the which all Europe was brought in
ſubiection and made tributarie, was gotten by the great murthers
ſo commonly committed in the time of Marius and Sylla,
contriued by Auguſtus Caeſar, and by Anthony, which
luſtre being by long tract of time dimmed and extingniſhed, is

by a cleane contrarie maner reſtored and reſtabliſhed vnder a
faire ſhew and cloake of religion.
         
         
            Cap. 3.
            
               How the ſubtill Italian borroweth the name of the Pope,
to come to his pretences with more facilitie.
            
            NOw I pray thée Reader, be not perſuaded, that I meane
by this diſcourſe contemptuouſly to blame the Popes of
Rome in their owne perſons, or any holy conſtitution in the
Church of Rome: My deſire is only to lay open the déep reach
and ſubtiltie of the Romanes, who by a great foreſight and immutable
order, haue béen able ſo to handle their affaires, and to
diſpoſe of Popes, of Kings and Princes of the earth, in ſuch ſort
that they haue got the head and rule ouer them, and fetch round
ſummes of deniers out of their cofers, and from their commons
beſides. For proofe hereof, I will maintaine the like prepoſition,
that was held to Auguſtus Caeſar, the greateſt, happieſt,
ſubtilleſt, and moſt pollitike Monarke of the worlde. It was
this, That he commanded indéed all nations, and all the world
trembled at the excellencie of his nature, but yet that his wife
commanded him, and his daughter her mother: giuing thereby
to vnderſtand, that it was they that ruled only, borrowing his
name to authoriſe and eſtabliſh what they liſted. So I ſay, that
whatſoeuer is ratified, publiſhed and receiued vnder the name
and authoritie of the Popes, it is but the counſell and inuention
of the Italians of Rome, who to authoriſe their doings, couer
them with the name of the Pope, and therefore muſt be
attributed to them, as to the inuentors, perſuaders, and contriuers
of that which procéedeth from his holines.

               A liuely patterne of Italian ſubtiltie, in the perſon of Katherine
de Medicis, and her Florentine Counſell.
            
            FOr confirmation of that which goeth before, and for demonſtration
of the matter, let vs ſet before our eyes the eſtate

of France, in the time that Katherine de Medicis, Quéene-Mother
liued, and we ſhall ſée, as in a cleare glaſſe, that ſhe and
her Councell of Italians got betwéen them the whole gouernment
&amp; diſpoſing of all the affaires in France, into their hands,
and like bloodſuckers ſucked the bloud of the poore people ſo dry,
as if it had béene cruſhed out in a wine-preſſe: ſo that by ſuch
crueltie, men periſhed in France by famine, nakednes, &amp; hearts
griefe, by thouſands and millions, and neuer were there ſo many
died by poyſon of Serpents and other venimous beaſts, nor
by the crueltie of Tygers, Lybbards, Crocodiles, Lynres,
Beares, and other deuouring beaſts, ſince the creation of the
world, as by their tyrannous crueltie, ſhewed whileſt they bore
the ſway. This could not any one French man perceiue to
come to paſſe, for ſo ſmal a matter, as to haue matched ye daughter
of an Italian Duke with a younger brother of France:
But herehence procéedeth it, that this nation is ſo ingenious
and ſubtill, that vpon the leaſt occaſion which may be, it maketh
way and meane to enterpriſe and effect the greateſt matters
in the world, and moreouer, to laie the blame and grudge
that commeth by their ſtingings &amp; exactions vpon other mens
ſhoulders: fine workemen I warrant you: that can ſo cloſely
couer their dealings with the name &amp; authoritie of great Prelates,
Kings or Princes, that the hatred and blame may lie vpon
their neckes, and the profite be put in their owne purſes.
And ſure this nation can make ſo ſure way ſo far before hand,
and ſo contriue their plots, that then at the length onely men
can perceiue them, when it is cleane paſt their power to finde
out any remedie to preuent them.
         
         
            Cap. 5.
            
               How of anie light occaſion, this Nation can deuiſe to
effect great matters.
            
            FOr euident proofe hereof, this Italineſſe had not remained
lōg time in France, but Monſeur le Dauphin, who was
to rule ouer vs, as lawfull heire to the Crowne, vaniſhed
quickly by ſome perfume, or by ſome other Italian deuiſe,

thereby to giue entrance, and make a gap for the Italians to
ruſh in, to the managing of the greateſt partes of the affaires
of France. And this occaſion béeing redoubled by the death of
King Henry, they tooke faſt hold of her haire which groweth
before, not letting her ſlip out their hands to runne after her,
iudging the two beſt means to procure the gouernment of this
eſtate to this woman and themſelues, was firſt of all to bring
vp thoſe which ſhould rule ouer vs in all laſciuiouſnes and pleaſure,
to make them more effeminate then their owne mother,
and likewiſe in the ignorance of good letters and in well gouerning
an eſtate, to the end that their Italineſſe being more forward
in knowledge of theſe things then they, (to the great aduantage
of Italians) might ſeaſe wholly on the gouernment
of the kingdome, and the entire diſpoſing of all France: and
ſecondly, to ſow debates, &amp; ſtir vp warres among the French,
leaſt that their vnion and concord might diſturbe or not permit
the rule, gouernment, and aduancement of a ſtraunge nation
ouer them, who could not ſuffer or permit any gouernment to
the onely daughters of our Kings of France it ſelfe,
         
         
            Cap. 6.
            
               The Romane ſoweth diuiſions, and putteth away the ſnbſtance
of a people, to enrich himſelfe, and to do with it
at his pleaſure.
            
            THeſe two breaches being made in the body of France, the
Italians perſuading themſelues, that if then when they
had yet no way to ſet in foote, which was but in the time of K.
Henry, they were able to frame among them ſuch diſorder, that
Francis the firſt, hauing left ſeuentéene hundred thouſande
crownes in his coffers, albeit he had paide ranſome in Spaine:
the ſaid Henry hauing raigned but a while, had left his heire
behinde him indebted fortie thrée Millions, which was a moſt
ſtraunge and maruellous debt, conſidering the great tributes
which he had exacted of his ſubiects, of the employing whereof,
there could be none account heard, notwithſtanding the beſt
friendes and louers of the communaltie, made a motion &amp; were
verie inſtant. They haue at this preſent farre more abilitie by

the authoritie and ſubtilitie of their Italineſſe, to proſecute the
ruine and vtter ſubuerſion of this eſtate: the which to bring to
a low ebbe: they muſt fill full of ciuill warres, and ſo ouer loade
with ſuch heauie burthens of ſubſidies, taxes, and new rereages,
that they poore people remained quite ruined and troden
downe, ſo that it could neuer ſince recouer foote againe: and
the better to feare and torture them thereunto, to locke them
vp in priſons, and there to make them rot miſerably, if they did
not pay their intollerable ranſomes, excéeding in many partes
of France, more by the third part then the yéerely reuenue of
the poore Peſant did amount vnto: not diſburdening him therby
any thing at all of his charges in finding ſouldiers, of whom
he was daily ſore gnawen, deuoured, beaten, and oppreſſed, beſides
the extremitie ſhewed vnto him in paying the fines of his
wine, without the which he could by no meanes be diſcharged.
Thus this ſubtill nation hauing gotten on their ſide ſome Italionate
Frenchmen, to take their partes, and to fortifie them
ſomewhat more: as alſo to laie part of the blame of theſe pilleries
on their backs, do all things at their owne will and pleaſure,
to the enriching of themſelues, and to the vtter ruine of
the poore commons, who abide the greateſt ſmart of all. And
he which would deſire to know what is become of all theſe exceſſiue
heapes of mony leuied in this kingdome: let him goe to
Florence, to behold the ſumptuous buildings which there haue
béen erected by our ruines, and there let him ſée the wondrous
wealth wherein many Florentines ſwimme, which came but
like poore ſnakes into France, and now how they haue altered
their ſtate. But if the people of France had had as much witte
and wiſedome as they: they ſhould at the firſt haue laide their
heads togither, and concluded to haue chaſed them backe into
their owne countrey, and foreſéeing the debates and quarrels
that they began to ſow euery where in France, haue ſent them
backe to their owne home: as they themſelues once ſerued the
French, when they were in their country, in like maner.
         
         
            
            Cap. 7.
            
               How this Nation going about to ruine a countrie, beginneth
with ſome one eſtate, and from thence commeth
to all the reſt by degrees, and how the French can by
no meanes take ſuch opportunitie when it ſerueth
them.
            
            ALthough they haue béen alwaies voyd of all mercie and
compaſſion towardes the poore people, hauing drenched
them drie, and brought them to great miſerie, yet they haue
ſhewed as little fauour as might be to Churchmen, making
them to be gnawen to the bare bone with tenthes, and to be
puld a hole lower by ſale of their goods, maintaining all inequalitie
amongſt them, making floods of riches to run downe
the héeles of ſome Italianate ſpirits, their coherents, and as for
thoſe who take paines daily in diuine ſeruice, which the French
Romans wil not meddle withal, nor ſo much as with the tip of
their finger to turne ouer one leafe of it, they may haue a ſore
drowth, but the diuell a whit of drinke will they giue them to
coole their thirſt. Their Nobles they were ſaluted ſo oftentimes
with ſummonings to aſſemble themſelues, who held any
landes of the Crowne, to bee ſeaſſed for the affaires of the
warres and paiment of ſouldiers, and withall put to ſuch pinches
and daungers, to ruine one another: with ſuch extreame
coſts and charges raiſed by the vaine enhancings of their gold
chaines of their Order, for all paiments and wages employed
onely for the payes of the Italians, and other ſtrange nations.
As for the Officers, although that their offices were ſold vnto
them in the wane of the Italian power, ten times dearer then
in the raigne of any former Prince or King, they were ſo fléeced
and pulled away by ſubſtitution of others, that did robbe
them of all the profit and honour that might grow therby, who
in their turne alſo were pilled and brought to nothing, by reſtoring
the mony that was ſucked from them, that firſt bought
them: ſo that by that time all their landes were counted, there
was nothing to be laughed at on no ſide: but only the Florentines
and their partners, who might wel laugh in their ſléeues,
hauing ſo much the more to drinke, filling their purſes, with

the emptyings of others, ſo that by ſuch deuiſes they haue ſo
well ſucked out the ſubſtance of the French, that ſince the comming
of this Italianeſſe into France: they haue picked more
pence out of the coate of this people, then during the raigne of
twelue Kings before. The tokens wherof moſt manifeſtly appeare,
eſpecially vpon the poore peſants by their nakednes, who
go apparrelled but with old linnen cloth in the greateſt coldes,
and are beſides conſtrained to humble themſelues ſo low, as to
liue vpon Oates and Peaſe like bruit beaſts. The cauſe and
originall of all theſe miſeries procéeding of the marriage of one
Italineſſe in France, aſpiring to make way for her adherents,
and to get the Crown into her own hands, making our kings
odious to the whole world: and this ſheweth well, that they
are ſo ingenious, that of the leaſt occaſion that may ſerue to
fauour them: they know how to finde and fetch out greater aduantages,
farre beyond the reach of any nation in the world
beſide. This thou ſhalt eaſily perceiue, if with the conſideration
of that which goeth before, thou caſt but thine eye of vnderſtanding
vpon the French, to ſée how great a number of the
Kings daughters haue béen married into Italy, as Madame
Renee daughter of King Lewes the twelfth, to the Duke of
Ferrara: others to the King of England, &amp; into Spaine, to the
Dukes of Sauoy, and of Lorraine. By meanes of whom, although
they were all deſcended of farre more noble houſes then
her, yet the French could neuer by any ſuch occaſion tyranniſe
and impoueriſh theſe people, neuer making the leaſt commoditie
thereby, or get any other preferment: but to the contrarie,
they ſtill left behinde them verie much of their owne, as in the
marriages of the King of Spaine, and of the Duke of Sauoy,
where they got to their ſhares the faireſt fléeces and conqueſts
of France. And this may verie well ſhew how groſſe witted
we are in France, and how ingenious and ſubtill the Italian is
at euerie opportunitie that may happen. Sée wherfore I wold
faine be able to perſwade the Popes, quite to forſake this nation
to come into Swicerland, and into France, verie curteous
and good people: to deliuer themſelues from the yoake of that
nation which is the moſt corrupt in the whole world: for if one
onely Italineſſe were able to chaine our Kings at Paris, and

within a litle therabouts, and with one winke of her eye make
tremble Conſtables, Marſhals of France, gouernours of prouinces,
and by the leaſt word or letter alter the Parlaments of
France, what may ten 1000. Italians do, enuironing a Pope?
It is certaine, they may force his will by violence, depriuing
him of his libertie in his gouernment of ye church. Or if he bow
not that way which they wold haue him, they wil not ſticke to
giue his holines ſome dramme of ſuch perfume, as they did to
the deceaſſed Quéene of Nauarre. This is the cauſe why commonly
we ſée foure or fiue Popes to die, during the raigne of
one Emperour. Wherefore he ſhould do well either for loue of
his life or his libertie to retire and come away from amongſt
them.
         
         
            Cap. 8.
            
               Vpon what occaſion the Romanes changed their Monanarchie
into a populer eſtate: that is to wit, vppon the
rauiſhment of Lucretia, committed by their king Tarquinius.
            
            BVt to make a more liuely repreſentation of the great wiſedome
of the Italian, we muſt mount a litle higher to the beginnings,
progreſſe, and aduancement of this admirable domination,
whether by degrées it hath eleuated it ſelfe in perceiuing
the Tarquins their kings were verie vicious, and nothing valerous,
they ſpied out matter inough quickly againſt them to
be rid of them, ſo iumpe at that time fell out for their purpoſe
the rauiſhment of Lucretia, perpetrated by Tarquinius their
King: wherupon they made a commotion againſt him, by and
by to thruſt him out of his kingdome: not that they meant to
reſtabliſh any other in his place, but to alter this forme of gouernment
(although it be abſolutely the beſt, when kings rule
as they ſhould do, and behaue themſelues well) and to inſtitute
another, which ſhould exalt them (as they thought moſt likely)
aboue all other peoples, and make them all tributarie to
them. Now this was their order, to haue a Senate wherein
men of the greateſt ſpirites, verie well learned and experienced
were only admitted, by whom euery yéere ſhould two Conſuls

be choſen, who ſhould alwaies haue the conduct of warres: and
beſides if any important affaires chanced, then was there elected
one to be a Dictator, and ſuch a one as was moſt worthie
of all Italy to command &amp; to reſiſt, whom ſoeuer came againſt
the Romanes. So that if one Conſull loſt a battaile, the eſtate
was not thereby ouerthrowne, becauſe his fellow had muſtered
in a readines another Army readie to fight and giue battell
againe, ſo that if he alſo were vanquiſhed, they had for all that
good hope yet, being the Dictator to come, vpon whoſe valour
and experience, they moſt of all relied, (as on Marius and Fabius,)
for he ſet in incontinent for the third man. This is the
reaſon, that when the enimies of the Romanes had gotten two
fieldes againſt them, as diuers times did Pyrrhus and Hanniball,
they were not diſmaied for all that, and thought themſelues
thereby neuer a whit the more ouercome, whereas contrariwiſe,
if any King, Prince, or common wealth had once had
an ouerthrow by a battell in the field, they could not ſo ſoone recouer
their loſſe, but would iudge themſelues ſtraightwaies
ruined, and ouerthrowen. By this meane, their domination
ſéemed altogither inuincible, till by their owne Armies, by ciuill
broyles and domeſticall iarres, they conſpired their owne
ruine and deſtruction.
         
         
            Cap. 9.
            
               How the Romanes by pretence of their Faith, founde
meanes to augment their Domination.
            
            ALbeit, that this ſo goodly order and forme of gouernment
might haue béene ſufficient to make them ſurpaſſe
all other people, yet they perceiuing that the breaking
of faith and promiſes, did worke the ruine of all
eſtates, that made no conſcience to violate them: the Italians
well aduiſed hereof, as thoſe that ſaw well inough that Faith
was the moſt firme bande of humane ſocietie: and that where
it raigned not, euen did ſtand verie flipperie, and were alwaies
ſtaggering, tottering, and ſhakyng with feare, and miſtruſt:
to the end to binde themſelues moſt ſtrictly to the obſeruation
of the ſame, and to make all the world belieue that they would

inuiolably kéepe their promiſes, they builded a Temple of
FAITH: to the which they gaue great honour and reuerence.
Whereupon euerie one aſſuring them ſelues in their
fidelitie, deſired their league and friendſhip, and to couer them
ſelues with their protection and fauour, ſparing neither tribuite
nor ſubiection to obtaine the ſame. This was a moſt
rare péece of pollicie and wiſedom, found out by them, whereby
they bore ſway, and drew profit from all other peoples: albeit
otherwiſe the Italians were farre ſurpaſſed by them in number
&amp; forces. Hereby may we then ſée euidently, that they haue
a ſpirite more ſublimate and ingenious, then any other nation
that liueth vnder the ſcope of the heauens.
         
         
            Cap. 10.
            
               The ruine of the firſt Romaine Domination, and the cauſes
thereof.
            
            BVt as all earthly thinges come in proceſſe of time, to faile
in glorie and naturall force, ſo this braue Signiorie which
ſeemed to ſway the whole earth, fell at laſt to decay and
ruine, becauſe at the firſt beginning they did but ſhaue and
clip thoſe which were ſubiugated and forced to take hold on the
cordes of the empire, to make them a little gentler and tamer:
afterwardes they fell roundly to fleying of them: beſides the
horrible and deteſtable cruelties of Nero, Caligula, Commodas,
Heliagabalus, and other ſuch like monſters, made this
nation odious, and ſpited of manie others, who beginning a
little to diſcouer, that the Romaines had not brought them in
ſubiection by any greater power or multitudes, whereby they
excelled them too that waies, but rather had gotten the vpper
hand, by ſowing quarrels amongſt them, by ſuppriſing them
vnawares, and eſtabliſhing among them a better order of militarie
diſcipline, then was before: they reſolued with hazarde
of their liues to ouerthrow their tirannie, and to pull downe
their intollerable Domination to the ground. Amongſt other
the people of the North, enuironing the left arme, I mean
the Gothes, the Saxons, and Hungarians who hauing experience

of their ſtrength, to bee farre paſſing that of Italians,
obſeruing a better order in their warfare then before, ſet forwarde
and proſecuted ſo luſtilie, the courſe of their hartie enterpriſes,
that they became in ſhort time maiſters of the citie
of Rome, and many other partes of Italie. In like manner
Arthure a moſt valiant king of England, accompanied with
ſixe hundred thouſand men, victoriouſly ouerthrew Lucius the
Romaine Senator, marching with no leſſe number of ſouldiours
then he, pretending to make the Engliſh tributarie, as
they were before time. The Gaules likewiſe caſt of their
yoke, and the Almaines got from them the dignitie imperiall,
into their owne handes, whereupon enſued the totall ſubuerſion
of this their firſt earthly violent, and forced Domination,
vnder the which, they had yoaked in the neckes of all the
reſt of the people of Europe.
         
         
            Cap. 11.
            
               Of the beginninges and firſt foundations of the ſecond
Domination of the Romanes in chriſtiandome.
            
            THey then perceiuing by their profound wiſedom, that
there was no meanes to be had, for the reeſtabliſhment
of their firſt Domination, becauſe the nations of the North
moſt ſtrong and warlike, had made proofe that the corporall
ſtrength of Italians, was farre inferiour to theirs, and that it
was impoſſible to bring them euer ſo low againe by armes or
force, to yéelde them that obedience they had done in former
time: yet the Italians lay other ambuſhes for them, and begin
to deceiue theſe people, to bring them vnder againe, by a
victorie altogether ſpiritual, voluntarie, and nothing at all carnall,
taſtiug nothing but a ſpirituall gouernment, and ſuch a
one as might guide men to life euerlaſting: and to lay the
foundation ſtones of this Domination: they muſt vphold that
there is none other meane to be brought for the confirmation
of the chriſtian Church, but by eſtabliſhing of a ſoueraigne
Heade and vniuerſall Biſhop, in like manner forſooth, as it is
in the Monarchies and Empires of the world. Perſwading

themſelues, that if they had carried awaie this pointe
once, they might verie well preuaile in the reſt, ſéeing that
Rome had béene the ſeate of the rulers and Emperours of the
earth, they might rather then any other nation com by this
prerogatiue, to diſpoſe of chriſtian people, vnder the cloake and
authoritie of their vniuerſall Biſhop, at their owne will and
pleaſure, ſo that they might without euer ſtriking ſtroke, or
ſhedding bloud, be kinges, and make money come apace from
al prouinces, which ſhould proteſt to hold ye chriſtian part. And
for a fairer ſhew and more credit of the matter, it were verie
méete to publiſh by word of mouth, by reporte and writings,
that Rome had béene the ſeat of S. Peter, and that he ſuffered
martiredome there, ſo that thereby he had planted in that citie
a more excellent dignitie and prerogatiue, then in anie other citie
of the world.
         
         
            Cap. 12.
            
               How in creating an vniuerſall Biſhop at Rome, the Italians
entred into poſſeſsion of a farre more excellent
Domination, then that which they had loſt before.
            
            THeſe two pointes being once granted them, the Italians
might verie well diſpoſe at their pleaſure, of all chriſtiandome,
putting on but the cloake and authoritie of their vniuerſall
Biſhops. This was an eaſie way for them to hold,
for the recouerie of a more excellent Domination (being now
ſpirituall and heauenly) then the firſt which they had loſt, and
by this prerogatiue might they make the pureſt and moſt precions
golde and ſiluer of all chriſtianitie, to flie to Rome. It
was moſt eaſie of all to make this currant among other Biſhops:
perſwading them that all this did but encreaſe their
dignitie and profit, and inueſt them with a power to make
heade againſt the kinges of the earth, to caſt of their yoake,
and neglect all their magiſtrates. By reaſon whereof, this inuention
was found good, and paſſed quickly without any contradiction:
but there was onely a little ſtrife betwéene the Biſhop
of Rome, and him of Conſtantinople, for the ſuperioritie

of them two. But yet on the Italians ſide, there was no
meane to make them forgoe this dignitie, they would in no
wiſe lay it downe, becauſe they foreſaw that therby they could
make what doctrin they liſted currāt throughout all churches,
and their conſtitutions to be receyued euerie where, as the decrées
of their ſoueraigne and heauenly Court: they could make
them ſelues redoubted and feared of the kinges, and princes of
the earth, as though they were the onely Porters of heauen
gates, and that no man coulde come in there, but by their
leaue, meane, and fauour. To make the reſt of the Clargie receiue
this inuention, there was no more adoe, but to performe
it with a ſmell of the augmentation of their dignitie and profit,
and they ſtraight waies embraced it, with all ioy and gladneſſe:
for whileſt that men are liuing here in this earth, verie
few are found, but will ſuffer themſelues to bee infected with
ſuch plagues, which (as Galen ſaith) are Auarice and Ambition,
which bring vnto the ſoule that which the falling ſickneſſe
doth bring to the bodie. And if there be anie found anie
found amongſt the reſt, which haue the glorie of God, and
the ſaluation of men in greater regarde, it is in ſo ſmall number,
that the greater part ſhall ſoone ouercome the better, and
bring them quicklie to a contrarie bow.
         
         
            Cap. 13.
            
               How the people follow none other religion but that
which their Paſtors teach them, and how the Romanes
giue vs one according to their owne nature.
            
            TOuching the people (by whom I comprehend Nobles,
Citizens and Peſants) in matter of religion, they will
embrace that which their Paſtors ſhall preach vnto them, or
that wherein they haue béene brought vp, without making any
further choice: So that if a man be of the Empire of Tartarians,
he will frame himſelfe to the forme of diuine ſeruice
that is there eſtabliſhed: in like manner will hée doe that is
borne among Turks &amp; Iewes, Lutherians, and Catholiks:
the worſt is when he is grounded in one, he wil take no knowledge,

nor make none examination of anie other, but will haue
them all in deteſtation, and ſhall be as glorious in his owne, as
if he had found ſome pretious treaſure of ineſtimable valour,
eſpecially when he hath his eyes dimmed by ſenſible, terreſtriall,
and humaine religion.
            The Italian is not here to ſéeke how to deale with him,
he can handle the matter ſo well, that he will fetch ſome ſubſtance
from him, without any warre or violence, and at his
owne pleaſure: and to effect the ſame, he hath no more to doe,
but to winne to his ſide the Doctours and Prieſtes, which inſtruct
the people, who may teach them a religion which is altogether
agréeable to their owne nature. But here is the
point of controuerſie, which hath and ſhall be euer betwoone
God and men: that God wil be honoured with a ſeruice agréeable
to him ſelfe, and of the qualitie of his owne nature, to wit,
ſpirituall, diuine, and heauenly: and wee humaine creatures,
cleane contrarie will ſerue him with a ſeruice that is neareſt
and beſt agréeing to our owne nature: for it is his will, that
when we adore and inuocate his holy name, we ſhould lift vp
our ſpirits aboue the heauens: and we deſire to finde him here
below on earth, in our Temples, vnder ſome viſible forme,
which we may ſée and touch, becauſe that our earthly nature
taketh farre greater delight, in that which it ſéeth with the bodily
eyes, then to tranſport it ſelfe in ſpirit aboue the azured
heauens, ſo farre diſtant from vs. In like manner thoſe which
will make their prayers to the ſaintes of Paradice, take great
pleaſure to haue their images here below on earth, ſauing a
long iourney to goe into the kingdom of heauen to ſéeke them.
God will haue his diuine ſeruice procéeding from his diuinitie,
and ſuch a one whereof he himſelfe is the authour: and we take
more delight in that which is humaine, and procéedeth from
our owne braine, becauſe it moſt conſiſteth in viſible things,
to be beholded with theſe our bodily eyes: as are ſumptuous
and goodly Temples, gliſtering with coſtly glaſſe windowes,
triumphantinges, liuely pictures, images exquiſitely carued
forth, moſt precious clothes, of Arras, Chalices, Croſſes of
the fineſt Ducket gold, height of Piramides, Copes of crimſin
veluet, others of cloth of gold and ſiluer, which are thinges

moſt pleaſant to the eies to behold. And to delight the hearing
with ſongs of Mnſicke, noyſe of Organs, and ſound of Belles:
al theſe things are delectable in déed, and haue ſome ſhew of humane
wiſdom, for all that haue they not God for any Authour:
neither did Ieſus Chriſt nor his Apoſtles euer inſtitute or occupie
the like: rather they taught vs to deſpiſe the world, and
all that is therein, to aſpire vp to heauen, inſtructing vs to renounce
our ſelues and all the luſtes of the fleſh, to do the holie
and perfect will of God, to take vp our Croſſe and wade thorow
many tribulations into the glorie of God. And this cannot
we abide, we muſt haue a religion which wil helpe to augment
our dignities and earthly riches, that we may liue here
in all voluptuouſnes and ſecuritie. And becauſe the Goſpell taken
in his puritie is quite contrarie to that, there is nothing in
the earth that this nation hateth more, then to heare ſpeake
thereof: farre preferring a worldly felicitie preſent, which by
no meanes they will forgo, vpon hope of any eternall, abſent,
and hidden ioyes which are to come.
         
         
            Cap. 14.
            
               A compariſon of the diuine ſeruice inuented by the
Italians, with the counſell of ſome ſubtill
Phiſition.
            
            HE that would thorowly examine the forme of Religion
planted by the Italians, by the authoritie of their ſoueraigne
high Prieſt, ſhall finde all theſe things afore truely obſerued
amongſt them. So that flying therby, with wings ſwifter
and ſtronger then the wings of any Engle, they are able to
beate downe to the ground thoſe that are ſo ſawcie as to withſtand
in any thing, or gainſay in any wiſe the formes of their
ſeruices, which they haue introduced to fetch vnder their ſubiection,
the greateſt Potentates of the earth, and to draw thereby
deniers and reuenues from them: imitating herein ſome craftie
Phiſition, who preferring a good bootie of ſiluer before the
health of the ſicke patient: will learne what meate and drinke
pleaſeth beſt his appetite, and hauing found, that he loueth claret

wine aboue all things, and ſugar to make it haue a daintie
taſte, which he taketh: imagine that he goe viſit the patient,
who will ſtraight begin to tell him, how he can get no recouerie
of his ſicknes, albeit he hath vſed much blood letting, taken
many pilles, and other phiſicke, which hath brought him verie
low, and put him to much paine: this ſame impudent Phiſition
that tell him, that all that ſerued but to weaken him, &amp; to take
away his ſtomacke: and by mouing a queſtion to the ſicke patient,
ſhall aſke him, if he loue not well good claret wine? He
anſwering, with all his heart, this Phiſition ſhall reply, that
he will warrant him to recouer his health againe, if hée leaue
taking theſe hard medicines, and thoſe pilles ſo bitter in ſwallowing,
and to get ſome daintie wine of moſt delicious taſte,
if he ſhould ſend his man ten miles for ſome, to haue alwaies at
the leaſt, thrée or foure good bottles in his Celler in ſtore. And
bid him beſides, leaſt the vapours ſhould ſume too much to intoxicate
his head: to take Coriander comfits at the end of his
repaſt, &amp; aſſure him that this wil make him more luſtie againe
then all the phiſicke in the world. I let you iudge with what
audacitie the ſicke ſhall dare to imbrace this counſell? But if
it chaunce after he hath béen verie ill, and his ſicknes begin to
grow away, he come to recouer ſtraight here vpon, how will
he honour this Phiſition? he ſhall neuer be able ſufficiently to
ſet foorth his praiſe. But in the ſeruice of God it is otherwiſe,
we muſt eate the bread of affliction and ſorrow, drinke the water
of bitternes, which are verie bitter and loathſome drugs to
ſwallow, as things much offending our taſte, whereas in the
ſeruice inuented by the Italians, there is nothing but yt which
is verie pleaſant to our humane ſenſes, and which doth verie
well agrée with our carnall nature: and therefore do ignorant
men imbrace with a moſt ardent deſire, all that they inuent,
which when they haue once receiued, is hard to be rooted out of
them, becauſe their eye ſight is not quicke inough to diſcouer
the marke whereat they ſhoote, which is only to beare rule, and
to ſhare and make boote of the money which they get from
them.
         
         
            
            Cap. 15.
            
               That they care not at Rome for any diuerſitie of
Religions, ſo they tend only to maintaine
their Domination.
            
            THis is moſt manifeſt, for if any man inuent any new form
of religion neuer knowne before in the world, apparelling
himſelfe after a ſtraunge faſhion neuer ſéene before, vſing ieſtures
altogither rediculous and fooliſh: liuing after a moſt auſtere,
to cruell and brutiſh maner, as do the Capuchians, Fucillians,
and ſuch like fooliſh orders of Friars, all ſhall be approued
and receiued by the Italians with great plaudities, ſo that
ſuch religions will ſerue them for a wall and defence for their
kingdome and gaine: but if any one appeare or come neare
them that dare ſpeake againſt ſuch abuſes, and touch them to
the quicke a litle, leaning vpon the pillar of that doctrine, which
hath béen giuen from the terreſtriall Paradice, they will ſhake
a heauen and earth, and remoue all a world, to ſtop his mouth
and kill him, with great exclamations, that he went about to
ſow new doctrines, and begin ſome new ſect of religion: whereby
we may cléerely ſée, that vnder this cloake of religion, they
do but aſpire to be rulers; and to finger mony from other peoples
and nations: and that all the warres and ciuill broyles
which haue ſo long troubled Germany, Swicerland, all Flanders
and France haue byn broched and begun by them for ſuch
matters, albeit, thoſe who had the conduct thereof, enterpriſed
them for the zeale they bore to their owne religion.
         
         
            Cap. 16.
            
               That the Romanes are not contented to ſtaie themſelues
with that which is ſpirituall, but would alſo diſpoſe the
kingdomes of the earth at their pleaſure.
            
            THat the Italians ſhoote at this marke alſo, I bring euident
proofe, that when they had ſet their matters in ſo good

forwardnes that the Emperour and the other Chriſtian kings
had graunted this title of ſoueraigne high Prieſt and vniuerſall
Biſhop to their Prelate of Rome: for to be a greater ſtaie
and pillar of the Chriſtian Church, and to kéepe the other Biſhops
and Paſtours in better order, and within the compaſſe
of their dutie, they are not content to reſt with that: paſſe further,
and cauſe to preach and publiſh by word and writing, that
their Biſhop is Chriſtes onely Lieftenant on earth: to whom
all Scepters and Crownes muſt yéeld humble obeiſance and
be ſubiect, hauing full power to take them from whom he liſt,
and giue them againe to others, as it may beſt pleaſe his Holines.
And touching the kingdome of heauen, hée hath it ſo at
commandement, that he hath power to open it to ſome, and to
ſhut it to other ſome: as he that kéepeth the keyes of heauen
gates in his owne handes: as for Hell, his power ſerueth him
as well to ſend thither whole Cart loades of ſoules, no man ſo
bolde for his life as to aſke him why nor wherefore. Theſe
things made Kings &amp; Princes ſo ſore aſtoniſhed, that the Emperours
at their Coronation abaſe themſelues ſo low, as they
promiſe to ſerue the Pope, for Subdeacon to hold the ſtirrope
while he get on horſebacke, and to leade his Horſe by the bridle
a litle while. A worthie péece of homage for the Italians to
remember, who haue exalted their Sea and Biſhop to ſo great
preheminence. Of which act they may be well aſhamed, as alſo
of the diſpoſſeſſing of Childericke, deſcended from Pharamond,
of the Crowne of France, to inueſt Pipin, great Maiſter
of the Pallace, whome he had ſent with his Army to ſuccour
the Romanes, againſt other Italians, in recompence of
his conqueſtes which hée forgaue the Pope, and the people of
Rome, which was a reward out of other mens purſes, for it
coſt Childericke full deare. He learned not this by the ſucceſſion
of the Apoſtles, neither did he herein imitate Ieſus Chriſt,
for he himſelfe paide tribute to Caeſar: and he (whoſe heire and
ſucceſſour he ſaith he is) teacheth him another leſſon in his firſt
Epiſtle, Feare God, Honour the King. And S. Paul writing
to the Romanes, willeth that euerie ſoule bee ſubiect to
the higher powers: and that in reſiſting them, they reſiſt the
ordinance of God. Likewiſe S. Iohn Chriſoſtome interpreting

this place ſaith: that by theſe words, (Euerie ſoule) is
meant Apoſtles, Prophets, Euangeliſts, Biſhops &amp; Monkes,
none excepted. In like manner the high Prieſtes repreſenting
the perſon of Ieſus Chriſt, did neuer enterpriſe to make ſuch
braueries againſt Dauid, Salomon, &amp; their ſucceſſours, kings
of Ieruſalem. Is it then likely that a Biſhop or poore Monke
ſhould go about ſuch high enterpriſes of his owne motion? wée
may eaſily iudge that it is the Italians of Rome, who vnder
the couering of their names, and by their ſubtill meanes extort
from them ſuch things to make themſelues rulers, and get mony
vnder the maſke of their authorities from other peoples and
nations of the earth.
         
         
            Cap. 17.
            
               That to make the kings of the earth vaſſalles tributary to
the Romanes: they ſow warres amongſt them, and vſe
Cenſures.
            
            ALthough the Italians hauing aduanced their capitall Citie
and high Prieſtes to ſo high dignitie and ſoueraigntie,
ought to haue reſted content without encroching any further:
yet ſuch is the naturall inclination of this nation, that hauing
an inch granted them, they will take an ell: they begin now to
caſt about and deuiſe ſome meanes to winde vnder their armes
the neckes of Chriſtian Kings and Princes, to bring them to
be their tributarie vaſſals. To make way to this, conſidering
that from the beginning the Popes were not admitted in the
election of Emperors or the Kings of France, by reaſon wherof,
they could not ſo well maſter them, nor turne and winde
them at their pleaſure, becauſe they durſt not enterpriſe againſt
them ſo fréely: the Councell of Rome taketh away this obſtacle,
and worketh ſo wel in the matter, that the election is tranſlated
to the Prieſts of Rome, who are my Lordes, the Cardinals.
That once diſpatched, ſéeing themſelues greatly aduanced
thereby, they contriue other meanes which they ſée more
fit to effect their purpoſes, whereof one is to ſtirre vp warres
and debates betwéene Chriſtian Kings &amp; Potentates, wherby

they may deſtroy and weaken them ſelues, by their owne proper
armes, and bow more at eaſe their neckes vnder the Italian
Domination. The other is by the Popes cenſures to ſet
them together by the eares with domeſticall and ciuill quarrels,
and in the meane time while they iarre, to get ſome prouince
or kingdom from them into their owne handes: it is
long ſince the Romanes vnderſtood this practiſe: yea a good
while before the domination of Caeſar. For deſiring to bring
Greece in ſubiection, wherein there were two inuincible
leagues, to wit: of the Achayans and Ethobians, who held
ſo faſt together, that it was impoſſible to vanquiſh them any
way by armes: they found out this hole to enter in, to make
them fall to warres and diuiſions among them ſelues, ſo to ruinate
their owne countrie, that they might more eaſily ſet foote
into their prouinces. And if we looke well vnto the violeries
that Caeſar won on this ſide the mountaines, the Italians redoubting
the Switzers, more then any nation in the world,
as Cicero ſaith in his Philippickes, we ſhall ſée that Caeſar
charged them by ſurpriſe, at great diſaduantage, and againſt
the law of armes: they hauing paſſed the one halfe of their armie
ouer the riuer Soane, and the other remaining on the other
ſide of the riuer, could not come to fight: being as yet then
no declaration made of open warre, betwéene the Switzers
and him. Beſides he tooke Ariomiſtius chiefe Captaine of
the Almanes, and all his troupes at vnawares, and aſſailed
them in time of truce: after to couer his ſport, and to make
the matter good, he ſaide that he had diſcouered, how they went
about to ſurpriſe him. By meanes whereof hauing furniſhed
his armie with two ſtrong and warlike peoples, and hauing
by diuiſions that he ſowed euerie where, got moſt of the
Gawles on his ſide: being beſide verie ſkilfull to kéepe good order
of militarie diſcipline: it was an eaſiie matter for him to
ouerthrow all other peoples. Amongſt the reſt the Engliſh
withſtood him moſt couragiouſly at the firſt, and gaue him repulſe,
but he went another way about with them, for before he
departed, he kindled ſuch quarrels and diuiſions among them,
in the which they were verie hote one againſt another before
he returned to ſet vpon them againe: wherefore it was an

eaſie mater for him to vanquiſh and conqueſt them afterwardes.
         
         
            Cap. 18.
            
               The Councell of Rome, ſetteth kinges and chriſtian
princes together by the eares, and the way how they
diſcouer all their counſels and enterpriſes.
            
            THe Romane Councell hath got ſome more aduantage by
this their pollicie and deuice, ſince the creation of their
Pope: for pretending to bring all kinges, peoples and princes
of chriſtianitie, Catholikes, as well ſpirituall as temporall vnto
their ſubiection, vnder cloake of their Biſhops, they haue
ſpunne the thred of all the warres which haue béene betwéene
the Emperours, and other chriſtian princes, ſo to bring them
on their knées, and to vndermine them that waies, that they
muſt ſtill of force haue recourſe to them, as to a place of refuge
and protection, the onely meane to pull downe their hautie ſtomakes,
and to ſet the Italian farre aboue them. To paſſe ouer
this plancke well, they haue giuen the name of Cardinals
to the prieſtes of Rome, granting the ſonnes and brethren of
kinges and chriſtian princes, to be honoured with the ſame
title and eſtate: ſuffering them alſo to remaine with their
traine amongſt them. To the end that by theſe their creatures
they might handle and turne the other at their deuotion,
make them arme their people, and march againſt their neighbours
at their pleaſure, and diſarme againe and retire, their
forces when they ſhould ſerue God. Conſidering alſo that
by ſuch perſons, the Councels wils, and determinations of
kinges and chriſtian princes, to the which they are called,
ſhould thereby be reuealed and manifeſted to them. The
quicke ſpirited Venetians, hauing long time ſince diſcouered
this pollicie, being a people of Italie verie ſubtill, and well aduiſed,
would neuer permit that any eccleſiaſticall perſon ſhould
be admitted into their Councell, becauſe they had all taken the
oth of the Pope of Rome. Sée then it appeareth that the Romanes
are priuie to all the counſels and enterpriſer of the princes
of the earth, and of their higheſt and ſoueraine courtes,

they diſcouer all their actions, as well as if they were preſent,
where on the contrary, not one of theſe can come within them
to vnder féele their conſultations and dealinges, they are ſo
cloſe and ſecrete, whereby we may iudge clearely, how farre
they ſurpaſſe all other people in inuention and ſubtiltie of wit.
         
         
            Cap. 19.
            
               The great force of Excommunication, to put the kinges
of the arth in feare, to make them their tributaries,
and the magnanimitie of our kinges in France.
            
            NOw I come to another deuice of theires, by the which
they haue ſo cunningly triumphed ouer the kinges of the
earth, neuer ſtriking ſtroke for the matter, and without any
daunger at al, and yet they haue brought them vnder as much
or more then euer the auncient Romanes did by their Trophées
and great victories, to wit: by excommunication, with
the which they ſo frighted them, that if they had neuer ſo little
diſpleaſed them: by and by they were threatned with rebellion
of their ſubiectes, to haue their ſcepters taken from them, and
others to be inueſted therewith incontinent, hauing no way
in the world to reſiſt or ſaue them ſelues, but in humbling them
ſelues vnder the greatneſſe of their Biſhops, yéelding them
ſelues to be the Popes vaſſals, or in paying them otherwiſe
ſome great and intollerable tributes. By this meanes they
exacted from Iohn king of England, that all his ſubiectes
ſhould pay him a penny ſterling for fire, for the murther by
him committed on the perſon of Arthure Duke of Britanie,
his owne Nephew and heire, which tribute the Italians mined
from them, more then the terme of trhée hundred yeares,
albeit the fault of this murther was not in the people, &amp; therefore
they payed this tribute verie vniuſtly, and againſt all reaſon.
Yet they found meanes to augment this tribute verie
much, by the death of the Archbiſhop of Cauterburie, who
was executed by command of the king. Yet had the Italians
nothing to doe in the matter, hauing no intereſt at all therein,
being neither his heires nor children. Another tribute was

exacted of the Polonians, for the murther committed on the
perſon of Stauiſlaus their Arch-biſhop, to, which is paide for
S. Peters tongue. The Pope hauing thundered by excommunication
againſt the duke of Venis, he was faine to make
him quiet, to créepe on all foure like a Dog, hauing a rope about
his necke, to be abſolued. The kinges of Nauarre, and
Granade for diſobeying him, were diſpoſſeſſed of their kingdomes,
which were beſtowed on Ferdinand king of Spaine,
yet the Italians did not forget themſelues in this match, as
in déed they muſt nener: for it was vpon this condition, that
they ſhould afterwarde be held of their Pope of Rome. Pope
Nicholas excommunicated the kinges of Naples and Sicilie:
and making them turne ouer a new leafe, inueſted the Duke
of Aniow brother to Lewes the ninth, yet not forgetting him
ſelfe, as we ſaide before: vpon condition to pay him eight thouſand
ounces of gold yearely reuenue. He excommunicated alſo
Philippes le Bel king of France, becauſe hee would not
hold his kingdom of him, as his vaſſall: but he being diſcended
of the race of Hue le grand Countie of Paris, quaked not a
whit at the matter, but with a magnanimious courage, proper
to the kinges of this race, conſtantly reſiſted, and neuer
trembled at the hearing thereof, as other chriſtian kinges did,
whoſe great magnanimitie hath béene continued by his ſucceſſours.
This was the cauſe that the Italian Councell laide
their heades together to doe their vttermoſt to ruine this Monarchy,
by forraine forces, making it to bee aſſailed on euerie
ſide, and hauing ſet the Armies of the Empire of Spaine and
England, to thruſt this race out of their kingdom, which ſéemed
to them inuincible. But perceiuing all that tooke not
effect, as they did wiſh, they haue filled the State full of ciuill
warres, thereby to weaken and diminiſh the force of this kingdome,
and to make way to inueſt ſome other with ye Crowne:
who ſhould thinke him ſelfe borne vnder an happie planet, and
greatly beholding to them, to come by it ſo eaſily, yéelding
him ſelfe therefore there vaſſall and homager, hauing purloyned
a kingdome by there meanes. Who alſo would be eaſily
entreated to let ſlip the accords confirmed betwéene our kings
and the popes for the priuiledges, and liberties of the French

Churches, and touching the preſentations of Benefices, reſerned
to the Nobilitie and other patrones of the Layty, onely
tranſlating them ouer wholy to the Pope, and ſo to enrich
more and more the citie of Rome. And by this meane we
ſhould ſée this flouriſhing kingdom parted, as a bootie &amp; pray,
betwéene the Italian: kéeping for his part, the ſpirituall, and
his confederates who ſhoulde haue the temporall for their
ſhares.
         
         
            Cap. 20.
            
               That it is a verie falſe pretext that they take, to refuſe
the King for his religion ſake, ſeeing they haue a ſpite
at all his race, and wiſh them no more well, although
they were neuer ſo great catholikes.
            
            THat this hath béene the drift of the Italians, the proofe is
moſt manifeſt in this, that although Charles the ninth,
and Henrie the third of this name his brother, were the moſt
religious obſeruers of the ceremonies of the church of Rome,
and more preciſe then any kinges that had béene before them,
ſparing nothing to ruine and rout out the religion of the proteſtant
Huguenots, not ſo much as their owne perſons, life,
treaſure, nor liuings, nor their faith and honour beſide, which
is more. Yet for all that, could they neuer winne the fauour
and good will of the Italians, nothing neare other princes,
who had wrought little in compariſon of them. And what
was the cauſe hereof but that the Italians foreſaw that a
race of auncient, and ſo long time inueſted with the Crowne
of France: would neuer abide that they ſhould haue anie rule
or prerogatiue ouer them nor in no waies permit that the liberties
and couenants made betwéee their predeceſſors, the
kinges, and the Popes for the benefit of their kingdome ſhould
be infringed. This is the reaſon why the Councell of Rome
hath ſought all meanes poſſible to enſtall other princes in their
roome, and to bring it to paſſe: haue emploied all their Preachers,
begging Friers, and other Eccleſiaſtikes, to vomit out
all kinde of blame and ſhame moſt opprobriouſly againſt the

ſaid King Henry the third deceaſſed, placing him in the rancke
of the moſt abhominable tyrants, &amp; murtherers of the world,
whome by their count, hee ſhould ſurpaſſe in the periode of all
miſchiefe: extolling aboue the heauens with the higheſt titles
of praiſe which they could deuiſe, ſome other Princes, thereby
to adiure them, and make euerie one honour them, loue them,
and make much of them. But to ſhew that the Italians and
their partners meant no good, not onely to the deceaſed Kings
perſon, but alſo to all his race in generall, ſée wée not plainly
that when they had by treaſon cauſed him to bée murthered,
they continue their ſelfeſame practiſes towardes thoſe of the
houſe of Bourbon, iſſued of the laſt ſonne of S. Lewes, called
Robert Countie of Clermont? vpon whom, ſeeing they can
laie no blame, for that they are the true and lawfull heires of
this Crowne, they thinke to diſherite him who is the eldeſt ſon
and heire, whoſe place he holdeth and repreſenteth: vpon a coulour
onely that he beléeueth not as much or more in the Conſtitutions
of the Church of Rome, as in the word of God, and
by this text, they win the good will of the people, and of other
ignorant people. But when they contemne thoſe of this houſe,
making warre againſt them, who haue béen moſt zealous and
affectionate to their Conſtitutions, who haue alſo for defence
thereof, expoſed their liues and goods to all daungers, as haue
done the Dukes of Mont Penſier, both father &amp; ſonne: do they
not ſhew, that they are thorowly reſolued to deſtroy this race,
and to tranſlate this Crowne vnto ſome other progeny? Touching
the Kinge, who is at this preſent: they ſhould neuer
be able to attaint or ſtaine him with note of any crueltie, tiranny,
nor any other inſufficiencie to rule, for to blame him for
ſticking to that religion wherein he hath béen brought vp, it is
not likely they will, for the ſame reproch would fall vpon their
pates, if they ſhould not perſeuere in theſe. But he offreth them
faire, and more then they will accord to, that is to be heard in
a place of frée aſſembly, to eramine louingly all theſe thinges,
&amp; to ſtand to that which ſhalbe awarded for both ſides. Wherin
he ſheweth, how impudently and falſly, they argue and condemne
him to be an heretike. And as for thoſe who magnifie
and exalt the ofſpring, and deſcent of other houſes to make the

world beléeue that this whence he is deſcended, is baſe, poore,
and of no name, they are leſſe able to ſpeake of the great, high,
and noble families of Chriſtendome, then are Bats and Moles
to diſcourſe of the greatnes, height, eſſence, beautie, and admirable
operations of the Sunne: for ſéeke among all the Empires
of the Aſſirians, Perſians, Grecians, Romans, Almans,
Iewes, Tartarians, Mahometans, and ouer all the face of the
whole world beſide, and you ſhall not finde a King of greater
race, nor of more auncient family then this, hauing had xxviii.
Kings in his houſe before him, and all lineally in race maſculine:
and of his mothers ſide being the iſſue &amp; heire of a Quéen,
who with her mother the ſiſter of Francis the Great, excelled
in wit, learning, and hautie courage, all other Chriſtian Princeſſes,
that euer haue béen before them. And touching the great
bountie and vertue both in time of warre &amp; peace of the houſe
of Bourbon, neither Kings nor Princes, ſince the death of S.
Lewes, but this race hath farre gone beyond them, as all the
Cronicles of France ſhall witnes ſufficient. And touching his
wealth, he hath alway had twentie times as much as hath had
any aduerſarie he hath, hauing at ye time of his ſucceſſion more
then a million of rent, by his patrimony and yéerely reuenue,
which he might haue multiplied to as much more, if hée would
haue pinched &amp; ſucked his ſubiects, by taxings, ſales of Offices
and rearing of tributes, as ſome Italians haue cauſed to bee
done in France. Let them then laie away theſe falſe cloakes
wherewith they diſguiſe the truth of things, and let vs beléeue
for a troth, as it is true indéed, that the Italians ſéeke nothing
els but to tranſlate the Crowne into ſome other houſe, which
will bow their neckes vnder their commandements, and ſuffer
them to fiſh this Realme for ſiluer, to plant amongſt vs the
Spaniſh Inquiſition, to admit the Councell of Trent, and to
take the right of preſentations from the Nobles, to finger them
themſelues, and wipe their noſes of the beſt and ſwéeteſt profits
that belong to the Realme.
         
         
            
            Cap. 21.
            
               The great ſubtilty of the counſell of Rome in getting into
their hands the Souerantie of the newfound world
conquered by the Spaniards.
            
            BVt I cannot ſo often call to minde the conqueſt of the
new world, as I wounder at the great ſubtiltie of the
counſell of Rome, and againe at the more then great ſimplicitie
in the Spanyards and Portingales behalfe: for the Italians
perceauing to their great griefe their Domination and
tributes, to bee cut of in the Eaſt and North partes, as well
by the conqueſts of the Turke, as by the preaching of. Luther,
as alſo Pope Alexander the ſixt had ſet in his foote at
the parting of ſtakes, and made the diuiſion: geuing on halfe
to the one king and the other to the other, reſeruing for himſelfe
the ſéeſimple, principall Iuriſdiction and Souerayntie,
making theſe two Kinges conſent to bee his vaſſals, and to
holde their countries of him, although he had neither right of
ſeruice, nor of poſſeſſion, and was not the diſcouerer neither.
Yet ſée, this parte was handled with ſuch cuning and craft,
that the Italian became therby Souerayne Lord of twiſe ſo
much ſoyle and country as all Chriſtendom vnder the name of
their Pope, And by what meane? you ſhall not finde it to bee
by his great trauels, perils, and expences, but by the laboures
bloudſhedings, and armes of the Spanyardes who venture
bodyes and goodes, expoſing themſelues to infinte perils, troubles
and hazardes, to ſhipwracks of the ſea, in danger of many
Pyrates and Rouers before the can come thether: and when
the are once there and entred into the country, fainte to fight
many combats and battels, and worſe then all this, to fall into
many ſtrange and incurable diſeaſes, which procéede of
chaunge of ayer and habitation, when men tranſporte themſelues
into farre countryes, where the clymate is of farre more
exceſſiue heate and colde then their owne was. Now whileſte
theſe nations endure theſe trauels and ſorrowes, worſe then
twenty deathes, the Italians are at whome in there ſumptuas

and braue pallaces, out of all daunger, paſſing the time in al voleptuous
pleaſure, neuertheleſſe they haue the moſt pretious
and fayreſt fléece of their conqueſtes reſerued for them, euen
as well, as if they themſelues had bine the onely attempters
and atchiuers of theiſe ſo hawty and dangerous exploytes.
But let vs looke a little yf there were euer any Kinges or Emperours,
who griped ſo eaſily whole countries and kingdomes
from others, as theſe doe: Cyrus, one of the firſt, after hee
had ſuſtayned infinit turmoyles and trauels, loſt his life and
had his head put in a bole of bloud, to quench it ſo inſaciable
deſire of blood: Alexander the great found himſelfe in oftē Ieoperdies
to loſe his alſo, and was many times ouer matched,
and put to the worſt. Iulius and Auguſtus Caeſars, the moſt
politicke and wiſeſt heads of the world, neuer made any conqueſt
but by bloody fightes and victories, expoſing themſelues
to a thouſand dangers both by ſea and land: But now the
counſell of Rome taking there eaſe at thir owne home, neuer
approching any dāger for the matter, haue inueſted themſelus
with the Seigniorie and Domination of the greateſt countres
that euer haue bine conqueſted by the ſword. O ſubtill heades,
more ſubtil and cawtelous then ſubtiltie it ſelfe. O that the high
reache of thine inuentions are eleuated many degrées abone all
other nations of the earth. O that thou forſéeſt long before the
euent of things, and canſt chooſe the gayneſt wayes to attayne
thy deſires: few or none there be that can diſcouer thy meanning,
thou winneſt firſt the heart of the greateſt part of thoſe;
the third of whoſe ruine thon meaneſt to ſpin: afterwardes to
vnderprop thy ſelfe againſt thoſe that refuſe thy Domination,
and will not become thy tributary vaſſals. Thon wilt knowe
all things, and yet thou wilt kéepe other people in ſuch ignorance,
that they ſhall know nothing: thus thou vſeſt them at
thy pleaſure, leſt they ſhould bewray thée in thy ſubtill ſhifts,
and beware of them hereafter. This is they reaſon why a long
time thou haſt layd a blocke in the way, that all matters of
great conſequence either concerning Religion, or otherwiſe of
any other great importance could not be regiſtered but in thine
old mother toung the Latine, and ſore againſt thy will it hath
bine if the haue bine written or Printed in any other language

becauſe that it maketh a breach, and ſheweth a readie way for
many to come to diſcouer the fertilitie of thy ſpirit, abounding
with ſo many ſubtilities, fetches, drifts, and deceites. Sée this
is the cauſe alſo why thou wilt not permit the nations of the
new conqueſted countries to vnderſtand any thing concerning
religion or matters of State, that thou maiſt lead them by the
noſes, and handle them as if they were ſo many bruit Animals
that had neither wit nor reaſon.
         
         
            Cap. 22.
            
               The cauſes why the mony that is tranſported to Rome, is
called by the name of Quinteſſence.
            
            NOw we haue ſufficiently ſpoken of the Dominations of
the Romanes, we will paſſe to the next point touching the
extraction of the Quinteſſence of purſes, where ye muſt note
that I take purſes, for the gold and ſiluer that is put in them,
ſpeaking by a figuratiue ſpéech, for I borrow theſe termes by
a ſimilitude: for euen as in all liquers, be it of Wines, Oyles,
Plants, Sulpheres, Allums, Antymoines, and other Mynerals,
they who are ſkilled to draw out the tinctures or proprieties,
and can ſeperate them from the terreſtriall and elementall
bodie, as could that great Philoſopher Paracelſas Geſnerus,
and he that wrote the booke intitled, le Medecin Liebant:
theſe haue the ſwéete fruition of the fineſt and moſt precious
part of the bodies and naturall ſubſtances, whereof the more
celeſtiall and ſpirituall part is called Quinteſſence. In like
maner the Romanes hauing learned by incomparable ſkil and
artiſtry, to draw vnto themſelues the moſt noble portable, the
moſt deſirable and faireſt coyne of all Chriſtendome, leauing
the groſſer, and more terreſtriall ſort of baſer monies to the
Kings, Princes, and people of Chriſtendome for their vſage,
appropriating to themſelues the more ſpirituall and celeſtiall
part, which they can tell how to ſeperate from the temporall
and earthly: are verie well ſaid to draw the Quinteſſence out
of their purſes▪
            
         
         
            
            Cap. 23.
            
               Of the excellencie of the mony which is carried to Rome
out of other countries, and how the Italians onely can
fetch it thither.
            
            TO ſhewe this by a familiar example, regarde but a man
that is of baſe condition, who hath onely but fiftie or ſixtie
crownes of yéerly rent for a péece of land that he holdeth by
féefarme, lying within the demaines of ſome Baron or Countie,
he will make more account of that péece, then of thrée or
foure times ſo much lying among Peſants, or that he gathereth
among country Farmers, bragging of it euerie where.
Now ſée we ſome Biſhop, or poore Monke comming to bée
Pope, to haue rentes and tributes out of the kingdomes of
Spaine, Portugall, Naples, Sicily, and Polonia, and as hée
was woont alſo out of the kingdome of England, where as all
Chriſtian Kings and Princes take no tribute: but for the moſt
part of poore, baſe and miſerable people their ſubiects, readier to
take then to giue, and this muſt they do by Taxes, Subſidies,
Fiftéenes, and ſuch like paiments. Herein we may ſée the marueilous
excellencie of the Popes tributes aboue thoſe of all our
Kings. And to ſhew how the ſwéeteſt mony and moſt deſired
of all, goeth ſtill to the partes of Rome: marke but the common
faſhion of euerie one, that falleth into want of mony: hée
wiſheth ſtraight but to haue a hundred or two of crownes out
of the Abbots or Biſhops purſe, who is next to the place where
he dwelleth, as being ſuch fellowes which haue leaſt néed, and
yet haue the greateſt plentie of all: albeit, they may wiſh for
it long inough before they haue it to fill their purſes, becauſe
they can deuiſe no ſhift proper for the obteining of their deſire,
although they be his verie next neighbours. But the Italians,
they can worke ſuch a way, and handle their matters ſo well,
that they can ſcrape &amp; hooke to them a thouſand crownes from
one place, and twiſe as many from another, the diſtance of an
hundreth leagues or more, and the difficultie of paſſing ouer
the mountaines cannot hinder them a iote.
         
         
            
            Cap. 24.
            
               How that this mony when it is tranſported to Rome, doth
flie with an incredible ſwiftneſſe.
            
            YEt to prooue better that the name of Quinteſſence, is properly
attributed to the gold that they ſhare from other people
of Chriſtendome, I pray thée gentle Reader, conſider that
the ſubſtance of Quinteſſence is of ſo celeſtiall a nature, that
if it be not verie cloſely kept, and encloſed within ſome veſſell
for that purpoſe, it léeſeth ſtraight the vertue, and flieth away
by vapours into the ayre: ſo this gold which they fetch ſo farre
to Rome, hath ſuch an excellencie more then all other money
hath, and hath both value &amp; vertue, none like it, that we haue:
not onely for that it is leuied with ſuch wonderfull celeritie,
and vnuſuall ſpéed. (For when they purchaſe any collection of
mony, or any other Bull of an Abby or a Biſhoppricke, they
ſpare no Horſe fleſh to gather vp the ſummes taxed, &amp; hauing
gotten them vp once, they muſt go in poſt, and chaunge Horſe
ſo often, that it ſéemeth the Flie with a Swallowes wings: no
height of mountaines, no rough, narrow, ſtéepe, ſtony, hellow,
crooked, nor raggie waies, no depth of ſnowes, nor hardnes of
yſe or froſtes, no riuers that can ſtaie or ſtop the paſſage of this
mony, it muſt to Rome, it muſt flie, it muſt not créepe on the
face of the earth: and ſure it is of a wonderfull ſwiftnes in compariſon
of the heauines, delaie, and long time that the monies
of Kings, Princes, and other great Eſtates are in getting into
their coffers, whē oftētimes before they can get it in, they muſt
force the good wil of their ſubiects, &amp; be driuen to chuſe out men
that ſhall ſit vpon their Subſidies &amp; other Impoſts, &amp; others to
collect the ſame, they which will not take ſuch charges vpon
them but by great conſtraint, and being vrged by neceſſitie, and
then the poore people paie ſuch ſummes ſore againſt their will,
putting it of as long as they may. Then muſt there be ſtraining
of moueables, and much heauing &amp; ſhouing to haue them
againe, hatred, deſpleaſure, anger, ill will, much adoo, and great
delaie on euery ſide, ſo that it will aſke commonly thrée, or foure

moneths at the leaſt, to collect, and deliuer in theſe Deniers to
the receipts, although it might eaſily be carried thither in thrée
or foure houres: and in verie déede may be ſaide to march but
with wodden legges, in reſpect of the ſwift courſe and great celeritie,
of that which is tranſported to Rome. This may verie
well ſhew, that the qualitie and nature thereof, is farre more
excellent and pretious, then of that coine which the Kings and
Princes of the earth poſſeſſe. Yet ſome may peraduenture reply,
that that which commeth by the ſale of offices, approcheth
verie néere the nature thereof, I will confeſſe ſo, but I will alſo
anſwere, that ſuch trafficke is but an Italian tricke and inuention,
for that by all lawes and ordinances, both of God and
man, all ſuch ſales are forbidden as moſt pernicious, and greatly
damageable to the common wealth, and matters moſt vnworthie
&amp; vnbeſéeming all good Chriſtians, that haue the feare
of God before their eyes.
         
         
            Cap. 25.
            
               A deſcription made, by learned men which hath alwaies
feared the Councell of Rome, and the cauſes why.
            
            
               I Thinke I haue ſaid inough of the Domination and filching
of mony, wherewith the Italians haue a great while preuailed
to fill their pockets, &amp; to maſter the world. Now muſt I
ſpeake of the meanes wherwith they ſerue their turn to maintaine
thēſelus in their eſtate, &amp; to make it good againſt al other.
And albeit, in inuention and deuiſing, the yare ſo cunning, and
can paſſe and make ſéeme good to euerie one, that which they
haue inuented and deuiſed: yet are they farre more expert in
kéeping their eſtate, and can remoue and preuent all lets that
may endamage them to hold their owne. Foreſéeing then that
they had intangled the people of Europe within their Domination,
vnder the pretence and cloake of religion, there was no
more likelihood that the people might euer pull their neckes out
of their yoake, being farre groſſer and harder to receiue anie
chaunge, then the people of Affrike: ſéeing alſo that all that
they feared was, leſt that ſome, addicting themſelues to the contemplation

of Gods workes, to the ſtudie of Philoſophie, and
to the reading and peruſing of the holie ſcriptures in the language
wherein they were written, might view all the religions
that are vſed vnder the ſcope of the heauens, and ſéeke out
the firſt cauſes, principles, and inuentors thereof, and hauing
curiouſly examined all, might make theſe concluſions: viz.
that all religion is either diuine or humane: that the diuine is
procéeded from God, the other from men: that by the diuine,
there is nothing required at our hands but to offer our ſelues,
ſoules, and bodies to God, to do that which is his will, which
is to follow vertue, and to flie vice, to call vpon him and adore
his holie name, and for our ſinnes, I haue recourſe vnto the
mercie that he offereth vs in Ieſus Chriſt, the which he offereth
vs fréely without our mony or riches, onely enioyning vs
charitably to helpe and loue one another. On the other ſide, caſting
their eyes vpon humane religion, they ſhall ſée that all religions
that men haue, whether they be Paſtors of the church,
or who ſoeuer they be: for their authours, tend onely but to get
rule, &amp; to draw away the ſubſtance of thoſe that embrace them,
and are fitter to tye men by the féete to this earth, then to carrie
them vp to heauen, where the ſeate of God is. Concluding
likewiſe this: that, that religion is beſt, by the which God is
beſt ſerued: then it muſt néedes follow, that following his will
declared by his word, he is better ſerued, then by the traditions
of men: wherefore we muſt not go beyond that, as being the
onely obiect of faith, and as being the onely thing which agreeth
with his Doctours and Preachers in all the partes of the
world, to wit, the Firmament, with his admirable greatnes
and beautie almoſt incomprehenſible: the Planets placed betwéene
it and vs: the ayre, and that which is engendred therein,
the earth, the water, and the creatures which liue and moue
in the ſame, altogither ſetting forth from the one ende of the
world to the other, the greatnes, maieſtie, wiſdom, prouidence,
power, and bountie of God the Creator and preſeruer of the
ſame. On the other ſide, ſeruing to conuince vs of weakenes of
ſpirit, of ignorance, of blindnes, and vncapablenes to comprehend
his eſſence, his profound wiſedome, and the meane wherby
he hath created all theſe things, how he conſerueth them in

their being, and how he worketh euery daye in the diuerſitie
of ſo many things which we ſée before our eyes, to learue vs
thereby, that it is an intollerable auragancie, and preſumption
in men to thinke to be his councellers, to make lawes, like
lictle Kings, in his Church, which he calleth the Kingdome of
heanen, and his Spowſe: to there great ſhame which name
themſelues ſeruants in the ſame, by whome agreat ouerſight
and raſhnes (not to be borne with all,) goe about to eſtabliſh in
it certaine humaine Conſtitutons, as though they weere to
commād and not to obay. For ſéeing that it is his Spowſe: ſeruantes
muſt not be ſo ſaucie as to make Lawes for her to bee
at their checke. Séeing then that hée is the ſoueraigne King,
and him before whome all things are preſent, no man may
enterpriſe ſuch things without encroching vpon his kingdom,
reputing himſelfe of greater wiſedome then hee, who is his
creatour, which are greuous offences deſeruing very great
puniſhments, and cleane contrary to our dutie towards God,
which is to ſhew our ſelues, humble, lowly and glad to bee
taught by him, and to tremble at his words, as this Dampiſh
earth an inſenſible and deafe creature taught vs, at the publication
of the law, when it reeled, trembled and was readie to
ſhake in ſunder at the voyce of God. Moreouer what fayre
ſhew ſoeuer they can ſet on the Conſtitutions of Paſtors, the
ſhall alwayes be humaine, and whoſoeuer obayeth them, obayeth
but men and there inuentions. But he that woulde
looke with a vigilant eye to the neere examination and déepe
ſownding therof: ſhal eaſily diſcouer, that their only purpoſe is
to amplifie there authoritie more and more ſtill, and to drawe
coyne from people ſecretly, ſelling that at an hard and deare
rate which God geueth vs fréely, and offereth vs moſt gratis.
And this is the reaſon why the Italyans fearing leſt the publications
of ſuch doctrine altogether heauenly and diuine, would
make there Domination ſhake from the top, quickly turne it
vp ſide downe, and ſoone diminiſh all the profits that the reape
out of the countries of all Chriſtendome, by meanes of their
reaching inuentions: they haue therefore by a moſt ſubtill
péece of prouidence toke order in the matter that the Doctrine
and leſſons of theſe men come not to light by remedies which

ſéeme to be the fitteſt in the world for their purpoſe.
         
         
            Cap. 26.
            
               The firſt meanes that the Romanis vſe to maintaine their
Domination.
            
            FIrſt, to preuent leſt any ſhould attaine to ſo great knowledge
in the holy Scriptures, that they ſhould finde out of
themſelues the moſt perfect and onely wholſome meanes
of ſaluation to conſiſt therein, and to deſpiſe all other humaine
ſeruices: the haue cauſed all that concerneth the Diuine
ſeruice to be written and pronounced in a tongue out of vſe
with all nations, the vnderſtanding whereof cannot be attayned,
but in conſuming many yeares great trauels, and much
coſt, to thende to kéepe the people ſtill in ignorance of the true
way to ſerue God. Taking good héede not to tranſlate it into
Italian, leſt by and by they ſhould proue to lerned to ſuffer the
councell of Rome, to handle them as they haue done. And beſide
all this to vſe the matter ſo, that the that vnderſtand Latine
ſhould not learne to much by the lecture of the Epiſtles
and Goſpels, the haue ſet downe an order that the ſhall ſing
thē with ſuch a Note, that thoſe which vnderſtand the tongue
very well otherwiſe, ſhall not vnderſtand much more in that
place, then the ignorant people: for to ſpeake troth the councell
of Rome vſeth the word of God no further, but ſo fare as it
will ſerue for there Domination and enriching in other partes
of Chriſtendome, and would be willing that whatſoeuer therin
is contained importing any diſaduantage to their dealinges,
had bine cut of fiue hundred yeares ſince, for that they haue no
néede of it, obſeruing therein verie well the ſaying of a certaine
Philoſopher vſed in theſe ſpeaches: Take heede leſte in ſeeking
to much the Heauen, yee looſe not the earth. Which
is as much to ſay: that they muſt prefere earthly things before
the kingdome of God. As we ſée the Italians doe, interpreting
or reading Gods commandements when the cutof the defences
made in the law of God, againſte Images: whereof one
is, not to make Images, another not to bow downe to them,

and the third not to worſhip them. Would they euer do this,
thinke you, but that they foreſée that the true vnderſtanding of
this commandement, wold coole &amp; fréeze the zeale of thoſe that
bring offrings to the worſhipping of their Images, with the
which they licke their lippes full ſwéetly. But they will not I
warrant you, peruert or miſconſter this article. Thou art Peter,
and vpon this Rocke will I build my Church. All the
world ſhall heare, what theſe wordes ſignifie, they will want
no Trumpets for the matter, that they may therby be Dominators
and Kings, and fetch in mony by Cart lodes to Rome:
ſuch force and vertue haue thoſe wordes, ſo ſure a ſtaffe vnto
them is the rocke of S. Peter. Sée then this is one mean moſt
ingeniouſly inuented, to containe the people within the obedience
of the Romane Councell.
         
         
            Cap. 27.
            
               A ſecond meane that they haue to keep men in their ſeruice
ſtill.
            
            BVt iudging that to be a ſufficient remedy to withhold learned
men, who by reading of the holie ſcriptures, by true
contemplation of thinges created by the handie worke of
God, and by the great harmony of both theſe, ioyned togither,
ſhould be brought to the knowledge of the Creator, and to the
true ſeruice conuenient for his holie name, and ſo fall to be opinatiue,
reiecting the Italian Domination, and by ſuch meanes
ſhake their ſo ſure gouernment, &amp; make it totter a litle. Againſt
whom being men well armed with ſound arguments, it were
a moſt dangerous thing for the Italians and their ſuppoſtes to
deale by way of diſputations: yet ſée they haue defenſes &amp; ramparies
to let them, for making any breach in their Domination.
Firſt to make them hold their tongues: no more but to giue
them ſome fat benefice, ſome Abbey or Priory, and to ſchoole
them a litle with this leſſon, that the veritie which they ſaie,
they know, is but poore and bare god wot, wearing but a thrid
bare coate, neuer able to make a man rich: (as it was apparant
indéed in him who was the Veritie it ſelf, hauing no place

to hide his head in:) that beſide it had the world, all Kings and
Princes of the earth for enemy. On the other ſide, he that wold
be employed for Rome, ſhe had to command all ouer ye world,
and had the beſtowing of Biſhoppricks, Abbies, Priories, and
Parſonages, to aduance and make happie all thoſe that imbraced
their part. Now of a great number few or none ſtand out
with them, but are ouercome with ſuch temptations, &amp; if there
be any that will not yéeld to them, we ſée by and by that the
Biſhops and their Officials haue them in chace, and do their
vttermoſt to inflame the Magiſtrate againſt them, to put them
to death, as did the Prieſts of the old law, againſt Helias, Ieremias,
and the reſt of the Prophets, &amp; their ſucceſſors, againſt
Chriſt. But if the Magiſtrates chance to wincke at them, the
Councell of Rome, hath cauſed Eccleſiaſticall Counſellers to
bee admitted into all Courtes of Parlament to aduiſe, ſtire vp
and inflame all Preſidents, Proctors of the King, and all other
councellours to make open warre with fire and ſword againſt
ſuch people, not without ſore charge to the Iudges, to looke vnto
them, menacing their negligence herein with double puniſhment.
By reaſon whereof, it ſhalbe heard for them to eſcape
their handes. Whereby appeareth, how great the carnall wiſedome
of this nation is, to maintaine and hold faſt their reuenues
and Domination.
         
         
            Cap. 28.
            
               The third meane whereby they fortifie thēſelues with the
Forces of three of the moſt mightieſt in al Chriſtēdome.
            
            NOt to be deſtitute of any one aide that might ſtand them
in ſtéed, they found meanes to arme themſelues with the
greateſt Forces ye Chriſten men may yéeld, when they perceiued
that by ſuch fellowes as are aboueſaid, Princes, Cities and
common weales might be puld from them, which were no fiſh
for Prouoſts, Controllers, nor Sergeants mouthes: they backed
themſelues better with the moſt ſtrong redoubtable and
puiſſant forces of all Chriſtendome, as with the K. of Spaine
for the head, with the King of France for the ſtomacke, and the
Emperour for the belly, which are the principall parts of Europe.
So that if a man open his mouth to ſpeake againſt their

Domination, you ſhall ſée the Catholike ſtraightway, thunder
downe all with his Inquiſition, &amp; euerie man haue a fling
at him. Is there any that will ſet vpon them by main ſtrength
for any other matter? Be the Lombards, Venetians, Neapolitans,
or whatſoeuer they be, they will but whiſtle at Rome,
and by and by ye ſhal ſée marching to their ſuccour the Armies
of theſe mightie Princes aboue named. But the Romans, they
will make themſelues poore when they ſhould paie them, and
recompence their trauels: they can abide nothing worſe then
that. For Childericke the King of France, for ſending them
aide, loſt the Crowne of France. And as for ſatiſfaction for any
other aide that other Kinges of France haue giuen them,
they neuer put their hand to their treaſures yet, to recompence
them: nor neuer adioyned any Duchy or kingdome to their
Empire: but haue alwaies béen pulling from them. But in recompence
of all their labours, loſſes and expences, they haue
giuen this word (THRISE) which is vſed in forming a ſuperlatiue,
to the King of France: although hée had as much
and more authoritie to take it to himſelfe, then the Romanes
to giue it him. And to the King of Spaine they haue giuen this
word (Catholike) which he might haue taken himſelfe if hée
would haue challenged it, no man to ſay nay. Theſe names
haue continued from father to ſonne, as if they came by inheritance,
by which the Italians haue plaied and wrought vpon,
as well the one as the other, as though the bare names had any
vertue or operation in them, to tranſforme the perſons, and
to make them any other then they were, which ſhould bee a
moſt manifeſt abuſe. But when that a man hath any qualitie
of great vertue or vice, he may verie fitly haue ſome name of
honour or diſhonour attributed vnto him. As S. Lewes was
ſo called for his holines of life. Philip le Bel, for his excéeding
beautie: and Philip le Hardi, for his hardines &amp; valour. But
all this cannot be tranſlated to their heires and ſucceſſors, becauſe
they are but qualities of ſpeciall perſons, and are proper
to them onely, from whom they cannot paſſe. For as it had bin
a moſt abſurd thing to haue termed Commodus an Emperour
of Rome, and a moſt cruell tyrant, a Saint and a Philoſopher,
becauſe Marcus Aurelius his father, for his rare vertues,

ſageſſe and eloquence was ſo named: ſo alſo is there none
apparent reaſon why the Councell of Rome, ſhould denominate
for flatterie, indifferently all the ſucceſſors of this crowne,
Kinges moſt Chriſtian. No more then with the Epitheton
that was giuen to Charles le grand, (1. the great.) And as for
the title of Catholike, it was falſly attributed to the King of
Spaine, becauſe it ſignifieth as much as vninerſall King: that
is, King euer all. Whereas at that time he was King only but
of the Spaines; for as yet then raigned the King of Portugall:
and beſide he is not ſo much yet neither as King ouer all
Chriſtendome. Although that ſuch Epithets haue béene verie
vnfit, &amp; falfly attributed indifferently to all: yet we ſée by ſuch
toyes and deuiſes, they haue with a wet finger drawen more
Forces to their ſuccour out of theſe kingdomes, then at this
preſent twentie millions out of any other Princes purſe, would
do out of all Germany. By giuing them only theſe names and
titles, they make them march when they liſt, vſing them like
the great Canary Dogs, which are tied faſt with a long chaine
and a coller. As for the Emperour to kéep him vnder, they haue
beſtowed on him ſome kingdome or Princedome, to make him
their owne creature and vaſſall, yet vnder the name of their
Pope, to ſet him forward, or pull him backe as they liſt, and at
their deuotion. And all this to the end, that if any went about
to ſhake or endomage their Domination at the head, hée
ſhould ſtraight aſſaile and bee ſhaken off by the Catholicke
King, if he came againſt the breaſt, the moſt Chriſtian King
ſhould trownce him, if he made at the bellie, the Emperour
ſhould teare him: ſo that he ſhould be met withall what way
ſo euer he came. Turne ouer &amp; read the Hiſtories of the memorable
actes and déeds of all nations in the world, and finde none
that euer hath ſo iuſteled Kings and Emperours by a voluntarie
Domination, to make them march, without any pay at all,
as hath done the Councell of Rome. I ſpeake not only by theſe
but by an infinit number of others, ſo he haue bin glad to obey
and follow them at all times, whenſoeuer they ſtood in néed.
         
         
            
            Cap. 29.
            
               A Demonſtration how the Councell of Rome winneth to
their ſide, Princes, younger brothers, and maketh them
their voluntarie ſlaues.
            
            BVt the ſublimation of the Italian ſpirit is remarked to flie
farre aboue all other nations of the world, herein eſpecially,
that perceiuing a few yéeres ſince, there were found many men
of great ſpirit in the Councelles of theſe Monarkes, who diſcouering
their drifts, began to counterchecke them a litle, not ſtirring
a whit at the firſt ſound of the Trumpet, comming from
Italy, as they were wont to do in times paſt, they haue made
a cunning prouiſo for this matter, drawing into their confederacie
and league, certaine younger brethren of the beſt houſes
of the Princes in Chriſtendome, who being not ſurcharged
with too much reuenues, nor too great gouernments, to imploy
themſelues, runne like ſwift footed Greyhounds at the firſt call,
that is made for them. To make them march with more then
humane expedition, they muſt be charmed with praiſes up to
the heauens, far higher then the praiſes of many of thoſe which
the Paynims held for Gods in this world. Comparing them
with the moſt worthy and valiant warriours which euer haue
béen, terming them the verie portraitures of Alexander, in
diligence and hautineſſe of courage: verie Images of Auguſtus
Caeſar, in ſubtilitie and wiſedome, and in zeale for the enlarging
and glorie of the Romane Church: true imitators of
Conſtantine the great, reſemblers of Charlemaine, and as
great warriours as euer was the Romane Fertorius, to reſiſt
and ſtand out boldly againſt all humane powers. And to ſet a
better hue on theſe ſo high commendations, if there be to be
found any externall beautie or corporall force in theſe Princes,
that muſt not be forgotten in no wiſe, but extolled to the ninth
degrée: likewiſe, for the antiquitie of their houſes, the great
Alliances with other Princes, the noble and famous acts of all
their predeceſſours, all this muſt be curiouſly dilated, not one
little forgotten. And beſides, to paſſe them vp with the winde

of ſuch vaine praiſes, and to eleuate their courage aboue al that
is vnder Luna, they forget not to abaſe and diſgrace as much
as they can, the ſpirit, courage, and valour of theſe thrée great
ones, of whome I ſpake but now, as though they had not the
wit to enterpriſe any great exploites of armes: as though they
had no magnanimitie, diligence, force nor wiſedome at all, to
execute ſuch matters: notwithſtanding the place and dignitie
they kéepe, and the great meanes they haue in their power: but
they if they had their roome, it were inough to make them become
Monarkes of the whole world. The verie breath of theſe
ſo high commendations, doth ſo ſet on fire all the parts of their
ſoule and bodie, that it ſerueth them for winges to flie when
they go about any affaires for the Councell of Rome; who for
their part, to the ende to giue them féete to ſtaie and ſtand ſurely
vpon, muſt not forget to aduertiſe them, that if they haue any
brethren or children, they may promote them to the dignitie
of Cardinals, ſo that they ſhalbe ſure to haue as much Eccleſiaſticall
reuenue as their backe will beare, ſo they may fill
their houſes full of coine, which had but in meane quantitie before.
Now euerie one may thinke, that whileſt they go about
theſe things, Courſers of Naples, Damaſco ſwordes, plumes
of feathers, and precious ſtones, the rareſt and deareſt are alſo
preſented them, as thoſe only who are worthie to poſſeſſe them.
But aboue all, when they vnderſtand that all that ſhalbe their
owne that they can conqueſt, which is temporall, and that the
Italians paſſe not but for the ſpirituall, then they are ſet on fire
with an inextinguible zeale. Then appeares there ſuch a ſodein
chaunge, and ſtraunge metamorphoſis in theſe Princes, that a
man would thinke that ſome new ſoule had entered into their
bodie, and diſpoſſeſſed and chaſed out that which ruled there before:
for then treading vnder foote the naturall affection, that
they bore to their countrie, their ſwéete mother, who hath
brought them vp tenderly, and nouriſhed them more delitiouſly
then all others: then farewell the homage and loyaltie belonging
to thoſe whom God hath ſet in place for their ſuperiours,
and the ſtraight bond of amitie towards all their kindreds and
auncient friends, without any regard of thoſe, who haue béen
their planke to preferre them to ſo high degrée and ranke of honour

which they poſſeſſe, ſuch younger brethren, neglecting the
oath giuen to their Prince, tranſported with a moſt vnquenchable
heate, and zeale, without all gouernment of reaſon, caſt
themſelues headlong to embraſe the affaires and practiſes of the
Roman Councel, with ſo violent affection, yt all their thoughts,
diſcourſes, and imaginations, are occupied in nothing els, but
ſtill how to continue the ſame. So that the feruent zeale to aduance
the Roman Domination, doth conſume and gnaw them
night and day: falling into ſuch diſquietneſſe for the furthering
therof, that they haue not ſo much as the patience to abide any
good aduertiſements. But like as they were tranſformed into
more naturall Romanes; ſet their wits to deuiſe a thouſande
things for their good and conſeruation: refuſing not to ſuſtaine
all perils and daungers of bodie and goods, all watchings &amp; trauels
for their ſake. Making no doubt of conſcience to ſet kingdomes
and prouinces any waies on fire: either by working
their ruine by their owne armes, or by forraine Forces, or to
do worſe, to ſtirre vp théeues and murtherers, who by treaſon
and at vnawares, do ſhed the blood of thoſe, who kéepe themſelues
faſt locked within townes, cauſing all lawes and bonds
(both diuine and humane) of amitie and conſanguinitie to bée
violated, perſuading themſelues that ſuch butchery &amp; murther,
may any way aduance the Italians: or els that ſuch cruelties
ſhould be to them onely ſacrificers of ſwéete ſauour, and ſeruices
moſt agréeable. Sée then ye arrows that be readie drawne,
made by this moſt ingenious nation, to the ruine and confuſion
of thoſe, who dare once open their mouthes to ſpeake againſt
their profits or Domination.
         
         
            Cap. 30.
            
               Begging Friars ſent abroad and emploied by the Romans,
to ſet vpon thoſe that dare open their mouthes againſt
their Domination.
            
            THe Councell of Rome hauing long time found that many
Cardinals, Biſhops, and Colledges did not ſtir at the
firſt word, that they hard from Rome, to ſet vpon Princes and

commonweales, although they were their own creatures double
bound vnto them: firſt hauing ben aduanced by Kings and
princes by their leaue, &amp; next, for feare to looſe the faireſt fethers
that they weare. They inuent, or howſoeuer giue place to other
kinde of fellowes, which they receiue into the number of
Cleargy men, that will make no ſuch delaie as the other: I
meane their begging Friars, a moſt laborious kind of people,
ſupporting all trauel and paine, and doing ſo much good abroad,
that they will ſwell out incontinent, and haue at a baie thoſe
that do but thinke any euill againſt the kingdome of the Romiſh
Conſtitutions. Let them hide themſelues neuer ſo well,
they are ſure to be drawne out of their dennes by this kennell,
who can open and diſcouer ſo well, that in the twinkeling of an
eye, they will ſet in an vprore all Chriſtendome, exclaime againſt
Kings, Princes, and peoples, yea, againſt Biſhops and
all other Cleargy men, that will not execute their reſolutions
and commandements. Greatnes nor highnes cannot amaze
theſe fellowes, they will ſpeake their pleaſure, and that which
is in their heades, what ſoeuer come of it. Neither feare they
that their Prebends be taken from them, or that any other fine
be ſet on their head: for there is no more to be gotten of them,
then of the ſhauing of an Eg-ſhell. Beſides, they néed neither
gold nor ſiluer by the way to ſpend, for their lodgings are prouided
before where they ſhalbe relieued without a penny coſt,
neither feare they any confiſcation of their goods, nor that any
infamy fall vpon their children, for that they haue none at all.
Sée how they may be bold with all ſecuritie, to ſpeake any contumelious
reproches, and ignonimious ſlanders on Princes,
outraging them in their perſons, caring not a point, &amp; making
a ſmall matter to do it.
         
         
            Cap. 31.
            
               Of the ſeruice of Ieſuites, to blinde the youth withall, to
the end to make them adore the Italian inuentions.
            
            BVt becauſe this great rabble had not taken vpon them the
inſtruction of youth, wherin certaine learned Schoolemaiſters
being emploied, diſcouered many things to the great

diminiſhing of the Romane authoritie, to make vp this breach,
the Italians brought in Ieſuites of farre profounder learning
then the begging Friars, and with the ſame haue peopled the
moſt famous Vniuerſities of Chriſtendome, who being ſo
much followed by ſtudentes, take no hire of them that heare
them, contenting themſelues only with the gaine of their penſioners.
They hold opinion, that the Biſhop of Rome is aboue
the Conſuls, by this meane altogither ouerthrowing the authoritie
thereof. As for their Diſciples, they tie them ſo faſt by
the héeles, with the cords of the Italian ſuperſtitions, that they
put them in ſuch feare that they tremble againe, if they tranſgreſſe
the leaſt of them neuer ſo litle: and the more eaſily to
ſtrike this feare into their hearts, they robbe the tender youth
of all iudgement and vſe of reaſon. For to iudge truly of anie
queſtion in controuerſie, we muſt diligently heare and weigh
the reaſons on both ſides, all affection laide apart. Theſe on the
contrarie, hauing brought their Diſciples to belieue in the Catholike
and Romane Church, they conclude thus thereupon,
that they ſtop their hearing, and giue none eare to any one,
who ſoeuer dare ſpeake againſt the Popes authoritie, nor againſt
the ceremonies which he hath inſtituted, nor dare once
ſo much as to reade any booke, which may call them in doubt,
as not altogither neceſſary to ſaluation: and that he which feareth
the plague, ought to flie from ſuch places &amp; perſons which
are infected: ſo they before all thinges muſt take héede, not to
heare any, nor receiue any bookes which may go about to remoue
them from their opinion in one iote. Theſe are their
propper foundations and grounds, whereby they do not onely
depriue their Diſciples of all iudgement, but alſo of the vſe of all
their natural ſences, wherwith God hath indued man to make
choice of things, and to know how to put a difference betwéen
good and bad: by this meanes, they make them not onely dull
ſpirited; but altogither as brutiſh beaſts in heauenly and diuine
things, fighting directly againſt the inſtruction of S. Paul, who
teacheth vs to proue all things, praiſing in this place of ſcripture,
the diligence of thoſe that did examine the Prophecies, to
know if Chriſt were the true Meſſias. And whereas the Prophets
did not ceaſe to exclaime againſt the abuſe of the Sacrificators

and Prieſts of the olde law: S. Iohn Baptiſt in like
maner: Chriſt alſo the ſoueraigne Prophet, the Apoſtles who
euer cried out againſt the falſe paſtors. And S. Auguſtin complaining
of the multitude of ceremonies which were entred into
the Church at his time: and beſides we haue ſéene heretofore
many Biſhops, Doctors and Paſtors do the ſame in contemning
the greateſt part of them. Theſe on the other ſide, hold
all good, and maintaine them, not onely ouer &amp; aboue the word
of God: but further thē this, beſide ye word of God. By reaſon
wherof, if the Catholikes looke not about them, to beſtir themſelues
otherwiſe then they haue done ſince the entrance &amp; creation
of theſe Ieſuites, to ſhake off the yoke of the Italian Domination,
it will ſoone be reſtabliſhed in the higheſt degrées of
ſoueraintie that euer was ſince it began. And there ſhalbe neither
King nor Prince be he neuer ſo ſtrong nor mightie, but
the Romans will make him tremble at one winke of their eye:
and will put them in as bad feare as the poore Iſraelites were
at the publication of the Law, when they ſhall threaten them
with the thundrings &amp; lightnings of their Romiſh excommunications,
to diſcharge all their ſubiects of the oath of their loyaltie,
to inueſt others with their kingdomes and principalities,
ſo that the Italians ſhall triumph ouer them, as they did ouer
the Duke of Venice, trailing him with a cord about his neck,
for his diſobedience to their Romiſh Biſhop.
         
         
            Cap. 32.
            
               A brief refutation of the Ieſuites.
            
            BVt whoſoeuer would not make himſelfe obſtinat againſt
his owne good and ſaluation, might eaſily helpe himſelfe
out of theſe Ieſuits halters, ſetting before his eyes how that
they alledge things contrary to that which they profeſſe &amp; cauſe
to be executed indéed. For this is the ſumme of their Doctrins,
that euery one moſt firmly abide in his owne Religion, without
hearing any thing to the contrary, and neuertheleſſe they
haue enflamed the Spanyards to kill thouſands and Millions
of the new world, becauſe they would not change there Religion,

to embrace another. And as it is proper to ſhifters, deceauers,
and thoſe that haue not loyall Marchandiſes, to deale
in ſecret, aſmuch as they can, and cloſely to couer there action,
to ſell there ware in darke places, to thende to kéepe the truth
of the matter hidden, leſt their abuſe ſhould bée diſcouered: ſo
theiſe which feare ſo much the examination of their Doctryne
conuince themſelues, that it is not ſownde, nor allowable.
Whereas that man that ſéeketh but the glorie of God, withont
any reſpect of any Domination, or wordly profit, will take
ſingular pleaſure, ſéeing his Doctrine examined by the worde
of God, and with the workes that he hath created, and likewiſe
be delighted to maintayne and defend it againſt whoſoeuer
would diſpute to the contrarie. For all this, this would neuer
the Church of Rome permit, her pollocie is ſo great herein,
albeit Italy is repleniſhed with a great number of verie
learned men and great Schollers, as well in Philoſophy as in
any of the lawes: and very deſirus to maintayne any diſpute
againſt heretikes, (as the tearme them) who are ſo themſelues,
to giue them their right title and definition, and againſt all
thoſe that goe about to diminiſh or ſpeake againſt there kingdome
and gaines, for that the repute not others for ſuch. For
the are not ſo groſſe witted as the Almons, who diſpute about
the Conſubſtantiation and Infinity of the bodie of Chriſt againſt
the confeſſion of the Switzers and Frenchmen, without
hope of any profit or Domination to bee gotten thereby:
But the Italian ſmelling out any profit or gaine in that which
is propounded, he will agrée to all, and repugne onely in that
whereby he thinketh to receaue any dommage. Which is a
moſt cleare and manifeſt proof that there is nothing, but worldly
wiſedome in all that he pretendeth and goeth about.
         
         
            Cap. 33.
            
               The councell of Rome is like to certaine Petifogging layers,
who will not conſent to haue there cauſes diſputed
and heard in open audience.
            
            
               
TO make this more apparent, we muſt note that when
the councel of Rome, wil neuer accord to haue there cauſe
defended in any open audience againſt there aduerſaries, what
other thing thereby may be inferred, but that they ſecretly
yéeld that there cauſe is ſcant good, for the are not ſo groſſe
witted, nor ſo much blinded, as the Ieſuiſtes Schollers of
whome I ſpeake euen now: but as crafty Layers of good
meanes and habilityes, finding there low matters like to goe
againſt them, prolong the indgement and curry fauour with
the Iudges as much as the can: yet ſéeing the plantifes ſue
them hard, they will labour tooth and nayle to referre there
cauſe to thoſe of the counſell, hoping by fauour and inſtance of
them, they may ſoner win there proceſſe, then in any open audience.
And if the perceaue that all this doe not auayle, what
will the doe? the will hyer ſome manſlayer, to kill there aduarſarie
by ſome villanous treacherye: euen ſo this counſell ſo
crafty &amp; politick, vnderſtanding of an aſſembly of ſtates, or any
general day of hearing, ether in Germanie, France, or Spaine
the ſend in continent thether, and what by fauour and corrupting
with bribes, the will vſe the matter ſo, that nothing ſhall
there be debated, which concerneth any way the kingdome of
Rome: vnleſſe it tende to the aduauncement and furtherance
of their Domination. And if therebe any Chancellours or other
learned perſonages, who haue authoritie and meane to
moderate and order matters as they would haue, they are ſaluted
with congratulations, and promiſes of great rewardes,
and by that meanes wonne to their ſide. As for murthers, they
haue ſpilled more humane blood ſince Iohn Hue Bohemian
roſe vp in armes, to challenge his Domination againſt them,
then all the quarrels and manquellers ſince Noes flood, in all
the broyles, brawles and quarrels that they haue made. Take
onely but the battels that they cauſed to be giuen by the Emperours
againſt the Bohemians, and againſt the Almans: the
perſecutions in England, the warres of France and Flanders,
and all thoſe that the cruell and bloodie Inquiſition hath
deſtroied, both in Italy and Spaine: and the ſlaughters that
haue béen in many townes of France, and in many other places
by their meanes onely, and you ſhall finde that they are

cauſe of the death of more then a million of men: and woemen:
and all becanſe the would kéepe there cauſe from debating in
Parlaments and nationall Councells. Whereby we ſée they
hane all deuiſes and craftes in their heads ſo ready, which may
ſerue them to preſerue their Gouernment &amp; continue their purloyning
of mony from other nations: who in no wiſe can come
neere them to practize any ſuch ſubtilties, they are ſo groſſe,
and ſuch ſléepy heades, that their is none amongſt but the beſt
ſpirits, not ſubiect to be paſſionate, who can diſcouer there iugling,
and fine conueances.

               The breefe confutation of a Peſtifrous booke, publiſhed
in France, by the name of (the Catholike Engliſhman).
            
            THis nation and there partners enuiyng the Gouernment
of the good French, who being wearied with ſo many troubles
and miſeries, were amiably vnited to liue peaceablly together,
Catholikes and Proteſtants, the borrow the Eloquence
of ſome Italionate Frenchman, who falſely termeth himſelfe
the Catholike Engliſhman, abuſing the true vſe of this gift
by the which (as Caecero ſaith) men which were altogether
rude, ruſticall, cruell and ſauage are tranſformed into a
more ſwéete and ſocyable nature, to vſe it as a trumpet and
torch to giue allarum, and to kindle the burning coles of choller,
and vengeance in the herts of all Catholikes to make them
run headlong into heat and rage of ſtomack like vnto a Bare
rauiſhed of her whelpes, to ſack and deſtroye all thoſe who dare
open there mouthes againſt the Italian Domination, vnder
the name of Popes: caring not by this pernicious councell to
make all Chriſtendome ſo weake: that it might without great
reſiſtance be inuaded of the Turckes, to aboliſh the name and
remembrances of all Chriſten people for euer: for by his councell
hée goeth about to make the Catholikes beléeue, that it
ſhall ſuffice them to flie like dogs vpon the Hugonots, to
pull out there throates to rout out there names, and to vanquiſh
them quite for euer: But this there curſed, craftie and

captious councell, hath not had ſuch iſſue as they would haue
wiſhed or looked for: it hath but abridg the life and haſtened
the death of thoſe that firſt tooke it in hand as namely of the
Duke De Ioyeuſe, and the Lord de Saint Sauueur they bée
moſt affectionate partners, with great ignominie and diſhonour
of ſo ſhamefull a flight of ſo many, who accompanied them
both in there actions: As alſo with the great reproch. diſgrace
and ouerthrowe of men giuen to the Duke, De Aumalde
and all his toupes at the battell of Senlis, without ſpeaking of
fiue or ſix armies beſide, which without euer ſtriking ſtroke
by ſickneſſe and long trauels ruined of themſelues. Beſides
the Pariſians inflamed and bloodily bent to deſtroye ſome bodie
els then the Catholike Engliſhman ſhot at, haue gotten
but trauels, troubles, and ineſtimable charges by their malice,
hauing ſuffred the enimie to come and beate them into there
owne gates, to ſaiſe vpon there néereſt townes, with out euer
lending ayde to any. And further then all this, they haue ſéene
there owne ſuborbes pillaged, and there forces, which the
iudged inuincible, deſtroyed before there faces, at the battell of
Yury being in chaunted by the venimous and peſtilent Eloquence,
both of there pernicius Engliſhman, and alſo by the
blooddy ſermons of one Francis Pinſenac very like vnto this
falſe and pretended Catholike, vnleſſe as I may geſſe it be the
very man himſelfe, or his familiar frende of Orleans that hath
put forth this blooddy booke: which may rauiſh and quite cary
away with the force of his liuely Eloquence agreat part of the
Catholikes that reade it, to enterpriſe the ſlaughter and manquelling
of thoſe, who doe not adore all that commeth from
Italy, Where I might ſpare it if any good had euer come to
Fraunce by it, or by any that are imployed on that parte. But
ſéeing that it ſéemeth that this nation is created for the ſcourge
and extreme ruine of the more Northren people, when he taketh
ſo their parte, making it good to the vtter ruine and ouerthrow
of vs all. Doth he not diſcouer, that he beléeueth neither
hell nor heauen? But is a villanous Atheiſt prefering the
worldly profit and honour, which he draweth from this partie
before the loue of his countrie, for the which as Caecero,
ſayth, Euerie honeſt man ought not to refuſe death. And

not as this wretch, to haſten it ruine. O verie rare &amp; ſéede of a
viper: who ſéemeſt not to haue bine borne for any other good,
but the deſtrution of thy Countrie, which thou oughteſt to
loue more deréely then thine own life. O pernicions Phiſition,
whoſe Pheſike is an hundred times more dangerous then
the malladie it ſelfe: who in ſtéede of a gentle purgation
miniſtres Antimoyne not prepared, &amp; ranke poyſon, making
thy ſelfe ignorant, that ſéeing a ſect is ſo farre growen, that it
is able to holde out by ware, and that it cannot be rooted out
by publike Iuſtice, how it muſt bée left and referred to the Diuine
Iuſtice &amp; not to kindle a cyuill warre there vpon, which
doth but kil and corrupt men and bring al Religions to naught
beeing the greateſt plague and the extremeſt callamitie, into
which men may run thēſelues hedlong. But out of what ſchole
hath he ſet this his blooddy and tragicall doctrine? Not out of
this great and faithfull law giuer Moyſes, who ſaith Thou
ſhalt not kill: nor out of the Royall prophet Dauid, councelling
men To flie from euill and doe good, ſeeke peace
and enſue it: Nor out of the other prophets, who haue endured
greuous perſecutions, and neuer moued any of ther diſſiples to
perſecute againe or take any vengeance at all, nor of all the
ſectes of philoſophers, as of Socrates, Plato, Pythagoras,
Ariſtotle, and others, who alwayes laboured all the could to
wine men to peace, quietnes, goodnes, gentilnes, and mildnes
whereas this fellow will imprinte in there hartes all rage, crueltie,
outrage and madnes: whereby appeareth, that he is a
very limme and inſtrument of this olde and ſubtile Dragon,
who made Cayne conceaue in his harte the murther of his
owne brother Abell, the ſame which moued the preiſts of Ieruſalem,
vnnaturally to ſawe in twayne in the middeſt, this
heauenly and diuine Prophet Eſaye, and to perſecute the proceſſe
and condemnation of Ieremie, He ſheweth himſelfe ſeton
by a more blooddy ſpirit, then euer were Marius and Silla,
who ſhed ſo much of there owne Citizens boodes: but rather
more like to Phalaris, Catiline, Nero, Commodus, and other
ſuch cruell and ſaluage beaſtes, al together voyde of all humanitie
towardes there owne countrymen. His ſhameleſſe
impudencie, and his ſo inſatiable thirſt after blood, is ſo apparant

that it is not to be hid: for he repreſenteth himſelfe as a
Standerbarer of Chriſts catholike church, who ought to here
his voyce, and doe after his commandements: who pronounceth
in the fifth of S. Mathewes Goſpell that The mercifull,
pittifull, and peace makers are bleſſed, and that we muſt
forgiue, if we wilbe forgiuen. And the Apoſtle S. Paule
writing to the Romans teacheth vs To haue peace withall
men, without taking any vengeance, which belong onely
to God: And that if our enimie hunger we ſhonld giue him to
eate, and if he thirſt we ſhould giue him drinke, ſurmounting
his malice, by our mildnes and mercy. And laſt of all S. Iohn
in his firſt Catholike Epiſtle, ſaith, That he which hateth
his brother is in Darkenes, and cannot tell whether hee
goeth, becauſe the Darknes hath put out his eyes.
            
         
         
            Cap. 35.
            
               How this falſe Catholike Engliſhman voide of all
humanitie, transformeth himſelfe into all
crueltie and rage.
            
            SOme were then to examine this bloodie booke, wherewith
he would infect all Chriſtendome, with the rage and rancor
that poſſeſſeth his furious ſtomack, wherby he goeth about
to ſet the people of France togither by the eares, to deſtroy one
another, like fierce Dragons and cruell Tygers, it argueth his
cowardly, moſt daſtard &amp; effeminate ſpirit, for theſe are things
that are neuer in a man that hath any magnanimitie or greatnes
of courage in him: Wherein he ſheweth that he is the verie
diſciple and trumpet of the maligne ſpirit the diuell, that in
ſhape of a filthie and ſtinking hée-Goat, vſeth the like ſpéeches
vnto ſorcerers &amp; witches, who hauing forſaken Ieſus Chriſt,
go vnto his ſabboths to do him homage, where he giueth them
none other leſſons, but to put in practiſe vengeance, murthers,
and cruelties, whoſe footeſteps he followeth right, pretending

to ouerthrow in man all the cléere light of reaſon and vnderſtanding,
&amp; vtterly to extinguiſh that which maketh him foreſée
in his actions, whether they tende to his honour, profit, and
ſecuritie or no, before he vndertake them, to abſe and make
him ſtoupe to blinde beaſtlie and furious paſſions, ſo to make
men flie one at another like mad dogs &amp; cruel beaſts, when we
ſée any aduantage of the ſide that we take: for his drift is, to
make the Catholikes roote out the Hugonots, as a people
not to be tollerated in religion: yet there is no people vnder
heauen that agreeth ſo well with them as they: be the Iewes,
Turkes, or Tartarians, againſt whom thou ſhouldeſt rather
ſcum of the froth of thy furie and heate to combat, and employ
the floud and force of thine eloquence, then conſpiring the total
ruine of Chriſtians, againſt thoſe who receiue and allow of all
the bookes of the Bible, &amp; the foure firſt Councels, with whom
hauing none other quarrell but for humane Conſtitutions,
thou oughteſt rather to take part. And furthermore I ſay, that
the trueſt and beſt Catholikes and Proteſtantes, are for the
moſt part the ſureſt and beſt friends that any Citie or common
wealth hath, &amp; there is but the Cockle which groweth among
this good wheate, and other dogs and hogs, who ſmelling out
any commodious profite by the Italians and their ſuppoſes:
much like himſelfe, who for rewarde of his forged crimes and
lies: ſmelleth out ſome Croſiers ſtaffe, miter, or Abby, vnder a
falſe maſke and ſhew of religion, paſſing not to be recogniſhed
for the true ſonne of the father of lies, and auncient ſlaunderer
the diuell, when maliciouſly and vntruly he bringeth the mightie
Princeſſe Elizabeth, for an example of wonderfull crueltie
againſt Catholikes, to make our French Nation conceiue a
great hatred and feare of our King: wherein I thinke, that his
father the diuel would haue béen aſhamed himſelfe to haue publiſhed
ſuch impudent lies, for as much as this gracious Princeſſe
the Quéene of England, and our King of France, whom
he repreſenteth as her imitator: haue neuer béen accuſed of any
blame and reproach, but to haue béen too mercifull and pittifull
towards ſuch peſtiferous mates, and ſeditious ſpirits, as is hée
himſelfe, whom I ſhould haue made knowne for the moſt pernicious
and damnable enemy of all Chriſtendome, that euer

was on any ſide whatſoeuer, as him that hath faſtened the authour
of his hope vpon a particular and temporall commoditie,
caring nothing at all to be cauſe of the ſubuerſion of the common
weale, and to depriue himſelfe of life euerlaſting. But becauſe
I am preuented by others that haue anſwered the booke,
I will not enter further to confute any particularitie thereof. I
thinke now by a moſt manifeſt and briefe deſcription, I haue
ſet before the face of the Readers, as wel the meanes as inſtruments,
by the which the Italians know how brauely to conſerue
and maintaine their Domination, to the great ſhame and
diſhonour of thoſe that are ſubiected thereunto as ſlaues: wherfore
it is now conuenient to manifeſt and propound the remedies,
by the which all noble and gentle ſpirites, louers of their
owne libertie, may eaſily deliuer themſelues from their ſlauery
and thraldome.
         
         
            Cap. 36.
            
               The firſt remedy, by ouerthrowing the foundation ſtone,
vpon the which the Romane Domination is builded.
            
            AS it were a ſmal matter for a Phiſition to be able brauely
to diſcourſe of the cauſes, beginnings, augmentation
and nature of any diſeaſe, if he ſhould not giue remedies to cure
the ſame: ſo it ſhalbe requiſite to ſet downe the meane whereby
men might as well in times paſt, as alſo hereafter, throw away
this Italian yoke, &amp; kéep their mony in their purſes, without
enriching ſtrangers with it: for this matter, I will begin
at the foundation ſtone, vpon the which they haue built, augmented
and eleuated there ſo great and loftie Dominatious,
that it hath no boundes here on the face of the earth, as haue
the kingdomes and empires of Emperours and Kings: but being
eleuated (if we will belieue them) as high as heauen gates,
ſhutteth &amp; openeth them euen as they do the doores of the Conſiſtorie
at Rome. In ſome this foundation ſtone is, that Saint
Peter had his Apoſtles ſeate at Rome, and there was martired:
whereof followeth, that the Romane Biſhop is his ſucceſſour,
and hath vniuerſall charge ouer the whole world. For

the firſt I deny, ſéeing that neither the Acts of the Apoſtles, nor
any other of the Epiſtles of S. Paul, hath made mention therof:
&amp; that he himſelfe witneſſeth that he was the Apoſtle of the
Iewes, called to thoſe that were of the circumciſion. For the ſecond,
yt he was martired there I cōfeſſe, for that thoſe of Rome
and their Emperours, to make a triumph of Ieſus Chriſt,
and of his doctrine, &amp; to quench their inſatiable crueltie againſt
Chriſtians, had cauſed S. Peter to be tranſported to Rome,
from another place where he was detained firſt priſoner, to put
him to death ignonimiouſly, and make him a publike ſpectacle
to the world. But for hauing by this crueltie and iniuſtice, depriued
the world of ſo famous &amp; excellent ſeruant of God, that
they ſhould be reputed his ſucceſſours, there is no reaſon at all:
nay contrarie, I will ſtand to it, they ought therfore altogither
to be diſinherited: for was there euer any man ſo impudent,
that for hauing murthered another, would dare to challendge
his ſucceſſion? And if he had béen borne at Rome, and appointed
Apoſtle to the ſame place, which he was not, neither they
haue made themſelues vnworthie of all ſucceſſorie, right and
title. For this were a prettie matter, that for vſing all crueltie,
and committing bloodie murthers againſt the ſeruants of God,
men ſhould get domination and principalitie, as well in earth
as in heauen, it were farre wide to ſay ſo, and the greateſt abſurditie
in the world, that men might imagine. Nay contrarie,
Chriſt menaceth great puniſhment for the like matter, when
he cried out, Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, thou which killeſt the
Prophets, thereby denouncing her ruine and ouerthrow by
the fire of Gods vengeance, foretelling her deſtructiō to come,
and the miſerable eſtate wherein ſhe is at this preſent houre.
If then this were ſufficient to depriue Rome of her ſucceſſion,
yet furthermore, were ſhe worthie to be depriued for her rebellion
againſt the Goſpell, and the doctrine of S. Peter, wherein
ſhe hath perſeuered ſince the death &amp; paſſion of Chriſt, hauing
brought foorth the moſt deteſtable monſters for Emperours,
as Tyberius, Nero, Calligula, Commodus, and Heliogabalus,
which haue euer béen remarked to liue vnder the vaute
of the heauens: who as cruell beaſts eſtranged and degenerat
from all Chriſtian blood, by reaſon of ye enormitie of their liues,

could not ſuffer any ſuch cleare light to ſhine there néere them,
being alſo ſet on by their ſacrificing Prieſts, Pagans, and Idolaters,
who only taught publikely at Rome, ſoone to extinguiſh
the ſame. But if there were any good Biſhops there, they laie
cloſe, and did not openly diſcouer themſelues, and were no part
of the bodie of this people, being indéed ſent thither, from diuers
other partes: perſonages of great learning and eloquence, rather
to make reſidence there, then in any other part, for that
this citie was ſtil repleniſhed with learned men, cunning Philoſophers,
and Pagan Oratours: againſt whome it had not
béen for Paſtors meanely learned to haue diſputed without ouerthrow
and conuiction. Yet all this hath nothing eleuated
the Italians, aboue any other people of Chriſtentie, for hauing
Domination ouer them, but rather it bringeth lower and abaſeth
them, as a teſtimonie of their great reſiſtance and rebellion
to the truth, and the teachers thereof.
         
         
            Cap. 37.
            
               Conſtantine the Great, King of England, appoſed himſelf
againſt the tyrannous perſecutours of Chriſtians, that
Italy brought forth.
            
            BVt if ye come to aſke me, what Nation hath more right
to haue the Sea of an vniuerſall Biſhop erected in it, then
Italy? I anſwere, that as Italy hath made it ſelfe vnworthie,
by bringing forth the murtherers of S. Peter, and of other tyrannous
and perſecuting Emperors, hauing a long time made
reſiſtance to the Goſpell: ſo thoſe haue beſt deſerued it, who
being puſhed forward with an holie zeale of Gods glorie, and
of the ſaluation of men, hauing abandoned their liues, kingdomes,
and treaſures, to make paſſage for the Goſpel throughout
the whole worlde, in deſtroying the doctrines of Pagans,
and all idolatry which had raigned before, more then two thouſand
yéeres, all ouer the world, except only among the Iewes.
Now what nation hath that béen, of ſo hautie and magnanimous
courage, which hath done God ſo ſignall a péece of ſeruice.
Surely it was England, which hauing brought forth that

great, and thriſe ſacred Conſtantine, who of a Pagan that hée
was, making profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, and receiuing
Baptiſme, ſtraight began to warre vpon Maxentius the Romane
Emperour, a moſt cruell murtherer, and a great perſecutor
of Chriſtians, whome he vanquiſhed, and planted the
true Goſpell and kingdome of Chriſt, not onely in the Ile, his
natiue countrie that bred him; but alſo at Rome, the receptacle
of all Idolatrie, and from thence made paſſage for it vnto
Alexandria, the capitall Citie of all Affrica, to Conſtantinople,
and all that countrie bordering towards Aſia, enlarging
the kingdome of the ſonne of God, farre and wide (which
ſéemed at that time to be baniſhed out of this worlde, by the
continuall warres of the Romans) deſtroying and ouerthrowing
whereſoeuer he went, that of Sathan, ſhewing himſelfe to
be the Executour of that which Ieſus Chriſt had foretold in the
twelfth of S. Iohn, ſaying: Now is the iudgement of this
world, now ſhall the Prince of this world be caſt out. O
that the wonder of thy holie and almoſt diuine enterpriſes, do
make thée go farre beyond all humane creatures? for the light
that thou madeſt to ſhine in the world, ſurmounteth as much
that of the holie Kings of the old Teſtament, as doth the light
of the Sunne, the cléernes of the Moone. And as for that which
the Apoſtles and other faithfull Paſtors which went before
thée, it was alwaies diuined, and entermingled with the darknes
of ſuperſtitious Idolaters, which had full courſe among the
Emperours and Kings of the earth: but thou great Inſtrument
of the Eternall, thou haſt chaced farre out of thy ſight,
all the ſacrifices &amp; ſeruices that men did dedicate vnto the diuil,
according to the witnes of S. Paul, who ſaith, that the Gentiles
did ſacrifice vnto him. And more then this, it is thou great
Monarke, that haſt ſo firmely planted and eſtabliſhed this light
in the world, that what aſſaults ſo euer haue béen made to extinguiſh
it, yet could it neuer altogither be put out and defaced.
If then one ſo great and diuine a benefite had procéeded from
Rome, as is from England, who could imagine how great
prerogatiues and honours almoſt diuine, they would challenge
from other people, whereas neuertheles the Emperour ſprung
out of Italy, haue euer béen the moſt ſignall perſecuters of Ieſus

Chriſt, and of his Martirs: for all that they haue caſt ſuch
cloudes ouer the eyes &amp; iudgement of other peoples, that they
made themſelues onely déemed worthie to haue the Sea of the
vniuerſall Biſhop: and by meanes of this prerogatiue, haue
made all the Kings &amp; Princes of the earth, kiſſe the Pantofle
of their Prelate and Biſhop. What would they haue done, I
pray you, if they had fought as much for the aduancement of
the Goſpell, as they haue done for the ſuppreſſion and extinguiſhing
thereof? It is verie likely they would haue exacted honours
and homages, more then diuine of thoſe which ſhould
liue vnder the obeiſance of their Domination. For this nation
craueth neuer ſo litle ſubiect to worke vpon, to make it ſelfe to
be wondred at, and to bring the Septentrionall &amp; Occidentall
peoples vnder their coram and ſubiection, for that they are
people leſſe ingenious, and nothing to compare ſo ſubtil as they
are, which is a thing altogither ſtraunge and wonderfull.
         
         
            Cap. 38.
            
               An example of the Italians ſubtill dealing with the Admirall
of Caſtillon.
            
            FOr manifeſt proofe hereof, I ſhall not néede to ſéeke out but
one onely familiar example, well knowne of all, of the deceaſed
Admirall of Caſtillon, who was reputed a man of as great
counſell &amp; experience, as was any in France: But the Quéenmother
and her Councel of Italians, hauing a quarrell at him
aboue all other, made it well knowne, that the beſt French
pollicie and craft, could hardly auoyd the ſubtill ſnares and embuſcadoes
of the Italians. For ſéeing that by force of armes,
they could neuer preuaile to vanquiſh or ouerthrow him, they
reſolued to prouide for him, baites of peace and truce: by the
firſt concluſion whereof, they ſeiſed into their owne handes, all
the Cities, Caſtles, and all the munition that was in them,
which al the Forces of Italy, had not bin able to take in twentie
yéeres. Perceiuing this, they deuiſe to ſet againe vpon the
Prince of Condie and him, as perſons deſtitute of refuge, to
retire themſelues, with any Forces, but yet the Lord De la

Noue, by his great wiſedome and accuſtomed valour, ſtood in
ſome good ſteed here, hauing ſeiſed againe the towne of Orleans
into his handes: they perceiuing the Army of this Prince
raunging almoſt in the hart of France againe, ſtraight iudged,
that they had halfe taken them napping alreadie by this hooke,
and that they might hereafter verie well ouertake them. Hauing
caſt this hooke to them the ſecond time, they ſurpriſe them
once more: and ſo diſpoſſeſſe them quite by this bait of a ſecond
peace, of all their ſtrong Forts and holdes once againe. Wherby
many began greatly to miſtruſt them: but to take away
all ſuſpition, they practiſe quickly a confirmation of their
former peace, by concluſion of a marriage, by this vtterly to
ruine and cut the Admirals throat. He truſting to it, was taken
in the net that was laide for him. So that this may well
ſhew, that all our ſubtilitie is but a ſluggiſh ſlight, in compariſon
of the quicke carriage of the Italians, by reaſon that their
clymate is more Meridionall, and the region of France more
Septentrionall. True it is, that this great workeman of the
world, hathenriched thoſe that inhabite the more Northren
countries, with many other goodly gifts, as to be more ſtrong,
more faire and luſtie, witnes many great Philoſophers &amp; learned
men, and this might ſerue vs for inſtruction, that ſéeing we
are endued with more ſtrength, and are the greater number,
we ſhould chace them out of France, and not ſuffer them to vſurpe
any Domination ouer vs at all, nor to accompany any of
our Princes or great Lordes, that might trouble or alter our
ſtate. This is a verie good preſeruatiue to ſaue and deliuer our
ſelues from their wiles and ſubtill ſlightes. Verie true it is, that
it is a great ſhame for them who name themſelues Chriſtians,
and haue béen baptized to vſe ſo much treacherie in their dealings,
whereas their aunceſtours who were but Pagans, and
knew not God, did kéepe their faith inuiolable to all, to bee a
greater credite vnto them in all their actions whatſoeuer.
         
         
            
            Cap. 39.
            
               How the Biſhop of Rome being created vniuerſall, other
nations ſhould not ſuffer the Italians to haue him only
to themſelues.
            
            LEt vs come now to the point I ſpake of, how that I did
not purpoſe to blame ye Popes perſons, nor diſpute againſt
their title of vniuerſall Biſhop, referring thoſe that would take
delight in ſuch diſputation to the Treatiſe of the Church, made
by the L. of Plesſis Mormay. But this is the pointe that I
proue, that ſéeing the Italians hold him for the vniuerſall Biſhop
of Chriſtendome, it muſt néedes follow by the nature of
contraries, that he can be no more particularly tied to Rome,
but that he is alſo as well Biſhop of France, of Germany, and
Spaine, who cannot be conuerſant and particularly reſident
in all theſe places at once. Therefore his Sea ought no more
to be at Rome, then in other places; but he ſhould wander ouer
all Chriſtendom, as did the Apoſtles, ſéeing that they hold that
S. Peter Apoſtle of the Iewes, came to Rome, being ſix hundreth
leagues diſtant and more, from the place from whence he
came. So that if the Pope be reſident any while in Italy, hée
ought to do the like alſo in other prouinces &amp; countries: otherwiſe
he ſhould depriue them of the right which vnto them apperteineth.
Wherefore they ſhould neuer abide that the Romanes
onely ſhould kéepe to themſelues the Biſhop common
to all: to preuent them, leaſt by that prerogatiue they ſhould
rule the world at their will, and diſpoſe and alter all things at
their pleaſure. This ſhall verie well ſhew, that whatſoeuer we
cōceiue and perſuade our ſelues of the ſubtilitie and pollicie that
is in vs, they ſhall ſtil for euer farre go beyond vs. Witnes the
compoſitions made betwéene King Henry the ſecond, &amp; thoſe
that inhabite but the néereſt borders of Italy, who retain ſome
ſparkes and beames of their ſubtilitie hidden in them. As the
Duke of Sauoy, to whome this King with the aſſiſtance of
thoſe, whom he déemed the beſt aduiſed and moſt ſage parſonages
of France, yéelded vp a great country which he and his anceſtours

had conquered with infinite charges, combats, &amp; victories.
And yet without any blow ſtroken by ye agréement of one
marriage all was rendered: &amp; all Lumbardie likewiſe by the
ſame pollicie. Muſt not then hereafter all Forthren peoples awake
themſelues out of their ſo fluggiſh dulneſſe, &amp; not ſuffer
themſelues to be ouercome with ye ſugered words of this natiō,
although they be enterlaced with ye ſwéetnes of religion, or profit
of the common weal? And aboue all things to take héed how
they deale with them in any caſe, for they will be ſure to haue
the ſureſt ende of the ſtaffe. But if euerie nation had practiſed
this in times paſt, and taken reſolution of that which concerneth
either their affaires of Eſtate, or of religion, neuer making
the Councell of Rome priuie thereunto: out of how great
miſeries, troubles, calamities, warres, quarrels, diuiſions, and
hatreds, ſhould Chriſtians haue ſaued &amp; deliuered themſelues?
But at the leaſt, we ſhalbe preſerued in time to come, by experience
of theſe oppreſſions that are paſt, which cannot chuſe
but be to our great good and profit.
         
         
            Cap. 40.
            
               That the Councell of Italy neuer made conſcience to cut
off the authoritie of the Pope, when they ſmelt that
there was any thing for them to be gained.
            
            WHen we come then to remember, how they make the
people belieue that the Church cannot ſtand without an
vniuerſall Biſhop: who without euer looking to that which
might follow thereupon, allowed verie well of all that: They
incontinent hauing this aduantage, made him proper to themſelues,
&amp; by ſuch deuiſe haue vſurped a domination ouer all the
world: &amp; prepared a way to fetch great ſummes of money out
of all parts of Chriſtendome, vnder the name and authoritie of
this their Biſhop. Whoſe authoritie notwithſtanding they neuer
make conſcience to abridge, when they ſmell any profit for
themſelues: how did they practiſe in the great Pardons which
were ſent abroad in the time of Charles the eight, and Lewes
the twelfth, by the which generall remiſſion of all ſinnes was

giuen, and Paradice opened to all thoſe, that would go in pilgrimage
to Rome: Wherein I ſay, that they did limit and reſtraine
the power of their Biſhop: for being vniuerſal, as they
maintain, ſo alſo is his power extended ouer all, and not reſtrained
or tied within Rome. Wherefore did they this then? but
for a fine deuiſe, to enrich their Citie, by the concourſe of diuers
ſtraunge peoples, who flocked thither from all partes of the
world, to go into Paradice, preferring by this meane, the inuentions
of men, before the commandements and decrées of
God, and the way that he ſheweth them to attaine to heauen.
This is an euident token, that this nation being moſt ſubtill,
meaſureth all things, as they ſée they may turne her to profite,
and augment her authoritie.
         
         
            Cap. 41.
            
               That other kingdomes may create and conſtitute Popes
within themſelues, becauſe the Italians refuſe their
Pope of Rome to be common to all.
            
            NOw if there had béen in other nations any craft or ſutiltie,
any thing néere like to that of Italy, after they had
perceiued how by this prerogatiue they were brought vnder
the iuriſdiction of the Italians, and dreyned of their money by
this country, if they had ſtraight pretended that the vniuerſall
Biſhop ought as well to viſit, and be reſident among other nations
and principall parts of Chriſtendome, as at Rome: and
in caſe the Italians wold not conſent, to haue told them plaine,
that euerie nation ſhould haue procéeded to the election of an
other, in euerie ſeuerall countrie: as the Frenchmen for their
part, who held that the Goſpell was firſt brought vnto them
by S. Dennis, and that therefore he is their Apoſtle, to conſtitute
the Sea of their Biſhop at the Temple of S. Dennis for
France: and for Spaine at S. Iames Church in Gallitia: ſo
in like manner for other nations. And in caſe hereupon, they
ſhould enter into choller and ſtorme at this, they might be anſwered,
that S. Panl did admoniſh the Corinthes to follow
him, euen as he imitated Chriſt. And in good faith, it is honour

inough for theſe Romiſh maiſters, in imitating them, to eſtabliſh
the like order &amp; gouernment, as they allow beſt of among
themſelues: for truth it is, that the true manner of honouring
and worſhipping of Saintes, conſiſteth in doing our vttermoſt
to imitate and follow their footeſteps. According to this, euen
as they wold neuer conſent to be depriued of their Pope, without
whom they cannot beare ſway in the world, and purloyne
money from other nations not ſo quick ſpirited as they: ſo in
like maner, if the French would looke well into their affaires,
it were neceſſarie for them alſo to make a Pope among themſelues,
to ſerue their own turne. And by the example of the Romanes,
they ſhould endeuour their vttermoſt, to raunge vnder
their iuriſdiction, not onely a whole kingdome, but alſo other
nations more Septentrionall, who are leſſe ingenious then
they, and principally this might be effected by the Prouenſals
or Gaſcons, being a people more meridionall then the other
Frenchmen. As for ye Engliſh, although by reaſon of the great
trafficke they haue into all partes by ſea, they are not a people
altogither ſo dull ſpirited and groſſe, yet they confeſſe, that the
French haue ſubtilly recouered that of them, by concluſions of
peace, which they by great victories had conquered from them
before. So that it is verie like by this meane, that if in imitating
the Italians, there were a Pope conſtituted but in France
onely, yet he ſhould haue vnder his iuriſdiction, England, Scotland,
Ireland, Norway, Friſeland, and all the Netherland.
By this ſhift, they might fetch in coyne from theſe parts, after
the example of the Romanes and the people of Italy, who haue
had a hand of ſuch people: whereas if the French had practiſed
ſuch conter-pollicies, whereas the Italians contemne
them at this day, as groſſe and barberous: they would haue
made as much of them, otherwiſe as a nation and people as
pollitike, craftie, and ſubtill as themſelues might bée. All which
is to ſhewe, how farre they excell vs in inuention and ſubtiltie
of ſpirit.
         
         
            
            Cap. 42.
            
               Arguments in defence of a Pope, if there were any in
France againſt him of Rome.
            
            BUt if any obiect, that the Italians would neuer endure
ye, for becauſe he were firſt in poſſeſſiō of one only Pope:
I agrée well to that, ſo they were the ſtronger: but when
we ſée that many of our Kings haue paſſed cleare through the
countrie of Italy, without any contradiction, and gone as farre
as Naples, and that thoſe that at any time went about to withſtand
them, were by and by ouerthrowne, wee muſt néedes
thinke, that it were great diſaduantage for them to deale that
way, but if on the other ſide, they would go to diſpute and combat
of wordes, to diſcide whether the ſucceſſion of S. Peter
and the lieftenancy of Chriſt be tyed to Rome, or no: we ſhall
néede but to ſende them to combat in this diſpute with the
Lutherians, who maintaine according to the ſaying of Virgil,
that the propertie and true deſcription of Rome is to containe
ſeuen mountaynes, thereby geuing vs to vnderſtand that it is
the Citye remarked in the Apocalips, to be the ſeate of Antichriſt:
Now in ye towne of Saint Dennis in France, there is no
ſuch matter, therefore ſuch qualitie cannot be attributed truely
to the Pope as the haue giuen him. But ſome may reply, ye the
people would neuer beléeue ſo much in any other Pope as in
him of Rome, to that I anſwere: that if they had made one
of as ſubtill a preiſt as him of Bellouet, if no man had gone
about to deſcrye his knauery (as ſome did) he might haue eaſily
preuailed for that poynt: for there was neuer any Pope of
Rome, who for his owne perſons ſake, nor for his miracles,
that euer was ſo followed with ſo great troupes, as was he of
whome I now ſpeake. But if they went about to terrifie the
French Pope, by excommunications and interdictions, ſo that
he would but practize ye like againſt theirs of Rome; it is moſt
certayne, that whoſoeuer would but looke on the one and the
other, ſhould ſée the Italians farre more black in the face and
more melancholike, and the French farre more cherefull and

Iocande then they. Sée her then in mine aduiſe are medy which
being put in practiſe of vs as it ought, will ruinate the Domination
of the Italians and the counſellof Rome, in the perſonnes
of there Popes, which likewiſe would quit cut of the
way whereby the tranſport all our ſiluer from vs, As for thoſe
who would not nor could not away with the Pope, ſhall by
that meanes kéepe themſelues exemted from there Domination,
without paying them any mony at all, no more then ye proteſtantes
doe, which will haue nothing at all to doe with them.
And here I will aduertiſe the Readers of a fine deuiſe to feare
the Romans, and to make there Popes tryple crowne ſhake
on his head, if they had but the newes carried them, how that
the moſt Reuerend Cardinall of Vendome were elected
Pope in France: it would make them all quake for feare, and
put them in worſer caſe then if an Army of miniſters ſhould
goe thether to ſet vpon them: But if any Frenchman ſhould,
to make them more certayne of it, tell them againe that hée
were wonderoſly affectionate to the maſſe and to the ancient
ceremonies, they would thinke him more aſſe and ſot then ſottiſe
it ſelfe, becauſe that is no part of the greife that tormenteth
them, but the name of their Pope onely. And if the Spanyard
likewiſe would but follow this example, the lead of Rome
that the haue ſold for a dearer price then the fineſt golde in the
world, which men come to ſéeke ſo curiouſly out of all partes,
ſhonld tarie with them at Rome, to help them to make there
gutters of there houſes, ceſtrenes to hold there water, or Carracters
to print what they pleaſe withall.
         
         
            Cap. 43.
            
               How the Roman Eccleſiaſtick knaweth the people of his
owne countrye, and teacheth thoſe of other nations to
doe the like to their countrymen.
            
            BUt becauſe the Italians is ſo ſubtill and wary, that hee
will ſlip none occation, but he will take it faſt by the haire
aſſone as it is preſent, and will neuer let go his hold til he haue
made thereof all the commodityes that it may yéeld: ſée he deleth

hardly with his owne countrymen to there great hinderance
and loſſe. Now they detayne a good peece of their gayne from
them, who making vp part of tbe body of the commonwealth,
hold there aſſemblies a parte, and neuertheleſſe the themſelues
are preſent at the aſſembles of others, who moreouer can of
themſelues publiſh and by there owne reaſons confirme that
which they will haue eſtabliſhed and ſet downe▪ no man ſo hardye
as to open his mouth to ſpeake to the contrarye, which is
the eaſieſt meane to obtayne any thing whatſoeuer a man
would haue in this world. For look into the Soueraigne courts
and other Iuriſdictions, where in there are many learned and
eloquent Lawyers, although they bee ſuſpected to pleade the
weaker cauſes: yet ſo it is, that if they haue this aduantage
to propounde onely that which concerneth the iudgment of the
cauſe, being no aduerſe partie or aduocate that dare ſpeak any
thing to the contrarie: they wilbe ſure to diſcourſe and pleade
in ſuch ſorte and with ſuch dexteritye, that the Iudge and the
Aſſiſtances ſhalbe ſo rauiſhed &amp; caryed way by there reaſons
that they ſhall obtayne victorie of the cauſe, were it neuer ſo
vniuſt. Now the Roman Eccleſiaſticke hauing won this aduantage
to himſelfe to the great preiudice of the Nobilytie and
the Commons, and hauing beſide giuen light and inſtrution to
thoſe of other Countyes to doe the like, haue robbed all other
Eſtates of there goods and dignityes; tryumphing and ſwimming
in riches themſelues vp to the chin: caring not a ſtraw
to goe againſt there profeſſion which ſhould bee by contempt
of the world to afpire to heauen. For proofe hereof, there was a
preſident who was verie curious to count al the reuenue of the
Kingdome of France, and hauing made his computation, he
found that the ſome did amounte to twelue thouſand Millyons
and that the Eccleſiaſticks, who are not the hundreth parte
of the people carried away ſeuen parts hereof: Whereas in
the old teſtament they had but a tenth: neuer ſpeaking of any
oblations that the haue at Baptiſmes, churchings, confeſſions,
and the great ranſomes that thy extort after the death of
the deceaſed huſbandes of poore widowes, orphans and pupilles,
vnder the coullour and pretenſe of their long prayers: all
which ought in déede to be employed to the inſtrution of children

and the marriage of poore parentles maydens: beſides in
all the Churches of Cittyes, a man of any honour cannot ſcape
there nets, but he muſt leaue behinde him ſome halfe Teſton,
a matter of two groates if he will not be in diſfauour of theſe
Eccleſiaſtickes. Touching any charges, watchings and trauels
that they ſhould be at, to teach, reprehend and comfort the
people as S. Paule requireth, theſe great pillers of the Church,
the Cardinals, Biſhops, and Abbots, they draw back and will
not come neare them, and yet it neuer ingendereth any remorſeof
conſcience, to take fiftie thouſand crownes of yearely
reuenue, referring the exerciſe of their charges to their courts,
who after their example diſcharge themſelues by their Vicars,
and their Vicars, they hang all vpon the begging Fryers, ſo
that the Nobillitie and the people be well ſerued betwéene
them all by this ſhift, which ſheweth verie well that they can
deuiſe ſhifts &amp; meanes now for their commoditie in this world.
         
         
            Cap. 35.
            
               Verie fit meanes to hinder the Eccleſiaſtick for medling
with that which concerneth the Magiſtrates.
            
            TOuching the Magiſtrates to whom they are bound to
giue all honour, and yéeld them all ſubiection, they robbe
them in part of their Iuriſdictiō exempe themſelues from their
power, and taking themſelues the prerogatiue of honour, that
they owe vnto them. And further, that which is to bee noted
more ſtrange, in ſtéede of ſupporting the poore Prieſtes who
haue all the heauie burthen of their charges vpon there backs,
they ſtill ouer loade them with ſo many ſeruiſes, and cut them
out ſo great quantitie of matter to ſing, that thoſe of Cities,
in leſſe thē ten or twelue yeares become ſo hoarſe, that they are
not able to ſerue any longer, but muſt be caſt off to goe ſéeke
where they can, by reaſon wherof, ſeing them at ſome ſollemne
feaſt, ſurcharged with ſuch quantitie of ſeruices, whereas they
ſing on their part: for my part I bewayle their miſerable condition,
eſtéeming it worſe, then that of poore flaues and captiues
in the Romane Gally, and cannot chuſe but argue thoſe

of great inhumanity, who haue ouercharged them with ſo heauie
burthens: not only againſt all good reaſon, but alſo againſt
the ordinance of the ſonne of God, and the briefe forme of praier
that he hath taught vs: but alſo againſt all humane order,
obſerued in tendering of petitions vnto Kinges of the earth,
which are abridged with as fewe and ſhort wordes as may bée
poſſible. Sée wherefore it were moſt neceſſarie to ſtop ye courſe
of ſuch Italian influences, not to ſuffer our ſelues to be handled
at their deuotion, and not to depend any longer of them, as
heretofore we haue done: but to finde out the remedies hereof,
it is not an eaſie matter amongſt the Northren people, becauſe
that ſuch drugs do not grow amongſt them, no more then do
the Palme-trées and their Dates. But euen as one countrie
bringeth foorth oftentimes poyſon, and the preſeruatiue far the
ſame, euen ſo, he that would preſerue himſelfe from their domination
and draught of mony, that they vſe to draine out of
other prouinces, ſhall borrow a good péece of wiſedome, found
out at a time of great néede by the common people of Rome,
to reſtraine the courſe of the domination of their Senatours,
who had them before at aduantage, to villanize, abaſe, and reduce
them into bondage and ſlauerie, at their pleaſure. The
common people perceiuing that they had their counſell apart,
where they might take ſecret deliberation, to increaſe their
authoritie, and to pull downe &amp; gnaw the people, which ſhould
be hard things for them to remedie, becauſe the Senat did conſiſt
of verie learned men, great Orators, and full of maieſtie,
aduiſed themſelues to create Tribunes for their owne defenſe:
which ſhould oppoſe themſelues to the ordinances of the Senate,
in caſe they did any thing diminiſh their libertie, &amp; ſhould
kéepe the Senators ſhort, that they ſhould not tirannize ouer
them, nor draw their ſubſtance from them, as before time was
their common practiſe. By this meane the people was no more
expoſted in pray to the Senate, but maintained ſtill themſelues
in their owne liberties: for euen as the bodie of man is verie
well at eaſe, when none of the Elementall qualities doth ſuffer
it ſelfe to be ouercome with the contrarie: ſo that commonwealth
euermore flouriſheth, when none of her partes do ſuffer
it ſelfe to be in ſubiection to the other.
         
         
            
            Cap. 45.
            
               That it is verie requiſite that the Magiſtrate ſhould ſet
his hand to the reformation of Churches, becauſe that
will neuer be done by meanes of any Paſtors.
            
            ACcording to this, there is no more effectuall remedie to
preuent the Eccleſiaſticke, leaſt he gnaw the reſt of the
people: then to chuſe out in euerie towne ſome learned and vertuous
man, which is not of the ſame qualitie, not too much addicted
to ceremonies and ſuperſtitions, who muſt haue an eye
to their counſels, conſtitutions, and preachings, and who muſt
alſo diſcouer their end: to the end they may ſée whether they go
about any thing to the preiudiſe of the Nobles, of the Magiſtrates,
or of the people: and if they do, to withſtand them therin,
hauing power and authoritie to aſſemble the people, to aduertiſe
them by ſpéeches and Orations in their Temples, how
that they go about to deceiue them. If in the time of Conſtantine
the Great, ſuch Protectors had béen choſen, they would
neuer haue permitted the Eccleſiaſticks vnder ſhadow of Purgatorie
and praiers for the dead, to haue depriued the lawfull
heires of ſo many Counties, Lordſhips, Barronies, Féefarms,
and other landes, whereof they haue robbed and ſpoiled them,
nor that the goods of Hoſpitals giuen to the poore, ſhould be eaten
and ſwallowed downe by them: for although that they
would not contradict ſuch doctrine, yet perceiuing that vnder
the colour thereof, they pretended to make trafficke and ſale of
the kingdome of heauen, and to ſell for faire readie mony, life
euerlaſting: they would haue gainſaid them, and reproued ſuch
théeues, who vnder a falſe apparance of bringing men to heuē,
pretended to picke their purſes, &amp; to make them looſe that which
they had on earth: they wold haue taken order at the leaſt, that
the poore ſhould not die for hunger, languiſhing and crying, ſéeing
the Priors of Hoſpitals to deuour their good, ſinging and
making merry. Sée then this is a good remedie whereby wée
might kéep faſting the Italian and the Eccleſiaſtick, and make
them content themſelues with their owne, and to kéepe within

their owne limits. For to hope that euer they will reforme
themſelues, they neuer did it yet, nor neuer will. For if you
looke ſince the death of Iouſa to Ieſus Chriſt, betwéene which
there is more then a thouſand yéeres, you ſhall finde that the
Eccleſiaſticks neuer ceaſed to corrupt the true ſeruice of God.
By reaſon whereof, he gaue them ouer into the hands of their
enemies. And how to reſtabliſh them, he raiſed vp Iudges and
Magiſtrates: how alſo after they had Kings, he inſpired many
to reforme and reduce his true ſeruice, hauing béen abaſtardized
by the Miniſters and ordinarie Prieſts of his Church. And
why, I pray you, were Prophets ſent? But to accuſe and conuict
the ordinarie Paſtors of their impietie, rebellion, and diſloyaltie.
After the maner of which Prophets, S. Iohn Baptiſt
termeth them a generation of vipers: and Ieſus Chriſt calleth
them, théeues and robbers. And S. Paul in his time, cried
out againſt their abuſes. And in the time of Conſtantine, they
had diuided Chriſtendom into more then twentie ſeuerall ſects,
all which this holy parſonage cut off in his time, reducing
them all to one vniforme confeſſion at the Nicene Councell.
By whoſe example, Kings and Magiſtrates ought to ſet to
their handes: and out of the miſerable diſſipation wherein we
liue, to reſtabliſh one true way for the ſeruice of God, as Moſes
did command them: to wit, that they ſhould meditate in
his law day &amp; night, to kéepe it themſelues, and to cauſe others
to obſerue it alſo. And not to expect till the Paſtors reforme it:
whereof a great number ſéeke but to enrich themſelues, and
to ſway ouer others.
         
         
            Cap. 46.
            
               That it is verie needfull to withſtand the enterpriſes of
Churchmen, be they Prieſts or Miniſters, and to chuſe
protectors for the conſeruation of the people.
            
            ANd to take away the doubt that ſome may propoſe, to
wit, if ſuch Tribunes are neceſſarie among thoſe who
haue caſt off the Popes yoke and haue Miniſters. It is certain,
that the reaſon is all one: for to be perſuaded, that they are

of better borne, and of more gentle nature then the ſacrificing
prieſts, iſſued out of the race of Abraham, there is none apparance.
But to go no further then to the Apoſtles themſelues,
if we looke but to the marke that they leuelled at before the Aſcenſion
of Ieſus Chriſt, and before he had ſent downe his holie
ſpirit vpon them, we ſhall ſée that they were enflamed with an
ardent deſire to be promoted, to rule &amp; beare ſway. So that, if
once they be tollerated to ſet downe articles &amp; conſtitutions in
the Chnrch, euery one thinking himſelfe wiſeſt of all, and farre
to go beyond his predeceſſours, will endeuour to inuent and
bring in ſome new article, ſo that they will procéed ſo farre at
the laſt, that the Church ſhall finde it ſelfe repleniſhed with humane
traditions againe, in ſtéed of the Romiſh Eccleſiaſticall
conſtitutions before aboliſhed. And ſo it ſhall fall out as a thing
moſt naturall and common to all Paſtors, that they will cauſe
their owne inuentions to be obſerued more ſtrictly, then the
commandements of God, and the preceptes of his moſt ſacred
wore, as well by depriuing their ſhéepe of the Lords Supper at
their pleaſure, as alſo by their publike exclamations in their
Sermons. So that alſo the violence that ſome vſe in ſéeking
out curiouſlie, thoſe which had tranſgreſſed ſome articles of
their diſcipline, hath made men and women by thouſandes to
reuolt from their Churches: and moſt true it is, that he which
too curiouſly ſéeketh out the doings of other, often forgetteth to
examine his owne, which is quite contrarie to S. Paules inſtruction,
who treating of the Lords Supper, commaundeth
Euerie one to trie himſelfe. Whereupon the leagued Cautons
of Swiſſerland, one of the beſt peoples in the world, haue
abridged their Miniſters of this power, which they of France
labour to eſtabliſh amongſt them euerie where. But if there
were Protectors of the Magiſtrates, Nobles &amp; Commoners,
might not they verie well ſtop the courſe and progreſſe of theſe
matters? teaching them this leſſon, that ſéeing they attribute
to themſelues none other qualitie or condition, but to be the ſeruants
of the liuing God, that there is nothing more repugnant
to their profeſſion, then to preſume to make lawes in ye church,
which is the kingdom of God. And that there was neuer anie
ſeruant to King nor Prince, that durſt attempt to vſurpe anie

ſuch prerogatiue, how well ſoeuer he was fauoured of ye king.
And who was euer ſo ſawcie a ſeruant, that being left to ſerue
and wait vpon the ſpouſe of his Lord, forgat himſelfe ſo much,
that he would rule ouer her by his own lawes and ordinances?
And what greater blindnes can there be, then to thinke to light
by our counſels the fountaine of all light and wiſedome, which
is eternally reſident in God? Who if he would be aſſiſted with
any other counſellers in the gouernment of his Church: hath
he not Angels and Archangels by legions? Hath he not Noe
that great Heralt of iuſtice, Abraham the father of the faithfull,
Moſes, Enoch, and Helias, the Prophets and Martyrs,
and more then fiue hundreth of the faithfull beſide, which roſe
from the dead after the death of Ieſus Chriſt, as witneſſeth S.
Paul. All which in knowledge, holines, and experience, go a
great way beyond the beſt and greateſt ſpirits that may créepe
on the face of the earth, in the priſon of their bodies. And by ſuch
and ſuch like reaſon, to kéepe them within the boundes of their
vocation, which is, that in ſhewing themſelues faithfull Embaſſadours
and meſſengers of God, they may in nothing goe
beyond the commiſſion that they haue in charge.
         
         
            Cap. 32.
            
               That it is the dutie of Paſtours to plant the Faith, and to
roote out vice and ſinne, and not to make lawes.
            
            FOr confirmation hereof, and to proue that there is more
doctrine and inſtruction in one onely Epiſtle of S. Peter
and S. Paul, nay to ſpeake of leſſe, in one onely Chapter,
the fift to the Galathians, then the moſt perfect and holieſt
men in the world could euer accompliſh or fulfill. And to the
end that the Paſtors ſhould endeuour themſelues to roote out
the fruits of the fleſh, and to plant thoſe of the ſpirit, they are at
large ſet downe. Firſt to wit, for the fruits of ye fleſh theſe: Adultery,
fornication, filthines, diſſolution, idolatrie, empoiſonings,
enmities, ſtrifes, enuies, anger, quarrelling, ſeditions,
ſects, murthers, gluttony, drunkennes, &amp; ſuch like. Secondly,
for the fruits of ye ſpirit, theſe: Charitie, Ioy, Peace, Patience,

Clemencie, Bountie, Faith, Mercy, and Temperancie.
Sée then here is more worke cut out in this one Chapter,
then they and their diſciples will euer be able to do, and in doing
this, they ſhall but do their dutie: beſide conſider all the inſtruction
of the whole Bible, and you ſhall ſée a bottomles ſea
of doctrine, wiſedome, and good leſſons to teach vs to liue well,
ſéeing that this onely Chapter doth teach vs more then any
man in the world hath béen able to performe and follow truly.
But he that would in good earneſt come to the reformation of
the life of men, here is the ſoueraine meane, to pull vp by the
rootes out of their hearts, all incredulitie, the mother of all vices,
to plant therein faith, the ſpring of all vertues, as the Lord
Du Pleſsis Mornay, hath verie well aduiſed in his booke, Of
the veritie of Chriſtian Religion: wherein he hath wrote a
moſt diuine péece of worke. For who is he that regarding the
ſhortnes and vncertainty of this life, who firmly beléeuing that
there is an euerlaſting ioy and felicitie, into the which, all the
faithfull and vertuous enter: and that there are likewiſe eternall
paines prouided for the vniuſt, and vicious, who wold venter
to wallow in all vice, to be depriued of ſo great a benefite.
This is the marke at the which all paſtors ought to le
                  ••…
               ll: and
not to make traditions and lawes, ſéeing there are ſo many in
holie ſcripture, that in examining our life by the perfection of
them, we are cléerly conuicted and attainted of our owne imbecilitie
and inſufficiencie to fulfill them. For my part, when I ſée
an aſſembly of paſtors congregated to make lawes, to bring
and conduct men more eaſily to life euerlaſting, then the Prophets
and ſonne of God, and his Apoſtles did (although they
are taken for Angels in reſpect of the reſt of the people) méethinkes
I ſée as an abſurd a thing as if the fiftéene ſcore blinde
folkes of Paris ſhould take vppon them to goe mend all the ill
highwaies of Chriſtendome, to make them fairer and ſtraighter
then they are: as cunninger and more ſkilfull to do it, then
thoſe that haue béen emploied about it heretofore. But if you
will obiect, that Miniſters haue made good lawes by their diſcipline,
againſt danſing, maſking, and dicing. I yéeld, that at the
firſt fight, it hath a faire ſhew and apparance, but examining it
néerer, you ſhall finde that they take away therein, the authoritie

of the Magiſtrate, and vſurpe that which appertaineth
properly to the Kings and Princes of the earth: to whom only
it belongeth, to make inholitions vpon ſuch things, to cauſe
them to be obſerued by penalties and by priuation of the Lords
Supper, for that is exprefly prohibited by Gods word, and ſo
by conſequent out of their commiſſion. Moreouer, the Eccleſtaſtickes
haue euer had this deuice, ſubtilly to intrude themſelues
to the making of lawes, &amp; to haue matters of ſmall importance,
ſtill referred to them, thereby to haue a gap to matters
of greater conſequence, as the Tribunes may make ample
relation hereof, and proue it by many ſundry examples.
         
         
            Cap. 48.
            
               That the controuerſies about the Lords Supper, by which
the Paſtors trouble the whole world, are eaſily to bee
accorded and quieted, if the Magiſtrate would but go
about it in good earneſt.
            
            WHerefore if we do not take ſome order for the peace and
tranquilitie of Chriſtendome, by ſome ſuch meane as I
haue ſet downe, in vaine otherwiſe ſhall we looke for any firme
and aſſured concord. For thoſe who aboue all other, ought to
ſéeke for reconciliation betwéene God and man, &amp; afterwards,
betwéen themſelues, are nothing els but the verie inſtruments
of trouble &amp; ſedition, kindling the fires of diſcord euery where,
to ſet all in flame and concluſion. For to ſtay till of their owne
motions there fall out ſome accord betwéene the Councell of
Rome and the Lutherians, and betwéene them againe and the
Caluiniſts, touching our Lords Supper, that will neuer be no
more then betwéen Caiphas and the Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſt,
wherefore if there be none other to ſtep in amongſt them, moued
thereunto by pittying the ruine of other Eſtates, which I
haue named, who muſt craue aide of the greateſt Kings and
Chriſtian Magiſtrates, to make them hold their tongues, they
will trouble heauen &amp; earth about this diſputation of the Supper
(a matter neuertheles verie eaſie to be accorded betwéene
them.) For we all agrée to this, that the faithfull taking the

bread &amp; the wine from ye hand of their Paſtors, receiue by this
meane the verie bodie and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, to be vnited
with him, and made fleſh of his fleſh, &amp; bone of his bone. What
is it that is yet in controuerſie, but onely the maner and forme
how that commeth to paſſe? Now the Capernaits, deſiring to
comprehend the maner of this eating, Ieſus anſwereth them,
that, The words that I ſpeake vnto you are ſpirit and life.
As if he ſhould ſay vnto them: there is none but thoſe who vnderſtand
the operation of the diuine ſpirit, and how he giueth
life vnto all creatures, who can comprehend how that is done.
But our ſoule which is detained priſoner in this bodie, ſhe cannot
ſo much as conceiue how the ſpirite of God being infinite
and incomprehenſible, hath it operation in all yt is in the world:
nay, that which is farre leſſe, we cannot imagine how the Angels
of heauen, and the ſpirituall Damons, employ their Forces
to execute the iudgements of God, nor the temptations of
the wicked ſpirit againſt vs: nor how a legion of diuels may
be in one onely man, nor after what maner they lodge in him.
And yet thinges farre leſſe then all theſe, cannot we comprehend,
as the eſſence of our ſoule: and whether it be within vs
or about vs. For how it can ſo quickly ſtirre and remoue all
the members of the bodie: nor alſo by what force the Adamant
which is in the rocks of ye North, can draw vnto it yron, being
in a ſhip more then ten or twentie leagues of. And whereas he
calleth his words Life: it is to giue vs to vnderſtand, that as
our humane vnderſtanding cannot conceiue, how God inſpireth
life to all creatures, and giueth it to ſome liuing creatures
in the belly of their dammes, giueth it to an infinit number of
litle Animals, Locuſts, and little Flies, and no man can comprehend
the forme and maner how he doth it, nor ſo mnch as
this, how many liuing creatures being pend in and depriued of
all externall light, for all that ſée moſt cléerely: ſo likewiſe muſt
we conclude, that God worketh in this Sacrament by a diuine
operation, and altogither incomprehenſible, which man
cannot comprehend, nor ſhall not comprehend whileſt he is reſident
in this Elementall and corruptible bodie. It ſhould ſuffice
vs to know what S. Paul teacheth vs: that, there is in vs
an interior and an exterior man. So that in this Sacrament,

euen as the exterior, receiueth the ſignes of bread and wine, ſo
the interior receiueth the bodie and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, for
the nouriſhment of euerlaſting life, without making any déeper
ſearch of the maner how it is done. This point ſo concluded
vpon, it ſhalbe méete for the peace and tranquilitie of Chriſtendome,
that the Tribunes ſhould humbly entreat Chriſtian
Kings and Potentates to imploy the power and authoritie
that God hath beſtowed vpon them, to bury in perpetuall obliuion,
all theſe meanes deuiſed by the Eccleſiaſtickes, be it of
Tranſubſtantiation, Conſubſtantiation, Infinitie of Chriſtes
bodie, and many other quiddities, the fountain of troubles
and diuiſions in Chriſtendome, by this meane to preuent the
Italians, leaſt for things wherin they haue none intereſt, they
ruine alſo other Eſtates of this Continent. And if any debate
ſhould fall out betwéene the Tribunes and the Eccleſiaſtickes,
and that they could not agrée, that the King ſhould aſſemble a
good number of men of profound knowledge and great experience,
and eſpecially thoſe that are beſt affectionate to the benefit
and quiet of their countrie, and without any intereſt in this
controuerſie. The which ſhould not be moued by the outragious
cries, and violent paſſions of mutinous and ſeditious preachers.
And to ſéeke out ſuch fellowes as Meſsieurs Budee, de
l'Hoſpital, de Pibrac, and Monſieur Groulard, who is at
this preſent firſt Preſident of Normandy. And looke what the
King ſhall reſolue by the counſell of theſe learned men▪ to cauſe
thorowly to be obſerued. And to go about theſe matters ſo ſecretly,
that the Italians heare no inkling thereof, leaſt they by
their craftie conueiances, hinder not the happie ſucceſſe of this
buſines. To foreſée this well, it ſhall néede but to make the
world belieue, that theſe aſſemblies were made for ſome other
purpoſe, and that ſome new occurrence had fallen out, and giuen
occaſion to treat of religion, all vnder one.
         
         
            
            Cap. 49.
            
               That in vaine we looke for deliuerance out of the miſeries
of France by any Aſſemblies of Paſtors.
            
            IF we doe not vſe theſe or the like remedies, our hope ſhalbee
in vayne to expect for any goodly effect of Synodes or Aſſembles
of the Eccleſiaſtickes, becauſe there ſhalbe alwayes but
one or two of the moſt learnedſt and eloquenteſt: albeit the be
all of one nation, who ſhall diſpoſe and carrie away all things
at there luſt, all the reſt ſeruing but to ſay Amen, and to ſubſcribe
to there aduiſe. For when any one amongſt them hath
got aname to be profoūdly learnd &amp; to bemore ſubtil indiſputing
then others, no man dare gayne ſay him, ye tremble al vnder his
authoritie: &amp; if he beſome what ſtyrring &amp; ambitious, &amp; deſirous
to beare ſway: he wil make thē receaue what Articles &amp; lawes
he liſt, for yt hauing ſtudied matter ynough to defend himſelfe wt
Arguments to reach vnto his purpoſe, yt others ſhal litile think
of, and perfaming his matters with a litle apparant benefit
for them, they will let him carry them away ſo, and ſubſcribe
to whatſoeuer hee would haue them. For that among them
there are few or none, who are accauſtomed at ſuch an inſtant
readylie to contradict and reſiſt. But it goeth not ſo with Maieſtrates
the greateſt number whereof being brought vp and
exercized to plead in contradictorie iudgement, will not ſuffer
themſelues ſo eaſily to be caried away, but can tell how to
withſtand one another, what ſtudie ſoeuer any partye hath
employed and come neuer ſo well prouided. Wherefore it is a
dangerous caſe to repoſe any confidence in the deciſions of Eccleſiaſticall
Aſſemblies, which in the olde Teſtament, neuer
wrought anie other effect but kindled the fire of perſecutions,
firſt againſt the Prophets and afterwards againſt Chriſt himſelfe,
his Apoſtles and infinite others of his martirs: and ſo
conclude, ſuch Aſſemblies haue neuer bine but a plancke for the
Italians to paſſe to eſtabliſh all there new Conſtitutions ſuch
as are not yet altogether receaued in all parts of Chriſtendome
thereby to ſway ouer, and gnaw to the bone all Chriſten people

it followeth then hereby, that to take away the occaſion of
this abuſe, we muſt haue recourſe to Soueraigne Princes
and to there Maieſtrates, when it comes to the queſtion of
eſtabliſhment of the Chriſtian Church, for ſo God did himſelfe
as we finde in the olde Teſtament, and not to rune to Paſtors
who being once out of the true way, will alwayes goe
worſe and worſe and euer come into it againe.
         
         
            Cap. 50.
            
               That all Chriſtians are agreed of the place of ioye and
happines whether they muſt goe, but diſagree concerning
the wayes that muſt leade them thither.
            
            BVt becauſe the Italian is ſo quick and pliable, that there
is no good order ſo well eſtabliſhed, but hee can alter and
bring to confuſion, either by ſéede of diuiſions or by corrupting
perſons by flattery, giftes and remuneratorie promiſes as
well Mageſtrates as other protectors of the people, employing
their vnto ſome Eccleſiaſtickes or others, we muſt néedes
ſéeke out and vſe ſome ſurer and perpetuall Remedy againſt
them, And becauſe as I haue proued that there Domination
and great ſomes of mony they dreine out of other countries
hath no foundation but the bare cloke of Religion, by reaſon
wherof to preuent leſt they ſurpriſe vs, we muſt be very carefull
and diligent to chooſe out the truth, for that the derill tranſformeth
himſelfe into an Angell of light, and is an Ape to the
workes of God, to rob and deceaue vs. But not to bee deceaued,
we muſt at the firſt conſider and examine curiouſly al that
is proffered and preſented to vs for the way of ſaluation, of
what ſide ſoeuer it bee, to chooſe the beſt, otherwiſe our choiſe
ſhall alwayes be doubtfull, hauing no knowledge of neither of
the wayes which we might take. For in matter of Relligion
all haue one deſire and ſhoot at one and the ſame marke, which
is to come the ioyes of heauen and in this they all agrée, but
they diſagrée of the waies and the forme of ſeruices that they
ought to follow. And becauſe they Counſell of Rome, teacheth
one kinde of waie and maketh manie take that roowte

with a goodly forwardnes, that they ſet them in thitherward,
and an externall forme of ſeruice, which with great delight, féedeth
humane ſences very much, practizing all kind of murthers
and cruelties, on thoſe that ſéeke to climbe to heauen any other
waies: There is alſo an other ſort of men, who by liuely reaſons
and great perſuaſions, go about to fetch backe from them
as many as they can, to lead them thither by other paths: but
the Romanes, to preuaile in this matter, ſay, that yt way whih
they teach, is the broad and wide way, wherein the Fathers
haue paſſed, the which is alſo more common to a great number
of people. The others they ſay, that this great way whereof
they eſtéeme ſo much, is that which leadeth to perdition, and
many there be that enter in. And that the way of ſaluation is
verie narrow and ſtraight, and few there be that go that way.
And if that they which follow the great and large way, finde it
to be the better, they will not hinder them for going that way:
but yet requiſite at their handes, that they will ſuffer them
peaceably to go by their ſtraight and narrow way, which they
take to be the ſurer paſſage.
         
         
            Cap. 51.
            
               That men being contrary in opinions, cōcerning the way
of their ſaluation, they muſt receiue inſtruction of the
Eccleſiaſticall bodies.
            
            NOw in this conflict, if we looke onely but vnto men, and to
that which is on earth, we ſhall find our ſelues much troubled,
and thinking to chuſe the beſt way, we ſhall take ye worſt,
and neuer reach thither whither we minde to go. And if in this
iudgement we depend vpon Eccleſiaſtical Paſtors, one ſhal allow
one way, &amp; others ſhal teach another, grounding thēſelues
diuerſly on places of the ſcriptures, and the Doctours of the
Church. In ſuch diuerſitie, what ſhould it then be néedful to do?
we muſt lift vp our eies, cogitations &amp; thoughts vpon on high,
to other Maiſters &amp; Preachers, who teach vs not by the eares
as mortall men do: but by the eyes of a viſible, certaine &amp; immutable
language: and aſke neither gold nor ſiluer, nor domination
ouer vs for their paines: but fréely offer vs their inſtruction,

with great bountifulnes and bleſſings towards vs, if we
take it thankfully, and we neuer néede to make any long and
tedious pilgrimages to finde them out. But it ſufficeth to but
go forth of our habytacles, builded by the workemanſhip of
men, to enter into the great Pallace and Temple of the liuing
God, made with his owne hand, in the midſt whereof, he hath
placed vs: to know and admire the wonderfull excellencie of
his workes, and to yéeld him the glorie and honour that he deſerueth.
In doing this, to make our ſelues worthie beholders
of the ſame, when we ſhall comprehend with all admiration
the omnipotencie, wiſedome and bountie of their framer, who
ſhineth in the ſame moſt gloriouſly: and although that vppon
the earth and in the waters of the ſea, his ſageſſe, vertue, power
and bountie, is moſt amply proued vnto vs: yet would hée
giue vs more ample teſtimonies in the concauitie and extendue
of the heauens, to draw vs néerer vnto him, hauing ſet there
two great lightes, the one lower, the other higher, to the ende
that by them as by the Ladder of Iacob, we ſhould go to finde
him out in his heauenly Tabernacle, to do him homage, and to
yéeld him all the loyaltie, wherein we are bound vnto him, as
holding our life &amp; al our goods beſides of him, putting our ſelues
ſtill vnder his protection. And therefore to carry all reuerence
and due obedience towardes his lawes and commandements,
hauing our recourſe vnto him when we are oppreſſed, or that
we fall into any neceſſitie or ſicknes, giuing him thankes ſo oft
as euer he beſtoweth any benefits vpon vs, in celebrating the
praiſes that the greatnes of his workes deſerue. By the conſideration
whereof, we ſhall perceiue our owne infirmitie, to
learne thereby to humble our ſelues before his diuine Maieſtie,
and ſtill to haue in admiration the ſuperexcellencie and depth of
his wonderous workes.
         
         
            
            Cap. 52.
            
               That the lights of heauen do draw vs to ſeeke God in
heauen, and do witneſſe, that their Creator is infinite
and incomprehenſible.
            
            ALthough that the lightnings, thunders, cloudes, raine,
ſnow and haile, which are engendred in the middle region
of the aire, yéeld ſuch ample teſtimonies of the power, bountie,
and prouidence of God: yet mounting a litle higher, to the
torches of heauen, whereof the néereſt vnto vs is the Moone,
kéeping continually the courſe that God hath aſſigned her, to
giue light in the night, and to moyſten all bodies: and from her
let vs mount higher by degrée and degrée, to euerie Planet, till
we come to Saturne, eleuated higheſt of all, and from him to
the ſtarry firmament, and we ſhall ſée a number of thoſe that
are farre bigger: for we cannot contemplate the firmament
with his blazing torches, infinite almoſt in number, may wée
cannot behold at one time the one halfe, but we ſhall be rauiſhed
to admire the force and greatnes of the maker, who hath
framed a péece of worke ſo excellent, aboue al other wondrous
things? Now we haue béen ledde ſo high with our bodely eyes
which can go no higher, we muſt haue recourſe to the eyes of
our vnderſtanding, the which being lightned and conducted by
the brightnes and light of Gods word, ſhal make vs mount yet
higher into two other heauens, to come where S. Paul by a
traunce and rauiſhment of the diuine ſpirit, ſaw Ieſus Chriſt
the ſonne of Iuſtice, and many other vnſpeakable things in the
glorie of God, hauing full confidence and beliefe, that in his eſſence
being diuine, infinite, omnipotent, glorious, &amp; quickning
all things, according as Dauid witneſſeth: comprehendeth in
him all things, without being comprehended of any, and that
in his perfect light and glorie, all Angels and bleſſed ſpirits are
lightned and liue. But becauſe that his infinitie, maieſtie, glorie,
and brighnes, cannot be beholded of vs, for that it would rauiſh
all our ſences, and our ſight is not able to endure ſo pure
and bright a light: whereof Eliſeus &amp; Iſaias being great Prophets,

hauing beheld but one onely beame, haue béen throwne
downe to the ground, and not able to ſtand to behold it any longer.
But I muſt returne from this bottomleſſe ſea of glorious
brightnes, and come againe to the torches of heauen, which hée
hath ſet in his great Pallaice, wherein he hath placed vs créeping
vpon the earth, to receiue inſtruction at their handes: and
for breuities ſake, I will go no further then the cleare and pure
Sunne, as the moſt perfect &amp; accompliſhed image of his Creator
and maker, which repreſenteth beſt vnto men, the wonderfull
profoundnes of his great vertues.
         
         
            Cap. 53.
            
               Of the Sunne, the very portraiture of his Creator, &amp; what
are his workes and operations.
            
            ANd firſt I ſay, that euen as men cannot comprehend the
quanty of his eſſence, being a thouſand times greater then
it appeareth to our eyes, as by demonſtrations all Aſtronomers
proue, nor likewiſe the qualitie thereof, nor the manner
how it caſteth his heat and light ouer the whole world. So alſo
can we conceiue neither by our vnderſtanding nor exteriour
ſecnes, the greatnes or qualitie of the diuine eſſence; nor how it
hath produced it operations in the creation of the world, in the
conſeruation of the ſame, nor the manner how it worketh to
create in the faithfull the new man, which fighteth againſt the
fleſh. Likewiſe as this great celeſtiall light is in perpetuall
operation and mouing, to runne his great race about the
whole world, alwaies doing good, and bringing infinit commodities
to other creatures: ſo God is alwaies watching and in
action for the benefit and preſeruation of his creatures. Moreouer,
as when a thicke cloude hath depriued our ſight of his
beames for a moneth togither or more, and that this let being
taken from vs, we begin to ſée his beames againe, which bring
a certaine ioy or gladneſſe vnto vs, and driue the cold far from
vs: ſo the faithfull neuer ſéeke to behold God in his works
and vertues, but that they receiue great pleaſure and delectation.
And beſides, as when this diuine image retireth back from

vs into Capricorne, the Caldes comming from the Northparts,
and from the frozen ſea comming to afflict all liuing creatures,
ſpoyling our mother the earth of all her trimme and good
ornaments, and making her naked and vgly to behold: ſo when
God angry at our ſinnes, taketh his holie ſpirit from vs, the
prince of this world, of the aire, the God of this age, the ruler
of darkenes, which is, the diuel commeth to aſſaile, and enuiron
vs, to tempt vs and bid vs battell, and to annoy vs many other
waies. But as this great celeſtiall light goeth not from vs to
forſake vs: but to diſtribute his light to the people which liue
vnder the North Pole, and that by his long abſence, wée know
better the benefites that wée receiue by his preſence: ſo God
ſometime holdeth his face from vs, to the end that deſiring him
we ſhould ſéeke for him, &amp; ſhewing vs his countenance againe,
we ſhould taſte better what a benefit it is to enioy alwaies his
preſence. For as this blazing torch comming towardes, being
leaped backward to approach vnto Cancer, beginneth to renue
the face of the earth, and to beautifie her with gréenneſſe,
and with an infinit number of hearbes and floures of diuers colours,
giuing life to many hundreth thouſand millions of little
Annimals, to ſerue for foode to birdes and fiſhes, to féede their
young withall, who by an harmonious melodie, full of all ioy
and gladnes, celebrate the bountie of their ſoueraigne the Sun,
which they receiue by ſuch inſtrumēts as it pleaſeth him to vſe
to heate againe that part of ye earth, from whence he had abſented
himſelfe ſo farre, wherein he magnifieth the omnipotencie,
bountie and wiſedome of his maker, which hath attributed to
him ſo many vertues, to the end that we ſhould wonder at him
in his ſo beautifull and perfect workemanſhip: ſo alſo he pulleth
downe our preſumption, for that we cannot ſhew any ſuch like
péeces of workemāſhip, nay, we cannot ſo much as conceiue by
our vnderſtāding, how he giueth life to ſo many liuing things,
and how one onely floure is cloathed with ſuch diuerſitie of colours.
If it be ſo, then the greateſt and quickeſt vnderſtandings
are ſurmounted by the operations of one of the creatures of the
Almightie: how ſhall wée comprehend thoſe of the diuinitie,
whereas it worketh in vs of it ſelfe, as in Baptiſme, the water
of regeneration, or in the Lordes Supper, in the eating of the

bodie of Ieſus Chriſt, or in the vnitie of the thrée perſons in
one onely diuine eſſence? Wherby appeareth that this celeſtiall
bodie is to vs of it ſelfe a moſt excellent Preacher, to make
vs leaue of the vaine diſputes of the maner hwo God worketh
in ye ſacraments, to content our ſelus ſimply with the ordinance
that he hath giuen vs in inſtituting them, and neuer to go further
for the matter.
         
         
            Cap. 54.
            
               That this light reproueth thoſe who detaine men in worſhipping
images, and the workes of their owne handes,
to ſeeke God by them.
            
            THis ſame Preacher alſo reproueth the ſpirit of me, of a
moſt brutiſh errour, when men being drawne by him to
the knowledge of the moſt high God, by an eleuation of their
ſpirits towards the higheſt heauens, they turne their backe to
him, ſéeking him here in earth, in buildings made by the handy
worke of men, forgetting the leſſon of S. Steuen, the firſt Martyr,
which was: that God did not inhabite in Temples made
with the handes of men. Which the Sunne can likewiſe proue
vnto vs by an argument á Minore ad Maius. Thus, if it be ſo
that all the forces of men are not able to build an houſe big inough
to encloſe and containe me: how is it then that they are
ſo fooliſh and preſumptuous to thinke to lodge him that is infinite,
and hath his dwelling in the inacceſſible light, of the which
I am but a ſparke? how dare they thinke that he may be contained
nor compriſed in houſes made by men, and that the temples
built by them, and that their tapers and candles are more
agréeable to him then we his great lightes, who without waxing
old or conſuming, do diſtribute continually to the world, ſo
great and admirable a light? For as for their temples they are
but earth: and grant that they be vawted with ſtone, couered
with bricke, leade, or ſtate, yea were it with gold and ſiluer; all
that is taken out of the bowels of the earth. So that all your
buildings ſtand you in no more ſtéed then earthes and holes do
to the Foxes, that is to preſerue you from the iniuries of the

vehement heate, raine and cold: but you are not in any wiſe by
their meanes the néerer to God, nay rather when you are in
his temple of the world, they let you, that you cannot behold his
wondrous workes, putting as it were a barre betwéene heauen
and you. And as for the images that ye place within them
in contempt of vs, by your moſt deteſtable ingratitude, ſéeing
that God doth preſerue you by me and the reſt of the celeſtiall
lightes, and doth beſtow on you all kinde of bleſſings, is it not
then a great ouerſight in you, that in forſaking vs who are the
workemanſhip of the Creator, ye will preferre before vs images
made by the deuiſe of men, albeit they approach in nothing,
neither in matter, greatnes, qualitie nor effects, to thoſe that
are the handie worke of God. For firſt they are made of an
earthly and dead ſubſtance, which commeth nothing néere our
greatnes: without any mouing or operation: and without
the heate and light which we haue. Moreouer, they are but lying
Doctors, as Ieremy the Prophet ſaith: For they haue no
power, life, wiſedome, light, nor bountie, neither can they ſée
any thing: is it not then falſly done to go about to repreſent by
them Almightie, who is the welſpring of life &amp; light: and him,
who is all goodnes it ſelfe, &amp; afterward to tranſlate vnto them
the honour that appertaineth vnto him? Further, one is pictured
that he is thruſt into the ſide, and blood iſſuing out, which
was neuer ſo: another ſheweth a laughing countenance, and
neuer laugheth. Other are pictured with eyes, and they ſée not,
ſome with eares and they heare not, and others with a mouth
and yet they ſpeake not at all. Whereby appeareth, that there
is no veritie in their witneſſe, and that all that they can do, is
but to tranſport the mony aut of our purſes into the Italians
handes, or to ſome other of their ſuppoſes emploied in their ſeruices
onely. Nor we for our parts, being the true celeſtiall images,
do not repreſent any lye to your eyes, and the teſtimonie
that we yéeld to the Almightie is moſt true: wée haue not required
any oblations of your gold or ſiluer, nor any other ſeruice
or adoration, as the Italians haue done by their dead images:
and nothing els do we requeſt at your hands, but that you
will yéeld to the Almightie▪ the glorie and honour of all things
as apperteineth to him, not giuing away any part thereof, to

any creature that euer was, or is at this preſent vnder the firmament.
Sée here briefly, what is the inſtruction and leſſon of
him who marcheth as King among other Plannets.
         
         
            Cap. 55.
            
               How that Italians are prooued to haue abuſed the world,
in making men go to Ieruſalem, by the forme of the firmament.
            
            COme we now to this great, gilden, and azured Heauen,
whoſe ſpéech is all one as before, publiſhing from one Pole
to the other, and ouer all the world, that what account ſoeuer
men make of their earthly Temples, they come nothing néere
it in beautie, greatnes, long continuance and luſt. For the greateſt
tempell that euer was built, was but of halfe aleague
in lenght, and the Aſtronomers afferme that their is fiftie nine
Millions of leagues from the earth vnto they ſtarry Heauen,
and from they other ſide as much wherby it ſhould follow that
my roundnes ſhould containe verie néere thrée hundred fiftie
and fowre Millions of leagues, and yet for all that cannot containe
the infinite eſſence of God, How then doe men ſuffer
themſelues to bee abuſed worſe then brute beaſts by the Romans
and their Italian Councell, who make them beléeue
that they can ſhut him into there pipes in their Temples, to
behold him therein, and to carrie him vnder their Canapes to
thende to rob you by this meane of your mony, and altogether
to begiule you. They ſame heauen being round and equally
diſtant in all partes from they earth: doth manifeſt vnto
men that their is no one place more nere to him or his heauenly
glorie, then another. In this he conuinceth of a ſhamefaſtlie
and falſehod the Roman Counſell, and thoſe that mainetaine
it, who to approch to God, cauſed in times paſte great
toupes of men to trot ſo farre as Ieruſalem and Rome, to goe
the ſoner into God almighties Paradice, although indéede this
was but a maſke and ſhift found out and practiſed by the Italians
to aduance and increaſe their Domination, and ſo to fiſh
mony out of Iudea Syria: notwithſtanding by this conſinage

they haue cauſed to periſh in theſe voyages, that they made
them to vndertake both Chriſtian Kings and Princes, and
more then two millions of men, ſpeaking not of their great
trauels, perils, maladies, and other ſorrowes: beſides that they
haue made them endure, whoſe chaunce it was to returne from
ſo long a vyage. Theſe are then they goodly and they Celeſtiall
leſſons which are giuen vs from aboue, as moſt excellent
preſeruatiues againſt the craft and cautelous dealing of the Italians,
by the which if we be not al together out of our wites,
we ſhalbe by them ſet at all libertie and winde our neckes out
of their Domination, and by they ſame meanes will kéepe our
mony in our purſes, to helpe vs at our néede, and alſo to doe
our freinds good, and theſe that we ſhall ſée ſtand in any great
neceſſitie.
         
         
            Cap. 56.
            
               The harmonie of they holy Scriptures of the Bible and
of the heauenly creatures to humble man to geue glorie
onely to God, and to ſeeke him aboue in heauen.
            
            BVt to the one that we may be armed on euery ſide, God
hath not onely prouided for vs theſe heauenly inſtruction:
but alſo to inſtruct vs more familiarly, hee hath left vs his Apoſtles
and Prophets to teach vs all after one manner, and by
the ſame leſſons, of they number of which if we will take the
moſt heauenly, to wit, King Dauid in his Canticles, I ſaie
they Prophet, S. Luke and S. Iohn in their Goſpels, S. Paul
to the Romans and to they Galathians, and S. Peter in his
firſt Epiſtle; we ſhall finde they ſweteſt harmony and goodlyeſt
Concordance that may be deuiſed to be found amongſt all
the Preachers of his worde that are in the world. And ſée this
is the true touch ſtone, wherby we muſt examine all they writings
and doctrines of men: that is to wit: whether they agrée
with they teſtimonies that God giueth of himſelfe by his
creatures: which as they publiſh that all things are procéeded
from a ſupreme and former cauſe that doth maintaine and preſerue
them: ſo alſo muſt hee giue him the hommage of all his

benefits, and to haue recourſe to him as to a bottomeles fountaine,
to lade out of him all bleſſings, as well ſpirituall as temperall,
confeſſing his greatnes, bountie, and excellencie, in reſpect
of his great and admirable workes, to humble vs, and to
tame this pride growing in vs by nature, in exalting him as the
giuer of all that which wee haue, to depend wholy on his good
pleaſure, and moſt holy will: And to make proofe of this great
concordance: the royal Prophet Dauid ſpeaketh vnto the eternall
to this effect: Call vpon me when thou art in trouble and
I will helpe thee, and thou ſhalt worſhip me. Wherein we ſee
a ſtrict commaundement to call vpon God, and to gine him
thankes, as an act properly due to the diuinitie and incommunicable
to all the reſt of his creatures: as hee ſpeaketh in another
place, To thee O God, who art aboue in the heauens, we
lift our eies.
            For to ſhew vs the forme of calling vpon him, which is not
to haue our ſpirites fixed heere in earth in the workes of mens
hands: but to eleuate them towardes the heauens, as Chriſt
himſelfe vſed ſaying: Our Father which art in heauen,
and ſo foorth: And as for faith, that it onelye ought to looke
vp to God: this Prophet verie well prooueth. In God is my
ſoule well pleaſed, he onely is my ſafegard, and the rocke of my
defence, he is my ſauing health, and my ſtrong fortreſſe, ſo that
I ſhall not fall, for hee holdeth me vp. And if we regard well, a
great part of the Pſalmes, and amongeſt the reſt, the 104. and
118 to what do they tend but to magnifie the excellence, beuty,
and greatnes of the workes of God? And ſurely, there is no
thing ſo excellent for man to practiſe, as to exerciſe himſelfe in
the contemplation of them, to giue the praiſe and honour therof
vnto his Creatour. And all the reſt of the Pſalmes tend but
to extoll the admirable vertues of the liuing God, as his bountie,
power, mercie, iuſtice, liberalitie and clemencie. Moreouer,
there are certaine principall verſes amongſt the reſt, which by
the riches of an immitable eloquence, do praiſe, ſet forth, and aboue
all things aduance his holy and diuine lawe: ſhewing that
the ſoueraigne felicitie of man conſiſteth in the mediation therof
day and night: forcing himſelfe with all his heart, thorowly
to obſerue the ſame. But after that hee hath thus ſpoken of

God, of his workes, and of his law: what ſaith hee, I pray you
concerning men, and of his owne perſon? when he ſaith. What
is man? hée is a thing of naught, and all that he worſhippeth is
but vanitie: &amp; in another place, the ſame kingly Prophet ſaith:
All are gone out of the way: they are all corrupt, there is none
that doth good, no not one. And ſpeaking of his owne perſon,
although hee were the moſt holy king that euer raigned ouer
Gods people, he ſaith: Be mercifull to me O God a pore ſinner,
&amp;c. and that his mother hath conceiued him in ſinne, praying
God to waſh him, and to purge him from all his iniquities,
as him onely that could doe it.
            Now hauing thus much ſpoken of man and of his doings, to
abate and pul down his pride and preſumption, and not to leaue
him there, but to prepare him to ſéeke all that which he wanteth
in the perſon of his redéemer: imbracing him by a true and
liuelie faith, as being him that to ſatiſfie the diuine iuſtice, ſhuld
carrie all our tranſgreſſions and ſinnes vpon his owne backe,
as Dauid deſcribeth in the 22. Pſalme, and the Prophet Eſay
in the 53. Chapter of his prophecie, which they did ſet downe
before the comming of Chriſt, and after his death his Apoſtles,
wel I haue prooued by a moſt admirable conſent and vnity. He
that wil then no more ſubmit himſelfe vnder the Italian yoke,
to be raunged vnder their Domination: let him read quicklie
the aforeſaid bookes, and conſider and ponder them well in his
mind, weighing diligently euerie word, and euerie ſentence one
after another: and conferring aduiſedly the beginning with
the middle, and the end. Let him examine this doctrine with other
inſtructions that God doth giue vs particularlie both in
heauen and in earth: not to approoue and make them ſerue to
our fantaſies and opinions, but laying all them wholie aſide, to
take their inſtructions, and ſimplie to follow their leſſens. In
this doing, he ſhall learne that we are all Burgeſſes and felow-Citizens
of the great Temple and ſumptuous pallace of our
God, and that by the conſideration of our vicious and poore nature,
he ſhall be taught to mount aboue the heauens, to inuocate
vpon God, and to obtaine by this meane, all things wherof
he ſhall ſtand in need. And from thence, comming vnto his
moſt holy and ſacred word, magnifiyng it as the onely inſtrument

of our ſaluation, and a perfect declaration of the counſell
and will of God towards men: and hauing the knowledge of
theſe thinges, no man ſhall be able to withdrawe vs from this
way of warſhipping GOD on high, to ſéeke him in Temples,
buildings, and other places of this earth, but if we goe to thoſe
places that ſhall be onely to make profeſſion of our faith, to bée
aſſiſtant at publicke praiers, to heare the word of God, to examine
whether the Doctrine that is taught vs be conformable
to theſe Doctors, of whome I haue now ſpoken: which when
we ſhall finde, we ſhall imbrace as diuine and of God, and putting
vs againe in mynd, and confirming thoſe things which the
preached, we ſhall receiue it as moſt heauenly doctrine: but if
it tend to exalt men and their works only to pleaſe them withall,
we ſhall receiue it as procéeding from the preſumption and
ouer-ſight of men, who take themſelues to be wiſer then God,
and for ſuch ſtuffe as may entangle the people in the nets of ſeruilitie,
and fill onely the purſes of worldlie Paſtors: wherefore,
without any regard from whence it procéedeth, whether from
Coucels or Synods, or frō any other ſort of Ecclefiaſticall perſons
whatſoener, wee will reiect it, thinke our ſelues no more
hounden vnto the obſeruation thereof, then to the dreames and
tales of olde women. On the other ſide knowing that life euerlaſting
is giuen vs by the grace of God in our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, and is offered gratis to all men: what ginnes ſoeuer the
Italians and ſuch like can lay to drawe our money finely from
vs, we ſhall goe by them well enough, making as though wée
ſawe them not, and as though wee neuer heard talke of them,
Theſe are then the moſt ſure &amp; certaine remedies, by the which
all true Chriſtians may eaſilie winde themſelues out from the
Italian Domination, and make a prouiſo, that their money be
no more tranſported to Rome, but tary at home iu their owne
purſes.

               The eoncluſion of this preſent diſcourſe.
            
            VVHerhfore thou Spaniard, hauing they place of the
Head, which workeſt all that thou canſt to reduce

vnder thy Domination other nations which ſhould be the eye
of Chriſtendome, thou oughteſt to haue as much wit as any
other people, It is not then agreat blindnes for thée to behold
thy ſelfe in ſuch ſlauerie to the Roman Counſell, that thou
art no more then the executour and drudge of their wills, and
that they make the tributarie to them in huge &amp; infinit ſumes
of mony, wheras thou diddeſt neuer get one penny from them.
And thou French man which art the hart of Chriſtendome
from whom ſhould flow all motions of vertues to encourage
the other partes, thou haſt almoſt ſuffered thy ſelfe to bee ouercome
vnder the ſpirituall Domination of this nation, by their
flatteries and cautelous ſhifts, ſuffering them to put a knife into
thine owne handes to deſtroye thy ſelfe, to ſet all in combuſtion
and ruine, to thend that they may fiſh in thine ouerthrow
and deſtruction? As for Germany, the ſeat and reſidence of the
Empire, to the which the Apoſtles and the firſt Byſhops of
Rome yeelded all obedience and ſubiection, what greater cowardlines,
ſhame and diſhonor can there bee on her ſyde, then
that in degenerating from their ancient Ceſars, and other Roman
Emperours, vnder the which all the world did tremble:
they are at this preſent becom the ſlaues and vaſſals of Rome,
and brought ſo low as to be glad to hold the Styrrop of ſome
filthy Monke, who hath been choſen Pope. And if heretofore
you haue had the eies of your wit and vnderſtanding ſo much
dimmed by the darknes of the time, ſuffering your ſelues to be
made ſo very fooles, that they might vſe you at their pleaſure,
now in this great light which ſhineth at this preſent, and is
not yet gone from you, amend your former faultes to recouer
your honor, and ſeeke to rule and ſway ouer them another
while in your turne, and to get from them againe vnder ſome
colour whatſoeuer all the money they haue in their fingers of
yours and your people paying them now at the laſt home according
to their deſeruings and curſed intentions: and that according
to good rule that they haue a long time kept in Chriſtendome,
they may haue their due deſart at the laſt paid them
to the vttermoſt.
