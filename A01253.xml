            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

                  IMperiale and Spinola Noblemen of Genua having bin ancient enemies, and lately reconciled by the mediation of Iuſtiniano, a friend to both; Spinola endeavoured to marry his Sonne Franciſco to Angelica daughter of Imperiale; but finding his Sonne rejected, and Doria entertained, by that conceived affront, accompanied with other jealouſies, ſuſpects the old enmitie not fully eradicated from the breſt of Imperiale, and moved with indignation, hireth a Brave to kill him in a crowd at a Feſtivall: this being accidentally diſcovered by Sango the ſlave of Spinola, he reveales it to Moloſſo the ſlave of Imperiale, as acceptable newes to him, who had waited an opportunity to be revenged on his Patron for ſevere and unuſuall puniſhmēt, inflicted upon him. Moloſſo to ingratiate himſelfe with his Lord, thereby to worke a greater miſchief, not only reveales the plot to him, but diverts the ſame upon Spinola's owne Son, at which unexpected encounter Spinola through rage fall's into a ſtrange kinde of Phrenſy, but at length being an ey-witnes of the miſerie which through the cruelty of the ſlaves befell Imperiale, his wife Honoria, Angelica, and Doria, he recovers his ſences and turnes his fury into compaſsion.

            Tragedy ſlouriſhed and was in high eſte eme, the hearing and ſight whereof did wonderfully delight the men of thoſe times.
            For if the accounts be made of the charge the Athenians were at in adorning their dramatick Poems, it will appeare that the Bacchae, Phaeniſſae, Oedipi, Antigona, the cruelties of Medaea and Electra, conſumed more treaſure, than their wars undertaken againſt Barbarians for liberty and Empire.

                     Truely to love my friend, yet hate no man,
                     And ſince mine own experience finds how well
                     Thou do'ſt the one, I would perſwade the other;
                     Nor would I now convert thee to a Stoicke,
                     To make thee thinke there are no injuries,

                     Theſe, I confeſſe, are not compatible
                     With thy condition; on th'other ſide,

                     To take a ſcandall, when there is none given,
                     To call that injury, which is in truth
                     A liberty that every man may challenge;
                     Or if Imperial ought t' have wav'd the ſame,
                     
                        
Yet ſince the will is free, thou could'ſt expect

                     Hath rais'd thoſe ſtormy clouds? can bright Aurora
                     
                     Riſe cheerfully from ſhrivel'd Tythons bed?
                     And thou ſo diſcontentedly from mine?
                     But I'le not doubt the cauſe to ſpring from me,
                     Rather from feare of yong Prince Doria's ſafety,
                     Whoſe great affaires perhaps have made him ſtretch
                     His promiſe to the utmoſt, not to breake it,
                     Though he could not prevent our expectation,
                     He'l not deceive't, but like th'approaching Sunne,
                     Will ſoone expell theſe miſts, and cheere our hearts.
                  
                  
                     Hon.
                     I am ſolicitous, I muſt confeſſe
                     Of his returne, whom we have long expected,
                     To whom we have deſign'd our onely daughter,
                     And with her both our fortunes and our loves:
                     But the true cauſe of all theſe perturbations
                     Which you diſcover in my countenance,
                     Is a ſtrange dreame (heaven make it but a dreame)
                     And I perhaps ſhould but have thought it ſo,
                     Had not my daughter, ev'n this very night,
                     And the ſame houre, as neere as we can gueſſe,
                     With the like viſion been diſquieted:
                     Me thought we harbour'd in our houſe a Wolfe,
                     Bred up ſo tame, that all did handle him,
                     
                        
Which like a dogge would fawne on them that beat him,
                     Til on a time, accompanied with another
                     Of his owne race, he ruſh't into the chamber
                     Where I together with my Daughter ſate,
                     There they reſum'd their native crueltie:
                     The one aſſaulted her, the other me,
                     And tearing firſt our Iewells from our necks,
                     They made us both at length their farall prey:
                  
                  
                     Ang.
                     Oh, how the terrour of that dreadfull viſion
                     Affrights my Soule! I tremble when I thinke on'c?
                     Me thought the heartſtrings of Prince Doria crack'r
                     At the direnewes, it prov'd the overthrowe
                     Of our whole Family: we differ but in this,
                     The Savadge executioners to me
                     Seem'd to be Beares, creatures as bloody as wolves.

                     It is no wonder that your dreames concurr'd,
                     Since there is that relation in your blood:
                     I muſt beleeve, you had the day before
                     Communicated ſome ſad thoughts together,
                     Which in the night your wakefull fantaſies
                     From a like temperature of braine reduc't
                     Into like formes, ſuggeſting that for truth
                     Which is at beſt but fond imagination;
                     What can be vainer then a womans dreame?
                     T'is leſſe to be regarded then her teares,
                     Which are prepar'd to flow at her command.

                        Caſſandra's true predictions were diſpis'd.

                     By flights of birds, ſuch witchcrafts now are ſeas'd,
                     And we from thoſe darke errours are releas'd:
                     To talke of viſions is an indiſcretion,
                     Practis'd by Children, and diſtemperd perſons:
                     Go then; prepare your ſelves for ſolid joyes,
                     On this day the Republick yearly paies
                     
                        
A retribution to our Familie,
                     And as I heare (the time being Carnivall)
                     Some mirth ſhall ſeaſon our ſolemnitie;
                     If Doria come to day, as we expect,
                     To morow nothing ſhall be heard of us
                     But ſongs of Hymen and Thalaſſius.

                     Never could any wretches be more glad
                     To be deceiv'd.

                     O Wretched ſtate of man, to whom the time:
                     By nature made for eaſe, is found unquiet;
                     Sleepe, properly cald reſt, who can expreſſe
                     How reſtles it becomes through various dreames?
                     Which are ſo ſtrongly formed by the fancy
                     That though they be moſt falſe, and when we wake
                     Should wholly vaniſh, yet even then they leave
                     A deepe Impreſſion in the troubled mind;
                     Nor doth this onely happen to weake women,
                     But unto men of ſpeciall eminence,
                     Working vpon their hopes aſwell as feares,
                     Who many times to their confuſion
                     Have by ſuch drowſie errors bin ſeduc'd;
                     Hence did Amilcar venture to aſſault

                     To venture life or fortune in purſuit
                     Of ſuch a vanitie, yet in all things
                     Abundant warines can never hurt:

                     Corruption of her confidents and ſervants:

                     It will be wiſdom to decline th'alliance
                     Of him thy Father counts his enemy:
                     It would be wretchedneſſe to make thy love
                     Depend upon th'affections of another:
                     He never lov'd that can for any cauſe
                     Suſpend his love: ſet then before thine eyes
                     Valiant Achilles, who acquir'd more honor
                     By conſtancie, even to his enemies Daughter,

Redeeme the time Franciſco, though't be ſhort,

                     I was compell'd to do't.

Hath the dull ayre of Europe chil'd thy bloud?
                     For thy ſole cauſe I hardly could containe
                     My preſent joy in the diſcovery,
                     Though death ſtood gaping for me while I heard it,

                     My obligation to my ſtarres and thee,
                     Their Mercury, can never be expreſt;
                     Which I have husbanded to my advantage.
                     It is the ground from whence I'le take my riſe,
                     To leap, and fall like dreadfull thunder on him;
                     It is not vengeance, but ſoft pietie
                     To wiſh a foes death, when hee's fit to dye,
                     To let him live, and feele himſelfe ſo wretched,
                     That he ſhall ſeeke and ſue for abſent death,
                     Is a revenge becomes me, and I'le have it;
                     Thou know'ſt my Patrons former truſt was chang'd
                     Into a ſudden jealouſie, which ſprang
                     From conſciouſneſſe of his baſe injuries;
                     This hath remov'd that doubt, and ſet me right
                     In his loſt good opinion, which I meane
                     Still to confirme by my ſtrict diligence,
                     Till time and opportunity ſhall ſhew

                     Now are thy thoughts full plum'd, it pleaſes me
                     To ſee thee mount, not flag in thy revenge:
                     I muſt confeſſe, I love a preſent miſchiefe,
                     But, if it may conduce to thy brave ends,
                     To make a feyn'd retrait, and then returne
                     With greater violence; I muſt conſent,
                     And when th'art ready for thy great aſſault,
                     But, this, and I ſhall joyne; in the meane time
                     Let nothing be diſcover'd to my Patron;
                     If that be, death's the beſt I can expect.
                  
                  
                     Mol.
                     Reſt thou ſecure, and to expreſſe my thanks,
                     It ſhall not be the leaſt part of my plot,
                     To give thee meanes to gaine the full fruition
                     Of her that Genua ſo admires and ſtrives for.
                  
                  
                     San.
                     Can there be hope of ſuch a happineſſe?

                     I ſhall embrac't with all the circumſtance
                     Of danger, that bold treaſon undergoes,
                     Or what accompanies forbidden love
                     In the moſt jealous climes: I ſhould deſire
                     In the fruition of ſuch bliſſe t'expire.

                     Verdugo.
                     VNder a homely habit many times,
                     Vertue lyes hid; this ruſticke weed conceales
                     An Engine that can fruſtrate providence:
                     When I attempt the death of any man,
                     No towne of Garriſon, not his owne houſe,
                     Nor any place of ſanctuary can ſave him:
                     Nor doth my praiſe conſiſt in this alone,
                     That I command the life of whom I liſt;
                     A deſperate wretch may claime that priviledge:
                     He that is weary of his owne, may be
                     Lord of anothers life; but ſuch attempts
                     Hatch't onely by a phrenſie, ſeldome proſper:
                     My actions are the fruits of a bold ſpirit,
                     Temper'd with judgement, done with ſecrecy:
                     Hence is our brave profeſſion found to be
                     Of ſpeciall uſe to awe the inſolent,
                     And ſecure thoſe that ſeeke to live in peace.
                     What ſatisfaction is it to a man
                     That receives wrong, to call his enemy forth,
                     And then expoſe himſelfe to equall hazard?
                     Or in ſtrict Common-wealths t'appeale to law,
                     As if a feyn'd ſubmiſſion in ſet words
                     Could cure the piercing ſting of injury;
                     No, 'tis aſſurance of a cloſe revenge
                     That plants civility, deters and keeps men
                     
                        
From giving, and from ſuffering affronts;
                     This benefit we bring to every man,
                     Yes, and the publicke States of Italy,
                     
                     How ere they cenſure our particular actions,
                     Receive no ſmall ſecurity from us;
                     Treaſon would hardly finde juſt puniſhment
                     Within their narrow territories, if we
                     Should not, like eager hounds, purſue the traytors,
                     And make them know, that in another Country
                     The juſtice of their owne can overtake them;
                     Let then the ſloathfull taxe us, that our ends
                     Are not the publicke good, but private gaine,
                     Which we preferre above mankinde; this is
                     But what's objected to the ſouldier; he
                     Will fight againſt his brother for reward,
                     Men ought to follow their vocation;
                     The fountaine of our livelyhood is profit,
                     Without which, honour challenging the skill
                     To nouriſh arts, cannot provide us clothes,
                     Nor vertue, noys'd to be the greateſt good,
                     Procure us bread. Nor yet is our profeſſion
                     More cruell then the graveſt; I have heard
                     Of Lawyers, that are priviledg'd to cut
                     Their clyents throats, with a perplext Indenture,
                     A parchment Saw. The learn'd Phyſitian
                     Following the long and beneficiall way
                     Of reverend Galen, by degrees will purge
                     The humours of his Patient, till he leaves
                     Nothing but bo
                           •…
                        es for death, and hungry wormes
                     To gnaw upon; as for his pliant skinne,
                     That, while he lives, by pieces is pul'd off,
                     Till he be wholly flea'd: the Vſurer,
                     I'ſt not his uſe to binde men firſt in bonds,
                     And bring 'um then to execution,
                     Extending both their bodies and their lands
                     Vpon a racke; we are more pitifull,
                     And by an unexpected way diſpatch
                     Quicker then lightning, or a cunning headſ-man,
                     
                        
For all the ill of death is apprehenſion;
                     How's Imperiale wrong'd? if when he hath
                     But newly ſaid his prayers, I releaſe him
                     From the enſuing miſeries of age;
                     And when that work's perform'd, my charity
                     May doe as much for Spinola himſelfe,
                     Provided I be offer'd like conditions:
                     My hand of juſtice is not partiall.
                     But ſoft, this pleaſing contemplation
                     May make m' omit the time of action,
                     Which now drawes neere; my plot is ſo contriv'd,
                     That being purſu'd with reſolution,
                     It cannot want ſucceſſe; our beſt deſignes
                     Are often croſt, when through a fond remorſe
                     We change our counſels: few have learn'd the skill
                     To be or wholly good, or wholly ill.

                     Aboute ſom three howres ſince
                     Being in the Domo, I eſpi'd this man
                     At his firſt entrance, and although I never
                     To my remembrance ſaw his face before,
                     Yet inſtantly I found a ſtrange miſlike
                     Of his aſpect, which did increaſe the more,
                     Becauſe I ſaw him often fix his eyes
                     On him he ſlew, whom I conceiv'd to be
                     Signior Imperiale, I reveal'd my thoughts
                     To this yong man who then ſtood next me, who
                     Concurring with me, did reſolve as I
                     To watch him narrowly; we both agreed
                     
                        
To keepe on either ſide of him, at length
                     In midſt of all the crowd, raiſing his arme
                     To fetch his blow, he hit me with his elbow,
                     At which I ſuddenly laid hold on him,
                     Suppoſing he had ſnatcht at ſome mans purſe,
                     But then I ſaw drop from his hand the ſheath
                     Of that dire weapon, he had newly buried
                     In the warme bowels of that Gentleman.

                     That I perceiv'd the motion of his arme,
                     And looking down, ſpi'd bloud upon his hand.

                        The ſong ended, Hymen and his Feſcennine youths appeare clad in antique formes, dancing a wanton dance, at the end of which, Prince Doria repreſenting Thalaſſius, enters with other young gentlemen his friends, attired like Romans, with their ſwords drawne: at ſight whereof Hymen and his company runne away confuſedly: then they put up their ſwords, and dance a warlike dance, at the end whereof Doria ſuddenly embraceth Angelica, the Maſquers all crying out

                     That voyce was frequent at a publick rape,

                     Not, as the Romans when they had betraid
                     The Sabine Virgins, do my glad friends make

                     See how Prince Doria hath ſurpriz'd us all,
                     Transform'd into a nuptiall Deitie.

                     My doubt is in the better ſenſe reſolv'd:
                     You may perceive y'are welcome by the joy
                     Expreſt both by my daughter, and my wife,
                     In no dry complement, but in a moiſt
                     And ſilent Oratory.

                     Which works more
                     On my affections, then a golden tongue;
                     But tell me my divine Angelica,
                     
                     How could'ſt thou at the tidings of my death,
                     Put on a valiant incredulity?
                     And when thou find'ſt me ſafe burſt out in teares.

                     To lend beliefe to any ill report
                     Of a known friend, although aver'd with boldnes,
                     In common friendſhip were unpardonable,
                     Much more in ſuch a love as mine, which finding
                     In a mayne part a manifeſt untruth
                     Was for your honour bound to ſlight the reſt:
                     And though there be a contrarietie
                     In the true cauſes of our joy and griefe,
                     Yet both are often times expreſt with teares,

But trueſt love delights to pleaſe it ſelfe
                     With ſuch diſguiſes, and to finde by trials
                     Our owne aſſurance many wayes confirm'd:
                     Nor had I ventur'd to diſturb thy thoughts,
                     Which thy diſcerning judgement did prevent,
                     But that I had a preſent remedy.

                     I might have ſafely taſted what the Mede,

                     So long as there was ſuch an antidote.

                        Pandora on whom each Deity beſtow'd
                     A ſeverall gift, was not endow'd like thee.

                     Why ſhould proud greatneſſe undervalue us,
                     And our condition? ſince all men are ſlaves;

                     What art their Courtiers elſe? with all the ſuits
                     They either beg or weare? the rich Banquier
                     Enthrals his debtor, and his money him:
                     This Captaine is a captive to that wench;
                     This Magiſtrate to bribes; that Lord to pride,
                     This Stateſman to ambition; all to feare:
                     From whence we only that have nought to looſe,
                     Are free, and that ſhall inſtantly appeare;
                     I'le ſend the ſervants forth, that Sango and I
                     May act our part with more ſecurity.
                     See how the fates themſelves have help'd to bring
                     The Beaſt into my toile, and made both him
                     And his whole houſe the ſubject of my vengeance,
                     My joy is ſuch, I cannot temper it:
                     As when the bloud-hound in a leaſh being led,
                     Noſeth the ground, and while the prey's far off,
                     Spares both his mouth and feet, but drawing neer,
                     Will open wide, and drag away his leader,
                     So are my thoughts tranſported, I'le away,
                     My fury cals for bloud, and I obey.

                     While rage diſtracts them; he's no ſooner laid
                     To reſt upon his couch, but up he ſtarts.
                  
                  
                     Eva.
                     The wiſe Iuſtinian meanes this night to bring
                     Some curious muſicke, that may rocke his ſenſes
                     Into a ſlumber by ſweet harmony,
                     Working on his affections, we are all
                     Eternally oblig'd to that good man;
                     Who though he be with hearty ſorrow mov'd
                     To ſee his friend in ſuch neceſſity,
                     Ev'n of his helpe, yet is reſolv'd t' employ
                     His conſtant care, nor will he ever thinke
                     His debt of friendſhip paid by my labour.
                  
                  
                     Fid.
                     What will become of us if he miſcarry?
                     We are his kinſmen, and have no ſubſiſtence
                     But by his onely bounty; I receiv'd
                     A deadly wound in the deplored death
                     Of his deare ſon, who oft was pleas'd to bid me
                     Throw all my care on him, and now I finde
                     My hopefull venture ſunke in that brave ſhip.
                  
                  
                     Eva.
                     To loſe out friends and fortunes I confeſſe,
                     Is that which needs muſt ſhake the firmeſt mindes,
                     But when there is no hope for us t' encreaſe
                     Our owne affliction, and to loſe our ſpirits,
                     Is an infirmity beneath a man:
                     Why ſhould we doubt his ſafe recovery?
                     Since paſſion as we ſee, doth but diſturbe
                     His reaſon, not deſtroy't; when he's at worſt,
                     He'l hearken to the counfell of his friend.
                     How earneſtly he begs, that he may ſpeake
                     With Imperiale, and it ſeemes Iuſtinian
                     
                     Already condiſcends to his requeſt;
                     Me thinks that ſhould not be, ſince he ſuſpects
                     
                        
Him to be privy to Franciſcoes death;
                  
                  
                     Eva.
                     No doubt, Iuſtinian underſtands what's fit;
                     Perchance if once he ſhall his mind unburden
                     His paſſions may remit, or he may ſeeme
                     To promiſe, cauſe he would not have him croſt,
                     Theſe things we wholly muſt commit to him,
                     Whoſe Iudgement's not inferior to his love:
                     He wiſh'd us but withdraw awhile, we muſt
                     Not be farre off, leaſt he ſhould chance to call,
                     For what ſoe'r occaſion they ſhould have
                     Ther's none but we t'aſſiſt: Sango the ſlave
                     Hath taken liberty to go abroad,
                     At his owne pleaſure, who would thinke the Villain
                     Durſt venture to be abſent at this time?
                  
                  
                     Fid.
                     I have obſerv'd a wondrous league of late
                     Betweene him and his Cozen ſlave; how ere
                     Their Lords are far aſunder, they are neere.
                  
                  
                     Eva.
                     T'is ever beſt when ſuch as they are kept
                     To dayly labor, the leaſt eaſe corrupts them.

                     There might perchance be ſome diſcovery made
                     If they were both examined apart,
                     And made beleeve each other had confeſt.

                     Som plot, t'is like to ſteale a ſilver ſpoone
                     To purchaſe Opium, or the drug Tobacco;
                     That is the height of their ambitious theft:

He's now our major Domo, our Lord told me
                     He would deliver his commands by him.
                     He gave me order to make this proviſion.

                     I like him he begins his governement
                     With bounty, now the Cooke may ſhew his skill;

                     O when I ſerv'd the Grand-Dukes maſter Cooke
                     How we were all employd! I can remember,
                     What lectures of our Myſtery hee'd read,
                     Stiling the belly maſter of all arts,
                     And by a modell of his owne invention
                     Demonſtrate how the antique Cookes were wont
                     To dreſſe th'intire Boare; he was a Scholler
                     And would diſcourſe of the delicious Sumen
                     And of the noble Patrons of the kitchin
                     Both Greeks and Romaines; he was wont to ſpeake
                     Moſt reverently of one Apitius,

                     Cooke.
                     A man of a brave ſtomack,
                     That ſpent upon his belly neere three millions,
                     And having caſt up his accounts, and found
                     Only two hundred and od thouſand crownes
                     Remayning to ſupport his appetite,
                     Doubting he ſhould be famiſht, rather choſe
                     To live by fame, and end his life with poiſon:
                     But prethy knock; there was another too,
                     One Nomentanus, but far ſhort of him:
                     Will they not open? we ſhall all be ſhent,
