            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE READER.
            I AM to give Advertisement, that there came forth, of late, a Translation of this Booke, by an unknowne PERSON; Who

though he wished well to the propagating of his Lordships Works, yet he was altogether unacquainted with his Lordships Stile, and Manner of Expressions; And so published a Translation, Lame, and Defective, in the whole. Whereupon, I thought fit, to recommend

the same, to bee translated anew, by a more Diligent, and Zealous Pen; which hath since travailed in it: And though it stil comes short of that Lively, and Incomparable Spirit, and Expression, which lived and died with the Authour; yet I dare avouch it, to

bee much more warrantable, and agreeable, than the Former. It is true, this Booke was not intended to have been published in English; But seeing it hath beene, alreadie, made free of that Language; Whatsoever Benefit, or Delight, may redound from it;

I commend the same to the Courteous, and Judicious Reader.

            To the present Age, and Posteritie, GREETING.
            ALthough we had ranked the Historie of Life and Death, as the last, amongst our six Monethly Designations; yet wee have

thought fit, in respect of the prime use thereof; (In which the least Losse of Time ought to bee esteemed precious;) to invert that Order, and to send it forth in the second place. For we have hope, and wish, that it may conduce to a Common Good; And that the Nobler sort of Physicians
               
will advance their Thoughts; And not employ their Times wholly in the Sordidnesse of Cures; Neither bee Honoured for Necessitie only; But that they will become Coadjutours and Jnstruments of the Divine omnipotence and Clemencie, in Prolonging and Renewing the,

               Life of Man; Especially seeing we pre scribe it to be done by Safe, and Convenient, and Civill wayes, though hitherto un-assayed. For though wee. Christians doe continually aspire, and pant afterthe Land of Promise; Yet it will bee a Token of Gods Favour towards us, in our

Journeyings thorow this worlds wildernes, to have our Shooes, and Garments, (I meane, those of our Fraile Bodies) little worn, or impaired.

            THE History of Life and Death. The Preface.
            
            
               IT is an ancient Saying, and Complaint; That Life is Short, and Art Long. Wherefore, it behoveth us, who make it our chiefest Aime, to perfect Arts; to take upon us, the Consideration, of Prolonging Mans Life; God
               
the Author, of all Truth, and Life, prospering our Endevours. For though the Life of Man bee nothing else, but a Masse, and Accumulation, of Sins, and Sorrowes; And they that looke for an Eternall Life, set but light by a Temporarie; Yet the Continuation of workes of Charity, ought not to be contemned, even by us Christians. Besides, the Beloved Disciple of our Lord, survived the other Disciples; And many of the Fathers of the Church, especially of the Holy Monkes, and Hermits, were

long liv'd; which shewes, that this Blessing of Long life, so often promised in the old Law, had lesse Abatement after our Saviours Dayes, than other Earthly Blessings had. But to esteeme of this, as the chiefest Good, we are but too prone. Onely the Inquirie is difficult, how to attaine the same; And so much the rather, because it is corrupted, with false opinions, and vaine Reports. For both, those Things, which the Vulgar Physitians talke, of Radic all Moisture, and Naturall Heat, are but

meere Fictions; And the Immoderate praises 
                  〈◊〉
                
               Chymicall Medicines, first puffe up with vain hopes, and then faile 
                  〈◊〉
                Admirers.
            And as for that Death, which is caused by Suffocation, Putrefaction, and severall Diseases, wee speake not now; For that pertains to an History of Physick; But onely of that Death which comes by a totall Decay of the Body, and the Inconcoction of old Age. Neverthelesse, the last Act of Death, and the very Extinguishing of Life it selfe;

which may so many wayes bee wrought, outwardly, and inwardly; (which notwithstanding have, as it were, one common Porch, before it comes to the point of Death;) will bee pertinent, to be inquired of in this Treatise; But wee reserve that for the last place.
            That which may bee repaired by Degrees, without a Totall waste of the first Stocke, is potentially eternall; As the Vestall Fire. Therefore, when Physicians, and Philosophers saw, that Living Creatures were nourished, and their

Bodies repaired; But that this did last only for a time; And afterward came old Age, and, in the end, Dissolution; they sought Death in somewhat, which could not properly bee repaired; Supposing a Radical Moisture incapable of solid Reparation; And which, from the first infancie, received a Spurious Addition, but no true Reparation; wherby it grew daily worse and worse; And, in the end, brought the Bad, to None at all. This conceit of theirs, was both ignorant and vain. For all Things, in Living

Creatures, are, in their youth, repaired entirely; Nay, they are, for a time, increased in Quantitie, bettered in Qualitie; so as the Matter of Reparation might be Eternall, if the Manner of Reparation did not faile. But this is the Truth of it: There is, in the Declining of Age, an unequall Reparation; Some Parts are repaired easily, others with Difficultie, and to their losse; So as, from that time, the Bodies of Men begin to endure the Torment of Mezentius; That the Living die in the Embraces
               
               of the Dead; And the Parts easily reparable, through their Conjunction with the Parts hardly reparable, doe decay. For the Spirits, Bloud, Flesh, and Fat, are, even after the Decline of yeares, easily repaired; But the Drier, and more Porous parts, (As the Membranes; All the Tunicles; The Sinewes, Arteries, Veines, Bones, Cartilages; Most of the Bowels; In a word, almost all the Organicall parts;) are hardly Reparable, and to their losse. Now these hardly Reparable Parts,

when they come to doe their office, of Repairing the other, which are easily reparable, finding themselves deprived of their wonted Abilitie, and strength, cease to performe any longer, their proper Functions. By which meanes, it comes to passe, that in processe of time, the whole tends to Dissolution; And even those very Parts, which in their owne nature, are, with much case, Reparable; Yet through the Decay of the Organs of Reparation, can no more receive Reparation; But decline and, in the end, utterly fail.

And the cause of the Termination of Life, is this For that the Spirits, like a gentle Flame, continually preying upon Bodies; Conspiring with the outward Aire, which is ever Sucking, and Drying of them; Doe, in time, destroy the whole Fabricke of the Bodie; As also the particular Engines, and Organs therof; And make them unable, for the worke, of Reparation. These are the true wayes, of Naturall Death, well, and faithfully, to bee revolved in our Mindes. For He that knowes not the

wayes of Nature, how can he succour her, or turne her about?
            Therefore, the Inquisition ought to bee two-fold: The one touching the Consumption, or Depredation, of the Body of Man; The other, touching the Reparation, and Renovation of the same: To the end, that the Former may, as much as is possible, be forbidden and restrained; And the Latter, comforted. The Former of these, pertaines especially, to the Spirits, and Outward Aire; By which the Depredation,
               
and Waste, is committed; The Latter, to the whole Race of Alimentation, or Nourishment; whereby, the Renovation, or Restitution, is made. And as for the Former part, touching Consumption; This hath many Things common, with Bodies Inanimate, or without Life. For such Things, as the Native Spirit, (which is in all Tangible Bodies, whether Living, or without Life;) And the Ambient, or Externall, Aire, worketh upon Bodies Inanimate; The same it attempteth, upon

               Animate, or Living Bodies; Although the Vitall Spirit super added, doth partly breake, and bridle, those Operations; Partly exalt, and advance them wonderfully. For it is most manifest, that Inanimate Bodies, (most of them,) will endure a long time, without any Reparation; But Bodies Animate, without Food, and Reparation, suddenly fall, and are extinguished; As the Fire is. So then, our Inquisition shall be double; First we will consider the Bodie of Man, as Inanimate,
               
and not Repaired by Nourishment; Secondly, as Animate, and Repaired by Nourishment. Thus having prefaced these Things, we come now to the Topick Places of Inquisition.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            The Particular Topick Places: Or, Articles of Inquisition, Touching Life and Death.
            
            1 FIrst inquire, of Nature Durable, and Not Durable; In Bodies Inanimate, or without Life; As also in Vegetables: But that, not in a large, or Just Treatise; But, as in a Briefe, or Summary, onely.
            2 Also inquire diligently, of

               Desiccation, Arefaction, and Consumption, of Bodies Inanmate; And of Vegetables; And of the wayes, and Processes by which they are done: And further of Inhibiting, and De laying, of Desiccation, Arefaction, and Consumption; And the Conservation of Bodies, in their proper State: And a gaine, of the Inteneration, Emellition, and Recovery of Bodies to their former Freshnesse, after they be once dried and withered.
            Neither need the Inquisition, touching these Things, to be full, or exact; seeing they pertaine rather, to their proper Title, of Nature Durable; seeing also, they are not Principals, in this Inquisition; But serve onely, to give Light, to the

               Prolongation, and Instauration of Life, in Living Creatures. In which, (as was said before,) the same Things come to passe, but in a Peculiar manner. So from the Inquisition touching Bodies Inanimate, and Vegetables; Let the Inquisition passe on to other Living Creatures, besides Man.
            
            Inquire, touching the Length, and Shortnesse of Life, in Living Creatures; with the due Circumstances, which make most, for their long, or Short, Lives.
            4 But because the Duration of Bodies, is twofold; One in Identitie, or the selfe-same substance; The other, by a Renovation, or Reparation; whereof the Former, hath

place onely, in Bodies Inanimate; The Latter in Vegetables, and Living Creatures; And is perfected by Alimentation, or Nourishment; Therefore it will be fit to inquire of Alimentation; And of the wayes, and Progresses thereof: Yet this, not exactly; (because it pertaines properly to the Titles of Assimilation, and Alimentation) But as the rest, in progresse only.
            From the Inquisition, touching Living Creatures, and Bodies repaired by Nourishment, passe on to the Inquisition touching Man. And now being come to the principall Subject of Inquisition, the Inquisition ought to bee, in all points, more precise, and accurate.
            
               5 Inquire, touching the Length, and Shortnesse of Life, in Men, according to the Ages of the world; The severall Regions, Climates, and Places, of their Nativity, and Habitation.
            
            6 Inquire, touching the Length, and Shortnesse of Life, in Men, according to their Races, and Families; As if it were a Thing Hereditary: Also according to their Complexions, Constitutions, and Habits of Body; Their Statures; The Manner, and Time, of their Growth; And the Making, and Composition, of their Members.
            
            7 Inquire, touching the Length, and Shortnesse, of Life, in Men, according to the Times of their Nativitie; But so, as you omit, for the present,

all Astrologicall Observations, and the Figures of Heaven, under which they were borne: Onely insist upon the vulgar, and manifest Observations; As, whether they were borne, in the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, or Tenth, Moneth; Also, whether by Night, or by Day; And in what Moneth of the yeare?
            8 Inquire, touching the Length, and Shortnesse, of Life, in Men, according to their Fare, Diet, Government of their Life, Exercises, and the like. For as for the Aire, in which Men live, and make their Abode, we account that proper to be inquired of, in the above-said Article, touching the Places of their Habitation.
            
            9 Inquire, touching the Length, and Shortnesse of Life,
               
in Men, according to their siudies; Their severall Courses of Life; The Affections of the Minde; And divers Accidents befalling them.
            10 Inquire apart, touching those Medicines, which are thought, to prolong Life.
            
            11 Inquire, touching the Signes, and Prognosticks, of Long, and Short Life; Not those which betoken Death, at hand; (for they belong to an Historie of Phisick;) But those, which are seene, and may bee observed, even in Health; whether they bee Physiognomicall signes, or any other.
            Hitherto have beene propounded, Inquisitions touching Length, and Shortnesse of Life, besides the Rules of Art, and in a

confused manner; Now wee thinke to adde some, which shall be more Artlike, And tending to Practice, under the name of Intentions. Those Intentions are, generally, three: As for the particular Distributions of them, we will propound them, when wee come to the Inquisition it selfe. The three generall Intentions are, Toe Forbidding of Waste and Consumption; The Perfecting of Reparation; And the Renewing of Oldnesse.
            
            12 Inquire, touching those things, which Conserve and Exempt the body of man, from Arefaction, and Consumption; At least, which put off, and protract the

inclination thereunto.
            13 Inquire, touching those things, which pertaine to the whole Processe of Alimentation; (By which the body of man is repaired;) that it may bee good, and with the best improvement.
            14 Inquire, touching those things, which purge out the old Matter, and supply with New: As also, which do Intenerate, and Moisten, those parts, which are already Dryed, and Hardned.
            But because it will be hard, to know the wayes of Death, unlesse you search out, and discover, the Seat, or House, or rather Den of Death; It will bee convenient to make Inquisition of this Thing; yet not of every kinde of Death, but

of those Deaths, which are caused, by want, and Indigence of Nourishment, not by violence: For they are those Deaths only, which pertaine to a Decay of Nature, and meere old Age.
            15 Inquire, touching the point of Death; And the porches of Death leading thereunto from all parts: so as that Death be caused, by a Decay of Nature, and not by violence.
            
               Lastly; Because it is behoovefull, to know the Character, and Forme, of Old Age; which will then best be done, if you make a Collection, of all the Differences, both in the State, and Functions, of the Body, 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                Youth, and Old Age; That by them, you
               
               may observe, what it is that produceth such manifeld Effects; let not this Inquisition be omitted.
            
            16 Inquire diligently, touching the Differences, in the State of the Body, and Faculties of the Minde, in Youth, and old Age; And whether there bee any, that remaine the same without Alteration, or 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  , in old Age.
            
         
         
            Nature Durable, and Not Durable.
            
               The Historie.
               
                  MEtals are of that long To the I Artic. lasting, that Men cannot trace the Beginnings of them. And when

they doe decay, they decay through Rust, not through Perspiration into Aire. Yet Gold decayes neither way.
               2 Quick-silver, though it bee an Humide, and Fluide Body: And easily made volatile by Fire; yet, (as farre as wee have observed) by Age alone, without Fire, it neither wasteth, nor gathereth Rust.
               
               3 Stones, especially the harder sort of them, and many other Fossiles, are of long lasting: And that, though they be exposed to the open Aire; Much more, if they bee buried in the Earth. Notwithstanding Stones gather a kinde of Nitre; which is to them, in stead of Rust. Precious Stones, and Crystals, exceed Metals in long Lasting; But then, they grow

dimmer, and lesse Orient, if they be very old.
               4 It is observed, that Stones, lying towards the North, doe sooner decay with Age, than those that lie towards the South; And that this appeares manifestly, in Pyramids, and Churches, and other ancient Buildings: Contrariwise, in Iron, that exposed to the South, gathers Rust sooner; And that to the North, later; As may be seene, in the Iron Barres of windowes. And no marvell, seeing in all Putrefaction, (as Rust is) Moisture hastens Dissolution; In all simple Arefaction, Drinesse.
               5 In Vegetables, (wee speak of such as are feld, not Growing,) the stocks, or Bodies, of harder Trees, and the Timber

made of them, last dive Ages: But then, there is Difference, in the Bodies of Trees Some Trees are, in a 
                     〈◊〉
                   Spongie; as the Elder; In which the pith, in the Midst is sost, and the outward part harder; But in timber trees as the Oake, the inner part, (which they call, Hart of Oake lasteth longer.
               6 The Leaves, and Flowers, and Stalks, of Plants, are but of short Lasting; But dissolve into Dust, unlesse they putrifie: the Roots are more durable.
               7 The Bones of living Creatures last long; as we may see it, of mens Bones, in charnell Houses: Hornes also last very long; so doe Teeth; as it is seene in Ivorie; and the Sea. horse Teeth.
               
               8 Hides also, and Skins, endure

very long; as is evident in old Parchment Books: paper likewise, will last many Ages; though not so long às Parchment.
               
               9 Such Things, as have possed the Fire, last long; as Glasse, and Bricks: Likewise, Flesh, and Fruits, that have passed the fire, last longer, than Raw: And that, not onely, because the Baking in the Fire, forbids putrefaction; But also, because the watrie Humour being drawne forth, the oyly Humour supports it selfe the longer.
               10 Water, of all Liquors, is soonest drunk up by Aire; Contrariwise, Oyle latest: which wee may see, not onely in the Liquors themselves; But in the Liquors mixt with other Bodies: For Paper wet with

water, and so getting some Degree of Transparency, will soone after wax white, and loose the Transparencie again the watrie vapour exhaling: But oiled Paper will keepe the Transparencie long, the 
                     〈◊〉
                   not being apt to exhale: And therefore they, that counterfeit Mens Hands, will lay the oiled Paper upon the writing they meane to counterfe 
                     〈◊〉
                   and then assay to draw the lines.
               11 Gummes, all of them, last very long; The like doe, Wax and Honey.
               
               12 But the Equall, or Vnequaliuse, of Things, conduceth no lesse, to long Lasting, or short Lasting, than the Things themselves. For Timber, and Stones, and other Bodies, standing continually in the Water, or

continually in the Aire, last longer than if they were sometimes wet, sometimes drie. And so Stones continue longer, if they be layed towards the same coast of Heaven, in the Building, that they lay in the Mine. The same is, of Plants removed, if they be coasted just, as they were before.
            
            
               Observations.
               1 LEt this be laid for a Foundation, which is most sure; That there is, in every Tangible Body, a Spirit, or Body Pneumaticall, enclosed, and covered, with the Tangible parts; And that, from this Spirit, is the Beginning of all Dissolution, and Consumption:

so as the Antidote 
                     〈◊〉
                   them, is the Detaining 
                     〈◊〉
                   this Spirit.
               
               2 This Spirit is detained 
                     〈◊〉
                   wayes; Either by astraigh Inclosure, as it were in Prison; Or by a kinde 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Free, and voluntarie Detention. Again, this voluntarie stay is perswaded 
                     〈◊〉
                   wayes: Either if the Spirit it selfe, be not too Moveable, or Eager to depart; Or if the Externall 
                     〈◊〉
                   importune it not too 
                     〈◊〉
                   to come forth. So then, 
                     〈◊〉
                   sorts of substances are Durable; Hard Substance and Oyly: Hard Substance bindes in the spirit close, Oyly, partly enticeth the Spirit to stay; partly, is of that nature, that it is not 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
by Aire: For Aire is Consubstantiall to Water, and Flame to Oile. And touching Nature Durable, and Not Durable, in Bodies Inanimate, thus much.
            
            
               The Historie.
               13 HErbs, of the Colder sort, dye yearly, both in Root, and Stalk; As Lettice, Purslane; Also Wheat, and all Kinde of Corne. Yet there are some Cold Herbs, which will last three, or foure yeares, As the Violet, Strawberrie, Burnet, Prime-rose, and Sorrell But Borage, and Buglosse, which seeme so alike, when they are alive, differ in their Deaths; for Borage will last but one yeare, Buglosse will last more.
               
                  14 But many Hot Herbs, beare their age, and yeares, better Hyssope, Thyme, Savourie, Pot Marjoram, Balme, Wormewood, Germander, Sage; And the like, Fennell, dies yearly in the Stalk, Buds againe from the Root. But Pulse, and sweet Marjoram, can better endure age, than Winter; For being set, in a very warme place, and well senced, they will live more than one yeare. It is knowne that a Knot of Hyssope, twice 
                     〈◊〉
                   yeare shorne, hath continued forty yeares.
               15 Bushes, and Shrubs, live threescore yeares; and some double as much. A Vine may attaine to threescore yeares, and continue Fruitfull in the old age. Rose mary, well placed, will come also to threescore yeares. But White Thorne,
                  
and Ivie, endure above an hundred yeares. As for the Bramble, the age thereof is not certainly knowne; Because bowing the head to the Ground, it gets new Roots; so as you cannot distinguish, the Old, from the New.
               16 Amongst great Trees, the longest Livers are; The Oake, the Holme, the Wild-Ash, the Elme, the Beech-tree, the Chestnut, the Plain-tree, Ficus Ruminalis, the Lote-tree, the Wildolive, the Olive, the Palme-tree, and the Mulberrie-tree: Of these, some have come to the Age of eight hundred yeares; But the least Livers of them, doe attaine to two hundred.
               17 But Trees Odorate, or that have sweet woods; And Trees Rozennie, last longer, in their Woods, or Timber, than

those above said, but they are not so long liv'd; as the Cypresse-tree, Maple, Pine, Box, Iuniper. The Cedar, being borne out, by the vastnesse of his body, lives well-neare 
                     〈◊〉
                   long as the former.
               18 The Ash, fertile, and forward in Bearing, reacheth to an hundred yeares, and somewhat better; which also, the Birch, Maple, and Service-tree, sometimes doe: But the Poplar, Lime-tree, Willow, and that which they call the Cycomore, and Wall-nut-tree, live not so long.
               19 The Apple-tree, Peare-tree, Plum-tree, Pomegranate-tree, Citron-tree, Medlar-tree, BlackCherrie-tree, Cherrie-tree, may attaine to fiftie, or sixtie yeares; Especially, if they be cleansed from the Mosse,

where with some of them are cloathed.
               20 Generally, Greainesse of Body, in Trees, if other things be equall, hath some congruitie, with Length of Life: So hath Hardnesse of Substance: And Trees, bearing Mast, or Nuts, are commonly longer livers, than Trees, bearing Fruit, or Berries: Likewise, Trees putting forth their Leaves late, and shedding them late againe, live longer than those, that are early, either in Leaves, or Fruit: The like is of Wilde trees, in comparison of Orchard Trees: And lastly, in the same kinde, Trees that beare a Sowre Fruit, out-live those that beare a sweet Fruit.
               
            
            
               
               An Observation.
               3 ARistotle noted well 
                     〈◊〉
                   difference between Plants. and living Creatures, in 
                     〈◊〉
                   of their Nourishment, and Reparation; Namely, that the Bodies of living Creatures, an confined within certain Bounds and that after they bee come to their full Growth, they are continued and preserved by Nourishment, but they put forth nothing New, except Haire and Nailes; which are counted for no better than Excrements; so as the juyce of living Creatures, must, of necessitie, sonner wax old: But in Trees, which put forth yearly, new Boughes, new Shoots, new Leaves, and new Fruits; It comes to passe, that all these parts in Trees,
                  
are once a yeare young and renewed; Now it being so, that whatsoever is fresh and young, drawes the Nourishment more lively and cheerfully to it, than that which is Decayed and Old; It happens withall, that the Stock and Body of the Tree, through which the Sap posseth to the Branches, is refreshed and 
                     〈◊〉
                  , with a more bountifull and vigorous Nourishment, in the Passage, than otherwise it would have beene. And this appeares notably, (though Aristotle noted it not; Neither hath bee expressed these things so clearly, and perspicuously;) In Hedges, Copses, and Pollards, when the plashing, shedding, or lopping, comforteth the old Stemme or Stock, and maketh it more flourishing, and longer liv'd.
            
         
         
            
            Desiccation; prohibiting 
                  〈◊〉
                Desiccation; And Inteneration of that, which is desiccated and dried.
            
               The Historie.
               1 FIre, and strong Heats To the 2 Artic. dry some things, and mels others:
               
               
                  Limus ut hic durescit, &amp; 
                        〈◊〉
                      Cera liquescit,
                  Vno eodemque Igne.
               
               How this Clay is hardned, and how this wax is melted, with one, and the same thing, Fire; It dryeth Earth, Stones, Wood, Cloth, and Skins, and whatsoever is not liquefiable; and it melteth Metals, Wax, Gums,

                  Butter, Tallow, and the like.
               2 Notwithstanding, even in those things, which the Fire melteth, if it bee very vehement, and continueth, it doth at last dry them. For Metall, in a strong Fire, (Gold onely excepted,) the volatile part being gone forth, will become lesse ponderous, and more brittle: and those Oyly, and fat Substances, in the like Fire, will burne up, and bee dried, and parched.
               3 Aire, especially open Aire, doth manifestly dry, but not melt: as High wayes, and the upper part of the Earth, moistned with showers, are dryed; 
                        〈◊〉
                      Clothes, washed, if they bee hanged out in the Aire, are likewise dried; Herbs, and Leaves, and Flowers, laid forth in the shade, are dryed.

But much more suddenly doth the Aire this; If it bee either inlightned with the Sun-beames, (so that they cause not putrefaction;) Or if the Aire bee stirred; as when the Winde bloweth; Or in Roomes open, on all sides.
               4 Age, most of all, but yet slowest of all, dryeth; as in all bodies, which (if they be not prevented by putrefaction) are dryed with Age. But Age is nothing of it selfe; being onely the measure of time: That which causeth the Effect, is the native Spirit of bodies, which sucketh up the moisture of the body, and then, together with it, flyeth forth; and the Aire ambient, which multiplieth it selfe, upon the native Spirits, and

jayees of the body, and preyeth upon them.
               5 Cold, of all things, most properly, dryeth; for Drying is not caused, but by Contraction; Now Contraction is the proper work of Cold. But because we Men have Heat in a high Degree, namely that of Fire; but Cold in a very low Degree, none other than that of Winter; Or perhaps of Ice, or of Snow, or of Nitre: therefore the Drying caused by Cold, is but weak, and easily resolved. Notwithstanding wee see the Surface of the Earth, to bee more dryed by Frost, or by March windes, than by the Sunne; seeing the same winde, both licketh up the moisture, and affecteth with Coldnesse.
               
               6 Smoak is a Dryer; as in Bacon, and Neats Tongues
                  
which are hanged up in chimneys: and perfumes of Olibanum, or Lignum Aloes, and the like, dry the Braine, and cure Catarrhs.
               
               7 Salt, after some reasonable continuance, dryeth; not only on the outside, but in the inside also; as in Flesh and Fish salted, which if they have continued any long time, have a manifest hardnesse within.
               8 Hot Gummes, applied to the skin, dry, and wrinkle it: and some Astringent waters also doe the same.
               9 Spirit of strong wines, imitateth the Fire in Drying: For it will both potch an Egge, put into it; and toast Bread.
               10 Powders dry like Sponges, by Drinking up the Moisture, as it is in Sand, throwneupon

Lines, new written. Also Smoothnesse, and Politenesse of Bodies, (which suffer not the Vapour of Moisture, to goe in by the Pores,) Drie by accident, because it exposeth it to the Aire; As it is seene in Precious Stones, Looking-Glasses, and Blades of Swords; Upon which if you breathe, you shall see at first a little Mist; But soone after it vanisheth, like a Cloud. And thus much for Desiceation, or Drying.
               
               11 They use at this day, in the East parts of Germany, Garners, in Vaults under Ground; wherin they keepe wheat, and other Graines; Laying a good Quantity of Straw, both under the Graines, and about them, to save them from the Danknesse of the Vault: By which Device, they keepe

their Graiaes twenty, or thirtie yeares. And this doth not only preserve them from Eustinesse, but (that which pertaines more to the present Inquisition,) preserves them also in that Greennesse, that they are fit, and serviceable to make Bread. The same is reported, to have beene in use, in Cappadocia, and Thracia, and some parts of Spaine.
               
               12 The placing of Garners, on the Tops of Houses, with Windowes towards the East, and North, is very commodious. Some also make two Sollars; An Upper, and a Lower; And the upper Sollar hath an Hole in it; thorow which the Graine continually descendeth, like Sand in an Houre-glasse; And after a few dayes, they throw it up

againe with Shovels; That so it may be in continuall Motion. Now it is to bee noted, that this doth not onely prevent the Fustinesse, but conserveth the Greennesse, and slacketh the Desiccation of it: The cause is that Which we noted before; That the Discharging of the watry Humor, Which is quickned by the Motion, and the Winds, preserves the Oily Humour in his Being; Which otherwise would fly out, together with the Watry Humour. Also in some Mountaines, where the Aire is very pure, Dead Carkases may bee kept for a good while, without any great Decay.
               13 Fruits; As Pomegranates, Cytrons, Apples, Peares, and the like. Also Flowers; As Roses, and Lilies; may bee kept, a

long time, in Earthen Vessels close stopped. Howsoever they are not free from the Injuries of the outward Air which will affect them, wit. his unequall Temper, thorow the sides of the Vessell; As 
                     〈◊〉
                   is manifest, in Heat and cold Therefore it will bee good to stop the Mouthes of the Vessels carefully, and to bury them within the Earth. And it will be as good: Not to bury them in the Earth, but to sinke them in the Water, so as the place be shady; As in Wels: Or Cisternes placed within Doores: But those that bee sunke in Water, will doe better in Glasse vessels, than in Earthen.
               14 Generally, those Things which are kept in the Earth, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   in Vaults under Ground, or in

the Bottome of a Well, will preserve their Freshnesse longer, than those Things that are kept above Ground.
               
               15 They say, it hath been observed; That in Conservatories of Snow, (whether they were in Mountaines, in Naturall Pits, or in Wells made by Art, for that purpose) an Apple, or Chest-nut, or Nut, by chance falling in, after many Moneths, when the Snow hath melted, have beene found in the Snow, as fresh and faire, as if they had been gathered the day before.
               16 Country people keep Clusters of Grapes in Meale; which though it makes them lesse pleasant to the taste, yet it preserves their Moisture, and Freshnesse. Also the Harder sort of Fruits may bee kept

long, not onely in Meale, but also in Saw-dust, and in 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   of Corne.
               
               17 There is an opinion held; That Bodies may be preserved Fresh in Liquours of their own kind; As in their proper 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   As to keepe Grapes in wine, Olives in Oyle.
               
               18 Pomegrants, and Quinces, are kept long, being lightly dipped in Sea water, or Saltwater; And soone after taken out againe; and then dryed in the open Aire, so it bee in the Shade.
               19 Bodies put in Wine, Oyle, or the Lees of Oyle, keepe long; Much more in Honey, or Spirit of Wine; But most of all, as some say, in Quick-silver.
               
               20 Fruits enclosed in Wax, Pitch, Plaister, Paste, or any the like Case, or Covering,

keep green very long.
               21 It is manifest, that Flyes, Spiders, Ants, or the like small Creasures, falling by chance into Amber, or the Gums of Trees, and so finding a Buriall in them, doe never after corrupt, or rot, although they be soft and tender Bodies.
               22 Grapes are kept long by being hanged up in Bunches; The same is of other Fruits. For there is a twofold commodity of this Thing; The one, that they are kept without Pressing, or Bruising; which they must needs suffer, if they were laid upon any hard substance; The other, that the Aire doth encompasse them, on every side alike.
               23 It is observed, that Putrefaction, no lesse than Desiccation,
                  
in Vegetables, doth not 
                     〈◊〉
                   in every part alike; But chiefly in that part, where, being alive, it did attract Nourishment. Therefore some advise, to cover the Stalkes 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Apples, or other Fruits, with Wax, or Pitch.
               
               24 Great Wiekes of Candles, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Lamps, doe sooner 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Tallow, or Oyle, than 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Wiekes: Also Wieks of Cotton sooner than those of Rush, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Straw, or small Twigs: And in Staves of Torches, those of Iuniper, or Firre, sooner than those of Ash: Likewise, Flame, Moved, and Fanned with the Wind, sooner than that which is still; And therefore Candles, set in a Lanthorne, will last longer, than in the Open Aire. There is a Tradition, that Lamps set in Sepulchers,
                  
will last an incredible time.
               25 The Nature also, and Preparation of the Nourishment, conduceth no lesse, to the Lasting of Lamps, and Candles, than the Nature of the Flame: For Wax will last longer than Tallow; And Tallow a little wet, longer than Tallow dry; And Wax Candles old made, longer than Wax Candles new made.
               26 Trees, if you stir the Earth about their Roots, every yeare, will continue lesse time; If once in foure, or perhaps in ten yeares, much longer: Also Cutting off the Suckers, and Young Shoots, will make them live the longer: But Dunging them, or laying of Marle about their Roots, or much Watring them, addes to their fertility, but cuts off from their long Lasting. And thus

                  Dryed, (which is the chiefe Matter,) affords but a small Number of Experiments: And therefore some few Experiments wch are found in

                      Creatures, and also in Man shall be joyned together.
               27 Bands of Willow, wherewith they use to bind Trees, laid in water, grow more Flexible. Likewise, they put Boughes of Birch, (the ends of them) in earthen Pots filled with water, to keepe them from withering; And Bowles cleft with Drinesse, steeped in water, close againe.
               28 Boots, growne hard and obstinate with age, by greasing

                     , wax soft; or being only held before the Fire, get some softnesse: Bladders, and Parchments, hardened also, become tender, with warme water, mixed with Tallow, or any Fat Thing; But much the better, if they be a little Chofed.

               30 Old Draught Oxen, worne out with labour, being taken from the yoke, and put into fresh Pasture, will get young and tender Flesh againe; In so much, that they will eat, as Fresh and tender, as a Steere.
               
               31 A strict Emaciating Dyet, of

                  Guaiacum, Bisket, and the like; (wherewith they use to cure the French Pox, old Catarrhs, and some kinde of Dropsies,) doth first bring men to great Povertie and Leannesse, by wasting the Juyces and Humours of the Body; which after they begin to be repaired againe, seeme 
                     〈◊〉
                   more vigorous and young: Nay, and we are of Opinion, that Emaciating Diseases, afterwards well cured, have advanced many in the way of Long Life.
               
            
            
               Observations.
               1 MEn see clearly, like Owles in the Night, of their owne Notions; But in Experience, as in the Day-light, they winke, and are but halfe-sighted.

They speake much, of the Elementary Quality of Siccity, or Drinesse; And of Things Desiccating; And of the Naturall Periods of Bodies, in which they are Corrupted, and consumed: But meane while, either in the Beginnings, or Middle Passages, or Last Acts, of Desiccation, and Consumption, they observe nothing, that is of Moment.
               2 Desiccation, or Consumption, in the Processe thereof, is finished by three Actions; And all these, (as was said before,) have their Originall, from the Native Spirit of bodies.
               3 The First Action is, the Attenuation of the Moisture into Spirit; The Second is, the Issuing forth, or Flight of the Spirit; The third is, the Contraction, of the Grosser Parts of the

Body, immediately after the Spirit issued forth: And this last, is that Desiccation, and Induration, which we chiefly handle; The Former Two consume only.
               4 Touching Attenuation, the matter is manifest. For the Spirit, which is enclosed in every Tangible Body, forgets not his Nature; But whatsoever it meets withall in the Body, (in which it is enclosed,) that it can disgest, and master, and turne into it selfe; That it plainly alters, and subdues, and multiplies it selfe upon it, and begets new Spirit. And this is evicted, by one Proofe, in stead of many; For that those Things, which are 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Dryed, are Lessened in their Weight; And become Hollow, Porous, and Resounding from within. Now it is most certaine, that the Inward Spirit of

any Thing, confers Nothing to the Weight; But rather Lightens it; And therefore it must needs be, that the same Spirit, hath turned into it, the Moisture and Juyce of the Body, which weighed before; By which Meanes the Weight is lessened. And this is the first Action; The Attenuation of the Moisture, and Converting it into Spirit.
               
               5 The second Action, which is the Issuing forth or Flight of the Spirit, is as manifest also. For that Issuing forth, when it is in throngs, is apparent even to the Sense; In Vapours, to the Sight; In Odours, to the Smelling: But if it issueth forth slowly; (As when a Thing is decayed by Age,) then it is not apparent to the Sense; But the Matter is the same. Againe, where the Composure

of the Body, is either so Strait, or so Tenacious, That the Spirit can finde no Pores, or Passages, by which to depart, Then, in the striving to get out, it drives before it the grosser Parts of the Body; And protrudes them beyond the Superficies, or Surface of the Bodit; As it is in the Rust of Metals; And Mould of all Fat Things. And this is the second Action; The Issuing forth, or Flight of the Spirit.
               
               6 The third Action, is somewhat more obscure, but full as certaine: That is; The Contraction, of the Grosser Parts, after the Spirit issued forth. And this appeares first, in that Bodies after the Spirit issued forth, doe manifestly Shrinke, and 
                     〈◊〉
                   a lesse Roome; As it is in the Kernels of Nuts, which after

they are dryed, are too little for the Shells; And in Beames, and Planchers of Houses, which at first lay closo together, but after they are dryed, gape; And likewise in Bowles, which through Drought, grow full of Cranies, The Parts of the Bowle contracting themselves together, and after Contraction must needs be emptie Spaces. Secondly, it appeares by the Wrinkles of Bodies Dryed: For the Endevour of Contracting it selfe, is such; That by the Contraction, it brings the Parts nearer together, and so lifts them up; For whatsoever is Contracted on the sides, is lifted up in the Midst; And this is to be seene, in Papers, and old Parchments; And in the Skins of Living Creatures; And in the Coats of Soft Cheeses; All which, with

Age, gather wrinkles. Thirdly this Contraction shewes 
                     〈◊〉
                   selfe Most, in those Things, which by Heat, are not only wrinkled but ruffled, and plighted, and, 
                     〈◊〉
                   it were, rowled together; As it is in Papers, and Parchments, and Leaves, brought neare the Fire. For Contraction, by Age, which is more Slow, commonly causeth wrinkles; But Contraction, by the Fire, which is 
                     〈◊〉
                   speedie, causeth Plighting. Now in most Things, where it 
                     〈◊〉
                   not to Wrinkling, or Plighting, there is simple Contraction, and Angustiation, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   Straitning, and Induration 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   Hardning, and Desiccation; As was shewed in the first place: But if the Issuing forth of the Spirit; and Absumption, or waste of the Moisture, bee so great; That there is not left Bodie

sufficient, to unite, and contract it selfe; Then, of Necessitie, Contraction must cease; And the Bodie 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Putride; And nothing else, but a little Dust, cleaving together, which with a light touch, is dispersed, and falleth asunder; As it is in Bodies that are Rotten, and in Paper burnt; And Linnen made into Tinder; And Carkaises Embalmed, after many Ages. And this is the Third Action; The Contraction of the Grosser Parts, after the Spirit issued forth.
               7 It is to be noted; That Fire, and Heat, dry only by Accident. For their proper Worke is, to attenuate, and dilate the Spirit, and Moisture; And then it followes by Accident, that the other Parts should contract themselves; Either for the Flying of Vacuum alone; Or for some other Motion
                  
withall; Whereof we now speake not.
               8 It is certaine that Putrefaction, takes his Originall, from the Native Spirit, no lesse than Arefaction; But it goeth on a far different way; For in Putrefaction, the Spirit, is not simply vapoured forth; But being detained in Part, workes strange Garboises; And the Grosser Parts, are not so much locally contracted, as they congregate themselves to Parts of the same Nature.
            
         
         
            
            Length, and Shortnesse of Life in living Creatures.
            
               The Historie.
               TOuching the Length, 
                  To the 1. Article. and Shortnes of Life, in Living Creatures, the Information, which may bee had, is but Slender; Observation is Negligent; And Tradition Fabulous: In Tame Creatures, their 
                     〈◊〉
                   Life, corrupteth them; In wilde Creatures, their Exposing to all weathers, often intercepteth them. Neither doe those Things, which may seeme Concomitants, give any Furtherance, to this Information, (The Greatnesse of their Bodies; Their Time of Bearing in the Womb;
                  
The Number of their Young ones; The Time of their Growth, And the Rest;) In regard that these Things are Intermixed, And sometimes they concur, sometimes they sever:
               1 Mans Age, (as farre as can be gathered by any certaine Narration,) doth exceed the Age, of all other Living Creatures; Except it be, of a very few only. And the Concomitants in him, are very equally disposed; His Stature, and Proportion, large; His Bearing in the Wombe, nine Moneths; His Fruit, commonly, one, at a Birth; His Pubertie at the Age of Fourteen yeares; His Time of Growing, till Twenty.
               2 The Elephant, by undoubted Relation, exceeds the Ordinary Race of Mans life: But his Bearing in the Wombe,
                  
the space of ten yeares, is fabulous; Of two yeares, or at least, above one, is certaine: Now his Bulke is great; His Time of Growth, untill the thirtieth yeare; His Teeth exceeding hard: Neither hath it beene unobserved; That his Bloud is the coldest of all Creatures: His Age, hath sometimes reached, to two hundred yeares.
               3 Lions are accounted long Livers, because many of them, have been found Toothlesse; A signe not so certaine; For that may bee caused, by their strong Breath.
               4 The Beare is a great Sleeper; A Dull Beast, and given to ease; And yet not noted for long Life: Nay hee hath this signe of short Life; That his Bearing in the Wombe is but

short; scarce full forty dayes.
               5 The Fox seemes to bee well disposed, in many Things, for long life; He is well skinned, feeds on Flesh, lives in Dens; And yet hee is noted not to have that propertie. Certainly, hee is a kinde of Dog; And that kinde is but short liv'd.
               6 The Camell is a long Liver: A lean Creature, and Sinewy: So that he doth ordinarily attaine to Fifty; And some. times to an hundred yeares.
               7 The Horse lives but to a moderate Age; searce to fortie yeares; His ordinarie Period is Twentie yeares. But perhaps, he is beholding, for this shortnesse of his Life, to Man: For we have now no Horses of the Sunne; That live freely, and at pleasure, in good pastures.

Notwithstanding the Horse growes, till hee bee six yeares old; And is able for Generation, in his Old Age. Besides, the Mare goeth longer with her young one, than a Woman; And brings forth two at a Burthen more rarely. The Asse lives commonly to the Horses Age; But the Mule out-lives them both.
               8 The Hart is famous amongst Men, for long Life; yet not upon any Relation, that is undoubted. They tell of a certaine Hart, that was found with a Coller about his Neck, and that Coller hidden with Fat. The long Life of the Hart, is the lesse credible, because hee comes to his perfection at the Fifth yeare; And not long after, his Hornes, (which hee sheds, and

renewes yearely) grow more Narrow at the Root, and lesse Branched.
               9 The Dag is but a short Liver: He exceeds not the Age of Twentie yeares; And for the most part lives not to fourteen yeares. A Creature of the hottest Temper, and living in extremes; for he is commonly, either in vehement Motion, or Sleeping Besides, the Bitch, bringeth forth many at a Burthen, and goeth nine weekes.
               10 The Oxe likewise, for the Greatnesse of his Body, and Strength, is but a short Liver; About some sixteen yeares: And the Males live longer than the Females: Notwithstanding, they beare, usually, but one at a Burthen, and goe nine Moneths. A Creature

dull, and fleshy, and soone fatted, and living onely upon Herby substances, without Graine.
               11 The Sheep seldome lives to ten yeares; Though hee bee a Creature, of a moderate size, and excellently clad: And, that which may seeme a wonder, being a Creature with so little Gall, yet hee hath the most curled coat of any other; For the Haire, of no Creature, is so much curled, as Wooll is. The Rams generate not before the third yeare; And continue able for Generation, untill the eighth: The Ewes beare young, as long as they live. The Sheep is a diseased Creature; And rarely lives to his full Age.
               12 The Goat lives to the same Age, with the Sheepe; And is

not much unlike in other Things; Though hee bee a Creature more Nimble, and of somewhat a firmer Flesh; And so should bee longer liv'd: But then hee is much more lascivious; And that shortens his Life.
               13 The Sow lives to fifteen yeares, sometimes to twentie: And though it be a Creature of the Moistest Flesh; yet that seemes to make nothing to Length of Life. Of the Wilde Boare, or Sow, we have nothing certaine.
               14 The Cats Age, is betwixt six, and ten yeares. A Creature nimble, and full of spirit, whose seed, (As Aelian repotteth) burneth the Female. Whereupon it is said; That the Cat conceives with paine, and brings forth with ease. A creature

ravenous in eating; Rather swallowing downe his Meat whole, than Feeding.
               15 Hares and Conies attaine scarce to seven yeares: Being both Creatures Generative, and with young ones, of severall conceptions, in their bellies: In this, they are unlike, that the Coney lives under Ground, and the Hare above Ground; And againe, that the Hare is of a more duskish Flesh.
               16 Birds, for the size of their Bodies, are much lesser than Beasts: for an Eagle, or Swan, is but a small Thing, in comparison of an Oxe, or Horse; And so is an Estrich, to an Elephant.
               
               17 Birds are excellently well clad; For Feathers, for warmth, and close sitting, to the Body, exceed wooll, and Haires.
               
               
                  18 Birds, though they hatch many young ones together, yet they beare them not all in their Bodies at once; Butlay their Egges by turnes; whereby, their Fruit hath the more plentifull nourishment, 
                     〈◊〉
                   it is in their bodies.
               19 Birds chew, little, or nothing; but their Meat is found whole in their crops; Notwithstanding they will breake the shels of Fruits, and pick out the Kernels: They are thought to bee, of a very hot, and strong concoction.
               20 The Motion of Birds, in their Flying, is a mixt Motion Consisting, of a moving of the Lims, and of a kinde of Carriage, which is, a most wholesome kinde of Exercise.
               21 Aristotle noted well, touching the Generation of

                  Birds; (But hee transferred it ill to other living Creatures;) That the seed of the Male, confers lesse to Generation, than the Female. But that it rather affords Activity, than Matter: so that Fruitfull Egges, and unfruitfull Egges, are hardly distinguished.
               22 Birds, (almost all of them,) come to their full Growth, the first yeare, or a little after: It is true, that their Feathers, in some kindes, and their Bils, in others, shew their yeares; But for the Growth of their Bodies, it is not so.
               23 The Eagle is accounted a long Liver; yet his yeares are not set downe. And it is alledged, as a signe of his long life; That he casts his Bill; whereby hee growes young againe. From whence comes

that Proverb; The Old Age of an Eagle. Notwithstanding, perchance, the matter may be thus; That the Renewing of the Eagle doth not cast his Bill; But the casting of his Bill, is the Renewing of the Eagle: For after that his Bill is growne, to a great crookednesse, the Eagle feeds, with much difficultie.
               24 Vultures also are affirmed to bee long Livers; Insomuch, that they extend their Life, well-neare to an hundred yeares: Kites likewise, and so all Birds that feed upon Flesh, and Birds of prey, live long. As for Hawkes, because they lead a degenerate, and servile life, for the Delight of Men; The Terme of their Naturall Life is not certainly knowne: Notwithstanding, amongst

                  Mewed Hawkes, some have beene found, so have lived thirty yeares. And amongst wilde Hawkes, forty yeares.
               25 The Raven likewise, is reported to live long; Sometimes, to an hundred yeares. Hee feeds on Carrion; And flies not often, but rather is a se dentarie, and Melancholy Bird; And hath very black flesh. But the Crow, like unto him in most Things; (Except in Greatnesse, and voice;) lives not altogether so long; And yet is reckoned amongst the long Livers.
               26 The Swan, is certainly found, to bee a long Liver; And exceeds, not unfrequently, an hundred yeares. He is a Bird excellently plumed; A Feeder upon Fish; And is alwayes

carried; And that in Running Waters.
               27 The Goose also may passe amongst the Long-livers; Though his food bee commonly Grasse, and such kinde of Nourishment: Especially, the Wilde-Goose; whereupon, this Proverb grew amongst the Germans; Magis senex quam Anser Nivalis; Older than a Wilde-Goose.
               
               28 Storks must needs bee Long-livers; If that bee true, which was anciently observed of them; That they never came to 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   because that Citie was often sacked. This if it were so; Then either, they must have the knowledge of more Ages than one; Or else the old Ones, much tell their young, the Historie. But there

is Nothing more frequent, than Fables.
               
               29 For Fables doe so abound, touching the Phoenix; That the Truth is utterly lost, if any such Bird there be. As for that, which was so much admired; That shee was ever seen abroad, with a great Troope of Birds about her, it is no such wonder: For the same is usually seene, about an Owl flying in the Day time, or a Parret, let out of a Cage.
               30 The Parret, hath been certainly knowne, to have lived threescore yeares in England; How old soever hee was, before he was brought over. A Bird, eating almost all kinde of Meats, chewing his Meat, and renewing his Bill; Likewise, curst, and mischievous,

and of a black Flesh.
               31 The Peacock lives Twentie yeares; But hee comes not forth with his Argus Eyes, before he be three yeares old: A Bird slow of pace, having whitish Flesh.
               32 The Dunghill Cock, is venereous, Martiall, and but of a short life; A cranck Bird; Having also white Flesh.
               33 The Indian Cock, commonly called, The Turkey-Cock. lives not much longer, that the Dunghill-Cock: An Angry Bird; And hath exceeding white Flesh.
               34 The Ring-Doves, are of the longest sort of Livers; Insomuch, that they attaine, sometimes, to fiftie yeares of Age: An Aëry Bird; And both Builds, and Sits, on high: But Doves, and Turtles, are but

short liv'd, not exceeding eight yeares.
               35 But Pheasants, and 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , may live to sixteen yeares: They are great Breeders; But not so white of Flesh, as the ordinarie Pullen.
               
               36 The Black-Bird is reported to be, amongst the lesser Birds, one of the longest livers: An unhappy Bird, and a good Singer.
               37 The Sparrow is noted to be of a very short Life; And it is imputed, in the Males, to their Lasciviousnesse. But the Linnet, no bigger in Body, than the Sparrow, hath beene observed, to have lived twentie yeares.
               38 Of the Estrich, we have nothing certaine: Those that were kept here, have beene so unfortunate, that no long life

appeared by them. Of

                   long; But his yeare are not recorded.
               39 The Age of Fishes is 
                     〈◊〉
                   uncertaine, than that of Terrestriall Creatures; Because living under the water, 
                     〈◊〉
                   are the lesse observed. 
                     〈◊〉
                   of them breath not; By

                   meanes, their vitall 
                     〈◊〉
                   more closed in: And there fore, though they 
                     〈◊〉
                   some Refrigeration, by 
                     〈◊〉
                   Gils; yet that Refrigeration is not so continuall, as 
                     〈◊〉
                   it is by Breathing.
               40 They are free, from the Diccation, and Depredation,

                   there is no Doubt, but the Water Ambient, and piercing

and received into the pores of their Body, doth more Hurt, to long Life, than the Aire doth.
               41 It is affirmed too, that their 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   is not Warme: Some of them: are great Devourers, even of their owne kinde. Their Flesh is softer, and more tender, than that of Terrestriall Creatures. They grow exceedingly fat; Insomuch, that an Incredible Quantitie of Oyle will be extracted out of one Whole.

                   reported to live about thirty yeares: Of which Thing, a Triall was taken, in some of them, by cutting off their Tailes: They grow untill ten yeares of Age.
               43 That which they report, of some Fishes, is strange; That after a certaine Age,

their Bodies will waste, and grow very slender; Onely their Head, and Taile, retaining their former Greatnesse.
               44 There were found, in Caesars Fish-ponds, Lampreys to have lived threescore yeares: They were growne so familiar, with long use, That Crassus the Orator, solemnly lamented One of them.
               45 The Pike, amongst Fishes living in fresh water, is found to last longest; sometimes 
                     〈◊〉
                   forty yeares: He is a 
                     〈◊〉
                   of a Flesh, somewhat Dry, and Firme.
               46 But the Carp, Breame, 
                        〈◊〉
                     , and the like; Are no held to live, above ten yeares
               47 Salmons are Quicke of Growth, short of Life; So are Trouts: But the Perch is slow of Growth, long of life.
               
                  48 Touching that monstrous Bulk, of the Whale, or Orke; How long it is wielded by vitall Spirit; Wee have received Nothing certaine: Neither yet, touching the Sea-calf, and Sea Hog, and other innumerable Fishes.
               
               49 Crocodiles are reported to be exceeding long liv'd; And re famous, fer the Time of their Growth; For that they, amongst all other Creatures, are thought to grow, during their whole life. They are of those Creatures, that lay Egges; Ravenous, cruell, and well fenced against the waters. Touching the other kindes of Shell. Fish, wee finde Nothing certaine, how long they live.
            
            
               
               Observations.
               To finde out a Rule, touching Length, and Shcrtnesse, of Life, in Living Creatures, is very difficult; By reason of the Negligence of Observations, and the Intermixing of Causes: A few Things wee will set downe.
               1 There are more kindes of Birds, found to bee long liv'd, than of Beasts; (As the Eagle the Vultur, the Kite, the Pelican, the Raven, the Crow, the Swan, the Goose, the Storke, the Crane, the Bird called the Ibis, the Parret, the Ring Dove, with the rest;) Though they come to their full Growth, within a yeare; And are lesse of Bodies. Surely, their Clothing is excellent good against the Distemperatures

of the wether; And besides, living, for the most part, in the open Aire, they are like the Inhabitants of pure Mountaines, which are long liv'd. Againe, their Motion; which, (as we else where said,) is a mixt Motion; Compounded of a Moving of their Lims, and of a Carriage in the Aire; doth lesse wearie, and weare them; And is more wholesome. Neither doe they suffer any Compression, or want of Nourishment, in their Mothers Bellies; Because the Egges are laid by Turnes: But the chiesest cause of all, I take to be this; That Birds are made more of the substance of the Mother, than of the Father; whereby their Spirit is not so eager, and hot.
               2 It may bee a position; That Creatures, which partake more

of the substance of their Mother than of their Father, are longer liv'd; As Birds are; which 
                     〈◊〉
                   said before. Also that those which have a longer time of Bearing in the wombe, doe 
                     〈◊〉
                   more of the substance of the Mother, lesse of the Father; And si are longer liv'd: Insomuch 
                     〈◊〉
                   wee are of opinion, that even 
                     〈◊〉
                   mongst Men, (which wee 
                     〈◊〉
                   noted in some,) those that resemble their Mothers most, are longest liv'd: And so are the children of old Men, begotten upon young wives; If the Fathers be sound not Diseased.
               3 The First Breeding of Creatures, is ever most Materiall, either to their Hurt, or Benefit And therefore it stands with Reason; That the lesser Compression, and the more liberall Alimentation, of the young
                  
                  one, in the wombe, should conferre much to Long Life; Now this happens, when either the young ones are brought forth successively, as in Birds; Or when they are single Births; As in Creatures bearing but one at a Burthen.
               4 But long Bearing, in the wombe, makes for Length of Life, three wayes. First, for that the young one partakes more of the substance of the Mother; As hath beene said. Secondly, that it comes forth, more strong, and able. Thirdly, that it undergoes the predatorie Force of the Aire, sater. Besides it shewes, that Nature intendeth to finish her periods, by larger Circles. Now though Oxen, and Sheepe, which are borne in the wombe, about six Moneths, are but short liv'd: That happens

for other Causes.
               5 Feeders upon Grasse, and 
                     〈◊〉
                   Herbs, are but short Livers; And Creatures, feeding upon Flesh, or Seeds, or Fruits, long Livers; As some Birds are. As for Harts, which are long liv'd; They take the one Halfe of their Meat, (As men use to say,) from above their Heads. And the Goose, besides Grasse, findeth something in the water, and stubble, to feed upon.
               6 Wee suppose, that a good Clothing of the Body, maketh much to long Life: For it Fenceth, and Armeth, against the Intemperances of the Aire, which dot wonderfully Assaile, and Decay, the Body: which Benefit Birds especially have. Now that Sheep, which have so good Fleeces, should bee so short 
                     〈◊〉
                  ; That is to bee impated to Diseases, whereof

that Creature is full; and to the bareeating of Grasse.
               7 The Seat of the Spirits, without doubt, is principally the Head: Which though it bee usually understood, of the Animall Spirits onely, yet this is all in all. Againe, it is not to bee doubted, but the Spirits doe, most of all, waste, and prey upon the Body; so that, wher they are either in greater plentie; Or in greater Inflammation, and Acrimonie; There the life is much shortned. And therefore wee conceive, a great Cause of long life, in Birds, to bee; The Smalnesse of their Heads, in comparison of their Bodies: For even Men, which have very great Heads, wee suppose to be the shorter Livers.
               8 We are os opinion; That Carriage, is of all other Motions, the most helpfull to long life; which

we also noted before. Now there are carried; Water-fowles, upon the water; As Swans; All Birds in their flying, but with a strong Endevour of their Lime; And Fishes, of the length of whose Life, wee have no certaintie.
               9 Those Creatures which are long, before they come to their perfection; (Net speaking of Growth in stature onely, but of other steps to Maturitie; As Manputs forth, First his 
                     〈◊〉
                   Next the Signes of Pube, tie; Then his Beard; And so forward;) are Long-liv'd. For it shewes, that Nature finisheth her Periods, by larger Circles.
               10 Milder Creatures, are not long-liv'd; As the Sheepe, and Dove: for Choler is as the Whetstone, and Spur, to many Functions in the Body.
               
                  11 Creatures, whose Flesh is more Duskish, are longer liv'd, than those that have white Flesh: for it sheweth, that the Iuyce of the Body is more firme, and lesse apt to dissipate.
               12 In every Corruptible Body, Quantitie maketh much, to the Conservation of the whole: For a great fire is longer in Quenching; A small portion of water is sooner evaporated; The Body of a Tree withereth not so fast as a Twig: And therefore generally; (I speak it of Species, not of Individuals;) Creatures that are large in Body, are longer liv'd than thos that are small; unlesse there be some other potent Cause, to hinder it.
            
         
         
            
            Alimentation, or Nourishment; And the way of Nourishing.
            
               The Historie.
               1 NOurishment ought to To the 4. Artile. bee of an Inferiour nature, and more simple substance, than the Thing Nourished. Plants are nourished with the Earth and Water; Living Creatures with Plants; Man with Living Creatures: There are also certain Creatures Feeding upon Flesh; And Man himselfe, takes Plants, into a part of his Nourishment: But Man, and Creatures feeding upon Flesh,

are scarcely nourished with Plants alone. Perhaps, Fruits, or Graines, baked, or boyled, may, with long use, nourish them; But Leaves, of Plants, or Herbs, will not doe it; As the Order of the Foliatanes, shewed by Experience.
               2 Over-great Affinity, or Consubstantiality of the Nourishment, to the Thing nourished, proveth not well: for Creatures, feeding upon Herbs, touch no Flesh; And of Creatures feeding upon Flesh, few of them eat their owne kinde. As for Men, which are Cannibals, they feed not ordinarily upon Mens Flesh; But reserve it as a Dainty, either to serve their Revenge upon their Enemies, or to satisfie their Appetite at some times. So the Ground is best sowne, with

                  Seed growing else-where; And Men do not use to Graft, or Inoculate, upon the same stocke.
               3 By how much the more the Nourishment is better Prepared, and approacheth nearer in likenesse, to the Thing nourished; By so much the more, are Plants more Fruitfull; And Living Creatures in better liking, and plight. For a young Slip, or Cions, is not so well nourished, if it bee pricked into the Ground; As if it be grafted into a Stecke, agreeing wich it in Nature; And where it findes the Nourishment alreadie disgested, and prepared: Neither, (as is reported,) will the Seed of an Onion, or some such like, sown in the bare earth, bring forth so large a Fruit, as if it be put

into another Onion; Which is a new kind of Grafting; Into the Root, or under ground: Againe it hath beene found out lately; That a Slip of a Wilde Tree; As of an Elme, Oake, Ash, or such like, grafted into a Stock of the same kind, wil bring forth larger Leaves, than those that grow without Grafting: Also Men, are not nourished so well with Raw Flesh, as with that which hath passed the Fire.
               4 Living Creatures are nourished by the Mouth; plants by the Root; Young ones in the Womb, by the Navill: Birds, for a while, are nourished with the Yolke in the Egge; whereof some is found in their Crops, after they are hatched.
               5 All Nourishment moveth, from the Center, to the Circum
                  
                  cumference; Or, from the Inward, to the Outward: yet it is to be noted; That in Trees, and Plants, the Nourishment passeth, rather by the Barke, and outward Parts, than by the Pith, and inward parts: For if the Barke be pilled off, though but for a small bredth, round, they live no more: And the Bloud, in the Veines of Living Creatures, doth no lesse nourish the Flesh beneath it, than the Flesh above it.
               6 In all Alimentation, or Nourishment, there is a two-fold Action; Extrusion, and Attraction: whereof the Former proceeds from the Inward Function, the latter from the Outward.
               7 Vegetables assimilate their Nourishment simply, without

Excerning: For Gums, and Teares of Trees, are rather Exuberances, than Excrements: And knots, or knobs, are nothing but Diseases. But the substance of Living Creatures is more perceptible, of the like; And therefore it is conjoyned with a kinde of Disdaine; whereby it rejecteth the Bad, and assimilateth the Good.
               8 It is a strange Thing, of the Stalkes of Fruits; That all the Nourishment, which produceth, sometimes, such great Fruits, should bee forced to passe thorow so narrow Necks: For the Fruit is never joyn'd to the Stock, without some stalke.
               9 It is to be noted; That the Seeds of Living Creatures, will not be fruitfull, but when

they are new shed; But the Seeds of Plants, will be fruit, full, a long time, after they are gathered. Yet the Slips, or Cions of Trees, will not grow, unlesse they be grafted green; Neither will the 
                     〈◊〉
                   keepe long Fresh, unlesse they be covered with earth.
               10 In Living Creatures, there are Degrees of Nourishment according to their Age: In the Wombe, the young one is nourished with the Mothers Bloud; when it is new borne, with Milke; Afterward, with Meats, and Drinks; And in old Age, the most Nourishing, and Savourie Meats, please best.
               11 Above all, it maketh to the present Inquisition; To inquire diligently, and Attentively; whether a Man may not receive

                  Nourishment from without; At least some other way, beside the Mouth? Wee know, that Baths of Milke are used in some Hectick Fevers, and when the Body is brought extreme low; And physitians doe prescribe Nourishing Clysters: This Matter would be well studied; For if Nourishment may be made, either from without, or some other way, than by the Stomach, Then the weaknesse of Concoction, which is incident to old Men, might be recompenced by these Helps; And Concoction restored to them, intire.
            
         
         
            
            Length and Shortnesse of Life in Man.
            
               The Historie.
               1 BEfore the Floud, as the To the 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Article. 
                  Sacred Scriptures relate, Men lived many Hundred yeares: Yet none of the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   attained to a full Thousand. Neither was this Length of Life, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   only to Grace, or the Holy 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   For there are reckoned, of the Fathers, untill the Floud, eleven Generations; But of the Sons of Adam, by Cain, only eight Generations; So as the Posteritie of Cain may seeme the longer liv'd. But this Length of Life, immediately after the

                  Floud, was reduced to a Moitie; But in the Post-Nati: For Noah, who was borne before, equalled the Age of his, Ancestours; And Sem saw the sixth hundred year of his life. Afterward, three Generations being run, from the Floud; The Life of Man was brought downe, to a Fourth Part of the Primitive Age; That was, to about two Hundred years.
               2 Abraham lived an hundred seventie and five yeares: A Man of an High Courage, and prosperous in all Things. Isaac came to an Hundred and eightie yeares of Age; A chaste Man, and enjoying more Quietnesse, than his Father. But Iacob, after many Crosses, and a numerous Progenie, lasted to the Hundred fortie seventh yeare of his

Life: A Patient, Gentle, and wise Man. Ishmael, a Militar Man, lived an Hundred thirtie and seven yeares. Sarah, (whose yeares only, amongst women, are recorded,) died in the Hundred twentie seventh yeare of her Age: A Beautifull, and Magnanimous Woman; A singular good Mother, and Wife; And yet, no lesse Famous, for her Libertie, than Obsequiousnesse towards her Husband. Ioseph also, a Prudent, and Politicke Man, Passing his youth in Affliction, afterwards advanced to the Height of Honour and Prosperitie, lived an hundred and ten yeares. But his Brother Levi, elder than himselfe, attained to an Hundred thirty seven yeares; A Man Impatient of Contumely, and Revengefull.

Neare unto the same Age, attained the Sonne of Levi: Also his Grand Child; The Father of Aaron, and Moses.
               
               3 Moses lived an Hundred and Twenty years: A Stout Man, and yet the Meekest upon the Earth; And of a very Slow Tongue. Howsoever Moses, in his Psalme, pronounceth; That the life of Man is but seventie yeares; And if a Man have Strength, then eighty; Which Terme of Mans Life standeth firme, in many particulars, even at this Day. Aaron, who was three yeares the Elder, died the same yeare, with his Brother: A Man of a readier Speech, of a more facile Disposition, and lesse Constant. But Phineas, Grand-child of Aaron, (perhaps, out of extraordinary

Grace,) may be collected, to have lived three hundred yeares; If so be, the War of the Israelites, against the Tribe of Benjamin; (In which Expedition, Phineas was consulted with,) were performed, in the same order of Time, in which the Historie hath ranked it: He was a Man of a most Eminent Zeale. Ioshua, a Martiall Man, and an excellent Leader, and evermore victorious, lived to the Hundred and Tenth yeare of his Life. Caleb was his Contemporany; And seemeth to have beene of as great yeares. Ehud the Judge, seemes to have beene no lesse than an hundred years old; In regard, that after the Victory over the Moabites, the Holy Land had rest, under his Government,

eightie yeares: He was a Man Fierce, and undaunted; And one, that in a sort, neglected his Life for the good of his People.
               4 Iob lived, after the Restauration of his Happinesse, an Hundred and Fortie yeares; Being, before his Afflictions, of that Age, that he had sons at Mans Estate: A Man Politick, Eloquent, Charitable, and the Example of Patience. Eli the Priest, lived Ninetie eight yeares; A corpulent Man, Calme of disposition, and Indulgent to his children. But Elizeus the Prophet, may seeme to have died, when he was above an hundred yeares old; For he is found to have lived after the Assumption of Elias, sixty yeares; And at the Time of that Assumption,
                  
he was of those yeares, that the Boyes mocked him, by Name of Bald-head; A Man vehement, and severe, and of an Austere life, and a Contemner of Riches. Also, Isaiah the Prophet, seemeth to have beene an Hundred years old: For he is found, to have exercised the Function of a Prophet, Seventie yeares together; The yeares, both of his Beginning to Prophecie, and of his Death, being uncertain: A Man of an Admirable Eloquence; An Evangelicall Prophet; Full of the Promises of God, of the New Testament, as a Bottle with sweet Wine.
               5 Tobias the Elder, lived an Hundred fifty eight yeares; The younger, an Hundred twenty seven; Mercifull Men,

and great Almes-Givers. It seemes, in the time of the Captivitie, many of the Iewes, who returned out of Babylon, were of great yeares: Seeing they could remember both Temples, (there being no lesse than seventie yeares betwixt Them;) And wept for the unlikenesse of Them. Many Ages after that, in the Time of our Saviour, lived old Simeon, to the Age of Ninetie yeares: A Devout Man, and full, both of Hope, and Expectation. Into the same time also, fell Anna the Prophetesse; who could not possibly bee lesse than an Hundred yeares old: For shee had been seven yeares a Wife; About eighty foure yeares a Widow; Beside the yeares of her Virginitie; And the time that she

lived after her Prophecie of our Saviour. Shee was an Holy Woman; And passed her dayes in fastings and Prayers.
               6 The Long Lives of Men, mentioned in Heathen Authors, have no great certaintie in Them: Both for the Intermixture of Fables, whereunto those kind of Relations were very prone; and for their false Calculation of yeares. Certainly, of the AEgyptians, we finde nothing of Moment in those workes that are extant, as touching Long Life; For their Kings, which reigned longest, did not exceed fifty, or five and fiftie yeares, which is no great matter; Seeing Many at this Day, attaine to those yeares. But the Arcadian Kings, are fabulously

reported to have lived very long. Surely, that Country was Mountainous, Full of Flocks of Sheep, and brought forth most wholesome Food. Notwithstanding, seeing Pan was their God, wee may conceive, that all Things about them were Panick, and vaine, and subject to Fables.
               7 Numa, King of the Romans, lived to eightie yeares; A Man peaceable, Contemplative, and much devoted to Religion. Marcus Valerius Corvinus, saw an hundred yeares compleat; There being betwixt his First and Sixth Consulship, Forty six yeares; A Man Valourous, Affable, Popular, and alwayes Fortunate.
               8 Solon of Athens, the Lawgiver, and one of the seven Wise Men, lived above eighty

yeares; A Man of an High Courage, but Popular, and affected to his Country: Also Learned, given to Pleasures, and a soft kind of Life. Epimenides the Cretian, is reported to have lived an hundred fifty seven yeares: The Matter is mixt with a Prodigious Relation; For fifty seven of those yeares, he is said to have slept in a Cave. Halfe an Age after, Xenophanes the Colophonian, lived an hundred &amp; two yeares, or rather more; For at the Age of Twenty five yeares, he left his Country; Seventy seven compleat yeares he travelled; And after that returned: But how long hee lived after his Returne, appeares not: A Man, no lesse wandring in Mind, than in Body; For his Name was changed,

for the Madnesse of his Opinions, from Xenophanes to 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   A Man, no doubt, of a vast Conceit, and that minded nothing but Infinitum.
               
               9 Anacreon, the Poet, lived eighty yeares, and somewhat better: A Man Lascivious, Voluptuous, and given to Drinke. Pindarus, the Theban, lived to eighty yeares; A Poet of an high Fancie, singular in his Conceits, and a great Adorer of the Gods. Sophocles the Athenian, attained to the like Age; A lofty Tragicke Poet, given over wholly to Writing, and Neglectfull of his Family.
               10 Artaxerxes, King of Persia, lived ninety foure yeares: A Man of a Dull wit, Averse to the Dispatch of Businesse,

Desirous of Glory, but rather of Ease. At the same time lived Agesilaus, King of Sparta, to eighty foure yeares of Age: A Moderate Prince; As being a Philosopher amongst Kings; But not withstanding Ambitious, and a Warrier; And no lesse stout in Warre, than in Businesse.
               11 Gorgias, the Sicilian, was an hundred and eight yeares old; A Rhetorician, and a great 
                     〈◊〉
                   of his Faculty; One that taught Youth for profit, Hee had seene many Countries; And a little before his Death said, That hee had done nothing worthy of Blame, since he was an old Man. Protagoras of Abdera, saw Ninetie yeares of Age, This Man was likewise a Rhetorician; But professed not so much to teach

the Liberall Arts, as the Art of Governing Commonwealths, and States: Notwithstanding, he was a great Wanderer in the World, no lesse than Gorgias. Isocrates, the Athenian, lived Ninety eight yeares: He was a Rhetorician also, but an exceeding modest Man, One that shunned the publike Light; And opened his Schoole only in his owne House. Democritus of Abdera, reached to an hundred and nine yeares: Hee was a great Philosopher; And, if ever any Man amongst the Grecians, a true Naturalist: A Surveyour of many Countries, but much more of Nature; Also a diligent searcher into Experiments; And, (as Aristotle objected against him,) One that followed Similitudes, more

than the Laws of Arguments. Diogenes the Sinopean, lived ninety yeares: A Man, that used Liberty towards Others, but Tyranny over Himselfe; Of a course Diet, and of much Patience. Zeno of Citium, lacked but two yeares of an hundred: A Man of an High Minde, and a Contemner of other Mens Opinions; Also of a great Acutenesse, but yet not Troublesome, choosing rather to take Mens Mindes, than to enforce them: The like whereof afterward was in Seneca. Plato the Athenian, atrained to eighty one yeares: A Man of a great Courage, but yet a Lover of 
                     〈◊〉
                   In his Notions Sublimed, and full of Fancie: Neat and D I cate in his Life; Rather Calme, than Merry; And one, that

carried a kinde of Majestie in his Countenance. Theophrastus the Etesian, larrived at eightie five yeares of Age; A Man sweet for his Eloquence; Sweet also for the Varietie of his Matters; And who selected the pleasant Things of Philosophy; And let the Bitter and Harsh goe. Carneades of Cyrene, many yeares after, came to the like Age, of eightie five yeares: A Man of a fluent Eloquence; And one, who by the acceptable, and pleasant Varietie of his Knowledge, delighted, both himselfe, and others. But 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   who lived in Cicero's time; No Philosopher, or Rhetorician; But a Grammarian; Attained to an hundred yeares of Age: He was first a Souldier, then a Schoole-master;

A Man by nature tart, both in his Tongue, and Pen; And severe towards his Schollers.
               12 Quintus Fabius Maximus, was Augur sixty three yeares; which shewed him to bee above eighty yeares of Age, at his Death: Though it bee true, that in the Augurship, Nebilitie was more respected, than Age. A wise Man, and a great Deliberatour, and in all his proceedings Moderate, and not without Affabilitie severe. Masinissa, King of Numidia, lived ninetie yeares; And being more than eightie five, got a Sonne: A Daring Man, and trusting upon his Fortune; who in his youth, had tasted of the Inconstancie of Fortune; But in his succeeding Age, was constantly

Happy. But Marcus Porcius Cato, lived above ninetie yeares of Age: A man of an Iron Body and Minde; Hee had a bitter Tongue, and loved to cherish factions: Hee was given to Husbandry; And was to Himselfe, and his Family, a Physician.
               13 Terentia, Cicero's wife, lived an hundred and three yeares: A woman afflicted with many Crosses; First, with the Banishment of her Husband; Then with the Difference betwixt them; Lastly, with his last Fatall Misfortune: Shee was also oftentimes vexed with the Gout. Luceia must needs exceed an hundred, by many yeares; For it is said, That shee acted, an whole hundred yeares, upon the stage; At first, perhaps,

representing the person of some young Girle; At last, of some Decrepit old Woman. But Galeria Copiola, A Player also, and a Dancer, was brought upon the Stage as a Novice, in what yeare of her Age, is not knowne; But ninetie nine yeares after, at the Dedication of the Theater, by Pompey the Great, shee was shewne upon the Stage againe; Not now for an Actresse, but for a Wonder; Neither was this all; For after that, in the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , for the Health and Life of Augustus, she was shewne upon the Stage the third time.
               14 There was another Actresse, somewhat Inferiour in Age, but much Superiour in Dignity, which lived well-neare ninety yeares: I meane Livia lulia Augusta, wife to Augustus
                  
                  Cesar, and Mother to Tiberius. For if Augustus his Life were a play; (As himselfe would have it; when as upon his Death-bed, hee charged his Frineds, they should give him a Plaudite, after hee was Dead,) certainly this Lady was an excellent Actresse; who could carry it so well with her Husband, by a dissembled Obedience; And with her Sonne, by power and authoritie: A woman Affable, and yet of a Matronall Carriage, Pragmaticall, and upholding her power. But Iunia, the wife of Caius Cassius, and sister of Marcus Brutus, was also ninetie yeares old; For shee survived the Philippick Battaile, sixty foure yeares: A Magnanimous woman; In her great wealth Happy; In

the Calamity of her Husband, and neare Kinsfolkes, and in long widowhood, unhappy; Notwithstanding much Honoured of all.
               15 The yeare of our Lord seventie six, falling into the Time of Vespasian, is Memorable; In which wee shall finde, as it were, a Calender, of long liv'd Men: For that yeare, there was a Taxing; (Now a Taxing, is the most Authenticall, and truest Informer, touching the ages of men;) And in that part of Italie, which lieth betwixt the Apennine Mountaines, and the River Po, there were found, an hundred and foure and twenty persons, that either equalled, or exceeded, an hundred yeares of Age: Namely, of an hundred yeares just, fiftie foure persons;

Of an hundred and ten, fiftie seven persons; Of an hundred and five and twenty, Two onely; Of an hundred and thirty, foure men; Of an hundred and five and thirtie, or seven and thirtie, foure more; Of an hundred and fortie, three men. Besides these, Parma in particular, afforded five, whereof three fulfilled an hundred &amp; twentie yeares; and two, an hundred and thirty: Bruxels afforded one, of an hundred and twentie five yeares old: Placentia one, aged an hundred thirty and one: Faventia, one Woman, aged one hundred thirtie and two: A certaine Towne, then called Velleiacium, scituate in the Hils, about Placentia, afforded ten; whereof Six fulfilled an hundred

and ten yeares of age; Foure, an hundred and twentie: Lastly, Rimino one, of an hundred and fiftie yeares; whose Name was Marcus Aponius.
               
               That our Catalogue might not be extended too much in length, wee have thought fit, as well in those whom we have rehearsed, as in those whom we shall rehearse, to offer none under eighty yeares of Age. Now wee have affixed to every one a true and short Character, or Elogie; But of that sort, whereunto, in our Iudgement, Length of Life, (which is not a little subject to the Manners and Fortunes of Men,) hath some Relation: And that in a twofold Respect: Either that such Kinde of Men, are for the most part long liv'd; Or that such Men may sometimes bee of long

Life, though otherwise not well disposed for it.
               16 Amongst the Roman and Grecian Emperours; Also the French and Almaine; To these our Dayes; which make up the Number of well-neare two hundred Princes; There are only foure found, that lived to eightie yeares of Age: unto whom we may adde the two first Emperours; Augustus, and Tiberius; whereof the latter fulfilled the seventie and eighth yeare, the former the seventie and sixth yeare of his Age; And might both perhaps have lived to fourescore, if Livia and Caius had been pleased. Augustus (as was said) lived seventie and six yeares: A Man of a Moderate Disposition; In accomplishing his Designes, vehement,

but otherwise Calme, and Serene; In Meat and Drink sober; In Venerie Intemperate; Through all his Life time Happy: And who about the thirtieth year of his Life, had a great and dangerous sicknesse; Insomuch that they despaired of Life in him; whom Antonius Musa the Physician, when other Physicians had applied Hot Medicines, as most agreeable to his Disease, on the contrarie cured with cold Medicines; which perchance might bee some Help, to the prolonging of his Life. Tiberius lived to bee two yeares older: A Man with Leane chaps; As Augustus was wont to say; For his speech stuck within his Jawes, but was weightie, Hee was Bloudy, a Drinker,

and one that tooke lust into a Part of his Diet: Notwithstanding, a great Observer of his Health; Insomuch, that hee used to say; That hee was a Foole, that after thirtie yeares of Age, tooke advice of a Physician. Gordian the Elder, lived eightie yeares; And yet died a violent Death, when he was scarce warme in his Empire: A Man of an High Spirit, and Renowmed; Learned, and a Poet; And constantly happy, throughout the whole course of his Life, save only, that he ended his dayes by a violent Death. Valerian the Emperour, was seventie six yeares of Age, before hee was taken Prisoner, by Sapor King of Persia: After his Captivitie hee lived seven yeares in Reproches; And then died a

violent Death also: A Man of a poore Minde, and not valiant; Notwithstanding lifted up in his owne, and the opinion of Men, but falling short in the performance. Anastasius, surnamed Dicorus, lived eightie eight yeares: He was of a setled Minde, but too abject, and superstitious, and fearefull. Anicius Iustinianus, lived to eightie three yeares: A Man Greedy of Glorie; Performing Nothing in his owne Person, but in the valour of his Captaines Happie and Renowmed; Uxorious: And not his owne Man, but suffering others to lead him. Helena of Britaine, Mother of Constantine the Great, was four-score yeares old: A Woman, that intermedled not in Matters of State, neither in

her Husbands, nor Sonnes 
                     〈◊〉
                  ; But Devoted her 
                     〈◊〉
                   wholly to Religion, Magnanimous, and 
                     〈◊〉
                   Flourishing. Theodora the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; (who was Sister to 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , wife of Monomachus; And reigned alone after her Decease;) lived above eightie yeares: A Pragmaticall Woman; and one that tooke 
                     〈◊〉
                   in Governing; Fortunate in the Highest degree, and through her good 
                     〈◊〉
                   Credulous.
               17 We will proceed now from these Secular Princes, to the Princes in the Church. S. Iohn, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   Apostle of our Saviour, and the Beloved Disciple, lived ninetie three yeares: He was rightly denoted under the

Simeon the Sonne of Cleophas, called the Brother of our Lord, and Bishop of His rusalem, lived an hundred and twenty yeares; Though he was cut short by

                   dome; A Stout Man, and Constant, and full of Good works. Polycarpus, Disciple

                   Contemporany to the Apostle S. Paul, lived ninetie cares: Hee was called The 
                        〈◊〉
                      of Heaven, for his High lying Divinitie; And was famous, as well for his Holy Life, as for his Meditations. Aquila and Priscilla, first Saint Paul the Apostles Hosts; Afterward his Fellow-Hel-bers; lived together, in an happy and famous wedlock, at least, to an hundred yeares of Age, a peece: For they were both alive, under Pope 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   the First: A Noble paire, and prone to all kinde of Charitie; who amongst other their Comforts; (which no doubt were great, unto the first Founders of the Church;)

Had this added; To enjoy each other so long, in an 
                     〈◊〉
                   marriage. Saint Paul, the Hermite, lived an hundred and thirteen yeares: Now hee 
                     〈◊〉
                   in a Cave; His Diet was so slender and strict, that was thought almost Impossble, to support Humane Nature therewithall: He

                   the first Founder of Monks, or (as some will have it,) the Restorer onely; 
                     〈◊〉
                   to an hundred and five yeares of Age: A Man Devout, and Contemplative Though not unfit for Civil Affaires; His Life was Austere, and Mortifying; Notwithstanding hee lived in

kinde of glorious solitude; and exercised a Command; or he had his Monks under 
                     〈◊〉
                  ; And besides, many

                   fourscore yeares, or upward But in many of the first

                   of Martyrdome. Iohn the

                   Disposition, and one that 
                     〈◊〉
                   died Noveltie; Hee

                   many Things, some to the

Better, others onely to the New; A great 
                     〈◊〉
                   of Riches and Treasure. Gregorie, called the twelfth, created in schisme, and not fully acknowledged Pope; Died at ninetie yeares; Of him, in respect of his short Papacie, wee 
                     〈◊〉
                   Nothing, to make a judgement upon. Paul the third, lived eightie yeares and one: A temperate Man, and of a profound wisdome; He was Learned, an Astrologer; and one that tended his Health carefully; But after the Example of old Eli the Priest, over-Indulgent to his Family. Paul the fourth, attained to the Age of eightie three yeares: A Man of an Harsh Nature, and severe; Of an Haughtie Minde, and Imperious; prone to Anger; his

speech was Eloquent, and Ready. Gregorie the thirteenth, fulfilled the like Age, of eightie three yeares: An absolute good Man; Sound in Minde, and Body; Politick, Temperate, full of good workes, and an Almes-giver.
               19 Those that follow are to be more Promiscuous in their order; More doubtfull in their faith; And more barren of Observation. King Arganthonius, who reigned at Cadiz in Spaine, lived an hundred and thirtie; Or, (as some would have it,) an hundred and forty yeares; Of which he reigned eightie. Concerning his Manners, Institution of his Life, and the Time wherein hee reigned, there is a generall Silence. Cyniras, King of Cyprus, Living

in the Island, then termed the Happie and Pleasant island, is affirmed, to have attained to an hundred and fifty, or sixty yeares. Two Latine Kings in Italy, the Father and the Son, are reported to have lived, the one eight hundred, the other six hundred yeares: But this is delivered unto us by certain Philologists; Who though otherwise Credulous enough; yet themselves have suspected the Truth of this Matter, or rather condemned it. Others record some Arcadian Kings to have lived three hundred years: The Country, no doubt, is a place apt for long life; But the Relation I suspect to be Fabulous. They tell of one Dando, in Illyrium; That lived, without the Inconveniences of old Age, to five hundred

yeares. They tell also 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Epians, a Part of AEtolia That the whole Nation 
                     〈◊〉
                   them were exceeding long liv'd; In so much, that many of them were two hundred yeares old: And that one principal Man amongst them, named Litorius, a Man of 
                     〈◊〉
                   Giant-like Stature, could have told three hundred yeares. It is recorded, that in the Top of the Mountaine

                   anciently called Tempsis, many of the Inhabitants lived to 
                     〈◊〉
                   hundred and fiftie yeares. We reade that the Sect of the Esseans, amongst the Iewes, did usually extend their Life to an hundred yeares: Now that Sect, used a single, or Abstemious Diet; After the Rule of Pythagoras. Apollonius 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   exceeded an hundred yeares;

His Face bewraying no such Age; Hee was an Admirable Man; Of the Heathens reputed to have something Divine in him; Of the Christians, held for a Sorcerer: In his Diet Pythagoricall, A great Traveller; Much Renowmed; And by some adored as a God: Notwithstanding, towards the end of his life, he was subject to many Complaints against him, and Reproaches; All which he made shift to escape. But lest his Long Life should be imputed to his Pythagoricall Diet, and not rather that it was Hereditary, his Grandfather before him, lived an hundred and thirty yeares. It is undoubted, that Quintus Metellus lived above an hundred yeares; And that after severall Consalships happily administred;

In his old Age he was made Pontifex Maximus; And exercised those Holy Duties, full two and twentie yeares; In the performance of which Rites, his Voice never failed, nor his Hand trembled. It is most certaine, that 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Caesus was very old, but his yeares are not extant; The most part whereof he passed, after he was Blinde: Yet this Misfortune no whit softened him, but that hee was able to governe a numerous Family, a great Retinue and Dependance, yea, even the Common-wealth it selfe with great Stoutnesse. In his extreme old Age, he was brought in a Litter into the Senate-House; And vehemently disswaded the Peace with Pyrrhus: The Beginning of his Oration was

very Memorable, shewing an Invincible Spirit, and strength of Minde; I have, with great Griefe of Minde, (Fathers Consript,) these many yeares, borne my Blindnesse; But now I could wish, that I were Deafe also; when I heare you speake to such Dishonourable Treaties. Marcus Perpenna lived ninety eight yeares; Surviving all those, whose Suffrages he had gathered, in the Senate House, being Consul; I meane, all the Senators at that time. As also all those, whom a little after, being Censour, hee chose into the Senate; Seven only being excepted. Hiero, King of Sicely, in the time of the second Punick Warre, Lived almost an hundred yeares; A Man Moderate, both in his Government, and in his Life; A

Worshipper of the Gods, and a Religions Conserver

                   Friendship; Liberall, and constantly Fortunate. Statilia, descended of a Noble Family, in the Dayes of

Xenophilus, an Ancient Philosopher, of the Sect of Pythagoras. attained to an hundred and six yeares: Remaining Healthfull, and vigorous in his old Age; And Famous amongst the Vulgar, for his Learning. The Islanders of Corcyra were Ancienely accounted Long liv'd; But now they live after the rate of other Men. Hippocrates Côus, the Famous Physician, lived an hundred and foure yeares; And approved and credited his own Art, by

so long a life: A Man, that coupled learning and wisdom together; Very conversant in Experience and Observation; One that hunted not after Words, or Methods; But severed the very Nerves of Science, and so propounded them. Demonax, a Philosopher, not only in Profession, but Practice, lived in the Daies of Adrian, almost to an Hundred yeares: A Man of an High Minde, and a Vanquisher of his owne Mind; And that, truly, and without Affectation, A Contemner of the World, and yet Civill and courteous: when his Friends spake to him, about his Buriall, he said; Take no Care for my Buriall; For Stench will bury a Carleaise: They replyed; Is it your Minde then, to be cast out,
                  
                  to Birds, and Dogs? He said againe, Seeing, in my life time, I endevoured to my uttermost, to benefit Men, what hurt is it, if, when I am dead, I benefit

                   Certain Indian People, called Pandorae, are exceedingly long Liv'd; Even to no lesse than Two Hundred yeares. They adde a Thing more Marvellous; That having, when they are Boyes, an Haire, somewhat whitish; In their old Age, before their gray haires, they grow coale blacke: Though indeed this be every where to be seene; That they which have white 
                     〈◊〉
                   whilest they are Boyes, in their Mans estate, change their Haires into a Darker colour. The Seres, another People of India, with their Wine of Palmes, are accounted Long

Livers; Even to an hundred and thirtie yeares. Euphranor, the Grammarian, grew old in his Schoole; And taught Schollers, when he was above an hundred yeares old. The Elder Ovid, father to the Poet, lived Ninety yeares: Differing much from the disposition of his Son; For hee contemned the Muses, and disswaded his Son from Poetry. Asinius Pollio, intimate with Augustus, exceeded the Age of an Hundred years: A Man of an unreasonable Profusenesse, Eloquent, a Lover of Learning; But Vehement, Proud, Cruell; And one that made his Private Ends the Center of his Thoughts. There was an Opinion, that Seneca was an extreme Old Man; No lesse than an Hundred

                   the Affaires of State: Besides, a little before, in the Midst of Claudius his Reigne, hee was banished Rome,

                   Adulteries committed with some Noble Ladies; which was a Crime, no wayes competible with so extreme old Age. Ioannes de Temporibus, amongst all the Men of our latter Ages, out of a common Fame, and vulgar Opinion, was reputed Long-liv'd, even to a Miracle; Or rather, even to a Fable; His Age hath been. counted, above three Hundred

yeares: He was by Nation a French Man; And followed the Warres, under Charles the Great. Gartius Aretine, Great Grand-Father to Petrarch, arrived at the Age of an Hundred and foure yeares. He had ever enjoyed the Benefit of good Health; Besides, at the last, He felt rather a Decay of his strength, than any Sicknesse or Maladie; which is the true Resolution, by old Age. Amongst the Venetians, there have been found, not a few long Livers; and those of the more eminent sort: Franciscus Donatus, Duke; Thomas Contarenus, Procuratour of Saint Marke; Franciscus Molinus, Procuratour also of Saint Mark; Others. But most Memorable is that of Cornarus the Venetian;
                  
who being in his youth of a sickly Body, began first to eat and drink by measure, to a certaine weight; Thereby to recover his Health; This Cure, turned, by use, into a Diet; That Diet to an extraordinary Long Life; Even of an Hundred years and better, without any Decay in his Senses; And with a constant Enjoying of his Health. In our Age, William Postell, a French-Man, lived to an hundred, and well nigh twenty yeares; The Top of his Beard, on the upper Lip, being black, and not Gray at all: A Man crazed in his Braine, and of a Fancie not altogether Sound; A great Traveller, Mathematician, and somewhat stained with Heresie.
               
               20 I suppose there is scarce a

                  Village, with us in England, if it be any whit populous, but it affords some Man or Woman of Fourescore yeares of Age: Nay, a few yeares since, there was in the Countie of Hereford, a Maygame, or MorrisDance, consisting of Eight Men, whose Age computed together, made up eight hundred yeares; In so much, that what some of them wanted of an hundred, others exceeded as much.
               21 In the Hospitall of Bethleem, corruptly called Bedlam, in the Suburbs of London, there are found, from time to time, many Mad Persons, that live to a great Age.
               22 The Ages of Nymphs, Fawns and Satyres, whom they make to be, indeed, Mortall, but yet exceedingly Long-Liv'd; (A

Thing, which Ancient Superstition, and the Late Credulitie of some, have admitted;) we account but for Fables and Dreames: Especially, being that, which hath neither Consent with Philosophie, nor with Divinity. And as touching the Historie of Long-Life in Man, by Individuals, or next unto Individuals, thus much: Now we will passe on to Observations, by certaine Heads.
               23 The Running on of Ages, and Succession of Generations, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   to have no whit abated from the Length of Life; For wee see, that from the Time of Moses, unto these our Dayes, the Terme of Mans life hath stood about Fourescore years of Age; Neither hath it declined, (As a man would have

thought) by little and little. No doubt, there are Times, in every Country, wherein Men are longer, or shorter liv'd. Longer, for the most part, when the times are barbarous, and Men fare lesse deliciously, and are more given to Bodily Exercises: Shorter, when the Times are more Civill, and Men abandon themselves to Luxury and Ease. But these Things passe on by their Turnes; The Succession of Generations alters it not. The same, no doubt, is in other living Creatures; For neither Oxen, nor Horses, nor Sheep, nor any the like, are abridged of their wonted Ages at this Day. And therefore, the Great Abridger of Age was the Floud: And perhaps, some such Notable Accidents; (As

particular Inundations, Long Droughts, Earth-quakes, Or the like,) may doe the same again And the like Reason is, in the Dimension and Stature of Bodies; For neither are they lessened, by succession of Generations; Howsoever Virgil, (following the vulgar Opinion,) Divined, that After-Ages would bring forth lesser Bodies, than the then present; whereupon speaking of Plowing up the Emathian and Emonensian Fields, He saith; Grandia

Things to a Rule, how farre they may concerne Long Life,

                   hard: And so much the Harder, for that those Things, which a Man would conceive to be the best, will fall out to the contrary: For that Alacrity in the Generation, which begets lusty and Lively Children, will bee lesse Profitable to long Life, because of the Acrimony, and Inflaming of the Spirits. We said before; That to partake more of the Mothers Bloud, conduceth to long Life. Also, we suppose all Things in Moderation, to bee best; Rather Conjugall Love, than Meretricious; The Houre for Generation to be the Morning; A state of Bodie, not too Lusty, or Full; And such like. It ought also to be well observed; That a

strong Constitution in the Parents, is rather good for them, than for the Childe; Especially in the Mother. And therefore Plato thought ignorantly enongh; 
                     〈◊〉
                   the vertue of Generation halted, because the women used not the same Exercises, both of Minde are Body, with the Men: The contrarie is rather true. For the Difference of 
                     〈◊〉
                   betwixt the Male, and the 
                     〈◊〉
                   male, is most profitable for the Childe; And the

                   women, yeeld more to wards the Nourishment

                      women, which

                   not before twentie two, 
                     〈◊〉
                   as some say, twenty five (And therefore were 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
                  Man-like women;) Bring forth a more Generous, or Long-liv'd Progenie; Than the Roman, or Athenian, or Theban women did, which were ripe for Marriage, at twelve, or fourteene yeares. And if there were any Thing eminent in the Spartans; That was rather to bee imputed, to the Parcimony of their Diet, than to the late Marriages of their women. But this we are taught by experience; That there are some Races, which are long liv'd, for a few Descents; So that Long Life, is like some Diseases, a Thing Hereditarie, within certaine Bounds.
               33 Faire in Face, or Skin, or Hoire, are shorter Livers; Black, or Red, or Freckled, longer.

Also too Fresh a Colour in youth, doth lesse promise long Life, than Palenesse. A hard Skin, is a signe of long Life, rather than a Soft: But wee understand not this of a Rugged Skin, such as they call a Goose Skin, which is, as it were, Spongie, but of that which is Hard, and Close. A Forehead with deep Furrowes and Wrinkles, is a better Signe, than a smooth and plaine Forehead.
               34 The Haires of the Head hard, and like Bristles, doe betoken longer Life, than those that are soft, and Delicate. Curled Haires betoken the same Thing, if they bee Hard withall; But the Contrarie, if they bee Soft and Shining. The like, it the curling bee rather thick,

than in large Bunches.
               35 Early, or Late, Baldnesse, is an Indifferent Thing; Seeing many which have beene Bold betimes, have lived long. Also early Gray Haires, (Howsoever they may seeme Forerunners of Old Age approching,) are no sure Signes; For many that have growne gray betimes, have lived to great yeares. Nay, Hasty Gray Haires, without Baldnesse, is a Token of long Life; contrarily, if they bee accompanied with Baldnesse.
               
               36 Hairinesse of the upper Parts, is a Signe of Short life; And they that have extraord narie much Haire on their Breasts, live not long: But Hairinesse of the Lower Parts, as of the Thighes, and Legs, is a Signe of long Life.
               
                  37 Talnesse of Stature, (if it be not Immoderate,) with a convenient Making, and not too slender; Especially if the Body bee Active withall; Is a signe of long Life. Also on the contrarie, Men of low stature live long, if they be not too Active, and stirring.
               38 In the proportion of the Body; They which are short to the Wastes, with long Legs, Are longer liv'd than 
                     〈◊〉
                  , which are long to the Wastes, and have short Legs: Also they which are large in the Neather parts, and streight in the upper; (The Making of their Body, rising, as it were into a sharp Figure;) Are longer liv'd than they, that have broad Shoulders, and are slender down-wards.
               39 Leannesse, where the Affections

are setled, calme, and peaceable; Also a more Fat Habit of Body, joyned with Choler, and a Disposition stirring, and peremptorie, signifie long Life. But Corpulencie in youth, fore-shewes short Life; In Age, it is a Thing more Indifferent.
               40 To bee Long, and Slow, in Growing, is a signe of long Life; If to a Greater Stature, the Greater Signe; If to a lesser Stature, yet a signe though: contrarily, to grow quickly, to a great Stature, is an evill Signe; If to a small Stature, the lesse evill.
               41 Firme Flesh; A Raw-boned Body; And veines lying higher than the Flesh; Betoken long Life: The contrarie to these, short Life.
               42 A Head some what

                   strong, and contiguous, not small, or thin-set; Foretoken long Life: And much more, if some new Teeth put 
                     〈◊〉
                   our elder yeares.
               43 A broad brest, yet not Bearing out, but rather Bending Inwards; shoulders somewhat crooked, and (as they call such persons) Round-Back'd; A 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Belly; A Hand large, and with few Lines in the Palme: A short, and round Foot; Thighes not Fleshy; And Calves of the Leg not hanging over, but neat; Are signes of long Life.
               
                  44 Eyes somewhat large, and the Circle of them inclined to Greennesse; Senses not too quick; The pulse in youth slower, towards old Age quicker; Facilitie of Holding the Breath, and longer than usuall; The Body in youth inclined to bee bound, in the Decline of yeares more Laxative; Are also Signes of long Life.
               45 Concerning the Times of Nativitie, as they referre to long Life, nothing hath beene observed worthy the setting downe; save onely Astrologicall Observations, which wee rejected in our Topicks. A Birth at the eighth Moneth, is not only not Long-lived, but not likely to live. Alos winterBirths are accounted the Longer liv'd.
               
                  46 A Pythagoricall, or Monast call Diet, according to 
                     〈◊〉
                   Rules, and alwayes 
                     〈◊〉
                   Equall, (As that of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   was) seemeth to be very effectuall for long Life. Yet 
                     〈◊〉
                   the contrarie, amongst those that live freely, and after the common sort, such as have good Stomacks, and feed more plentifully, are often the Longest liv'd. The Middle Diet which wee account the Temperate, is commended, and conduceth to good Health, but not to long Life; For the Spare Diet, begets few Spirits, and dull; And so wasteth the Body lesse: And the Liberall Diet, yeeldeth more ample Nourishment; And so repaireth more: But the Middle Diet doth neither of both: for where the Extremes are

Hurtfull, there the Meane is best; But where the Extremes are Helpfull, there the Meane is Nothing worth. Now to that Spare Diet, there are Requisite, Watching, lest the Spirits being Few, should bee oppressed with much sleep; Little Exercise, lest they should Exhale; Abstinence from Venerie, lest they should bee exhausted: But to the Liberall Diet, on the other side, are Requisite, Much Sleepe, frequent Exercises, and a seasonable use of Venerie. Baths, and Annointings, (such as were anciently in use,) did rather tend to Deliciousnesse, than to prolonging of Life. But of all these Things, wee shall speak more exactly, when we come to the Inquisition, according to Intentions. Meane while,

that of Celsus, who was not only a Learned Physician, but a wise Man, is not to be omitted. Who adviseth Interchanging, and Alternation of the Diet, but still with an Inclination to the more Benigne: As that a Man should sometimes accustome himselfe to watching, sometimes to sleepe; But to sleepe 
                     〈◊〉
                   Againe, that hee should sometimes give himselfe to Fasting, sometimes to Feasting; But to Feasting oftenest: That hee should sometimes inure himselfe to great Labours of the Minde, sometimes to Relaxations of the same, But to Relaxations oftnest. Certainly, this is without all question; That Diet well ordred beares the greatest part in the Prolongation

of Life; Neither did I ever meet, an extreme longlived Man; But being asked of his course, hee observed something peculiar; Some one Thing, some another. I remember an old Man, above an hundred yeares of Age, who was produced as a witnesse, touching an Ancient Prescription; when hee had finished his Testimonie, the Iudge familiarly asked him, How he came to live so long; He answered, beside Expectation, and not without the Laughter of the Hearers; By Eating before I was Hungrie, and Drinking before I was Drie. But of these Things, wee shall speak hereafter.
               47 A Life led in Religion, and in Holy Exercises, seemeth to

conduce to long Life. There are in this kinde of Life, these Things; Leisure; Admiration and Contemplation of Heavenly Things; Joyes not sensuall; Noble Hopes; Wholesome Feares; Sweet Sorrowes; Lastly, continuall Renovations, by Observances, Pennances, Expiations; All which are very powerfull to the Prolongation of Life. Unto which if you adde that austere Diet, which 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Masse of the Body, and humbleth the spirits, no marvel, if an extraordinary length of life doe follow; Such as was that of Paul the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , Simeon Stilita the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Anchorite; And of many other Hermites, and Ancherites.
               
               48 Next unto this, is the Life

led in good letters; Such as was that of Philosophers, Rhetoricians, Grammarians. This life is led also in feisure; And in those Thoughts, which, seeing they are severed from the Affaires of the world, bite not; But rather delight through their Varietie, and Impertinencie. They live also at their pleasure; Spending their Time in such Things, as like them best; And for the most part in the company of young Men; which is ever the most cheerefull. But in Philosophies, there is great Difference betwixt the Sects, as touching long Life. For those Philosophies, which have in them a Touch of Superstition, and are conversant in High Contemplations, are the best; As the Pythagoricall,

and Platonick: Also those, which did institute a perambulation of the world; And considered the Varietit of Naturall Things; And had Retchlesse, and High, and Magnanimous Thoughts: (As of Infinitum, of the Stars, of the Heroicall Vertues, and such like;) were good for lengthening of Life; Such were those of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , Philolaus, Xenophanes, the Astrologians, and Stoicks: Also those, which had no profound speculation in them; But discoursed calmly on both sides, out of common sense, and the Received Opinions, without any shapr Inquisition; were likewise Good; Such were those of Carneades, and the Academicks; Also of the Rhetoricians, and Grammarians.

But contrarily, Philosophies conversant in perplexing subtilties; And which pronounced peremptorily; And which examined and 
                     〈◊〉
                   all Things, to the Scale of Principles; Lastly, which were Thornie, and Narrow; were Evill; Such were those commonly of the Peripateticks, and of the Schoolemen.
               49 The Countrie Life also, is well fitted for long Life: It is much abroad, and in the open Aire; It is not slothfull, but ever in Employment: It Feedeth upon Fresh Cates, and unbought; It is without Cares, and Envie.
               50 For the Militar Life, wee have a good opinion of that whilest a Man is young: Certainly, many excellent 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  
                  
                  riers have beene long liv'd Corvinus, Camillus, 
                        〈◊〉
                      Agesilaus; with others, 
                     〈◊〉
                   Ancient, and Moderne: No doubt, it furthereth long life. to have all Things from our youth, to our Elder Age, Mend and Grow to the Better; That a youth full of Crosses may minister sweetnesse to our Old Age. Wee conceive also, that 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Affections, inflamed with a Desire of Fighting, and Hope of Victorie, doe infuse such a Heat into the Spirits, as may be profitable for long Life.
            
         
         
            
            Medicines for long Life.
            THe Art of Physick, which To the 10. Article. we now have, lookes no further, commonly, than to Conservation of Health, and Cure of Diseases; As for these Things, which tend properly to long Life, there is but slight mention, and by the way onely. notwithstanding, we will propound those Medicines, which are Notable in this Kinde; I 
                  〈◊〉
                those, which are called Cordials. For it is consonant to Reason, that those Things, which being taken in Cures, doe defend and fortifie the Heart; or, more truly, the Spirits; against Poysons, and

Diseases; Being transferred with judgement and choice, 
                  〈◊〉
                
               Diet, should have a good effect in some sort towards the prolonging of Life. This wee will doe, not heaping them promiscuously together, (as the manner is,) but selecting the best.
            1 Gold is given in three Formes; Either in that, which they call Aurum potabile; Or in Wine wherein Cold hath beene quenched; Or in Gold, in the Substance; such as are Leafe Gold, and the Filings 
                     〈◊〉
                   Gold. As for Aurum 
                     〈◊〉
                  . it is used to bee given in desperate or dangerous Diseases; And that not without good successe. But wee suppose, that the Spirits of the Salt, by which the Gold is dissolved, doe rather minister that vertue, which is found in it

than the Gold it selfe: Though this Secret be wholly suppressed. Now if the Body of Gold could be opened, without these Corrosive waters; Or by these Corrosive Waters, (so the venemous Qualitie were wanting,) well washed, wee conceive, it would bee no unprofitable Medicine.
            2 Pearles are taken, either in a fine powder, or in a certaine Masse, or Dissolution, by the Juyce of sowre and new Limons: And they are given sometimes in Aromaticall Confections, sometimes in Liquour. The Pearle, no doubt, hath some affinitie, with the Shell, in which it groweth; And may be of the same qualitie, with the Shels, of CreyFishes.
            
            3 Amongst the Transparent
               
               precious Stones, two onely are accounted Cordiall; The Emeraud, and the 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  
                which are given under the same Formes, that the Pearles are; Save only, that the Dissolutions of them, as farre as wee know, are not in use. But wee suspect these Glassy Iewels, left they should be cutting.
            Of these which we have mentioned, how farre, and in what manner, they are helpfull, shall be spoken 
                  〈◊〉
               .
            4 Bezear Stone is of approved Vertue; For refreshing the Spirits, and procuring a gentle sweat. As for

                a certaine Trifler saith, are under the Planet Mars; And have a Furious, and Destructive Force;) As also all Hot, and Biting Spices; Are to be rejected: And a Consideration to bee had, how Waters and Liquours may bee made of the Former Simples; Not those Phlegmatick Distilled Waters; Nor againe those Burning Waters, of Spirit of Wine; But such as may be more temperate, and yet lively, and sending forth a Benigne Vapour.
            6 Wee make some Question, touching the Frequent Letting of Bloud, whether it conduceth to long Life or no; And wee are rather in the

Opinion, that it doth, if it be turned into an Habit, and other Things be well disposed: For it letteth out the old Juyce of the Body, and bringeth in new.
            7 We suppose also, that some Emaciating Diseases, well cured, doe profit to long Life; For they yeeld New Juyce the old being consumed; And, (as he saith,) To recover a sicknesse, is to renew youth: Therefore it were good to make some Artificiall Diseases; which is done by strict, and Emaciating Diets; Of which wee shall speak hereafter.
            
               
               The Intentions.
               HAving finished the Inqusition, 
                  To the 12, 13, and 14. Artic. according to the Subjects; As Namely, of Inanimate Bodies, Vegetables. Living Creatures, Man; Wee will now come nearer to the Matter, and order our Inquisition by certaine Intentions; Such as are true, and proper, (as wee are wholly perswaded;) And which are the very paths to Mortall Life. For in this part, Nothing that is of worth, hath 
                     〈◊〉
                   beene inquired; But the Contemplations of Men have beene, but simple, and non-proficients. For when we heare Meren the one side, speak of Comforting Naturail Heat, and the Radicall Moisture; And of Meats, which breed good Bloud;

Such as may neither be Burnt, nor Phlegmatick; And of the Cheering and Recreating of the Spirits; Wee sappose them, to be no bad Men, which speak these Things: But none of these 
                     〈◊〉
                   effectually towards the end. But when, on the other side, wee heare severall Discourses; touching Medicines made of Gold, because Gold is not subject to Corruption; And touching Precious Stones, to refresh the Spirits by their Hidden Properties, and Lustre: And that, if they could be taken, and retained in Vessels, the Balsames, and Quint-essences of Living Creatures, would make Men conceive a proud hope of Immortalitie: And that the Flesh, of Serpents, and Harts, by a certaine consent, are powerfull to the Renovation of Life; Because the

one casteth his Skin, the other by Hornes; They should also have added the Flesh of Eagles, because the Eagle changeth 
                     〈◊〉
                   Bill: And that a certaine Man. when he had found an Ointment hidden under the Ground; And had annointed himselfe there with from Head to Foot; (excepting only the Soles of his Feet) Did, by this Annointing, live three hundred yeares, without any Disease, save onely some Tumours, in the Soles of his fect: And of Artefius, who when bee found his Spirit, ready to depart, drew into his Body the Spirit of a certaine young Man; And thereby made him Breathlesse, But Himselfe lived many yeares by another Mans Spirit: And of Fortunate Houres, according to the Figures of Heaven, in which Medicines, are to bee gathered,

and compounded, for the prolongation of Life: And of the Seales of Planets, by which Vertues may be drawne, and fetched downe from Heaven, to prolong Life: And such like fabulous, and superstitious Vanities; Wee wonder exceedingly, that men should so much dote, as to suffer themselves to bee deluded with these Things. And againe, wee doe pittie Mankinde; that they should have the Hard Fortune, to bee besieged with such frivolous, and senselesse Apprehensions. But our Intentions, doe both come home to the Matter; And are far from vaine and credulous Imaginations: Being also such, as wee conceive, posteritie, may adde much to the Matters, which satisfie those Intentions; But to the Intentions themselves but a little. Notwithstanding

there are a few Things, and those of very great Moment, of which we would have Men to bee fore-warned.
               First, wee are of that Opinion, that wee esteeme the Offices of Life, to bee more worthy than Life it selfe. Therefore, if there be any Thing of that kinde, that may indeed exactly answer our Intentions, yet so, that the Offices, and Duties of Life, bee thereby hindred; whatsoever it be of this kind; wee reject it. Perhaps, wee may make some light Mention, of such Things, but wee 
                     〈◊〉
                   not upon them. For wee make no serieus, nor diligent Discourse; Either of hading the life in Caves, where the SunneBeames, and severall changes of the Aire, pierce not; Like 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   his Cave; Or of perpe tuall Baths, made of Liquour,

prepared; Or of Shirts, and Seare-cloathes, so applied, that the Body should bee alwayes, as it were, in a Box; Or of thick Paintings of the Body, after the manner of some Barbarous Nations; Or of an exact Ordering, of our Life, and Diet, which aimeth onlyat this, and mindeth nothing else, but that a Man live; (As was that of Herodicus, amongst the Ancients; And of Cornarus the Venetian; in our Dayes, but with greater Moderation;) Or of any such prodigie, Tediousnesse, or Inconvenience: But wee propound such Remedies, and 
                     〈◊〉
                  , by which the Offices of Life may neither be deserted, nor receive any great Interruptions, or Mo'estations.
               Secondly, on the other side, wee denounce unto Men, that they would give over 
                     〈◊〉
                  ; And

not imagine, that so great a Works as the Stopping, and Turning back, the powerfull Course of Nature, can bee brought to passe by some Morning Draught, or the Taking of some precious Drug; But that they would bee assured, that it must needs be, that this is a work of labour; And consisteth of many Remedies, and a fit Connexion of them amongst themselves; For no Man can bee so stupid, as to imagine, that what was never yet done, can bee done, but by such wayes, as were never yet attempted.
               Thirdly, we ingenuously professe; That some of those Things, which we shall propound, have not been tried by us, by way of Experiment; (For our Course of life doth not permit that;) But are derived, (as wee suppose) upon good Reason, out of our Principles

and Grounds; (of which, some we set downe, others we reserve in our Minde;) And are, as it were, cut, and digged out of the Rocke, and Mine of Nature Her selfe. Neverthelesse, wee have been carefull, and that with all Providence and Circumspection; (Seeing the Scripture saith of the Body of Man; That it is more worth than Raiment;) To propound such Remedies; as may at least be safe, if peradventure they be not Fruitfull.
               Fourthly, we would have Men rightly to observe, and distinguish; That those Things which are good for an Healthful Life, are not alwayes good for a Long Life. For there are some Things which doe further the Alacrity of the Spirits, and the Strength and Vigour of the Functions, which, notwithstanding, do cut off from

the summe of Life. And 
                     〈◊〉
                   other Things, which are 
                     〈◊〉
                   ble to Prolongation of Life; 
                     〈◊〉
                   are not without some Perill 
                     〈◊〉
                   Health, unlesse this Matter 
                     〈◊〉
                   salved by fit Remedies: Of 
                     〈◊〉
                   not withstanding, as occasien shal bee offered, wee will not omit, 
                     〈◊〉
                   give some Cautions, and 
                     〈◊〉
                  .
               Lastly, we have thought good to propound sundry 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   according to the severall Intentions; But the choice of those Remedies, and the Order of them to leave to Discretion. For to so downe exactly, which of them agreeth best, with which Constitution of Body, which with the severall Courses of Life; which with each Mans particular Age And how they are to be taken, out after another; And how the whole Practicque of these Things

be administred and governed; would both be too long; Neither it fit to be published.
               In the Topicks, we 
                     〈◊〉
                   three Intentions. The 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   of Consumption; The Perfecting of Reparation; And the Renewing of Oldnesse. But, seeing those Things, which 
                     〈◊〉
                   be said, are Nothing lesse 
                     〈◊〉
                   words; Wee will deduce 
                     〈◊〉
                   three Intentions, to Ten Operations.
               
               1 The First is, the Operation upon the Spirits, that they may 
                     〈◊〉
                   their Vigour.
               2 The Second Operation is, upon be Exclusion of Aire.
               
               3 The Third Operation is, upon the Bloud, and the Sanguifying Heat.
               
               4 The Fourth Operation is, upon the Juyces of the Body.
               
               
                  5 The Fifth Operation is, 
                        〈◊〉
                      the Bowels, for their 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   on of Aliment.
               6 The Sixth Operation is, upon the Outward Parts, for 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Attraction of Aliment.
               
               7 The Seventh Operation upon the Aliment it selfe, 
                        〈◊〉
                      the Insinuation thereof.
               
               8 The Eighth Operation is, 
                        〈◊〉
                      on the last Act of Assimilatioc
               9 The Ninth Operation is, up on the Inteneration of the Part after they begin to be Dried.
               10 The Tenth Operation is, on the Purging away of 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   Juyce, and Supplying of 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   Juyce.
               Of these Operations, the 
                     〈◊〉
                   first belong to the First Intention; The foure next to the 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Intention; And the two last, the Third Intention.
               
               But because this Part, touching

the Intentions, doth tend to Practice; under the Name of Historie, we will not onely comprise Experiments and Observations; But also Councels, Remedies, Explications of Causes, Assumptions, and whatsoever hath Reference hereunto.
            
         
         
            The Operation upon the Spirits, that they may remaine youthfull, and renue their Vigour.
            
               The Historie.
               1 THe Spirits are the Master-workmen of all Effects in the Bodie.
                  
This is manifest by Consent And by Infinite Instances.
               2 If any Man could procure that a young Mans Spirit: could be conveyed into 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   Mans Body; It is not unlikely, but this great Wheele of the Spirits, might turne 
                     〈◊〉
                   the lesser wheele of the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   And so the Course of 
                     〈◊〉
                   become Retrograde.
               3 In every Consumption whether it be by Fire, or by Age, the more the Spirit of the Body, or the Heat, preyeth upon the Moisture, 
                     〈◊〉
                   lesser is the Duration of the Thing. This occurres every where, and is manifest.
               4 The Spirits are to be 
                     〈◊〉
                   such a Temperament, and Degree of Activitie; 
                     〈◊〉
                   they should not, (as He 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Drinke or Guzzle the 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
of the Body; But Sippe them onely.
               
               5 There are two Kinds of Flames; The one Eager and weak, which consumes slight Substances, but hath little power over the Harder; As the Flame of Straw, or small Sticks; The other strong, and constant, which converts Hard and obstinate substances; As the Flame of Hard wood, and such like.
               6 The eager Flames, and yet lesse Robust, doe drie Bodies, and render them exhaust and Baplesse; But the stronger Flames, doe 
                     〈◊〉
                   and melt them.
               7 Also in 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Mediines, some vapour forth the 
                     〈◊〉
                   part of the Tumours, or Swellings; and these 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Tumour; Others potently

discusse, and these Soften it.
               8 Also in Purging and Absterging Medicines; some carry away the Fluide Humours violently; others draw the more Obstinate and viscous.
               9 The Spirits ought to be invested, and armed with such a Heat; That they may choose rather to stirre and 
                     〈◊〉
                   Hard and obstinate Matters; Than to discharge, and carry away the thin and prepared: For by that meanes, the Body becomes Greene and Solide.
               10 The Spirits are so to be wrought and tempered; That they may be; In Substance, Dense, 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   Rare; In Heat, Strong, 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   Eager In Quantity, Sufficient for the Offices of Life, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   Redundant, or TurgideIn Motion, Appeased; 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  
                  
Dancing, or Unequall.
               11 That Vapours worke powerfully upon the Spirits, it is manifest; By Sleepe; by Drunkennesse; by Melancholy Passions; By Laetificant Medicines; By Odours calling the Spirits back againe, in Swounings, and Faintings.
               12 The Spirits are condensed foure wayes; Either by Putting them to Flight; Or by Refrigerating and Cooling them; Or by Stroaking them; Or by Quieting them. And first of their Condensation, by putting them to Flight.
               
               13 Whatsoever putteth to Flight on all parts, driveth the Body into his Center; And so condenseth.
               
               14 To the Condenfution of the Spirits by Flight, the most Powerfull and Effectuall, is

                  Opium; And next, Opiates; And generally, all 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Things.
               
               15 The force of Opium, to the Condensation of the Spirits, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   exceeding strong; When as perhaps, three graines thereof will, in a short time, so Coagulate the Spirits, that they returne no more, but are extinguished, and become Im moveable.
               16 Opium, and the like, put not the Spirits to Flight, by their Coldnesse; For they have Parts manifestly Hot; But, 
                     〈◊〉
                   the contrary, coole, by their putting the Spirits to Flight.
               
               17 The Flight of the Spirits, by Opium, and Opiate Medicines, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   best seene, by applying 
                     〈◊〉
                   same outwardly; For the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   straight withdraw themselves; And will returne 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
more; But the Part is Mortified; And turnes to a Gangrene.
               
               18 Opiates, in Grievous Pains, as in the Stone, or the Cutting off, of a Lunme, mitigate paines; Most of all, by putting the Spirits to Flight.
               
               19 Opiates obtaine a good Effect, from a bad Cause; For the Flight of the Spirits is Evill; But the Condensation of them, through their Flight, is Good.
               20 The Grecians attributed much, both for Health, and for Prolongation of Life, to Opiates; But the Arabians, much more. In so much, that their Grand Medicines, (which they called, the Gods Hands;) Had Opium, for their Basis, &amp; principall Ingredient, other Things being mixed, to abate and correct the Noxious Qualities

thereof: Such were Treacle, Mithridate, and the rest.
               21 Whatsoever is given, with good successe, in the curing of pestilentiall and Malignant Diseases; To stop and Bridle the Spirits, lest they grow Turbulent, and Tumultuate, May, very happily, be transferred to Prolongation of Life: For one Thing is effectuall unto both; Namely, the Condensation of the Spirits: Now there is nothing better for that, than Opiates.
               
               22 The Turkes finde Opium, even in a reasonable good quantitie, Harmelesse, and Comfortable; In so much, that they take it, before their Battell, to excite Courage; But to us, unlesse it be in a very small Quantity, and with

good Correctives, it is Mortall.
               23 Opium, and Opiates, are maaifestly found to excite Venus; Which shewes them to have force, to corroborate the Spirits.
               
               24 Distilled mater of wilde Poppie, is given with good successe, in Sursets, Agues, and divers Diseases. Which, no doubt, is a Temperate kinde of Opiate: Neither let any man wonder at the various use of it; For that is Familiar to Opiates; In regard that the Spirits, corroborated and Condensed, will rise up against any Disease.
               25 The Turkes use a kinde of Herb, which they call Caphe; which they dry, and powder; And then drinke it in warme water; Which they say, doth

not a little sharpen them, both in their Courage, and in their Wits; Notwithstanding, if it be taken in a large Quantity, it affects, and disturbs the Minde; Whereby it is manifost, that it is of the same Nature with Opiates.
               
               26 There is a Root, much renowmed in al the Easternparts, which they call Betel; Which the Indians, and others, use to carry in their Mouths, and to champ it: And by that champing, they are wonderfully enabled, both to endure Labours, and to overcome Sicknesses, and to the Act of carnall Copulation: It seemes to be a kinde of Stupefactive, because it exceedingly blacks the Teeth.
               27 Tobacco, in our Age, is immoderately growne into use;

And it affects Men with a secret kinde of Delight; In so much, that they who have once inured themselves to it, can hardly afterwards leave it: And, no doubt, it hath power to lighten the Body, and to shake off wearinesse: Now the vertue of it, is commonly thought to be, because it opens the Passages, and void. Humours: But it may more rightly bee referred to the Condensation of the Spirits; For it is a kinde of Henbane; And manifestly troubles the Head, as Opiates doe.
               28 There are sometimes Humours engendred in the Bodie, which are, as it were, Opiate themselves; As it is in some kinde of Melancholies; With which if a Man be affected, it is a signe of very Long Life.
               
                  29 The Simple Opiates, (which are also called Stupefactives,) are these; Opium it self, which is the Juyce of Poppy; Both the Poppies, as well in the Herb, as in the Seed; Henbane; Mandrake; Hemlock; Tobacco; Night-shade.
               
               30 The Compound 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  are, Treacle; Mitbridate; Trifera; Ladanum Paracelsi; Diacodium; Diascordium; Philonium; Pills of Hounds-Tongue.
               31 From this which hath been said, certaine Designations, or Councels, may be deduced, for the Prolongation of Life, according to the present Intention; Namely, of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   the Spirits by Opiates.
               
               32 Let there be therfore, every yeare, from Adult yeares of Youth, an Opiate Diet; Let it bee taken about the end

of May; Because the Spirits in Summer, are more Loose, and Attenuated; And there is lesse Danger from Cold Humours: Let it bee some Magistrall Opiate, weaker than those that are commonly in use, both in rtspect of a smaller Quantity of Opium, and of a more sparing mixture of extreme Hot Things: Let it be taken in the Morning betwixt sleeps. The Fare for that time would bee more simple, and sparing, than or linary, without Wine, or Spices, or Vaporous Things: This Medicine to be taken onely each Other Day; And to bee continued for a Fortnight. This Designation, in our Judgement, comes home to the Intention.
               
               33 Opiates also may bee taken,

not onely by the Mouth, but also by Fumes; But the Fumes must bee such, as may not move the Expulsive Facultie too strongly, nor force downe Humours; But only taken in a Weft, may worke upon the Spirits, within the Braine: And therefore, a Suffumigation of Tobacco, Lignum Alce; Rose-Mary Leaves dr ed, and a little Myrrhe, snuffed up in the Morning, at the Mouth and Nosthrils, would bee very good.
               34 In Grand Opiaces; Such as are Treacle, Mithridate, and the rest; It would not bee amisse (especially in Youth,) to take rather the Distilled Waters of Them, than themselves, in their Bodies: For the Vapour, in Distilling, doth rise; But the Heat of the Medicine,

commonly, 
                     〈◊〉
                  : Now Distilled Waters, are good, in those vertues, which are conveyed by Vapours, In other Things, but weake.
               35 There are Medicines, which have a certaine weak, and hidden Degree; And therefore safe; Toan Opiate Vertue. These send froth a Slow, 
                     〈◊〉
                   Copious Vapour, but not 
                     〈◊〉
                  , as Opiates doe: Therefore they put not the Spirits to 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; Notwithstanding they congregate them, and somewhat thicken them.
               36 Medicines in Order to Opiates, ate: Principally Saffron; Next Folium Indum; AmberGrise; Coriander-Seed prepared; Amomum, and 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  ; Lignum-Rhodium; OrengeFlower Water; And much more, the infusion of the same
                  
                  Flowers, new gathered, in Oyle of Almonds; Nutmegs pricked full of Holes, and macerated in Rose water.
               37 As Opiates are to be taken very sparingly, and at certaine times, as was said; So these Secundaries may be taken familiarly, and in our daily Diet; And they will be very effectuall to prolongation of life. Certainly, an Apothecarie of Calecute, by the use of Amber, is said to have lived, 
                     〈◊〉
                   hundred and sixtie yeares; And the Noble Men of Barbarie, through the use thereof, are certified to be very long liv'd; whereas the meane people are but of short life: And our Ancestours, who were longer liv'd than wee, did use Saffron much; In their Cakes, Broathes, and the like. And

touching the first way, of Condensing the Spirits, by Opiates, and the Subordinates thereto. thus much.
               38 Now we will inquire of the second way, of Condensing the Spirits, by Cold. For the proper worke of Cold is Condensation; And it is done, without my Malignitie, or adverse Qualitie; And therefore it is a fafer Operation, than by Opiates; Though somewhat lesse powerfull, if it bee done by Turnes only, as Opiates are: But then againe, because it may bee used familiarly, and in our daily Diet with Moderation; It is much more powerfull for the Prolongation of Life, than by Opiates.
               
               39 The Refrigeration of the Spirits, is effected three wayes;

Either by Respiration; or by 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; or by Aliment. The first is the best, but, in a sort, out of our power; The second is potent, but yet ready, and at hand; The third is weake, and somewhat about.
               40 Aire cleare and pure; And which hath no Fogginesse in it, before it bee received into the Lungs; And which is least exposed to the Sun-beames; Condenseth the Spirits best; Such is found, either on 
                     〈◊〉
                   Tops of Drie Mountaines, or in 
                     〈◊〉
                  , open to the windes, and yet not without some shade.
               41 As 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Refrigeration, and 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   of the Spirits, by Vapours; The Root of this Operation wee place in Nitre; As a Creature purposely made, and chosen, for this

end; Being thereunto lead, and perswaded, by these Arguments.
               42 Nitre is a kinde of Coole Spice: This is apparent to the sense it selfe; For it bites the Tongue, and Palate, with Cold, as Spices doe with Heat: And it is the onely Thing, as 
                     〈◊〉
                   as wee know, that hath this propertie.
               43 Almost all cold Things, (which are cold properly, and not by Accident, as Opium is,) are poore, and jejune, of Spirit; Contrarily, Things full of Spirit, are almost all Hot: Only Nitre is found amongst Vegetables, which 
                     〈◊〉
                   with Spirit, and yet is Cold. As for Camphire, which is full of Spirit, and yet performeth the Actions of Cold, it cooleth by Accident onely; As

namely, for that by the Thinnesse thereof, without Acrimonie, it helpeth Perspiration, in In flammations.
               44 In Congealing, and Freezing. of Liquours; (which is latel growne into use;) By Laying Snow, and Ice, on the Outside of the Vessell; Nitre is also added; And, no doubt, it exciteth, and 
                     〈◊〉
                  , the Congelation. It is 
                     〈◊〉
                  , that they use also, for this worke, ordnarie Bay-salt; which doth rather give Activitie, to the Coldnesse of the Snow, than coo'e by it selfe: But, as I have 
                     〈◊〉
                   in the Hotter Regions, where snow fals not the Congealing is wrought by Nitre alone; But this I can not certainly affirme.
               45 It is affirmed, that 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , which consisteth principally

of Nitre, being taken in drink, doth conduce to Valour; And that it is used oftentimes, by Mariners, and Souldiers, before they begin their Battels, as the Turks doe Opium.
               
               46 Nitre is given, with good successe, in Burning Agues, and Pestilentiall Fevers, to mitigate, and Bridle, their per. nicious Heats.
               47 It is most manifest, that 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , in Gunpowder, doth mightily abhorre Flame; From whence is caused, that Horrible Crack, and Puffing.
               48 Nitre is found to bee, as it were, the Spirit of the Earth; For this is most certaine; That any Earth, though pure, and unmixt with Nitrous Matter, if it bee so laid up, and covered, that it be free from the

Sun-beames, and putteth forth no Vegetable, will gather Nitre, even in good Abundance. By which it is clear, That the Spirit of Nitre, is not only inferiour to the Spirit of living Creatures, but also to the Spirit of Vegetables.
               49 Cattell, which drink of Nitrous water, doe manifestly grow Fat; which is a Signe, of the Cold, in Nitre.
               
               50 The Manuring of the Soile, is chiefly, by Nitrous Substances; For all Dung is Nitrous: And this is a signe, of the Spirit, in Nitre.
               
               51 From hence it appeares, that the Spirits of Man, may be cooled, and condensed, by the Spirit of Nitre; And bee made more Crude, and lesseeager: And therefore, as strong wines, and spices, and

the like, doe burne the Spirits, and shorten life; So, on the contrary side, Nitre doth compose, and represse them, and furthereth to long Life.
               52 Nitre may be used; In Meat, mixed with our Salt, to the tenth part of the Salt; In Broaths, taken in the Morning, from three Graines to ten; Also in Beere; But howsoever it be used, with Moderation, it is of prime Force, to long Life.
               53 As Opium holds the preheminence, in Condensing the Spirits, by putting them to Flight; And hath withall his Subordinates; lesse potent, but more safe; which may bee taken, both in greater Quantitie, and in more frequent use; Of which wee have formerly spoken; So also Nitre, which

                  condenseth the Spirits by Cold and by a kinde of Frescour. (as we now adayes speak) 
                     〈◊〉
                   also his Subordinates.
               
               54 Subordinates to Nitre are All those Things, which yeeld an Odour, some what Earthy; Like the smell of Earth, pure, and good, newly digged or turned up: Of this sort, the chiefe are; Boragi Buglesse, Langue de Boe uf, Butnet; Strawberrie Leaves, and Strawberries, Frambois, or Raspis; Raw Cucumbers; Ram Permaines; Vine-leaves, and Buds; Also Violets.
               
               55 The next, in order, are those, which have a certaine Freshnesse of smell, but somewhat more inclined to Heat; yet not altogether void, of that vertue, of Refreshing by Coolenesse: Such as are

Balme; Greene Citrons; Greene Orenges; Rose-water distilled; Roasted Wardens; Also, the Dimask, Red, and Musk Rose.
               
               56 This is to bee noted; That Subordinates to Nitre, doe, commonly, conferre more, to this Intention, Raw, than having passed the Fire; Because that Spirit of Cooling, is dissipated by the Fire: Therefore, they are best taken, either infused in some Liquour, or Raw.
               57 As the Condensation of the Spirits, by Subordinates to Opium, is, in some sort, performed by Odours; So also that, which is by Subordinates to Nitre: Therefore, the smell, of new, and pure Earth, taken, either by following the plough, or by Digging, or by Weeding, excellently 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
sheth the Spirits: Also, the Leaves of Trees, in Woods or Hedges, falling towa 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Middle of Autumne, 
                     〈◊〉
                   a good Refreshing to the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; But none so good, 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Strawberrie Leaves Dying Likewise, the smell of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   or Wall-flowers, or 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , or Sweet Briar, or 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , suckles, taken, as they grow, 
                     〈◊〉
                   passing by them only, is of the like Nature.
               58 Nay, and we knew a certain great Lord, who lived long that had, every Morning, inmediately after Sleepe, a 
                     〈◊〉
                   of fresh Earth, laid in a 
                     〈◊〉
                   Napkin, under his Nose, 
                     〈◊〉
                   he might take the smell them of.
               59 There is no doubt, but 
                     〈◊〉
                   Cooling, and Tempering, 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Bloud, by Coole Thing

Such as are, Endive, Succourie, Liver-wort; Purslaine, and the like; Doth also, by Consequent, coole the Spirits: But this is about, whereas vapours coole immediately.
               And as touching the Condensing of the Spirits, by Cold, thus much: The Third way, of Condensing the Spirits, wee 
                     〈◊〉
                   to be, by that which wee call, Stroaking the Spirits: The fourth, by Quieting the Alacritie, and Vnrulinesse of them.
               60 Such Things, Stroake the Spirits, as are pleasing, and friendly to them, yet they allure them not, to goe abroad but rather prevaile, that the Spirits, contented, as it were, in their owne societie, doe enjoy themselves; And berake

themselves into their proper Center.
               61 For these, if you 
                     〈◊〉
                   those Things, which were formerly set down, as Subordinates, to Opium, and Nitre, there will need no other Inquisition.
               
               62 As for the Quieting, of the Vnrulines, of the spirits, we 
                     〈◊〉
                   presently speak of that, when we inquire, touching their Motion. Now then, seeing we have spoken, of that Condensation of the Spirits, which pertaineth to their Substance, we will come to the Temper of Heat, in them.
               63 The Heat of the Spirits, as wee said, ought to bee of that kinde, that it may be 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   not Eager, And may delight rather, to master the 
                     〈◊〉
                   and Obstinate, than to carrie

away, the thin, and light Humours.
               64 We must beware of Spices, Wine, and strong Drinks; That our use of them be very Temperate, and sometimes discontinued: Also of Savorie, Wilde-Marjoram, Pennie-royall; And all such, as bite, and heat the Tongue. For they yeeld unto the Spirits, an Heat, not Operative, but 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     .
               
               65 These yeeld a Robust Heat, Especially Elecampane, Garlick, 
                        〈◊〉
                      Benedictus, Water-Cresses, while they are young; Cermander, Angelica, 
                        〈◊〉
                     , Vervin, Valerian, Myrrhe, Pepper-mort, 
                        〈◊〉
                     , Garden-Chervile; The 
                     〈◊〉
                   of these things with 
                     〈◊〉
                  , and judgement, sometimes in Sallets, sometimes in

Medicines, will satisfie this Operation.
               
               66 It fals out well, that the Grand Opiates, will also serve excellently for this Operation, In respect, that they yeeld such an Heat by Composition, which is wished, but not to be found in simples. For the 
                     〈◊〉
                   of those Excessive 
                     〈◊〉
                   Things; (Such as are; Euphorbium, Pellitory of Spain Stavis-acre, Dragon-mort,

                      Castoreum, Aristolochian Opoponax, Ammoniacum,

and Mithridate, and the rest, are not sharp, nor bite the Tongue; But are onely somewhat bitter, and of strong seat; And at last manifest their Heat, when they come into the stomack; and in their subsequent Operations.

                   not devoure so much, as

a great flame,) the

                   will be short.
               69 It seemes to bee approved by Experience; That a 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Diet, and almost a

               70 Hitherto appertaine;

                     〈◊〉
                   all these diminish the Spirit and reduce them to such

                  Quantitie, as may be sufficient only for the Functions of life; whereby the Depredation is the lesse.
               71 But if the Diet shall not bee 
                     〈◊〉
                   so Rigorous, and

                     〈◊〉
                   the same effect. We see in Flames; That a Flame somewhat bigger, (so it bee alwayes alike, and quiet,) 
                     〈◊〉
                   lesse of the Fewell,

                   hee exceeded an hundred yeares of Age, strong in Lims,

and entire in his senses.
               72 Care also must bee taken that a Body, plentifully Nourished, and not emaciated by any of these aforesaid Diet omitteth not a seasonable use of Venus; lest the Spirits increase too fast, and soften, and destroy the body: So then touching a Moderate

                   of Spirits, and (as we may say) Frugall, thus much.

                  Motion, doth manifestly

                  , and Inflame them. 
                     〈◊〉
                   Brideling is done, by 
                     〈◊〉
                   Meanes: By Sleepe; By Avoiding of vchement 
                        〈◊〉
                      Immoderate Exercise, and, a word, all Lassitude; And by Refraining Irksome 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  
                  
And first, touching Sleep.
               
               74 The Fable tels us, that 
                     
                        〈◊◊〉
                     
                   many yeares together, in a Cave; And all that 
                     〈◊〉
                   needed no Meat; 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Spirits waste not much in sleep.
               
               75 Experience teacheth us, 
                     〈◊〉
                   certaine Creatures, as 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , and 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , Sleepe, in 
                     〈◊〉
                   close places, an whole Winter together; Such is the Force of Sleepe, to restraine all 
                     〈◊〉
                   Consumption. That which Bees, and Drones, are also thought to doe; Though sometimes destitute of 
                     〈◊〉
                  : And likewise Butterflies, and other Flies.
               
               76 Sleepe after Dinner, (The Stomack sending up no unpleasing Vapours to the Head, as being the first Dewes of our Meat,) is good for the

                  Spirits, but derogatorie and hurtfull, to all other points of Health. Notwithstanding it extreme Old Age, there is the same Reason, of Meat, and Sleepe; For both, our Meales, and our Sleeps, should be then frequent, but short, and little: Nay, and towards the last Period of Old Age, a meere Rest, and, as it were, a perpetuall Repasing, doth best; Especially in Winter time.
               77 But as Moderate Sleepe, conferreth to Long Life; So much more, if it be Quiet, and not Disturbed.
               78 These procure Quiet Sleep Violets, Lettuce, especially boiled; Syrupe of Dried Roses: Saffron; Balme; Apples at out going to Bed; A Sop of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   in Malmesey, especially wherein Musk Roses have beene first

                  
                     〈◊〉
                  ; Therefore, it would 
                     〈◊〉
                   be amisse, to make some 
                     〈◊〉
                  , or a small Draught, of 
                     〈◊〉
                   things, and to use it 
                     〈◊〉
                  . Also those Things, 
                     〈◊〉
                   shut the Mouth of the 
                     〈◊〉
                   close; As Coriander 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   prepared; Quinces; and 
                     〈◊〉
                  , roasted; doe induce 
                     〈◊〉
                   Sleepe: But above all things, in youth, and for those that have sufficient strong Stomacks, it will bee best, to take a good Draught, of Cleare, Cold, Water, when they goe to Bed.
               Touching voluntarie, and procured Traunces; As also Fixed, and Profound Thoughts, so as they be without Irksomenesse; I have nothing certaine: No doubt, they make to this Intention; And condense the Spirits; And that more potently, than Sleepe;
                  
Seeing, they lay asleepe, and 
                     〈◊〉
                   the senses, as much, or more. Touching them, let further Inquiry be made. So farre touching Sleepe.
               
               79 As for Motion, and Exercises; Lasfitude hurteth; And so doth all Motion, and Exercise, which is too Nimble, and Swife; As Running; Tennis; Fencing; And the like: And againe, when our strength is extended, and strained, to the uttermost; As Dancing; Wrestling; and such like: For it is certaine, that the Spirits, being driven into streights, either by the swiftnesse of the Motion, or by the straining of the Forces; Doe afterward become more Eager, and Predatorie. On the other side, Exercises, which stirre up a good strong Motion;

But not over swift, or to our utmost strength, (such is are Leaping, Shooting, Riding, Bowling, and the like,) doe not hurt, but rather benefit.
               We must come now to the Affections, and Passions of the Minde; And see, which of them are Hurtfull to long Life; which profitable.
               80 Great joyes attenuate and diffuse the Spirits, and shorten Life: Familiar Cheerfulnesse strengthens the Spirits, by calling them forth, and yet not resolving them.
               81 Impressions of joy in the sense, are naught; Ruminations of joy in the Memory; Or Apprehensions of them, in Hope, or Fancie, are good.
               
                  82 Ioy suppressed, or communicated sparingly, doth more comfort the Spirits, than Joy powred forth and published.
               83 Griefe and Sadnesse, if it be void of Feare, and 
                     〈◊〉
                   not too much, doth rather prolong Life; For it contracteth the Spirits, and is a kind of Condensation.
               
               84 Great Feares shorten the Life; For though Griefe and Feare doe both streighten the Spirit, yet in Griefe there is a simple Contraction; But in Feare, by Reason of the Cares taken for the Remedy, and Hope, intermixed, there is a Turmoile and Vexing of the Spirits.
               
               85 Anger soporessed, is also a kinde of Vexation, and causeth the Spirit to feed upon

the Juyces of the Body; But let loose, and breaking forth, it helpeth; As those 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   doe, which induce a Robust Heat.
               
               86 Envie is the worst of all 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; And feedeth upon the Spirits; And they againe upon the Body; And so much the more, because it is perpetuall, And as is said, Keepeth no Holydayes.
               
               87 Pity of another Mans Misfortune, which is not likely to befall our selves, is good; But Pity, which may reflect, with some similitude, upon the Party pitying, is naught, because it exciteth Feare.
               
               88 Light Shame hurteth not, seeing it contracteth the Spirits a little, and then straight diffuseth them; In so much, that Shamefast Persons commonly

live long: But 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   for some great Ignominie, and which afflicteth the Minde long, contracteth the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , even to suffocation; And is Pernicious.
               89 Love, if it be not unfortunate, and too deeply wounding, is a kinde of Ioy; And 
                     〈◊〉
                   subject to the same Lawes, which wee have set downe touching Ioy.
               
               90 Hope is the most Beneficial of all the Affections; And doth much to the Prolongation of Life, if it bee not too often Frustrated; But entertaineth the Fancie, with an Expectation of Good: Therefore they which fix, and propound to themselves, some End, a the Marke and Scope of their Life; And continually, and by Degrees, goe forward 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
the same; Are, for the most 
                     〈◊〉
                  , long Liv'd: In so much, that when they are come to the Top of their Hope; And 
                     〈◊〉
                   goe no Higher therein; They commonly droope, and Live not long after: So that Hope is as a Leafe-Ioy; Which may be beaten out, to a great Extension, like Gold.
               
               91 Admiration, and Light Contemplation, are very powerfull, to the prolonging of Life; for they hold the Spirits, in 
                     〈◊〉
                   Things as Delight them; And suffer them not to tumultuate or to carry themselves unquietly, and waywardly. And therefore, all the Contemplatours of Naturall Things, which had so many, and so eminent Objects to admire; (As Democritus, Plato, Parmenides, Apollonius,) were

long Liv'd: Also 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , which tasted but lightly of Things; And studied rather Exornation of Speech, than profundity of Matters, were also long Liv'd; As Gorgias, Protagoras, I socraetes, Seneca: And certainly, as old Men are, for the most part, Talkative; So Talkative Men, doe often grow very old: For it shewes a Light Contemplation; And such as doth not much straine the Spirits, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   them. But Subtill, and Acute, and Eager Inquisition. shortens Life; For it tireth the Spirit, and wasteth it.
               And as touching the Motion of the Spirits, by the Affections of the Minde, thus much Now we will adde certaine other Generall Observations touching the Spirits, beside

the former; Which fall not 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Precedent Distribution.
               92 Especiall Care must be taken, that the Spirits bee not too often Resolved; For 
                     〈◊〉
                   goeth before Resolution; And the Spirit once 
                     〈◊〉
                  , doth not very easily retire, or is Condensed: Now Resolution is caused, by Overgreat Labours; Over-vehement Affections of the Mind; Over-great Sweats; Overgreat Evacuations; Hot Baths, And an untemperate, and unseasonable use of Venus: Also by Over-great Cares, and Carpings, and Anxious Expectations: Lastly, by Malignane Diseases, and Intolerable Paines and Torments of the Body; All which, as much as

may bee, (which our Vulga Phyficians also advise,) must be avoided.
               93 The Spirits are delighted, both with Wonted Things, and with New: Now it makert wonderfully to the Conservation of the Spirits, in 
                     〈◊〉
                   That wee neither use 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   Things, to a Satiety, and 
                     〈◊〉
                   Nor New Things, before a quick, and strong Appetite: And therefore, both Customes are to be broken off with Judgement, and Care, before they breed a Fulnesse, And the Appetite, aster New Things, to be restrained for a Time, untill it grow more Sharp and jocund: And, moreover, the Life, as much as may be, so to be ordered; That it may have many Renovations; And the Spirits, by perpetuall

Conversing in the same Actions, may not wax Dull. For though it were no ill 
                     〈◊〉
                   of Seneca's; The Fools doth 
                        〈◊〉
                      begin to Live; Yet this Folly, and many more such, are good for long Life.
               94 It is to bee observed, 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Spirits; (though the Contrary useth to be done;) That when Men perceive their Spirits to be in a good, 
                     〈◊〉
                   and Healthfull State; (That which will be seene, by the Tranquillitie of their 
                     〈◊〉
                   and cheerefull 
                     〈◊〉
                  ) That they cherish them, and not change them: But when, in a Turbulent, and untoward State; (Which will also appeare by their Sadnesse, Lumpishnesse, and other Indisposition of their Minde;) That then they

straight overwhelme them and alter them. Now the Spirits are contained in the same state; By a Restraining of the Affections; Temperatenes of Diet; Abstinence from 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; Moderation in Labour; Indifferent Rest and Repose: And the Contrary to these, do alter and over-whelme the Spirits; As Namely, Vehe ment Affections; Profuse Feastings; Immoderate Venus; Difficult labours; Earnest Studies, and prosecutions of Businesse. Yet Men are wont when they are Merriest, and best disposed, then to apply themselves to Feastings, 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   Labours, Endevours, Businesses; whereas, if they have a regard to long Life; (which may seeme strange,) they should rather Practise the

Contrary. For wee ought to 
                     〈◊〉
                   and preserve good Spirits; And for the evill disposed Spirits, to discharge and alter them.

                   saith not unwisely; That Old Men, for the Comforting of their Spirits, ought often to remember, and 
                     〈◊〉
                   upon the Acts of their Childhood and Youth. Certainly, such a Remembrance, is a 
                     〈◊〉
                   of Peculiar 
                     〈◊〉
                  , to every Old Man: And therefore it is a Delight to Men, to enjoy the Societie of them, which have beene brought up together with them; And to visit the places of their Education. Vespasian did attribute so much to this Matter; That when hee was 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , hee would, by no meanes, bee perswaded to

leave his Fathers House, though but meane; Lest bee should lose the wonted Object of his Eyes, and the Memory of his child-hood: 
                     〈◊〉
                   besides, he would drinke, 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Woodden Cup, tipped with 
                     〈◊〉
                   which was his Grandmothers, upon Festivall Dayes.
               
               96 One Thing, above all, gratefull to the Spirits; 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   there be a Continuall Progresse to the more Benigne. Therefore, wee should lead, such Youth, and Manhood, the our Old Age should find 
                     〈◊〉
                   Solaces; Whereof the 
                     〈◊〉
                   is, Moderate Ease. And there fore, Old Men, in Honourable Places, lay violent Hands up on themselves, who retire 
                     〈◊〉
                   to their Ease: whereof 
                     〈◊〉
                   be found an Eminent Example in Cassiodorus; who was 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   Reputation amongst the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Kings of Italy, that he 
                     〈◊〉
                   as the Soule of their 
                     〈◊〉
                  : Afterwards, being neare 
                     〈◊〉
                   yeares of Age, he 
                     〈◊〉
                   himselfe to a 
                     〈◊〉
                  ; Where he ended not his 
                     〈◊〉
                  , before he was an 
                     〈◊〉
                   years old. But this Thing 
                     〈◊〉
                   require two Cautions; 
                     〈◊〉
                  , that they drive not off, 
                     〈◊〉
                   their Bodies bee utterly 
                     〈◊〉
                   out, and Diseased; For 
                     〈◊〉
                   such Bodie, all Mutation, 
                     〈◊〉
                   to the more Benigne, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   Death: The other, 
                     〈◊〉
                   they surrender not themselves to a Sluggish Ease; But 
                     〈◊〉
                   they Embrace something, which may entertaine their Thoughts, and Minde, with Contentation: In which 
                     〈◊〉
                  , the chiefe Delights, are Reading and Contemplation;

And then, the Desires of 
                     〈◊〉
                   ding, and Planting.
               97 Lastly; The same 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Endevour, and Labour, under taken Cheerefully, and with good will, doth Refresh 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Spirits; But, with an 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      tion and Vnwillingnesse, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   Fret, and Deject them. 
                     〈◊〉
                   therefore, it conferreth 
                     〈◊〉
                   long Life; Either that a 
                     〈◊〉
                   hath the Art, to institute 
                     〈◊〉
                   Life so, as it may be Free, 
                     〈◊〉
                   Sutable to his owne 
                     〈◊〉
                   Or else to lay such a Command upon his minde, that whatsoever is imposed by Fortune, it may rather lead him than drag him.
               98 Neither is that to be 
                     〈◊〉
                   ted, towards the Government of the Affections, That espe ciall care bee taken, of 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Mouth of the Stomach; Espe

cially,that it be not too much 
                     〈◊〉
                  ; For that part hath a greater Dominion over the Affections; Especially the Daily Affections; Than either the Heart, or Braine: Only those Things excepted, which are wrought by potent Vapours; As in Drunkennesse, and Melancholy.
               99 Touching the Operation upon the Spirits, that they may remaine Youthfull, and Renew their Vigour, thus much. Which wee have done the more accurately, for that there 
                     〈◊〉
                  , for the most part, amongst Physicians, and other Authors, 
                     〈◊〉
                   these Operations, a deepe silence: But especially, because the Operation upon the Spirits, and their Waxing 
                        〈◊〉
                      againe, is the most Realy, and Compendious way, to

long Life: And that, for a two-fold Compendiousnesse; One, because the Spirits work compendiously, upon the Body; The other, because Vpours, and the Affections, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   compendiously upon the Spirits: So as these attaine the end, as it were, in a right line: Other Things, rather in lines Circular.
            
         
         
            
            The Operation upon the Exclusion of the Aire. 2.
            
               The Historie.
               1 THe Exclusion of the Aire, Ambient, tendeth to Length of Life, two wayes; First, for 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Externall Aire, next 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Native Spirit, (
                     〈◊〉
                   the Aire may be said to 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Spirit of Man; 
                     〈◊〉
                   conferreth not a little to 
                     〈◊〉
                  ;) Doth most of all 
                     〈◊〉
                   upon the Juyces of the 
                     〈◊〉
                  ; And hasten the Desiction thereof; And 
                     〈◊〉
                  , the Exclusion of it, is effectuall

to Length of Life.
               2 Another Effect, which followeth the Exclusion of Aire is much more subtill and profound; Namely, that the Bedie closed up, and not perspring by the Pores, detaineth the Spirit within, and turneth it upon the Harder Parts of the Body; Whereby the Spirit Mollifies, and Intenerate them.
               3 Of this Thing, the 
                     〈◊〉
                   is explained in the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   of Inanimate Bodies, And it 
                     〈◊〉
                   an Axiome almost infallible That the Spirit Discharged and Issuing forth, dryeth Bodies, Detained, melteth, 
                     〈◊〉
                   intenerateth them: And it further to bee assumed; 
                     〈◊〉
                   all Heat doth properly 
                     〈◊〉
                   nuate and moisten; And cotracteth, and Drieth only Accident.
               
                  4 Leading the Life in Dens and 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , where the Aire receives not the Sun-beams, may be effectuall to long Life: For the Aire, of it selfe, doth not much towards the Depredation of the Body, unlesse it be stirred up by Heat. Certainly, if a Man shall recall Things past to his Memory, it will appeare, that the Statures of Men, have beene anciently much greater, than those that succeeded; As in Sicely, and some other Places. But this kind of Men led their Lives, for the most part, in Caves. Now Length of Life, and largenesse of Lims, have some Affinity. The Cave also, of Epimenides, walkes amongst the Fables. I suppose like wise, that the Life of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Anchorites, was a Thing Resembling the Life

in Caves; In respect, the Sunbeams could not much pierce thither; Nor the Aire receive any great changes, or Inequalitles. This is certaine; Both the Simeon Stylita's, as well Daniel, as Saba; And other Columnar Anchorites, have been exceedingly long Liv'd. Likewise, the Anchorites in our dayes, closed up, and immured, either within Walls, or Pillars, are often found to be long Liv'd.
               5 Next unto the Life in 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   is the Life on Mountaines: For as the Beames of the Sun, doe not penetrate into Caves; So on the Tops of Mountaines, being destitute of Reflexion, they are of small force. But this is to be understood 
                     〈◊〉
                   Mountaines, where the 
                     〈◊〉
                   is cleare, and pure; Namely

whether, by reason of the Drinasse of the Valleyes, Clouds, and Vapours, doe not ascend: As it is in the Mountaines, which encompasse Barbary; Where, even at this day, they live, many times, to an Hundred and fifty yeares; As hath been noted before.
               6 And this kinde of Aire; Of Caves, and Mountaines, of his owne proper Nature, is little or nothing Predatory: But 
                     〈◊〉
                   such as ours is, which is Predatory through the Heat of the Sunne, ought, as much 
                     〈◊〉
                   is possible, to be excluded from the Body.
               7 But the Aire, is prohibited, 
                     〈◊〉
                   excluded two waies; First, 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Closing the Pores; 
                     〈◊〉
                  , by Filling them up.
               8 To the Closing of the Pores, 
                     〈◊〉
                   Coldnesse of the Aire;

Going Naked, whereby the Skin is made Hard; Washing in Cold Water; Astringents applyed to the Skin; Such as are, Mastick, Myrrhe, Myrtle.
               
               9 But much more may we satisfie this Operation, by 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   yet those rarely used, (especially in Summer;) which are made of Astringent Mineral waters, such as may safely be used; As Waters participating of Steele and Coppera; For these do potently contract the Skinne.
               10 As for Filling up the Pores; Paintings, and such like 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      ous Dawbings; And, (which may most commodiously be used) Oyle, and Fat Things; Do nolesse conserve the Substance of the Body, than 
                     〈◊〉
                   colours and Vernish doe preserve Wood.
               
                  
11 The Ancient Britons painted their Bodies with Woad, and were exceeding long Liv'd: The Picts also used Paintings; And are thought, by some, to have derived their Name from thence.
               12 The Brasilians, and Virginians, Paint themselves, at this day; Who are, (especially the former,) very long Liv'd. In so much, that sive yeares agoe, the French Iesuites had speech with some, who remembred the Building of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; which was done an hundred and twenty years since: And they were then at Mans estate.
               13 Ioannes de Temporibus, who is reported to have extended his Life to three hundred yeares; Being asked, How he preserved himselfe so long;

Is said to have answered; By Oyle without, and by Honey within.
               
               14 The Irish, especially the wilde-Irish, even at this day, live very long. Certainly, they report, that within these few yeares, the Countesse of Desmond lived to an hundred and forty yeares of Age, and bred Teeth three times. Now the Irish have a fashion, to chafe, and, as it were, to baste themselves with old Salt-butter, against the Fire.
               15 The same Irish, use to weare Saffroned Linnen, and Shirts; Which though it were, at first, devised to prevent Vermine, yet, howsoever, I take it, to be very usefull for Lengthening of Life: For Saffron, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   all Things that I know, is the best Thing for the Skin, and

the Comforting of the Flesh; Seeing it is both notably Astringent; And hath besides, an Oseosity, and subtile Heat, without any Acrimony. I remember a certaine EnglishMan, who, when he went to Sea, carried a Bagge of Saffron next his Stomach, that he might conceale it, and so escape Custome; And whereas he was wont to be alwayes exceeding Sea-sick; At that time he continued very well, and felt no provocation to vomit.
               16 Hippocrates adviseth, in Winter to weare cleane Linnen; And in Summer, fonle Linnen, and besmeared with Oyle: The Reason may seeme to be, because in Summer, the Spirits exhale most; Therefore, the Pores of the Skinne

would bee filled up.
               17 Hereupon wee are of Opinion, that the use of Oyle, either of Olives, or sweet Almonds, to annoint the skin therewith, would principally conduce, to long Life: The Annointing would bee done every Morning, when we rise out of Bed, with 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , in which a little Bay-salt, and Saffron, is mixed. But this Annointing must bee lightly done, 
                     〈◊〉
                   Wooll, or some soft Sponge, Not laying it on thick, but gently touching, and wetting the skin.
               18 It is certaine, that 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , even the Oyly themselves, in great Quantities, draw some what from the Body; But contrarily, in small Quantities, are drunk in by the Body; Therefore the annointing

would bee but Light, as we said; Or rather the 
                     〈◊〉
                   it selfe, would be besmeared with Oyle.
               19 It may haply bee objected, that this Annointing with Oyle, which wee commend; (Though it were never in use with us; And amongst the Italians is cast off againe;) was anciently very Familiar, amongst the Grecians, and Romans; And a part of their Diet; And yet Men were not longer-liv'd, in those dayes than now. But it may rightly be answered; Oyle was in use, only, after Baths; unlesse it were, perhaps, amongst Champions. Now Hot Baths, are as much contrarie to our Operation, as Annointings are congruous, Seeing the one opens the passages, the other

stops them up. Therefore the Bath, without the Annointing following, is utterly bad; The Annointing without the Bath, is best of all. Besides the Annointing amongst them, was used onely for Delicacie; Or, (if you take it at the best) for Health; But, by no meanes, in Order, to long Life. And therefore they used then withall precious Ointments; which were good for Deliciousnesse, but Hurtfull to our Intention, in regard of their Heat; So that 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   seemeth, not to have said amisse;

                     Nec Casiâ liquidi corrumpitur usus Olivi.
                  
               
               That Odoriferous Casia, 
                     〈◊〉
                   not supplanted the use of 
                     〈◊〉
                   Oyle-Olive.
               20 Annointing with Oyle, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
to Health; Both in Winter, by the Exclusion of the Cold Airc; And in Summer, by Detaining the spirits within; And prohibiting the Resolution of them; And keeping off the force of the Aire, which is then most predatorie.
               21 Seeing the Annointing with Oyle, is one of the most potent Operations to long Life; wee have thought good, to adde some Cautions, lest the Health should bee endangered. They are Foure, according to the Foure Inconvience, which may follow thereupon.
               22 The First Inconvenience is; That by repressing Sweats, it may engender Diseases, from those Excrementitious Humours. To this a Remeby

must be given, by Purges, and Clysters; That Evacuation may bee duely performed. This is certaine, that Evacuation by Sweats, commonly advanceth Health, and derogateth from long Life: But Gentle Purgers, work upon the Humours, not upon the Spirits, as Sweat doth.
               23 The Second 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   is; That it may heat the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  , in time, inflame it: For the Spirits shut in, and not Breathing forth, acquire Heat. This Inconvenience may 
                     〈◊〉
                   prevented; If the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   nsually, 
                     〈◊〉
                   to the Colder part; And that at times some proper Cooling 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   bee taken, of which, wee shall straight speak, in the Opertion upon the Bloud.
               
               24 The Third is, That it may

                  
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      the Head: For all 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   from without, strikes back the Vapours, and sends them up unto the Head: This Inconvenience is remedied, by Purgers; Especially, Clysters; And by shutting the Mouth of the Stomach, strongly, with Stipticks; And by Combing, and Rubbing the Head, and washing it with convenient Lyes, that something may exhale; And by not omitting, competent, and good Exercises, that something also may perspire, by the Skin.
               25 The Fourth Inconvenience, is a more subtile Evill; Namely, that the Spirit, being detained by the Closing up of the Pores, is likely to multiply it selfe too much: For when little issueth forth, and new Spirit is continually engendred,

the Spirit increaseth too fast, and so preyeth upon the Body more plentifully. But this is not altogether so; For all Spirit, closed up, is dull; (For it is Blowne, and Excited, with Motion, as Flame is;) And therefore, it is lesse Active, and lesse Generative of it selfe: Indeed, it is thereby increased in Heat, (as Flame is,) but slow in Motion: And therefore the Remedy to this Inconvenience, must be by Cold Things; Being sometimes mixed with Oyle; Such as are, Reses, and Myrtle: For wee must altogether disclaime Hot Things; As was said of Csia.
               
               26 Neither will it bee unprofitable, to weare next the Body, Garments, that have in them, some Vnctuosity, or Oleositie,
                  
not Aquositie; For they will exhaust the Body lesse: 
                     〈◊〉
                   are those of Woollen; rather than those of Linnen; 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   it is manifest in the Spirits of Odours; That if you lay sweet-powders amongst Linnen, they will much sooner lose their smell, than amongst Wollen. And therefore, Linnen is to be preferred, for Delicacie, and Neatnesse; But to bee 
                     〈◊〉
                   for our Operation.
               
               27 The Wilde Irish, as soone as they fall sick; The first Thing they doe, is to take the sheets off their Beds; and to wrap themselves in the woollen cloathes.
               28 Some report, that they have found great Benefit in the conservation of their Health, by weating Scarlet Wast-coats,
                  
next their skin, and under their shirts; As well downe to the nether parts, as on the upper.
               29 It is also to be observed; That Aire, accustomed to the Body, doth lesse prey upon it, than New Aire, and often changed. And therefore poore people, in small cottages, who live alwayes within the smell of the same chimney; And change not their seats; Are commonly longestliv'd: Notwithstanding, to other Operations, (especially for them whose Spirits are not altogether dull,) wee judge change of Aire to bee very profitable. But a Mean must be used, which may satisfie on both sides; This may bee done by Removing our Habitation, foure times a

yeare, at constant and set Times, unto convenient seats; That so the Body may neither be in too much Peregrination, nor in too much Station. And touching the Operation, upon the Exclusion of Aire, and Avoiding the predatorie force thereof, thus much.
            
         
         
            
            The Operation upon the Bloud, and the Sanguifying Heat. 3.
            
               The Historie.
               1 THe two Following Operations, answer to the two precedent; And are in the Relation of Passives to Actives: For the two precedent, intend this; That the Spirits, and Aire, in their Actions, may bee the lesse Depredatorie; And the two latter, that the Bloud, and Iuyce of the Body, may be the lesse Depredable. But because the Bloud is an Irrigation, or Watering, of the Juyces,

and Members; And a 
                     〈◊〉
                   to them; Therefore 
                     〈◊〉
                   will put the Operation upon the Bloud, in the first place. Concerning this Operation, we will propound certain Counsels; Few in number, but very powerfull in vertue. They are three.
               2 First, there is no doubt, but that if the Bloud be brought to a cold Temper, it will bee so much the lesse Dissipable. But because the Cold Things, which are taken by the Mouth, agree but ill, with many other Intentions; Therefore it will be best, to finde out some such Things, as may be free from these Inconveniences. They are two.
               3 The first is this. Let there be brought into use, especially in youth, Clysters; Not Purging
                  
at all, or Absterging; But onely Cooling, and some what Opening: Those are approved, which are made of the juyces of Lettuce, Purstaine, Liverwort, Houseleek, and the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   of the Seed of Flea-wort, with some temperate opening Decoction; And a little Canphire: But in the Declining Age, let the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , and Purslaine, beo left out; And the Juyces of Borrage, and 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , and the like, bee put in their Roomes: And let these Clysters be retained, if it may be, for an houre, or more.
               4 The other is this. Let there be in use, especially in Summer, Baths of Fresh water, and out Luke-warme; Altogether without Emollients; As Mallowes, Mercurie, Milk, and the like; Rather take new Whey,
                  
in some good Quantitie; And 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     .
               
               5 But, (that which is the Principall in this Intention, and New,) wee advise; That 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Bathing, the Body be 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   with Oyle, with some Thickeners; whereby the Qualitie of the Cooling may bee received, and the water excluded: yet let not the pores of the Body, bee shut too close; For when the outward Cold, closeth up the Body too strongly; It is so farre from Furthering Coolenesse; That it rather forbids it, and stirs up Heat.
               6 Like unto this, is the use of Blodders, with some Decoctions, and Cooling Iuyces; Applied to the Inferiour Region of the Body; Namely, from the Ribs, to the privie parts: For

this also is a kinde of Bathing where the Body of the Liquour is for the most part excluded; And the Cooling Qualitie admitted.
               7 The Third Counsell remaineth; which belongeth not to the Qualitie of the Bloud, but to the Substance thereof; That it may be made more Firme, and lesse Dissipable; And such, as the Heat of the Spirit, may have the lesse power over it.
               8 And as for the use, of the Filings of Gold, Leafe-Gold, Powder of Pearle, Precious stones, Corall, and the like; wee have no opinion of them, at this day; unlesse it be only, as they may satisfie this present operation. Certainly, seeing the Arabians, Grecians, and 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Physicians, have 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   such vertues to these Things; It cannot be altogether Nothing, which so great Men have observed of them. And therefore omitting all 
                     〈◊〉
                   Opinions about them, we doe verily beleeve; That if there could bee some such Thing conveighed into the whole Masse of the Bloud, in Minute, and fine Portions; Over which the Spirits, and Heat, should have little, or no power; Absolutely, it would not onely resist Putrefaction, but Arefaction also, And be a most effectuall Meanes, to the prolongation of Life. Neverthelesse, in this Thing, severall Cautions are to bee 
                     〈◊〉
                  . First, that there be a most 
                     〈◊〉
                   Comminution. Secondly, that such Hard and solide Things, be void of all Malignant

Qualitie; Lest while they be dispersed, and lurk in the veines, they breed some Inconvenience: Thirdly, that they be never taken together with Meats, nor in any such manner, as they may stick long; Lest they beget dangerous Obstructions, about the Mesentery: Lastly, that they be taken very rarely, that they may not congregate, and 
                     〈◊〉
                   together, in the veines.
               9 Therefore let the manner of Taking them, be Fasting; in White wine; A little Oyle of Almonds mingled therewith; Excrcise used immediately upon the Taking of them.
               10 The Simples, which may satisfie this Operation, are; In stead of all, Gold, Pearles, and Corall: For all Metals, except

                  Gold, are not without some Malignant Qualitie, in the Dissolutions of them; Neither will they bee beaten, to that exquisite Finenesse, that Leafe-Gold hath: As for all Glassie, and Transparent 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   wee like them not, (as wee said before,) for feare of Corrosion.
               11 But in our judgement, the 
                     〈◊〉
                  , and more effectuall way, would be, by the use of Woods, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   Infusions, and Decoctions; For there is in them sufficient, to cause Firmnesse of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; And not the like danger, for breeding Obstructions: But especially, because they may bee taken, in Meat, and Drink; whereby they will finde the more easie Entrance into the veines; And not be voided in Excrements.
               
                  
12 The Woods, fit for this purpose, are; Sanders, the Oake, and Vine: As for all Hot Woods, or something Rosennie, wee reject them: Notwithstanding, you may adde the Wooddy Stalks of Rose-Marie dried; For Rose-Marie is a Shrub, and exceedeth, in Age, many Trees: Also, the Wooddy Stalks of Ivie; But in such quantitie, as they may not yeeld an unpleasing taste.
               13 Let the Woods be taken, either boiled in Broathes; Or infused, in Must, or Ale, before they leave working: But in Broathes, (as the custome is, for Guaiacum, and the like,) they would be infused a good while, before the Boyling; That the firmer part of the Wood, and not that only which lieth loosely, may bee drawne

forth. As for Ash, though it be 
                     〈◊〉
                   for Cups, yet wee like it 
                     〈◊〉
                  . And touching the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   upon the Bloud, thus much.
            
         
         
            The Operation upon the Juyces of the Body. 4.
            
               The Historie.
               1 THere are two kindes of Bodies, (As was said before in the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , touching Inanimates) which are hardly consumed; Hard Things; and Fat Things; As is seene, in Metals, and Stones; and in Oyle, and Wax.
               
               2 It must be ordered therefore,

that the Iuyce of the Body, be somewhat Hard; And that it bee Fattie, or Sub-roscide
               
               3 As for Hardnesse; It is caused three wayes; By Aliment of a firme Nature; By Cold condensing the Skin, and Flesh; And by Exercise Binding, and Compacting, the Juyces of the Body, that they bee not Soft, and Frothy.
               4 As for the Nature of the Aliment, it ought to be such, as is not easily Dissipable: Such as are, Beefe, Swines-Flesh, Deere, Goat, Kid, Swan, Goose, Ring-Dove; Especially, if they bee a little powdered; Fish likewise Salted, and Dried; old Cheese; And the like.
               5 As for the Bread; Oaten Bread; Or Bread with some Mixture of Pease in it; 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈◊◊〉
                   Or Barley Bread; Are more solide, than Wheat 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   And in wheat Bread, the course Cheat Bread, is more solide, than the pure 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  
               
               6 The Inhabitants of the Or cades which live upon Salted Fish; And generally, all FishEaters, are long-liv'd.
               7 The Monks, and Her mites, which fed sparingly, and upon dry Aliment, attained commonly to a great Age.
               8 Also Pure Water, usually drunk, makes the Juyces of the Body lesse Frothy; unto which, if for the Dulnesse of the Spirit, (which, no doubt, in Water, is but little Penetrative;) you shall adde, a little Nitre, wee conceive it woold be very good. And touching

the Firmnesse of the Alimens thus much.
               9 As for the Condensation, of the Skin, and Flesh, by Cold: They are longer liv'd, for the most part, that live abroad in the open Aire, than they that live in Houses; And the Inhabitants of the Cold Countries, than the Inhabitants of the Hot.
               
               10 Great Store of Cloathes, either upon the Bed, or Back, doe resolve the Body.
               11 Washing the Body in Cold Water, is good for length of Life; Use of Hot Baths, is naught. Touching Baths, of Astringent Minerall Waters, we have spoken before.
               12 As for Exercise; An Idle Life, doth manifestly make the

Flesh Soft, and Dissipable: 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Exercise, (so it be, without overmuch Sweating, or Wearinesse,) maketh it Hard, and Compact: Also Exercise, within Cold water, as swimming, is very good: And generally, Exercise abroad, is better than that within Houses.
               13 Touching Frications, (which are a kinde of Exercise.) because they doe rather call forth the Aliment, than Harden the Flesh; wee will inquire hereafter, in the Due place.
               14 Having now spoken, of Hardning the luyees, of the Body; we are to come next to the Oleositie, or Fattinesse of them: Which is a more perfect, and potent Intention,

than Induration; Because it hath no Inconvenience, nor Evill annexed: For all those Things, which pertaine to the Hardning of the Iuyces, are of that nature, that while they prohibite the Absumption of the Aliment, they also hinder the Reparation of the same: Whereby it happens, that the same Things, are both propitious, and adverse, to Length of Life: But those Things, which pertaine to making the Iuyces Oyly, and Roscid, help on both sides; For they render the Aliment, both lesse Dissipable, and more Reparable.
               15 But whereas we say, that the Iuyce of thē 
                  Body, ought to be Roscide, and Fat; It is to bee noted, that we meane it not, of a visible Fat, But of a Deminesse
                  
dispersed, or (if you will call it) Radicall, in the very Substance of the Body.
               16 Neither, again, let any Man thinke, that Oyle, or the Fat of Meats, or Marrow, doe engender the like, and satisfie our Intention; For those Things, which are once perfect, are not brought backe againe; But the Aliments ought to be such, which after Disgestion and Maturation, doe then in the end, engender, Oleosity in the Iuyces.
               
               17 Neither, again, let any Man thinke; that Oyle, or Fat by it selfe, and Simple, is Hard of Dissipation; But, in Mixture, it doth not retaine the same Nature; For as Oyle, by it s lfe, is much longer in Consuming than Water; So in 
                     〈◊〉
                  , or 
                     〈◊〉
                  , it sticketh longer,

and is later dried; As we noted before.
               18 To the Irroration of the Body, Roasted Meats, or Baked Meats, are more effectuall than Boiled Meats: And all Preparation of Meat, with Water, is Inconvenient; Besides, Oyle, is more plentifully extracted out of Dry Bodies, than out of Moist bodies.
               19 Generally to the Irroration of the Body, much use of Sweet Things is prositable; As of Sugar, Honey, sweet Almonds, Pine-Apples, Pistaccio's, Dates, Raisins of the Sunne, Corrans, Figs, and the like. Contrarily, all Soure, and very Salt, and very Biting Things, are opposite to the Generation of Roscide Iuyce.
               
               20 Neither would wee bee thought to favour the Manichees,
                  
or their Diet; Though wee commend the frequent use of all kindes of Seeds, and 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   and Roots, in Meats, 
                     〈◊◊〉
                  ; Considering all Bread, (and Bread is that, which maketh the Meat Firme) is made either of Seeds, or of Roots.
               
               21 But there is Nothing makes so much to the Irroration of the Body, as the Quality of the Drinke; Which is the Convoy of the Meat: Therefore, let there be in use such Drinks, as without all Acrimony, or Sourenesse, are notwithstanding subtill; Such are those Wines, which are, (as the old Woman said in Plautus:) Vetustate Edentula; Toothlesse with Age; And Ale of the same kinde.
               22 Mead, (as wee suppose,)

would not bee ill, if it were strong and old: But because, all Hony hath in it some sharp Parts; (as appeares by that sharp water, which the Chymists extract out of it, which will dissolve Metals;) It were better to make the same Potion of Sugar; Not lightly infused in it, but so incorporated, as Honey useth to be in Mead; And to keepe it, to the Age of a yeare, or at least, six Moneths, whereby the Water may lose the Crudity, and the Sugar acquire subtiltie.
               23 Now Ancientnesse in Wine or Beere, hath this in it; That it engenders subtilty in the Parts of the Liquour, and Acrimony in the Spirits; Whereof, the First is Profitable, and the second Hurtfull:

Now to rectifie this Evill Commixture; Let there be put into the Vessell, before the Wine be separated from the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , Swines-flesh, or 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , well boyled; That the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   of the Wine may have whereupon to ruminate, and seed; And so lay aside their Mordacity.
               24 In like manner, if Ale should be made, not onely with the Graines of wheat, Barly, Oats, Pease, and the like; But also, should admit a part, (suppose a third part, to these Graines,) of some Fat Roots; (such as are Potado Roots, Pith of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , Burre-Roots, or some other sweet and Esculent Roots;) we suppose it would be a more usefull Drinke, for long Life, than Ale made of Graines only.
               
                  
25 Also, such Things as have very thin Parts; Yet not withstanding, are without all Acrimony, or Mordacity, Are very good in Sallets: Which vertue, we finde to be, in some Few of the Flowers; Namely, Flowers of Ivy, which infused in Vineger, are pleasant even to the Taste; Marigold leaves, which are used in Broaths; And Flowers of Betony. And touching the Operation, upon the Iuyces of the Body, thus much.
            
         
         
            
            The Operation upon the Bowels, for their Extrusion of Aliment. 5.
            
               The Historie.
               1 WHAT those Things are, which comfort the Principall Bowels; Which are the Fountaines of 
                     〈◊〉
                  ; Namely, the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , Liver, Heart and Brain; To performe their Functions well; (whereby Aliment is distributed in to the Parts, 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   are dispersed, and the

                   of the whole Body is accomplished;) May be derived from Physisians; And

from their Prescripts and Advices.
               2 Touching the Spleene, 
                        〈◊〉
                      Kidneyes, Mesentery, Guts, and Lungs, we speake not; For these are Members, Ministring to the Principall: And where as speech is made touching Health, they require sometimes a most especiall Consideration; Because Each of these have their Diseases, which unlesse they be cured, will have Influence upon the Principall Members; But as touching the Prolongation of Life; And Reparation by Aliments; And Retardation of the Inconcoction of Old
               
                  
3 And as for those Things, which according to the different State of every Mans Body, may bee transferred into his Diet, and the Regiment of his Life; He may collect them out of the Bookes of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   which have written of the Comforting and Preserving the Foure Principall 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   For Conservation of Health, hath commonly need of no more, than some Short Courses of Physicke; But Length of life cannot be hoped, without an orderly Diet, and a Constant Race of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Medicines: But we will propound some few; And

the House; And whose Strength and Goodnesse, 
                     〈◊〉
                   fundamentall to the other Concoctions;) ought so to be guarded and confirmed; That it may be without 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   Hot; Next Astricted or Bound, not Loose: Furthermore, Cleane, not surcharged with Foule Humours; And yet, (in regard, it is nourished from it selfe, not from the Veines,) not altogether Emptie, or Hungry: Lastly, it is to be kept, ever, in 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   Because Appetite; sharpens Disgestion.
               5 I wonder much, how that same 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      bibere. To drink 
                        〈◊〉
                      Drinke; (which was in use amongst the Ancients,) is laid downe againe. I knew a Physician, that was very Famous, who, in the Beginning

                  
                     〈◊〉
                   Dinner and Supper, would 
                     〈◊〉
                   eat a few spoonfuls of very Warm Broath, with much 
                     〈◊〉
                   And then would presently wish, that it were out againe; saying, He had no 
                        〈◊〉
                      of the Broath, but onely of the Warmth.
               
               6 We doe verily conceive it good, that the First Draught, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   of Wine, or Ale, or any other Drink, (to which a Man 
                     〈◊〉
                   most accustomed) be taken at Supper, Warme.
               
               7 Wine, in which Gold hath been quenched, we conceive, would be very good, once in a Meale: 
                     〈◊〉
                   that we 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Gold conferreth an Vertue thereunto; But that we know, that the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   of all Mettals, in any kinde of Liquour, doth leave a most potent Astriction: Now we

chuse gold, because besides that Astriction, which we desire, it leaveth nothing else behinde it, of a Metalline Impression.
               8 Wee are of opinion, that Sops of Bread dipped in Wine, taken at the Midst of the Meale, are Better than Wine it selfe; Especially, if there were infused into the Wine, in which the Sops were dipped, Rose-Mary, and Citron-Pill; And that with Sugar, that it may not Slip too fast.
               9 It is certaine, that the use of Quinces is good to strengthen the Stomach: But we take them to be better, if they be used, in that, which they call Quiddeny of Quinces, than in the Bodies of the Quinces themselves; Because they lie heavie in the Stomach. But those Quiddenies are best taken

after Meales, alone; 
                     〈◊〉
                   Meales, dipped in 
                     〈◊〉
                  
               
               10 Such things as are good for the Stomach, above other Simples, are these; Rose-Mary, 
                        〈◊〉
                     , Maslicke, 
                        〈◊〉
                     , Sage, Mint.
               
               11 Wee allow Pills of Aloes, Mastick, and Saffron, in Winter-time, taken before Dinner; But so as the Aloes be not only oftentimes washed in Rose-Water, but also in Vineger, in which Tragacanth hath been infused; And after that, be 
                     〈◊〉
                   for a few Houres, in Oyle of Sweet Almonds, new drawne, before it be made into Pills.
               
               12 Wine or Ale, wherein 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   hath been infused, with a 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Elecampane, and Yellow 
                        〈◊〉
                     , will doe well, taken

at times; And that especially in Winter.
               13 But in Summer, a Draught of White-wine, allayed with Strawberry-water; In which Wine, Powder of Pearles, and of the shells of Crey-fishes, exquisitely beaten; And (which may perhaps seeme strange;) a little Chalke have been infused; Doth excellently refresh and strengthen the Stomach.
               
               14 But generally, all Draughts in the Morning, (which are but too frequently used,) of Cooling Things; (As of Juyces, Decoctions, Whey, Barley-waters, and the like;) Are to be avoided; And Nothing is to be put into the Stomach, Fasting, which is purely Cold: These Things are better given, (if need require,) either at five in the afternone: of

else, an Houre, after a light Breakfast.
               15 Often Fastings are bad for Long Life; Besides, all Thirst 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   to be avoyded; And the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   is to be kept Cleane, 
                     〈◊〉
                   alwayes Moist.
               16 Oyle of Olives, new, and good; In which a little Mithridate hath been dissolved, 
                     〈◊〉
                   upon the Backbone, just against the Mouth of the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , doth wonderfully 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Stomach.
               
               17 A small Bagge filled with Locks of Scarlet Wooll, steeped in Red-wine; In which Myrtle, and Citron-Pill, and a little 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , have been infused, may be alwayes worne upon the Stomach, And, touching those Things which Comfort the Stomach, thus much; Seeing many of those Things also,

which serve for other Operations, are Helpfull to this.
               18 The Liver, if it bee Preserved from Torrefaction, or 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; And from Obstruction; It needeth no more: For that Loosenesse of it, which begers Aquosities, is plainly a Disease; But the other two, Old Age approaching induceth.
               19 Hereunto appertaine, most especially, those things which are set downe in the Operation, upon the Bloud: wee will adde a very few Things more, but those selected.
               20 Principally, let there be in use, the Wine of Sweet 
                        〈◊〉
                     ; Or if that cannot be had, the Iuyce of them, newly expressed; Let it be taken in the Morning, with a little Sugar:
                  
And into the Glasse, into which the Expression is made, put a small peece of Citronpill, greene; And three or foure whole Cloves: Let this be taken from February, till the end of April.
               
               21 Bring also into use, above all other Herbs, Water-cresses; But young, not old: They may be used, either Raw in Sallets, or in Broaths, or in Drinkes; And after that, take 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     -wort.
               
               22 Aloes, howsoever washed, or corrected, is hurtfull for the Liver; And therefore it is never to bee taken ordinarily: Contrariwise, Rhubarbe is Soveraigne for the Liver; So that these three Cautions be interposed. First, that it bee taken before Meat, lest it dry the Body too much, or leave

some Impressions of the Stipticitie thereof. Secondly, that it be macerated an Houre or two in Oyle of sweet Almonds, new drawne, with Rose-water, before it bee infused in Liquour, or given in the proper Substance. Thirdly, that it be taken by turnes, one while Simple, another while with Tartar, or a little Bay-Salt; That it carry not away the lighter Parts onely, and make the Masse of the Humour more obstinate.
               23 I allow Wine, or some Decoction, with Steele, to be taken three or foure times in the yeare, to open the more strong Obstructions; Yet so, that a Draught, of two or three spoonfuls of Oyle of sweet Almonds, new drawne, ever goe before; And the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ,
                  
of the Body, especially; of the Armes and sides, constantly follow.
               24 Sweetned Liquours, and that with some Fatnesse, are Principally, and not a little effectuall to prevent the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , and Saltnesse, and Torrefaction, and in a word, the Oldnesse of the Liver; Especially, if they be well incorporated with Age: They are made of sweet Fruits and Roots; As namely, the Wines, and Julips, of Raisins of the Sun, new; Iujuba's, Dried Figges, Dates, Parsnips, Potado's, and the like; with the mixture of Licorish, sometimes: Also a Julip, of the Indian Grain, (which they call Maiz,) with the Mixture of some sweet Things, doth much to the same end. But it is

to be noted, That the Intention of preserving the Liver, in a kinde of Softnesse and Fatnes, is much more powerfull, than that other, which Pertaines to the Opening of the Liver; which rather tendeth to Health, than to length of Life; Saving, that that obstruction, which induceth Torrefaction, is as opposite to long Life, as those other Arefactions.
               
               25 I commend the Roots of Snecory, Spinage, and Beets, cleared of their Piths, and Boiled, till they be tender, in Water, with a third part of whitewine, for ordinary Sallets, to be eaten with Oyle and Vinegar: Also Asparagus, Pith of Artichoakes, and Burre-Roots, boiled, and served in, after the same manner; Also Broaths,
                  
in the Spring-time, of Vine 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  , and the greene Blades of 
                        〈◊〉
                     . And touching the preserving of the Liver, thus much.
               26 The Heart receiveth Benefit, or Harme, most, from the Aire, which we breath; From Vapours; And from the Affections. Now many of those Things, which have been formerly spoken, touching the Spirits, may be transferred hither: But that Indigested Masse of Cordials, collected by Physicians, availes little to our Intention: Notwithstanding, those things, which are found to be good against Poysons, may, with good Judgment be given to strengthen and fortifie the Heart; Especially, if they be of that

kinde, that they doe not so much resist the particular poisons, as arme the Heart and Spirits against poison in generall. And touching the severall Cordials, you may repaire to the Table, alreadie set downe.
               27 The Goodnesse of the Aire, is better knowne by Experience, than by signes. We hold that Aire to be the best, where the Countrey is levell and plaine; And that layeth open on all sides: So that the Soile be dry, and yet not barren, or sandy: Which puts forth Wild Thime, and Eye-bright, and a kinde of Marioram, and here and there Stalks of Calamint: Which is not altogether void of wood but 
                     〈◊〉
                   set with some Trees, for shade: where the Sweet-Brier-Rose,
                  
smelleth something Muskie, and Aromatically; If there be Rivers, we suppose them rather 
                     〈◊〉
                   than good, unlesse they bee very small, and cleare, and Gravelly.
               28 It is certain, that the Morning Aire, is more Lively and Refreshing, than the Evening Aire; Though the latter bee preferred out of Delicacie.
               29 We conceive also, that the Aire, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   with a Gentle wind, is more wholesome than the Aire of a Serene and 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Skie: But the best is, the Wind blowing from the West in the Morning and from the North in the Afternoone.
               30 Odours, are especially profitable for the Comforting of the Heart; yet not so, as though a good Odour, were the Prerogative of a good

                  Aire: For it is certaine, that as there are some Pestilentiall Aires, which smell not so ill, as others that are lesse hurtful; So, on the Contrary, there are some Aires, most wholesome, and Friendly to the Spirits, which either smell not at all, or are lesse Pleasing, and Fragrant to the Sense. And generally, where the Aire is good, Odours should be taken but now and then: For a continuall Odour, though never so good, is burthensome to the Spirits.
               
               31 We commend above all others, (as wee have touched before) Odour of Plants growing, and not Plucked, taken in the open Aire; The Principall of that kinde are Violets; Gilly-Flowers, Finkes, Bean-Flowers, Lime-Tree-Blossomes, VineBuds,
                  
                  Hony-suckles, Yellow

                     , Musk-Roses; (For other Roses growing, are fast of theirSmels;) Strawberry-leaves, especially Dying; sweet Briar, principally in the early spring; Wilde-Mint, Lavender Flowred: And in the Hotter Countries, Orenge-Tree, Citron-Tree, Myrtle, Laurell: Therefore to walk, or sit, neare the Breath of these Plants, would not bee neglected.
               32 For the Comforting of the Heart, we preferre Coole smels, before Hot Smels: Therefore the best perfume is, either in the Morning, or about the Heat of the Day, to take an equall portion, of Vineger, Rose-water, and Claret Wine; And to poure them upon a Fire-pan, somewhat heated.
               
                  
33 Neither let us be thought; to sacrifice to our Mother, the Earth; Though wee advise, that in Digging, or Plowing the Earth, for health, a good quantitie of Claret Wine, be powred thereon.
               34 Orenge-Flower Water, pure and good, with a small portion of Rose-Water, and Brist Wine, snuffed up into the 
                     〈◊〉
                  ; Or put up into the Nosthrils, with a Syringe, after the Manner of an Errhine; (but not too frequently,) is very good.
               35 But Champing, (though wee have no Betel;) Or Holding in the Mouth only, of such Things as cheere the Spirits, (even daily done,) is exceeding comfortable. Therefore, for that purpose, make Grains, or little Cakes, of Ambre-Grise,
                  
                  Marke, Lignum Aloes, Lignum 
                        〈◊〉
                     , Orris powder, and 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; And let those Grains, or 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , be made up, with Rosewater, which hath passed through a little Indian Balsame.
               
               36 The Vapours, which arising from Things inwardly taken, doe fortifie, and cherish the Hart, ought to have these three properties; That they be Friendly, Cleare, and Cooling. For 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Vapours are Nought; And Wine it selfe, which is thought to have only an Heating Vapour, is not altogether void, of an opiate Qualitie. Now we call those Vapours: Cleare; which have more of the Vapour, than of the Exhalation; And which are not Smoakie, or Fu liginous, or Unctuous; But

Moist, and Equall.
               37 Out of that unprofitable Rabble of Cordials, a few ought to bee taken into daily Diet: In stead of all, Ambre. Grise, Saffron, and the Graine of Kermes, of the Hotter sort; Roots of Buglosse, and Borrage; Citrons, Sweet Limons, and Permaines, of the Colder sort. Also that way, which we said, Both Gold, and Pearles, work a good effect, not onely within the veines, but in their passage, and about the parts neare the heart; Namely, by Cooling, without any Malignant Qualitie.
               38 Of Bezoar Stone, we beleeve well, because of many Trials: But then, the Manner of Taking it, ought to bee such, as the vertue thereof, may more easily be communicated to

the Spirits. Therefore we approve not the Taking of it, in 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , or Syrrupes, or in Rosewater, or any such like; But only in Wine, Cynnamon-
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   or the like distilled water; But that, Weak, or Small, not Burning, or Strong.
               39 Of the Affections we have spoken before, we only adde this; That every Noble, and Resolute, and, (as they call it,) Heroicall Desire, strengtheneth, and enlargeth, the powers of the Heart; And, touching the Heart, thus much.
               40 As for the Braine; where the Seat, and Court of the Animall Spirits, is kept; Those Things, which were inquired before, touching Opium, and Niter, and the Subordinates to them Both; Also touching

the procuring of placide Sleepe, May likewise be referred hither. This also is most certaine; That the Braine is in some sort, in the Custody of the Stomach; And therefore those Things, which comfort, and strengthen the Stomach, doe help the Braine, by Consent; And may, no lesse, bee transferred hither. We will adde a few Observations; Three Outward, one Inward.
               41 We would have Bathing of the Feet, to be often used; At least, once in the week; And the Bath to be made, of Lye, with Bay-salt; And a little Sage, Camomile, Fennell, Sweet. Marioram, and Pepper-wort; With the Leaves of Angelica, green.
               42 We commend also, a Fume, or Suffumigation, every Morning

of dried Rose-Mary, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   dried, and Lignum 
                        〈◊〉
                     : For all Sweet Gums, oppresse the Head.
               43 Especially Care must bee taken, that no Hot Things, bee applied to the Head, outwardly; Such are kindes of Spices, the very Nutmeg not excepted: For those Hot Things, wee debase them, to the soales of the Feet, and would have them applied there onely: But a light annointing of the Head, with Oyle, mixed with Roses, 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   and a little Salt, and Saffron, we much commend.
               44 Not forgetting those Things, which wee have before delivered, touching Opiates, Nitre, and the like; which so much condense the Spirits; wee think it not impertinent

to that Effect; That once in fourteen dayes, Broath be taken in the Morning, with three, or foure, Graines of Castoreum, and a little 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Seed, and Calamus; Which both fortifie the Braine; And in that aforesaid Density, of the Substance, of the Spirits; (so necessarie to Long Life;) Adde also a Vivacitis of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   and Vigour, to them.
               45 In Handling, the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , of the foure Principall Bowels, wee have propounded those Things, which are both proper, and choice, and may safely, and conveniently, be transferred into Diet, and Regiment of Life: For Varietie of Medicines, is the Daughter of Ignorance; And it is not more true; That Many Dishes have caused many Diseases; As

the Proverb is; Then this is 
                     〈◊〉
                  , That Many Medicines have caused few Cures. And 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Operation, upon the principall Bowels, for their 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , of Aliment, thus much.
            
         
         
            The Operation upon the Outward Parts, for their Attraction of Aliment. 6.
            
               The Historie.
               1 ALthough a good Concoction, performed by the Inward Parts, bee the principall, towards a perfect Alimentation; yet the Actions, of the Outward Parts, ought also to concurre;

That like as the Inward Facultie, sendeth forth, and extrudeth the Aliment; So the Facultie of the Outward Parts, may call forth, and attract the same: And the more weake the Facultie of Concoction, shall be; The more need is there, of a Concurring Helpe, of the Attractive Facultie.
               
               2 A Strong Attraction, of the Outward Parts, is chiefly caused, by the Motion, of the Body; By which, the Parts being Heated, and Comforted; Doe more cheerfully, call forth, and attract, the Aliment, unto themselves.
               3 But this is most of all, to be foreseen, and avoided; That the same Motion, and 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , which cals the new Juyce to the Members; Doth not againe despoile the Member

of that Juyce, wherewith it had beene before refreshed.
               4 Frications, used in the Morning, serve especially, to this Intention; But this must evermore accompany them; That after the Frication, the Part be lightly annointed with Oyle; Left the Attrition, of the Outward Parts, make them by Perspiration, Dry, and Juycelesse.
               5 The next is Exercise, (by which the Parts confricate, and chafe themselves;) so it bee Moderate; And which, (as was noted before,) be not Swift, nor to the utmost Strength, nor unto wearinesse. But in Exercise, and in Frication, there is the same Reason, and Caution; That the Body, may not perspire, or 
                     〈◊〉
                  , too much: Therefore,

                  Exercise is better in the oper Aire, than in the House; And better in Winter, than in Summer: And againe, Exercise is not onely to be concluded with Vnction, as Frication is; But in vehement Exercises, Vnction is to bee used, both in the Beginning, and in the End; As it was anciently to Champions.
               
               6 That Exercise, may resolve, either the Spirits, or the Juyces, as little as may be, it is necessarie, that it be used, when the Stomach is not altogether Emptie. And therefore, that it may not bee used, upon full Stomach, (which doth much concerne Health;) Nor yet upon an Emptie Stomach, (which doth no lesse concerne Long Life;) It is best, to take a Breakfast in the

Morning; Not of any Physicall Drugs, or of any Liquours, or of Raisins, or of Figs, or the like; But of plaine Meat, and Drink; yet that very light, and in moderate Quantitie.
               7 Exercise, used for the Irrigation of the Members, ought to be Equall, to all the Members: Not, (as Socrates said,) that the Legs should move, and the Armes should rest; Or, on the contrarie; But that all the Parts may participate of the Motion. And it is altogether requisite to long Life, that the Body should never abide long in one posture, But that every halfe houre, at least, it change the posture; Saving only in Sleepe.
               8 Those Things, which are used to Mortification, may bee

transferred to Vivification: For both Haire Shirts, aud 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , and all vexations of the outward parts, doe fortifie the Attractive Force of them.
               9 Cardan commends Netling: Even to let out 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; But of this we have no Experience; And besides, we have no good opinion of it, lest through the venemous Qualitie of the Nettle, it may with often use, breed Itches, and other Diseases of the Skin. And touching the Operation, upon the Outward Parts, for their Attraction of Aliment, thus much.
            
         
         
            
            The Operation upon the Aliment it selfe; for the Insinuation thereof. 7.
            
               The Historie.
               1 THe vulgar Reproofe, touching many Dishes, doth rather become a severe Reformer, than a Physician; Or howsoever it may be good, for preservation of Health, yet it is Hurtfull to length of Life: By reason, that a various Mixture of Aliments, and somewhat Heterogeneous, findes a passage into the veines, and juyces of the Body, more lively and

cheerfully, than a Simple, and Homogeneous Diet doth: Besides, it is more Forcible, to stirre up Appetite; which is the Spur of Disgestion. Therefore we allow, both a Full Table, and a continuall changing of Dishes, according to the Seasons of the yeare, or upon other occasions.
               2 Also that Opinion, of the Simplicitie of Meats, without Sawces, is but a Simplicity of Judgement: For good, and well chosen, Sawces, are the most wholesome preparations of Meats; And conduce, both to Health, and to Long Life.
               3 It must bee ordered that with Meats, hard of Disgestion, be conjoyned, strong Liquours; And Sawces, that may penetrate, and make way; But

with Meats more easie of Disgestion, smaller Liquours, and Fat Sawces.
               
               4 Whereas wee advised before, that the first Draught at Supper, should bee taken warne; Now wee adde, that for the preparation of the Stomach, a good Draught of that Liquour, (to which every Man is most accustomed,) be taken warme, halfe an Houre before Meat also; But a little spiced, to please the Taste.
               5 The Preparation, of Meats, and Bread, and Drinks; That they bee rightly handled, and in order to this Intention; Is of exceeding great Moment; Howsoever it may seeme a Mechanicall Thing, and savouring of the Kitchin, and Buttrie: yet it is of more consequence, than those Fables,
                  
of Gold, and Precious Stones, and the like.
               6 The Moistning, of the Iuyces, of the Body, by a Moist preparation of the Aliments, is a childish Thing: It may be somewhat availeable against the Fervours of Diseases; But it is altogether adverse, to a Roscide Alimentation. Therefore, Boyling of Meats, as concerning our Intention, is farre inferiour, to Roasting, and Baking, and the like.
               7 Roasting ought to bee with a quick fire, and soone dispatched; Not with a dull Fire, and in long time.
               8 All Solide Fleshes, ought to be served in, not altogether Fresh, but somewhat powdered, or Corned: The lesse Salt may bee spent at the Table, with them, or none at all: For

                  Salt, incorporated with the Meat before, is better distributed in the Body, than eaten with it at the Table.
               9 There would bee brought into use severall and good 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , and Infusions of Meats, in convenient Liquours, before the Roasting of them; The like whereof are sometimes in use, before they bake them; And in the Pickles of some Fishes.
               
               10 But Beatings, and as it were Scourgings, of Flesh Meats, before they bee boiled, would work no small Matter. Wee see, it is confessed, that Pertridges, and Pheasants, killed with an Hawke; Also Bucks, and Stags, killed in Hunting; (If they stand not out too long,) eat better, even to the Tast. And some Fishes, Scourged,
                  
and Beaten, become more tender, and wholesome. Also Hard, and Sowre Peares, and some other Fruits, grow sweet with Rowling them. It were good to practise some such Beating, and Bruising, of the Harder kindes of Fleshes, before they bee brought to the Fire. And this would bee one of the best preparations of all.
               11 Bread, a little leavened, and very little salted, is best: And which is baked in an oven, thorowly heated, and not with a faint Heat.
               12 The Preparation of Drinks in order to long Life, shall not exceed one precept. And as touching Water Drinkers, wee have Nothing to say; Such a Diet, (as wee said before,) may prolong life to an Indifferent

Terme, but to no Eminent length: But in other Drinks, that are full of Spirit; (Such as are, wine, Ale, Mead, and the like,) This one Thing is to bee observed, and pursued, as the summe of all; That the parts of the Liquour, may bee exceeding Thin, and Subtile; And the Spirit, exceeding Mild: This is Hard to be done, by Age alone; For that makes the Parts a little more subtile; But the Spirits much more sharp, and eager: Therefore of the Infusion in the vessels, of some Fat Substance, which may restraine the Acrimonie of the Spirits, counsell hath beene given before: There is also another way, without Infusion, or Mixture: This is, That the Liquour might bee continually

                  agitated; Either by Carriage upon the water; Or by Carriage by Land; Or by Hanging the Vessels upon Lines, and daily stirring them; Or some such other way: For it is certaine; That this 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Motion, doth both subtilize the parts; And doth so Incorporate, and Compact the Spirits, with the parts; That they have no leisure to turne to sowrenesse, which is a kind of Putrefaction.
               
               13 But in extreme old Age, such a preparation of Meats, is to be made, as may be almost in the Middle-way to Chylus And touching the Distillations of Meats, they are meere Toyes; For the Nutritive part, at least the best of it doth not ascend in Vapours.
               
               14 The Incorporating of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  
                  
and Drink, before they meet in the Stomach, is a Degree to Chylus; Therefore let Chickens, or Pertridges, or 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , or the like, bee taken; And boiled in Water, with a little Salt; Then let them be cleansed, and dried; Afterward, let them be infused in Must, or Ale before it hath done working, with a little Sugar.
               
               15 Also, Gravies of Meat, and Mincings of them small, well seasoned; Are good for old Persons; And the rather, for that they are destituted of the Office of their Teeth, in chewing; which is a principall kinde of preparation.
               16 And as for the Helps of that Defect, (Namely, of the Strength of Teeth, to grinde the Meat,) There are three

Things, which may conduce thereunto. First, that New Teeth may put forth; That which seemes al together Difficult, and cannot bee accomplished, without an Inward, and powerfull Restauration of the Body. Secondly, that the Iawes be so confirmed by due Astringents, that they may in some sort supply the office of the Teeth; which may possibly bee effected. Thirdly, that the Meat bee so prepared that there shall be no need of chewing; which Remedy 
                     〈◊〉
                   ready, and at Hand.
               17 We have some Thought also, touching the Quantitie of the Meat, and Drinke; That the same taken in larger Quantitie, at some times, is good for the Irrigation of the Body. Therefore both Greas
                  
                  Feastings, and Free Drinkings, are not altogether to be inhibited. And touching the Operation upon the Aliments, and the Preparation of them, thus much.
            
         
         
            The Operation upon the Last Act of Assimilation. 8.
            TOuching the last Act of Assimilation, (unto which the three Operations, immediately preceding, chiefly tend) our Advice shall be briefe, and single. And the Thing it selfe, rather needs Explication, than any various Rules.
            1 IT is certaine, that all Bodies are endued with some Desire of

               Assimilating those things which are next them: Tuis the Rare, and Pneumaticall Bodies; As Flame, Spirit, Airt performe generously, and with Alacritie; On the contrary, those that carrie a Grosse, and Tangible Bulke about them; Doe but weakly: In regard, that the Desire, of Assimilating other Thing, is bound in, by a stronger Desire of Rest, and Containing themselves from Motion.
            
            2 Againe, it is certaine, That that Desire of Assimilating, being bound, as wee said, in a Grosse Body, and made 
                  〈◊〉
               ; Is somewhat freed, and stirred up, by the Heat, and Neighbouring Spirit; So that it is then Actuated: which is the onely cause, why Inanimates Assimilate
               
not, and Animates 
                     〈◊〉
                  .
            
            3 This also is certaine, That the Harder the Consistence of the Body is, the more doth that Body stand in need, of a Greater Heat, to prick forward the Assimilation: Which fals out ill for old Men; because in them the Parts are more Obstinate, and the Heat weaker: And therefore, either the Obstinacie of their Parts, is to be softned, or their Heat increased. And as touching the Malacissation, or Mollifying of the Members, we shall speak afterward; Having also formerly propounded many Things, which pertaine to the prohibiting, and preventing, of this kinde of Hardnesse. For the other, touching the Increasing of

the Heat, wee will now deliver a single precept; After wee have first assumed this Axiome.
            
            4 The Act of Assimilation, (which, as we said, is excited, by the Heat circumfused,) in a Motion exceeding Accurate, Subtile, and in Little. Now all such Motions doe then come to their Vigour, when the Locall Motion wholly ceaseth, which disturbeth it. For the Motion of Separation, into Homogeneall parts, which is in Milke; That the Creame should swim above, and the Whey sink to the bottome, will never work, if the Milk bee never so little agitated: Neither will any Puterfaction proceed in Water, or Mixt Bodies, if the same be in Continuall Local
               
               Motion. So then, from this Assumption, we will conclude this, for the present Inquisition.
            5 The Act it selfe, of Assimilation, is chiefly accomplished in Sleepe, and Rest; Especially, towards the Morning, the Distribution being finished: Therefore, we have nothing else to advise, but that Men keep Themselves Hot, in their Sleepe: And further, that towards the Morning, there be used some Annointing, or Shirt 
               
                  〈◊〉
                with Oyle, such as may gently stir up Heat; And after that, to fall asleep again. And touching the Last Act of Assimilation, thus much.
         
         
            
            The Operation upon the Inteneration of that, which begins to be Arified; Or the Malacissation of the Body. 9.
            WEe have inquired formerly, touching the Inteneration from within; 
                  〈◊〉
                is done by many Windings, 
                  〈◊〉
                Circuits, as well of 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  , as of Detaining the Spirit from Issuing forth; 
                  〈◊〉
                therefore is accomplished Slowly. Now we are to inquire, touching that Inteneration, which is

                without; And is effected, as 
                  〈◊〉
                were, Suddenly; Or, touching

the Malacissation, and 
                  〈◊〉
                of the Body.
            
            
               The Historie.
               1 IN the Fable, of Restoring Pelias to Youth againe; Medea, when the Faigned to doe it, 
                     〈◊〉
                   this way, of 
                     〈◊〉
                   the same, That the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Mans Body should be cut into severall Peeces; And 
                     〈◊〉
                   Boyled in a Cauldron, with certaine Medicaments. There may, perhaps, some 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   bee required to this Matter; But the Cutting into 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , is not needfull.
               2 Notwithstanding, this Cuting into Peeces, seemes, in some sort, to be usefull; Not 
                     〈◊〉
                   a Knife, but with Judgement. For whereas the Consistence
                  
of the Bowels, and 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   is very divers; It is needfull that the Inteneration of them both, be not effected the same way; But that there be a Cure designed of each in particular, Besides those Things, which pertaine to the Inteneration, of the whole Masse of the Bodie; Of which, notwithstanding, in the first place.
               3 This Operation, (if perhaps it bee within our power,) is most likely to bee done, by Baths, Vnctions, and the like: Concerning which, these Things that follow, are to be observed.
               4 We must not be too forward in Hoping to Accomplish this matter from the Examples of those Things which we see done, in the Imbibitions, and Macerations of Inanimates:
                  
By which they are intenerated: whereof we introduced some Instances before: For this kinde of Operation, is more Easie upon Inanimates, Because they attract, and suck in the Liquour. But upon the Bodies of Living Creatures it is Harder; Because, in them, the Motion rather tendeth outward, and to the Circumference.
               
               5 Therefore, the Emollient Baths, which are in use, doe little good, but on the contrary, hurt; Because they rather draw forth, than make entrance; And resolve the Structure of the Body, rather than consolidate it.
               6 The Baths, and Vnctions, which may serve to the present Operation; (Namely, of Intenerating the Body, truly

and really,) ought to have three properties.
               7 The First and Principall, is; That they consist of those Things, which in their Whole Substance, are Like unto the Body, and Flesh of Man; And which have a Feeding, and Nursing Vertue, from without.
               8 The Second, is; That they be mixed with such Things, as through the Subtilty of their Parts, may Make Entrance; And so insinuate, and conveigh their Nourishing Vertue, into the Body.
               
               9 The Third, is; That they receive some Mixture (though much inferiour to the rest,) of such Things as are Astringent; I meane, not Sowre or Tart Things; But Unctuous, and Comforting; That while the

other two do operate, the 
                     〈◊〉
                   out of the Body, which destroyeth the Vertue of the Things Intenerating, may (as much as is possible,) be prohibited; And the Motion to the Inward Parts, by the Astriction of the Skin, and Closing of the Passages, may be promoted and furthered.
               10 That which is most Consubstantiall, to the Body of Man, is Warme Bloud, either of Man, or of some other living Creature: But the Device of Ficinus; Touching the Sucking of Bloud out of the Arme of a wholesome young Man; For the Restauration of Strength in Old men; is very Frivolous; For that, which nourisheth from within, ought no way to be Equall, or Homogeneall to the Body nourished;

But in some sort, Inferiour, and Subordinate, that it may be converted: But in Things applyed outwardly, by how much the Substance is Liker, by so much the Consent is better.
               11 It hath been anciently received; That a Bath made of the Bloud of Infants will cure the Leprosie, and heale the Flesh already putrified: Insomuch, that this Thing hath begot Envie towards some Kings, from the Common people.
               12 It is reported, that Heraditus, for cure of the Dropsie, was put into the Warme Belly of an Oxe, newly slaine.
               13 They use the Bloud of Kitlins, warme; To cure the Disease called Saint Anthonies Fire; And to restore the Flesh and Skin.
               
                  
14 An Arme, or other Member, newly cut off; Or that, upon some other Occasion, will not leave Bleeding; Is, with good successe, put into the Belly of some Creature, Newly ripped up; For it worketh potently, to Stanch the Bloud; The Bloud of the Member cut off, by consent sucking in, and vehemently drawing to it selfe, the Warme Bloud of the Creature Slaine; whereby it selfe is Stopped, and retireth.
               15 It is much used in Extreme and Desperate Diseases, to cut in two young Pigeons, yet Living, and to apply them to the Soles of the Feet, and to shift them one after another; whereby, sometime 
                     〈◊〉
                   followeth a wonderful case. This is imputed vulgarly, as if they

should draw downe the Malignitie of the Disease; But howsoever, this Application goeth to the Head, and comforteth the Animal Spirits.
               
               16 But these Bloudy Baths and Vnctions, seeme to us Sluttish and Odious; Let us search out some others, which perhaps have lesse loathsomenesse in them, and yet not lesse Benefit.
               17 Next unto Warme-Bloud, Things alike in Substance, to the Body of Man, are, Nutritives; Fat Fleshes; Of Oxen, Swine, Deere: Oisters amongst Fishes; Milke, Butter, Yolkes 
                        〈◊〉
                      Egs: Floure of Wheat, Sweet Wine: Either Sugred, or 
                     〈◊〉
                   it be fined.
               18 Such Things as wee would 
                     〈◊〉
                   mixed, to make 
                     〈◊〉
                  , are; In stead of all, 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  
                  
Especially, Bay-salt; Also Wine, (when it is full of Spirit,) maketh Entrance; And is an excellent Convoy.
               19 Astringents of that Kinde, which we described; Namely, Vnctuous, and Comfortable Things, are; Saffron, Mastick, Myrrhe, and Myrtle-Berries.
               
               20 Of these Parts, in our judgement, may very well be made such a Bath, as wee designe: Physicians, and Posteritie, will finde out better Things hereafter.
               21 But the Operation will bee much better &amp; more powerfull; If such a Bath, as we have propounded, (which we hold to be the Principall Matter,) beattended with a Foure-fold Course and Crder.
               
               22 First, that there goe before the Bath, a Frication of the Bodie;

And an Annointing with Oyle, with some Thickning Substance: That the Vertue, and Moistning Heat of the Bath, may pierce the Body, and not the watry Part of the Liquour. Then let the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   follow, for the space of some two Houres: After the Bath, let the Body bee Emplaistrea with Mastick, Myrrhe, Tragacanth, Diapalma, and Saffron; That the Perspiration of the Body, may (as much as is possible,) be inhibited; Till the Supple Matter be by degrees turned into Solide: This to be continued, for the space of twenty foure houres, or more Lastly, the Emplaistring being removed, let there be an Annointing with Oyle, 
                     〈◊〉
                   with Salt, and Saffron. 
                     〈◊〉
                   let this Bath, together 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
the Emplaistring and Vnction, (as before,) be renewed every Fifth day: This Malacissation, or Suppling of the Body, to be continued for one whole Moneth.
               23 Also during the Time of this Malacissation, we hold it usefull, and proper, and according to our Intention; That Men nourish their Bodies well, and keep out of the Cold Aire; And drink nothing, but Warme Drinke.
               
               24 Now this is one of those Things, (as wee warned, in generall, in the beginning,) whereof wee have made no Triall by Experiment; But only set it downe, out of our Aiming and Levelling at the End. For having Set up the Marke, we deliver the Light to others.
               
                  
25 Neither ought the Warmths and Cherishings of Living Bodies, to bee neglected. Ficinus saith, and that seriously enough; That the laying of the young Maid in Davids Bosome, was wholesome for him, but it came too late. He should also have added; That the Young Maid, after the manner of the Persian Virgins, ought to have been annointed with Myrrhe, and such like; Not for Deliciousnesse, but to increase the Vertue of this Cherishing by a living Body.
               26 Barbarossa, in his extreme old Age, by the advice of a Physician, a Iew, did continually apply Young Boyes, to his Stomach and Belly, for Warmth and Cherishing: Also some Old Men, lay Wholps, (Creatures of the Hottest

Kind,) close to their Stomachs, every Night.
               There hath gone a report, almost undoubted; And that under several Names; Of certaine Men that had great Noses; who being weary of the Derision of People, have cut off the Bunches, or Hillocks of their Noses; And then making a wide Gash in their Armes, have bold their Noses in the place, for a certain time; And so brought forth faire and comely Noses: Which if it be true, it shewes plainly, the Consent of Flesh unto Flesh, especially in Live Fleshes.
               
               28 Touching the Particular Inteneration, of the Principall Bowels; The Stomach, Lungs, Liver, Heart, Braine, Marrow of the Backbone, Guts, Reines, Gall, Veines, Arteries, Nerves, Cartilages,

                  Bones; The Inquisition and Direction, would bee too long; Seeing we now set not forth a Practique; But certain Indications to the Practique.
               
            
         
         
            The Operation upon the Purging away of old Iuyce, and Supplying of new Iuyce; Or of Renovation by Turnes. 10.
            
               The Historie.
               ALTHOUGH those Things, which wee shall here set downe, have been, for the most part, spoken of before; yet because

this Operation, is one of the Principall, wee will handle them over againe, more at large.
               1 It is certaine, that Draught Oxen, which have been worne out with working, being put into Fresh and Rich Pastures, will gather tender and young Flesh againe; And this will appeare, even to the Taste and Palate; So that the Inteneration of Flesh, is no hard Matter. Now it is likely, that this Inteneration of the Flesh, being often repeated, will in time, reach to the Inteneration of the Bones and Membranes, and like Parts of the Body.
               
               2 It is certaine, that Diets which are now much in 
                     〈◊〉
                   Principally of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   And of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , China and 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   If they be continued

for any time, and according to strict Rules; Doe first Attenuate the whole Iuyce of the Body; And after Consume it, and Drinke it up. Which is most manifest, because that by these Diets, the French Pox, when it is growne even to an Hardnesse; And hath eaten up, and corrupted, the very Marrow of the Body; may be assuredly cured. And further, because it is as manifest, that Men, who by these Diets, are brought to be extreme Leane, Pale, and as it were, Ghosts; Will soone after become Fat, well-coloured, and apparantly Young againe. Wherefore, we are absolutely of opinion, 
                     〈◊〉
                   such kind of Diets, in the 
                     〈◊〉
                   of Age, being used every 
                     〈◊〉
                   yeare, would bee very useful to our Intention;
                  
Like the old Skin, or Spoile of Sarpents.
               
               3 Wee doe confidently affirme; (neither let any Man reckon us amongst those Heretikes, which were called Cathari;) That often Purges, and made even Familiar to the Body, are more availeable to long Life, than Exercises and Sweats. And this must needs be so, if that be held, which is already laid for a Ground; That Vnctions of the Body; And Oppletion of the Passages from without; And Exclusion of Aire; And Detaining of the Spirit, within the Masse of the Body; Doe much conduce to long Life. For it is most certaine, that by Sweats, and Outward Perspirations; not onely the Humours, and excrementitious Vapours are Exhaled

and consumed; But together with them, the Juices also, and good Spirits, which are not so easily repaired; But in 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , (unlesse they be very Immoderate,) it is not so; Seeing they worke 
                     〈◊〉
                   upon the Humours. But the best Purges for this Intention, are those, which are taken immediately before 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; Because they Dry the Body lesse; And therefore, they must be of those Purgers, which doe least trouble the Belly.
               
               
                  These Intentions, of the Operations, which wee have Propounded, (as we conceive,) are most true; The Remedies Faithfull to the 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      is it credible to 
                        〈◊◊〉
                      (Although not a Few of these Remedies may seeme but 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  
                  
with what Care, and Choice, they have beene examined by us; That they might be (the Intention not at all empeached) both Safe, and Effectuall. Experience, no doubt, will both verifie, and promote, these Matters. And such, in all things, are the works of every prudent Counsell; That they are Admirable in their Effects, Excellent also in their Order, but seeming vulgar in the Way and Meanes.
               
            
         
         
            The Proches of Death.
            WE are now to inquire To the 15. Article. touching the Porches of Death; That is, Touching those Things, which happen unto Men, at the point of Death; Both a little before, and after.

That seeing there are many Paths, which lead to Death, it may be under stood, in what Common-way, they all end; Especially, in those Deaths, which are caused by Indigence of Nature, rather than by violence; Although something of this Latter also, must be inserted, because of the Connexion of Things.
            
               The Historie.
               1 THe Living Spirit, stands in need of three Things, that it may subsist: Convenient Motion; Temperate Refrigeration; And Fit Aliment. Plame seemes to stand in need, but of two of these; Namely, Motion, and Aliment: Because Flame is a simple substance, the Spirit a Compounded:

Insomuch, that if it approach somewhat too neare to a Flamie Nature, it overthroweth it selfe.
               2 Also Flame, by a greater, and stronger Flame, is extinguished, and slaine; As Aristotle well noted; Much more the Spirit.
               
               3 Flame, if it be much compressed, and straitned, is extinguished; As wee may see in a Candle, having a Glasse cast over it; For the Aire being dilated by the Heat, doth contrude, and thrust together the Flame; And so lesseneth it, and in the end extinguisheth it: And Fires on Hearths will not Flame, if the Fewell bee thrust close together, without any space for the Flame to break forth.
               4 Also Things Fircd, are extinguished

with Compression; As if you presse a Burning Coale hard with the Tongs, or the Foot, it is straight extinguished.
               5 But to come to the Spirit; If Bloud, or Flegme, get into the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   of the Braine, it causeth sudden Death; Because the Spirit hath no Roome to move it selfe.
               6 Also a great Blow on the Head, induceth sudden Death; The Spirits being straightened within the Ventrides of the Braine.
               
               7 Opium, and other strong 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     , doe coagulate the Spirit; And deprive it of the Motion.
               8 A Venemous Vapour, totally abhorred by the Spirit, causeth sudden Death: As in deadly poisons, which worke

(as they call it,) by a Specificall Malignity: For they strike a Loathing into the Spirit, that the Spirit will no more move it selfe, nor rise against a Thing so much Detested.
               9 Also Extreme Drunkennesse, or Extreme Feeding, sometime cause sudden Death: Seeing the Spirit is not only Oppressed with overmuch Condensing, or the Malignity of the Vapour; (As in Opium, and Malignant Poysons;) But also with the Abundance of the Vapours.
               
               10 Extreme Griefe, or Feare, Especially, if they be sudden; (As it is in a sad and unexpected 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                  ) cause sudden Death.
               
               11 Not only over-much Compression, but also over-much Dilatation of the Spirit, is Deadly.
               
                  
12 Ioyes excessive, and sudden, have berest many of their lives.
               13 In great Evacuations; As when they cut Men for the Dropsie, the waters flow forth abundantly; Much more in great and sudden Fluxes of Bloud oftentimes, present Death followeth: And this happens by the meere Flight of Vacuum, within the Body; All the parts moving, to fill the Emptie places; And amongst the rest, the Spirits themselves. For as for slow Fluxes of Bloud, this Matter pertaines to the Indigence of Nourishment, not to the Diffusion of the Spirits. And touching the Motion of the Spirit, so farre, either Compressed, of Diffused, that it bringeth Death, thus much.
               
                  
14 We must come next to the Want of Refrigeration. Stopping of the Breath, causeth sudden Death; As in all Suffocation, or Strangling. Now it seemes this Matter is not so much to be referred to the Impediment of Motion, as to the Impediment of Refrigeration: For Aire over-hot, though attracted freely, doth no lesse Suffocate, than if Breathing were hindred: As it is in them, who have beene sometime suffocated, with Burning Coales; Or with Char-coale, Or with Wals newly plaistered, in close chambers, where a Fire is made: which kind of Death, is reported, to have beene the end of the Emperour Iovinian: The like happeneth from Dry Baths, over-heated, which was practised in the killing of

                  Fausta, wife to Constantine the Great.
               
               15 It is a very small Time, which Nature taketh, to repeat the Breathing; And in which she desireth, to expell the Foggie Aire, drawne into the Lungs, and to take in new; Scarce, the third part, of a Minute.
               16 Againe, the Beating of the Pulse; And the Motion, of the Systole, and Diastole, of the Heart; are three times quicker, than that of Breathing; Insomuch, that if it were possible, that that Motion of the Heart could be stopped, without stopping the Breath; Death would follow more speedily thereupon, than by Strangling.
               
               17 Notwithstanding, Vse and Custome prevaile much in this

Naturall Action of Breathing; As it is in the Delian Divers, and Fishers for Pearle; who by long use can hold their Breaths, at least ten times longer, than other Men can doe.
               18 Amongst Living Creatures even of those, that have Lungs, there are some that are able to hold their Breaths a long time, and others that cannot hold them so long; According as they need, more, or lesse, Refrigeration.
               19 Fishes need lesse Refrigeration, than Terrestriall Creatures; yet some they need, and take it by their Gils: And as Terrestriall Creatures, cannot beare the Aire, that is too Hot, or too Close; So Fishes are suffocated in waters, if they be totally, and long Frozen.
               
                  
20 If the Spirit be assaulted by another Heat, greater than it selfe, it is dissipated, and destroyed. For if it cannot beare the proper Heat without Refrigeration, much lesse can it beare another Heat, which is farre stronger. This is to bee seene in Burning Fevers, where the Heat of the Putrified Humours, doth exceed the Native Heat; Even to Extinction, or Dissipation.
               21 The Want also, and Use of Sleepe, is referred to Refrigeration. For Motion doth attenuate, and 
                     〈◊〉
                   the Spirit; And doth sharpen, and increase the Heat thereof; Contrarily, Sleepe settleth, and restraineth the Motion, and Gadding of the same. 
                     〈◊〉
                   though Sleepe doth strengthen and advance, the Actions 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
the Parts, and of the livelesse Spirits; and all that Motion, which is to the Circumference of the Body; yet it doth in great part, quiet, and still the proper Motion of the Living Spirit. Now Sleepe, regularly, is due unto Humane Nature, once within Foure and Twentie Houres; And that for Six, or Five Houres, at the least: Though there are, even in this kinde, sometimes Miracles of Nature; As it is recorded of Mecaenas, that he slept not, for a long time, before his Death. And as touching the Want of Refrigeration, for Conserving of the Spirit, thus much.
               22 As concerning the third Indigence; Namely, of Aliment; It seemes to pertaine

rather to the Parts, than to the Living Spirit. For a Man may easily beleeve, that the Living Spirit 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   in Identitie Not by succestion, or Renovation. And as for the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Soule in Man, it is above all question; That it is no engendred of the Soule of the Parents; Nor is repaired; Nor can dye. They speake of the Naturall Spirit of living Creatutes; And also of Vegetables, which differs from that other Soule, essentially, and formally. For out of the Confusion of these, that same Transmigration of Soules, and Innumerable other Devices, of Heathens and Hereticks, have proceeded.
               23 The Body of Man, doth regularly require; Renovation by Aliment, every day. And

                  Body in Health, can scarce endure Fasting, three dayes together; Notwithstanding, Use, and Custome, will doe much, even in this Case; But in Sicknesse, Fasting is lesse grievous to the Body. Also Sleepe doth supply somewhat to Nourishment; And, on the other side, Exercise doth require it more abundantly. Likewise there have some beene found, who have susteined themselves, (almost to a Miracle in Nature,) a very long time, without Meat or Drink.
               24 Dead Bodies, if they bee not intercepted by Putrefaction, will subsist a long time, without any Notable Absumption; But Living Bodies, not above three dayes, (as wee said,) unlesse they be repaired by Nourishment:

rishment: which sheweth, that quick Absumption, to bee the work of the Living Spirit; which either repaires it selfe; or puts the Parts into a Necessitie, of being repaired; Or both. This is testified, by that also, which was noted a little before; Namely, that Living Creatures may subsist somewhat the longer, without Aliment, if they Sleepe. Now Sleepe is Nothing else, but a Reception, and Retirement, of the Living Spirit, into it selfe.
               25 An abundant, and continuall, Effluxion of Bloud; which sometimes happeneth in the Hemorrhoides; sometimes in Vomiting of Bloud, the Inward Veines being unlocked, broken, sometimes by Wounds; Causeth sudden Death; In regard, that the

                  Bloud of the Veines ministreth to the Arteries; And the Bloud of the Arteries, to the Spirit.
               
               26 The Quantitie of Meat and Drink, which a Man, eating two Meales a day, receiveth into his Body, is not small; Much more, than he voideth againe, either by Stoole, or by Urine, or by Sweating: You will say; No marvell; Seeing the Remainder goeth into the Juyces, and Substance, of the Body: It is true; But consider then, that this Addition is made twice a day, and yet the Body aboundeth not much: In like manner, though the Spirit be repaired, yet it growes not, Excessively, in the Quantitie.
               
               27 It doth no good, to have

the Aliment ready, in a Degree removed; But to have it of that Kinde; And so prepared, and supplied, that the Spirit may work upon it: For the Staff of a Torch alone, will not maintaine the Flame, unlesse it be fed with wax: Neither can Men live upon Herbs alone. And from thence comes the Inconcoction of old Age; That though there bee Flesh, and Bloud; yet the Spirit is become so Penurious, and Thin; And the Juyces, and Bloud, so Heartlesse, and Obstinate, that they hold no proportion, to Alimentation.
               
               28 Let us now cast up the Accounts, of the Needs, and Indigences, according to the Ordinarie, and Usuall Course of Nature: The Spirit hath

need, of Opening, and Moving it selfe, in the Ventricles of the Braine, and Nerves, even continually; Of the Motion of the Heart, every Third part, of a Moment; Of Breathing, every Moment; Of Sleepe, and Nourishment, once within three Dayes; Of the Power of Nourishing, commonly till Eighty yeares bee past. And if any of these Indigences bee neglected, Death ensueth. So there are plainly three Porches of Death; Destitution of the Spirit; In the Motion; In the Refrigeration; In the Aliment.
               
               It is an Errour, to think, that the Living Spirit, is perpetually generated, and extinguished, as Flame is; And abideth not any notable time. For even Flame it selfe is not thus, out of

his owne proper Nature; But because it liveth amongst Enemies. For Flame, within Flame, endureth. Now the Living Spirit, liveth amongst Friends, and all due Obsequiousnesse. So then, as Flame is a Momentany Substance; Aire a Fixed Substance; The Living Spirit is betwixt both.
               Touching the Extinguishing of the Spirit, by the Destruction of the Organs, (which is caused by Diseases, and Violence,) 
                     〈◊〉
                   inquire not now; As wee foretold in the Beginning; Although that also endeth in the same three Porches. And touching the Forme of Death it selfe, thus much.
               29 There are two great Forerunners of Death; The one sent from the Head, the other from the Heart; 
                        〈◊〉
                     ,
                  
and the Extreme Labour of the Pulse. For as for the Deadly Hiccough, it is a Kinde of 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     . But the Deadly Labour of the Pulse, hath that unusuall Swiftnesse; Because the Heart, at the point of Death, doth so tremble, that the Systole, and Diastole, thereof, are almost consounded. There is also conjoyned in the Pulse, aweaknesse, and Lownesse, and oftentimes a great Intermission; Because the Motion of the Heart faileth; And is not able to rise against the Assault, stoutly, or constantly.
               30 The Immediate preceding Signes of Death, are; Great Vnquietnesse, and Tossing in the Bed; Fumbling with the Hands; Catching, and Grasping hard; Gnashing with the Teeth;
                  
                  Speaking hollow; Trembling of the Neather Lip; Palenesse of the Face; The Memory confused; Speechlesnesse; Cold Sweats; The Body shooting in Length; Lifting up the White of the Eye; Changing of the whole Visage; (As, the Nose sharp, Eyes Hollow, Cheekes fallen;) Contraction, and Doubling of the Tongue, Coldnesse in the Extreme Parts of the Body; In some, shedding of Bloud, or Sperme; Shriking; Breathing thick, and short; Falling of the Neather Chap; And such like.
               31 There follow Death; A Privation, of all Sense, and Motion; As well of the Heart, and Arteries; As of the Nerves, and Joynts; An Inability of the Body, to support it selfe uprigh; Stifnesse of the Nerves,
                  
and Parts; Extreme Coldnesse of the whole Body; After a little while, Patrefaction, and Stinking.
               
               32 Eeles, Serpents, and the Insecta, will move a long time, in every part, after they are cut asunder; Insomuch, that Countrey People think, that the Parts strive to joyne together againe. Also Birds will flutter a great while, after their Heads are pulled off: And the Hearts of Living Creatures will pant a long time, after they are plucked out. I remember, I have seene the Heart of one that was bowelled; As suffering for High Treason; That being cast into the Fire, leaped, at the first, at least, a Foot and Halfe in Heighth; And after, by degrees, lower and lower; For the space, as we rememher

ber, of seven, or eight Minutes. There is also an ancient, and credible Tradition, of an Oxe Lowing, after the 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   were plucked out. But there is a more certaine Tradition, of a Man; who being under the Executioners Hand, for High Treason; After his Heart was plucked out, and in the Executioners Hand; Was heard to utter, three or foure words of Prayer: which therefore, we said to be more credible, than that of the Oxe in Sacrifice; Because the Friends of the partie suffering, do usually give a Reward to the Executioner; To dispatch his Office with the more speed; That they may the sooner bee rid of their Paine; But in Sacrifices, wee see no Cause, why the Priest should bee so

speedy in his Office.
               33 For Reviving those againe, which fall into sudden Swownings, and Catalepses, or Astonishments: (In which Fits, many, without present Help, would utterly expire;) These Things are used; Putting into their Mouths, water, distilled of Wine, which they call Hot Waters, and Cordiall Waters; Bending the Body Forwards; Stopping the Mouth, and Nosthrils, hard; Bending, or Wringing the Fingers; Pulling the Haires, of the Beard, or Head; Rubbing of the Parts, especially, the Face, and Legs; sudden Casting of Cold Water upon the Face; shreeking out aloud, and suddenly; Putting Rose-water, to the Nosthrils, with Vinegar, in Faintings; Burning of Feathers, or Cloth, in the Suffocation
                  
of the Mother; But especially, a Frying Pan, heated red hot, is good in Apoplexies; Also a Close Embracing of the Body, hath helped some.
               There have beene many Examples of Men, in shew, Dead; Either laid out upon the Cold Floare; Or carried sorth to 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     ; Nay, of some Buried in the Earth; which notwithstanding have lived againe; which hath beene found, in those that were buried; (The Earth being afterwards opened,) By the Bruising, and Wounding of their Head, through the strugling of the Body, within the Coffin: Whereof the most Recent, and Memorable Example, was that of Ioannes Scotus, Called the Subtile, and a Schooleman, who being digged up

againe by his Servant, unfortunately absent at his Buriall; (And who knew his Masters Manner in such Fits;) Was found in that State. And the like happended in our Dayes, in the Person of a Player, buried at Cambridge. I remember to have heard of a certaine Gentleman; That would needs make Triall, in Curiositie, what men did feele that were hanged; So hee fastened the Cord about his Necke, raising himselfe upon a Stoole, and then letting himselfe fall; Thinking it should bee in his power, to recover the Stoole at his pleasure; which he failed in; But was helped by a Friend, then present. He was asked afterward, what he felt? He said; Hee felt no paine; But first, he thought, he saw

before his Eyes, a great Fire, and Burning; Then hee thought, he saw all Black, and Darke: Lastly, it turned to a pale Blew, or Sea-waterGreene; which Colour is also often seene by them which fall into Snownings. I have heard also, of a Physician, yet Living; Who recovered a Man to Life, which had hanged Himselfe; And had hanged halfe an Houre; By Frications, and Hot Baths: And the same Physician did professe, that he made no doubt, to recover any Man, that had hanged so long, so his Neck were not broken with the first Swing.
            
         
         
            
            The Differences of Youth, and Old Age.
            1 THe Ladder of Mans Bodie, 
               To the 16. Article. is this. To be Conceived; To be Quickned in the Wombe; To bee Borne; To Sucke; To be Weaned; To Feed upon Pap; To Put forth Teeth, the First time about the Second yeare of Age; To Begin to goe; To Begin to speake; To Put forth Teeth, the Second time, about seven years of Age; To come to Pubertie, about twelve, or fourteene yeares of Age; To be Able for Generation, and the Flowing of the Menstrua; To have Haires about the Legges,
               
and Arme-holes; To Put forth a Beard; And thus long, and sometimes later, to Grow in Stature; To come to full years of Strength and Agility; To grow Gray, and Bild; The Ceasing of the Menstrua, and Ability to Generation; To grow Decrepit, and a Monster with Three Legs; To Die. Meane while, the Mind also, hath certaine Periods; But they cannot be described by yeares; As to decay in the Memory, and the like; Of which hereafter.
            2 The Differences of Youth and Old Age, are these. As Young Mans Skin is Smooth, and Plaine; An Old Mans, Dry and Wrinkled; Especially about the Forchead and Eyes: A young Mans Flesh is Tender and Soft; An old Mans, Hard: A young Man hath Strength, and Agilitie;
               
An old Man, feeles Decay, in his Strength, and is Slow of Motion: A young Man hath good Disgestion; An old Man, Bad: A young Mans Bowells, are Soft, and Succulent: An old Mans, Sale, and Parched: A young Mans Body is Erect, and Straight; An Old Mans, Bowing, and Crooked; A young Mans Limbs are steady; An old Mans, Weake, and Trembling: The Humors in a young Man, are Cholerick, and his Bloud inclined to Heat; In an old Man, Phlegmatick and Melancholick, and his Bloud inclined to Cold nesse: A young Man Readie for the Act of Venus; An old Man Slow unto it: In a young Man, the Iuyces of his Bodie are more Roscide; In an old Man, more Crude, and watrish: The Spirit, in a young Man,

               Plentifull and Boyling; In an old man, Scarce and Iejune: A young Mans Spirit is Dense, and Vigorous; An old Mans Eager and Rare; A young Man hath his Sens's, Quicke, and Entire; An old Man, Dull and Decayed: A young Mans Teeth, are Strong, and Entire; An old Mans Weak, worne, and Falling out: A young Mans Haire is Coloured; An old Mans, of what Colour soever it were, Gray: A young Man hath Haire; An old Man Baldnesse: A young Mans Pulse, is Stronger and Quicker; An old Mans, more Confused, and Slower: The Diseases of young Men are more Acute, and Curable; Of old Men, Longer, and Hard to Cure: A young Mans Wounds soone Close; An old Mans, Later: A young

Mans Checkes, are of a Fresh Colour; An old Mans, Pale, or with a Black Bloud: A young Man is lesse troubled with Rbeumes; An old Man, More: Neither do we know in what Things old Men do improve, as touching their Body, save only sometimes in Fatnesse: Whereof the Reason is soone given; Because old Mens Bodies doe neither Perspire well, nor assimilate well; Now Fatnesse is Nothing else, but an Exuberance of Nourishment, above that which is voyded by Excrement; Or which is perfectly Assimilated. Also, some old Men improve in the Appetite of Feeding, by reason of the Acide Humours; Though old Men Disgest worse. And all these Things, which we have said,

               Physicians, negligently enough, will referre to the Diminution of the Naturall Heat, and Ridicall Moisture; Which are Things of no worth for use. This is certaine, Drinesse in the Comming on of yeares, doth foregoe Coldnesse: And Bodies, when they come to the Top, and Strength of Heat, doe decline to 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  ; And after that followes Coldnesse.
            
            3 Now we are to consider the Affections of the Mind. I remember, when I was a young Man, at Poictiers, in France, I conversed familiarly, with a certaine French-man; A witty Young Man, but something Talkative; Who afterwards grew to bee a very eminent Man: Hee was wont to inveigh against the Manners of

               Old Men; And would say, That if their Mindes could be seene, as their Bodies are, they would appeare no lesse deformed. Besides, being in Love with his owne Wit, he would maintaine; That the Vices of old Mens Minds, had some correspondence, and were Paralell, to the Imperfections of their Bodies: For the Drinesse of their Skin, hee would bring in Impudence; For the Hardnesse of their Bowels, Vnmercifulnesse; For the Lippitude of their Eyes, an Evill Eye, and Envie; For the Casting downe of their Eyes, and Bowing their Body towards the Earth, Atheisme; (For, saith he, they looke no more up to Heaven, as they were wont;) For the Trembling of their Members, Irresolution of their Decrees,
               
and Light Inconstancie; For the Bending of their Fingers, as it were, to catch, Rapacitie, and Covetousnesse; For the Backling of their Knees, Fearfulnesse; For their Wrinkles, Craftinesse, and Obliquity; And other things, which I have forgotten. But to be serious. A young Man, is Modest, and Shamefast; An old Mans Forehead is Hardned: A young Man is full of Bounty and Mercie; An old Mans Heart is Brawnie: A young Man is affected with a Laudable Emuletion; An old Man, with a Malignant Envie: A young man is inclined to Religion, and Devotion, by reason of his Fervencie, and Inexperience of Evill; An old Man Coolerb in Piety, through the Coldnesse of his Charity, and long Conversation

in Evill; And likewise, through the Difficultie of his Beleefe: A young Mans Desires are Vehement; An old Mans, Moderate: A young Man is Light, and Moveable; An old Man, more Grave and Constant: A young Man is 
                  〈◊〉
                to Liberality, and Beneficence, and Humanitie; An old Man to Covetousnesse, Wisdome for his owne selfe, and Seeking his owne 
                     〈◊〉
                  : A young Man is Confident, and Full of Hope; An old Man Diffident, and Given to suspect most Things: A young Man is Gentle, and Obsequious; An old Man Froward and Disdainfull: A young man is Sincere and Open-Hearted; An old Man Cautelous, and Close: A young Man is given to Desire great Things; An old Man, to Regard Things
               
               Necessary: A young Man thinkes well of the Present Times; An old Man, Preferreth Times-past before them: A young Man Reverenceth his Superiours; An old Man is more Forward to tax them: And many other Things, which pertaine rather to Manners, than to the present Inquisition. Notwithstanding, old Men, as in some things, they improve in their Bodies, so also in their Mindes; Unlesse they be altogether out of Date. Namely; That as they are lesse apt for Invention, so they excell in Iudgement; And prefer Safe Things, and Sound Things, before Specious; Also they improve in Garrulity, and Ostentation; For they seeke the Fruit of Speech, while they are lesse able for Action; So

as it was not absurd, that the Poets fained, Old Tithon, to be turned into a Grashopper.
            
         
         
            Moveable Canons, of the Duration of Life, and Forme of Death.
            
               Canon 1.
               
                  COnsumption is not caused, unlesse that, which bet departed with by one Body, passeth into another.
               
                  The Explication.
                  THere is, in Nature, no Annihilation, or Reducing to Nothing: Therefore that which is consumed; is

either resolved into Aire, or turned into some Body Adjacent. So wee see a Spider, or Fly, or Ant, in Amber, (Entombed in a more stately Monument than Kings are,) to be laid up for Eternitie; Although they bee but tender Things, and soone dissipated. But the mattter is this; That there is no Aire by, into which they should be resolved; And the Substance of the Amber is so Heterogeneous, that it receives Nothing of them. The like we conceive would be, if a Stick, or Root, or some such thing, were Buried in Quicksilver. Also wax, and Honey, and 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        , have the same Operation, but In part only.
               
            
            
               
               Canon II.
               THere is in every Tangible body a Spirit, Covered and encompassed with the Grosser Parts of the Body; And from it, all Consumption, and Dissolution, hath the Beginning.
               
                  The Explication.
                  NO Body known unto us, here in the Vpper Part of the Earth, is without a Spirit; Either by Attenuation, and 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        , from the Heat of the Heavenly Bodies; Or by some other way. For the Concavities of Tangible Things, receive not Vaccum, But either Aire, or the proper Spirit of the Thing. And this Spirit.
                     
where of we speak, is not some Vertue, or Energie, or Act, or Trifle; But plainly a Body, Rare and Invisible; Notwithstanding, Circumscribed by place, Quantitative, Reall: Neither againe, is that Spirit Aire, (no more than Wine is Water;) But a Body Rarified, of kin to Aire, though much different from it. Now the Grosser Parts of Bodies, (being Dull Things, and not apt for Motion,) would last a long time; But the Spirit is that, which troubleth, and plucketh, and undermineth them; And converteth the Moisture of the Body, and whatsoever it is able to disgest, into new Spirit: And then, as well the Prae-existing Spirit of the Bodie, as that newly made, flye away together by Degrees.

This is best seene by the Dimination of the Weight, in Bodies dryed, through Perspiration. For neither, all that, which is issued forth, was Spirit, when the Body was Ponderous; Neither was it Not Spirit, when it issued forth.
               
            
            
               Canon III.
               
                  THe Spirit Issuing forth, Dryeth; Detained, and working within, either Melteth, or Putrifieth, or Vivifieth.
               
                  The Explication.
                  THere are Foure Processes of the Spirit; To Arefaction; To Colliquation; To Putrefaction; To Generation of Bodies. Arefaction, is not the

proper Worke of the Spirit, but of the Grosser Parts, after the Spirit issued forth: For then they contract themselves, partly by their Flight of Vacuum, partly, by the Vnion of Homogeneals; As appeares in all Things, which are Arified by Age; And in the Drier Sort of Bodies, which have passed the Fire; As 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        , Charocoales, Bread. Colliquation, is the meere Work of the Spirits; Neither is it done, but when they are excited by Heat: For then, the Spirits, dilating themselves, yet not getting forth; Do insinuate, and disperse themselves, amongst the Grosser Parts; And so make them Soft, and apt to Run, As it is, in Metals, and Wax: For Metals, and all Tenacious Things, are apt to

inhibite the Spirit, that, being excited, it iffueth not forth. 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      is a Mixed work of the Spirits, and of the Grosser Parts: For the Spirit, (which before restrained. and bridled the Parts of the Thing,) being partly issued forth, and partly Enfeebled; All things in the Body doe Dissolve, andreturne to their Homogeneities; Or, (if you will,) to their Elements: That which was Spirit in it, is congregated to it selfe; whereby things Patrified, begin to have an ill Savour: The Oyly Parts to Themselves; Whereby Things Putrified, have that Slipperinesse, and Vnctuositie: The Wairyparts also to themselves: The Dregs to Themselves: Whence followeth that Confusion, in Bodies putrified.
                     
But Generation, or Vivification, is a Worke also mixed, of the Spirit, and Grosser parts, but in a far different Manner: For the Spirit is totally detained, but it swelleth, and moveth locally; And the Grosser Parts are not dissolved; But follow the Motion of the Spirit, and are, as it were, blowne out by it, and extruded into divers figures; From whence commeth that Generation, and Organization: And therefore, Vivification is alwayes done in a Matter Tenacious, and Clammie: And againe, Yeelding and Soft; That there may bee both a Detention of the Spirit; And also a gentle Cession of the Parts, according as the Spirit formes them. And this is seene in the Matter, as well of all Vegetables, as of

                     Living Creatures; whether they be engendred of Putrefaction, or of Sperme: For in all these Things, there is manifestly seene a Matter, hard to breake thorow, easie to yeeld.
               
            
            
               Canon. IV.
               IN all Living Creatures, there are two Kindes of Spirits; Livelesse Spirits, such as are in Bodies Inanimate; And a Vitall Spirit superadded.
               
               
                  The Explication.
                  IT was said before; That to procure long Life, the Body of Man must be considered; First, as Inanimate, and not Repaired by Nourishment: Secondly, as Animate, and Repaired
                     
by Nourishment: For the Former Consideration, gives Lawes touching Consumption; The latter, touching Reparation. Therefore we must know; That there are in Humane Flesh, Bones, Membranes, Organs; Finally, in all the parts, such Spirits diffused in the substance of them, while they are alive; As there are in the same Things; (Flesh, Bones, Membranes, and the Rest;) Separated, and Dead; Such as also remaine in a Carkase: But the Vitall Spirit, although it tuleth them, and hath some Consent with them, yet it is farre differing from them; Being integrall, and subsisting by it selfe. Now there are two especiall Differences, betwixt the Livelesse Spirits, and the

                     Vitall Spirits: The one, that the Livelesse Spirits, are not continued to Themselves; But are, as it were, cut off; And encompassed with a Grosse Body, which intercepts them; As Aire is mixt in Snow, or Froth: But the Vitall Spirit is all continued to it selfe, by certaine Conduit Pipes, through which it passeth, and is not totally intercepted. And this Spirit is twofold also; The one Branched onely, passing through small Pipes, and, as it were, Strings: The other hath a Cell also; So as it is not onely continued to it selfe, but also Congregared in an Hollow Space, in reasonable good Quantity, according to the Analogie of the Body; And in that Cell is the Fountaine of the Rivulers,

which branch from thence. That Cell is, chiefly, in the Ventricles of the Braine; Which, in the Ignobler sort of Creatures, are but Narrow; Insomuch, that the Spirits in them, seeme scattered over their whole Body, rather than Celled: As may be seene in Serpents, Eels, and Flies; whereof, every of their parts move long after they are cut asunder. Birds also leape a good while after their Heads are pulled off; Because they have little Heads, and little Cels: But the Nobler sort of Creatures, have those Ventricles larger: And Man the largest of all. The other Difference betwixt the Spirits, is; That the Vitall Spirit, hath a Kinde of Enkindling; And is like a Winde or Breath, compouuded

of Flame and Aire, As the Juyces of Living Creatures, have both Oyle and Water. And this Enkindling ministreth peculiar Motions and Faculties: For the Smoke, which is inflammable, even before the Flame conceived, is Hot, Thin, and Moveable; And yet it is quite another Thing, after it is become Flame: But the Enkindling of the Vitall Spirits, is, by many Degrees, gentler than the softest Flame; As of Spirit of Wine, or otherwise: And besides, it is in great part mixed with an Aeriall Substance; That it should be a Mystery or Miracle, both of a Flammcous, and Aereous Nature.
               
            
            
               
               Canon V.
               THe Naturall Actions, are proper to the Severall Parts; But it is the Vitall Spirit, that excites, and sharpens them.
               
                  The Explication.
                  THe Actions, or Functions, which are in the severall Members, follow the Nature of the Members Themselves, (Attraction, Retention, Disgestion, Assimilation, Separation, Excretion, Perspiration. Even Sense it selfe;) According to the Proprietie of the severall Organs; (The Stomach, Liver, Heart, Spleene, Gall, Braine, Eye, Eare, and the rest.) Yet none of these Actions would

ever have beene actuated, but by the Vigour, and Presence, ofthe Vitall Spirit, and 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      thereof: As one Iron would not have drawne another Iron, unlesse it had beene excited by the Load-stone; Nor an Egge would ever have brought forth a Bird; unlesse the Substance of the Hen had beene actuated by the Treading of the Cock.
                  
               
            
            
               Canon VI.
               THe Livelesse Spirits are next Consubstantiall to Aire; The Vitall Spirits, approach more to the Subsiance of Flame.
               
               
                  
                  The Explication.
                  THe Explication of the precedent Fourth Canon, is also a Declaration of this present Canon: But yet further, from hence it is; That all Fat, and Oyly Things, continue long in their Being; For neither doth the 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      much pluck them; Neither doe they much desire to 
                        〈◊〉
                      Themselves with Aire. As for that Conceit, it is altogether vaine; That Flame should bee Aire set on Fire. Seeing Flame, and Aire, are no lesse Heterogeneall, than 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      and Water. But whereas, it is said, in the Canon, That the Vitall Spirits, approach more to the Substance of Flame, It must bee understood, that

they doe this more, than the Livelesse Spirits; Not that they are more Flamy, than Airy.
                  
               
            
            
               Canon VII.
               THe Spirit hath two Defires: One, of Multiplying it selfe; The other, of Flying forth, and Congregating it selfe with the Connaturals.
               
               
                  The Explication.
                  THe Canon is understood of the Livelesse Spirits: For as for the second Desire, the Vitall Spirit, doth most of all abhorre, Flying forth of the Body; For it findes no Connaturals, here below, to joyne withall. Perhaps, it may sometimes flye to the outward

Parts of the Body, to meet that which it loveth; But the Flying forth, as I said, it abhorreth. But in the Livelesse Spirits, each of these two Desires holdeth. For to the I ormer this belongeth; Every Spirit, seated amongst the Grosser Parts, dwelleth unhappily; And therefore, when it findes not a Like unto it selfe, it doth so much the more labour, to create, and make a Like: As being in agreat Solitude; And endevours earnestly; To Multiply it selfe; And to prey upon the Volatile of the Grosser Parts; That it may be increased in Quantitie. As for the Second 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      of Flying forth, And Betaking it selfe to the Aire; It is certain, that all Light Things, (which are ever Moveable,)

doe willingly goe unto their Likes, neare unto them: As a Drop of water is carried to a Drop; Flame to Flame: But much more is this done, in the Flying forth of Spirit, into the Aire Ambient; Because, it is not carried to a Particle, like unto it selfe, but also as unto the Globe, of the Connaturals. Meane while, this is to be noted; That the Going forth, and Flight, of the Spirit into Aire, is a redoubled Action; Partly, out of the Appetite of the Spirit; Partly, out of the Appetite of the Aire: For the Common Aire is a Needy Thing; And receiveth all Things greedily; As Spirits, Odours, Beams, Sounds, and the like.
               
            
            
               
               Canon VIII.
               
                  Spirit Detained, if it have no possibilitie of begetting new Spirit, intenerateth the Grosser Parts.
               
                  The Explication.
                  
                     GEneration of new Spirit, is not accomplished, but upon those Things, which are, in some Degree, neare to Spirit: Such as are Humide Bodies. And therefore if the Grosser parts, (amongst which the Spirit converseth,) be in a remote Degree, although the Spirit cannot convert them, yet, (as much as it can,) it weakeneth, and softeneth, and subdueth them; That seeing it cannot increase in

                     Quantitie, yet it will dwell more at large, and live amongst good Neighbours, and Friends. Now this Aphorisme is most usefull to our End; Because, it tendeth to the Inteneration of the Obstinate Parts, by the Detention of the Spirit.
                  
               
            
            
               Canon IX.
               
                  THe Inteneration, of the Harder Parts, commeth to good effect, when the Spirit neither Flyeth forth, nor begetteth new Spirit.
               
                  The Explication.
                  THis Canon, solveth the Knot, and Difficultie, in the Operation of Intenerating, by the Detention of the Spirit.
                     
For if the Spirit, not flying forth, wasteth all within, there is Nothing gotten, to the Inteneration of the Parts, in their Subsistence; But rather they are dissolved, and Corrupted. Therefore together with the Detention, the Spirits ought to bee cooled, and restrained, that they may not be too Active.
               
            
            
               Canon X.
               THe Heat of the Spirit, to keepe the Body, Fresh, and Green, ought to be Robust, 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Eager.
               
               
                  The Explication.
                  ALso this Canon pertaineth, to the solving of the knot 
                        〈◊〉
                     ; But it is

of a much larger Extent. For it fetteth downe, of what Temporament, the Heat in the Body, ought to be, for the 
                        〈◊〉
                      of Long Life: Now this is usefull, whether the Spirits bee 
                        〈◊〉
                     , or whether they be not. For howsoever, the Heat of the Spirits must bee such, as it may rather turne it selfe, upon the Hard Parts, than waste the Soft; For the one Desiccateth, the other Intenerateth. Besides, the same Thing is available, to the well perfecting of Assimilation; For such an Heat, doth excellently excite the Facultie of 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        ; And withall, doth excellently prepare the Matter, to be Assimilated. Now the Properties of this kinde of Heat, ought to be these. First, that it bee

                     Slow, and heat not Suddenly: Secondly, that it be not very Intense, but Moderate: Thirdly, that it be Equall; Not Incomposed; Namely, Intending, and Remitting it selfe: Fourthly, that if this Heat, meet any Thing to resist it, it bee not easily suffocated, or languish. This Operation is exceeding subtile, but seeing it is one, of the most usefull, it is not to be deserted. Now, in those Remedies, (which we propounded, to invest the Spirits, with a Robust Heat; Or, that which we call, Operative, not Predatory;) wee have, in some sort, satisfied this Matter.
               
            
            
               
               Canon XI.
               THe Condensing, of the Spirits, in their Substance, is available to long Life.
               
                  The Explication.
                  THis Canon is subordinate to the next precedent: For the Spirit Condensed, receiveth all those foure properties of Heat, whereof wee spake: But the wayes of Condensing them, are set downe, in the first, of the Ten Operations.
                  
               
            
            
               Canon XII.
               THe Spirit, in great Quantity hasteneth more to Flying forth, and preyeth

upon the Body more, than it small Quantitie.
               
               
                  The Explication.
                  THis Canon is cleare, of it selfe, Seeing meer Quantitie, doth regularly increase Vertue. And it is to be seene in Flames; That the bigger they are, the stronger they breake forth, and the more speedily they consume. And therefore, over great 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        , or Exuberance of the Spirits, is altogether Hurtfull to Long Life: Neither need one wish a greater store of Spirits, than what is sufficient, for the Function of Life, and the Office of a good Reparation.
               
            
            
               
               Canon XIII.
               THe Spirit equally dispersed, maketh lesse Haste to flye forth, and preyeth lesse upon the Body, than unequally placed.
               
                  The Explication.
                  NOt onely Abundance of Spirits, in respect of the whole, is hurtfull to the Duration of Things; But also the same Abundance, unevenly placed, is, in like manner, hurtfull: And therefore, the more the Spirit is shred, and inserted by small portions, the lesse it preyeth: For Dissolution ever beginneth at that part, where the Spirit is looser. And therefore, both Exercise,
                     
and Frications, conduce much to Long Life; For Agitation, doth fineliest diffuse, and commix Things by small Portions.
               
            
            
               Canon XIIII.
               THe Inordinate, and Subsultorie, Motion of the Spirits, doth more hasten to Going forth, and doth prey upon the Body more, than the Constant, and Equall.
               
               
                  The Explication.
                  IN Inanimates this Canon holds for certaine; For Inequality is the Mother of Dissolution; But in Animates, (Because, not only the Consumption is considered, but the Reparation; And Reparation

proceedeth by the Appetites of Things; And Appetite is sharpened by varietie;) It holdeth not rigorously; But it is so farre forth to be received; That this Varietie, bee rather an Alternation, or Enterchange, than a Confusion; And, as it were, Constant in Inconstancie.
               
            
            
               Canon XV.
               THe Spirit, in a Body, of a Solide Composure, is detained, though 
                     〈◊〉
                  .
               
                  The Explication.
                  ALl Things doe abhorre a Solution of their Continuitie, But yet in proportion, to their Density, or Rarity:
                     
For the more Rare the Bodies be, the more doe they suffer Themselves, to be thrust into small, and narrow Passages; For Water will goe into a passage, which Dust will not goe into; And Aire, which Water will not goe into; Nay Flame, and Spirit, which Aire will not goe into. Notwithstanding, of this Thing, there are some Bounds: For the Spirit is not so much transported, with the Desire of Going forth, that it will suffer it selfe to be too much discontinued; Or be driven into overstrait pores and passages: And therefore if the Spirit bee encompassed with an Hard Body; Or else with an Vnctuous, and Tenacious, (which is not easily divided;) it is plainly Bound, and, as I may say, imprisoned;

And layeth downe the Appetite of Going out: Wherefore wee see, that Metals, and Stones, require a long Time, for their Spirit to goe forth; Unlesse either the Spirit bee excited by the Fire; Or the Grosser Parts bee dissevered with Corroding, and Strong waters. The like Reason is there, of Tenacious Bodies; Such as are Gums; Save only that they are melted by a more gentle Hear. And therefore, the 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      of the Body hard, a Close and Compact skin, and the like; (which are procured, by the Drynesse of the Aliment, and by Exercise, and by the Coldnesse of the Aire;) Are good for long Life; Because they detaine the Spirit in close Prison, that it goeth not forth.
               
            
            
               
               Canon XVI.
               
                  IN Oyly, and Fat, Things, the Spirit is detained willingly, though they be not Tenacious.
               
               
                  The Explication.
                  THe Spirit, if it be not irritated, by the Antipathy, of the Body enclosing it; Nor fed by the over-much Likenesse of that Body; Nor sollicited, or invited, by the Externall Body; It makes no great stir, to get out: All which are wanting to Oyly Bodies: For they are neither so pressing upon the Spirits, as Hard Bodies; Nor so Neare as Watry Bodies; Neither have they any good Agreement with the Aire Ambient.
                  
               
            
            
               
               Canon XVII.
               THe Speedy flying forth of the Watry Humour, conserves the Oyly, the longer in his Being.
               
                  The Explication.
                  WE said before, that the Watry Humours, as being Consubstantiall to the Aire, flye forth soonest; The Oyly, later, as having small Agreement, with the Aire: Now whereas these two Humours are in most Bodies, it comes to passe, that the watry, doth, in a sort, betray the Oyly; For that Issuing forth insensibly, carrieth this together with it. Therefore, there is Nothing, that more furthereth

the Conservation of Bodies, than a gentle Drying of them; which causeth the Watry Humour to expire, and inviteth not the Oyly; For then the Oyly enjoyeth the proper Nature. And this tendeth not only to the Inhibiting of Putrefaction, (Though that also followeth,) but to the Conservation of Greennesse. Hence it is, that Gentle Frications, and Moderate Exercises, causing rather Perspiration, than Sweating, conduce much to long Life.
               
            
            
               Canon XVIII.
               
                  AIre excluded, conftrreth to long Life, if 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Inconveniences be avoyded.
               
                  
                  The Explication.
                  WEe said a little before; That the Flying forth of the Spirit, is a Redoubled Action; From the Appetite, of the Spirit, and of the Aire: And therefore, if either of these bee taken out of the way, there is not a little galned. Notwithstanding, divers Inconveniences follow hereupon; Which, how they may bee prevented, wee have shewed, in the second, of our ten Operations.
                  
               
            
            
               Canon XIX.
               YOuthfull Spirits iuserted into an Old Body, might soone 
                     〈◊〉
                   
                  Natures Course back againe.
               
                  
                  The Explication.
                  THe Nature of the Spirits, is as the uppermost wheele, which turneth about the other wheeles, in the Body of Man. And therefore, in the Intention of Long Life, that ought to be first placed. Hereunto may bee added; That there is an Easier, and more Expedite way, to alter the Spirits, than to other Operations. For the Operation upon the Spirits, is twofold; The one, by Aliments, which is Slow, and, as it were, about; The other, (and that Twofold,) which is sudden, and goeth directly to the Spirits; Namely, by Vapours, or by the Affections.

                  JUyces of the Body, Hard, and Roscide, are good for long Life.
               
                  The Explication.
                  THe Reason is plaine; Seeing wee shewed before; That Hard Things, and Oyly or Roscide, are hardly dissipated. Notwithstanding, there is this Difference, (As wee also noted in the Tenth Operation,) That Iuyce somewhat Hard is indeed lesse Dissipable, but then it is withall lesse Reparable. Therefore a Convenience is interlaced with an Inconvenience; And for this Cause, no wonderfull Matter will be atchieved by

this. But Roscide Iuyce, will admit both Operations. Therefore this would be principally

                      well, but yet with a sting, or

                  The Explication.
                  THis Canon, we have sufficiently explained in our Discourse, 
                        〈◊〉
                      the

               Canon XXIII.
               ALIMENTATION from without, at least some other way than by the Stomach, is most profitable for long Life, if it can be done.
               
               
                  The Explication.
                  WE see, that all Things, which are done by Nutrition, aske a long time; But those, which are done by Embracing of the like, (As it is in Infusions,) require no long time. And therefore, Alimentation from without, would be of principall use; And so much the more, because the 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      of 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        , decay in old Age; So that, if there could be some; Auxiliary Natritions;
                     
By Bathings, Vnctions, or else by Clysters; These Things, in Conjunction, might doe much, which Single, are lesse Available.
               
            
            
               Canon XXIIII.
               WHere the Concoction is weake, to thrust forth the Aliment; There the outward Parts should be strengthened, to call forth the Aliment.
               
               
                  The Explication.
                  THat which is propounded in this Canon, is not the same Thing with the former; For it is one Thing, for the Outward Aliment, to bee attracted inward; Another for the Inward Aliment, to bee attracted
                     
                     Outward: yet herein they concur, that they both help the weaknesse of the 
                        
                           〈◊◊〉
                        
                      though by divers wayes.
               
            
            
               Canon XXV.
               ALL sudden Renovation of the Body, is wrought; Either by the Spirits; Or by Malacissations.
               
               
                  The Explication.
                  THere are two Things, in the Body; Spirits, and Parts; To both these, the way by Nutrition, is long, and about; But it is a short way, to the Spirits, by Vapours, and by the Affections; And to the Parts, by Malacissations: But this is dillgently to be noted;

That by no meanes, wee 
                        〈◊〉
                      
                     Alimentation from 
                           〈◊〉
                        , with Malacissation: For the Intention of Malacissation, is not to nourish the Parts; But onely to make them more fit to bee nourished.
               
            
            
               Canon XXVI.
               MAlacissation is wrought, by Consubstantials; By Imprinters; 3 And by Closers up.
               
                  The Explication.
                  THe Reason is manifest; For that Consubstantials doe properly supple the Body; 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      doe carry in; Closers up doe retaine, and bridle the Perspiration, which

is a Motion opposite to Malacissation. And therefore, (as we described in the Ninth Operation,) Malacissation cannot well be done at once; But in a Course or Order. First, by Excluding the Liquour, by Thickners; For an Outward, and grosse Infusion, doth not well compact the Body; That which entreth, must be Subtile, and a Kinde of Vapour. Secondly, by Intenerating, by the Consent of Cousubstantials: For Bodies, upon the touch of those Things, which have good agreement with them, open themselves, and relax their Pores. Thirdly, Imprinters are Convoyes, and insi nuate into the Parts, the Consubstantials; And the Mixture of Gentle Astringents, doth somewhat restraine the Perspiration.
                     
But then, in the 
                        〈◊〉
                      place, followes that

                           〈◊〉
                        ; And then afterward, by 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        ; Untill the Supple be 
                        〈◊〉
                      into Solide; As wee said in the proper place.

               FRequent Renovation of the Parts Reparable, watereth and reneweth the lesse Reparable also.
               
                  The Explication.
                  WE said in the Preface to this History; That the Way of Death, was this; That the Parts Reparable, died in the Fellowship of the Parts lesse Reparable; So that in the

                     Reparation of these same lesse Reparable Parts, all our Forces would bee employed. And therefore, being admonished by Aristotles Observation, touching Plants; Namely; That the putting forth of new Shoots and Branches, refresheth the Body of the Tree, in the Passage; Wee conceive, the like Reason might be; If the Flesh and bloud, in the Body of Man, were often renewed; That thereby, the Bones themselves, and Membranes, and other Parts, which in their owne Nature, are Lesse Reparable; Partly by the cheerefull Passage of the Iuyees; Partly by that new Clouthing of the young Flesh and Bloud; Might be Watred and Renewed.
                  
               
            
            
               
               Canon XXVIII.
               
                  REfrigeration, or Cooling of the Body, which passeth some other wayes, then by the Stomach, is usefull for Long Life.
               
                  The Explication.
                  THe Reason is at hand; For seeing a Refrigeration, not Temperate, but Powerfull, (especially of the Bloud,) is above all Things, necessary to long Life; This can, by no means, be effected from within, as much as is requisite, without the Destruction of the Stomach and Bowels.
                  
               
            
            
               
               Canon XXIX.
               THat Intermixing, or Entangling; That as well Consumption, as Reparation, are the workes of Heat, is the greatest Obstacle to long Life.
               
                  The Explication.
                  ALmost all great workes are destroyed, by the Natures of Things, Intermixed; when as that, which helpeth in one respect, hurteth in another: Therefore Men must proceed herein, by a sound Judgement, and a discreet Practice: For our Part, wee have done so, as farre as the matter will beare, and our Memory serveth us; By Separating, Benigne Heats, from

                     Hurtfull; And the Remedies, which tend to both.
               
            
            
               Canon XXX.
               CUring of Diseases is effected by Temporary Medicines; But Lengthening of Life requireth Observation of Diets.
               
                  The Explication.
                  THose things, which come by Accident, as soone as the Causes are removed, cease againe; But the Continued Course of Nature, like a Running River, requires a continuall Rowing, and Sayling against the Streame. Therefore, we must worke regularly, by Diets. Now Diets are of two Kindes; Set Diets, which

are to be observed at certaine times; And Familiar Diet, which is to be admitted into our Daily Repast: But the Set Diets are the more potent: That is; A Course of Medicines, for a time: For those Things, which are of so great Vertue, that they are able to turne Nature backe againe; Are, for the most part, more strong, and more speedily Altering, than those, which may, without danger, be received into a Continual use. Now in the Remedies, set downe in our Intentions; You shall find only three Set Diets: The Opiate Diet; The Diet Malacissant, or Suppling; And the Diet Emaciant, and Renewing. But amongst those, which wee Prescribed for Familiar Diet, and to be used daily, the most efficacious

are these that follow: Which also come not farre Short of the Vertue of Set Diets. Nitre, and the Subordinates to Nitre; The Regiment of the Affections, and Course of our Life; 
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      which passe not by the Stomach; Drinkes Roscidating, or Eng ndring Oyly Iuyces; Besprinkling of the Bloud with some Firmer Matter, as Pearles; certaine Woods; Competent Vnctions, to keepe out the Aire, and to keepe in the Spirit; Heaters from without, during the Assimilation after Sleepe; Avoiding of Those Things, which Enflame the Spirit, and put it into an Eager Heat, as Wine, and Spices: Lastly, a Moderate and Seasonable use of those Things, which endue the Spirits with a Robust Heat; As

Saffron, Cresses, Garlick, Elecampane, and Compound Opiates.
               
            
            
               Canon XXXI.
               THe Living Spirit is instantly extinguished, if it be deprived either of Motion; or of Refrigeration; Or of Aliment.
               
               
                  The Explication.
                  NAmely, these are those three, which before we called the Porches of Death; And they are the Proper and Immediate Passiōs of the Spirit. For all the Organs of the principall parts, serve hereunto; That these three Offices be performed; and againe, all destruction of the Organs,
                     
which is Deadly, brings the Matter to this point, that one or more of these three faile. Therefore, all other Things are the divers Wayes to Death, but they end in these three. Now the Whole Fabricke of the Parts, is the Organ of the Spirit; As the Spirit is the 
                        
                           〈◊〉
                        
                      of the Reasonable Soule; which is Incorporeous and Divine.
                  
               
            
            
               Canon XXXII.
               FLame is a Momentany Substance; Aire a Fixed; The Living Spirit, in Creatures, is of a Middle Nature.
               
                  
                  The Explication.
                  THis Matter stands in need both of an higher Indagation, and of a longer Explication, than is pertinent to the present Inquisition. Meane while, we must know this; That Flame is almost every Moment generated and extinguished; so that it is continued onely by succession: 
                        〈◊〉
                      
                     Aire is a Fixed Body, and is not Dissolved; For though Aire begets new Aire, out of watry Moisture, yet notwithstanding the old Aire still remaines; whence commeth that Super-Oneration of the Aire, where of we have spoken, in the Title, De Vent is: But Spirit is participant of both Natures; both of Flame
                     
and Aire; Even as the Nourishments thereof are; Aswell Oyle, which is Homogeneous to Flame; As Water, which is Homogeneous to Aire: For the Spirit is not 
                        〈◊〉
                     , either of Oyly alone, or of Watry alone, but of both together; And though Aire doth not agree well with Flame, nor Oyle with Water; yet in a mixt Body they agree well enough. Also, the Spirit hath from the Aire, his Easie and Delicate Impressions, and yeeldings; And from the Flame, his Noble and Potent Motions and Activities. In like manner, the Duration of Spirit, is a Mixed Thing; Being neither so Momentany, as that of Flame; Nor so Fixed, as that of Aire. And so much the rather

it followeth not the Condition of Flame; For that Flame it selfe is extinguished by Accident; Namely, by Contraries, and Enemies environing it; But Spirit is not subject to the like Conditions and Necessities. Now the Spirit is repaired, from the Lively and Floride Bloud of the small Arteries, which are inserted into the Braine; But this Reparation is done by a peculiar Manner, of which we speake not now.
                  FINIS.
