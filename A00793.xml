            EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.
            EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).
            The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.
            Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.
            Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.
            Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.
            The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.
            Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).
            Keying and markup guidelines are available at the Text Creation Partnership web site.

            TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE CHARLES KING OF Great Brittayne, France, and Ireland &amp;c.
            
               MOST GRACIOVS SOVERAIGNE, These Theologicall Labours, which we now publish, were vndertaken by Order of our

late Soueraygne of Famous Memory, for his desired Satisfaction about some of the principall Points, which with-held his Royall ioyning vnto the Church of Rome. The Authour when he penned them, did expect they should haue been kept within the priuate Library of his Princely Reading, and not made publike to the World, as afterward they were by a Doctour Minister, togeather with a Voluminous Reply, wherin he seekes to disgrace them, by much bitternes of speach, vttered in the violence of his Zeale.
            This imposed an Obligation vpon the Authour, to reuiew them agayne, and to set them forth whole and entiere, purged from the faults of hand-writing misprision; cleered from the cloudes cast vpon them by ignorant Cauill; strenghthened with some new Collaterall Additions of more euident Explication and Proofe. Which Labours renewned &amp; published, we humbly offer vnto your most Excellent Maiesty, as vnto the Heyre, not only of your Renowned Fathers Dignity and State, but also of his Wisdome and Vertue,

in whome is perpetuated, as the Nobility of his Bloud, so the Excellency of his Mind.
            And though it be their hard fortune to appeare in your Presence at the time, whē the light of your Royall Clemency is towardes your Catholicke Subiects eclypsed; yet for themselues, they confide to find some speciall Fauour, not to be forbidden, or banished your Maiestyes Dominions, in that they be Natiffe of your Royall Fathers Command, by the Warrāt of his Authority borne into the World, whose Sacred Pleasure, through pious Excesse of Filiall Affection, You still reuerence after his Discease.
            Neyther can it be for the credit of our Aduersaryes, or of their Cause, that free Accesse should be denyed vnto these Writings, which (as themselues testify) were by the sound of Authority summoned vnto the Combat, vpon supposition, that thereby, Our weakenes, and want of strength would manifestly appeare. For thus they write: The better to discouer their weaknes,
               
                  D. Whites Preface.
                
               &amp; to plucke them out of their Fox-hole of Personall Succession,

and visibility, the King imposed the Taske of writing vpon the Nine Questions, knowing our Aduersaryes to be cunning, and subtill in eluding our Arguments, but of no strength, especially in particular Questions, to proue their owne Tenet, or to confirme their Fayth by sacred Scripture, or Auncient Tradition.
            
            If after so solemne Inuitation vnto the Combat, if after so bold Promises that in these Writings, our weakenes would be discouered, if after so great assurance giuen to their Credents, that we cannot confirme our Religion by Scripture, these challenged Writings be stayed by Authority, not to enter into the Field; this may yield vnto Iudicious Protestants iust reason to suspect, that weaknes and want of strength, rather lyeth on their side; and that the Patrons of their Reformed Religion, place their confidence of Victory, rather in the Partiality of the State, then in the Euidence of the Scripture, in the behalfe of their Doctrines.
            And, as these Tytles, euen the Credit of the Protestant Cause, pleade for the free permission of this Booke: so the Booke it selfe contaynes nothing that may cause the

hinderance of so due a fauour. Therin no person in Authority is censured, no matter of State touched, nothing vttered that may iustly offēd; only the euidēce of Gods Holy Word is vrged, in defence of that Religion, which euen in your Royall Iudgment, is so farre from being impious in it selfe, or an Enemy of your State, as You haue by most happy choyce selected the same to be the Consort of your Crowne, to be the Parent of those glorious Starres, which (according to the hope of all Loyall Subiects) shal frō your Maiesties Throne, by long continued Succession, shine vnto these fortunate Kingdomes: who by her euer-honoured Name of MARY, but much more by the rare Excellency of her Vertues, liuely represents the sweet Memory of your Right Glorious Grand-mother, whiles she liued, for Princely qualityes the Paragon of Europe, and now a singular Ornament of the Heauens, in regard of her cōstancy in the Catholike Roman Religion vnto death; that her enraged Enemyes, not being able to conquer her Immortall Affection vnto the same,

feared not to shed her no lesse Innocent, then Noble Bloud, the Fountaine of Your Maiestyes Royall Rights vnto the Kingdoms of Great Brittayne, to strike of that Thrice-Venerable Head, more Glorious for the lustre of the One Catholike Fayth She maintayned, then for the shining gemnes of Three Christian Crownes, of which, two She wore, and the third was vndoubtedly her Due.
            Your Royall Magnanimity, timely tokens whereof appeared in your tender Yeares, hath engaged the Harts of your Loyall Subiects, in a secret Ioy of Hope, that God by meanes of your Maiesty, will illustrate this Kingdome, by many rich Blessings of Temporall Glory. In which Hope we are strengthned by the fortunate Name of Charles the First: fortunate I say, to bring Felicities vpon Kingdomes; vnder, &amp; by which Name, 
                  France vnder Charles the Great: Spayne vnder Charles, the fifth Emperour, but the first of that Name Kinge of Spayne, surnamed Maximus.
                the two mightiest Kingdoms of Europe aduanced to Imperial Dignity, grew vnto the highest of worldly Greatnes. In which respect it is not any disloyall Affection, that we wish in our Harts, and pray vnto the Soueraygne MoModeratour,

in whose hands are the Harts of Princes, that he wil incline your Princely Hart, to be fauourable vnto that Religion, which only hath been Conquerant in former ages; that hardly can any Christian King be named Renownedly Victorious, that was not a Professour, or a Fauourer therof. Yea, if we call to mind the most famous &amp; wonderfull victoryes that haue ennobled the Christiā Name, we may find, that they were fruits, and effects of some Deuotions of the Catholike Roman Fayth questioned, &amp; proued in this Treatise.

putting therin assured confidence of victory, vnto whome God gaue miraculous successe, and He, an example vnto Christian succeeding Monarches, to prostrate the Imperiall Purple before the sayd sacred Ensigne, to adore thereby Christ their God. Wherein a chiefe Saint of that Age reioycing, singeth this verse,

               Theodosius, to whome likewise Heroicall Worthynes hath giuen the tytle of Great, no doubt, but his so many great Victories, specially agaynst Eugenius the Pagan Vsurping Emperour, were wonne by his Deuotion vnto Saints, whose Churches before he went to that warlike Expedition, he did visit,

               lying prostrate before their Shrines, crauing the assured ayde of their Powerfull Intercessions. In the Enterprize, hauing in the first Battayle lost the day, by the

slaughter of a great part of his army that were Infidells, full of perplexity he spent the night in prayer in a Chappell on the top of a mountayne,

                he went in expedition agaynst Alaricus the Arian, who had vsurped Gascoigne, &amp; other parts of the most Christian Kingdome, to prepare the way vnto the victory, he offered Giftes, and Donaryes vnto S. Martin, in honour of whome he also commanded none should touch any thing of the Countrey of Tours, but only water and grasse for their horses. Agaynst which Edict when one of his Souldiers had transgressed, he gaue order he should be punished, saying, VVhat hope of Victory, if we offend Saint Martin? Hence his Enterprize was so fortunate, &amp; illustrated by wonderfull

euents. A Stagge wēt before his army, shewing where they might wade ouer the Riuer of Vienne, then so swolne with water, as it was not passable, but only in that place. Being in the field neere vnto Poytiers, where Saint Hilaryes body is honoured,

In his returne acknowledging the Victory gotten by Saint Martins intercession, he offered vnto him his Warlike Palfree, whereon he had fought so gloriously, redeeming the same afterward with a Summe of money.
            
               Pepinus, who ioyned a great part of Germany that then was Pagan vnto the Crown of France, had greater confidence of Victory in his deuout Inuocation of Saints, then in the strength of his Armyes. Hence hauing in a fierce Battayle with the Saxons, obtayned a glorious Victory, his wearyed and wounded Army being presently set

vpon by a fresh mighty Band of Infidells,

               ; so many in number, and so confident in their forces, as they durst bragge, they could not be ouercome, except eyther the Earth should sinke vnder them, or the Heauens fall vpon them. The King and his Souldiers fought valiantly, but prayed no lesse deuoutly; the King making often Vowes vnto God to roote Symony out of his Kingdomes did he win the day, the Souldiers often repeating Kyrie eleyson, Kyrie eleyson; by the deuout ingemination of which Christian Letany, agaynst the Hunnish Hui, Hui, Hui, they got the Victory: making manifest how great is the force of Prayer, though in a language not vulgarly knowne. For the victory was so Illustrious, as in respect thereof, the sayd Emperour became renowned, admired &amp; honoured of all Christian Princes.

Being on the one side of the Rhene, and the Rebells on the other, a few of his Souldiers, without his priuity passing the Riuer, fell into the Enemyes hands. The Pious Emperour seing them in distresse, and not able to succour them, mooued with compassion, prostrated himselfe (his whole Army doing the like) before the holy Lance with many teares, praying vnto our Sauiour whose Hands, and Feete had been pierced with those sacred Nailes. No sooner was he prostrate on the ground, but presently the Rebells, no man knowing why, ranne away, their harts inwardly cōsuming with feare, so that many of them were killed, &amp; taken prisoners by the aforesayd poore handfull of men.
            
               Henry the second Emperour, Nephew to this Otho, was on the one side so Victorious,

as he ioyned vnto the Crowne of the Empyre the Kingdomes of Bohemia, Sclauonia, and Hungary; on the other so giuen vnto Roman deuotiō, as he is a canonized Saint of the Roman Church. His 
                  Dithmar. lib. 6.
                Religion towards Gods B. Mother was singular, in whose Honour he vowed, and kept his Virginity vnspotted, togeather with Kunegundis the Virgin holy Empresse his Spouse. When 
                  Godofred. Viterb. in Chronic. Cuspianus. Bonfin. de rebus Hungar. Dec. 2. lib. 1. he entred into any Citty, his custome was to spend the first night praying in the Church of our Lady, if any were in the place consecrated to her Name. Hence in the battayle he fought agaynst Bolistaus King of Bohemia, the Holy martyrs Saint Laurence, Saint George, &amp; Saint Adrian, sent by the Queene of Saints, were seene to goe before his Army,
                  Nauclerus à Christo gen. 34. part. 2. pag. 106. carrying the Standart of the Crosse, striking the Enemy with blindnes; so that they not being able to behold, much lesse to resist the Emperours forces, Bohemia was made Vassall vnto the Empyre, without any effusion of bloud.
            About the same tyme the two renowned Normans Robert, and Roger, vndertaking to free Sicily from the Tyranny of the

               Saracens, wherewith the same had been a long tyme oppressed, were constrayned with small forces to 
                  Thomas Fazellus, de rebus Sicul. Decad. post. lib. 7. p. 397. encounter an huge Host wherein were thirty thousand horse, and foote without number. In the heate of the battayle Saint George was seene blazing forth glorious beames of brightnes vpon a white Steed, in a white Horsemans coate, on which was sowed a Red Crosse thereby encouraging the Christian Army, and driuing the Enemy before him. Hence the Nation of the Normans conceaued speciall deuotion vnto S. George, calling vpon him in their Battayles next after God; and with the Normans it is likely, the same deuotion entred into England.
            
            In confirmation of this truth, how many Examples doth Spayne affoard of Victories gotten by Catholike deuotions against the Saracens, who in the yeare 701. made themselues maysters of the greatest part of that Countrey?

The King did as the holy Apostle ordayned, who according to his promise, was seen in the Field vpon a white horse, with a Red Crosse on his breast, running vpon the Mahometans, and putting them to flight.

The Masse ended, the sayd Abbot came downe, &amp; stood in the Front of the Army with the Standart of the Crosse, which they all saluted falling with their bodyes on the ground. The English imagining this was done in token that they yielded, soone found thē

            THE PREFACE TO THE READER.
            
               TO the end (good Reader) thou mayst more cleerly conceaue the Scope of these Writings, I haue thought fit, to giue thee notice of some things, concerning the Answere vnto the Nine Poynts, and of the occasion thereof.
            I suppose, thou hast heard of some Conferences about matters of Religion, which passed between M. Iohn Fisher Iesuit on the one side, and D. Francis White Minister on the other, for the satisfaction of an Honourable Person that was moued to doubt, whether the Protestant were the true Church. At the second Conference our late Soueraigne King Iames being himselfe present, about the conclusion thereof imposed vpon M. Fisher a Taske of writing about some Questions of Controuersy, and accordingly

sent a note contaying Nine Poynts, with this title of Superscription: Some of the Principall Poynts, which with-hold my ioyning vnto the Church of Rome, except she reforme herselfe, or be able to giue me satisfaction, are these.
            
            This is the true Occasion of M. Fishers writing, and the manner in which his Maiesty proposed the sayd Nine Questions: whereby thou mayst discouer the falshood of the Occasion pretended by the Minister D. White, to saue his owne credit, and to discredit M. Fishers Relation of the Conference. He sayth,
                  In his Preface to the Reader.
                his Maiesty hauing well vnderstood of the Iesuits Cretizing Relation, &amp; of his dispersing hundreds of papers to his owne prayse, and to the disgrace of his Aduersaryes, THERFORE made the proposition of the Nine Questions, that, the Iesuit answering them, and the Minister replying agaynst his Answere, a publicke testimony might be extant, whereby men might iudge of the sufficiency of the one, and insufficiency of the other. This is a Tale faygned vpon the fingers ends of the Writer thereof. For (besides that the superscription of the Nine Questions sheweth, his Maiesty had another intention in proposing them) his Maiesty layd the charge of writing vpon M. Fisher, at the second Conference when he had dispersed no papers about the particulars of the first Conference; yea the sayd Relation was not penned, nor the penning thereof begun, when the Note of the Nine Poynts was d
                  •
               liuered into his hands. So that it is a meere Fable, that his Maiesty iudged the Iesuits Relation of the Conf
                  •
               rences to be Cretizing and false, &amp; therefore charged him with the obligation of writing.
            And in my Iudgment the Minister is not aduised

in confessing, that according to M. Fishers Relation, his carriage in the Conference was most shameful, That a Schoole-boy of thirteen yeares old,
               
                  Preface to the Reader.
                
               could not haue been more vnskillful, and childish. This Confession, (I say) cannot but be a stayne to his Cause &amp; Honour in the Iudgement of most men, the foresayd Relation being of such Credit, and in substance so exactly true, as none of the Honourable Audience disclaymed from it; yea, which is more, the Ministers Counter-narration ready and prepared, as he sayth, for the print, durst neuer appeare agaynst it. Whereof no doubt the reason is, for that he saw that his printed narration must eyther be notoriously false, with dāger to be proclaymed a falsifyer by the Honourable Audience, or else in substance agree with M. Fishers, which he doth acknowledge to be so much to his discredit.
            Agayne, the Minister (which was the cause M. Fisher published his Relation) had by word of mouth vttered vaunting reportes of his owne victoryes, and of his putting M. Fisher to a Non-plus, by arguments he neuer proposed; yea concerning Controuersyes that were not touched. In his printed Narration, these triumphant arguments could neyther haue been well omitted, nor hamsomely set downe. If he should haue omitted thē, his Credents would haue been scandalized, perceauing he doth delude them by verball Reports which he dares not vtter in print. If he should haue set them downe, the Honourable Audience would haue been offended to see the Cause (as they suppose) of Truth, mantayned by such exorbitant Falshood.
            This is the true Reason he is so silent in print

about the particulars of the Conferēces, only doing his endeauour to disgrace the Iesuit in generall tearmes saying, That he vanished away from before his Maiesty with foyle and disgrace, his Maiesty telling him, he neuer heard a Verier 
               Meaning a Foole or Asse.
                
               &amp;c. A report so false, as the Minister contradicts the same himselfe elsewhere, writing to the contrary,
                  In his Preface towards the end: and Reply to the Iesuits Preface initio.
                That, by the second Conference his Maiesty obserued, that the Aduersary was cunning, and subtill in eluding Arguments. For what more opposite to the Veriest Asse, or Foole, then one cunning and subtill? If his Maiesty obserued by that Conference, that the Iesuit was cunning, subtill, acute in answering, how could he say of him, I neuer heard a Verier Asse? Thus men implicate themselues, that speake what they would haue belieued, without care of Truth. But in defence of the Relation, I need say no more, there being extant an Apology for the same in print.
            Now concerning the Answere it selfe to the Nine Poynts, M. Fisher hauing receaued the note, presently addressed himselfe to comply with his Maiestyes Cōmand, being encouraged thereunto by the Title, shewing his Maiestyes desire of ioyning vnto the Church of Rome, could he be satisfyed about some Poynts. And as he imployed therein his greatest strength, so likewise he was carefull to vse the expeditiō that was required, atchieuing the Worke in lesse then a moneth, though the same was not so soone deliuered into his Maiestyes hands. This expedition was likewise the cause, that he did omit the discussion of the Ninth Poynt, About the Popes Authority to depose Kings. For being bound by the Cōmand of his Generall, giuen to the whole Order, not to

publish any thing of that Argument, without sending the same first to Rome, to be reuiewed and approued, his Answere to that Poynt could not haue been performed without very longe expectation &amp; delay. And he was the more bold to pretermit that Controuersy, in regard that sundry whole Treatises about the same, written by Iesuits and others, both Secular &amp; Religions, had been lately printed: These Authours so fresh and new, he was sure were not vnknowne to his Maiesty, nor was it needfull that any thinge should be added. Also knowing that commonly Kings be not so willing to heare the proofes of Coerciue Authority ouer them, be the same neuer so certayne, he iudged by this omission, the rest of his Treatise might be more gratefull, and find in his Maiestyes breast lesse disaffection &amp; resistance agaynst the Doctrine thereof. Nor could he thinke, that his Iudicious Maiesty, being persuaded of the other eight Points, would haue been stayd from ioyning vnto the Church of Rome, only in regard of the Nynth, Of the Popes Authority ouer Kings; the Doctrine of the Protestant Church about the Authority of the people, and of the Cōmon wealth in such cases, being farre more disgracefull &amp; dangerous. And this forbearance is not,
                  Reply pag. 571. as the Minister obiects, against the resolution of a constant Deuine, or S. Bernards rule, Melius est, vt scandalum oriatur, quàm vt veritas relinquatur. It is indeed, better that scandall arise, then Diuine Verity be forsaken, by the deniall thereof, or by not professing our Conscience therein,
                  Reply vnto the Iesuits Preface initio.
                when we are iuridically examined by the Magistrate; wherein euen the Minister giueth testimony that the Iesuit was not defectiue, but did fully and

cleerely declare his Fayth about the Popes Authority, his Maiesty telling him, he liked him the better, in respect of his playnesse. This notwithstanding, there is no man of Learning &amp; Discretion, but will acknowledge, that a Constant Deuine may put off the Scholasticke Tractatiō of some Poynt of Fayth that is lesse pleasing, vntill the Auditours, by being perswaded of Articles that do lesse distast, be made more capable of the truth, towardes which by disaffection they are not so prone.
            The other articles are largely discussed, and as exactly as shortnes of tyme ioyned with penury of Bookes would permit. They be according to the Note, but Eight, yet some of them contayne diuers branches, and so all togeather they amount to the number of fourteene: to wit, 1. The worship of Images. 2. The worship of the holy Crosse &amp; Reliques. 3. That Saynts &amp; Angells heare our prayers. 4. That they are to be worshipped with honour super-humane, or more then Ciuill. 5. That we may &amp; ought to inuocate thē. 6. That Repetitions of Prayers in a fixed number is pious. 7. The Liturgy lawful in a language not vulgarly knowne. 8. The Reall Presence of Christs body vnto the corporall mouth. 9. Transubstantiation. 10. Merit. 11. Workes of Supererogation. 12. The remaynder of temporall payne after the guilt of Sinne. 13. That holy men by Diuine grace may for the same make compensant, yea superabundant Satisfaction. 14. That superabundant Sati

Before these is prefixed the fundamentall Controuersy of the Church; That men cannot be resolued what doctrines are the Apostles, but by the Tradition and Authority of the Church; About the sufficiency &amp; perspicuity of the Scripture; About the Churches

                  isible Vnity, Vniuersality, Holynes, Succession from the Apostles; That the Roman, is the visible Catholicke Church whose Tradition is to be followed. So that in this Treatise a Summe of all the chiefest Cōtrouersies of this Age is contayned.
            Concerning the manner of hādling these Points, the Minister graunting the Iesuite sheweth himselfe well verst in Controuersy, addeth,
                  In his Preface.
                
               he is deficient of diuine proofe in euery Article, and farre more specious including our Arguments, then happy in confirming his owne. What reason he may haue to giue this cēsure of the Treatise I do not see, but only that he would say something agaynst it, and no better exception occurred: otherwise it is cleere, that in euery Article the Answerer vrgeth not only the Tradition of the Church, not only the consent of Fathers, but also sundry Texts and Testimonyes of Scripture. And he doth not only (which is the Ministers tricke) score Bookes, Chapters, Verses, without so much as citing the wordes, nor only doth he produce the wordes of the Text, but also refuteth the Protestant Answeres, by the rules of interpretation themselues commend, by recourse vnto the Originalls; by the consideration of the Texts, Antecedent, and Consequent; by the drift and scope of the discourse; by Conference of other places, specially by the expresse Letter and proper sense of Gods word. He sheweth that Protestants pretending to appeale vnto Scripture, interpreted from within it selfe, as vnto the supreme Iudge, in very truth appeale from the expresse sentence of diuine Scripture vnto the figuratiue construction of their humane conceyte. For in euery Point of these Controuersyes, they are proued to

leaue the litterall sense of some Text of Scripture, without euident warrant from the sayd Scripture so to doe, vpon Arguments at the most probable, vnto which themselues say, specious Answeres are made, yea vpon the Arguments that haue neyther substance, nor seemelines, neyther forme, nor speciosity in them.
            And this will be more cleerly confirmed by the ensuing Confutation of the Ministers Reply, which agaynst the Answere vnto the Nine Points came forth at last after two yeares expectation. He pretends that his Booke being long before finished, &amp; ready for the print,
               
                  In his Preface.
                
               he stayed that he might cite word by word the sentences of the Authours, quoted in his margent; that so his worke might be more vsefull vnto such as want the benefit of Libraryes. Which excuse to be false his margents proclayme in innumerable places. I should rather thinke, considering the circumstances of the tyme (if his booke was so longe before ready) that another reason stayed the printing thereof. You may remember, that the Catholickes of England by the Clemency of our late Soueraigne during those two yeares had more calme dayes, and a season of some more freedome, then many yeares before they inioyed. Whereby the mindes of Protestants became more free &amp; vnpartiall, more erected to vnderstand the issue of the Controuersyes betweene them and vs, and lesse vnwilling to see the Catholicke Truth, which now they might with lesse trouble &amp; danger imbrace. Wherfore the Ministers booke not daring to appeare in these sunneshine dayes of more sincere and vnpassionate iudgment, was by him reserued to be published, when the Skye should be darkened

with the Cloudes of Persecution, and displeasure, without which protectiō of darkenes it would (per

               hance) neuer haue come to sight.

                  Hidden in barnes, in night abroad they flye.
               
For when former amity and peace with Catholicke Princes began to be shaken, when the Parlament was hoat in petitioning for a persecution of Catholicks with vttermost rigour, then presently went the Ministers booke to the presse, and not longe after (when the Decree for Persecution was enacted) came forth secure and ioyfull,

            And who shall with indifferency reuiew the booke, may find the same had good reason to fly the light, being euery where full of afflictiue Tearmes, and spitefull Inuectiues, which can giue no contēt, but only to mindes dimmed with the extremest passion of dislike, who take pleasure to read not what may conuince and conuert, but what may grieue and gall the Aduersaryes. Wherein the Iesuit hath some cause to complayne, that his Answere being so moderate and temperate, without any sharpe tearmes agaynst Protestants, still excusing their Errours &amp; Mistakings, by the forwardnes of their Zeale; he hath reason, I say, to grieue, that his Treatise written with such Charity, and Modesty, and this not vpon his owne pleasure, but enforced

by his Maiesties Command, could not find in England a proportionable Reply, tending towardes a calme cleering of the truth, but was set vpon by fierce Reproaches, as if he had been vrged to write for no other end, but that a Minister might haue occasion to disgorge towardes him, and his Religion, the bitternes of his gall.
            It is true, that with these reproachful discourses, the Minister hath mingled matters of substance, that is, all the principall Shifts deuised by others, and which he could deuise himselfe, to giue a shew to his Religion, or to obscure the light and euidence of the Catholicke; which had he set downe learnedly and calmely, without the admixtion of so much ragefull Impertinency, his Booke had been of lesser bulke: Whereby also, one good peece of this Reioynder might haue beene spared, to wit, the Censure prefixed before the same.
            My purpose indeed, was to haue passed ouer his bitter Inuectiues &amp; large impertinencies with contempt, and only haue touched what is really of substance: but the request of friends wonne me to the contrary. For they cōsidering, that many be carryed away to their perdition, not by the Ministers learning, but by their opinion thereof, thought it necessary I should prefixe a Discouery of his In-side, in the beginning of this Reioynder, as he hath placed a faire Picture of his Out-side, with diuers glorious Emblems to his Honour, vpon the front of his Reply. In which prefixed Censure, in euery passage thereof matters of substance are handled; yet my principall drift is to make the same a Picture, wherein the Ministers Ignorance in all sorts of Sciences,

&amp; his falsifying of all kinds of Authours is set forth, not with the black Coale of bare verball Accusatiō, 
                  •
               ut with the lightsome and liuely Colours of euidēt Proofe: which that they may be more indeleble, are oyled with commiseration of his blindnes, and of his deceaued Credents, that on him for their Saluation rely.
            In the Reioynder, which is collaterally ioyned with the Text of the Answere vnto the Nine Poynts, the matters of substance in the Ministers Reply, that indeed may breed doubt to men not perfectly learned, are refuted: The difficulty is not dissembled, nor shūned, the same is set downe commonly in the Ministers words, with the whole force &amp; pith thereof summed togeather, the Refutation presently following, not by the sole contradiction of words, but by the oppositiō of reasons. These, as they be ordinarily still of number, so I hope the Reader will find them to be likewise of waight, that pondering them, and comparing them with the Ministers, in the ballance of vnpartiall iudgment, he will easily see towards whom the doctrine not only of Christian Traditiō, but also of the holy Scripture inclineth.
            If any wonder that this Treatise came forth no sooner the tyme being more then an yeare and a halfe since the Ministers Reply was printed; let him consider, that it was a good while after the printing thereof, before the same came to my hands, in regard of my absence &amp; great distance from London. The booke is huge and vast, that to read the same attentiuely tyme and disoccupation is required. The Vastnes thereof was likewise the cause the same could not be confuted Verbatim (which had been

easy) without making a Booke as bigge as Calepine, with great and vnnecessary charges; which also being so bigge, would neuer haue found passage, and vtterance in tymes of difficulty. Hence the Reioyner was forced not only to reade his huge Volume attentiuely, but also to choose and summe togeather what the Reply contayneth of substance, seuering the same from the drosse of impertinent Reproach, which cost him both tyme and labour. Besides about the tyme this Worke should haue gone to the print aboue a yeare agoe, they that should haue concurred vnto the printing thereof, were called to another place by their necessary occasions, and stayd away more then halfe a yeare; in which case we haue not the choyce of Printers, that Protestants inioy.
            Of thee (Gentle Reader) in requitall of my Labours I require no more, then that to the perusing of them thou wilt bring an vnpartiall minde, free from preiudicate opinion, raysed by Pulpit-inuectiues, and Popular Reports; free I say, from human regards, affected vnto the Truth of Saluation, resolued when the same appeares not to be kept from the imbracing therof through the feare of tēporall dangers. If thy mind be thus indifferētly &amp; piously disposed, I do not doubt but after attētiue reading, thou wilt giue the same Censure of the Conferences and Disputations b

Betweene whome you haue pictured foure or fiue oppositions, which deserue to be noted being wise ones; in which shineth your skill in Mysticall, or Symbolicall Theology.

Your Protestant woman hath a Sunne of Glory about her head, to signify that she is In SOLE posuit TABERNACVLVM suum, id est, in manifestatione posuit Ecclesiam suam: Non est in oculto, nō est quae lateat Quid Heretice fugis ad tenebras? quid latitare conaris?

                     On the other side, the Roman Religion (poore Woman) is by you paynted starke blind, with this Vnderscription, Error caecus. Perchance, you thinke she must needes be blind in respect of her old Age, hauing liued in open profession to the world, euer since the Apostles.

Hēce some may suspect this Leuity &amp; Lightnes charactered by her attyre, to be the cause of her great Belly, wherewith you seeme to set her forth: Whereby also you may signify, that she is the offspring not of the Gospell of Christ, but of Vigilantius his Gospell, which was so religious &amp; deuoted vnto carnal Fecundity, that (as doth testify Nisi pregnantes viderint vxores Clericorum, infantesque de vlnis matrum vagientes, Christi Sacramenta nō tribuunt. Hieron. lib. aduers. Vigil. cap. 1. 
                     S. Hierome) her Bishops would not order any Ministers, except first they saw their wiues eyther to haue great bellyes, or yonge babes hanging at their breasts. Though perchance your meaning was by this Embleme, to expresse the blessing of Fecundity, which your Gospell enioyeth in your Worships of the Ministry, who yearly fill the Parishes of the Realme with many nouell Branches of your Leuiticall Stocke.
                  On the other side, you haue done a deed of Charity towards the Roman Womā in clothing her with modest attyre from the crowne of the head, to the sole of the foote: the Feete of your Religion being bare, to signify, perchance, that she is a bare-footed Nunne, or a great Practicant of going Bare-foote in Pilgrimage, and of such Penitentiall works.

                  The third Opposition. The Woman of your Religion is painted with a Royall Crowne in her right hand, holding the same towards her breast, to shew her affection vnto Kings, whome she huggs in her armes (as the Ape doth his yoūg ones) till she presse them to death by extremity of loue.

                  The fourth opposition. The Protestant Gentlewoman holdeth a pillar vnder her left Arme, with a bough of palme in the same hand: whereas the Roman hath on her left hand a Camelion sitting. Your meaning is, that you (forsooth) are stronge &amp; Constant in your Religion, but we weake &amp; wauering ready to change for feare of persecution. Your Constancy indeed is knowne, that you are in your doctrines, as immutable as the Moone. In what point of Religion (saith 
                        Andraeas Duditius. See Epist. Theol. Bezae. epist. 1. &amp; 3. an eminēt Protestant) be they, that impugne the Roman Bishop, firme and constant? They COYNE MONETHLY FAITHS, they are carryed away with the wind of euery doctrine. What their Religiō is to day one may know, but what it will be to morrow, neyther themselues, nor any mortall man can tell. And whereas you make this your Gossippe to haue on her left side the pillar of Religion, &amp; on her right the Crowne; could any thing be more fit to expresse your Church of England? For in her Religion Kings haue the better &amp; vpper hand of God: the Apostolicall sentence, We must rather obey God thē men, is turned backward, her Doctrine is mutable with the Princes pleasure; that she may be better resembled by a Weather-cocke thē by a Pillar. For what constācy can she haue, that preferrs

                  The fifth Opposition betweene these two Women, is in respect of the Tytles that are set ouer their heades; yours being tearmed, Veritas Vniuoca, and ours, Mendacium Aequiuocum. Veritas vniuoca, being in English, Verity taught, by the professours thereof, with one voyce, with vniforme consent, I thinke the Reader will smile at your good Inuention, that you could find no truer Tytle for your Gospell. For what more notorious to the world, then that your reformed Professours are Vniuocall in the doctrine they preach as diuine truth, euen as the builders of Babel were Vniuocall in language, after the diuision of their tōgues? Vnto the Roman Religiō, which doth detest lying about any the least thing, which cōdemnes Equiuocall &amp; Ambiguous speach in the affayre of Religion, in matters of Bargayne, in familiarity of 
                        See the Treatise tending to Mitigation.
                      Speach, why doe you tearme her Mendacium Aequiuocum? Vpon no other ground, but in regard she teacheth, that a Christian, to defend his life and goods from the Tyranny of Oppressours, may sometymes vse ambiguous and reserued speach: A practise expressely allowed in Scripture, as 
                        Gregor. in exposit. l. 1. Reg. c. 16. His verbis ostenditur, quòd Tyrannorum saeuitia atque versutia quandoque est PIA FRAVDE deludenda: sic tamen Tyranni deludendi sunt, vt caueatur culpa mendacii. Quod tūc bene perficitur, cùm illud quod fit asseritur; sed quod fit, sic dicitur vt celetur, quia ex parte dicitur, &amp; ex parte reticetur. sayth S. Gregory. The Scripture sheweth, that the crafty cruelty of Tyrants is sometymes to be deluded by PIOVS FRAVD; so sauing our selues from their malice, that we tell not a Lye: which then is well performed, whē what is done is affirmed, yet so affirmed, as what is done is also cōcealed, the thing being vttered in part, and in part not vttered, but retayned in mind.

For he hath paynted in your Face a fayre shew of Zeale, of Modesty, of Wisdome, of Grauity, specially in your demure looke, Veluet cap, and gray Beard so combed and handsomely composed, as your Wife may seeme to haue had her fingar in the trimming thereof, aswell as in the setting of your Ruffe.

Or if you be Author of the Verses your selfe, some perhaps will attribute these prayses not vnto Truth, but vnto your Fawning, with ouer-fauourable Fancyes, vpon your owne Learning, Triumphing before the Victory, and vsurping a Crowne without right.

                        Hauing thus rayled, yow approach to the Iesuits arguments, &amp; againe skip ouer the first without any syllable of reply. In your solution of the second, grounded on the word accipite, take, to shew both your Grammaticall and Scripturall erudition,

yow write in this sorte: The Iesuit imagineth that all taking is with the hand, and thus he proueth himselfe to be neither good Grammarian, nor Deuine. Virgil saith, illos porticibus Rex accipiebat in amplis, where accipio is to entertaine. S. Paul saith, per quem accepimus gratiam. Rom. 1.5. By whome we haue receaued grace and Apostleship. c. 8.15. Yee haue receaued (accepistis) the spirit of adoption. The Angell said, Ioseph thou sonne of Dauid, feare not to take Mary thy wife, Matt. 1.20. His Bishopricke let another man take, Act. 1.20. Thus yow, very learnedly as yow thinke; so that you dare accuse the Iesuite as neither good Gramarian nor Deuine. Giue Iesuits I pray you, leaue to examine your learning before they yield that you be their maister both in Grammer and Diuinity, as you challenge to be.
                        First, what blindnes is it in yow to say, that the Iesuit imagineth that all taking is with the hand? Doth he not in this place most expressely say, men may take meate out of the hand of another, with their hand immediatly, or with their mouth? He supposeth then, that there is other taking then with the hand; but proues in this text, take, eate, drinke, that take must needes command taking with the hand, not immediatly with the mouth. For (as he saith) in this text, take, eate, drinke, take commands such a kind of taking of meate offered, as is distinct from eating therof, and not inuolued therin: But to take with the mouth is inuolued in eating, and commanded therin. Ergo, in this text, take, eate, drinke, take cannot be vnderstood of taking immediatly with the mouth, but with the hand.
                        Secondly, If the Iesuit were so simple as yow

make him seeme, as to imagine that all corporall ta

                           ng is with the hand, haue yow not very learnedly instructed him of the contrary, both out of Virgil, and Scripture? Virgil, forsooth saith, Illos porticibus 
                                 〈◊〉
                               accipiebat in amplis, the king entertained them in his ample Galleryes, where accipio is to entertaine, Ergo, all corporall taking of a thing out of the hand of another, is not with the hand. The scripture saith, Yee haue receaued grace, the Apostleship, the spirit of adoption, therfore all corporall taking is not with the hand. The Angell said to S. Ioseph, feare not to take Mary thy wife, ergo all taking is not by the hand: yea which striketh the naile on the head, it is written of Iudas, His Bishopricke, let another man take. Might yow not without taking so much paines to shew your learning in Virgil &amp; scripture, haue proued, that all corporall taking is not with the hand, because men many times be taken with agues, and with death, yea some with Ministers wiues. Verily should Deane-ryes be giuen in England according to learning, this your discourse about taking, would deserue this verdict in the Iudgement of all learned

                        Ignorance, because common sense might haue taught yow, that this Decree could not be vnderderstood of Chapters, or Bookes. The reason is, because, to put chapter before booke, and to say no chapter of booke, nor any booke shall be held Canonicall without the Pope, is idle and senselesse. For if no chapter can be Canonicall without the Pope, much lesse a whole booke; so that hauing sayd, that not so much as a chapter be held Canonicall without the Pope, it was senselesse to adde the same of whole bookes. This speach is as foolish as this, should one say, Not any person, nor any whole family came to Church; or as this, He read not one line, nor one chapter, nor one booke; wheras sense would say, not one booke, not one chapter, not one line.

forme and substance. Thus yow: shewing your selfe to haue no species of true learning, whether species signify kind or shape. For heere yow discouer foure simplicityes in matter of Grammer.
                        The first, is the mystery you make about the plurall and singular number of species; as though S Cyprian▪ if he had sayd in the plurall, Alimonia immortalitatis, corporalis substantiae retinens species, should haue fauoured Transubstantiation; wheras now that he sayth in the singular, corporalis substantiae retinens speciem, he doth ouerthrow it. He sayth not (say you) species in the plurall number, meaning the shapes and accidēts of bread, but speciem in the singular, that is the kind or the corporall substance or forme. Now I pray you, what Grā
                           mer doth teach, that species in the plurall number doth signify shapes and externall accidents, and in the singular, kind and substance? had S. Cyprian said plurally that the Eucharist corporalis substantiae retine
                                 •
                               species, why might you not haue interpreted species, kinds, natures, and formes, aswell as now you interpret speciem, the nature, kind, and forme? And though S. Cyprian say speciem corporalis substantiae in the singular, yet why may not we expound shape and semblant of corporall substance, aswell as we might haue expounded shapes and semblantes, had he sayd in the plurall corporalis substantiae species? Verily you are by your aduersary, &amp; by the force of truth driuē into such straites, as you coyne new Grammaticall mysteries agaynst all Grammer.
                        Your second simplicity, is the noting that species in the singular doth signify nature, and kind, as though we were ignorant thereof, or that you could heereby elude the testimonyes of the Fathers we bring, to

                            doth signify shape, and not kind, this rule is infallible, that still it is taken for shape when it is opposed vnto nature and inuisible Essence. When S. Paul exhortes, that not only men haue their inward conscience pure towards God, but also that they abstain ab omni specie mali,
                           1. Thess. 5.22. who endued with common sense will interprete this otherwise, then from any shew or

In proofe hereof I omit, that your sense is both false and senselesse. False, because the wood of the Crosse did not enter into the hart of Christ, nor the yron of the nayles, but only the payne and passion caused by the same▪ and the steele of the Lance though it went into his hart, yet this was after his death, when he could not offer it to his Father. Senselesse, because though the Crosse and nayles had been offered vnto God the Father, yet could they not be sayd to haue been instruments of his Passion, as they were offered. For in that case Christs offering of them vnto his Father, should haue been an action consequent vpon the Crosses instrumentall operation in pay

                        AFTER Grammer and Latin, Children are commonly taught Logicke, or the Art of Reasoning, without which no man can be grounded eyther in Philosophy, or Theology. Your ignorance in this kind, spreads it selfe ouer euery

This I shall make cleere by three Examples, wherof ech inuolueth many arguments, not only of your Ignorance, but also of your Boldnes in talking about things, of which you are totally ignorant.
                     
                        The first Example. §. 1.

                              Reply. pag. 116. Iesuit to prooue against protestants, argumento ad hominem, that the Roman is the true Church, argueth in this sort: That Church from which Protestants receaued the Scripture, is the one, holy, Catholik Apostolike Church. The Church from which Protestants receaued, is no other then the Roman: Ergo, The Roman is the one, holy, Catholike &amp; Apostolike Church.
                        
                        To this argument you reply pag. 116. This syllogisme is peccant in forme, and both the propositions are affirmatiue in the second figure: which I note the rather, because the Aduersary at the end of this Argument, cryeth victoria, saying; An argument conuincing and vnanswerable: I must therefore reduce the same to a lawfull forme and then answere. Thus you. Now vouchsafe to take a view of your manifold ignorance.
                        I pretermit your falshood in charging the Iesuit of saying, that this Argument is conuictiue, &amp; vnanswerable. For the Iesuite doth not so affirme of this argument, but of another, to wit of this: If it be possible, that the Church can deliuer, by full and vnanimous consent, a false sense; then it is possible that in like manner she may deliuer a false text. But protestants cannot say that the Church, by full and vnanimous consent of Tradition, can deliuer a false

You say, in the Iesuits Argument both propositions are pure affirmatiue, wheras his Minor is in part negatiue, to wit, Protestants receaued the Scripture from no other but the Roman. Who feeles not this proposition to be partly negatiue, wherein is denyed, that any Church besides the Roman, is that Church from which Protestants can pretend the Scriptures, to wit, authentically, or by assured perpetuall Tradition, hand to hand from the Apostles? For Exceptiue and Exclusiue Enuntiations, be compound Enuntiations, partly Affirmatiue, partly Negatiue, and as Logitians teach, the Enuntiationes exponibiles. 
                           Exposition of them is to be made into two single propositions, whereof the one is negatiue, the other affirmatiue. So the Iesuites proposition Protestants receaued Scripture by no other Church but the Roman, being exceptiue, is to be expounded by a Negatiue, No Church not Roman, is the Church from which Protestants receaued Scripture; and also by an affirmatiue, The Church from which Protestants receaued Scripture, is the Roman. Hence the Iesuit, as he did conclude in a forme of the third figure called Disamis, his

                           minor being partly affirmatiue, so might he haue concluded in a forme of the second termed Camestres, the same minor being also negatiue in this manner: The Holy Catholike Church is that from which Protestants receaued the Scripture: No Church but the Roman, is that Church from which Protestāts receaued the Scripture: Ergo, No Church but the Roman is the holy, Catholike, Apostolike Church.
                        Your third fault is, not to know the forme of Expository Syllogismes from the common An Expository syllogisme is that, wherein the meanes of proofe is a singular and indiuiduall thing, in which kind it is good forme to argue affirmatiuely in any figure euen in the second. For example this sillogisme: The Minister grossely ignorant in Logicke, replyed agaynst M. Fisher. The Deane of Carlile is he who replyed against M. Fisher. Ergo, the Deane of Carliele is the Minister grossely ignorant of Logicke This sillogisme is in the second figure, and both propositions are affirmatiue; yet if you deny the forme of arguing to be good, you will but confirme the truth of the conclusion. Hence the Iesuit might in good forme haue argued affirmatiuely in the second figure, in this manner. The One, Holy, Catholike, &amp; Apostolicall Church, is that Church from which Protestants pretend to haue the Scriptures authentically: The Roman is that Church from which Protestants pretend to haue the Scriptures authentically: Ergo, the Roman is the One, Holy, Catholike, Apostolicall Church.
                        
                        Your fourth fault is, that yow play the Reformer of Arguments, as Luther did of Churches, that

is, you reiect lawfull and good formes, and in lieu of them bring in vicious and damnable. The Iesuits argument as by yow

                           reformed is this: The Church from which Protestants receaued the scriptures, is the One, Holy, Catholike, and Apostolicall Church: Protestants receaued the scripture from the Roman: Ergo, the Roman is the One, Holy, Catholike, Apostolicall Church. In this reformed argument both propositions are particuler, and consequently the forme of arguing vicious in any figure, as euery Logitian knowes. The Iesuit to preuent this fault made his minor an vniuersall Proposition: For this proposition, Protestants receaued the Scriptures from no other Church but the Roman, is equiualent, or equipollent vnto this, Euery Church deliuering scriptures vnto Protestants is Roman. Wherefore to reduce the Iesuits argument in true forme vnto the first Figure, you should haue made the maior 
                           For as Logicke teaches, In prima Figura maior semper est vniuersalis.
                            
                           Vniuersall in this sort: Euery Chuch that deliuered vnto Protestants the scriptures is the Catholike: The Roman deliuered the Scriptures vnto Protestants: Ergo, the Roman Church is the Catholike Church. If you say the Meanes of proofe in the Iesuits argumēt is Indiuiduall, and so the Syllogisme Expository, &amp; not according to the ordinary forme; why then do you reprehend his argument, as being affirmatiue in the second figure, seing Expository Syllogismes may be affirmatiue in any figure? Are yow a Doctour, a Deane, a Maister in Israell, and know not these things? Being so ignorant of Logicke, were yow so destitute likewise of discretiō, as yow could not keepe your selfe from carping at the Iesuit, as peccant in Logicke? Could you not at least haue been silent about figures and formes of arguing, concerning

which, yow speake no more assuredly, then a blind man of colours?
                        Some may say, that though yow be ignorant of Logicke, yow do not greatly care, because this your Ignorance howsoeuer euident vnto the learned, cannot be made palpable vnto the Ladyes who esteeme yow, and are lead away by yow. I answere: Although your Ignorance in Logicke cannot by this discourse be made palpable vnto Ladyes; yet the falshood of your Religion, euen about your ground and rule of fayth, may be made palpable vnto them. Yow make the rule of Fayth to be not expresse scripture, affirming a thing in so many words (for then the Ladyes that can read, might straight discouer the falshood of your Religion, wherof not one article against vs is expressely deliuered in scripture:) You therefore (I say) make the rule of Fayth to be not only Scripture, but also The doctrine of fayth is eyther expressely or deriuatiuely cō

                            is, That which is most excellent in euery kind, is the modell of the rest; but I trow yow will grant the Scripture to be the most excellent part of Gods word. (2. Pet. 19. August. l. 17. cont. Faust. c. 5.) Ergo the scripture is the modell, and patterne of the rest.
                        
                        This Argument is constans ex quatuor terminis,
                           
that is, hath foure different termes, whereas all true forme of arguing ought to haue only three. Scripture is one terme, Modell and patterne of the rest, a second, Most excellent in euery kind, a third, the most excellent part, a fourth: for it is not all one to say the excellent thing in euery kind, &amp; the most excellent part of many partes. Amongst whole and totall things, the most excellēt in euery kind may in some sort be said to be the patterne of the rest, but amōgst parts, the most excellent is not the ground of the rest.
                        In substantuall Compounds, the substantiall forme is more excellent then the substantiall matter, yet the substantiall forme is not the ground of the matter; yea rather the matter is the ground of the forme, being the fundamentall &amp; radicall cause out of which materiall formes are produced. Who sees not that Walles, Chambers, and Galleryes are more excellents parts of the house, and more beautifull then the fundations? Yet the fundations are more prime, originall, and wheron the Walls, and Chambers depend, and are kept in being. In this manner the word of God as written, is more excellent, in respect of deep and profound learning, then Tradition, yet the word as deliuered by Tradition is more prime, originall, fundamentall; because it is the sole ground and foundation, by which wee know which is the word of God the Apostles deliuered in writing. Hence yow are such a Bungler in Logicke, as yow vndertake to proue one thing, and conclude another. Yow vndertake 
                              Reply 47. lin. 28. to proue, that the foundation of Christian Religion is the word of God, not as deliuered by tradition, but as written: yow

conclude, that the written word is the patterne, and modell of all other kinds of Diuine Reuelations. Now to be the ground of the rest, is different from to be the patterne of the rest; yea the ground of thinges is seldome or neuer the patterne of them. The grape by common consent is held the most excellent of all kind of fruite, and so by your rule, the modell and patterne of the rest; yet the grape is not the ground, the roote, and seed of all other fruite; nor do all other fruite spring and proceed from it.

                           A Christian is built fundamentally on the Rocke, but the scripture is the rocke, (Cardinalis Cameracensis quaest. vespert. recom. Sacrae scripturae.) Ergo, A Christian is built fundamentally on Scripture.
                        
                        I wish that this my Discouery may make you wise vnto your eternall Saluation, as is doth lay open your shamefull Ignorance vnto your temporall disgrace: for here you are so grossely, and togeather vnluckily ignorant, as you are fallen into the very same fault in Logicke, wherof without cause you charged your Aduersary, as peccant, to wit, of making Syllogismes, whereof both propositions were affirmatiue in the second figure. An argument is affirmatiue in the second figure, when the Meanes of proofe is affirmed in both propositions. Your Meanes to prooue that a Christian is fundamentally built on Scripture, is this terme, Built on the rocke, and this is the very thing affirmed in both your propositions. In your maior, Built on the rocke, is affirmed of the Christian: The Christian, or he that is fundamētally built, is built on the rocke. In the minor the same is affirmed of him

that is built on Scripture. The Scripture is the rocke, that is, he that is built on the Scripture, is built on the rocke. Hence your conclusion, Ergo, The Christian, or he that is fundamentally built, is built on the Scripture, is affirmatiue, in the second figure. How fond, &amp; inconsequent this forme of arguing is, you may feele by this of the same tenour, with change of matter.
                        
                           He that is borne in Sicily, is borne in an Iland.
                           He that is borne in England, is borne in an Iland. Ergo,
                           
                           He that is borne in England, is borne in Sicily.
                           
                        
                        This is a folish Sophisme, because concluding affirmatiuely in the second figure, &amp; so is yours. For as it is not consequent, if a man be borne in an Iland, that he is borne in Sicily, because there be other Ilands besides Sicily; so this is no good consequence, A Christian is built on the Rocke, Ergo, on the Scripture, because Scripture is not the only Rocke, the word of God, as deliuered by Tradition, being a rock and ground of Fayth no lesse sure &amp; infallible then Scripture, or Gods Word as written. Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph, and innumerable other holy persons were fundamentally built in fayth, &amp; yet not built on Scripture, the word of God not being then extant in writing S. Irenaeus l. 3. c. 4. doth write, that in his dayes many Nations were Christian, and did diligently obserue the true Christian Religion printed in their harts, and yet had not any Scripture, nor the word of God as written. False then is this negatiue which your argument put into true forme, doth imply; No man is built fundamentally on the Rocke, that is not built on the word of God, as written.
                        
                           Your third argument: Reply pag. 48. 
                           The seed of fayth is the roote and foundation of euery Christian: But the Scripture is the seed of fayth, (Ioan. 20.41.) for it is the word of God. (Luc. 8.11. Ioan. 1.18. 1. Cor. 4.15.)
                        This argument is also an idle fallacy, and sophististicall sillogisme, for both the propositions thereof are particuler; which forme (as hath been said) is vicious, and not lawfull in any figure. This you may perceaue by this argument formed punctually according to the shape of yours, with chāge of matter.
                        
                           The seed of Fayth is the roote and foundation of euery Christian.
                           But the bloud of Martyrs is the seed of Fayth, for it is the seed of the Christian Church. Ergo,
                           
                           The bloud of Martyrs is the roote and foundation of euery Christian.
                        
                        This argument is like yours, and both are vaine, because the Argument being in the first figure, the Maior proposition is particuler, which ought to be vniuersall in this sort.
                        
                           Euery seed of fayth, is the roote of euery Christian.
                           The Scripture, or word of God as written, is the seed of Fayth. Ergo.
                           
                           The Scripture, or word of God as written, is the roote of euery Christian.
                        
                        This argument is in lawfull forme, but the maior therof is false, for euery seed of Fayth is not the roote of a Christian, but only that seed which first breedeth fayth in him, and whereon all other seedes depend. Now the seed which first breedeth Fayth in Christians, is not the word of God as written, but the word of God as deliuered by tradition. For vpon

the credit of Tradition, we know the written word, and without this (ordinarily speaking, and without new immediate Reuelation) we cannot know the Scripture, or written word to be from the Apostles, and by them of God. Ergo, the word of God not as writtē, but as deliuered by tradition, is that seed of fayth which is the roote of euery Christian.
                        The fourth Argument▪ 
                           
                              Reply▪ pag. 48. The Scripture giuen by diuine inspiration, is simply, and without exception to be receaued, and all tradition repugnant to Scripture is to be refused. Hence it followes, that Scripture is a rule of Tradition, and not Tradition of Scripture. This argument proceedeth vpon the supposal of an impossibility, &amp; so is idle, sophisticall, inept. Logitians are taught by their Mayster Aristotle, if one impossibility be admitted, a thousand other impossibilityes, and absurdityes will be thence concuded. You suppose in this argument, that the word of God as deliuered by full tradition, may be repugnant vnto the word of God as written. Hence you inferre, that Tradition is not simply to be receaued, but only so far forth, as it agrees with the Scripture. Your supposition is blasphemous: for the word of God vnwritten cannot be repugnant vnto truth, being the words of the Prime VERITY that cannot deceaue, nor be deceaued. This impossibility supposed, your cōsequence is not good: Ergo, Tradition repugnant to Scripture, is to be reiected, and Scripture to be held only, &amp; simply as the rule of Fayth. For if Gods vnwritten word could be repugnant vnto the written, it would not follow, that the vnwritten word were to be reiected, and the written simply to be receaued; but that neyther the written nor vnwritten were to be credited.

This is cleere, because if God may lye, and deceyue vs by his word of liuely voyce, deliuered by Tradition, why not also in his writings, deliuered by Tradition? What authority doth writing adde to Gods word, that God cannot lye in writing, if he may lye in speaking?
                        I hope I haue shewed apparently these your Arguments, wherein you so much glory, to be not only false in respect of matter, but also fallacious in respect of forme. The same I could shew of allmost all the rest of your Arguments of this your Reply. Is not then the case of your ignorant Proselites most deplorable and desperate, whome you persuade to trust these your halting consequences, rather then the perpetuall Traditions of the Church? You will haue them to make themselues Iudges, not only of what is contayned expressely in Scripture, but also of what is thence deriued by Arguments, according to the rules of Logicke, wherein if they chance to mistake, they erre, and are damned.

First, that it is Pious and Godly to read Scriptures with deuotion, with humility, with submission of iudgement vnto the teaching of the Church, and common Exposition of Catholike Doctours. Secondly, that the practise of reading by Lay people was common &amp; frequent in the Primitiue Church, for the time that the learned Languages were vulgarly knowne, in which tongues the Church neyther now doth, nor euer did prohibit the reading of Scriptures vnto any person. These two things we approue; so that you are vnaduised (might I not say impudent?) in your affirming that, The Papists impudently deny this to haue been a Primitiue practise. No, we deny not the reading of Scripture with due humility, to be pious, or to haue been a primitiue practise, but onely two proud Noueltyes brought in by your Religion. First, that it The very wordes of your brother Iohn in His VVay pag. 126. is lawfull, yea necessary for euery particular man, by the Scripture to EXAMINE, and IVDGE of the things the Church teacheth him. And when A PRIVATE MAN by Scripture reiects and condemnes the teaching of the GREATEST, and BEST CHVRCH that is, his IVDGEMENT is not to be taken as PRIVATE, but as SPIRITVALL, and the PVBLIKE Censure of THE SPIRIT. Secondly, that all, euen Laymen, by diuine Pretext and Ordinance, are bound to read the Scriptures, &amp; to haue them in their vulgar languages.

Thus much we see, it hath already made THOVSANDS so HEADSTRONGE euen in GROSSE and PALPABLE ERRORS, as that a mā whose capacity will scarce serue him to vtter fiue words in sensible manner, BLVSHETH not for MATTER of SCRIPTVRE to thinke his owne bare Yea, as good as the Nay of all the wise, graue, and learned men that are in the world: which insolency must be represt, or it will the VERY BANE of Christian Religion. Behold open Confession extorted vpon the racke of Truth, by which we may perceaue, how fully and handsomely your Doctrine (that it is necessary, and Diuine Ordinance, that euery particular man read Scripture, and by it examine and iudge the Churches teaching) hath made Dagon to fall before the Arke.
                        
                        But leauing the vanity of your bitter vanting, let vs examine what demonstrations out of Scripture you bring for your pretended Diuine Ordinance, which with so much confidence you auerre. If your arguing be idle and ridiculous in this point, wherin yow professe to be so confident, what may be expected of you in other articles? Especially being challenged to shew your vttermost force by your aduersary, affirming 
                              See the Reply pag. 278. that he could neuer find any solide proofe out of Scripture, of this Protestant pretended Diuine ordinance.
                        Your arguments be seauen, drawne from 7. texts of Scripture, in which your Antecedent commonly is eyther false or vncertayne, and your inference ridiculous.
                        
                           The first: The 
                           
                              Act. 8.28. 
                           Eunuch is commended for reading holy Scripture; Ergo it is a diuine Ordinance that ignorant Laymen read Scripture in their vulgar tongue: Your Antecedent is more thē the Scripture doth expresse. I read not any direct prayse of him in this respect: The Text only 
                              Act. 8.28. sayth, he was sitting in his Chariot, &amp; reading the Prophet Esay. But suppose he be commended for his reading (as it was indeed commendable) is it consequent, that therefore euery Christian, by Diuine order and precept, do the like? Is euery man bound by diuine precept, to doe euery thing for which any person is praysed in Scripture? Dauid is commended in Scripture for rising at midnight to prayse God; is this Argument good, Ergo, Euery Christian is bound by diuine precept to rise at midnight? Verily this consequence is as good, yea better both in respect of forme and matter, then is this of yours: The Enunch is commended for reading holy Scripture; Ergo, euery man is bound to read Scripture, by diuine ordinance.
                        
                        The second is: The 
                           
                              Act. 17.11. 
                           Beroeans are called Noble by the holy Ghost for searching the Scriptures. Ergo, we may with great confidence auouch, that it is a diuine ordinance, that all ignorant Laymen read Scripture in the vulgar. A strong argument. The Scripture doth not say the Beroeans read the Scripture in their vulgar tongue, nor doth it tearme them Noble for their reading of Scripture, but for their receauing the word of Paul with alacrity and ioy. Yea the tearme of The more noble, is not giuen them in prayse of their Religion, but to declare the quality of their Gentry: and so Fulke his Bible hath the Noblest for byrth. But suppose the Beroeans read in their vulgar, and be therfore

called Noble, is not this inference ridiculous: Ergo, it is a diuine Precept that euery man read Scripture? Doth not this arguing deserue rather to be laughed at, then answered?
                        The third: 
                              Apoc. 1.3. 
                           Blessed is he that readeth and heareth: Ergo it is a diuine ordinance, that all mē read the Scripture, &amp; that the Church giue thē the Scripture translated into all vulgar tongues. Here you not only argue impertinently, but also detruncate &amp; curtall the text of Gods Word, leauing out words without which the text hath a false and foolish sense. For if all be blessed that read and heare, without mention or care of what, then they be blessed who read or heare Tully &amp; Virgill▪ or the bookes of Knighthood. Why doe you not let the Scripture expresse the thing, which being read or heard maketh men blessed? The Scripture fully and truly cited sayth, Blessed is he that heareth and readeth the wordes of this Prophesy, to wit of the Apocalyps; Which place eyther proueth nothing for your purpose, or else proueth a necessity, that euery man read the Apocalyps, vnder penalty of otherwise not to be blessed. This perchance for very shame you dare not auerre. If you do; what shall we, or may we thinke of Luther, who did neyther read, nor heare, nor belieue the Apocalyps as a Prophesy, or as the word of Nec Apostolicum nec Propheticū esse puto: hunc libellū similem reputo Quarto Esdr

                            God? And what an idle inference is this, He is blessed who readeth the Apocalyps, Ergo, it is a diuine ordinance that euery man read Scriptures? S. Paul sayth, 1. Cor. 7. Bonum est homini mulierem non tangere. vers. 1. Bonum est illis si sic permaneant. vers. 7. Beatior erit si sic permanserit. vers. 40. he is blessed that doth not marry: Is it consequent, Ergo, euery man is bound not to marry? or, Ergo, men cannot be blessed but only such as do not marry? Surely your wife wil see this inference to be foolish: &amp; yet it is as good as yours,

Blessed is he that readeth, or heareth the Apocalyps: Ergo, it is a diuine ordinance that none be blessed but such as read Scripture.
                        The fourth argument; The Galathians read the Scripture; Ergo, it is a diuine ordinance that ignorant laymen read them, and that they be translated into euery vulgar Dialect. That the Galathians read the Scriptures you prooue by the cypher of Galat. 4.24. where the Apostle sayth, you that will be vnder the Law, haue you not read the Law? For it is written, Abraham had two Sonnes. This proofe is very poore. For the Apostle doth not affirme they read, but doubtingly demaunds whether they had not read one particle of Scripture? Also, the question was mooued without doubt only to the learned Galathians But suppose they read the Scripture; is it lawfull thence to conclude▪ 
                           Ergo they read it in their vulgar? If they read it in their vulgar, is it thence consequent, Ergo, euery man is bound by diuine ordinance to read, and this so strictly as the Church may not forbid translations vnto such as abuse them?
                        The fifth place; The Ephesians read the Scripture; Ergo, it is a diuine precept that ignorant Laymen read the Scripture in their vulgar tongue. The antecedent you shew by the cypher Ephes. 3.4. where the Apostle sayth, Reading, you may vnderctand my wisdome in the Mistery of Christ
                           ▪ A seely proofe. Saint Paul doth not say, that the Ephesians read, but only, that by reading his Epistle, they might vnderstand his wis
                              •
                           ome, about the mysteries of grace and Christian Religion. But suppose they read S Pauls Epistle sent vnto thē; doth it follow, Ergo, it is a diuine ordinance that Laymen promiscuously read Scripture? and that the

Church must translate Scripture to that end? This inference as euen as good as this: By reading the Epistles of Saint Peter, one may vnderstand the great knowledge he had of Christ; Ergo, Euery man is bound to read S. Peters Epistles.
                        The sixt; The Colossians read the Scripture; Ergo, it is a diuine ordinance that all ignorant Laymen read the Scripture. The antecedent is by you proued by the cypher Coloss. 4.16. which sayth, When this Epistle hath been read amongst you, cause it also to be read in the Church of Loadicea. This place doth not proue your intent, that they read so much as that Epistle priuatly by thēselues, but only that the same was publikely read in the Church by the Bishop, or the Priest, or some Church officer in the same lāguage wherin it was written originally. But suppose the Colossians read this Epistle priuately by thēselues, what a wooden inference is this, Ergo, euery Christian is boūd by diuine ordinance to read Scripture? Or, Ergo, the Church is obliged by diuine precept to prouide, that the Scripture be translated into vulgar tongues?
                        The seauenth Argument; The Thessalonians read the Scripture; Ergo, the reading thereof by ignorant Laymen is a diuine ordinance. The antecedent you prooue by the cypher 1. Thess. 5.25. which sayth, I adiure you, that this Epistle be read vnto all holy brethren. Neyther doth this text prooue priuate reading of Scripture by Laymen, but only publik reading therof in the Church. But suppose they priuately read this Epistle sent them by the Apostle, is it consequēt, Ergo, all Laymen are bound to read Scripture, and the Church to translate the same into euery tongue? Truly this argument is euen as good as this, God

created heauen and earth of nothing: Ergo Ministers may make arguments of nothing, or make argumēts good that haue nothing in them. Or, as this: In the beginning was the word, &amp; the word was with God, Ergo euery godly person is bound to read the Scripture word by word from the beginning of Genesis, to the end of the Apocalyps: Or, Ergo, Godly persons do nothing els but read Scripture.

                        BESIDES the manifold Errours which you maintaine in cōmon with other Ministers, you haue diuers proper &amp; peculiar to your selfe, and exceeding grosse, wherby you declare how ignorant how are of Theology. I will only discouer some few of them, but those fundamentall, by which you so shake the fabrike of your Reply, as no piece thereof remayneth

                        The first, That vnto Ministers Religious Adoration is due. §. 1.
                        
                        THIS you affirme pag. 224. Where you vndertake to range in order the kinds of vnion with God, vnto which Religious adoration is due. RELIGIOVS ADORATION (say you) primary or secondary is not founded vpon euery kind of vnion, as appeareth in mentall images, but vpon certaine kinds of vnion; to wit; first Personall, as when the Humanity of Christ is coupled with the Deity. Secondly Substantiall, as when the parts are coupled with the whole. Thirdly Causall, Relatiue

                           or Accidentall, to wit, when by diuine Ordination things created are made instruments, messengers, figures, &amp; receptacles of diuine grace, as the holy Sacraments, and the Word and Ghospell, and the MINISTERS of the Church &amp;c.
                        
                        Behold, amongst the obiects that haue such vnion with God, as is a sufficient ground to yield them Religious Adoratiō, you number Ministers, with an Et caetera in the end, perchance leauing roome for your wiues to enter, to be likewise your Consorts in Religious Adoration, as good reason they should. How grosse this Errour is, specially in you, hence may appeare, in that hereby you ouerthrow a great part of your Reply. First you cleerly cōtradict that Principle which so many tymes you set downe, and very earnestly vrge, to wit, that Religious Worship, is due to God only. How can this be true, if Religious Worship is due vnto Ministers? Be not Ministers Creatures? Be they not other things, and persons, besides God?
                        Nor can you say, that when you affirme Religious Worship to be due to God only, you meane primary Religious Adoration, and that consequently you doe not contradict your selfe in saying, that secondary Religious Adoration is due vnto Ministers. This euasion (I say) will not serue your turne, because you declare in expresse tearmes, that all Religious adoration, primary or secondary, is due to God only. Thus you write pag. 322. Whereas the Iesuite doth distinguish two kinds of Religious Worship, the one Primary and simply Diuine, founded vpon the increate and infinite Excellency, which is due to God only: the other Secondary, founded vpon the created Excellency of grace and glory, which is yielded vnto Saints and Angells. To this we reply, that there be no

other kinds of worship, then there be Tables of the morall law; but there are only two tables of the morall Law, the former whereof teacheth diuine worship, and the second humane, ciuill, and of speciall obseruance. And if there be a mixt worship partly human, partly diuine, so much thereof as is diuine, is proper to God, and may not be imparted vnto any creature, Isa. 42.8. Where God sayth, My glory I will not giue to another. Thus you. How grossely doe you contradict your selfe, and implicate in your sayings? Be not Ministers others from God, asmuch as Angells? If then Adoration, and Religious Adoration be giuen vnto Ministers, how is it not Adoration giuen to others besides God, asmuch as when Angells are Religiously adored?
                        Secondly, you haue destroyed all you say in the first point agaynst the Worship of Images, specially pag. 246 where you thus speake vnto vs: If you adore Images outwardly and relatiuely, then you make Images a partial obiect of adoration: but God himselfe who sayth, I will not giue my glory to another, Isa 24.8. hath excluded Images from compartnership with himselfe in Adoration. Thus you All which is proued idle by your doctrine, that Ministers are religiously to be adored. For if no Creature can be compartner with God himselfe in adoration how may Ministers be his partners therin, and challenge Religious adoration as due to thē
                           selues? If they may be religiously adored, &amp; yet not be his partners in adoration against his diuine Edict, My glory I will not giue to another; why not Angells? Why not holy Images? What say you of the holy Sacraments? Be they not creaturs aswell as Images? specially in your opinion, who hold that they be bread, and wine, and Elements vnchanged in substance,

and yet you say, that vnto the Sacraments, and Word of the Ghospell Religious adoration is due, because they haue a relatiue vnion with God How thē is Religious adoration due to God only? If Religious Adoration may redound from Christ vnto his Sacraments, why not from Christ vnto his Images▪ which haue a relatiue Vnion with him, as being resemblances, &amp; representations of him?
                        Thirdly, you haue ouerthrowne and contradicted all you said about the second of the Nine points, to wit, against Oblations vnto the Virgin Mary. In the old Law (say you) not onely Sacrifices, but also Vowes and Oblations were made to God onely,
                           
                              Reply pag. 348. Deut. 23.21. Leuit. c. 24.5.6. This law in respect of the substance is morall; and obligeth Christian people aswell in case of Oblations, as of Sacrifices. Now, by what authority, and right can the Roman Church abrogate this law in whole, or parte, and appropriating Sacrifice vnto God, make Oblations common to God and Saints? Thus you very vainely; not onely in regard that the Text of Deuteronomy doth not say, that Vowes and Promises are to be made vnto God onely, but no more, then that if one make a Vow vnto God, he must be carefull to keepe it; whence to inferre that Vowes and Promises may not be made vnto men or Saints, but to God onely, is ridiculous. The text also of Leuiticu
                                 •
                              
                            saith, that Oblations and guifts are to be made vnto God, but that to God onely, not a word. And to say, giuing of gifts to be proper vnto God onely, is foolish, except you meane gifts and oblations by way of Sacrifice, as vnto the authour of all gifts &amp; foūtaine of Being. For what more daily and quotidian then for men to make presents, and oblations the one to the other,

specially vnto Kings and Princes in testimony of their duty? But as I say, your discourse is vaine, not onely in respect of your idle cyphering of Scripture, but also because your selfe demolish this your Doctrine, by saying, or supposing the contrary, to wit, that Oblations by way of Religion, may be made vnto Ministers. That this is by yow supposed, I proue.
                        To shew that Ministers are Religiously to be adored, you cypher 2. Cor. 8.5. where S. Paul saith of the Church of Macedonia:
                           
                              Reply pa. 224. lin. 26. 
                           They gaue themselues first vnto God, &amp; then by the will of God, vnto vs. By which text you cannot conclude Religious Adoration to be due vnto Ministers, but by arguing in this manner: They vnto whom men by way of Religion and deuotion giue &amp; offer themselues, are Religiously adored, because oblations be Diuine &amp; Religious worship: The Church of Macedonia did by way of Religion and deuotion, offer themselues vnto S. Paul, because he was a Minister: Ergo, Vnto Ministers Religious adoration is to be giuen. This I say must be the force of your argument. For if the Macedonians did not by way of Religion, &amp; deuotion offer themselues vnto S. Paul, how can you shew that by giuing themselues vnto him, they did Religiously adore him, because he was a Minister? Now, if it be granted, that gifts and oblations by way of Religion may be made vnto Ministers, your discourse against Oblations vnto Saints is eueruated, and falleth to the ground. For thus I argue. If oblations may be made to God onely, why are they made vnto Ministers? If they may be made vnto creatures, why not vnto Saints and Angells, as well as vnto Ministers?

If oblations be proper vnto God, how dare Ministers make themselues fellowes with God in this point of his Honour? If they be not proper vnto God, why do you reprooue vs for offering gifts, and vowes vnto the blessed Virgin his Mother? Heere you are so taken, that you cannot shift away, nor euade.
                        Fourthly and principally, by this doctrine that Religious Adoration is due vnto Ministers, you ouerthrowe all you say in the Third point against giuing worship, specially Religious vnto blessed Saints and Angells For if Ministers may be religiously adored with reference vnto God, why not Saints, why not Angells? You alleadge 
                              Matth. 10.14. Scriptures that affirme Ministers to be the messengers of God, and threaten punishment vnto such as will not admit of them. But I pray you, be not Angells Gods Messengers as much as Ministers, yea in a more high, holy, &amp; excellent sort, being all ministring Spirits sent in seruice for them, that partake the inheritance of saluation? Hebr. 1.23.
                        You bring Matth. 10.42. He that shall giue to one of these little ones a cuppe of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say he shall not loose his reward. How can you hence in force, that diuine and Religious worshippe is due vnto Ministers, rather then vnto any poore Christian, Lazar, or Beggar, of whome Christ sayth, 
                              Matth. 25.40. 
                           Whatsoeuer you doe to one of my least ones, you doe vnto me? If Saints liuing vpon earth, that be the liuely images of Christ may not be honoured with Religious adoration, though what is done to them Christ taketh as done to himselfe; what little colour and pretext can you Ministers alleadge, why

we should honour you with Religious Adoration?
                        You produce Galat. 4.14. where the Apostle saith vnto the Galathians; You receyued me as an Angell of God, euē as Christ Iesus. Who seeth not that this maks rather for adoration of Angells then of Mynisters? S. Paul thought the Galathians did much, in that they receyued him as an Angell: But you say, we must worship Ministers, more then Angells, to wit, with Religious Adoration, which is due to God only.
                        To the same purpose, you cite two Fathers S. Ambrose, and S. Gregory. S. Ambrose epist. 26. sayth: Domino def
                                 •
                              rtur, cùm seruulus honoratur; the Lord is reuerenced, when the seruant is honoured. S. 
                              Super Reg. lib. 5. cap. 1. Quam reuerendi sunt optimi Pastores Ecclesiae Sāctae liquet. Dum enim Deo fideliter seruiunt, tanto ei amoris vinculo coniunguntur, vt quidquid eis ingeritur, Diuinae iniuriae ascribatur. Gregory writes, that good Pastours who serue God faythfully are so conioyned with him in the bond of loue, as what is done against them is taken as iniury offered vnto God. How do these texts conclude Religious adoration to be due to your Ministeriall worships rather thē vnto Angels? I pray you Syr, be not Saints &amp; Angells the faythfull seruants of God, his friends? Be they not conioyned with him in loue as much as any Minister? Why then should Religious worship be due to Ministers, &amp; their Et caetera's, and not to Saints, their Reliques &amp; Images?
                        That Saints and Angells be the friends and faithfull seruants of God, we certainly know; that you Ministers be such, how can you make it apparent or certaine? And if you cannot, why may not we argue agaynst your worships as you argue agaynst Images pag. 233. I am taught by learned Vasquez that the Diuell may lurke in Images, and our Aduersary cannot proue that Christ is present, or assistant vnto them. Now it seemes vnreasonable to worship that which may receyue the Diuell,

when on the other side one cannot be certayne that it haue any fellowship with Christ. This your argument agaynst Images is stronger agaynst Religious Adoration of Ministers. For of the Images we are certayne, that they represent Christ Crucified vnto vs, &amp; we feele this their force and efficacy in our harts, when we worship Christ in them But that Ministers may receyue the Diuell, that the Diuell may lurke in them, we are

And of Zwinglian Ministers he sayth, That the Diuell now &amp; euer dwelleth in them, &amp; that they haue a blasphemous breast insatanized, supersatanized and persatanized. See the place in the book of the Tigurine Deuines confess. Tigur. An. 1544. fol. 3. taught by Luther who affirmeth so much of diuers Ministers, and by other Ministers that 
                              The Tigurine Deuines in the place alleadged say: Lutherus cum suis Diabolis. And Zwinglius: En vt hunc hominē Satan totus occupare conetur. Tom. 2. respons. ad Confess Lutheri. fol. 478. auerre no lesse of him That Ministers be Christs fellowes, or haue fellowship with Christ, that Christ is present by sanctity and grace with any of them, you cannot make certaine; yea according to your Tenet, Christ doth not certainly, and infallibly assist the whole Church, much lesse is it certayne and infallible, that he is present and assistant vnto euery Minister. Wherefore seing it is certayne that the Diuell may lurke in Ministers, and it is not certayne &amp; infallible, that Christ is assistant vnto them, we may conclude by your principles, that it is vnreasonable they should be worshipped, specially with Religious adoration, which yet you do require that men yield vnto you, in regard of your vnion with God.
                     
                     
                        The second Errour. That that cannot be the true Church which hath wicked Visible Pastours. §. 2.
                        
                        ANOTHER errour no lesse absurd and sottish thē this you maintaine, to wit, that that cannot be the true Church whose visible Rulers are, or haue been wicked or impious. Thus you write pag. 100. Wicked persons according to S. Augustine, are not indeed and verily the body of Christ: And agayne, they are not in

the body of Christ which is the Church, because Christ cannot haue damnable members. And Bernard sayth, that it is euident, that Christ is not the head of an Hypocrite: but the visible Rulers of the popish Church haue many tymes been, as our Aduersaryes themselues report, not only Hypocrites, but also apparently monstrous and damnable sinners. Therfore the Popish Church cānot be the Catholike Church out of which no saluation is to be had. And agayne. pag. 54. you argue in this manner. They which are not of the body of Christ, nor of the house of God, really and in truth, do not constantly preserue, or faythfully deliuer Apostolicall traditions, nor are they such as the spirit of God infallibly &amp; alwayes directeth in their publike doctrine. But wicked persons sayth S. Augustine, retayne the figure or outward shape of a member, but they are not in truth the body of Christ, Non sunt de compage domus Dei, they are not of the frame of the house of Christ. Ergo. Thus you.
                        How false and absurd this your Doctrine is, I will not stand to shew by Scriptures, and Fathers, which are cleere and plentifull in this point. For though Christ as he is the head and fountaine of sanctifying Grace cannot haue wicked and damnable members that receiue influence from him, yet as he is the head and fountaine of all spirituall gouernement and authority, he may haue damnable subiects and members, and from him power and authority may flow vnto them. But omitting this, I will make your Folly and Ignorance apparent, by prouing that this your argument is inept, in respect of forme; &amp; in the matter so absurd, as you contradict your selfe, you ouerthrow your owne Church, you crosse the maine streame of Protestant Doctrine.
                        First your argumēt euē in respect of form is fond,

for you change the medium or means of proofe, arguing from the time preterite, to the present:

                           Romish Prelats HAVE BEEN Hypocrites, Wolues, and impious Persons. Ergo.
                           
                           The Romish Prelates be not the true Church.
                        
                        Who doth not feele this manner of arguing to be inept, as good, &amp; no better then this?
                        
                           A sucking Child is not a Preacher and Minister of the word.
                           Francis White hath been a sucking Child. Ergo.
                           
                           He is not a Preacher or Minister of the word.
                        
                        Hence, though your paradoxe, that the Church which hath a wicked man for Pastor cannot be the true Church, were true &amp; your tale, that some Popes haue been wicked, were also graunted; yet it is not hence consequent, that the Romane Church is not now the true Church, but at the most that it was not the true Church for the tyme that it had some wicked Pope for supreme Pastour.
                        Secondly you contradict your selfe about the doctrine, that wicked Pastours cannot faithfully preserue and deliuer the true word of saluation: for pag. 52. you thus write to the contrary. The promises of Christ made to the Church concerning his presence &amp; assistance to his Sacraments, preached and administred according to his commandement are fulfilled, when WICKED Persons execute the office, and performe the worke of outward Ministry. For although the wicked, like the Carpē
                              ters of Noahs arke, reape no benefit to thēselues, yet God almighty CONCVRRETH with their ministery, being his owne Ordinance, for the saluation of all deuout Communicants. Thus you. If this be true, as it is most certaine,

then may wicked persons faythfully and constantly deliuer Apostolicall Traditions about matter of Saluation. This sequele I proue. They with whose ministery God doth concurre for the saluation of all deuout &amp; worthy cōmunicants, being bound so to do, by his promise, doe constantly and faithfully deliuer Apostolicall Traditions concerning the doctrine of saluation, and are infallibly directed so to do. This is euident, because when God concurreth with his Ministers to teach the truth, they neuer erre, nor deliuer in matter of fayth and saluation false doctrine: But God doth still and infallibly concurre with them, with whom to concurre he hath bound himselfe by promise euer and alwayes▪ euen to the consummation of the world. Wherfore if God hath bound himselfe to his Church, that he will concurre euen with the wicked Ministers of his word, in their teaching for the saluation of all deuout &amp; worthy communicants, as you affirme pag 52 lin. 18. then wicked persons may deliuer faithfully &amp; constantly Apostolicall traditions concerning fayth and saluation, and are infallibly directed so to do; which you deny pag. 54 lin. 6. manifestly contradicting your selfe within lesse then a leafe.
                        Thirdly, you ouerthrow your owne protestant Church. For if that cānot be the true Church directed by God, according to his infallible promise, wherin wicked men haue sitten as visible rulers &amp; gouernours, then Protestants and all of their communion cannot be the true Church out of which saluation is not had▪ For I hope they will not be so impudent as to deny, but they haue had some wicked mē for their rulers and Pastours. Was not King Henry the eight

ruler &amp; Gouernour of the Protestant Church, and yet their owne Historyes paint him forth as a monster for beastlines, cruelty, and impiety? Was not Cranmer a most wicked persecutour▪ and murtherer of diuers Saints, not only of Catholikes, but of sundry Foxian martyrs who were by him sent to the fire? And yet he was a ruler &amp; gouernour in the Protestant Church. Wherfore the argument which you set in distinct letters, &amp; lines as of speciall weight, may be with the same force &amp; forme applied against your Protestant Church in so many words, only by placing the words Protestant in lieu of Romish.
                        
                           Wolues, Hypocrites, &amp; impious Persons are not the holy Catholike Church.
                           Protestant Prelates and Visible Rulers haue been Wolues, Hypocrites, &amp; impious persons. Ergo.
                           
                           Protestants are not the Holy Catholike church, out of which there is no saluation.
                        
                        Fourthly, what more opposite to the common streame, euen of the Protestant Doctrine, then that that Church cannot be the temple &amp; house of God, in which wicked and impious men sit, or haue sitten as visible rulers? Commonly all Ministers (foolishly (I confesse) yet earnestly) endeauour to proue that the Pope is Antichrist, because he sitteth in the Temple and Church of God, as Christs Vicar, and as her supreme Visible Head &amp; Ruler vnder Christ: which Doctrine you your selfe suppose as certaine pag. 588. were you make this Exclamation: What a misery will it be, if it fall out (as it is certaine it will) that at the Day of Iudgement, the greatest part of English Romistes be found to haue followed the man of sinne, the sonne of perdition, who exalteth himselfe aboue all that is called God, so

that he sit in the temple of God, shewing himselfe as if he were God. Thus you. I vrge not the folly of this your Exclamation, in that it is a fond supposition of the Question, yea a taking of that, as certaine, which not onely Catholiks, but also learned Protestants deny. Your selfe, haue you not lately since the writing of this Reply, approued The Appeale vnto Caesar of Richard Montague. a Booke by Order of his Maiesty? in which that Authour doth often, and earnestly Second part. c. 5. pag. 141. professe, not to beleeue the Pope to be that Antichrist; further affirming that Protestants, out of affection haue been to violently forward to pronounce the Pope is that man of sinne &amp; sonne of perdition: yea that some, out of violent and transported passion no doubt, make it an Article of their Creed; wheras their arguments be so far from the force of demonstratiue, as they are not persuasiue. Thus this Authour in that Booke which you haue subscribed vnto, as containing 
                              See the Approbation I Francis White &amp;c. 
                           nothing but what is aggreable to the publike Faith, and Doctrine established in the Church of England. And yet heere yow say, It is certaine, that the Pope is the man of sinne, &amp; sonne of perditiō; so shewing your selfe to be of their number whome the said Authour in that very place▪ doth rebuke as Omnium horarum homines, Halters in opinions for priuate ends.
                        I omit also your folly in exclaming at the misery of English Romists, for that they adhere vnto your supposed Antichrist, not marking that to cleaue to the Antichrist of your forming, must euen according to your owne principles be singular happines. For Antichrist according to your Tenet, doth sit &amp; gouerne in the House and Temple of God, and so by the same breath wherwith you make men vassals of Antichrist, you make them Gods Domesticks, his

House, his Temple. Will it be misery to be found such at the day of Iudgement? Yea rather the Church of Christ, the Temple of God being onely one, out of which no saluation is had, what a misery will it be at the day of Iudgement, whē by your owne mouth, you shall be conuinced to haue forsaken that company which you confesse to be the Church and Temple of God, through feare of your owne shaddow, and fancy? For what can be more foolish, then to fasten the name of Antichrist vpon the Gouernour of the Christiā Church, who doth dayly professe to belieue in Christ Iesus the sonne of God and Sauiour of the world? who by his Adherents doth more then all the world besides defend, and propagate amongst Pagans his most holy Name &amp; Religion? But to let these things passe, marke how you cōtradict your selfe in saying on the one side that, that cānot be the House &amp; Temple of God which now hath, or in former times hath had wicked Pastours: On the other side that, that is the House and Temple of God, in which the Man of sinne, that is, a succession of wicked Pastours, hath a long while for many ages gouerned, and doth rule and gouerne So hard is it for men blinded with passion agaynst Christian Doctrine, deriued by succession from the Apostles, to run in their passionate conceipts, without falling into the pit of open contradiction, whereby their folly comes to be manifest vnto all men.

The Arrians did not deny the word of Scripture, saying 1. Ioan.

                           I, and my Father are one, to be true morally, and mystically in respect of vnity by singular affection and consent betwixt these three persons. They were Heretikes for denying the truth of these wordes in the proper and substantiall sense, because the same seemed to them impossible. For seing that we might not expound the Scriptures about mysteries of fayth to an easy figuratiue sense, when the same according to the letter goeth beyond the capacity of our vnderstanding, God doth so often

in holy Writ

                        You may perchance excuse your selfe by saying, the words of Christs institution, This is my body, takē in the literall sense, do not inforce, that Christ according to his corporall substance, is in two places at once. I answere, this you cannot say without contradicting not only the word of Scripture (as is proued in the Reioynder) but also your selfe. For you do plainly affirme, that this our doctrine, yea euen Transubstantiation is contayned in the literall sense of the words of the Institution. If (say you) the substance of bread and wine be deliuered in the Eucharist, then the wordes are figuratiue, and cannot be true in the proper sense, because one indiuiduall substance cannot be predicated of another properly. Thus you 
                              Reply pag. 3
                                 •
                              7.: whereupon I thus argue. That without which the word of Christ cannot be true in the proper and literall sense, is inforced, and prooued by the word of Christ taken in the literall sense: But except the substance of bread be absent, and Christ in lieu thereof present, according to his corporall substance, the word of Christ, This is my body, cannot be true in the literall and proper sense, as you affirme: Ergo, Transubstantiation, and the presence of Christ on earth, according to his bodily substance in lieu of bread, is

inforced, &amp; proued by the literall sense of the word of Christs institution. Wherfore to professe (as you 
                              •
                           o) neuer to belieue Christs body to be in two places at once, vntill it be demonstrated vnto you to be possible, is to professe you will not belieue the word of God in the literall sense, about mysteries of fayth further then the possibility thereof can be made euident vnto you. Is not this to professe Infidelity?
                        Secondly, you may say, that when you require that we demonstrate by testimony of Scripture, that a body may be in two places at once, you meane not that we bring texts of Scripture that demonstrate by reasō how this is possible, but only that we bring places that expresly say that, This is possible vnto God. For as you say pag. 438. In the wordes of our Sauiour, This is my body, there is not a sillable concerning accidēts without a subiect, or of a bodyes being in two places at once, or concerning any miracle wrought by Gods omnipotency. I answere, that likewise in this text of Scripture, 
                              Ioan. 1.1
                                 •
                              . 
                           The Word was made flesh, there is not a sillable, that a perfect substantiall nature can exist without proper personality, or that two complete natures can subsist togeather in the same Hypostasis, nor of any miracle done by the diuine omnipotency; yet because this text of Scripture about the mistery of the incarnation cānot be true in the literall sense, except those hard &amp; incomprehensible things be graunted to be possible by diuine omnipotency, we must togeather with the mistery implicitly belieue, that God can separate proper subsistance from complete substantiall natures, that two natures infinitly distant in perfection, can subsist in the same Hypostasis, though the Scripture doth not expressely so affirme. In like

manner though the words of Christ, This is my body, do not expressely say, that his body may be in many places at once, nor that accidents can exist without a subiect by diuine omnipotency, yet because this his word whereon we grounde our fayth concerning this mistery, cannot (as your selfe graunt) be true in the proper and literall sense, except Transubstantiation, and the Presence of his body in many places at once be belieued; hence we must togeather with the reall presence and litterall sense of Gods word, implicitely belieue these miracles to be done. Wherfore in saying, you will neuer belieue them, except their possibility be first demonstrated vnto you, through ignorāce of Theology you professe Infidelity. For to resolue not to belieue seeming implicācies inuolued in the misteries of faith, except they be eyther seuerally expressed, as possible in Gods word, or els demonstrable by reason, is the right way to belieue iust nothing; there being no mistery of faith which doth not imply some difficultyes, the possibility of which is neyther expresly auerred in scripture, nor can be demonstrated by reason.
                     
                     
                        A fourth Example of your Ignorance in Theology. §. 4.
                        
                        I Adde another Example about the Blessed Eucharist, wherein you discouer grosse Ignorance, not only against Theology but euen common sense. And this Example may serue, as a patterne how insufficiently and impertinently you answere the Iesuites argument. The Iesuit pag. 406. argueth in this sort: Christ doth affirme that the Sacrament is truly, really, substantially (not the figure, and effect of his body, but) his

very body: but how can consecrated bread be termed truly, really, and substantially the body of Christ, if his body be not so much as in the same place with it? Thus you answere pag. 406. To the effecting hereof, locall &amp; corporall presence is not necessary. A Father and his Sonne may be absent by distance of place one from the other, yet the Sonne is TRVLY AND REALLY VNITED with his Father, so as his Fathers nature is in him, and he hath right in his Fathers person and state. A mans goods may be at Constantinople, and yet he liuing in England is a true possessour and owner of them, and he may communicate and vse them, and distance of place hindreth not his right and propriety. Now, although there be a difference betweene things temporall and spirituall, yet thus farre there is agreement, that euen as we possesse temporall things being locally absent, so likewise we may receyue and partake Christs body and bloud by the power of Fayth, and donation of the Holy Ghost, according to a celestiall and spirituall manner. Thus you. Now behold how many wayes yow discouer grosse Ignorance in this answere.
                        First, were all that you say true, yet is it impertinent and ineptly brought in answere of the Iesuits argument. For the question is not, whether men may receiue by the vertue of Fayth and donation of the holy Ghost, sanctity and grace through the merits of Christs body and bloud that are absent (for this al acknowledge to happen in Baptisme, and to be possible in the Eucharist, if Christ had so ordained:) The question is about the truth of Gods word whether consecrated bread may be truly and really called the body of Christ, being (as you say) a thing not only indiuidually distinct, but also locally distant from

his body. A man being in London may possesse iuridically an Horse that is in the Countrey, is it therfore true to say, that this man in London is truly &amp; really the Horse in the Countrey? A Merchant in London may haue great treasures of money in Constantinople, and a right to lay them vp in his Coffers at London, may one therfore shewing his empty coffers at London say truly, this is a treasure of money? In like manner, suppose (which is false) that a man hath iuridicall authority ouer Christs body absent, and existing in heauen, to dispose therof at his pleasure, may he therfore be sayd to be truly and really Christs body? May one therefore shewing the Sacrament, being in your Tenet an empty thing in respect of containing Christs bodily substance, say truly therof, This is really Christs body and corporall substance? who will maintaine such absurdities that is sober? Wherefore your discourse that a man may truly posesse a thing absent, serues nothing to satisfy the Iesuites question, how can consecrated bread be truly, verily, &amp; really the body of Christ, if he be not so much as present in place with it?
                        Secondly, what more absurd then what you affirme, that a man may not only in right possesse, but really and truly vse his things that be absent? Can a man in London vse, and ride on his horse that is at Yorke! Or a Merchant in Bristow feed on his grapes that are growing in his vineyard in Spayne? If they cannot (and it is ridiculous to say, they can) how can a man existing on earth, receaue truly and really Christ distant from him, as farre as the highest heauen? Receaue him (I say) not in a signe only, &amp; according to gracious Effects, but euen according to

his body and corporall substance, with their mouth of flesh. For Christ did not say, This is a figure of my body, or, this is soule-feeding grace giuen by the merit of my body and bloud; but, This is my body, euen to your corporall mouth, wherewith I bid you, to take, and eate it.
                        
                        Thirdly, who cā forbeare laughing to heare you so soberly affirme, that the Son that is absent from his Father, as far as Constantinople is from London, is not only morally by Loue and Affection, but TRVLY and REALLY VNITED with his Father? For Vnion is the way vnto Vnity; so that whensoeuer two indiuiduall things are truly &amp; really vnited, by this vnion is made a third indiuiduall thing distinct frō ech of them a part, &amp; from all other indiuiduall things. When soule and body come to be vnited, by this vnion is produced a third substance, to wit, a mā composed of soule and body. When two waters that were seuered come to ioyne togeather, there ariseth one third water, wherin the two lesser waters are included as parts. But Father and Sonne, the one in London, the other at Constantinople, do not compose a third indiuiduall nature constant of thē both, wherin they both are contayned, as is most euident: Ergo, It is ridiculous to affirme, that the Father in London, is truly and really vnited with his Sonne in Constantinople.
                        Finally, put case there were true and reall vnity betwixt Father and Sonne, so that the sonne might be said to be one with his father, truly and properly, in respect of kind, or specificall Identity; what can this serue to shew that consecrated bread, remaining bread in nature &amp; kind, may be said to be the body

of Christ, or the same with it? Had Christ said of another mans body, This is my Body, you might haue cōstrued it thus, This is my body, that is, a body of the same kind and nature with mine; but Christ saying of that which was bread, this is my Body, how can you vnderstand this to be true in respect of specificall Vnity? Is bread of the same kind and nature as Christs body? I am sure, being afore warned of this absurdity, you will not dare so to teach. What then, doth specificall Identity or vnity in nature and kind serue to shew, that cōsecrated bread remaining bread in kind, nature, &amp; essence, may be truly &amp; really Christs body? Certainly Christ did affirme that the thing contained within the shape of bread, was his indiuiduall body, not another indiuiduall body of the same kind. This cannot be true verily, and according to propriety of speach, as you grant, if the substāce of bread remaine, much lesse if also the substance of Christs body be locally absent. The Iesuits argument then doth conuince, that the Sacrament cannot be truly, really, substantially Christs body, if the body of Christ be not locally indistant from the same.
                     
                     
                        A fifth Example, About Satisfaction. §. 5.
                        
                        I will produce yet another Example of your Ignorance, by which you contradict Protestants, yea your selfe in the very same page, and establish our Catholike doctrine of Satisfaction and Purgatory, against which in that place you earnestly dispute. Thus you wite pag. 540. The difference betweene the Pontificiās &amp; vs in this dostrin is, THAT WE BELEEVE A REMAINDER of TEMPORALL Affliction, AFTER

the REMISSION of the GVILTE of Sinne, in this life onely, for Chastisement, ERVDITION, and PROBATION. They maintaine a Remainder of Temporall Punishement, not onely in this life, but after the same in Purgatory. Further, we beleeue, that the Paine of Chastisement inflicted vpon penitent sinners, may by prayers of fayth, exercise of vertue, humiliation and mortification be REMOVED, MITIGATED, or conuerted to the increase of grace and glory in them, that with patience &amp; holines endure the same in this life. But we deny, that eyther any paine followeth iust persons after their decease, or that they can in this life by any good workes, merit release of any temporall punishment, or satisfy the Diuine Iustice for the fault, or guilt of any sinnes on their behalfe, much lesse for others.
                        
                        Thus you▪ On the one side denying, against Catholikes, Temporall Paine in the next life, and on the other, granting against Protestāts a Remaynder of Temporall Chastisement, for sinne remitted after the remission of the guilt. Wherby you contradict your selfe, yea establish the possibillity of superaboū
                           dant Satisfaction. Yow lay Principles which vnanswerably inforce temporall paine for remisse Penitents in the next world; Which three thinges I will in order demonstrate, that so it may appeare, that through Ignorance you haue your selfe dissolued &amp; broken in peeces the whole frame of your Voluminous Reply, in euery poynt of Controuersy proposed by his Maiesty, and handled therein.
                        First, you contradict your selfe; for in this very pag. 540. against the Remainder of temporall paine thus you write: That which is so forgiuen that after pardon it is not mentioned or remembred, and which is cast

behind Gods backe, &amp; throwne into the bottome of the sea, and which can no where be found, and which is blotted out of the Debt-booke of the Almighty, is not taken away by commutation of a greater punishment into a lesser, but by a free and full condonation of all vindictiue punishment. But the holy Scripture, and the Fathers teach such a remission of sinne on Gods part to the penitent. Thus you: what cleerer contradiction can be deuised then is betweene these two sentences, Remission of sinne is made not by commutation of a greater punishment into a lesse, but by free and full condonation of all vindictiue punishment: &amp;, There is a remainder of temporall paine after the remission of guilt of sinne, not onely for the triall and erudition of the penitent, but also for Chastisement, which may be remoued, or mitigated by mortification and penitentiall workes? What clearer contradiction, I say, can be deuised? For tēporall paine inflicted vpon penitent sinners by way of chastisement after the remission of the guilt of their sinne, is vindictiue Punishment. You professe in the end of this page to belieue Temporall paine to remaine, not onely by way of Probation and Erudition, but euen by way of chastisement, after the remission of the guilt of their sinne: Therfore you contradict what you say in the beginning of this page, That remission of sinne is free, and full condonation of all vindictiue punishment.
                        
                        Agayne; Condonation of sinne, wherby eternall punishment is changed into temporall, is remission of sinne, by commutation of a greater chastisemēt into a lesse, to wit, of eternall into temporall, as is most euident. But in the end of this page, you teach, that sinne is so remitted, as the guilt of sinne, and eternall Damnation is changed into a remainder of

temporall affliction for chastisement of the penitent sinner. Wherefore, if the changing of Eternall punishment into Temporall be commutation of greater punishment into lesse; then by granting, in the end of the cited page, a Remaynder of Temporall Affliction, after the remission of the Eternall, you ouerthrow what you taught in the beginning of the same, that remission of sinne is not made by commutation of greater punishment into lesse.
                        
                        Secondly, this your doctrine of the remainder of temporall paine, after the remission of the guilt of sinne, proueth that penitent saints may make compēsant, yea superaboundant satisfaction, in manner as Catholikes teach; for in the remainder of temporall affliction we may consider, and distinguish two things; the greatnes of the paine reserued, and the greatnes of Gods remaining anger against sinne remitted, which he doth yet temporally punish. If we regard the greatnes of Gods iust anger and offence, we hold Si ad ipsam offensam Diuinae Maiestatis respiciamus, quatenus Deus videlicet sic homini manet infēsus, vt merit
                                 •
                               velit illū subire malū Poenae Temporalis; non potest pro eiusmodi offensa fieri iusta &amp; prorsus aequalis compensatio à nobis. Nam illa offensa habet ex parte Diuinae Maiestatis quandam infinitatem. Gregor. de Valent. Tom. 4. in D. Tho. disput. 7. q. 14. punct. 1. col. 1756. that no compensant, or equall satisfaction is made in this respect, the offence hauing a kind of infinity from the infinite maiesty of the person offended. But if we regard the greatnes of the penalty reserued, a man may remoue the same by satisfaction compensant, yea superaboundant. This may be made euident by examples. Let vs suppose the remainder of Temporall affliction reserued, be equall vnto the paine of forty dayes fast in bread &amp; water in one whole yeare, why may not a iust man fast in this manner forty dayes in a yeare, &amp; so offer vnto God satisfaction iust &amp; equall? Also why may he not fast fifty dayes in a yeare with onely bread and water, &amp; so offer satisfaction superaboundant?

Superaboundant, I say, not in respect of the Maiesty of God offended, but in respect of the temporall reserued punishment: So that granting, as you do, a temporall remainder of chastisement after the remission of sinne, to be remoued or mitigated by penitentiall workes, if you be in your right iudgment, and ponder the matter, you cannot deny (as you do) that compensant and superaboundant satisfaction may be made for the same.
                        Thirdly, this your doctrine doth euidently inforce Temporall and Purgatory paines in the next life. This I proue. Vnto sinnes of equall offence and heynousmes against God, remitted by the same measure of faith and contrition, the same punishment is due in iustice, after the remission of the guilt. For God being iust, doth neuer punish sinne remitted with more or longer affliction then it deserues: Go
                                 •
                               forbid (sayth 
                              Iob. 34.10.11. 
                           Iob) that there should be impiety in God, or iniquity in the Almighty. For he will repay vnto man his owne worke, and render vnto euery one according to their wayes: nor in punishing the remitted sinnes of his seruants is he an acceptour of persons. Hence vnto euery sinne, as great as Dauids, remitted vpon no greater contrition then had Dauid, as great temporall punishment is in iustice due, &amp; shallbe inflicted▪ as was inflicted vpon Dauid for his remitted sinne▪ This being euident, I assume: But we see innumerable penitent men who haue committed greater sinnes then Dauid, and yet haue not had greater, nor so great measure of faith, nor of sorrow and contrition for their sinnes as had Dauid, that dye presently afte
                              •
                            their repentance, without enduring eyther by Diuine infliction, or by voluntary assumption, such

grieuous temporall afflictions, as Dauid did: Therfore innumerable penitent Saints depart this life, being obnoxious vnto as great, or greater punishment, after the remission of their sinns, as Dauid did endure after the remissiō of his. This supposed what shall become of these men? They cannot go to hell, the guilt of sin, &amp; of eternall damnation being gratiously remitted vnto them. They Non introibit in eā aliquid coinquinatum Apoc. 21.27. cannot go presently to heauen, for no stained thing, that is, no person vnto whome punishment is due in iustice, can enter into that seate of pure Reward, Ioy &amp; Felicity· Wherfore, seing you say, that vnto sinne remitted a certaine measure of temporall paine is due, to be remoued or mitigated by workes of mortification, it is forcible, that you also admit temporall Purgatory-paines in the next life, for them that dy before this debt of temporall chastisement be satisfyed in this world.
                     
                     
                        Your Ignorance about the holy Crosse, and the Water of Iordan. §. 6.
                        
                        CONCERNING the Holynes and Honour of our Sauiours Crosse, you shew want of iudgement in Theology. That the liuelesse &amp; insensible Crosse, (say you, pag. 235.) whereupon Christ suffered, was sanctifyed by his Passion, must be belieued when Diuine Ordinance is produced to make the same manifest. And agayne, pag. 236. Those thinges which at the instant tyme of Christs Passion had a residence in his body, and were ioyned thereunto (per contactum physicum,) as instruments of his passion, were not thereby made most highly Venerable, because there is no Diuine Authority, or any other sufficient reason to prooue this assertion. In these

words you shew great Ignorance of Christian Theology, yet such as is common to those of the Puritan stampe, A Malignant Generation 
                              See the Appeale vnto Caesar, which our Doctour warrants, as contayning nothing, but Catholike English doctrine. pag. 281. The Crosse is as much vilifyed by furious Puritans in these dayes, as euer it was by Pagans in the dayes of the Fathers.
                            agaynst the Crosse of our Redeemer. Wherefore I should not account to deny Sanctity vnto the Crosse notable in you, did you not presently in the very same page attribute Holynes and Sanctification vnto the ground wheron Moyses stood, &amp; vnto the water of Iordan. Thus you write▪ 
                           Whiles God appeared to Moyses in the Bramble ush, the ground wheron Moyses stood is called holy. Exod. 3.6. But this Holynes being, only relatiue, transitory, and denominatiue, and not inherent and durable, the former vision and apparition being finished, the ground wheron Moyses stood returned to his old condition. The like may be sayd of the water of Iordan, considered when Christ was Baptized with it, and agayne considered when his baptisme was finished, and out of the vse. Thus you.
                        Now I pray you, what reason can you assigne why the Land whereon Moyses stood, was Sanctifyed, and made Relatiuely Holy▪ during the tyme of the Diuine apparition, &amp; not the Crosse, at the least, for the instant tyme of our Lords Passion theron? You wil say that no Scripture doth warrant the tearming of the Crosse Holy, wheras the land wheron Moyses stood, is called Holy, Exod. 3.6. But what want of vnderstanding is this, not to see how the Scripture tearming the ground wheron Moyses stood Holy, &amp; cō
                           manding him to put off his shooes out of reuerence vnto it, because confining on the Bush wherein God appeared, or rather an Angell bearing his person? What blindnes (I say) is it not to see, that this very Text doth à fortiori, more strongly &amp; forcibly warrant the tearming the Crosse holy and venerable, &amp;

                        If any demand, why the Crosse is stil worshipped after it ceased to touch our Sauiours body, and no

I say lawfully, for if the same be vulgarly vsed vnlawfully, and in contempt, it looseth not sanctity, but is still holy de iure, and hath a right to be venerably vsed. Now the ground whereon Moyses stood, the apparition being finished; the water of Iordan, our Sauiour

                              our distinction of outwardly, relatiuely, transitorily vnto Images? Agaynst such loose, and voluntary presumption wee say with S. Chrysostome Diuinae scripturae testimonia sequamur, neque feramus eos qui temerè quiduis blaterant: We are to follow 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              , testimony of Diuine Scripture, and not to regard them which as Rouers, &amp; without ground blatter out what they please.
                        
                        Behold how bitter you are agaynst the Iesuit: And why? Is it for his vsing distinctions that are not verbally, and expressely found in Scripture? Then you are blind not to see your selfe to be guilty of the same fault: for where do you find in Scripture the tearmes of relatiue, transitory, &amp; denominatiue

holines? Is it, because his distinction of Absolute and Relatiue worshipp is not to be proued by Scripture, as yours may? Thē you are so shallow in your thoughts as not to perceaue a thing, not only cleere in Scripture, but also neere to your selfe. When the Scripture sayth,
                              Matth. 4.10. 
                           Adore thy Lord God, what is this, but absolute, and inward affectuous worshippe? When the same Scripture sayth, Bow thy selfe to the footestole of his feete, for he is holy, what is this, but relatiue worshipp,
                              Psal. 98.5. that is outward bowing before Gods footestole, inwardly referred vnto his person?
                        Yea the Iesuits Relatiue worshipp of inanimate thinges that haue outward reference to God, is proued by the very text by which you proue the relatiue holines of the same, Exod. 3.6. Put off the shooes of thy feete, because the ground whereon thou standest is holy. The land whereon thou standest is holy; Behold relatiue holines: Put off thy shooes, &amp; presume not to touch the same but barefote; Behold relatiue worshipp, that is outward respect to the land, inwardly referred to worshipp God there appearing. What shall I say more? the Iesuits distinction is so cleere and neere vnto you, as it is not only thus to be proued by your very text of Scripture, but also intrinsecally inuolued in your distinction, as by this argument I demonstrate.
                        Vnto thinges that be holy, Honour and Veneration is due, and this of higher or lower kind, according to the state and degree of their holynes. This proposition no man that knoweth what he sayth, will deny.
                        But (as you distinguish) there be two kinds or states of holy thinges, some being absolutely &amp; inherently

holy, other only relatiuely and outwardly.
                        
                           Ergo, There are two kinds of worships due vnto holy thinges, the one inward and absolute, the other only relatiue and outward.
                        And, that the image of Christ is Relatiuely holy, as hauing an outward visible reference vnto a person, inwardly and infinitly holy, you can not deny, except you want eyther notice of the Gospell, or eyes in your head. You may then see, how wrongefully you vp brayd the Iesuit with loose and voluntary presumption, with blattering out at Rouers what he pleaseth, and how iustly he might turne the

                           e. For some two pages before this your reprochfull

words, to wit pag. 89. you thus distinguish about Traditions: The Church hath no perpetuall Traditions but such, as are EYTHER contayned in Scripture, OR which are subseruient to MAINTAINE the Fayth, Verity and AVTHORITY of the Scripture, &amp; the doctrine thereof. Thus you.
                        I demand of you; These subseruient Traditious about fayth and doctrine, be they contayned in Scripture or not? If they be your distinction is senselesse, one member thereof not being condistinct agaynst the other: for if subseruient traditions be traditions cōtayned in Scripture, what more inept then to say, traditions eyther contayned in Scripture, or subseruient? If they be not contayned in Scripture, but condistinct from them, then according to your distinction there be some traditions, not contayned in Scripture, which maintayne and vphold the authority of Scripture, and the verity and doctrine thereof. If you grant this (as you must, vnlesse you will grant your distinction be voyd of iudgment) then must you also grant tradition to be more fundamentall then Scripture. For thus I argue: That which is the ground of the authority of Scripture, is more fundamētall then Scripture: That which doth mantayne, and vphold the authority of Scripture, is the ground and foundation of the authority of Scripture: Ergo, That which doth vphold and mantayne the authority of Scripture, is more fundamentall then Scripture. Now your selfe ascribe vnto Tradition subseruient, condistinct agaynst written Tradition, the office of mantayning the authority of Scripture. So that, eyther you know not what you doe write, or else by your owne distinctions you are conuinced

to establish that very doctrine which elsewhere you so sharpely censure, as Antichristian, impudēt, prophane, bastardly. Certainly you are a seely Disputant about matters of Theodogy.
                        No more sense or iudgement is there in the distinctiō you make of holy Belieuers into triumphant &amp; militant pag. 49. The tearme (Church) (say you) is taken in the holy Scripture for the vniuersall number of holy belieuers in all ages: and more strictly for the whole number of holy belieuers vnder the new Testament, Hebr. 12.23. Apoc. 5.9 Ephes. 5.25.27. And thus it comprehendeth both the Church militant &amp; triumphant. Thus you: distinguishing the Church of belieuers into militant and Triumphant; whence it is consequent that the Triumphant Saynts in heauen are belieuers. What more ridiculous, and agaynst the prime and knowne Notion of Triumphant Saynts? It may be God permitted you to stumble vpon this grosse simplicity, through want of reflexion, that you might thereby be warned to reflect vpon the foulenes of another doctrine, which wittingly &amp; willfully you mantayne, though being no lesse exorbitant then this. The doctrine is, that your Protestant Militant Church is a multitude, who

This is against the context and order of the sentences of Gods word; this sentence, He that eateth this bread shall liue for euer, being fiue sentences or verses after this other, Vnlesse you eate the flesh and drinke the bloud. Yea these words, he that eateth this bread liueth for euer, are absolutely the very last, wherewith Christ shutteth vp his discourse about Sacramentall taking his flesh and bloud. Wherfore not to be forced to grant, that Christ promised as much to the eating of Sacramentall bread onely, as to eating and drinking both, you are forced to deny the text, and context of Gods word. If you say, our Sauiour indeed spake the wordes, He that eateth this bread, shall liue for euer, but that he spake not of Sacramentall bread, nor of Sacramentall eating; I reply: First, why then did you not acknowledge this text aswell as this other; If any eate this bread, he shall liue for euer? Secondly you contradict your selfe, for that the seauēth Chap. of S. Iohn speaketh of Sacramentall eating &amp; drinking, your selfe affirme many tymes in this Reply, as pag. 395. lin. 8. pag. 406. lin. 13. &amp; pag. 466. lin. 20.

There the Iesuit saith, that euen in the dayes of Antichrist, the Church shall be visibly vniuersall, referring himselfe for proofe to the Apocalips 20. v. 8. You in lieu of the eight verse, cite the seauenth, Then shall Satan be let loose, &amp; shall goe forth, and seduce nations which are vpon the foure corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, &amp; shall gather them into a battaile, the number of whō shall be as the sands of the sea. Which

text is impertinent. For it proueth that the army of Antichrist, shall be for multitude of men innumerable; Not the vniuersall diffusion of the Christian Church in his raigne. Why stopped you at the sea

                           Our Answere (say you, pag 412.) is, that these words 
                           
                              •
                           ll things are possible to God, are referred to the latter

                                 〈◊〉
                              . All things agreable to truth, and which God will haue

done, are possible: but that it is agreable to truth for a Camell, retayning his quantity, with the whole body to passe through a needles eye, or that God will haue this to be done, deserueth to be credited, when the Aduersaryes prooue it by diuine Reuelation, or by other demonstration. Thus you forced by your aduersary to deny the expresse word of God, as I demonstrate by three arguments.
                        First, if our Sauiour hauing named many thing
                              •
                            as difficile, hard, and impossible with men, conclude that not one of these things only, but al are possible with God; then to say, that one of the things only, &amp; not all are possible to God, is directly to contradict our Sauiour, &amp; to giue him the lye. Our Sauiour hauing named many things as hard, difficile, and impossible vnto men, to wit, that Camells passe throgh a needles eye, and that rich men enter into the Kingdome of heauen, concludeth, that not one of these things only, but all are possible vnto God, apud Deu
                                 •
                               omnia possibilia sunt, 
                           Matth. 19.16. Mar. 10.27. all these hard, and difficile things are possible with God. Ergo, you in saying that one sort of these things by him named as hard &amp; difficile, are impossible vnto God, to wit, that Camells passe through a needles eye, do directly contradict the words of our Sauiour, &amp; giue him the lye.
                        Secondly, to affirme that a Camells passage through the eye of a needle is impossible vnto God, is more directly agaynst this speach of our Sauiour, then to say, that a rich mans entrance into heauen is impossible. This I prooue. If our Sauiour say, that of the two, the Camells passing through a needles eye is more easy, that is lesse difficile, then to deny the Camells passing through a needles eye to be possible vnto God, is more directly agaynst our Sauiours

                           
                              •
                           ord, then so to affirme of a rich mans entring into

                            Kingdome of heauen. For if things more easy &amp; 
                              ••
                           sse difficile be impossible, how much more things 
                              ••
                           sse easy and more difficile? If we may with truth 
                              •
                           ffirme, that God cannot do what by the truth of his word we know to be more easy, much rather may we affirme, God cannot doe what by the truth of his word we belieue to be more difficile. This is cleere. 
                              •
                           ut our Sauior saith most expresly, that it is more ea

                           y vnto a Camells passing through a needles eye, &amp; not vnto a rich mans entring into heauen, then you do directly oppose the truth of Gods word: But that 
                              •
                           his speach, All is possible vnto God, is in this manner 
                              •
                           eferred vnto the Camels passing through a needles eye, &amp; not vnto the rich mans entring into heauen, 
                              •
                           s euident by the drift of this place: For our Lord by this discourse, doth directly intend to shew not a rich mans saluation to be possible, but the Apostles argument which moued them to dispayre of the saluation of richmen, not to be good. They hearing our Sauiour say, it is more easy for a Camell to passe through a needles eye, then that a rich man enter in the Kingdome of heauen, supposing in their thought as most certayne, that a Camells passing through a needles eye,

was altogeather impossible, concluding, What richman then can be saued? Our Sauiour answering vnto the argument that so perplexed them sayth, though these things be impossible with men, yet all is possible vnto God. As if he had sayd: What you suppose in your thoughts as certayne, that a Camell cannot passe through a needles eye, is false; because God is omnipotent, and so though such things be impossible with men, yet all is possible vnto him. Now your supposition being false, your argument that richmen cannot be saued, is not solid. For from my words, it is more easy for a Camell &amp;c. you can only inforce, that as the Camell cannot passe through a needles eye, but by the ompotēcy of the diuine hand; so the richman cannot be saued, but by the omnipotency of diuine grace. Hence it is euidēt that our Sauiour did directly intēd to teach the possibility of a Camells passing through a needles eye; so destroying the ground on which the Apostles did build their false persuasion, that rich men could not be saued. But this you auouch not to be possible vnto God. Therefore you are forced by the Iesuit to deny Gods expresse word, howsoeuer you bragge, that the Iesuits arguing from Scripture, is wonderous weake.

                        THE Iesuite pag. 409. thus argueth: If the body of Christ being mortall and passible, could penetrate with the body of his blessed Mother, and come out of her wombe, the same still remaining entyre, as we confesse in the Creed, Natum de MARIA Virgine; why then may not the same body being now glorious, &amp; immortall, and (as the Apostle speakes) spirituall, penetrate the quantity of

                           S. Aug. doth testify. It was sayth he) necessary, that he whome the fayth, not the lust

of his mother had cōceiued, should also be borne of a Virgin. For if the integrity of his mother had been brokē in this being borne of her, then had he not been borne of a Virgin, and then (which God forbid) false were the beliefe of the whole Church professing in the Creed, Natum de Maria Virgine, borne of the Virgin Mary. The same is taught by the rest of the Fathers, namely by S. 
                           
                              Ambros. Epist. 81. De via iniquitatis poduntur dicere, Virgo cō
                              cepit, sed non Virgo generauit. 
                           Ambrose, who tearmes it wicked &amp; peruerse to say, as you do, that in her generation, the blessed Mother was incorrupt and entyre, not in her childbirth. She (sayth S. Ambrose) that could conceaue him being a Virgin incorrupt, could she not bring him forth remayning a Virgin incorrupt? If they will not belieue the tradition of Priests, let them belieue the oracles of the Prophets: 
                           Non concepturam tantummodo Virginem, sed &amp; parituram Virginem Propheta dixit. 
                           A Virgin shall bring forth a Son: Let thē belieue the creed of the Apostles, which the Romā Church doth purely &amp; inuiolatly keep, to wit, which sayth, not only conceaued by the holy Ghost, but also borne of the virgin Mary,
                        
                        What you obiect out of S. Luke, vers. 23. Euery Male-child that openeth the wombe shall be holy vnto our Lord, hath been answered longe agoe, and declared by the anciēt Fathers. For the Scripture by the child opening the wombe, vnderstands the Child that comes first out of the wombe, because that Child commonly doth, &amp; by course of nature must, needes open the wombe. Hence he is tearmed, the Child opening the wombe, though it happen that he do not opē the wōbe. As the fire of the Babilonian fornace may be tearmed a thing which cōsumeth what is cast into it, because commonly it doth so, and by course of nature it must needes do so, though there by diuine Miracle the contrary did happen; which manner of speach is so vulgar, as it is by you vsed euen in this

Now you may crow, and crake, &amp; crowne your Booke, as you do in your Picture, when you are so pressed by your Aduersary, that you are forced to defend your Errour by holding ancient Heresyes, and by laying the tearme of Sophisticall Inference vpon the Catholicke Fayth of the Creed, and of the whole Christian Church.
                     
                     
                        In answering Scriptures, you contradict your selfe, and grant the Iesuit the Question. §. 4.
                        
                        THE vanity of your former brag, that the Iesuit hath proued nothing by Scripture, is further made apparent in that he doth so vrge you with Scripture, as you are sometimes forced to contradict your selfe, sometimes to grant as much as he doth

require against your selfe. The Iesuit pag. 98. proueth that the Church of Christian pastours succeeding the Apostles, is infallible in her Tradition, because our Sauiour saith, Matth. 28. Behold I am with you all dayes vntill the consummation of the world. You answere pag. 100. That which is promised vpon condition is not absolute vntill the condition be fulfilled. The presence of Christ is promised to the Apostles successours conditionally, and as they were one with the Apostles by imitation &amp; subordinatiō: that is, so farre as they walked in their stepps, &amp; conformed their doctrine and ministery to the patterne receiued from them. Thus you in this place. But pag. 174. lin. 21. speaking of the absolute perpetuity and duration of the Church you say, that the place Matth. 28.20. Behold I am with you all daies vntill the end of the world, proueth, that the Church is vniuersall in respect of time, and that it continueth successiuely in all ages.
                        
                        This your saying ouerthrowes what you said, that the presence of Christ is promised vpon condition, wherin the successors of the Apostles might faile For this place, Behold I am with you all dayes vntill the worlds end, doth shew the Church to be alwaies in the world; no other wayes, then because Christ according to his promise, is alwaies, and all dayes to the worlds end with his Church, &amp; he cā not be still in the world with his Church, except his Church haue still a being in the world. So that according to the truth of this place, we may aswell, or better say, the Church shall not be alwaies in the world, then that it shall be in the world without Christ, or his Diuine assistance to teach men infallibly the truth. Wherfore if by this place we cannot, as you say we cannot, proue, that the Church shall be euer absolutely

assisted of Christ, much lesse doth this place conuince that the Church shall be alwaies in the world, or further then conditionally if it walke in

                           THE Iesuit pag. 38. accuseth Ministers of abusing the word of God, who to proue the sole sufficiency of Scripture in respect of all men, cite the text of S. Paul 2. Tim. 3.15. The Scriptures are able to make vs wise vnto saluation. For the words of the Apostle are directed particulerly to Timothy, saying, they are able to make THEE wise vnto saluation: whence it is consequent, that the Scriptures were sufficient for Timothy, and are sufficient for such men as Tymothy was, to wit, for men learned and aforehand instructed by word of mouth, and therupon firmely beleeuing all the most maine and necessary points of Christian doctrine and discipline. That the Scriptures for men in this manner taught and grounded in fayth, are aboundantly sufficient, who will deny?
Thus the Iesuit. Vnto whom you shape this answere pag. 39. Although sentences of holy Scripture are sometimes restrayned to the personall and particular subiect of which they are first spoken; yet this is not generall, and when the same hapneth it must be proued by better arguments then by the bare Emphasis of a word.

Shew (I say) some reason that obligeth Iesuits to accept of your interpretations of Scripture, which they can proue to be sottish and senselesse, so cleerly, as you cannot answere▪ or else confesse that the Iesuit by conference of texts, by consideration of Antecedents &amp; Consequents, by the drift of the place▪ hath so conuinced your expositiō of falshood, as you haue not a word to reply in good sense, but to be rid of his vrging, you send him vnto God for an Answere.
                     
                     
                        Your innumerable grosse Impertinencyes in cyphering, and scoring of Scriptures. §. 7.
                        
                        YOV haue a manner of arguing proper to your selfe, at least which I find by none of your ranke more frequently vsed, then by your selfe. This is to set downe a conceit of your owne wordes, suting with your owne humour, and then to score Bookes, chapters, and verses of Scripture on heapes, without relating the words, as if your conceit were in those places recorded in so many syllables. And because in this kind of cyphering, consists the strength of your whole booke, I will by some store of examples decypher the grosse vanity thereof, and consequently of your whole Booke.
                        First, you often cite texts and chapters of Scripture that are not, so making your selfe like vnto God qui vocat ea, quae non sunt. Pag. 10. lin. 24. to prooue that Protestants acknowledge the lawfull authority of the Church, you cite 2. Thessal. cap. 5. Wheras the second to the Thessalonians, hath only three chapters. Pag. 106. lin. 17. to prooue that Christians may depart from the Christian Church, wherof they are

King. 19.11. And he sayd, go forth and stand vpon the mountayne before the Lord, and behold the Lord passed by. Pag. 106. lin. 16. to proue that Christians may separate from all Christian Churches, and beginne a new Christian Church of themselues, you cypher 2. Cor. 6.14.

which saith, Be not yoked togeather in marriage with Infidells. Pag. 223. lin. 4. to proue that in adoration, Christ &amp; his Image haue no agreement, you cypher 2.

But speaking the truth in loue, you may grow vp to him in all thinges, who is the head, euen Christ. To the same intent in the same place you cypher 1. Iohn. 1.3. That which we haue seene and heard, we declare vnto you, that you may haue fellowship with vs, and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Sonne Christ Iesus. Pag. 546. lin. 1. to proue that the reward of works may be giuen of free bounty, and not of debt, you cite Psalm. 127. v. 2. It is vayne for you to rise vp early, or to sit vp late, to eate the bread of sorrow, for so he giueth his beloued sleep. Also to the same purpose, you cypher Ezech. 29. v. 18. Euery head was bald, and euery shoulder was pealed, yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus. Pag. 551. lin. vlt. to proue that the B. Virgin said the Lords Prayer, or Pater Noster, whereof one petition is, Forgiue vs our trespasses, you cite Act. 1.14. They continued in prayer and supplication togeather with the women, and Mary the Mother of Iesus. Which text proueth the Virgin prayed; but that her prayer was vocall, and not pure mentall, and if vocall, that she sayd Pater Noster, rather then Magnificat, or Benedictus,

                              See the Reply pag. 523. sayth, that the first Precept Thou shalt loue thy Lord God with all thy hart &amp;c. bindeth not man to loue God in this life with Beatificall loue, nor to be alwayes in actuall imployment of his loue on him; but only to loue sincerely and inwardly, to the keeping of all commandements, without any mortall offence, which breaketh friendship with God, desiring, though not inioying, the happynes of beatificall loue. This, he sayth, is the meaning of S. Bernard, and S. Augustine, when they say the perfection of the next life is contayned in this precept, to wit, in voto, not in re. This doctrine you impugne pag.
                           
525. lin. 26. saying, That the Saints of God hauing obserued other commandements, brake the first commandement, and did vndergo corporall payne after the breach thereof. How proue you this? marry you cypher Heb. 11.31. They were stoned, they were sawen a sunder, they were slayne with the sword. Doth this text proue the Saints transgressed the first Commandment? That they were corporally afflicted for their not louing God with all their hart? Doth it not rather shew the contrary, that they loued God perfectly, and were temporally tormented, because they so loued him with al their hart, that they would rather vndergo most cruell and barbarous deaths, then offend him, or abandon the truth of his word, which is, as our Sauiour saith, the highest degree of Charity?
                        Pag. 10. lin. 20. You deny the Church to be infallible in her Traditions and Definitions; yet (say you) we acknowledge her lawfull authority for expounding Scripture and maintayning vnity in right fayth. In proofe hereof you cite Matth. 18.17. Who so heareth not the Church, let him be to thee as a Heathen and Publican. You could not haue inuented a text that doth more inuincibly shew the cōtrary of what you intend. Let vs make this text of Scripture the Maior, and your Protestant doctrine the Minor, and put your Argument in forme, then will you see how handsomely you proue, that you acknowledge all the lawfull authority of the Church. The Scripture saith, The Church is of so great, &amp; absolute, &amp; infallible authority, that whosoeuer doth not heare her, is to be held as an Heathen and a Publican. Protestants say, the Church is so subiect to errour, and so fallible that euery particuler man of the people, for feare of

being deceaued,

Ergo, Protestants acknowledge the authority giuen to the Church by the word of God, and consequently her lawfull authority.

Great prayse or rather pride; euen the Church of the Apostles were not more religiously deuout vnto, nor more highly conceyted of Christ Iesus, &amp; his passion, then you are. Well, how proue you it? Heb. 10.14. it is written with one oblation he did consummate his sanctifyed for euer. Iohn. 1.29. Behold the Lambe that taketh away the sinns of the world. This is euen iust, as if an Arian should argue in this sort: It is written Iohn. 10.30. I, and and my Father are one. Ergo, Neuer Christian Church prized the diuinity of Christ, nor thought more highly, or religiously of his Equality with his Father, then we. Would not this argument (should an Arian vse it) proue him to be more ridiculous, then religious? And the same force, hath this your argument, as will appeare if we put togeather into forme the propositions thereof, the one Scriptures, the other your Assertion. It is written, that Christ is the Lambe of God that taketh away the sinnes of the

world, who by his one oblation on the Crosse did consummate the sanctifyed for euer. Protestants

                        I Will conclude this section with some few Examples of fraud and falshood in your citing of Scriptures, where you help the dice by addition or subtraction of some particle, or word, to make the Scripture found on your side: Although I do not doubt, but your scoring vp in cyphers of so many impertinent Texts, though being discouered it be ridiculous, was also not without fraud by you vsed; that you might make shew of Scriptures for such articles of your doctrine, for which you know in cōscience, that no true proofe from Scripture can be produced.
                        
                           The text, Iohn 5.39. abused, Search the Scriptures.
                        
                        To begin with the Scriptures themselues, &amp; with a falshood more then once repeated in your Booke; you would shew that the sacred Scripture is so easy, as Vnlearned people may vnderstand the sense thereof,

without relying on the Churches Tradition, &amp; Exposition. To this purpose you say Pag. 9. lin. 9. Our Sauiour commanded euen simple people to vse the Scripture. Ioan. 5.39. One would according to this your citation thinke, that the sacred Text did expresly say, that Search the Scriptures, was spoken vnto simple people: And yet this is a fancy by you cunningly foysted into the text, against the playne euidence therof, which sheweth that, Search the Scriptures, was sayd not to the simple people, but to the Church-magistracy of the Iewes, as these three arguments euince.
                        First the word Iewes, in the Ghospel of S. Iohn doth signify the Magistracy of the Iewes, excluding the simple people: This might be proued by forty exāples, but this may suffice Iohn. 7.13.
                              Ioan. 1.9. &amp; 2.18.20. &amp; 5.15.16.18. &amp; 7.1.11.35. &amp; 8.22.48. &amp; 9.18.22. 
                           There was much muttering about him (our Sauiour) amongst the cōmon people, yet none durst speake openly of him, for feare of the Iewes. Behold the Iewes opposed &amp; cōdistinguished against cōmon people, &amp; feared of them, wherby it is manifest, that by the Iewes, the Gospel of S. Iohn doth vnderstand the Magistracy of the Iewes. But certayne it is, that our Sauiour sayd, search the Scriptures, to the Iewes, according to the signification of that word in the Gospell of S. Iohn: Dixit Iesus Iudaeis, Scrutamini Scripturas &amp;c.
                           
                              Iohn. 5.32. Therefore the wordes were sayd to the Magistracy of the Iewes, the common people being excluded.
                        Secondly, our Sauiour doth testify, that he sayd search the Scriptures vnto them, that sent the Embassage vnto Iohn, to know what he was,
                              Iohn. 5.34. 
                           vos misistis ad Ioannem. But cleere it is that the authours of this Embassage were not the simple people, but the Church-magistracy of the Iewes. Ergo, Not vnto simple

people, but vnto Church-men, and Church-magistrates did our Sauiour say, search the Scriptures.
                        
                        Thirdly, our Sauiour sayd search the Scriptures vnto men highly persuaded of the sole-sufficiēcy of the Scripture, thinking in them to haue eternall life. This appeareth by the text,
                              Ibid. vers. 33. Testimoniū per
                                 •

                           search the Scriptures, because in them you thinke to haue eternall life. Hence they would not belieue in our Sauiour, neyther vpon the testimony of Iohn; nor vpon the testimony of his workes and miracles, nor vpon the testimony of his Fathers voyce from heauen. Now, that the simple people were thus conceyted of Scriptures, agaynst the miracles of our Sauiour, we haue no groūd to think; whereas that the Church-magistracy of the Iewes, was thus conceyted, the Gospell doth expressely declare. There we reade how they appealed from his miracles to Moyses his bookes, bidding such as were lead away by his workes,
                              Ioan. 7.52.5
                                 •
                              . Scrutare Scripturas, &amp; vide quia à Galilaea Propheta non surgit. to search the Scriptures, &amp; see that our Sauiour could not be the Prophet. Therfore to these men, standing vpon the testimony of Scripture, &amp; sole-sufficiency therof vnto eternal life, &amp; not to simple People, did our Sauiour say, Search the Scriptures, because in them you thinke that you haue eternall life, without me, wheras euen these giue testimony of me.
                        
                        Hence appeareth another falsificatiō of this place, by cogging in your own conceyt as it were, the very Text, to wit, that our Sauiour by these words gaue a command to vse scriptures. For it is cleere he did not by way of command say to the Iewes search the Scripturs, but by way of permission, in respect of their obstinacy, whereby they would not without Scripture belieue in him, vpon other most sufficient diuine

testimonies. So that search the Scriptures, because in them you thinke to haue eternall life, hath this sense: Seing you will not be wonne to belieue vpon the testimony of Iohn, nor, of my miracles, nor, of my Fathers voyce from heauen, but appeale from these testimonyes vnto Scriptures, thinking that in them you haue eternall life, search the Scriptures in Gods name, I am content; 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           , do not superficially looke vpon thē but search deeply into them, for being thus searched into, they yield testimony vnto me.
                        Certainly, if our Sauiour had been of the Protestants mind, and would haue giuen the precept they pretend▪ he would not haue sayd to the Iewes, search the Scriptures, because in them you thinke that you haue eternall life, but, search the scriptures, because in them only eternall life is to be had, or, because nothing necessary vnto eternall life is to be belieued vntill it be cleerly proued by them. This he doth not say, but rather rebuketh the Iewes for this their Ministerial cō
                           ceite, that nothing is to be belieued vpon any other testimony without Scripture. He did not therfore command thē to vse the Scriptures, but seing them obstinatly addicted vnto only Scripture, he permitted them to proceed in their own way: Euen as whē Protestants cā
                           not be wonne to belieue neither the testimony of Iohn, that is, the consent of Fathers, nor the testimony of Christs works, that is, of myracles done daily in his Church, nor the Fathers liuely voyce from heauen, that is, Gods word vnwritten; we at last say vnto them, Search the Scriptures, for euen they giue testimony vnto the Catholike doctrine.
                        Hence two thinges appeare. First that your two assertions that Christ saying search the Scriptures,
                           
did command, and command euen simple people to vse Scriptures, be two fancyes of your owne, foysted into the Scripture not by way of interpretation, but by way of Historical Relation of the sacred text, which is grosse abuse thereof. Secondly, that if we search deepely into this text, Search the Scriptures, the same doth cleerly condemne the Protestant fancy, that only Scripture is the rule of fayth, and shewes this to haue been the ground and principle of Iewish Infidelity.
                        
                           The text Matth. 24.24 That euen the elect be deceaued, were it possible, grossely applied.
                        
                        THVS you write pag. 586. Although the Tradition, and teaching of the Church be fallible, yet vnlearned people where they inioy the free vse of Scripture, as in ancient times all people did; and if they be carefull of their saluation, and desire to know the truth, God blesseth his owne Ordinance, and ordinarily assisteth them by grace, in such sort as they shall not be seduced to damnation. Math. 24.24. Thus you encourage simple people to be proud and obstinate in their priuate fancies, agaynst the teaching and tradition of the Church: For in this speach you assure thē, that reading their vulgar Bible, if they be carefull of their saluation, and desire to know the truth, though they will not regard the Church, as the pillar, ground, and infallible Mistresse of truth; yet God will so blesse and assist them, as they shall not be seduced into dānable errour. Now what is the bane of Christianity, but this false and proud persuasion inserted into the heads of Sots? Trinitarians, Anabaptists, Arians, Brownists, Familians, do they not desire to know the truth, who to that end so studiously

peruse their Bible? Be they not carefull of their Saluation that goe so readily to the fyre, rather then abandon the doctrine which by their skill in the Vulgar Bible, they iudge to be the sauing Truth? In these Wretches you may see, how in men desirous to know the truth God blesseth the ordināce of reading the vulgar Bible, without regard had to the Church, as an infallible Mistresse.
                        And as your doctrine is the seed &amp; springe of heresy, so is the text of Scripture Matth. 24.24. most violently drawne to confirme it. For what sayth the text? They (the false Prophets) shall doe great signes &amp; wonders, that euen the elect be induced into errour, if it be possible. By which text it is cleere that the elect people of God, cannot be finally intrapped in damnable errour. This is vnderstood (as Deuines speake) in sensu composito, that is, they cannot be deceaued, because God ordaynes and foresees that they shall vse the meanes to know sauing Truth; which meanes is to cleaue vnto the Tradition of the Church, not trusting their owne skill. Now then with what engines can you, from this truth, wrest your Paradoxe that men desyrous of the truth, reading the vulgar Bible, cannot be damned? Are all men desirous of the truth that reade the Bible, Gods elect? If Heretiks dispute in this manner: The Elect cannot be seduced vnto damnation. Ergo, If they presume on their skill in the Bible not respecting the Churches doctrine as infallible, they shall not be seduced vnto damnation. Why may not murderers argue in like sort? The elect cannot be damned, Therefore if they commit murder euery day, and so perseuer vntill the end, they cannot be damned. This argument is as good as yours. For the contemners

of the Church can no more be saued thē murderers, if our Sauiour say true, who so heareth not the Church, let him to thee as a Heathen and Publican.

                              d people by comparing the doctrine of the Church with the Scripture, may certainly know whether it erreth, or not. Act. 17.11. Thus you. What sayth the text that thence you may make such deductiōs? These were more Noble then those of Thessalonica, who receaued the word with all readines of mind, searching dayly whether these thinges were so. Now behold your manifold abuse of this sacred Narration.
                        First, the text doth not say, these Beroeans were vnlearned; how then can you hence conclude any thinge for the ability of vnlearned people to search the Scriptures? Agayne, the Text doth not say, that by comparing the doctrine of Paul with Scripture, they came to know certaynly, that the doctrine of Paul was true; but only that belieuing his doctrine, they searched the Scriptures about the same, without mention of the successe of their search. And if they were resolued by Scripture, this was only in one poynt, to wit, whether Iesus were the Messias, about which the Scriptures are cleere and expresse. How thē can you hence proue that vnlearned people may know certainly whether the doctrine of the Church be true, by comparing the same with Scripture, in so many mayne articles of Controuersy about Fayth, whereof some (as you 
                              pag. 106. confesse) are only implicately

contayned in the Scripture, and must by the rules of Logicke and Deduction, be thence wrunge out.
                        Finally, the Beroeās read the Scriptures, only for their greater cofirmatiō
                            in Fayth, in case they should find by their priuate reading, the doctrine of S. Paul to agree with the Scripture. They read not by way of doubtfull examination, that is, with purpose not to belieue S. Paul, if so they should not find the Scriptures to yield playne testimony vnto his doctrine. That they read not in this manner, is cleere. For the Scripture sayth, that before they searched the Scripture, they receaued the word with all alacrity, and readines of mind: But if they had been doubtfull of S. Pauls doctrine &amp; had (to cleere that doubt) gone to search the Scriptures, it could not haue been truly sayd of them, that they receaued the word with alacrity, and all readines of mind, and afterward searched the Scriptures. Therefore they did not search Scriptures by way of doubtfull examination, but with full resolution, to belieue S. Pauls doctrine, euen in case they should not find by their priuate industry, the same cleerly deliuered in the Scripture. How then may you by this example make good your Protestant doctrine, that Vnlearned People may compare the doctrine of the Church with the Scripture, in doubting manner, that is, with intention not to belieue the Church in case they should not be able to discouer her doctrine by priuate reading in their vulgar Bible? Or, in case, that in the seeming of their priuate iudgment, the Scripture should appeare as opposite vnto the Church?

And they may with Acesius the Nouatian borrow a ladder, and so climbe vp alone to heauen, yea rather fall to Hell; for who are more desperatly sicke quàm qui mentem febribus perdiderunt, then they which by the feauer of pride, haue lost the vnderstanding of their sinfull condition? Thus you: which you cannot deny to be bitter in excesse. What is the Iesuits fault? No other but this: he sayth, that not only Christ Iesus, the holyest of the holyes, was by nature, &amp; Hypostaticall Vnion impeccable, but also, 
                              Cōcil. Trident. sess 6. can. 23. Sicut de Maria Virgine tenet Ecclesia. that his Holy Mother was pure from all actuall sinne, by speciall grace.
                        And why is this so great and damnable an offence? Marry; because S. Iohn sayth, If wee say wee haue not sinned, wee make God a lyar, and this he spake not in the person of only ordinary Saynts, but in the person of all the Elect, euen of Saynts as singularly

chosen as the Blessed Virgin. This is the ground of your bitternes. But first, though the Scripture had sayd, that all the elect commit actuall sinne, yet perchance not without warrant we might except the mother of God; but I will not stand herein agaynst you. Shew in Gods word this text, all the elect haue sinned, or this: S. Iohn sayd in the person of al the elect, If we say we haue no sinne we deceaue our selues, &amp; the Iesuit presently yieldes. What can you wish more? But if, in the persō of all the Elect, be as in truth it is, your addition vnto the text, ioyned therwith so cunningly as it may seeme the very letter of Gods word, what may we thinke of you, but only that your rayling agaynst vs, is not so bitter, but your iniury vnto Gods word is greater.
                        I adde, that to say S. Iohn spake the aforesayd wordes in the person of all the Elect, not only is not the text, but also agaynst the text, except wee will make S. Iohn excessiue in the conceyte of himselfe. For thus I argue. It is manifest, S. Iohn spake the words aforesayd in the person of such Saynts, in the number of which he ranketh himselfe, If WEE say that WEE haue no sinne. But S. Iohn could not without pride ranke himselfe in the number of Saynts as singularly chosen as was the glorious Virgin, so that if the sense of his saying be, If we, that is, Saynts as singularly priuiledged as Gods Blessed mother, say wee haue not sinned, we deceaue our selues, what can be more arrogant? Luther 
                              Luther Serm. de Natiuit. Mariae. Sumus pares Matri Dei, ac aequè Sancti sicut illa. indeed hath left behind him written: We are all as holy as the Virgin Mary; but that S. Iohn euer sayd it, or thought it, the Minister will neuer an able to proue. So that without any question (as also the 
                              S. Augustin de nat. &amp; grat. c. 42. &amp; &amp; 60. &amp; Epist. 95. Fathers note) S. Iohn

spake in the persō only of al cōmon holy Christians, among whō he might without pride nūber himself.
                        As for your reproaches so many &amp; so bitter, for two reasons you are to be pityed: first, for that your passion against the Iesuit, is either so blind as you see not what lyeth before you, or so fierce as not to spare him, you let contumelious tearmes fly, that must light on the head of the holy Fathers. For this is your cēsure. They that hold any (except the Holyest of the Holyes,) to haue been free from actuall sinne, are gracelesse, &amp; are by S. Iohn enrolled in the blacke booke of damnable lyars; mentem febribus perdiderunt, they haue lost their witts by the phrensy of pride. Now, vnder this your Censure I subsume a knowne and vndeniable truth: But holy Fathers exempt the Blessed Virgen frō actuall sinne, not only S.

                              de Nat. &amp; Grat. c. 36. who thus speaketh for them all: In matter of sinne, no mention is to be made of the mother of our Lord, she is not included in the generall sentences of that kind: Scimus enim &amp;c. For wee KNOVV, WEE ARE CERTAINE, that vnto her, singular Grace was giuē to conquer sinne euery way. What is hence consequent? That except you recall your Censure, you must censure the Fathers, as Gracelesse, Dānable lyars, Franticke fooles, so great is your passion, and so small your iudgment in rayling at the Iesuit.
                        Secondly, you are to be pittyed, in regard your passion is so extreme, as you cannot ioyne togeather the parts of your discourse in any sensible manner. You say, that the Iesuit holding the Blessed Virgin was immaculate, and pure from actuall sinne, is like

to Acesius the Nouatian, who thought himselfe pure and innocent, and denyed possibility of saluation vnto men that sinned after baptisme, so leauing no ladder to Climbe vp to heauen, but only that of Innocency. What can be more inept, then to lay this censure on the Iesuite in that respect? If the Iesuite hold the Blessed Virgin to haue been euer free from actuall sinne, doth it follow that he must also so esteeme of himselfe, as did the Nouatian? May he not iudge her to be an Immaculate Virgin, and yet himselfe a sinfull man, crauing pardon of his sinnes by her prayers? And if he should be so fond also as to thinke himselfe vnspotted &amp; pure from sinne, doth it follow, that he must needes with Acesius exclude from saluation all penitent sinners, &amp; allow no ladder vnto heauen, but only that of purity, taking away the other of pennance? Surely, you cannot but see this your Inuectiue to be not only wrongfull, but also witlesse. The same distemper of passion causeth you not to marke the want of coherence betwixt your Textuall assertions, and Marginall proofes. In your text you say, The Iesuit by saying the Blessed Virgin was pure from sinne, hath lost his witts by the feauer of pride. In proofe hereof you cite in your margent this sentēce of S. Cyprian, Quisquis se inculpatum dixerit, aut superbus, aut stultus est? who so doth say that himselfe is without sinne, is eyther proud, or a foole. Do you not yet perceaue the wonderfull impertinency of this proofe? Let the same be put into forme, &amp; then you will perchance presently feele it. Whosoeuer sayth that himselfe is without sin, is a proud foole. The Iesuit sayth that the mother of God was without sinne. Ergo, The Iesuit is a proud foole. Verily, the Iesuit is not so

great a foole as he who doth not perceaue the folly of this arguing, which is iust as good as this: Who so thinketh himselfe the holyest, &amp; learnedst Deuine of this age, is a very foole. But Francis White thinketh Iohn Caluin the holyest, and learnedst Deuine of this age. Ergo, Francis White is a very foole. Suppose you were thus conceyted of Caluin, and some Catholike Deuine should thus come vpon you for the same, would not his folly seeme prodigious vnto all learned men?
                        Other falsifications I might yet further discouer, as pag. 5. lin. 8. where to shew that the Church shall not be alwayes visible,
                              Aug. de vnit. Eccles. c. 16. you bring the Donatists obiection; The Scriptures fortell a large reuolt from heauenly truth. 2. Thessal. 2.2. these words from heauēly truth, are added to the Text: for the Text only sayth first there shall come the defection, or reuolt, which most Expositours vnderstand, from the Roman Empire.
                        
                        And pag. 519. citing 1. Iohn 5.18. He that is begotten of God SINNETH NOT, for the Diuine generation keepeth him, and the wicked One toucheth him not; you omit, sinneth not, that the Scripture might not seeme to auouch what you so bitterly rayle agaynst, that the Saints of God by speciall grace may liue without sinne.
                        Likewise to reproue the Iesuites doctrine, that Saints though they sinne venially, yet doe not sinne agaynst the Diuine Law: For this Law doth exact thinges of men no further, then they are necessary vnto eternall life; but Veniall sinne destroyeth, or opposeth nothing that is necessary to eternall life. Agaynst this doctrine you argue pag. 522. lin. 20. If iust men haue any sinne, they performe not all the Diuine

law requireth; for euery sinne is a transgression of the Diuine law, 1. Iohn. 3.4. Heere to the Text of your English Bible, you adde Diuine, the Text being, Euery sin is a transgression of the Law, or of a Law. And this sentence is true: for though Veniall sinns be not against the Diuine speciall law, because they are not against Charity and Saluation; yet they are against the law of reason, which bindeth mē, as much as may be, not to be forgetfull &amp; inconsiderate euen in small matters. And though some sentences of Scripture recō
                           mend these small thinges vnto vs, it is only to put vs in mind of what we are bound vnto by the law of reason, not to lay new diuine obligations vpon vs, Many such other tricks of your falshood I omit to discouer, for breuityes sake.
                     
                  
                  
                     Ignorance, Fraud, and Falshood in alleadging Fathers, and all manner of Authours. SECT. V.
                     
                        IN this subiect I might be large, you being copious in your quotations, whereof scarce one is to be found, which being examined to the originall, is not eyther impertinent, or wrested agaynst the Authours mind, or falsifyed by mistranslation in the very text Which to discouer fully and particulerly were an hugh worke, and hardly worth the labour, and no wayes necessary. For euen as to the end that one may know the Sea to be salt▪ it is not needfull, that he drinke vp the whole mayne,

two or three tasts taken heere and there may sufficiently resolue him of this truth; so foure or fiue examples in euery kind may more then abundantly serue, to make this your want of conscience knowne vnto your vnwary Credents, that they may see whome they trust, in a busines that doth so highly import.
                     These your falsifications are of two kinds, some crafty and subtill some grosse and impudent Crafty falsification is, when to draw Authours to your purpose, in your translation of their text you eyther adde to it, or detract frō it some words or particles, thereby changing the sense, or else cite their words truly, but contrary to their meaning. Grosse falsification, is when you lay doctrines to the charge of Authours which they reiect euen in the places by you cyted Both these kinds of falshood S. Paul doth signify to be practised by Heretikes Ephes. 4 8. where he sayth, That Christ hath left Pastours and Doctours to his Church, to the end that we be not carryed away with the blasts of euery doctrine, by the wylinesse of men, to circumuent weakelings in errour. What be the blasts of hereticall doctrine, but their violent and audacious falsifyings of Scriptures and Fathers? What their wylinesse to circumuent in errour, but crafty corruption, by stealing away, or cogging in words, in their producing of the monuments of Chistian Antiquity. The Greeke word vsed by S. Paul is, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , which signifies properly, cogging of the dyce, or helping the dyce craftily to cast what chāce they please: Euen so Heretikes by helping the yee, by cogging wordes in &amp; out of the Text, make Scriptures &amp; Fathers speak as they please. This your cogging in Scripture is already discouered. Now about the Fathers.

                        TO note some few of the many. Pag. 22. lin. 5. to make S. Augustine seeme to fauour your Protestant fancy, that men are resolued in fayth, by the resplendent Verity, and euidence of the Christian Doctrine, you cite him as saying: 
                              Cont. Ep. Fund. c. 4.

                              ld in the Catholike Church In this quotation the word, other is cogged into the text, to change the sense, as if S. Augustine had sayd, I haue many motiues to belieue the Catholike Doctrine, amongst other the manifest verity of the things reuealed, &amp; this is the chiefest of all. S. Augustines true text is, manifest verity so cleerly shewed, as no doubt therof can be made, praeponenda est omnibus, is to be preferred before all these thinges, whereby I am held in the Catholike Church. Hence it is cleere, that the manifest Verity was not the stay, and motiue of S. Augustines fayth. For what is preferred before all the motiues, that stayed him in the Catholike Church, was none of his motiues: But (he saith) that man
                                 •

                              st verity so cleerly shining as no doubt thereof can be made, is to be preferred before all his motiues. Ergo, S▪ 
                           Augustin was not befooled with this foppery, that Fayth is resolued finally into the manifest resplendēt verity of the doctrine, and thinges reuealed in Scripture.

                              Aug. l. 2. de Baptis. c. 3. saying, That former councells are corrected by latter: Whence you inferre, that the Tradition of the Church is fallible. For what sentence of the Church is infallible, if that of Councells be fallible, In which
                           
(say you) some Papists place the soueraignty of Ecclesiasticall authority. Heere you shew Ignorance and Falshood. Ignorance about the doctrine of Catholikes: For though some preferre the Councell before the Pope, &amp; others the Pope before the Councell, in case the whole Councel should be opposite to the Pope in matters of Fayth to be defined, which case yet neuer happened; yet all preferre perpetual Tradition hand to hand from the Apostles, before both Pope and Councell. For how can we know, that Church definitions made by Pope &amp; Councell be infallible, but by Tradition? Some may say, that is cleerly proued by Scripture. It is true; but how shall we know the texts assumed in this proofe, to be the Apostles Scripture, but by Tradition? How should we be so sure, that we truly expound the Texts aright, did we not see the Tradition, and practise of the Church to haue been still conformable to the sense we giue of those Scriptures?
                        Your Falshood is, in that you conceale the words that immediatly follow in S. Augustines sentence, which had you set down,
                              Aug. lib. 2. de Baptis. c. 3. Ipsa plenaria Concilia saepe priora posterioribus emē

                              erum aperitur quod clausum erat. it would haue been euidēt, that he doth attribute fallibility, and corrigibility vnto Councells, only in matters of fact, or Ecclesiasticall Lawes about manners. For the whole sentence is, Amongst plenary Councells the former are corrected by the latter, cùm experimento rerum &amp;c. when by EXPERIMENT of thinges, something is brought to light which before was hidden. Now the truth of matters and mysteries of Fayth is not brought to light by tyme and experience, but the truth of matters of fact is, of which One sayth:
Quicquid sub terra est in apricum proferet aetas.
                        
                        
                           Therefore S. Augustine speakes not of matters of Fayth, but of matters of fact, or of Ecclesiasticall Lawes about manners, which in some cases, tyme and experience doth discouer to be inconuenient, &amp; therefore to be recalled.
                        In the same place to prooue S. Augustine 
                           Pag. 21. in lit. b. &amp;c. held, that the Church in her perpetuall Traditions may be deceaued, you cite him, saying:

Non debet Ecclesia se Christo praeponere, vt putet à se iudicatos baptizare non posse, ab Illo autem iudicatos posse, cùm Ille semper veraciter iudicet: Ecclesiastici autem Iudices, sicut homines, plerumque falluntur. 
                           the writings of any Bishops since the Apostles, may be questioned and called into doubt. I do not doubt but you know in your conscience, that S. Augustine in both the places, is alleadged oppositely to his meaning. In the first place, he speaketh not about Church-errours in matters of fayth, but about errors in matters of fact, or Church iudgments, concerning criminall causes. For this is his whole sentence: The Church ought not to preferre herselfe before Christ, as to say, that men condemned by him as wicked, may validely baptize; but such as she doth condemne, may not, seeing He in his iudgements neuer erreth, whereas Ecclesiasticall Iudges as being men are often deceaued. Who doth not see, that you wrong Saint Augustine, to bring this his testimony for his holding the perpetuall Tradition of the Catholicke Church, hand to hand from the Apostles, by the succession of Bishops, to be fallible? And no lesse iniuriously you produce him in the second testimony. For he speaketh of single Bishops, considered ech of them by themselues, that their writings are obnoxious vnto errour, and so may be questioned and examined by Scripture; thence inferring, that the Donatists should not wonder, that he did examine the Epistle of S. Cyprian, agaynst the Baptisme of Heretikes: so

cleere it is he speakes of single Bishops, not of Tradition by the full consent of Bishops.
                        
                           Pag. 37. lin. 33. For only Scripture, you cite the same S. August. as thus writing: 
                              August. in epist· 1. Ioā. tract. 3. 
                           The Church hath only two breasts wherwith she feedeth her Children, the Scriptures of the Old &amp; New Testamēt. You corrupt this place by addition &amp; false translation. First, by adding to the text the word only, to make men belieue S. Aug. held that no doctrine of Fayth is to be belieued, which is not cleerly contayned in Scripture: whereas 
                              l. 4. de Baptis. c. 6. &amp; 24. l. 5. c. 22. he hath an expresse principle to the contrary many tymes repeated in his workes: Sundry thinges (to wit of fayth, such as was the doctrine that Baptisme giuen by Heretiks is valide,) are most iustly belieued to be the Apostles, though they be no where written in the Scriptures. Secondly, S. August. sayth not as you trāslate, that the Churches two breasts are the Scriptures of the Old &amp; New Testamēt (for thē it would follow, that she hath no milke in her two breasts, but written doctrine;) but he sayth her two breasts, are the two Testaments of Diuine Scriptures. Hence you may gather that in ech of her breasts, in ech of the Testaments, the milke of Scripture is contayned, but that only the milke of writtē doctrine is in them contayned, you cannot from this text truly cited inferre, &amp; therefore both by addition, and transposition of wordes you help the dyce.
                        To proue, That the Tradition of the Church hath no credit or authority, but from Scripture, and that though this Tradition might be false, yet Fayth would subsist, because there remayneth allwayes an higher, and more soueraigne Iudge, to wit, God speaking in the Scripture; To proue this, I say, you

It is placed as it were in an high throne of authority, vnto which euery faythfull and pious vnderstanding must be subiect. What is this? Why doe you not name it? Because you durst not set downe the wordes that immediatly precede, which make cleerly agaynst you, to wit these: Excellentia Canonic

                           The Canonicall authority of the Scriptures, confirmed in the Apostles dayes, is by SVCCESSIONS of Bishops &amp; propagations of Churches placed in an high throne of authority &amp;c. How directly is this testimony of S. Augustine agaynst that, which you would proue thereby? How hath Tradition no credit or authority but from Scripture, if the Scripture, by successiue tradition of Bishops hand so hand, frō the Apostles, hath gotten (quoad nos, in the persuasion of the Christian world) the high seate of Diuine authority, to be honoured as Gods word, vnto which euery mā must yield? If this successiue Tradition, on which (as S. Augustine teacheth) our persuasion about the authority of Scripture dependes, be made weake &amp; fallible by Protestants, how shall the Scripture be able to keepe her credit, and authority in our Fayth? Verily it cannot, except Christians will cease to rely on the authority of God reuealing, and on doctrine deliuered by the succession of Bishops, &amp; hunt after Diuine and Apostolicall Scripture, by the sent, and smell of the doctrines deliuered therein, as you doe.
                        Likewise by addition of the Particle Only, you falsify the saying of

Cum electis semper adfuturum se promittit. sayth, Christ promised to be with his Elect all dayes vntill the consummation of the world, you cite him as saying, Only with the elect. More grossely in the same place you falsify Druthmarus: for whereas

                            he sayth, Christ is with the Reprobate by the presence of his

Godhead, but with the Elect in another manner; you make him say Christ promiseth to be only with the elect; contrary to his meaning, who teacheth, that the presence, and perpetuall assistance of our Sauiour are so vnited vnto his Church, &amp; her Pastors, that they may not erre, but still teach all that he cōmanded: but that presence whereof that Text properly speaketh, is not only affoarded vnto the Elect, but vnto wicked men, for the Saluation of all worthy Communicants, as your selfe

                           S. Augustine long since deliuered; The Sacriledge of Schisme is then committed, when there is no iust cause of Separation. Thus by long continued, fierce, bitter blasts of false reproach, you diriue your

vnwary Reader vpō the hidden rocke of a falsifyed sentence of S. Aug. as though this most Diuine Doctour had insinuated the lawfullnes of reuolt &amp; separatiō from all Christiā Churches. What can be more false? He disputeth agaynst the Donatists who had seuered themselues from the Christian world, pretending that Caeciliā
                            Bishop of Carthage, &amp; other Catholikes had giuen vp the Holy Bibles to the fire. S. Aug. doth conuince them of Schisme two wayes: First because this pretence were it true, is not iust, for there can be no iust cause of separation from the whole world, and of beginning a new distinct Christian Church. These be his wordes: 
                              Augustin. ep. 48. ad Vincent. Fieri non potest vt aliqui iustam causam habeant, qua communionem suam separent à cōmunione Orbis terrarum, eamue appellent Ecclesiam Christi, quòd se iuste ab omnium gē

                           We are certayne that none could iustly separate themselues from the Communion of the whole world. And againe: It is no way possible that any should haue reason to separate themselues from the cō
                              munion of the whole World, and so tearme themselues the Church, because vpō iust cause they haue deuided thēselues from the Society of all nations. Thus S. Aug. What can be more direct agaynst that doctrine for which you cite him? Or more efficacious to conclude, that you Protestants are guilty of damnable Schisme?
                        Secondly (sayth S. Augustine) the cause you Donatist pretend is nulla, none at all; it is an vntruth,

                           the Sacriledge of Schisme most notoriously eminent, when there was NO cause of separation. He doth not say,

When there is no iust cause of separation, Schisme is cōmitted, as though there might be some iust cause, and then Schisme is not committed; but when there is no cause of all, which may with any colour, or shew be pretended for separation, then Schisme is not only committed (for it is still committed when separation is made from the whole Christian world what cause soeuer be pretended) but then, it is notoriously &amp; most euidently committed. Behold how changing the text of S. Augustine, and agaynst Iustice cogging into the same the word, iust, you make his speach to haue a sense, iust contrary to his meaning. How iustly might I charge you with obscuring &amp; outfacing of the truth by forgery, which calumniously, without any proofe, you obiect vnto the Sacred Councell of Trent? But like to like, such a Religion, such an Aduocate.
                     
                     
                        Seauen Testimonies of other Fathers falsifyed. §. 2.
                        
                        LET vs also discouer some of your corruptions about other Fathers besides S. Augustine. For the fulnes of Scripture about all poynts of fayth, you cite these wordes of 
                              Serm. de Bapt.
                            
                           S. Cyprian: Christian Religion findes, that from this Scripture the rules of all learning flow, and that whatsoeuer is contayned in the discipline of the Church, doth arise from this, and is resolued into this. These wordes Puritans might better then you alleadge for their Geneuian Principle, that not only Church-doctrine, but also Church-discipline must be contayned in Scripture, &amp; proued by the cleere Texts thereof. But happily they neuer saw it, or if they did, they durst not be so impudent, as to alledge it, as you do, agaynst the meaning of the Authour.

For S. Cyprian speakes not of the whole volume of Scripture, but only of twelue or thirteene wordes therof, to wit, this little sentēce: Praecipis Domine vt diligam te, &amp; de proximo iubes vt ad meam eum mensuram complectar &amp;c. Legat hoc vnum verbum &amp; in hoc mandato meditetur Christiana Religio, &amp; inueniet ex hac Scriptura omniū doctrinarum regulas emanasse &amp;c. 
                           Loue thy Lord God with all thy hart, &amp; thy neighbour as thy selfe. This would haue appeared, had you not omitted the wordes immediatly precedent in the very same sentence, Let Christian Religion reade this one word, and meditate on this commandment, and it shall find, that from this Scripture the Rules of all learning flow &amp;c.
                        
                        And this example may serue to make euident to the eye, your perpetuall Protestant Impertinency in alleadging wordes of the Fathers, in which they commend the perfection &amp; fulnes of Scripture, for your fancy of only-only-only Scripture. For the Fathers meaning is, that all is contayned in Scripture in a generall, and confuse manner, not so particularly, and distinctly as Scripture may be the sole rule for all necessary poynts of Fayth. This is cleere, for what they say of the whole Scripture, they say of some principall particle thereof, as of this: Thou shalt loue thy Lord God with all thy hart, and thy neighbour as thy selfe: But no man that is in his iudgment, will say what this sole sentence is a sufficient Rule of Fayth, for all necessary poynts of Doctrine and Discipline: Therefore their commendations of the plenitude of Scripture can inforce no more, then that all is contayned in Scripture in some generall manner, not so particularly, but that for explication and distinctiō of many poynts, the rule of Churches Tradition is necessary.
                        For the clarity of Scriptures, that vnto them that know not the Tradition of the Church, they are easy, you 
                              pag. 45 lin. 10 cite S.

                           Chrysostome: Scriptures are not

like Metalls which haue neede of workemen TO DIGGE THEM OVT, but they deliuer a treasure ready at hand to them which seeke hidden riches in them. It is sufficient that thou looke into them &amp;c. Here you falsify the Text of S. Chrysostome, by adding vnto it to digge thē out, whereby you make both the Father to contradict himselfe, and his speach to be senselesse. For if the Riches of the Scripture be hidden in the Text thereof, as he sayth, how is it a Treasure ready at hand without digging or searching? How it is inough to looke into the booke to find it? Had you digged deepely into the golden Mine of S. Chrysostome, you would perchance haue found out his true meaning, &amp; not haue imposed vpon him this false, and pernicious doctrine.
                        
                           S. Chrysostome in getting gold out of mines, doth consider that a double labour is to be vndergone. The one to digge out that earth wherwith Gold is mingled. The other to seuer the gold frō the earth. The first labour he sayth is necessary, that we find out the Treasure, &amp; true sense of Scripture: we must (sayth 
                              Chrysost. Homil. 40. in Ioan. FODERE nos profundius iubet, vt quae altè delitescunt inuenire possimus▪ 
                              Idem in Gen. Homil. 37. Indagatis Profundis, verum sensum veritatis percipere. he) not only looke into the booke, not only attend to the bare reading, but we are cōmanded to DIGGE DEEPELY, that wee may find out the thinges that lye hidden in the bottome. For wee digge not for a thinge that lyes open, and READY AT HAND, but for a treasure that is hidden in the deepe. Thus S. Chrysostome. How directly against his mind do you make him say, that the sense of the Scripture is a treasure so ready at hand, and obuious, as we need not digge for it?
                        
                        In respect of the second labour, to wit, of seuering drosse from Gold when the same is found, this labour S. Chrysost. sayth is needlesse, in regard of the

Scripture.In metallis difficile est inuenire quod venantur. Etenim cùm metalla Terra sint, &amp; Aurum non aliud quam Terra, similitudo celat aspectum eorum quae quaeruntur. In Scripturis non est eadem ratio. Neque enim proponitur Aurum terrae commixtum, sed Aurum purum &amp;c. 
                           In Mines (sayth he) men haue difficulty to

                              es it is not so, the doctrine proposed therein being not gold mingled with earth, but pure Gold; (the word of God is pure syluer refined wilth fire) so that the Scriptures be not mettals that require workemē
                            (to seuer in their doctrine Drosse from Gold;) they offer a ready and refined treasure to them that seeke the riches hidden in them. Thus S. Chrysostome, and he doth there largely discourse, how euery thinge in Scriptures, euen the Chronologies, and proper Names of men do affoard wholesome and profitable doctrine to the Reader; but to find this treasure, we must not (as he there sayth) nudam tantùm scripturam aspicere, sed insistere, &amp; cum studio repositas scrutari opes, not only looke vpon the Scripture, but insist, &amp; with study search out the riches hoarded vp therein. Haue you not thē notoriously falsifyed the sense of his discourse, by the insertion of words of your owne?
                        In the behalfe of your Protestant sole-sufficiency of Scripture, you cite

                            this sentence of Durand tearming, him A famous Scholeman: Ecclesia licèt Dei Dominationem habeat in terris, illa tamen non excedit limitationem Scripturae. Although the Church haue the power &amp; authority of God vpon earth, yet that authority doth not exceed the limitation of the Scripture. This place is by you alleadged many tymes in this your Reply, but most impertinently. For his meaning is, that the Church, though it haue the authority of God vpon earth, 
                              Matth. 16. v▪
                               20. Quicquid solueris, quicquid ligaueris super terram, erit solutum &amp; ligatum in caelis. yet the same power is in some cases restrayned and limited by the Scripture.

In which respect the Church cannot dispense in many thinges wherein God might dispense: In 
                           Ecclesia licèt habeat authoritatē Dei in tertio, illa tamen non excedit limitationē Scripturae. Scriptura autem docet expresse seruos conuersos ad fidem adhuc manere Dominis suis prioribus, licet illi maneant infideles.

                              sters, because that the Scripture doth expressely teach, that Slaues conuerted vnto the Fayth, are to be still subiect to their former Maisters, though their Maisters be Infidels. Thus Durand. Now what is this to the purpose of prouing, that men are bound to belieue nothing but what is cleerly contayned in Scripture? Except, according to your skill in Logicke, you will argue in this sort; The Church cannot do the thinges forbidden her in Scripture, because her power is not beyond the restraynt thereof giuen in the Scripture Ergo, she cannot belieue, &amp; teach doctrines proposed vnto her by the rule of Tradition without Scripture, which is a thinge commended vnto her in Scripture; Hold the Traditions you haue, whether by speach, or by Epistle. 2. Thessal. 2.15.
                        How many tymes in this your Reply haue you cited this testimony of the Maister of the Sentences,

And yet it is most certayne and euident, that he speakerh of iudgment in criminall causes. For hence he inferretth, Soluere noxios vel damnare se putant innoxios, cùm apud Deum non sententia Sacerdotum, sed reorum vita queratur. Et ita apertè ostenditur quòd non semper sequitur Deus iudicium Ecclesiae, quae per ignorantiam &amp; surreptionem interdum iudicat▪
                            the Church-mē must not thinke because Christ said vnto them, whatsoeuer you bind or loose vpon earth, shall be bound &amp; loosed in Heauen, that therefore they may condemne the Innocent and absolue the Nocent. For God in such case

doth not follow their sentence, but iudgeth according to the life of the accused.

                           ut let the ancient Tradition be kept; this Firmilian wrote against him an Epistle full of sharpe &amp; contumelious speach. Had you mentioned this quality of Firmilian, which I do not doubt but you knew, your impertinency would haue been apparent. For this supposed, your Argument goeth thus. Some Bishops, specially Firmilian, erring against Fayth, and blasted

for the tyme with the spirit of Heresy, wrote a cōtemptuous Epistle against the Sea of Peter. Ergo, the Sea of Peter is not by diuine Institution, the Rocke of the Church, agaynst which the gates of hell (all Heresyes) should (rage, but) neuer preuayle.
                        
                        Secondly, you notoriously falsify the sentence of Firmilian, in making him to rayle against the Roman Bishops being the successour of Peter. For this, euen in that his Hereticall passion (wherof he afterward was This is testifyed by Dionysius Alexandrinus, who then liued, in his Epistle to Xistus the Successour of S. Stephen. apud Euseb. l. 7. Histor. c. 3. &amp; Niceph. l. 6. c 7. penitent) he neuer did; yea he doth rather acknowledge the Roman Bishops succession frō 
                           Peter, and thence argueth, that seeing to Peter only, Christ said, To thee I will giue the Keyes of the Kingdome of heauen &amp;c. that Pope Stephen should least of all mē admit, that Heretikes who cleaue not to Peters Sea, can validely baptize. For his true words by you falsifyed and curtalled, are these: And 
                           Quòd vna Ecclesia semel à Christo supra Petram solidata est; hinc intelligi potest, quòd SOLI PETRO Christus dixerit: Quaecumque ligaueris super terram &amp;c. Atque adeo in hac parte iustè indignor, quod qui successionem Petri se habere cō

                           herein I do iustly fret against the open and manifest folly of Stephen, that, seeing he doth so glory of the dignity of his Bishopricke, and standeth so much vpon his being the successour of Peter, on whome the foundations of the Church were layd, that he will bring in two rockes, and the buildings of many Churches, whiles by his authority he doth mantaine, that in them (Churches alien from Peters Sea, or rocke) true baptisme is giuen. Thus Firmilian: whence it is cleere that he did not reuile S. Stephen, in respect of his clayming Primacy and authority by succession from Peter (as you make him to your purpose to do) but that being the successour of Peter, he vrged this his Primacy against Anabaptisme; whereas he should rather in Firmilian his opinion, haue been Stephanus, qui per successionem Petri Cathedram habere praedicat, nullo aduersus Haeretico

                           The Canon of the Scripture is perfect, and sufficient in it selfe for all matters, yea more then sufficient. Verily this is sufficient, &amp; more then sufficient to shew the beggary of your Religion: otherwise this testimony so impertinent would not be by you and your fellowes so perpetually

                            alleadged. For Lyrinensis doth not say▪ that the Canon of the Scripture is abundantly sufficient, but only, the same is supposed in an obiection or question mooued vnto him: In answere whereto Lyrinensis doth shew, that this supposed sufficiency is not such, but of necessity the rule of Tradition must be ioyned therewith.

                           may ASKE, seeing the Canon of the scripture is perfect, and sufficient vnto it selfe, in all thinges, what need is there that the authority of Ecclesiasticall interpretation be ioyned therewith? Because all do not vnderstand the holy Scripture in the same sense; &amp; this in respect of the depth, (or difficulty) thereof, that the same passage is taken this way by one, and that way by another; so that as many dissonant interpretatiōs may seemingly be brought therof as there be interpreters &amp;c. Hence in regard of the manifold windings and turnings of Errour, it is 
                           MVLTVM Necesse est.

the ECCLESIASTICALL sense.
                        
                        In this Testimony two things are affirmed contrary to the purpose you bring it. First that the sufficiency of Scripture is not so full, nor so perfect, as is supposed in the question; the Scripture being deepe, dark, difficile, that setting Traditiō aside in lieu of one certayne assured Truth, one may find therein manifold windings and turnings of Errour. Secondly, that in this respect the Scripture cānot be the only rule of Fayth, but it is NECESSARY, and VERY NECESSARY, that besides Scripture, we allow the RVLE of Church-Tradition, or Exposition. You knowing this, as you did, with what conscience could you cite this place for the sole-sufficiency of Scripture, &amp; so many tymes cite it, taking a thing falsely supposed in the Question for the doctrine of the Authour?
                        Pag 44. lin. 24. to proue the Perspicuity of the Scripture in it selfe, without the light of Tradition for all necessary points, you cite the wordes of Irenaeus: All the 
                           
                              Irenaeus l. 2. cap. 46. 
                           Scriptures both Propheticall &amp; Euangelicall are cleere without ambiguity, and may indifferently be heard of all men. Is it possible you durst in defence of your fancy cite this place in this manner, according to which it is false, euen in your owne fancy? For do not you yourselfe write pag. 35. lin. 18. We acknowledge that MANY particuler Texts and passages of holy Scripture, are obscure and hard to be vnderstood? How then are all Scriptures, both Propheticall and Euangelicall, cleere without any ambiguity indifferently vnto all men? Are you also so dull of hearing as not to perceaue the iarre betwixt this sentence of S. Irenaeus, and the sentences of the Fathers, which after him presently you produce? S. Hierome: It is the

manner of Scripture to ioyne that which is manifest, after that which is obscure. S. Augustine: Playne places are found in Scriptures to expound and open the darke &amp; hard. If this be true, how are all the Scriptures cleere without ambiguity? yea S. Irenaeus in the very next chapter

                        Verily these Arguments conuince you to haue falsifyed Irenaeus, as you haue indeed, &amp; very grossely. For he doth not say, All Scriptures are cleere without ambiguity, as you cite him, but this: Cum itaque vniuersae Scripturae &amp; Propheticae &amp; Euangelicae, in aperto &amp; sine ambiguitate, &amp; similiter ab omnibus audiri possunt, (etsi non omnes credunt) vnum &amp; solum Deum (ad excludendos alios) praedicent, omnia fecisse per verbum sicut demonstrauimus ipsis Scripturarum dictionibus; valde hebetes apparebunt, qui ad tam lucidam adapertionem caecutiun

                           Seing all Scriptures, both Propheticall and Apostolicall, openly, and without ambiguity, and in manner as they may be heard of all (though all belieue not) preach, that one only God made all things by his word, as we haue proued by Scriptures so affirming in the same words; how dull sighted may they appeare whose eyes agaynst such manifest euidence are blinded, and will not see the light of this preaching? Thus S. Irenaeus, affirming no more then that all Scriptures do euidently preach this one point of Fayth, That there is one only God. So that we may say, how dull sighted were you, that would cite this testimony for your fancy against the playne euidence thereof?

                        IN this kind I may with good reason register in the first place your slanderous dealing with Cardinall Hosius, the falshood being not only notorious

in it selfe, but also discouered agaynst your Ancestours in formes times. Pag. 151. in fine, and 152. initio, you charge Catholikes, That they debase the sacred Scripture, aduancing humane Traditiōs. In proofe wherof you alleadge these wordes as of Cardinall Hosius; 
                              Pag. 152. lit. a. Hosius de express. verb. Dei pag. 50. 
                           Non oportet legis aut Scripturae esse peritum, sed à Deo doctum; vanus est labor qui Scripturae impenditur. Scriptura enim creatura est, &amp; egenum quoddam elementum, non conuenit Christianū Scripturae addictum &amp;c. A man ought not to be learned in the Scripture, but taught of God; lost is the labour which vpon Scripture is spent. For the Scripture is but a Creature, yea an empty element, it doth not become a Christian to be conuersant in the same.
                        These words contayne horrible Blasphemy, in so much as Cardinall Hosius himselfe hearing that some Protestants in their printed bookes had layd this sentence to his charge, did not doubt to say: 
                              Bellarmin. de concilijs in praefat.
                            
                           That I should thus affirme? Verily had I so written, I were worthy to be burnt in the market place. What then? Hath not Hosius the wordes? Indeed the wordes are found in the Cardinals book, but how? brought as blasphemy spoken in the person of the Swenckfeldian Sect, or of the Heauenly Prophets. This is Hosius his discourse:

                               was sent from Heauen by God. What horrible blasphemy is this? What Christian will not tremble at the hearing thereof? The Scriptures affirmation is no more to be belieued, then the Alcoran? Hath Bellarmine this sentence, which you cite in a distinct letter, as his formall assertion? Behold the true words of Bellarmine for the Reader, that seeing your falshood, he may ioyne togeather with detestation of Turkish impiety, detestation of your Protestant slaūdering: Nam etiamsi Scriptura dicat, Libros Prophetarum &amp; Apostolorum esse diuinos, tamen non certò id credam, nisi priùs credidero Scripturam quae hoc dicit esse Diuinam.

Hence I inferre that Petrus Soto by the words, quae ad cultum pertinent, doth not meane the mayne dutyes of Latriae, and Religion; but Reuerentiall carriage and ceremonyes to be vsed in the administration of the Sacraments. This is cleere. For by things pertinent vnto Reuerence, he meanes thinges that are not common vnto all, nor to be knowne and obserued of all But the mayne dutyes of Latria &amp; Religion are common vnto all Christians: Therefore Soto doth not meane them in his wordes Quae ad cultum pertinen

                           ; but only things of ceremoniall Reuerence in the vse of the Christian sacrifice and Sacraments, as the Authour Quae autem in celebratione Baptismatis, &amp; qua ratione agenda sunt, vbi est scriptum? Credendúmne est, tantum Ministerium sine vlla praeparatione, SOLEMNITATE &amp; RITV quae ad eius excitant venerationem traditum esse? Ibid. pag. 26. doth also in that place declare. So that it is in you wonderful boldnes, by so many leauings out by so many alterings and transposings of words, to change Sotus his meaning, as though he had been besotted with Swenckfeldian fancy of immediat Reuelation without Scripture.

                           Bosius de sig. Eccles. lib. 16. cap. 10. scriptura non refertur inter eiusmodi principia; the Scripture is not reckoned amongst these principles,

                              1. Brother more oftē, as though Bosius did say, the Scripturs were not Diuine. But your slaunder is intollerable, for he doth not say, that Scriptures are not reckoned amongst Diuine Principles, but only not amongst the articles of the Creed. His wordes are: We know, that amongst other articles of the Creed one is, I belieue the holy Catholike Church: Now these articles are as it were certayne principles, which must be knowne and belieued in the first place: But the Scripture is not numbred amongst THESE Principles, although it be named HOLY, and SACRED.
                        
                        Hence appeareth, how notoriously you slaūder and falsify Bosius, by making him say, that Scriptures are not numbred amongst Diuine Principles. First, because he sayth not, they are not numbred amongst Diuine Principles, but only not amongst the twelue Articles of the Creed; which is a truth so manifest, as Ministers cannot be ignorant thereof, if they be acquainted with the Creed. Secōdly, because in that very place and sentence, he doth affirme the contrary, to wit, that the Scriptures are holy and sacred. What is this but Diuine? Verily this accusation that Protestants if they will be Catholikes must send the Scriptures packing, is as true, as what you 
                              Answere to the Preface fol. 6. pag. 1. lin. 19. there also affirme, That they must let the Roman Nahash pluck out their right eye, and vow blind obedience vnto him. Which you proue, because Bonauenture

                                  Francisci c. 5. sayth, that S. Francis exhorted his Fryars vnto blind Obedience. As though Protestants might not be admitted into the Roman Church, except they will be Fryars; or that by Religious obedience men put out their right

eye, which regardeth God, and Heauen, and not tather the left, which looketh vpon earth and worldly pleasure. Had you eyther the right, or left eye of Wisdome you would not write as you doe. Had you any sparke of diuine Wisdome, you would not vent such false, &amp; odious slanders. Had you any dramme of humane Wisdome, you would blush to confirme your slaunders, with such seely and ridiculous proofes.

                        YOW are so bold in your Falshood, as you dare cite the Fathers for your fancy, where ex professo, euen of purpose they dispute agaynst it, and proue the contrary. Pag 85 lin. 26. you say, the gifts of doing Miracles were neuer promised in the Scripture to be perpetuall, and are longe since ceased. Augustin. Retract. l. 1. c. 13. Now S. Augustine doth in that place say, and proue the contrary; to wit, that though Miracles be not now ordinarily annexed vnto the office of teaching and administration of Sacraments, as they were in the Primitiue Church▪ yet Miracles are done, and frequently done, so that they are for multitude innumerable. I neuer meant (saith 
                           
                              August. lib. 1. retract. c. 13. 
                           he) as though that now no Miracles are done in the name of Christ, for that in Milan a Blind-man receaued his sight at the Shrine of the Martyrs; and sundry the like miracles my selfe did euen then know to haue been done: In which kind so many are wrought in this our age, as we neyther know thē all, nor can number them we know. How durst you name this testimony to proue Miracles to be ceased?
                        
                           Also that Miracles cannot be sufficient testimonyes of Christian Fayth, as the Si non opera in eis fecissem quae nemo alius fecit, peccatum non haberent. Ioan. 15.

                              De fide Catholica contra Sect. Anglican. l. 1. c. 7. §. 3. saying Haec adulterari possunt, &amp; ita exteriùs fingi, vt nō sint necessaria signa verae fidei. Miracles may so be adulterared and externally falsifyed, that they can not be necessary signes of the true Fayth. Thus you cite Suarez: but how grossely? These be not the wordes of Suarez, but wordes spoken by way of obiection in the behalfe of Protestants for their Paradoxe, That the Church is inuisible. This is then your argument in Suarez: Without fayth the true Church can not subsist. But there are no infallible, externall, &amp; visible signes of true fayth, seeing euen Miracles themselues may be forged and counterfaite. Ergo the Church cannot be assuredly knowne by visible markes. Suarez having vrged this argument with others largely, he sayth, 
                              Ibid. § 8. 
                           Notwithstanding all this, we must belieue the Church to be visible. And to the Argument about Miracles 
                              Ibid. c. 8. §. 9. Non ad cognoscendam singulorum credentium fidem, sed ad cognoscendam congregationem verè credentium. he sayth, that though they be not certayne tokens of the sanctity of the person that doth them, yet they are sufficient signes to proue, that true Fayth &amp; sanctify are in the Church wherein they are done. So that what Suarez the Iesuit setteth downe out of Protestants, as to be by him refelled, you produce as the assertion, and doctrine of Suarez.
                        
                        If you belieue, that God will seuerely punish those that deceaue soules in matter of Religion, by forgery and fraud; I wonder how you did not feare to cite

                           S. Chrysostome Homil. 3. vpon the Acts, as affirming, That no Monarchicall and supereminent actions were exercised by S. Peter, no vassallage or subiection

yielded him by the rest of the Apostles. In your margent you cite these wordes his: Petrus egit omnia, ex communi discipulorum sententia, nihil ex authoritate, nihil cum imperio. Peter did all thinges by common aduise of the disciples, nothing by way of authority and command. Thus you cite S. Chrysostome. Now see, your falshood. He saith not as you cite him, vniuersally Peter neuer did any thing by way of authority and command, but speaking of the electiō of S. Matthias, he sayth, that in this busines he did all by common aduise, not by way of authority: and then addeth presently, that this not vsing authority was wisedome and modesty, not want of authority in Peter. Behold his wordes so pregnant for Peters Monarchy, as nothing can be spoken more fully. Why doth he (Peter) communicate this busines with them? Quid? An non licebat ipse eligere? Licebat &amp; quidem maximè. Verumtamen non id fecit, ne cuiquam gratificari videretur. 
                           What? Had he not power to make the election him selfe? He might verily haue done it alone, without any question, but he did not, least he should be thought partiall to some one, had he chosen him by this sole authority. And agayne. This was the wisedome, and foresight of this Doctour: He sayd not, We alone are sufficient to teach; and although he had right to appoynt an Apostle, as much as they all had, (that is, he could alone haue done as much, as togeather with them in respect of his eminent power) yet this doing it with aduise, was agreable to the vertue of the man; and because eminency in spirituall power is not an Honour but Care of subiects, yet worthily

Church, did agaynst the lawes of the Church, take armes and were slayne in the field, In a battayle fought betwixt Henry Emperour &amp; Egbert Marquesse of Saxony. as men may iustly be in lawfull warre.
                        Now because the law of the Church censures such as strike Cleargymen, they that killed these wicked &amp; seditious priests in the field, had a scruple and demanded absolution, and pennance of their Bishop. The Bishop wrote of the matter to Pope Vrban, who answered: 
                              Iuo part. 10. c. 54. 
                           That although he did not iudge those, that thus had killed such Excommunicate persons in the battaile, to be murtherers, yet that the discipline of the Church might be kept, &amp; also because such as killed thē though the fact were lawfull, might haue had some sinister and insincere intention therein (as doing it out of priuate emnity,) that therefore the Bishop 
                           Secundū intentionem eorum, modum congruae satisfactionis iniunge. 
                           should according to their intention &amp; desire, inioyne them a measure of congruous pennance. Hence it followes, that it is no sinne to kill any excōmunicate person, euen Priests when they be inuaders of our life, and in iust warre; but vniuersally, that it is no sinne to kill any excommunicate person what way soeuer, is not Pope Vrbans Monstrous Doctrine, but a Monster of your Protestāt slaundering, out of a monstrous desire you haue to delude, and enrage men with lyes, agaynst the Catholicke Church.

which he had by perpetuall incorrigible hatred, for many yeares together, offered vnto his spirituall Father. Thus Baronius.
                        
                        Hence it is apparent, that as Baronius and Bellarmine were great friends in their life, so they are by you slaundered in the same māner after their death. That Bellarmine may seeme Turkish and guilty of propension to Turcisme, you make him say, The Scripture affirming a thinge, is not therefore to be belieued more then Mahomets Alcoran, whereas he only sayth conditionally, I should not firmely belieue the Scripture affirming a thinge, did I not aforehand belieue the Scripture to be diuine, as I do not the Alcoran though it say of it selfe, that it is of God. Euē so to make Baronius seeme more sauage then any Turke, wheras he sayth conditionally, If yonge Henry did restrayne his Father sincerely out of piety for the good of his Father, that he might returne to the Church, be absolued of excommunication, &amp; afterward peacebly inioy his Empyre, this kind of seuerity was indeed piety; you make the proposition absolute, and make Baronius say: It was piety in the Sonne, to vse Cruelty to his Father. The Reader, I do not doubt, seeth the exorbitancy of this false dealing.
                        I must needs adde another falsification you

This you bringe, as if Baronius had held, the Pope may make, and vn-make Decrees about the Truth of Fayth, making that to be Truth

which before was Errour, and that Errour which before was Truth So easily do you belieue &amp; charge any Barbarous and Inhumane conceyte vpon Catholicke Authors▪ But he that shall consider attentiuely the Antecedents &amp; Consequents of the place, will see▪ that Baronius speaketh not of Decrees of Fayth in regard of the truth of Doctrine (which are Eternall, and so immutable that if the Pope should endeauour to change them, he were

This would haue appeared had you cited the wordes of Baronius that immediatly follow. This is his whole sentēce: Hence 
                           
                              Baron. Tom. 4. pag. 306. Decreta sancita mu

                              are &amp; DECERNERE quibuscum à reliqua Ecclesia COMMVNICANDVM sit. 
                           it may appeare, that it did depend on the iudgment of the Roman Bishop to establish Decrees of Fayth, and to recall the established, and to DECREE with whome the rest of the Church were to keep COMMVNION. Hence it is euident that Baronius speaketh of Decrees of fayth declaratiue, with whome Communion in Fayth is to be kept, &amp; that those are mutable, as the Church shall see cause.
                        For the better vnderstanding whereof, we must know, that it was the practise or Heretikes, Sic Verba temperant, sic ambigua quaeque concinnā, vt nostram &amp; aduersariorum confessionē teneant. Hieron. epist. ad Pammach. &amp;▪ Ocean.
                            as S. Hierome noteth, to couch their Errours in such ambiguous wordes, that taken one way, they sounded Heretically &amp; another way, they carryed a Catholike sense. Hence vpon the arising of new Heretikes, euen the Catholike Fathers were sometymes deuised, some cōmunicating with, some denying communion vnto such Dogmatizants. The decision of these doubts is to be made by the Catholik Church,

and the supreme Pastour thereof, in which case the Church may change her decrees. For when there is sufficient reason to thinke that such propositions be taken by the Authours in the Hereticall sense, Decree is to be made, that no communion be held with them. If afterward it appeare by good proofe, that they meant the said propositions according to the Catholike sense, they may be receaued by some latter Decree, and the former Decree, about auoyding their Communion, may be repealed. In this sense true is the saying of S. Augustine: 
                           
                              Lib. 5. de Baptism. c. 1. 
                           That former Councels are reformed by later, when by experimēt of things what before was hidden commeth to light. In this sort ancient Councells In cōcilio Ephes. Christiparae nomē explosum est Canis. de B. Virg. l. 3. c. 19. made this decree of Fayth, that none should tearme the most Blessed Virgin 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           , Christs Mother, because by that Title Heretikes did meane tacitely to imply, that she was not 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           , Gods Mother. And yet this Decree of Faith is now by custome repealed, because it now appeareth that such as tearme her Christes Mother meane not therby to deny, that she is truly and verily Gods Mother.
                        This is that which Baronius saith: for speaking of the Apollinarians who did vtter their Errours

                            in doubtfull wordes, he saith, that first by Pope Damasus they were reiected as Heretikes, and Catholikes were forbidden to communicate with them. Afterwards these

                           Apollinarians falsely gaue out that the Councell of the Westerne Church, including principally the Roman Bishop, had againe receaued thē into Communion. Vpon the newes of this report, S. Gregory Nazianzen thus writeth. Those that agree with Apollinaris say, that they were admitted by the Councell of the West, or Roman Bishop, by whome it is

manifest they were once condemned: Yet 
                           Hoc ostē

                           that their doctrine doth agree with the true Fayth (for it cannot otherwise be,) if they haue obtayned this. This S. Gregory Nazianzen. Hence Baronius doth inferre against Heretikes that the Grecian Fathers did beare such reuerence vnto the Roman Church, and Roman Bishop, belieuing he could not erre, that if his Decrees declaratiue of doubtfull &amp; ambiguous propositions should change &amp; alter, they were ready to change and alter with him, and to thinke that manner of speach in matters of Faith most fitting for the present, which he did for the present allow. This I say, is all that Baronius doth affirme, not that the Pope may change his Decrees about the truth of the articles and mysteries of Fayth, as you in your blind auersion would impose vpō him, catching at words &amp; syllables of euery lesse cleere sentence, which to be the right iogge Aguntur spiritu maligno in pios, vt Satanicâ virulentia incensi, EORVM VERBA ET SCRIPTA NON MALOTIO SE INTERPRETARI non possint.

I must therefore remayne indebted vnto you for the rest, which are many hundreds, engaging my selfe to pay the last farthing of this debt, whensoeuer the same shall be exacted, with sufficient assurance that the performance thereof shall auayle, not only to your personall Disgrace, but also to the publicke Good, by conuersion of so many, by you miserably seduced, soules. Although I must confesse, that the former are so many, and so cleere, as they may sufficiently resolue such, as depend on you, of their miserable and dreadfull danger; and mooue them to returne to the truth, if they erre through weaknes of Vnderstanding, not through willfulnes of hart.

For though the first salutation carryed a shew of seuerity, yet your dismissing me was benigne and gratious, not only pardoning my earnestnes in defending the part of the Catholike Church, but also saying, What the Minister doth obiect against this narration, is refuted in M. Fishers Booke, about vntruths falsely layd to his charge.

                  I humbly craue pardon for offering so many particulers of our Rule vnto your Maiesties perusall, which I should not haue done, but out of a most strong desire to giue your Maiestie 
                        The Minister shapeth this argumēt into this forme: No Iesuite obseruing the Rules of his Order can meddle in state matters. Euery Iesuit obserueth the rules of his Order. Ergo, No Iesuit doth meddle in State matters. And thē in answere thereof he sayth: He that belieues the Minor, must be a stranger in the world, and haue liued an Anchoret, or Recluse in some Caue, who neuer heard of Campian, Parsons, Creswell, Garnet, Suarez, Bellarmin, &amp;c. I Answere, This doth shew the Innocē
                           cy of the Iesuits, seeing you can bring no examples of their dealing in State-matters, but such as are eyther ridiculously impertinent, or manifestly false. Was it matter of State, and not of Religion in Bellarmine to write agaynst the English abnegation of the Popes Authority? Or in Suarez, to write Contra sectam Anglicanam, the English Schisme and Heresy? Or in Philopater, to write for the Innocency of Catholike Priests? Or in Mariana, to giue instructions about the pious Education of a Christian Prince? In which writings if they hap to erre (as Mariana did not by way of assertion, but by way of doubt) doth this proue they dealt in state-matters? The Casuists that write about matters of Conscience, how farre Kinges may proceed without sinne and diuine offence in waging warre, exacting Tribute, and the like state-actions, do they deale in state-matters if perchance they hap to erre? What impertinency is this?
                        Now also see your falshood. That Fa. Parsons wrote the booke called Dole-man, you cannot proue, and he with oath denyed it, naming another secular Gentleman, as Authour. That M. Garnet had his annoynted fingar in the Gunpowder treason, is so false, as euen your Lord Cooke did not accuse his Fingars of dealing therein, but only his Eares for hearing thereof in Confession. What Catholike in Christendome, though an Anchoret or Recluse, hath not heard of the singular Innocency &amp; constancy of F. Campian, and of your Hereticall barbarity towards him? Cambden in your Protestant History [Elizab. pag. 336.] doth acknowledge, that the Queene (which she would not haue done, had she not been well assured of his Innocency) would no wayes a long tyme consent vnto his execution. At last, seeing your Ministeriall rage agaynst him would not belieue her to be truly a Protestant in heart vnlesse she imbrued her hands in his Innocent bloud [importunis precibus euicta permisit] being ouercome by your importunity, she permitted him to your cruelty (as Pilate did Christ to the Iewes) to be butchered, with sundry other Priests, [pleros

                        And yet if some Iesuit should agaynst his Rule meddle in State-matters, is this to be imputed to the Order? Did all the Apostles, and all the Angells keep their Order? Yea, seing you hold Ministers to be worthy of Religious Adoration [pag. 224.] and therfore more holy and venerable then Angells, I pray you, do they all keep their Orders, Rules &amp; Canons? Yet euery man is to be thought to keep the Rules of his Society and Incorporation, vntill the contrary be cleerly proued agaynst him. And when this is proued agaynst some one, that crime is to be taken as the fault of the person, not of the Order. This is the law of common Humanity, and the contrary proceeding of Ministers agaynst Iesuits, is Barbarous, and Sauage.

                  And as your Maiesty is a liuing Monumēt of that late Paragō of France, Henry the fourth, and of his wisdom and other Princely excellencyes; so why may we not intertayne a far off a hopefull thought that your Maiesty may one day be better informed against so many maleuolent suggestions; and see that they proceed from another origen then our desert, as that famous Heere also the Minister formeth the argument after his owne stāpe, as if the argumēt were grounded on the temporall prosperity of this King, saying: Your reuerence looketh this way: Henry the fourth a wise King was prosperous in his re-intertayning the Iesuits. Ergo, the King of great Britayne should do well to intertayne them. Did not the Minister looke asquint on Iesuites, he would not haue thus wrested the argument awry. The Argument is this: Henry a wise and prudent King, bitterly incensed against Iesuits through misinformation, by exact looking into their Institute and course of life, discouered, that only Maleuolency voyd of truth, did vent such accusatiōs agaynst them. Therefore the same may happen, and be hoped of an other as wise and prudēt a Prince. Temporall Prosperity, as it doth not euer accōpany the friends of Iesus, so neither the fauourers of Iesuits, nor I thinke the friends of Ministers. The first king in the world that euer loued Minister, was Christerne king of Denmarke, a fast friend vnto Luther, of whose miseries &amp; misfortunes all historyes are full.

I obserued (saith the same Author) the pleasure which he tooke in speaking of that action, and what content he receiued, when as a great Cardinall told him that by this restoring, his Maiestye had gotten two thousand learned pens for his seruice and perpetual fame. When as the Iesuits represented vnto him the Catalogue of Colledges, &amp; the thankes of the three Prouinces of France, he vsed these words vnto them, which should serue as an Epigraphe vpon all their houses: Assurance followes Confidence; I trust in you, assure your selues of me; with these papers I receiue the harts of all your company, and with the effects I will witnes mine vnto you.

                  For God, rich in mercy and goodnes, as he hath made your Maiesty partaker of his power &amp; authority in gouerning this inferiour world: so likewise he hath adorned you with many Excellent guifts, as Wisedome, Learning, Authority with forraine Princes, and Common Wealthes, made you beloued of your subiects, that on you are cast the eyes of all Christiā countryes, as on the person whom the Prince of peace, hath beyond the rest enabled, to Heere our Replicant shewes himselfe to be according to the Ministeriall kind, by railing at the Answerer, &amp; by scorning Peace and vnity, saying contemptuously: Forsooth to ioyne togeather againe the parts of Christē

                  If the requests of the pretended Reformers were such as the Roman Church might yield vnto them, without ouerthrowing the very foundations of the vnity of Fayth; if insteed of Catholike

principles misliked by them, they did propose such other of their owne, as she might see some probability▪ or allmost possibility of assured cōtinued peace likely to follow vpon her yielding in some points; feeling-Compassion (in regard of the wound of discord bleeding in the hart of Christendome) would moue her to the vttermost approach towards Protestāts, that the Law of God can permit, though with some disparagement to her Honour.
                  But so it is, that those that desire her reformation, be so many for number, and for opinions so deuided amongst thēselues, that it is impossible she should satisfy all.

                           uincing discourse of the Answerer, cōmeth forth with this syllogisme set downe in a distinct letter, ech proposition in a distinct line very maiestically. Whosoeuer abideth in errour, ought to reforme.
                        
                        
                           The Roman Church abideth in errour. Ergo,
                        
                           The Roman Church ought to reforme.
                        
                        
                           The Assumption (saith he) is manifest by the repugnancyes of the Roman doctrine with holy Scripture.
                        
                        Is not this most ridiculous? Against him I oppose this Syllogisme. The Minister forced by truth, doth acknowledge that by Theology which he calls Sophystrie, we giue seeming solutions vnto their arguments out of Scripture. pag. 581. But Arguments vnto which seeming solutiōs are giuen, be not manifest. Ergo, Protestants haue no manifest arguments to proue our Religion to be against Scripture, and so without ground breake the peace of Christendome.
                      Their conditions of peace are, that she reforme herselfe, by forsaking definitions of Generall Councells, Customes, Doctrines vniuersally receiued for many ages, tyme out of mind cōfessedly without any knowne beginning since the Apostles. Insteed of these meanes (so potent to stay staggering Consciences, and to keep the Christian world in peace) they present her with the Scripture, vnderstood The Minister heere very impudently denies that Protestants resolue by priuate illumination; whereas himselfe more then twenty times in this Reply, doth teach that ech Protestant doth lastly resolue by diuine illumination, whereby he seeth manifestly the resplendant verity of things belieued, as wil appeare afterward. by priuate illumination, the source of discord,

from which an Ocean of strife must needs flow. These things considered your most Iudicious Maiesty cannot but see, that her yielding would not compose debates already begun, but rather open a wide gappe vnto innumerable new braules, &amp; bring them into Kingdomes hitherto with such dissention vntoucht.
                  Wherfore there being no possibility that the Catholike part could gaine peace to Christendome by any yielding vnto our aduersaryes either reasonable, or vnreasonable; whither should louers of Concord turne themselues but vnto your Gratious Maiesty, that haue in your power the affections of Protestants, and therfore would be the Heere the Minister raileth vēting new scolding Phrases, Grosse errours, and the sharking rapine of the Romish Harpyes, trampling Gods truth, and Gods people vnder the foote of the inerrable, and vncontrollable Grand Seigneur, of the seauen-hilled-Citty, lewd Superstition, Roman tyrāny: tearming the Answerer impudent, bold, franticke, guided by an euill Genius, &amp; the like, onely for motioning vnto his Maiesty the meanes of the reunion of Christendome, and for his conceauing some possibility to giue satisfactiō which his maiesty himselfe doth allow that we should conceaue as possible, saying; Except she reforme herselfe, or else be ABLE to giue me satisfaction. fittest instrumēt for their Re-vnion with the Roman Church.

First, as a truth which is essentially the obiect of supernaturall affection, as of Hope, charity, contritiō, without which no man is saued. In this kind the Incarnation of the Son of God is most important. Secondly, as the principle, and meanes by which the said truth is proposed, without which the same cannot ordinarily be knowne. In this kind, most important it is to know the true Church. most important and maynest point of Controuersy, in which all other are inuolued, and by the decision therof resolued; the Church

If this Church be ouerthrowne, the totall certainty of Christianity cannot but with it togeather fall to the ground: if it be hidden, &amp; made inuisible, men must needes wander in the search of the first deliuered Christian doctrine, without end, or hope of euer arriuing

For apparent victory is that wherby men are forced to yield, or els to disclame from the authority of the Iudge. If the true Church be found out, and made Iudge, men may be forced by her sentence to yield vnto truth, or els to disclame from the Iudge: which yet we see is not done by the Scripture. For men that allowe the same Scripture to be Iudge, neyther are forced to yield vnto truth nor to appeale from the Scripture: yea sayth Luther Tom. 2. Witt. in Concion.

                           The first Argument.
                           First, what more Arrogant then to challenge ordinary illuminations more high, rare, and excellent then the Apostles had? The Apostles, though they had this priuiledge that Christian Religion was to them immediatly reuealed of God, yet did they not see the resplendent verity &amp; shi
                              
                                 •
                              ing truth of the Doctrine therof, but saw darkely, belieuing what they did not see, as S. Paul doth 1. Cor. 13.12. Videmus nunc in speculo in aenigmate: we se through a glasse darkely, that is, we be sure, by belieuing Gods word of what we do not see.
                               testify. Therefore illuminatiō shewing manifestly the truth of things belieued, challendged by Protestants, is more high, rare, and excellent light, then that the Apostles had, what greater Innumerabiles sunt qui se Videntes non solùm iactant, sed &amp; à Christo illuminatos videri volunt. Sunt autem haeretici Augustin. tract. 43. in Ioan.

Swenkfeldians equall themselues vnto the Apostles, pretending immediate reuelation and teaching from God, such as the Apostles had; but Protestants pretending to see manifestly the truth of things belieued, equall themselues vnto the Blessed, whose happines is to see Fides est credere quod nondum vides, cuius Fidei merces est videre quod credis. Augustin. de verb. Apostol. Serm. 29.
                               what we belieue; specially seing one point of the doctrine Protestants pretend to see, is the blessed Trinity, the true light and resplendent verity whereof a man cānot see manifestly without being blessed.
                        
                        
                           The second Argument.
                           Secondly, what greater Ignorance against the Rudiments of Christian Religion, then to resolue Christian fayth by the euidence and resplendent verity of the doctrine,

&amp; matter, and of things belieued? What is Diuine fayth but to belieue things we do Argumentum non apparētium. Hebr. 11.1. Fide credimus ea quae non videmus. Aug. de Gen. ad lit. l. 12. c. 31.

Aug. l. 1. retrac. c. 23. Et epist. 106. Fides meretur gratiam bene operandi. merit and please God, by shewing reuerence to his word; but what merit, or God-a-mercy is it to belieue what we see manifestly

Preachers &amp; Professors therof were neuer seene, nor can be named. Thus disorderly they place the Cart before the Horse: they know that their Religion is supernaturall truth, before they be sure that it is either the doctrine of the Church, or of the Apostles, or of God.
                        
                        
                           The fourth Argument.

                           The fifth Argument.
                           Fifthly, if no man be saued without diuine and supernaturall fayth, and if supernaturall fayth be resolued not by the authority of the Church of God, but by the resplendent verity of the Doctrine, what hope of saluation can wise and prudent men expect in the Protestant Church? Without diuine illuminatiō, making them to see the truth of things belieued, they cannot haue supernaturall fayth, nor be saued, if Protestants say true. Wise &amp; prudent men cannot be so fond, as to belieue that they see manifestly the truth of the things they belieue by Christian fayth, as the truth of the Trinity, of the Incarnation, of the Reall presence, of the Resurrection of the dead, and other like articles belieued: What Protestants are forced by this argument to contradict themselues. For, sometymes they teach, that fayth builded on the authority of the Church, is but human, and acquisite, not sufficient vnto Saluation. Thus our Minister pag. 14. And yet at other tymes, they teach that Nouices and weakelings haue fayth sufficient vnto saluatiō whose sayth is built vpon the authority of the Church: this also is taught▪ by the Minister pag. 22. saying: Nouices in fayth ground their historicall fayth vpon the authority of the Church.
                               then can they expect, but most certaine damnation in the Protestant Church, if this Protestant way to resolue supernaturall fayth, be the truth?

                        Concerning the light of Scripture. §. 3.
                        
                        CONCERNING the light of Scripture, two thinges are euident. First some arguments of probability may be drawne from the Scriptures, to proue they are of God, which serue for the comfort of Belieuers, and may somewhat incline Infidels to belieue vpō other greater motiues, to wit the authority of God &amp; his Church. This probable euidence, &amp; euident probability is al which the testimonies of Scholemen brought by the Minister, affirme.
                        Secondly, the Scripture hath not light to shew it selfe with euident certainty, to be the word of God, but is belieued to be such without being seene, as much as any other

point and mystery of fayth, to wit, vpon the word of God so reuealing deliuered by tradition.
                        This is demonstrated, because to be the word of God and the rule of fayth, is to be true and certayne, not only in some part
                              •
                            but also in al, &amp; euery part &amp; particle therof, so that, as sayth our 
                              Pag. 16. lin. 2.
                            Minister, no lyer can speake therein: and if 
                              Augustin. epist. 9. Si ad scripturas admittatur mēdacium, quid eis authoritatis remanebit? one sentence of Scripture be prooued false, the credit of the whole is lost. But it is impossible that any man should know by the light &amp; euidence of the sense and doctrine of Scripture, that the Scripture according to euery booke &amp; chapter, leafe and line, is certayne and assured truth, and that no lye or falshood is contayned therein, as these seauen Arguments euince.
                        
                           The first Argument.
                           First, because the 
                                 Hieron. epist. ad Aug. 19. inter epist. Aug. Scripturae obscurissimae sunt. Iren. l. 2. c. 47. Origen. lib. 7. contra Celsum. Reuerà multis locis obscurae. Vide Bellarm. de Script. l. 3. c. 1. Fathers teach, and

                                 Reply pag. 35. Minister, acknowledge, that there be many darke and obscure passages of Scripture; that the Scripture is full of innumerable difficultyes; that sometimes one Quid vel falsò suspicentur non inueniunt. Aug. l. 2. de doctr. Christ. c. 
                                       •

Quaedam loca de quibus nihil certo statui potest. can hardly so much as giue a probable guesse at their meaning: but these texts and places cannot be knowne to containe diuine truth &amp; no falshood by the euidēce of the doctrine▪ Therefore we cannot know the Scripture to be the word of God, that is, nothing but truth, by the euidence of the doctrine. Hēce

appeareth, that Protestants teaching that 
                                 •
                              he Scripture is known to be the word of God, and that no lye is contayned therein by the euidence and light of the doctrine, cōtradict themselues in saying, that in many places it is difficill and darke, as they cannot assuredly vnderstand it. For how can they know by the light of the sense, or doctrine, that the texts not vnderstood containe nothing but truth?
                        
                        
                           The second Argument.
                           Secondly the Scriptures are pretended to be known by the maiesty 
                                 Reply pag. 16. Internall matter &amp; maiesty of the bookes. Item pag. 30. &amp; 68. Field. appendix. 34. Caluin. Instit. l. 1. c. 7. &amp; purity of the doctrine, but though some mysteries of the Scriptures carry a maiesty in respect of naturall reason, and a shew of sublimity aboue it, as the Blessed Trinity; yet Sunt quaedā in sacris litteris quae quia suboffendunt animos ignaros &amp; negligentes sui (quae maxima turba) populariter accusari, defendi autem populariter propter mysteria quae in illis cō
                                 tinentur, non à multis admodum possunt. Aug. de vtil. cred. c. 1.
                               other points of Scripture seeme vnto reason ridiculous and childish: As that the serpent did speake to the woman; that Adam and Eue were naked without perceiuing themselues to be so; that there was day and night before the sunne was created, &amp; the like. Therfore we must haue some other &amp; surer ground then this maiesty of the doctrine, to be certayne that the Scripture is nothing but truth, &amp; Gods infallible word.
                        
                        
                           The third Argument.
                           Thirdly, wheras the 
                                 Reply pag. 19. Minister much vrgeth the harmony of Scripture, to proue

the same to be of God. Though this harmony appeare in diuers thinges, yet who doth not know, that innumerable seeming contradictions are obiected against Scripture, This is euident vnto al that haue read the cō
                                 mētaryes of the Fathers. many of which are only probably answered by the Fathers, many answered by thinges assumed without proofe, only because otherwise we must admit contradiction in Scripture, This appeareth particularly in the foure first chapters of Genesis, and in the Genealogy of our Sauiour. And in concording the Chronologyes of the Booke of Kings. some places not fully answered, but the Fathers were forced to fly from literall vnto allegoricall senses: how then could the ancient Fathers know the harmony of Scripture by the euidence of the thing, &amp; thereon ground their faith, that the Scripture is of God? Or if they could, not how can we? For what the Minister boastingly affirmeth 
                                 Reply pag. 24. lin. 15.
                               of himselfe and his fellowes, we find at this day a perfect harmony of all the parts of the Gospell among themselues, and a perfect agreement of the same with the Scriptures of the old Testament: This Ministeriall bragge, I say, of their finding the harmony of all Scriptures at this day, aboue all the Ancients, by the euidence of the thing, is incredible: for men cannot be more sure of the perfect harmony of Scriptures, then they are sure that all contradictions laid to the charge of Scripture, haue true solutions. But no man liuing euer was, or is sure by euidence, that all the solutions and answeres vsed to reconcile Scriptures, be the truth, no not Protestants. For did they vnderstand assuredly euery text of Scripture

and euery seeming contradiction is reconciled, could there be amōgst thē such different and aduerse exposition of Scripture? Therefore no man euer did, or doth know the perfect harmony of all Scriptures by the euidence of the thing, nor consequently the Scripture to be of God, by the euidence of this harmony.
                        
                        
                           The fourth Argument.
                           Fourthly, wheras the Minister pretends the Scripture to be known by the style affirming, that seeing God hath bestowed tongues and voyces on men by which they may be known, the Iesuite cannot persuade any reasonable man that God so speaketh in Scripture as men eleuated by grace cannot discerne the same to be his voyce and word. This is spoken with more confidence then consideration. God hath an Ioan. 1. Eternall Increate manner of speaking, to wit, the production of the Eternall Word, by which the Blessed discerne him from all other speakers, by the euidence of blisse-full learning; but no created manner of speaking This is also true whē God speaketh inwardly to the soule. For in that speaking he vseth the natiue intellectuall tongue, that is, the vnderstanding Faculty of the soule, his diuine inspirations being apprehensions of vnderstanding of the will and affections. Hence this inward speaking is not by the meere soūd knowne to be Diuine, but by the coniecture of some effects, or by speciall reuelation. is so proper to God, as it can be knowne to be his speaking by the meere sound of the voyce, without speciall reuelation, or els some consequent miraculous effect. Which I declare and proue by this argument. If there were a man that had no proper sound and accent of voyce, but could, and did exactly vse the voyce of euery man as he pleased; this man could not

be known by his voyce. Likewise if a man had no proper stile in writing, but could perfectly write the stile of any authour as he should thinke good; he could not be knowne from other writers by his phrase. But God hath no proper external sound or accent of voyce, nor any proper stile or phrase in writing, but vseth the prope

                           Now the matter is such as it doth not with euidence certainly shew it selfe to be nothing but truth, as hath beene prooued. Learned men, as hath been sayd, may from within Scripture gather arguments that probably perswade that the same is the word of God, but euident probability cannot be the ground of persuasion certayne and ineuident; it may be a comfortable cō

                           The fifth Argument.
                           If Scriptures be not cleere and euident but only to such as haue the light and faculty of fayth, they cannot be the prime principles of Fayth, euident in themselues,

&amp; not prooued by the principles of faith. This is cleere, because euery faculty supposeth her principles, &amp; by the light of them which the student bringes with him, she sheweth truths pertinēt vnto her skill that were hidden. But the Scriptures are not cleere and euident, but to such only as haue aforehand the light and faculty of fayth, yea they be dark &amp; obscure vnto Infidels, as not only the Verbum eius infidelibus nox est. Hilarius in cap. 10. Matth. 2. Caluin l. 1. Iustit. c. 8. n. 9.
                               Fathers teach, but also Protestants graunt. Therefore the Scriptures be not the prime principles of fayth supposed before fayth, which Infidells seeing to be true, resolue to belieue the mysteryes of Fayth; but only are secondary truths darke and obscure in themselues, belieued vpon the prime principles of fayth.
                        
                        
                           The sixt Argument.
                           Hence ariseth the sixt argument which is à priori. If Scriptures may be prooued by the light of a superiour principle of Fayth, they are not the prime principles of sayth euident in themselues and indemonstrable. But Scripture is prooued by a superiour &amp; more euident principle of faith. For the doctrine of the Scripture is proued to be true, because God the prime verity authour of Scripture cannot deceaue, nor be deceaued. Now, that prime verity cannot deceaue nor be deceaued is a principle of fayth superiour and more euident then that the Scriptures be of God and diuine.

Therfore Scripture is not the supreme indemonstrable principle of Fayth, but is proued to be truth by the authority of God reuealing it; to be of God by the miracles of the Apostles publishing it; to be the Apostles by the tradition of the Church, deliuering it as such; euen as all as other mysteryes of Fayth are proued.
                        
                        
                           The seauenth Argument.
                           Finally Protestants for this their fancy of finall resolution of fayth by the resplendēt verity of the doctrine, haue not any argument worth a rush. Their chiefe Argument are two. First, Scripture is a principle of fayth; but principles are to be euident in themselues, and to be knowne by their own light. This argument (much &amp; often vrged by you, &amp; your 
                                 Way pag. 37. Defence cap. 20. Brother) is seely, because al principles must not be euidēt in thēselues, but only the first &amp; prime principles of euery faculty or hability of knowledge, as all know. But Scriptures are not (as hath been shewed) the prime principles of fayth, but are secondary principles, which being known, we by the light of them may know many other things.
                           The second argument. This argument is vrged by the Minister pag. 16. and often elswhere. The Scripture is light, for the word of God is light, and Scripture is the word of God. But euery light is euident in it selfe, and knowne by the euidence it hath in it selfe. Therefore the Scriptures must of themselues appear
                                 •
                              
                              
and shew that they are diuine truth. I Answere, the Minor of this Argument is false, &amp; the whole argument grounded vpon ignorance, in not discerning a difference betwixt corporall &amp; spirituall light. True it is, that euery corporal light that doth enlighten the eye of body must be euident in it selfe &amp; primely &amp; originally cleere, but not so euery truth that illustrates mans vnderstāding. The reason is, because the eye of body cannot by thinges seene, inferre &amp; conclude things that are hidden, but only can apprehēd what doth directly and immediatly shew it selfe. But mans Vnderstanding not only apprehends what sheweth it selfe, but by things knowne inferreth &amp; breedeth in it selfe knowledge of thinges hidden.
                           Hence vnto Vnderstanding, though things shewing themselues directly, and by their owne light, be her prime principles, and meanes to know other thinges; yet also things hidden in themselues being formerly knowne by the light of authority, may thereby become lights, that is, meanes to know yet further of things hidden. So that speaking of spirituall and intellectuall lights, it is false that all lights enlightening mans Vnderstanding to know other thinges, are euident in themselues; yea some secondary Principles and Lights there are, which must be shewed by superior light, before they become lights. In which kind is the Scripture, being a Light vnto the faythfull, because knowne by the Churches perpetuall Tradition to be from the Apostles, by the Apostles miraculous authority to be of God, by Gods supreme Verity who cannot deceaue, nor be deceaued, to be the truth.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     THE SECOND PART. About the Catholike Resolution of Fayth.
                     NO doubt but that to the end a man may belieue, diuine inward illuminatiō annointing his hart is necessary. The question is, what is the externall infallible ground vnto which Diuine inspiration moueth men to adhere, that they may be setled in the true sauing fayth? The answere in few words is this. The Resolution of true Religion is firmely assured about foure Principles, agaynst foure Enemyes, by foure Perfections belonging vnto God, as he is Prima veritas, Prime and Infinite Verity, that cannot deceaue, nor be deceaued. This I declare and proue.
                     
                        The first Principle prooued. §. 1.
                        
                        THE first Enemy of true Christian Religion is the Pagan, 
                           Dicunt pagani, Ben

                           Philosopher, who is persuaded he may attayne vnto perfect felicity and Sanctity by the knowledge of sole naturall truth. Against this enemy is the first principle of true Christian Religion, The Doctrine of Saluation, is that only which was reuealed of God vnto his Prophets. About this Principle true belieuers are resolued by a perfection which in the first place belonges vnto God as he is Prime &amp; Infinite verity, to wit, that he cannot lye nor reueale any vntruth when he speaks immediatly himselfe by secret inspiration. Hēce we thus resolue. God the Prime

verity cannot reueale vntruth, specially about the State-matters of saluation when he speakes by secret inspiration immediatly himselfe. But he reuealed in this manner by inspiration vnto his Prophets, that men cannot serue him truly, nor be saued without knowing supernatural truthes beyond the As mans felicity, the blissfull visiō of God, is aboue the forces of Nature: so it was conueniēt God shold bring him vnto it by belieuing truth aboue the reach of his reason. reach of Reason, which truthes in particular he reuealed vnto them. Therfore the doctrine of saluation is supernaturall truth, such as was reuealed of God vnto his Prophets and others, whome he did vouchsafe to teach immediatly by himselfe, and send them to be the teachers of the world.
                        This the prime and highest principle of Christian resolution Protestants not in expresse words, but in deeds, and by consequence, reiect from being the stay of their fayth. For as they that belieue the doctrine of Aristotle lastly and finally by the light and euidence therof, because it sheweth it selfe to be conformable to reason, do not build vpon the authority of Aristotle, nor vpon his bare world; euen so they that belieue the doctrine of Scripture by the light &amp; resplendent verity thereof, because it shewes it selfe to be diuine and heauenly truth, as Protestants pretend to doe, do not build vpon the authority of God the authour and doctour of Scripture, nor his bare, meere, &amp; pure word. This is most euident for who doth not see that it is one thing to belieue the word of some Doctour by the light of the doctrine, and another to belieue his word through reuerence vnto his authority, as knowing him to be infallible in his word? Hence the Protestant fayth is so independent of the authority of God, as though God were not prime verity, but fallible in his words, yet their fayth

might subsist as now it doth. This is cleere, because let one be neuer so fallible and false, yet when his sayings shew themselues to be true, we may (yea we cannot but) belieue his word, in respect of the resplendent verity therof. But Protestants pretend that the sayings of Scripture shew themselues to be true by the light &amp; lustre of the Doctrine belieued therin, &amp; vpon this resplendēt verity they build lastly their fayth: Therfore though God were fallible, &amp; might be false, yet their fayth, that his Scripture is truth, which sheweth it selfe to be truth by the resplendent verity of the doctrine, might subsist. Is this the true Christian fayth which depends not vpon Gods being the Prime and Infallible Verity? which giues no more credit vnto God▪ then men wil giue vnto a lyar, to wit, to belieue him so farre as they see him? To credit the word of his teaching so farre as it sheweth it selfe to be truth by the light of the doctrine? Verily this forme of Fayths resolution is grosse and vnchristian, which I am persuaded Protestants would not mantayne, did they well vnderstand what they say, or could they find some other way of Resolution, wherby they might know what doctrine is the Apostles, and therfore Gods, without being bound to relye vpon the Tradition of the Church.
                     
                     
                        The second Principle demonstrated. §. 2.
                        
                        SOME will say, God is prime Verity, by whose word we cannot be deceaued: But how prou
                              •
                            you these pretended diuine reuelations to be truly such? Here cōmeth in the second enemy of true Religion, who following his blind passion labours to depriue

the world of the proofes of diuine reuelations that are more euident then the Sunne. This Enemy is the Iew, who graūting the doctrine of saluation to be supernaturall truth reuealed of God, denies the reuealed doctrine of God to be Apostolicall, that is, the doctrine which the Apostles preached to the whole world as the doctrine of saluation. Agaynst this Enemy is the second Principle of true Religion, The Doctrine of saluation reuealed of God is no other, but Apostolicall, that is, which the Apostles published to the world. About this principle true belieuers are resolued by a second perfection of the prime Verity, which is, That he cannot with his seale, that is with miracles and workes proper to himselfe, warrant or subsigne falshood, deuised or vē
                              ted by any man. Hence we make this resolution. God being Infinite verity cannot by signe and miracle testify falshood deuised and vented by men: God hath by manifest miracles testifyed the doctrine of the Apostles to be his word and message: Ergo, the same is not a false religion inuented of men, but the doctrin of Saluation reuealed of God.
                        The miracles by which the Prime verity hath giuen testimony vnto the Apostles doctrine may be reduced vnto foure heades. First the miraculous predictions of the Prophets, most cleerly &amp; punctually fullfilled in Christ Iesus, his B. Mother, his Apostles, his Church. Secondly, the miraculous workes in all kindes which Christ Iesus, and his disciples haue wrought, which are so many, so manifest, so wonderfull &amp; aboue nature, as we cannot desire greater euidences. Thirdly, the miraculous conuersion of the world, by twelue poore vnlearned Fisher-men, the world (I say) which thē was in the flowre of human

pride &amp; glory, in the height of human erudition and learning bringing them to belieue a doctrine seemingly absurd in reason, to follow a course of discipline truly repugnant vnto sensuality, to imbrace a way of saluation so contemptible in the eye of men, that verily, the worke of the worlds creation doth not more cleerly discouer God the Authour of Nature, then this of the worlds Conuersion doth shew it selfe to proceed from the Authour of grace. Fourthly, the miraculous cōtinuance of a Christian Catholike Church, spread ouer the world, foretold by our Sauiour, notwithstanding so many persecusecutions by the Iewes, Heathens, Heretikes, Polititians, and dissolute Christians.

                           Bellarmine sayth, we cannot know euidētly that miracles are true, for if we did, we should know euidently that our fayth is true, &amp; so it should not be faith. I Answer, that such euidēce as doth exclude the necessity of pious reuerence, &amp; affection vnto Gods word, euidence I say, enforcing men to belieue, cannot stand with true fayth. If we knew by Mathematicall or Metaphysicall euidence that the miracles of Christ, and his Apostles were true, perchance this euidence would compell men to belieue, and ouercome the naturall obscurity and seeming impossibility of the Christian doctrine. And therefore, as Bellarmine sayth, we cannot be mathematically and altogeather infallibly sure by the light of nature, that miracles are true.
                        Notwithstanding we must not deny what Scriptures

For the mystery of the Trinity, of the Incarnation, of the Reall Presence, and the like seeme to reason as impossible, as any miracle can seeme euident vnto sense. Hence when fayth is proposed by miracles, ariseth a conflict betwixt the seeming euidence of the miracles, and the seeming darkenes and falshood of the Christian doctrine.

                        The third Principle demonstrated. §. 3.
                        
                        BEING resolued that the doctrine of God is sauing truth, &amp; the Apostles doctrine the doctrine of God, we meete with a third Enemy who labours to driue vs out of the beatē high way, to know what doctrine is the Apostles. This Enemy is the Heretike, a domestike Enemy, and therfore more dangerous. These men graunt the doctrine of Saluation to be supernaturall and reuealed, the reuealed to be the Apostolicall, and no other; but they will haue the rule of knowing what doctrine the Apostles taught to be speciall illumination of the spirit, not Catholike Tradition. For there is a double kind of Tradition from the Apostles, that may be pretended. The one publicke, by the vniforme perpetuall teaching of Pastours. The other secret by the teaching of some priuate men, pretending to haue been taught more singularly and highly, then other men by the Apostles. The second kind of Tradition hand to hand from the Apostles, by the secret teaching of an inuisible Church, Heretikes haue pretended, but neuer the first of publike and Catholike Tradition.
                        The cause why Heretikes prescribe the course to resolue by illuminations, is, because an Heretike will not admit doctrines deliuered vnto him by the consent of his Christian Ancestors, but with choyce

receaue some, and reiect others, as he findeth good. Whence he hath the

Hence, agaynst this way of Catholike Tradition he bandeth with might and mayne, charging the same to be fallible, that errours may secretly creep into it, teaching men to retyre vnto the inward teaching of the spirit, as the only secure meanes to know which be the Apostolicall Scripturs, which the Apostolicall interpretation of them.
                        Agaynst this Enemy is the third principle of true Christian Religion, The Apostolicall doctrine is the Catholike, to wit, the doctrine that is deliuered from the Apostles by the Tradition of whole Christiā worlds of Fathers, vnto whole Christiā worlds of Childrē, that in matters of Christiā Religion, Heresy, that is, priuate election and choyce may haue no place. About this principle, faith is resolued and assured by a third perfection belonging to God, as he is Prime Verity. This is, that he cannot so much as conniue vnto falshood whereby he become any way accessory of deceauing then that simply, readily, religiously belieue what they haue iust reason to thinke to be his word. But there is iust and sufficient reason to belieue that doctrine deliuered by ful and perpetuall Tradition, hand to hand from the Apostles, is verily their doctrine, and therefore Gods.

                           Ergo God being the prime verity cannot permit Catholicke Christian Tradition to be falsifyed.

                        HENCE is answered the common Obiection which Protestants make, that Tradition of doctrine from hand to hand made by men, is fallible, &amp; subiect to errour, for they may deceaue, or be deceaued. If We answere, that Christian Catholicke Tradition of doctrines is infallible, through Gods speciall assistance, They reply, this infallibility of traditiō through diuine assistāce cannot be knowne but by the Scripture, and so before we can build our fayth on Tradition as infallible, we must know the Scripture to be the word of God, and consequently we cannot build our persuasion of the Scriptures being Apostolicall and diuine, on Tradition, except we comit a Circle.
                        I Answere. First, that Catholicke Tradition is proued to be Est sū
                              mus gradus certitudinis humanae de qua SIMPLICITER dici potest, nō posse illi falsum subesse. Suarez de gratia l. 9. c. 11. n. 11. Et hoc ibid. probat. simply infallible, by the very nature thereof. For Traditiō being full report about what was euident vnto sense, to wit, what doctrines and Scriptures the Apostles publickly deliuered vnto the world, it is impossible it should be false. Worlds of men cannot be vniformely mistaken and deceaued about a matter euident to sense, and not being deceaued, being so many in number, so deuided in place, of so different affectious and conditious, it is impossible they Neglexerit officiū suum Villicus Christi &amp;c. Quî verisimile, vt tot &amp; tantae Ecclesiae in vnam fidem errauerint? variasse debuerat error Ecclesiarū. Caeterùm, quod apud multos vnū inuenitur, non est erratū sed traditum. Tertullian. de praescript. c. 28.
                            should so haue agreed in their tale, had they maliciously resolued to deceaue the world. Wherefore it is impossible that what is deliuered by full Catholicke tradition from the Apostles,

should be a thing by the traditioners first deuised. Secondly, I say, that how soeuer human Tradition may be by nature fallible, yet the Christian Catholicke is assisted of God that no errour can creep into the same. Which diuine assistance to be due vnto it, is demonstrated by the perfection of Diuine verity, &amp; by the nature of tradition, precedently &amp; independently of Scripture, and therefore without any Circle by two Arguments.
                        The first is the same we before touched. God be
                           
                              •
                           ng Prime Verity cannot conniue, that the meanes of conueying the Apostles doctrine vnto posterity which bindeth Religious belieuers to receaue the same as his word, should secretly be infected with damnable Errour. For being Infinit Verity in his knowledg, this cannot be done without his priuity. Knowing thereof, being infinit veracity in his teaching the truth, he cannot yield that the meanes of conueying his truth obliging men to belieue, should 
                              •
                           mperceptibly be poysoned, whereby men for their deuotion vnto his Verity incurre damnation. This being so, I assume: But the Catholicke tradition of doctrine from the Apostles bindeth Christians to whome it is deliuered, to belieue the same as Gods word. This I proue. When doctrine is sufficiently proposed as Gods word, men are bound to belieue it. But that is sufficiently proposed as Gods word vnto Christians which is vnto them sufficiently proposed 
                              •
                           s Doctrine of the Apostles. Now, that Catholicke Tradition of doctrine from the Apostles is sufficient proposition and proofe, that that Doctrine is the Apostles, is proued; first because Catholicke tradition of doctrine is by nature simply infallible, as hath bin shewed,

but proposition knowne simply to be infallible, is sufficient to bind men to belieue. Secondly, Catholicke tradition, that is, the report of a world of Ancestors cōcerning sensible matters of fact, is so pregnant and obligatory, as it were insolent madnes to deny it. In so much, as euen 
                              Caluin. Institut. l. 1. c. 8. n. 9. Quaerunt quis nos certiores fecerit à Moyse &amp; aliis Prophetis haec fuisse scripta quae sub eorum nominibus legū
                              tur &amp;c. quis non colaphis &amp; flagellis castistandum illum insanum dicat? Certô certiùs est ipso rum scripta non aliter peruenisse ad posteros, quàm de manu in manū TRADITA. Caluin sayth, that such as deny the tradition of Ancestors concerning the authors of the Canonicall bookes, are rather to be reformed with a Cudgell, then refuted by Argument. Thirdly, God himselfe sendeth children vnto the tradition of their Ancestors to learne of them the sensible workes of his miraculous power done in former ages, 
                              Deuteron. 32.7. 
                           Aske thy Father and he will tell thee, thyne Auncestors and they will certifye thee. Fourthly, the proofe of tradition is so full and sufficient as it conuinceth infidels. For though they be blind not to see the doctrine of the Apostles to be Diuine, yet are they not so voyd of common sense, impudent and obstinate as they will deny the doctrine of Christian Catholicke tradition to be truly Christian &amp; Apostolical. Whence two thinges are euident. First, that Catholicke tradition from the Apostles is an externall sufficient proposition, and a conuincing argument that the doctrin so deliuered is Apostolicall, &amp; consequently Diuine reuealed Doctrine. Secondly, that Heresy which stands agaynst this tradition, 
                              〈◊〉
                            willfull obstinacy and madnes, and worse then Paganisme.
                        The second argument. God being Prime verity binding all men that will be saued to know and firmely belieue the Apostles doctrine, euen vntill the worlds end, cannot conniue that the only Meanes to know this doctrin perpetually, and euer after the

                           dhere vnto an infallible externall ground of assurance

proposed vnto him, God by the helpe of his grace making him apprehend diuinely of the authority thereof. This second manner of inward assurance is ordinarily giuen vnto euery Christiā, without 
                              Triden. sess. 6. Can. 3. Arausican. 2. Can. 6.
                            which no man is able to belieue supernaturally, and as he ought vnto Saluation. The first manner of assurance is extraordinary, and immediate reuelation, such as the Prophets had. Wherfore Protestants, if they callenge this first manner of inward teaching &amp; assurance, they approue Enthusiasme, &amp; immediat reuelatiō, which in the Swenkfeldians they seeme to condemne. If they challenge only the second manner of inward teaching and assurance, then besides inward light, they must assigne an externall sufficiēt ground why they belieue these Scriptures to be the Apostles, &amp; then I aske what ground this is besides Tradition?
                        Secondly, they wil obiect, that though they haue no infallible ground besides the teaching of the Spirit, yet they are not taught immediatly in Propheticall māner because they are also taught by an external probable motiue, to wit the Churches tradition. I Answere, that except they assigne an externall infallible meanes besides Gods inward teaching, they cannot auoyde, but they challenge immediate reuelation. For whosoeuer knoweth thinges assuredly by the inward teaching of the spirit, without an external infallible motiue vnto which he doth adhere, is assured prophetically, though he haue some externall probable motiues so to thinke. S. Peter had some coniecturall signes of Simon Magus his peruersity &amp; incorrigible malice; yet seing 
                              Act. 8.32. In felle amaritudinis &amp; obligatione peccati video te esse. he knew it assuredly, we belieue he knew it by the light of

prophesy, because besides inward assurance he had no externall infallible ground. If one see a man giue publickly almes▪ though he perceaue probable tokēs &amp; signes that he doth it out of a Vayne-glorious intention; yet cannot he be sure therof but by the light of immediat reuelation, because the other tokens are not grounds sufficient to make him sure. For if a man be sure, &amp; haue no ground of this assurance in any thinge out of his owne hart, it is cleere, that he is assured immediatly, &amp; only by Gods inward speaking. Wherfore Protestāts, if they will disclayme in truth, and not in wordes only from immediate reuelation and teaching, they must eyther grant tradition to be infallible, or else assigne some externall infallible ground besides Tradition, whereby they are taught what Scriptures the Apostles deliuered.
                        Thirdly, they will say they know the Scriptures to be from the Apostles, by an externall infallible ground besides Tradition, to wit, by certayne lights, lustres, euidences of truth, which they see to blaze, &amp; emane from the thinges reuealed in Scripture, by which they are sure that the doctrin thereof is heauenly. I Answere, If they did see such lustres and lights that cleerly, &amp; not only probably, conuince the doctrine of Scripture to be heauenly truth, they be not indeed assured by immediate darke reuelation, but by an higher degree of heauenly knowledge, to wit, by the supernaturall light and euidence of the thinge belieued, which is a paradox, and pretence farre more false, and sensibly absurd, then is the challenge of immediate reuelation, or Enthusiasme, as hath beene shewed. Wherefore, seing that God hath chosen no externall meanes besides Catholicke Tradition

to make men know perpetually, vntill the consummation of the world, what doctrins &amp; Scriptures the Apostles published, it is cleere vnto euery Christian, that this is the meanes by him chosen, &amp; which he doth assist, that it cannot be obnoxious vnto errour: so that precedently and independently of Scripture, the Catholicke tradition of Christian pastors &amp; fathers is proued to be infallible, through Diuine speciall assistance, and therefore a sufficient ground for Fayths infallible assurance.
                     
                     
                        The Fourth Principle proued. §. 6.
                        
                        IF we be resolued, that sauing truth is that which God reuealed, that he reuealed that which the Apostles published, the doctrine published by then the Catholicke Christian Tradition, our search is ended, when we haue found the Christian Catholicke Church. Heere the fourth Enemy of true Christian Religion offers himselfe, to wit, the Willfull Ignorant. These kind of men not only hold agaynst Pagans, the doctrine of saluation to be that only which was reuealed of God; agaynst Iewes, the reuealed of God to be only the Apostles, but also in wordes they condemne the Heretikes &amp; professe that no doctrine is truly Apostolicall but the Catholick; yet in resoluing what doctrin is the Catholicke, they follow the partiality of their affections. These are tearmed by 
                              De vtil. cred. c. 1. 
                           S. Augustine, Credentes haereticorum, Belieuers of Heretikes, building vpon the seeming learning and sanctity of some men; being therein so willfull, as to venture their soules that such doctrine is Catholike, not caring nor knowing what they say, nor what the word Catholicke put into the Creed by the Apostles

doth import. Some be so ignorant, as to thinke that the word Catholicke doth signify the same, as conforme vnto Scripture. And so what doctrine is Catholicke, they resolue by the light and lustre of the doctrine, or by the in ward teaching of the spirit, whereby they fall vpon the principle of Heresy, and become not so much belieuers of Heretikes as Heretikes. Some vnderstand by the word Catholicke, Doctrine truly Catholicke, that is, deliuered frō the Apostles by Christian worlds of Fathers, vnto Christian worlds of children, yet are so blind as to giue this Title vnto Sects lately sprung vp, which through pretended singular Illuminations, gotten by perusing the Scripture, haue chosen formes of fayth opposite one agaynst another, reformed agaynst the forme to them deliuered by their Ancestors: These Sects I say, they tearme Catholicke, which not to be Catholicke in this sense, is as euident as that night is not day.
                        Some through willfull ignorance, no lesse grossely deuide the name of Catholicke according to the diuision of Countryes, naming the Catholicke doctrin of the Church of France, of the Church of England &amp;c. Which speach hath no more sense, then this: A fashion euer since Christ vniuersally ouer the world, newly begun, and proper vnto England.
                        Agaynst this Enemy true Religion is resolued in this fourth principle, The Catholicke Tradition of doctrine from the Apostles is the Roman. By Roman we vnderstand not only the Religion professed within the Citty &amp; Diocesse of Rome, but ouer the whole world by them that any where acknowledg the primacy of Peter and his successours, which now is the

Roman Bishop. About this principle fayth is assured by a fourth perfection belonging vnto God, as he is prime Verity reuealing truth, which is, that he cannot permit, that the knowing of sauing doctrine be impossible.
                        Hence I argue: God being Prime Verity reuealing, cannot permit the meanes of knowing his sauing truth to be hidden, nor a false meanes to be so adorned with the markes of the true, as the true become indiscernable from it. But if the Roman be not the true Catholicke Tradition, the true Catholicke Church and Tradition is hidden, yea a false Church hath so cleerly the markes of Catholicke, that no other can with any colour pretend to be rather Catholicke then it, that is, to haue doctrin deliuered from the Apostles, by whole worlds of Christian Fathers vnto whole worlds of Christian Children Hence eyther there is no meanes left to know assuredly the sauing truth, or else the meanes is immediat reuelatiō, that is, inward teaching of the spirit, without any externall infallible meanes, or else Scripture knowne to be the word of God, and truly sensed, by the light, lustre, and euidēce of the things: which wayes of teaching, it is certayne, God doth not vse towards his militant Church succeeding the Apostles. For teaching of diuine and supernaturall truth by the light, lustre, and shining of the thing or doctrin, is proper vnto the Church triumphant. Inward assurance without any externall infallible ground to assure men of truth, is proper vnto the Prophets, and the first publishers of Christian Religion. Hence I conclude, that if God be the Prime Verity, teaching Christian Religion darkely without

making men see the light, and lustre of thinges belieued, and mediatly by some externall infallible meanes, vpon which inward assurance must rely; then he must euer conserue the Catholicke tradition, and Church, visible and conspicuous, that the same may without immediat reuelation, and otherwise thē by the lustre of doctrin be discerned, to wit, by sensible markes.
                        If any obiect, that the senses of mē in this search may be deceaued through naturall inuincible fallibility of their organs, and so no ground of fayth that is altogether infallible. I Answere, that euidence had by sense being but the priuate of one man, is naturally and physically infallible; but when the same is also publicke and Catholicke, that is, when a whole world of men concurre with him, then his euidence is altogether infallible. Besides, seing God hath resolued not to teach men immediatly, but will haue them to cleaue vnto an externall infallible meanes, &amp; to find out this meanes by the sensible euidence of the thinge, he is bound by the perfection of his Veracity to assist mens senses with his prouidence, that therein they be not deceaued when they vse such diligence as men ordinarily vse, that they be not deceaued by their senses. Now, what greater euidence cā one haue that he is not deceaued in this matter of sense, that the Romā Doctrine is the Catholicke, that is, Doctrine deliuered from the Apostles by worlds of Christian Ancestors, spread ouer the world, vnanimous amongst themselues in all matters they belieue as Fayth; what greater assurance I say, can one haue, that herein he seeth aright, then a whole world of men professing to see the same that he doth?
                        
                           Some may agayne obiect, I belieue the Catholicke Church is an Article of Fayth set downe in the Creed, but Fayth is resolution about thinges that are not seene. I Answere, An article of Fayth may be visible according to the substāce of the thing, &amp; yet inuisible according to the manner it is belieued in the Creed. The third article, He suffered vnder Pontius Pilate, was crucifyed, dead and buried, according to the substance of the thinge, was euident vnto sense, and seen euen of the Iewes, and is now belieued of their posterity. But according to the manner as it is belieued in the Creed, to wit, that herein the Word of God by his auncient Prophets was fulfilled, that this was done in charity for the saluation of Man; in this manner (I say) that visible Article is inuisible, and belieued in the Creed. In like māner that there is in the world a Catholicke Church, and that the Roman is the Catholicke Church, Pagans, Iewes, &amp; Heretikes (if they shut not their eyes agaynst the light) do cleerly behold: But that herein the word of God about the perpetuall amplitude of his Church is accomplished, that this is an effect of Gods Veracity, to the end that the meanes to learne sauing truth may not be hidden; this is a thing inuisible, &amp; according to this notiō the Catholicke Church is proposed in the Creed. Secondly, propositiōs of fayth must be inuisible according to the Predicate, or thinge belieued; but not euer according to the subiect or thing wherof we belieue. The thinges the Apostles belieued of Christ, to wit that he was the Sauiour of the world, the Son of God, were thinges inuisible; but the subiect and person of whome they did belieue, was to them visible &amp; seen; yea God did of purpose by his Prophets fortell certayne

tokens, whereby that subiect might by sense be seen and discerned from all other, that might pretend the name of Christ or els his coming into the world to teach the truth, had been to no purpose. In this sort the Predicate, or thing belieued in this article the holy Catholicke Church, to wit Holy is inuisible, but the Subiect, to wit, the Catholicke Church which we affirme and belieue to be holy in her doctrine, is visible and conspicuous vnto all. Yea God hath of purpose foretold signes and tokens whereby the same by sense may be cleerly discernable from all other that may pretend the title of Catholicke. For were not this subiect, the Catholicke Church, we belieue to be holy and infallible in her teaching, visible and discernable from all other that pretend the name; of what vse were it to belieue that there is such an infallible teaching Church in the world, hidden we know not where, as a needle in a bottle of hay?

                        THESE thinges supposed, the Reader will haue no difficulty to discerne how friuolous the Ministers exceptions are agaynst the resolutiō of fayth in respect of belieuing doctrines to be the Apostles into Perpetuall Tradition; and how solide the Iesuits discourse was, which here ensueth.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  THE FIRST GROVND.
                  
                     That a Christian resolution of Fayth is builded vpon perpetuall Tradition, deriued by succession from the Apostles. §. 1.
                     
                     BEFORE I come to the proofe of this principle some things are to be presupposed, which I thinke Protestants will not deny. First, that no man can be saued, or attayne to the blissefull vision of God, without firme and assured apprehension of diuine &amp; supernaturall truth concerning his last end, and the meanes to arriue thereunto. Secondly that this assured apprehension is not had by a The Minister heere graunteth, that Fayth is not had by cleere &amp; euident sight: but afterward he sayth the same is resolued by the resplendent verity of the doctrine. cleare and euident sight, nor gotten by demonstration or humane discourse by the principles of reason, nor can be sufficiently had by credit giuen to meerly humane authority, but only by Fayth grounded on the word of God, reuealing vnto men things that otherwise are knowne only to his Infinite wisdome. Thirdly, that God reuealed all these verityes to Christs Iesus, and he

Fiftly, though the Apostles be departed, &amp; their primitiue Hearers deceased, yet there still remaynes a meanes in the world, by which all men may assuredly know what the Apostles preached, and the primitiue Church receyued of them, seing the Church euen to the worlds end must be 
                           Ephes. 2.20. &amp;c. 4.5.11. founded on the Apostles, and belieue nothing as matter of Fayth, besides that which was deliuered of them.
                     These things being supposed the question is, What this meanes is, and how men may now adayes, so many ages after their death, know certainly what the Apostles taught originally, &amp; preached?
                     To which question I answere, that the last and finall resolution Note that the Minister many tymes doth falsify the Iesuits Tenet, specially pag. 34. saying, That the last and finall resolution is into vnwritten Tradition, &amp; not into Scripture. This he doth not say, but that the persuasion that our Fayth is true, is finally resolued into the authority of God reuealing, and that it is Diuine, into the Apostles miraculous preaching. But what doctrine was taught by the Apostles we know only by Tradition. therof, is not into Scripture, but into the perpetuall tradition of the Church succeeding All from this place vnto the first argument the Minister leaueth out being the substance of the whole discourse, yet he sayth, he hath set down the booke verbatim. See his Preface. the Apostles, according to the principle set downe by Tertullian in the beginning of his golden (by Protestants commended) Booke,

By which Prescription ioyned with the other fiue suppositions, is raysed the Ladder for true Catholike resolution about Faith, set down by the sayd Tertullian, on which a Christian by degrees mounts vnto God, or as S.

                        I belieue, I receaued from the present Church, the present from the primitiue Church, the primitiue Church from the Apostles, the Apostles from Christ, and Christ from God, God the prime verity from no other fountayne, different from his owne infallible knowledge. So that who so cleaueth not to the present Church, firmely belieuing the tradition thereof as being come downe by succession, is not so much as on the lowest step of the Ladder, that leads vnto God, the reuealer of sauing truth; successiue tradition vnwritten being the last and finall ground whereon we belieue, that the substantiall points of our beliefe Note the Iesuit doth not say Tradition is the last ground on which we belieue our Fayth to be sauing truth, or the word of God; but only, that it came frō the Apostles, so mounting vp by the Church vnto the Apostles, by the Apostles vnto God, and by him vnto all necessary truth. 
                        came from the Apostles. This I proue by these foure These arguments as they cōuince there is no meanes to know what the Apostles taught, but Christian Tradition; so they consequently conuince, that if the Christian Religion be sauing truth, God must assist this perpetual Catholike Tradition therof, that no Errors creep into it. arguments.
                     
                        The first Argument.
                        IF the mayne and substantiall points of our fayth be belieued to be Apostolicall, because writtē in the Scripture of the new

Testament, and the Scriptures of the new Testament are belieued to come from the Apostles vpon the voyce of perpetuall tradition vnwritten; then our Resolutiō that our fayth is Apostolicall, stayeth lastly and finally vpon Tradition vnwritten.
                        But so it is, that the Scriptures of the new Testamēt cannot be prooued to haue been deliuered vnto the Church by the Apostles, but by the perpetual Tradition vnwritten, conserued in the Church succeeding the Apostles. For what other proofe can be imagined except one would prooue it by the The Minister pag. 19. to Titles, addeth inscription of some Epistles, subscription, &amp; insertion of names, in the body of the bookes: but neither is this true of all books, nor of all Epistles, nor it is inough to satisfy a man. For may not a counterfayte write a Gospell for example in the name of Peter, repeating the name of Peter the Apostle, in the booke twenty tymes? So it is childish to mē
                              tion this as the last stay of persuasion. For what more childish then to prooue a thinge vnknowne by another as much vnknowne? Titles of the bookes, which were absurd, seing doubt may be made, whether those Titles were set on the Books by the Apostles themselues, of which doubt only Tradition can resolue vs. Besides, the Ghospell of S. Marke, S. Luke, as also the Acts of the Apostles were not written by any Apostles, but were by their liuely voyce, and suffrages recommended vnto Christians as Sacred▪ &amp; Diuine otherwise (as also 
                              Bilson de perpetua gubernatione Ecclesiae. pag. 85. Historiae illae à Marco &amp; Luca exaratae, Canonicam authoritatem ex Apostolorum suffragi

                              s nactae sunt, qui eas lectas approbârunt. 
                           M. Bilson noteth) they should neuer haue obtayned such eminent authority in the Church, neyther should they be now so esteemed but vpon the supposall of Apostolicall approbation. But how shall we know that the Apostles saw these writings, and recommended the same vnto Christian Churches, but by Tradition? Ergo, the last and highest ground on which we belieue what doctrine was deliuered by

the Apostles, is the tradition of the Church suceceding them.
                        For we may distinguish three properties of doctrine of faith, to wit, to be True, to be Reuealed of God, to be Preached and deliuered of the Apostles. The highest ground by which I am perswaded that my fayth is true, is the authority of God reuealing it. The highest ground on which I am resolued that my Fayth is reuealed, is the credit and authority of Christ Iesus, &amp; his Apostles, who deliuered the same as Diuine and Sacred. But the highest ground that moueth me to belieue that my fayth was The Mynister, and especially the Bishops Chaplin pag. 16. &amp; 17. charge the Answerer to resolue fayth of the Scriptures being the word of God into only Tradition. This is a slaūder: for he doth distinguish expresly in scripture the being preached by the Apostles, from the being reuealed of God or his word. This second property is spirituall, and hidden, and belieued not vpon Tradition from the Apostles directly, but vpon the word of the Apostles so affirming, confirmed with the testimony of miracles wrought by the Holy GHOST: but to be preached and planted in the world, was a publike sensible thing, &amp; so is knowne by Tradition, hand to hād from the Apostles. Thus the Church as belieuing her doctrine to be true, is built vpon God, as belieuing her doctrine to be of God is built on the Apostles, as belieuing her doctrine to be the Apostles, is built on the Tradition of Pastours succeeding them, The ground and pillar of Truth by office, as our Minister graunts pag. 9. lin. 5. preached by the Apostles, is the perpetual tradition of the Church succeding the Apostles that so teacheth me. Into this principle

                           Saint Augustine resolued his fayth agaynst the Manichees who pretended that the Scriptures of the new Testament had been corrupted, confuting them by the Tradition of the Church; affirming That he would not belieue the Ghospell, did not the Authority of the Catholike Church induce him, assigning this as the last stay of his resolution in this point. For though he belieued the Gospell to be soueraignely certaine and true, vpon the authority of God reuealing it, and that it was reuealed of God, vpon the authority of the Apostles,

who as Sacred preached it; yet that this Ghospell (as we haue it) came incorrupt from the Apostles, he could haue no stronger, or more The Minister forced by this testimony graū
                              teth two things which ouerthrow his cause: first pa. 22. l. 13.14. that Nouices and simple persons ground their fayth on the authority of the Church; as also Field graunteth, appendix. part. 1. pag. 11. now I assume. But the fayth of Nouices is sauing fayth, as S. Aug. there sayth contra Epist. Fundamenti c. 2. and cō
                              sequently their fayth is diuine. Ergo, sauing &amp; supernaturall fayth is grounded on the authority of the Church. Secondly, he graunts pag. 23. lin. 2. &amp; 3. that The Church as including the Apostles, can proue the Scripture: whence it is cōsequent that the Scriptures are not principles knowne by themselues, but haue another higher diuine principle, by which they are proued, The Church comprehending the Apostles being (as Protestāts grāt Field. l. 4. of Church c. 21.) of greater authority, then Scripture.
                            excellent proofe then the testimony of the present Church, descending by the cōtinuall succession of Bishops from the Apostles. Neyther can we imagine an higher, except we fly to particular &amp; priuate reuelation, which is absurd.
                     
                     
                        The second Argument.
                        SECONDLY I proue, that common vnlearned people (the greatest part of Christianity) are persuaded about all substantiall points of fayth by Tradition, not by Scripture. Common &amp; vnlearned people haue true Christian fayth in all points necessary and sufficient vnto saluation, but they haue not fayth of all these mayne and substantiall points grounded on Scripture; for they can neyther vnderstand nor read any Scripture, but translated into vulgar languages, &amp; so if they belieue vpon Scrpture, they belieue vpon Scripture translated into their Mother tongue; but before that they can know that the Scriptures are truly translated, euen in all substantiall points, that so they may build on it, they must first know what are the mayne and substantiall points, &amp; To this proofe that Christians belieue their Creed more firmely then any translation, the Minister hath not answered one word, nor can answere, for it is conuincing, as appeares by this syllogisme. Perswasion more certayne and firme cannot be grounded on perswasion lesse firme and certayne. Such as are true Christians belieue the articles of their Creed more firmely, then they do that Scriptures are truly translated into their vulgar tongue. Ergo, True Christians do not build their Fayth of the Creed on Scripture translated, but on doctrine knowne to be the Apostles formerly, and more firmely, then that Scripture is truly translated. firmely belieue

them, so that they would not belieue the Scriptures, translated agaynst them. For if they know them not before, how can they know, that Scriptures in places that concerne them, are truly translated? If they doe not before hand firmely belieue them, why should they be ready to allow translations that agree with them, and to reiect the translations that differ from thē? Ergo, 
                           The Minister pag. 26. sayth, That Ignorant men resolue their faith into Scripture; yet not into Scripture so distinctly knowne as they can tel the names of the seuerall Bookes, Authours and Sections, and so they resolue implicitly, not explicitly. This is idle. For if they know the doctrine of the Scripture because it is written, though they know not the name of the booke, nor number of the Chapter &amp; Verse, nor the formall text, what groūd firmer thē their Creed haue they this to belieue? originally, &amp; before they know any Scripture, they haue fayth grounded on the Traditiōs of Ancestors, by the light wherof they are able to iudge of the truth of Translations, about such substantiall points as they firmely belieue by Traditiō. And this is that which Protestants must meane (if they haue any true meaning) when they say, that the common People know Scriptures to be truly translated, by the 
                           The Minister is forced to fly to a found paradoxe confuted already, That vnlearned Rusticks know the Scripture to be Gods word by the matter and forme of the bookes, and by seing the resplendent verity of the doctrine, pag. 28. lin. 3. He addeth. lin. 7. That they which actually resolue their fayth into the doctrine of Scriptur, do virtually &amp; mediatly resolue the same into the very Scripture, though they know not that it is written in Scripture. This is friuolous and false. For the Pagan and Infidells, that know hony to be sweet, and taken in abundance to be hurtfull, should virtually resolue their persuasion into the very Scripture, because they actually belieue a thing affirmed in Scripture, Prou. 25.27. Yea the Iew belieuing that Christ was crucified, belieues a doctrine of Scripture; doth he therefore resolue and build virtually vpon Scripture? No. That one build on Scripture it is not inough to know actually some doctrine which is in Scripture, but he must know that it is in Scripture, and belieue the Scripture 
                                 •
                              o be the word of God: but ignorant persons cannot know infallibly Scriptures to be the word of God truly translated,, further then they find them conforme to the doctrine deliuered by the Tradition of the Church. Therfore they build their Fayth finally vpon Tradition, &amp; not vpon Scripture truly translated. 
                           light of the doctrine, shining in true

Translations, to wit, by the light of the doctrine receiued by Tradition of Ancestors; and thereupon so firmely belieued as they will acknowledge Scriptures to be truly translated so far, and no further then they perceyue them, consonant with the fayth deliuered vnto them; so that their last and finall resolution for substantiall points, is not into Scriptures truly translated into their vulgar tongue, but into Tradition, by the light whereof they discerne that the Translations are true more or lesse, according to the measure of knowledge they haue by Tradition.
                     
                     
                        The third Argument.
                        IF all the mayne and substantiall poynts of Christian Fayth must be knowne and firmely belieued before we can securely read and truly vnderstand the Holy Scripture, then the mayne and substātiall points

of fayth are belieued, not vpon Scripture, but vpon Traditiō precedently vnto Scripture. This is cleare, because true fayth is not built but vpon Scripture truely vnderstood: neyther can Scripture before it be truly vnderstood of a man, be to him a ground of assured persuasion. But we cannot vnderstand the Scripture securely and aright, before we know the substantiall articles of fayth, which all are bound expressely to belieue the The Minister here laboureth to proue that the rule of fayth is contained in Scripture, and therfore cannot be Tradition vnwrittē. Which discourse is impertinent and the inference false. For himselfe grants pag. 150. lin. 16. that the rule of fayth is both written Tradition and vnwritten. The Doctrine then of Traditiō is tearmed vnwritten, not because it is no waies written, but because (as the Answerer sayth) it is knowne by preaching precedently and independently of Scripture. summary comprehensiō of which poynts, is tearmed the Rule 
                              Tertul. de Praescr. c. 13.
                            of fayth. This is The Answerer here brings three Argumēts that cōuince, that none can vnderstand Scripture securely and without danger of damnable errour, that are not aforehand grounded in the substantiall articles of fayth. The Minister though he professe to haue set downe the Answere Verbatim, leaueth all this out, and then cryeth thus agaynst the Iesuite, pag. 34. circa finem. That men must be first instructed in the necessary poynts of fayth before they can securedly read and interprete Scriptures, is affirmed by the Iesuite, but not proued. Thus he. What not proued? The Iesuit bringes three large cōuictiue proofes thereof, which you because you cannot answere omit, and then cry: the Iesuit doth say, and not proue. This dealing is grosse. proued by the acknowledgement of Protestans in whose name

                           D. Feild writeth in this sort: We hold with the Papists, that neither conference of places, nor consideration of antecedentia and consequentia, nor the knowledge of tongues, and lookinge into the originalls 
                                 •
                              s of any force, vnlesse we find the things which we conceiue to be vnderstood and meant in the places interpreted, to be consonant vnto the rule of fayth.

                           For who can be able to vnderstand the Scriptures,

but he that is setled in those things which the Apostles presupposed in their deliuery of Scripture? Secondly, by the experience both of all former ages, and this present, prouing by too many examples, that such as come to reade &amp; expound Scripture without being aforehand setled by Tradition in the rule of fayth, do fall into errours most damnable against the maynest articles of the Creed, as the Creation of the world, the blessed Trinity, and the Incarnation, Baptisme, and other. So that reading &amp; interpretation of Scripture makes not men Christians, but supposeth them to be made by Tradition, at the least for substantiall poynts, such as euery one is bound expressely to know.
                        Thirdly, we are not more able to vnderstand Scripture then were our Forefathers the auncient Doctors of the Church, neither is there reason that we should so thinke of our selues; but they thought themselues vnable to interprete Scripture, precisely of it selfe by conference of places, without the light of Christiā Doctrine aforehand knowne, and firmely belieued vpon the Churches perpetuall Tradition from the Apostles: witnes

                           In our vnderstandinge of Scriptures: we must not depart from the first Ecclesiasticall Tradition, nor belieue otherwise,

but as the Church of God hath by succession deliuered to vs. Ergo, no man is able to read &amp; interprete Scripture without 
                           Protestants affirme, as Whitaker. contr. 1. q. 4. c. 2. and others, that no man can vnderstand Scripture that bringes not with him the light of fayth and Christian piety, puras &amp; sanctas mentes: which doth most euidently demonstrate that fayth about substā
                              tial poynts is grounded on Gods word precedently vnto Scripture. That persuasion which is precedent vnto the knowledg of Scripture, and is the rule guiding vs in our knowledge of Scripture, cannot be grounded vpon knowledge of Scripture. But Christian fayth &amp; piety as they grant, is precedent vnto knowledge of Scripture, yea must be brought vnto the reading thereof, and direct vs in it. Ergo fayth is not originally grounded on Scripture. 
                           the light &amp; assistance of firme Christian fayth, aforehand conceiued by the voyce of the Church deliuering what by Tradition from Auncestors she receiued. Whence I also conclude, that it is exceeding dangerous boldnes in men of this age, so to presume on their interpretations of Scriptures gotten by diligent reading and conferring of places, as they care not though a

                        The fourth Argument.
                        THOSE that vnderstand the Scriptures aright, must be such as they were to whom the Apostles writ and deliuered the Scriptures, and whose instruction they intended by their writing, but the Apostles (as D. 
                           
                              Lib. 4. of the Church c. 4. in the margent.
                            
                           Feild acknowledgeth) wrote to them they had formerly taught more at large, that were instructed and grounded in all substantiall and necessary poynts of fayth, that knew the cōmon necessary obseruations of Christianity: Ergo, they that reade and presume to interprete the Scriptures, without first knowing and firmely belieuing by tradition, at the least all necessary and substantiall poynts of fayth, The Minister pag. 34. lin. 34. chargeth the Iesuite to say that men not belieuing forehand all necessary points of fayth cannot haue any certaine vnderstanding of Scripture. This is a slaūder. He onely sayth that such ignorants, and wanters of beliefe cannot vnderstand aright Scriptures in all necessary points, but they will erre in some chiefe article or other, though they may happily vnderstand something aright. For there was neuer Heretike that did erre in all necessary points. But it is inough to damnation to erre in one substantiall pointe, &amp; therefore we must not presume to reade &amp; interpret Scriptures, till we be well grounded in them by the Tradition of the Church. cānot with assurance vnderstand them,

but may euen in maynest poynts mightely mistake: for the blessed Apostles wryting to Christians, that were beforehand fully taught and setled in substantiall Christian Doctrines and customes, doe ordinarily in their writings suppose such things as abū
                           dantly knowen, without declaring them anew, onely touching them Thus S. Peter act. 9.3. &amp; 4. reprehēding Ananias for the breach of his Vow, doth by the way teach the holy Ghosts Diuinity, Why hath Satan filled thy hart to lye to the holy Ghost? Thou hast not lyed vnto men, but vnto God. For what is spoken directly and of purpose in Scripture, is no more infallible truth then what is spokē but cursorily &amp; by the way. Wherfor the former speach of S. Peter doth assure vs, that the holy Ghost is God, as much as that it is a sinne to breake a vow; and yet that is spoken by the way, and this of purpose. Whence you may see the Ministers great weakenes of Iudgemēt who holding that some points of fayth are cōtained in Scripture only consequently, pag. 32. lin. 3. raileth at the Iesuite, for saying that some thinges are sayd in Scripture cursorily and by the way. For to be written cursorily and by the way which the Iesuite giues vnto Scripture, is more then to be onely virtually, and consequently written. cursorily by the way, and therfore obscurely, so that they who are already taught might well vnderstand their sayings, and no other.
                     
                  
                  
                     Concerning the sufficiency, and clarity of Scripture. §. 2.
                     
                     HENCE I may further inferre, that Protestants haue not yet throughly pondered the place of the Apostles to Timothy which they so vehemently vrge to proue the all-sufficiency of sole Scripture for euery man, as though the Apostles had

sayd absolutely that the Scriptures are able to instructe, or make any man wise vnto saluation: which he sayes not, but speaking particularly 2. Tim. 3.14.15.16.17. vnto Timothy sayth, They are able to instructe, or make Thee wise vnto saluation; Thee, 
                        The Minister here laboureth impertinenly to proue that speaches vnto one single person may be generall vnto many other in Scripture, which no man denies. And so this speach They are able to make Thee wise, is generall vnto all persons that are like to Timothy, that is, instructed aforehand and setled in the fayth of Tradition. For what is sayd vnto one single person is not sayd vnto others, further thē they agree with that party in the cause, for which it is truly sayd of him. What God sayd vnto Abraham Gen. 15.12. I am thy Protectour, is not sayd to all men, but only to all mē that were like Abraham, that is, deuout worshipers of the true God, as he was. that hast bene aforehand instructed by word of mouth, &amp; doest thervpon firmely belieue all substantiall doctrines, and knowest all the necessary practises of the Christian discipline. Verily the Apostle in that place speaketh onely of the Scriptures of the Old Testament, affirming them not sufficient for euery man, but for Timothy; and not sufficient for him by themselues alone, but per fidem quae est in Christo Iesu, that is ioyned with the doctrine of the Christian fayth, which Tymothy had heard, and belieued vpon the liuely voyce of Tradition.
                     And the consequent words of the Apostle so much insisted vpon, All Scripture inspired of God is profitable to teach &amp;c. If Protestants could so 
                           The Minister heere heapeth many speaches of Fathers, that say the Scriptures are sufficient, to proue that Profitable signifyes the same that Sufficient. This is ridiculous. The Iesuit grants the Scripture to be sufficient for them that know Tradition, yet he will still deny that profitable signifyes the same as sufficient.
                           
                           
                              
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       How Catholicks grant the same sufficiency to be in Scripture as Protestants, and the true state of the Question about sufficiency of Scripture, and of Tradition.
                                       THE Minister here enters into a longe impertinent discourse about the clarity &amp; sufficiency of Scripture, setting titles ouer the heads of his pages, Many Scriptures playne; the Scriptures sufficient &amp;c. as who would say, the Answerer had denied this. To discouer these his false insinuatiōs, and to cleere this controuersy most important, we must know 5. things. First that there was once a controuersy betwixt Protestants, and vs about the sufficiēcy &amp; clarity of Scripture. For in their beginning they taught all matter of fayth to be EXPRESSED in Scripture, and nothing inuolued: Omnia expressa nihil inuolutum; De tota Scriptura dico nullam eius partem obscuram esse. So Luther de 
                                                •
                                             er
                                                •
                                             to Arbitrio. in Tom. 2. Wittenberg. Nothing is to be belieued without the word of God, though it seeme deduced by good consequence. Luther in locis cōmun. 1. part. c. 24. pag. 69. Secondly, now Protestants (euen our Minister pag. 32 lin. 2. and often in this reply) disclaime from expresse and formall Scripture, and pretend that all things are written eyther formally or virtually, and so confesse, that there is herin no difference betwixt the most learned Papists and them. So saith Field Church. l. 4. c. 20. pag. 241. lin. 6. Thirdly, when some Catholicks, as Dominicus Bannes, so many tymes cited by the Minister. pag 151. Marg lit. f. pag 109. lin. 40. pag. 189. marg. lit. b. pag. 580. marg lit. a. say, that some points be neither expressely nor inuoluedly in Scripture, they do not meane that they are not virtually inuolued in thinges contayned in Scripture as effects in their cause, &amp; so are deduceable from Scripture; but only that they are not formally inuolued in thinges of Scripture as parts in their whole, in sort as they can be articles of fayth by sole Scripture. For thinges formally inuolued in Scripture as parts in the whole, a soule and body in man, indiuidualls in the whole masse of their kind be articles of fayth by vertue of Scripture. Thus when the Scripture 
                                             •
                                          aith Iob was a man, it is said inuoluedly, yet formally, that he had soule &amp; body &amp;c. when the Scripture sayth Libanus hath Cedar trees, it sayth not formally but virtually, it hath imputrible wood. Fourthly, the question now resting between Protestants and vs, is not whether the Scripture be virtually intricate and inuolued about some points of fayth, nor whether some rule of interpretatiō be necessary; for that the Scripture is inuolued and needeth an vnfolding rule is granted on both sides: The only question is, by what rule these Doctrines inuolued are vnfolded and made knowne vnto vs as articles of fayth. Protestāts say by Scripture and the rules  of Logicke and Reason, [Wotton Triall of the Romish &amp;c. pag 88. lin. 29.] and by other things besides Scripture euident in the light of nature, [Feild pag 281. lin. 20.] Catholikes hold that the rule to expound Scripture, binding all men to belieue deductions as matters of fayth, is not Logicke, but the Tradition and definition of the Church.
                                       And this Catholicke doctrin is proued. First, because the rule of faith must be for the capacity of vnlearned men aswell as of learned▪ But men vnlearned cannot be sure of the virtualityes of Scripture by the rules of Logicke, or Logicall deduction; for they cannot vnderstand when an argument is good by the rules of Logicke. Secondly, the Scripture it selfe to supply her wants sendeth vs not to the rules of Logicke, but vnto traditions, saying 2. Thessal. 2.15. Hold fast the Traditions ye haue receaued by word or our epistle. They send men to the Church, as to the pillar and ground of truth. 1. Tim. 3.15. which whosoeuer doth not heare, is as a hea

                                             hen and a publican. Matth. 13.5.7. Therfore by the rule of Church-Tradition &amp; not by the rules of Logicke do we learne authētically the confessed virtualities, obscurities, and inuolutions of Scripture about matters of fayth. Thirdly the Fathers about matters inuolued in Scripture, send men not vnto Logicke, but vnto Tradition, auouching the same to be a rule as certaine &amp; no lesse estimable then Scripture. S. Chrysostome homil. 4 in 2. ad Thessal. The Apostles did not deliuer all things in Scripture, but some things without writing, and these are as much to be credited as the written: It is a Tradition, this is inough, seeke no more. The same is taught by S. Dionysius Eccles. Hierar. c. 1. Iren. l. 2. c. 2.3. &amp; 4. Eusebius lib. 1. de demonst. Euang. c. 8. by S. Basill de Spirit. sanct. c. 27. Epiphan. haeres. 55. &amp; 61. Aug. de Baptis li. 2. c. 7. &amp; lib. 5. c. 23. and the rest.
                                       Finally, we dislike the Protestant manner of controlling the Church by Scripture. For on the one side they contradict the vniuersall custome and Tradition of the Church at the least, and as they grant, of many ages, saying, The Popish doctrine during the space of nine hundred yeares hath spread it selfe ouer the whole world, so that an vniuersall Apostacy was ouer the whole face of the earth for many hundred yeares. [Perkins Exposit. of the Creed. pag. 307. &amp; 400.] On the other side their Arguments out of Scripture are at the most but probable, and they sometimes challenge no more: homini non prorsus alienato probabilior apparet. [Whitak contr. 1. q. 5. c 8. circa finem] Others alledge Scripture not with as probable colour as we doe. [Iohn White defence pag. 321.] Yea this Minister in his Reply doth acknowledge pag. 581. That by Sophistry we giue vnto their Scripturall arguments seeming and appearing solutions. Now we Catholikes thinke it to be Hereticall, &amp; as S. Augustine sayth, insolent madnes, 
                                           vpon probabilities, vpon Arguments frō Scripture that receaue seeming solutions, to contradict the Christian vniuersall Tradition of many hundred yeares: For what the Minister saith, this to be done by Sophistry, is ridiculous. For if to giue seeming plausible, and probable solutions vnto Scripturall arguments, against the full Tradition of Christianity be Sophistry, what is true Theology? On the other side, if for men to stand against the Tradition of so many whole Christian ages vpon arguments they confesse to be probably, and seemingly answered, be Christianity, what is hereticall Obstinacy?
                                       Fifthly, whereas you obiect that pag. 199. lin. 6. the Fathers disputed from Scripture negatiuely agaynst Heretikes, in this sort; Doctrine is not cleerly deliuered in Scripture, therefore it is not to be receaued as Fayth; You must know, that the Fathers proceed vpon a supposition that was knowne vnto all, and granted by the Heretickes themselues, to wit, that the doctrins they disputed agaynst, were not the full and publicke Tradition of the Catholike Church. For seing Scripture (as we haue shewed) doth necessarily suppose Tradition that we may know the true text and sense thereof; so likewise the Fathers when they vrge that all doctrine is to be reiected which is not in Scripture, still suppose that that doctrine is not the publicke Tradition of the Church. Where we must also note, that the Fathers did not only require of Heretikes proofe from Scripture, by way of deduction &amp; Logicall inference (for such all heretiks did pretend and herewith deluded seely sots, as now Protestants doe) but they required of Heretikes to shew their doctrine in Scripture, ipsis dictionibus, sayth Irenaeus. l. 2. c. 36. expressely and in tearmes, and proue it, not by texts (sayth S. Augustine de vnitat. Eccles. c. 3.) which require sharpenes of wit in the auditors to iudge who doth more probably interprete them, not by places, quae vel interpretem quaerunt, which require an interpreter, and an arguer making Logicall inferences vpon the text so concluding for his purpose; but by places playne, manifest, cleere, which leaue no place to contrary exposition, and that no Sophystry can wrest them to other sense, to the end that Controuersyes which concerne the Saluation of soules, be defined by Gods formall word, and not by deductions from it according to Logicall forme. For sayth S. Augustine, what more vniust, then Ingeniorum contentionibus causam populorum committere?
                                       
                                       Hence the Fathers negatiue argument from Scripture, ouerthroweth Protestant Religion, for thus I argue. Nothing is matter of Fayth and of necessity, which is not formally and expressely reuealed by the word  of God eyther written or vnwritten, deliuered by full Ecclesiasticall Tradition. But no Heretikes euer did nor our Protestants now do, or can pretend perpetuall publicke Tradition vnwritten for their doctrins, agaynst the Catholicke and Roman Church: nor can they proue their Tenets (ipsis dictionibus ex scriptura) by Scripture, auerring them in expresse tearmes. Only they clayme texts which as themselues confesse receaue seeming &amp; appearing solutiōs, agaynst which they haue nothing to say, but that this is done by Sophistry, so bringing the busines of the Saluation of the world to be decided by contentiō of wit. Therefore their doctrins are to be reiected as vnchristiā. Finally it is great vanity in you to thinke that the Traditions vnwritten mentioned by Fathers, are conforme to your Doctrine, writing as you doe pag. 46. By Tradition the Fathers vnderstand not the Fabulous dreames and inuentions of Papals, who like Pharisees corrupt the right sense of Scripture by their vnwritten Tradition, and affirme those thinges to be Apostolicall which agree with the confessed doctrine of the Apostles like darkenesse with light. Thus you, with much bitternesse, and no lesse falshood. For what Gerson [de signis ruinae Eccles. sig. 5.] sayth of the heresyes of his age, to wit of Waldo, Wickliffe and Husse, Fabulae sunt, they are Fables, you turne as by him spoken of perpetuall Traditions of the Catholicke and Roman Church. The Pharisees did indeed corrupt Scripture. But how? By Logicall deductions out of the same, according to your Protestant, and the common Hereticall fashion, pretending greater skill then all their Ancestors. That they did affirme that their speciall obseruations were Traditions vnwritten from Moyses, the Scripture hath not a word; yea the thing they most of all obiected agaynst our Sauiour, was the written Tradition of Moyses about keeping the Sabboth Day. [Ioan. 7.] From which precept not by Tradition vnwritten, but by Logicall inference, they concluded that our Lord brake the Sabboth-Day by healing diseased persons thereon. So that Pharasaicall Traditions were neuer so much as pretended to be doctrines vnwritten as you imagine, but to be doctrines concluded from the text of Scripture, by the rules of Reason and Logicke, iust according to your Protestant pretence.
                                       Also, what you say, that the Fathers Traditions vnwritten be not our doctrines but yours, is spoken because you would haue men so thinke though they erre, not because you can thinke the same to be so in truth. For thus I argue agaynst this your seely Shift. The Fathers, as appeareth by their wordes, vnderstand by Tradition Apostolical vnwritten, Dogmata quae peti non possunt è Sacra Scriptura, Doctrines of fayth that cannot be  gathered frō the holy Scriptures with such certitude as they may therevpon be belieued as articles of fayth. But you pretend and glory, that all your Doctrines of Fayth be ex sacris Scripturis petitae, so drawne and gathered from holy Scriptures, as they are belieued as Fayth only vpon this rule. Ergo, it is great vanity for you to say that the Fathers by Apostolical Tradition vnwritten, vnderstood the Doctrine not of the Roman Church, but of your Protestant Separation.
                                       And if from generality (vpon which Ministers, whose drift is to deceyue, do willingly dwell) we descend to particulars, we shall find that you reiect those Doctrines &amp; customes of the Roman Church as Fabulous dreames, and human inuentions, which the Fathers expressely, and in tearmes affirme to be Apostolicall Traditions. To pray for the reliefe of the Soules of the faythfull deceased Protestants esteeme fabulous: the

                                           Fathers say ex Apostolica traditione seruantur, they are receyued by Apostolical Tradition. To fast one fryday, or the sixt Day of the weeke in memory of our Sauiours passion Protestants condemne as superstitious: yet

                         metamorphize the word Profitable, as to make it signify the same with the word Sufficient, which is very hard; yet were the text much ouershort to proue their intent, that Scripture

alone is sufficient for euery man, seing the Apostle speakes not of euery man, but expressely of him, who is Homo Dei, the man

of God, that is, one already fully instructed, and firmely setled by Tradition in all the mayne poynts of Christian fayth and godly life, such an one as Timothy was. The Scriptures for men in this manner aforetaught and grounded in fayth, are abundantly sufficient, who will deny it? But this proueth at the most the sufficiency of the Scripture, ioyned with Tradition, not of Scripture alone, or of onely-onely-onely Scripture, as Protestants bookes in great Letters, very earnestly affirme. Hence also we may conclude, that the The Minister to proue Scriptures are cleere vnto Infidels that haue not the Spirit of fayth, heapes many testimonies of Fathers, that teach Scriptures in some matters to be cleere. Who denyes this? they are so to the faythful not vnto Infidels, not vnto them that are vnsetled in the Catholike fayth; yea many places he brings, speake expressely only of the faythfull &amp; pious, Sicut vera Religio docet accedunt, as S. Augustine &amp; others by him alleadged affirme, and therefore are brought impertinently to proue the sufficiency &amp; clarity of Scriptures in respect of Infidels, pag. 34.35.36. many allegatiōs of Fathers, which Protestants bring to proue the Scripture to be cleere in all substātiall points, are impertinent, because the fathers speake of mē aforehand instructed in all substantiall poynts, who may by the light of Tradition easily discouer them in Scripture; as they that heare Aristotle explicate himselfe by word of mouth may vnderstand his booke of nature, most difficill to be vnderstood of thē that neuer heard his explicatiō, either out of his owne mouth, or by Tradition of his Schollers.
                     I hope I haue in the opinion of your most learned Maiesty, sufficiently demonstrated this first GROVND of Catholicke fayth, to wit, That a Christian is originally and fundamentally builte vpon the word of God, not as written in Scriptures, but as deliuered by Tradition of the Church, successiuely from the Primitiue,

vpō the authority wherof we belieue, that both Scriptures, and all other substantiall articles of fayth, were deliuered by the Apostles, thence further ascending, &amp; inferring they came from Christ, and so from God the prime veracity &amp; author of truth.
                  
               
               
                  THE SECOND GROVND.
                  
                     That there is a visible Church alwaies in the world, to whose Traditions men are to cleaue. That this Church is One, Vniuersall, Apostolicall, Holy. §. 3.
                     
                     THIS principle is consequent vpon the former, out of which six things may be clerly proued. First, that there is alwaies a true The Minister still cō
                           eth forth with his distinctiō that by Church we may vnderstand a Hierarchy of mitred prelates; &amp; thē he denyes that there is still a church teaching the truth in the world. Secondly, for a number of belieuers smaller or greater, teaching and professing the right sayth in all substantial points; &amp; then he grants there is still a true Church of Christ in the world. This distinction so much repeated, specially pag. 57. and 58. is impertinēt: for by Church we vnderstād not euery small number of right belieuers, but a Christian multitude of such credit and authority, as vpon her tradition we may be sure what Scriptures &amp; doctrines were the Apostles. For this is a fundamentall pointe necessary to be knowne, that so we may know, what Doctrine is of God, and it cannot be knowne but by Tradition of the Church, as hath bene proued. Now whether this Church be Mitred, or not Mitred, goe in Blacke, or in White, or in Scarlet, doth little import. Let the Minister but shew vs a Church that hath euident Tradition of Doctrine hand to hand frō the Apostles, &amp; we will say she is the true Church, though she haue no Surplisse, or Miter, but be as precise as Geneua it selfe: but if there be no Church in the world, but this Hierarchy of Mitred Prelates, whose Tradition hand to hand can assure men which be the Scriptures and doctrines of Religiō deliuered by the Apostles, men ought not to beare such spleen against a Miter, or Corner-Cap, or Surplisse, as in respect of them to fly from the Church, that onely hath Catholicke Tradition from the Apostles. Church of Christ in the world, for if there be no meanes for men to know that Scriptures, and all other substantiall Articles came from Christ and his Apostles, and so consequently from God, but the Tradition of the Church; then there must needes be in all ages a Church, receiuing and deliuering these Traditions, els men in some age since Christ, should haue

bene destitute of the The Minister pa. 59. lin. 15. sayth, A corrupt Church may deliuer vncorruptly some part of sacred truth, as the Scripture and Creed, by which men may be saued. Answer. We may conceaue two wayes of deliuering an incorrupt text. The one Casuall &amp; by chance, and so a corrupt Church, yea a Iew, an Infidell, a child may deliuer an vncorrupt Copy of the Bible. The other Authentike, assuring the receauer this to be the incorrupt text of the Apostles Scripture, and binding him so to belieue. This Authentik and irrefragable Tradition cannot be made by a false Church, erring in her Traditiōs, as is cleer. Now it is necessary to saluation, that men not only Casually haue the true Scripture, but must be sure that the text therof be incorrupt. Therfore ther must be stil a Church in the world, whose Tradition is Authentike, that is, a sufficient warrant vpon which men must belieue Doctrines to come from the Apostles. ordinary meanes of saluation, because they had not meanes to know assuredly the substantiall Articles of Christianity, without assured Fayth wherof no man is saued.
                     Secondly, this Church must be alwaies The Minister pag. 61. lin. 15 &amp; lin. 26. obiects, that in time of persecution the true Church may be reputed an impious sect by the multitude, and so not be knowne by the notion of True and Holy; nor can her truth be discerned by sense and common reason. I answere. As there are foure properties of Church-doctrin, so likewise there are foure notions of the Church. The first is to be Mistresse of the sauing truth. According to this notion the Church is inuisible to the naturall vnderstanding both of men and Angels. For God only &amp; his Blessed see our Religion to be the truth. The second is to be Mistresse of Doctrine truly reuealed by secret inspiration. According to this notion (ordinarily speaking) the Church is inuisible to almost all men that are, or euer were, the Apostles onely and the Prophets excepted. The third, to be Mistresse of Doctrine which Christ and his Apostles by their Miraculous preaching planted in the world. According to this notion the Church was visible to the first and Primitiue world, but now is not. The fourth to be Mistresse of Catholike doctrine, that is, of doctrine deliuered and receaued by full Tradition and profession, all the aduersaryes therof being vnder the name of Christian, deuided amongst themselues, and notorious changers. According to this notion the Church is euer visible &amp; sensible to all men, euen vnto her very enemies. For not only Iewes and Infidels, but euen Heretickes know in their conscience, and sometimes acknowledge in words, that the Church is truly Catholike. So long as the Church according to this notion of Catholicke is in the sight of the world, the world hath sufficient meanes of saluation. They that see with their eyes which Religion is Catholicke, may easily find out the truth. For it is cleer to common reason that the Catholike Doctrine is the Apostles, cleere by common discourse that the Apostles miraculous preaching was of God, and that God being the prime verity, his doctrine ought to be receaued as the truth of saluation. On the other side if the Church according to the notion of Catholike, be hidden, and the light therof lost, there is no ordinary meanes left for men to know what the Apostles taught, nor consequently what God by inspiration reuealed vnto them. We must begin againe anew from a second fountaine of immediat reuelation from God, and build vpon the new planting of Religion with miracles in the world by some recent Prophet. And if this be absurd, then there must euer be in the world a Church, whose Tradition is illustriously Catholicke, and consequently shewing it selfe to be the Apostles, vnto all men that will not be obstinate. visible and conspicuous. For the Traditiōs of the Church must euer be famous, glorious, and most notoriously knowne in the world, that a Christian may truly say with S. Augustine de vtilit. cred. c. 17. I belieue nothing but the consent of Nations, and countries, and most celebrious fame. Now if the Church were hidden, secret, inuisible in any age, then her Traditions could not be Doctrines euer illustriously knowne, but rather obscure, hidden, Apocriphall. Ergo, the Church the mistresse, pillar and foundation of truth must be alwaies visible and conspicuous, which (if need be) may be further proued most euidently.
                     
                        Thirdly, that this Church, is Apostolicall, and that apparently descending from the

Apostolicall Sea, by succession of Bishops The Church that hath a lineall succession of Bishops from the Apostles, famous and illustrious, whereof not one hath beene opposite in religion to his immediate predecessour, proues euidently that this Church hath the doctrin of the Apostles▪ for as in the ranke of 300. stones ranged in order, if no two stones be found in that line of different colour, then if the first be white, the second is white, so the rest vnto the last: euen so if there be a succession of 300. Bishops all of the same Religion, if the first haue the Religion of the Apostles, and of Peter, the second likewise hath the same, and so the rest, euen vntill the last. 
                        vsque ad Confessionem generis humani, euen to the acknowledgment of humane kind, as S. Augustine l. de vtil. Cred. cap. 17. speaketh: for how could the Tradition of Christian Doctrine be eminently and notoriously Apostolicall, if the Church deliuering the same, hath not a The Minister sayth p. 67. circa finem, That this note of succession makes nothing against the Church of England, because their Pastors and Bishops are able to exhibite a pedigree, or deriuation both of their ministery and doctrine, from the Apostles. This is ridiculous. For if they can really exhibite such a pedigree and deriuation of their fayth in all ages from Christ to Luther, why do they still keepe vs in suspence, and neuer exhibite the same, which we so earnestly beg at their hands? Let them but name the Church, or Pastour that did commit vnto Luther the Ministery of preaching his doctrines against the Roman religion? The Roman Church made him priest, &amp; gaue him cō
                           mission to preach her doctrine; but to preach agaynst her Religion who gaue him order? That commission to preach seeing he had it not frō any Church as is manifest, he had it eyther from himselfe, coyning a religion of his owne head out of Scripture vnderstood in his owne manner, or from Satan with whome he conferred, and vnto whose arguments he yielded, as himselfe doth witnes Tom. 7. Wittenberg. fol. 228. or els immediatly from God, and then he ought to haue made this immediate reuelation knowne by miracles. Let not Ministers therfore idly say, we can exhibite a pedigree, feeding vs with wordes; but affoard vs present payment of so long an exacted debt. If they know the pedegree of their faith the labour is not great to write the names of their Ancestours in euery age. That done they may rest. For if we cannot demonstrate that these their pretended Ancestours were eyther Catholike Romans, or else opposite one to another in substantiall points, and this by as authentike records as they do to prooue they held some points of their Religion, the victory shallbe theirs. Is it possible they should thus delude men by saying, we can exhibite, and yet neuer do it? manifest and conspicuous pedigree, or deriuation from the Apostles? Which is a conuincing argument vsed by the same S. Augustine Epist. 48. circa medium. How can we thinke that we haue receiued manifestly Christ, if we haue not also receiued manifestly his Church? It is a principle of Philosophy, Propter quod vnum quodque tale &amp; illud magis, but the name of Christ, his glory, his vertues, his miracles are to the world famously knowne frō age to age by reason of the Church, &amp; her preaching, who in her first Pastors saw him with their eies. Ergo, this Church must needes be more famous, more illustrious, as able to giue fame, euen vnto the being, and doctrine, and actions of Christ.
                     Fourthly, this Church is One, that is,

                        
                           〈1 page duplicate〉

all the Pastors The Minister. pag. 108. lin. 14. alleadgeth the differences amongst Schoolemē, particularly betwixt Dominicās &amp; Iesuits, about the manner of explicating the efficacy of Grace, as an argument, that the Roman Church wants vnity of faith as much as Protestants. I answer, this is Idle, these differences not being in matters of faith. If Scholmen should preach different doctrines, as matters of fayth condemning ech other as Heretikes, and the Church, this notwithstanding, should alow of both sides as her children, then there should be in the Church disunion in fayth. But the Roman Church doth not allow such dissonant Preachers, only she permitteth them to differ in matters they teach, as greater probability, and priuate opinion. If any preach their priuate probabilityes as Doctrines, and as matters of fayth, condemning others as heretikes, except they recall their censure, the Roman Church shutteth them out of her communion, not permitting disunion in faith. For such permittāce would vtterly discredit the authority of her preaching, &amp; shew that euen in matters of faith she is a Church to be belieued no further thē seene. and Preachers therof deliuer, and consequently all her professors and children belieue one &amp; the same fayth. For if the Preachers and Pastors of the Church disagree about maters which they preach as necessary poynts of Fayth, how can their Tradition and Testimony be of credit therin, or haue any authority to perswade? Who will, or can firmely belieue disagreeing witnesses vpon their wordes? And this By this Note, Protestants are conuinced not to be the true Church, for the Protestant Church allowes, that dissonant doctrines be preached as her doctrine, as the word of God, as the truth of saluation; she permitteth that her preachers condemne ech other as heretikes without disclayming from the communion of eyther side. For she imbraceth in her communion both Lutherans who preach as an article of faith, the carnall manducation of Christs true body by the wicked, [Luther tom. 3. Germ. fol. 264.] and Caluinists who detest this carnall manducation as blasphemous and impious. [Caluin. admonit. 3. ad Westphalum.] But it is euident that the Church that allowes of dissonant preaching in matters of fayth, cannot be the true Church. For how can she be the one true Church which allowes that doctrine, she knowes to be false, be preached as her Religion &amp; the truth of faith? The Protestant Church knoweth, that of contrary doctrines the one side must needs be false. Therefore consenting that both sides be preached as her fayth, &amp; as sauing truth, she yields that doctrine knownely false, be preached as her doctrine and sauing truth, and so is Mistresse of falshood, as much as of truth. consent must be conspicuous and euident. For if in outward apparence and shew, preachers dissent one from another

in mayne &amp; materiall doctrines, their authority is crazed, and their testimony of no esteeme; howsoeuer perchāce their dissentions may be by some distinctions so coloured that one cannot One cānot conuince an obstinate gaynsayer &amp; wrester of words, but still he wil wrangle, yet may he be conuinced that he doth falsify and wronge authors in his interpretations, and this euidently in the iudgement of euery indifferent Reader. conuince him, that would boldly vndertake to defend, as 
                           D. Field lib. 3. of the Church cap. 42▪
                         
                        Doctour Field vndertakes for Protestants, that their dissensions be but verball. But what is this to the purpose? Do the accused dissentioners allow this Doctors reconciliation?

do they giue ouer contention thereupon? No, but professe that such reconcilers misse of their meaning, &amp; that they disagree substantially about the very Prime articles of faith. How can these men be witnesses of credit, for substantiall articles cōcerning which there is open confessed &amp; professed dissention amongst them?
                     Fiftly, I inferre, that this Church is vniuersal, spread ouer all nations, that she may be sayd to be euery where 
                           Morally, that is, according vnto common humane reputation, by which a thing diffused ouer a great part of the world &amp; famously knowne, is said, to be euery where. In this mā
                           ner the Apostle said that the fayth of the Romās was renowned in the whole world, Rom. 1.12. In this sort the Church is still vniuersall and euery where. By this is answered all the Minister brings vpō mistaking of morally.
                         
                        morally speaking, being so diffused, that the whole knowne world may take notice of her, as of a worthy and credible witnes of Christian Tradition, howsoeuer her outward glory and splendour, peace, and tranquillity be sometymes obscured in some places more or lesse, and not euer in all places at once. A truth so cleere, that it may be euidently proued out of The text Apocalyps 20.8. sayth, They (the Purseuāts of Antichrist) went vpon the breadth of the earth, and compassed about the campe of Saints &amp; beloued Citty: which place proues cleerly, that the Church and campe of God shall be spread ouer the whole bredth of the earth in the dayes of Antichrist. This verse the Minister mistaketh of purpose, and in lieu thereof citeth the seauenth, and very absurdly sayth, that Antichrist shall persecute Christians, that is, put them in prison &amp; kill them where they were not. And Protestants themselues affirme, that euen all the dayes of Antichrist the Church shall be right famous &amp; continew dispersed ouer the world. Bullinger. in Apocal. 20. Fulke against the Rhem. in Thess. 2. sect. 5. Whitaker answer to M. Reynols preface. p 34.37. Scripture, Apoc. 20. v. 8. that euen in Antichrists dayes the Church shall be visibly vniuersall. For she shall thē be euery where persecuted, which could not be, except she were euery where visible &amp; conspicuous, euen to the wicked. The reason of this perpetuall visible Vniuersality is, because the Tradition of the Church is, as I haue proued, the sole ordinary meanes, on which we ground fayth

for substantiall points. Wherfore this Tradition must be so deliuered as it may be knowne to all men, seeing God The Minister sayth p. 78. l. 22. That God will haue all men saued, according to his antecedent will, citing Schoolmē that say that Gods antecedent will is only a velleity, a wish, a complacence; thence cōcluding that though God haue antecedent wil that all be saued, yet this doth not inferre that he alwais prouides sufficient meanes for the saluation of all. I answer. That God by his antecedent will of mans saluation wisheth two things. First the saluation of all men: Secondly the meanes of their saluation. In respect of the meanes the will of God is absolute, that all men in some sort or other haue sufficient meanes of saluation. In respect of the end, to wit, the saluation of all men, the will of God is not absolute, but as Schoolmen say, virtually conditional, that is, God hath a will that al men be saued as much as lyeth in him, if the course of his prouidence be not stopped, and men will cooperate with his grace. Whence I thus argue. If God did not prouide sufficient meanes for all men, it could not be sayd, that on his part he wisheth the saluation of all. But euen our Minister pag. 78. lin. 38. grants that God wisheth the saluation of all men, and of euery indiuiduall person. Therefore God still makes his Church visibly vniuersal, vt neminem lateat, as saith S. Augustine, that no man perish through the hiddennes, and inuisibility thereof. will haue all men without exception of any nation to be saued, &amp; come to the knowledge of the truth, 1. Tim. 2.4. But if the Church were not still so diffused in the world that all knowne The Answerer wryting to his Maiesty &amp; knowing the Prouerbe sapienti verbū, did intēd by this word to insinuate how God prouided means of saluation for the world, wherof one part was many ages vnknowne. The solution of this difficulty much vrged by the Minister pag. 78 consisteth in these points: first God our Sauiour being borne and dying in this knowne world, prouided that his Church should be still visibly spread ouer the same &amp; famously known. Secondly, Nations be not so vnknown, but by nauigation and other such naturall meanes they may be discoueuered vnto this world where our Sauiour was borne, and his Church is euer visible. Thirdly, he still prouideth as Experience sheweth, that in the firmer members of this his visible Church, such zeale &amp; charity is found that natiōs can no sooner be discouered, but presently some preachers passe thither with the sound of his Ghospell. Fourthly, hence the cause why some nations heare not of the Ghospell, is not any defect in his Church, but the want of working in the naturall causes to discouer such Countreys, which defect God will not euer miraculously supply. Fiftly, if the Church were inuisible to the world, keeping her Religion to her selfe, not daring to professe or preach the same vnto others, Nations might be discouered, &amp; yet not a whit the neerer in respect of knowing the Ghospel. Hence I thus argue. If the Church were hidden for many ages, as Protestants acknowledge theirs was, men should perish, not through defect in the natural causes, but only through the hiddēnes, obscurity &amp; wretchednes of the supernatural meanes, to wit, of the Church not daring to make profession of her Religion to the world. But this is impossible, for then God should not for his part wish the saluation of all men. Therfore it is impossible that the true Church should not be euer vniuersall and notoriously knowne, &amp; consequētly it is impossible, that the Protestant should be the true Church. nations may take notice of her, all men could not be saued. Sixtly this Church is Holy both in Life &amp; Doctrine. Holy for life, shining in all excellent, and

wonderfull Sanctity to be a signe of the true Church must be on the one side diuine and excellent, &amp; on the other externall &amp; manifest vnto sense; were it not euident vnto sense, it could not be a signe; were it not diuine, it could not be a signe of a Christian Church, sanctifyed frō the rest of the world. Hence appeareth the idlenes of the Minister who pag. 81. reiecting externall extraordinary sanctity, makes inward sanctity a signe of the Church, and so he proueth his Church to be Holy, because forsooth she is cleansed by the bloud of the lambe &amp;c. This is idle. For how can this inward Sanctity, caused by the bloud of the Lambe and inhabitation of the spirit, be a signe of the Church, except it be made knowne by outward excellent works? Hence our Sauior saith of this signe of sanctity Matth. 7.16. By their fruites you shall know thē: and let your light shine before men, that they may see your works. Matth. 5.16. See S. Augustine de vtilit. Credendi lib. 17. and his booke de moribus Ecclesiae Catholicae.
                         sanctity, such as the Apostles gaue example of, as Pouerty, 
                           The Minister pag. 82. lin. 35. sayth, that vowed Chastity makes most of our Church more impure then doggs, before God and mē. I answer, this is blasphemy. For the breach of vowed Chastity, not the vowing therof maketh men impure before God. Otherwise who should be more loathsome in his sight thē his immaculate mother who vowed Chastity? as the Fathers proue by the Ghospell. Luc. 1.34.
                           This blasphemy is the same in effect with that of Turkes, who say, that the Christian band of chastity to one immaculate bed, forbiding multitude of wiues, makes Christians more impure then doggs. Which they proue, because now many thousands of Christians fall into Adultery, Incest, and other impurity, which would not haue been had Christ permitted, as Mahomet did, the holy Liberty of many wiues which the ancient Prophets inioyed.
                           To this Hereticall Turkish accusation of the Catholike Christian Church, I answere: It was conuenient that Christ Iesus being the Sonne of God should exact of his followers such sanctity, and chastity as might suite with the perfection of so diuine a Lawmaker. And though he knew many thousands would therein be defectiue, for whome therefore in his mercy he prouided the remedy of Pennance; yet this fayling of some, being but an effect of human frailty, he thought it more tolerable, then that he should allow by his Law such liberty of lust, as was vndecent for his sanctity to permit, and vnworthy of a people redeemed with his bloud, whereby there would haue beene fewer sinners among Christians, not through strictnes of life, but through the loosenes of his law.
                           In this manner the Church of Christ taught by the spirit of his wisdom, doth, and did euer exact perfect chastity of them that were of her Cleargy, though she be sure that in so great a multitude many will fayle who must seeke to be saued by pennance. As adultery in Christians is rather to be suffered then auoyded by allowing many wiues generally vnto Christians, though this be not of it selfe intrinsecally euill: euen so the falling of some Votaies is not so great an inconuenience as this were, that Sacred Ministers should not be bound to professe Chastity worthy of the diuinity of Christian Priesthood, the sinning agaynst Chastity being humane infirmity, but the not exacting thereof an indignity in the very Christian law.
                           For all men not blinded with passion see, it is most vndecēt that Christian consecrated Ministers should goe a wooing and wiuing, and when one wife dyeth wedde another as often as they please, as the Protestant pretended Holy Ministers vse to do. This practise is so euidently vnworthy,  and agaynst all Christian decency, as they cannot bring one allowed example of a Christian Church in any former age, that did permit liberty of wooing &amp; wiuing after Holy Orders, which euen the Graecian Church doth detest. Let them therefore consider how theirs can be the Holy Church, that doth not so much as professe high Sanctity that becomes a Christian Church, no not in her consecrated Ministers and more Religious professours. Specially seing also Ministers by Mariage doe not wholy auoyd the stayne of wandring lust and other impurity, yea themselues acknowledge that they be at the least, as vicious as the Catholicke Cleargy. The sanctity of the Church is not to be measured by the report of zealous cōplaint agaynst sinne, nor is the exaggerated generality therof to be vrged as exact truth, with which kind of stuffe our Minister hath most impertinently patched vp many pages of his Booke, see pag. 82.83.111. &amp; seq. for zealous complaint is Hyperbolicall euen in holy Scripture, as all know. And if Protestāts be remeasured agayne by this rule wherby they measure vs, they will get the worst. For themselues cōplayne that the world is made WORSE by vertue of their doctrine. [Luther postil. in Dom. 1. Aduent.] &amp;, that sinne had NEVER byn so rife, but through the rifenes of their Ghospell. [Doctor King in Ionam, Lecture 45.] that scarse the tenth mā of the Ministry is morally honest. [Caluin in pannych. &amp; in comm. 2. 1. Petr. 2.] No not one, but, all be dissolute and lewd, sayth Luther Dom. 26. post Trinit. In so much as in regard of this enormious wickednes of their Ministery &amp; Church any man may iustly doubt whether they be the true Church, sayth Eberus praefat. ad com. Philip. &amp; in 1. ad Corinth.
                           
                           This may conuince our Minister, that his allegations be of no credit, and that Iudgement of the Sanctity of a Church, is not to be made by the report of zealous complaint, but by the euidence of sight, ruled by vnpartiall search. By which rule one may find in the Catholike Cleargy thousands, and thousands that shew admirable charity, specially in conuerting Infidells, yea that winne the glorious crowne of Angelicall Chastity, for which they would neuer haue striuen, had not the Church bound them thereunto.
                           So that, if human infirmity by occasiō of this law make some men impure, that otherwise perchance in marriage would haue beene chast; so the Grace of God by the same occasiō worketh in innumerable Angelical Saints, who had neuer beene such but for the Churches exaction. And this haruest makes full recompence for that losse, specially seing also many of such delinquents be not lost but saued by Pennance, yea become more excellent Saints then they had beene had they neuer fallen.
                         
                         Chastity, Obedience, Charity, in vndergoing labours for the help of soules, Fortitude in suffering of heroycall Martyrdomes, Zeale and Patience in the rough and rigorous treaty of their bodyes, by miraculous fasting, &amp; another austerityes. This sanctity shineth not in all children of the Church, but in her more eminent preachers &amp; professours. Which kind of sanctity togeather with miracles, if the Church did want, she could not be a sufficiēt witnes of the truth vnto Infidells, who commonly neuer begin to affect, &amp; admire Christianity, but vpon the sight of such wōders of Sanctity, &amp; other extraordinary works. Holy for doctrine,

in regard her Traditions be diuine and holy, without any mixture of errour. For if the Church could deliuer by consent of Ancestours, togeather with truth some Errours, her Traditions, euen about truth were questionable, &amp; could not be belieued vpon the warrāt of her traditions; for who can without danger, and securely, feed on that dish that may aswell containe poyson, as wholsome sustenance? And whereas some Protestants affirme that the Church cannot erre in fundamentall points, but only in thinges of lesse moment; the truth is, that in perpetuall Traditions she cannot erre at all. If the Tradition of the Church deliuering a small thing as receyued from the Apostles may be false, one may call into question her Traditions of moment.
                     For, like as if we admit in the Scripture errours in small matters, we cannot be sure of its infallibility in substātial matters: So likewise, if we graunt Traditions perpetuall to be false in things of lesse importance, we haue no solide ground to defend her Traditions as assured in others of moment. Wherfore as he that should say Gods written word is false in some lesse matters, as when it sayes, S. Paul left his Cloake at Troas, erreth fundamentally by reason of the consequence, which giues occasion to doubt of euery thing in Scripture; euen so, he that graunteth that some part of Traditions, or of the word of God

vnwritten may be false, erreth substantially, because he giueth cause to doubt of any Tradition, which yet as I haue shewed, is the prime and originalll ground of Faith,

more The Minister heere rayleth largely &amp; lustily tearming this assertion impudent, Antichristian, prophane, bastardly &amp;c. yet the assertion is euident truth, &amp; his reasons agaynst it are of no force. For they goe not agaynst the assertion, but proue another thing, to wit, the excellency of Scripture, which none denyes. For Tradition &amp; Scripture according to different cōparisons are equall, &amp; superiour the one to the other. Compare them in respect of certainty of truth, they are equal, as the Councell of Trent defineth sess. 4. both being the word of God, the one Written the other Vnwritten, and so both infinitly certayne. Compare them in respect of depth, sublimity, and variety of doctrine, the Scripture is farre superiour vnto Tradition, Tradition being playne and easy doctrine concerning the common, capitall, and practicall articles of Christianity; wheras the Scripture is full of high &amp; hidden senses, and furnisht with great variety of examples, discourses, and all manner of erudition, Aug. Epist. 3. Compare them in respect of priority and euidence of being the Apostles, the Scripture is posteriour vnto Tradition in tyme and knowledge, and cannot be proued directly to be the Apostles &amp; therfore Gods but by Tradition, as sometime not only Fathers but euen Protestants afffirme. As Philosophy is more perfect then Logicke, and Rhetoricke then Grammer, in respect of high &amp; excellēt knowledge; yet Logike is more prime, originall, fundamentall then Philosophy, Grammer, then Rhetoricke, without the rules and principles wherof they cannot be learned: Euen so Tradition is more prime, and originall then Scripture, though Scripture, in respect of depth and sublimity of discourse, be more excellent then Tradition. fundamentall then the very Scripture, which is not knowne to be Apostolicall, but by Tradition: wheras a perpetuall Tradition is knowne to come from the Apostles by its owne light. For what more euident, thē that that is from the Apostles which is deliuered as Apostolicall by perpetuall succession of Bishops, consenting therein?
                  
                  
                     The Propertyes of the Church, proued by Matth. 28.20. §. 4.
                     ALL this may be cleerly prooued (to omit other pregnant testimonyes) by the words of our Sauiour in the last of S. Matthew, Going into the world, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to keepe all that I haue commanded you: and behold I am with you all dayes euen to the consummation

of the world. A 
                           The Minister pag. 195. lin. 4. sayth, that this promise is conditionall, in repect of Pastours succeeding the Apostles: to wit, that Christ will assist them conditionally whē they teach and baptize as he hath commanded, but that they shall so still teach he doth not promise, p. 24. lin. 28. This exposition is false, first because our Sauiour here promiseth his Presence vnto the Apostles and their successours to baptize, and teach vntill the worlds end, by one and the same forme of speach and indiuiduall breath, so that the promise cannot be conditionall in respect of the successors, except it be also conditionall in respect of the Apostles. But in respect of the Apostles the promise is absolute as the Minister grants pag. 94. lin. 23. Therefore it is also absolute in respect of their successors. Not that this, or that Pastour may not be deceaued, but that they shall neuer deliuer by ioynt consent, any falshood as the Apostles doctrine.
                           Secondly, if the promise be conditionall, then the sense is this; I will alwayes assist you to teach &amp; Christen aright, when you teach &amp; christen according to my commandement, as the Minister expounds pag. 94. lin. 22. But this sense is idle and iust nothing, as if Christ had sayd, Behold I will assist you to teach aright when you teach aright: for what is to teach Christian Religion aright, but to teach it as Christ commanded, &amp; deliuered the same?
                           Thirdly, if this Promise were conditionall &amp; not absolute, then by this place the Church could not be proued to last absolutly for euer, but only so long as she Christeneth aright &amp; teacheth the truth, wherin according to this Protestāt exposition she may fayle. But the Fathers from this text gather agaynst the Donatists, that the Church shal neuer fayle to be in all Nations of the world, vntill the end therof, as S. Aug. in Psalm. 101. conc. 2. Leo Epist. 3. ad Pulcheriam, and others hence proue. Therfore the sense is absolute, his Church shalbe still in the world, &amp; he still assisting his Church by his spirit to teach and baptize aright.
                         promise of wonderfull comfort vnto them, that pawne their soules, &amp; saluation vpon Gods word deliuered by perpetuall Tradition; for in this sentence appeares the six thinges I before set downe. First, that there is still A Christiā Church all dayes, not wanting in the world, so much as one day till the consummation of the world. Secōdly, this Church is euer visible, and conspicuous. For the Church that alwayes teacheth, &amp; Christeneth all Nations, must needs be visible. But this Church alwaies teacheth and Christeneth all Nations, I am alwayes with you, not with you sitting in Corners, or hidden vnder ground but with you, exercising the office enioyned you in the words precedent Docete omnes gentes, baptizantes. Thirdly, this Church is euer Apostolicall, for to his Apostles Christ said, I am alwaies with you to the cōsummation of the world, not with you in your owne persons, but with you in your successours in whome you shal continue vntill the worlds end. Ergo, a lawfull company of Bishops, Pastours, &amp; Doctors succeeding the Apostles must be perpetually in the world. Forthly, this Church is Vniuersal, Ite in mūdum vniuersum, where I will be alwayes with you. Fifthly, this

Church is One, not diuided into parts, because it teacheth and belieueth vniformely all that Christ deliuered and commanded, without Factions, Sects, or Parts about matters of fayth. Sixtly, this Church is alwayes holy for doctrine, neuer deliuering or teaching any falshood: I (who am the Truth) am alwayes with you, teaching all nations. Holy also for life, Christ the holy of holyes assisting and making her able to conuert Infidels, which she could not well doe 
                           The Minister p. 85. &amp; 86.102. alleadgeth diuers Fathers &amp; scholmē to proue that now miracles are ceased &amp; not necessary. Answere. The Minister shold distinguish as the fathers doe, who make two manner of beings of Miracles, to wit, ordinary &amp; extraordinary, and affirme three things. First, that in the primitiue Church miracles were absolutly necessary for the plā
                              ting of the Ghospell in the world. Ioan. 5.24. Act. 4.29.30. and then the gift of miracles was ordinarily annexed vnto the Ministery of Preaching, yea so that euery Christian cōmonly had that gift in some kind or other. 1. Cor. 12.28. Act. 8.17. &amp; 10.4.6.
                           
                           Secondly, that since the planting of the Gospell by twelue Fishermen, this being the miracle of miracles, no further miracle is absolutly necessary for mē vnto whō this is known, and therfore the gift of miracles is ceased to be ordinarily annexed to the office of preaching or common to al Christians, as before it was. Aug. de Ciuit. l. 22. c. 8. Gregor. 27. moral. c. 1.
                           Thirdly notwithstā
                              ding, in all ages there were, are, and shal euer be some speciall places and persons extraordinarily indued with the gift of miracles, for the comfort of Christians Conuersion of some remote Nations that know not the first miraculous planting of our Religion by certayne &amp; celebrious fame: &amp; of miracles in this kind the writings of the Fathers &amp; all Christiā histories are full. See S. Aug. l. 22. de Ciuit. c. 8. &amp; Gregory in his Dialogues.
                           
                           
                              THE PROTESTANT CHVRCH not before Luther.
                           
                         without miracles, and tokens of wonderfull sanctity, at the least in her more eminent Preachers.
                  
                  
                     
                     That the Romane is the One, Holy, Catholike, Apostolical Church, from, &amp; by which we are to receyue the Tradition of Christian Doctrine. §. 5.
                     THIS Ground being laid, it is apparent that the Romane Church, that is the multitude of Christians spread ouer the world, cleauing to the doctrine and Tradition of the Church of Rome, is the only holy, Catholike, and Apostolicall Church.
                     
                        The first Argument.
                        THERE must alwayes be in the world one, holy, Catholike, and Apostolicall Church; That is, a Church deliuering doctrines vniformely, thereby making them credible; vniuersally, thereby making them famously knowne to mankind; holyly, so making them certayne, &amp; such as on them we may securely rely; Apostolically, so making thē perpetually flow without change vnto the present Christianity in the channell of a neuer-interrupted Succession of Bishopps from the Apostles. And this Church 
                              Vnto this Argument the Minister pag. 104. makes answere, that  his Protestant Church was before Luther, in essence &amp; kind, though it began in Luther touching the Name, and some things accidental. In proofe whereof he thus wryteth: In all ages before Luther some persons held the substantiall articles of our Religion, both in the Roman &amp; Grecian Church. And by name the Grecians maintained with vs that the Roman Church hath no primacy of Iurisdiction aboue, or ouer all other Churches; neyther is the same infallible in fayth. They deny Purgatory, Priuate Masses Sacrifice for the dead, and they propugne the Marriage of Priests. In this Westerne part of the world the Waldenses, Thaborites of Bohemia, Wickliffi
                                       •
                                    ts mātayned the same doctrine in substance, as appeareth by their confession of fayth, and by the testimony of some learned Pontificians.
                              
                              This being the substance of all the Minister hath sayd or can say for his Church before Luther, the same is insufficient, false, more for Anabaptists then Protestants. This I proue. In generall this pedegree is insufficient for two reasons. First because it is not for all ages. The Grecians were vnited with the Romane Church vntill the yeare 1060. the Waldensians began about the yeare  1160. Now there remaynes six or seauen ages since the pretended Apostacy of the Roman Church, for which the Minister doth not name any professours that were Protestants for essence and kind. Secondly, because Protestants teach, that the most substantiall article of their Religion is Iustification by speciall fayth only, and not by workes and merits of grace, as all know. But these pretended professours, namely the Waldenses &amp; Wickliffists held rigorously the merit of works. In so much as Wickliffe sayd, Let euery man confide in his merits, for which saying he is refuted by the Catholike authour Thomas Waldensis Tom. 3. c. 7.8.9.
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       
                                          Graecians no Protestants in Essence.
                                          In particular the Pedigree is notoriously false in respect of the Graecians who cannot without impudency be named as Protestants, according to essence and kind. First, they hold damnable heresyes and substantiall errours in the Iudgement of Protestants, so wit Inuocation of Saints, Adoration of Images, as they professe in their Censure sent vnto Protestants, and by them printed, Respons. 2. De Inuocatione Sanctorum. They defend Transubstantiation, ibid. resp. 1. c. 13. Communion in one kind for the sicke, Gilbert. Genebrard de ritibus Graecorum. Secondly, concerning primacy of Iurisdiction, they hold that Christ did institute Monarchicall primacy in Peter, Theophilact. in cap. 21. Ioan. That the Romā Bistop for many ages lawfully succeeded Peter in this Primacy, Ignatius Constantinopolitan. Epist. ad Nicolaum primum. That the Roman Bishop lost this primacy for holding the Procession of the Holy Ghost from God the Sonne, &amp; that therefore this primacy is now in the Patriarke of Constantinople, Michael Constant. apud Sigeb. in Chron. an. 1064. Is this Protestancy in substance? Thirdly it is great indiscretion, (I speake with the least) to affirme as our Minister doth, that the Graeciās deny sacrifice for the dead, with which doctrine no authour Catholike or Protestant euer charged them. And they in their foresayd censure resp. 1. c. 12. professe the contrary, saying, We hold that by the sacrifice of the Masse and Almesdeedes the dead are relieued; yea Doctour Field Appendix part. 1. pag. 30. accuseth some of them for holding Sacrifice not only for them that dyed in pennāce with sinnes of infirmity, but also for them that dyed in damnable state. Finally concerning marriages of Priests, they hold that such as are marryed before Holy Orders may still keep cōpany with their wiues, which the Church of Rome alloweth in them. But the Protestant liberty of marrying after Holy Orders,  &amp; that not only once, but if their wiues dye, twise, thrise, yea as often as they please; This the Graecians detest in the foresayd Censure, Resp. 1. c. 21. So that the Minister was in great penury of Professours before Luther that is forced to name Graecians as Protestants according to kind. For he might aswell haue named the Pope himselfe.
                                       
                                       
                                          Waldenses not Protestants, for Essence and Kind.
                                          Concerning the Waldenses, they were not Protestants according to kind, but rather Anabaptists, vnto whome Protestants are so vnkind as they burne them as Heretikes. They were not Protestants; For (as all report, as may be seene in Illyricus Catal. Test. pag. 1498.) the most essentiall doctrine of the Waldenses was their extolling the merit of voluntary pouerty, preaching the same so rigorously, as they held all Ministers to be damned that haue rents and possessions, and that the Church perished vnder Syluester and Constantine through the poyson of temporall goods which Cleargy-men then began to enioy (as they sayd) agaynst the Law of God. I am sure none that know Protestants will thinke this doctrine of pouerty and giuing away all to the poore to be the Essence, or so much as an Accidence of their Religion. In respect of this their head-heresy about Pouerty, the Waldenses are named the Poore-men of Lyons, and were sayd by Reynerius cited by the Minister pag. 130. to haue beene euer since Siluester or the Apostles, and that they were much applauded in the world, to wit, (as I sayd) only in regard of this Heresy about pouerty, held anciently by the Heretikes tearmed Apostolici, not in respect of other errours or doctrines wherein they agree with Protestants. And so Protestants labour in vayne by Waldensians, and the Apostolici, to bring their pedegree from the Apostles.
                                          Besides, the Waldensians held these Anabaptisticall errours, which are set downe by Illyricus in Catalogo Testium pag. 1502. &amp; seq. out of Reynerius an authour of those tymes whome he tearmes candidum &amp; sincerum, sincere and vnpartiall; That children are not to be baptized, baptisme being of no vse for them, seing they do not belieue; That there is no difference betwixt Bishopps and Priests, nor betwixt Laymen and priests; That the Apostles were meere Laymen; That euery Layman that is vertuous, is priest may consecrate, preach, administer Sacramēts. That a woman pronouncing the words in the vulgar tongue doth consecrate; yea transubstantiate bread into the body of Christ; That it is mortall sinne to sweare in any case; That the Magistrates secular and Ecclesiasticall being in mortall sinne, loose their office, and that no man is to obey them. Indeed Illyricus pag. 1514. &amp; 1525. in  fine sayth, that this last errour is falsly layd to the charge of the Waldēsiās by Reynerius: which he proues, because AEneas Syluius in his Catalogue of their doctrine makes no mentiō of this. But he is grossely deceaued two wayes. First because Reynerius liuing in that tyme, and being Inquisitour could know their errors better then Syluius. Nor can we suspect his fidelity being as Illyricus doth acknowledge sincerus &amp; candidus, sincere and vnpartiall towardes Waldensians. Secondly, AEneas Syluius in his Catalogue set downe by Illyricus euen in that very pag. 1525. a little before the middle, chargeth the Waldēsiās expressely with this doctrine agaynst Magistracy: Qui mortalis culpae reus sit, eū ne
                                                   
                                                      
                                                   
                                                   que
                                                 Saeculari ne
                                                   
                                                      
                                                   
                                                   que
                                                 Ecclesiastica dignitate potiri, nec parendū ei esse. Finally the Waldensians held it not necessary to professe their fayth, yea that they might deny it, go to Masse, celebrate and do outward acts of Idolatry. This euen Illyricus pag. 1508. doth acknowledge to haue beene a fault in them, but he sayth they may haue beene saued by repentance. This is an idle shift, for how could they repent themselues of that which they held not to be sinne? How could they be the true Church, wherein saluation is found, who held such damnable doctrine, as if they did not repent themselues thereof, they are certainly damned: so that it is extreme beggary in Protestants to begge of these Beggars of Lyons, to be their Professours for the tyme before Luther, who were euen by Protestant acknowledgement, much more poore and voyd of true religion, then of temporall wealth.
                                       
                                       
                                          That Protestants not being able to cleere themselues to be the visible Church, do vainely appeale vnto Scripture for their doctrine.
                                          The Minister not trusting to the former answere, and feeling in conscience that it is impossible that Protestants should shew their Church to haue beene visible before Luther, sayth pag. 105. That this notwithstanding if Protestants be able to demonstrate by Scripture, that they maintayne the same fayth and Religion which the Apostles taught, this alone is sufficient to prooue them to be the true Church.
                                          
                                          I answere, they that cānot by marks of the Church set downe in Scripture cleere themselues to be the visible Church, do idly appeale to Scripture in respect of doctrine; &amp; their promises to shew the particular points of their Religion by Scripture are idle. This I demōstrate by 3. Arguments.
                                          
                                          First, eyther Scriptures can cleere &amp; end all cōtrouersies of Religiō, or they cannot. If they cannot, appealing vnto them hath no other end, but  that contention may be without end. If they can cleere all controuersies, then they can cleere the controuersy which is the true Church, shewing markes and signes whereby the same may be cleerly knowne. And if they can cleere this cōtrouersy, thē it is reason this be cleared in the first place. For as Protestants acknowledge the particular examination of doctrines is tedious and long, not for the capacity of all, whereas the finding out of the true Church endeth all controuersyes, seeing we may securely follow her directions and rest in her Iudgement. [Field Epist. dedicat.
                                          
                                          Secondly, what more idle and vayne then to appeale from Scripture, setting downe matters cleerly, vnto Scripture teaching thinges obscurely or not so cleerly? what is this but to appeale from light to darkenes, or at the least from noone day to twy-light? But no particular point of doctrin is in holy Scripture so manifestly set down as is the Church, &amp; the marks whereby the same may be knowne; no matter about which the Scripturs are more copious and cleere, then about visibility, perpetuity, amplitude the Church was to haue; so that as S. Augustine sayth, Scriptures are more cleere about the Church then euen about Christ. [in Psalm. 30. concion. 2.] That Scripture in this poynt is so cleere, that by no shift of false interpretation it can be auoyded; the impudency of any forhead that will stand agaynst this euidence, is confounded. [de vnit. Eccles. c. 5.] That it is prodigious blindnes not to see which is the true Church. [Tract. 1. in 1. Epist. Ioan.] That the Church is the tabernacle placed in the Sunne, that it cannot be hidden vnto any, but such as shut their eyes against it. [l. 2. cont. Petilian. c. 32.] What vanity then is it for Protestants not being able to cleere by Scripture the cleerest of all points, to appeale vnto the prouing of their doctrine by more darke or lesse euident places?
                                          Thirdly, if no man can directly know which be the Scriptures the Apostles deliuered but by the Tradition of the Catholike Church, then it is vayne before they decide this controuersy to vndertake to proue by Scriptures what doctrine the Apostles taught. For how can Scripture make me know what the Apostles taught, vnlesse I know aforehand the Scriptures to be the Apostles? I may see this, or that doctrine deliuered in the Scripture, shewed me as the Apostles, but I cannot know that doctrin to be the Apostles, except I know aforehand the booke to be the Apostles, but this cannot be proued but by the Tradition of the Church.
                                          I omit many other arguments wherby this shift may be conuinced to be but flying from the light of Gods word about the visible Church. For as, sayth Saint Augustine l. 1. contra Crescon. cap. 33. God would haue his  Church to be described in Scripture without any ambiguity, as cleere as the beames of the Sunne, that the controuersy about the true Church, being cleerly decided, when questions about particular doctrines that are obscure, arise, we might fly to her, and rest in her iudgement, &amp; that this visibility is a manifest signe wherby euen the rude and ignorant may discerne the true Church from the false. [Augustine l. 13. cont. Faust. c. 13.]
                                       
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                            must eyther be the Roman, or

the Protestant, or some other opposite vnto both. Protestants cannot say a Church opposite vnto both, for then they should be condemned in their owne Iudgement, and bound to conforme themselues to that Church, which can be no other but the Grecian; a Church holding almost as many (if not more) doctrines which Protestāts dislike thē doth the Church of Rome, as I can demonstrate if need be. It is also most manifest, &amp; vndenyable, that Protestants are not such, nor part of such a Church since their Reuolt and separation from the Romane, seing confessedly they changed their doctrines they once held, forsooke the body wherof they were members, brake off from the stocke of that tree wherof they were branches. Neyther did they depart from the Roman &amp; ioyne themselues with any Church professing their particular doctrines dissonant from it. Ergo, the Roman is the one, holy, Catholike, &amp; Apostolicall Church.
                     
                     
                        The second Argument.
                        THIS also plainly will appeare to any man of vnderstanding that will cast on the Roman Church an vnpartiall eye.

For she is most euidently Apostolicall, hauing most glorious successiō of Bishops &amp; Pastours famous in all 
                              The Minister p. 116. lin. 9. sayth, that it is incōsequent to inferre negatiuely from humane history, &amp; to say historyes are silent, &amp; therfore no such matter. I answere. Hēce one may feele euen with his hand, what an vnconsequent, and absurd Religion theirs is, which cannot stand without denying principles euident in common reason, &amp; receaued by consent of mankind: for who doth not feele that to argue from humane history thus negatiuely they are silent, Therfore there neuer was any such matter, is many times conuincing and strong? This some Protestants more iudicious then our Minister, acknowledge, who thus write: It is most playne that euen negatiuely an argument from humane authority may be strong, as namely this: The Chronicles of England mention no more then only six Kings bearing the name of Edward since the tyme of the last Cōquest, therfore it cannot be there should be more. It is true, men are ignorant, many things may escape them, they may be deceaued, they may conceale truth, or vtter vntruth out of malice, they may forget what they know; Howbeit INFINITE CASES are wherin all these impediments are so MANIFESTLY excluded, as there is no shew or colour wherby any such exception may be taken. Thus M. Hooker Eccles. Policy pag. 115. &amp; 116.
                              Now, amongst these cases wherein the negatiue argument from Tradition and history is strong, the chiefest is when the matter is famous and illustrious, and there is a line and succession of chiefe Bishops, Princes, &amp; Persons notoriously knowne euen to the particularityes of their names, actions, dayes of their raygne, and death. Wherfore it is idle what the Minister pag. 230. brings agaynst this, that we know not who was the first that eate mans flesh, nor when the Assyrian matrons did first prostitute themselues in the temple of Venus. For no wonder we know not such things, seing we haue not a lineall history of these times, as we haue of other times, specially since the comming of Christ. For lineall history concerning illustrious matters is both affirmatiuely &amp; negatiuely strong, yea more strong negatiuely then affirmatiuely. The reason is, because it is not so impossible that men with full report should vent an vntruth, as that they should be by full cōsent silent about a most illustrious truth, men being in such cases more prone to report then to conceale. For example, should one contest that some of our Kings since the Conquest set vp Images in al Churches of England, the Country being before that tyme pure Protestant, might not such an impudent writer be conuinced of madnes by negatiue history? And why? But, because there is a most notorious line of our Kings since the last Conquest, and their names, actions, dayes of their raygne, and deathes most famously knowne. In the same manner there being a line of Popes so conspicuously knowne, as nothing more, from Peter vnto Vrban they eight, what impudency is it for Protestants to affirme, that Rome was pure Protestant for the first fiue or six hundred yeares, and that afterward the Pope changed Protestācy into Papacy, brought in Images, Inuocatiō of Saints, Auricular Confession, Adoration of the Sacrament, and the like horrible noueltyes and changes of the whole world, which could not but haue been noted, if they had beene nouelties; wheras all histories be silent herein, yea they mention the contrary, to wit, how Popes euer resisted them that would haue innouated about these points.

The truth is, the Pharisees pretended not their obseruations, as successions hand to hand from Moyses, but as Traditions of their owne. Some they vrged as deductions frō the Scripture, which they (Protestant-like) did pretend to vnderstand better &amp; more rigorously then any before them: such was their doctrine agaynst healing diseased persons, &amp; doing small labors, as gathering eares of corne on the Sabboth day, much like our Protestant Sabba

I answere. That the vnity and consent of a grand diffused multitude spread ouer the world in the Tradition of Ancestors about Religion, doth euidently reduce Religion to the first external authour, &amp; publisher, &amp; the credit of his word. The vnity &amp; consent of Mahometans in their Tradition from Mahomet proues their Religion to be Mahomets, and consequently in the Iudgement of Christians the Religion of a false Prophet: Our vnity and consent in the Christian Tradition of our Auncestours from Christ, proues euidently our Religion to be of Christ, and consequently diuine and true, as certainly as it is certaine that Christ Iesus was the Messenger of God, and God the Author of truth. So that the vnity of the Romane Church proues directly her Religion to be Christs, and then by consequence to be diuine verity.

In which proofe that these propertyes agree to the Romane, and be wanting in the Protestāt Church, I will not inlarge my selfe as I otherwise might, aswell not to weary your Maiesty, as also not to seeme to diffide (the matter being most cleere) of your Maiesties Iudgment. Wherfore it is more then cleere that the Roman is the One, Holy, Catholike, Apostolicall Church, by whose Tradition Christian Religion hath beene, is, and shall be euer continued from the Apostles, to the worlds end.
                     
                     
                        The third Argument.
                        PROTESTANTS haue the Holy Scriptures deliuered vnto them by, and

from the one, holy, Catholike, and Apostolicall Church. But they receiued them from no other Church then the Roman. Ergo, the Roman is the one, holy, Catholike, and Apostolicall Church.
                        The Maior I proue. If Protestants haue not the Text of Scripture by, and from the one, holy, Catholike &amp; Apostolical Church they cannot be certaine they haue the true incorrupt text the Apostles deliuered, and recommended as diuine, to the first Christians, seeing the Tradition of any other Church is fallible The Minister pag. 119. obiecteth agaynst this, that if we cannot be sure of the Scripture except the immediat deliuerer therof be infallible, then we cannot be sure except we haue the Scripture immediately from the hand of the Pope, or generall Coū
                              cell who only are infallible. Answere. We must (as Theology teacheth) distinguish immediationem suppositi, &amp; immediationē virtutis, that is the immediate person which deliuers Scripture, and the immediate authority vpon the credit wherof Scripture is deliuered. The person immediatly deliuering may be a single Minister fallible taken solely by himselfe, but the immediate authority that deliuers Scripture is euer, and must still be infallible, to wit, the authority of the Churches Tradition. For we neither must nor can belieue firmely any Minister of the Catholicke CHVRCH, affirming a booke to be Scripture vntill we see cleerly that he deliuers therein the consent of the Catholike Church, which then is euident vnto vs, when we see him preach it freely and openly, and no Pastour to contradict him therein. &amp; may deceyue. And if it may deceiue, how can they be certaine that they are not deceiued, seeing they thē
                           selues liued not in the Apostles dayes, nor saw with their owne eyes what coppyes the Apostles deliuered. But Protestants, as they pretend, be certaine that they haue the true incorrupt Apostolicall text of Scripture. Ergo, they haue it vpon the authority of the holy, Catholike, Apostolicall Church.
                        Now the Minor that they haue the Scripture from the Romane is apparant: for what other Church did deliuer vnto Luther the text of the Bible, assuring him that they had it by Tradition from Auncestors tyme out of mind, as giuen originally by the Apostles? Which is accordingly acknowledged

This I prooue: if the Apostles did not deliuer the bare Text, but togeather with the Text, the true We doe not say, that the Apostles did deliuer the true sense of all their Scriptures, making a large and entire commentary of all difficil texts, as the Minister cauilleth pa. 121. but only, that togeather with the text they deliuered the sense, about the mayne and most principall points; &amp; this sense thus deliuered by Traditiō with the text, is to be admitted as religiously and reuerently as the text. sense of Scripture to be deliuered perpetually vnto posterity, then they who by Tradition rereiue from the Apostles the true Text, must togeather receiue the true sense. But, as

                           Augustine argueth, that they that deliuer the text of Christs Ghospell must also deliuer the exposition; affirming, that he would sooner refuse to belieue Christ, then admit any interpretation contrary to them, by whome he was brought to belieue in Christ. For they that can deliuer by vniforme Tradition a false sense, why may they not also deliuer a false text, as receyued frō the Apostles? An

argument conuincing, and 
                              Though the Minister pag. 123. storme at this confidence of his Aduersary in tearming it vnanswerable, yet by deeds he confirmes the saying to be true in not answering, but chā
                                 ging the force thereof quite another way, saying: It is this: The text of the Scripture may be as easily corrupted as the sense. Ergo, All they which can deliuer by vniforme Tradition a false sense, may also deliuer a false text. In this argument he denyeth the antecedent or assumption. I answere. First, as I sayd, the argument is peruerted, and the medium, or meanes of proofe changed; for there is great difference betwixt Being as easy, &amp;, Being as possible, seing a thing may be as possible as another, and yet not so easy. That ten men should conspire to deceaue me, is not so easy as that three should so conspire, as is euident; Yet it is as possible as the other, because no reason can be brought to proue that three may so conspire, that proues not that also ten may do the like. In the same manner though we should grant the sense may be more easily mistaken by the Church then the text, yet it is as possible, that the Church be mistaken in the sense: Because no reason proues that vniforme Tradition can be mistaken in the sense, that proues not that it is possible that the Church may be mistaken in the text, though perchance not so easily. Now, if the Church in her vniforme Tradition may be mistaken about the text, then is not Traditiō a sufficient ground of infallible perswasion that the text is the Apostles, and so fayth is ouerthrowne, which hath no other ground to know assuredly the incorrupt Scriptures deliuered by the Apostles but Traditiō, as hath been prooued.
                              Secondly it is false, that the sense and doctrine of Scripture concerning mayne and substantiall articles of fayth, may be sooner corrupted, and a false sense persuaded to the Church, then a false text. The reason is manifest, because millions of Christians know by Tradition the doctrine of Scripture about mayne points, that know not all the texts by which the same is proued, yea perchance truly &amp; certainly not so much as one. For example the doctrine, that there are Three Diuine Persons, and One God, is so ingrauen in the harts of all, euen simple Christians, as you may sooner pull out their harts, then make them belieue that this is not the Christian fayth: whence no man can deny the Trinity, but he is presently noted by al. On the other side this text 1. Ioan. 5.7. wherby the Trinity is proued, There be three that giue testimony in heauen, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and these three are one, millions do not know, and so it is more easy to take from Christians this text then the doctrine therof. And the same reason is of any other text, the texts being stil commonly farre more vnknowne then the doctrine of the Creed, &amp; such substantiall points.
                            vnanswerable.
                     
                     
                        The fourth Argument.

                              Heere the Minister pag. 128. agayne repeateth his saying, that negatiue arguments from humane history are vnconsequent: which his saying, as hath beene shewed, is agaynst the consent of mankind. His arguments against this ground of perpetuall Ecclesiasticall Tradition knowne by notorious fame of history, are by him named foure but the fourth cōtaines foure branches, and so they are eight, which I will set downe &amp; answere. First it is not absolutely necessary that the humane history of all matters should be composed. Answere. There being a cleere lineal succession of Princes and Prelates from the Apostles famously &amp; particulrely knowne, it is impossible but that historicall Traditiō eyther written or vnwritten should deliuer most notoriously the substantiall matters of fact done since that time. These matters are such, as cause great changes in the world; as in Ciuill affayres, the setting  vp, the pulling down, and changing of renowned Kingdomes &amp; States: 
                                    •
                                 n the affayres of the Church, the beginnings of Religiō, the most famous Pastors thereof, the conuersions of great Nations, the springing vp of heresies &amp; potēt sects, their preuailing, their being resisted, their ouerthrow, and commonly also the names of their principall &amp; renowned Patrons; 
                                    •
                                 hese illustrious thinges, when there is particular Tradition euen to the very names of persons, can not be hidden. Secondly, when history is written, it causeth only humane fayth. Answer. Humane history made by meere human writers and preachers concerning humane and naturall thinges breedes only humayne fayth, but Ecclesiasticall Tradition hand to hand from the Apostles made by the Pastours of the Church, consecrated to that end by the holy Ghost deliuering diuine reuealed thinges being infallible, breedes not only human Fayth, but is eleuated by the concurrence of diuine Authority towardes the production of Diuine Fayth, as hath beene sayd.
                              
                                 Thirdly, historyes may totally perish and be suppressed, or corrupted by the enemies of truth. Answere. Concerning substantiall renowned matters which are knowne not only by report but also by their permanent effects, it is impossible that fame and Tradition should be suppressed or corrupted, so long as there is a visible Church in the world. For example; Arius his doctrine, Luthers occasion of changing from the Roman Church, King Henryes breach with the Pope, and the cause thereof, can neuer be suppressed by the ennemyes of truth, so long as there shallbe a famous Christian Church in the world, though about this or that circumstance that are not so notorious, questions are mooued, and new may arise.
                              
                                 Fourthly, history may be repugnnant to history. Answere. This cannot be about the substance of the narration when the matters thereof are in manner aforesayd illustrious, to wit, when they are not only declared by full report, but also declare themselues by effects, though in circumstāce there may be variety of reports.

Doe not the most ancient Fathers, namely the Councell of Carthage, &amp; S. Augustine receyue some bookes of Scripture to the number of 12. which Protestants partly Caluinists, partly Lutherās reiect? Must we therfore refuse triall by Scripture? No: It is sufficiēt that we haue by most certayne Traditiō innumerable works that are vndeniably ancient, though question be mooued about some, which therefore cannot be vrged till they be knowne to be ancient.
                              
                                 Seauenthly, the Papists being a part, purge &amp; alter such records. Answere. This is vntruth, we purge not any of the bookes of the ancient, as any may see with his eyes that will take the paynes to read our Index Expurgatorius, set forth by the Protestant Iunius, and compare the Expurgations with the bookes.
                              Eightly, the Papists despise and contemne Historians, as Eusebius, Sozomen, Socrates, when they are agaynst their Tenet. Answere. When good Historians do not agree, the matter cānot be certayne, but must be decided by cō
                                 īecture; which doth neuer happē about the substance of famous facts that by effects made themselues notorious to the world. When historians are singular they may be reiected, specially when the authours are otherwise heretikes, and the narrations wherein they be singular, fauour their heresyes.
                              Thus Eusebius being an Arrian, is not trusted in some narrations agaynst others historians, concerning Constantine, that seeme to fauour Arrianisme. Socrates, and Sozomen being Nouatians are not easily credited in singular narrations in the behalfe of their Sect: Though as I sayd, concerning matters &amp; illustrious facts which make themselues euident to mankind by effects, as are the changing of Christiā Religion ouer the world, resistance made agaynst all open and notorious sects, and who were the resisters, who the resisted, such difference is neuer found about substance but only in circumstance. And only this Tradition of the Church concerning these kinds of notorious matter which is as cleerly Apostolicall as the sunne is bright at Noone day, we make the ground of our beliefe, that our Roman Religion hath not beene changed since the Apostles.

                           tants, whose testimonies plentifull in this behalfe, if need require, shall be brought. First, that the doctrines of the Roman Church which Protestants refuse, haue byn vniuersally receyued for many ages, a thousand yeares at least, euer since Boniface the third. Secondly that Protestants cannot tell the tyme when the Church of Rome began to change, and deuiate from the Apostolicall doctrine deliuered by succession. Ergo, the Roman Church neuer changed her fayth, so that her doctrines are to be receaued as Apostolicall, if the Maior of the first argument be true,

to wit, that The Minister pag. 15. sayth, The Iesuite conueyeth into S. Augustins proposition certayne wordes to wit, doctrines vniuersally receiued &amp;c. which are not found in S. Augustine; for this Father did neuer allow that the vniuersall Church belieue any doctrin of faith not cōmāded in Scripture. I answere. The wordes of S. Augustine will discouer the Minister what he is, for these they are formally, in the place cited by the Iesuite l. 5. de baptis. c. 23. Many things are Held by the Vniuersall Church, &amp; therefore are TRVLY belieued to haue beene COMMANDED by the Apostles, though they be NOT WRITTEN. Thus he. And though there be no doctrine which may not be in some sort proued by Scripture, and deriued from thence by cō
                              sequence, yet this Logicall Deduction doth not suffice to make doctrines to be vniuersally matters of fayth, except they be also deliuered expresly by Tradition, or the word of God vnwritten, as hath been often shewed in this Reioynder. 
                           doctrines vniuersally receyued, whose beginning are not knowne are to be belieued as Apostolicall. And what more true, this being a principle set downe by S. Augustine lib. 4. de Baptism. cont Donat. c. 6. &amp; lib. 5. cap. 23. allowed by Doctour Whitguift late Archbishop of Canterbury [Defence pag. 351. &amp; 352.] who in his booke written by publike authority agaynst Puritans, citing diuers Protestants as concurring in opinion with him, sayth, Whatsoeuer opinions are not known to haue begunne since the Apostles tyme, the same are not new or secundary, but receyued their originall from the Apostles. But because this principle of Christian Diuinity brings in (as M. Cartwright there alleadged speaketh) all Popery in the Iudgment of all men, I will further demonstrate the same, though of it selfe cleere inough.
                        The spirit of Christ, or Christ by his spirit being still with the Church, cannot permit errours in fayth so to creepe into the church, as they grow irreformable euē by the principles of christianity▪ but if errours could so creepe into the church as their beginning could not be known since the Apostles, and neuer be espyed till they be vniuersally receaued, then errour could so creepe into the Church &amp; preuayle that by the principles of christianity they are irreformable. This I prooue, because errors

                           The Minister sayth, that the errours of the Pharisees were vniuersally receaued in the Iewish Church, and yet reformed by our Sauiour. I answere. First his desire to make our Religiō like the Pharisees makes him fashion vnto the Pharisees a Religion of his owne head as if he had neuer read the Ghospell. For the Traditions of the Pharisies were certaine practises of piety inuented by themselues, &amp; deducted by their skill from Scripture, wherby they would seeme singularly religious, &amp; non sicut caeteri hominum. Secondly, Christ Iesus prouing himselfe to be true God might reforme errours vniuersally receaued, &amp; the Church of the Iewes falling, erect a new Church of Christians as he did. But this is lawfull for no man, eyther before or since. For Christian Religion must continue vntill the worlds end, by vertue of the first Tradition therof, neuer interrupted without extraordinary and Propheticall beginning, by immediate reuelation &amp; miracles; and so if errours be deliuered by the full consent of Christian Tradition, they are irreformable. irreformable by the Principles of

vniuersally receyued &amp; cannot be prooued by any Traditions of Ancestours to be otherwise planted in the world, but by the Apostles themselues, through the efficacy of innumerable miracles? Wherefore these doctrins if they be errors, are errors which by the principles of Christianity no man ought to goe about to reforme. And seeing it is impossible, that there should be any such errours, we must acknowledge that principle of S. Augustine as most certayne. That doctrines receyued vniuersally in the Church without any knowne beginning are truly and verily Apostolicall, and of this kind are the Roman, from which Protestants are gone.
                     
                     
                        The fifth Argument.
                        THAT doctrine which Tradition hath deliuered as the doctrine of all Ancestours without deliuering any Orthodoxe opposition agaynst it, that is, opposition made by any confessed Catholike Doctors or Fathers, is doctrine deriued from the Apostles without change.
                        But such is the doctrine of the Roman Church, which consent and Tradition of Ancestours doth deliuer, and doth not togeather deliuer that any confessed The Minister pag. 141. &amp; 144. lin. 8. sayth that in the dayes of the Fathers the Roman doctrine was not in being, nor heard of, and that this was they cause they did not so punctually and litterally oppose them. I Answere. The Minister doth but set a face on the matter. For he knowes, that it is most euident &amp; confessed by Protestāts that at the least some Fathers held our Religion expressely in diuers particulars. For exāple, doth not Origen teach and practise Inuocation of Saints lib. 2. in Iob. &amp; in Iosue. c. 13. as a doctrine vndoubtedly pious, saying therof: Quis dubitat? in Num. c. 31. Did not diuers Fathers make it their special study to discouer Origens errors, as S. Hierome, Epiphanius, Theophilus? And yet these Fathers hauing noted so many errours in Origē, neuer cēsured him in respect of this. Which is a manifest signe they held with Origen in this po

know indeed by Tradition, that some in former tymes stood agaynst many points of the Roman doctrine, as Arrius, Pelagius, Waldo, the Albigenses, Wickliffe, Husse, and some others, but they are not confessed orthodoxe Fathers, but were noted for nouelty and singularity, and for such by Tradition described vnto vs: which kind of opposition doth not discredit the doctrine of the Church, but rather makes the same to appeare more cleerly and famously Apostolicall; seing as euen D. Field, Of the Church lib. 4. cap. 14. doth confesse) When a doctrine 
                           It is true as the Minister sayth pag. 140. That this Doctour doth not make the iudgemēt of the present Bishops of one age by it selfe solely infallible, but only the iudgment of perpetuall succession from the Apostles: yet it is true also that he makes the consent of one age so great, as is heere expressed, an euident signe of the iudgement of perpetuall succession. Reade the place.
                           is in any age cōstantly deliuered as a matter of Fayth, and as receyued from Ancestors in such sort as the contradictours thereof were in the beginning noted for nouelty, and if they persisted in contradiction, in the end charged with heresy, it is not possible but such a doctrine should come by succession from the Apostles. What more euident signe of a perpetuall Apostolicall Tradition, then this?
                        Protestants answere that it is sufficient that the Roman doctrine was cōtradicted

by Orthodoxe Fathers, and that this may be proued by their wrytings which they haue left vnto posterity, though their opposition was not noted by antiquity, nor by the fame of Traditiō deliuered vnto posterity. But this answere leaues no meanes wherby common people may know certainly the perpetuall Tradition of Gods Church, without exact examining and looking into the workes of the Fathers; which cōmon people cannot do, I proue it.
                        If against euery Tradition of the Church difficil &amp; obscure passages may be brought out of Fathers, &amp; this doth suffice to make the same questionable, then no Tradition can be certainly knowne without exact reading, and examining of the Fathers. But no Tradition, or Doctrine is so constantly &amp; cleerly deliuered by the Fathers but diuers obscure and difficill places out of their workes may be brought agaynst them, with such a shew, that The Minister doth p. 141. &amp; 144. auerre, that seely Ignorant men are to examine controuersies by Scripture; and, that by it they may know the right doctrin in al necessary matters assuredly, without resting vpon the authority of the Churches Tradition. This hath been formerly confuted, and it is to men of Iudgement, ridiculous. Yea the Minister himself elswhere Orthodoxe 392. derides it saying: A blind man cannot iudge of colours, &amp; a rude and ignorant person is lesse able to EXAMINE Controuersyes, and deepe points of Religion. And agayne ibid. pag. 393.

How thē shall these be saued, but by simply belieuing the Tradition of Auncestors, hand from hād deliuered vnto them? common people shall not know what to say. For what Tradition more constantly deliuered by the Christian doctors then our Sauiours consubstantiality with his Father according to his diuine nature? and yet the New reformed Arrians, as you may see in Bellarmin. l. 2. de Christo cap. 10. bring very many testimonies of ancient Fathers to proue that in this point they did contradict themselues, and were contrary one to another; which places whosoeuer shall read, will

cleerly see, that to common people they are vnanswerable; yea that common people are not capable of the answeres that learned men yield vnto such obscure passages; what then shall they doe? They must answere, that antiquity did neuer acknowlege such dissention amongst the Fathers in the point of our Sauiours Consubstantiality, which they would not haue omitted to do had there byn any such reall dissension, seing they noted the Fathers opposition in lesser matters. In the same manner Catholikes doe sufficiently answere Protestants that bring places of Fathers agaynst the receyued Traditions of the Church, as the Reall Presence, Inuocation of Saints, and other the like, to wit, that Traditions deliuered these doctrines, as the vniforme consent of the Fathers, and neuer noted such oppositions, as Protestants frame out of their writings; which is a cleere signe that Protestants eyther misalleadge their words, or mistake their meaning. For were that contradiction reall, why did not Antiquity famously note it, as it noted &amp; conueyed by fame to posterity their differēces about disputable matters? The Minister heere will retort this argument pag. 144. lin. 34. If euery doctrin (saith he) is Apostolical against which the ancient Fathers made no expresse opposition, then these Protestant articles are Apostolicall; that the Roman Bishop and Councell may erre; that the substance of bread &amp; wine remayne after consecration; that common prayer ought to be vttered in a known language. I answere, Not euery doctrine against which the Fathers doe not expresly oppose, is Apostolicall, for some heresies were not thought of in that tyme, as this Protestant persuasion, That Common prayer must be sayd by the publike Minister in a language vulgarly vnderstood of euery woman, and that it doth not suffice that the more principal persons of the Church vnderstand it, word by word, and the rest being instructed, doe for matter and substance, though not word by word: So not euery doctrine not opposed, but euery doctrine that is taught confessedly, as Christian doctrine, by some anciēt Fathers, &amp; was neuer expressly &amp; by name opposed by any of the Fathers; Doctrine I say, thus taught &amp; neuer opposed, &amp; as such deliuered by full Tradition, is infallibly Apostolicall. Such are our doctrins, as may be proued euen in the particular exāples brought by the Minister as for the contrary, particularly in this first instāce of their doctrine, That the Roman Bishop &amp; Councells may erre. For was this Protestant doctrine neuer opposed by any Father? doe not the Magdeburgians Centur. 4. col. 550. acknowledge the auncient Ecclesiasticall Canon, that the Councels are not to be celebrated without the sentence of the Roman Bishop? And the Fathers held such Cōncells had the holy Ghost, so as they could not erre; so cleerly, as Luther complaynes, Postill. Wittemb. Dom. 8. post. Trinitatem. fol. 114.6. § 3 Gregory, Augustin, and many other holy Fathers erred in taking from vs power to iudge our Teachers commanding vs to belieue the POPE and Councells. For this misery is very auncient in the Church. Thus he. This answere is full, and a certayne ground of perswasion, else (as I sayd) common people could neuer know the assured Tradition of their Auncestours, vpon which they must (as I prooued) build their Chistian beliefe, seing as D. Field in the epistle Dedicatory

also noteth, There be few, and very few that haue leasure, or strengh of Iudgenent to examine particular controuersyes by Scripture or Fathers, but needes must rest in that doctrine which the Church deliuers as a Tradition, neuer contradicted by any Orthodoxe Fathers.
                        To discredit therfore a cōstant receaued Tradition, it is necessary to bring an Orthodoxe contradiction thereof, not newly found out by reading the Fathers, but a contradiction by the same of antiquity deliuered vnto posterity, which kind of contradiction they cannot find agaynst any point of Catholike doctrine. For let them name but one Father whom Antiquity doth acknowlege as a Contradictour of Inuocation of Saints, Adoratiō of the Sacrament, Reall Presence, Prayer for the dead? they cannot certainly, though they bring diuers places to proue (a thing which Antiquity neuer noted or knew of before) that the Fathers be various, and wauering about these points.

                           The Minister in making answere vnto this Paragraffe, is from the beginning to the end not only exceeding bitter, and full of rayling, but also impertinent, not vnderstanding the state of the cōtrouersy, nor what the Iesuite vndertaketh to proue. The Iesuites conclusion bendeth against some Protestants with whom he dealt in his Conferences, holding there is no fundamentall difference betwixt the Roman Church and the Protestant, that men may be saued indifferently in the one and the other, Protestant doctrines wherein they differ from the Roman, though they should be errours not being fundamentall, and damnable errours.
                           The Iesuits intention was agaynst these men not to proue absolutely that Protestants erre, (for then he would haue proued the Nine obiected articles to be errours, by such testimonyes of Scriptures and Fathers as would haue puzzeled the Minister) but supposing as giuen and not granted by his aduersaryes, Dato, &amp; non concesso, that Protestants erre, he vndertaketh to shew their errours to be mayne, fundamental and damnable, and that the mantayners therof cannot be saued, and so no saluation to be had but in the one, Catholike Church. Hence it is euident, that the Ministers labour to shew that the Protestant doctrines be not errours, is impertinent; for this the Iesuite did not intend to proue, but supposing they are errours, to proue they are damnable and fundamentall errours, agaynst Adiaphorists, that hold there is no fundamentall difference betwixt the Protestant, and Roman Church.
                         fundamentall Errours about fayth.
                     Errours are The Minister sayth, that errours fundamentall must be conuinced to be such out of Scripture, citing to this purpose the saying of S. Augustine De doctrin. Christian. lib. 2. cap. 3. In these thinges that are cleerly deliuered in Scripture, are contayned all those things which contayne fayth and good manners. I answere. S. Augustine sayth not, that all necessary thinges are contayned expressely in Scripture, not in particular, and distinctly, but in generall, and according to the genericall name of necessary vertues, as his words fully set down declare, which are these; All things that contayne fayth and good manners, to wit, hope and charity. No doubt but the genericall dutyes of Fayth, Hope, &amp; Charity are expressely, &amp; euen in so many words set downe in Scripture, though not all particularityes about them, seing now all Protestants graunt, that some things are contayned in Scripture inuoluedly and implicitly, that is, in other tearmes intricately and obscurely. fundamentall, that is

damnable, eyther in regard of the matter, because agaynst some substantiall matter of fayth, the knowledge whereof is necessary for the performance of a required Christian duty; or in regard of the manner they are held, to wit, so obstinately as in defence of them one denyes the Catholike Church. Errours fundamentall of the first kind Protestants haue diuers, particularly these Nine.
                     First, their doctrine agaynst Tradition vnwritten, wherby the By Tradition, is vnderstood, Doctrine known precedently &amp; independently of Scripture, though perchāce the same be written. This doctrine precedē
                           tly knowne vnto Scripture the Minister professeth that Protestants deny pag. 105. lin. 24. &amp; consequently they erre fundamētally. For here by they be forced to make the resolution of their fayth by the euidence of the thing and light of the matter, agaynst the first ground of Christiā Religiō that in this life we walk by faith, &amp; not by euidēce as hath been shewed. Foundation is ouerthrowne, on which we belieue all other substantiall and fundamentall points, as hath been shewed.
                     Secondly, their denying the The Minister though he deny the Primacy of S. Peter, yet is forced by the euidēce of the sacred Text to grāt that whēce this primacy is proued. First, p. 157. that S. Peter had the Primacy of spirituall authority &amp; vniuersall Iurisdiction ouer the whole Church with the rest of the Apostles. Secondly, that this was giuen him singularly, 
                            to wit, as appeares by the Ghospell Matth. 16.10. Ioan. 20.21. by the singular order &amp; institutiō Christ applyed to him. Now this doth inforce Monarchicall primacy. For the three different formes of gouernement, Democracy, Aristocracy, Monarchy, are nothing els but three different applications of the primacy of iurisdiction vniuersall, to different persons. Primacy of vniuersall Iuridiction applyed generally to the whole Commons, is Democracy, applyed principally to some few chiefe persons of the State, Aristocracy, applyed singularly to one indiuiduall person, Monarchy. And what is vnderstood by Monarchy, but primacy of power and vniuersall Iurisdiction applyed singularly to one indiuiduall person ouer all the affaires of a whole and entiere state? Hence the Apostles were, as the Fathers say, both equall and inferiour vnto Peter. Equall, in that they had the same kind of power that Peter had, to wit the authority of the Key-bearers, of the Rockes, of the Pastors of the vniuersall Church, nor doe we read in the Ghospell any kind of power giuen to Peter which was not also giuen for kind to the rest: on the other side, the other Apostles were inferiour vnto Peter, as the same Fathers affirme, in that they had the same kind of power in a lower degree with subordination vnto Peter as the chiefe, no kind of power being giuen to the rest of the Apostles, which we doe not expressely reade in the Ghospell to haue been giuen to S. Peter by singular commission, order, and institution. Whence it is consequent that Peter was gouernour of the whole Church with the rest, in more eminent degree of power and Iurisdiction then the rest, all men being bound to obey him more specially, more singularly, and aboue the rest. The eminency of the rest in the Church was vniuersall power had by commission directed cō
                           monly to them all, wherby they all indifferently, not one more then the other, receaued commission of power in respect of all men of the Church distinct from themselues. The eminency of Peter in the Church was vniuersall power giuē by commission directed singularly to his only person, To Peter the sonne of Ionas, Matth. 16.18. Wherby he was endued with primacy of Ecclesiasticall power in respect of all men in the Church distinct from himselfe, in which number all Christians absolutely are comprehended, not one excluded. And this is Monarchy. Now, if Christ did ordayne and institute Monarchicall Gouernement in his Church, then the gouernement thereof must be, and was▪ euer Monarchicall, and that Peter still hath had a Monarchicall successour; but if he had such a successour it is by all historyes more euident then the sunne, that he had no other but the Roman Bishop. What the Minister heere obiecteth agaynst the Roman   Bishops Primacy is triuiall stuffe, vrged without any new difficulty, to wit, about the tytle of vniuersall Bishop, the Nicene Canon, Contention of S. Cyprian with Pope Stephen, the controuersy of the Africans about Appellations, the Asians resisting Pope Victor. All which Instances truly examined, proue the primacy most euidently▪ as is shewed by Bellarmine l. 2▪ de Pontif. &amp; lately by Fidelis Annosus de Monarchia Ecclesiastica. l. 2. c. 5. &amp; 6. 
                         Primacy of S. Peter &amp; his successours, the fundation which Christ layd of his Church necessary for the perpetual gouernment therof, Matth. 16.18.
                     
                        Thirdly, their questioning the infallible Authority of lawfull The Minister heere rayleth agaynst Councells gathered by the authority of the Pope, and in most grosse mā
                           ner falsifieth Cusanus in eight or nine particulars, but in fine he dares not make direct answere to the question proposed, whether Protestants hold the definitions of Lawfull Generall Coū
                           cels to be infallible or not. His answere hereunto is like the oracle of Apollo, giuen in generall and doubtfull tearmes, to wit, that Protestants giue the same authority vnto Councells that the ancient Church did; in the margent he cites S. Augustine; that Councells of Bishops are not to be equalled vnto Scriptures, as doubtles they may not. The truth is, though he be ashamed to say it in plaine tearmes, Protestants hold General Coū
                           cells lawfully assembled to be inferiour not only vnto Scripture, but also vnto their exposition thereof. For they teach, that Councells be not assisted by the holy Ghost, that it is most pernicious yea abominable to thinke so of them. Luther Tom. 7. Germ. Wittenberg. fol. 262. and though they proceed lawfully and be confirmed by the supreme Pastours, yet be they fallible, examinable, refusable, and subiect to the Protestant skill in Scripture. In so much as the same Luther in his articles, art. 115. sayth▪ 
                           When Councells haue defined, then will we be Iudges whether they be to be accepted, or not. And the same sayth Caluin. l. 4. Instit. cap. 9. Hence appeares how idle their pretence is, that forsooth they would fayne haue a free Generall Councell. To what purpose? Surely they can intend nothing els but that they may bring the Councell to be of their humour, or els if it be agaynst them, to contemne it as not being in their iudgement conforme vnto Scripture. It is reason M. White, that you first meete amongst your selues, You I say, that pretend to be reformed, and see whether you can agree, that Generall Councells are infalli

                            by the spirit of Christ▪ so that no man may by his skill in Scripture, or any other pretence reiect them. This done then speake of meeting with Catholikes in a Generall Councell: Otherwise Catholikes by meeting with you, are sure to gayne no peace and vnity except they yield vnto you; &amp; besides by the very yielding to meete with you they must for euer renounce the infallibility of Councells, such a diuine stay of peace and vnity in the Church. That this perpetuall renuntiation vnto Coūcells must be made by meeting with you, is cleere. For by admitting you who question the authority of Councells, into their Councells, they must admit that it is at least questionable, among Christians, whether such Councells be infallibly assisted by Gods holy spirit, or not, els they cannot meet with you, but must fly from you as damned heretikes. If they admit the infallibility of Councells to be questionable, they must bid this infallibility farewell for euer, it can neuer be established by any ensuing consent of Generall Councels. For if a Generall Councell should define that Generall Councells are infallible, except we be sure aforehand that Councells are infallible we may doubt whether that Councell doth not erre in defining that Councels are infallible. Wherefore this doctrine of the infallibility of lawfull Generall Councels is eyther to be abādoned for euer, togeather with the vnity of the Church that so much depends theron, or els it is to be held as a knowne perpetuall Christian Tradition, deliuered by full practise independently of the definition of any Councell, neuer permitting the same to examination; as one of those articles wherof Luther sayth comment. in Psalm. 82. fol. 546.

                     Fourthly, their denying the foundation

of true This is the most essentiall point of Protestancy which they tearme the foundation of foundations &amp; the pith &amp; marrow of the Gospell. See the booke de Essentia Protestantism. lib. 1. c. 6 This their doctrin cōsists in foure points. First that euery man is iustifyed by the iustice of Christ, by being as it were vested therewith. Secondly, this Iustice of Christ is formally imputed vnto euery man, not throgh repentance and mortification, but through Fayth only. Thirdly, that this fayth is not the dogmaticall or historicall fayth, whereby we belieue in generall the wordes of Christ and reuealed misteryes of the Scripture, but a speciall fayth wherby a man doth firmely and infallibly perswade himselfe, that to him in particular the Iustice of Christ is imputed for the full remission of his sinnes. Fourthly, that he that hath not firme fayth that his sinnes are remitted vnto him by the imputation of Christs merits, hath not Iustifying fayth, nor is iust in the sight of God, but as good as an Infidell, though he haue historicall fayth that all the doctrins of Christian Religion are true. Hence you may perceyue, that our Minister is a man of no fayth, who not only denyes this article of Protestancy, not only sayes that they neyther now hold or euer held it, but also reuileth the Iesuite, charging him with Lying, with Calumniation, with Deprauing and falsifying their Protestant doctrine, and that he wanted matter to fraught his papers when he charged their Church with teaching Iustification by this speciall Fayth. pag. 163. yea on the contrary side he sayth, that Protestants hold these foure points. First, that a Christian of a contrite spirit belieuing that his sinnes are remissible, receaueth forgiuenes though he want fayth, and perswasion in himselfe that his sinnes are remitted to him in particular by the imputation of Christs merit. pag. 166. lin. 6. &amp; seq. Secondly, that Protestants hold no man is iustifyed by only fayth, or by only belieuing himselfe to be iust, and his sinnes forgiuen by the imputation of the Iustice of Christ, but he must be iust before he can, or ought to belieue himselfe to be so. pag. 62. lin. 8. Thirdly, that the promise of remission of sinnes is conditionall, requiring of sinners not fayth only, but also the forsaking of sinne and doing good works. Esa. 1.16.17.18. and that this promise becomes not absolute, till the conditions be fulfilled. pag. 166. lin. 12. Fourthly, that Iustifying fayth is the Christian Catholike Dogmaticall fayth, wherby we belieue the hystories of Scripture and mysteries of our Religion. ibid. pag. 161. lin. 5. Wherfore he sayth that the difference betwixt Protestants and vs Catholikes, is only in two points. First, that they require not only dogmaticall fayth, but also that this be a Fiduciall assent, that is, ioyned with Hope pag. 163. lin. 1. But we forsooth hold Iustification by dogmaticall fayth only, and by such fayth as is in Diuells, and do not require that the dogmatical or intellectual assent be also fiducial, that is, ioined with Hope. pag. 168. lin. 2. Secondly, that we hold that a man cannot be certayne by fayth that he is iust: but Protestants hold the contrary; yet he sayth pag. 167. lin. 20. that there is very small difference, if any at all, betwixt them &amp; vs herein, because they do not hold this their assurance that they are iust, to be equall in the firmity of assent, to the assurance of Dogmaticall fayth which they haue about the common obiect of fayth. Thus the Minister: whome I leaue to the censure of Protestants, with no little wonder they can indure him to write in this sort, and thus openly to disclaime &amp; shew himselfe ashamed of the very Essence of their Religiō. What is certayne amongst Protestants, if this may be denyed? Howsoeuer I conclude this point with this syllogisme against them. Protestants, euen by the tacite concession of this their Aduocate hold fundamentall and damnable heresy, as certainly as it is certaine that they hold Iustification, not by common Dogmaticall fayth, but by speciall fayth only, whereby one apprehends the Iustice of Christ and vesteth himselfe therewith, belieuing in particular his sinnes to be forgiuen, and himselfe to be iust in Gods sight by the imputation thereof vnto him through this his fayth. But that Protestants hold this as a most fundamentall article of their Religion, is as certaine as it is certayne that there is, or euer was Protestant in the world; Wherin I appeale to the Iudgement of all learned Protestants, and to these their bookes, Luther Epist. ad Galat. Caluin. lib. 3. Institut. lib. 11. Melancthon in coll. comm. Kemnit. Exam. Trid. 1. p. Iohn White (our Ministers Brother) Desence. pa. 188.189. &amp; seq. and to the conscience of euery Protestant; yea this is the eleauenth article of the English Church, That a man is accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of Christ Iesus by faith. And it is wholsome doctrine (say they) that we are iustifyed by this fayth. Iustification, which is the one, Catholike, Christian fayth, about reuealed misteryes, bringing in a phantastical fayth, pretending that euery man is Iustifyed by belieuing himselfe in particular to be iust, or one of Gods elect.
                     
                     
                        Fiftly, their extenuating the value of the price of our Redemption, not making it sufficient to giue The Minister being ashamed of his Religion, doth here also contest that Protestāts teach the merit of workes: He sayth indeed in words they teach only the merit of Congruity, but in sense he makes them to teach merit of condignity, as much as any Catholike doth, as is after proued in the 8. point. inward sanctity &amp; purity to mens soules, nor to rayse the workes of Gods children to a due perfection with their reward.
                     Sixtly, their Errours agaynst Baptisme, the gate and entrance into Christian life, whereof they deny the vertue to sanctify men, &amp; the To discouer the vanity of the Minister, who sayth that the Protestant doctrine about Baptisme is held by our Schoolemen. Note, that concerning the necessity of Baptisme there be three errours, the one greater then the other. The first, that though Baptisme be the only ordinary meanes of saluation, yet some children dying without Baptisme are saued by extraordinary fauour, as S. Iohn was sanctifyed in the wombe. Luc. 1.2.53. This is held by some Catholikes, but no fundamentall errour, because it affirmes not any extraordinary fauour but such as by the word of God we know may be graunted, only it doth rashly apply Gods extraordinary fauours to persons without sufficient warrant. The second errour is, that though Baptisme be the ordinary meanes of saluation for Infants, yet in defect therof there is also another ordinary meanes for their saluation, to wit the fayth of their Parents. This errour is grosse, because it presumes without the word of God written or vnwritten, to appoint an ordinary meanes of saluation for Infants. This doctrine is taught by Protestants, but no Catholike holds it: Caietan once held it with submission vnto the Church, which hath razed it out of his bookes. The third errour is, that the children of faythfull Parents are iustifyed by the promise made to their seed, and are Gods adopted children before they be borne, so that Baptisme doth not truly regenerate them, &amp; make them Gods children, but is sayd to regenerate and adopt, because it is a seale and signe of this grace of adoption, which children had before Baptisme, yea brought with them into the world. This errour is fundamentall and damnable, which Protestants hold, and will hold in despite of their Church, and yet dares she not say they are not her children. Caluin de vera Eccles. reform. inter eius opuscula fol. 759. writeth: The Issue of the faythfull is borne into the world holy and sanctifyed, because their children being yet in the wōbe before they draw breath, be adopted into the couenant of eternall life. For it is necessary that the grace of adoption go before baptisme, which grace is not the cause of halfe-saluation, but bringeth perfect and full saluation, which is afterward signed by Baptisme. Thus Caluin. What the Minister brings out of the sayd Caluin to proue he held that Baptisme doth truly sanctify, to wit, that children are regenerated by Baptisme, is idle. For vnto it Caluin himselfe hath made answere, l. 4. Institut. c. 15. §. 2. When (sayth he) Baptisme is sayd to regenerate, to renew, to sanctify, to saue men, the meaning is not, that our purgation &amp; saluation is made by water, or that water hath vertue to purify, to regenerate, to renew, but only because by that signe we conceyue knowledge and certitude of such gifts; for what is giuen by the message of the Ghospell, is signed and sealed by Baptisme. Heere also I conclude, that eyther the Minister and his Church erres fundamentally, or at least they must grant foure thinges. First, that Caluin and his part erre fundamentally. Secondly; that Culuinists cannot be saued except they repent themselues of their Religion. Thirdly, that amongst Protestants there is dissention about fundamentall matters. Fourthly, that the Protestants do not exclude from their communion such as hold substantiall Heresy. necessity thereof for Infants, to whom they grant saluation without Baptisme.
                     
                     
                        Seauenthly, their Errour agaynst the The Minister sayth that Protestants only deny the manner of the Reall Presence, to wit Trāsubstantiation, not the substance thereof, because they hold that the body of Christ is truly, really, and effectually present to the worthy Receauer, but present by the apprehension of the soule, and by operatiue fayth, pag. 178.179. &amp; seq. &amp; pag. 390. &amp; 395. I answere, that as the Answerer sayd, this Presence by fayth is not Reall, nor true but only pious Imagination at the most, as is proued in the sixt Poynt. Reall presence which they deny, or else the mayne article of the Creed, that Christ is still in heauen at the right hand of his Father. For they will not allow a body in two places at once.
                     Eightly, their denying the Sacrament of The Minister pag. 189. sayth, that Protestants allow auricular Confession and Priestly Absolution, but deny it to be a Sacrament, or of necessity, in proofe whereof he citeth the Augustane Confession. Answer. If the Minister approue the Augustan confession, he must approue priestly absolution to be truly a Sacrament, and of necessity being commanded of God, euen as Baptisme is. For thus they write, Cap. de numero &amp; vsu Sacramentorum: The true Sacraments are Baptisme, the supper of the Lord, Absolution, which is the Sacrament of Pennance. For these rytes haue the same commandement of God, and promise of grace proper to the new Testament. Thus they: so euen by the Iudgement of this Confession, which they esteeme as containing the fundamē
                           tall doctrine of their Religion, our Minister and his Church erre fundamentally. Pennance, and Priestly Absolution, the necessary meanes for remission of sin, committed after Agaynst this Sacrament the Minister disputeth largely, but his arguments are triuiall, which he takes out of Bellarmine concealing the Solutions, which who will may there read in his first booke of the Sacrament of Pennance. What he brings out of some Catholike Authors, affirming that it is hard to prooue cleerly this Sacrament: the Answer is, That to proue the Sacrament of Pennance and the necessity thereof for sinnes after Baptisme by the perpetuall Tradition, and practise of the Church, is not hard, but easy, which you may see fully performed by Bellarmine; but to prooue the same by some text of Scripture so cleerly as some cauill may not be taken at the argument, this is difficill. And no wonder, seing our Minister pag. 541. lin. 9. doth graunt, that euen the Principall articles of Religion cannot be so prooued by Scripture, but seeming Solutions may be giuen. Baptisme.
                     
                        Ninthly, their denying the Catholike Church expresly set downe in the Creed, which of all other Articles is with Other articles are more necessary thē this, as sole obiects of necessary diuine affection, &amp; in this respect are more dangerously denyed: But as the meanes of knowing necessary obiects nothing more necessary then this true Church, nor any thing more euident, &amp; therefore the deniall thereof is most dangerous in respect of heresy; yea the Article, without resistance whereof no man can be Heretike. greatest danger denyed. For the standing out agaynst this, makes men heretikes, &amp; without erring agaynst this no man is guilty of heresy: whatsoeuer Doctour Field to the contrary sayth, that an Errant agaynst a fundamentall point is an Heretike though he erre without What the Minister sayth, that a man may be pertinacious &amp; obstinate against Scripture &amp; not against the Church is impossible. For eyther he seeth his doctrine to be agaynst Scripture or not, if he see his doctrine to be contrary to the Scripture &amp; yet holds it, he doth Iudge the Scripture not to be Christs nor of God, &amp; consequently he is pertinacious agaynst the Churches Tradition, which as hath been sayd, is the stay of our Fayth in this point. If he see not his exposition to be agaynst Scripture, but is deceyued by conference of places, he is not Heretike vntil knowing his exposition to be condemned by the Church he persist therein. For what is pertinacious wilfulnes, but to resist lawfull authority which we know to be agaynst vs? pertinacity, wherof he brings not any sillable of proofe; &amp; yet his doctrine is agaynst the whole Consent of Deuines, &amp; expresly agaynst S. Augustine who sayth, that a man holding with Photinus (whose Errors were fundamentall agaynst the Trinity &amp; God head of Christ) thinking he holdes Catholike doctrine, is

not yet an The Minister sayth pa. 196. that the IESVITE cites not Augustine truly, for he ōly saith, I would not affirme of such a person, that he is an Heretique. Answere. This is vntruth. S. Austine saith, Istum nondum haereticū dico, I do affirme this mā not to be yet an Heretique, though he hold fundamentall errour, till he knowe he dothe it agaynst the Catholike CHVRCH. What he addeth that S. Austine meanes, that ignorance is not heresy in foro Ecclesiae, but is heresy in foro caeli, is ridiculous; for the contrary is true, because whosoeuer denyes though ignorātly the knowne articles of the Creed, is an heretike in foro Ecclesiae, because he is presumed to erre out of contempt, not out of ignorance. But if he be truly ignorant he is no heretike in foro caeli, because verily he is not willfull. Heretike, till warned that he holds agaynst the Catholike Church, he chooseth to perseuer in his errour.
                     Hence I inferre, that Protestants erre fundamentally (according to the second kind of erring, to wit in the manner) in all points they hold agaynst the Roman Church, which I haued proued to be the true Catholike Church. For he that holds any priuate opinions so stifly, as rather thē forsake it he denies &amp; abandons the Catholike Church, a mayne article of his Creed, erreth fundamētally, as is cleere. But Protestants hold their priuate opinions so stiffely as therupon they haue denyed and abandoned the Catholike Church, to wit, the Roman. Neyther doth it import that they retayne the word, hauing reiected the sense, seeing not the letter of the Creed pronounced but the matter belieued makes men Christians. Neyther is it inough to say, that they belieue the Church of the Elect, seeing the Church of the Creed is not the Church of the only Elect (a meere Fancy), but the visible and conspicuous Church, continuing from the Apostles, by succession of Bishops, which thus I prooue.
                     The Church whereof Christ sayd, I am alwayes

with you to the consummation of the world, is the Church of the Creed, or the Church which to forsake is damnable. For the Church wherewith Christ still abideth, not according to corporall &amp; visible presence, but by his spirit, is the body of Christ whereof he is head, into which he infuseth the life of grace, &amp; consequently he that forsaketh this Church, forsaketh the body of Christ, and the head thereof, and cannot liue by his spirit, but is in a dead and damnable state, as a member cut off and separated from a liuing body, as S. Augustine epist. 50. &amp; de vnit. Eccles. c. 16. long agoe noted; The Catholike Church is the body of Christ, whereof he is head; out of this body the Holy Ghost quickeneth no man. Now the Church wherof Christ sayd, I am alwayes with you to the consummation of the world, is not the Church inuisible of only the Elect, but a visible Church deriued by succession from the Apostles. Therfore he that forsakes the Church deriued by succession from the Apostles, forsakes the Church of the Creed, the Catholike Church, the body of Christ, &amp; puts himselfe into a dead &amp; damnable state, &amp; may haue all things besides saluation and eternall life, as Fathers affirme, whose testimonies in this behalf are notable and famously knowne; whereunto D. Field yieldeth, acknowleging one, holy, Catholike Church in which only the light of heauenly Truth is to be sought, where only grace, mercy, remission of sinnes, and hope of eternall happynes are found.
                  
               
               
                  
                  AN ANSVVERE TO THE Nyne Points, proposed by your most Excellent Maiesty.
                  
                     I Haue bene large in my former proofes, that the Roman is the, one, holy true, catholike church, whose Traditions comming downe by perpetuall succession from Christ and his holy Apostles, are so constantly and strongly to be belieued, that no proofes out of Scripture (by priuate interpretatiō vnderstood) though seeming most euident, may stand to contest The Minister here spends a whole leafe of Paper in bitternes &amp; gall against vs, as if we did professe to preferre Old Custome, before knowne Verity. It is not so, but thus the case standeth between Protestants and vs. First as for Verity neither they nor we know our Religion to be verity by manifest sight, nor by the light, lustre, &amp; euidence of the thinge or doctrine, as both of vs must acknowledge if we be sober. Secondly there be records which by Tradition we know to haue bene giuen by the Apostles, which vpon good warrant are belieued to deliuer nothing but Gods holy word. Thirdly, when Controuersies arise about this word of the Apostles, and there be different opinions about the sense therof, &amp; seeming arguments be brought on both sides, we thinke that side ought to preuaile as the truly Christian, for which perpetuall Christian Tradition &amp; Custome stand. Fourtly, we Iudge that that side ought to be reiected as not truly Christian, where Christian Tradition is so notoriosly defectiue as they cānot ascend from this age vpward towards Christ by naming professours of their Religion, higher then one hundred yeares; or if they presume to passe further, they are presently conuinced to feigne, as it happeneth vnto Protestants. This is the summe of all that hath been hitherto sayd, and the forme of the Catholicke proceeding about their resolution of fayth. against thē. And this I haue not done without purpose, assuring my selfe, that if your Maiestie were throughly perswaded in this point, you would without any mans help, most easily and fully satisfy your selfe in particular controuersyes,

out of your owne wisdome and learning. For as some that haue bene present at your Maiesties discourses casually incident about Religion, report; few of our Deuines (though trained vp continually in Academies, and Exercises of Theology) are able to say more thē your Maiesty in defence of the catholicke cause for particular controuersyes, when you please to vndertake the patronage thereof: which I can easily belieue out of my owne Experience, who could not but admire, seing your Maiesty so well acquainted with our doctrines, and so ready and prompt in Scholasticall subtilities.
                  Wherfore most humbly I beseech your most Excellent Maiesty to honour these my poore labours with a gratious perusall of them, accepting of mine Answers whē they may seeme reasonable, being in defence of doctrines receiued from Auncestors, which deserue approbation when there is no euidency against them; and of your abundant clemency pardon my prolixity, seeing the questions by your Maiesty proposed, were so difficill and obscure, as I could hardly haue made any shorter full explication of them.
                  
                     
                     THE FIRST POINT. The 
                           The Minister in this question knowes not well what to stand vnto. He graunts the question, and then he denyes it agayne contradicting himselfe, yea censuring his owne whole discourse as impertinent. This I demonstrate out of his owne wordes. First pa. 242. he sayth, that the question is not about Diuine and Religious worship of Images, but about any kind of reall worship. These be his very wordes. The question whether Images be to be adored with diuine worship, or not, is Heterogeneous, that is, impertinent to this disputation. It is sufficient that Papists adore and worship Images with some kind of Reall worship, such as the Trident Councell expressely defineth. Thus he there, professing that to impugne Iconolatry, or diuine worship of images, is impertinent. And yet in the beginning of this disputation he professeth contrarywise to impugne this only Adoration, &amp; not euery kind of worship of Images. Thus he writes pag. 212. The Aduocate of Images should first of all haue declared what he vnderstandeth by worship of Images, whether Veneration only, or Adoration properly so called. Veneration signifies externall reuerence &amp; regard of pictures, such as is giuen to Churches Communion-Tables and sacred vessels; And according to this notion many haue approued worspippe of Images that deny adoration. Adoration properly so taken, is yelding of honour by Religious submission of soule &amp; body &amp;c. the worshipping of Images in this māner is superstition. Thus the Minister. Who to proue that Protestants allow veneration or externall worshippe of Images, in his margent citeth Iunius against Bellarmine, professing in the name of all Protestants; None of vs say, Images are not to be worshipped, much lesse do we say, that they are no waies to be worshipped. WE ALLOW, that they be worshipped in their kind as Images,  but not with Religious worshippe. Behold how cleerly he grants the question in hand, euen asmuch as the answerer intended to proue. For what the Minister sayth, that the Answerer doth not declare what he vnderstādeth by worshippe, whether externall Veneration or internall Adoration, is false. For he often and cleerly affirmeth, that the worship he meanes to proue to be due vnto the Image of our Sauiour, is the externall regard &amp; the reuerence of bowing, such as is vsed towards Aultars and Communion tables out of inward religions reuerence and deuotion vnto Christ. This the Answerer did set down presently in the beginning of his discourse about images, and repeates the same almost in euery paragraffe. See his text in the Ministers booke pag. 214. Outwardly to the Image, inwardly to Christ. pag. 206. Externally to the Image, by mentall affection vnto the person. pa. 827. Outwardly to the Image, by deuout and pious Imagination to the person, and the like very often.
                           Nor is the Ministers insinuation true, that the Councell of Trent doth define the worshippe of Images vnder the tearmes of Religious Adoration. First, the Councell nether vseth the tearme Religious, nor Adoratiō; but Veneration, the tearme, the very word allowed by the Minister. Secondly, the Councell declares, that this Veneration is outward regard, as kneeling, bowing the body, vncouering the head, done before the Images of our Sauiour, to the end we may adore him, that is, testify our inward supreme deuotion towards him. Finally, it is false that Adoration doth properly signify Diuine &amp; Religious worship, seing properly according to the common acception of the word in Scripture, it signifyes any bowing of the body in signe of reuerence; as might be proued by more then an hūdred examples of Scripture where creatures are said to be adored. The Fathers sometimes take the word Adore in the more principall sense, and 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                               only for diuine worshippe. In which sense they say only God is adored. Epiphan. haeres. 79. Sit in honore Maria, Deus adoretur. Hieronymus Ep. 53. Non Angelos vel aliquam creaturam adoramus. Yet also the same Fathers take the word in the proper sense, &amp; say, that other things besides God are adored as Men. Augustine de ciuit l. 10. c. 4. Homines si mullum illis addatur etiam adorandi. Men are to be honored, &amp; when much adored. S. Hierome Epist. 17. Baptistae cineres adorare, to ADORE the Ashes of S. Iohn. The holy Crosse. Cyrill. Alexandrin. homil. de Deipara in Concil. Ephesin. Crux adoratur toto orbe terrarum. Holy Images· Damascen. lib. 4. Orthod. fidei c. 7. Saluatoris &amp;c. Imagines adoramus. we adore the images of our Lord. Hence it is euident, that our Minister on the one side witnessing out of Iunius, that all Protestants allow  some kind of worship vnto Images, to wit, veneration &amp; externall worship; and on the other professing to impugne the Religious adoration of images only, hath yeelded the question in controuersy, &amp; his disputation against Iconolatry is, according to his owne doome and word, Heretogeneous, that is, impertinent, and in the ayre.
                         
                         VVorshippe of Images.
                     
                        I Haue more hope to giue your Maiesty satisfaction in this article because all kind of Theologicall proofes stand for the same, and nothing against it as I am perswaded, which I declare by this discourse.
                     
                        If the custome of worshipping Images be grounded on the prime principles of nature &amp; christianity; If the same hath bene receiued in the church Vniuersally, without any knowne time of beginning; If places of Scripture that Protestants vrge against vs, make asmuch against their custome of making Images, so that with no probability, or ingenuity they therupon mislike vs; If by the vse of Images there be no danger or hurt to ignorāt people, which may not with very ordinary diligence of pastors &amp; teachers be preuented, &amp; otherwise the vtilityes very great; Then there is no reason of iust mislike of this custome. But this supposition is true, &amp; in the same order I will endeauour to shew in the foure Particulars.
                     
                        Worshippe of Images consequent out of the principles of Nature and Christianity. §. 1.
                        AN Image 
                              This description of an Image sheweth the differēce of proper Images of our Sauiour frō types and figures. By declaration wherof the cheife part of the Ministers disputation will be answered, which is grounded vpon confusion of these two different things. The proper Image represents the person of our Sauiour, according to the true and proper shape of his kind, and some indiuiduall propertyes that agree to him only. Such is the Image of a man crucified, pourtrayted accordinge to speciall circumstances recorded in the gospell. A figure represents his person in the shape of some creature dissonant from his forme &amp; kind whose corporall proprieties haue resemblance with our Sauiours morall and spirituall perfections. Thus the Lyon and Lambe be types or metaphoricall Images of our Sauiour, which resemble him not in corporall shape, but in his heauenly perfections, his mildnes being figured by the Lambe, his fortitude by the Lyon.
                              From this fundamentall difference other three flow. First, the proper Image represents to mans Imagination, making him to apprehend by Imagination the person, or the samplar, as really present before his eies. The figure represents to mans vnderstanding, which apprehends by reason the analogy or proportion which the corporall qualityes of the figure haue with the morall propertyes, and perfections of the thing figured. Secondly, vpon sight of the proper Image, straight a mentall imagination of the person resultes in one that knoweth him, especially when the knowledge is ioyned with affection; and this is done so presently, that ocular aspect of the Image, and mentall Imagination of the person seeme to be one and the same act; But vpon sight of the figure, the apprehension of the thinge figured, doth not instantly follow, but is leasurely caused by discourse, comparing the one with the other.
                              Thirdly, hence the proper Image is taken for the prototype, that what is done to the Image by way of outward honour or dishonour, the same is, &amp; ought to be taken as done to the person, and this by the naturall force of Imagination, and by natures institution in this matter, without any positiue ordinance. The figure is not so taken without some positiue ordinance or custome. For example: If a Iew teare in peeces the Image of our Sauiour by way of despite, that is done, and to be taken as done mentally, and by affection to our Sauiour; but if he tread vnder foote bread and wine, that is not to be taken as done in disgrace of our Sauiours body and bloud, wherof bread and wine be types and figures, except that bread and wine be sanctified to represent his body &amp; bloud.
                            is a distinct and liuely portrayture of some visible and corporall thinge, parts of the Image corresponding

to the parts of the thinge represented, more or lesse particularly, according as the Image is more or lesse distinct and liuely.
                        The office of an Image is to carry the Imagination of the beholders therof directly, and immediatly to the person Imagined therin, imagination of parts in the

person represēted, answering to the parts seen in the Image; which kind and vse of Images Nature allowes vnto men, to the end they may remember, and more liuely imagine persons absent &amp; remoued from their corporall sight, vpon whom they ought, and haue great desire liuely and stayedly to fix their Imaginations, and Thoughts.
                        
                           The first Argument.
                           Hence ariseth the allowed Principle of Nature, receiued by all Nations, Ciuill and Barbarous, Ita vt in eo, to speake with S. Augustine, nulla doctorum paucitas, nulla indoctorum turba dissentiat: That the Image may and ought to stand for the prototype, and is by Imagination to be taken as it were the very person. And The Minister pag. 214. sayth; This axione is not true of all Images, but onely of such Images as are by ciuill or diuine ordinance appointed to stand for the Prototype. This he proues by the examples of the brasen Serpēt, Paschall Lambe, Golden CHERVBIMS, which might not be adored, thogh Images of Christ; yea Ezechias defaced the Image, that is, the brasē serpēt, yet adored the Prototype Christ. Answer. These examples are impertinent. The brasen Serpent, and the Paschall Lambe were types and figures of our Lord; which we grant by the meere natiue force of Imagination, without positiue ordinance, do not necessarily stand for the thing figured; yea the Iewes, at the least the vulgar, did not vnderstand that the brasen serpent was a type of the Messias, nor can it be proued that Ezechias himselfe so vnderstood it. The question is of proper Images of our Sauiour: These we say stand for the prototype inuiolably by the law of nature, that honour done, or denyed outwardly to the Image, is done or denyed mentally to the person, and ought so to be taken. The Minister if he will speake to the purpose, must bring some examples where the proper Image may be disgraced, without dishonour done to the Prototype; which he will neuer find. For euen Ezechias when he brake in peeces the brasen serpent, did therein dishonour the proper prototype therof, to wit, the true serpent, of which the brasen was the direct &amp; proper Image, and of which he shewed contempt, in respect of being adored of men, by tearing in peeces the Image, because it was adored with reference vnto it, as Heathens worshipped the Images of Serpents and Calues. The truth of this difference between an image &amp; figure, may be made euident vnto the Minister by this familiar example. If his wife be found beholding and kissing his Image, that is set in the frontispice of his Reply, with verses in praise of his sweet &amp; gracious face; ought not this to be taken as done mentally to his person? And were not the contrary to wronge her? yet there is no ciuill Ordinance, nor Parlament law that this his Image stand for him. On the other side, if she be found kissing &amp; making much of her little dogge, though that be the type of a preaching Minister; must that be taken as done vnto him? No verily. It is then cleere, that there is difference betwixt figures and proper Images, in respect of standing for the prototype. Hence this principle, Honour &amp; Dishonour done, or denyed outwardly to the proper Image, is done, or denyed mentally to the person, cannot be proued euer to faile: nor can our Minister shew by the word of God, that any proper Image of an adored person, was euer lawfully made, and not lawfully adored. what we outwardly do to the Image, is done by Imagination to the person. And when we kisse the hands and feete of the Image, in our Imagination we kisse the hands and

feet of the person inwardly Imagined by his Image. This is the Axiome of Philosophy gathered out of Aristotle: Idem est motus in Imaginem &amp; Exemplar. For motion proceeding from the body &amp; mind, what the body doth really and externally to the Image, the mind doth Imaginarily, that is, by conceite &amp; affection, to the This is then the first argument for the worshippe of our Sauiours Image which may be thus sūmed. The proper Image, so stands for the Prototype, that what is done by way of outward honour to the Image, is done by affection to the person; &amp; whosoeuer denyes outwardly Reuerence to the Image, is to be taken as denying mentally Reuerence to the person. But our Sauiour is worthy of all worship, so that it is impious to deny any worship vnto him. Therfore (supposing what Protestants grant, that the Image of our Sauiour is lawfully made) it is impious to deny outward Reuerence vnto it. person.
                        
                        
                           
                           The second Argument.
                           This Axione of Philosophy, that no man thinke it disauowed in Theology, the ancient Fathers vniformely teach as a prime truth euident in reason. S. Damascene l. 4. c. 12. S. Augustine de doct. Christ. c. 9. S. Ambrose de Dom. Incarn. Sacrament. c. 7. S. Basill de Spiritu sancto. c. 18. S. Athanasius Serm. contra Arianos, 
                              The Minister pag. 229. lin. 24. answereth to these testimonyes of the Fathers in this sort: Damascene is not Ancient, nor Orthodoxal in al points: for as Cardinall Bellarmine saith de Scriptor. Eccles. pag. 269. he denied the procession of the holy Ghost from the Sonne. S. Augustine speaketh of signes that haue diuine Institution. S. Ambrose of Christs Passion, and not of pictures. S. Basill and Athanasius speake by way of similitude only of the Image of kings. Where is now the vniforme consent of Fathers? Answere. First, S. Athanasius, though he speake particularly of the kings Image, yet his reason is the same in all the proper Images of any adored person. For his reason why the kings Image must be adored, is because the Image of the king may (not by corporal speach but by the euidence of the thing) truly say, I and the king who is adored, be one; but this the proper Image of any adored person may truly say aswell as the kings. For example, suppose that were true which our Minister sayth. pag. 224. lin. 21. that Ministers haue such vnion with God, as they are to be adored with Religious adoration, why may not the Image of our Adored Minister which is set in the front of this Reply say, I &amp; the Minister are one, he is in me, &amp; I in him, he that adoreth me, adoreth him, and who disgraceth me, disgraceth him aswell as the kings? And if the Ministers Image may truly affirme, I &amp; an adored person are one, why may not also the Image of our Sauiour, (who is a person more to be adored thē any Minister) say the same? S. Basill speakes not particularly of the kings Image, but sayth vniuersally, that honour done to the Image, is done and referred to the person, and thence concludes in particular, that it is so in the adoration of the king &amp; his Image, so that there are not two adorations, but one, which being done outwardly to the Image, is referred and taken, as referred mentally to the kinge. It is true, S. Ambrose speakes of the Image and Crosse of Christ. That he meaneth not the materiall Crosse but the Passiō, the Minister doth say, but he cannot proue it, seing S. Ambros. orat. in Theodos. sayth expressely, that the Crosse is adored, and in his dayes the holy wood of the Crosse was publikely proposed to be adored, as sayth S. Paulinus Epist. 11. ad Seuerum. S. Augustine sayth l. 1. de doctrin. Christian. c. 25. that such Images are not idle inuentions of men which are proposed by lawfull authority; but such be the Images of Christ and his Saints euer vsed by the Christian Church. Wherfore those Images haue diuine Institution, mediate at least, and so by S. Augustines rule, the worship of them is pious, as being not so much worship of them, as the worship of Christ &amp; his saints▪ 
                                 S. Damascen liued nine ages agoe, &amp; so was by an hundred yeares neerer vnto Christ then vnto vs, how then is he not ancient? What you say, that according to Bellarmine he was not Orthodoxe, but denyed the procession of the Holy Ghost from God the Sonne, you wronge both Bellarmine and him. For Bellarmine l. 1. de Christo c. 27. not only affirmes, but proues that S. Damascene held the procession of the holy Ghost from the Sonne, quoad rem, as for the matter, though he allowed not the forme of speach, procedit ex filio, because it was vsed by Heretiks in a false sense, as though the sonne onely had bene the immediate origen of the holy Ghost, and not also the Father. And this is all Bellarmine sayth in libro de Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis; nor doth Bellarmine say, that Damascene denyed the procession of the holy Ghost from the Son, though your put these downe in a distinct letter, as Bellarmines very words. This is false play. who thus writes: An Image of the Kinge is nothing else but the forme &amp; shape of the King, which could it speak, would, and might truly say, I and the king are one, the king is in me, and I in him, so that who adoreth me his Image, doth therein adore the very King. Thus he: shewing that the kings Image, is to be imagined, and by Imagination to be conceaued as the very king.
                        
                        
                           
                           The third Argument.
                           This Principle, that Images by Imagination must stand for their Prototype, and what is done by way of honour vnto the Image is done mentally to the person, is canonized by the holy Scripture, &amp; we warranted to conclude by the light therof

our obligations of worship. God in the old Testament appointed, that the Tabernacle should be taken, by Imagination, as his House, The Propitiatory as his Seat, The Arke as his Footstole, and so he Imagined there presēt as sitting with his feet on the Arke. This ordination supposed, the Prophet Dauid Psalme 99.5. argueth, that we are bound to adore the Arke that represents God, as his footestole, saying: Adore his footstoole, because he is holy. As if he had said, God being holy, and most highly to be adored, makes the thing holy and venerable, that hath the office to represent him, as if he were corporally presēt before our eyes. The Arke hath the office of his footstoole▪ and to represent him as by Imagination present with his feet vpon it. Therfore adore the Arke, Adore this his footstoole, because he is 
                              Vnto this text the Minister pag. 260. frameth two Answeres: first, that the 
                                       •
                                    sraelites did not adore the materiall Arke, but God hims
                                       •
                                    lfe before the Arke. In proofe hereof he bringes 1. Sam. 1.19. where is sayd of Elcana and his wife, They rose in the morning early &amp; worshipped before the Lord. Answere. This text sheweth the contrary that they adored the Arke before the Lord, that is, in his presence bowing outwardly to the Arke, by inward affection vnto the Lord Imagined as there present, according to the word of the Prophet, Adore his foostoole. Secondly, the Minister answereth, that the Arke was adored by Gods speciall commandement (and so are not Images) citing to this purpose the foresayd verse of this Psalm, Adore his footstoole for he is holy. This is friuolous. For the Prophet doth not say that there is any speciall cō
                                 mandement to adore the Arke (for then he would haue said, Adore the Arke, because God so commandes) but he shewes, what was due in reason vnto the Arke, in regard it was to be considered as an Image of the Holy of holyes, imagined as sitting with his feet vpō it, saying, adore his fotstole, because he is holy, not because there is a speciall positiue precept so to doe (for no such precept is found in Scripture,) but because this is consequent out of the principles of the law of Nature; for that reason teacheth that the sanctity of God, makes any thing that must in speciall sort stand for him, euē his footstoole, venerable, and so to be bowed vnto, in respect of the Holy of Holyes imagined as sitting vpon it. As when Dauid sayth, prayse the Lord because he is good. Psa. 117. he deliuers not a positiue, but shewes that it is essentiall duty vnto God in respect of his Goodnes: so likwise the Prophet saying, adore his footestoole because he his Holy, doth shew what is due vnto God essentially in respect of his holynes, to wit, that that which represents him to the imagination, as if he were corporally present, be holy, and adored for his sake. 
                              holy. Where note that the obligation to take the Arke as an Image of God sitting vpon it, is a positiue ordinance, the Arke not binding men so to do of his owne nature, not being a proper Image of God; yet this positiue institution supposed, the Law of nature binds men to worship &amp; adore the Arke with reference vnto the holy adored person, imagined as sitting theron.
                        
                        
                           The fourth Argument.
                           With this Principle so receiued in nature we must ioyne another nolesse knowne

and notorious in Christianity, to wit, that God full of all honour and glory, to whom all adoration &amp; worship is due, became truely and verily Man, as visible and aspectable as any other man, and consequently as Imaginable, that he may be figured by an Image, no lesse truly and distinctly then another man. In which Image the hands, feete &amp; other parts shall truly by Imagination correspond to the feete, hands, and parts of the prototype, and our Imagination from it passe directly and immediatly vnto Christ, and his parts, proportionable to those we behold in the Image: so that when we adore with an humble outward kisse of hands and feete the Image, by inward Imagination, Conceite, and Affection we kisse &amp; adore the Imagined true hands, and feet of Christ. Neither are these Imaginations false and erroneous, seing (as Philosophy teacheth) no falshood is in meere apprehension or Imagination, without iudging the thing to be as we Imagine. As in contemplation men represent and imagine themselues as standing before Gods throne in the Court of heauen amidst the quires of Saints and Angels, praising &amp; honouring him in their

To which kind of Imaginations, as pious and goodly, the Scriptures and Fathers exhort vs. In this sort beholding the Image of Christ▪ we apprehend The Minister obiects pa. 223. lin. 16. one may imagin the sunne, or a lambe to be the figure of Christ, &amp; conceaue them as his Image, and yet it is not lawfull by one and the same affection to worship these Creatures with their Creatour. I Answere. This hath bene refuted already. For these creatures be but types and figures of our Sauiour, which types and figures haue no right in nature with out positiue institution to bind mens Imaginations to conceaue by them our Sauiour as if he were present, nor consequently to Imagine, what is done vnto them, is done vnto him. But the proper Images of our Sauiour haue right in nature to bind mans Imaginations to conceaue our Sauiour in his Image as present in this sort. Wherfore he that will not conforme his Imagination to this pious institute of Nature, but will thinke he may deface the proper Image of his Lord, without iniury to his person, doth by that defacing commit impiety towards Christ, his Imaginations not hauing that rectitude towards so great a Lord, as naturall piety doth exact. For piety towardes our Lord requires of man, that his Imaginations be respectiue of euery thing, that hath by consent of men right of reference towards him. him as therin present, not iudging the Image to be Christ, but imagining, and taking it as if it were Christ. That when we outwardly honour the Image by kissing the hands &amp; feet therof, mentally by imagination and humble affection of reuerence, we adore and kisse the most venerable hands and feet of his pretious body.
                        
                        
                           The fifth Argument.
                           The Historyes of Christian Antiquity are full of holy Men, Bishops, Kings, Queenes, and other honourable Personages, who haue cast themselues downe on the ground, before Beggars, Lazars, and leapers, kissing their feet and their soares out of reuerent affection vnto Christ. In which kind, memorable is the charity of the famous Queene Matildes daughter of Edgar King of Scotland, and wife to Henry
                              
the first of England, whose custome was to wash with her owne hands, the feet of poore people, amongst whom were Leapers, and such as had loathsome diseases, not disdaining with great Reuerence on her knees to kisse their feet with her princely lips. And when as the Prince of Scotland her brother, being then in the Court of England entring into her chāber, found her imployed in so humble seruice, astonished thereat, rebuked her, saying: Sister what do you? can you with those your defiled lips kisse the king your husband? She answered: Know brother, that the feet of the King of heauen are more louely and venerable then are the lips of an Earthly king. Certainly this Queene with all other addicted to the like deuotion, when they kissed the feet of the poore outwardly with their lips, did by Imagination full of reuerent affection, kisse the feete of Christ Iesus, taking the poore as Images of 
                                 The Minister answereth this argument with a demand pag. 225. lin. 26. Where I pray you hath our Sauiour sayd of Images of wood and stone, nay of Puppets and pranked Babyes, what yee doe to one of these my least ones, yee doe vnto me, as he sayd of the poore? I answere. That the images of our Lord, stand for our Lord so, that what is done by way of honour, or dishonour vnto them, is to be taken as done vnto him, is euident in the light of nature, not only to learned men, but euē to women &amp; children; and none deny it but such in whome Passion agaynst truth hinders the right vse of common Reason. Hence there was no neede, that this truth should be expressely set downe in the Scripture, though the Scripture in some of her discourses doth intrinsēcally suppose the same; for the testimony, whereof we haue already spoken, Adore the footestoole of his feete, because he is holy, doth suppose that w

                                    at represents God vnto the imagination, as if he were visibly present, is to be worshipped for his sake.
                                 On the other side that what is done vnto poore beggars and lazars by way of reliefe and comfort, is to be taken as done vnto Christ, as he was once poore and needy for our sakes vpon earth, is not euident in the light of reason, nor can be knowne but by diuine Reuelation. Hence it was conuenient that the same should be often and expressely set downe in Scripture for the comfort and encouragement of Christians, the more to inflame them vnto Charitable workes. Where we may obserue, that the Word of God only sayth, that what is done to the poore by way of comfort and reliefe, is done vnto Christ, not what is done by way of honour, and yet Christian Charitable people haue not only releeued, but also reuerenced these poore people, in respect of this their reference vnto Christ. And how this? But by grounding themselues vpon this principle euident in the light of nature, Whatsoeuer is done by way of honor to the image of Christ Iesus, that is, vnto the thing which represents him vnto imagination, as if he were visibly present, is to be taken as done to his very person. Wherefore seing the poore by the ordinance of Gods word, stand for our Sauiour, and are his images, so that when we see them poore and needy, we must imagine we see him poore and needy; hence it is consequent that what is done vnto them, not only by way of releefe, but also by way of reuerence, is done vnto our Sauiour, and so they may be worshipped for his sake. As for the title of puppets and pranked Babyes, if the Minister thinke it a fine phrase, he may keep it to adorne therewith his owne Brats.

                           Out of this, the common Obiection

of Protestants, to wit, that the worship of Christs Image is no where found in Scripture, and therfore it is a Will-worship, may be answered; For as themselues confesse (see D. Field l. 4. c. 14.) many actions belong to Religion, wherof there is no expresse precept, nor any practise in Scripture, which proue the lawfulnes and necessity therof. There is no expresse precept

in Scripture to christen Infants nor is it there read, that euer any were Christened; yet because there be Testimonyes which ioined with reason, proue the lawfulnes &amp; necessity of this Baptisme, we may &amp; must vse it. In Scripture there is no expresse practise, nor precept of worshiping the Image of Christ, yet there be principles which (the light of nature supposed) conuince such Adoration to be lawfull &amp; necessary.
                        
                        
                           The sixt Argument.
                           Christ being true God, full of honour, to whom all supreme Adoration is due, doth, and must needes make honourable and adorable any thing that representeth him, that is, which must be taken by Imagination, as if it were his person. But supposing God to be truly Man (as faith teacheth) the light of nature sheweth, that his Image truly representeth him, that is, makes him present to the imagination of the beholders therof, and stands for him. Ergo, Christ Iesus his Image is for his sake Venerable &amp; Adorable as a thing standing for him, in such sort, that the honour done outwardly to it, is done, and ought to be taken as done (by deuout &amp; pious imagination) to his person. Whence further is concluded the necessity of this worship▪ For God Incarnate being most venerable and full of glory, requires of a Christian that, that which stāds for him, &amp; represēt
                                 •
                               him be honoured &amp; This Argument is grounded vpon this Principle of Scripture, that all kind of honour &amp; worship is due to the man Christ Iesus, which can be due vnto any other man whom we are bound to respect. But vnto other persons whom we are bound to respect, we owe reuerence in their Images more or lesse according to their dignity. And this duty is double, the one negatiue, neuer to disgrace their Images; the other affirmatiue which is actually to exhibite honour vnto their Images, whē otherwise the deniall therof will be taken as irreuerence &amp; cōtempt towards them. Therfore to the Image of Christ we owe this double duty of honor, negatiue, neuer to disgrace it, positiue, to reuerence the same outwardly, when otherwise the neglect of reuerence to his Image is, and ought to be taken as want of due reuerēce to his person. adored for his sake
                        
                        
                           
                           The Seauenth Argument.
                           If the honour due to a King be so great, that the same redoundes from his person to things about him, as to his Chayre of state (which is honoured with the like bowing and kneeling that is vsed to his person) &amp; to his Image vnto which whosoeuer offreth iniury is punishable, as offring iniury to the king himselfe; Shall not the honour due to Christ Iesus infinitely greater, so flow out of his person vnto things that belonge and concerne him, as to make his The Minister pag. 228. sayth this similitude halteth, because the kinges Chayre of state, &amp; his image whē it is honored or dishonored, are conioyned with his person by ciuil ordinance and relation. I Answere. This is a manifest falshood, for what law is in England that euery image of the king is to be taken as his person in respect of honour? There is no such law written with pen and inke, but only the law of nature written by the fingar of the Creatour in mens harts and obserued vniuersally in all nations by custome, that the proper image of a person is in respect of honour &amp; dishonour to be taken as the person. Image, Crosse, and such holy Monuments of his Passion and Life Venerable for his sake, and to be adored with bowing, kneeling, and other exteriour honour, as would be vsed to his person were he visibly present? not so, that the worship rest in the Image, but be referred by imagination and affection to the person imagined. But the Image of Christ being a true representation of God incarnate, &amp; able to conuey our Imagination directly &amp; truely towards him, corresponding very particularly vnto the parts of his sacred person, hath a right in reason, &amp; nature which cannot be taken from it, to represent him, and to stand in our imagination for him. Wherfore the Image of Christ hath a right, which without impiety cannot be denyed vnto it, to be honoured and outwardly adored for his sake,

by kneelings, bowings, imbracings, &amp; kissings referred in mind by deuout thoughts and affections to his person.
                        
                        
                           The eight Argument.
                           And this right is a The Minister here is hoat, and demands pag. 230. lin. 8. Hath a dead picture or worme-eatē statue greater dignity then the liuely Images of Christ, to wit, the saints that are on earth and excell in vertue? I Answere, that no: yet the Image of Christ hath a dignity which no other dumbe, dead, and senseles Creature (of which the Answerer heere speakes) can haue, to wit, to represent our Sauiour according to his true or proper humaine shape. Whēce it hath a right in nature to stand by imagination for our Sauiour, and to bind vs that our actions towards it be not respectles. dignity which an Image of Christ hath aboue other creatures, who though they be referred vnto God as vnto their Authour, yet God may not be honoured in them in that manner as Christ is honoured in his Image. The reason is, because creatures represent God their Authour so rudely, remotely, darkly imperfectly that onely spirituall men and Note agaynst the Ministers cauilling, that God may be two wayes knowne by visible creatures. First, only abstractiuely, to wit, that he is, and hath many diuine perfectiōs. In this māner Heathen Philosophers who were not perfect contemplants did by creatures know God. Secondly, in a kind of intuitiue and contemplatiue manner, which is, when presently vpon the sight of a creature we are moued with reuerence towards the Creatour, as if we saw him present therin. This presence of God perfect contemplants only arriue vnto, and vnto these men only the creatures serue as Images and mirrours of God. Such as are yet imperfect as they cannot thus presently behold the Godhead in his creatures, must helpe themselues with the sight of his sacred humanity, in the Images of the mysteries of his holy life. perfect Contemplants can readily acknowledg God in them, and so such men onely, and that only priuately to themselues, may worship God in, and by them, which is all that Vasquez (so much accused) doth teach. But as for publike &amp; promiscuous adoring of Creatures, he condemneth it, as vndecent and scandalous,

saying expressely, (l. 3. de adorat. c. 1.) that Indiscriminatim creaturas adorandas proponere, esset multis manifesta causa periculi. In which respect (S. Leo serm. 7. de Nat. Dom.) reprehends some Christians at Rome that bowed vnto the sunne, mentally referring that bowing vnto God the Authour therof, because Paynims seing that outward actiō of adoring, might imagine that Christians adored the Sunne in their superstitious māner, the relation which the Sunne hath to God as to his Creatour, not being euidēt vnto sight, nor by imagination apprehended. But the Image of Christ (as I sayd) is apparently so representatiue The Minister pag. 233. sayth, if he may speake his opinion, he seeth no reason why the Sunne, or an Asse may not stand in our Imaginations for God his maker, and we worship him referring the external bowing, and kissing of the Asse vnto God, euen aswell as the Image of Christ Iesus crucified may stand for him by imagination, and be bowed vnto, out of inward reuerence vnto him. Answere. This is spokē only in splēe against holy Imags, otherwise I cannot thinke the Minister can be so grosse of conceyt. For what Christian so wild and voyd of common sense as not to perceaue by the very instinct of nature a difference betwixt the Image of a crucifyed man, and the Asse, in respect of standing for our Sauiour? If an Asse may (as the Minister sayth) represent our Sauiour, and stand by Imaginatiō for him, &amp; be bowed vnto for his sake, as much as his crucified shape and picture in stone, wood, or paper, why may not an Asse (I pray yow) represent the Minister, &amp; stand in mens Imagination for him, aswell as the picture of a man in a Ministeriall weed set in the beginning of his booke? of Christ, that vpon sight therof our thoughts fly presently vnto him, and his picture is no sooner in our eyes, then his person by imagination in our mind. Neither is there any excellency appearing in the picture worthy to be adored, or sufficient to stay our thoughts and affections in it. So that no man can with any probability suspect that any reason besides reuerence to his Maiesty, makes vs bow our bodyes to his Image.
                        
                        
                           The ninth Argument.
                           Nor doth it folllow, that if we worshippe the Image of Christ and the crosse that he died on, that we should also adore Iudas his lips which touched our Sauiour his sacred mouth, when he gaue him that

traiterous kisse; For What the Minister hath sayd in answere of this argument, is shewed to be full of ignorance and folly, in the Censure Sect. 3. §. 7. it is easy to shew many maine differences betwixt Iudas his lips, and the Crosse. First, Iudas his lips were conioyned substantially with Iudas that none could bow or bend vnto them, or kisse them, without seeming to bow, &amp; to do honour vnto his person, in regard he being an intellectuall creature, was an obiect capable of veneration, terminated and stayed in his owne person. But the Crosse being a senseles thing, is not an obiect sufficient to stay veneration within it selfe, neither is it a part belōging to the substance of any wicked man that concurred vnto the punishing of our Sauiour, but rather was fixed vnto, and ioyned to his body, and so the outward bowing to the Crosse is done mentally, &amp; is taken as done onely vnto Christ, whom we behold as stretched theron.
                           Secondly, the Crosse, the Nayles, the Launce, &amp; other such instruments being senseles creatures, may be thought off as things sanctified by the touch of our Sauiours body, they not hauing any thing in them contrary to the sanctity of Christ, &amp; so could not hinder the conceipt of such imputed sanctity. But Iudas being most wicked and detestable, and full of the most horrible Treason that euer was, did so defile &amp; prophane his whole person, and all the parts therof, that the meere touch of our Sauiours most sacred mouth could not

sanctify, nor make holy vnto Christian Imagination, his lips, without changing and sanctifying his hart. For so long as he continueth without repenting his treason, the liuely remembrance of that execrable fact doth so possesse a Christian hart, as no respectfull thought to him can enter into it.
                           Finally, the passion of Christ may be considered two wayes. First, as proceeding from the will of wicked men, the Diuels instruments to torment him. In which cō
                              sideration, it is not gratefull vnto God, but a detestable sinne in the Authours therof. Secondly, it may be considered as receiued in the body of Christ, as abiding and continuing in his sacred person admitted into his hart, and The Minister his calumniation that the Iesuits, or Loyalists hold that the Crosse, and nayles were offered by Christ to his Father at his Passion, and the world redeemed with wood and yron, is discouered in the Censure Sect. 3. §. 5. togeather with the exorbitancy of his rayling. 
                              offred vnto his father for the sinnes of the world, and by this consideration it is sacred and venerable. The lips of Iudas betraying Christ, as the hands also of the wicked Minister that strucke him in Caiaphas his house, and other like instruments conioined with wicked persons, were instruments of Christs Passion, as it proceeded from their wicked harts, and consequently as it was a detestable action But the Crosse, the Nayles, and the Launce that stayed in, and were ioyned to the body of Christ, were Instruments of Christs Passion as it was lodged in his sacred person, and as offred to his heauenly Father, and consequently as of a

thing most highly venerable.
                           Out of all which I may conclude, that Christ Iesus being a true man, his Image hath a most euident and vndeniable right to represent him, &amp; so to be honoured for his sake.
                        
                     
                     
                        That this Worship was euer since the Apostles in the Church, without beginning. §. 2.
                        
                        THE disagreeing of Protestants about the time when worship of Images began, is a sufficient Argument that there is no certaine begining therof Because the Minister here cauilleth, that this discourse is vncoherent; Note, that the Answerer doth heere suppose some things proued before. First, that there is a knowne tradition &amp; historicall successiō extant of the Romane Church and of her Bishops, and their chiefe actions in matter of Religiō. Secondly that therfore such a notable change as is pretended by Protestants, made by these Bishops turning Christian Religion into open Idolatry could not haue been without famous no

                              e therof, according to time and persons, deliuered vnto posterity by report written and vnwritten. This supposed his discourse is consequent and conuincing; for thus the argues: Had adoration of the Images of our Sauiour been brought into the Church since the Apostles, against the Religion planted by thē, the beginning therof would haue been famously known by historicall traditiō written or vnwritten. But the time of the beginning of this pretended Idolatrizing is not noted by fame, nor by any full Tradition deliuered vnto vs. This is proued, because Protestants that goe about to set downe the tyme of the first entrance of this worship into the Church by degrees since the Apostles, vary among themselues, and their best narrations are conuinced of manifest falshood, whereby it is cleere they faygne. That the best of their disagreing relations be thus false, the Answerer sheweth, because the best and most esteemed relation may seeme that of M. Iohn White, which hath beene so often printed, and reprinted, and wherwith so many are deluded (or if this not the best, let our Minister shew a better which he hath neither done, nor endeauored to doe). But Iohn Whites relation is patched togeather of most intolerable grosse falshoods in euery point wherin he pretends beginning, and beginners. This the Answerer shewes vnanswerably. assignable; but because it were longe to set downe all their disagreeing assertions, I will only declare what M. Iohn White, brother to my aduersary in his booke printed and reprinted many tymes, sayth therabout, that your Maiesty may by this example vnderstand with how little sincerity the best

                              Two things you here deuise for defence of your Brother. First you say pag. 241. lin. 25. that the determination in the Councell, in this and in many other articles, is like Appollo his riddles, so ambiguous, as no wonder your Brother was deceaued. I Answere that the Councell of Trent allowes onely bowing before Images, with inward reference of the adoring affection vnto Christ, as any man that shall peruse the decree wil presently perceaue. Secondly, though the meaning of the Councell were darke &amp; obscure, yet whether the Councell gaue a command in this forme of words, some Images are to be worshipped with latria, cannot be obscure, nor can any mistake theirin, but only misrelate agaynst his knowledge, through desire to deceaue.
                              Now your Brother chargeth the Councell with giuing a commād in this very forme of words in his Way of digressions from the Church digress. 49. numero 5 pag. 345. lin. 10. The Church of Rom (sayth he) commands that s
                                       •
                                    me Images be worshipped, with Diuine honour, the very same that is due to God himselfe. The words with Diuine honour are set in a distinct letter, and the Councell of Trent is cited as commanding in this forme of speach, in the 25. Sessiō therof, where no such wordes are found in any part of the Councell. Is not this inexcusable lying?
                              Secondly, for his excuse ibidem lin. 33. you say, That which induced my Brother to charge the Trent Maisters with defining Diuine worship of images, was their silence in condemninge the teachers of such diuine worship, but especially the practise of the late Pontificians, that since the Councell teach Diuine worship of Images. Answer. First, though later Deuines did teach Diuine worship to be giuen to some Images, yet this would not excuse your Brother from being guilty of belying the Councell. For your Brother doth not onely say, that some Pontificians so hold, but that the Church of Rome defines, &amp; commands Diuine worship of Images, citing the Coūcel of Trent Sess. 25. so defining in as many words. Is not this kind of lying damnable, as being grosse in matter of religion &amp; saluatiō? Secondly, you eyther ignorantly mistake, or wilfully peruert the meaning of those Deuines, as the Answerer doth shew in the next Paragraffe.
                            Councell of Trent taught that Diuine

worship is to be giuen vnto Images, there being no such words in the whole Councell? As for the Iesuit, Vasquez whom he citeth, as so expounding the Councell, no such doctrine is found in him, either in the place quoted by the Minister, or in any part of his workes, yea the contrary is found l. 2. de adorat. disp. 9. c. 3. It is not (quoth he) to be said, that diuine honour is giuen vnto Images. Neyther doth Suarez the other Iesuit cited, expound the Coūcel to giue diuine worship vnto Christs Image, but only saith, that out of the Councel it may be gathered, that the Image of Christ, and Christ, are honoured by one and the same act of worship, which as referred vnto Christ, is Diuine worship, as referred vnto the Image, not diuine worship but inferior veneration. For as he declareth in 3. part. To. 1. disp. 54. Sect. 3. ad 7. Ille actus respectu prototypi est propriè Latria &amp;c. respectu viz. Imaginis, non est tam perfecta adoratio, sed inferior veneratio. The worship of Christ and his Image though one and the same Physicall act, is virtually two fold, being diuine honour towards Christ, not diuine, but a kind of inferiour honour towards the Image.
                        Nor is M. Whites [Way pag. 400] Argument good, We worship Christ and his Image by the same act, but the worship of Christ is diuine honour. Ergo, the worship of the Image is

diuine honour. For this proueth onely that the worship of the Image and of Christ being one and the same act, is diuine as referred to Christ, not as referred vnto the Image. Otherwise if M. White should helpe to pull his fellow-Ministers horse out of the mire, moued therunto out of christian charity and friendship, one might by the like argument proue that he beareth christiā charity towards horses, for he reliueth the horse, and pleasureth his friend by one and the same acte. The pleasuring of his friend is an acte of christian charity towards him. Ergo the pullinge of the horse out of the mire is an act of christian charity towards the horse. A foolish argumēt, because that one acte is virtually twofold; as referred to the man owner of the horse christian charity, as referred to the horse only, no charity at all, but a baser kind of loue, and that for his friends sake. The like is when we kisse with our corporall lips the feete of the Image of Christ, at the same time by deuout and reuerent Imagination kissing his true feet represented by the Image, we honour Christ &amp; his Image by one and the same Physicall acte, and that acte is diuine worship, though not diuine as referred to the Image, but onely as referred vnto Christ. A thing so easely vnderstood by learned men, as I meruaile Ministers vnderstand it not, or wrangle in a matter so cleer, if they sincerely seeke truth.
                           
And though the ignorant vnderstand not the tearmes of Theology, by which Deuines declare the manner of honoring the Prototype, and the Image, both by one acte, yet may they honour an Image, as securely &amp; with as little danger of erring as any that vnderstands them. For as the Clowne who knowes no more of the nature of motion, then that he is to set one foote before another, doth moue in the very same manner as Philosophers, who explicate that action by tearmes most obscure, of intrinsecal and extrinsecall beginning and ending, and per vltimum non esse, &amp; primum non esse; so likewise a catholike that vnderstands no more of honouring Christ his Image, then that he is by beholding the Image to remember Christ, and with pious &amp; affectuous imagination to adore him, doth honour our Sauiour &amp; his Image by one and the same acte, as truly, verily, &amp; religiously as the greatest Diuine that can learnedly explicate the manner how that adoration is performed as being done outwardly, relatiuely, and transitorily vnto the Image, affectuously, absolutely, finally vnto Christ.
                        Secondly, wheras he saieth, That the councell of Nice brought in the worship of Images, yet forbad that any Image should be adored with Diuine honour, he both contradicts himselfe, and vttereth another manifest falshood. He contradicts

himselfe in saying that the Nicene councel forbad diuine worship of any Image, seing in another place he thus writeth, Defence pag. 453. Both the Councell of Nice, and the Deuines of the Church of Rome hold the Images of God, and our Sauiour, and the Crosse must be adored with Diuine adoration 
                           The Minister hath not a worde to say in excuse of this contradiction and falshood of his Brother.. It is apparantly false that the said Nicene councell brought in the worship of Images, which might be proued by many Testimonies, but this one may suffice, 
                              Zonaras in Leone Isaurico &amp; Paulus Diaconus in miscella. lib. 21. Accusabat omnes antecessores Principes quasi Idololatrae fuissent, propter adorationem sanctarū Iconum. that Leo Isauricus before the councell of Nice opposed Image-worshippe, not as then beginning, but for many yeares before established in the church, boasting, that he was the first Christian Emperour, the rest hauing been Idolators, because they worshipped Images, so manifestly did he oppose antiquity, and so little truth there is in M. Whites 
                           The Minister saith that the Nicene Synode brought in the practise of worshipping of Images, by definition, not simply. For the Israelites worshipped molten Images in Dan and Bethel, and the Symonians worshipped Images, Euseb. Eccles. Historia lib. 2. c. 13. The Gnosticks worshipped the Image of Christ.

                        Thirdly, to passe yet vp higher, that Images began in Gregory the great his time, and that he forbad the worship of

them, conteines other three falshoods. First Gregory is abused, who onely What the Minister saith pag. 248. lin. 2

                              . that Gregory did not approue that Images should be worshipped any way, is not only against Friar Bale, but also against the plaine words of Gregory, who saith expressely lib. 7. Epist. 5. that worship or veneration is due to the Crosse of Christ, and Image of the blessed Virgin. Wherfore whē elswher (lib. 7. Epist. 10.11.) he saith, that Images are no wayes to be adored, this is to be vnderstood according as himselfe expounds himselfe, l. 7. Epist. 53. non tanquā Deus, Images are not to be worshipped as God. And again we prostrate our selues before the Image, not as before the deity, but we adore him, whome by his Image we remember as borne, or as crucified, or as sitting in glory. Where he teacheth two things: first that

brings not the Testimony of The Minister saith pag. 250. lin. 11. that Polidore nameth Gregory amongst the old Fathers that condemned the worship of Images for feare of Idolatry, as Hierome, doth witnes. Answere. This is false and impossible. For Gregory liuing all most two hundred yeares after the death of S. Hierome, how could he be one of the old Fathers whom S. Hierome witnesseth to haue condemned Image-worship, for feare of Idolatry? Gregory thē is named by Polidore not amongst the old Fathers, but as one of the new Fathers, that is, Fathers of the new Testament, as seeming to speake against Image-worship, but in truth doth not, as hath bene said. any Father of the New Testament, but onely of the old, as of Moyses, Dauid, Hieremy, and other Prophets. And the scope of the whole chapter is to declare, that the reason why in the old Testament the Fathers misliked the worship of Images of God, was because they could not paint him aright, Cùm Deum nemo vidisset vnquam, because then no man had seen God The Minister saith, that the Iewes at least might haue adored the Images of Prophets, if such adoration had bene lawfull, as the Papists hold. Answer. In the same manner I argue. The Iewes might haue made the Images of their holy Prophets if the making of them had bene lawfull, as Protestants hold. Let the Minister proue by Gods word they made them, &amp; I will proue they worshipped thē. Let him, I say, shew that Images of Prophets were set in the beginning of their Prophesies, as his is set in the frontispice of this his Reply, and I promise him to proue the same were honoured. This is the thinge wherof we require example in Scripture, and wherin the Minister is as dumbe as a fish, not able to shew one proper Image of an adored person, lawfully made, that might not lawfully be adored.. Afterwards God (saith Polidore) hauing taken flesh, and being become visible to mortall eyes, men flocked to him, and did without doubt behold and reuerence his face shining with the brightnes of Diuine light, and euen then they began to paint, or carue his image already imprinted in their mindes. And these Images they receiued with great worship and veneration, as was reason, the honour of the Image redounding to the original (as Basill writes:) which custome of adoring Images, the Fathers were so farre from reprouing, as they did not onely admit therof, but also decreed, and commanded the same by Generall Councells in the time of Constantine the fourth and Iustinian the second his sonne. And therfore

what man is there so dissolute &amp; audacious as can dreame of the contrary, and doubt of the Lawfulnes of this Worship established so long ago by decree of most holy Fathers? Thus writeth Polidore, and much more to the same purpose in the very place where the Minister Citeth him to the contrary; which shewes, how notoriously his credulous readers are abused in matters of most moment. Hence appeareth the third falshood, that in Gregoryes dayes images began to be set vp in Churches; which to haue bene in the Churches longe before, the Testimonyes of S. Basill, Paulinus, Lactantius, and Tertullian do sufficiently witnes.
                        Neither can our Aduersary bringe any cleere testimony of antiquity against this custome. For the decree of the Councell The Minister sayth, that some Pontificians grant that this Councel forbad the making of images, so cleer is their decree agaynst them. I Answere: such Authors had no reason in the world, to be so persuaded of this Coūcell, but only the wordes of the decree. Now the wordes of the decree be not cleere, yea they cannot admit that sense being compared with the wordes that immediatly follow, as the Iesuit doth demonstrate: In so much as the Minister to frame an argument out of this decree, is forced (ridiculously) to curtall the text, &amp; take some few wordes, leauing the rest. Such is his obstinacy agaynst the light of truth. of Eliberis, that no Picture should be made in the Church, least that which is worshipped or adored be painted on walls (which the Minister [way pag. 345.] much vrgeth) cleerly signifyeth the contrary. For may not Images painted on tables, be in Churches, and yet neither made in the Church, nor painted on walls? which kind of Images the Councell doth not forbid. And why doth the Councel forbid

Images to be made in the Church as pertinent to the fabricke therof, or to be painted on Walls, but out of reuerence vnto Images? for they being holy things, and so to be honoured for their prototypes sake, the Councel thought it vnworthy of their dignity, that they should be made on walls where they may easily be defaced and deformed, and by Persecutours (for that Councell was held in time of persecution) abused. He doth also [Way pag. 345.] much insist vpon Epiphanius, [epist. ad Ioan. Hicrosol.] but relates (according to his fashion) both his fact &amp; words vnsincerely. Epiphanius (sayth he) finding an Image painted on a cloath hanging in a Church rent it downe, and said, it was against the authority of the Scripturs that any Image should be in the Church. Thus he vnsincerely (as I said) not expressinge what kind of Image that was, that Epiphanius rent in peeces. For Epiphanius saith: Cùm inuenissem imaginem hominis pendentem in E
                                 •

                              scio enim cuius erat, when I had found an Image of a man hanging in the Church, as Christs or some Saints, for I know not of whom the Image was. Epiphanius 
                           Here the Minister rayleth most intolerably, crying, that the testimonyes are cleere; but not so much as endeauours to answer the Iesuits arguments that are demonstratiue, as much as any can be in this kind of matter. The Ministers arguments on the other side haue no force at all being two, proposed in a double interrogation. If (sayth he pag. 254. lin. 2.) Epiphanius himselfe did not remember whose Image it was, whether of Christ, or of a Saint, or of some prophane man, how knowes this Iesuite, that it was the Image of a prophane person? I Answere. That Epiphanius did know that it was not Christs image, nor any Saints, but some prophan persōs, thogh he knew not determinately, what prophane persons the same was. For Epiphanius would not haue vrged the vnlawfulnes of hanging that image in the Church, in regard it was a mans Image, had he not vnderstood a prophane mans. Hence his second interrogation is answered, why was Epiphanius silent and did not say it was some prophane mans? Answere. Epiphanius was not silent that the image he tore in peeces was the image of a prophane man, seeing he tearmeth it the Image of a man hanging in the Church, as Christs, or some Saints. And this the complayners knew well inough, for if this picture had been Christs, or some Saynts vsed by way of deuout remembrance, they would haue accused Epiphanius of impiety towards Christ, and his Saints, and not onely of iniustice in renting in peeces the Cloth, without paying the price therof, saying, si scindere voluerat, iustū erat vt aliud daret velum, &amp; mutaret.
                            doth by this relation more then insinuate that

this was the Image of some prophane man hanging in the Church, as if it had been a sacred Image of Christ, or of some Saint, which is gathered by his reason: When I saw, saith he, against the authority of the Scriptures, the Image of a man hanging in the Church; not absolutely any Image (as M. White citeth him, for euen by Gods expresse command Images were placed in the Temple) but the Image of a man. Why doth Epiphanius so much vrge the impiety of the fact, in regard that it was the Image of a man, but that he vnderstood by the word (Man) a meere ordinary prophane man, not a blessed Saint. For certainly it might seeme more against the authority of Scriptures to make and set vp in churches the image of God, then the image of holy men, &amp; the image of Christ according to his godhead, thē as he is a mā; so that there was no cause, why The Minister here setteth downe other answers giuen by Catholicks vnto this place of Epiphanius, some of which he would haue thought better then this of the Iesuit, and that the Iesuits is sleighted by Bellarmine; which discourse is to litle purpose. This is certayne, that if other solutions he better then this, yet this is so good, as the Minister hath not been able to speake a wise word agaynst it, as is more largely shewed in the Censure. Sect. 1. §. 1. And whereas some authors thinke, that Epiphanius in regard of the errour of the Anthropomorphilae, whereof he was a great Ennemy, did reproue this Image of the Anablathans, as being of God, in the forme of man; although this conceyte doth not help the Ministers fancy, nor make against vs, yet is it not so conforme to the text, as is the Iesuits. Which any man may perceaue that will peruse attentiuely the text of Epiphanius, and compare these two solutions therewith. 
                           Epiphanius should put so much Emphasis in the word (man) had he not vnderstood a prophane man. For some Christians in those Dayes, being newly conuerted from Paganisme, and so

retaining some Reliques therof, did out of their affection to their deceased friends and parents, vse to paint their images, and offer vnto them oblations of Frankincēse &amp; other the like Heathenish honour, especially in their Anniuersaryes Dayes vpon their sepulchers. These men S. Augustine, [de mor. Eccl. c. 36.] reprehends, and not the worshippers of Saints Images, vnder the title of Sepulchrorum &amp; picturarum adoratores, who to the ghosts of their parents defunct, did (though Christians) offer that Heathenish worship which the Poet exhorteth vnto.

Wherfore seing this Minister, so much esteemed in the Church of England, in proofe of the Roman Churches change brings nothing but manifest falshoods, so many in so few lines, any indifferent man may cōclude, that worship of Images hath continued without change euer since the Apostles. For if any change in such a matter as this had bene made, it would haue bene most euident, when, and by whom so great a Nouelty was introduced.
                     
                     
                        
                        The places of Exodus &amp; Deut. with no probability vrged against the worship of Images by Protestants that make them. §. 3.
                        AGAINST Image-worshippe Protestants bring the places of Exodus Chap. 20. v. 4. and 5. and of Deuteronomy Chap. 5. v. 6. and the 7. Thou shalt not haue false gods before me. Thou shalt not make to thy selfe a grauen Image, or any likenes either in heauen aboue, or on earth below, or of things that are vnder waters, or vnder ground, thou shalt not adore, nor worshippe them. Which place I wonder they can thinke stronge inough to ouerthrow a custome, in which the rules of Nature, the Principles of Christianity, the perpetuall Tradition of gods Church doth settle Christians. For this place makes against Note, that the question between vs and Protestants is not whether the Image of an adored persō may lawfully be made, for this they grant; but whether the image of an adored person lawfully made may be adored. We affirme, and they deny, but for their deniall haue not one sillable of Scripture. The Minister pag. 259. lin. 3. brings the brasen Serpent and golden Cherubims that were made yet could not be adored, but these examples are impertinēt, as hath been shewed, because they were not proper images of adored persōs wherof wee speake, though S. Hierome Epistola 70. also say, that the Golden Cherubims were adored. The Iconomachi, the Turks, and Iewes who thinke that to make any image of an adored person is vnlawfull, &amp; consequently forbid adoratiō haue for them a little shew of Scripture, which sayth, thou shalt no make any image, nor adore it. But Protestants, that grant, that the proper images of adored persons may be lawfully made, but deny they may be lawfully adored, haue against them the light and instinct of nature, and for them neither any example of Scripture nor any text that may make so much as a little shew. them, or not against vs, which I proue thus. The images we are forbidden to worship, we are forbidden to make, Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image, thou shalt not adore them, nor worshippe them. Contrariwise the images we may lawfully make, we may also lawfully adore or worshippe, if they be images of venerable and adorable persons (as before hath bene shewed.) But the images we worship of Christ Protestants make, yea some (to wit Lutherans) set them vp in their Churches, and they are images of an adorable Person. Ergo they

cannot condemne our adoration of images, except likewise they condemne their making them, as against Gods law.
                        If they answere, we are not forbidden to make thē but only not to make thē with purpose &amp; intention to adore them, they discouer much partiality, and not so much reuerence to Gods expresse 
                              〈◊〉
                            as they pretend; for the words of Gods law are as cleere and expresse against making of Images, as against worshippinge of them, Thou shalt not make them, Thou shalt not adore them. If then Protestants to excuse their custome of making of images may to Gods expresse word, Thou shalt not make them, adde (by way of explication) with purpose and intention to adore them, why may not The Minister pag. 259. obiects, that this precept, Thou shalt not make to thy selfe a grauen image, is expounded by the greatest number of Papists, to wit, with purpose to adore. I answere. Some Catholike Interpreters expound, Thou shalt not make any image, to wit, with purpose to worship the same as God, or with diuine worshippe referred vnto it, or to some Godhead affixed vnto it, not absolutely, not to worship it; which exposition is true for matter, though not so conforme to the letter. Now that these Authours do not vnderstād that all honouring of Images is here forbiden, but only adoratiō of images as Gods or as if some Godhead or diuine intellectuall vertue were affixed vnto them, is euident by their wordes. For the Authors are Gerson, Caietan, Castro, Oleaster, Stella, Turrecremata, Ferus, Aquinas, but nothing more notorious then that some of these held worship of Images: &amp; the same might be demonstrated of euery one. Let the first, to wit Gerson, speake for the rest in his exposition of the ten Commandments. fol. 173. We must (sayth he) worship the Images of Christ, his Blessed mother &amp; Saynts, not for themselues, but by seing thē, to giue honour vnto the Holy Person represented by them.
                            Catholiks to defend frō note of impiety a cōtinued Christian custome, to Gods word, Thou shalt not adore any image, add (by way of explication) as God, or with diuine worship resting in it? How can they truly boast, they bringe Gods cleere word for themselues and against vs, which is no lesse cleer and expresse against their image-making, then against our image-worship? If the place be difficill, why build they their fayth vpon it against vs? If it be cleere, why be they forced in their defence to depart from the expresse text?
                        Secondly, their exposition is not onely violent against the text, but also incongruous against the sense. For Gods prohibition

of a thing doth also forbid the intention therof. In the precept, Thou shalt not kill, the intention of murther is sufficiently forbidden: so that he who makes a sword with purpose to murther his enemy, sinnes against the precept thou shalt not kill. Wherfore if Gods precept had bene this, Tho
                              •••
                            all not weare about thee any weapon, Thou shalt not kill, the prohibition of wearing weapons should haue bene absolute, and not onely with purpose of murther. In like manner, Gods precept, Thou shalt not adore Images, doth sufficiently forbid intention to adore them, and consequenly forbids the making of Images with such an intention, so that if the precept not to make Images be nothing else then not to haue purpose to adore them, a whole longe sentence in the Decalogue is superfluous, &amp; without any speciall sense. Besides, as to make an Image to adore it is Idolatry, so likewise to take it in hand, or looke on it to that purpose; why then was not such looking, or touching with purpose of adoration expressely forbidden aswell as making? Or if looking on them with intention to adore be so included in the precept, Thou shalt not adore, as there needes not that expression; what need was there that making of images with purpose of adoration should be so largely and particularly expressed? Wherfore whosoeuer is a religious follower of Gods pure word

must either, without explication, condemne the makinge of images, together with their worshippe, or els allow the worship of Images (if the Prototypes be adorable) the making wherof he approues. Hence I gather, that the most naturall and truest exposition of that precept is, that it forbids not onely the worshippe, but also the making of any Grauen image. But how? to wit, of false Gods, or to represent God accordinge to his Diuine Substance 
                              This exposition is shewed to be good by the two rules of exposition which Protestāts thēselues appoynt. The first is, that whē a word is ambiguous and difficill, we are to looke to the antecedent, and declare the same with reference to them. This text, thou shalt not make any image, is difficil, as sounding ouer vniuersally, euen in Protestants iudgements: By lookinge vnto the words immediatly precedent, this vniuersality is restrained to a true sense. For the words immediatly precedent are, Thou shalt not haue false Gods before me. Now, if we expound what followeth, thou shalt not make any Image, by referēce vnto this, to wit, Thou shalt not make any image of false Gods, the sense is cleer truth.
                              The second rule is, when a place is difficil, we must expound the same by another speaking of the same matter, that is cleere, but the Scripture treating of this precept, doth in the same Chapter Exod. 10.13. cleerly declare these forbiddē images, to be the images of false Gods, saying, Non facietis Deos argenteos, nec Deos aureos facietis vobis, you shall not make to your selues Gods of gold or of siluer. Behold what is meant by grauen Images.
                           . This sense is gathered out of the words precedent, Thou shalt not haue strange Gods before me, which is explicated in the consequent verse, Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image, to wit, of false Gods; for he that makes to himselfe the image of any thinge, as apt to represent God according to his Diuine substance, and to conuey our Imaginations directly to him, doth make, and hath false Gods, because the true God is not imaginable, nor is truely apprehended by imagination conformable vnto any Image.
                        Wherfore the pictures of the Holy Ghost in forme of a Doue, and of God the Father in forme of an Old Man, be not proper &amp; direct Images of the two diuine persons, but onely of the Doue that descē
                           ded on Christ, and of the Old Man seene by Daniel in a vision, in which the perfections of these persons are not liuely represented, but a farre off, and imperfectly

shadowed. Nor do Catholiks vse them as proper images standinge for their prototypes, &amp; conueyinge our actions by imagination vnto them, for no Catholike doth kisse the feete of the Doue, or lye prostrate at them, referring by imagination that outward subiection to the feete of the holy Ghost, who hath no feet but metaphoricall, not imaginable, nor such as can be represented by Image.
                        Wherfore seing this text is thus cleerly explicable, and not being explicated at all, doth make no lesse against Protestants, then against vs; I see no reason why they should be so much out of loue with the worshippe of the Image of Christ Iesus their Lord, to which Nature &amp; Christianity binds them.
                     
                     
                        Inconueniences which may come by occasion of images easily preuented, and their vtilityes very great. §. 4.
                        
                        ANOTHER argument against images Protestants much vrge, That they be stumbling-blockes for simple People, who easily take an image to be the very God, euen as the Pagās did in former time 
                           The Minister sayth pag. 268. that Papists themselues complaine, that People did comnit Idolatry in the worship of imags, to which purpose he cites, Viues, Gerson. Cornelius Agrippa, Durādus Mimatensis, Gabriel Biel. Cassander, Polidore. Answere. First the Minister hath by some tricke or other, abused the words of almost euery one of these seauen, which were ouer long here to discouer. Secōdly, the witnesses are of no credit, or speake not to the purpose. Cassander is no Papist but a Protestant, &amp; put, by the Romane Church, amongst heretikes of the first ranke. Cornelius Agrippa a Necromant, fled for feare of punishmēt vnto the Protestants of France, &amp; there professed what he was. Polidore, Viues, Gerson are noted as full of mistaking in their complaints, and rash in Iudginge, and censuring. Durandus speaks against indiscreet &amp; excessiue vse of images, that the same may be dangerous, which no man denyes. Gabriell Biel derides the simplicitye of some people that rather worshippe fayre imags, and such as are trimmed thē other. Which simplicity is no more Idolatry, then it is to heare the sermon of a Minister trimmed in his Ruff

                               and Cuffs more willingly, then of another more simply attyred.; to this purpose bringinge some testimonyes of S Augustine epist. 19. and in Psal. 113. To this I answere first, that this may seeme a great wrong not onely to the Christiā Church, but also to Christ himselfe, to thinke that men indued with his knowledge &amp; fayth,

and made partakers of the light, wherby they belieue most high, diuine, and incomprehensible mysteries which he reuealed to the world, should so easily be carried away into such blockish Errours, as to thinke a stocke, or a stone to be God; a blindnes scarce incident vnto men, except they be wholy destitute of all heauenly conceipts, and nuzzelled vp from their cradles in that persuasion, as Paynims were (of whō onely S. Augustine speaks,) for they did not onely want this light of Christian instructiō, but also were taught by their Auncestors, that in their Idolls a kind of Diuine vertue, or Godhead was lodged, and affixed vnto them; wheras Catholik Doctrine teacheth the contrary, that our Images are bare resemblances of holy persons, no Diuinity, no Vertue, no Dignity, no Sanctity that makes them venerable being in them, but in the Prototype.
                        Secondly, such Idolls as the Paynims adored, many of them did by Diuels meanes ordinarily speake, giue answeres, moue and exercise other actions of life, so that their speaking was not accounted miraculous and extraordinary, but rather their silence; which speakings were very potente to perswade men to belieue what their Auncestours told them, that those very stocks, and stones were Gods, or had a Godhead affixed vnto them. Now these

kind of things seldome happen in our images, scarce once in a age, and when they happē they are takē as Miracles wrought, not by the images, or any vertue residing in them, but by Gods infinite power, nor are they brought to proue any excellency affixed vnto the image, but onely that God liketh that we should honour our Sauiour and his Saints in their images.
                        Finally, I dare say, vulgar &amp; ordinary Protestants in England, by reading The Minister sayth pag. 272. that the Creed is as dangerous in this respect as the Scripture, because it names the right hand of God. Answer. The Creed cā import dāger neither vnto Catholicks nor vnto Protestants. Not vnto Catholicks, because with the text of the Creed they receaue the Churches explication therof, which still preuents mistaking of that word. Not vnto Protestants, because they must belieue the Creed no further then they see the same conforme vnto Scripture, and so the Scripture attributing Humane shape vnto God is only dangerous vnto them. For the Scripture perpetually attributes humane shape vnto God, and their common people reade it by themselues, without any guide whom they be bound to belieue further, then by their skill in Scripture they shall find reason. the Bible in their mother tongue are in greater danger, to belieue that God is a body, and hath all the parts therof euen as hath a man, then any the simplest Catholike is to thinke an image to be God. This is proued to be likely, because it is impossible to conceiue God otherwise then in the forme of a corporall thinge; and as the Oratour sayth, We easily flatter our selues to thinke our shape the fayrest, and so the fittest for God. Wherfore it is easy for men to assent to this errour, vnto which the best and greatest wits that euer were, Tertullian (apud August. heres. 86.) and S. Augustine himselfe, whilest he was a Manichee, did assent (l. 3. Confess. c. 7.) Much more easily therfore may ignorant The Minister sayth pag. 272. lin. vlt. That the reading of Scripture by the vulgar is lawfull and holy, but the worship of images is alwaies condemned and censured by holy writ. Answer. This is easily said, but can neuer be proued. For Protestāts cānot bring one text of Scripture, that approues Scripture to be read by the vulgar as Protestants pretend, to wit, with authority to Censure, out of their skill in Scripture, the most Catholick &amp; best Church in the world. Nor will he, or any of his progeny be able to bringe one example, or one texte that shewes, that images of adored persons lawfully made, may not lawfully be adored, which is the Controuersy betwixt them and vs. people be deceiued

therin through weaknes of conceipt and inclination of nature, when they read the Scripture, describinge God as hauing the forme and shape of man, with head, face, eyes, eares, hands, and feet. On the contrary side neuer any Christian did teach that the image of Christ, is truly Christ, or a liuing thinge, nor euer did any man or woman, except some few, (and those very simple and senseles, (if such historyes be true) fall into such foolish imagination. Moreouer, children and ignorant people are in the Catholicke Church often and plentifully instructed against such errours as by our Catechismes appeare, and particularly by Iesuits, who make a solemne vow to keepe their Institute, especially about teaching the Rudimēts of fayth vnto common and ignorant people. Hence it is that in Townes where they dwell, and Villages about, on Sundayes &amp; holy dayes (besides their sermons for people more intelligent) they teach without fayle vnto children and men of ruder sort the forme of Christian doctrine, and vse all industry by giuing rewards vnto children, and by bestowing almes on poore people to make them willing &amp; diligent in this learning. In the English Church what is done for the instruction of ignorant, in their rudiments

of fayth by Ministers and Pastours, as I know not much, so will I say nothing, but only, that tyme they spēd in the praises of sole Fayth, The Minister here sayth, that the Iesuit doth depresse the English Church, accusing their Pastours of negligence; For which cause he tearmeth him, One, Cui verbosa lingua, cor verò obtenebratum, speaking much in praise of his Church, and of the liuely sole Fayth they preach. All which is idle, and ridiculous. And as for their sole Fayth, if it be the same Luther preached, it is so liuely and liue-like, as it maks a man to liue and not to dye though he commit the deadest workes that may be, Whoredome, and Murther a thousand tymes aday. Luther. Tom. 1. Epist. Latin. fol. 334. and about the secrets of Predestinatiō, &amp; in long bitter Inuectiues agaynst our doctrines, misunderstood (if not purposely misrelated) might (in my opinion) more profitably be spent, in declaring the Creed, and prime Principles of Christianity in plaine, and Catechisticall manner.
                        Besides, it is easy for the Romā Church to keepe her children from belieuing that Images be Gods, or true liuing things, or that any diuinity or diuine vertue resides in them, as may be proued conuincingly (in my Iudgement) by experience had of her power in this kind about a point more difficill. For what may seeme more euident then that a consecrated Hoast is bread, of which foure senses, sight, feeling, smel, tast, giue in euidence as of bread, no lesse verily thē any other, so farre as they can discerne? And yet so potent is the word &amp; doctrine of the Church, grounded on General Coū
                           cells declaring the word of God, for Transubstātiation, as Catholikes denying their senses, belieue assuredly that what seemeth bread is not bread, but the true body of our Sauiour vnder the formes of accidents of bread. Now cā any man with any shew of the least probability in the world, thinke that it is difficill for this Church to perswade

her childrē, that the image of Christ is not a liuing thing, nor hath any godhead or liuing diuine power lodged in it, as plaine Scriptures shew, and Generall Catholicke Councells, particularly the Tridentine (sess. 25.) and the Nicene, act. 7. define, which doctrine neyther reason nor sense can mislike? Or shall the sole similitude of members correspondent vnto humane liuing mēbers which images haue, so much preuayle in catholike minds so to bow down their thought to base Idolatry, as to thinke a stocke or a stone to be a God, and that the Church shall not be able by her teaching to direct them to a more high &amp; diuine apprehension, being able to make them firmly belieue a consecrated hoast is not bread, agaynst the Iudgement that they would otherwise frame vpon most notorious euidency of sense? The Protestāts Church on the other side may seeme to haue no great vigour by preaching to perswade commō people agaynst the Errour of the Anthropomorphits, seing their Principle is, that a world of preachers is not to be belieued agaynst the euident Scripture, yea Heere the Minister is bitter saying p. 277. lin. 30. That it is impossible for Papists to deale sincerely; That his Brother M. Iohn doth not speake of euery priuate man, nor any company of people, but that one Michaia, one Stephen, one Athanasius, with the word of truth in mouth is to be preferred agaynst 4. hundred Baalites. I answere. The Minister denying his Brother spake of euery particular man, shall receaue his doome by the breath of his Brothers owne mouth, telling him the cōtrary, who thus writeth in the place cited by the Iesuite, to wit, [Way pag. 126. lin. 12.] It is lawfull and necessary for EVERY PARTICVLAR MAN to try all thinges, and by the SCRIPTVRE to EXAMINE, and to IVDGE of the things the CHVRCH teacheth him. And when A MAN in this manner reiects the teaching of a Church, as great and good as the Roman Catholike, his iudgement therin is not PRIVATE, as Priuate is opposed to SPIRITVAL; Nor (sayth he, pag. 128. lin. 2. is it impossible for a PRIVATE MAN to espy an errour in the best Church that is. And pa. 150. lin. 18. Whereas the Catholiks answer, That the text of Scripture, try the Spirits, doth not allow EVERY MAN to doe this, but only Pastours; The Minister replyeth, this is all false, for the Epistle of S. Iohn speakes indifferētly of ALL MEN, Euery man by the Rule of Scripture is to try spirits, that Epistle being directed not to the CLEARGY, but to the PEOPLE: And the reason added, shewes that the PEOPLE are they that must try spirits, for they must try the spirits, that are in danger to be seduced by false Prophets, and such are the PEOPLE, and therefore they must examine thē. All these are his brother Iohns words. Now let the Reader iudge whether Iohn White doth not hold that not only extraordinary Prophets as Michaeas, &amp; Stephen, not only chiefe Patriarkes as Athanasius, but that euery particular man of the people, may iudge of the teaching of the whole Church, and condemne as great a Church as the Protestants, if by his spirituall exposition, or by the spirit he be moued so to do. What reason then had our Minister in respect of this allegation, to be so bitter, as to say, it is impossible

                                 or Papists to deale sincerely? Verily M. Francis, had you as much natural vnderstanding, togeather with knowledge of the Protestant Religion, as had your Brother Iohn, you wold see this doctrine, that euery Priuate man is by diuine Order and Institutiō to iudge of the Church (how absurd soeuer) to be necessarily consequent of the Protestant Principle, That euery man must finally resolue his fayth into the light of the Scripture; yea I could shew how your selfe, euen in this reply haue giuē this authority of iudging the Church vnto euery priuate Mā, as may partly appeare by the Censure sect. 4. 
                           that a common ordinary man by Scripture may oppose as great and greater Church, then is the whole Protestant. [Doctour White in his way pag. 59.] Which principle being layd, how will they conuince people, that God is a pure spirit, whome the Scripture doth so perpetually set forth, as hauing humane members? I

may conclude therefore, that their translating Scriptures into their vulgar languages breeds more danger vnto common people then our making of images.
                        But they will say; the Translation of Scriptures into vulgar languages is commanded in Scripture, and the Apostolicall Church practised it: whereas we cannot proue by Scripture that the Apostles did warrāt or practise the setting vp of images. This they say with great confidence, but any substantial proofe of this their saying, I could neuer read or heare. The testimonyes they bring in this behalfe, Search the Scriptures, Let his word dwell plentifully among you &amp;c. are insufficient to proue a direct and expresse precept or practise of trā
                           slating Scriptures into the vulgar tongue.
                        Catholikes on the cōtrary side (though they boast not of Scriptures, as knowing that nothing is so cleerly set downe in it, but malapert errour may contend agaynst it, with some shew of probability) yet haue Scriptures much more cleere and expresse then any that Protestāts can bring for themselues, euen about the vse of the image of Christ crucifyed in the first Apostolicall Church. S. Paul to the Galatians c. 3. v. 1. sayth, O yee foolish Galathians, who hath

bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Christ Iesus is liuely set forth Crucifyed among you. The greeke word correspōding to the English (liuely set forth) is 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           , &amp; the word 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            signifies to paint forth a thing. In so much as euē

                              ucifixus, Iesus Christ painted, or pictured, crucifyed before your eyes. So that we haue in plaine and expresse tearmes that christ was pictured as Crucified in the Apostolical churches, which the Apostle doth allow, thēce drawing an argument to prooue the Galathians were senselesse and sottish, that keeping in their sight the picture of Christ Crucifyed they would thinke to be saued by the Law and not by the merits of his Crosse. For it was madnes and folly to paynt Christ &amp; honour him as Crucifyed, &amp; not to thinke that by his death vpon the Crosse he redeemed the world. I know, that some Catholikes expound this place that Christ was paynted, and pictured out vnto the Galathiās, metaphorically by preaching. Which I do not deny; but this doth not repugne with the other sense, that he was also materially paynted as Crucifyed, nor must we exclude it, this sense being imported by the natiue and proper signification of the words, and hauing more connexion with the drift of the Apostles discourse, which is to prooue the Galathians senselesse in their forsaking Christ whome they had pictured,

Crucifyed before their eyes. For to forsake Christ crucifyed, pictured by preaching as the Sauiour of the world, though it be impious, yet not senseles, yea rather saluation by the crosse of Christ did seeme folly vnto the Gentils. But for men to haue Christ painted, as crucifyed before their eyes, honouring him by Christian deuotion, in regard of his crucifixion and death, and not to expect saluation by his Crosse and death, is sottish and The Minister is much vexed with the euidence of this Text, not finding which way to euade, as you may see pag. 280. First he sayth lin. 21. If this were true it proues only that Images may be made, but not that they may be adored. Answer. First, the Answerer in this place intends only to proue that the Apostles did allow the making of Crucifixes to represent our Sauiours Crucified person vnto Christiā deuotion. Secondly, this making doth inferre worship; for the proper Image of an adored person if it be made, it may be adored; agaynst which principle euidēt in reason, you cannot bring one word of Scripture. Secondly, you say Ibid. lin. 3. That according to learned Bannes, The worship of Images is neyther expressely, nor infoldedly taught in Scripture. Answere. Bānes meaneth that Image-worship is not formally inuolued in Scripture, nor matter of fayth  by vertue of sole Scripture. But he doth not deny but it is virtually contained in Scripture, so that it may Theologically be cō
                              cluded by texts of Scripture. Thirdly, you cry pag. 282. lin. 24. One Father that expounds this place literally according to your sense. I answere, first no Father nor Catholicke denyes this litterall sense, and Athanasius is brought by Turrianus l. 4. de Dogmat. Charact. thus expounding. Secondly, Protestants who appeale vnto the Scripture, as vnto the last iudge to giue definitiue sentence, are bound to take the words of Scripture in the litterall sense, except they can cleerly demonstrate by Scripture the litterall sense to be absurd. Otherwise if without euident proofe by Scripture they metaphorize the Scripture, they appeale not vnto Scripture, but vnto their owne fancies. But by Scripture you cannot proue, that the litterall painting of our Sauiours Image as Crucifyed is absurd, more then the painting of Luther, and Caluin, and such other of your pretended Prophets is absurd. Therfore you must stand to this litterall sense, or els confesse that you will not be ruled by the word of God, but depart from the litterall sense thereof, when you please, without shewing warrant so to doe. Finally, the Minister sayth, ibid. lin. 27. That 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 , signifyeth to be written before, not to be painted before. This is his last, yet a desperate shift. First all Lexicōs euē those of Protestāts say, that as 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              , signifyes before, so 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              , signifyes to paint, or make figures, &amp; because writing is a kind of painting or making of Characters, hence

                               also signifyes writing. For is not

                               signifies to paint? Secondly, not only Beza, and Erasmus so translate, and the French Geneuian, Pourtrayé deuant les yeux, Christ Iesus pictured before the eyes; but also Caluin in his comment vpon this place sayth expressely, depictus meo iudicio optimè quadrat, the best translation in my Iudgenent is depainted, adding, the Apostle doth heere signify, that there was amongst the Galathians non nuda doctrina, sed viua &amp; expressa Christi crucifixi Imago, nor the meere preaching, but also liuely and expresse picturing of Christ crucifyed. Finally, the Minister who heere sayth that, 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                               doth not signify is depainted, elswhere pag. 213. lin. 26. sayth the contrary, to wit, that S. Paul doth testify, Galat. 3.1. That by the Ghospell Christ Iesus IS DEPAINTED before the eyes of the soule. Now, how can this be true, except 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                               properly signify is depainted, and be thence transferred by metaphore vnto preaching? 
                            senselesse. And of this materiall picturing of Christ crucifyed Athanasius expoundeth this place, whome Turrianus citeth [De Dogmat. charact. l. 4.] Wherefore I may iustly say, that we haue more cleere &amp; expresse Scripture for the vse of images, then haue protestāts for their Translations.
                        And therefore the danger of ignorant people erring by images, is without reason so much insisted vpon by Protestants, their English translations being (as I haue shewed) a more dangerous blocke for fooles to stumble at, and so fall into damnable errours. If they presume that by diligent instruction they may, and would haue vs thinke, that they doe preserue their people from that errour, why should they not thinke that the Roman Church, being so potent with her children, can keep them from the foolish errour of attributing life and diuinity vnto dead &amp; dumbe images? and that she will so do, being so strictly cō

Councell of Trent, to vse her greatest diligence in this point, that ignorant people fall not into errour by any image, which otherwise haue many profits and vtilities? About which I will not enlarge my selfe, but only mention some of them. The first is an easy and compendions way of instruction, in which respect they are tearmed by S. Gregory

                            sayth, the silent picture speakes on the wall and profiteth very much. The second is to increase in men that keep &amp; honour them, the loue of God, and of his Saints; which effect S

                           Chrysostome experienced as he testifieth saying, I loued a picture of melted wax full of piety. And S.

                           Gregory the Great sayth, they inflame men that behold them in the loue of their Lord and Sauiour.
                        The third is, to moue and incite men to the imitation of the vertues of Christ and his Saints, which vtility S. Basill

And examples might be brought of mē reclaymed by sight of godly images euen in the heat of sinfull affection. The fourth is to stay our thoughts vpon Christ and his Passion, that our imaginations in prayer may not so easily wander, which vse of images catholiks in their deuotions do often experience. Finally that in his image we may honour Christ, the

honour of the image redounding to the Originall: And who so crowneth the Kings image honoureth the King whose image it is, sayth S.

                              The Minister concludes this disputation with saying. pag. 289. lin. 10. Let it be noted that our Aduersary hath manifested wonderous weakenes. For he hath not throghout his whole disputation produced one playne Text of Scripture or cleere sentēce of antiquity for Iconolatry. I answere. That Iconolatry signifyes diuine worship of Images which the Answerer did not intend to establish, yea the Minister himselfe p. 245. lin. 1. saith that Iconolatry or diuine worship of Images is impertinent, or heretogenious

                                    o this disputation. Wherfore the Minister herein sheweth wonderous defect of iudgment, who thus by his own confession flyeth the questiō. Nor hath he beene able to bring one example or text of Scripture, I do not say playne, but with a little shew, to proue the question in hand, that the proper images of adored persons that be lawfully made, may not lawfully be adored. On the other side, such images of adored persons if they be made that they must be adored, the honour done, or denyed to the Image redounding to the person, the Iesuite hath proued by the force of the nature of images, by the Analog

The testimonyes of the Fathers more in particular concerning the adoration of Christ his image, &amp; materiall Crosse, as being vnto al learned men vulgarly known and notorious, the Answerer did not produce, further then was necessary to proue that Protestants cannot truly assigne the time when the bowing vnto the image of Christ was brought in among Christians, but by the Apostles. Els what more easy then to haue brought testimonyes for this point in euery age vpward frō the eight, where the same was defined  by the Generall Councell of Nice, as appeares by this Catalogue of foure in euery age, which is one aboue the highest number of witnesses required to make a matter of fact firme &amp; certayne.
                              In the seauenth age, the sixt Generall Councell canon. 73. sayth, We that are saued by the Crosse ought to vse all diligence to giue it due honour, to wit, Adoration with mind, with speach, with gesture. For which cause we decree, that no Images of the Crosse be made on the floore. S. Maximus martyr, lib. cui titulus, ex dogmat. inter Maximum &amp; Theodos. writes, that diuers persons of worth, &amp; amongst them the Bishop of Caesarea, being conuerted from the Heresy of Monothelisme did with teares of ioy and pennance goe to the Church, where they saluted (that is bowed vnto) the holy Images of our Sauiour, and of our Lady mother of God, and laying their hands vpon them abiured their Heresyes. S. Sophronius Homil. in laudem Sanctae Crucis: In the midst of Lent (sayth he) the Venerable Wood of the vitall Crosse is adored, seing our Lord hath appointed this way for vs to get pardon of our sinnes, according to the Tradition of holy Fathers. S. Leontius lib. 5. aduersus Iudaeos: The Iewes deride vs who haue in honour and esteeme, and do wor

                              In the sixt age, S. Gregory l. 7. Epist. 5. sayth: worship and veneration is due to the holy Crosse, &amp; image of the Blessed Virgin. Procopius Gazensis in cap. 20. Isaia writes that, the Christian custome was to paint the images of the holy Martyrs on the prores of ships, for defence and protection. Euagrius l. 4. c. 26. relates miracles done through the worship of Images. S. Simeon Stylites Epist. ad Iustin. Imperat. sayth: If according to your sacred Lawes they that offer dishonour vnto the statues and images of the Emperour be worthy of death, what punishment do they deserue that with barbarous fury haue defaced the Image of our Lord, and his blessed Mother?
                              
                              In the fift age, S. Cyril. Homil. cont. Nestor. in Concil. Ephesin. sayth, the Crosse is adored ouer the whole world. S. Sedulius lib. 4. Paschal. no man is ignorant that the image of the crosse is to be adored. S. Chrysostome in Liturgia: Let the Priest as he goeth to the aultar bow his head to the image of the Crosse. S. Hierome in Epitaph. Paulae, commends the deuotion of S. Paula in that she did lye prostrate before the Crosse, &amp; kissed the same with great faith, adoring Christ therein as if she had seene him present on the Crosse. S. Paulinus Epist. 11. writes that the print or image of our Sauiours feet on the mount Oliue
                                    •
                                 , was miraculously conserued and adored, as also the holy Crosse yearly at Easter, the Bishop himselfe being the principall adorer.
                              
                              In the fourth age, Prudentius l. 2. Cont. Simmach: The Roman Emperour lies prostrate in the Church of Christ, and the Gouernour of the world adores the standard of the Crosse. S. Athanasius q. 15. ad Antiochum, writes, That Christians worshipping  the image of the Crosse, if Heathens accuse them of adoring the wood, may presently dissolue the Crosse, and cast away the wood. Helladius successour of S. Basill, writes of S. Basill, how he did kneele and pray suppliantly before the image of our B▪ Lady agaynst the threates of Iulian the Emperour. Iulius Firmicus de error. profan. Religion. c. 22. sayth; What do these hornes signify but the Venerable figure of the holy crosse &amp;c? vnto these hornes fly with humble veneration.
                              
                              In the third age before Constantine, Lactantius liued, through he saw also the beginning of Constantine his raygne. This Father in carm. de pass. testifyes that at the entrance of Christian Churches was placed a faire image of Christ Crucifyed; &amp; shewing how men ought, &amp; how Christians behaued thēselues towards it sayth, Flecte genu, lignum

So great is the power of the Crosse, that if it be placed before the eyes, and faythfully retayned in mind fixed vpon the death of Christ, the army of sinne &amp; flesh is conquered. S. Gregory called Illuminator, who conuerted Armenia, did (as Euthim. panop. part. 3. tit. 20. relates) place wooden Images of the Crosse vpon the shrines of Martyrs, bidding the multitude of people that thither resorted to giue worship vnto God by the Adoration of the Crosse. S. Procopius Martyr, as doth witnes Nicephorus l. 7. c. 15. did adore a golden image of the Crosse of Christ crucifyed, &amp; by it got great victoryes.
                              In the second age, in the beginning wherof some of the Apostles liued, Tertull. in Apol. c. 44. writing against Heathens that obiected that Christians were worshippers of the woodden image of the Crosse, graunts the thing to be true, &amp; defendeth the same. Yea the Protestant Magdeburgians Centur. 5. c. 6. acknowledge that such Crosses of wood were then amongst Christians frequently vsed &amp; set vp in Churches. S. Ignatius epist. ad Philip. doth acknowledge diuine power &amp; vertue in the image of the Crosse. It is (sayth he) the victorious trophey, or the monument of Christs victory against the Diuell quod vbi viderit, horret. S. Martial. Epist. ad Burdeg. l. 8. exhorts Christians still to haue the Crosse before them, in mente, in ore, in signo, in mind, in mouth, in the image thereof, this being the inuincible armour of a Christian agaynst Satan. The Canons of the Apostles haue beene euer famous in the Christian Church, wherof one is cited in 2. Nicen Synode which sayth: Let not the faythfull be deceyued by Idolls, but paint the diuine humane vnmingled image of the true God our Sauiour Iesus Christ &amp; of his seruants agaynst Pagans &amp; Iewes, that so they neyther goe astray vnto Idolls, nor be like the Iewes. Finally, that these images of Christ crucified were vsed in the Apostles time by their allowance, the Iesuite  proueth by the text of S. Paul to the Galathians 3.1. so cleerly, as you are forced to say, that

the end of this discourse endeauour to giue your Maiesty satisfaction. In which question I will suppose without large and particular proofe (being able to prooue it, by testimonyes vndeniable if need be) that Worship &amp; Inuocation of Saints hath byn generally receaued in the whole Christian Church, at least euer since the dayes of Constantine.
                     
                     HEERE the Minister, either out of ignorāce, or rather out of desire to outface the truth writes in this sort, pag. 290. You presuppose that which notwithstanding your outfacing, you will neuer be able to proue, that Inuocatiō of Saints was vniuersally receaued as an article of faith,
                        This Discourse following, is an addition, wherin is declared that the Ancient Fathers held Inuocation of Saints, as a matter of Fayth. 
                        euer since the dayes of Cōstantine. Thus he. Wherfore aswell because the matter is important, as also to take away this tergiuersation, I will heere make good the Answerers word, and demonstrate that al the Fathers some one way, some another haue testifyed to the world, that they held Inuocation of Saints as a matter of Christian fayth and Religion.

                        TO accomplish this more cleerly, and with lesse tediousnesse vnto the Reader

I shal reduce the Fathers saying vnto an eleauen heads, &amp; which may serue as an eleauen different arguments &amp; demonstrations of this truth.
                        
                           The first Demonstration.
                           If the Fathers held the doctrine that Saints are to be inuocated, &amp; that men are aided by their merits, as certain &amp; infallible, then they held it, as a point of faith, or a reuealed truth; for on what other ground but the word of God could they pretend to hold it as certaine, the same not being euident in the light of nature? But the Fathers teach this doctrine as a matter certayne, and infallible, &amp; not to be doubted of by Christians as their words declare. S Augustine:

                           The second Demonstration.
                           If the Fathers commend Inuocation of Saints and confidence in their merits as an act of Christian Religion, promising assured comfort to them that do it with fayth, they held the same as a matter of Fayth, &amp; as groūded on the word of God. For what but Gods word can be the ground of assured confidence about diuine &amp; supernaturall graces? But the Fathers teach this Inuocation as a matter to be done in the assurance of faith and Christian piety, wherin their wordes are most cleere. S. Gregory Nazianzen

                                 Chrysostom. homil. in Sanct. Iuuentium &amp; Maximum Mart. Magna Fide reliquias eorum contingamus, vt inde benedictionem aliquam consequamur &amp;c. quaecunque voluerint apud Regem caelorum impetrare possunt. 
                              Let vs often visit the Martyrs, let vs adorne their shrines, let vs WITH GREAT FAYTH touch their Reliques, that thence we may receyue some benediction, for they impetrate of the heauenly King, by shewing their wounds, and in their hands their heads cut off, whatsoeuer they will. Therefore let vs with Great Fayth, and alacrity resort vnto them. And in another place he thus exhorts: 
                                 Idem. homil. post. reditum ab exilio. Credimus nos iuuari illorum meritis.

                              Who can doubt but God is present with these forty Martyrs who promiseth to be where two or three are gathered in his name? whosoeuer is in any distresse, let him FLIE vnto them, and whosoeuer is in comfort, let him PRAY VNTO THEM, the one, that he may be freed from misery, the other that he may be preserued in prosperity.

                              We shall be holpen by the Patronage of so many Saints, let vs then with FVLL FAYTH, and all deuotion be supplyants vnto them, and runne after their steps; That by their intercessions we may obtayne ALL we request. S. Maximus:

                              If vnto Saints whose bodyes be remote

from vs we offer the PIOVS DVTY of VOWES, FAYTH will make them ours, and how distant soeuer their bodyes be from vs, they will affoard vs their Patronage we hope for. And agayne:

                              Doest thou inuocate the Martyr EVERY WHERE? He that is honoured in the Martyr doth heare, and will graunt thy prayers euery where &amp;c. And by how much the FAITH of the Clyent shall be more DEVOVT, by so much the assistance of the PATRON will be more efficacious &amp; present. Theodoret: 
                                 Theodor. lib. 8. de curand. Graec. affection. Gratia enim quae fectis eorum corporibus pollens vigensue persistit petentibus dona distribuit Fidei supplicantiū liberalitatem suam cō
                                 mensa. 
                              The bodyes of the Martyrs being deuided into parts &amp; dispersed ouer many Townes and Cittyes, yet the grace and power remaynes entyre and vigēt in euery particle, and they distribute gifts vnto petitioners, measuring their liberalities according to the FAYTH of the SVPPLIANTS. And agayne: 
                                 Ibid. PIE &amp; FIDELITER precatos. 
                              They who pray vnto the Martyrs piously &amp; with FAITH, obtayne the things they most desire, as do testify the giftes they being bound by vow offer at their Tombes, manifest tokens of health obtained. S. Gregory the Great: 
                                 Gregor. Dialog l. 2. c. vlt. Vbi sancti Martyres in suis corporibus dubium nō est quod multa valeant signa demō
                                 strare, sicut &amp; faciunt, &amp; innumera miracula pura mente quaerentibus ostendunt. 
                              No doubt but Martyrs at their tōbes shew innumerable miracles to them that seeke with pure hart, but because weake Fayth may doubt whether they be present, so that they can heare where their bodyes are not, therefore oftentymes greater myracles are done where their bodyes are not: but 
                              Mens in Deo fixa tantò maius habet fidei meritum, quantò illic eos &amp; nouit non iacere &amp; tamē credit non deesse ab exauditione. 
                              they whose mind is fixed on God haue the greater MERIT OF FAITH in that they belieue the Saints to be there present to heare mens prayers, where they know they are not present in their bodyes.
                           
                           
                              Behold how fully, expresly, &amp; constantly, the Fathers affirme Inuocatiō of Saints with confidence in their merits, and that they heare our prayers to be MATTER of Piety &amp; DIVINE FAITH.
                        
                        
                           The third Demonstration.
                           That deuotiō which the Fathers prayse, honour, &amp; admire, as diuine and supernaturall, &amp; as a testimony that Christ is God that could plant the same in the world, this they hold as a point of Christian Religion, and as an excellent part thereof. But the Fathers so esteeme of Inuocation &amp; worship of Saints as their words do witnesse. S. Gregory of Nisse 
                              
                                 
                                    Nissen. orat. in S. Theodor. Martyrem. Aliorum enim reliquiae vulgò detestabiles sunt, nullusue volens ad eorum tumulum accedit &amp;c.
                                 His operibus oculos oblectantes cupiunt loculo reliquas corporis partes admouere. Etenim ipso contactu, sanctimoniam credunt &amp; charitatem excitari &amp;c.
                                 Ipsum corpus perinde ac si viuum florensue esset amplectū
                                    tur, &amp; deosculantur, oculis, ore, auribus omnibus denique sensibus adhaerent, lachrimasque pietatis &amp; affectionis indices effundunt &amp;c.
                               proues this worship to be supernaturall and diuine, as being beyond the custome of men &amp; instinct of nature. The Reliques (saith he) of other dead mē be detestable, &amp; men feele horrour at their sight, whereas men desire nothing more then to touch the shrine of Martyrs with some part of their bodyes, BELIEVING that by the very touch, sanctimony, and charity is engendred. They 
                              Martyri supplicant qui quando vult, inuocatus munera impetrat. Corpora aliorum &amp;c. proiecta iacent; quae verò Martyrij gloriam obtinuerunt, amabilia, iucunda, &amp; omnium studiis certatim complectenda. 
                              CAL ON the Martyr as on Gods Ministe, who being INVOCATED by men, is able to impetrate for them what fauours he pleaseth. Hence pious people learne how pretious in the sight of God is the death of his Saints, that wheras the bodyes of other men are horrible, the bodyes of them that were adorned with Martyrdome be deare, and amiable, and imbraced, and worshipped of all.
                           
                           
                              Saint Chrysostome proues Christ to be God, in that he was able to plant Inuocation of Saints in men, specially in the Kings and Emperours of the world; 
                                 Chrisostom. homil. 66. ad populum Antioch. Stat sanctis supplicaturus vt pro se intercedant apud Deum. Audebis igitur quaeso horum Dominū mortuum appellare, cuius serui, vel mortui, terrarum orbis Regum sunt protectores? Vide eundem orat. in S. Babilam. 
                              Euen he that is cloathed with the Imperiall purple comes to worship, and imbrace these shrines, and laying aside pride &amp; pompe, becomes supplyant vnto Saints, that they will intercede for him vnto God: So he that weareth the diademe of the Empire, prayeth the Tent-maker &amp; the Fisherman to be his protectours. And darest thou tearme that Lord a dead man, whose seruants though dead are the protectours of the Kings of the whole earth?
                           
                           S. Augustine in like manner prooueth the Diuinity of Christian Religion by the Christian practise of worship and inuocatiō of Saints: 
                                 Augustin. epist. 42. Huius saeculi potestates non à repugnantibꝰ sed à moriētibꝰ Christianis victae, contra simulachra impetus suos legesue verterunt, &amp; imperii nobilissimi eminentissimum culmen ad sepulchrū piscatoris submisso Diademate supplicat.
                               
                              Euē the most eminēt head of the noblest Empire that euer was, bowing downe his Imperiall diademe, is suppliant at the shrine of the Fisherman Peter. The same dignity of Christian Religion is noted by Saint Ambrose: 
                              
                                 Ambros. l. 10. in Lucam c. 21. Regibus martyres caelestis gratiae honore succedunt, &amp; illi fiunt Supplices, hi Patroni. The Martyrs by the honour of heauenly grace are insteed of Kings, yea Kings be suppliants vnto Martyrs, as vnto their Patrons. Theodoret spends one whole booke of his eight agaynst Graecians, or Heathens, in this argument, shewing the glory of Martyrs, in that people of all nations, in all occasions, inuocate them, and they bestow fauors on their suppliants, cō
                              cluding 
                                 Theodoret. lib. 8. aduersus Graecos. Haec quae sit Sanctorum Martyrum virtus ostendunt. Martyrum verò virtus, quem coluerunt verum Deum esse declarat. thus: These things shew how great is the power of Martyrs, &amp; the power of Martyrs proues Christ whome they worshipped to be God.
                           
                        
                        
                           
                           The fourth Demonstration.
                           That piety &amp; deuotion which the most holy Fathers taught as an assured meanes of Remission of sinnes, of appeasing Gods anger &amp; of saluation, was by them held as a matter belonging to Christian Religion and fayth. The holy Fathers taught worship and Inuocation of Saints with confidence in their merits, as a meanes of appeasing Gods Anger, of Remission of sin, and of saluation. This appeareth by their words. Origen sayth: 
                                 Origen. homil. 27. in Matth. Intercedunt &amp; prouocant Christum, ne deserat genus humanum propter peccata eorum. 
                              the Saints before the throne of Christ intercede, &amp; stirre him vp not to forsake mankind for their sinnes. S. Cornelius Pope: 
                                 Cornel. Epist. 1. Intercedentibus Sanctis Apostolis purget maculas peccatorum. 
                              Pray vnto our Lord Iesus that the holy Apostles interceding, he will PVRGE the STAINES of our sinnes. S. Cyprian: 
                                 Cyprian. de stella &amp; magis. Veniam obtinentes immeritis. 
                              they being Iudges &amp; Senatours of the heauēly Court, obtayne Pardon for many that are vnworthy. S. Gregory Nissen: 
                                 Nissen. orat. in S. Theodor. Preces Iustorum crimina diluunt. 
                              The prayers of many martyrs wash out the CRIMES of Nations and countryes. S. Ambrose: 
                                 Ambros. lib. 5. de vid. Pro peccatis intercedere possunt. 
                              They can intercede for our SINNES, who wash awayt their own with their bloud. Prudentius: 
                                 Prudent. Hymn. de S. Laurent. Indignus quem Christus audiat, sed per patronos Martyres potest salutem consequi. 
                              he that is vnworthy, may, hauing Martyrs to be his Advocats and Patrons, obtayne saluation. Nectarius 
                                 Nectar. orat. in S. Theodor. Placatum famulis tuis. 
                              Oh thou that stands by the throne of Christ, appease his Anger, and make him mild and gentle vnto his seruants. S Hierome: 
                                 Hierom. epist. 25. de obitu Blesill. Veniam impetrat peccatorum. 
                              holy Blesilla prayeth for me, and as I am sure obtayneth for me remission of my sinnes. S.

me downeward euen to the very pit of hell, yet this hope remayneth, this my only last hope, that what we are not able to obtayne by our selues, we may merit to obtaine by the prayers of holy Martin. S. Paulinus: 
                                 Paulin. de S. Faelic. Nat. 8. Exorare Deum pro peccatoribus aegris, vique boni meriti meritum superare sinistrum.
                               
                              It is the custome of Saints to pray for distressed sinners, by the force of their good merit, ouercoming the strength of euill merit. S. Chrysostome: 
                                 Chrysostom. homil. 41. in Gen. Author salutis his qui suà se perdiderunt desidiâ. 
                              God often for the merits of Saints deceased, hath mercy of the liuing that otherwise are vnworthy. Dauid deceased many yeares before was the Authour of SALVATION vnto them that had lost thēselues by their slouth 
                              
                                 Homil. 2. in Psal. 50. Dauid mortuus est, sed merita eius vigent. homo mortuus viuo Patrocinatur.. Dauid is dead, but his merits liue, the dead man is the patron of the liuing; 
                              
                                 Serm. de virtute &amp; vitio. Ad mortuos confugiēs propter eos peccata remittit. 
                              for their sake that are dead, God forgiueth sinne. S. Ephrem: 
                                 Ephem. serm. de Lau. SS. Martyrum. Vt vestris precibus saluari merear. 
                              Assist me, o holy Martyrs, before the throne of the diuine Maiesty, that by your PRAYERS, I may be SAVED. S. Augustine: 
                                 August. lib. qq. in Exod. q. 108. Significātur Martyres sancti quorū orationibus propitiatur Deus peccatis populi sui. 
                              By the red skins of the wheathers wherwith God would haue the v

                                 yles of the Tabernacle couered, we presently vnderstād our Sauiour made red and purpled with his bloud in his passion. But they likewise signify the holy Martyrs, by whose prayers God is propitiated and appeased for the sinnes of his people. S. Maximus sayth: 
                                 Maximus serm. de martyr. Tauric. Euadimus inferni tenebras propriis eorum meritis, attamen consocii sanctitate. 
                              By deuotiō vnto Saints we auoyd the paines of hell, by their very merits, being their fellowes in sanctity. S. Euthymius:

                                       ••
                                     in encomio ad beatam Virginem Mariam. Dum hic manemus nos protegas supplicamus, &amp; vt nobis parcat filius tuus &amp; Deus perennibus tuis precibus. 
                              O vnspoted virgin mother, thy Sonne and God pardon vs our sinnes, by the incessancy of thy praying for vs. And could the holy Fathers thinke worship and inuocation of Saints, with confidence in their merits, not to be a matter of

fayth which they so constantly teach and commend to be a meanes of saluation and remission of sinne?
                        
                        
                           The fifth Demonstration.
                           That which the Fathers did practise in their greatest needes, and in the chiefe acts of Religion, when the vse of true Christiā deuotion was most necessary, that they hold as assured and certayne deuotion, &amp; exercise of diuine fayth, and Christian piety: Such is the worship and Inuocation of Saints, with confidence in their merits, vnto which the Saints of God did fly in their greatest distresses. S. Iustina Virgin and Martyr, being strongly assaulted with fleshly temptations caused by magicke incantation, fled (as S. Nazianzen writeth)

                                 Concil. Chalcedon. can. 11. the whole councell prayed vnto Saints, as that most holy Councell of Chalcedon: Holy Flauian liueth with God, the Blessed Martyr pray for vs. As also did S. Augustine, 
                              
                                 Augustine lib. 5. de Baptism. contr. Donatist. cap. 2. Adiunet nos Cyprianꝰ orationibus suis. entring into the discussion of a most difficill controuersy, prefixeth this Deuotion: Holy Cyprian help vs with his prayers. In the very act of Martyrdome, when they were presently to goe out of this world, they did Inuocate Saints, as did Saint Acyndimus. Finally the whole Christian Church at the sacrifice of the Masse still hath vsed the same, as appeareth by all ancient The Roman, that of Ierusalem, the Aethiopian, Anaphora Syriaca, that of Millan, S. Basill, S. Chrysostome.
                               Lyturgies that are extant: for though the Priest in the act of sacrifice doe not inuocate Saints by direct and formall prayer, as sayth S. Augustine, 
                                 August. l. 8. De ciuit. c. 27. Quis audiuit stantem sacerdotem ad altare &amp;c. dicere in precibus, Offero tibi sacrificium Petre? 
                              Who euer heard the Priest being at the Altar to say, I offer sacrifice to thee Peter, or to thee Paul? yet the same 
                                 Idem tract. 8. in Ioan. Sic eos commemoramus vt magis orent ipsi pro nobis, vt eorum vestigiis inhaereamus. &amp; serm. 27. de verbis Apostol. S. Augustine doth witnes, that at the holy table commemoration is made of Martyrs, that they will pray for vs that we may follow their stepps. And S▪ Cyrill of Ierusalem before S. Augustine: 
                                 Cyrill Hierosol Cathec. 5. Cùm hoc sacrificium offerimus, memoriam facimus &amp;c. primùm Patriarcharū, Prophetarum, Martyrum, vt Deus orationibus illorum &amp; deprecationibus suscipiat preces nostras. 
                              When we offer sacrifice we make cōmemoration of Patriarkes, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs &amp;c. that God by their prayers and supplications will admit of our petitions. Wherfore seing the most holy and ancient

Fathers in their owne most grieuous distresse, in the greatest necessityes of the Church, in businesses of highest vniuersall importance, in the tyme of the most dread Christian sacrifice did vse prayers and Inuocation of Saints with assured cōfidence in their merits, who can doubt but they held the same as a point of Christian Religion, wherof they were assured by fayth &amp; Gods expresse word, deliuered by Tradition?
                        
                        
                           The sixt Demonstration.
                           What the Fathers held as a Christian custome and doctrine, confirmed by most certayne and euident miracles, that they held as a diuine and supernaturall truth. The Fathers held worship and Inuocation of Saints, with confidence in their merits as a Christian deuotion, cōfirmed by most manifest and certayne miracles, as 
                                 August. lib. 22. de ciuitat. c. 9. &amp;c. 10. S. Augustine sayth: Miracles are done by the intercession and impetration, if not also by the immediate operation of Saints. And againe: Martyrs do Miracles, or rather God for the prayers &amp; intercessions of Martyrs. In confirmation whereof the testimonyes of S. Basill, Nazianzen, Nissen, Chrysostome, Ambrose, Hierome, Augustine, Prudentius, Paulinus, Gregory the Great, Gregory Turonensis, and others might be plentifully alleadged.
                        
                        
                           
                           The seauenth Demonstration.
                           What the Fathers taught as a necessary supernaturall duty of Christian humility, they taught as a matter of fayth. The Fathers taught praying vnto Saints as a necessary supernaturall duty of Christiā humility. For though Inuocatiō of Saints be not so simply necessary but a man may in some cases be saued without the exercise thereof, yet because they that pray vnto God, feele by his holy inspiration their own vnworthynes, he moueth them to ayde themselues, by the comprecations of blessed Saints, as it were saying vnto them what he sayd to the friends of Iob: Goe to my beloued seruants, that they may interceede for you. Hence men do not ordinarily obtaine what they desire of God without this humility of crauing the Intercessiōs of Saints. To this purpose S. Greg. Nissen 
                              
                                 Orat. in S. Theodor. Quod si maiore opus sit auxilio, Martyrum adhibe chorum, &amp; vnà cū omnibus supplica. saith, that sometimes, Maiore opus est intercessione; there is 
                                    ••
                                 ed of greater intercession, and to inuocate or aduocate the whole quire &amp; cōpany of Saints. To this purpose S. Augustine writes that 
                                 August. serm. 17. de verbis Apostoli. Iniuria est pro martyre orare, cuius nos Debemus orationibus commendare. 
                              Debemus &amp;c. we must recommend our selues vnto the prayers of Martyrs: yea that we are taught by the holy Scripture, that 
                                 Idem. q. 149. in Exodum. Releuari apud Deū meritis nos posse eorum quos diligit. 
                              when we feele that our bad merits weigh vs down that we be not beloued of God, we may be relieued by the merits of them that are gratious in his sight. This humility of flying to the merits of deceased Saints, S. Chrysostome sheweth to be

taught vs in the holy Scripture by the example of the three children praying in the fornace: 
                                 Chrysost. homil. 84. in Matth. Quoniam semetipsos ad impetrandam populo veniā, sufficere non credunt, AD PATRVM MERITA confugiunt. 
                              For (sayth he) because they did belieue themselues not to be sufficient to obtaine pardon for the people, they fly to the MERITS of their Fathers, confessing themselues to bring nothing with them worthy of regard, besides an humbled and contrite hart, saying, for Abraham thy beloued, for Isaac thy seruant, &amp; for Israell thy holy one [Dan. 3.35. Finally S. Ambrose; 
                                 Amb. l de vid. Magno peccato obnoxia minus idonea est quae pro se precetur, certè quae pro se impetret. Adhibeat igitur ad medicum alios precatores &amp;c. Obsecrandi sunt Angeli pro nobis qui nobis ad praesidium datisunt: Martyres obsecrandi &amp;c. isti sunt Dei Martyres, nostri praesules, speculatores vitae actuūque nostrorum. 
                              The soule (sayth he) that is guilty of great sinne, is lesse fit to request, or at least to obtayne the remission thereof for herselfe: Therefore let her vse the intercession of others vnto her heauenly Phisitian. The Angells are to be beseeched that are giuē vs of God for our guard. The martyrs are to be beseeched in whose patronage we may seeme to clayme interest by the pledge of their bodyes. They may intercede for our sinnes who washed out their owne with their bloud. These be the Martyrs of God, our Gouernours, the ouerseers of our life and actions.
                           
                        
                        
                           The eight Demonstration.
                           That doctrine and deuotion which is deliuered by full Tradition from the Apostles as practised in al ages since them, as an exercise of Christiā piety, is a part of Christian fayth and Religion. But such is the worship and Inuocation of Saints. For not only in the third age there be not obscure but manifest steps of this practise, as the Centurists

the second which was immediate vpon the death of the Apostles. First, Saint Aurelian disciple and successour of S. Martiall 
                              
                                 In vita S. Martialis. Adsit nobis qui in orbe extitit pius Pastor, vt eius orationibus muniti, mereamur aeternae haereditatis participes fieri &amp;c. in his life prayeth vnto him. Saint Dionysius

                              he feedes vpon vayne hopes that craueth the prayers of Saints, &amp; doth not actions that agree with the nature of Saints. S. Ireneus:

                              The Virgin Mary is made aduocate of Eue: which wordes the Centurists censure as hard and incongruous.

                           Secondly, the vse of Procession was frequent in the second age presently vpon the Apostles death, as doth witnes Tertullian 
                                 Tertullianus lib. 2. ad vxorem c. 4. Si Procedendum erit, nunquam magis familiae occupatio tenebit.; but procession was ioyned with prayer vnto Saints, and visitation of their Reliques, as appeares by Eusebius who describing this practise sayth 
                                 Euseb. lib. 13. de praeparat. Euang. c. 7. Monumenta eorum accedimus, votaue ipsis facimus tanquam viris sanctis, quorum intercessione ad Deum non parùm iu
                                 
                                    •
                                 ari profitemur.: we visit the monuments of Martyrs, &amp; offer vowes and prayers vnto them, professing that we are not a little ayded with God by their Intercession. The same is also testifyed by S Chrysostome 
                              
                                 Chrysost. homil. in SS. Inuentium &amp; Maximum. Saepe eos nuisamus, tumulos adornemus., and S. Ierome plainly signifyes it, who exhorting a consecrated Virgin not to leaue her retyrement vpon occasiō of Processions, sayth: 
                                 Hierom. 22. Epist. ad Eustoch. de custodia virginit. c. 6. 
                              Martyres tibi quaerantur in cubiculo, numquā
                                 
deerit occasio procedendi, si quoties fuerit necesse processura sis: Visit the Martyrs (by deuout imagination) within thy chamber, thou wilt neuer want occasion to go in procession, if thou go as often as this will be needfull and requisite, in respect of visiting the Relikes and tombes of Martyrs.
                           Finally, in this primitiue age the custom was frequent to pray at the Shrines of Saints, and keeping their Aniuersary festiual dayes, as appeares by the Epistle of the Church of Smirna 
                              
                                 Epist. Smirn. apud Euseb. lib. 4. Histor. c. 15. Ambusta ossa (S. Policarpi) pretiosissimis gē

                                 Tertull. de corona militis. c. 2. Pro Natalitijs annua die facimus.
                               Now it is euidēt that this praying at Saints Tombes, &amp; the keeping of their feasts, was to the end that Christians should craue their intercessions, as doth witnesse S. 
                                 August. lib. 20. contr. Faust. c. 22. Populus Christianus memorias Martyrum religiosa solemnitate concelebrat, &amp; ad excitandam imitationem, &amp; vt eorum meritis atque orationibus adiuuetur. 
                              Augustine &amp; others. In which kind notable is the testimony of Origen 
                              
                                 Origen homil. 3. in diuersos. Bene ergo, &amp; secundum Dei voluntatem eorum memoriam celebrari Sancti Patres mandarunt &amp;c. vel pro ipsis parentibus, vt qui nimio dolore percutiebantur, ijs intercessio filiorum apud Deum prodesset., who sayth that amongst the reasons, why the Holy FATHERS commanded according to the will of God that the memory of the Innocents should be kept festiuall in the Church, one was pro ipsis parentibus, in regard of their parents, that seing their parents were grieued excessiuely at their death, the intercession of their children might be auaylable with God for them. Thus Origen, by whose testimony two things are euidēt. First, that the Apostles were the holy Fathers that did command the feast of the Innocents to be kept, and this whiles some parents of the sayd Innocents were yet aliue. Secondly, that the Apostles taught prayer and Inuocation of Saints, and did

institute festiuall dayes, that men might craue their intercessions.
                        
                        
                           The ninth Demonstration.
                           The Auncients taught Inuocation of Saints so fully and cleerly, as Protestants are forced to confesse that it was the certayne and full beliefe of the grauest Fathers. Chemnitius

                              Most of the Fathers, as Nazianzen, Nissen, Basill, Theodoret, Ambrose, Hierome, Augustine, did not DISPVTE, but AVOVCH the soules of Martyrs and Saints to heare the petitions of those that prayed vnto them: they went often to the monuments of Martyrs, and Inuocated martyrs by name. Thus he. And Doctor Whitegift Arch-bishop of Canterbury, Defence pag. 473. All the Fathers of the Greeke Church, &amp; of the Latin also for the most part were spotted with Inuocation of Saints. Fulke reioynder to Bristow pag. 36. I Confesse Ambrose, Hierome, Augustine, held Inuocation of Saints. The Magdeburgians Centur. 3. c. 4. Coll. 83. acknowledge, that in the Fathers next vnto the Apostolical times were foūd, Non obscura vestigia inuocationis Sanctorum; manifest markes of Inuocations of Saints.
                           
                        
                        
                           The tenth Demonstration.
                           That which the Fathers held so constantly as they condemned the denyers thereof as Heretikes, they held as matter of fayth. The Fathers held worship and inuocation

of Saints in this manner, condemning the contradictours therof, as Nouellists, &amp; Heretikes, to wit, Aerius, &amp; Vigilantius, as is confessed 
                                 Sarauia in defens. de diuersis pag. 349. and Beza against whō he writes ibid. Fulke in his Answere to a counterfayte p. 46.. This Argument as also the Nynth were brought by the Answerer, &amp; vnto it the Minister sayth, pag. 262. Our aduersary sheweth himselfe a weake antiquary whē he affirmes that Aerius and Vigilantius were cō
                                 demned of heresy, because they denyed Inuocation of Saints deceased. I Answere. The Minister heere sheweth himselfe both a weake antiquary &amp; a weake respondent. A weake respondent, because his aduersary did not only say, but also proued by the cōfession of Protestants, that Aerius and Vigilantius were condemned for denying Inuocation of Saints. For Sarauia, and Beza are cited as saying of Aerius, that he was condemned for affirming, that SAINTS DEPARTED are not to be PRAYED vnto. Fulke, and the Centurists are cited affirming the same of Vigilantius, as also doth 
                                 Centur. 4. l. 4. pag. 506. 
                              Osiander. Now vnto this Argument the Minister hath not replyed a word.
                           Secondly, he sheweth himselfe a weake Antiquary in denying that Vigilātius was condemned of heresy for his opposing &amp; deriding Inuocation of Saints. For S Hierome writing against Vigilātius, relates his scoffing at Inuocation of Saints, &amp; his saying, Ergo Cineres suos circumuolitant, ne fortè si precator accedat, absentes audire nō possint. For which saying S. Ierome exclaimes presently

against him: O portētum in vltimas terras deportandum! Aerius also is condēned by the Fathers, as an Heretike for his denying commemoration of Saints in the holy sacrifice of the Eucharist as it was then vsed by the Church, as doth witnesse Epiphanius 
                              
                                 Epiphan. haeres. 77.. But that cōmemoration of Saints deceased and glorious in heauen, was ioyned with recommending our prayers vnto God by their Intercessions and Supplications, as doth testify S. Cyrill,

                           What the Fathers taught with full consent and constantly without doubting or gaine saying one another, that they held not as a probable and disputable point, but as matter of fayth. The Fathers in this cō

                              enting manner, taught worship and Inuocatiō of Saints. Howsoeuer Protestants not able to deny this to haue bene their doctrine, seeke to discredit them, as if they had bene various, vncertaine, contradictious in this point.
                           But seing Christiā antiquity that hath perused their workes now more thē 1300. yeares, neuer noted such contradictions in

                           For all they say in this kind is reduced to one of these heads. First that Angels are not to be honored as The Minister here sayth: Some Fathers proue Christ to be God &amp; others that the Holy Ghost is God, because he heares the prayers of them, that Inuocate him euery where. Answer. This is false; they proue Christ and the Holy Ghost to be God because they are euery where by natrue. See S. Basil. de sp. Sancto. c. 22. whome the Minister falsifyeth egregiously. Gods, nor by sacrifices in the heathenish manner. Orig. lib. 5. cont. Celsum. &amp; lib. 8. circa finem. Epiphan. haeres. Sit in honore Maria, Deus adoretur. Theodoret. in c. 2. ad Coloss. &amp; Concil. Laodicenum c. 35.
                           Secondly, that Saints are not to be inuocated by Fayth, as In this manner is vnderstood the testimony of S. Athanaes. orat. 2. contra Arianos. cited by the Minister. pag. 295. ad lit. B. Sanctos non à Creato postulare vt auxiliator sit. S. Athanasius speakes of this prayer of Dauid, Fias mihi in Deum adiutorem, be thou made vnto me an helding God, he saith, that Saynts in this manner do not aske helpe of Creatures, to wit, as of their helping Gods and as Authours of benefits, otherwise S. Athanasius could not but know that the Scripture is full of examples wherein holy persons did aske the help of creature, as the Sanamite of Elizaeus, &amp; the womā of Sarepta of Elias, &amp; many the like▪

                           Thirdly, that the Preist doth not inuocate Saints by direct prayer in the Lyturgy of the Masse, which being a sacrifice the deuotion therof is to be directed to God onely. Augustine lib. 22. de ciuit. c. 10. Carthag. 4. c. 23.

This onely we require, that ignorant people be not Iudges of such inferences; an office so farre aboue their capacity, as I am perswaded no vnlearned man that hath in him any sparke of humility, or any mediocrity of Iudgement, will vndertake it. For no man is competent to iudge assuredly of argumēts by deduction frō Scripture, that hath not exact skill of Scripture to know the false sense from the true, as of Logicke, to distinguish Syllogismes from Paralogismes, being able to giue sentence of the truth of principles by the one, and of the inferences by the other; A thing so hard as euen learned Deuines do much suspect their owne sufficiency to iudge of deductions, &amp; dare not absolutely pronounce their sentence, but referre the same to definitions of authority, which besides skill of Scripture &amp; Logicke hath the promise of Gods perpetuall assistance in teaching the Christian Church. Wherfore if Protestants will bind vs to bring expresse Scripture for the worship of Imags, Adoration of the Sacrament, Inuocation of Saintes, they must themselues likewise be bound to bring expresse Scripture against Anabaptists for

Dayes in memory of the

Apostles with religious solemnity, for the Concerning the Crosse in baptisme, the Minister saith pag. 302. that it is a thing Adiaphorous, &amp; therfore expresse scripture is needles to warrant it. But I aske him, whether it be Adiaphorous to thinke and to say, that the vse of the Crosse in baptisme is superstitious, impious, Antichristian? if it be Adiaphorous so to thinke and to say, why cōdemne they the Puritans in this respect? if it be wicked and impious so to thinke and speake, then is it impious and vnchristian to reiect deuotious and religious offices practised in the Sacraments, vpō pretence that they be not prescribed by Scriptures. And then further it is consequent, that Protestants who condemne Inuocation of saints as impious, superstitious, antichristiā, cā

And if deductiō from Scripture, or consonancy therwith be sufficient to warrant these customes, why should they mislike the Worship, and Inuocation of Saints, for which (besides the Iudgements of the most flourishing and learned Antiquity that euer was since the Apostles daies, to wit the Fathers of the fourth Age confessedly consenting with vs) we bring more cleere warrant from Scripture, then they can bring for the before mentioned obseruation of them religiously kept?
                     
                     
                        Knowledge of prayers made to them communicable, &amp; communicated vnto Saints. §. 3.
                        THE second cause why Protestants dislike praying to Saints, is, for that they thinke by teaching, that Saints heare our petitiōs, we attribute vnto thē knowledge proper to God onely. For Saints cannot know all prayers made to them without seeing at once what is done in euery part of the world, nor know the sincere deuotion wherwith they are done, without seeing the secret affection of mens harts. But to know what is done in all parts of the world, &amp; the secrets of harts, is knowledge proper to God.
                        
                           To this exception answer is made, that knowledge proper to God is of two kinds, the one so proper as it is altogether incō
                           municable with any creature, and such is the comprehension of his diuine Essence. The secōd is proper so, that naturally creatures are not capable therof, yet the same may be imparted vnto them by a supernaturall light, eleuating them to a high &amp; diuine state aboue the possibility of nature. In this kind is the visiō of the diuine essence face to face, which being by nature proper vnto God onely, is by grace granted vnto Saints. And if this vision be communicated vnto Saints, the sight of the inferiour world, and of the secrets of hart, is without cause reputed incommunicable with them, according to the saying of S. Prosper: 
                              De vita Contempl. l. 5. c. 4. Non latebit beatos aliquid secretorū, quod est longè praestantius puris cordibus visuri sunt Deum. 
                           Nothing is so secret as the knowledge therof may be denyed vnto the perfectly blessed, their seing God with pure vnderstanding being without comparison a thing more excellent.
                        
                        Thus S. Prosper, whose argument doth cōuince that Saints may know both what is done in the world &amp; the secrets of harts.

                              1. Cor. 13.12. cleerly and distinctly the diuine Essence, with the infinite 
                              Ioan. 3.2. beautyes and perfections therof. How then can a Christian conceaue so meanely of them as to doubt whether they haue sufficient These arguments are broght not to proue that the Saints haue this knowledge, but only that this knowledge is not so proper of God, but creatures may by grace be participant thereof. Wherfore the Minister seing the Iesuite to demonstrate his purpose agaynst Protestants, to wit, the knowledge of thinges done in all parts of the world, and of secrets of hart to be cōmunicable vnto B. Creatures, and this so cleerly as he had not what to reply, he peruerteth all these arguments, affirming pag. 305. l. 1. That the Iesuite argueth in this sort: Saints see the face of God. Ergo, They behold the secrets of harts. and lin. 17. That his argument is, They which know or see the greater, understand and behold the lesse. But the Saints behold the Essence of God which is greater. Ergo. These be the Ministers fictions, not the Iesuits arguments. For to proue that the blessed may see secrets of hart, and all thinges done in the world, the Iesuite argueth in this manner vnanswerably. They that haue sufficient vnderstanding for greater and more excellent knowledge, haue sufficient vnderstanding for lesser knowledge; and if greater knowledge be not aboue the eleuated capacity of a creature, then lesser is not. But Saints haue sufficient vnderstanding for the cleere vision of God, and so this knowledge, the greatest of all others, is not perfection aboue that of which creatures are capable by grace. Therfore, knowledge of all things done in all parts of the world, and of secrets of hart, which is lesse high, excellent, and difficill then the vision of God, is communicable by grace vnto creatures: and consequently the Protestants vulgar Argument, that Catholikes make Saints equall vnto God, by teaching that they see mens harts, and all thinges done in the world, is friuolous. vnderstāding to behold things done in this inferiour world, as far as they belōg to their state? Secondly as for the secrets of harts, God is without comparison more spirituall, more secret, more inuisible, and out of the sight of naturall vnderstanding then is any the most secret thought of man, or Angell; and yet the Saints haue so cleere penetrating, &amp; all discouering light, as they do most perspicuously discerne the diuine, hidden, &amp; vnsearchable Essence. What reason is there then why Christians should think the secrets of mens harts inuisible and vnsearchable vnto them? If we looke into Scripture, as the heart 
                              Hierem. 17.9. of man is sayd to be vnsearchable but to God only, so God likewise is sayd to

be 
                              Coloss. 1.15.3. 1. Timoth. 1.17. inuisible, but only to himselfe; so that to Saints, togeather with the sight of harts, we must deny the sight of God, or els interprete the sayings of Scripture, that mans hart, and God are inuisible, to wit, by meere naturall light, and that both are visible vnto Saints, by that light whereof the Prophet sayd; 
                              Psal. 35.10. In thy light we shall see the light. If there were a This doctrine of the Glasse, or Mirrour, is brought to shew the possibility how things may be seene in God, not to prooue that of necessity they are seen: and so the Minister might haue spared the paper in citing the opinions of Schoolemē cōcerning the doctrin of the Volūtary glasse. glasse of diamant so cleere and excellent that whatsoeuer is done in London in secretest corners should therein particularly and distinctly appeare, surely he that hath eyes to see that glasse, may likewise discerne what is done ouer the Citty. Now, most certayne it is, that in God all creatures, all actions done in the world, and all the most secret thoughts of harts, so perspicuously and distinctly shine as they are in themselues. So that the Saints hauing light to see the diuine Essence, may in him cleerly discerne whatsoeuer is done in the world belōging to their state though neuer so secret, according to the saying of S. 
                              Basil. lib. de Virgin.

It is ridiculous when you are pressed with the cleere text of Scripture to call vpon the anciēt Church; you I say, who still, specially in this question, appeale from the ancient Fathers vnto the Scripture, as pag. 302. and 298. you say that it is not iust to make ancient custome a law &amp; rule of right doctrine. And if you will stand to the rule of antiquity, I can produce more then fifty ancient Fathers that in expresse tearmes teach the doctrine the Iesuit doth establish by the literall sense of Gods word, to wit, that saints deceased are rulers and gouernours of mens actions &amp; liues. Secondly, you say pag. 309. that the text of the Apocalyps, To him that shall haue conquered I will giue him power &amp;c. is not vnderstood of Saints deceased, but of liuing Saints. Answere. This to be false is apparent, by the very words which are these. Apoc. 226. He that shall haue conquered &amp; kept my words VNTIL THE END, to him I will giue power ouer nations &amp;c. But it is cleer that liuing Saints cānot be said to haue conquered, much lesse to haue kept the word of God vntil

For our Lord in the Apocalips promiseth that he will giue to Saints power to gouerne in a rod of iron nations &amp; countryes, as his father promised, &amp; gaue the same power vnto him, to wit in the aforesaid Psalme. But that place of the Psalme is without doubt to be vnderstood of Christs power of gouernement in this world, and of his ruling in the militant Church, as Protestants grant, &amp; it appeareth by the wordes precedent, I will giue thee nations to be thine inheritance, and thou shalt rule them in a rod of yron. Ergo, the power of gouerning i

But Scripture in playne and expresse tearmes make Saints participate with Christ in the rule and gouernement of the world, according to his promise Because the Minister doth so much insult that the Iesuit hath not proued any thinge by Scripture, I will (that his folly may appeare) examine particularly his answere vnto these texts. 
                           Apocalip. 2.26. To him that conquereth I will giue power ouer nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, that is, with power of inflexible equity. And Apocal. 3. v. 12. I will make him a pillar in the Tēple of my God. And the blessed say of themselues Apoc. 5.10. that they were chosen out of countreys and nations to be Priests of God, &amp; that they should rule with him vpon the earth. Therfore they know what is done vpon earth, so far forth at least, as the affayres of earth doe specially appertaine vnto them; and such without doubt

are our deuotions towardes them.
                        Secondly, S. Paul Cor. 14.26. sayth: Now we know but in part, we prophesy but in part, but when that of perfection shall come, that of part shall be euacuated: I know now but in part, thē I shall know as I am known. By which words the Apostle signifyes that all knowledge both humane &amp; diuine, particularly the gift of Prophesy is contayned eminently in the beatificall

                           ight; so that the blessed Saints haue the gift of Prophesy in a more excellent degree thē had the Prophets in this world. But by the light of Prophesy holy men vnited with God, could see the secrets of harts, as S. Paul sayth 1. Cor. 14.15. By the gift of Prophesy the secrets of harts are manyfested; and also see things absent being present by light of vnderstāding, frō whence they were absent

according to their substance The Minister seketh two wayes to euade. First by denying that blessed Saints haue the knowledge of prophesy in a more excellent and permanent manner then haue the Prophets in this life. This is plaine against the words of the Apostle cited by the Answerer. For the Apostle affirm
                                 •
                               that the gift of Prophesy in this life is but ex parte, imperfect in respect of th

                              ut then the imperfect shall be euacuated 
                           To Answere the Ministers Cauill, that the place of S. Augustine is vnderstood onely of Saints after their resurrection; Note, that although the Father name the Saints in their glorified bodyes, yet his reason conuinceth the same of soules that be blessed before the resurrection. For his reason why the Saints after the resurrection shal see the secrets of harts, and things frō which they are substātially distant, is because thē they shall Prophesy, not in parte but fully, &amp; euacuabitur quod ex parte est, all imperfection of knowledge shall be euacuated; but the deceased soules of Saints now before the resurrection do Prophesy not in part, but know as they are kowne, all imperfection of knowledge being euacuated from them. Ergo, they see things absent, and secrets of harts now, no lesse then they shall do then.. This is that which S. Hierome doth defend To earnestly against Vigilantius, that the soules of the Martyrs are present where their shrines and reliques are, &amp; neuer absent but still ready to heare the prayers of their suppliāts, not thinking that they are present in so many places substantially according to their soules, but that they are presēt, as Elizaeus was present vnto Giezi in Spirit, beholding what passed as cleerly as if they were corporally present.
                        Thirdly, it is cleerely to be proued by Scripture, that holy Angels see the prayers and actions, and affections of men. In the Apocalip. c. 8.4. An Angell offered vnto God the prayers of men, which he could not haue done, had he not knowne them The Minister pag. 314. lin. 12. saith, this place is vnderstood not of an Angell by nature, but of an Angell by type. Answer. We must vnderstand the word of God in the literall sense, except we can cleerly demonstrate by Scripture the literal sense to be absurd. And this obligation doth more specially lye vpon Protestants, who from perpetuall Tradition appeale vnto Scripture vnderstood by exact conference of places, as vnto the last and supreme Iudge. But you bring not one word of Scripture to proue that in this place an Angell by nature cannot be vnderstood, therfore you runne to types and tropicall senses without warrant of Scripture, by which yet you pretend you will be finally tryed. Are you not then a ridiculous, and vaine Appellant?.

Our Sauiour witnesseth Luc. 15.10. That the Angells reioyce at the conuersion of a sinner. So they must needs know it, nor can they know it without knowing the sinners harte The Minister pag. 315. lin. 15. obiects against this argument that holy men on earth reioyce at the conuersion of sinners, yet they know not secrets of harts, therfore this argumēt is not good: Angells reioice in the conuersion of sinners: Ergo they know the secret pious affections of mēs harts. Answer. The ioy of iust men in this life is imperfect and mingled with feare, nor do they reioyce in re, in the thing, but in spe, in the hope that mens cōuersions are sincere, and in the outward signes therof. But the blessed Angells ioy is perfect, deuoid of feare, &amp; they reioyce not in the hope but in the thing &amp; conuersion it selfe. Therfore they must know the inward piety and deuotion of the soule., Conuersion not being true, no
                              •
                            worthy of ioy, except it proceed from the hart Although the places speake directly of the Blessed, that they shalbe like vnto Angells in incorruption of body, yet it proueth the same of beatitude of soules. For seeing the glory of body floweth from the glory of the soule, Blessed Saints should not be like to the Angells in glory of body, were they not like, and their equalls in the blessed sight and vision their soules haue of God, and of things contained in him.. S. Paul sayth we are made a spectacle vnto God and Angells, &amp; he adiureth Timothy by God and his Angells, which sheweth that we liue in the sight of Angels, &amp; that they behold what we doe, and heare what we say euen in our harts. But as the same Scripture Luc. 20.36. Math. 22.30. auerreth, the Saints are like vnto the Angells, and equall vnto the Angells. And in heauē the same is the measure of a man &amp; of an Angell, Apocal. 21.17. Aug. ep. 112. Ergo, knowledge of our prayers is not to be denyed to glorious Saints the fellowes of Angells. Neither could Saints without knowledge of humane affaires be perfectly blessed, Blessednes being a state wherin all iust and reasonable desires of nature are satisfyed with vttermost content, according to that of the Psalme. 16.15. Satiabor cùm apparuerit gloria tua. And who can

thinke that Saints full of glory and charity do not earnestly desire The Minister against this replyes pag. 319. saying: That the Saints desire to know no more then it is Gods will they should know. But it cannot be proued by Scripture, that it is Gods will they should know the things done on earth. Answere. We must still suppose that the courses, and wills of God be sutable to the nature of things, except the contrary be cleerly proued. The nature of charity is to desire to know the state of our freinds and their proceedings, and affections towards vs. Ergo, the Saints be

                        Wherefore our doctrine, that Saints see our prayers, being deliuered so constantly by the Ancient Fathers, so conformable vnto the principles of Christian beliefe about the blessednes of Saints, so consonāt vnto expresse passages of Scripture, we may iustly expect, that vnto Protestants it would not be displeasing did they looke on it with vnpartiall eyes: Specially they hauing no Text of Scripture that may make

so much as a shew of direct opposition agaynst it. The place continually obiected out of the Prophet Esay 63.16. Abraham knew vs not 
                           This place is impertinent also, in regard that Abraham and Iacob, were not thē Blessed nor saw God, from which Blessed vision the knowlege of things done in this world floweth as a sequell in the triumphant Saints. It is vnderstood by S. Hierome in c. 63. Isa. de scientia approbationis, that Abraham &amp; Iacob did not know, that is, esteeme and approoue the proceeding of their children the Iewes., Israel was ignorant of vs, thou O Lord art our Father, thou our Redeemer, hath this sense: Abraham and Iacob, when they liued vpon earth, and carnally begot children, did not know particularly their posterities, and so could not beare them such particular affection; whereas God can, &amp; doth distinctly see, and know their necessityes aforehand, yea before men are borne, and prouides agaynst them, deliuering his children out of thē. And therfore he is the only Father, the only Redeemer, Abraham and Iacob not deseruing the name of Father, in comparison with God. Makes this against the Saints hearing our prayers I desire the Reader to note on the one side how Protestants boast of Scriptures, &amp; on the other how vnable they are to bring one probable text agaynst Inuocation of Saints. Whereas contrarywise the places for the Catholicke doctrine that Saints

                               our prayers are so cleere as Protestāts fly to their types and tropes, leauing the literall sense without warrant from the sayd Scripture, and so by casting a figure euade frō Gods cleere word. Wherfore the cause they appeale vnto Scriptur, is not, because they thinke the Scripture is cleere for them, &amp; not much cleerer for vs; But because by Scripture they cannot be so cleerly confounded as by Tradition. For about Scripture Heretiks euer wrangle, pretending that by deductions and inferences they prooue their doctrine being destitute of formall Scripture, wherof ignorāt people cānot iudge. For what know they when deductions are good? But when they were vrged by Tradition to shew the Pedegree of their Professours, they were as dumbe as ours now are, that the Fathers said vnto them, Confingant tale aliquod, let thē if they can feigne and deuise a pedegree of professours agreeing in the same forme of Faith wherof the first was an Apostle, and the last a Protestant??
                     
                     
                        The worship in Spirit and Truth, with outward prostration of the body due vnto Saints. §. 3.
                        
                        THE third cause of their dislike is that we giue the honour of the Creatour vnto the Creature, honoring Saints with Religious worship in spirit &amp; truth, euen to the prostrating of our bodyes before them, whereby we giue them honour due to God only, and bring in many Gods, as the Heathens did.
                        To this Obiection made long agoe by Faustus the Manichee, S. Augustine lib. 20. cont. Faust. c. 22. answereth in these words: The Christian people doth celebrate with Religious

solemnity the memoryes of Martyrs, to the end to stirre vp themselues to their imitatiō, &amp; that they may be assisted with their prayers, and associated vnto their merits &amp;c. But with the worship tearmed in Greeke Latria, and which the Latine language cannot expresse in one word, being a certayne subiection, &amp; seruitude due properly to the Deity only, we do not honour any but only God, nor thinke that this honour ought to be giuen but only to him. These words of S. Augustine shew, that worship of Saints to be on the one side more then Ciuil, and on the other side lesse then diuine; more then ciuill, as proceeding out of acknowledgement of the excellency Saints haue superiour vnto all naturall, by which they be partakers of diuine perfection in that high degree as no substance can by nature participate thereof, and therefore S. Augustine with good reason tearmes it religious The Minister pag. 312. contrary to his custome proposeth this argument truly: To euery kind of excellēcy there is a worship due proportionall to that excellency: but the blessed Saints and Angells haue a speciall kind of excellency, which is supernatural, superhumane, more then ciuill. Therefore speciall honour proportionall to the excellency, and superior vnto humane and ciuill, is due vnto them. To this argument he answereth, That in Saints there is dignity of grace and glory, and honour is due in respect of the same, but not religious worship. Thus he: what is this but to trifle &amp; talke in the ayre? who doubts (M. White) but there is the dignity of grace and glory in Saints, and honour due vnto it? Speake plainly and mutter not betwixt the teeth. Is the honour due to Saints proportionall to their excellency, that is, more then ciuill? Is it superhumane &amp; supernaturall as their excellency is? Is it superiour vnto that kind of honour which is due vnto ciuill magistrates and other human honourable personages in regard of meere naturall perfectiō? If you grant, that worship superhumane, and more then ciuill is due vnto Saints, you grant as much as we desire to proue. The tearme of Religious worship is ambiguous. Sometimes religious worship is taken for that which is an elicitiue &amp; formall act of Religion, &amp; of diuine worship due vnto the increated excellency of the Creatour. In this sense the worship of Saints is not religious. At other tymes it is taken for worship which is an imperatiue act of Religion, that is, worship done to Saints out of inward Religion and deuotion towards God, whose seruants and friends they are. In this sense the worship of Saints is Religious, because it doth still proceed, and must needes flow frō inward reuerence towards God. For how can one worship Saints purely and only as they are the friends, seruants, and temples of God, but out of the instinct of Religion vnto God? Hence S. Augustine tearmes the honor of Saints Religious solemnity. And S. Chrysostome sayth Serm. de Martyr. 69. That we admire their merits with Religious charity.
                           . Lesse then diuine, as proceeding from persuasion of excellency though super-human yet infinitly inferiour vnto the increate &amp; immense excellency of God, yea depending essentially therof. So that honour that is giuen to thē dependeth of God, as being superexcellent participants of his perfection, &amp; his singular friends.
                        Now, that men may worship Angells and Saints in this sort with true affection of spirit, euen to the prostration of their bodyes may be proued out of holy Scriptures, supposing what is already shewed,

that they see our actions. For if Saints see our actions we may as lawfully and as profitably bow, kneele, and prostrate our bodyes vnto them, as vnto Saints liuing on earth. But it is lawfull to honour liuing Saints with bowing, &amp; kneeling, and prostration of body as may be proued by many examples. 3. Reg. 18. Abdias an holy man Timebat Dominum valde., adored Elias

That Elias, Elizaeus, and the Angels were present visibly and sensibly, but the Saints are not sensibly present, &amp; so we must not bow vnto Saints deceased, as Children kneele not to their parents when they are absent. Answer. We haue proued by the word of God that to be true which the Fathers teach with full consent namely S. Basill de Virgin. c. 16. Euery Angell &amp; holy Spirit of Saints, see what is done euery where. And if this be true that they are present vnto vs, and we a spectacle vnto them, why should we not worship thē as much as if they were sensibly present? Not sense, but faith is the ground of our deuotion towards Saints. May we worship Saints that are present to vs according to the iudgemēt of flesh, and not worship them that are present according to the Iudgement of fayth, and the truth of Gods word? with more then human &amp; naturall respect, and with acknowledgement of more then humane and naturall perfections in them, is cleerly deduceable from holy Scripture. Neither haue Protestants reason to stand agaynst so many pregnant examples of Scriptures vpon the one example in the Apocalyps of the Angell refusing to be adored of S. Iohn, saying: See thou do it not, I am one of thy fellow seruants, adore God, specially this place being explicated long agoe by the Fathers, as not against the custome of Christiā Saint-worship;

for eyther the Angell so appeared as Saint Iohn tooke him to be God, &amp; would haue adored him as God, whereof the adorer was to be warned as S. Augustine 
                           
                              S. August. q. 61. in Genes. Corrigendus erat adorator. expoundeth, or rather the Angell for bad that worship, not as iniurious vnto God, but only as coumbersome to himselfe, being loath (as S. Gregory noteth) after the incarnation of the Sonne of God to see a man lye prostrate vnto him, specially so holy a man and so speciall a friend of Iesus. And the words, Do it not, adore God, import no more, which I declare. Suppose that one prayse a Preacher to his face for an excellent sermon he hath made, &amp; the Preacher out of modesty say, Prayse not me, I am an vnworthy instrument of diuine wisdome, prayse the authour of all: This his speach doth not import that he thinkes to commend a Preachers sermon to be Idolatry, &amp; giuing away the glory of God to a creature, but only that modesty makes him wish that men would not prayse him, but rather turne all the prayse &amp; glory of that sermon vpon God. In this sort the Angell seing the great and glorious friend of Iesus prostrated at his fee
                              •
                           e, requested him to rise vp, not condemning that adoration as Idolatrous, but refusing it as an actiō (though in regard of the offerer pious &amp; godly, yet to him the receauer cūbersome) which he could not without some vnwillingnes behold, in regard of the dignity of the person

he saw prostrated before him The Minister in this place is large in bitternes against vs, because he knowes not what to say, or how to frame an argument against vs out of this text of the Apocalips. For if S. Iohn did giue diuine and religious worship to the Angel due to God onely, the example is not to the purpose. For we say Saints are not to be honoured as Gods. If he did onely offer honour more then ciuill vnto the Angell in respect of his supernaturall dignity, with prostration of body, then the same was not vnlawfull. For the Minister pag. 336. lin. 30. forced by the Iesuits arguments, doth acknowledge such obe
                                    •
                                 sances, and reuerent comportments may, and must be done to Saints and Angels, when they are corporally &amp; visibly present, as his Angell was visibly and corporally present to S. Iohn. Now that this great Apostle of Christ was more ignorant then any Triuiall Minister, that he knew not what was due vnto Angels better then they, who will belieue? It is euident that he offered no more then he might without iniury vnto God, else being warned he would not haue offered it the second tyme. Therfore it was honour that might piously be giuen vnto an Angell, though that Angel did in modesty forbid him, to shew the respect he bare to that great Apostle and friend of Iesus, as the Iesuit argueth, to which the Minister replyes not a word, but only rayleth.. This is euidently gathered out of the sacred text, seing S. Iohn after this prohibition did the second tyme offer the like honour to the same Angell; which he would neuer haue done, had he not knowne adoration of Angells by mortall men, to be pious &amp; religious on their parts, howsoeuer the Angells sometimes, for iust respects, may in modesty refuse it.
                     
                     
                        Praying to Saints not iniurious to Gods mercy, but rather a commendation thereof. §. 4.
                        
                        THE fourth cause why Protestants out of their zeale refuse to inuocate Saints is the high conceite of Gods mercy. For seing he calleth all men immediatly vnto himselfe, 
                              Matth. 11.18. 
                           Come vnto me all you that labour and I will refresh you, we wrong his infinite goodnes in not approaching vnto him by prayer, without the intercessions of Saints.
                        
                           This their zeale is not ioyned with Science of the course of Gods mercyfull prouidence, whose diuine wisdome prescribeth certayne bounds, &amp; as it were Lawes to the infinity of his mercyes. These orders and prescripts whosoeuer doth neglect, &amp; yet hopes to obtaine fauours, doth not truly confide but erroneously presume. God is infinitely mercyfull, and sayth, Come to me all that labour, yet the man that should seeke to him for remission of sinnes, and would not submit himselfe to the Sacrament of water, should hope in vayne, &amp; to no purpose challenge him of his promise, Come to me all. Wherefore it imports vs very much to know, and to vse those meanes of approaching vnto God that he hath appointed. Now, that the intercession of Saints is one meanes without which God wil not bestow many graces &amp; fauours aswell spirituall as temporall, Christian Tradition doth deliuer vnto vs. This Tradition is also sutable with the bountifull and noble disposition of God, which is not only to 1. Reg. 2.30. honour &amp; glorify those that haue beene zealous of his honour to the effusion of their bloud, but also to make the world know and vnderstand that he doth honour them 
                              Psalm. 1.38.17.; for this knowledge is both for his glory, and also for the good of men, that seing how highly God honoreth his constant friends they be prouoked to endeauour by pure life to gaine his fauour.
                        
                           If reuealed doctrine comming by succession of Bishops from the Apostles to vs will not alone wyn beliefe in this point, euen the Scriptures affoard vs sufficient testimonyes thereof. When Abimelech King of Gesara, had offended God by taking away from Abraham his wife Sara, and penitent of the fact, (though committed but in ignorance) sought for pardon, did not God himselfe send him vnto Abraham, saying, 
                              Genes. 20. vers. 8. 
                           Restore his wife vnto the man for he is a Prophet, and he will pray for thee, and thou shalt liue? By which example we see, that Gods infinite mercy, who sayth, Come to me all, will not many tymes bestow graces and fauours, without intercession of his Saints, that men may know he loues &amp; respects his friends. When he was offended against Eliphas and his companions, did he not send them vnto his singularly beloued seruant The example of the freinds of Iob is not particular, but for the instruction of all, as S. Paul saith; Whatsoeuer is written, is written for our instruction, and comfort. Rom. 15.4. Hence it followes that whatsoeuer is said to one person in Scripture is said to euery one of the same state in whom the same circumstāces do concurre, whether it be spoken by way of promise, or warning, or threate. The promise made vnto Abraham Gen. 15.2. I am thy protectour, agrees vnto all men that are as he was, deuout worshippers of the true God. What the Angell spake vnto Agar, Gen. 16.9. Returne vnto thy Mistresse, and be humbled vnder her, is also spoken vnto euery proud fugitiue seruant. Now these words spoken to the freinds of Iob, Go to my seruant, and my seruant shall pray for you, and his presence I will regard, were spoken to them in regard they had offended God, &amp; did find that God would not heare their single prayers. Therfore this precept belongs vnto all men that know they haue offended God and find their prayers not to be heard, and togeather feele the instinct of sacred humility to seeke accesse vnto God by some of his seruants, whom they know to be more gratious then themselues, and able to helpe. And who more gratious with God &amp; able to helpe vs then tryumphant Saints, as hath been proued? Therfore this precept is a warrant and an order vnto all men being in the same state &amp; circumstances of Gods offence as the freinds of Iob were, to seeke and require the assistance &amp; intercession of Gods Blessed Saynts. What the Minister here discourseth is all spoken in the ayre vpon his owne foolish imagination and fancy, agaynst the full Traditiō of the Church, and playne Scripture, to wit, that Saynts deceased be not the friends and fauorits of God, that can help vs with him. 
                           Iob, that he might be a mediatour for them? Ite ad seruum meum Iob, &amp; offerte holocaustum pro vobis; Iob autem seruus meus orabit pro vobis, faciem eius suscipiam vt non vobis imputetur stultitia. Iob. 42. vers. 8. Out of which place two thinges are cleerly

gathered. First, that though Gods mercy be infinite, yet many tymes he will not grant our prayers, but in such manner as he will make vs beholding to his Saints. Secondly, that we ought to prostrate our prayers vnto him, as with great confidence in his goodnes, so likewise with a most feeling humble distrust of our owne worthynes; which affection cannot but mooue vs to seeke the intercession of them we know to be most highly gracious in his fauour. So that vpon pretence of Gods great mercy, to reiect the mediation of Saints, is zeale without Science, deuotion not throughly instructed about the lawes and orders that God hath prescribed vnto his measurelesse mercy, by his incomprehensible wisdome. And if we grieue to humble our selues vnto Saints and repine at Gods prouidence, that he will not many tymes grant our supplications without honouring his Saints, and making vs bound vnto them, we may iustly expect to heare what he sayd to one in like case: Friend, I do thee no wrong, may I not dispense my mercyes as I please? If I will bestow them in such sort as to ioyne togeather with thy good the honour of my friends, Is thine eye euill because I am good, and courteous to thē
                           
that haue loued me more then their owne liues The Minister pag. 334. lin. 6. cauilleth, That the Iesuits discourse is such as one may wonder, and aske whether such discoursers euer heard that the sonne of God was crucified for vs? Answer. This cauill is at the least idle, if not impious, for it maketh as much against the discourse of God himselfe, who said to the freinds of Iob, Go to my seruant Iob, and he shall pray for you, and him I will regard in your behalfe, without mention of Christ Iesus. Will the Minister here wonder and aske, whether God did know and remember that his Sonne was to be crucified for men, and that mē could obtaine nothing of him but in regard of his future passion and merit? God forbid he should be so captious. For the merits &amp; intercessions of Saints be no dishonour to the only merit &amp; mediatiō of Christ, yea they all flow from it. Hence the merit of Christ is euer supposed &amp; inuolued in all meanes and helpes of saluation, nor is it necessary euery where to name it.?
                     
                     
                        Inuocation of Saints not an iniury but an honor to Christ the only Mediatour. §. 5.
                        
                        ANOTHER shew of piety is pretended against prayer vnto Saints, that it seemes to ouerthrow the mediatourship of Christ, which Saint Paul 
                           1. Tim. 2.3. commends as only, vnus mediator Dei &amp; hominum Christus Iesus. But in shewing the vanity of this shadow, I shall not need to be long, seeing this respect would also make vs neglect &amp; not vse the mediation of liuing Saints out of feare of disanulling the only mediatourship of Christ. It is no more against the honour of the only mediatourship of Christ to pray vnto Saints deceased, then vnto Saints liuing; yea the praying vnto these kind of Saints may seeme more dishonourable, because we ioyne with him men imprisoned in mortality, militant in dangers, and not wanting some blemishes and defects. Wheras the other Saints are glorious, pure from any the least imaginable spot setled in the consummation of ineffable blisse. But the Scripture [Rom. 15.30. Iob. 42.8.] allowes, yea commandes prayer vnto liuing Saints, &amp; consequently praying

vnto them is not iniurious vnto the only mediatour Christ. Therfore the praying vnto Saints deceased that are in glory with God, is not iniurious vnto the only mediatourship of Christ 
                              The Minister is here pag. 335. vexed; for this argument of praying vnto liuing Saints and crauing their intercession cōuinceth &amp; stoppeth our Aduersaries mouthes whē they vrge that praying vnto glorious Saints destroieth the onely mediatour-ship of Christ. Why should praying vnto glorious Saints &amp; to seeke their mediatiō be iniurious vnto the onely mediatour-ship of Christ, rather then the mediation of liuing Saints?
                              His answere is large, but all is reduced to six euasions. First he saith, that we may request the prayers of liuing Saints but not inuocate them: this is ridiculous. For what is it to inuocate but to cal vpon, but to implore, but to request? specially with submission, and acknowledging of superhumane dignity in the person prayed vnto. Do not Protestants themselues translate Inuocate, to call vpō? Rom. 10.14. when the holy Sunamite with humble obeysance, prostrate on the ground, requested Elizaeus for the resuscitatiō of her Sonne, did she not inuocate him? Secondly he saith: That the liuing Saints be present with the liuing. What is this to the purpose? be not many mediatours present, more then one onely, aswell as many mediatours absent? If the onely mediatour may haue many subordinate mediatours present, without preiudice vnto the onelynes and singularity of his mediatour-ship, why not many subordinate mediatours absent? Nor is it true, that glorious Saints be not present vnto vs, seing they see as hath been proued, all things done in the world that belong to their state; in which respect the holy Fathers of better credit then any Minister, say, Vniuersi sancti vbique sunt &amp; omnibus prosunt. S. Maximus de Martyr. Tauricis. Hieron. aduersus Vigilant. &amp; Basil. de Sanct. virgin. c. 8. Angeli vbique praesentes sunt, &amp; quae hic geruntur inspiciunt. Saints and Angells are euery where present, because from heauē they behold what is euery where done. Fourthly he saith, That Papists make Saints mediatours that see the secrets of harts. This is also seely. For where doth the Scripture say that Christ is the onely mediatour that knowes the secretts of hartes, but that besides him there may be other mediatours, so they see not the hart? If Christ the onely mediatour may haue the company of many subordinate mediators, that be clothed with misery and ignorance, why not the cō
                                 pany of many glorious mediators that see God and in God our harts? How many liuing Saints did by the gift of prophesy see the secret thoughts of men, &amp; yet did pray and intercede for men that craued their patronage? Did they therby ouerthrow the only mediatour-ship of Christ? God forbid. Fiftly he saith, that as it is an iniury to the supreme Magistrate, for any of his subiects to cō
                                    stitute a Maister of Requests without his authority; so likewise it is an iniury to Christ for vs wormes of the earth, without warrant from Gods word, to constitute Saints and Angels mediatours of our prayers. Answer. The Minister is very simple i
                                    •
                                  he cānot discerne the difference betwixt a maister of Requests, and a mediatour to the King by way of fauour. The Maister of Requests, is an office of authority made by the kings authority, without whose special order he cannot be appointed. But the office of mediator, that is, of a freind for vs with the king, is an office of grace and fauour, and made by the kings grace &amp; fauour, bestowed on a man without any further authority. Hence if the king make one his familiar Freind or Fauourite, we may (if we can) make him our freind and mediatour vnto the king, without further warrant or authority. Yea sometimes Kings are not willing that their Fauourites should haue so many suitors, which yet they cannot hinder if they will haue Fauourites, the right of being mediatours for others to the King, being inuolued in the grace of Princely fauours. Now to say, that men seeking grace of the king by his Fauorite, do constitute without his order a Maister of Requests, is ridiculous. Yea rather it were folly, presumption, clownishnes for a poore beggar vnknowne in the Court to intrude his suites into the Kings audience without the mediation of some that are familiar about him. Wherfore seing God hath made Saints his especiall freinds, and heauenly fauourites, and able to helpe vs, what further warrant is needfull, besides our owne necessityes, to seeke their intercession? Sixtly, the Minister saith, That liuing Saints are ioint-suitors with vs, who likewise pray for their owne needes, and so are not meere mediatours. But Saints deceased be not ioint-suitors, but meere mediatours, because they pray and intercede for vs, and not for themselues. Answer. First the Saints in heauen do pray for themselues, to wit, for the glorious resuscitation of their bodyes, and that God will reueng their deathes vpon their persecutours, Apoc. 5. Secondly, though Saints do not deprecate for their owne sinnes, and needes, this doth not shew that they are meere mediatours and suitors of higher kind then liuing Saints, but onely that they are growne vnto greater perfection in the same kind of grace, and vnto the consummation therof, vnto which we are not yet arriued. Euen as a growne man doth not need so many things as doth the Child, and yet is he a creature of the same nature and 
                                    •
                                 ind as the Child.
                           .
                        I adde, that to make Saints mediatours subordinate vnto, &amp; dependent of Christ, is to increase his glory. For first, if only Christ Iesus is worthy to haue immediate accesse vnto God, and all other Saints men &amp; Angells be mediatours and intercessours, not hauing accesse vnto God but by him, then certainly that Saints mediate and intercede for vs, is exceeding glorious vnto Christ Iesus. But Catholikes teach that Saints be such intercessours as haue no accesse vnto God, but through Christ Iesus, by mediation of his merits, passion, and death, there being no other name in heauen or in earth by which we are to be saued. Therfore the doctrine that maks Saints subordinate mediatours vnto Christ by him approaching vnto God, doth magnify and extoll the supremacy of Christs mediatourship, more then if in this kind of mediation he had none depending on him.
                        Whence I inferre, that Protestants mistake our doctrine when they say we teach that Saints are fellow-mediatours with Christ, and that we bring them in to supply the defect of his intercessiō that otherwise would not be sufficient. This we doe neither teach, nor belieue, but that the merits

of Christ are infinite, euery drop of his pretious bloud able to pay the full ransome of a milliō of worlds. That the Saints mediate and intercede for vs vnto Christ, is for his greater glory, by whose merits they are made worthy of that dignity, and whom by their intercessions they acknowledge to be the fountayne of all good that comes vnto mankind. If it be a glory to the roote of a tree to haue many boughes and branches loaden with excellent fruite, the Saints being but branches of Christ Iesus the true Vine-tree, Iohn 15.15. surely the honour of all their meritts springs originally, &amp; is referred finally vnto him. And as it is impossible to honour and prayse the boughes without honouring and praysing of the roote: So likewise it is not possible that Catholikes, who acknowledge that Saints haue all their grace merit &amp; fauour with God from Christ Iesus, should honor them, or pray vnto them, without honouring Christ, &amp; without praying finally euer vnto him.
                        Wherefore Saints when they pray for vs that God would forgiue vs our sinnes, grant vs fauours that help vs towards eternall life, they do not alleadge their merits as a sufficient motiue of the grant, but the merits of Christ. And when holy ancient Fathers in their prayers alleadge vnto God the merits of Saints, this is because their merits make them gracious in Gods sight,

and worthy that the graces they craue for vs be graunted vnto vs, not by the applicatiō of their merits, but only through the application of the merits of Christ. Put case, that a Prince should ransome a great multitude of his subiects taken prisoners, and held in miserable thraldome, paying for them a sufficient and aboundant ransome, yet so, that none should haue the fruit of that Redemption but those whom the King should singularly choose, and make worthy of that fauour. Suppose that some noble man in the Court (whome his Merits made gracious with the King) should by his interceding obtayne that the benefit of that ransome should be extended to some one whome he particularly affects: Surely this Captiue should be redeemed &amp; deliuered through the ransome payd by the King, not by the merits of the Noble man interceding for him, whose merits concurred thereunto only remotely, and a farre off.
                        To apply this similitude, Christ Iesus hath payd an aboundant price for mans redēption, yet none enioy the benefits thereof, but they to whome by speciall grace he applyeth the same. Sinners beseech him by the merits of Saints that made them gracious in his sight, that he will vouchsafe to apply the merit of his Passion vnto them for the obtayning of fauours conducing vnto eternall life. Christ grants their petition

and request, and thereupon applyes his merits vnto them: These men cannot be properly sayd to be saued through the merits of Saints, but only through the merits of Christ, specially because euen the merits of Saints that concurred thereunto, proceed originally from the merits of CHRIST.
                     
                     
                        How it is lawfull to appropriate the obtayning of graces, and cures vnto Saints. §. 6.
                        
                        OVR Aduersaryes finding our Inuocation of Saints for substance practised in Gods Church euer since her primitiue times, take exceptiōs at some circumstances therof, which they thinke new, &amp; not iustifiable by Antiquity, which are principally three, whereon are grounded other three causes of their dislike.
                        So the sixt reason of their dislike is, that we distribute amongst Saints offices of curing diseases, &amp; seeke some kind of fauour of one, some of another, of which practise there is no example in Antiquity; yea it seemes to resemble the leuity of heathenish superstitiō, who did multiply Gods according to the multitude of the thinges they sought to obtayne of them.
                        I answere, that to seeke some fauours by the intercession of one Saint rather then of

another, was the Iudgment The Minister saith The Iesuit by Fathers, meaneth the Trident Fathers not the ancient Fathers. This is ridiculous, for the Iesuit saith the ancient Fathers in S. Augustines time, that is, 12. hundred yeares before the Councell of Trident. And the Minister cannot find one Syllable in the Coūcel of Trent for this appropriatiō, that may breed suspition that the Iesuit meaneth them, wheras he brings the practise and patronage of Saint Augustine himselfe, prouing by Scripture this appropriation of miraculous benefits, to one place, and Saint, more then to another. And S. Paul ad Hebr. 2.10. saying, wherin himselfe suffered, and was tempted, therin he is potent to helpe them that are tempted, shewes a reason why we should inuocate in some temptations, rather some Saint then another, as S. Laurence against fire, S. Apollonia against the tooth-ach &amp;c. because wherein themselues were tryed they are specially able to help others. of the Fathers in S. Augustines time which he himselfe practised vpon this occasion. In the towne of Hippo, one of the family of S. Augustine accused a Priest of an heynous crime, making his accusatiō good by oath, which the other did reiect, in like manner purging himselfe by oath. The fact being open and scandalous seing of necessity one of them was periured, S. Augustine sent them both into Italy to the shrine of Saint Felix of Nola, at whose reliques periured persons were vsually discouered. In defence

of which fact he writes an Epistle to his people of Hippo, allowing of this proceeding, shewing that to seeke recourse rather to one Saint then another is pious and godly, wondering at the secret prouidence of God therein: The Minister sayth, that this narration is not to the purpose, because there is no mention of Inuocation of S. Felix, or of oblation to him. Answer. This is idle. For we haue proued by S. Augustine, and Fathers, and Scriptures that Saintes are to be prayed vnto: only the question now is, whether it be lawfull to seeke some benefits at one place, and by one Saint, rather then another: which to be lawfull S. Augustine affirmes and proueth by deduction from Scripture, shewing it to haue beē the practise of his age, and not heathenish superstition. And though the Minister raile against this practise, with many bitter new coyned phrases, it makes no matter; for what wise man will prefer words before proofes? a Minister before S. Augustine? As for the Inuocation of S. Felix in particular, with vowes and oblations at his Tombe, many testimonyes of S. Augustine, S. Paulinus, and Seuerus Sulpitius might be brought if there were need. 
                           Although (sayth he) men by experience see this to be true, yet who is able to discouer the Counsell of God, why in some places such miracles are done, in other places they are not? For is not Africa stored with shrines of blessed Martyrs? and yet doe we not know any such miracles to be done heere by their intercessions. For seing, as the Apostle sayth, all Saints haue not the gift of curing diseases, not all the knowledge to discerne spirits; so likewise at the shrines of all Martyrs these thinges are not done, because he will not haue them euery where done, who giueth to euery one particular gifts, according to his pleasure.
                        
                        This being the practise of the pure Christian Church, defended by the learnedst Father, and worthyest Deuine that euer Christianity bred, by him grounded on the Scripture, and on the vnsearchable course of the diuine Prouidence, neuer censured nor condemned by any Father, we need not feare superstition in seeking some kind of fauours &amp; benefits by the peculiar intercession of certayne Saints, specially seing this was vsuall in the Church, confirmed by many miracles, recorded by most learned Saints that liued in the purest Christian ages.

                        Concerning oblations made vnto Saints. §. 7.
                        THE seauenth cause of dislike, is our offering oblations vnto Saints, which your Maiesty doth obiect peculiarly as done to the Blessed Virgin MARY.
                        I answere, if any Catholike should offer to the blessed mother of God by way of sacrifice any the least thing, he were seuerely to be rebuked, and better instructed. For sacrifice Nulli Martyrum sed ipsi Deo Martyrum, quamuis in memorias Martyrum cōstituimus altaria. Augustin. contra Faust. l. 20. c. 12. is a religious homage due to God only. In which respect the sacrifice of the holy Eucharist is neuer offered vnto any but vnto God, in memory and honour of Saints. Herein the Collyridians women-Priests did erre, who did sacrifice a wafer-cake vnto the blessed Virgin; which kind of worship vnder the tytle of Adoration Saint Epiphanius 
                           
                              Epiph. haeres. c. 9. reproues, allowing the Catholike worship, there tearming her honourable Virgin, not for humane or ciuill, but for diuine and supernaturall respects.
                        True it is, that in Catholike countreys people offer They are sayd offered vnto Saints, not because they are giuen vnto them immediatly in their owne persons, but because they are offered at their shrines &amp; Images, as ornaments or monuments. vnto Saints, Lights, Flowres, and chaynes, not as sacrifices but as ornaments to set forth their tombes and shrines, wherein they do not dissent from Antiquity, nor from Gods holy will, who hath cōfirmed such deuotions by miracle, as diuers Authors worthy of all credit relate,

particularly. S. Augustine by 
                              Caluin. instit. l. 5. c. 4.
                            Protestants allowed, as the most faythfull witnes of Antiquity

                           The Minister sayth that S. Augustine doth not affirme that flowers, and the like were offered vnto Saints. I Answere, if offering, signify Sacrificing, neither doth S. Augustine mention this as done in his age, nor do we practise it in ours. But if offering be taken (as we take it) for laying flowers and other such things on the Tombes of Martyrs to adorne and beautify their shrines, S. Augustin doth mention oblatiōs of flowers, &amp; suck like ornaments to haue beē made vnto the Tombes of Martyrs, &amp; this deuotion to haue bene confirmed by miracle, as is manifest.. A more wonderfull example in the same kind he relateth done vpon an old man of good note, who being sicke &amp; ready to dye, did yet very obstinatly refuse to belieue in Christ, and leaue his Idolatry, although he was very earnestly mooued thereunto by his children that were zealous Christians. His Sonne in law despayring to preuayle by persuasion, resolued to go and pray at the Tombe of Saint Stephen, and hauing performed his deuotions with burning affection, with many groanes and teares, being to depart, tooke with him some flowers that were on the shrine, and layd them secretly vnder his Father in Law his head the night as he went to sleepe. Behold the old man next morning awaking out of his sleep, cryeth out, desiring them to goe straight to call the Bishop to baptize him. He had his desire, he was baptized. Afterwards as long as he liued, he had this prayer in his mouth, Lord Iesu receaue my spirit, being altogeather ignorant that prayer was the prayer, &amp; last speach of Saint Stephen when he was stoned to death by the Iewes, which also were

the last wordes of this happy old man, for not long after pronouncing those wordes he gaue vp his soule. Other oblations also Catholikes vse to offer vnto Saints, not as sacrifices, but as memoryes &amp; monuments of benefits receaued, as pictures of Lymms by Saints prayers miraculously cured. That therin they doe not deflect from ancient Christian deuotion, and that the Christian Church in her best tymes vsed vniuersally to make such oblations, Theodoret 
                              Theodoret. de curandis Graecorum affect. l. 8. is a sufficient witnes, who writing agaynst the Gentills, alleadgeth as a manifest signe of Christs Godhead and Omnipotency, that Idols being excluded he brought in Martyrs to be honoured in their roome, not superstitiously as Gods, but religiously as diuine men, and Gods speciall friends. Christian people (sayth he) present themselues vnto Martyrs, not as vnto Gods, but as vnto the Martyrs of God, and diuine men, inuocating &amp; beseeching them to be intercessours for them vnto God. And those that piously, and with Fayth pray, obtayne what they desire, as testify the oblations which they (being therunto bound by their vowes) present in the Chappells of Saints, as tokens of health recouered. For some hang vp Images of eyes, others of eares, others of hands, some made of gold, some made of siluer 
                           The Minister also here denyeth that these ancient Christians did offer these oblations at the shrines of Martyrs in token of gratitude, for benefits receued. Wheras Theodoret saith expressely, that they were vowes which they had made, and were bound to pay vnto the Martyrs, that is, vnto their shrines, as monuments of their power in curing them.. Thus he, so generall and notorious, euen vnto Infidels, was this Christian deuition.
                     
                     
                        
                        The Roman Church set formes of Prayer, without cause misliked. §. 8.
                        
                        FINALLY Protestants dislike the circumstance of praying in a set forme vnto Saints, and that we appoint a particular office vnto the Blessed Virgin Mary, which cannot be proued to haue been vsed in the Primitiue Church The Minister pag. 353. brings prayers vsed in the Romane Missalls as though they were absurd, Call vpon the sweet name of Mary. Saints interceding we may deserue to be deliuered from all necessityes. The Saints merits interceding, Lord absolue vs from all sinnes. I Answere: all these speaches are the very words vsed by the full consent of ancient Fathers, as yow may find in the fifth Demonstration. Doth the Minister expect that for feare at his rayling we should leaue all antiquity? We must not do so, nor do we, nor may we feare the bitternes of mans tongue in so high degree..
                        I answere, that the Primer, or Office (so tearmed) of our Lady, is not an office properly and principally directed vnto her, but an Office contayning prayses of God, taken out of holy Scripture, wherein commemoration of her is made. So as I dare say that the prayers of that office of our Lady that are directed vnto her, make not the hundred part thereof. And seing it is most certayne that the Christian Church in her best times did frequently pray vnto Saints, what reason haue we to thinke that in her set forme of prayers, she did not vse to craue their intercession?
                        If it be lawfull, pious, and profitable when we pray vnto God, to pray also to Saints by their mediatiō offering our prayers to him, why should any mislike the doing of this in a set forme that is allowed by the Church? why should this displease, rather then an extemporall forme?
                        But further we cā proue that the Church in her best The Minister here questioneth our meaning by the word primitiue. I answere, that we hold, that true Christian Religion planted by the Apostles, was not a meere shaddow that vanished away in a trice, but that the beliefe and practise therof cōtinued in the world after their decease. This Religion in respect of being in the world was primitiue in the dayes of the Apostles, and of them that saw the Apostles and were conuerted by them. But in respect of free publike profession, the same was neuer Primitiue, till the fourth Age, that is, vnder Constantine. Now, the monuments of the first and second Age after the Apostles in regard of persecutiō are few, &amp; many Christian Historyes &amp; monuments, yea in a manner al, were made away by Dioclesian. So that the best way to know what Religiō was professed immediately vpō the death of the Apostles, is to examine what forme of Religiō in the dayes of Constantine came frō vnder groūd, &amp; secret meetings, into the free view of the world. For no doubt but that Religion was freely professed vnder Constantine, that was cruelly persecuted, and the monuments therof abolished by Dioclesiā Constantine his Predecessour, and the other Pagan Emperours before him. But the Christian profession of Constantines age is so cleerly Catholike, as our Ministers feare triall thereby, and would rather haue all reduced vnto those ages wherof the monuments are scarse, for therin they hope to find best patronage for their negatiue religion, and for their Inuisible Perpetuall, Namelesse Notorious Professours. times, did pray vnto Saints in set formes, as Catholikes now do, euen

with a forme of prayer, acknowledged &amp; cōfessed by the Magdeburgiās Cent. 4. c. 4. to haue byn in vse euē in the fourth age after Christ, in which the foure first generall Councels were held. But if they will perchance say that they do not so much dislike set formes vnto Saints, as some Phrases or speaches in our Prayer-bookes, that seeme to giue too much vnto Creatures, as our calling the Blessed Virgin Mother of Grace, Mother of mercy, saying to her, Lady protect vs from the Diuell, receaue vs in the houre of death, giue light to the blind, pardon to the guilty, remooue from vs all euill &amp;c. I answere, these speaches cannot iustly be disliked, because they are vnderstood in a pious sense knowne to Catholikes; a sense obuious &amp; playne according to the phrase of Scripture, and which the words may well beare euen according to the custome of speach. The nature of thinges being various, and the answerable conceipts of men copious, but words to expresse such conceyts scant and in great paucity, necessity doth inforce vs to vse words applyable to diuers senses. For example, one man may deliuer another from death, either by authority pardoning him as do Kings, or by Iustice defending him as do Aduocates, by force taking him out of his enemyes hands as do Souldiers, or paying his ransome to them that keep him captiue, as Almoners, finally by begging his life of them that haue power to

take it away, as intercessours. These be very different wayes of reliefe, yet haue we but one word to expresse them all, to wit, to saue a mans life, which therefore is to be vnderstood according to the subiect it is applyed. And if men want vnderstanding, or will not take our words according to the matter they are applyed vnto, there can neuer want Cauils, vnles we eyther speake not at all, or when we speake still vse long circumlocutions, which were ridiculous, &amp; in verse impossible, the metre not permitting it. And yet the aforesayd misliked phrases in the office of the Blessed Virgin are taken out of the Hymnes and Verses thereof. If they that by begging obtayne of the king the life of one condemned to death, may be, &amp; are commonly Our Aduersary in this place playeth the right Minister, according to the new order, &amp; very hansomely telleth a lye saying to the Iesuit; You labour to qualifye your blasphemous words by ā honorable expositiō, pretending you SAY one thinge, and MEANE another. What boldnes is this? doth not the Iesuit say, that they not only meane well, but also speake well, and according to the rigour of speach, the phrase of Scripture, &amp; holy Fathers? How then doth he pretend that we say one thing, and meane another? sayd to saue his life, though they saued him by intercession, not by their proper authority; why may not Saints be sayd to giue vs the things which by their prayers they obtayne for vs? Why may not the Church speake in Hymnes, &amp; in Verse, as the learnedst Fathers spake euen in Prose, neuer imagining that any would mistake their meaning? Saint Gregory Nazianzen, for his excellēt learning tearmed by the Grecians The Deuine, thus prayeth vnto Saint Cyprian. Looke downe on vs from heauen with a propitious eye, guide our works and wayes, feed this holy flocke, gouerne it with vs, dispose some of them, as farre as is possible, to a better state.

Cast out importune and troublesome wolues that cauill &amp; catch at sillables, vouchsafe vs the perfect and cleere splendour of the B. Trinity, with whome thou art already present 
                           The Minister heere sayth the Iesuit cānot proue that Gregory Naziā
                              zen did Inuocate S. Cyprian, but only made an Oratoriall Apostrophe vnto him: As Papists say in their hymne, al hayle o Crosse, &amp; yet they do not pray to the wodden Crosse. This is vanity. For, that S. Gregory Nazianzen did properly inuocate S. Cyprian. I proue by this demonstratiō. For one to call vpon some person for ayde, thinking him that he doth heare him, &amp; is able to helpe, is to Inuocate him. S. Gregory Nazianzē
                               did call vpon S. Cyprian for helpe, thinking he heard him, &amp; was able to helpe him; for he sayth 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              , I know well that Blessed Saints heare me, and are ready to reach out their hand to such as need their helpe. Ergo, he did properly Inuocate him, &amp; pray vnto him.. And not only Fathers but also Scriptures speake of Saints in the same sort, our Sauiour saying; Make to your selues friendes of the riches of Iniquity, that when you dye, they may receaue you into the eternall tabernacles. If then the Saints of God by the mouth of Verity it selfe be said to receaue their friends when they dye into the eternall Tabernacles, because God mooued by their prayers, admits them into the Blissefull vision of his essence; why may not the Church and her children craue the Blessed Virgins intercessions in these wordes: Mother of Mercy, receaue vs in the houre of death? And seing God in Scripture is tearmed Mercy, why should not she be stiled mother of mercy, that is vndoubtedly mother of God, especially seeing that in, and of her the Authour of mercy &amp; grace was conceaued and borne, and she filled with grace and charity aboue all other Creatures The seely Minister not knowing which way to turne himselfe to find some seeming ground of carping at the formes of the Catholicke Missals &amp; Roman Liturgy, he goeth catching at the phrases of priuate writers. To what purpose? If the Authours cannot iustifye their phrases &amp; Metaphores, let him dislike them in Gods name. What is this to the Catholike Church; Some writer did not apply his Metaphore fitly: Ergo, the Roman Church is Idolatrous??
                        That other phrase much disliked by your Maiesty, that God reseruing Iustice to himselfe, hath giuen away mercy to his mother, is not vsed by the Church in any of her prayers, nor allowed of by Catholike Deuines, nor will we iustify it, being an harsh and vnfitting Metaphore, though

thereby the Authours thereof expresse a truth, to wit, that the Blessed Virgin is exceeding gracious with her Sonne, and her intercession very potēt, alluding to a phrase of Scripture vsed Hester cap. 5.3.6. &amp; cap. 7.2. Marke 6.23. whereby such as are gracious with a prince are sayd that they may haue any thing, though halfe of his Kingdome: so, deuiding Gods Kingdome into Iustice and Mercy, to shew how gracious the Blessed Virgin is with her Sonne, they say, God hath giuen her one halfe of his Kingdome, to wit, his Mercy, which is a Metaphore far fetcht, not to be vsed, howsoeuer in charity it may be excused.
                     
                  
                  
                     THE FOVRTH POINT.
                     
                        The Liturgy, &amp; priuate prayers for the Ignorant, in an vnknovvne tongue.
                     
                     
                        THE custome of the Romane Church in this point is agreable to the custome of the Church in all Ages, and also of The Minister pag. 356. lin. 22. It is false according to the Tenet of Bellarmine himselfe, that all other Churches which differ from Protestāts haue their publike seruice in Hebrew, Greeke, or Latine. Answer. This is your fashion whē you haue not what to reply, you impose your sayings vpon your Aduersary, and then vrge they are false. The Answerer neuer said that al Churches which differ from Protestants, haue their seruice in Hebrew, Greeke or Latine, for this he knew to be false in the Maronits, Armenians, Aegyptians, Aethiopians, Russians: But he said, they all agree with the Roman, in that they haue their diuine seruice in a language not vulgar, nor commonly knowne of the people: this is true, for the fore-named Christians haue their Lyturgies in a speciall language which is not their vulgar. all Churches now in the world bearing the name of Christian, though opposite vnto the Romane (only those of the pretended Reformation excepted) which constant

concurrence is a great signe that the same is very conforme vnto reason, and not any where forbidden in Gods word, which wil easily appeare if we looke particulerly into the same.
                     For we may imagine a triple state of Liturgy in an vnkowne tongue. The first, in a language altogeather The Minister pag. 369. saith: This is a Chimera, &amp; Non Ens, because there was neuer such a Liturgy in the Church. Answere. In the beginning of the Church there was not any set Forme of publike prayer, but the sacred Minister did extemporally make prayers at meetings. And that some then did vse to make extemporall prayers in languages altogether vnknowne, euen to themselues, appeares by the Apostle 1. Cor. 14. Nor is it inough for a Minister to say, that this is a Non Ens, and a Chimera, because it neuer was. For first, though it neuer were, yet it might haue been; and things that be possible, and might haue been be not Chimera's. Secondly, that in meetings some did vse a language altogether vnknowne at prayer, S. Paul doth witnes, who (I trow) is to be belieued before a Minister. He forbids the speaking in the Church with an vnknowne tongue, when there is none present that can vnderstand and interprete, 1. Cor. 14.27.28. which he would not haue done, had it not bene vsed. Therfore some did vse prayers in publike Church-meetings in a language so vnknowne, as no man present could vnderstand and interprete the same, no not themselues, &amp; so the Fathers interprete S. Paul. S. Augustine de Genes. ad liter. lib. 12. c. 8. &amp; 9. S. Ambrose, Theophilact, specially S. Chrysostome. Erant, sayth he, multi qui precabantur &amp; lingua sonabant, mente verò quid dixissent non intelligebant: There were many that soūded prayers in an vnknowne tounge which euē themselues did not vnderstand. vnknowne, in the which no man in the Church speakes, no man vnderstands besides the Celebrant himself, nor he neither, but by Enthusiasme or inspiration of the holy Ghost: Without question it is inconuenient that publike prayer should be sayd in a language in this sort vnknowne, and this is proued by the reasons the Apostle brings 1. Cor. 14. against an vnknown tongue in the Church. Secondly, in a language vnknowne to most, euē of the better sort of the Church, yet some know it, and others with facility may learne it. To vse a language in the Church for publike prayer in this sort vnknowne

cannot be proued vnlawfull, nor forbidden by the Apostle, seing the reasons brought by him agaynst a language vnknowne make not agaynst this. For Saint Paul reprehends in the publike Liturgy a language so vnknown, as the Minister or the Church that supplyes the place of the Idiot &amp; Ignorant, cannot vpon his knowledge of the goodnes of the prayer say therunto Amen, in the name of them all. But when the language is knowne by some of the Church &amp; may with facility be learned by others, there is, or may easily be found one able to supply the place of the Idiote and ignorant, and answere in their person Amen, out of his intelligence of the prayer in that vnknowne tongue.
                     Notwithstanding the Roman Church doth not approue the vse of a language in this sort vnknowne, as appears by the late dispensation of Paulus the fift, vnto Iesuits to turne the Liturgy of the Masse, into the vulgar language of China, and to vse the same till the Latine language grow more knowne and familiar in that countrey. For though publike prayers in a language thus vnknowne cannot be proued vnlawfull, yet it is vndecent to vse a language which to the whole multitude of hearers, may seeme barbarous and vncouth. Thirdly, a language may be tearmed vnknowne, because it is not the vulgar The Minister pag. 370. argueth in this sort. The old rule was, Barbarus hic ego sum qui non intelligor vlli; &amp; accordingly your Massepreists are meere barbariās to the ordinary sort of people. Answer. If he be a Barbarian that is not vnderstood, the Minister should be a Barbarian to himselfe, who vnderstands not himselfe. Did he vnderstād what he saith, he wold vnderstand that this argumēt proueth the cō
                           trary to what he intendeth. For his old rule, Barbarus hîc ego sum, quia non intelligor vlli, in English soundeth thus, I am a Barbarian, where I am vnderstood of no man, non intelligor vlli. But the Catholike Priest saying the Latin masse in the Latin Church is vnderstood of many. How then can he be a Barbarian by this old rule? The latin tongue is knowne of the best, most ciuill, and most principall persons in the Westerne parts of the world. Wherfore he that speakes it is not Barbarous, but accounted rather learned to him that vnderstands not Latin: for the cause why the Latin in these parts is not vnderstood is not the strangenes of the language, but the rudenes of the hearer, and want of the best education. But in a country where the best, ciuillest, and most learned know not Latin, the Latin is Barbarous., though most men of better sort vnderstand it. Such was

anciently the latin language in the whole Roman Empire, and now is in the Latine Church. For not only Priests vnderstand the same (or if some few do not, it is the fault of Bishops that ordayne them) but also an innumerable company of Laymen, not only addicted to learning, but also other gentlemen, yea many of the vulgar, partly by reason of the affinity their mother tongue hath with the Latin, partly out of education, which commōly when they are children they haue What the Minister here bringeth out of Suarez that it is not necessary the Minister or Preist vnderstand the language, in which masse is said, is mis-vnderstood by him. For Suarez doth not meane that the Preist may lawfully be ignorant of the language of the masse, or that he doth not sinne in saying masse without knowledge of the tongue; but onely, that such prayers are notwithstandinge auaileable vnto others that pray with the Minister, and offer them vnto God in the faith of the Church. For if the vnderstanding of the Minister were necessary to make the publike prayers pleasing to God, and auaileable, thē if the Minister chance to be distracted, &amp; haue his mind on other matters the people should leese the fruite of publike Seruice.: How then can the seruice, or the Liturgy in Latin be said absolutely to be in an vnknowne tongue which the most part (besides women) in some sort vnderstand? Moreouer the prayers which S. Paul speaketh of were extemporall, made in publike meetings, according to the deuotion of the speaker. Therfore it was necessary that he should pray in a knowne language, that those who heard him might know when to say Amen, and whether the prayer for matter was such as they might lawfully say Amen therunto. But now the seruice and Liturgy of the Church hath set offices for euery festiuall day approoued by the Church, which by continuall vse are made so knowne, &amp;

so vulgar vnto common people, as no man is so ignorant that vsing diligence or attention may not in short time come to vnderstand them. And hereunto serue Exhortations, Sermons, Catechismes, priuate Instructions, Manualls &amp; Primers in vulgar Languages, where the prayers vsed for the Church are found, which shew that the Latine seruice cannot be vnknowne to any that will vse diligence to vnderstand it; neyther can any doubt, but that he may lawfully say Amen vnto it The Minister pag. 369. &amp; 377. argueth in this manner: That is forbidden by the Apostle to be vsed in prayer wherby al sorts of people being of ripe yeares may not be edified in their vnderstanding, &amp; to which they are not able to say Amen hauing some distinct vnderstā
                           ding of the things spoken. Answer. First not onely the learned, but also the vnlearned haue or may haue some distinct knowlege of the set Offices of the Church, of the prayers, Gospells, and Epistles read, and other deuotions said in secret, they being so often and yeerely repeated, yea some for the most part daily. Secondly, it is false, that the Apostle doth prohibite all prayer that doth not edify the vnderstanding. For though the Apostle prefer prayer that doth edify the vnderstanding, yet doth he not prohibite prayer of meere affection without new instruction of the vnderstanding, but saith that in such prayers men pray with their spirit and affection, though not with their vnderstanding.
                        .
                     Now that S. Paul did cōmād that seruice should be in such a language as euery womā in the Church might be able to vnderstād it word by word The Minister sayth pag. 374. that Ignorance of the distinct notion of euery word, hindreth not sufficient edification, when the ordinary necessary, and common passages of the publicke seruice are intelligible. Thus he. Now I subsume. But people who vnderstand not latin distinctly may by instruction through bookes, Sermons, and Cathechismes vnderstand the ordinary, necessary, and common passages of the publicke seruice, specially by the helpe of vse and custome, as experience sheweth. Ergo, publicke prayers in latin may yield sufficient edification, and so are lawfull. is incredible, nor are our Aduersaryes able to proue it; neyther

can they shew by any Records of antiquity that such a custome was in the Primitiue Church: yea the cōtrary may more then probably be shewed, because the drift of the Church in appointing Lyturgies, or set formes of publike Prayer at the oblation of the Eucharisticall sacrifice, was not for the The Minister sayth that indeed the end of publicke seruice is not to instruct People, yet the prayers must be said in a language vnderstood of all, because they which come to God with sound of wordes, without vnderstanding, offer the sacrifice of fooles. Answere. He that offereth vnto God vocall prayers full of deuout &amp; pious affection, knowing only in generall that they be pious deuout &amp; expressing such affections, offers a gratefull sacrifice vnto God, though he doe not distinctly vnderstand the words and parts of the Prayer. For exāple, if one that vnderstands not Latin belieue the Psalme Miserere to be full of penitent affections, and say the same with many teares of inward sorow &amp; contritiō for his sinnes, whosoeuer will say that this man offers vnto God the sacrifice of fooles, is himselfe an Infidell, or Foole. For what greater folly then to think that prayers of pious affection please not God, except the affection correspond mathematically to the words? peoples instruction, but for other reasons. First, that by this publike Seruice a continuall dayly tribute or homage of prayer &amp; thankesgiuing might be publikely offered and payed vnto God. Secondly, that christians by their personall assistāce at this publike seruice might protest, &amp; exercise exteriourly acts of Religion common with the whole Church, represented by the Synaxis, or Ecclesiasticall meeting of euery Christian parish. Finally, to the end that euery Christian by his presence, yielding consent vnto the publike prayers, prayses and thankesgiuings of the Church, and as it were subscribing &amp; setting his seale vnto them by this assisting at them, might ordinarily participate of the graces, benefits &amp; fruits which the Church doth obtaine by her Liturgyes and publike

oblations. Now, for this end there is no need, that euery one shold vnderstād word by word the prayers that are sayd in the publike Liturgy, but it sufficeth that the Church in generall, and in particular Pastours and Ecclesiasticall persons dedicated vnto the Ministeryes of the Church, and who watch, being bound to giue an account of soules committed to their charge, haue particular notice of all the prayers that are sayd, and that all who will may be taught &amp; instructed in particular, if they will vse diligence &amp; desire it.
                     Moreouer the Churches anciently euen in the purest tymes of Christianity, had Chancels vnto which Laymen might not enter, &amp; so could not particularly and distinctly vnderstand It had bene folly for the Church, intending her Liturgy for the instruction of laymen, to haue excluded them out of the Chancells: and though our Aduersary say, that the Preist read seruice in so audible a voice, as he might be heard from the highest of the Chā
                           cell where the Aultar was placed, vnto the body of Church; yet this he might better haue spokē vnto fooles, then vnto men of vnderstāding, that know how great the Chancells of many Churches are, and how farre distinctly audible a mans voice ordinarily is. the prayers said by the publike Minister of the Church. Within the sayd Chancells they did also vse to say a good part of the Liturgy 
                           Vide Liturgias impressas anno Domini 1568. Basil. in Liturg. fol. 34. secretly, so that their voyce was not audible vnto any. Yea the Greeke Church did anciently vse a Veyle 
                           Basil. ibidem fol. 34.38.41.43.46. &amp; Chrysostom. Liturg. fol. 55. &amp; hom. 61. ad Pop.
                         wherewith the Priest was for the tymes of the sacred Oblation compassed, which are manifest signes, that the Church did neuer thinke it necessary that all the publike Liturgy should be heard, much lesse word by word vnderstood by the whole vulgar multitude present therat.
                     
                        Besides, it is certayne that the Scripture was not read in any language but Greeke ouer al the Churches of the East, as S. Hierome 
                           Hieron. praefat. in Paralip.
                         witnesseth. Also the Greeke Liturgy of Saint Basill was vsed in all the Church of the East, and the Grecian was not the vulgar language of all the Countreyes of the East, as is apparent by manifest testimonyes, particularly of the 
                           Basil. de Spiritu sancto c. 19. Cappadocians, 
                           Hieron. in Prooem. 2. lib. com. ad Galat. &amp; Act. Apost. c. 1. v. 10. &amp; 11. Mesopotamians, 
                           Hieron. in Prooem. 2. lib. com. ad Galat. &amp; Act. Apost. c. 1. v. 10. &amp; 11. Galathians, 
                           Theodoret. in histor. SS. Patrum hist. 13. Lycaonians,

                         Aegyptians, Syrians; yea that all these Countreys and most of the Orient had their proper language distinct from the Greeke is manifest out of the Acts of the Apostles. No lesse manifest is it that the Latin Liturgy was cōmon anciently for all the Churches of the Westerne parts, euen in Africke, as appeareth by testimonyes of S. 
                           August. Epist. 57. de doctrin. Christian. l. 2. c. 13. August. in Psalm. 123. &amp; in exposit. Ep. ad Rom. &amp; epist. 173. Augustine. But it is manifest that the Latin was not the vulgar language for all nations of the West; and though the better sort vnderstood it, yet some of the Although the Fathers say that the Greek Liturgy &amp; translation did serue all Asia, and the East: Although likewise they affirme the same of the Latin for all Africa and the Occident, yet our Minister saith to the contrary pa. 379. and 380. that all people had their Liturgyes in their natiue tōgue, which he proueth, because the people did then praise God in all languages, and did pray, according to S. Iustine and Tertulliā, togither with the Preist. Ergo, the publike Liturgy was read in the Church in all vulgar tongues. As his denying what so many Fathers affirme is impudent, so his arguing is friuolous, as euery man may see. For Catholicks praise God in all languages, and meet to pray with Preists as much as Protestants, &amp; yet our publike seruice is not said in all vulgar tongues. More impertinent are his allegatiōs of Fathers, speaking against distraction of mind, &amp; mēs not hearing thēselues in prayer. As though men could not be recollected in prayer by attentiō vnto God, vnto their owne needes, and the substance of their prayers, though they do not vnderstād thē distinctly word by word. vulgar multitude only knew their owne mother tongue, as may be cleerly gathered out of the same Saint Augustin, who writes that he pleading in Latine agaynst Crispinus a Bishop of the Donatists for possession of a village in Africa, wherunto the consent of the Villagers was required, they did not vnderstand his speach till the same was interpreted vnto them in their vulgar African lāguage. So that the Christian Church

did neuer iudge it requisite, that the publike Liturgy should be commonly turned into the mother language of euery nation, nor necessary that the same should presently be vnderstood word by word by euery one of the vulgar assistants, neyther doth the end of the publike Seruice require it.
                     As for the cōfort that some few want, in that they do not so perfectly vnderstād the particulars of diuine Seruice, it may by other means aboūdātly be supplied without turning the publik Liturgyes into innumerable vulgar lāguages, which would bring a great cōfusion into the Christiā Church. First, The Church should not be able to iudge of the Liturgy of euery country whē differences arise about the Trāslation therof. So diuers errors &amp; heresies might creep into particular countreyes, and the whole Church neuer able to take notice of them. Secondly, particular countreyes could not be certayne, that they haue the Scripture truly translated, for therof they can haue no other assured proofe, but only the Churches approbation, nor can she approoue what she doth not vnderstand. Thirdly, were vulgar Translations so many as there be lāguages in the world, it could not be otherwayes, but some would be in many places ridiculous, incōgruous, &amp; full of mistaking, to the great preiudice of soules, specially in languages that haue no great extents, nor many learned men

that naturally speake them. Fourthly the liturgy would be often changed, togeather with the language, which doth much alter in euery age. Fiftly, in the same Countrey by reason of different dialects, some Prouinces vnderstand not one another. And in the Island of Iaponia, (as some write) there is one language for Noble men, another for Rustikes, another for men, another for women; Into what language shold then the Iaponian Liturgy be turned? Finally, by this vulgar vse of the Liturgy the study of the learned languages, would be giuen ouer, &amp; in short tyme come to be extinct, as we see that no ancient language now remaynes in humane knowledge, but such as haue been (as it were) incorporated in the Liturgyes of the Church; &amp; the common vse of learned tongues being extinct, there would follow want of meanes for Christians to meete in Generall Councells to communicate one with another in matters of fayth. In a word extreme Barbarisme would be brought vpō the world.
                     Priuate prayers The Minister hauing nothing to say, rayleth &amp; boasteth that the opposition of Protestants, forsooth, hath brought vs to allow priuate vulgar prayers by force, as we translate Scripture; &amp; that were our kingdome as absolute as euer, we would returne to our Center. Thus he Prophesieth, but so, as he may easily be proued a false Prophet. For (to omit that diuers Councels many ages before Luther was borne, command the knowing of the Pater, Aue, and Creed in the vulgar tongue) where is the Popes kingdome more absolute, or Protestācy lesse knowne then in Italy and in Spaine? And yet no where are prayers in the vulgar tongue more vsed then in Italy and Spaine. You shall hardly there find one woman, one Layman which sayeth not their priuate deuotiōs in the vulgar. Wheras thousands in Germany, Low countryes, Polony, England both men and womē, loue to say their prayers rather in Latine, to shew their oppositiō against Protestants that fondly cō
                           demne such prayers, &amp; be so void of iudgemēt as to thinke that pious thoughts and affections vpon the Pater noster please not God, except we vnderstād the wordes, and measure our pious thoughs and affections Geometrically vnto the same: so that a woman saying with much deuotion Pater noster, if perchā
                           ce she thinke that Pater signifyes our, and Noster Father, her prayer is marred. Wherfore your Protestant imprudent opposition is the cause that many pray in Latin, which otherwise perchance would not. for ignorant people in their vulgar languages we practise, we allow; yea the Pater Noster, and the Creed, are to be knowne of all in their Mother tongues, which two formes contayne the whole substance of prayer. For the end of Prayer being threefold, To prayse God for his infinite perfectiōs, To giue him thanks for his benefits bestowed vpon vs, To demand

of him such necessaryes as we want, aswell for the maintayning of this present, as for the attayning vnto eternall life; the Creed being a Summe of the perfections of God, &amp; his benefits towardes man, affoards sufficient knowledge to comply with the two former ends of prayer. The Pater Noster, being an abridgemēt of al those things which we need, cōteines a full instruction for the third. Other prayers doe but more plainly expresse thinges contayned in the Pater Noster, &amp; the Creed, and our many bookes do shew, that these kind of prayers in vulgar languages are by vs writtē, esteemed, practised. We add that ordinarily speaking, common people doe more profit by saying prayers in their mother tongue then in the Latine, because not only their affections are mooued to piety, but also their vnderstanding edifyed with knowledge. Notwithstanding some prayers though translated into English be so difficill to be vnderstood as they will rather distract ignorant, especially curious people, then instruct them, of which kind are many Psalmes of Dauid, &amp; these prayers (as we thinke) may more profitably be sayd in Latine. So that I see no great difference eyther in practise or in doctrine betweene Protestants &amp; the Roman Church, concering priuate Prayers in a language vnknowne.
                  
                  
                     
                     THE FIFTH POINT
                     
                        Repetitions of Pater Nosters, Aues, and Creeds, especially affixing a kind of merit to the number of them.
                     
                     
                        I AM perswaded that your Maiesty doth not intend to dislike Repetition of Prayers, so the same be done with reuerent Deuotion and Affection. For this repetition is iustifyed, not only by the example of the blind man, who still cryed vpon our Sauiour, with repetition of the same prayer, 
                           Math. 20. Marc. 10. Luc. 18. 
                        Iesu Fili Dauid miserere mei, by which repetition he obtayned his sight; nor only of the princely Prophet, who in his 135. Psalme repeates 27. tymes, Quoniam in aeternum misericordia eius; nor only of the 
                           Isa. 6.6. Seraphims, who in praysing their Creator repeate three times ouer the same word, holy, holy, holy: but also by the example of our Blessed Sauiour himselfe, who thrice (at least) in the garden repeated the same prayer, 
                           Matth. 26. v. 4. Marc. 14. v. 39. Eumdem sermonem dicens. Luc. 22. v. 42. 
                        Pater, si fieri potest, trāseat à me Calix, verumtamen non mea voluntas, sed tua fiat.
                     
                     
                        Wherfore to repeate the same prayers is very good and pious, so the same be done with new deuotion; which new deuotion that it may not be wanting in our Repetitions, there is appointed for euery Pater, Aue, &amp; Creed, a speciall meditation, that may stirre vp deuotion at euery repeated prayer. And seing we cannot pray long but we must needes repeate ouer the Pater noster in sense, (for what can we demand of God that is not there contayned?) why may we not also repeate the same in words? If any thinke to merit by reason of the number of his prayers, he is ignorāt of the doctrine of the Catholike Church, which attributes The Minister pag. 385. writeth in this sort: I grant repetitions in prayer, and thankesgiuings which agree with the examples of Scripture to be pious and lawfull; but the illation from these to the Roman Battalogy is inconsequent. First, their prayers are in part directed to Creatures. Secōdly, they are multiplyed to an excessiue and portentuous number. Thirdly, the Creed is no prayer or thāksgiuing formally or virtually. Fourthly, they thinke praying without vnderstanding the words, without present actuall attention, to be pious and effectuall. Answer. To auoyd the shame of not being able to reply something, at least in shew, you runne directly vpō his Maiesty &amp; disgrace his questiōs. His Maiesty proceding most iudiciously, knowing the Pater noster to be pious deuotion; first questioned the Aue Maria, or praying vnto Saints, &amp; also praying in an vnknowne tongue, &amp; then supposing by way of argument, that the saying of Paters Aues &amp; Creeds is pious, he doubts about repetition of them in certaine nūbers, as iudging repetitiō euen of pious and Godly prayers, in a fixed number, to be questionable, specially affixing merit vnto the number. You conuinced by the Iesuit, grant repetitiō of pious prayers in certaine numbers to be pious, and so haue granted what his Maiesty questioned; &amp; yet not to seeme to grant it, you make his Maiestyes question to be, whether repetition of vnlawful prayers in an excessiue number, without attention, be lawfull? Which question is vnworthy of his Maiestyes Iudgement; yea his Maiesty seing the impertinency of this question did first mooue doubt about the lawfulnes of Inuocation of Saints, that the lawfulnes therof might be supposed in this questiō, knowing the question without this supposition to be senselesse &amp; foolish. Secondly, according to your reply, his Maiesty doth not dislike our saying 33. Pater nosters, in memory of 33. yeares our Sauiour liued vpō earth, affixing merit vnto that number. For neither is the number excessiue, nor the prayer vnlawfull, nor is there any amongst vs that doth not vnderstand the sense therof. And yet I thinke his Maiesty was not of this mind, which sheweth that he questioned repetition of pious prayers in a fixed number, and so your Reply grants what he questioned. Thirdly, the Aue Maria is not a prayer directed vnto any Creature, as prayer signifyes petition of grace and fauour, because in the Aue Maria we aske not grace, nor any gift of the B. Virgin, but only that she will pray for vs, Holy mary pray for vs, now and in the hower of death. If petition made vnto Creatures that they will be comprecants with vs, be prayer directed vnto Creatures; then is crauing the comprecation of liuing Saints, prayer finally directed vnto a Creature. Fourthly, your saying that the Creed is no prayer neither formally nor virtually, is the bare word of a Minister against the perpetuall practise of the Christian Church, which vsed the Creed as a prayer a thousand yeares agoe, defining it in Concil. Quinosexto Can. 7. Let euery Christian pray, at the least twice a day, saying the CREED, or the Lords Prayer, or, Qui plasmasti me miserere mei, or, Deus propitius esto mihi peccatori. Thus the Councell. And who doth not see the Creed, said vnto God with inward deuotion of faith, about his diuine perfections, and mercyes toward mankind there declared, to be a prayer either of praise, or thankesgiuing, or obsecration, according to the affection of him that prayeth. Finally, your Cauill that our prayers are said in a tongue vnknowne, and so without present attention, is in your supposition often false (seing they that pray in these numbers most commonly either vnderstand Latin, or else pray in the vulgar tongue) &amp; in the illation ridiculous: For they that vnderstand not the Pater, Aue, and Creed in Latin, may by memory know the substance thereof, and so be actually attent. no merit to prayers in regard of their number, further then the number awakes in vs deuout thoughts, which is the only thing that by the number we ayme at. We say Paters, Aues, Creeds, to the number of three in memory of the Blessed Trinity, seeking Gods fauour and grace by glorifying that incomprehensible mystery. To the number of fiue, in memory of the fiue speciall wounds our Sauiour receaued, that pierced into, &amp; throgh his sacred body. To the number of 33. in remembrance of 33. yeares our Sauiour wrought our Saluation vpon earth, giuing him thankes for all his labours, desiring the application of his merits, stirring vp our selues to the imitation of his vertues. The like reason moueth vs to pray in the number

of 63. Angelicall salutations, to call to mind the yeares the Mother of God liued, according to one probable opinion. And because the opiniō that she liued 72. yeares now begins to be much followed, many Catholikes, particularly in Spayne, haue thereupon increased the crowne of our B. Lady to 72. Aue Maria's: A manifest signe that they neuer attributed merit vnto the number of 63. but only to the deuout memory of the B. Virgins vertues exercised in the yeares she conuersed in this world, giuing God thankes for his graces bestowed vpon her. The Psalter of our Lady, &amp; the Iesus Psalter contayne one hundred &amp; fifty repetitions of prayers, the one of Aue Maria's, the other Iesu, Iesu, Iesu, in imitation of the deuout Royal Prophet, whose Psalter contaynes Psalmes in Gods prayse, to the same number.
                     
                        Neyther are we in this point of repeating prayers vpon Beades, or little stones in a The Minister sayth, that his Maiesty in his dislike of our affixing merit to the Repetition of prayers in a certaine number, meant to deny the merit of condignity, not the merit of congruity or Impetration. I Answere. If you had studied of purpose to make his Maiesty ridiculous in his proposition of questions, you could not haue more fondly sensed them. For his Maiesty speaking of prayers, and denying merit vnto the repeating of prayers, what (according to sense) could he meane, but the merit proper of prayers, which is to impetrate or obtayne? And so the Iesuit prouing the speciall merit of Impetration, hath proued what his Maiesty questioned. As for your selfe, seeing you deny not that vnto repetition of prayers speciall merit of Impetration is affixed, I do not doubt but you yield the very Doctrine his Maiesty disliked, to wit, that repetition of prayers in a fixed number, hath speciall force and efficacy to impetrate. certayne number (for the causes before mētioned) destitute of the example of Saints, that liued in the best ages of the

Church. Palladius in his history cap. 14. &amp; 25. setteth downe some examples of Saints praying in this kind. Yea the Century-writers Cent. 4. col. 1329. and Osiander, acknowledge the example of Saint Paul, a most holy Monke, liuing in the fourth age after Christ, that, In dies singulos trecentas orationes Deo velut tributum reddidit; ac ne per imprudentiam in numero erraret, trecentis lapillis in sinum coniectis, ad singulas preces singulos eiecit lapillos: consumptis igitur lapillis, constabat sibi orationes lapillis numero pares abs se expletas esse. Which example of so great a Saint, so knowne and notorious The Minister answereth, that singular exā
                              ples are no rule, for Ammonius being sollicited to be a Bishop, cut of his owne eare, &amp; yet he is not imitable herein: so neyther is S. Paules exā
                           ple, in saying prayers vpon Beades to be followed. I Answere. Some thinges are such of their owne nature as they cannot be done lawfully and with out sinne, but by special reuelation, as the killing &amp; mayming himselfe, in which kind examples in Scripture, or else where related, are admirable, not imitable. But when the thinge vsed by some singular Saint, is not agaynst any law of God or man, but a thinge that may be done without speciall reuelation, the same is imitable by all others in due circumstances. Now, what law diuine or human, forbids a man to say three hundred prayers a day, one hundred to ech of the three Diuine Persons? Or what law doth prohibit him to vse 300. little stones or beades, in numbring them, for help of Memory? Or why may we not help our memory in numbring our deuotions, by calculation of Beades, if S. Paules example be pious and laudable? If to say Prayers in a certayne number vpon beades be intrinsecally euill, it cannot be done piously by the singular instinct of Gods Spirit, seing God can neuer inspire men to doe any thinge that is essentially euill. If it be not of it selfe essentially euill, why should Protestants forbid men to vse such helpes of our deuotion? except they can shew, an expresse positiue Diuine law in Scripture, agaynst it., and neuer censured by any Father, may more then abundantly suffice for satisfaction in a matter of no more moment then this. For we are not curious in this Point, nor doe require of any man, that he say his prayers in a certaine number, so that he may not say more or lesse, as his deuotion serues him.
                  
                  
                     
                     THE SIXTH POINT.
                     
                        The doctrine of Transubstantiation.
                     
                     
                        YOVR Excellent Maiesty, submitting your Iudgement to Gods expresse word doth firmely belieue the body of Christ to be truly present in the most venerable Sacrament of the Altar; which doctrine doth naturally and necessarily inferre whatsoeuer the Church of Rome holds as matter of Fayth, concerning the manner of this Presence.
                     To declare this, and togeather answere an Obiection much vrged by some Protestants, that they belieue the body of Christ to be in the Sacrament, but are not boūd by this, to belieue the Manner, that not being expressed in Scripture: We must note, that men are bound firmely to belieue the manner of a mystery reuealed, when the same belongs to the substance therof, so that reiecting the manner, we reiect the beliefe of the substance of the mystery. This is euident, and may be declared by the example of the mystery of the Incarnation, the substance wherof is, that in Christ Iesus the nature of God, and the nature of man are so vnited, that God is truly Man, &amp; man verily God. The manner of this mystery is ineffable and incomprehensible, yet we are bound to belieue three thinges concerning it; which if we deny, we deny the mystery in substāce, howsoeuer we may retayne

the same in words. First, that this vnion is not only Metaphoricall Non affectualis vnitas, sed secundū subsistentiam. Synodus 5. Generalis quae est Constantinop. 2. Can. 4.
                         by Affection, as two persons that are great friends may truly be sayd to be all one; but also true, and Reall. Secondly, reall Vnion of natures, is Qui nō confitetur Dei verbū substantialiter VNIRI carni, Anathema sit. Synod. Chal. act. 5. Synod. quinta General. can. 5.
                         
                        substantiall, and not accidentall, so that therby the nature is not only accidentally perfected by receauing excellent participations of the diuine nature, power, wisdome, and Maiesty, but also substantially, the very fulnes of the God-head, dwelling corporally and substantially in him. Thirdly, that this substantiall Vnion, is not according to the Natures, so, that the nature of God, &amp; the nature of man became one and the same nature, as Eutiches taught, but Ex duabus naturis secundū substātiā vnitis, vnum &amp; eumdem Christū qui non confitetur, condēnatus est. Concil. Lateran. sub Martin. 1. Can. 6. 
                        Hypostaticall, whereby God and Man became one and the same person. These particulars about the manner of the Incarnation, though high, subtill, and incomprehensible to reason, Christians may, and must belieue, because they belong to the substāce of the Mystery, and are declared by the Church in generall Councels, though the vulgar be not bound explicitely to know them.
                     In this sort we say, that the manner how our Sauiours Body is in the Sacrament of his last Supper, must be belieued, &amp; may not be denyed as farre as it concernes the very life, being, and substance of the Mystery reuealed. Which mystery in substance is, that the Body of Christ is present in the Sacrament in such sort, that the Priest minister therof, demonstrating what seemeth bread, may truly say thereof in the person of Christ, This is my body. This supposed, as the substāce of the mystery, I inferre that two Catholike doctrines concerning the manner of this mystery, belong to the substance of this mystery, &amp;

cannot be called in question without danger of misbeliefe. First, the Real Presence of the whole body of Christ, vnder the formes of bread. Secondly, that this is done by Transubstantiation.
                     
                        An Addition prouing the Catholicke Reall Presence, according to the litterall Truth of Gods Word; agaynst Ministeriall Metaphores, Figures, and Shifts.
                        HIS Maiesty in questioning onely Transubstantiation, seemeth to suppose the Reall Presence of the Body and Blood of our Sauiour, vnder the Sacramentall signes, and that the words of our Sauiour, This is my body, be true in their proper and litteral sense. This was the reason that the Answerer omitted to proue largely this Catholicke Doctrine. Now the Minister finding himselfe vnable vpon this supposition of his Maiesty to answere the Iesuits argumēts for Transubstantiation, yea Pag. 397. affirmeth, that vnlesse Transubstantiation be granted, the wordes of our Sauiour cannot be true in their proper and litterall sense. Hence he denyes the presence of the body of Christ Substantially within the sacred signe, &amp; laboureth to proue, that the words of the Supper are figuratiuely, and not properly to be vnderstood. He grants a Reall, and True Presence of Christs body in words, but so obscurely, as no man is able to vnderstand his meaning.
                        Wherfore to cleere this matter, wherein Ministers desire to be darke, that men may not see the grosse infidelity of their hart agaynst Gods expresse word, I shall shew 3. things. First, what Zuinglians and Caluinists hold in this point. Secondly, how the Doctrine both of Zuinglius &amp; Caluin is against Gods word. Thirdly, that their reasons not to admit of the literall truth of Christs word, be vaine and idle.
                     
                     
                        The Zuinglian and Caluinian Religion about the Sacrament. §. 1.
                        
                        A Three-fold presence of Christs Body in the Sacrament, is confessed on all sides. The first, Figuratiue, or in a Sacramentall signe, bread signifying his body, and wine his bloud. The second, Imaginatiue, or by the pious apprehension of the faithfull receauer, who for more deuotions sake doth, or may imagine as if he saw the body of our Lord in the Eucharist truly, really, and bleedingly present, vnder the signes of bread and wine.

The third, Effectuall, or according to the Spirituall effects of grace purchased by the Body and Bloud of our Sauiour, and giuen by vertue of this Sacrament vnto the soule, to nourish the ghostly life therof.
                        As all proceed thus farre, so Zuinglians will proceed no further. They grant the body and bloud of Christ to be present in the Sacrament figuratiuely in a signe, imaginatiuely by fayth, effectually by grace; but deny them to be present according to their corporall substance, or further then in the outward signe to the mouth, and in the inward effect to the soule. So that they grant the Sacramentall signe to be bare and empty in respect of contayning the body of Christ, though full and effectuall in respect of affoarding soule-nourishing grace.
                        Caluinists seeme in their words to maintaine a more reall presence. For though they maintayne the substance of the body of Christ in respect of place, to be in heauen only and not in the Sacrament, yet they teach that the same body without being present vpon earth is giuen vs on earth, not only by the apprehension of fayth; Non solùm dum fide amplectimur Iesum Christum pro nobis crucifixum, &amp; à mortuis excitatum; Not only in the inward spirituall effects of soule-nourishing grace, purchased by the death of his body; Non solùm dum bonis eius omnibus quae nobis acquisiuit corpore suo efficaciter communicamus, but realiter, really, &amp; truly; Dum habitat in nobis, dum vnum fit nobiscum, dum eius membra sumus de carne eius, dum in vnam, vt ita loquar, cum ipso substantiam coalescimus. Caluin. in cap. 11.1. ad Cor.
                        
                        Hence we may discouer the Caluinian iugling, and playing fast &amp; loose about this Mystery, when they so often say that the body of Christ is really present, but Spiritually: for the word Spirituall may be vsed in this Mystery for two ends. First, to expresse the substance of the thing present, &amp; to signify the reall Presence, not of the corporall substance of our Lords body, but only of the spiritual effect therof, to wit, of soule-feeding grace. This sense is false, as shall be proued, and the very same which Caluin doth condemne in the Zwinglians, as execrable blasphemy, opusculo de Coena Domini. Secondly, to expresse the manner of the Presence, and to signify that the corporall substance of our Lord is present truly, yet in a spirituall, that is, secret, inuisible, &amp; indiuisible manner; this doctrine is true, and herein not differing from the Catholike. In like manner their Phrase of Presence by Fayth is equiuocall, and may haue a threefold sense. First, Presence by Fayth, may signify Presence by pious imagination of Fayth, the Receauer conceauing the body of our Lord, as if he saw the same corporally and bleedingly present. If by Presence by fayth, Caluinists meane no more

then this, then they doe not differ from the Zwinglians, nor do they put any more reall presence then imaginatiue, that is, presence of things according to pious representation and apprehension, though not really &amp; in truth. Secondly, Presence by Fayth may signify, that Fayth, doth dispose and prepare the soule, and that then, vnto the soule prepared by Fayth our Sauiour is vnited really and truly, not according to the corporall substance of his body, but only according to the spirituall effect of his grace. This sense is also Zuinglian, and condemned by Caluin, as hath been shewed. Thirdly, Presence by Fayth, may signify, presence according to the iudgment of Fayth, or a presence which only Fayth can find out, feele, &amp; behold. This sense is true, and Catholike, and doth suppose the body of Christ to be present absolutely, and independently of Fayth. For were not the body of Christ afore hand present, Fayth should not be true, that iudgeth his body to be present.
                        Whether our Minister be Zuinglian or Caluinist in this point, God only knowes, he speakes obscurely of purpose. He neuer sayth as Caluin doth li. 4. Institut. c. 17. n. 7. That by substantiall communication the body and blood of Christ are vnder the signes of the supper deliuered vnto the fayth full, yet he sayth and often repeates, that the body of Christ is truly, really, &amp; effectually communicated. These words sauour more of the Caluinian then of the Zuinglian phrase. Notwithstanding his adding effectually, after truly and really may draw the speach to be Zuinglian in sense, to wit, that the body of Christ is giuen truly really effectually, that is, really accordinge to the truth and reality of the Spirituall effect, not really according to the truth and reality of the corporall substance.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Zuinglian and Caluinian Presence confuted. §. 2.
                        
                        THE Zuinglian doctrine that the body of Christ is present only in an effectuall signe of grace, not in substance, is against the plaine &amp; expresse words of our Sauiour. For he did not say this is the signe or figure of my body, nor this is the benefit or effect of my body, but, this is my body, and consequently it is his body in substance and essence, if the substantiall Verbe Est, do signify substance and essence. Hence Luther (Epist. ad Argent.) sayth, that the words are nimis clara, toto cleer, and much more cleere then he could haue wished. Caluin also in cap. 11.1. ad Cor. I heare (saith he) what the words of the supper import. For Christ doth giue vs not only the benefit of his death and resurrection, but also the very body wherin he died, and arose againe from death. Yea

                           libro de Coena, inter eius opuscula pag. 133. he saith, that, Negare veram corporis &amp; sanguinis substantiam, to deny the true substance of the body and blood of Christ to be giuen in the supper, is execrabilis blasphemia, auditu indigna, an execrable blasphemy against which we ought to stoppe our eares.
                        
                        The Caluinian Doctrine, that Christs body being only in heauen is Spiritually present, not only by fayth, not only according to the effects of his grace, but also in his bodily substance, yet only vnto the faythfull receauer, not vnto the Sacramentall signe, is both against Gods word, and implicatory in reason. First, it is no lesse then the Zuinglian against the plaine &amp; expresse words of our Sauiour. For our Sauiour by saying, Take, eate, this is my body; drinke yee all of this, for this is my blood (Matth. 26.) doth auerre the Sacrament to be his body and blood, in respect of that taking and eating, vnto which by these words he doth inuite and exhorte. But by this speach he doth inuite, and exhorte vnto Sacramentall and corporall taking and eating. This appeareth by the immediat practise of the Apostles, who vpon these words of our Lord tooke the Sacrament with their corporall mouth. This also our aduersaryes cannot deny, seing they vrge by vertue of these wordes corporall receauing in both kinds. Therfore the words of our Sauiour auerre the reall presence of his body in substance in respect of corporall taking and eating with the mouth of flesh, which Doctrin Caluinists stiffely deny, only holding the substantiall communication of Christs body, in respect of spirituall receauing by the facultyes of the soule.
                        Secondly, their Reall Presence is a fiction to no purpose. For there is no reason to put the Reall Presence of Christs body in the Sacrament, but only in respect of verifying the word of our Sauiour, This is my body, in a true, and reall sense, so making the thinge Christ had in his hand, and which was demonstrated by the Pronowne This, to be truly &amp; really his body. But Caluinists put not a Presence, which maketh the thinge Christ had in hand, and demonstrated by the Pronowne This, to be truly and really his body, but only by figure. This I proue. That which is the body of Christ in figure and shew, and not in substance, is not truly, &amp; really Christ his body. Euen as what is a man in shew and figure not in essence and substance, is not truly and really a man. But Caluinists say that This, or the thinge which Christ hath in his hands, was Christs body in shew &amp; figure, and not in substance. Ergo, they put not a Reall presence which makes that which Christ had in his hand, &amp; did demonstrate by the particle This, to be truly his body. It is therefore a fiction deuised to satisfy

the Caluinian fancy, not the Christian fayth, or the rigurous truth of Gods word.
                        Thirdly, by this Doctrine they bind themselues and others to belieue an high and incomprehensible Mystery, without any necessity or compulsion from Gods word. For what can be more vnintelligible, then that there should be true and reall vnion according to substance, betwixt two distinct indiuiduall substances, that be distant the one from the other, as farre as heauen is from earth. Hence Caluin saith libro de Coena, that this is sublime &amp; arduum, quod neque quidem cogitatione complecti possimus. &amp; in Cap. 11.1. ad Cor. arcanum &amp; mirificum Spiritus sancti opus, quod intelligentiae nostrae modulo metiri nefas sit. But the word of God doth not inforce this Caluinian Mystery, nor is there sufficient ground to affirme it. This is proued, because the mystery of their Reall Presence either hath no ground in Scripture, or is grounded on these words of the Institution Take eate, this is my body. But Caluinists on these words cannot ground the incomprehensible mystery of their reall presence: For they vnderstand these words of our Sauiour in a Figuratiue sense, and say, that they are not true properly, and literally. Now a mystery of Fayth cannot be grounded vpon the Figuratiue sense of a place of Scripture, yea vpon meere Figuratiue construction of Scripture, to obtrude vnto others an article of necessary beliefe, is impudency, as saith S. Augustine Epist. 68. Non nisi impudentiss mè nititur quis aliquid in Allegoria positum pro se interpretari, nisi habeat &amp; manifesta testimonia, quorum lumine illustrentur obscura. Therfore the Caluinian Reall Presence is a mystery incomprehensible, grounded on meere figuratiue construction of Gods word, not backed by any literall text, and consequently it is belieued without necessity, or any Diuine and supernaturall warrant.
                        Hence I Inferre two things: first, that the belieuers of the Caluinian Reall Presence are vnwise. For what greater folly then for men to deny their wits, and breake their heads, to belieue an hard and difficill matter, in belieuing wherof ther is no merit of fayth? In belieuing the Caluinian Reall Presence there is no merit of Fayth: For the merit of Fayth is to captiuate our Vnderstanding vnto mysteryes, cleerly deliuered by the word of God, not vnto mans figuratiue expositions therof, yea no figuratiue exposition aboue reason is to be belieued, except it be proued by some literall text, or be deliuered by the full Tradition as Gods word vnwritten.
                        Secondly I inferre, that Caluinists beare more reuerence vnto Iohn Caluin, then vnto Iesus Christ: for Caluins mystery is belieued by Caluinists

being confessedly a Doctrine most hard, difficill, incomprehensible, and yet not the literall sense of Gods word, but Caluins figuratiue comment ther-vpon: On the other side, Transubstantiation being acknowledged by them to be the litterall and proper sense of the word of Christ Iesus, so that without Transubstantiation, his word, this is my body, cannot be literally true, as our Minister doth confesse pag. 397. yet because it is hard, difficill, incomprehensible, Caluinists cannot be brought to belieue it. What is this but to be more ready to belieue Caluin then Christ? Specially seing the mystery of Christs literall sense is not so hard and vn-intelligible as Caluins figuratiue construction. For one may more easily conceaue a body to be in two places at once, which the litteral sense of Christs word doth inforce, then a body to be truly and substantially giuen, where truly and substantially it is not, which is the article of fayth by Caluins figuratiue construction obtruded.
                     
                     
                        The Arguments agaynst the litterall sense of Christs Word, vayne and idle. §. 3.
                        
                        THE Minister to prooue that the words of the institution are to be figuratiuely vnderstood, bringeth seauen Arguments pag. 391. &amp; one pag. 401. and three other pag. 418. but the first and third of these three are the same with the second &amp; last of the seauen, so that his arguments are Nine in all. These being the summe and substance of all his disputation, I will heere set them downe &amp; answere them, one by one, that the Reader may see vpon what friuolous reasons these men are mooued to reiect the literall sense of Gods word, concerning the highest mysteryes of Fayth.
                        
                           His first Argument, pag. 397.
                           If the substance of bread and wine do remayne, Christs speach, This is my body, This is my bloud, cannot be properly true, because one indiuiduall substance cannot be predicated of another properly. But it shall be afterward by Fathers and Scriptures proued, that the substance of bread and wine remaynes.
                           
                              ANSWERE.
                              You will prooue the substance of bread, to remayne in the holy Eucharist, ad Kalendas Graecas; the meane while, out of what you heere confesse,

I argue agaynst you. You grant that, except Transubstantiation be maintayned, the words of Christ, This is my body, cannot be true in the literall sense. But they must be vnderstood in the literall sense, for on these words the Church of God doth ground a chiefe mystery or Sacrament of Fayth. But (as hath beene prooued) no figuratiue text can be the ground of our beliefe concerning any Sacrament, or mystery of Fayth.
                           
                        
                        
                           The second Argument, pag. 397.
                           
                           The words wherby the wine is consecrated, Luc. 22.20. are Tropicall, by the confession of our Aduersaryes.
                           
                              ANSWERE.
                              First it is not absurd that our Sauiour deliuering some precept, article, or Sacrament, should vse words that are figuratiue and exorbitant, according to the rules of Grammer, if they be not figuratiue nor vnusuall, but ordinary, playne, manyfest, perspicuous, according to the common phrase and vulgar manner of speach. This speach, This is the cuppe of my bloud which is shed for you, if it be figuratiue according to Grammer, yet is it playne, easy, &amp; cleere according to common speach; for no man hearing these words This is the cup of my bloud shed for you, can thinke, that the cuppe, and not the bloud contayned therein, was shed for vs.
                              Secondly, I deny that any word of this speach, This is the cuppe of the new Testament in my bloud which is shed for you, is figuratiue. This is the cup of my bloud, is not figuratiue, seing Christ had in his hand a true cup, not the figure of a cup, and the thing contayned therein was truly and properly bloud. The bloud of Christ is also truly and properly sayd to be the new Testament, for it is the thing required by the new Testament, &amp; Couenant for the remission of sinnes; but commonly and vulgarly men say of the thing required by Couenant, this is our Couenant. Finally, the cup in his bloud is properly sayd to be shed, seing the bloud was truly and properly shed, &amp; so the cup properly shed in that respect, as to say of a cup of wine, this cup is spilt in the wine therof, is not figuratiue, but rather a speach vnnecessarily playne.
                           
                        
                        
                           The third Argument, pag. 397.
                           
                           If the words be taken properly, then the body and bloud of Christ is deliuered and receaued without the soule and Deity of Christ, for in propriety of speach the Body is a distinct and diuerse thing from the soule, and likewise from Bloud.
                           
                              
                              ANSWERE.
                              Thousand instances might be brought that shew your grosse Ignorance in Theology who thus argue. For example, the Ghospell Iohn 1.10. sayth, the Word was made flesh. Is this Argument good, Flesh, in the propriety of speach, is a distinct and diuerse thing from bloud and from soule, Ergo, eyther these words be figuratiue, and do not prooue that the word tooke substantially Flesh, or els we must say that he tooke dead flesh without bloud &amp; soule? S. Peter sayth, that Christ did beare our sinnes in his body vpon the wood, were he not simple that would argue as you do, Body in propriety of speach is a thing distinct from the soule, and from the God-head; Therefore eyther the wordes are figuratiue, and do not proue that Christ did truly suffer in body, or els we must say that his body without soule, and without his Deity suffered on the Crosse. Not so: For though the body be a thing distinct and diuerse from the soule, yet it is a thing vnited and ioyned with the soule, when the person liueth, and so the body of a liuing person cā
                                 not be giuen except the soule be giuen consequently, or by concomitancy therewith. Ordinary Philosophy might haue taught you this, where it is cōmonly sayd, that though the Body be distinct from the Soule, yet cā
                                 not the body be mooued or remooued, deliuered and receaued without the soule, the same going from place to place, per accidens cum corpore, by concomitancy togeather with the body.

                           Seing Christ, as Saint Hierome, Saint Chrysostome, and Euthimius affirme, did himselfe Sacramentally eate and drinke what he gaue to his disciples, if the words be literally vnderstood, then he did eate his owne body, and drinke his owne bloud.

                              You would haue vs belieue, that it is ridiculous and foolish to say, that Christ did eate his owne body, which yet you durst not vtter in playne words: For if Christ (as you affirme) did eate what he gaue to his disciples, eyther he did eate his owne body, or else his word in rigour is false, wherby he sayd of what he gaue to his disciples, Take eate, This is my body. Hence the Fathers, who affirme that Christ did eate what he gaue, affirme that

Christ did eate what he gaue his Apostles, consequently inforced by the euidence of Gods word expressely auerre, that he did eate his owne body, as Saint Hierome ad Hedib. q. 2. Christ in his supper was the eater, &amp; the meate that was eaten. Saint Chrysostome homil. 83. in Matth. That the Apostles might not feare to do the same, Christ himselfe first dranke his own bloud. Yea S. Augustine Concion. 1. in Psalm. 33. sayth, that Christ in his last supper carryed himselfe in his owne hands, secundum literam, according to the letter, which Dauid neyther did, nor possibly could doe.

                           If the wordes be vnderstood literally, then Christ gaue his Disciples his passible and mortall body. But I trow no Iesuit will maintayne, that a body mortall and passible can be in many hoasts, or mouths at once, nor can the same be corporally eaten, without sensible touching.
                           
                              ANSWERE.
                              You might truly haue sayd, I trow no Caluinist will belieue that a mortall and passible body can be in two hoasts or mouths at once, let the word of God say it neuer so expressely, and euen as expressely as these words import, Take, eate, this is my Body, which shall be deliuered for many vnto death, which shall be broken for you on the Crosse. If Christ gaue his body that was to suffer and dye, he gaue his body that was then passible &amp; mortal in many hoasts at once, vnto the mouths of the twelue. Now this being the playne expresse and litterall truth of the word of Iesus, what reason could you haue, to trow, as you doe, that no Iesuit will maintayne it? What Iesuit can you name of so many that haue written of this matter, that doth not expresly maintayne, that Christ in his supper gaue his mortall and passible body, though after an immortall and impassible manner? Hence though in the hoast his body could neyther be sensibly felt, nor suffer, yet otherwise the same might then suffer in the place where it did exist, according to the naturall and proper manner of bodyes.

                              The word of God doth not say, that the body of Christ is broken &amp; his bloud shed in the Eucharist, but onely that the Eucharist is his body which is broken &amp; his bloud which is shed for vs, for many, for the remission of sinnes. Caluin c. 11.1. ad Cor. doth expound broken and shed for vs on the Crosse, where Christs pretious blood was properly shed, his sacred body broken in the flesh, and veynes therof which were there rent into peeces. Besides to be broken for vs, and shed for the remission of sinnes, in this place signifyes to be sacrificed for vs vnto God, as Caluin saith in the former place frangi interpretor immolari. In which sense the body of Christ is broken properly, not onely on the Crosse, but also in the Sacrament, this being a true Propitiatory Sacrifice, as Catholicks teach. Now take what part you will, let the Sacrament be the body &amp; bloud of CHRIST broken and shed for vs, that is sacrifyced for vs on the Crosse, or broken and shed, that is sacrifyced for vs in the Eucharist, still it followes that the Eucharist is the true body and bloud of our Lord, &amp; not bread and wine, seeing Christ neyther in his Supper, nor on his Crosse did sacrifice bread and wine, for the remission of sinnes, but his body and bloud only.

                           Many Fathers treating of the Sacramentall signes, call them, figures, representations, memorialls, antitypes of the body and bloud of Christ. But that which is a figure, similitude, representation of a thing, is not properly the same.

                              First the Maior proposition of your Argument is false.

So S. Aug l. 3. de doctrin. Christ. c. 16. Secondly, that it is a figure of his mysticall body and of the vnity thereof, Origen in c. 15. Matth. Aug. in Psal 3. Thirdly, the bread and wine before consecration be figures of his body &amp; bloud, as S. Ambros. l 4. de Sacram. c. 5. Druthmarus in c. 26. Matth.

                              Secondly, your Minor assertion that the figure of a thing is not the

                                 ame with the thing figured, is impious and directly opposite vnto Gods word. First, Christ Iesus is a figure of his Fathers substance, Heb. 1.3. and yet is he the same substantially with the Father, Iohn. 10.30. Secondly, S. Peter, fishing in the sea, and catching a great multitude of fish, is a figure of himselfe preaching in the world and conuerting soules vnto Christ, Luc.

                                 .10. and yet Peter fishing, and Peter preaching, is substantially the same person. Thirdly, Christ as found in the temple on the third day after his

                                 eesing, was a figure of himselfe rising after the third day of his sepulture,

                                 Ambros. in cap. 2. Lucae. Also Christ as making a shew to goe further in his Iourney to Emmaus, represented himselfe as mounting to heauen, August. cont. mendac. c. 13. and yet Christ found after three dayes, and Christ rising after three dayes, Christ making a shew to passe on, and ascending to his Father is substantially one, and the same person. False then and impious is your assertion, that the figure of a thing cannot be the same with the thing figured, and consequently this your Argument, The Eucharist is tearmed by the Fathers the figure of Christs naturall body; Ergo, it is not substantially, &amp; properly his body, is idle. Hence the finall conclusion is, that you haue no ground in Scripture not to take these words of our Lord, This is my Body, in the litterall sense, and that the true reason you do not litterally vnderstand them, is the difficulty of the matter, and the Infidelity of your hart. Now let vs returne vnto the Iesuits discourse.

                        TO proue this, I suppose as certayne, that the body of Christ is truly and really in the Sacrament of his supper. This I may iustly suppose, seing your Maiesty doth professe to hold a presence Praesentiā credimus non minùs quàm vos veram: haec fides Regis &amp; Regia. Resp. ad Card. Peron. in oper.

For they make the body of Christ, present in the Eucharisticall bread, but as in a figure, holding not a true, nor a reall presence, but only a presence by Imagination &amp; conceypt, This was supposed by the Iesuit as cleere, and hath been proued in the former addition agaynst the Ministers Cauills. as is euident; wherin (as your Maiesty knowes) they contradict the ancient Church, which teacheth expressely that

                        As for some places of Fathers brought to the contrary, how they are to be vnderstood, your Maiesty is not ignorant. S. Augustine 
                           
                              August. in Psal. 3. Idē cont. Adimant. c. 11. saying, that Christ gaue to his disciples a figure of his body and bloud, spake not of a bare empty figure, but of the figure of a thinge really present. As likewise in another place when he sayth, Christ affirmed it was his body, when he gaue a signe of his body; though here he may seeme to speake in the opinion of the Manichees who held that Christ had not true flesh, but a meere figure, shadow, and shape of flesh. Against whō in that place he vndertakes to proue that the figure of a thing may be termed the thing it selfe, alledging, argumento ad hominem, that Christ said, This is my body when he gaue but a figure of his body, to wit, Had not S. Augustine argued in the opinion of Manichees that hold the flesh of Christ was not true, but only a figure of flesh, the Manichees might haue denyed this his example, seing both the Gospell and the Fathers say the Eucharist to be truly Christs body, and not a meere figure. as you thinke.
                        
                           Tertullian 
                           
                              Tertul. li. 4. cont. Marcion.
                            hath this speach: Christ taking bread into his hands, and distributing it to his disciples, made the same his body saying, Hoc est corpus meum, id est, figura corporis mei.
                           
Where figura corporis mei is referred not vnto Corpus meum, as an explicatiō therof, but vnto hoc, in this manner, hoc, id est, figura Corporis mei, est Corpus meum. This to be Tertullian his meaning, appeares by the drift of his discourse in that place. For Tertullian is to shew, that wheras in the old Testament bread was a figure of the body of Christ, as appeares by the words of the Prophet Mittamus lignum in panem eius, id est, crucem in corpus eius; Christ in the new Testament made this figure to be truly and really 
                           Tertullian in saying that Christ made bread his body, doth therby declare the conuersion of bread into his body, euen as the Euangelist doth signify the conuersion of water into wine, in saying, Our Sauiour made water wine. Iohn. 2.9. 
                           his body, taking bread into his hands, saying, this, that is, the figure of my body in the old Testament, is my body truly and really in the new; which is asmuch as if he had said, Bread which anciently was a figure of my body, I do now make to be truly and really my body. And this is vsuall in Tertullian, who not to interrupt the words of Scripture, addeth his explication of the subiect, not presently but after the Attribute 
                           
                              Tertul. contr. Praxeam c. 29., as when he said, Christus mortuus est, id est, vnctus; the sense wherof is Christus vnctus mortuus est.
                        
                        This supposed, I inferre that the body of Christ is present in the mystical supper, not only to the faithfull that receaue the Sacramēt, nor only to the place, or church where the holy Synaxis is celebrated, but vnder the formes of bread in the very same place therwith. This manner of presence is cleerly consequent vpon the precedent,

and that graunted, this cannot be denyed. For the reason vpō which Christians hold the body of Christ to be really and truly present in the Sacrament, is, because they cannot otherwise in proper &amp; plaine sense verify the word of Christ, who sayd of bread, This is my body? Wherefore we must eyther put no Reall Presence at all, or else put such a Reall Presence as is able to verify the foresayd speach in proper and rigorous sense. But if the body of Christ be not in the same place with the consecrated bread, contained vnder the formes therof, it cannot be said to be verily and really the body of Christ. For though we should suppose the body of Christ to leaue heauen, &amp; to be substantially present in the Church where the Sacrament is giuen, yet this supposed Presence would no wayes further the verifying of the words of Christ, This is my body, except his body be veyled &amp; couered with the sensible accidents of bread, so that it be demōstrated by them, &amp; pointing vnto them one may truly say, This is the body of Christ. For why should consecrated bread be tearmed truly and substantially the body of Christ, if his body be not so much as in the same place with The Ministers folly who doth in this place affirme, that thinges distant may be truly &amp; really vnited, is refuted in the Censure. Sect. 3. §. 5. it? Wherefore the Fathers affirme that Christ is so in this Sacrament, as he is veiled with the semblances of bread. As Saint Cyrill of Hierusalem in his booke highly commended by D. Whitaker, 
                           
                              Whitakerus de sacrae Scriptura q. 6. c. 11. Cyrill. Cathec. 4. sayth, Vnder the

forme of bread is giuen thee his body. Yea Mayster 
                           
                              Caluin. in ep. ad Cor. c. 11. Instit. l. 4. c. 17. §. 32. 
                           Caluin sayth, In the supper CHRIST IESVS, to wit, his Body and Bloud, is truly giuen, vnder the signes of bread &amp; wine.
                        
                        Whence it is also consequent, that the whole body of Christ is contained vnder a consecrated hoast, be the same neuer so little. For, in this mystery the body of Christ is demonstrable by the sensible accidences, so that consecrated bread may be tearmed truly, really, and substantially the body of Christ, not a parcell or part therof only. But were not the body of Christ wholy and entyrely vnder the formes of bread, consecrated bread could not truly, &amp; properly be tearmed the body of Christ but a sole part and parcell therof. Agayne, we haue no reason to belieue that the body of CHRIST is truly, and really, in the Sacrament, but only to the end that it may in the Supper be truly, and really

                            eaten, to nourish, and feed mens soules. And if it be eaten only mentally by fayth, we haue no ground to thinke that it is present more then mentally by fayth, this presence being ordayned vnto the mā
                           ducation thereof; for else why did Christ institute this Sacrament vnder the elemēts of bread &amp; wine? But if Christ be not present wholy and totally vnder the forme of bread, he cannot be truly, and really eaten; why then is his body brought from heauen

to be there really present? Or how can the body of Christ being coextended in place according to the naturall dimensions therof, enter into the mouth of the worthy receauer, yea in at the mouth of the When some Fathers seeme to say, that the wicked eate not Christs body, they meane, they do not eate it fruitfully, or thriue in soule by the eating therof. As we commonly say of mē that thriue not by eating, that they do not eate their meat▪ as Beda super Exod. Infidelis carne Christi non vescitur. S. Cyrill, Hilary, Chrysostome, Origen, and others quoted by the Minister p. 407. speake not of meere corporal eating, but of eating by Fayth and thus Infidells and wicked persons do not eate the body of Christ. S. Augustin. in Ioan. tract. 27. saying, that the wicked receaue not rem Sacramenti, the thing of the Sacramēt, by the thing of the Sacramēt, meaneth grace, not the body of Christ. And tract. 59. saying, that Iudas did eate panem Domini, the bread of the Lord, non panem Dominum, not bread that was the Lord, he meaneth that Iudas in his owne persuasion and fayth did not eate the bread that was the Lord, yet he did eate the bread that was the Lord according to truth, &amp; in the fayth of the Church. Iudas (sayth he Ep. 162.) tooke that which the FAITHFVLL know to be the price of their Redemption.
                            wicked and vnworthy receauer, as Fathers teach?
                        Wherefore, seing we must of necessity graunt as I haue proued, that some part of the body of Christ is vnder consecrated bread penetrating the same, &amp; occupying the same place with it, why shold we doubt to belieue the whole body of Christ to be wholy, and totally, in euery consecrated hoast? For if we can belieue that two bodyes be in the same place at once, we may as easily belieue the same of twenty. And if we graunt, that one part of Christs body doth penetrate, that is, doth occupy the same roome with the quantity of bread, why should we not thinke that the rest of his parts may also do the like? Our Sauiour sayth, Matth. 19. That it is more easy for a Camell to passe through a needles eye, then for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of heauen, adding, though these things be impossible vnto men, yet all is possible vnto God. If then God can put a whole Camell into the eye of a needle, is not he able to put the whole body of Christ within the bignes of a consecrated hoast? The body of Christ, which being mortall &amp; passible, could penetrate the body of his mother, &amp; come out of her

wombe through the same, still remayning entyre, as we professe in the Creed to belieue, Natum de Maria Virgine; why may not the same body being now glorious, immortall, and as the Apostle speakes, spirituall, penetrate the quantity of bread, and inclose it selfe wholy, and entierly within the small compasse therof? Christ, that made heauy things not to weigh, as the body of Peter walking on the water Matth. 14.16. coloured thinges not to be seene, as his owne person which he so oft made inuisible to the Iewes; bright thinges not to shine, as his body after his Resurrection more bright then the Sunne, did not shine in so many apparitions to his disciples; finally, a flaming furnace not to burne the bodyes of the three children cast into the midst thereof: why may not he keep a body from occupying a place, or from extruding another body frō the place where it is Read S. Augustine de Agone Christiano c. 24. &amp; serm. 160. who by these examples proueth that a body may penetrate with another, where he saith: Shew me the weightines of flesh in the body that walked vpon the waues, and I will shew the true massines and solidity of flesh in the body that came in the doores being shut, and was borne into the world without vndoing his mothers integrity in his byrth.
                           ? For to occupy a place, or to extrude thence another body, is but an effect consequent, &amp; flowing from the nature of a quantitiue substance; as to weigh, to be seene, to shine, to burne, be the naturall and necessary effects of heauy, coloured, bright, &amp; fiery things.
                     
                     
                        Transubstantiation belonges to the substance of Reall Presence. §. 2.
                        
                        THIS I proue. That belonges to the substance of this Mystery, which being

denyed and taken away, the words of Christ This is my body, cannot be true taken in the literal sense, in which sense they are to be taken, as hath been shewed. But without granting Transubstātiation the words of Christ cannot be true, taken in the literall sense, Ergo, transubstantiation belongs to the substance of this mystery of the Reall presence. The minor is proued, because the speach, This is my body, doth signify that the thing the Priest holds in his hands is truly, really, and substantially the body of Christ. For in the proposition, This is my body, the verbe Est signifyes a coniunction betweene This in the Priests hands, &amp; the body of Christ; and being a Verbe substantiue, in his proper signification, signifyes a substantiall Identity betweene This in the Priests hands, and the body of Christ. But This in the Priests hands being before consecration bread, a thing substantially distinct from the body of Christ, cannot by consecration be made substantially the body of Christ (as the Fathers teach it is) without some substantiall alteration, or change. And what other substantiall chāge can make bread to become truly the body of Christ besides substantial conuersion of the same into his body 
                              The Minister flyes vnto the figuratiue sense, choosing rather to deny the truth of Gods word according to the letter, thē admit Transubstantiation. Against which he hath three arguments scattered in his Reply, which I wil here ioyne togither and answere. The first is pa. 434. the consecrated bread is tearmed very bread, 1. Cor. 10.16. &amp; 11.26.28. Answere. This is a very vntruth. For it is still in those places, tearmed bread, cum addito, with such an addition as signifies that it is not properly bread, but our Sauiours body, 1. Cor. 10.16. The bread we breake, that is Sacrifice vnto God, is the communication of the body of our Lord. And 1. Cor. 11.26. as often as you eate THIS bread, &amp; 27. Whosoeuer shall eate THIS bread vnworthily. &amp; 28. So let him eate of THAT bread, to wit wherof he had said before, that Christ by the verity of his word doth make it his body. Now he that eateth bread turned into Christs body, or made his body doth not truly eate bread. As the Maister of the Marriage-feast in Cana, who tasted water made wine, Iohn. 2.9. did not tast water truly. For as water made wine is not water, euen so bread consecrated and made our Lords body, is not bread.
                              The second is pag. 447. which he setteth out magnificently in a distinct letter, and ech proposition in a seuerall line. The substance is this: If the words of our Sauiour, This is my body, chāge the substance of bread into his body, then also they change the quantity &amp; accidents: For our Sauiour tooke the whole bread into his handes, and sayd, this is my body, as wel vpon the accidents as vpon the substance of bread. But they proue not the conuersion of accidents. For Popish Trāsubstantiatiō is only a conuersion of substance not of accidents. Therefore they proue not the conuersion of the substance.
                              
                                 Answere. The wordes of our Sauiour this is my body, change not euery thing into his body ouer which they be spoken by way of breathing, (for then they should chāge the ayre into his body) but only that, ouer which they are so spoken by way of signification that their signification can not be true in the litteral sense, except that be hi
                                    •
                                  body. Now, the words of Christ This is my body, cannot be true in the litterall sense, except the substance of bread be changed into his body, as the Minister doth confesse pag. 397. lin. 17. But they may be true according to the letter, the substāce being chā
                                 ged though the accidēts remayne. For if the Sacrament outwardly cloathed with the formes and accidents of bread, be inwardly in nature and substance Christs body, then is it truly and substantially his body, and may be sayd to be his body, taking the word, to be, in the proper sense for substantiue being: euen as Iacob cloathed with the garments of Esau was truly and substantially Iacob, and not Esau, though in outward shew and shape he seemed Esau. Therfore the litterall truth of Christs words, this is my body, inforceth vs to say, that the substance of bread is chāged into his body, but not that the quātity of bread is so changed. And thus the magnificence of your argument is marred &amp; proued to be but an empty shew.
                              The third argument is pag. 422.423. In all miraculous substantiall conuersions a new substance is produced, but the body of Christ doth preexist &amp; so cannot be produced. Answer. The maior is false, as appeareth by millions of miraculous cōuersions which partly haue beene, partly shall be. For in the resuscitation of the dead when carcasses are conuerted into men, no new thing is produced, but old things and substances which formerly had been, are reproduced. It is true, the power of nature being limited according to time &amp; place, cannot reproduce, but onely produce at one time, and in one place. But the power of God being infinite, eternall, immense and independent of time and place, can reproduce things that preexist, according to different times and places, as often, and in as many places, as he is pleased. Hence he can, and doth reproduce vpon earth the body of our Sauiour preexisting in heauen, as the Fathers auerre. S. Ambros. l. 4. de Sacra. c. 4. When consecration is done, the body of Christ is MADE of bread. And S. Cyprian serm. de coena. Vsque hodie Diuinissimum &amp; Sanctissimum corpus CREAT. S. Gauden. homil. tract. 2. in Exod. Quia potest, &amp; promisit, de pane corpus suum EFFICIT. S. Hierom. ep. ad Heliod. Sacerdotes corpus Christi proprio ore CONFICIVNT.
                           ?
                        But some may obiect, that as a man shewing a Leather-purse full of gold may truly say, this is gold; or a paper wrapped vp full of siluer, may say, this is siluer; so

the body of Christ being vnder cōsecrated bread, we may truly say, this is the body of Christ, though the substance of bread remayne I answer, that when substances are apt of their nature, and ordayned by vse to contayne other substances, then shewing the substance which containes, we may signify the substance contained, as in the former examples. The reason is, because their naturall aptitude to contayne other things being vulgarly knowne, mans vnderstanding straight passeth from the consideration of the substances contayning, to thinke of the thing contayned therein. But when substances are not by nature and custome ordayned to contayne others, we cannot by shewing them demonstrate another, because their outward forme, signifyes immediatly the substance contained in them. For exāple, one puts a piece of Gold in an apple, &amp; shewing it, cryes, this is Gold; in rigour of speach he sayth not true, because the sense of his words is, that the thing demonstrated immediatly by the formes and accidēts of that apple, is Gold; yea put case that one should say, this is gold, shewing a peece of paper vnfolded, in a manner not apt to contayne any thing in it, he should not say true, though by some deuise he had put secretly into it a peece of gold. Because when the paper is shewed displayed, and not as contayning something in it, and yet is tearmed Gold, the proper sense of that

speach is, that the substance immediatly contayned vnder the accidents of paper, is gold, although it be couered with other accidents then those that vsually accompany the nature of gold.
                        Wherefore the proposition of Christ, This is my body, being spoken of a thing that naturally is not apt, nor by custome ordained to contayne an humane body, it cannot be vnderstood literally but of the subiect immediatly contayned vnder, and demonstrated by the accidents and outward semblance of bread. Now, the thing that lyes hidden immediatly vnder the accidents of bread, which was once substantially bread, cannot become substantially the body of Christ except it be substātially cō
                           uerted into his body, or personally assumed by the same body. And seeing this second manner of vnion between bread &amp; Christs body is impossible, and reiected by Protestants aswell as by Catholiks▪ we may conclude that the mystery of Christs Real presence cannot be belieued in truth by them that deny Transubstantiation; Specially seing our Sauiour did not say, Heere is my body, which speach may be verifyed by the Presence of his body locally within the bread, but, This is my body, which imports that not only his body is truly, and substantially present, but also that it is the substance contayned immediatly vnder the accidents of bread.
                        
                           If any man say, that by this argument it appeares that the doctrine of Transubstantiation is not expressed in Scripture, but from the wordes of the Institution subtilly deduced, and so may perchance be numbred inter scita Scholae, not inter dogmata Fidei. I answere that the cōsequēce of this argument is not good, as is euident in the example of the Incarnation. The doctrine that the vnion of natures in Christ is proper not metaphoricall, substantiall not accidentall, personall not essentiall, is no where expressely set downe in the Scripture, but by subtill deduction inferred from the mystery which Scripture and Tradition deliuer. Notwithstanding, because these subtill deductions are proposed by the Church as pertinent vnto the substance of the aforesayd mystery, they cannot be denyed without preiudice of fayth. In this sort the doctrine of Transubstantiation, though not in tearmes deliuered by the Scripture, but deduced by subtile and speculatiue inference, may not be denyed by them that wil be perfect Belieuers, because the Church hath declared the same to pertayne to the proper sense of Christ his wordes and substance of the mystery.

                        IT is certayne the Fathers acknowledge a transmutation of bread into the body of Christ; &amp; that they meant Transubstantiation, that is, not only a mysticall &amp; significatiue, but also a Reall and substantiall change, appeares by these 5. circumstances of their doctrine in this point.

                           : Thou seest how working &amp; efficacious is the word of Christ. If therfore such vertue is in his word, that therby things that are not, receaue being; how much more hath it power, that the things that are still, remayne (in the general latitude of being, &amp; according to the sensible accidents) and be conuerted into another substance? [VIII.]
                        Fourthly, the effect of this transmutatiō taught by the Fathers, is the presence of the substance of Christs body, &amp; the absence of the substance of bread, binding vs to abnegate our senses, and not to belieue what we seeme to see with our eyes. [IX.] Theophilact 
                              Theophilact. c. 4. 26. Matth.
                           : Bread is transelemented or transformed by an ineffable operation, although to vs it seeme bread, because we are weake, and haue horrour to eate raw flesh, especially the flesh of man; for this reason bread appeareth, but in essence and substance it is not bread. Saint Cyrill 
                              Cyrill. Hieros. Catech. mystagog. 4.
                           : Come not therfore as vnto simple bread and wine, for it is the body and

bloud of Christ, according to the affirmation of our Lord, for although sense suggest the contrary, yet let fayth confirme thee. Iudge not of the thing by tast, but indubitably, &amp; with full fayth belieue, that thou art made partaker of the body &amp; bloud of Christ. And againe: Know this, &amp; with full certitude belieue, that the bread seene is not bread, though it so seeme to the tast, but the body of Christ; &amp; that wine seene is not wine, though tast iudge it to be wine, but the bloud of Christ. [X.]
                        Finally, that the Fathers held Transubstantiation, is prooued by the continuancy which they taught of Christs body in the Sacrament, so long as the accidents of bread last, as appeareth by their reseruing of the same. For reseruation to haue been the custome of the primitiue Church Protestants grant. That

                           the Sacrament was (of some) reserued in the elder dayes of the Church, is not (sayth 
                              Fulke agaynst Heskins, Saunders. p. 77. M. Fulke) so great a questiō, as whether it ought to be reserued. And Chemnitius

And whereas he addeth, haec tamen veritati praescribere non debet, he accuseth the Primitiue Church, &amp; opposeth no lesse agaynst them, then vs. And I am sure your Maiesty knowes, that the primitiue Fathers did vse to send the Sacrament vnto them that were lawfully absent from Church, as doth witnesse S.

And so fully were they perswaded in this opinion that Christs body is permanently in the Sacrament, that Cyrill

enim mutabitur Sacrosanctum corpus Christi, sed virtus benedictionis, &amp; viuificatiua gratia iugis in eo est. They be mad with hereticall folly who say, that the blessed Sanctification of the Sacrament ceaseth if the same be reserued vntill the next day: For thereby the sacred body of Christ is not changed, but the grace of benediction &amp; viuification is perpetuall in it. Now what reason could the Fathers haue thus constantly to defend this continuation of our Sauiour in the Sacramēt, but that they belieued bread to be changed into his body, remayning demonstrable by the formes &amp; accidences thereof, so long as they remayned entyre, and were not changed into the accidences of some other substances? [XI.]
                        
                           A Refutation of the Ministers Shifts, to elude the former Testimonies of the Fathers, according to the reference of the precedent Numbers.
                           [I.] NO words of Scripture, or Christian Antiquity can be so cleere &amp; euident, which Hereticall obstinacy will not wrest against the truth, yea racke till they rent them in peeces by violent interpretations, as saith S. Ambrose Ep. 17. In which kind be the Ministers Replyes vnto these expresse &amp; pregnant testimonies of the Fathers for Transubstantiation, as wil appeare by the confutation which heere ensueth.
                           [II.] Transelementing. The word 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 , Transelemētation (saith the Minister pag. 421.) proueth not Transubstantiation. For in Transubstantiation the matter is destroyed, &amp; the quantity and accidents remayne; &amp; in Transelementation the matter remayneth, &amp; the essentiall &amp; accidentall formes are altered.
                           
                           
                              Answere. The falshood and inanity of this Shift is conuinced by these foure arguments, which shew Transelementation to import the same as Transubstantiation.
                           
                           The First is drawne from the notion of the word Elements, &amp; Transelementation. For Transelementation of bread and wine, into the body and

bloud of our Lord, signifyes, that there is a change betwixt them according to their elemēts. Elements import the primordiall simples, the original principles, the substantiall parts of which a thing is fundamentally composed. Hence Fire, Ayre, Water, Earth, as also the Letters of the Alphabet be tearmed Elements, because both are primordiall simples and substantial parts, the one of mixed substances, the other of wordes and sentences. Now, the body and bloud of Christ, as also bread &amp; wine being corporall substances, the primordiall simples and substantiall principles wherof their nature is originally composed, be substantiall matter &amp; forme, as euery Philosopher knowes. Ergo, Transelementation of bread &amp; wine into Christs body and bloud, doth import that bread and wine be changed into Christs body &amp; bloud, according to their Elements, that is, matter &amp; forme. Is not this Transubstantiation?
                           The second reason is, because in Transelementation matter doth no more remayne then in Transubstantiation: &amp; so your deuised difference betwixt them is false. For as when Transelementation is partiall, that is, according to forme only, the matter remaynes; so likewise in Transubstantiation. For example, when wood is turned into fyre, the forme being destroyed, the matter remayneth. As wood by this change may be sayd to be Transelemented into fire, because it is changed into fire according to the forme, which is one element of wood; so likewise, it may be sayd to be Transubstantiated into fire, because it is changed into fire, according to the forme which is one part of the substance of wood. Though Christians do not vse so to speake, because aswel the word 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                               by the Grecian Church, as the word Transubstantiation by the latin, be consecrated to signify the substantiall change in the Eucharist, which is totall according to both elements &amp; substantiall parts.
                           Thirdly, I thus argue. The Minister grants, that Transelementation doth import an essētial change, or a chāge according to the essentiall forme of bread into Christs body; but this cannot be according to the essentiall forme only, &amp; not also according to the essentiall matter of bread, else the body of Christ should be made bigger by the matter of bread changed into it, as we see the fire to be made bigger by the matter of wood remayning after the conuersion therof into fire. Ergo, seing the Minister grants that Trāselementation imports an essentiall chāge, he must (if he will not be ridiculously absurd) consequently grant, that this change is to tall; else the body of Christ shal be augmēted by the material additiō of bread vnto it.
                           Fourthly, this is proued by the Fathers appropriation of this word

vnto the mystery of the holy Eucharist. For did not Transelementation of bread &amp; wine into Christs body &amp; blood import a substantiall change, but only an accidental, mystical, &amp; significatiue conuersion of them, I aske; First, why do the Fathers neuer say, that the water of Baptisme is Transelemēted into Christs bloud, as wel as they say, that wine is Trāselemented into his bloud? For thus they might haue spoken of Baptisme as well as of the Eucharist, had they been of the Protestants Religion, which is, that water is mystically and significatiuely made Christs bloud in Baptisme, as much as wine in the Eucharist. Secōdly, why do the Fathers neuer say, that our bodyes in the day of iudgment are Transelemē
                              ted into Christs body, but only (as the Minister cites S. Nissen. orat. Catechist. c. 34.) transmutantur, they be transmuted? why this, but because transmutation being a Generall tearme, signifyes any mutation whether substantial or accidental; whereas Transelementation cannot import but a substantial change? Finally, why do the Fathers neuer say, that mans soule is by grace &amp; charity Transelemented into Christ, into whome the same is mystically changed? Theophilact indeed cited by the Minister in Ioan. c. 6. v. 56. saith, that a man is 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              , in a manner Transelemented into Christ, as he might no lesse truly haue sayd, in a manner Transubstantiated into Christ; but that men are by grace Transelemented into Christ, they neuer say. Which be manifest signes, that the Fathers vnderstood by Transelementation, according to the proper &amp; naturall signification of the word, a substantiall conuersion, &amp; not only an accidental, much lesse a meere mysticall change.
                           [III.] S. Cyrill (sayth the Minister) by the words, Conuerting bread and wine into the verity of his owne flesh, vnderstandeth not Popish Transubstantiation, but mysticall &amp; Sacramentall Conuersion, to wit, Conuersion of signification, vse, &amp; operation. For he speaketh of bread &amp; wine, according to their whole nature contayning substance &amp; accidents, but the accidents are only mystically conuerted into Christ his body. Answere. This myst which the Minister would cast vpon this matter by the tearme of mystical cōuersion, serues only to catch Woodcocks; for euery man of iudgment may presently see, that this sense cannot stand with the words of S. Cyrill.
                           
                           For S. Cyrill sayth, that did men see and feele what is inwardly done in consecrated bread &amp; wine, men should find horrour to feed theron, because they should see and feele, that they eate and drinke flesh &amp; bloud. Hence that this may not be perceaued, he sayth, the conuersion of bread &amp; wine, is done inwardly by Christs penetratiue power, conuerting them into the verity of his

flesh and bloud. But did men see, what is inwardly done in bread &amp; wine by the Protestant significatiue conuersion, they would feele no horrour: for in their Tenet, no change at all is made inwardly in bread, but the whole outward substance is assumed as an Instrument to sanctify the soule. If a Christian should see this conuersion of vse &amp; operation; should he see, I say, that bread is eleuated to produce sanctifying grace in his soule, why should he feele horrour to feed thereon? So that it is not only willfulnes against the light of truth, but also folly to expound this place of S. Cyrill, of meere mysticall &amp; significatiue change.
                           [IIII.] Vnto this Testimony of S. Chrysostome, the Minister replyeth in these words. The Father sayth not, that nothing of the substance is left, but the cleane the cōtrary 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 , Nothing of the substance goeth away: &amp; the words which follow 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 , are falsely translated, for they are not, Is consumed by the substance, but, Is coabsumed with the substance. Also the substance of bread is not consumed by the body of Christ, according to the Tenet of many Scholemen. The substance of the externall elements passeth into the body of the receauer, &amp; is consumed, or vnited to the flesh of the receauer.
                           
                           
                              Answere. This your Reply toucheth two points, first the Translation, secondly the sense of this place. I will discouer your vanity about both. As concerning the first, you shew your selfe to be a wrangler, and giuen vnto 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                               condemned by S. Paul, labouring to make those sayings to be dissonant and contrary, betwixt which there is not any difference in respect of sense. What disagreement in respect of sense is there between these two sentences which you say be contrary; When wax is put into the fire, nothing of the substance thereof is left; When wax is put into the fire nothing of the substance thereof goeth away? Certainly they disagree as much as these two, which for sense are iust the same; When meate is set on the Table before the hungry persons nothing is left; When meate is set on the table before hungry persons, nothing goeth away. For when S. Chrysostome sayth, waxe being put into fire, 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              , nothing of the substance goeth away, you cannot (except you would haue him seeme a 
                                 •
                              oole) make him meane, that nothing of the waxe goeth away by consumption, and metling into the fire, (for euery child knoweth this to be false.) His meaning thē is, nothing of the substance goeth away from the fire vnconsumed, but the whole substance is conuerted into fire, as the Iesuit expounds.
                           Also what difference betwixt these two translations which you make Contrary; The mysteries are togeather consumed by the substance of the

body: The mysteries are coabsumed with the substāce of the body? They be punctually the very same in regard of sense, as much as these two are; Wood and Coale are coabsumed with fire: Wood &amp; Coale are togeather consumed by fire. For without question S. Chrysostome saying, that the mysteries are cōsumed with the substance of the body, as waxe is by fire, doth intend, that the body is the Instrument wherby the mysteryes are consumed, as fire is the Instrument to consume waxe.
                           As concerning the sense of this place, that S. Chrysostome doth intend to teach that the substance of bread is cōsumed by the body of Christ, not by the body of the receauer, is euident by the drift of his discourse. Which because it is cleere &amp; pregnant for Transubstantiatiō, I will set it downe in Greeke, as it is in M. Sauells Edition, in the 7. To me amongst S. Chrysostomes Genuine works, Homil. 6. de poenitentia pag. 690. where S. Chrysostome reprehēding them who hauing spent the morning of festiuall dayes in ridiculous vanityes and toyes, yet come to the holy Sacraments, sayth: 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              . Which is in English.
                           
                              After (these vanities) with what confidence doest thou approach vnto the Mysteries, with a conscience so polluted? If thou did'st hold dunge in thy hands, durst thou touch the hemme of the garment of an earthly King? No, thou durst not. Do not regard that it is bread (in outward shew,) do not thinke that it is wine, for it is not meate that is cast out by egestion as others are. God forbidd, do not so thinke. But as when waxe is ioyned to the fire, nothing of the substance thereof goeth away (out of the fire inconsumed;) so do thou thinke the mysteryes are consumed by the substāce of the body. Wherfore cōming to receaue, do not thinke you take the diuine body as from the hand of a man, but as fire from the tonges of the Seraphim.
                           
                           Thus S. Chrysostome, affirming, and prouing that the mysticall bread and wine, be not in truth and substance bread and wine, but the body of Christ, because as waxe is so consumed by fire as nothing of the substance therof escapeth, or goeth away; so the substance of bread &amp; wine is consumed by the substance of Christs body.
                           The conceyt insinuated by the Minister, that S. Chrysostome meanes that the mysticall Elements, are indeed consumed, but by the body of the

receauer, is most seely. For S. Chrysostome, because the Sacramentall bread and wine be consumed by the substance of the body, concludes that therfore when we receaue, we must not thinke we receaue bread and wine in truth, nor ordinary meate such as is cast out by egestion. What discourse can be more sottish then this of S. Chrysostome, did he meane, as you would make him, that the mysticall elements be by digestion consumed into the flesh of the receauer, and that therefore when we take them they be not truly bread and wine, nor such meate as is cast out by egestion; for his reason concludes the playne contrary of what he would prooue. Agayne, S. Chrysostome hauing sayd, that the mysteryes are consumed by the substance of the body as waxe is by fire, inferres that therefore when we receaue, we ought to receaue Christs diuine body, as FIRE from the hand of the Seraphim, which cleerely shewes, that the diuine body of Christ is by him said to be, as FIRE consuming into it selfe the substance of bread &amp; wine, and not the body of the receauer. Where note that this holy Father doth not say, that we should thinke the Sacrament to be a coale of fire taken frō the hand of the Seraphim, but (
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              ) thinke, as if we receaued a coale of fire from the tongues of the Seraphim: whēce is answered the seely obiection the Minister makes, that if we take the wordes of S. Chrysostome as they found, we must say that the Sacrament is fire, and not giuen by the Priest, but by the Seraphim. For Saint Chrysostomes words neyther haue this sense, nor sound.
                           Finally, what he sayth, that the substance of bread is not consumed by the body of Christ, according to the Tenet of many Scholemen, shewes his want of skill to vnderstand Scholasticke Authours. For they all agree, that the body of Christ made present in the Eucharist by vigour of his word This is my body, doth destroy and consume the substance of bread, at the least morally, that is, by binding God to destroy it, that his word may be true, which without the destruction of bread, cannot be true in the sense by him intended. Only the question is, whether the body of Christ as present, haue also physicall opposition with the substance of bread, destroying the same by physicall impression made vpon it; wherein some hold the affirmatiue, some the negatiue part, whome the Minister in his margent citeth saying, substantiam corporis Christi non pugnare cum substantia panis SVAPTE NATVRA. Is not this impertinent?
                           [V.] The Minister heere sayth: It is inconsequent to argue, they are changed in nature: Ergo, their naturall substance is destroyed. For S. Peter speaking of Regenerate persons 2. Pet. 1.5. sayth, they are made partakers of the Diuine Nature,

and yet his meaning is not, that their former substance is abolished.
                           
                           
                              Answere. First the Minister doth not set downe the true force of the argument: For the argument is not, Bread is changed in nature, Ergo, the substance thereof is destroyed; but thus we argue. What is so changed in nature, that it is no longer the thing or substance nature framed, is destroyed according to the substance thereof. This is manifest, for were not the nature thereof destroyed, it should be still the thing and substance nature framed. But S. Ambrose sayth, &amp; bringeth many conuincing arguments out of Scripture to proue, that by consecration bread is so changed in nature, as, Non est quod natura formauit, it is no longer the thing and substance nature framed, but the body of Christ: Ergo, according to Saint Ambrose, bread in the Eucharist is so changed, as the nature thereof is abolished into the body of Christ.
                           Secondly, the example you bring about Regenerate persons, is by you vsed impertinently; and truly pondered &amp; applyed, serueth our purpose. For in Regeneration the substance of man is not abolished, because by Regeneration man is changed to be participant of the Diuine Nature, not from what he is originally by the constitution of nature, but from what he is by the corruption of the Diuell and sinne. Hence by vertue of Regeneration a man ceaseth to be, not according to the substantiall Origen of his nature, but only according to the superinduced peruersion thereof by the Diuell. But in the Eucharist Saint Ambrose sayth, that bread by consecration passeth into the sacred body of Christ, from the thing it was by the framing &amp; constitution of nature: Ergo, bread according to S. Ambrose ceaseth to be according to the thing it is, by the framing of nature, to wit the essence of bread.
                           [VI] The Minister Replyes: That to a mysticall change the omnipotency of God is required, as appeareth in Baptisme. Therefore, although some Fathers require an omnipotent power to eleuate, and change the creatures of bread and wine, yet it followeth not, that they maintayned Transubstantiation.
                           
                           
                              Answere. The Fathers indeed require the omnipotency of God in Baptisme, not to change the nature of water into the nature and verity of Christs bloud, but to the end, that water remayning water vnchanged in nature, be eleuated to produce sanctifying grace in the soules of men. Thus Saint Leo (by you often cited) serm. 4. de natiuit. sayth, Virtus altissimi quae fecit vt virgo pareret Saluatorem, eadem facit vt regeneret vnda credentem. He doth not say (as you would make fooles belieue the Fathers vse to speake) that the Diuine omnipotency doth change the water into the

nature and verity of his bloud; but, That the same power of the Highest makes water, being water, to bring forth regenerate persons, which caused a virgin, remayning a virgin, to bring forth the Sauiour.
                           
                           But about the holy Eucharist the Fathers speake in another manner: They require the Omnipotency of God, not to eleauate bread &amp; wine, that remayning still in nature bread and wine, they may sanctify mens soules, but to change them into Christs body and bloud, by which change they become in thēselues without further eleuation, proportioned meanes to sanctify soules, as cōtaining within themselues the fountaine of grace. Yea the Fathers speeches about the water of baptisme, be so different from their speeches about the bread and wine of the Eucharist, as this alone might suffice to conuert the Minister were he not obstinate. What Fathers say, that Christ at the Mariage of soules with him in Baptisme can, &amp; doth conuert water into his blood by his omnipotency, as he could, and did conuert water into Wine at the carnall Mariage of Cana, as S. Cyrill, &amp; S. Gaudentius cited by the Iesuit, say of the wine of the Eucharist? What Father doth say, that water changed not in shape but in nature, is by the omnipotency of the word, made his flesh, as is sayd of the Eucharisticall bread by the Authour of the booke De Coena Domini?
                           
                           [VII.] Though some question be made, whether this Authour was S. Cyprian, yet learned men both Catholicks and Protestants agree, he was an holy ancient Father: The Authour of the booke de Coena Domini (sayth M. Fulke agaynst the Rhem. Testam in 1. Cor. 11. fol. 282.) was not in tyme much inferiour to Cyprian. Erasmus in his Annotatiōs vpon S. Cyprian printed at Basill Anno 1558. fol. 287. sayth: The Authour was some learned man of S. Cyprian his age, as Pamelius doth demonstrate by many euident reasons; so that we haue Transubstātiation as ancient as S. Cyprian. For what the Minister sayth that this Authour meaneth only a mysticall and Sacramental change to be made, is idle, as I thus demonstrate. The change this holy Father teacheth, is made not in the shape, quantity, &amp; accidēts of bread, but only in the inward nature and essence thereof, panis non effigie sed natura mutatus. But the Ministers mysticall conuersion is made vpon the shape, quantity, &amp; accidents of bread, as he sayth pag. 425. it passeth vpon the quantity and accidents of bread, as well as vpon the substance. Ergo, the conuersion of bread into Christs flesh taught by this holy ancient Father, is an inward substantiall conuersion, and not the Ministers mysticall change.
                           [VIII.] What the Minister sayth to this Argument, that the Fathers affirme, the water of Baptisme to be changed into Christs blood, by the

vertue of his word, is false; nor hath he cited any Father that doth so affirme. Yea such speaking of the water of Baptisme were ridiculous, or rather impious, as affirming thinges about the mysteryes of Religiō, which may make them seeme senselesse and ridiculous, without any ground so to affirme in Gods word. For Christ neuer sayth of the water of Baptisme, Be washed herewith, for this is my blood, as he sayth often in Scripture of the wine of the Eucharist, drinke yee of this, for this is my bloud.
                           
                           [IX.] To the fourth argument the Minister replyes, that, the Fathers exhort People to abnegate their senses in Baptisme, wherein they mantayne no Transubstantiation. I Answere. The Minister still singes the same songe that the fathers speake in the same manner of the conuersiō of water into Christs blood in Baptisme, as they speake about the conuersion of wine in the Eucharist, which is most false; and the Minister hath not cited the wordes any Father so affirming. The Fathers about Baptisme, exhort men to belieue that God can by water wash and purify the soule, and this to be a supernaturall worke aboue the naturall force of water, which one may belieue without contradicting the euidence of any of his senses, yea without any great difficulty in reason. For what great matter is it to belieue, that God being omnipotent, at the presence of water washing the body, can inwardly by grace wash the soule? But about the Eucharist they say, that we must firmely and indubitately belieue, that that which seemeth bread and wine is not bread &amp; wine, but the body &amp; bloud of Christ, so that vnder the forme of bread and wine is giuen vs the bloud of our Lord; and though sense suggest the contrary that it is wine, we must abnegate, and not belieue our senses herein: Shew one Father (I say) that doth thus affirme of the water of Baptisme, that we must firmely, and indubitately belieue the same not to be water in truth, though it be water in shew; and because our sight, feeling, and tast suggest that it is water, that we must with full Fayth abnegate and deny this iudgment framed by sense.
                           [X.] The Minister heere pag. 429. bringeth three triuiall argumēts, to prooue the Fathers held the substance of bread to remayne after consecration, which are not worth the answering; yet I will say a word to each of them, not to omit any thing that may seeme substantiall in his Reply.
                           The first, The Fathers teach that the creatures of bread and wine remayne, but the abstracted shapes of bread and wine be not Gods creatures, but Popish fancyes. I Answere, the force of this argument doth consist in two lyes, the one imposed vpon the Fathers, the other vpon vs. For first, the Fathers you cite

do not say that the Creatures of bread and wine remayne in the Eucharist after consecration, but that the holy Eucharist is made of the Creatures of bread and wine, they being conuerted &amp; turned into the body and bloud of Christ, saying: Before consecration it is bread, but after Consecration, of bread is made the flesh of Christ. Ambros. lib. 4. de Sacram. cap. 4. Secondly we say, that the true, solide, and reall quantity of bread, endued with all the true qualityes and naturall propertyes remayne, and not onely abstracted shapes and fancyes, as you maliciously or dreamingly misrelate our Doctrine. Hence true is the saying of Irenaeus (l 4. c. 34.) that the holy Eucharist is composed of two thinges, the one heauenly, to wit the body of Christ, the other earthly, to wit the quantity of bread endued with the sensible and earthly propertyes thereof.
                           The second, The Fathers teach, that the signes and elements are present, and haue power to feede, and nourish the body; but Mathematicall bread and wine haue not power no nourish the body, for there is in them only the shadow of grayne and grapes; and Papists may as well say, That paynted bread hath power of feeding. Answere. This argument is like the former, grounded on the Ministers false slandering o
                                 •
                               dreaming misprision of our Doctrine. For we hold that the quantity of bread, endued with the sensible vertues, and qualityes of bread remaynes truly, really, substantially, and not only in a shadow and picture of bread. Now the quantity of bread and wine endued with the actiue qualityes, can please, delight, alter and change the body of the receauer, and be agayne altered and changed by the nutritiue power therof, and so nourish the body, as the Iesuit hath declared in the second Consideration.
                           The Third, The Fathers affirme, that the elements of the Eucharist, resemble the mysticall vnion betwixt Christ &amp; Christian people, to wit, bread confected of many graynes of wheat, and wine of many grapes; but Popish fictions, and Mathematicall shadowes of grayne and grapes, cannot resemble this mysticall vnion. Answere. The Fathers do not say, as you impose vpō them, that the Eucharisticall bread and wine, resemble the mysticall vnion betwixt Christ and Christian people, but the vnion Christians must haue betwixt themselues, that they may be vnited vnto Christ, as the mysticall body to their head. To represent this vnion, the sacred signes must be truly bread and wine, not after consecration, but before. For as no substances be conuerred into the naturall body and bloud of Christ, but such as are made of many graynes and grapes vnited togither in one masse, so none can be vnited vnto Christ by grace, and made partakers of his sauing gifts, but such as being many by

nature, are vnited by Charity, concord, and due subordination in one mysticall body, the holy Church. So that not the Eucharisticall signes, but your arguments be fictions and shadowes, without any truth, substance or solidity in them.
                           [XI.] To the fifth argument, the Minister sayth; Because this Iesuit produceth no new matter, but only repeateth what we haue formerly confuted; and especially because Reseruation concludeth not Transubstantiation, I forbeare further examination of the particular Testimonyes produced by him.
                           
                           Answere. With what forehead could you say, that this Iesuit heere produceth no new matter, but ONELY repeateth what you haue formerly confuted? Might not I with truth say, this is more then onelye? For where haue you answered formerly the testimonyes of the Fathers here cited by the Iesuit, that hold the Eucharist to remayne the body of Christ out of vse; and that it is to be worshipped and adored as such? Where haue you answered the Confession the Iesuit doth here produce of Protestants, euen of your Kemnitius (to whom you here refer vs in your margent,) affirming, Reseruation of the Sacrament (which you detest as Idolatry) to haue been the continuall custome of the primitiue Christian Church largely diffused ouer the world, Antiqua consuetudo latè patens &amp; diu propagata; thereby granting Christian Antiquity, Vniuersality, and Continuance to stand for vs, agaynst you?
                           But you say, that Reseruation concludes not Transubstantiation. This proueth your shallow insight into these matters, as by these two arguments I shew. First, the Fathers reseruing the Sacrament, shew they held such a Reall Presence, as by vertue thereof the body of Christ must of necessity be present so longe as the accidents of bread remayne: For they would not haue bound Christians to adore the Sacrament as Christs body, so longe as the proper accidents of bread remayne, had they not held, that the same is the body of Christ infallibly, and by diuine Institution, so longe as the foresayd accidents remayne. But neyther the Zuinglian presence by figure, nor the Caluinian presence by Fayth, nor the Lutheran presence by Consubstantiation, doth (as themselues teach) of necessity inforce the Sacrament to be the body of Christ so longe as the accidents of bread remayne, but only the presence by Transubstantiation hath this nature &amp; force: Ergo, the Fathers held neither the Zwinglian, nor the Caluinian, nor the Lutheran Presence, but the Catholicke Transubstantiation.
                           Secondly, the Fathers as hath been shewed, do perpetually affirme

that bread and wine are conuerted, transelemented, changed into the nature and verity of Christs flesh and bloud, so that Protestants haue no shift to auoyde the euidence of this their Christian consent for our Religion agaynst thē, but by saying they speake only of mysticall conuersion, to wit, of signification, vse, and operation, as sayth our Minister pag. 422. lin. 1. But their reseruing the Sacrament, and adoring the same reserued as Christs body, permanently and out of vse, doth conuince, that they mayntayned another conuersion then meere significatiue of operation and vse, as is manifest. Ergo, the Fathers by reseruing the Sacramēt shew manifestly, two things. First that they held the Catholike doctrine of substantiall cōuersion: Secondly, that Ministers willingly, &amp; against their conscience expound their sayings as teaching no more but Conuersion, of meere significatiō, vse, &amp; operation.
                           Agaynst this consent of Fathers Protestants obiect the testimony of Theodoret 
                              
                                 
                                    Theodoret. Dialog. Inconfusus.
                                 
                                 
                                    Gelasius de duabus naturis aduersus Eutichet.
                                 
                               &amp; Gelasius, who in playne tearmes affirme that the substance of bread and wine remaines in the holy Eucharist, bringing this as an example of the Incarnation, where the natures of God and Man remayne in Christ: Signa mystica (sayth Theodoret) post sanctificationē non recedunt à sua natura. And Gelasius, non esse desinit substantia vel natura panis &amp; vini.
                           
                           I answere, that these Fathers by the nature of bread and wine, vnderstand the naturall qualityes that flow form the nature and essence of bread and wine By substance also, they vnderstand not the inward substance, but outward corpulency &amp; massines of bread and wine.; for ordinarily and in common speach, the naturall accidents and proprietyes of a thing are tearmed the nature of a thing. Thus we say, to be heauy and fall downeward is the nature of the stone, to be hoat and to burne, the nature of the fire, which are but naturall qualityes of stone and fire.

By this, or rather by a more strange manner of speach S. Theodoret Bishop of Ancyra 
                              
                                 Hom. de natiuit. Saluatoris, in corr. Epiph. p. 3. c. 9. to explicate agaynst Nestorius, and Eutiches, the coniunction of two Natures in one Person, by the example of the water that Moyses conuerted into bloud, sayth, That the water was not changed in nature, nor did cease to be water; which in rigour of speach, taking the nature of water for the inward substance thereof, as cō
                              distinct from the naturall qualityes, is not true. But because water chāged into bloud, remaynes according to some naturall qualityes and propertyes which it hath common with bread, as moisture, liquidnes, &amp; the like, he the better to fit &amp; accomodate the similitude sayth, The water remayned according to the nature, that is, according to some naturall qualityes therof. For these Fathers These Fathers vnderstood not the inward Nature of bread and wine to remaine, nor the inward substā
                                 ce, because they say, that the mysticall signes passe by the working of the holy Ghost, into another substane, &amp; yet remaine in the propriety of their nature. So saith Gelasius; which cannot be vnderstood otherwise then that according to their outward nature and substance they remaine, though in their inward nature and substance they be changed, and passed into the substance of Christs body and blood. bring those similitudes to declare the mystery of the Incarnatiō against the Heresy of Eutiches, who denyed the naturall qualityes &amp; propertyes of the two Natures of God and Man to remayne distinct in the person of Christ. This errour they reiected by the example of the Eucharist, where the naturall qualityes of bread, remaine together with the body of Christ in the same Sacrament: which naturall qualityes of bread they tearme the nature of bread (as in some sense they may be tearmed) to the end that the phrase, of two distinct natures remaining, might be common

to the mysteries of the Incarnation and Eucharist, and so the similitude seeme more fit and proper. Yet the Fathers know well, that the phrase did not agree to both mysteryes equally in the same sense. And this obscure vttering of his mind is the lesse to be wōdered at in Theodoret, because he doth professe in that place not to speake plainly, as fearing that some Infidells or Gatechumens were present, to whom the mistery of Transubstantiation was not to be reuealed. Non oportet (sayth he) apertè dicere, est enim verisimile adesse aliquos non initiatos.
                           
                           Much lesse cause haue they to stand vpon the wordes of Saint Augustine, 
                                 August. serm. ad Infant. apud Bedam in cap. 10. 
                              Quod videtur, panis est, quod etiam oculi renū
                                 tiant; quod autem fides postulat, panis est corpus Christi. For the sense is, that consecrated bread is bread in outward appearance, and the naturall accidences of bread truly remayne as the eye doth witnesse, but in wardly and according to the substance it is not bread, but the body of Christ, as fayth requireth we belieue. And it is to be noted that these wordes are not extant in the workes of S. Augustine, but alleadged by Venerable Bede a follower of Saint Augustines doctrine, and so it is not likely they are to be vnderstood, but as Bede vnderstood thē, who sets downe his mind in these words: 
                                 Beda de mysterio missae apud Thom. Waldens. Tom. 2. c. 8.2.
                               
                              The forme of bread is seene, but the substance of bread is not there, nor any other

bread, but only that bread which came downe from heauen. 
                              The Minister pag. 435. to make a shew of many Fathers, addeth vnto Theodoret and Gelasius the testimony of Bertram, S. Chrysostome in epist. ad Caesarium Monachum. S. Irenaeus, S. Damascen. Answere. The booke of Bertram is of no credit, being set forth with many Protestant additions, as themselues confesse, and you may see proued in a Treatise tearmed The Plea for the Reall Presence agaynst Syr Hū
                                    frey Lynd his Bertrā. The Epistle ad Caesariū
                                  Monachum is not S. Chrysostomes. S. Irenaeus his testimony hath been already shewed to be impertinently alleadged. S. Damascen is by you grossely abused, as being brought quite contrary to his mind. For when he sayth (l. 4. de fide c. 14.) As a fiery coale is wood and fire, so the bread of the holy Communion is not only bread, but bread vnited to the Diuinity, he meaneth by the bread of the holy Cōmunion, not bread remayning bread, but bread changed into Christ his flesh. To say that bread remayning bread in substance, is vnited personally vnto the Deity, is impious; &amp; S. Damascen, in that place, doth most cleerly shew, that he speaketh of bread changed into flesh. For thus he writeth: Christ did conioyne his diuinity with bread and wine, that so by thinges that are common, and to which we are vsed, we may attayne to thinges diuine and aboue nature, for verily the body borne of the Virgin, is a body vnited vnto the Deity, not that his body assumpted into heauen doth agayne descend (in the Eucharist) from heauen, but that bread it selfe, and wine are conuerted into the flesh and bloud of God. And a little after: A coale is not only wood, but wood ioyned to fire; so the bread of the holy Communion is not simple bread, but bread vnited vnto the Deity. But the body vnited to the Deity, is not any single nature, but the nature of flesh and the nature of the Deity be conioyned together in it. Thus he, most cleerly shewing, not that the bread of the holy Communion, remaining bread in nature, is vnited to the Deity, to make togither with it a personall compound of two natures (it were blasphemy so to thinke) but that bread chāged into Christs flesh, is vnited to the Deity, because the flesh into which it is changed is not meere and only flesh, but also flesh vnited with the Deity. How intolerably is S. Damascen falsifyed by you? Being truly and fully cited how fully doth he teach Transubstantiation? But such is your Religion you must make a shew of the Fathers to be on your side, though you know in conscience they make agaynst you: you must patch togither some of their mangled sentences to make a gay fooles-coate for your seely Credents, least they seeme naked.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        The seeming repugnances this mistery hath with sense, should incline Christians the sooner to belieue it. §. 4.
                        
                        THE former proofe of Transubstantiation might satisfy, were this mystery not accompanyed with many seeming absurdityes &amp; repugnances agaynst sense, particularly these foure. First, that a body as big as our Sauiours, remayning stil truly corpulent in it selfe, should be contayned within the cōpasse of a round Hoast scarce an inch long and broad. Secondly, that a body so glorious should be combined vnto corruptible elements, and so made subiect vnto the indignityes and obscenityes that may befall vnto them. Thirdly, that the body may be in heauen and on earth, in innumerable places at once. Fourthly, that

the substance of bread being cōuerted into Christs body, the sole accidēts remaine by themselues performing the whole office of substance, no lesse then if it were present euen to the nutrition of mans body. These difficultyes so scandalize Protestants that some condemne Trāsubstantiation as impossible yea as 
                              Field of the Church lib. 3. absurd, ridiculous, barbarous: Others professe they cannot subdue their vnderstandings to belieue it as a matter of Fayth. To giue full satisfaction in this point, I set downe this proposition that these seeming absurdityes should not auert, but rather incline a true Christian mind to belieue this mystery. In proofe whereof I present vnto your Maiesty these three Considerations. The Minister here sayth, that this longe tract about Gods omnipotency is impertinent, because Protestants deny not Gods omnipotency. But this Cauill is refuted in the Censure, Sect. 3. §. 3. where it is shewed that to deny the litteral sense of Gods word about the mysteryes of our fayth to be possible vnto God, is Infidelity. Now Protestants grant the holy Eucharist to be a chiefe mystery of fayth, &amp; Transubstantiation to be the literall sense of Gods word about the same: wherefore this tract about the Diuine omnipotēcy is pertinently brought agaynst them.
                        
                        
                           
                           The first Consideration.
                           The first is grounded vpon the supposall of two thinges most certayne. First, that the Primitiue Church preaching vnto Pagans, Iewes, and other Infidells the rest of Christian mysteryes, as the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Resurrection of the body, did most carefully keepe as much as might be from their knowledge the mystery of the Eucharist, yea Catechumens and Nouices were not before Baptisme fully taught or instructed therein. Secondly, the reason moouing the primitiue Church to be carefull in this point was, least Catechumens &amp; Infidells being fully acquainted with the whole mystery, the one shold be scandalized, &amp; the other mocke therat. Hence it was accounted such an heynous offence that Christians should discouer vnto Infidels, or dispute about the difficultyes thereof in their presence.
                           The Councell 
                                 Concil. Alexand. apud Athanas. Apolog. 2.
                               of Alexandria relating the crimes of Arrians, number this as one of the greatest: They were not ashamed in publike, and as it were vpon a scaffold to treate of the mysteryes before Catechumens, and (which is worse) before Pagans. And a little after: It 
                              
                                 Epist. Iulij apud Athanas. Apol. 2. 
                              is not lawfull to publish the mysteryes before them that are not initiated, for feare Pagans out of ignorance mocke, and Catechumens entring into curiosityes be scandalized. And agayne: Before Catechumens, &amp; (which is more) before Iewes &amp; Pagans blaspheming Christianity they

handled a question about the body and bloud of our Sauiour. And to the same purpose Saint Ambrose 
                                 Ambros. de myster. initian. c. 1. saith: To declare the Mysteryes vnto them that be Catechumens, is no tradition, but prodition, seing by such declarations danger is incurred, least they be diuulged vnto Infidells that will scoffe at them. This supposed, I inferre that the seeming absurdities of the Catholike reall presence, should encourage a true Christian mind to belieue it. For a true Christian desires to belieue, and firmely cleaue vnto the reall Presence that was belieued by the primitiue Church. But this was a reall Presence accompanyed with many (seeming grosse) absurdities that the Church had no hope to satisfy Infidells therein, or to keep them from blaspheming, but by concealing the mystery from them, and consequently they held the Catholicke, not the Protestant doctrine in this point.
                           The Protestāts The Minister pag. 442. lin. 12. saith, that Protestāts hold the elements of bread &amp; wine to remaine, to be instruments of our coniunction by grace vnto God, and that this is a mystery incomprehensible. Answere. First Protestants do not hold the elements of bread and wine to be proper instrumēts infusing grace into mans soule, but that men are iustifyed by their faith onely▪ &amp; that this Sacrament is a meere signe and seale therof. Secōdly, though Sacramental influence of grace into the soule be a thinge supernaturall, yet no mystery of extraordinary difficulty to be belieued, nor absurd vnto sense. For this is no more thē that vpon our eating and drinking of bread and wine in remēbrance of Christs body broken, &amp; of his blood shed on the Crosse, God infuse soule-nourishing grace into the worthy receauer. Now, what difficulty to belieue this? or what seeming absurdity therin? This is no greater mystery, then that vpon the washing of the body with the element of water, God inwardly wash the soule with grace. Wherfore, seing Protestāts cā find in their Eucharist no mystery more hard, &amp; seemingly absurd, thē in Baptisme, doubtlesse it is not the mystery of the Primitiue Church concealed frō Infidells, in regard of the seeming absurdity and immanity therof vnto carnall imaginatiō: whereas Baptisme was not conceaued to be of that seeming absurdity, nor concealed. doctrine that makes Christs body present spiritually by fayth vnto the deuout receauer, that communicating thinkes sweetly of Christs passion and death, contaynes no mystery to be cō
                              cealed in respect of the seeming absurdityes; yea the Fathers did not feare to declare to Catechumens this Sacrament, so farre as it was commemoratiue of Christ and his passion, as appeares by the treatises of Saint Augustine vpon S. Iohn made before Catechumens; out of which Treatises

Protestants for their meere commemoratiue Presence alleadge many sentēces to little purpose. For, he there explicates spirituall manducation by fayth, and he excludes the grosse imagination of eating Christs body in his proper shape, tearing it in pieces with the teeth; but denyes not, yea rather insinuates another kind of spirituall manducation, not only by fayth, but by reall sumption, though to conceale the mystery from Catechumens he speaks not so cleerly thereof. Wherfore as the Palmtree the heauier the weight is that is layd vpon it, the more it riseth vpward, as it were ioying in difficultyes: So a true Catholike Christian feeling in the doctrine of Transubstātiation many seeming absurdityes that presse carnall imagination to the ground, groweth thereby more strong to belieue it, imbracing these difficultyes as manyfest signes, that this doctrine was belieued by the Primitiue Apostolicall Church. On the other side, the Protestants finding the Presence of Christs body by faith to be deuoyd of such difficulties, may by the very lightnes thereof suspect it is not the doctrine which the Fathers concealed from Infidells, as more absurd to humane imagination then any other Mystery of Christian Religion.
                        
                        
                           The second Consideration.
                           This consideration is drawne from the

quality of the difficultyes obiected agaynst this mystery, which be such, as a Christian in honour should neglect them 
                                 Vnto this argument, shewing God cā couer the face of the whole world with thinner &amp; thinner parts taken out of a flyes wing, euery Puny in our Vniuersities saith the Minister. pag. 448. can distinguish betweē mathematicall and potentiall diuision of a body, &amp; physicall and actuall; Aristotle him selfe teaching vs, that there is minima Caro, though there be not minimum corpus. Answere. By this reply you shew your selfe to be not so much as a Puny in Philosophy. For not knowing what you say, you grant vnto your Aduersary as much as he would proue, because you vnderstād not the Philosophicall tearmes you vse. He did not say that the winge of the fly, is physically or actually diuided into so many thinne parts, as would couer the world, but only, that it is diuisible into so many thinne parts; but you do not deny, but there is so much potential or possible diuisiō in the flyes winge. And if the diuision of a flyes winge into so many thinne parts as will couer the world, be potentiall and possible, I hope you will not deny but God can make the same actuall; except you will say, that there is in the quantity of a flyes winge more potentiality to be deuided, then in God power to deuide, so denying him to be Omnipotent.
                                 Secondly, your coming forth with Aristotles minima caro, sed non minimum corpus, doth more &amp; more bewray your Ignorance. For the Philosophicall disputation de termino paruitatis, is de minimo naturali, whether a thinge homogeneous, that is, whereof euery particle is of the same kind with the whole, as water, fire, flesh, can be so little as it cannot be lesser or thinner by the course of nature; wherein many learned Deuines hold the Negatiue part, that no flesh is so little, but it may be lesse by the course of nature. But in respect of the Diuine power, no Christian Philosopher doth hold there is minima caro, flesh so litle and thine, that God can not make the same lesser and thinner without end, and so with a flyes winge couer the world. And whereas you iestingly require you may haue respite not to belieue Transubstantiation, vntill this vast worlds Capcase be made of a flyes winge; you may haue your desire, so you cā be contēt the meane tyme, to vndergoe the punishment they must endure, who will vndertake to comprehend the Omnipotency of God within the CAPCASE of their idle brayne.
                              . For if it be the part of a prudent &amp; intelligent man, not to permit imagination to preuayle agaynst his reason, what a disgrace is it for a Christian that his fayth should be conquered by these kind of difficultyes? For that the seeming absurdityes of this mystery be not in respect of naturall reason, but meerly of imagination, may hence appeare, that some naturall truthes be in a manner as difficill and incredible; which wil be seene, if we compare the foure aboue mentioned difficulties, with the difficulties some truthes, euident in nature, haue.
                           First, we cannot imagine, that the whole body of Christ can be contayned in the cōpasse of a small hoast. But it is not more incredible, that in a thing of small quantity, for example in the winge of a fly, there should be so many parts, as vnfolded and layd togeather would couer the whole face of the world, both of heauen and earth: And yet it is demonstrable in Philosophy, that euen in the wing of a fly, there are so many parts, as broad &amp; long as the wing, though still thynner and thinner, that Almighty God separating and vnfolding thē, may therewith couer the whole world. For certayne it is, that some finite number of such parts so separated, each of thē as long, and as broad as a flyes winge, would couer

the face of the whole world. Certayne also it it that the winge of a fly is stil diuisible into more &amp; more such parts that no finite number of them is assignable, but God may still separate from that winge a greater nū
                              ber without end. Therefore it is certayne, that in the wing of a fly there is so much quantity as is sufficient to couer the face of the whole world both of heauen &amp; earth, if God would but separate and vnfold the same. Is not this secret of Philosophy as incredible to carnall imagination, as the being of Christs body within a small hoast? We that cānot comprehend thinges we see with eyes, and feele with hands, certaynly we shall haue much adoe at the day of Iudgement to iustify our not belieuing any part of Gods word, by reason of the seeming absurdityes therof.
                           Secondly, we cannot imagine the body of Christ to be really combined vnto the consecrated formes, and not to be polluted by such indignityes as may happen vnto the formes; yet we haue seene, or may see thinges able to make this not to seeme incredible. For holy men often by prayer so purify their soules, and by contemplation bring their spirits to such an independency of their senses, that neyther bitter meats offend their tast, nor loathsome sents their smell, nor shrill cryes their hearing; yea burnings &amp; torturings are not perceaued, their spirit being eloyned, through diuine

vnpolluted affection from the cōtagion of the body, vnto the substance wherof it still remaynes most really vnited. This being so, cānot the glorious body of Christ (graced with most diuine ornaments, flowing from the excessiue blisse of the soule, and and thereby made spirituall, impassible, &amp; vnsearchable) be really present vnto the formes of consecrated Bread, and yet immune, free, and wholy independent of any contagion or corruption that may happen to the formes, specially the body of Christ not being so strictly and substantially tyed vnto the formes, as the spirit to the body it informeth, but is present vnto them as an Angell assistāt is to the body wherein he worketh; what dishonor can it be to attribute vnto Christs most venerable body this spirituall manner of Angelicall presence, yea rather a participation of the diuine immensity? For as God by his incomprehensible immēsity existes euery where no lesse pure in the sinke, then in the sunne, no lesse sweet in the dungehill, then in a garden of odoriferous floures: So the body of Christ by supernatural participation of his diuine presence, is really vpon earth in things visible inuisible, in thinges hurtfull impassible, in thinges noysome inuiolable, in things impure immaculable, to his friends that receaue him with loue most sweet and comfortable, and ouerflowing in graces; but to the vnworthy receauer present in a

manner dead &amp; senseles, as if he were not there at all. And as he that receiues into his armes a body, wherin the spirit absorpt in contemplation, neyther feeling nor felt, lyeth inclosed, may be sayd to imbrace the body without the spirit, which is in that body insensible, and as good as if it were not there: So they that receaue vnworthily, are sometymes sayd by the Fathers 
                                 August. tract. 26. in Ioan. &amp; 25. Caeteri Apostoli manducauerunt panem Dominū, Iudas autē panem Domini., to receyue the Sacrament without the body of Christ, because though the body of Christ be really in the Sacrament they receaue, yet he is there in a dead manner in regard of them, as if he were not there at all, because he stirres not vp heauenly affections in them, nor makes them feele the workings of his grace, &amp; loue.
                           Thirdly, we cānot imagine the same body can be in many places togeather at the same tyme, it is true; but as hardly can we imagine the soule to be in the head and in the feet of a man, one &amp; the same, without diuision in it selfe; or, an Angell to be in two Townes of the Countrey wherof he is President, as farre distant one from the other, as Yorke from London. Also who can conceaue God who is infinitely one &amp; indiuisible, to be both in heauen, and on earth at once? Of which incomprehensible manner of presence Saint Augustine sayth 
                                 August. ep. 3. ad Volusian.
                              : Miratur hoc meus humana, &amp; quia non capit, fortasse non credit. What meruayle that imagination fayles vs to apprehend the

multiplyed Presence of Christs body in the Sacrament, which is spirituall, Angelicall, and supernaturall, comparable with the diuine, that S. Gregory Nissen 
                              
                                 Greg. Nissen in orat. de Pasch.
                               stickes not to say: Sicut Diuinitas replet mundum, &amp; tamen vna est, ita innumerabilibus locis offertur, &amp; tamen vnum corpus est? The body of Christ being glorious, is for operation as swift and agill as any thought, but a mans thought is so quicke, that one may be by thought in two disioyned places at once, for example in London, &amp; at Rome. Some Deuines 
                                 Caiet. 1. p. q▪
                                  52. art. 2. Ferrar. 3. contra Gent. ca. 65. Marsil. in 2. q. 2. ar. 2. Dionys. Cister. in 2. dist. 6. q. 1. art. 1. conclus. 6. giue such agility to Angells, that they can place themselues substātially where they please by a thought, &amp; thinke that as their thoughts, so likwise their substances are so independent of corporall state, that they can be naturally in two distinct places, without being in the spaces interiacent But the agility of Christs glorious body is more excellent and perfect as being supernaturall, then the naturall agility of Angells, yea then of thoughts; why then should we make any doubt, but he may be in disioyned different places at once?
                           Fourthly, we find difficulty to conceaue, that accidents existing separated from any substance, can performe the office of substance euen to the nourishment of mans body: but we should perchance find as much difficulty to belieue, that of a little Kernell of an apple a great Tree may be

made, and nourished by the force and vigour proceeding from the same, did we not see by dayly experience the same to be true? That ashes may be made glasse; that stones in the stomake of a Doue; yron in the belly of an Ostridge be turned into flesh; that of a rotten barke of a tree falling into the water, should be bred &amp; produced a perfect bird to me seemes more incredible, then that God should make the accidents of bread separated from their substāce to nourish mans body The Minister heere laboureth to shew a difference betwixt the wonders of Nature, &amp; the Miracles of the holy Eucharist, which is impertinent. For the Answerer doth not intend, that there is the same kind of strāgenes in both, but argueth, That seing in Nature such incomprehensible thinges be found, we ought not to deny the litterall sense of Gods Word, for any difficultyes that may occurre.. For the dead barke of a tree may seeme to haue no more efficacy of it selfe to produce a liuing creature, specially so perfect a bird as a Barnacle, then haue the accidents of bread to feed &amp; breed the flesh of a liuing man: yea many Philosophers teach, &amp; in my iudgement conuince, that in substantiall generations where no cause coequall in perfection to the effect produced is present, God by the secret operation of his power, supplyes the deficiency of naturall causes; Why then should any man so much mislike our doctrine, that, in this mystery, where the substance of bread is wanting, God by the secret operation of his power, supplyes the defect thereof; seing by the opinion of many learned Philosophers, his Prouidence by the like secret special working, doth ordinarily, dayly, and hourely supply the manifold defects of substantiall secondary agents. Neyther is the manner how God

can doe this, difficill to explicate. For he may enable the quātity of bread to receaue and sustayne the working of mans nutritiue power, &amp; when in that quantity there is the last accidentall disposition to the forme of flesh, he can secretly produce againe materiā primā, that was of the bread, and combine the same with the prepared quantity, &amp; the substantiall forme of flesh; what reason is there, why God may not do this, yea do it sooner then we speake it?
                           Wherefore the seeming absurdityes of this mystery, being (as I haue shewed) meerly imaginary, and not like those agaynst the Trinity, and the Incarnation, wherein not so much imagination as reason findes difficulty; it is the part not only of sincere Christian Fayth, but also of a cleere excellent wit, to contemne them, &amp; not to permit wandering vnruly fancy destitute of reason, to controule our beliefe about the The Minister here pag. 454. rayles lustily, saying: That the Romists presūptuously forming Chimera's and Idols in the forge of their own deceaued brest, deserue to be fed only with accidents, as the birds that pecked at paynted grapes. All which is both blasphemous &amp; simple: for what more impious then to tearme the litterall sense of Gods word concerning the misteries of faith, such as our doctrine about the same is cōfessed to be, a Chimera and Idol, framed in the forge of a deceaued brest? What more seely, then to thinke the Protestants Sacrament, being a figure of Christs body, &amp; in substance but bread, a more substātiall food of the soule, then the Catholickes, which is in shape &amp; shew bread, in essence &amp; substance the pretious flesh of the Sauiour? Be not Protestants rather the birds that peck at the picture figure, &amp; shape of their soules food? Is not the soule better fed with the litterall, playne, &amp; substantiue sense of Gods word, thē by the figuratiue comments of men? literal sense of Christs words so many wayes by the grauest testimonyes of Antiquity recommended vnto vs.
                        
                        
                           The third Consideration.
                           Thirdly, to make Christians incline to belieue this mystery so difficill to carnall Imagination, this Consideration may be very potent, to wit, that in belieuing the same on the one side there may be great merit and excellent Fayth, if it be a truth,

and on the other side, though (which is impossible) it should be false, yet in belieuing it, we shall not fall into any damnable errour. For although we suppose this vnpossible case, yet what can be layd to our charge which we may not defend, and iustify by all the rules of equity and reason? If we be accused, that we tooke bread to be the body of Christ, adoring the same as God, so committing Idolatry, we may defend, that both for soule and body we are innocent heerin. For seing the body is not made guilty but by a guilty mind, euen our body may plead not guilty, seing our mind, our thoughts, our deuotiō were totally referred vnto Christ, whom we truly apprehend by faith, as veyled with the accidents of bread, and so may repell the reproach of 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              , bread-worshippers, with saying,
— Quae vouit mens est, pani nil vouimus illâ.
                           
                           Neyther did we belieue that the bread was changed into Christs body vpō slight reasons, or mooued by the fancyes of our own head, but contrary to our fancyes, out of reuerence to the The Minister here contradicting himselfe sayth, that Trāsubstantiation is not inuolued in the litterall sense of Gods word. And further, that the same was neuer defined in Generall Councells. For as the Ariās would allow no Councell to be lawfull which condemned Arius, so with these mē no Councell is lawfull vpon which Iohn Caluin will not bestow his Blessing. Otherwise, why should not the Lateran Councell vnder Innocent the third, and the second Councell of Nice celebrated aboue eight hū
                                 dred years agoe, where the substātiue reall presence is defined, and the figuratiue condemned, be lawful &amp; general, in which both the Latin, and Grecian Church did concurre to define? expresse wordes of Christ, This is my body: A sense declared by most ancient Fathers, defined by many Generall Councels, deliuered by full consent of our Ancestours, so practised in the Church for many ages, without any knowne beginning; Finally, confirmed with the most credible &amp; cōstant report of

innumerable The Minister sayth, that these Miracles be but the lyes of Fryars, which he proues by a iest that was rife in the mouth of Wickliffifts, Est Frater, Ergo mendax. Answer. The miracles done in proofe of the Corporall and substantiall permanent presence of Christs body in the Eucharist, are related by most auncient Fathers and writers, of which many whole Townes, Cittyes, and Countreyes haue been eye witnesses, as it were madnes to questiō thē. These may be read in Ioannes Garetius, who hath gathered them together, as also in Iudocus Coccius. The Prouerbe He is Fryar, Ergo a lyar, is true of such Fryars as Martin Luther, Bucer, Peter Martyr, Fryar Barnes, and the like founders and pillars of the fifth Gospell. And if the matter be looked into without passiō, this inference, Est Minister, Ergo mēdax, will seeme more iustifiable; euen in Caluins iudgement, who sayth, that most of them that shew most zeale, are ful of falshod, fraud, &amp; lying. Hierom Zanchius a famous Protestāt in the Preface of his booke contra Arianum Anonymū, saith of Ministers; That euen they who are tearmed Pillars of the Ghospell, are for the most part impudēt lying companions, that out-face the truth euery way; thereupon exclayming, O Tempora! O Mores!
                               most euidēt miracles. Can a Christian belieue any point of religion vpon surer grounds? And if God at the day of Iudgement will condemne none, but such as liuing in this world, wronged him in his honour; why should Catholikes feare any hard sentence in respect of their prōpt credulity of Transubstātiation, that is, of Gods word takē in the playne proper sense? Is it any iniury to his verity, that they deny their senses, correct their imaginatiōs, reforme their discourses, abnegate their iudgments, rather then not to belieue what to them seemeth his word? Is it iniury to his power to be perswaded that he can doe things incomprehēsible without number? put the same body in innumerable places at once? make a body occupy no place, &amp; yet remayne a quantitatiue substance in it selfe? Is it iniury to his charity to thinke, that loue vnto men makes him vnite himselfe really, and substantially with them, &amp; to be (as it were) incarnate anew in euery particular faythfull man, entring really into their bodyes, to signify efficaciously his inward cōiunction by spirit vnto their soules? Finally, is it any iniury to his wisdome to belieue, that to satisfy on the one side the will of his Father, that would haue him euer in heauen sitting at his right hād; on the other side, the ardency of his owne affection vnto men, desiring to be perpetually with them, he inuented a manner how

still remaining glorious in heauē, he might also be continually on earth with his Church; secretly, not to take from them the merit of Fayth, yet to affoard full satisfaction to his owne loue; really, by continuall personall presence, and most intime coniunction with them?
                           On the other side, it imports them that thinke Transubstantiation impossible, or that God cannot put the same body in different places at once, to consider, if they erre (easy it is for men to erre that with the compasse of their vnderstanding measure the power of God) how dangerous &amp; inexcusable their errour will prooue, when they shalbe called to giue vnto their omnipotent maker a finall account, particularly of this doctrine, so much derogating from him? Let them thinke how they will answere if God lay to their charge the neglect of that most prudent &amp; reasonable aduise which S. Chrysostome [Homil. 83. in Mat.] giues: Let vs belieue God, (sayth he) let vs not resist his word, though the same seeme absurd vnto our cogitation &amp; sense, for his speach doth surpasse our reason and sense, his words cannot deceaue vs, but our senses be deceaued easily and often. How will they reply, if they be pressed with the interrogatory which S. Cyrill l. 12. in Ioan. makes vnto such vnbelieuers: If thou couldst not comprehend the diuine operation of God, why didest thou not accuse the imbecillity of mans

wit, rather then the omnipotency of God? Or how (disputing &amp; proposing so many Arguments agaynst Gods power, reiecting or questioning the same, because they could not vnderstand it) neuer called they to mynd the saying

                        THE doctrine of Concomitancy is, that vnder the forme of bread, not only the body of Christ, but also his pretious bloud and blessed soule are truly, and really conteyned; the body directly and by vertue of the wordes of consecration, the bloud and the soule consequently. For being conteined within the body of Christ, they must needs concomitate, that is, follow the body in what place soeuer the same be The Minister pag. 460. sayth, The bloud of Christ cannot properly he sayd to be in his body by Concomitancy, (for then it were accidētally therein) but as a part in the whole. Answere. We do not say, bloud is accidentally in the body of Christ or by concomitācy, but that it is by concomitancy in the same place with the body. As the soule is not by concomitancy in the body of a liuing man, but as a part in the whole, yet as Philosophy teacheth Mouetur per accidens cum corpore, it is moued, and remoued accidentally, and by concomitancy with the body; You must then distinguish, To be in the body, frō To be in the same place with the body. The soule is in the body by direct substātiall vnion therwith, but in the place of the body the soule is not directly, but by concomitancy, in regard of her coniunction with the body, which is directly in place. In this maner the soule, and bloud of Christs be directly and substantially in his body, yet only by concomitancy in the Sacrament vnder the forme of bread, where the body only is directly by vertue of the words. In this sense also the Deity is in the Sacramēt by Concomitancy. For the Deity is not expressely signifyed to be in the Sacrament by vertue of the words, which only affirme Christ his body to be present; yet is the Deity present vnto, and vnited with the body present by the vertue of the word. Hēce the Deity is present by Cōcomitancy, so that though otherwise it were not present, yet should it be heere present by Concomitancy, because inseparably ioyned with a thing that is present.. Neyther can any that acknowledgeth the Reall presence, deny this Concomitancy without falling into many absurdities, as I proue by three Arguments.
                        First, he that acknowledgeth the Reall presence of Christs sacred Body vnder the forme of bread, and denyes Concomitancy, doth in his beliefe separate the bloud, &amp; soule of Christ from his body: But to separate eyther Christs Diuinity from his Humanity, or soule frō his body, or his bloud from his flesh, is vnlawfull. For such a belieuer doth dissolue and destroy Christ Iesus, and so is one of the number of them that Saint Iohn condemneth, Omnis spiritus qui soluit Iesum non est ex Deo, &amp; hic est Antichristus
                           
                           1. Ioan. 4.3.
                           . And this Argument hath greatest force in their opinion, who shall think that Christ leaues heauen for the tyme, &amp; comes downe really according to his body and bloud; for how can the body of Christ come downe from heauen without bloud and soule, vnles he come down dead? And so Christ should be not only mystically &amp; figuratiuely, but truly &amp; really massacred in the Sacrament, and the Eucharist be a bloudy sacrifice, and not incruent, as the Fathers tearme it.
                        Secondly, the Priest in the person of Christ who is glorious in heauen, or rather Christ being glorious in heauen, by the mouth of the Priest, sayth, This is my body: but a body deuoyd of bloud without soule, and consequently dead and senselesse, is not the body of Christ as he is now glorious in heauen, which hath bloud in the veines, and is informed and glorifyed by a most excellent soule. Therfore Christ glorious in heauen cannot say truly, that a body voyd of bloud sense and soule is his body, but soule, life, and bloud must needes follow, and concomitate his body wheresoeuer it be.
                        Thirdly, if vnder the forme of bread were only the body of Christ, and his soule and bloud were not by Concomitancy there, the Communicants should receaue the body of Christ, but not truly Christ, as our Aduersaryes graunt; Caluin specially

saying;

                           by the consecration of the mysteryes we receaue the very Son of God; That

                           vnder the forme of bread we lodge within vs the soueraygne King; &amp; that 
                              Chrysost. homil. 83. in cap. 26. Matth. &amp; hom. 24. in 1. ad Cor.
                            
                           we see Christ, feele Christ, eate Christ, non regium puerum, sed ipsum vnigenitum Dei Filium. An hundred other places might be brought where the Fathers call the consecrated bread Christ, &amp; consequently they did not thinke there was the meere body without bloud and soule, seing, as Caluin doth confesse, It is an absurd manner of speach to tearme Christ the meere body of Christ: And such a forme of speach was neuer heard of hitherto in the world. Ergo, Concomitancy, that is, Christs reall &amp; entyre body, soule, flesh, bloud to be vnder the forme of bread, was acknowledged by the Fathers. 
                              The Minister pag. 462. proposeth this argument agaynst Concomitancy, which he thinkes to be so stronge and glorious, as he sets the same in a distinct letter, &amp; ech proposition in a distinct line, to call the eye of the Reader vpon it.
                              
                                 Whatsoeuer is receaued in the Sacrament was before offered to God on the Crosse. But the body of Christ hauing soule and bloud in it by Concomitancy was not offered to God vpon the Crosse. Ergo, at this day soule and bloud be not in the body of Christ by Concomitancy &amp;c.
                              
                              I answere. This argument serues as a myrrour, wherein Learned men may see and admire our Ministers want both of Philosophy, and Logicke. His want of Philosophy in not distinguishing the being by Concomitancy in the body, from being by Concomitancy in the place where the body is. The body of Christ neyther on the Crosse, nor in the Eucharist hath soule &amp; bloud in it, and vnited with it by Concomitancy, yet the body of Christ not only in the Sacrament, but also on the Crosse had soule and bloud present with it by Concomitancy, or consequence. For the soule being substantially vnited with the body, and bloud contayned within the body, they were consequently inforced to be togeather with the body in the same place on the Crosse.
                              Hence the Ministers argument is turned agaynst himselfe: That body is receaued in the Eucharist, which was offered to God on the Crosse; but Christs body hauing soule and bloud in the same place with it by Concomitancy, was offerred to God on the Crosse. Ergo, the body of Christ hauing soule in the same place with it by Concomitancy, is in the Sacrament.
                              His ignorance in Logicke is likewise very specious and notable, to present vnto the world, with so great solemnity, an idle Sophisme, and Fallacy, tearmed by the Logitians, Figurae dictionis. Of which fallacy one kind is, when from the substantiall word one argueth vnto the accidentall. As for example, this Sophisme: What meate soeuer thou didst buy in the market, thou dost eate at dinner: but thou did'st buy raw flesh in the market: Ergo, thou dost eate raw flesh at dinner. And this likewise: What fingers soeuer thou had'st being a Childe, thou hast now being a man: thou had'st little fingers being a Child: Ergo, thou hast little fingers now being a man. Iust of the same frame &amp; fashion is our Ministers argument. What soeuer is receaued in the Sacrament was offered on the Crosse: A body that had not blood in it by Concomitancy, was offered on the Crosse: Ergo, a body not hauing blood in it by Concomitancy is receaued in the Sacrament. If this forme be good, one may proue that we do not now receaue the body of Christ risen from death. Whatsoeuer is receaued in the Sacrament was offered on the Crosse: A body hauing soule and blood in it by vertue of resurrection from death to life, was not offered on the Crosse: Ergo, a body risen from death, or hauing soule and blood in it by vertue of resurrection from death, is not receaued in the Sacrament. Here your Ladyes may see with what Baberyes you delude their Ignorance arguing from the Substantiall vnto the Accidentall tearme. For though Christs body receaued in the Sacrament be the same that was offered on the Crosse in respect of substance, it doth not follow that therefore it is the same also in respect of accidents, qualityes, and circumstances. Hence his body may now haue blood and soule by Concomitancy with it in the Sacrament, though it had not had blood &amp; soule by Concomitancy with it on the Crosse.
                           
                        
                        This principle supposed, which is no lesse certayne then the true real presence, I inferre the lawfulnes of Communion vnder one kind (to wit vnder the sole forme of bread) by this Argument. If communion vnder one kind be not agaynst the substance eyther of Christs institution, or of

his Sacrament, or his precept, or of the practise of the primitiue Church, it is lawfull, iustifiable, &amp; for iust reasons may be commanded by the Church. This proposition is true▪ because there neyther are other causes of dislike that may not be reduced to these foure; neyther doth Christs Institution, or Precept, or the Primitiue practise binde vs to keep them, further then in substance, the accidentall circumstances of institutions, Sacramēts, precepts, primitiue Customes being variable according to the variable disposition of thinges vnto which the Church militant in this life is subiect. Now I assume, Concomitancy being supposed, it may be made euident that Communion vnder one kind is not agaynst the substance eyther of Christs institution, or of the Sacrament, or of his precept, or of the primitiue practise. For the substance of these foure obligations is one &amp; the same, to wit, that we be truly &amp; really partakers

of the body and bloud of our Sauiour, which is The Minister p. 467. saith: Though Concomitancy be granted, yet Communion in one kind, is not iustifyed, because the blood by Concomitancy is receaued in the veines of the body, not as shed out of the veynes: But people must receaue the blood of Christ represented as shed, which is not done, but by receauing the Cuppe. Answere. The essence of the Eucharist as it is a Sacrifice, is to represent the effusion of our Lords blood, &amp; so can not be entyre in one kind. But the essence of the Eucharist as a Sacrament is to represent the body and blood of our Lord, as the foode of the soule. But in eyther kind, the body and blood to be sufficient food of the soule, the Iesuit prooueth: so that people be not boūd so receaue the bloud represented distinctly, and expressely as shed, but only the Priest that doth sacrifice. fully done by Communion vnder one kind, as I will shew in the foure consequent Sections.
                     
                     
                        
                        Communion vnder one kind not agaynst the substance of the Institution of Christ. §. 2.
                        
                        DIVINE Institution is an action of God, whereby he giues Being vnto things, with reference vnto some speciall end. This end is twofold, the one corporall and temporall for which God hath instituted agreable and conuenient meanes. That men may be borne into this world, he did institute marriage: and for maintenance of the sayd life being had, he ordayned many sorts of meate. The other end is spirituall, for which God hath instituted Sacraments; as, for the first obtayning of grace and spirituall life, the Sacraments of Baptisme &amp; Pennance; for the preseruing of grace &amp; increasing therein, particularly the Sacrament of the Eucharist.
                        That a man be bound to vse the Institution of God, two things are required. First that the end thereof be necessary, and he bound to endeauour the attayning therof. Hence it is that though marriage be the institution of God appointed to propagate mankind; yet euery man is not bound to marry, because he is not bound to propagate mankind, when there be others that do aboundantly comply with that duty to which mankind is in generall bound, Multiplicamini, &amp; replete terram [Gen. 1.18.] Secondly, where the end of the institution is

such as euery man must endeauour the atteyning thereof, to the end that a man be bound to vse that institution, it is further required, that the thing instituted be necessary for atteyning of that end. For if there be other meanes ordeined sufficient for the atteyning of that end, a man is not bound to vse such particular diuine institutions. For example, man is bound to mainteyne his corporall life so long as Nature will permit, and to this end God created variety of fruites, yet no man is bound by diuine institution to eate fruits, there being other meanes instituted for the maintenāce of life The Minister not being able to refell, what the Iesuit heere sayth, That because Christ did Institute the Sacramēt in both kinds for the refectiō of souls, it doth not follow that mē are bound by force of this Institution, to receaue in both kinds, as men are not bound to eate both fruite and flesh, though God did institute both, for the maintenance of mans life: Not being, I say, able so refell this, he laboureth to proue, that Cōmuniō in one kind is agaynst the substance of the Sacramēt: which is impertinent in this place, that controuersy being handled in the next Paragraffe; and what the Minister here saith is there answered, as in the proper place..
                        Applying this to our purpose, It is apparent, that by the force of diuine institution no man is bound to vse Communion vnder both kindes. For though the end why Christ did institute the Sacrament in both kinds be necessary, and all must endeauour the atteyning thereunto, to wit, mayntenance, and increase of grace the life of the soule, yet there be other meanes by which we may atteyne to this end. Whence it is, that learned Deuines hold that the Sacrament of the Eucharist, is not necessarium, necessitate medij (as they speake) that is, the vse thereof is not a necessary meanes for the maintenance of spirituall life, but a mā wanting meanes of sacred Communion may by other meanes preserue himselfe in the state of grace. And though we should

suppose that actuall communion were a necessary meanes to preserue spiritual life, yet communion vnder one kind is aboundantly sufficient thereunto. For the Sacrament in the sole forme of bread, conteyning the Authour and fountayne of life, whole &amp; entyre according to body, soule, bloud, and his infinite person, is aboundantly sufficient for the refection of the soule, yea no lesse sufficient then Communion vnder both kindes. For this one kind conteyneth within it nothing lesse then what is conteyned in both, &amp; Christ promiseth life to sole manducation 
                              Ioan. 6. v. 58.: Qui manducat me, &amp; ipse viuit propter me; And vnto the sole reception of his body vnder the forme of bread 
                              Ibid. v. 55. &amp; 59.: Panis quem ego dabo caro mea est pro mundi vita, &amp; qui manducat hunc panem viuet in aeternum. If the tree of life in the midst of Paradise 
                              Gen. 2.9., if the Manna 
                              Exod. 16.15. of the Iewes, the bread of Angels did suffice to nourish the body without drinke, why should any deny this soule-nourishing sufficiency vnto the sole body of Christ, were the same alone in the bread, but specially, being there conioined with his soule &amp; his most precious bloud?
                        Hence it is apparent, that without any iust cause some Protestants inueigh against the Councell of Constance, as professing to cōtradict the precept of Christ, because it decreed Sess. 13. That the Sacrament may be lawfully giuen vnder one kind, The Minister here spendeth two pages in rayling agaynst the Councel of Constance, but hath not one word of reason in his discourse. He supposeth without proofe, what the Iesuit hath by many reasons refelled, that Christ commanded Communion in both kindes, and that the Iesuits distinction of Institution from Precept is vlcerous, &amp; a playster of figge leaues and the like words. He sayth also that Christs Institution is a virtuall precept: which is true, in respect of thinges pertayning to the substance of the Sacramēt; but both kindes be not of the substance of the Sacrament, as the Iesuit in the next Paragraffe, doth demonstrate.

This their bitternes proceeds from zeale without knowledge, not distinguishing the Institution of God, from his Precept, which are very distinct. For the precept of both kinds (if Christ gaue any) doth bind, whether both kinds be necessary for the maintenance of mans soule in grace or no: but the Institution of both kindes for the maintenance of spirituall life, doth not bind further then the thing instituted, to wit, Cōmunion vnder both kindes is necessary for the mainteyning of spirituall life; for which end one kind being sufficient, as I haue shewed, Christs institution of both kindes doth not inforce the vse of both. If God should haue commanded, the vse both of meate and drinke to euery man, then euery man should be bound not only to eate, but also to drinke, thogh he had no necessity therof: but now, seeing God hath not giuen such a precept, a man that can liue by meate without euer drinking, is not bound to drinke, non obstant

                        Communion vnder one kind, not agaynst the substance of the Sacrament. §. 3.
                        
                        A Sacrament of the new Testament being a visible efficacious signe of inuisible grace, foure thinges are necessary to concurre to the substantiall constitution thereof, which I wil set downe in order, &amp; togeather shew that they are all found in the Sacrament of the Eucharist, giuen vnder one kinde The Minister pag. 4

                              6. saith, this quadripart argumēt is Sophisticall as if the 
                                    •
                                 esuit should argue thus: Head, breast▪ back, leggs and armes are not of the substance of human nature. Ergo, a man without legs and armes is a perfect man, according to the first creation of mā-kind. I need add no more, but smile. Answere. You smile when you should rather blush for shame, in not hauing so much iudgment as to conceyue your aduersaryes cōuincing argument. For he doth not dispute as you faygne, but in this sort. As he that hath soule and body, with members &amp; organs for all the ends and functions of man, is a perfect and entiere man; so the Sacrament in one kind, if it haue matter and forme sufficient for all the ends &amp; functions of the Sacrament, is a full &amp; entyre Sacrament. But such is the Sacrament in one kind, as he doth largely proue, descending vnto the particular ends. Is this a discourse to be smiled at, or answered by laughing?.
                        First, there is required some Element that is, a visible &amp; sensible thing or action without which no Sacrament can subsist, tearmed by Deuines Materia Sacramenti. This substantiall part is not wanting in the Sacrament giuen in one kind, in which there is consecrated bread visible and sensible in the accidents thereof, and manducation, an action also visible and apparent to sense.
                        The second thing required to the substāce of the Sacramēt, is Verbum, the word, that is, a forme of speach shewing the diuine and supernatuall purpose vnto which the element is consecrated. Neyther is that part wanting in the Sacrament giuen vnder one kind, which is consecrated by the wordes of Christ, This is my body, and the Theologicall principle taken out of Saint Augustin verifyed, accedit verbum ad elemē
                              tum, &amp; fit Sacramentum.
                        
                        The third thing is Signification, euery

Sacrament signifying some diuine effect of grace, which God worketh by the application therof, and the sensible signe euen by nature hath, as Saint Augustine [Epist. 23.] noteth, some proportion, &amp; analogy to signify that diuine effect which to produce, it is assumed by Gods omnipotency as an instrument. This sacred signification which the holy Eucharist hath, is of three kinds, and all three are found in the Sacrament giuen vnder one kind. First this Sacramēt is a signe of spirituall food for the nourishment, and refection of the Soule, which signification is manifestly found in Communiō vnder one 
                              The Minister very often (though out of place as pag. 470. li. 20. &amp; pa. 442.) obiects. If Communion in both kindes, be not of the substance of the Sacrament, why should Cōmunion in bread, or wine be of the substance of the Sacrament? Why may not Communion in Cheese be truly a Sacrament, as well as Communion in one kind? Answere. First diuers Protestāts namely Beza and Caluin (see Beza epist. 2. &amp; epist. 25.) teach, that though Christ did institute the Sacrament in bread and wine, yet in case that bread and wine be wanting, one may vse some other proportionable Element, as Cheese and Beere. Might you not imploy your talent in rayling vpon these men, better then on the Councell of Constance?
                              Secondly, The Protestants allowing of Cheese in lieu of Bread, and beere in lieu of wine, is to change the substance of the Element, wherin Christ did institute the Sacrament, and consequently to change the substance of the Institution and Sacrament, bringing in an Institution and Sacrament of another substance. But to receaue the Sacrament in the kind of bread without wine, is not to change the substance of the Element, but only (whereas the Sacrament for more complete signification was instituted in two elemtēs, as for the same reason it was instituted after supper) to vse the one element without the other, the whole nature of the Sacrament sufficient for all the functions thereof, being found in one kind, as the Iesuit doth heere demonstrate.
                            kind. For the Eucharist doth signify this effect of spirituall nutrition, because it is a signe of Christ, the bread of life, the food of Angells, the fountayne

of grace; but by the sole forme of bread Christ is signifyed, as present according to his most Sacred body, and consequently as most sufficient to feed and refresh the soule.
                        Another signification of this Sacrament, is vnion and coniunction betweene the faythful, as being members of the same body wherof Christ is head, &amp; fellow-mē
                           bers one with another, as S. Paul declares [Rom. 12.4.] which coniunction the Sacramēt in the forme of bread doth signify. For bread being a compound of many graynes of wheate massed togeather in one loafe, &amp; also made of floure and water mingled one with another, signifyes the perfect vnion both of the Church with Christ, &amp; of the faythfull that are in the Church one with another, as Saint Paul 1. Cor. 10. testifyes, vnum corpus sumus quotquot de vno pane participamus, where he makes no mention of Wine, the Sacrament in the forme of bread being alone able to shew &amp; worke this signification.
                        This Sacrament doth also signify the passion and death of our Sauiour, which death and passion is shewed and represented by Communion vnder one kind The Minister sayth pag. 479. That both kinds do more liuely represent Christs Passion, then one only. Answere. What is this to the purpose, to proue the Sacrament in one kind substantially imperfect? Baptisme by plunging the Childe into water, represents Christs death and resurrection, more liuely thē Baptisme by sprinkling; yet is Baptisme by aspersion a full and entyre Sacrament.. For receauing the Sacrament in the forme of wine only, we haue a sufficient ground to remember the bloud of Christ that was in his passion shed, and separated from his body. Likewise by participating of the cō
                           secrated

bread we may liuely conceaue the body of Christ, as it was depriued of the most precious bloud by the effusion therof on the Crosse; wherupon Christ (as Saint Paul 1. Cor. 11. v. 14.15. testifyes, did after the consecration of ech kind, particularly recommend the memory of his passion, as knowing that in ech of them alone was a sufficient monument and memoriall thereof.
                        The fourth thing required to the substāce of a Sacrament, is Causality, to wit, to worke in the soule the spirituall effects it signifyes. This Causality cannot be wanting to the Sacrament vnder one kind, wherein is conteyned the fountayne of spirituall life. For the cause why the Sacrament in both kindes giueth grace and refresheth the soule, is, that Christ is assistant vnto them, bound by his promise at the presence of sensible signes, to worke proportionably spirituall effects in disposed soules. But Christ is in the Sacramēt vnder the forme of bread, &amp; he is able through infinite power, and bound by inuiolable promise, to worke the effect of grace, preseruing vnto life eternall the worthy participant of this Sacrament Hence is refuted what the Minister saith pag. 478. without any proofe: That the promise of grace is not made to one kind only. vnder the forme of bread, Qui manducat hunc panem, viuit in aeternum. Ioan. 6.55. Not any doubt then may be made, but the Sacrament in one kind is full, entyre, complete in substance, &amp; by participation thereof prepared consciences do receaue the benefit of

celestiall fauour that conserueth the life of the soule, with dayly increase in perfection The Minister very often obiecteth as pag. 479. &amp; 502. and elsewhere: That according to the Tenet of some Scholemen, greater benefit of grace it reaped by communion in both kinds. Answere. First Catholicke Deuines of greater number &amp; learning hold the contrary. Secondly, This is impertinent: for the questiō is not whether Communion in both kinds be of greater perfection, but whether it be necessary vnto Saluation. Thirdly, if Cō
                              munion in both kindes giue more grace, yet this excesse may be easily equalled by other diligences, as by often receauing in one kind, and by obedience to the Church &amp;c. The Minister 472. proueth Communion in both kinds to be of greater profit, because it is an act of obedience vnto Christs precept, Drinke yee all of this, but obedience is better then Sacrifice, 1. Sam. 15.22. His argument supposeth, without proofe, what the Iesuit hath shewed to be most false, and so may be with more truth turned to the contrary: for to receaue in one kind is an act of obedience vnto the Church, whereof Christ sayth, He that heareth not the Church, let him be to thee as an heathen and a publican. But obedience is better then Sacrifice: Therefore more spirituall profit, and merit is gotten by Communion in one kind..
                     
                     
                        Communion vnder one kind, not agaynst Christ his Precept. §. 4.
                        
                        ALTHOVGH Communion vnder both kindes pertayne not to the substance of the Sacrament, yet if Christ did specially commaund the same, we are boūd to that obseruance, and should by communion vnder one kind sinne, not agaynst his Sacrament and Institution, but agaynst a speciall diuine precept.
                        Hence we may probably inferre, that Christ gaue no speciall precept thereof, because Christ hath commaunded no more concerning the vse of the Eucharist, then what by the substance of the institution &amp; nature of the Sacrament we are bound vnto, leauing accidentall circūstances belonging thereunto to be ordeyned by the Apostles and Pastours of the Church, as S.

Augustin noteth saying 
                              Augustin. ep. 118.:
Our Lord did not appoint in what order the Sacrament of the Eucharist was to be taken afterward, but left authority to make such appointments vnto his Apostles, by whome he was to dispose and order his Churches.
So cleerly doth S. Augustine speake, that Christ gaue no commaundements to his Church, concerning the vse of the Sacrament, besides such as are conteyned in the substance of the Institution, and of the Sacrament; of which kind Communion vnder both kindes cannot be, as hath been proued, which will further appeare by pō
                           dering the places alleadged to prooue a Precept.
                        The words of Christ, Do this in remembrance of me, do no wayes inferre a Precept of both kinds. First, because he sayd, Do this in remembrance of me, absolutly only of the Sacrament in the forme of bread, of the forme of wine not absolutely, but conditionally, Do this as often as you drinke in memory of me, that the Aduersaryes of the Church might not haue any the least plausible shew to complayne of her neglecting Gods Precept The Minister in this place is very bitter, tearming the Iesuit Vermine, infatuated Romanist, and the like. But in lieu of answering his argument, he confirmes the same, as is shewed in the Censure, Sect. 4. §. 5.. For this precept Do this, being the only precept giuē by Christ to his Church, as shal afterwards appeare, and giuē absolutely of the forme of bread, conditionally of the forme of wine, there is no colour to accuse the Church of doing agaynst Christs precept by Communion

vnder one kind. Secondly, suppose Christ spake these Imperatiue wordes Do this, after the giuing of the Cup, yet are they to be vnderstood with this restriction, Do this, that is, all things that belong to the essence and substance of this action in memory of me. For if we extend the precept Do this, further then the substance of the action, vnto the accidentary circumstances therof, in which Christ did then institute and giue the Sacrament, many absurdityes will follow. For, by this rule we must alwayes celebrate and receaue the Eucharist after supper as Christ did, specially seeing this circumstance of after supper, was chosen of Christ, as being very proper &amp; mysterious. For thereby is signifyed, that this is the sacrifice which succeeds the Paschall Lambe, that was offered in the Euening, the sacrifice whereof the royall Prophet sayth 
                              Psal. 140. v. 2.
                            in the person of Christ, Eleuatio manuum mearum sacrificium vespertinum: The sacrifice, which instituted in the euening of the world, was to continue vntill the end thereof. We should also by this rule be bound, still to celebrate in Azime, that is, vnleuened bread, in which Christ did celebrate, and giue the Sacrament, saying, Do this; which circumstance was also mystical and signifyes the purity of our Sauiours virginall body &amp; person, which was without any Leauen of sinne. And besides, the Priest might not giue the Sacrament vnto

any but such whose feet he had washed afore, seing Christ gaue the Eucharist with this preparatiue circūstance, which doubtlesse is very pertinent and mysterious to signify, with what purity of conscience mē ought to approach vnto the sacred Table. If to bind men to obserue these circumstances of our Sauiours action, though mysterious and Sacramentall, were absurd (as without doubt it is most absurd) then we must not extend the precept Do this, to the circumstances of Christs action, but acknowledge that the precept Do this, only includes the doing of that which pertaines to the substance of the Sacrament, and so not to the giuing of both kindes, the substance thereof being entyre in one only kind, as hath been proued. The Ministers ignorance and simplicity in answering these argumēts is discouered in the Censure, Sect. 1. §. 2.
                           
                        
                        The second text much vrged for the giuing of the Cup vnto all men, is the wordes of our Sauiour, Bibite ex hoc omnes, wherein some note our Sauiours prouidence saying, that he foreseeing that some would take the Cup from the Laity, graunting them the consecrated bread, sayd of the Cup Bibite ex hoc omnes, but not of bread Manducate ex hoc omnes. I answere; the wordes of our Sauiour be plaine, Drink ye all of this. But the difficulty is to whō they are spokē, &amp; who are those all? Luther would haue all men for whom the bloud of Christ is shed, whence it followes, that as the bloud of Christ was shed for all men, euen Infidells,

Iewes, Turkes, Infants, the Cup also should be giuen vnto all these, which to say were very absurd. Others restrayne the wordes All, to the faythfull come to the yeares of discretion, who must drinke of the Cup all of them. But what shall we say of them that are by nature Abstemij, who cannot endure the tast of any wine, yet are not to be excused from the Sacrament?
                        Wherfore the truth is, that these words were spoken vnto all the Apostles, and to them all only. And though it be inough for Catholiks to say it, and put their aduersaryes to prooue their pretended Precept, which they call of the eternall King, for the Cup; and so long as they cannot cleerly conuince the contrary, good reason the word of the Church defined by Councells should stand: yet ex abundanti, we can very probably shew out of the sacred Text, that the particle all concernes all the Apostles only. First, what one Euangelist [Mat. 26.27.] sayth, was commanded vnto al, Bibite ex hoc omnes, drinke yee all of this, another relates to haue been answerably performed by them all [Matth. 14.23.] Biberunt ex eo omnes, all dranke thereof; but the second all, is restrayned to all the Apostles and to them all only. What reason then is there to extend the words, Drinke yee all of this, further then to all the Apostles? Secondly, these words, Accipite, 
                           The Minister p. 490. saith, If Bibite do not import a precept, that the people receaue the Sacrament in the forme of wine, thē 
                              Māducate doth not inforce a precept, that they receaue vnder the forme of bread, and so they shall be boūd to receaue neyther in one kind nor in both. Answere. The word Manducate, was spoken personally to the Apostles only, as much as Bibite, and so by vertue of this word we cannot bind the people to receaue vnder the forme of bread. Notwithstanding by other texts of Scripture we prooue thē to be bound to receaue by eating the Sacred bread. For the precept doe this in remēbrance of mee, was spoken only after the consecration of the bread, as appeares by the Gospell, But your selfe say pag. 490. lin. 7. That these wordes were spoken to the People respectiuely, and in part, to wit, that they receaue, though not consecrate, &amp; administer the Sacrament in the forme of bread. Therefore though the word Manducate, do not, yet other wordes of the Institutiō do inforce a precept to receaue in the forme of bread. 
                           manducate, bibite; Take, eate, drinke, were certainly

spoken vnto the same persons; and they runne so togeather in ranke, that no man can with probability make the one outrunne the other. But the Commaund Accipite, which signifyes take with your hands (for it is a precept distinct from mā
                              dacate, which is, take with your mouth) was giuen to the Apostles only, not vnto al the faythfull; else we must say, that all Communicants are bound to take the consecrated bread &amp; Cup with their hands. Who euer heard of such a precept in the Christian Church?
                        The third reason is, because there was a peculiar, and personall cause, why Christ should giue that peculiar counsell or admonition (for the Imperatiue word doth not euer signify a precept, but often an aduise, or a permission, as your Maiesty well knowes) to his Apostles at that tyme When the finall cause &amp; end of the precept is personall, then the sense of precept is personall. The end of Christs saying, Drinke yee all of this, was personall, to wit, that all the Apostles should drinke of the same indiuiduall Cupp, without new consecration &amp; filling. Ergo, the sense of the precept is personall, &amp; only concernes those twelue persons., to wit, because he would haue them all not only drinke of his bloud, but also would haue them drinke of the same Cup, without filling &amp; consecrating the same anew. This is more manifest in the Protestants opinion, who thinke the Chalice whereof Christ sayd in S. Matthew, Bibite ex hoc omnes, to be the same wherof he sayd by 
                              Luc. 22.18. 
                           Saint Marke, Accipite, diuidite inter vos, non enim bibam ampliùs de hoc genimine vitis. For this being supposed, Drinke yee all of this imports the same, as, Deuide this Cup amongst you: But, deuide this Cup amongst you, was a

personall precept giuen to all the Apostles, importing that euery one should drinke but a part of that Cup, &amp; that also in such a measure, as the Cup without new filling and consecration, might suffice for all to drinke thereof What the Minister sayth, That the precept is, that all men drinke not of the same indiuiduall, but of the same specificall Cup, is idle. For Christs words, deuide this Cup amōgst you import drinke yee all of this indiuiduall Cuppe. If one should bestow a quart of wine vpon 4. persōs, saying; Deuide this amongst you, were it not ridiculous to interprete his speach, that he meanes not, Drinke yee all of this indiuidual quart, but, of a quart of the same kind? If two of the cō
                              pany should drinke vp that whole indiuiduall quart, &amp; being challēdged by the other to haue done agaynst the order of the giuer, who would not laugh, should they answere (as our Minister teacheth them) that Deuide this Cupp amongst you, imports not, drinke all of this indiuiduall Cupp, but of a Cupp of the same kind? So that howsoeuer the Minister in this place doe rayle bitterly, and bragg mightely, yet his Reply is ridiculous, and agaynst common sense.. What, all men in the world? Or all Christians that should succeed them to the worlds end? Christ neuer intended that one Cup for all, nor is it indeed deuided, or parted with vs, but the Apostles dranke it vp amongst them. Wherfore referring my sayings to your Maiesties learned censure, I conclude that to me it seemes cleere, that the precept, or rather direction, Drinke yee all of this, was but personal, confined vnto the nūber of all there then present. 
                              The Minister pag. 489. bringes foure arguments to proue that the wordes of Christ, Drinke yee all of this, command all the faythfull to drinke: which arguments though very poore ones, shall be answered. The first is, What Christ sayd to the Apostles, Paul sayd to the whole multitude of the faythfull, 1. Cor. 11.28. Answere. S. Paul neuer sayd the wordes, drinke yee all of this to all the faythfull, yea the same are not found in all the Epistles of S. Paul: for 1. Cor. 11.28. he only sayth, let a man proue himselfe, and so eate of that bread, and drinke of that Cupp, which wordes (as euery man in his senses must needes perceaue) do not import a precept to receaue in both kinds,  but only that no man receaue in both kinds, or in one kind, without first trying himselfe, whether he be worthy. What you cite out of S. Hieroms commentary, Coenam Domini oportet esse communem, only signifyes that the Sacrament is for all men, aswell for the poore as for the rich, agaynst which some Corinthians erred, scorning to receaue in the Company of the poore.
                              The second. If Communion in both kinds hath no foundation in Gods word, then Communion in one kind hath no foundation in Gods word. Answere. The lawfullnes of Communion in both kinds, &amp; the lawfullnes of Communion in one kind, haue foundation in Gods word, and so to vse the one or the other is not agaynst the Diuine law. But a Diuine precept to receaue in one kind, or in both kinds hath no foundatiō in Gods word, as being but a fond Ministeriall fancy. The word of God doth command to receaue, at least vnder the forme of bread, but to receaue in the same only without the Cupp, is no Diuine precept.
                              The third Argument. If the reason why the Apostles receaued the Cupp was, because they were Priests, then all Priests being present at Communion ought to receaue in both kinds though they administer not. Answere. If the reason why the Apostles receaued the Cup, was not because they were Priests, but as the Iesuit proueth by the Gospell, because Christ would haue it so, saying vnto them, Drinke yee all of this indiuiduall Cupp, then is the Ministers argumēt idle and impertinent. Such also is his fourth argumēt wherein he would proue, that the Apostles were not made Priests by the wordes Doe this: For suppose they were not made Priests by that speach, how will he thence conclude that the words Drinke yee all of this, were not spoken personally vnto the twelue, cōmanding them to drinke all of the same indiuidual Cupp? Besides in the two arguments to proue the Apostles were not made Priests by the word Do this, he shews intolerable ignorance.
                              The first is, what force is there in these wordes, Do this, to conclude Priestly ordination? Answere. Are you a Doctour, and do not know that the word of the Almighty hath force to giue men power, commission, authority to do what he doth command them to doe? Christ by the word Do this, commanded the Apostles, to do what he had done, that is, to consecrate bread and wine into his body and blood, to receaue and consume the same, to giue them to the faythfull. Ergo, by saying Do this, he gaue them power commission, authority, not only to receaue themselues, but also to consecrate, and giue vnto others his holy body and blood, which is the power and office of Priesthood.
                              
                                  Secondly, If (say you) Do this, proueth Priesthood, then lay men are Priests when the wordes Doe this, be spoken to them in part, or respectiuely. Answere. Doe not you feele, how you bewray the weakenes and vanity of your argument in your very proposition thereof? You say the wordes Do this, be spoken vnto lay men but in part, that is, they command them to receaue, but not to consecrate and giue the Sacrament vnto others. But the power, or commission only to receaue the Sacrament is not Priesthood, but the commission to consecrate &amp; administer the same vnto others. Therefore the wordes Doe this, do not make them Priests, to whome in part &amp; respectiuely, but to whom they are spoken absolutely, &amp; in the full sense.
                           
                        
                        
                            Another text of the Scripture some vrge

to proue, that Communion vnder one kinde is commāded, to wit, the famous place out of S. Iohn 
                           
                              Ioan. 6.59▪
                           : Except yee eate the flesh &amp; drinke the bloud of the Sonne of Man, you shall not haue life in you. Where our Sauiour, vnder the penalty of loosing eternall life, commaūds not only eating, but also drinking. Perchance your Maiesty doth not stand much vpon this, as not belieuing that Chapter of Saint Iohn to concerne the Sacramentall sumption of our Sauiours flesh, as also some learned Catholiks hold: Notwithstanding though we grant that Chapter to concerne the eating and drinking in the Sacrament, as most of the Fathers teach, yet this obiection may be easily satisfyed by the former Principles. For, as we distinguish in the Sacrament, the substance &amp; the manner, the substance being to receaue the body of Christ, the manner, in both kindes by formall eating and drinking: So the same distinction is to be made in our Sauiours precept about this Sacrament. For howsoeuer

his words may sound of the manner of receauing in both kinds, yet his intention is to commaund no more then the substance, to wit, that we really receaue his body and bloud, which may be done vnder one kind. This may be made cleere by the Precept our Sauior hath giuē about another Sacrament, to wit Baptisme, where though his words seeme to define the manner, yet his mind was but to determine the substance. He sayth 
                              Matt. 28.18. to his Apostles. Baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost. To Baptize signifyes the same, that the Greeke word 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                           , which is, not to wet, or sprinckle with water, but to put and plunge into water by immersiō, bathing them in water, in which respect Baptisme is tearmed by the Apostle 
                              Tit. 3.4. the Lauer, or bath of the renouation of the holy Ghost. And yet because the Church teacheth Baptisme by aspersion or sprinckling to be sufficient, &amp; substantiall Baptisme, no lesse then Baptisme by immersion, christiās must, &amp; do interpret the words of Christ, Baptize, that is, plūge into the water all Nations, to command only cleansing &amp; washing in substance, not the manner thereof by immersion as his words may seeme to import, and the Primitiue Church did the first 600. yeares practise.
                        In like sort the wordes, Vnlesse you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his

bloud, you shall not haue life in you, be preceptiue no further then they signify reall receauing of his body and bloud, not the manner of both kindes, as may appeare by the intention of the commandement. For, as Christ gaue this precept of eating and drinking, only to the end that we might haue life in vs; so likewise he meant to cō
                           maund the same no further, then it was necessary to this end. But eating formally the body of Christ vnder the forme of bread, and What the Minister saith, that the receauing the blood of Christ Virtually, as being by Concomitācy ioyned with the body, is spirituall receauing, and not Sacramentall, is false. For only iust and holy men receaue the body of Christ spiritually. But wicked mē receaue the blood of Christ together with his body by Concomitancy. Therefore this virtuall receauing of Christs blood, is corporall and Sacramentall, and not only spirituall. 
                           virtually and implicitely his bloud as conteined within his sacred body, sufficeth that we may haue life in vs, as he promiseth in the same place v. 59. He that eateth this bread shall liue for euer; what necessity then is there to vnderstand this precept of formall receauing in both kinds?
                        But further I add, the coniunctiue particle Et (and) frequently signifyes disiunctiuely the same that vel (or,) as, Argentum &amp; aurum non est mihi 
                           
                              Act. 3.6., and particularly of this Sacrament 1. Cor. 11.20., He that eateth and drinketh vnworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation, the sense is disiunctiue, Eateth or drinketh vnworthily? In this sort: Except you eate and drinke, is to be vnderstood disiunctiuely, Except you eate the flesh, or, drinke the bloud of the Sonne of man, you shall not haue life in you. Which disiunctiue sense to be the sense intended in this place, may be proued, because else Christ should be contrary to himselfe. For, seeing in the verse 59.

of this Chapter he promiseth life eternall to eating only, Qui māducat hunc panē, viuit in aeternum. If in the 94. verse of the same Chapter, he require vnto life euerlasting eating and drinking both, he should in the space of a few lines speake contraryes. And because this is impossible,
                              THIs last answer is truest, &amp; may be inuincibly proued by Scripture. First, it cānot be denyed that in Scripture the particle Et, and is takē disiunctiuely as the Iesuit proueth in the text, &amp; the Minister granteth. Secondly, whensoeuer two thinges are required to one &amp; the same end, for which ech a part is sufficient, then the particle Et, and, must needs be vnderstood disiunctiuely to signifye the same as Or. Because to strike Father apart, and to strike mother apart is worthy of death in a sonne, therefore the Scripture Exod. 21. saying, He that striketh his Father &amp; mother let him dye the death, is to be vnderstood disiunctiuely, his Father or mother. This might be proued by other innumerable instances, nor can so much as one example be brought where this rule fayleth.
                              This supposed, I assume: But the Scripture teacheth that the eating of Christs body a part by it selfe is sufficient vnto eternall life, Iohn 6.52. The bread which I will giue is my flesh, for the life of the world. And 58. he that eateth me shall liue by me: and 59. he that eateth this bread shall liue for euer. Ergo, the precept, Except you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud you shall not haue life in you, is vnderstood disiunctiuely, Except you eate his flesh, or drinke his bloud.
                              Hence the Fathers when they say, the Gospell commands drinking of bloud, they meane disiunctiuely, because they ground the precept vpō this text. The Authour of the booke De Coena Domini sayth, the law forbad the eating of bloud, but the Gospell commands drinking thereof, to wit disiunctiuely: &amp; S. Austine. q. 57. In Leuit. In the law men are forbidden so tast of the bloud of the Sacrifices, but in the new law from taking the bloud of our Sacrifice by way of nourishment, no man is forbidden, yea rather all are inuited thereunto that will haue life, to wit disiunctiuely, that is, they are inuited, if they will haue life, to eate the flesh, or drinke the bloud of our Sauiour. Other places brought  out of the Fathers by you, are partly from the purpose, partly falsifyed. From the purpose are the places which affirme no more, then that the body and bloud of Christ be giuen in the Sacrament vnto all. Chrysostom. hom. 18. in 
                                       •
                                    . ad Cor. the Cup as distributed vnto all. Ignatius epist. ad Philadelphenses &amp;c. Falsifyed is the Testimony of S. Iustine, pag. 497. but specially pag. 482. for thus you cite it. Iustinus Martyr sayth, That Christians in his age distributed the sanctifyed bread &amp; wine to euery one present: and he addeth further; The Apostles taught that Iesus did command them to do thus. You haue corrupted his testimony two or three wayes. First by omission, for S. Iustin doth mention not only wine, but also water. The Deacons (sayth he) distribute vnto euery one present consecrated bread, wine, and water, 
                                 
                                    〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                                 : Wherfore if by this testimony you can proue it is a Diuine precept to giue wine, you proue also that it is a Diuine precept to giue water, &amp; cōsequently your selues to be trāsgressors of the Diuine precept who giue it not. That this your peruersity to vrge vs with the testimony of S. Iustin, which makes not to the purpose, or else by the same your selfe are condemned, might not appeare, you falsified the place, citing what pleased you, and leauing out what serued not your turne. Secondly, these words of S. Iustine, The Apostles taught that Iesus commanded them so to doe, are not ioyning vpon the wordes that mention the giuing of consecrated bread, wine, &amp; water, as you would haue men belieue, but follow some 16. or 17. lines after, &amp; are referred to another matter, to wit that Christ gaue a Command to belieue the reall presence. S. Iustine his true words are these: We are taught, that as Iesus Christ is made truly flesh by the word of God, in the same manner the Eucharisticall foode, by the prayer of the word proceeding from him, is the flesh and blood of Iesus incarnate: for the Apostles in their writings tearmed the Gospells, do deliuer, that Iesus gaue that preception vnto them. For taking bread into his hands, and hauing giuen thankes he sayd; Do this in remembrance of me, this is my body. In like manner taking the Cup after thansgiuing he sayd; This is my bloud. Thus S. Iustine, by which it is euident that he sayth that Iesus gaue a precept not of communion in both kinds, but of belieuing the Reall Presence. Whence your third corruption is discouered, making S. Iustine to say, that Iesus commanded to doe thus; for, to do thus is added vnto the text agaynst the drift thereof, which manifestly speaketh of a precept to belieue thus, not to do thus.
                              
                              In like manner you falsify S. Cyprian. Pag. 497. you produce these his wordes as making agaynst Communion in one kind: In consecrating and administring the Cup vnto the people, some do not that which our Lord did appoint  and commanded: As who should say, these men did transgresse the Diuine precept, in that they gaue not the Cup vnto laymen. Had S. Cyprian meāt this, he should not haue sayd they sin in administring, but the contrary, they sinne in not administring the Cup to the people. But S. Cyprian presently declares wherein they did transgresse the Diuine precept, to wit, in that some did cōsecrate pure water without wine, &amp; others meere wine without water, and gaue the same to the people. What is this agaynst Communion in one kind? This place proueth they sinne agaynst the Diuine law, who consecrate pure water in lieu of wine (as some Protestāts teach men to doe;) and also, that they transgresse the Diuine precept who offer vnto God, and giue to the people pure wine without admixtion of water (as all Protestans commonly do.) But that Priests are bound by Diuine precept to giue consecrated wine to the people, this place doth not so much as insinuate, nor will any learned man cite it for the necessity of the Cup, except he haue drunke too much of the Cup.
                            we interprete the place disiunctiuely, 
                              The place of S. Iohn explicated, with an Answere to the Testimonyes of the Fathers.

                        Communion vnder one kinde not agaynst the practise of the Primitiue Church. §. 5.
                        
                        CERTAINE it is, that the Primitiue Church did very often and frequently vse Communion vnder one kinde, so that Laymen had by prescription a Right 
                           Ad bibendum pocculum Dei iure communicationis admittimus. Cyp. l. epist. 2. to receaue in both kindes, yea they were bound thereunto by the obligation of Custome, not by diuine precept. Also because the Manichees being impiously perswaded that Wine was the 
                              Aug. de haeres. 46. gall of the Prince of darkenes, did

                            superstitiously abstayne from the Chalice, the Church in detestation of this errour commanded, for a tyme, Communion vnder both kinds; vpon which occasion Gelasius Pope made the Decree 
                              Gelas. apud Gratian. de Consecrat. cap. Comperimus.
                            recorded by Gratiā, Aut integra Sacramenta suscipiant, aut ab integris arceantur.
                           
And why? Because such Abstinents, nescio qua superstitione docentur astringi, that is, were superstitious, not absteyning out of any deuotiō, but out of an impious perswasion of the impurity of Gods creature. Wherfore the crime with which some Protestants charge vs, that our receauing vnder the sole forme of bread, is to iumpe in opinion with the Manichees, we may (as D. Morton confesseth) reiect as iniurious, saying; That it was not the Manichees abstinence from wine, but the reason of their forbearance, that was iudged hereticall. Morton Protestant. Appeale. lib. 1. cap. 4. pag. 140. 
                              Agaynst this explication of the place of Gelasius, it is obiected, that the same doth not agree with the reason of the Canon. For Gelasius sayth, men are not to be permitted to receaue but in both kinds, because the diuision of one and the same Sacrament cannot be done without sacriledge. The whole decree is this: We find that some men hauing taken the portion of our Lords body, refrayne from the Cup of the holy bloud. Which men (because they are imbued with I know not what superstitiō,) let them without any question receaue the whole Sacraments, or nothing at all, for the diuision of one and the same mystery cannot be vsed without a great Sacriledge. I Answere: first Gelasius doth not say, no man is to be permitted to receaue in one kinde, but only no superstitious abstinent, Secondly, his reason is not ōly because the deuiding of the Sacramēt is Sacriledg, but quoniam nescio qua superstitione docentur astringi, because they are proued to be imbued with a certayne superstitious opinion, to wit,  that the creature of wine is impure. The discourse then of Gelasius is, because these men are superstitiously conceyted, that the creature of wine is the Diuells gall, therefore by them the deuiding of the holy mystery, receauing the consecrated Bread without the Cup, sine grandi sacrilegio fieri non potest, cannot be done without great Sacriledge. Whēce he concludes, proculdubio arceantur, let such men be kept from Communion in one kind without any question, mercy, or indulgēce: As if he had sayd, Vnto men Orthodoxally conceited about the creature of wine, Cōmunion in one kind may be granted sometimes vpon iust causes, as if they be by nature abstemij, that cannot endure wine: But men that be superstitiously persuaded agaynst the nature of wine, proculdubio arceantur, let Communion in one kind be denyed vnto them without question, and granted in no case, because in respect of them Communion in one kind is euer Sacrilegious.
                              The Minister also in this place keepeth a styrre, and would make the world belieue, that the Iesuit Vasquez doth maynly oppose himselfe agaynst the Iesuit Answerer, about this place of Gelasius. The Iesuit (sayth he) is confuted by a learned and intelligent man of his owne Society, to wit Vasquez, who sayth, that some of his party apply the place of Gelasius agaynst Manichees, but this exposition agreeth not with the last clause of the Canon. Answere. You shew great desire to discredit your aduersary, yet cannot you doe it, so much as in this trifle, with truth. For in citing the censure of Vasquez you leaue out the principal word, which being set down would haue marred your market. Vasquez not only sayth, that some of his side explicate the place of Gelasius of lay Manichees, but also addeth his Iudgment about the same saying, probabiliter explicant, this their explication is probable. Do not you see your falshood in citing and vanity in vrging this censure of Vasquez? If this explication be probable euen by the Iudgment of Vasquez, how is the Iesuit confuted by Vasquez of his owne Society, as not answering your argument sufficiently? Is it not sufficient, that Catholicks bringe probable solutions vnto your arguments agaynst Christian customes defined in Councells and receaued in the Church before you, or your Luther were borne? You your selfe say pag. 11. That no man is to reiect the Doctrine and custome of the Church, or the exposition of Scripture, commonly and anciently receaued vpon vncertayne and probable reasons. If the Iesuit hath answered your arguments probably, as euen by this censure of Vasquez he hath, then be your arguments at the most but probable, and consequently your reuolt from the Church of Rome grounded thereon dānable. Who now is condemned by Vasquez his Censure?
                              
                                  But Vasquez sayth, that the Iesuits explication, though it agree fitly to the rest of the decree of Gelasius, yet cannot be fitted to the last branch thereof, where Gelasius sayth, that the diuision of the one and same mystery is Sacrilegious in it selfe, and in nature: Quare mihi magis placet altera explicatio: Wherefore, sayth Vasquez, vnto me another explication seemeth more probable. I Answere. First Gelasius doth not say, that the diuision of the mystery is in itselfe &amp; in nature a Sacriledge, nor can it be very probably sayd that he did so meane. For what sense is there in this discourse, To deuide the Sacrament by receauing in one kind is a Sacriledge of his owne nature, and absolutely in it selfe, therefore let not these men be permitted in any case to receaue in one kinde, quoniam nescio qua superstitione docentur astringi, because they are conuinced to hold superstitious Doctrine about the impurity of the creature of wine? Besides, had Gelasius meant that Communion in one kind is a sacriledge absolutely in it selfe, he would haue decreed that not only superstitious mē, but absolutely all men should be kept frō the same proculdubio, without any question. Wherfore Gelasius his decree cannot be better sensed then thus. Because these men are conceyted superstitiously agaynst the creature of wine, their receauing in one kind without the Cup, can not but be impious; Therefore proculdubio arceantur, let not Communion in one kind be giuen vnto them in any case, though vnto Orthodoxe people vpon iust reasons the same may be granted. Secondly, suppose all that Vasquez would cōclude, to wit, that another exposition is more probable, what haue you gayned? Surely nothing; for this other exposition better liked by Vasquez is, that Gelasius spake not of laymens receauing, but of Priests that celebrate and consecrate, affirming, that it is sacrilegious in it selfe for Priests to cōsecrate without receauing in both kinds. If the Iesuit Vasquez in this exposition and doctrine seeme to you learned &amp; intelligent, be it so in Gods name, you are satisfyed, and your Aduersary contented; for he did neuer meane to say, that this explication is improbable, specially the same being giuen by Gratian, who read that Epistle of Gelasius, which now it not extant.
                           
                        
                        
                            This custome was the cause that Cyprian 
                           
                              Cyprian de Coena Domini.
                            sayth, that the Law forbad the eating of bloud, but the Ghospell commands the same should be drunke, not only because some Christians, to wit Priests, are bound to drinke the bloud of Christ, but also because Christ in his Ghospell did institute the Sacrament of his body &amp; bloud in both kinds; whence grew the Custome of the primitiue Church to receaue in both kindes, &amp; by custome there grew further an obligation to drinke of the cup, except there were some iust cause of abstinence, as in the sicke, and in them that by nature loathed wine.
                        
                           And as this is certayne, and graunted on our part, so it is no lesse certayne that the Primitiue Church did neuer practise the vse of the Cup, as pertayning to the essential integrity of the Sacrament, or as commaunded

by diuine precept, but thought the receauing vnder one and both kindes a thing indifferent. This may be proued by the consideration of the tyme since Christ, ascending frō our dayes vpward; whence I gather fiue Arguments.
                        First, is the Confession of our Aduersaryes, amongst whome a Bohemian Protestant 
                              Ioan. Przibrau. confess. Fid. Cath. c. 19. doth professe that, hauing the feare of God before his eyes, he dares not censure the Roman Church of Heresy in this point 
                              Hospin. Histor. Sacram. p. 2. fol. 112.
                           . Hospinian writes, that some Protestants confessed, that whole Christ was really present, exhibited and receaued vnder euery kind, and therefore vnder the only forme of bread, and that they did not iudge those to doe euill, that Communicated vnder one kind. 
                              Melanct. in 2. edit. Comm. impress. Argent. an. 1525. fol. 78. Melancthon: As to eate or not to eate swines flesh is placed in our power, &amp; a thing indifferent; so (sayth he) I Iudge of the Eucharist, that they sinne not who knowing &amp; belieuing this liberty, do vse eyther part of the signes. And Luther: 
                           
                              Luther. de Captiu, Babylon. cap. de Eucharistia.
                            
                           They sinne not agaynst Christ, who vse one kind, seing Christ doth not commaund to vse both, but hath left it to the will of euery one. And Hospinian alleadgeth 
                              Hospin. Histor. Sacr. p. 2. fol. 12. Luther, affirming it is not needfull to giue both kindes, but the one alone sufficeth. The Church hath power of ordeyning only one, and the people ought to be content therewith, if it be ordeyned by the Church. The Minister p. 500. sayth: Concerning Luther, Melancthon &amp;c. I answere that your benefactour Coccius (to whome you are perpetually obliged for your readings) alledgeth some such sayings, but how truly it is vncertayne. Answer. The Iesuit read the sayings he citeth in Luther, Melancthon &amp; Hospinian, not in Coccius, vnto whome he is not so much beholding for his readings, as you are vnto Chemnitius for yours; yea he durst engage his credit, that you cannot shew some of the testimonies by him cited, in Coccius, which sheweth your want of reading, and that your desire to cauill is greater then your wit. What you add, that these sayings are not now foūd in Luther &amp; Melancthon, is as much as to confesse that, wherof the Lutherans accuse you of the Sacramētariā
                               brood, that you haue most impudently falsifyed the workes of Luther, thogh also Hospinian, a Sacramentarian as you are, hath these sayings both of Luther &amp; other Protestants, censuring them in this respect.
                        
                        But these testimonyes, though they may

serue to stop the mouth of a clamorous Aduersary, yet be they not sufficient to satisfy any iudicious mā, in regard their Authours were men most vncertayne &amp; various in their doctrines about Religiō, now auerring as Orthodoxe and diuine truth, what soone after they fell to abhorre as hereticall &amp; impious. I add secondly, the definition of three generall Councells celebrated before the breach of Luther from the Roman Church. The Councell of Florence 
                           
                              Concil. Florentin. in decreto Eugenij 4. wherein were present the Grecian and Armenian Bishops, where Concomitancy is defined, That Christ is whole vnder ech forme. The Councell of Basill 
                           
                              Concil. Basilien. Sess. 30., though they allowed the vse of the Cup vnto the Bohemians, defined the lawfulnes of Communion vnder one kind. The Councell of Constance 
                           
                              Concil. Constantiense Sess. 13. gaue example vnto both the former Councells being the first that defined this truth.
                        The third Argument is, the receaued &amp; allowed generall Custome of the Church, which spontaneously euen before the Coū
                           cel of Constance, did absteine from the Cup, as the sayd Councell doth acknowledge, which may be proued by the testimonyes of many that liued before the Councell of Constance: yea Alexander Halensis 
                           
                              Halensis 4. p. q. 11. in 2. a. 4. sect. 3. who liued two hundred yeares before the Coū
                           cell of Constance, saith, That almost euery where, Laymen receaued vnder the sole forme of bread. And Venerable Bede 
                           
                              Beda. Histor. Gent. Angl. l. 2. c. 5. &amp; l. 4. c. 14. doth signify

that in the Church The Minister pag. 502. You are guided by that spirit which is mentioned 3. Kings 22. v. 21. when you affirme, that Venerable Bede sayth, in the Church of England euer since her conuersion vnder S. Gregory Communiō in one kind was in vse; for no such report is found in him. Answere. Take heed, you be not guided by the spirit mentioned. Reuelat. 12.11. who so perpetually calumniate your aduersary. For he did not affirme that Venerable Bede did so say, as though he had made mention thereof in expresse tearmes, but that he doth so signify, or insinuate, which is true: for l. 2. c. 5. Histor. Anglor. he writes how the sonnes of a certayne Christian King that was deceased being yet Pagans, sayd vnto a Bishop: Why do'st thou not giue vs that white bread, which thou wert wont to giue to our Father, and do'st still giue to the people in the Church? Which speach they did often at sundry times repeate without any mention of the Cup. What you bring as contrary to this, that l. 4. c. 14. he writeth, that a certayne man according to a reuelation did presently dye, the masse being ended, viatico Dominici corporis &amp; sanguinis accepto, is idle. For the Sacrament in one kind contayning in it Christs body &amp; bloud both, may be tearmed Viaticum Dominici corporis &amp; sanguinis, the food of the body and bloud of our Lord. of England, euer since her first Conuersion, vnder Saint Gregory, was vsed Communion vnder one kind for the Layty; which could neuer haue entred into the Church without being noted &amp; marked as an Heresy, had not the Church euer held Communion vnder one, or both kindes, as a thing of indifferency.
                        The fourth Argument is drawne from many signes and tokens, that the primitiue Church did sometymes vse Communion vnder one kind. First, the sicke receaued vnder the only forme of bread, as may appeare by the History of Serapion related by 
                              Euseb. l. 6. Histor. c. 36. ex ep. Dionys. Alexandrin. ad Fabium.
                            
                           Eusebius; and the Grecians at this day 
                              Genebrardus.
                            though they giue the Cup to the Communicants in the Church, yet to the sicke they send the Sacrament vnder one kind: yea Saint Ambrose, as Paulinus 
                           
                              Paulinus in vita Ambrosi
                                    •
                                 .
                            relateth in his life, at his death receaued the Sacrament vnder the sole forme of bread, and

straight after the receauing thereof gaue vp his soule. Secondly, it was an ancient custome in the Church to giue the Sacrament vnto Laymen 
                              Tertullian. ad vxor. c. 55., especially vnto 
                              Basil. epist. ad Caesar. Patritium. Pratum Spiritual. c. 79. Eremits to be carryed in most pure linnen Corporalls home to their houses, to be takē in the morning before al other meats. But there is no signe or token in Antiquity that the faythfull togeather with the consecrated bread, did carry away with them cōsecrated wine; yea diuers historyes shew the only forme of bread Minister pag. 504. It was an ancient custome to send the Communion to persōs absent in both kinds, as appeareth by Exuperius in S. Hierome, Tom. 1. Epist. 4. and S. Gregory Nazianzen of his sister Gorgonia. Answere. Exuperius (no laymen, but Bishop of Tholosa) hauing sold the syluer Ciboriums &amp; Chalices of his Church to mayntaine the poore, was forced throgh pouerty to keep the Body and Bloud in a basket of Osier, &amp; in a glasse-Cup, so carrying them about when he did administer the same in the Church to the people. But that he carryed the blood of our Sauiour in a glasse out of the Church about him, S. Hierome doth not say, yea he signifies that this vse of Osier-baskets, &amp; glasse-Cups was in the Church, saying, Nihil ditius Exuperio nostro, qui corpus Domini canistro vimineo &amp; Sanguinē portat in vitro, qui auaritiam eiecit ETEMPLO: nothing is more rich then Exuperius who doth carry the body of our Lord in an Osier-basket, and his bloud in a glasse, who hath cast Couetousnes out of the CHVRCH. Nor is it probable that he carryed the bloud about him in a glasse, when he went any iourney, exposing the same to manifest danger of being irreuerently spilled, specially glasse being so brittle and easely broken, and the ancients exceeding sollicitous and anxious, that the bloud might not be shed, nor any particle of the sacred bread fall to the ground. S. Gregory Nazianzen, sayth of his sister Gorgonia praying earnestly for the recouery of her health, That whatsoeuer of the Antitypes or Images of the pretious body and bloud her hand had hidden, that shee did bath &amp; mingle with her teares: which place Vasquez whome you so commend, as learned and intelligent, doth shew to be spoken of holy Images of Christs Passion and death, not of the blessed Sacrament. For Women were neuer permitted to touch the sacred Chalice with their hand, nor to keepe consecrated Cups in their houses for the bloud, but only white linen corporalls for the body. It had been also agaynst the Reuerence ancient Christian deuotion did beare to the pretious bloud of our Sauiour, for her to haue powred her teares into the sacred Chalice, mingling them with the pretious bloud: so that there is no signe in Antiquity that laymen did keep in their priuate houses, or did carry about them the bloud of our Sauiour in the forme of wine. Therfore in their priuate houses, and out of the Church they still receaued in one kind. was carryed away, and consequently that the Church did not then esteeme of Communiō vnder one kind, as of a sacrilegious mayming of the Sacrament, as Protestants now doe.

                            Church to cōsecrate the holy Eucharist on Saturdayes and Sundayes, &amp; on the other dayes of the weeke to Communicate ex praesanctificatis, of the presanctifyed formes, that is, consecrated on the Saturday or Sunday before. Now, it is not probable that they did consecrate wine to endure fiue or six dayes long, for feare (specially in such hoate Countreys) the same should grow sower. Wherfore for the most part they did Communicate vnder one kind. Fourthly, the

                           Manichees liued in Rome and other places, shrowding themselues amongst Catholikes, went to their Churches, receaued the Sacrament publikely with them vnder the sole forme of bread, and yet they were not noted, nor thereby discerned from Catholiques. A manifest signe, that Communion vnder one kind was publickely in the Church permitted, at the least vpon some iust

causes that might be pretended. For how could the Manichees still refusing the cup, haue been hidden amongst these ancient Christians, if they had byn perswaded as now Protestants are, that receauing vnder one kind is a sacriledge. If one in the Church of England should refuse the Cup but once in a publike Communion in the Church, would he not be incontinently noted? The Minister pag. 560. First the Manichees were espyed, else how could the Pope reproue their practise Secondly Vasquez the Iesuit sayth, That these Heretikes receaued the Cup into their hand, but dranke no wine: And amōg a great multitude, some few might hold the Cup to their mouth, &amp; make shew of drinking, and yet receaue no wine. Answere. The Pope did reproue that practise of the Manichees, because he knew it was their Heresy so to doe, in that they held wine to be the gall of the Diuell, and that Christ did not shed his bloud on the Crosse; which also to be their practise such as were conuerted from that heresy did witnesse. Vasquez doth not say, that the Manichees did only put the Cup to their mouth without drinking, and so lay hidden and vnknowne; (for he was not so simple, but he did see this could not be done, but the Deacons that gaue the Cup to the Cō
                              municants one by one, would presently haue perceaued it.) He sayth that they did drinke of the cōsecrated wine, but kept the same in their mouth, till they came to some place, where without being noted they might spit is out. Which I can not thinke to be probable. First the Manichees holding wine to be a thing so impure and detestable as the Diuells gall, how would they take the same into their mouth? Secondly, how could they keepe the wine in their mouth so longe, but that some part therof would goe downe? Thirdly, S. Leo bids Catholickes to note the men that omnino, altogeather refrayne from the Cup, signifying that they might by this their perpetuall abstinence be distinguished from Catholicks, that sometymes refrayned. But if they tooke still the wine into their mouth, kept the same there till they came to a solitary place, where they might spit it out securely, how could they be discerned by their abstayning from the Cup, more then any other Catholicks did vse to doe? Hence euen Vasquez doth acknowledge, that this argumēt drawne from the dissimulation of heretikes, namely of the Macedonian woman related by Sozom. l. 8. c. 5. is probabile, &amp; valde apparens, probable and very apparent to proue that Communion in one kind was arbitrary, and a thinge indifferent in the ancient Church.
                        
                        The last Argument, is practise of the Apostles, that is, of the first Christians vnder

them, of whome we read in the Acts of the Apostles 
                              Act. 2.42.
                           , Erant perseuerantes in doctrina Apostolorum, &amp; communicatione fractionis panis, &amp; orationibus, speaking of sacred Eucharisticall bread, the taking whereof was ioyned with prayer, which vnto the newly baptized was straight giuen after Baptisme: And yet there is no mention of wine. So that Protestants if they will haue these Christians to haue wine, they must out of their owne liberality, by way of interpretation bestow it vpon them, seeing the wordes of the text do not affoard it them The Minister pag. 507. obiects, That sundry Fathers and Authours do not vnderstād these places about Christ &amp; the Apostles, mentioning the receauing of bread without wine, of Sacred Communiō. I Answere. Diuers Fathers as the Iesuit sheweth vnderstād these places mētioning Communion of bread without wine, of Sacramental Communiō, and consequently they hold Communion in one kind to be conformable to the example of Christ and the Apostles. And though some Fathers hold that these mentioned Communions of bread without wine, were not sacred, yet their reason is not because Communion in one kind is vnlawfull, which reason yet they would haue alleadged, had the same been the doctrine of the Christian Church.. To this Apostolicall practise we may adde the example of Christ, who gaue to his two disciples in Emaus the Sacrament vnder the sole forme of bread 
                              Luc. 24. Accepit panem &amp; benedixit &amp; fregit.. That the bread Christ gaue was Eucharisticall and consecrated, the wordes of the text insinuate, some learned Fathers 
                              Aug. lib. 3. de consens. Euangel. c. 25. affirme, and the miraculous effect of opening their eyes to know Christ, and to returne to Hierusalem, &amp; the Church of the Apostles in all hast, confirmes it. That they receaued at the hands of Christ the

Sacrament vnder one only kind of bread, is euidēt by the context of the Holy narratiō, which sayth, that vpon our Sauiours breaking and giuing them bread, they knew him, and he straight vanished out of their sight. So that heere also, if Protestants will haue wine giuen to these Disciples, they must by the superabundance thereof in their expositions, supply the want thereof in Scripture; yea the Scripture in this place is hardly capable of that Exposition, the Apostles acknowledging of Christ in the very fraction &amp; giuing of bread, and our Sauiours departure in the same moment, leaues no tyme for him to giue them wine after the bread.

                        These be the warrants that Communion vnder one kind hath, being the greatest that may be: whereby appeares that the Roman Church is furnisht with all kind of proofe in this point, in which she doth seeme to her Aduersaryes to be most forsaken by Antiquity; which with all humblenes I submit to your Maiestyes Iudgement. For supposing Communion vnder one kind to be good and lawfull, that the Church could prescribe it, and that she had iust reasons to prescribe it, I will let passe without proofe, as a thing not doubted of by your Maiestyes Excellent Wisdome.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     THE EIGHT POINT.

                        IT is hard, if not impossible to giue satisfaction in this point vnto any that is not aforehand perswaded of the Catholique Doctrine of Merit.
                           THE Minister thogh he speake raylingly against our doctrine of merit, yet not knowing what he sayth, teacheth as much Merit as we do. He graunts a Merit of Congruity in wordes, and Merit of Condignity in truth. For a work may be Congruous vnto the Reward two wayes. First, meerly of Gods mercy and goodnes, not out of any intrinsecall worthynes thereof. This the Deuines tearme Merit of Cōgruity, or of meere Impetration.
                           
                           Secondly, the worke may be congruous in respect of intrinsecall honour and dignity, regarded of God and moouing him to recō
                              pence the work according to the measure &amp; quantity of this goodnes. This is properly the merit of Condignity, or which is all one of inward Congruity of the Worke with the Reward. Now, that the Minister grāts this merit of inherent Congruity and worthynes vnto good workes, his wordes manyfest. First, he sayth p. 169. lin. 26. That the merit of Christ doth by grace giue true INHERENT sanctity and purity vnto mens soules and actions. Secondly, pag. 170. lin. 26. That good workes are an ACCEPTABLE sacrifice vnto God, and the same are TRVLY good, not only comparatiuely, but according to the rule of vertue. Thirdly, pag. 174. lin. 25. That in all good works there is a DIGNITY of grace, Diuine similitude, goodnes, and honour. Fourthly, pag. 174. lin. 40. That the reward of good workes is called a Crowne of righteousnes 2. Tim. 4.8. because it is bestowed on them that exercise righteousnes, in REGARD of their righteousnes. Fiftly, pag. 174. lin. 18. That God in giuing the reward considereth the mind and quality of the Doer, the integrity, MEASVRE and QVANTITY of the worke. Thus much the Minister grantes. Now is this the merit of meer impetration &amp; extrinsecall congruity in respect of Gods goodnes, and not the merit of INHERENT RIGHTEOVSNES, Sanctity, purity, dignity of workes, God hauing promised to reward them, with regard had euen vnto the MEASVRE and quantity of that their inherent goodnes? Surly M. White, no iudicious Protestāt wil grant thus much as you haue done; or if he do, he will neuer deny merit of condignity, or inherēt iustice to be found in good workes. And if you grant, vnto Good workes the merit of inherent Iustice, you grant the thing of merit condigne; which granted it is idle to contend about the name, specially seing the title of Merit of condignity is not defined by the Church of Rome.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Doctrine of Merit declared. §. 1.
                        
                        THIS doctrine is much misliked by Protestants, as 
                              Concerning Merit.
                            proud, and arrogant, yet not so much misliked as misunderstood, their dislike growing from misconstruction thereof. For Catholiques hold that no worke is meritorious with God of it owne nature, but to make the same meritorious many graces are required &amp; those most diuine &amp; excellent, particularly these seauen.
                        The first grace is diuine Preordination, because God out of his owne goodnes ordeyned man and his actions vnto a supernaturall last end, aboue that he might attayne

vnto by meere nature, without which ordination no worke would haue reference or correspondency with heauenly glory.
                        The second is, the grace of Redemption by Christ Iesus, without whome we and our workes are defiled, we being by nature the children of wrath, &amp; should be so still, had not he by his passion and death appeased God, giuing vs the inestimable treasure of his merits, so that, In illo benedixit nos Deus omni benedictione spirituali in caelestibus, in quo habemus redemptionem per sanguinem eius, secundum diuitias gratiae suae, quae superabundauit in nobis. [Ephes. 1.3.]
                        The third is, grace of Adoption in Baptisme, wherby soules are supernaturally beautifyed by participation of the diuine Nature. Whence a tryple dignity redounds vnto workes, one by the grace of adoption from God the Father, who in respect of this Adoption regardes good workes, as the workes of his Children. [Rom. 8.14.] Another is from God the holy Ghost dwelling in vs, by whome good workes are honoured as by the principall authour of thē. So that he rather then we doth the works, who therefore is sayd to pray for vs with vnspeakable grones. The last dignity is frō God the Sonne Christ Iesus whose members we are made by grace, so that the works we do, be reputed not so much ours as his, as the worke of the particular member is attributed principally vnto the head.
                        
                           The fourth is, grace Preuenient, wherby God stirreth vp in vs thoughts and affections to good &amp; pious workes, &amp; grace adiuuant to help vs in the performance of these desires, making our Freewill produce workes that are supernaturall in their very substance, &amp; aboue the capacity of man.
                        The fifth is, the grace of of mercifull Indulgence, in not vsing with vs the rigour of his iustice. For God might wholly require the good works we doe as his own, by many tytles; as by the tytle of iustice being workes of his seruants, by tytle of Religion being workes of his Creatures, by tytle of gratitude as being workes of persons infinitely obliged vnto him. By which tytles, if God did exact vpon workes with vttermost rigour, no goodnes would be left in them to be offered for the meriting of heauen. But his infinite benignity remitting this rigour, moued thereunto through the merits of Christ, is content that we make vse of our good workes for the gayning of glory, &amp; doth not exact them wholly and totally, as otherwise due.
                        The sixt is, the grace of liberal promise, by which he obligeth himselfe to reward the good workes of his Children according to the desert of their goodnesse. Did not God bind himselfe by his word in this manner, no worke of Saints, though neuer so perfect and excellent, were able to bind him to reward it, as all Deuines teach, though

some disputatiō be, whether, Gods liberall premission supposed, the goodnes of the work concurre partially with his promise to oblige him, which is a disputation of no great moment.
                        Finally, that Merit attayne reward, is required the grace of Perseuerance, without which no man is crowned. And though good workes strengthened with so many supernaturall excellencyes be good stayes of conficence in themselues considered, yet because we are not sure of our perseuerāce, no nor altogeather certayne that we haue good works adorned with the former perfections,
                              THE Minister pa. 511. Can any thing be more arrogant &amp; foolish then for miserable beggars &amp; sinners to mintayne, that God should be vniust if he rendred not heauen to mans good workes? And yet this proud Doctrine is deliuered by the Rhemists, Annotat. Heb. 6.4. Answere. In your hoat-spur-zeale you wound the Blessed Apostle with the tytle of arrogant Foole. It is he who doth suppose as certaine, &amp; who taught the Rhemysts to say, that God should be vniust did he not reward the good workes of his Children: for to assure the Hebrews their chatyes should not be vnrewarded of God, he sayth Hebr. 6.10. God is not vniust to forget your workes, and loue which you shewed in his name in ministring vnto the Saints. As if he had said, God should be vniust, did he forget your workes &amp; not reward them: But God cannot be vniust. Therfore be sure he will not forget your works. Euen as whē the Scripture, to assure men of Gods word, sayth Num. 23.19. God is not as man that he should lye, the same doth tacitely argue in this sort: If God should not keepe his word, he should be a liar as men are. God cā
                                 not be a lyar as mē are. Therefore you may be sure he will not forget to keep his word. You should be more considerate and not thus rudely runne tilting with bul-rush-inuectimes agaynst the holy Ghost himselfe, in your splene agaynst the Pope. For this sentēce, God shold be vniust did he forget to reward good workes, is the Scriptures, though about the quality of the Iustice that is in God, whether the same be proper or improper, a question is made by Deuines: neyther did the Rhemists say, God should be properly vniust, but only vsed the very words of S. Paul.
                              
                              The Minister pag. 512. If the Iesuit should maintayne that Good workes meret iustification or perseuerance, not by their Nature, but by Grace, this distinction would not free his Tenet from errour: so likwise it is erroneous to mayntayne that Good workes merit by grace. Answere. If Good works should merit iustification, they must do it by the force of the goodnes inherent in their nature, and not as eleuated by the grace of adoption, seing before iustification they be not Gods Children. But to say that men merit with God by the sole naturall goodnes of their workes, not eleuated by the grace of adoption, is erroneous. The workes of Gods Children cannot merit the grace of perseuerance, because they be not eleuated vnto that end by the grace of diuine preordination, and Gods liberall promise. Besides the workes of the iust be condignely rewarded with the Crowne of Glory and so nothing of their value can be spared to merit any thinge Condignely, but only glory. If the workes of Gods Children were not otherwise Condignely rewarded, they might merit the grace of perseuerance, should God promise the same vnto Good workes done in a certayne number and quality; so your instance bewrayes your ignorance.
                              The Minister pag. 512. S. Paul sayth, Rom. 8.18. I thinke the Passions of this tyme be not Condigne to the glory to come, that shall be reuealed in vs. The Passions here expressed were Martyrdomes iustifyed by grace, Philip. 1.29. spirituall Sacrifices of a sweet smelling odour, 2. Tim. 46. and Condignity, or worthines equall in desert or value is denyed vnto them. Answere. The Apostle sayth that the Passions of time be not Condigne of their owne Temporall and fleeting nature vnto infinit eternall glory. Therfore to the end they may be cōdigne, they must be eleuated by the grace of diuine adoption. For thus goeth the whole discourse, The spirit himselfe giueth testimony to our spirit, that we are the Children of God. If his Children then his heyres, the heyres of God, fellow-heyres with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him that we may be glorifyed with him. For I thinke the Passions of this time not to be condigne vnto the future glory. By this it is cleere S. Paul meaneth that the Passions of tyme be not proportionable in their nature which is temporall &amp; fleeting, vnto the eternity of glory; &amp; therfore they must be aduanced &amp; made deare and pretious to God by the grace of adoption, which is a grace proportionable vnto glory; for if we be the Children of God, we be the heyres of his glory.
                              And if the Ministers Argument were good, it would otherthow the merit of inward inherent congruity which he doth acknowledge. For Saynt Paul might truly haue sayd, Passions of tyme, or which are of transitory and fleeting nature, are not congruous in respect of the eternity of glory, yea the Passions of Christ being temporall, and short were not by their owne nature condigne, or Congruous vnto eternall glory, nor could haue been condigne, had they not been eleuated by the dignity of Gods naturall sonne, from whome they proceeded.
                              Minister pag. 517. The Iesuit hath set fire on his owne house: for if we owe our works vnto to God (as he sayth we doe) by the titles of iustice, Religion &amp; gratitude, what peeping hole, I pray you, is left for merit, to creepe in at? Answere. Our workes by the titles of iustice, Religion and gratitude are due vnto God, so farre as he doth please to exact them by his law, and no further: but he is pleased not wholly and totally to exact them by the aforesayd titles, but to leaue them vnto men, to vse them for the gayning of the crowne of glory, as we are taught by his word. Hence mans merit is not in rigour of iustice, but grounded vpon Gods mercifull indulgence, in not exacting vpon workes with vttermost rigour. This mercifull indulgence is a wide gate, by the which Merit makes entrance into Gods Children, shewed you by the Iesuit; yet so blind you are as you see it not, but goe peeping about to find an hole for Merit to creep in at.
                            the Catholike Saints of God vse not to cōfide in their merits past, specially being guilty of diuers dayly negligences, but fly to Gods mercyes, as the Church teacheth vs in the Lyturgy of the Masse, dayly praying, In sanctorum nos consortium non aestimator meriti, sed veniae quaesumus largitor, admitte. 
                           
                              The Ministers Arguments, or rather Inuestiues agaynst this doctrine of Merit, with a short Answer thereunto.
                           
                        
                        Did Protestants know that we require all these diuine fauours to make any worke meritorious; did they also consider how singular and excellent these fauours are, they would not perchance wonder, that workes graced with so many excellencies should haue some proportiō with the heauenly Reward. And so dealing with your Maiesty, who is well able to ponder these things, I shall without proofe passe by this doctrine, as not particularly belonging to the proposed difficulty.
                     
                     
                        
                        Merit of workes of Supererogation. §. 2.
                        
                        WHEREFORE to come to works of Supererogation, these workes besides the seauen aforenamed graces, suppose another singular fauor, &amp; stand groū
                           ded theron. This fauour is, that God thogh he might, yet doth not rigorously require of his Saints &amp; seruants, that in his seruice they do the vttermost of their forces. He hath prescribed vnto men certayne Lawes &amp; Cōmaundements, which if they keep he is satisfyed, and what they do voluntary beyond these commaunded dutyes, he receaues as a gracious &amp; spontaneous guift. This diuine benignity is noted by Saint Chrysostome [Homil. 21. in priorem ad Cor.] and excellently declared in these wordes: Ete nim cum benignus sit Dominus, suis praeceptit multum admiscuit mansuctudinis. Potuisset enim, si hoc voluisset, preceptum magis intendere &amp; augere, &amp; dicere: Qui non perpetuò ieiunat puniatur, qui non exercet virginitatem det poenas, qui se non omnibus exuit facultatibus luat vltimum supplicium: sed non hoc f
                                 •
                              cit, concedent nobis, vt non solum ex iussu, sed etiam ex libero faciamus arbitrio.
                        
                        Wherefore the precept, Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God, with all thy hart, with all thy soule, with all thy strength, doth not commaund an entyre imployment of all our vttermost forces: Nor that we neuer loue,

nor desire, nor thinke of any thing besides him, nor that all our thoughts and affections be wholly, entirely, &amp; perpetually on him. For this were a thing impossible, and God doth not require of vs thinges impossible,

as 
                              Ioan 5.3. Mandata eius grauia non sunt. Scriptures and Fathers 
                              Basil. ho. in illud Moysis, attende tibi ipsi. Impium est asserere mandata Spiritus Sancti impossibiliae esse obseruatu.
                            teach. This precept therefore commands a quadruple integrity of diuine loue. The first integrity is in respect of our selues, that we loue God wholly and entyrely, not only with the outside, but with the inside,

euen to the bottome of our soule, that is in a word, Sincerely.
                        
                        The second integrity is in respect of God, that we loue God according to all his Commaundements, not leauing any vnkept; and so to loue God entirely, or with all the hart is the same, as to walke in all his Commaundements.
                        The third integrity is in regard of the effect of loue, which is to ioyne men in friendship with God, whome we must so loue that there be no breach between God and vs, nor we seperated from him; which we doe so long as we keep his commaundements, without sinning mortally agaynst them.
                        The fourth integrity is in respect of time, that we loue him entierely, not only for this present life, but also desiring &amp; hoping to see and loue him for eternity. And in this sense

                           Bernard, and other Fathers are to be vnderstood, that say in the precept, Diliges Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, is conteyned the perfection of the life to come, and a perfection impossible to be atteyned to in this life, to wit, it is conteyned in the precept, not as a perfection commanded to be practised in this life, but as a perfection to be desired and hoped for in the next; so that he that loues God sincerely from the bottome of hart, to the keeping of all his Commaundments, perfectly without breach of

friendship betweene him and God, hauing his desires &amp; loue referred with hope vnto Eternity, without question he loueth God with all his hart, soule, &amp; strength.
                              What the Minister cauilleth agaynst this truth, is reduced to two heades. Minister pag. 522. First to the definition of workes of supererogation is required, that all which the Diuine law commandes be fullfilled. But if iust men haue sinne, they performe not all the Diuine law doth require. For euery sinne is a transgression of the Diuine law, 1. Iohn. 3.4,
                              Answere. The law of God bindeth men to performe the workes thereof, so farre as they are necessary vnto Saluation, vnto which the obseruance of the law is ordayned, If thou wilt enter into life, keepe the commandments, Math. 19.17. Hence veniall sinne is not properly agaynst the law of God, but against the decency and perfection of reason, the law of God supposed, and his goodnes towards man. The place you cite, as Saint Iohns, Euery sinne is a transgression of the diuine law, is by you falsifyed, as I haue shewed in the Censure, Sect. 4. §. 9. though also that text speake of mortall sinne, not of veniall. The testimony of S. Bernard serm. 2. de Vig. Nat. by you cited p. 522. affirming that God cōmands his law to be kept exceedingly, that when we cannot doe it, finding our imperfection, we may flye to his mercy, is vnderstood of veniall sinner,  which, no man can totally auoyd, which sinnes though they be not directly against the Diuine law, nor properly agaynst any law, yet they are agaynst the decency of reason the Diuine law supposed as hath been said. Hence it followes, that the cōmitting of veniall sinnes doth not hinder, but we may do works of supererogation; not works of supererogation in rigour of iustice, but through Gods merciful indulgēce in not exacting of vs so much as he might. Suppose a slaue being bound to worke 8. houres a day, worke only seauen: If his master forgiue him this fault, without any new obligation, but that henceforward he worke 8. houres a day, this slaue if he worke afterward 10. houres a day, doth he not a worke of supererogation? Yes certaynly, though a worke of supererogatiō grounded on his maisters benignity. In this manner, seeing God forgiueth his Children their dayly faults vpon their dayly crauing perdon, without putting new obligations vpon them, more then that they keepe still his law, if they doe workes more then his law exacts, they truly do workes of supererogation.
                              Minister pag. 526. No man though he giue all to the poore &amp;c. can exceed the highest and strictest measure of Charity and obedience in this life. For the Euangelicall law commandeth vs to be perfect, as our heauenly father is perfect, Matth. 5.48. and to loue, as Christ loued vs, Rom. 5.7.8. and through the obligation of gratitude we owe vnto God, according to S. Bernard, Omne quod sumus, omne quod possumus, Answere. The Euangelicall law doth not require that we should be perfect as God is in equality, but only in similitude, that as he loueth his enemyes and doth them good turnes, that we likewise loue our Enemyes and doe them the good turnes we are bound to doe by his law, which the Children of God by Diuine grace may do, and more also. Nor are we bound to haue charity equal vnto our Sauiours, but only like vnto his, to wit, that as he loued vs so as he dyed for vs, that we likewise dye for our brethren, when need requires, which many Saynts haue done and dayly do practise. By the band of gratitude we owe vnto God all that we are, and all that we can, so fare as it is required by his law, and no further. We are bound by gratitude also in pr
                                       •
                                    paratione animi, to be ready to doe more then his law doth exact, when he shall by speciall precept lay that obligation vpon vs.
                              Hence it is manifest, that the band of gratitude doth not hinder the possibility of doing works of supererogation, as may be declared by this example. Suppose the King pardon a gentleman condemned of treason and remit vnto him the forfeyture of his lands and goods, whereby he  oweth all he is, and hath to the King in Gratitude. Suppose also that the King exacting a Subsidy of his subiects, require no more of this gentleman then he takes of another of his quality; Verily this subiect is bound to giue no more then another; and if he giue an hundred pound more thē any other, it is a gratuity, a worke of supererogation, which he might haue omitted without any iust offence or ingratitude, yet a gratuity grounded on the Kings manifold gracious liberalityes, towardes him. Such is our case with God. He doth not exact of vs by the title of gratitude so much as he might, by which his goodnes we are inabled to offer gratuityes vnto him, which we might without offence or ingratitude not haue offered▪ By the light of this annotation the mist of the Ministers Cauills is dissolued, wherewith he would obscure the consent of Fathers about workes of superogation set downe in the next Paragraffe.
                           
                        
                     
                     
                        
                        The Fathers taught works of Supererogation
                           ▪ and proued them by Sccipture. §. 3.
                        
                        BVT they that loue God so perfectly as they loue not only his Commaundements, but also his Councells; not only shunne such sins as separate from God, but also such as hinder the perpetuall actuall loue of God. These be they that doe more then they are commaunded, that is, doe workes of Supererogation. And if your Maiesty call to mind vpon how manifold graces this Merit is grounded, you will not I hope, condemne the same of arrogancy, but rather respect it as being taught by holy Fathers, euen in the expresse tearmes of Supererogation. In proofe wherof I alleadge these few testimonies.

                        I will not bring more proofes of this doctrine out of Scripture which the Fathers I cited proue by the words of Saint Paul 
                           1. Cor. 7., in expresse tearmes affirming that there are besides Precepts, works of Supererogation or Counsells: De virginibus praeceptum Domini non habeo, sed consilium do. Nor will I alleadge more testimonies of Fathers, which might be produced in great number most playne and pregnant. Only I cannot omit one place of Saint Ambrose, who deliuering this doctrine, doth togeather answere a Protestant vulgar obiection agaynst it: 
                              Ambros. l. de viduis, vltra medium.
                            
                           Itaque qui praeceptum impleuerint possunt

dicere, serui inutiles sumus, quod debuimus facere fecimus. Hoc virgo non dicit, non dicit qui bona sua vendidit, sed quasi reposita expectat praemia, sicut Sanctus Apostolus ait, Ecce nos reliquimus omnia &amp; secuti sumus te, quid ergo erit nobis? Sunt enim

                           spadones qui se castrauerunt propter regnum Caelorum, sed hoc non omnibus imperatur, sed ab omnibus flagitatur. Virgo prouocatur consilijs, non vinculis alligatur; sed nec vidua praeceptum accipit, sed consilium. What can be more cleerly spoken for works of Supererogation or Coū
                           sells?
                        Neyther is there any arrogancy as I said before, in this doctrine. For neyther the Fathers, nor we attribute more vnto man then Protestants doe; but only acknowledge one kind of diuine liberality towards man, which Protestants be some-what backward to belieue: for supposing that God exacteth much lesse then he might, &amp; much lesse then man is able by his grace to performe, Protestants will not deny but a man may offer vnto God some voluntary seruices beyond commaunded duties; Catholikes also graunt, that had God vsed the vttermost seuerity of charging vs with debts, as he might haue done, we could neuer by any measure of grace that now is ordinarily affoarded vnto men, haue complyed with all our obligations, much lesse haue performed vnrequired offices. The difference therfore betweene them and vs

is this: They thinke that God seuerely exacteth of man, that euer, &amp; in all occasions he worke according to the vtter most of his power, yea commaunds him thinges impossible for him to performe.
                        Contrariwise, we hold, that God, to the end his Law may be vnto men a sweet yoke, a light loade, and his Commaundements not difficile, doth not exact of man all that man is able to doe with his grace, but much lesse, and so much lesse as man is able through this remission to offer him liberalityes. What pride is it for man, to acknowledge this sweet prouidence of his Creatour, to prayse his mercyfull Indulgence, in not exacting so much as he might; specially belieuing, that this diuine Indulgence not to exact of man, &amp; consequētly mans ability to present vnto God, more perfect and excellent seruice then he requires, is giuen him through the merits of CHRIST IESVS?
                     
                     
                        The doctrine of Satisfaction. §. 4.
                        
                        THE other part of this Cōtrouersy proposed by your Maiesty about workes referred vnto the Treasure of the Church, concernes good Workes, not as they are meritorious of reward, but as they are satisfactory for sinne. For the workes of Saints, as they are merits, be layd vp, not in the Treasury of the Church to be applyed

vnto others: but in the memory of God, to receyue their deserued guerdon in due tyme What the Minister heere Cauilleth about Communion of Satisfactions, not of merits betwixt Saynts, is refelled after ward §. 5. in the Annotation at lit. (x).
                        This doctrine of Satisfaction is like vnto the former of Merit, much spoken against, &amp; by many disliked in the highest degree, who yet perchance doe not much vnderstand what they so earnestly impugne, as may appeare by this briefe declaration of our doctrine in this point.
                        First we doe not thinke, that any sinner can make satisfaction by works vnto God, for the guilt of Mortall or damnable sinne. The reason is, because works of Satisfaction are such as merit pardon, and obtayne it, by some kind of Iustice from God. The works of his Children, may merit in this sort, as being the workes of them that are instruments of the holy Ghost, dwelling &amp; operating within them, &amp; liuing members of Christ his mysticall body, receauing influence of life and operation from him, as from their head. Sinners are neyther the Children of God, nor the Temples of the Holy Ghost, nor liuing members of Christ, so their workes cannot be so gracious, as they may deserue any thing as due to them in any kind of Iustice from God, much lesse can they deserue so great a reward, as remission of mortall sinne, and of the eternall punishment due thereunto.
                        Secondly, we doe not teach, that any Saint or Angell, can make satisfaction vnto

God for the mortall sinne of any man, no not all Saints &amp; Angells putting togeather all their good works and satisfactions. The reason is, because an Iniury is so much the greater, by how much the person that offers it, is Base, and the person to whome it is offered is Noble, as the light of reason &amp; the estimation of mankind sheweth. But God whome man casteth away &amp; abandoneth by sinne, &amp; consequently wronges, is of infinite dignity, and man offending him comparatiuely with him infinitely base: wherfore mortall sinne which is an abandoning of God for some transitory content, is iniury done vnto God incomparably grieuous. On the other side satisfaction is the lesse esteemed, by how much the person satisfying is meane, and the person offended great. Men and Angells what are they, being compared with God? Certainly nothing; therfore certainly their works &amp; satisfactions are inestimably disproportionable to satisfy for any the least mortall sinne, the guilt wherof is so great a debt as it is vnsatisfiable, but only by the precious bloud of the Sonne of God. He being a person Coequall &amp; Consubstantiall with his Father, to satisfy Gods anger by humbling the infinite dignity of his persō, vnto the most disgracefull death of the Crosse, offered satisfaction full and complete, yea superabundant; the person satisfying in regard of his Diuinity being infinitly more

honorable, then the person offending was contemptible by reason of his basenes.
                        Thirdly, the Roman Church teacheth, that those that haue byn made the Childrē of God by Baptisme, if they sinne mortally afterward, when they repent God forgiues them the guilt of sinne, and consequently the eternall punishment by the Sacrament of Pennance, bountifully &amp; graciously through the meer merits of Christ, without their satisfaction; only they must by Fayth, by feare, by hope, by Contrition, by purposes of amendment prepare &amp; make themselues capable of that gracious and grace-infusing pardon.
                        Fourthly, the Roman Church holdes, that God by Pennance forgiuing the eternall punishment, doth in lieu thereof many tymes appoint a taske of tēporall paine, to be endured by the Penitent. This reserued penalty is greater or lesser according to the multitude, and grieuousnes of the sinnes committed, and is that for which penitents may and must satisfy. And why may not the penall workes, performed by the Children of God, beautifyed by so many aforenamed excellent graces be sufficient to deserue of God the remission of this temporall mulct, and cancell the debt of enduring transitory payne? I could bring testimonyes of the most ancient Fathers in great number, for the necessity we haue of suffering these voluntary afflictions for

sinnes, and of the efficacity therof, to expiate sinne with the very name of Satisfaction, 
                              The Minister would fayne elude this consent of Fathers by diuers Shifts, but two be the chiefe, which I will heere fully refute. Pag. 544. he saith: The Romists in their course of doctrine about Satisfaction, peruert all that which the Fathers taught. First, that which the Fathers speake of the fault and guilt of sinne, they wrest to the temporall payne of mortall sinne, remayning after the remission of the euerlasting guilt. Answer. You are according to the Ministerial wōt, proud, &amp; bold in your accusations, but poore and miserable in your proofs. You say the Fathers spake not of the tēporall payne of mortall sinne, but of the very guilt thereof. And in another place pag. 547. yet more boldely, WHAT SOEVER is spoken in holy Scripture, or by the ancient Fathers, concerning redeming sinnes by satisfaction, belonges to the fault and eternall payne of sinne; and this satisfaction, must be performed by the delinquent himselfe in this present life. This you say, but  proue it not, yea the contrary is cleere truth, and proued by these 4. or 5. Arguments.
                              First, if after the remission of the euerlasting guilt, there remayne a temporall payne to be mitigated, and taken away by penitential workes, then there is no reason to thinke but the Fathers spake something thereof. But your selfe p. 540. lin. vlt. say, That there is a remaynder of Temporall affliction after the remission of the guilt of sin. And pag 541. lin. 7. That this temporall payne may be remoued, or mitigated by workes of mortification and pennance. Therefore you haue no reason to thinke the Fathers neuer spake thereof.
                              Secondly, The Fathers spake of that kind of satisfaction which Dauid made vnto God for his adultery and murder of Vrias, yea they make this satisfaction of Dauid the prototype and perfect patterne of that satisfaction they require. Hilarius in Psal. 118. &amp; alij. But Dauid his satisfaction by patient enduring penaltyes inflicted, was satisfaction for the temporal payne, and not for the staine and eternal guilt of sinne, which was remitted longe before, presently vpon his inward contrition and repentance, Dominus à te transtulit peccatum tuum, 2. Reg. 12.13. Therefore the satisfaction which Scriptures, and the Fathers require, is for the temporall payne, not for the guilt of mortall sinne.
                              Thirdly, the Fathers teach, that after inward griefe, and contrition for sinne, (by which they knew the guilt of sinne and of eternall payne was remitted, according to the truth of Gods word Ezechiel 18.22.) long continued satisfaction must be done, to pacify Gods wrath, Cyprian. Epist. 40. Dominus longa &amp; continua satisfactione placandus est. But the guilt of sinne and eternall paine being remitted, men need not, nor cannot satisfye but for the temporall.
                              Fourthly, the Fathers teach, that men must seeke to satisfye for their sinnes, euen after they be iust, and Gods adopted Children (Hierom. in Epitaph. Paulae.) but in the Children of God the euerlasting guilt is remitted, and nothing can remayne to be remoued by satisfaction but the guilt of Temporall payne. Finally, the Fathers teach, that after this life, often there remayneth something of sinne to be expiated by Purgatory paynes, from which soules may be released and relieued by the pious workes of their liuing friends. So sayth S. Augustine expressely l. 21. de Ciuit. c. 24. serm. 32. de verbis Apostol. and many others.
                              I omit other demonstrations of this truth. To what you so much obiect that Fathers say, men must redeeme their sinns and satisfy for their offences to God, I Answere: By sinne, they meane the payne due vnto  sinne, which is tearmed sinne, because it is the effect of sinne. Hence sinne is sayd after the remission thereof to remayne in the soule, to wit, in his effect, nor can the soule be sayd to be fully cleansed vntill this debt be satisfyed.
                              Minister pag. 544. Secondly, that which the Fathers stiled Satisfaction improperly, and by way of deprecation, the Romists make satisfaction of condignity, yea of rigour of Iustice. Nazarius in 3 p. D. Thom. q. 1. art. 2. controu. 7. pag. 113. And for veniall sinne, more effectuall then Christs satisfaction. Suarez▪ Tom. 4. in 3. p. disp. 48. sect. 3. Answere. Your slaūdring humour is intolerable. Nazarius sayth &amp; proueth that our satisfactiō neither is, nor can be in rigour of iustice. He addeth: If our satisfaction be ioyned with Christs, dicetur eam esse de rigore iustiti
                                       •
                                     ratione satisfactionis Christi, it shall be sayd to be in rigour of iustice in respect (not of it selfe) but of the satisfaction of Christ. Hence you charge him with this proposition, Men may make satisfaction to God in rigour of iustice. Verily you may as well accuse S. Paul of making himselfe omnipotent, absolutely, and without any modification, because he sayth, I can do all thinges (not in my selfe) but in him that strengthneth me. Philip. 4.13. Suarez sayth that the inward contrition inhering in the sinners hart, is more effectuall to expell veniall sinne by way of formall opposition therewith, then Christs satisfaction; tamen satisfactio Christi in ratione meriti perfectior est; yet the satisfaction of Christ is more perfect and efficacious to expell sinne by way of merit. Heere agayne you are shewed a slanderous relatour of our Doctrine, and a falsifyer of Authours.
                              Neyther do we teach, that condigne satisfaction may be made vnto God in respect of the offence agaynst the Diuine Maiesty, nor can we cō
                                 dignely satisfy his iust anger, which hath a kind of infinity, through the dignity of the person offended, but only in respect of Temporall payne. In which respect men may make vnto God satisfaction iust, condigne, equal, compensant, the Fathers say expressely. Tertullian libro de poenitentia: Christ proposeth pardon of sinnes to be REDEEMED by the COMPENSATION of pennance. Origen homil. 15. in Leuit. By the fruites of pennance, by laborious good works, the PRICE of the redemption of sinne is gathered together. S. Cyprian l 1. epist 3. By lamentations and IVST satisfactions sinnes are REDEEMED. S. Hilar. can. 4. in Matth. How shall we PAY the last FARTHING OF PAINE, vnlesse by the PRICE of Charitable deeds to the needy, our sinnes be REDEEMED? S. Basil orat. super verba, Atende tibi ipsi: Is thy sinne great and grieuous? Thou must needes apply agaynst it much and frequent confession, bitter weeping, longe &amp; laborious watching, continuall and neuer-interrupted fasting:  let thy Pennance be EQVALL vnto thy sinne. S. Hierom. in cap. 1. Ioelis. Let the sinner COMPENSATE by the austerity of pennance, his former pleasures wherwith he offended God. And, in Epit. Paulae. The body must be punished by sharp intreaty, which hath been long inured to pleasure: much time spent in laughing must be COMPENSATED by continuall weeping. Theodoret Epitom. diuinorum Decretor. c. de Poenit. Euen the wounds after Baptisme are curable, but not without many teares, and weepings, and mournings, and fastings, and prayngs, and by payne CONTEMPERED vnto the QVANTITY of the sinne. S. Gregory homil. 20. in Euang. We must not only do the fruits and workes of pennance, but workes of pennance that be WORTHY or CONDIGNE; DIGNOS poenitentiae fructus. Venerable Bede l. 1. in Lucam c. 2. Sacrifice vnto God a sacrifice of IVSTICE, that is, Be so angry agaynst your former sinnes, that you massacre them, by doing CONDIGNE works of penance, punishing your selues for EVERY SINNE, IVST AS MVCH, as CONDIGNE pennance requires. This is a Sacrifice of IVSTICE.
                              
                              Thus the Fathers teach, prouing their Doctrine by Scripture, whereby your vanity is manifest, who thinke to elude their Testimonies by the distinction, That they spake of satisfaction of deprecation and impetrant, not of condignity and compensant. Agaynst whome the Fathers, as if they had forseen your forgery, oppose themselues directly, formally, and in tearmes.
                            
                            there being scarse any ancient Father, that hath not taught both the thing, and the word.
                     
                     
                        Worke, with reference vnto the Treasure of the Church. §. 5.
                        
                        BVT I suppose these testimonies are vnto your Maiesty well knowne, &amp; therfore in this proposed difficulty, supposing the satisfaction for sinne to be possible, you mooue this doubt; Whether the penitents can so fully satisfy for themselues, as their satisfactions may superabound and be referred into the treasure of the Church? To satisfy this doubt, three propositions are to be proued.
                        The first, that good works of Saints that are penall and afflictiue doe not only merit heauen, but also satisfy for sinne. This is proued. Giuing of Almes for the loue of Christ, is meritorious; witnes our Sauiour himselfe, who to the Iust, in the reward of their Almes, will giue the Kingdome prepared from the beginning of the world. [Matth. 23.] And it is also satisfactory for sinne, witnesse Daniel, who gaue this coū
                           sell

vnto the Babylonian King, 
                              Daniel 4.24. 
                           Redeeme thy sinnes with Almes-deeds, and thine iniquityes with mercyes, vnto the poore. And Saint Chrysostome 
                           
                              Chrysost. hom. 25. in Act. Apost.
                            who saith, There is no sinne, which giuing of Almes cannot cancell. And Saint Cyprian: 
                              Cyprian. Serm. d. Eleemosyna.
                            
                           Eleemosynis, atque operibus iustis delictorum flamma sopitur.
                        
                        Prayer is likwise meritorious with God; our Sauiour exhorteth euery man to pray secretly in his Closet, promising that, 
                              Matth. 6.6.7. 
                           Thy Father, who seeth what is done in secret, will reward thee. It is also satisfactory for sinne. Saint Augustine 
                           
                              Aug. Enchyr. c. 7

                              ▪
                            sayth: The dayly prayer

of the faythfull doth satisfy for their quotidian, &amp; light offences, without which none can leade this life.
                        To fast, is meritorious, when it proceeds from a pure hart, to which our Sauiour in the 6. of Saint Matthew, promised recompence: and that it is penall and satisfactory for Corporall penaltyes, the fact of the Niniuites 
                           
                              Ionae cap. vlt.
                            sheweth aboundantly; so that the same workes of the Iust as pious, doe merit, and shall haue in heauen a plentifull reward; as penall doe satisfy and obtayne full remission of the temporall penaltyes remayning to be suffered for sinne. In confirmation whereof, memorable is the saying of Saint Cyprian 
                           
                              Cypr. serm. de lapsis, circa finem.

                        The second Proposition. Many Saints endured more penaltyes and afflictions in this life, then were necessary for the recompensing of the temporall paines due to their sinnes. The Blessed Virgin The Ministers rayling agaynst the Doctrine which makes the Blessed Virgin free frō actual sinne, is discouered in the Censure, Sect. 4. §. 9. pag. 120. neuer committed actuall sinne; witnesse S. Ambrose 
                           
                              Ambros. serm. vlt. in Psal. 118. tearming her, ab omni integram labe peccati; and S. Augustine saying 
                              Aug. de Nat. &amp; Grat. cap. 36., Plus gratiae ei collatum est, ad vincendum ex omni parte peccatum: Yet she endured many afflictions, her many Iourneyes, specially her banishment into Aegypt, her standing at the foote of the Crosse when the sword of sorrow pierced through her hart, besides

her many voluntary Fastings, and Prayings, and other penitentiall workes which were dayly practised in the course of her most holy life. Saint Iohn the Baptist 
                           
                              Luc. 1. v. 8.
                           , what a pure and immaculate course of life held he from his Infancy, in the wildernes? Neuer committed any great sinns, yea scarse so much as light sinnes, as the Fathers 
                              Gregor. in cap. 2. Iob. 11. Numquid credimus aliquid fuisse quod in Ioannis vita mors tergeret? Venerab. Beda ho. de decollat. Ioan. Quis dicere audeat Ioannem in actu, vel dicto, habitu, vel victu peccasse? Quis in eius praecordijs esse poterat peccato locus &amp;c? teach, gathering their opinion of this his sanctiiy from the Scripture: and yet extremely penitentiall was he in his continuall praying, fasting, lying on the ground, enduring cold, wind &amp; weather, his wearing continually a rough hayre-cloath, whereof Saint Paulinus writes 
                              Paulin. ep. 11. ad Seuerum.
                           :

                              Vestis erat curui setis compacta Cameli,
                              Contra Luxuriam molles duraret vt artus,
                              Arceret
                                    
                                       
                                    
                                    que

What a mighty masse of superabounding That Saints can make superaboundant satisfaction, is also proued by the sayings of the Minister in the Cē
                              sure, Sect. 4. §. 5. Satisfactions were gathered from the life of this Saint alone?
                        The Prophets of the old Testamēt, what afflictions did they endure? Which Saint Paul 
                           
                              Ad Heb. 11.36. gathers togeather in the eleauenth Chapter of his Epistle to the Hebrews, being neuertheles men of most holy life, innocent, and without any grieuous sinnes, 1. Cor. 4.2. Cor. 11▪
                              
                            
                           That the world was vnworthy of them. As also the Apostles, whose labours were intollerable, specially such as Saint Paul records endured by himselfe, who yet after Baptisme (in which his sinnes were fully and certainly remitted) neuer did grieuously

offend God. The labours 
                              Cypr. l. 4. epist. 2. and torments of Martyrs were extreme, and yet any the least Martyrdome is sufficient to satisfy for any great multitude of offences, 
                              Aug. tract. 64. in Ioan.
                            
                           quoad reatum culpae &amp; poenae. Of whose merits the Church in the primitiue times did make most account; to whom afterwards succeeded another kind of Martyrdome, 
                              Ber. serm. 41. in Cantica.
                            
                           Terrore quidem mitius, sed diuturnitate molestius, of holy Confessours, specially of many most holy Eremites.
                        These manifold afflictions endured by Saints, far aboue measure of the temporall penalty, which after the eternal was graciously remitted did remayne due to their offences, did not perish, nor were forgottē, but were layd vp in the memory of God.
                        The third Proposition. The treasure of the Church consisteth principally of the superabundāt satisfactions of Christ, who did endure much more then was necessary for the Redemption of man; wherewith are ioyned the satisfactions of Saints. We ioyne the satisfactions of Saints with the satisfactiō of Christ, in the Churches treasure, not because we belieue the bloud of Christ to be insufficient alone, to satisfy for sinnes, nisi velut arescentis &amp; exhausti defectus aliunde suppleatur &amp; sufficiatur: (as mistakingly, not to say calumniously, Caluin [lib. 4. Instit. cap. 9. n. 39.] reporteth of vs.) For Pope Clement the 6. (whome Protestants accuse as the first Authour of this

Treasure) affirmes euen in his Cōstitution about this matter, that the bloud of Christ is of an infinite price, and euery drop therof sufficient to ctncell the sinnes of the whole world. The reasons of this coniunction are these three.
                        First, That penall workes of Saints as they are satisfactory, be not without fruit, for being satisfactory, and not hauing the effect of satisfaction in their owne innocent &amp; vndefiled persons, they wilbe without this fruit and effect, except they be applyed vnto others that are poore and needy, in whome satisfaction is scant, and the debt of temporall payne abounds.
                        The second is, The glory of Christ, whose meritts were so powerfull, as to purchase to the church of God, such excellent &amp; admirable Saints, so pure of life, so feruent in pennance, as their satisfactions might suffice to pay the debt of temporall payne due vnto others.
                        The third reason is, to make men loue the Church and society of Saints, wherby they come to be partakers of the aboundā
                           cy of her treasures to pay their grieuous debts. This is that comfortable Article of the Apostles put downe in the Creed to be knowne of euery one: The Communiō of Saints. This is that which made King Dauid exult, saying 
                              Psal. 118. vers. 63.: I am partaker with all them that feare thee, &amp; keepe thy Cōmaundments. And in this respect the Apostle exhorteth

                           
                              〈1 page duplicate〉
                           
                           
                           
                              〈1 page duplicate〉
                           
                           
vs: 
                              Coloss. 1. v. 12. 
                           Gratias agamus Deo Patri qui dignos nos fecit in partem sortis Sanctorum in lumine. This is that which the same Apostle writes to the Corinthians 1.8.14. exhorting them to be liberall towards Titus and Luke: For the present let your aboundance (in temporall goods) supply their want, that also their aboundance (in pious works) may be a supplement vnto your want. This hope, to supply in this kind the spirituall need of Christians by the aboundance of his sufferings, made Saint Paul so much reioyce in them 
                              Coloss. 1.24.
                           : I ioye (sayth he) in my sufferings for you, and I make full the things that want of the sufferings of Christ in my flesh, for his body which is the Church. And agayne: 
                              2. Cor. 12.15. 
                           Cupio impendi &amp; superimpendi pro vobis: Out of which words 
                              Origen. hom. 10. in Num.
                            Origen gathers, that S. Paul, as a kind of victime or sacrifice did expiate the sinns of others; not satisfying for the Iniury agaynst God, nor for the eternall punishment due, but for one outward and transitory effect of sinne, to wit, the debt of temporall payne. In this sense also Saint Augustine interpreteth the former words of the Apostle, of suffering in his body the things wanting of the sufferings of Christ: 
                              Aug. in ep. 61. 
                           Patitur Christus in membris suis, id est, in nobis ipsis ad communem hanc quasi Republicam. Nam quis
                                 
                                    
                                 
                                 que
                               pro modulo nostro exoluimus quod debemus, &amp; pro posse virium nostrarum quasi canonem passionum inferimus paratoriâ plenariâ. Christ suffereth in his members, that is,

euen in vs, as for a Cōmonwealth: for euery one of vs payeth his owne debt, according to his meane power, &amp; according to his forces puts into the plenary Storehouse a certayne measure of sufferings.
                        This was the practise of the Primitiue Church, which at the petition of constant Confessours in prison, did relieue the penaltyes that sinners were enioyned to performe, to satisfy not only the discipline of the Church, but also the wrath of God after the remission of sinne still continuing vnto the infliction of temporall payne, as appeareth by the testimonyes of 
                              Cypr. l. 3. ep. 15. Saint Cyprian. And that this relaxation of temporall payne was done by applying the aboū
                           dant satisfaction of holy Confessours and designed Martyrs vnto the Penitents, that receaued Indulgence at their intercessions, appeares by Tertullian; For he falling from the Church into the errours of Montanus, whereof one was, That for Christians sinning after Baptisme there was no remission of sinne, refutes the Catholike custome of remitting penaltyes vnto sinners for the merits of Martyrs, speaking thus 
                              Tertul. lib. de pudicit. cap. 22.
                           : Let it suffice the Martyrs, they haue cancelled &amp; satisfied for their own sins. It is ingratitude, or pride for one prodigally to cast abroad vpō others, that which as a great benefit was bestowed vpon him. And speaking vnto the Martyr he sayth: If thou be a sinner, how can the oyle of thy Lampe suffice both for thee, and me? By which hereticall

Impugnation appeares, that the Catholike doctrine then was, that men might satisfy one for another, and that the aboū
                           dant satisfactions of some that suffered exceedingly as Martyrs, were applyed for the redemption of some others more remisse and negligent,
                              MINISTER pa. 554. It is remarkable how the Romā Higlars with one breath, both magnify, &amp; debase the price of Christs bloud. For one while they say, That one drop thereof is sufficient to sasisfy for all the sinnes of the world; and then agayne they inferre, That it is fit it should be eeked out with an addition of Saintly satisfactiōs, to raise a stocke to redeeme soules out of Purgatory. Else why stint they not this treasure vpon the mayne Reuenew of Christs Passions only? Their detected meaning is: Christs Bloud alone is all-sufficient to saue soules; but the same is insufficient to impregnate his Holinesse his Coffers. The bloud of Christ hath abundant vertue in it to cleanse sinnes, but it must emendicate vertue to fill purses, and to satisfy the Auarice of the Horse-leeches of Rome.

The Angell sayd vnto Iacob, in commendation of his constancy, thou hast been strong against God, how much more wilt thou preuayle agaynst men? and I may say of you in excusation of your rayling at vs, What wōder though you spare not Christs Vicar on earth, who in your ignorant zeale about this matter, rayle and blaspheme euen God himselfe? For thus you write in the precedent pag. 553. If the Bloud of Christ be infinit, it is foolish to ioyne to the same the Bloud of Martyrs &amp; passions of Creatures. Is any man so foolish as to add the light of a candle to the cleere light of the Sunne? Thus you. Is not this Blasphemy agaynst God? For hence I thus argue. He that ioyneth the bloud of Martyrs and passions of Creatures to the infinit price of Christs bloud, is a foole by your censure. God, that men may attaine vnto heauen, doth to the infinite merit of Christs bloud, ioine the passions of Martyrs &amp; of creatures, saying vnto men, that except they suffer with Christ, they shall not be glorifyed with him. Rom 8.17. What followeth of this your saying, but the most horrible blasphemy that may be, that God is like a foole which ioyneth the light of a Candle with the light of the Sunne? Hence your calumniation of the Roman Church is detected, the folly wherewith you charge her, being the very same wherwith you charge God. For as the ioyning of Saynts workes and sufferings to the merits of Christ, for the full purchasing of heauen, is not eeking out of his merits by addition vnto them, but to performe the conditions which God requires, that the merits of Christ may haue their effects: So to ioyne to the satisfactions of Christ, the satisfactions and  mortifications done by Saynts, for the abolishing of the debt of Temporal payne, is not to eeke out the price of his bloud with addition, but to comply with Gods will and pleasure, who wil haue vs to be cleansed from the reserued temporall guilt of payne, not only by Christs satisfactions and mortifications, but also by our owne, as Scriptures and Fathers teach.
                              Besides Catholicks teach, as you may see in Suarez, Tom. 4. in 3. p. disp. 51. sect. 4. conclus. 3. That the superaboundant satisfactions of our Sauiour is a sufficient and infinite stocke &amp; reuenew, out of which the Pope may grant Indulgences ordinarily and without any stint, though there be not any saintly satisfactions remayning in the treasury of the Church, [Sola satisfactio Christi esset sufficiens ad indulgentiarum efficaciam, etiam secundum legem ordinariam] Whence two things are consequent. First, that the Minister belyeth the Church in saying, that we ioyne to Christs bloud the satisfactions of Saints to impregnate his Holynes his coffers, as being persuaded that Christs bloud alone is not sufficient for this end. For if selling and buyng of Indulgences were lawfull (as it is detested in our Church, and acccursed as a most horrible and damnable crime, Concil. Lateran. sub Inno. 3. &amp; Vienn. sub Clem. 5.) If I say we held it were lawful for the Pope to enrich his coffers by the sale of pardons, according to our Tenet, the Pope might fill his purse &amp; coffers by selling Indulgēces out of the Treasury of Christs passions only, they being infinite and vnexhaust. Secondly, The Ministers so often repeated assertion, that the Doctrine of Indulgences is vsed vnto filthy lucre, is a mere Ministeriall slaūder. For the Minister is no more to be belieued in saying, that by this doctrine the Pope filleth his Coffers, then in his saying, That he doth for this end teach that Saintly satisfactions must be ioyned vnto Christs, as iudging Christs insufficient to impregnate his Coffers. But this is a manifest slaunder, seing the Pope holds that the price of Christs bloud is infinite, out of which infinit Indulgences might ordinarily be giuen, and also sold to enrich his coffers if that practise were law full. Therefore, a most false an impudent slaunder it is what the Minister here so often repeates, that the Doctrine of the treasure of Saynts superaboundant satisfactions, is deuised by Roman Prelats for filthy lucre.

Against the Iesuits propositiō, that Merits of Saints are layd vp in the memory of God, to be rewarded in due tyme with glory, but redundant satisfactions be reserued in the treasury of the Church, thus rayleth: By this you may see that Popery is a mistery, Apoc. 17.5. And the Canonists say of the Pope, His will is a reason &amp;c. otherwise there is the same reason for cōmunication  of merits, as for satisfactions. For in Christ Iesus both were communicated al

                                    ke, and Christ is the samplar of saintly merit &amp; satisfaction, if there be any. Answere. Vnto men altogeather ignorant of Theology, the knowne principles &amp; truths therof seeme mysteryes, and strange thinges, in which number you are. For otherwise the learned know a manifest reason, why the satisfactions of Saynts be communicable, and not their merits, and the disparity betwixt them, and Christ Iesus in this behalfe. Christ Iesus being by na
                                 
                                    •
                                 ure the Sonne of God, is not only free from sinne, but also his soule in the moment of his Conception was aduanced vnto the highest degree of glory and beatificall vision any soule can possibly attayne vnto. Hence his works, not only as satisfactory for sinne, haue not effect in his person by nature impeccable, but also as meritorious of glory they superabound in respect of his soule, which independently of workes is erected vnto the highest degree of glory. Hence also his works being not only as satisfactions. but also as merits superfluous in respect of himselfe, be communicable vnto other, not only as satisfactory for their sinnes, but also as meritorious of glory for them. In the Saynts liuing vpon earth it is not so: For they be not in glory, nor can they in this life be so perfect, but they may merit still more &amp; more glory; and as they merit more and more, so their reward is greater and greater. Hence their workes as meritorious of heauen, can neuer be superfluous, nor without the effect of a full and condigne reward in their owne persons; whereby it cometh also to passe, that nothing of their merits superabounds to be communicated vnto others. But of their workes as satisfactory for Temporall reserued payne, there is not the same reason. For some Saints may be preserued by speciall grace from al actual sinne, as the Blessed Virgin was, or from any greuous sinne, as was S. Iohn Baptist: Others though they committed some mortall sinnes, when they repent, the penalty reserued after the remission thereof, being finit &amp; temporall, they may by voluntary assumption, or diuine infliction endure more payne then is the reserued. Hence Saynts may haue satisfaction which superaboūds, that is, which hath not the reward of remission of temporall payne in their owne persons, and consequently satisfactions that be communicable vnto others, though the merit of their workes be still proper to themselues and incommunicable. If the Minister will continue his rayling agaynst this reason, he may, but I doe not doubt, could he deliuer reasons for his Protestant Doctrine so drawne out of the bowells and principles of Christian Theology as this is, he would not rayle so much as he doth, but yield his Reader some learned  discourses, in lieu of so many bitter inuectiues.
                              Minister pag. 555. Though the superabundant satisfactions want the proper fruite and reward of satisfaction, yet this (being recompensed by a large increase and surplasage in an other kind) can be no dishonour to God. As prayer though sometimes the same want the most proper fruite and effect thereof, which is to obtayne the thinge requested, yet is the same otherwise sufficiently rewarded. ANSWERE. Your Example makes agaynst your selfe, for pious and Godly prayer being both meritorious of heauen, and impetratory of what is requested, neuer wants eyther of these two fruites. For as it doth still merit new increase of glory, so doth it still obtayne the thinge requested so farre as it is requested; for the thinge is requested by Godly prayer so farre as it is profitable for the soule according to Gods holy will, but so farre it is still impetrated. And if the particular thinge requested be not for the soules greater good, another thing is obtained in lieu therof that is better. Hence I thus argue: You grant, if there be superabondant satisfactions of Saynts, the same must be rewarded by the proper fruite of satisfaction, as much as prayer hath still the reward of impetration. But prayer is still rewarded with the fruite of impetration, eyther in the person of him that prayeth, or in some other person for which it is offered. Ergo, the superaboundant satisfactions of Saints, must haue the reward of satisfactiō; which seing they cannot haue in their persons, they must haue it in some other partyes, to whome it is applyed.
                              The Minister pag. 556. If one should affirme, It is more for Christs glory to purchase to himselfe a people which in this life is perfectly innocent, then to purchase a people carrying alwayes about them the remaynder of sinne; he should not honour Christ but proue himselfe a lyer, 1. Iohn 1.8. so likewise to affirme, It is a greater honour to Christs merits to purchase Saynts that can make condigne and superabondant satisfaction for their sinnes, carryeth a shew of honouring Christ, but is in truth a Sacrilegious errour. Answere. First the power and strength of the Diuine grace is better seen in infirmityes, and in men compassed about with the remaynders and incombrances of sinne, as S. Paul sayth 2. Cor. 12.9. and S. Augustine, That the grace of Innocency was felicior, but the grace of redemption is fortior. [de Corr. &amp; grat. c. 11.] Secondly, 
                                    •
                                 f Christ did purchase to himselfe some excellent Saynts that did make condigne satisfactions, this is an honour to his merits: But the Scripture and Fathers affirme that he hath purchased to himselfe Saynts, that can, and do offer vnto God condigne fruites, and works of pennance, satisfactions, compensations, Sacrifices of iustice, pennance equall &amp; commeasured vnto the quantity of the sinne, in respect of the   reserued debt of Temporall payne, as hath been shewed: yea that Saynts by their works obtaine a crowne of glory, so as God giueth it them proceeding as a iust iudge 2. Tim. 4.8. Ergo, this is an honour to Christ in truth▪ and to say it is a Sacrilegious errour, is blasphemy.
                              The Minister pag. 357. The Communion of Saynts in respect of the liuing, is compartnership in fayth &amp;c. Answere. The word of the Creed, Communion of Saynts, is absolute without restraynt, not to be limited by the brayne &amp; fancy of a Minister. Hence it imports, that betweene Saynts there is a Communion of all graces and perfections which superabound in the one, and are needed of the other. But good workes according as they are satisfactiōs, superaboūd in some Saynts, &amp; are needed of some other, as hath been shewed. Therfore, betweene Saynts there is Communion in respect of them.
                              The Minister pag. 558. Dauid was a man full of grace according to the hart of God &amp;c. and so did not need the superabondant satisfactions of others▪ 
                                 Wherefore in respect of this Communion he did not reioyce, saying, Psal. 118. I am, O Lord, partaker of all that feare thee. Answer. Suppose Dauid did not need the satisfaction of other Saynts, yet he might reioyce in that he was a member of the house of Saints, who may participate of the superaboundāt satisfactions of others, if they need them, &amp; that he did not need them he knew not certaynly after he had committed the two enormous sinns.
                              To the place of S. Paul (1. Coloss. 22.) I ioy in my sufferings for you, and I make full the thinges that want of the sufferings of Christs in my flesh, for his Body which is the Church. The Minister pag. 559. Christs passions are of two kinds, some personall and in his owne flesh, some by simpathy and compassion of others. The first are satisfactory, and S. Paul supplyed not, or perfected not them, for then Christs sufferings were imperfect. The second are Exemplare, Purgatiue, Probatiue, and for the edifying of the Church, these S. Paul did accomplish and supply. Answere. To shew the weakenesse of your Reply I aske, whether Christs sufferings on the Crosse as exāples were imperfect or not? If you say they were imperfect, &amp; perfectible by Creatures, you blaspheme: &amp; also you may as truly say, his satisfaction was imperfect and suppliable by the addition of Saints. If you say, his sufferings, as examples, were perfect and full, &amp; yet were supplyed by Saint Paul, why may not the same sufferings, as satisfactions, be supplyed by S. Paul, without being imperfect? For Saint Paul is sayd to supply the sufferings of Christ as satisfactory, not because they were not of infinit value, but because God will haue the satisfactions of his seruants to be ioyned with Christs, that Christs may haue their full effect, euen to the cancelling of the debt of temporall payne.
                              
                                  Minister pag. 564. The indulgences Tertullian opposed were the same whereof S. Cyprian speaketh, Epist. 10.11.12. to wit, relaxation of Canonicall censures and pennances to notorious sinners, at the request of martyrs liuing in prison. Answere. It is true, Tertullian being an Heretike, opposed such indulgences as S. Cyprian doth mention, as allowed in the Catholike Church. But that these indulgences were only relaxations of Canonicall pennances &amp; censures, you say, but shew not; yea that the pennances released were required in foro conscientiae, to satisfy Gods anger, appeareth by S. Cyprian his words in that tenth Epistle by you mentioned, Deo patri misericordi satisfacere pro delictis suis poenitentiam agentes possunt. And that penitents to make this full satisfaction vnto God, and so obtayne pardon, were holpen by the suffrages of Martyrs, the same Saint Cyprian doth affirme, Epist. 13. They who haue receaued bills from the Martyrs, to be released of their Pennance, may by the PREROGATIVE OF MARTYRS BE HOLPEN WITH GOD. And Epist. 14. They who bring the Bills from the Martyrs, may by THEIR HELP BE AYDED IN THEIR SINNES. This Catholike practise, of pardoning vnto Penitents the reserued temporall penalty by the application of Martyrs suffrages &amp; satisfactions, to haue byn impugned by Tertullian, in his heresy, is manifest by his making the Penitent in an heretical humour, to say to the Martyr who applyed his satisfaction for his pardon: If thou be a sinner, thou needest satisfaction and pardon thy selfe; How then can thine oyle of satisfaction be sufficient both for thee and me? Also the Martyrs, that sued for pardon to be giuen to the penitents, he accuseth of Prodigality therin, which is a signe that Martyrs bestowed something that was their owne vpon penitents, that they by vertue thereof might be pardoned; which cannot be any thing besides their own sufferings, according as they were satisfactory for sinne.
                              Minister pag. 565. The aduersary is so farre from being able to proue Popes pardons in Tertullians dayes, That he cānot proue they had any being in the dayes of Peter Lombard, or Hugo Victor. Answere. Still you shew your selfe to be a bold affirmer about things you know not. For what more euidēt falshood then this you vent, That Indulgences had not any being in the dayes of Peter Lombard? The Waldensian Sect was in being in the dayes of Peter Lombard, (as doth witnesse Illyricus in catalog. Test. colum. 1498.) and they (as the same Illyricus doth record ibid. colum. 1501. &amp; 1511.) contemned and derided the indulgences of the Church, which they would not haue done, but that they saw the same had some being and vse then in the Church. Pope Paschall the 2. some yeares before Peter Lombard, graunted the Indulgences  of 40. dayes to all that were present at the Lateran Generall Councell kept in his tyme, as writeth Vrspergens. Chron. an. 1106. Vrban the second, in the yeare 1096. before Peter Lombard was borne, in the Generall Councell of Cleremont in France, graunted a Plenary Indulgence vnto al that should go to fight for the recouery of the Holy Land: yea Leo the third, almost foure hundred yeares before Peter Lombard, to wit eight hundred yeares agoe (as writes S. Lutgerus in vita Sancti Switberti c. 9.) did at the request of Charles the Great dedicate the temple of our Blessed Lady of Aquisgra
                                       •
                                    e donans eam multis indulgentijs, bestowing many Indulgences vpon it. Moreouer: The Pope (sayth he) in France consecrated many Churches euery where graunting many indulgences. And agayne: The Pope graunted speciall Indulgences vnto the sayd Church for all the faythfull, that should keep the feast of Saint Switbert, and come on his day to heare diuine seruice. Behold how frequent and ordinary a thing it was eight hundred yeares agoe, for the Pope to giue out Indulgences, which you say had not any being in the dayes of Peter Lombard. Not only S. Thomas, &amp; many Catholikes write, that Saint Gregory the Great before the yeare six hundred, graunted Indulgences, but also Protestants, as Fryar Bale Act. Rom. Pontif. printed at Basil Anno 1558. Gregory (sayth he) did confirme the deuotion of people in visiting images, by granting them indulgences. And agayne: He was the first Pope that did grant Indulgences vnto thē that should vpon certayne dayes visit Churches. And though we cannot directly proue that such generall Indulgences for all the faithfull, were vsed before Saint Gregory, yet it is not probable that holy Pope would vse it without the example of his predecessors; yea had this practise been then nouell the same would haue been noted. But whensoeuer the vse of such Indulgences began, certayne it is, that Personall Indulgences graunted vnto particular persons, vpon particular examination of their cause, were euer in vse since the Apostles tyme, as doth appeare by the former testimony of S. Cyprian &amp; Tertullian.
                              Minister pag. 566. The holy Scripture teacheth expressely, that all spirituall redemption is immediatly wrought by the bloud of Christ, who purged sinne by himselfe, Hebr. 1.3. But our Aduersaryes restrayne this, and the like place, to the stayne and eternall guilt of sin, saying, that the guilt of temporall payne is redeemed by Christ only mediatly, by the satisfaction of Saynts. Which is agaynst the Apostle, Coloss. 2.12. affirming, that Christ blotted out the handwriting of decrees (contayned in the Law) that was agaynst vs, and that by himselfe; but the temporary punishment is contayned within the latitude of the law. Leuit. 26.14. Answere. You do not vnderstand the Doctrine of your Aduersaryes, or else wittingly misrelate the  same. For Catholikes distinguish the merit of Christs redemption, and the conditions by meanes of which, the same is applyed vnto particular persons. All spirituall guifts of this life &amp; of the future, all remissions of sinne eyther mortall or veniall, all releasement of punishment eyther eternall or temporall, is wrought by way of redemption immediatly, &amp; only by the bloud &amp; Passion of our Sauiour. But the condition which God requireth, that the same be applyed vnto particular persons, is not only the suffering of Christ, nor is the same kind of condition required in respect of euery grace. Some be giuen vpon condition of meere mercy, some not otherwise then according to mens works. The guift of iustifying grace is applyed vnto men by the vertue of Sacramtts through Gods only mercy, the sinner by fayth, pennance, and contrition disposing his soule for the reception thereof. But the grace and guift of eternall life, purchased by Christ his bloud, is not applyed vnto men through Gods only mercy, but by merit of Good workes, done by the power of grace; by workes I say, so good and gracious, as God may according to them giue eternall life, as a crowne, proceeding as a iust Iudge, as the Scripture teacheth 2. Tim. 4.8. and in a thousand other places.
                              In the same manner, the remission of the stayne of mortall sinne &amp; of the eternall guilt, purchased by the death of Christ, is applyed vnto particular persons by meere grace, by vertue of the Sacraments, and the sinners humble preparation to receaue the same. But the releasement of Tē
                                 porall punishment reserued, is not giuen of meere mercy, but penitents being now Gods Children, after the gracious pardon of the sinne &amp; eternall guilt, must, to obtaine full remission, do fructus dignos poenitentiae, Matth. 3.8. Luc. 3.8. condigne workes of pennance, satisfactions, compensations iust, worthy, condigne, equall vnto the quantity of the reserued sinne, or penalty, as hath been proued by the Fathers. Hence, as eternall Glory though it be an effect of Christs merits only, yet is it not giuē but vnto such works as God may as a iust Iudge reward therewith; so likewise, remissiō of Temporal payne though purchased immediatly by the merits of Christ only, yet is not applyed vnto the penitent Saynts, without satisfaction equall &amp; condigne, eyther done by the penitent himselfe, or applyed vnto him out of the superabundant satisfactions of others, by the vertue of Communion of Saynts.
                              
                              Minister pag. 567.
                                 Daniel a sanctifyed person &amp; a Prophet, able to communicate his satisfactions, praying for the remission of the eternall and temporall guilt of sin, presents not his owne satisfactions to God, nor yet the super abundant merits and satisfactions of any Patriarkes,  but resteth wholly vpon the free mercy of God, and the future satisfafactions of the Messias to come, Daniel. 9.7. Answere. First, your argument, Daniel in this prayer did not offer vnto God the superabundant satisfactions of Saynts, Ergo they may not be offered, is idle.
For though there be superabundant satisfactions of Saynts, yet it is not necessary that in euery prayer we obsecrate God by them. Secondly, you cannot proue that Daniel did not offer superabundant Saintly satisfactions. If you say the Scripture doth not mention any such oblation, and therfore he made no such oblation, your argumēt is reproued by your own assertion. Your selfe say that Daniel did obsecrate God, not only by his mercies, but also by the future satisfaction of the Messias to come, and yet these future satisfactions be not mentioned by the Scripture as any part of his prayer, but only Gods mercyes, not for our owne righteousnes, but for thy great mercyes. Why then may not we say, Daniel alleadged the superabundant satisfactions of Saynts, though the Scripture make not mention that he did? Thirdly, no doubt Daniell was of the same Religion that the three Children his companions were, who praying for the remission of their sinnes, and of their whole people, offered vnto God the merits of the Patriarkes, saying; For Abraham thy beloued, for Isaac thy seruant, for Israel thine holy One. (Daniel 3.35.)
                              The Minister pag 567. lin. 23. being angry at the Iesuit that he doth so sleight the Protestant arguments in this poynt, sayth: If the Iesuit be so rigide as to admit no argument on our part which may receaue any colourable answer, I intreate him to deliuer so much as one probable Argument (I will not require a Demonstration) that the Roman Bishops haue power ouer the soules of Purgatory. Answer. When you shal find in the Iesuits writings that the Pope hath power ouer the soules of Purgatory, or can by way of authority dispose of thē, I wil promise you that he shal bring ten thousand demōstrations in proofe thereof. The meane while the world may see your vanity &amp; desire to delude them. You know that the Iesuit can bring euident proofes, for euery point of his Religion, and therfore you charge him to prooue, what is no part of his fayth, &amp; to bring probable arguments for that doctrine which he doth not hold as probable, to wit, that the Pope can by way of power and authority deliuer soules out of Purgatory.
                              The Pope by the power of his Keyes, may grant pardon vnto the liuing, out of the treasury of Christ his satisfaction, and the satisfactions of the liuing may be applyed to releeue the dead, as the Fathers most cleerly and vniformely teach. But the Keyes of Peter, can only bind and loose vpon earth, and absolue from sinne and penalty the liuing. Ministers when  they dispute with Catholikes, be like vnto a man that sitteth on thornes, so pricked and vrged with the euidencyes of the present argumēts, as they would fayne be remoouing to some other Controuersy they care not to what. Thus you, in this place, are so galled to see your vanity displayed by the Iesuit, as you wish your selfe euen in Purgatory to be rid of the Iesuits vrging. (pag. 563. lin. 23.) I dare say had his Maiesty proposed the question, Whether some soules be purged by Temporall payne after this life, their state being releeuable by the suffrages of the liuing; the Iesuit would haue so scorched your Infidelity with the cleere testimonyes of Scriptures and Fathers, as you would haue runne as fast from Purgatory, as you now would fayne be in it. Whether the Pope haue authority in Purgatory or no, you need not greatly care, being sure, belieuing as you do, neuer to come thither, nor after death, within the precincts of Peters Dominion, who beares the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen. No doubt you are to fall into a lower place, except you repent of that heauy sinne so cleerly discouered in this your Reply, to impugne known truths, &amp; to falsify our Authors of purpose, to make the doctrine of the Church seeme odious. Of which damnable and hardly remissible crime, I beseech sweet Iesus of his infinit mercy to giue you grace to be purged in this present life, that so there may be some hope you may be saued, at the least by Purgatory in the next.
                            not for eternall, but only temporall Punishment. 
                              The Ministers rayling Arguments, against the former doctrine, censured.
                           
                        
                        
                            I shall not need particularly to refell the vulgar obiections agaynst this doctrine, all which proceed vpon mistaking, &amp; impugne what we neuer dreamed off. They proue that Christ only dyed for the world, and redeemed mankind, &amp; not any Saint: who doubts thereof? That we are sanctifyed and washed from the stayne of sinne by the bloud of the Lambe, not of any Saint. We confesse it. They bring the testimonyes of Saint Leo &amp; of Saint Augustine, that the Saints receaued Crownes of God, gaue not Crownes vnto others, but only Christ: we neuer did, nor will deny it. That only in Christ we dye to sinne, &amp; are raysed agayne soule and body vnto eternall life; we neuer taught the Contrary: For the satisfaction of Saints haue not vertue to redeeme the world, nor to satisfy for the guilt of sinne, nor to take men out of the power of darkenes, nor to iustify soules by infusion of grace, nor to purchase for men Crownes of glory, nor to rayse men from life to death; But only they are auaylable vnto one transitory effect, which men

might (were they feruent) obtayne by their owne industry, ioyned with diuine grace, to wit, the Remission of temporall payne; which vertue also comes from the meritts of Christ, and his most pretious bloud, in, and by the satisfactions of Saints applyed to worke the aforesayd temporall releasement: from which temporall seruitude, the Children of God, may through his gracious assistance, by good works redeeme themselues, or by satisfactions of their fellow-Cittyzens &amp; Saints be redeemed, though this temporary Redemption compared with the redemption of Christ, deserues not that tytle.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     THE NINTH POINT
                     
                        The opiniō of deposing Kings, &amp; giuing avvay their Kingdoms by Papall povver, vvhether directly, or indirectly.
                     
                     
                        THIS Controuersy was not handled by the Iesuite, for the Reasons deliuered in the Preface; nor is there any new cause giuen

to speake in confirmation of our doctrine, the Minister not hauing brought agaynst the same any Argumēt. His whole drift in this Point is to slaunder Iesuits, to cauill &amp; sicophantize, which being his naturall Talent, now ready to conclude, he is more sharpe therin, as Motion according to Nature is still more vehement towardes the end. I will set downe and briefly examine what he saith, reducing all to fiue Assaults, in which the Reader shall see his Boldnes in vttering, and Weakenes in prouing the most odious slaunders, that may be vented by splene and malice.
                     
                        The Ministers fond Cauill, That Iesuites honour not the King, as Soueraygne.
                        FIRST, wheras the Iesuit sayth; Regall &amp; Papall, be two powers instituted of God, both soueraygne and supreme ech in his kind, both Venerable and Honoured by me in the inmost affections of soule; after the triuiall trish-trash of a thousand tymes confuted obiections, agaynst the Popes spirituall Supremacy, thus you write pag. 570. in fine. Your Protestation, that you honour Regall and Papall Dignity, must be vnderstood Iesuitically, with mentall limitation, to wit, that you honour the Pope as an earthly God, yea so farre, as that if he lead you to Hell, yea are ready to follow him. distinct. 40. can. Si Papa. But you honour the King as the Popes Vassall. Matth. Paris. in Henr. 3. pag. 844. Nonne Rex Anglorum noster est Vassallus?
                        
                        This is your first Assault, so strong, as if bold slaundering, and idle arguing may winne the field, the day must be yours. You lay two crimes to the Iesuits charge. First, that he is ready to obey and follow the Pope though the Pope lead him to Hell. Can any Censure be more vnchristian? The Iesuits suffering persecution for his Religion, may conuince any reasonable man that he is not so desperate, as to runne for any mans pleasure wittingly to Hell; nor were he so mad, is he such a

foole, as to goe thither disgraced and persecuted with the Pope. Were he so minded, he would rather go agaynst his conscience to please the King, whereby he might perchance get a Deanery, or some rich Benefice, and so goe to Hell with Wife, Children, Seruants, worldly Contents, merily as you doe.
                        But what strong reason haue you to iudge so strangely of the Iesuit? Marry, The Canon Si Papa d. 40. sayth, If the Pope by being of bad life, &amp; negligent in his office, drawe thousands to hell, yet let no man presume to correct him (to wit iuridically, by deposing him) except also he do deuiate from the Fayth. This is the Canon; which supposed, your discourse hath this force and forme. The Iesuit receaues the Canon Si Papa: But the Canon Si Papa sayth, the Pope (not being an Heretike) may not be deposed for scandalous life, though he lead by his example thousands to hell: Ergo, the Iesuit is ready to follow and obey the Pope, though he lead him to Hell. It is hard to say, whether your iudging be more voyd of Charity, or your arguing of Reason. I perceaue, if we feare your censuring, we must not mantayne, that the King is not to be deposed for scandalous life, though he lead thousands to Hell: For if we doe, you will thence conclude, that we are desperate, and ready to follow and obey the King, though he lead vs to hell: So wise a disputant and Censurer you are.
                        But let vs heare your second crimination, and your proofe thereof. The Iesuit sayth, I honour Regall Power, as in his kind Supreme and Soueraigne: that is, (say you) as the Popes Vassall. A goodly Comment vpon the Iesuits Text; what warrant haue you so to expound? Forsooth, Matthew Paris writes, that Pope Innocent the third sayd of our King Henry the third, Is not the King of England our Vassall? What is this to the Iesuit? Is he bound to belieue euery tale of Matthew Paris his writing? Though had you any skil in Histories you might know, that the Pope sayd so of that King, not because he thought that Kings be by diuine Institution his Vassals in temporall Affayres, but because that King had done vnto him voluntary Homage for his Kingdome. For this Henry the third, was Son of our King Iohn, who gaue his Kingdome in vassalladge vnto this Pope Innocent, to protect the same from the incursion of the French, as he did. Hence at his Coronation being thē in his Non-age, sayth Matthew Paris, fecit homagium Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae, &amp; Innocentio Papae, he did homage to the holy Romā Church, and vnto Pope Innocent. After ward comming to riper age, in the 29. yeare of his Raigne, he sent an Embassadge of foure Noble men, togeather with his Attourney William Powicke, to the Councell of Lyons,
                           
and vnto Pope Innocent the 4. to contradict the sayd donation of his Father, alleadging many reasons, (sayth Walsingam Ypodigm. Neust. Anno 1245.) that the King could not make his Realme Vassall vnto any, without the full consent thereof. The Pope answered, Rem indigere morosa consideratione, &amp; so the matter rested. Now I pray you consider, how fond, &amp; far fetcht your Discourse is. Pope Innocent (as Matthew Paris reports) foure hundred yeares agoe, sayd of a King that had done voluntary homage vnto him, He is our Vassall: Ergo the Iesuit doth not honour the King, as Soueraigne in his kind: Or, Ergo, his saying, I honour the King as Soueraigne, is to be vnderstood, as the Popes Vassall?
                        
                     
                     
                        The Minister his fond proofes of his Slaunder, that Iesuits hold singular Opinions to the preiudice of Kings.
                        YOVR second Assault, is to proue that Iesuits hold peculiar opinions preiudiciall vnto Regall authority, which no other Catholicks but themselues mantayne. This you proue by six Arguments, so seely and fond, as no man would haue mentioned them to this purpose, but only your selfe.
                        First, Iesuits (say you pag. 573.) are taxed, and censured by many of their owne Part for singularity of opinions. This is your Argumēt in so many words. I pray you if any Doctrines▪ preiudiciall vnto Princes, be singular vnto Iesuits, that is, held by the consent of Iesuits, and by Iesuits only, why do you not name these opinions what they are? Why do you dwell vpon generalyties, according to the custome of cosening Companions, Dolosus versatur in Generalibus? Why, but because you know, that descending vnto particulars, your falshood would presently be displaied? Hence you talke in the ayre, and in effect thus you discourse. I know there be certayne opinions mayntayned singularly by Iesuits agaynst Royall Soueraignety, what they are I doe not know. For they be written in bookes, as inuisible as was our Church before Luther, no where to be found, but in the Globe of the Moone, and are no wayes to be read, but by the light therof.
                        The opinion for which some Catholicks at whome you glance (as appeares by your margent) haue taxed Iesuits of singularity is, that God hath assured Prescience of thinges contingent, not only of which shall in time actually happen, but also of what, vpon suppositions which neuer

were, might haue beene. For example God knoweth certaynly whether these conditionall propositions be true or false: If King Henry the eight had neuer seene Anne Bullen, England had been Catholicke at this day: If Queene Mary of Scotland had fled into France whē she came into England, shee had recouered her Kingdome agaynst the Rebells: If the miracles Christ did in Iewry had been done in Tyrus and Sidon, those Cityes would haue done pennance. This doctrine some Deuines mislike, and say the same was first inuented by Iesuits. Which if it be true, then haue Protestants done Iesuits wronge, that relate this very doctrine of Gods conditionall Prescience, as the doctrine of their Reformed Gospell. [Field of the Church l. 3. c. 23. pag. 122.] But, I pray you, what is this to your Scope? The doctrine, that God knowes the state of things conditionally contingent, what makes it agaynst the Soueraignty of Princes? Do you not see, you are ridiculous?
                        Secondly, If Iesuits be not singular in their doctrines, to the depression of Kings, wherefore was Iesuit Suarez his Booke, contra sectam Anglicanam, condemned at Paris in France, and burnt by the hand of the Hang-man? Answere. I likewise demand of you, if Iesuit Suarez his booke be preiudiciall to Princely authority, why is the same allowed in all other Catholicke kingdoms; so as the King by his sollicitations could not get the same to be condemned? Do not other kingdomes know the Catholike Extent of Royall Authority, zealously mantaining the Soueraignty therof? How can that doctrin be singular of Iesuits, vnto which Bishops, secular Doctours, and Religious of other Orders haue set their names by way of Approbation, as is to be seene in the beginning of that Treatise? And if your Argument be good, Iesuit Suarez his booke was in France burnt by the hand of the Hangman: Ergo, the Order of the Iesuits holds doctrine to the preiudice of Princes; surely this Argument is strong, and vnanswerable: Minister Paraeus his booke was in London publickly burnt by the hand of the Hangman, by Order of the Kinge, wherein no Papist had his hand: Ergo, the Protestant Ministry holds doctrines pernicious vnto the State of Princes.
                        The third Argument: Wherefore were Iesuits banished out of the Dominions of the Venetians, professing the Roman Fayth, if they are guilty of no singularity about the matter of Regall, and Ciuill Authority? Answere. Why are Iesuits permitted, desired, and sought for by all other Catholick Kingdomes, and States of the world, if they be guilty of singularity agaynst Regall, and Ciuil Authority? Should one dispute in this sort: Wherefore was Chrysostome [Socrat. l. 6. c. 26. &amp; alij.] banished out of the Catholicke Citty of

                           Constantinople by the Catholicke Emperour Arcadius, at the instance of the Catholicke Empresse, in a Councell of Catholicke Bishops, but that he was guilty of treason agaynst Royall Authority? What would a learned Answerer say? He would laugh at the Disputants folly, and tell him, that Kings and States may be put into displeasure and Passion against the Ministers of Gods holy Word, &amp; so banish them their Dominions, not only for singularity agaynst Ciuill Authority, but for other reasons, as for their ouer zealous inueighing agaynst vitious life, &amp; constant crossing of their disordinate humours. I could bring many examples of iust, &amp; holy men banished by Catholicks, yea by pious and godly Kings, and States vpon mistakings, suspitions, false informations. S. Athanasius, that mirrour of sanctity &amp; learning, vnto whome the Church of God is more beholding then to the whole world which then liued besides, was he not for suspitions about temporall Affayres, banished by Constantine the Great, the first Christian Emperour, the patterne of Religious Princes? [Ruffin. l. 1. c. 17.] God permits such trialls to fall on his Seruants for the exercise of their Patience, vntill time discouer the truth, which being sufficiently cleered, if men still remayne obdurate, his Iustice will not sleepe.
                        The fourth Argument. Mariana the Iesuits worke, de Institutione Principis, wherin he maintayneth Regicide, is extant in many hands. Answere. The example of Mariana proueth not, that Iesuits hold singular opinions agaynst others, but only that Mariana was singular agaynst the rest of his Order, which through the ouersight of Reuisors passed to the print. A thinge that may sometymes happen; which to preuent the Generall of the Iesuits gaue that seuere Order about reuiewing of Bookes in that kind, which the Iesuit hath set downe in his Answere. That Iesuit Mariana was singular agaynst the rest, appeares, in that he was confuted by name of some of his own Order for this doctrine, euen before the censure of Paris. [See the letter of Cotton.] And if you will allow, agaynst the common Prouerbe, One swallow makes not a Summer, that the errour of one be sufficient be condemne a whole Society, then the Minister Paraeus his Worke, wherein he mantaynes Deposition, and Regicide, must make all Ministers guilty, specially seing not one of them wrote agaynst Paraeus his booke, before the same was publickely burnt in London.
                        
                        Nor was Mariana his doctrine in the behalfe of the Popes, as you oftē ignorantly suppose, but of the Commōwealths Power agaynst Tyrants. A Doctrine which Iesuits condemne, but Protestants commonly follow. I could name twenty of their Authours, that peremptorily affirme what

                           Mariana did only doubtingly propose, yea much more. For do not Protestants teach [See the booke of Dangerous positions lib. 1. c. 4. &amp; l. 2. c. 1.] That Iudges ought by the law of God so summon Princes before them, for their crimes, and to proceed agaynst them, as agaynst all other offenders: That it is lawfull to kill wicked Kings and Tyrants: That God to the people hath giuen the sword, from which no person King, Queen, Emperour is exempt: Being an Idolater he must dy the death? An hundred the like Theorems of your Gospell and Gospellers, could I alleadge to stop your mouth, the opinion which Mariana did doubtfully insinuate being farre short of these horrible doctrines your Ministry doth resolutely define.
                        The fifth Argument. In this kingdome, the seditious and murtherous attempts of Campian, Persons, Garnet &amp;c. remayne to this houre in bleeding memory. Answere. The memory of your cruelty towardes Fa. Campian makes Christian harts bleed, that such barbarous Inhumanity should be vsed by men that beare the name of Christians. You condemned him who was a man (to say nothing more) ciuill, mild, courteous, and completely learned, Vir suauis &amp; politissimus [Cambd. Elizab. p. 209.] for meeting togeather with others to plot the Q death, vpon a day when they were a thousand miles asunder the one from the other, as it was there proued at the Barre. The Queen ashamed thereof, after his condemnation, would by no meanes permit his execution, but you by your importunity at last forced her to yield to the murthering of this Innocent Iesuit, as the Scribes &amp; Pharises wonne Pilate to deliuer vnto their bloudy pleasure our Sauiour Iesus, as your owne Historiographer doth testifye, Importunis precibus euicta permisit. [Camden. Elizab. pag. 326.] Out of this your Caluinian immense desire of innocent bloud, you neuer ceased to vent bloudy fables, and to father them vpon Father Persons, but neuer was, nor could any be proued agaynst him, nor agaynst Father Garnet, but barely the hearing in Confession of the barbarous attempt of others.
                        But suppose your Antecedēt were true about these three Iesuits, how foolish is your Inference? Some Iesuits haue gone about murtherous attempts: Ergo, The Order of the Iesuits mantayne singular opinions against Regall authority? If your argument be of good Consequence, then this is of necessary importance: Many Ministers haue been hanged in England for most bloudy, and barbarous murthers, yea commonly at the Assisses euery yeare some goe to preach from the Gallowes. Ergo, the English Ministry holds singular opinions about the lawfulnes of murther? Can you proue that one of the Society of Iesus, spread ouer the world,

was euer executed for any such crime by some Catholicke Prince? If you could, how would you insult?
                        So the vanity of your fifth Argument being apparent, let vs cōtemplate the solidity of your last. Lastly (say you) Iesuits heere among vs at this day be prime Oppugners &amp; Disswaders of the Oath of Allegiance, &amp; it woūdeth them to the gall, that secular Priests propugne the lawfullnes therof. Answer. That Oath contaynes not only Temporall Allegiance, which Iesuits are most willing to sweare, but also the Abnegation of the Catholicke Fayth, to wit, of the Authority giuen vnto Peter in the Gospell, deuolued by course to his successour. What you say, that Iesuits herein be singular, that secular Priests propugne the lawfullnes of this Oath; their writings, their deeds, their deaths testify the contrary. Which slaūder they would not let passe with silence, did they not know your word to be of no credit: yea by their experience of your Brother, they be well assured, that the venting of impudent falshoods comes to you by kind.
                     
                     
                        The Ministers fondnes in Cauilling at the Iesuits wordes, about the Temporall Soueraignity of Popes.
                        IN your third Assault, you vndertake to sift &amp; winnow, (as the Diuell doth Gods Elect) these wordes of the Iesuit, I disclayme from enlarging the Popes power ouer the Temporalityes of Princes by any singular opinion of mine, or more then the definitions of Councells, and consent of Deuines doth force mee to hold. Thus you pleade agaynst him pag. 174. Marke heere, You that shall reade this; A sly Foxe that would seeme a sheepe, and yet his tayle bewrayes him, 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              . Though a Iesuit can couch well when neede is, yet he sometymes breaketh out at vnawares. Doth his Maiesty suspect, or enquire whether the Iesuit hold an opinion different from his followes, and personall to himselfe? These wordes by any opinion of Mine, implyeth the Indiuiduall only; and so, if he haue but a few, yea any two, Mariana and Bosius, this may hold in Grammaticall sense. Thus you, thinking you haue shewed your selfe a witty Cauiller, and hoping for applause you call mens eyes vpon you with Marke heere. Indeed you haue played the Foxe, but that foolish Foxe, which (as I haue heard one relate that saw it) byting at an oyster that gaped, the oyster closing caught him by the tongue, by which tyed fast, he stood a spectacle of laughter: For let vs discusse the matter. You say the wordes of the Iesuit, By no singular opinions of mine, imply the Indiuidual only. Be it so, what harme

in that? Marry, the Foxes-tayle bewrayes him, the Iesuit hath broken out at vnawares. Into what hath he broken out? Forsooth, he sayth, he will not enlarge the Popes power by opinions personall to himselfe. Is this the Foxes-tayles whereof you cry to your Readers Marke heere? Verily, you deserue a flapp with a Foxe-tayle for your discouery thereof. Oh, but the King did not suspect the Iesuit of personall opinions in the behalfe of the Pope. Are you acquaynted with the Kings secret thoughts &amp; suspitions? Suppose he did not suspect, what treason was it to say, I will not by singular opinions enlarge Papall power? Yea, but this notwithstanding, he may enlarge the Popes power if some few ioyne with him. You that cry, Marke heere, do you not Marke that the Iesuit foresaw this Cauill, and to preuent the same sayd, by no singular opinions of Mine, nor more then the definition of Councells, or consent of Deuines shall force me to hold? Is the opinion of Mariana, and Bosius, or of some few Deuines agaynst the rest, the definition of Councells, and the consent of Deuines? Now are you not caught by the tongue? What more can you say to hyde your witlesse inuiting men to note the wittines of your Cauill with Marke heere? What may men Marke heere? If you were in the Iesuits case, you would not sticke to say, Not a Foxes-tayle in my speach, but an Asseshead in the Aduersaryes carping thereat.
                        But euen Popish Synods (say you) are not farre to seeke which haue exalted the Popes Temporall Soueraignty, as farre ouer Princes, as Heauen is aboue Earth? How proue you this? You say in the margent, Bellarminus contra Barclaium enumerat sex Synodos: Bellarmine numbreth six Synodes in his booke agaynst Barclay. Well, let him number twenty; what then? Doth Bellarmine say they make for the Popes Temporall Soueraignty? No, but that they proue the spirituall Soueraignty of Peter, deuolued by course to his present Successour; which not any Roman, or Christian Synode, but Christ Iesus himselfe exalted as high as Heauen, putting all thinges whatsoeuer vpon earth, vnder the same: To thee I will giue the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen, whatsoeuer thou shalt bind vpon earth, shall be bound in heauen; and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose vpon earth, shall be loosed in heauen. Matth. 16.
                        Yet agayne, your feeble wit would fayne second the strength of your malice agaynst the Iesuit. You say, Notwithstanding this Protestation he may defend the Popes Temporall Dominion, and so close in opinion with Pope Hilbebrand, and Boniface the eight, with Baronius, Bosius, Aluarus Pelagius, with Augustinus ab Ancona, with Panormitan, yea and with the Deuill himselfe. Answere. It is very hard for any sort of men to sticke closer to the Deuill, then you of Luthers generation; seeing, this your Sire sayth of himselfe, Noctu Diabolus

mihi accubare solet, propior etiam quàm mea Catharina. The Diuell lyes with me in the night, neerer vnto me thē euen my Kate. [Colloq. de lege &amp; Euangel. fol. 124. vel 158.] Your selues write of him, Lutherus à Diabolo doctus &amp; institutus Missam abrogauit: Luther taught, and instructed by the Diuell, did abrogate the Masse. [Hospin. Histor. Sacram. part. Altera. fol. 131.] Which History of his conuersion from the Masse by Diuellish Arguments, the same Luther hath written [Luther. Tom. 7. Wittemb. An. 1558. de Missa priuata &amp;c. fol. 228.] euen with his owne Protestant holy hand, wherewith also, as himselfe doth testify, he did eate more then a bushell of salt with this his Familiar. [Luther. Conc. in Domin. Reminiscere. Wittemberg. impress. An. 1523. fol. 19.] So that it is small discretion in you to scoffe at vs about closing in opinion with the Diuell.
                        
                        I adde, that the Reader may see your iests to be still as sottish as they are splenefull, if it be true, as it is most true, that Damones credunt &amp; contremiscunt [Iacob 2.19.] Diuels belieue the truth and tremble, it is no fault to close in opinion with the Diuell, but to close with the Diuell in lying, as you doe euen in this place. For Gregory the 7. and Boniface the 8. teach not that Popes haue Tēporall dominion or Soueraingty ouer the whole world, but only the power of the keyes, in which Authority is inuolued to vnloose all earthly bands, contrary vnto the Saluation of Soules.
                     
                     
                        The Ministers miserable Apology for Protestants.
                        YOVR fourth Assault, is agaynst the Iesuits saying, The Catholicke doctrine is not so preiudicial vnto States as is the Protestant, held both by Lutherans and Caluinists expressed in their writings, wherof we haue in this age but ouer euident and lamentable examples, to the World and your Maiesty not vnknowne. Thus you write pag. 577. Is the wit of a Iesuit growne so barren? Haue you no other euasion, but by recrimination, and that impertinent? For as concerning your Flim-flam of Protestants, both Lutherans and Caluinists, I Answere; His Maiesty hath obserued by longe experience, that it cannot enter into any true Protestants hart, vpon any occasion whatsoeuer to lift vp their heads against the Lords Annointed. Thus you. Where I might say with S. Augustine, O stultitia hominis cogitare se dictorem, &amp; neminem contradictorem! O the folly of a man, to say what he will, neuer thinking he shall be gaynsayd, and heare what he would not. For did you thinke men would ponder your sayings, and gaynsay them finding them false, could you speake such palpable vntruths as you doe? A true harted Protestāt cannot lift vp his head agaynst the Lords Annoynted vpon any occasion whatsoeuer.
                           
Marke the CANNOT of the Protestant Impeccability. They were wont to teach they could not keepe so much as one of the Diuine Commandements; now they are so holy, as a thought cannot enter into their hart to lift vp their heads agaynst the Diuine Precept of Honouring the Lords Annoynted.
                        In Logicke, as a patterne of a ridiculous Answerer, they bring this example, as if one should say, De possibili nego, de facto concedo, I deny the thing to be possible, yet I grant it to haue been done. I see no remedy but you must be forced to this Answere; For, that a true harted Protestant vpon any occasion whatsoeuer, lift vp his head agaynst the Lords Annoynted, you say is not possible: yet I hope you be not so impudent agaynst the knowledge of mankind, but you will confesse that they haue often lifted vp their head
                              •
                            and hands agaynst their Soueraignes, the proper miracle of your Gospel, to done thinges that cannot be done. I pray you, they that first planted the Gospell in Scotland, &amp; the Ministers of England in the dayes of Queen Elizabeth, were they not true-harted Protestāts? Was not the Kings mother the Lords Annoynted? by byrth-right a Soueraigne Princesse? Did you not lift vp your heads agaynst her? I cry you mercy, you did not lift vp you heads against her, but your axe agaynst her head, hauing first lifted vp your hands, your armes, your swordes to depriue her of her Crowne, to cast her from her Kingdome. Looke vpon all Countryes of Europe where Protestants liue vnder Catholicke Princes, if you find one Nation, or Prouince of them, that within these last seauen yeares hath not been in open Rebellion agaynst their Catholicke Soueraignes, I will grant you the Question, that you Protestants are impeccable, that bad thoughts can not enter into your harts.
                        But the King hath had long experience, that at least the Protestants of England will not lift vp their heads agaynst the Lords Annoynted vpon any occasion whatsoeuer. I pray you, what experience hath his Maiesty had, that in the occasion he should depriue you of your Deaneryes, take from you the Church-vsurped Liuings, put you in prison, set vp a Religion that would not endure wiuing-preachers; what experience, I say, longe or short, great or little hath his Maiesty had, that in this, &amp; the like occasions you will not rebell, lift vp your heads, hands, swordes agaynst him? yea if you be able, lay the axe on his necke, as you did on his Mothers? When you seemed to haue some little cause of iealousy that his Maiesty might grant some Conniuency vnto Catholickes, was not there a Minister found, that in pulpit did publickly preach, that in Case the King

should turne Papist, Ministers may depose him?
                        But alas, A Iesuits wit, you say, is growne very barren, he hath no other euasion, but this Flim-flam about the Rebellious Spirit and doctrine of Protestants. No other euasion? Yea he hath otherwise confuted your false calumniations, and cleerly layd open your idle Arguments. And the doctrine taught by Protestants, that the people hath the sword, from which the King is not exempt; If he be wicked, he must dye the death; That, Iudges ought to call Kinges to the Barre, proceed agaynst them for ordinary Crimes, as much as agaynst other malefactours; That, the people maketh Kings, and may agayne vnking them at their pleasure, as easely as a man recalls his letters of Proxy; These doctrins I say be they Flim-flams, nothing pertinent vnto Kings? I perceaue you would haue Kinges sleep in security, and not feare your attempts, that so (if they anger you) you may do with their Heades, as Iahel did with the head of sleeping Sisera. Iudic. c. 4.
                        
                     
                     
                        The Ministers Cauill agaynst the Iesuits speciall Vow of Obedience to the Pope.
                        YOVR fifth and last Assault is an often repeated Calumniation, that Iesuits cannot be Loyall vnto Kings, because they are bound by speciall Vow vnto Popes. Hence to proue, that Iesuits hold singular opinions to enlarge the Popes Power, you say (pag. 573.) That Iesuits more thē other Romists are obliged by speciall Vow to mantayne Papall dignity. And pag. 579. If his Holynes send another wind, you which haue Vowed strict Obedience vnto the Pope, must turne your sayles, your Votes and Prayers must be bound to execute the Popes pleasure (in killing the King.) And agayne pag. 577. What safety and security can Princes inioy by relying vpon such seruants, which stand Centinell vpon an houres warning, to follow their greater Maister? If your Maisters hand cast Crosse insteed of Pile, what shall we expect from such Gamesters, Quibus Ludus sunt Capita &amp; Diademata Regum?
                        This is your Cauill, vttered with all possible gall, which yet is cleered by the words in your margent out of the Bull of Confirmatiō of the Institute of the Iesuits by Pope Paul the third. You cite them in latin as agaynst Iesuits, to delude fooles. But you English them not, as knowing they tend to the credit of Iesuits, &amp; the discouery of your slaunder. These they be: We 
                                 •
                              udge i
                                 •
                               expediēt for the greater deuotion to the Sea Apostolicke, &amp; more full abnegation of our owne selfe wills and pleasures, that the Professed of this Society, besides the Common band of three Vowes, be further tyed by speciall Vow, so that whatsoeuer

the Roman Bishop for the time being shall command PERTINENT VNTO THE SALVATION OF SOVLES, and PROPAGATION OF THE FAITH, they shall be bound to execute the same presently, without tergiuersation and excuse, whether THEY SHALL BE SENT VNTO TVRKES, or vnto INFIDELS, euen vnto those which are commonly called THE INDYES, or vnto HERETIKES, or SCHISMATIKS.
                        
                        These be the words, contayning the matter of the Iesuits speciall Vow. By which it appeareth, that their Vow is not to enlarge Papal power, but to propagate the Christian Name, to find out, not new opinions to put men vnder the Pope, but new Nations, neuer heard of before, to exalt thē to Heauen, by teaching them the sauing Truth. Nor are Iesuits bound by this Vow to obey the Pope absolutely in all things, but in things that are according to their Institute, which is to follow (as neere as by diuine grace they may) the life of Iesus. If the Pope command them, they must obey in thinges that pertayne vnto the Saluation of soules, not in thinges which belonge vnto the destruction of bodyes. If the Pope bid, they be bound to go begging in Apostolicall manner, not fighting in military sort▪ to carry the Crosse, not to brandish the sword; to sound the Gospell of peace, not the Trumpet of Warre; to giue in the defence of truth their owne Bloud, not to shed the bloud of others; to help men vnto eternall Crownes, not to take temporall Crownes from any.
                        Hence you may see, Iesuits stand indeed Centinell at an houres warning, to be sent vnto Iewes, Turkes, Infidells, Indians, Caniballs, to preach the Gospel, and in preaching thereof to expose their liues to dayly dangers of death, destitute of all comfort that the world can affoard. In execution whereof they haue by their labours brought to the knowledge of blisfull life, and to the hope of euerlasting Crownes, many Princes &amp; Kingdoms in the Indyes: whereas your Gospell the meane while did nothing but tumultuate, rayse seditions, murther, and put Kings from their Thrones in Europe. In so much as Beza (Epist. Theol. 63.) sayth; What Churches should we now haue, had we not erected them by force of armes, agaynst the will of Kings? Whence it is cleere, that the Iesuits Vow to be ready at an houres warning to goe vnto any Country of Infidels to preach the Gospell, is not against the safety and security of Kings.
                        If some Ministers in England, could so eloyne themselues from all affections of this life, as to bind themselues by Vow vnto their Lord of Canterbury, to be ready at an houres warning, to goe when he sends them without tergiuersatiō or excuse, to preach the Gospell, whether to Iewes,

Turkes, Infidells, Indians, or Caniballs, as he shall thinke most 
                              〈◊〉
                            how this Vow would endāger the Kings security, I do not see. 
                              〈…〉
                            would indeed trouble their Wiues, &amp; so it is a Perfection not to

                            for amongst wiuing Gospellers: Yea they cānot endure the sight thereof, more then Bats the Cādle, which they striue to put out with their impure winges, as these men labour to disgrace such glorious Institutes their Wiuing Gospell cānot aspire vnto, with the filth of all slaunderous Reports.
                        The Title of Gamesters, quibus ludus sunt Capita &amp; Diademata Regum, that play and sport at the decrowning and beheading of Kings, which for a farewell you would shake frō your selues vpon Iesuits, will not so easily goe from you; it is proprium quarto modo to you, the note and ensigne of your Gospell, the distinctiue Marke of your Profession, and will be so longe as there shall be mention thereof. For your gaming, feasting, and triumphing at the beheading of the Lords Annoynted is set vpō Authenticall Record in your owne Chronicles [Iohn Stow. pag. 1240.] Will you reade it? Anno Reg. 29. The 6. of December, The Lord Maior of London assisted with Diuers Earles, Barons, the Aldermen of London in scarlet, the principall Officers of the Citty, the greatest number of the Gentlemen of the best account, in and about the Citty, with the number of 80. of the most Grauest and Worshipfullest Cittizens in Coats of Veluet, and Chaynes of Gold, all on horsebacke IN MOST SOLEMNE &amp; stately manner, BY THE SOVND OF FOVRE TRVMPETS, about ten of the clocke in the fore Noone, made open and publicke Proclamation of the SENTENCE GIVEN for the BEHEADING OF THE QVEENE OF SCOTS, to the GREAT and WONDERFVL REIOYCING of the people OF ALL SORTES, as manifestly appeared by RINGING of Bells, making of BONEFIRES, and SINGING of Psalmes IN EVERY streete, and lane of the Citty.
                        
                        Neuer since Christianity began was there Sect or Nation of men vnder the Name of Christian, that did iuridically behead a Christian Annoynted King, feasting, singing, and dancing about Bonefyres for ioy in that respect, but only your Ghospell. So as men hearing the Title of Gamesters, quibus ludus sunt Capita &amp; Diademata Regum, can they vnderstand any other Profession but yours?
                        Thus I haue more largely encountred with your slaunders, that you might see you gayne nothing by your bitter excursions into odious matters. The myst of your Cauills is easily dispersed, by the euidence of the Truth; your Calumniations agaynst Catholicks, as balls cast agaynst a wall of brasse, (For—murus aheneus esto—Nil conscire sibi.)— returne with a strong rebound of confusion vpon your owne face.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  THE CONCLVSION.
                  
                     HAVING performed your Maiestyes will and pleasure in seeking to giue satisfaction about the Nine principal points that withhold your Roall Assent from ioyning vnto the Roman Church, my poore endeauours prostrate at your Maiestyes feete to receiue their doome, humbly beseech this fauour, that your Charity &amp; Desire of the vnitie of the Church, may ioyne togeather with your Excellent Wisdome and Learninge to pronounce the sentence.
                  Although I be confident, that examining Religion by the meere rigour of onely Scripture, the Catholicke Doctrines would get the victorie, more cleere and expresse testimonies standing on our side, then any that Protestāts can bring for thēselues, This is further made cleere by the Reioynder, so that it is but the face of a Minister to say in this place That our relying on Scripture is Vanitas vanitatū.
                      as by the former discourse may appeare: Although also, I be much more confident in the tradition and perpetual practise of the Church interpreting Scripture, which by so full cōsent deliuers the Roman Doctrine, that partialitie it selfe duely pondering the weight of thinges, can hardly in hart, and inwardly iudge against them; yet my chiefest hope is in these Charitable thoughtes, and desires of peace and vnitie in the whole Christian world, which the holy Ghost hath inspired into your Brest.
                  For suppose, that Preconceipts instilled into tender myndes agaynst the faith of Auncestours, might so farre preuaile, as to make them thinke (comparing Catholikes with Protestāts) that Scriptures stand equally

on both sides, yea (sifting the matter by Scripture only) that Protestants may seeme to haue the vpper hand, yet Charitie will moue this question, Whether the testimonies and arguments they bring from Scripture, are so vndeniably cleere, and so vnauoydably strong, that no answere or euasion may be found, but the Roman The Minister sayth we giue seeming and appering solutiōs, but this is done by Sophistry. I aske who shall be Iudge? Or how can this by tryed by Scripture? Church must be refused, notwithstandinge so much discord and dissention, so much inconstancy &amp; incertainty about religion, which (as reason proueth) must, and (as experience sheweth) doth thereupon ensue.
                  For, if you cast away the Roman Church and her authority, noe Church is left in the world, that can with reason, or dares for shame challenge to be infallible in her definitions; &amp; if such a Church be wanting, what meanes is left either to keepe the learned certainly in peace, or to giue vnto the ignorant assurance what is the Doctrine of Saluation the Apostles first preached?
                  A Church fallible in her teaching, is by the learned to be trusted noe further, then they do see her Doctrines consonant vnto Scripture, and so they may neglect her Iudgment when they seeme to haue euidences of Scripture against her. And if this libertie of contradiction be granted, what hope of Vnity remaines, when a priuate man may wrangle eternally with the whole Church, &amp; neuer be conuinced apparantly of teaching against the Scriptures? Whereof we haue to many dayly examples.
                  If we take out of the world a Church infallible, whence shall ignorant men learne which is the Doctrine of saluation that the Apostles deliuered? It is as euident, as the Sunne shyning at noone Day, and the

euidence of the thing hath forced some Protestants to acknowledge, That the Controuersies of Religion in our time are grown in number so many, and in nature so intricate, that few haue time and leasure,
                     
                        Field of the Church Prefat. in l. 1. 
                     fewer strength of vnderstanding to examine them; so that nothing remaines for men desi
                        
                           •
                        ous of satisfaction in things of such consequēce, but diligently to search out which amongest all the Societyes of men in the world, is the Church of the liuing God, the pillar &amp; ground of truth, that so they may imbrace her communion, follow her directions, rest in her Iudgement.
                  
                  If there be no Church in the world besides the the Roman, that can with any colour pretend Infallibity of Iudgement: If the most part of men cannot by their examining of Controuersies be resolued in faith, and therfore must perish eternally, except they finde a Church that is an infallible mistresse of truth, in whose Iudgment they may securely rest; Certainly those that haue bowells of Charity, will accept of any probable answere vnto Protestants obiections and accusations, rather then discredit the authority of so necessary a Church, which being discredited no Church remaines in the world of credit, sufficient to sustaine the waight of Christian, that is, infallible Beliefe.
                  What a misery will it be if it fall out (as it is most likely it will fall out) that at the Day of Iudgement the most part of English Protestants be found to haue belieued points of Doctrine necessary to saluation, not out of their owne certaine skill in Scripture, as they should by the principles of their religiō, but The Minister here rayleth, but dares not directly answere the Question, What shall become of ignorant mē who belieued the truth vpō the credit of their Church, &amp; not vpō their owne infallible knowledge? vpō the credit of the Church that teacheth them, which doth acknowledge her selfe no sufficient stay of assured beliefe? For without question men cannot be saued who although they belieued the truth, yet belieued it vpon a

deceauable ground, and consequently by humaine and fallable perswasion, and not (as need is) by a diuine, most certaine beliefe, grounded vppon an infallible foundation, which cannot be had without an infallible Church. How dreadfull then must the danger be of liuing out of the lappe of the Roman Church, that is, of a Church of infallible Authority?
                  This Church hauing a most glorious succession of Bishops from the Apostles, deserues aboue all other the protection of your Maiesty, who by a long line of religious Catholike Ancestors succeed in the right of two Illustrious Kingdomes, and being so beneficiall vnto mankind, &amp; so efficacious to mayntayne Vnity; Our Hopes did not dye with our late Soueraigne, but still liue in his Royall Issue, and of the most Sacred Queene &amp; Martyr his Mother. we cannot giue ouer hope of your Fauour, whom singular preseruation in the wombe of your glorious mother agaynst the barbarous attempts of Hereticall diuision that would haue brought you to an immature end, shewes to be by Gods infinite wisdome perordained for some singular good of mankind, specially by your meanes to quench wars and dissentions, and to bestow the blessings of peace &amp; vnion on this land. Your Title to the Crowne of England springes from the peacefull coniunction of the two renowned Roses, which before were mortall enemies, and fought so many cruell feilds, that if we consider the great effusion of bloud, wherein ech of them were bathed, we shall hardly discerne the one from the other, by the diuersity of colour.
                  Your Maiesties Person is the roote of a more happy vnion of two most glorious Kingdomes, by your Sacred Person combined in assured peace, which in the hystoryes of former times are by no other markes more famously knowne, then by their mutuall warres.
                  Nothing remaines to be added, for the full consummation

of this Ilands happines, and your Maiesties immortal Glory, but the quenching of discord about religion, by bringing them back againe to the roote &amp; matrice of the Catholique Church,

Wherby your Maiesty shall extend the blessings of peace from this Iland to the rest of Europe, from the the body vnto the soule; and crowne your temporall peace and felicity with eternall. For both which, not only I, but all of my profession, yea all Catholikes, wil offer vnto Almighty God our daily praiers.
